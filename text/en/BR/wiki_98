==History==
The municipality was settled very early. Burials and ceramics from the Bronze Age have been discovered. During Roman times, Aigle lay on the road from the Great Saint Bernard pass via &quot;Viviscus&quot; (Vevey) to &quot;Aventicum&quot; (Avenches), the Roman capital. The Romans had a number of names for Aigle: &quot;Ala&quot; (&quot;Wing&quot;), &quot;Alena&quot; (&quot;Little Wing&quot;), &quot;Aquilegia&quot; and &quot;Aquilas&quot; (&quot;Eagles&quot;).

The first medieval mention of the municipality occurs in 1150 under the name of &quot;Alium&quot;.

A mention in 1153 gives the name as &quot;Aleo&quot;. Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV gave the territory of Aigle in 1076 to the house of Savoy. The Abbeys of Great Saint Bernard and Saint-Maurice also had holdings in Aigle, and the latter established a priory, from which the village of Le Cloître takes its name.

In 1231, Aigle was made a market town by Thomas I of Savoy, and in 1314 it was raised to a free town by Amadeus V of Savoy.

It became an important commercial center because of its location on the road to Italy.

It had a common parish with Leysin (until 1702) and with Corbeyrier and Yvorne (until 1831). SInce the 14th century, it had a treaty with Sembrancher in Valais, that committed the two communities for mutual aid in case of war or natural disaster.

In 1475, the mountain regions of Saanen and Pays-d&#x27;Enhaut, who were allied with Bern, attacked and burned the tower of Aigle Castle. They then gave Aigle town and the surrounding district, including Ollon, Bex, and Les Ormonts, to Bern in exchange for not having to pay one-third of their income to Bern. In the treaty of Fribourg from 1476, Fribourg received rights over the Aigle district, which they gave up to Bern in 1483. Bern rebuilt Aigle Castle in 1489 and made it the seat of the bailiwick of Aigle. The Aigle bailiwick included all of the present district except Villeneuve. It was thus the first of the French-speaking parts of Switzerland to become subject to Bern.

In 1528, the Reformation was first preached in Aigle by Guillaume Farel.

From 1798 to 1803, Aigle belonged to the canton of Léman in the Helvetic Republic, which was transformed into the canton of Vaud with the mediation of Napoleon.

The Geographical dictionary of 1821 by J. van Wijk Roelandszoon names the village Aelen, comprises 600 houses and 2.500 inhabitants, with a Salt mine that yields 15,000 cents. The district Aelen is long and in width, 7500 total inhabitants.

In the 19th century, the canton of Vaud was an outspoken opponent of an attempt by a number of cantons to secede from Switzerland. This Catholic separatist movement (Sonderbund) led to intervention in 1847 by 99,000 Swiss Federal troops under General Henri Dufour against 79,000 separatists in what is called the Sonderbund war. Separation was prevented at the cost of 86 lives. The 1848 Swiss Federal Constitution was created in response of the Sonderbund war.

==The Chablais and the Chablais Alps==

Chablais was a former province of the Duchy of Savoy. Its historic capital was Thonon-les-Bains. The modern Chablais &quot;region&quot; is three territories: the Chablais Savoyard, the Chablais Valaisan, and the Chablais Vaudois. The Chablais Savoyard is within the department of Haute-Savoie in France, the Chablais Valaisan is in the Swiss canton of Valais, and the Chablais Vaudois is in the Swiss canton of Vaud. The Chablais Alps is the mountain range situated between France and Switzerland.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Aigle is twinned with:
==Transportation and the Transports Publics du Chablais==

Aigle is a stop on the Swiss Federal Railway&#x27;s (SBB CFF FFS) high speed Simplon line between Italy (Domodossola) north to Lausanne and Geneva. At the Aigle SBB CFF FFS station, connections can be made to three narrow gauge railways, the ASD, AL, and AOMC. The Aigle-Sepey-Diablerets railway&#x27;s (ASD) route goes east and rises from Aigle to the ski resort of Diablerets. The Aigle-Leysin railway&#x27;s (AL) route goes east and rises from Aigle to the ski resort and grand vista of Leysin. The Aigle-Ollon-Monthey-Champerey railway&#x27;s (AOMC) route runs west from Aigle across the Rhone and valley, then climbs to the ski resort of Champery. These railways, plus the Bex–Villars–Bretaye railway (BVB) which runs east from Bex, a village just south of Aigle, are operated by Transports Publics du Chablais with the motto: &quot;Depuis plus de cent ans et contre toute attente, des lignes des TPC reunissent plaine et montagne, Vaud et Valais, ville et campagne, terres catholiques et protestantes.&quot; Translated roughly: &quot;For over 100 years and contrary to all expectations, the railways of TPC have joined plain and mountain, town and country, of the Vaud and Valais districts of Switzerland, land of both Catholics and Protestants.&quot; The TPC &quot;motto&quot; refers to the religious composition and history of the general region known historically as the Chablais which has known turmoil. In 1846–7, the Valais canton tried to secede from Switzerland with the intention of joining a proposed Catholic confederation of cantons called the Sonderbund, but this was put down by Swiss Federal troops. The ASD, the AL, and the BVB railways operate within the canton of Vaud. The AOMC operates in the Vaud and into the Canton of Valais when it crosses the Rhone to reach Monthey and Champery.

New construction rebuilt Aigle&#x27;s Place de la Gare in partnership with municipal and canton administration and Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS). The project provided new train platforms at the SBB CFF FFS station to accommodate the trains of the AL, ASD and AOMC. Also added was AOMC track alongside SBB CFF FFS track to a new TPC office and workshop at &quot;En Châlex&quot;. With approximately 3 million passengers using its facilities each year, Aigle is the second most important station in canton Vaud after Lausanne. (Source: Le Bleu Matin, 8.10.2007). There are plans, awaiting approval, for the extension of the Aigle-Leysin line beyond Leysin deep into the Berneuse whereby passengers will be able to travel, without transfers, to a site that provides magnificent views of the Alps, the Jura, and Lake Geneva. This project is an investment which will benefit the entire region and offer a boost to tourism, the region&#x27;s No. 1 industry. Landslides have required periodic emergency work to stabilise above and below the trackside adjacent soil and rock, much of which is covered in coniferous forest. This has included the erection of 150 meters of mesh barrier to prevent falling rock reaching the tracks and to offer protection to railway workers.

<text>Jack Vettriano (born Jack Hoggan, 17 November 1951) is a Scottish painter. His 1992 painting &quot;The Singing Butler&quot; became a best-selling image in Britain.

== Early life ==
Jack Vettriano was born and grew up in the industrial seaside town of Methil, Fife. He was raised in poverty; he lived with his mother, father and older brother in a spartan miner&#x27;s house, sharing a bed with his brother and wearing hand-me-down clothes. From the age of 10, his father sent him out delivering papers and milk, cleaning windows and picking potatoes – any job that would earn money. His father took half his earnings.

Vettriano left school at 16 and later became an apprentice mining engineer. For a short time in the late 1960s, he had a summer job as a bingo caller at the Beachcomber Amusements on Leven Promenade. Vettriano took up painting as a hobby in the 1970s, when a girlfriend bought him a set of watercolours for his 21st birthday. His earliest paintings, under his birth name &quot;Jack Hoggan&quot;, were copies or pastiches of impressionist paintings; his first painting was a copy of Claude Monet&#x27;s &quot;Poppy Fields&quot;. Much of his influence came from studying paintings at the Kirkcaldy Museum and Art Gallery. In 1984, Vettriano first submitted his work to the Shell-sponsored art exhibition in the museum.

In 1987, when he was 36, Vettriano left his wife Gail, seeking to emulate Paul Gauguin. He quit his job in educational research and moved to Edinburgh where he adopted his mother&#x27;s maiden name. He applied to study Fine Art at the University of Edinburgh, but his portfolio was rejected.

== Career ==

In 1988, Vettriano submitted two canvases for the Royal Scottish Academy annual show. Both paintings sold on the first day and Vettriano was approached by several galleries. Further exhibitions followed in Edinburgh, London, Hong Kong and Johannesburg. In November 1999, Vettriano&#x27;s work was shown for the first time in New York City, when 21 paintings were displayed at The International 20th Century Arts Fair at The Armory. More than 40 collectors from the UK flew out for the event and 20 paintings were sold on the opening night.

In 1996 Sir Terence Conran commissioned Vettriano to create a series of paintings for his new Bluebird Gastrodome in London. The seven paintings, inspired by the life of Sir Malcolm Campbell, hung there for 10 years. Heartbreak Publishing, Vettriano&#x27;s own publishing company, produced a boxed set featuring signed, limited-edition prints of all seven paintings to mark the 75th anniversary of Campbell&#x27;s final World Land Speed Record. The Bluebird paintings were auctioned by Sotheby&#x27;s at the Gleneagles Hotel in Perthshire on 30 August 2007 and made more than £1m in all: the most expensive was &quot;Bluebird at Bonneville&quot;, bought for £468,000.

===Prices and values===
His easel paintings cost between £48,000 and £195,000 new. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot; he earns £500,000 a year in print royalties. Vettriano&#x27;s 1992 painting, &quot;The Singing Butler&quot;, has been the best-selling image in Britain. On 21 April 2004 the original canvas of &quot;The Singing Butler&quot; sold at auction for £744,500. It had been rejected in 1992 by the Royal Academy summer exhibition. The composition for the painting, as discovered by Scottish designer Sandy Robb, had been sourced from the &quot;Illustrator’s Figure Reference Manual&quot;.

In April 2010, seven out of ten paintings by Vettriano failed to sell at Sotheby&#x27;s spring auction of Scottish pictures. Those that sold did so for half their previous prices. Art experts suggested that the monetary value of Vettriano&#x27;s works needed reassessing.

==Studios and publishing==
Vettriano has studios in Scotland and London. He was represented by the Portland Gallery, London from 1993 to 2007, and counts Jack Nicholson, Sir Alex Ferguson, Sir Tim Rice and Robbie Coltrane amongst his collectors. To date, five books have been published about Vettriano, the most recent of which, &quot;Studio Life&quot;, was published in March 2008. In February 2009, Vettriano launched Heartbreak Publishing and his own London gallery, also called Heartbreak, which exclusively represents him, and also promotes younger artists.

In March 2010, &quot;Days of Wine And Roses&quot; was opened by Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond at the Kirkcaldy Museum. The exhibition then transferred to Vettriano&#x27;s gallery in London.

==Awards and honours==
Vettriano received an Order of the British Empire (OBE) award for Services to Visual Arts during a ceremony at Buckingham Palace on Thursday 27 November 2003.

On 24 March 2010, Sir Jackie Stewart presented Vettriano with the Great Scot of the Year award. The award ceremony was held at the Boisdale Club in London. The award led MSP Ted Brocklebank to file a motion in parliament calling for Vettriano&#x27;s contribution to Scottish culture to be recognised.

In February 2011, it was announced that Vettriano&#x27;s self-portrait &quot;The Weight&quot; would be displayed at the re-opened Scottish National Portrait Gallery from November 2011, the first time he had exhibited at a national gallery. Deputy director Nicola Kalinsky said Vettriano was &quot;a figure we have wanted on our wall for a while for obvious reasons&quot;. First Minister, Alex Salmond said of Vettriano, &quot;He is a wonderful artist of considerable talent and achievement and this is a magnificent tribute to the special place he holds in the hearts of people in Scotland.&quot;

In May 2011, &quot;The Ballroom Spy&quot; exhibition opened at Vettriano&#x27;s gallery; &quot;Heartbreak&quot; a new exhibition by Vettriano in collaboration with the photographer, Jeanette Jones was also scheduled. In July 2011, the exhibition transferred to the Royal West of England Academy in Bristol, which was viewed as a controversial choice by many.

In February 2012, Vettriano&#x27;s most famous painting, &quot;The Singing Butler&quot;, went on display at the Aberdeen Art Gallery as part of an exhibition entitled, &quot;From Van Gogh to Vettriano&quot;.

In September 2013, a major exhibition, &quot;Jack Vettriano: A Retrospective&quot;, opened at Glasgow&#x27;s Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. It featured over 100 works and ran until 23 February 2014.

In 2015, a private collection of 12 works by Vettriano raised a total of £837,900 at an auction in Edinburgh.

==Commissions==
In January 2012, menswear brand Stefano Ricci launched its Spring Summer 2012 collection with a campaign inspired by the work of Jack Vettriano. The SS 2012 catalogue, entitled &quot;Stefano Ricci – a tribute to Vettriano&quot;, featured images by Vettriano and photographic re-interpretations shot by Fredi Marcarini featuring clothes and accessories from the Ricci 2012 collection. A short film about the 2012 Vettriano campaign commemorated the collaboration.

In 2017, he was one of three artists commissioned to paint portraits of Scottish comedian Billy Connolly to celebrate Connolly&#x27;s 75th birthday. These were then put on display in Glasgow&#x27;s People&#x27;s Gallery, while the images were transferred to murals in the centre of Glasgow. Vettriano&#x27;s mural is located in Dixon Street, off St Enoch Square. It was the subject of a BBC Scotland documentary first broadcast on 14 June 2017.

In 2018, Worthing&#x27;s &quot;Room with a View&quot; gallery showcased 30 Vettriano paintings. Art dealer Jane Hill stated that Vettriano is &quot;self-taught which I admire immensely. He has really pulled himself up from the depth of nowhere.&quot;

==Artistic style==
Vettriano is a self-taught artist in drawing and perspective who manipulates paint in veiled glazes and meaningful shadows. Vettriano&#x27;s style has been compared to those of Hopper and Sickert, and his scudded beaches to those of Boudin. In many of his paintings, there is a hidden narrative, in enigmatic compositions, a starting point for dozens of short stories.

==Criticism==
According to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; he has been described as the Jeffrey Archer of the art world, a purveyor of &quot;badly conceived soft porn&quot;, and a painter of &quot;dim erotica&quot;. According to &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, critics say Jack Vettriano paints brainless erotica. Sandy Moffat, head of drawing and painting at Glasgow School of Art, said: &quot;He can’t paint, he just colours in.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s art critic Jonathan Jones, described Vettriano&#x27;s paintings as a group as &quot;brainless&quot; and said Vettriano &quot;is not even an artist.&quot; Richard Calvocoressi, at the time director of the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, said: &quot;I’d be more than happy to say that we think him an indifferent painter and that he is very low down our list of priorities (whether or not we can afford his work, which at the moment we obviously can’t). His &#x27;popularity&#x27; rests on cheap commercial reproductions of his paintings.&quot;

In 2013 in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, art critic Jonathan Jones wrote: &quot;Vettriano fixes on fetishistic, stylish objects and paints them with a slick, empty panache&quot; and &quot;The world of Jack Vettriano is a crass male fantasy that might have come straight out of &quot;Money&quot; by Martin Amis&quot;.

In &quot;The Scotsman&quot;, George Kerevan wrote &quot;He suffers all the same criticisms of the early French Impressionists: mere wallpaper, too simplistic in execution and subject, too obviously erotic.&quot; Alice Jones wrote in &quot;The Independent&quot; that Vettriano has been labelled a chauvinist whose &quot;women are sexual objects, frequently half naked and vulnerable, always in stockings and stilettos.&quot; Regarding the criticism, sculptor David Mach has said: &quot;If he was a fashion designer Jack would be right up there. It’s all just art world snobbery. Anyway, who cares, he probably makes more money than Damien Hirst anyway.&quot;

In October 2005, after the original of &quot;The Singing Butler&quot; sold for £740,000, it came to light that Vettriano had used the artists&#x27; reference manual &quot;The Illustrator&#x27;s Figure Reference Manual&quot; to form his figures, using Irish actress Orla Brady for the &#x27;lady in red.&#x27;

== Collaborations ==
Alongside fellow Fifer, author Ian Rankin, Vettriano put in a cameo appearance in a video with Scottish indie band Saint Jude&#x27;s Infirmary made for BBC Scotland&#x27;s &quot;The Music Show&quot;. The video was filmed on Portobello Beach in Edinburgh and included visual references to two of Vettriano&#x27;s most famous paintings, &quot;Elegy for a Dead Admiral&quot; and &quot;The Singing Butler&quot;. The lyrics of the track &quot;Goodbye Jack Vettriano&quot; were written by band member Grant Campbell after seeing a Vettriano print on a pub wall in Rotterdam. Vettriano became a fan of the band after hearing their first album, &quot;Happy Healthy Lucky Month&quot;, and was inspired to create a painting which featured as the cover of the band&#x27;s second album, for which both Vettriano and Rankin contributed spoken word pieces.

In May 2008, Vettriano collaborated with Sir Jackie Stewart, on a triptych of paintings entitled &quot;Tension, Timing, Triumph – Monaco 1971&quot;. The paintings were unveiled by Prince Albert of Monaco at a private reception at the Hôtel de Paris in Monaco on 21 May 2008. The originals hang in Stewart&#x27;s private collection in the UK and the images have been published as a limited edition print.

Following on from the previous year&#x27;s event in Monaco, Vettriano was invited to create a series of paintings to celebrate the centenary of Tuiga, the Yacht Club de Monaco&#x27;s flagship yacht, which was built on the Clyde. The paintings were first shown in an exhibition, &quot;Homage à Tuiga&quot;, in Monaco and were part of a touring exhibition that opened at the Kirkcaldy Museum in Fife in March 2010.

Vettriano worked with the Italian photographer Fredi Marcarini, both on a series of photographs for the &quot;Homage à Tuiga&quot; exhibition and on a triptych of portrait shots. In May 2011, Vettriano collaborated on the exhibition &quot;The Ballroom Spy&quot; with the photographer Jeanette Jones.

In collaboration with fellow Fife native Stephen Anderson of Commercial Spirits, Vettriano launched Jack Vettriano Gin, a spirit product featuring four of Jack&#x27;s paintings: &quot;The Singing Butler&quot;, &quot;Billy Boys&quot;, &quot;Along Came A Spider&quot; and &quot;A Kind of Loving&quot;. The brand was launched at the Forth Floor Bar &amp; Restaurant in collaboration with Louise Masson, GM of Harvey Nichols, Edinburgh with an auction of four signed giclée paintings raising over £7000 for charity Bottle sets of #1, #2 and #3 were donated to the &quot;Lunch With an Old Bag&quot;, a charity auction on 7 September 2018 at Prestonfield House in Edinburgh

== Philanthropy ==
In 2004 Vettriano set up a scholarship for University of St Andrews to fund a student who would not otherwise be able to attend university. The scholarship is awarded every four years. The endowment follows his financial contribution towards refurbishing the Students Association&#x27;s Old Union Coffee Bar in 2002 and his involvement in student fashion shows. He was made a Doctor of Letters by the university.

Vettriano has donated several works of art to be sold in aid of charities, including the Terrence Higgins Trust. In September 2001, Vettriano donated a painting, &quot;Beautiful Dreamer&quot; to a charity auction, which was held at Sotheby&#x27;s in aid of Help the Hospices. In 2008, a drawing he made of that subject sold at a charity auction in aid of the Oriel Plas Glyn-y-Weddw Gallery in Llanbedrog, North Wales in July, helping to keep the gallery open.

Vettriano donated a portrait of Zara Phillips , entitled &quot;Olympia&quot;, to Sport Relief in 2008. The painting went to a charity fund-raising auction, selling at Bonhams for £36,000. In 2010, Vettriano created a postcard – alongside names such as Tracey Emin and Florence Welch – as part of a British Airways campaign for Sport Relief. The postcard raised over £2,000.

Also in 2010, Vettriano helped to raise money for the conservation movement Elephant Family by participating in an auction of donated elephant sculptures and models. Vettriano&#x27;s elephant, &quot;The Singing Butler Rides Again&quot;, was the highest bid-for lot, selling for £155,000. Vettriano was also asked by First Minister, Alex Salmond to create his official Christmas card &quot;Let&#x27;s Twist Again&quot;. The original painting and limited-edition prints later sold at auction for the benefit of four Scottish charities, raising £86,000.

== Personal life ==
Divorced from his first wife, Vettriano divides his time between homes in London, Kirkcaldy, and Nice, France. In Kirkcaldy he lives in the boardroom section of the former Nairn linoleum factory, now converted into residential use.

In November 2004, he was awarded the OBE. He claims he has drawn inspiration for his paintings from &quot;25 years of sexual misbehaviour&quot;. In 2010, he told &quot;The Independent&quot;: &quot;I live in a world of heartbreak... I just seem to be more creative when I&#x27;m in some kind of emotional distress&quot;, adding &quot;It&#x27;s been four years of soul-searching – nicotine, alcohol, anti-depressants, temazepam&quot;.

In 2010 Vettriano said about relationships, &quot;Whenever someone stays for longer than two days, I get cabin fever&quot; and that he loves shoe-shopping with women. 

He likes to gamble on horses, but only bets what he can afford to lose. He has set up the Vettriano Trust, and plans to leave his money to it to do good work.

In February 2012, Vettriano was convicted at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court of drink-driving and possession of amphetamine. He was banned from driving for 18 months and fined £800. When stopped he told the police officer &quot;You know who I am. We can sort this out.&quot;

In 2022 he announced that he had two significantly younger East European muses who had helped him overcome cocaine and alcohol addiction and inspired him to paint again. One works as a waitress in an Edinburgh bistro, and he met the other at a sale in Nice. He explained to &quot;The Telegraph&quot; -

<text>The Atari Falcon030 (usually shortened to Atari Falcon), released in 1992, is the final personal computer from Atari Corporation. A high-end model of the Atari ST line, the machine is based on a Motorola 68030 CPU and a Motorola 56001 digital signal processor, which distinguishes it from most other microcomputers of the era. It includes a new VIDEL programmable graphics system which greatly improves graphics capabilities.

Shortly after release, Atari bundled the MultiTOS operating system in addition to TOS. TOS remained in ROM, and MultiTOS was supplied on floppy disk and could be installed to boot from hard disk.

The Falcon was discontinued in late 1993–a year after its introduction–as Atari restructured itself to focus completely on the release and support of the Jaguar video game console. The Falcon sold in relatively small numbers, mainly to hobbyists.

==Hardware==
The heart of the system is the 32-bit Motorola 68030 clocked at 16 MHz. It runs at about 4 MIPS while displaying video modes with the fewest colors. Despite its 32-bit CPU, the Falcon does not have 32-bit architecture throughout its design, as it has a 16-bit data bus and a 24-bit address bus. This reduces the 68030&#x27;s performance when not operating inside its tiny cache and limits the maximum system memory to ≈14 MB.

The microprocessor is optionally supported by a Motorola 56001 DSP clocked at 32 MHz and performing 16 million instructions per second. Although it is oriented to sound processing (it is directly connected to the RAM and codec via an interconnection matrix), it is also capable of graphics processing (for example, calculation of fractals, deformations, 3D projections, and JPEG decompression). It can even, jointly with the 68030, play MP3 files in real time.

Another innovation (for its time) is the VIDEL video controller. The possibilities offered by the graphics processor are limited only by its frequency (25/32 MHz core, adjustable to 50 MHz with a hardware accelerator) and the slowness of the RAM, as the graphics memory is shared with system memory which can degrade performance significantly when using high resolutions or video modes requiring many bit planes. The parameters are numerous; each timing of a video line (start, end, number of pixels, etc.) is adjustable, the image may be interlaced or not, and the vertical frequency can go down to 50 Hz interlaced to display on a television. The number of colors is also adjustable when VIDEL operates in bit plane mode. This mode is available for compatibility with the previous generation, but is quite complex to manage. There is also a &quot;true color&quot; 16-bit mode in which bits defining each pixel are grouped together to display 65,536 colors simultaneously, though CPU performance is degraded while displaying this mode.

In addition, Atari adopted the IDE bus in addition to the SCSI bus for connecting hard drives and CD-ROM drives. This allows for less expensive disk and CD-ROM devices, as SCSI interfaced devices remained relatively expensive. However, the IDE connector is internal and requires case modification to connect two hard disks or a single CD-ROM. The other drawback is that this early IDE port uses only programmed I/O unlike a SCSI drive that can directly access the RAM (DMA).

==Legacy==
Atari created a number of prototypes of the Falcon040 (based on the more capable fully pipelined, integrated-FPU, Motorola 68040, and using a &quot;microbox&quot; case), but canceled it. The microbox case resembled the later Sony PlayStation 2, right down to the ability to run it vertically or horizontally. It is even referenced in the PS2 patent applications.

In 1995, the music company C-Lab bought the rights to the Falcon hardware design and began producing their own versions. The Falcon Mk I was a direct continuation of Atari&#x27;s Falcon030 with TOS 4.04. The Falcon Mk II addressed a number of shortcomings in the original design, making it more suitable to use in a recording studio (these were unofficially termed &#x27;Cubase modifications&#x27;) such as accepting Line-level audio in without the need for a pre-amp or mixer. The Falcon Mk X was mounted in a 19&quot; 1U rack case, with external keyboard and space for internal SCSI hard disk drives.

Due to its expansion capabilities, several accelerators have been produced. Some of them overclock the CPU and/or the bus, while others upgrade the CPU to a Motorola 68060.

<text>Ballyfin ( or alternatively &quot;town of Fionn&quot;) is a village and parish in the Slieve Bloom Mountains in County Laois, Ireland. It is around 8km west of Portlaoise, on the L21121 local road which joins the R423 regional road between Mountrath and Mountmellick.

There are hill walks nearby in the Slieve Bloom Mountains. Most of the area is covered in forest.

== Ballyfin Demesne ==
Ballyfin Demesne is a 600-acre estate that was successively home to the O&#x27;Mores, the Crosbys, the Poles, the Wellesley-Poles and the Cootes. Over the years, several houses have stood on the site. The present building is a neo-classical mansion built by Sir Charles Coote, 9th Baronet (1794–1864) in the 1820s to designs by the leading Irish architects, Richard (1767–1849) and William Vitruvius Morrison (1794–1838).

For much of the twentieth century, it served as a school, having been sold in 1928 by Sir Ralph Coote to the Patrician Brothers, a Roman Catholic teaching order. From 2002, it was the subject of a restoration project, and in May 2011, it opened its doors as a country house hotel.

=== History ===

According to legend, Fionn Mac Cumhaill is said to have been raised here. Fionn ate the Salmon of Knowledge which gave him untold knowledge. Later he became leader of the Fianna. In the medieval period Ballyfin was part of the cantred of Laoighis Reta, the territory of the Ó Mordha, or O&#x27;More, clan who lost out in the Laois-Offaly plantations, the most comprehensive settlement of the Tudor conquest of Ireland. In 1550 Edmund Fay was granted a lease for Ballyfin and about this date Ballyfin appears for the first time on the so-called Cotton Map (British Museum) where it is marked as a clearing in densely forested land. 

About 1600, Sir Piers Crosby purchased lands including Ballyfin and erected a castle. By 1637, Ballyfin was raised to manorial status, but Crosby was on the wrong side in the turmoil of the 1640s and by May 1666, the estate was conferred on Periam Pole, a recent arrival from Devon. His successor William Pole built a &#x27;modern house&#x27; to replace the Crosby castle and his son, another William (died 1781), together with his wife Lady Sarah Moore, (died 1780) daughter of the 5th Earl of Drogheda, set about transforming the demesne into one of the finest examples of the natural style of gardening to be found in Ireland. Centred on its 30-acre man-made lake, the landscape was much admired by Emily, Countess of Kildare, from Carton house in the adjoining county of Kildare who in a letter to her husband described Ballyfin as &#x27;a most delightful place indeed, much beyond any place I have seen in Ireland&#x27;.

William Pole was succeeded by his cousin, William Wellesley (1763-1845), who was the elder brother of Arthur Wellesley, the future Duke of Wellington and who adopted the Pole name to become William Wellesly-Pole. Preoccupied with his political career in England, Wellesly-Pole left Ballyfin uninhabited for long periods, though he continued his predecessors&#x27; improvements to the demesne, employing the landscape designer John Webb.
In 1813, Wellesly-Pole sold Ballyfin to the young Sir Charles Coote, who had inherited the family baronetcy from his cousin the 7th, and last, Earl of Mountrath. The Cootes had been settled in Ireland since the arrival of the first Sir Charles Coote in 1601. An ambitious, indeed ruthless, soldier, Coote (1581–1661) had carved out vast estates in Ireland and been made a baronet by James I, before being killed at the siege of Trim in the 1641 Rebellion. Sir Charles’s descendant and namesake, together with his wife Caroline, set about rebuilding Ballyfin on a magnificent scale. Sir Charles enjoyed ownership of Ballyfin until his death in 1864, when he was succeeded by his son, also Sir Charles. He in turn was succeeded by his brother the Rev. Algernon Coote, whose grandson Ralph finally sold Ballyfin in the 1920s as Irish Independence hastened the demise of the Big House.

The estate was purchased by the Patrician Brothers, a Roman Catholic teaching order who ran a much-loved school from the estate, and who in 1928 added a wing to the house. In 2002, a decline in the number of brothers led the order to sell, and the school was moved to the nearby village of Mountrath. The estate was purchased by Fred and Kay Krehbiel, a Chicago couple with strong Irish connections, who partnered with Jim Reynolds to form Ballyfin Demesne Ltd. After a nine-year restoration project, Ballyfin opened as a luxury hotel in May 2011.

=== Architecture ===
The house, built in the 1820s by the father and son team Richard Morrison and William Vitruvius Morrison, is widely acknowledged as one of the most important examples of nineteenth-century neo-classical architecture in Ireland and is famed for its elaborate interior design in the Empire style. Originally, Dominck Madden (died 1837) was retained and work commenced on a house built to a long symmetrical H-plan, a short distance from the present structure. Madden was, however, sacked by the Cootes and the Morrisons employed in his stead. On the advice of Richard Morrison, the Cootes made the difficult decision to demolish what had been completed of Madden’s building and to build afresh on a new site more favourably removed from the stables and farm buildings.

The house as constructed by the Morrisons is austerely neo-classical on the exterior, with a thirteen-bay façade broken by a portico with giant ionic columns. The Entrance Hall, enlivened with a richly-patterned Roman mosaic brought back from Italy in 1822, leads into the Grand Saloon in the centre of the house. Notable features of the interior include the richness of the stuccowork and the variety of scagliola deployed while the decoration is enhanced by the exotic marquetry of the floors. Design sources liberally plundered by the Morrisons include Percier and Fontaine’s &quot;Palais, Maisons et autres Edificies Modernes&quot; (1798) and Iberian Moorish designs collected by James Cavanagh-Murphy. The inlaid floor of the Rotonda is based on the Lion Court of the Alhambra Palace, Granada, while the ceiling of the Stair Hall is influenced by Coleshill, Berkshire, attributed to Inigo Jones, and included in Isaac Ware&#x27;s &quot;A Complete Body of Architecture&quot; (1756). However, all these disparate elements fuse organically into a masterpiece of early nineteenth-century Irish architecture.

The most notable architectural addition to Ballyfin after the time of the Morrisons was a glass Conservatory by Richard Turner (1798–1881) added at some point after 1855 and accessed through a concealed door in a bookcase in the Library. At about the same date a folly in the form of a ruined medieval tower was constructed on the site of an old limekiln at the highest point of the estate.

=== Restoration ===
Having fallen into disrepair over the years, Ballyfin has been painstakingly restored over the course of the last decade. The urgent need for repairs had become all too apparent when a part of the ceiling in the Gold Drawing Room collapsed having been undermined by wet rot. Masonry was falling from the façade and the Conservatory, choked with overgrown vegetation, was in a dangerous state. This attracted the attention of the Irish Georgian Society, who organized a fund-raising campaign. Despite this, the future of one of Ireland’s finest houses was perilously uncertain, until Ballyfin&#x27;s acquisition by the Krehbiels.

The restoration project has taken nine years – significantly longer than it took to build the house in the first place. Every single aspect of the house from the roof down required remedial attention. Skilled craftsmen worked on the elaborate inlaid floors, repaired the gilding and the stuccowork or treated the stone work of the house which was disintegrating. Overseen by Jim Reynolds, the restoration project combined the conservation expertise of Purcell Miller Tritton and John J. O’Connell, Architects, who had previously been in charge of the restoration of Fota, County Cork, another house designed by the Morrisons. Woody Clark acted as Project Manager.

The project served to highlight the wealth of traditional building skills that are still available in Ireland. The principal contractors were James Farrell Construction from Carlow, while Cornerstone Construction of Cobh acted as the main interior contractors. The decoration was done by CF Quality Decorators Ltd from Laois, whilst the joinery was done by Teamwoodcraft, also based in Laois.

The house and estate are now strictly private to hotel guests.

The salt deposits in Bex were the first ones discovered in Switzerland.

At the beginning of the 18th century, it was entrusted to a general director, the most famous one being Albrecht von Haller.

To provide wood for the salt works in Roche, in 1695 a forest was planted in the Joux Verte gorge. Starting in the 16th century, natural evaporation was replaced by boiling to speed up salt production. The first tunnels were dug in 1684 to find new salt sources. Salt deposits were discovered in Le Bévieux and Les Devens (both part of the municipality of Bex) and Aigle. The mine at Le Bévieux was still in operation at the beginning of the 21st century.

The BVB runs east from Bex to Villars and Bretaye. At nearby Aigle, connections are available at the Aigle SBB/CFF station to the other three very scenic narrow gauge railways of TPC.

Transports Publics du Chablais uses the motto &quot;Depuis plus de cent ans et contre toute attente, des lignes des TPC réunissent plaine et montagne, Vaud et Valais, ville et campagne, terres catholiques et protestantes.&quot; Translated roughly: &quot;For over 100 years and contrary to all expectations, the railways of TPC have joined plain and mountain, town and country, of the Vaud and Valais districts of Switzerland, land of both Catholics and Protestants.&quot; The ASD, the AL, and the BVB railways operate within the Canton of Vaud. The AOMC also operates into the Canton of Valais when it leaves Aigle and crosses the Rhone river to reach Monthey and Champéry. The TPC &quot;motto&quot; refers to the religious composition and history of the region historically known as the Chablais. In 1846-7 the Valais canton attempted to secede from Switzerland with the intention of joining a Catholic confederation of cantons called the Sonderbund, but this was put down by Swiss Federal troops in the brief and relatively bloodless Sonderbund civil war.

<doc id="532996" wikidata="Q2260058" url="?curid=532996" title="Chills">
<text>Chills is a feeling of coldness occurring during a high fever, but sometimes is also a common symptom which occurs alone in specific people. It occurs during fever due to the release of cytokines and prostaglandins as part of the inflammatory response, which increases the set point for body temperature in the hypothalamus. The increased set point causes the body temperature to rise (pyrexia), but also makes the patient feel cold or chills until the new set point is reached. Shivering also occurs along with chills because the patient&#x27;s body produces heat during muscle contraction in a physiological attempt to increase body temperature to the new set point. When it does not accompany a high fever, it is normally a light chill. 

Sometimes a chill of medium power and short duration may occur during a scare, especially in scares of fear, commonly interpreted like or confused by trembling.

Severe chills with violent shivering are called rigors.

== Pathophysiology ==
Chills occur when the hypothalamic temperature set point is suddenly elevated. This could occur due to several causes, including tissue destruction, pyrogenic substances, or dehydration. Due to the body temperature being below the new set point, body mechanisms of raising body temperature, including vasoconstriction, and shivering ensue. The person experiences this period as extreme cold, even though they might have a body temperature higher than normal. As the body temperature rises and reaches the new set point, chills stop and the person feels neither hot nor cold. If the factor causing the high temperature is then removed, the hypothalamic set point decreases, but the body temperature is still higher than it. This then triggers the body cooling mechanisms to reduce the body temperature to the new set point, and is experienced as severe sweating, and hot skin due to vasodilation. This phase of the febrile state is known as the &quot;crisis&quot;, or the &quot;flush&quot;.

<text>Warmians are a Polish ethnic group from Warmia. Most of them are Roman Catholic and speak in the Warmian subdialect of Polish or the High Prussian or Low Prussian dialects of German.

== History ==

Between the 14th and 17th centuries, settlers from northern, Mazovia moved to former territories of Old Prussians, following conquests by the Teutonic Order, and the erection of the Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights. Earlier, the southern parts of Warmia had become German-speaking, but eventually, more Polish settlers than Germans arrived to settle the land, particularly after 1410, so that the region gradually Polonized.

The bishopric of Warmia became in 1466 an autonomous part of Royal Prussia, and remained part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth until 1772 when it was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia (see: Partitions of Poland). While the Mazurs in the neighboring Ducal Prussia became Protestants when Duchy adopted Lutheranism in the 16th century, most Warmiaks, populating the areas around Olsztyn, remained Catholics.

During World War II, the Warmiaks were persecuted by the Nazi German government, which wanted to erase all aspects of Polish culture and Polish language in Warmia.

After the war, due to their Polish roots and their Catholic faith (unlike the Masurians who were predominantly Protestant, who had a friendly attitude towards the Germans), they were not victims of the large-scale expulsion of Germans. However, over the course of time, large numbers of Warmiaks decided to leave their native land and settle in more prosperous West Germany, exercising their right to German citizenship granted by the Basic Law as citizens or their descendants of inhabitants of Germany in the borders of 1937.

<text>The Royal Theatre of La Monnaie (, ; , ; both translating as the &quot;Royal Theatre of the Mint&quot;) is an opera house in central Brussels, Belgium. The National Opera of Belgium, a federal institution, takes the name of this theatre in which it is housed—La Monnaie in French or De Munt in Dutch—referring both to the building as well as the opera company. As Belgium&#x27;s leading opera house, it is one of the few cultural institutions to receive financial support from the Federal Government of Belgium. Other opera houses in Belgium, such as the Vlaamse Opera and the Opéra Royal de Wallonie, are funded by regional governments.

La Monnaie is located on the Place de la Monnaie/Muntplein, not far from the Rue Neuve/Nieuwstraat and the Place de Brouckère/De Brouckèreplein. The current edifice is the third theatre on the site. The façade dates from 1818 with major alterations made in 1856 and 1986. The foyer and auditorium date from 1856, but almost every other element of the present building was extensively renovated in the 1980s. It is served by the metro and &quot;premetro&quot; (underground tram) station De Brouckère on lines 1, 4, 5 and 10.

==History==

===The theatre of Gio-Paolo Bombarda (1700–1818)===
The first permanent public theatre for opera performances of the court and City of Brussels was built between 1695 and 1700 by the Venetian architects Paolo and Pietro Bezzi, as part of a rebuilding plan following the bombardment of Brussels of 1695 by the French army. It was erected on the site of a building that had served to mint coins. The name of this site—&quot;La Monnaie&quot; (originally spelled &quot;La Monnoye&quot;) in French or &quot;De Munt&quot; in Dutch (both meaning &quot;The Mint&quot;)—remained attached to the theatre for the centuries to come. The construction of the theatre had been ordered by Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria, at that time Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands. The Elector had charged his treasurer and architect, the Italian Gio Paolo Bombarda, with the task of financing and supervising the enterprise.

The exact date of the first performance in 1700 remains unknown, but the first showing mentioned in the local newspapers was Jean-Baptiste Lully&#x27;s &quot;Atys&quot;, which was given on 19 November 1700. The French operatic repertoire would dominate the Brussels stage throughout the following century, though performances of Venetian operas and other non-French repertoire were also performed on a regular basis. Until the middle of the 19th century, plays were performed along with opera, ballet and concerts.

By the 18th century, La Monnaie was considered the second French-speaking stage after the most prominent theatres in Paris. Under the rule of Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine, who acted as a very generous patron of the arts, the theatre greatly flourished. At that time, it housed an opera company, a ballet and an orchestra. The splendour of the performances diminished during the last years of Austrian rule, due to the severe politics of Emperor Joseph II.

After 1795, when the French Revolutionary forces occupied the Belgian provinces, the theatre became a French departmental institution. Amongst other cuts in its expenses, the theatre had to abolish its &quot;Corps de Ballet&quot;. During this period, many famous French actors and singers gave regular performances in the theatre whilst touring the country&#x27;s provinces. Then-consul Napoleon, visiting Brussels, judged the old theatre too dilapidated for one of the most prestigious cities of his future Empire. He ordered plans to replace the old building with a new and more monumental edifice, but these plans would only be carried out and Bombarda&#x27;s building demolished in 1818, under the auspices of the new United Kingdom of the Netherlands.

===The theatre of Louis Damesme (1818–1855)===
The new theatre was a neoclassical building designed by the French architect Louis Damesme. Unlike Bombarda&#x27;s building, which was situated along the street and completely surrounded by other buildings, the new theatre was placed in the middle of a newly constructed square. While this also gave it a monumental appearance, the main concern was safety: the building was now more accessible to firemen, and the chance of any fire spreading was reduced. The new auditorium was inaugurated on 25 May 1819 with the opera &quot;La Caravane du Caire&quot; by the composer André Ernest Modeste Grétry.

As the most important French theatre of the newly established United Kingdom of the Netherlands, La Monnaie had national and international significance. The theatre came under the supervision of the City of Brussels, which had the right to appoint a director charged with its management. In this period, famous actors like François-Joseph Talma and singers like Maria Malibran performed at La Monnaie. The &quot;Corps de Ballet&quot; was reintroduced and came under the supervision of the dancer and choreographer Jean-Antoine Petipa, father of the famous Marius Petipa.

La Monnaie would play a prominent role in the formation of the Kingdom of Belgium. Daniel Auber&#x27;s opera &quot;La Muette de Portici&quot; was scheduled in August 1830 after it had been banned from the stage by King William I of the Netherlands, fearing its inciting content. At a performance of this opera on the evening of 25 August 1830, a riot broke out, which became the signal for the Belgian Revolution that ultimately led to the country&#x27;s independence.

Damesme&#x27;s building continued to serve for more than two decades as Belgium&#x27;s principal theatre and opera house until it burnt to the ground on 21 January 1855, leaving only the outside walls and portico.

===The theatre of Joseph Poelaert (1856–present)===
After the fire of January 1855, the theatre was reconstructed after the designs of Joseph Poelaert within a period of fourteen months. The auditorium (with 1,200 seats) and the foyer were decorated in a then-popular Eclectic style, a mixture of neo-Baroque, neo-Rococo and neo-Renaissance styles. The lavish decoration made excessive use of gilded &quot;carton-pierre&quot; decorations and sculptures, red velvet and brocade. The auditorium was lit by a huge crystal chandelier made of gilded bronze and Venetian crystals, which still hangs in the centre of the domed ceiling today. The new &quot;Théâtre royal de la Monnaie&quot; opened on 28 March 1856 with Fromental Halévy&#x27;s &quot;Jaguarita l&#x27;Indienne&quot;.

The original dome painting, representing &quot;Belgium Protecting the Arts&quot;, was produced in the Parisian workshop of François-Joseph Nolau and Auguste Alfred Rubé, two famous decorators of the Paris Opera House. In 1887, this dome painting was completely repainted by Rubé himself and his new associate Philippe-Marie Chaperon, because it was mostly tainted by emissions from the chandelier. This dome painting stayed untouched until 1985, when it was taken down during extensive rebuilding activities and replaced by a bad copy, painted by the painter Xavier Crolls. From 1988 until 1998, the dome painting of Rubé and Chaperon was in restoration, until its final reinstatement in 1999. The sober whitewashed exterior seen today was done many decades later. Poelaert never intended to whitewash these outer walls — in 1856, the exterior did not have any whitewashing at all, as proved by many photographs of that time.

In the middle of the 19th century, the repertoire was dominated by popular French composers such as Halévy, Daniel Auber, and Giacomo Meyerbeer, as well as Italian composers like Gioachino Rossini, Gaetano Donizetti, Vincenzo Bellini and Giuseppe Verdi, who had considerable success in Paris.

===The opera house in the 20th century===
Renovations on Poelaert&#x27;s building were required shortly after opening due to faulty foundation work. The early 20th century saw the addition of a storey, and in the 1950s, of a new stage building. By 1985, it was determined that a complete renovation was needed. Features such as raising the roofline by and scooping out the stage building area—in addition to creating a steel frame to strengthen the load-bearing walls and increasing backstage space—characterised this two-year project. However, the red and gold auditorium remained largely identical. The canvas of the ceiling painting was temporarily removed for restoration and only put back in 1999. It was temporarily replaced by a copy in much brighter colours, which was painted directly on the stucco ceiling.

The entrance hall and the grand staircase underwent a radical makeover, although original features such as the monument by the sculptor Paul Du Bois honouring the Manager and Music Director Dupont (1910), and a number of monumental paintings (1907–1933) by Emile Fabry were preserved. The Liège architect Charles Vandenhove created a new architectural concept for the entrance in 1985–1986. He asked two American artists to make a contribution: Sol LeWitt designed a fan-shaped floor in black and white marble, while Sam Francis painted an abstract triptych mounted to the ceiling. Vandenhove also designed a new interior decoration for the &quot;Salon Royal&quot;, a reception room connected to the Royal Box. For this project, he collaborated with the French artist Daniel Buren. Now seating 1,125, the renovated opera house was inaugurated on 12 November 1986 with a performance of Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 9.

In 1998, the major part of the vacant Vanderborght department store building () and a neoclassical mansion, both situated directly behind the opera house, were acquired by La Monnaie. The edifices were renovated and adapted to house La Monnaie&#x27;s technical and administrative facilities, previously spread all over the city. The building also contains large rehearsal halls for opera, the &quot;Malibran&quot;, and orchestra, the &quot;Fiocco&quot;. They can also be adapted for presenting public performances.

===La Monnaie in the 21st century===
In the last three decades, La Monnaie has reclaimed its place amongst the foremost opera houses in Europe thanks to the efforts of the successive directors Gerard Mortier and Bernard Foccroulle and Music Directors Sylvain Cambreling and Antonio Pappano.

The opera house was renovated again from May 2015 to September 2017: the stage was levelled, a new fly system was put in place, and two scene lifts were installed. This allowed the opera house to stage more technically demanding productions. Although most of the renovations took place backstage, the opera house used this opportunity to replace all of its worn-out seats with new velour seats.

==Directors==

During the 1980s, Gerard Mortier was General Director of La Monnaie. Bernard Foccroulle succeeded Mortier in 1991 and served for fifteen seasons, maintaining and even expanding the reputation Mortier had gained in the 1980s. The current General Director is Peter de Caluwe, who has been in the post since 2007, and is scheduled to conclude his tenure on 1 July 2025. In June 2023, the company announced the appointment of Christina Scheppelmann as its next General Director, effective 1 July 2025, with an initial contract of six years.

La Monnaie&#x27;s Music Directors have always played a major role in Belgium&#x27;s musical life, since the orchestra also performed in regularly organised concerts, and the quality of the orchestra reached a peak at the end of the 19th century under the baton of composer and musicologist Sylvain Dupuis. La Monnaie gave regular performances of the major works of Richard Wagner as well. During the late 19th century, important French composers such as Jules Massenet and Vincent d&#x27;Indy directed the world premieres of some of their operas at this theatre. The high musical quality of renditions was maintained under Corneil de Thoran between the two World Wars, but diminished gradually from the 1950s onwards.

At the beginning of the 1980s, Gérard Mortier hired Sylvain Cambreling as La Monnaie&#x27;s Music Director, and Cambreling restored the orchestra to its former playing level. From 1990, Bernd Loebe was Artistic Director. Antonio Pappano became Music Director in 1991, and during his tenure, the orchestra&#x27;s symphonic repertoire was further extended and it appeared more often in concerts outside the opera. In addition, Pappano made several recordings with the orchestra. He left in 2002 to become Music Director of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in London.

Beginning in 2002, Kazushi Ono served as Music Director. At the end of the 2007–2008 season, Ono was scheduled to relinquish his position as La Monnaie&#x27;s Music Director to Mark Wigglesworth, the two having worked together during that season. However, in April 2008, La Monnaie announced that Wigglesworth would not take up the position of Music Director, after reports of opposition to him from the orchestra. In June 2011, the company announced the appointment of Ludovic Morlot as its next Music Director, as of the 2012–2013 season, with an initial contract of five years. In December 2014, citing artistic differences, Morlot resigned from the La Monnaie&#x27;s music directorship, effective 31 December 2014. In September 2015, the company announced the appointment of Alain Altinoglu as its next Music Director, effective January 2016.

For performances of Baroque operas, La Monnaie mostly engages guest orchestras specialising in authentic performances on period instruments. Over the past decades, René Jacobs and his Concerto Vocale have been regular guests at the theatre.

==Dance at La Monnaie==
Dance and ballet always had their place on the stage of La Monnaie, and during a major part of its history, the theatre housed its own &quot;Corps de Ballet&quot;. Several members of the Petipa family left their mark in Brussels in the 19th century, but the enthusiasm of the public for traditional ballet performances diminished in the 1950s.

In 1959, director Maurice Huisman embarked on a cooperation with the young avant-garde choreographer Maurice Béjart. This resulted in the creation of the new Ballet of the 20th Century, which became the theatre&#x27;s new ballet company until 1987, when Béjart and his Ballet left La Monnaie after a conflict with Gerard Mortier. In 1988, Mortier hired the New York choreographer Mark Morris and his Mark Morris Dance Group. For three years, they were known as the Monnaie Dance Group Mark Morris. Morris directed several productions in Brussels until 1991. Under Bernard Foccroulle, Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker and her company Rosas became the dance company in residence.

Daldry joined a youth theatre group in Taunton, Somerset and performed as Sandy Tyrell in &quot;Hay Fever&quot; for the local amateur society, Taunton Thespians. At age 18, he won a Royal Air Force scholarship to read English at the University of Sheffield, where he became chairman of the Sheffield University Theatre Group.

After graduation, he spent a year travelling through Italy, where he became a clown&#x27;s apprentice. He then trained as an actor on the postgraduate course at East 15 Acting School from 1982 to 1983, now part of the University of Essex.

== Career ==
Daldry began his career as an apprentice at the Sheffield Crucible from 1985 to 1988, working under artistic director Clare Venables. He also headed productions at the Manchester Library Theatre, Liverpool Playhouse, Stratford East, Oxford Stage, Brighton and the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. He was Artistic Director of the Royal Court Theatre from 1992 to 1998, where he headed the £26 million development scheme. He was also Artistic Director of London&#x27;s Gate Theatre (1989–92) and the Metro Theatre Company (1984–86). He is currently on the Board of the Young and Old Vic Theatres and remains an Associate Director of the Royal Court Theatre. He was the Cameron Mackintosh Visiting Professor of Contemporary Theatre for 2002 at St Catherine&#x27;s College, Oxford.

Daldry made his feature film directorial debut with &quot;Billy Elliot&quot; (2000), which launched the film career of Jamie Bell. His next film was &quot;The Hours&quot;, which earned Nicole Kidman her first Best Actress win at the Academy Awards. He went on to direct a stage musical adaptation of &quot;Billy Elliot&quot;, and in 2009 his work earned him a Tony Award for Best Director of a Musical. He has also made a film version of &quot;The Reader&quot; (2008), based on the book of the same name and starring Kate Winslet, David Kross and Ralph Fiennes. The film won Best Actress at the Academy Awards for Kate Winslet. Daldry&#x27;s fourth film was &quot;Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close&quot;, an adaptation of the book of the same name written by Jonathan Safran Foer, starring Tom Hanks, Sandra Bullock, and Max von Sydow. The screenplay was written by Eric Roth. The film received a nomination for Best Picture at the 84th Academy Awards and a nomination for von Sydow for Best Supporting Actor.

Daldry was initially slated to direct a Star Wars spin off film about the iconic &quot;Star Wars&quot; character Obi-Wan Kenobi but the film was later scrapped due to the commercial failure of &quot;&quot; with Daldry saying the cancellation of the film crushed him and Hossein Amini. However, ideas from Daldry&#x27;s originally planned film were repurposed for the &quot;Obi-Wan Kenobi&quot; Disney + limited series directed by Deborah Chow and released in 2022 for which Daldry received credit as a consulting producer. In July 2022, it was revealed that Daldry would work with Sonia Friedman to develop a play based on the hit Netflix television show &quot;Stranger Things&quot;. The play entitled &quot;Stranger Things: The First Shadow&quot; premiered in December 2023 at the Phoenix Theatre in London&#x27;s West End.

== Personal life ==
Daldry was in a relationship with set designer Ian MacNeil for 13 years. They met at an outdoor production of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; in Lancaster in 1988 and, after settling in Camberwell, began collaborating on theatrical productions.

Greatly impacted by the September 11 attacks in the United States, Daldry decided he wanted to start a family and married American performance artist and magazine editor Lucy Sexton, with whom he has a daughter. Despite this, he continues to refer to himself as gay because the public &quot;[doesn&#x27;t] like confusion&quot; although he has also suggested that they married so he could get health insurance.

<text>A Dove prism is a type of reflective prism which is used to invert an image. Dove prisms are shaped from a truncated right-angle prism. The Dove prism is named for its inventor, Heinrich Wilhelm Dove. Although the shape of this prism is similar to the shape described by a dovetail joint, the etymology of the two is unrelated.

A beam of light travelling parallel to the longitudinal axis, entering one of the sloped faces of the prism, undergoes total internal reflection from the inside of the longest (bottom) face and emerges from the opposite sloped face. Images passing through the prism are flipped (mirrored), and because only one reflection takes place, the image is also inverted but not laterally transposed.

Refraction at the entrance and exit surfaces results in substantial image astigmatism when used in convergent light. Thus the Dove prism is used almost exclusively for images appearing at infinity.

If the flat hypotenuse surface of a Dove prism is cut into a roof shape, the result is an Amici roof prism.

== Rotation ==
A reflection in one axis of a plane is always equivalent to a reflection and rotation in two other axes (with the angle between the source and image being twice the angle between the source and reflection axis of the prism). Thus, Dove prisms can be used to create &quot;beam rotators&quot;, which have applications in fields such as interferometry, astronomy, and pattern recognition.

Lesso and Padgett (1999) and Moreno et al. (2003, 2004) found that there is a change in the state of polarization of a beam of light on passing through a rotated dove prism. Polarization rotation in the infrared has been known for much longer (Johnston 1977). The polarization-transforming properties of dove prisms are of particular interest because they can influence the signal measurement of the scientific instrument.

<doc id="533017" wikidata="Q1505757" url="?curid=533017" title="Horror vacui (art)">
<text>In visual art, ; ; ), or , is a phenomenon in which the entire surface of a space or an artwork is filled with detail and content, leaving as little perceived emptiness as possible. It relates to the antiquated physical idea, &quot;horror vacui&quot;, proposed by Aristotle who held that &quot;nature abhors an empty space&quot;.

==Origins==
Italian art critic and scholar Mario Praz used this term to describe the excessive use of ornament in design during the Victorian age. Other examples of horror vacui can be seen in the densely decorated carpet pages of Insular illuminated manuscripts, where intricate patterns and interwoven symbols may have served &quot;&quot;apotropaic&quot; as well as decorative functions.&quot; The interest in meticulously filling empty spaces is also reflected in Arabesque decoration in Islamic art from ancient times to present. The art historian Ernst Gombrich theorized that such highly ornamented patterns can function like a picture frame for sacred images and spaces. &quot;The richer the elements of the frame,&quot; Gombrich wrote, &quot;the more the centre will gain in dignity&quot;. 

Another example comes from ancient Greece during the Geometric Age (1100–900 BCE), when horror vacui was considered a stylistic element of all art. The mature work of the French Renaissance engraver Jean Duvet consistently exhibits horror vacui.

==Examples==
Horror vacui is apparent in some styles of postmodern graphic design, including the work of artists like David Carson or Vaughan Oliver, and in the underground comix movement in the work of S. Clay Wilson, Robert Crumb, Robert Williams, and later comic artists such as Mark Beyer. The paintings of Williams, Faris Badwan, Emerson Barrett, Joe Coleman and Todd Schorr are further examples of horror vacui in the modern Lowbrow art movement. 

The entheogen-inspired visionary art of certain indigenous peoples, such as the Huichol yarn paintings and the ayahuasca-inspired art of Pablo Amaringo, often exhibits this style, as does the psychedelic art movement of the 1960s counterculture. Sometimes the patterned art in the clothing of indigenous peoples of Middle and South America exhibits horror vacui. For example, the geometric molas of the Kuna people and the traditional clothing of the Shipibo-Conibo people.

The artwork in the Where&#x27;s Wally? series of children&#x27;s books is a commonly known example of horror vacui, as are many of the small books written or illustrated by the macabre imagination of Edward Gorey.

The Tingatinga painting style of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania is a contemporary example of horror vacui. Other African artists such as Malangatana of Mozambique also fill the canvas in this way.

The arrangement of Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs suggests an abhorrence of empty space. Signs were repeated or phonetic complements added to prevent gaps.

==In aesthetics==

There is a relationship between &quot;horror vacui&quot; and its inverse phenomenon, value perception. Commercial designers favor visual clarity in window displays and advertising in order to appeal to affluent and well-educated consumers, on the premise that understatement and restraint appeals to more affluent and educated audiences. 

In a study, clothing stores were surveyed to find patterns and relationship between how efficiently the store&#x27;s real estate was used and the store&#x27;s brand prestige; Bulk sales shops and chain stores were found to fill their window displays to maximum capacity, effectively exhibiting the principle of &quot;horror vacui&quot;, while high-end boutiques often used their space sparsely with no price tags. The assumption was that if passersby needed to know the price, they could not afford it.

<doc id="533020" wikidata="Q1303462" url="?curid=533020" title="Cardiac function curve">
<text>A cardiac function curve is a graph showing the relationship between right atrial pressure (x-axis) and cardiac output (y-axis). Superimposition of the cardiac function curve and venous return curve is used in one hemodynamic model.

== Shape of curve ==


It shows a steep relationship at relatively low filling pressures and a plateau, where further stretch is not possible and so increases in pressure have little effect on output. The pressures where there is a steep relationship lie within the normal range of right atrial pressure (RAP) found in the healthy human during life. This range is about -1 to +2 mmHg. The higher pressures normally occur only in disease, in conditions such as heart failure, where the heart is unable to pump forward all the blood returning to it and so the pressure builds up in the right atrium and the great veins. Swollen neck veins are often an indicator of this type of heart failure.

At low right atrial pressures this graph serves as a graphic demonstration of the Frank–Starling mechanism, that is as more blood is returned to the heart, more blood is pumped from it without extrinsic signals.

== Changes in the cardiac function curve ==
In vivo however, extrinsic factors such as an increase in activity of the sympathetic nerves, and a decrease in vagal tone cause the heart to beat more frequently and more forcefully. This alters the cardiac function curve, shifting it upwards. This allows the heart to cope with the required cardiac output at a relatively low right atrial pressure. We get what is known as a family of cardiac function curves, as the heart rate increases before the plateau is reached, and without the RAP having to rise dramatically to stretch the heart more and get the Starling effect.

In vivo sympathetic within the myocardium is probably best described by the time honored description of the sinoatrial tree branching out to Purkinges fibers. Parasympathetic inflow within the myocardium is probably best described by influence of the vagus nerve and spinal accessory ganglia.

<text>GURPS Cyberpunk is a genre toolkit for cyberpunk-themed role-playing games set in a near-future dystopia, such as that envisioned by William Gibson in his influential novel &quot;Neuromancer&quot;. It was published in 1990 after a significant delay caused by the original draft being a primary piece of evidence in &quot;Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service&quot;.

In 1993, &quot;GURPS Cyberpunk Adventures&quot; — a collection of three RPG scenarios in the &quot;GURPS Cyberpunk&quot; line — won the Origins Award for &quot;Best Roleplaying Adventure of 1992&quot;.

Unlike most commercially successful books from the third edition of the game, there is currently no Cyberpunk sourcebook for its fourth edition, as of 2024. Similar rules for advanced technology can be found in GURPS Ultra-Tech, from gadgets to cyberwear, but there aren&#x27;t, for example, rules for netrunning which are essential for such games.

==Contents==
Besides the main chapters detailed below, &quot;GURPS Cyberpunk&quot; contains a glossary of common cyberpunk terms, an index, and a bibliography of relevant media.

;Characters : This chapter describes some of the most common character archetypes (netrunner, corp(orate), cop, celebrity, etc.) and their typical skills, advantages, and disadvantages. It also provides a guideline about how much money a given job might bring or cost.
; Cyberwear : Rules for and descriptions of bionic enhancements.
; Technology &amp; Equipment : Lists many sorts of near-future gadgets.
; Netrunning : The longest in the book, it details rules for realistic computer networks as well as fantastic cyberspaces accessible only through a neural interface. It describes what types of system can be found in the &quot;Net&quot; and how the characters can act (and fight) there.
; World Design : Gives guidelines for designing your own cyberpunk world.
; Campaigning : Helps the Gamemaster in running a longer series of adventures.

==U.S. Secret Service seizure==

Loyd Blankenship, who was hired by Steve Jackson Games in 1989, was nearly finished with &quot;GURPS Cyberpunk&quot; later that year, which was intended both to introduce the company into the popular cyberpunk genre, and to help the company get over its financial difficulties.

&quot;GURPS Cyberpunk&quot; received notoriety when the Austin headquarters of Steve Jackson Games was raided by the U.S. Secret Service in 1990. The authorities seized the manuscript for the sourcebook, which was under development at the time, asserting that it was a &quot;handbook for computer crime&quot;. The book was reconstructed and rewritten from older drafts when the manuscript was not returned. The seizure delayed publication for six weeks. This raid is often wrongly attributed to Operation Sundevil, a nationwide crackdown on illegal computer hacking activities that was occurring about this time.

&quot;GURPS Cyberpunk&quot; was ultimately published in 1990, joining the already-released cyberpunk role-playing games &quot;Cyberpunk 2013&quot; (1988) from R. Talsorian, &quot;Cyberspace&quot; (1989) from ICE, and &quot;Shadowrun&quot; (1989) from FASA.

==Publication history==
The main sourcebook for the line () was written by Loyd Blankenship and published by Steve Jackson Games in 1990, as a part of the extensive (3rd-edition) &quot;GURPS&quot; generic role-playing game system.

==Reception==
The July 1990 edition of &quot;Games International&quot; (Issue 16) commented that &quot;computers interfaced with humans and piles of personal morality make playing cyberpunk a challenge.&quot; The reviewer concluded, &quot;Lovers of William Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Neuromancer&quot; should start here.&quot;

Stephan Wieck reviewed &quot;GURPS Cyberpunk&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #23 (Oct./Nov., 1990), rating it a 2 out of 5 and stated that &quot;I think &quot;GURPS Cyberpunk&quot; would have been an excellent game supplement if it had been 60 pages longer and filled with more material to help a gamemaster create his campaign world. As it is, it&#x27;s a nice introduction to the genre of cyberpunk, but the sourcebook doesn&#x27;t have enough information to support a game campaign.&quot;

==Awards==
At the 1991 Origins Awards, &quot;GURPS Cyberpunk&quot; was a nominee for Best Roleplaying Supplement of 1990.

<text>The Boulder River is a tributary of the Jefferson River in southwestern Montana in the United States.

It rises in the Rocky Mountains at the continental divide in the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest in western Jefferson County. It flows east and southeast through the mountains past Boulder, then south to join the Jefferson near Cardwell.

Game fish in the river include brook, brown, and rainbow trout, and mountain whitefish. Brown trout are most prevalent in the last , near the mouth, and the other three species are more prevalent in the reach upstream of the town of Boulder. The lowermost of the river is affected by irrigation withdrawals, and the reach below the community of Basin is affected by seepage from old mines and tailings.

<doc id="533041" wikidata="Q1263593" url="?curid=533041" title="Samson (Handel)">
<text>Samson (HWV 57) is a three-act oratorio from 1743 by George Frideric Handel, considered to be one of his finest dramatic works. It is usually performed as an oratorio in concert form, but on occasions has also been staged as an opera. The well-known arias &quot;Let the bright Seraphim&quot; (for soprano), &quot;Total eclipse&quot; (for tenor) and &quot;Let their celestial concerts&quot; (the final chorus) are often performed separately in concert.

==Composition==
Handel began the composition of &quot;Samson&quot; immediately after completing &quot;Messiah&quot; on 14 September 1741. It used a libretto by Newburgh Hamilton, based on Milton&#x27;s &quot;Samson Agonistes&quot;, which in turn was based on the figure Samson in Chapter 16 of the Book of Judges. Handel completed the first act on 20 September 1741, the second act on 11 October that year, and the whole work on 29 October. Shortly after that he travelled to Dublin to premiere &quot;Messiah&quot;, returning to London at the end of August 1742 and thoroughly revising &quot;Samson&quot;.

The premiere was given at Covent Garden in London on 18 February 1743. The incidental organ music probably came from his recently completed concerto in A major (HWV 307). The oratorio was a great success, leading to a total of seven performances in its first season, the most in a single season of any of his oratorios. &quot;Samson&quot; retained its popularity throughout Handel&#x27;s lifetime and has never fallen entirely out of favor.

==Premiere cast==

==Synopsis==

Samson, Judge of Israel, married a Philistine woman, Delilah, who discovered that he derived his supernatural strength from never cutting his hair. Delilah shaved his hair while he was sleeping and betrayed him to her people, the Philistines, enemy of the Israelites. The Philistines captured Samson and put his eyes out. The scene was set in front of the prison in Gaza. Since it was a festival day in honour of the Philistine god Dagon Samson was allowed to come out of his prison cell, albeit in chains, and received visitors.

===Act 1===

The Philistines celebrate the festival in honour of their god as Samson, blind and in chains, bewails his fate.
Samson&#x27;s friend Micah, allowed to visit on this special day, is appalled by how low their once invincible hero has fallen, seeing Samson&#x27;s humiliation as a symbol of Israel&#x27;s defeat, but Samson insists it is all his own fault for having been unable to keep the secret of his magical strength from the woman who betrayed him. Samson bitterly laments his loss of sight.

Samson&#x27;s father Manoah finds Samson and is shocked by his transformation. Samson longs for death but is comforted by the Chorus of the Israelites that he will triumph over death and time.

===Act 2===
Micah and the Israelites implore divine assistance as Samson still wishes to die. Delilah, with a group of young women, appears and tells Samson she is sorry for what she did and that she did not realise how serious the consequences would be. She attempts to convince him that she still loves him, but he angrily repudiates her.

The Philistine Harapha comes to insult Samson, who challenges him to a duel. Harapha, however, reviles Samson, claiming it is beneath his dignity to fight with a blind man. Samson mocks him as a braggart. Micah proposes to measure the power of Dagon against that of the God of the Israelites. The Israelite and Philistine choruses both praise their God.

===Act 3===
Harapha arrives to take Samson to the feast of the Philistines and show him off there. Samson at first refuses to be present at the worship of Dagon, but then thinks of a plan and agrees to go to the festival, though he warns the Israelites to stay away from it.

Manoah arrives with plans for the children of Israel, including how to free Samson. From a distance the songs of the Philistines are heard, calling on Dagon. Suddenly these sounds turn to noise and panic.

An Israelite messenger arrives and tells the Israelites what has happened: Samson pulled down the building on himself and the Philistines. Samson&#x27;s dead body is brought out to a funeral march and the children of Israel lament his death. The work ends on a note of thanksgiving as the Israelites praise their God.

==Background==
The German-born Handel was resident in London since 1712 where he enjoyed great success as a composer of Italian operas. His opportunities to set English texts to music were more limited. He spent the years 1717 to 1719 as composer in residence to the wealthy Duke of Chandos, where he wrote church anthems and two stage works, &quot;Acis and Galatea&quot; and &quot;Esther&quot;. He composed vocal music to English words for various royal occasions, including a set of Coronation anthems for George II in 1727, which made a huge impact. In 1731, a performance of the 1718 version of &quot;Esther&quot;, a work in English based on a Biblical drama by Jean Racine, was given in London without Handel&#x27;s participation and proved to be popular. He thus revised the work and planned to present it at the theatre where his Italian operas were being presented. However, the Bishop of London would not permit a drama based on a Biblical story to be acted out on the stage; Handel therefore presented &quot;Esther&quot; in concert form, thus giving birth to the English oratorio.

&quot;Esther&quot; in its revised form proved to be a popular work, and Handel, though still continuing to focus on composing Italian operas, followed up with two more sacred dramas with English words presented in concert form, &quot;Deborah&quot;, and &quot;Athalia&quot; (which, like &quot;Esther&quot;, was also based on a Biblical drama by Racine), both in 1733.
Such was the success of his oratorios in English that Handel eventually abandoned Italian opera, with his last being Deidamia in 1741 and a string of masterpieces of oratorio in English.

==Musical features==

&quot;Samson&quot; is richly orchestrated by the standards of its day, calling for strings, two oboes, two bassoons, two horns, two flutes, two trumpets, timpani and continuo instruments.
Handel&#x27;s characterisation through music is evidenced throughout the work, not only in the music for soloists such as Delilah&#x27;s would-be seductive aria with alluring violins or in the swagger of Harapha&#x27;s music, but also in the choruses, with the solemn gravity of the Israelites&#x27; music sharply contrasted with the hedonistic carefree choruses with added horns for the Philistines.

<doc id="533042" wikidata="Q6978274" url="?curid=533042" title="National Science Education Standards">
<text>The National Science Education Standards (NSES) represent guidelines for the science education in primary and secondary schools in the United States, as established by the National Research Council in 1996. These provide a set of goals for teachers to set for their students and for administrators to provide professional development. The NSES influence various states&#x27; own science learning standards (such as the Massachusetts Frameworks), and statewide standardized testing.

==Education Reform==

The science standards is only one of a number of reforms organized around the principles of outcomes-based education. The mathematics counterpart are the controversial NCTM standards, which also de-emphasize knowledge of disconnected facts and content in favor of context-dependent critical thinking skills and process. Progressive education seeks to reform traditional education, taking into account current understandings of human learning.

==Vision==

The content of these standards is based heavily on a specific model of learning, constructivism (learning theory). Like reform mathematics, which is distinguished by an emphasis on building on what a child already knows and understands, the standards intend to update the methods of science education to achieve greater effectiveness with children. The goals of the standards include:

* An outline of what students need to know, understand, and be able to do
* Targets for scientific literacy at different grade levels
* All students demonstrate high levels of performance
* Teachers are empowered to make the decisions essential for effective learning
* Communities of teachers and students are focused on learning science
* Educational programs and systems nurture achievement

The intended purpose of the standards is to define teaching methods which apply to all students, regardless of age, gender, cultural or ethnic background, disabilities, aspirations, or interest and motivation in science, recognizing that different students will achieve understanding in different ways, and some students will achieve different degrees of depth and breadth of understanding depending on interest, ability, and context. However, the standards
expect that all students can develop the knowledge and skills described in the standards.

The goal of scientific literacy includes inquiry, history and nature of science, personal and social perspectives of science, science, and technology, in addition to the science domains of life science, physical science, and earth and space science. Programs defined according to these standards should be developmentally appropriate, interesting, and relevant to students’ lives.

==Organization of the Standards==
The NSES are organized into six categories:

* Standards for science teaching, 
* Standards for professional development for teachers of science
* Standards for assessment in science education
* Standards for science content
* Standards for science education programs
* Standards for science education systems

==Critics==

Many critics of standards-based education reform and reform mathematics are also critical of the emphasis of the standards on process and inquiry-based science rather than learning of facts. Science assessments such as WASL in Washington state contain very little factual content, and most assessment is based on the ability of students as young as the fifth grade to construct and interpret science experiments. By contrast, previous generations of high school and even college students were only expected to participate in, rather than design science experiments from scratch, complete with a list of materials. The principles of the standards are similar to controversial approaches taken to mathematics and language arts which de-emphasize basic skills traditionally taught in elementary school as being inappropriate to the ability level of some students. Yet content and skills that were traditionally taught at the college level, requiring &quot;higher order&quot; and &quot;critical thinking&quot; are brought down to K-12 to &quot;raise standards&quot;.

<text>Gormley () is an Irish surname. It is derived from the Gaelic &quot;Ó Goirmleadhaigh&quot; meaning &#x27;descendant of Gormghal&#x27;. The main sept of the clan originated in Tyrconnell (present day County Donegal) and then spread into Tyrone. The Ulster branch of the clan were chiefs of the &quot;Cenél Moain&quot; and originated in what is now the barony of Raphoe in East Donegal, an area known in Gaelic times as &quot;Tír Moain&quot;. The common ancestor and progenitor of these Gormleys was Moain son of Muireadach, son of Eoghan, son of Niall of the Nine Hostages.

==Different septs and spellings==
In the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; and in the &quot;Topographical Poems&quot; of O&#x27;Dugan and O&#x27;Heerin, the name is spelt &quot;Ó Goirmleadhaigh&quot;; the &quot;Annals of Loch Cé&quot; write it &quot;Ó Gormshuil&quot; and &quot;Ó Gormshuiligh&quot;: the editor (William Hennessy) writing in 1871 states that the latter was then anglicised O&#x27;Gormooly, but Gormley is universal today. The name means “blue spearman”.

In the Partry Mountains of County Mayo in the West of Ireland is found a sept also called Gormley, Gormaly and Gormilly. The Irish form of this family&#x27;s name is &quot;Ó Goirmghialla&quot; or possibly &quot;Ó Gormghaille&quot;, both Irish forms meaning “blue hostage”. They were chiefs of this area along with the Darcy or Dorcey family. The present parish of Ballyovey, also called the parish of Party, shows the location of this ancient territory in Mayo. In the area of Lough Key, County Roscommon, we find families of the name (O&#x27;) Gormaly or Gormally. O&#x27;Donovan says that these are quite distinct from the O&#x27;Gormleys of County Tyrone and that the Irish form of this name is &quot;Ó Garmghaile&quot;. It is likely that this family is of the same stock as the Mayo sept, but it is unclear if both are related to the main sept of Ulster.

In seventeenth century records they are found both as O&#x27;Gormley and Mac Gormley, located chiefly in counties Armagh and Londonderry in modern-day Northern Ireland, but also in County Roscommon and County Westmeath, Republic of Ireland. Gormleys today are chiefly found in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, and surrounding areas.

<doc id="533046" wikidata="Q366355" url="?curid=533046" title="Van Cliburn">
<text>Harvey Lavan &quot;Van&quot; Cliburn Jr. (; July 12, 1934February 27, 2013) was an American pianist. At the age of 23, Cliburn achieved worldwide recognition when he won the inaugural International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow in 1958 during the Cold War.

Cliburn&#x27;s mother, a piano teacher and an accomplished pianist in her own right, discovered him playing at age three, mimicking one of her students, and arranged for him to start taking lessons. Cliburn developed a rich, round tone and a singing-voice-like phrasing, having been taught from the start to sing each piece. Cliburn toured domestically and overseas. He played for royalty, heads of state, and every US president from Harry S. Truman to Barack Obama.

==Early life==
Harvey Lavan Cliburn Jr. was born in Shreveport, Louisiana, the son of Rildia Bee (&quot;née&quot; O&#x27;Bryan) and Harvey Lavan Cliburn Sr. When he was three, he began taking piano lessons from his mother, who had studied under Arthur Friedheim, a pupil of Franz Liszt. When Cliburn was six, his father, who worked in the oil industry, moved the family to Kilgore, Texas.

At 12, Cliburn won a statewide piano competition, which led to his debut with the Houston Symphony Orchestra. He entered the Juilliard School in New York City at 17 and studied under Rosina Lhévinne, who trained him in the tradition of the great Russian romantics. In 1952, Cliburn won the International Chopin Competition at the Kosciuszko Foundation in New York City. At 20, Cliburn won the Leventritt Award and made his debut at Carnegie Hall.

==Career==
===International competition in Moscow===

The first International Tchaikovsky Competition in 1958 was an event designed to demonstrate Soviet cultural superiority during the Cold War after the USSR&#x27;s technological victory with the Sputnik launch in October 1957. Cliburn&#x27;s performance at the competition finale of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 1 and Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 3 on April 13 earned him a standing ovation lasting eight minutes. After the ovation, Van Cliburn made a brief speech in Russian and then resumed his seat at the piano and began to play—to the surprise and delight of the Russian musicians visible behind him in the film made of his part in the competition—his own piano arrangement of the much-beloved song &quot;Moscow Nights&quot;, which further endeared him to the Russians. When it was time to announce the winner, the judges felt obliged to ask permission of the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev to give the first prize to an American. &quot;Is he the best?&quot; Khrushchev asked. &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;Then give him the prize!&quot; Cliburn was to maintain a lasting relationship with the Soviet leader. Cliburn returned home to a ticker-tape parade in New York City, the only time the honor has been accorded a classical musician. Arriving at City Hall after the parade, Cliburn told the audience:I appreciate more than you will ever know that you are honoring me, but the thing that thrills me the most is that you are honoring classical music. Because I&#x27;m only one of many. I&#x27;m only a witness and a messenger. Because I believe so much in the beauty, the construction, the architecture invisible, the importance for all generations, for young people to come that it will help their minds, develop their attitudes, and give them values. That is why I&#x27;m so grateful that you have honored me in that spirit.A cover story in &quot;Time&quot; magazine proclaimed him &quot;The Texan Who Conquered Russia&quot;. His triumph in Moscow propelled Cliburn to international prominence.

===Success===
Upon returning to the United States, Cliburn appeared in a Carnegie Hall concert with the Symphony of the Air, conducted by Kirill Kondrashin, who had led the Moscow Philharmonic in the prize-winning performances in Moscow. The performance of the Rachmaninoff 3rd Piano Concerto at this concert was subsequently released by RCA Victor on LP. Cliburn was also invited by Steve Allen to play a solo during Allen&#x27;s prime time NBC television series on May 25, 1958. He later went to the White House to meet with President Eisenhower to discuss relations with the USSR.

RCA Victor signed him to an exclusive contract, and his subsequent recording, &quot;Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 1&quot; was at the No. 1 position on the Billboard Top 200 albums for much of August and September 1958. And the album won the 1958 Grammy Award for Best Classical Performance. It was certified a gold record in 1961, and it became the first classical album to go platinum, achieving that certification in 1989. It was the best-selling classical album in the world for more than a decade. It eventually went triple-platinum. In 2004, this recording was re-mastered from the original studio analogue tapes, and released on a Super Audio CD.

Other standard repertoire Cliburn recorded include the Brahms Piano Concerto No. 2, Schumann Piano Concerto in A minor, Grieg Piano Concerto in A minor, Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto No. 2, Beethoven Piano Concerto No. 4 and No. 5 &quot;Emperor&quot;, and the Prokofiev Piano Concerto No. 3.

In 1958, during a dinner hosted by the National Guild of Piano Teachers, President and Founder Dr. Irl Allison announced a cash prize of $10,000 to be used for a piano competition named in Cliburn&#x27;s honor. Under the leadership of Grace Ward Lankford and with the dedicated efforts of local music teachers and volunteers, the first Van Cliburn International Piano Competition was held from September 24 to October 7, 1962, at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth. Until his death, Cliburn continued to serve as Director Emeritus for the Van Cliburn Foundation, as host of the quadrennial competition and host of other programs honoring his legacy.

In 1961, he first performed at the Interlochen Center for the Arts during its summer camp. He went on to do so for eighteen more years, his last visit to the school being in 2006.

Cliburn returned to the Soviet Union on several occasions. His performances there were usually recorded and even televised. In a 1962 Moscow appearance, Nikita Khrushchev, who met Cliburn again on this visit, and Andrei Gromyko, the Soviet Foreign Minister, were &quot;spotted in the audience applauding enthusiastically&quot;. According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;Mr. Cliburn&#x27;s affection for the Soviet people—and theirs for him—was notable in its warmth during a prolonged period of superpower strain.&quot; A 1972 concert performance of the Brahms Piano Concerto No. 2 with Kondrashin and the Moscow orchestra, as well as a studio recording of Rachmaninoff&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini&quot;, were later issued on CD by RCA Victor.

On May 26, 1972, Cliburn gave a concert at Spaso House, the residence of the United States Ambassador to Russia, for an audience that included President Richard Nixon, Secretary of State William P. Rogers, and Soviet government officials.

===Comeback===
Cliburn performed and recorded through the 1970s, but in 1978, after the deaths of his father and of his manager, Sol Hurok, he began a hiatus from public life. In 1987, he was invited to perform at the White House for President Ronald Reagan and Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev and afterward was invited to open the 100th anniversary season of Carnegie Hall. He embarked on a 16-city tour in 1994, commencing with a performance of the Tchaikovsky concerto at the Hollywood Bowl. That same year Cliburn performed the National Anthem along with the Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra at the First Official Opening Day at Choctaw Stadium. Also in 1994, Cliburn made a guest appearance in the cartoon &quot;Iron Man&quot;, playing himself in the episode &quot;Silence My Companion, Death My Destination&quot;. In his late seventies, he gave a limited number of performances to critical and popular acclaim. Cliburn appeared as a &quot;Pennington Great Performers&quot; series artist with the Baton Rouge Symphony Orchestra in 2006. In 2006, he performed at Interlochen Center for the Arts, spending two hours talking to the students afterwards and signing their programs while many waited at a reception at the school&#x27;s president&#x27;s house.

He played for royalty and heads of state from dozens of countries and for every U.S. president from 1958 until his death.

==Honors==
Cliburn received the Kennedy Center Honors on December 2, 2001. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom on July 23, 2003, by President George W. Bush, and, on September 20, 2004, the Russian Order of Friendship, the highest civilian awards of the two countries. He was also awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award the same year and played at a surprise 50th birthday party for United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. He was a member of the Alpha Chi chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, and was awarded the fraternity&#x27;s Charles E. Lutton Man of Music Award in 1962. He was presented a 2010 National Medal of Arts by President Barack Obama on March 2, 2011.

Cliburn&#x27;s 1958 piano performance in Moscow, when he won the prestigious Tchaikovsky International Piano Competition, has been added to the National Recording Registry in the Library of Congress for long-term preservation.

==Personal life==
In 1996, Cliburn was named in a lawsuit by his domestic partner of 17 years, mortician Thomas Zaremba. In the suit, Zaremba claimed entitlement to a portion of Cliburn&#x27;s income and assets and asserted that he might have been exposed to HIV, causing emotional distress. Cliburn denied the allegations, with his attorney, Dee Kelly, stating that &quot;Van Cliburn categorically denies the charges.&quot; Cliburn&#x27;s defense team further maintained that the claims were not only false, but that they amounted to extortion. Zaremba&#x27;s attorney, Mike McCurley, acknowledged that Zaremba did not have AIDS and further admitted that &quot;he had no reason to believe that Cliburn has HIV.&quot; The claims were dismissed by a trial court and rejected by an appellate court, on the basis that palimony suits were not permitted in the state of Texas unless the relationship is based on a written agreement.

Cliburn was known as a night owl. He often practiced the piano until 4:30 or 5:00 am, then slept until around 1:30 pm. &quot;You feel like you&#x27;re alone and the world&#x27;s asleep, and it&#x27;s very inspiring.&quot;

== Death ==
On August 27, 2012, Cliburn&#x27;s publicist announced that the pianist had advanced bone cancer, had undergone treatment and was &quot;resting comfortably at home&quot; in Fort Worth, where he received around-the-clock care. Cliburn died on February 27, 2013, at the age of 78.

Cliburn was a member of Broadway Baptist Church in Fort Worth and attended regularly when he was in town. His services were held on March 3, 2013, at the Broadway Baptist Church, with entombment at Greenwood Memorial Park Mausoleum in Fort Worth. His obituary lists as his only survivor his &quot;friend of longstanding&quot;, Thomas L. Smith.

== Legacy ==
&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; said on his death that Cliburn was a &quot;cultural hero&quot; who &quot;rocketed to unheard-of stardom for a classical musician in the U.S.&quot; Calling him &quot;the rare classical musician to enjoy rock star status&quot;, the Associated Press on his death noted the 1958 &quot;Time&quot; cover story that likened him to &quot;Horowitz, Liberace, and Presley all rolled into one&quot;.

A year after Cliburn&#x27;s death, a free anniversary concert was held on February 27, 2014, in his honor in downtown Fort Worth. &quot;It&#x27;s part of the Cliburn ideology of sharing the music with the larger audience&quot;, said Jacques Marquis, the Cliburn Foundation president.

A highlight of Cliburn&#x27;s legacy was the profoundly positive reception of his person and performances in the Soviet Union during and after the Tchaikovsky competition. The same is true of his reception during and after the Cold War in the Soviet Union. According to &quot;Life&quot; (1958), the excitement and hype surrounding the news of Cliburn&#x27;s debut in Moscow was almost too much to bear for some. They became infatuated with him and made no attempt to conceal it. &quot;In the preliminaries, which had enlisted 50 young pianists from 19 different countries, Van was the big crowd-pleaser. Fans called him Vanyusha. Girls trailed him to the hotel. Soviet record companies pleaded with him to wax anything. In the finals, when he crashed out the last chords of the Rachmaninoff Third Concerto, the ecstatic audience in Moscow chanted &#x27;first prize—first prize&#x27;.&quot;

Mark MacNamara of the &quot;San Francisco Classical Voice&quot; wrote: &quot;The 6-foot 4-inch aw-shucks kid from Shreveport was 23, the son of an oil executive and a Juilliard graduate, and by all accounts didn&#x27;t have a mean bone in his body. Indeed, much of his charm, then and throughout his life, was that he seemed so genuinely unaware of intrigue and enmity. Cliburn&#x27;s talents were astounding, and he had a heart that loved people and music. This is a legacy that lasts.&quot;

As of the last International Tchaikovsky Competition (2023), Van Cliburn is still the only American to win the competition in piano. Three Americans have won the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition in its 58-year history.

===Lasting impact===
Cliburn&#x27;s contributions to society were many and one of his greatest contributions was the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition.
Lisa McCormick, writing in &quot;Sage Journals&quot; (2009), explains the competition this way:
Founded in 1958, the Cliburn is held every four years and is open to pianists between the ages of 18 and 30. Through screening auditions held in five cities around the world, 35 pianists are chosen to participate in the competition in Fort Worth, Texas, where their performances are open to the public and judged by a distinguished international jury. Since its third cycle, the Cliburn has qualified to be a member of the World Federation of International Music Competitions. (Sage Journals 2009)

For many young pianists, Cliburn is not only a symbol of talent and inspiration, but a friend to the arts that shows how appreciation for music is powerful, and his impact on the tensions of the Cold War was certainly one of distinct and unique merit.

<text>FreeSBIE is a live CD, an operating system that is able to load directly from a bootable CD with no installation process or hard disk. It is based on the FreeBSD operating system. Its name is a pun on frisbee. Currently, FreeSBIE uses Xfce and Fluxbox.

FreeSBIE 1.0 was based on FreeBSD 5.2.1 and released on February 27, 2004. The first version of FreeSBIE 2 was developed during the summer of 2005, thanks to the Google Summer of Code. FreeSBIE 2.0.1, which is a complete rewrite of the so-called toolkit, is based on FreeBSD 6.2 and was released on February 10, 2007. According to DistroWatch the FreeSBIE project is discontinued.

== Goals ==
The goals of the FreeSBIE project are:
*To develop a suite of programs to be used to create one&#x27;s own CD, with all the personalizations desired
*To make various ISO images available, each with its different goals and possible uses

<text>Isagoras (), son of Tisander, was an Athenian aristocrat in the late 6th century BC.

He had remained in Athens during the tyranny of Hippias, but after Hippias was overthrown, he became involved in a struggle for power with Cleisthenes, a fellow aristocrat. In 508 BC he was elected archon eponymous, but Cleisthenes opposed him, with support from the majority of the population. Isagoras requested support from the Spartan king Cleomenes I, an old friend who had earlier been given hospitality by Isagoras. According to Herodotus, Cleomenes had had an affair with Isagoras&#x27; wife.

In 507 BCE, Isagoras, with Cleomenes&#x27; help, expelled Cleisthenes and other members of the Alcmaeonidae family on pretext of the Alcmaeonidaean stain (see Megacles). Cleisthenes&#x27; supporters and the ordinary Athenian citizens revolted against Isagoras&#x27; tyranny, and ended up trapping Isagoras and his Spartan allies on the Acropolis for two days. On the third day they made a truce, allowed Cleomenes and Isagoras to escape, and executed 300 of Isagoras&#x27; supporters. Cleisthenes then returned to the city and implemented reforms that created Athenian democracy.

<doc id="533061" wikidata="Q3538690" url="?curid=533061" title="Emerald Triangle">
<text>The Emerald Triangle is a region in Northern California that derives its name from being the largest cannabis-producing region in the United States. The region includes three counties in an upside-down triangular configuration: 
*Humboldt County, on the coast
*Trinity County, inland
*Mendocino County, to the south

Growers have been cultivating &quot;Cannabis&quot; plants in this region since the 1960s, during San Francisco&#x27;s Summer of Love. Growing cannabis in the Emerald Triangle is considered a way of life, and the locals believe that everyone living in this region is either directly or indirectly reliant on the cannabis industry. The industry exploded in the region with the passage of California Proposition 215 (1996), which legalized the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes in California. The passage of Proposition 64 in 2016 legalized the general sale and distribution of cannabis.

==History==

When growing cannabis was illegal, this area was attractive due to its remoteness and limited law enforcement capabilities. The area has developed a reputation for cannabis with exceptionally good flavor and cannabinoid profiles.

In 1984, Humboldt residents filed a federal lawsuit claiming they had been subject to illegal surveillance by U-2 high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft deployed by the California-based multiagency task force started the year prior, the Campaign Against Marijuana Planting.

As of 2023, Humboldt County has the largest cannabis farming industry in the Emerald Triangle. While the largest legal pot farm in the county was , a 2021 survey found the median pot farm size to be .

==Population==
The total population in the Emerald Triangle is 236,250 according to the 2010 census. The majority of the population is widely spread throughout the woody hills and mountains that make up the area. With an area of 11,138 square miles, the Emerald Triangle population density is 21/mi2.

In this sparsely populated region, the largest urban area is the city of Eureka in Humboldt County with a population approaching 27,000 people. The second and third largest cities, by far larger than any other cities in the region, are Arcata (also in Humboldt), with 17,231 people, and Ukiah (in Mendocino), with 16,075 people.

==Environmental concerns==

There is an environmental impact from outdoor cannabis production in the Emerald Triangle, which is largely unregulated. These effects include illegal damming, diversion and taking of water from streams (especially during summer), and also pesticide-laden runoff into streams, all of which may degrade critical salmon fisheries. Clearcutting and roadbuilding for the cannabis plantations can also degrade the environment and endanger salmon. The grows often occur illegally on public land.

==In popular culture==
The Lookouts, founded in 1985 by Larry Livermore, who also founded Lookout! Records, were Tré Cool&#x27;s first band. The punk rock band was named for the fire lookout at Iron Peak in Mendocino County, which led local marijuana growers to threaten to burn down Livermore&#x27;s house for bringing too much publicity to their hilly isolated region of the Emerald Triangle near Spyrock. The band wrote many songs about the surrounding area on Mendocino Homeland and Spy Rock Road, an album named for the road lined with marijuana grows that leads to Iron Peak. Livermore also wrote &quot;Spy Rock Memories&quot;, a 2013 book about his time living off the grid in the heart of the Emerald Triangle.

&quot;Homegrown&quot; is a 1998 movie starring Billy Bob Thornton that follows marijuana growers in an unspecific area of the Emerald Triangle, most likely northern Mendocino County.

On the TV show &quot;Lost&quot;, during flashback scenes in the episode &quot;Further Instructions&quot;, John Locke picks up a hitchhiker who happens to be an undercover police officer on State Route 36 and brings him back to a farm near Bridgeville, where they grow marijuana in a greenhouse.

&quot;Humboldt County&quot; is a 2008 comedy-drama about a medical school dropout who drives north to Humboldt County to live on a pot farm.

In &quot;Object Impermanence&quot;, an episode of Showtime&#x27;s &quot;Weeds&quot;, Nancy Botwin drives to Heylia James&#x27; boobytrapped outdoor marijuana grow in Humboldt County.

Discovery Channel&#x27;s &quot;Pot Cops&quot;, a 2013 docuseries, followed the Humboldt County Sheriff&#x27;s Office&#x27;s Marijuana Enforcement Team in 2013.

The 2013 book &quot;&quot; by Emily Brady, is written about the marijuana industry in Humboldt County and the surrounding Emerald Triangle.

&quot;Welcome to Willits&quot; is a 2016 horror movie which takes place in the Emerald Triangle.

Amazon Prime&#x27;s &quot;Budding Prospects&quot; was a 2017 pilot episode for a series based on the 1984 novel of the same name by T. C. Boyle that was set in Mendocino County in the 1980s. Amazon released the pilot but did not greenlight the series.

Two other nationally distributed paperback books written about marijuana cultivation in the Emerald Triangle include Steve Chapple&#x27;s 1984 book &quot;Outlaws in Babylon: Shocking True Stories on the Marijuana Frontier&quot; and Ray Raphael&#x27;s 1985 book &quot;Cash Crop: An American Dream&quot;. 

Netflix&#x27;s 2018 true crime television series &quot;Murder Mountain&quot; examines the high rate of missing people and murders in Humboldt County. The show covers the history of illegal marijuana farming including the relationship of local farmers and local authorities as the area attempts to transition into a legal cannabis industry.

The 2020 film &quot;Freeland&quot; is about a longtime Humboldt County marijuana grower, played by Krisha Fairchild, growing illegally despite the availability of the legal market. 

The 2021 documentary &quot;Lady Buds&quot;, produced by Gravitas Ventures, about women who work in the marijuana industry in Northern California, is being developed into a scripted comedy feature film and a non-scripted series.

Hulu&#x27;s 2021 docuseries &quot;Sasquatch&quot; is based on the murder of pot growers in Mendocino County in the 1990s, purportedly perpetrated by Bigfoot.

The 2021 crime podcast &quot;Dark Woods&quot;, produced by Dick Wolf and set in Humboldt County that includes a trespass marijuana grow on public land, is currently being developed by Universal Television for a TV adaptation.

<text>Sequoyah ( ; , , or , , ; 1770 – August 1843), also known as George Gist or George Guess, was a Native American polymath and neographer of the Cherokee Nation. 

In 1821, Sequoyah completed his Cherokee syllabary, enabling reading and writing in the Cherokee language. One of the first North American Indigenous groups to gain a written language, the Cherokee Nation officially adopted the syllabary in 1825, helping to unify a forcibly divided nation with new ways of communication and a sense of independence. Within a quarter-century, the Cherokee Nation had reached a literacy rate of almost 100%, surpassing that of surrounding European-American settlers.

Sequoyah&#x27;s creation of the Cherokee syllabary is among the few times in recorded history that an individual member of a pre-literate group created an original, effective writing system. It is believed to have inspired the development of 21 scripts or writing systems used in 65 languages in North America, Africa, and Asia.

Sequoyah was also an important representative for the Cherokee nation; he went to Washington, D.C., to sign two relocation-and-land-trading treaties.

==Early life==
Few primary documents describe facts of Sequoyah&#x27;s life. Some anecdotes were passed down orally, but these often conflict or are vague about specific times and places. 

Sequoyah was born in the Cherokee town of Tuskegee, Tennessee, around 1778. James Mooney, a prominent anthropologist and historian of the Cherokee people, quoted a cousin as saying that as a little boy, Sequoyah spent his early years with his mother. In the people&#x27;s matrilineal kinship system, children were considered born into their mother&#x27;s family and clan, and her male relatives were most important to their upbringing. His name is believed to come from the Cherokee word meaning &quot;hog&quot;. Historian John B. Davis says the name may have been derived from (either a hog or an opossum) and meaning &quot;place, enclosure&quot;. This is a reference either to his childhood deformity or to a later injury that left Sequoyah disabled. According to a descendant of his, he was born with the name &quot;&quot; (&quot;there&#x27;s a bird inside&quot;). After repeatedly failing to complete his farm duties, his name was changed to Sequoyah (&quot;There&#x27;s a pig inside&quot;).

His mother, Wut-teh, is debated to be either the daughter, sister, or niece of a Cherokee chief. Historians believe her to be related to the chiefs who have been identified as the brothers Old Tassel and Doublehead. John Watts (also known as Young Tassel) was a nephew of the two chiefs, so it is likely that Wut-teh and Watts were related in some fashion. Due to native customs, Sequoyah learned everything from his mother, such as the Cherokee language and his first job of a tradesman.

Sources differ as to the identity of Sequoyah&#x27;s father. Davis cites Emmet Starr&#x27;s 1917 book, &quot;Early History of the Cherokees&quot;, as saying that Sequoyah&#x27;s father was a Virginian fur trader from Swabia named Nathaniel Guyst, Guist, or Gist. Other sources state that his father could have been an unlicensed German peddler named George Gist, who entered the Cherokee Nation in 1768, married, and fathered a child. Another source identified his father as Nathaniel Gist, son of Christopher Gist, who became a commissioned officer with the Continental Army associated with George Washington during the American Revolution. Gist would have been a man of some social status and financial backing; Josiah C. Nott claimed he was the &quot;son of a Scotchman&quot;. The &quot;Cherokee Phoenix&quot; reported in 1828 that Sequoyah&#x27;s father was a half-blood and his grandfather a white man.

The &quot;New Georgia Encyclopedia&quot; presents another version of Sequoyah&#x27;s origins, from the history &quot;Tell Them They Lie: The Sequoyah Myth&quot; (1971), by Traveller Bird, who claims to be a Sequoyah descendant. Bird says that Sequoyah was a full-blood Cherokee who always opposed the submission and assimilation of his people into the white man&#x27;s culture. The encyclopedia noted that Bird presented no documentary evidence of his assertions, but his account has gained some credibility in academic circles.

In any case, the father was absent before Sequoyah was born. Various explanations have been proposed, but the reason is unknown. Wuh-teh did not marry afterward. Sequoyah had no siblings, and his mother raised him alone. According to Davis, Sequoyah never went to school and never learned English. He and Wuh-teh spoke only Cherokee. As a youth, he spent much of his time tending cattle and working in their garden, while his mother ran a trading post.

Sequoyah became lame early in life; how, when, and where are not known. Some reports indicate this may have been caused by injury in battle; others say the cause was a hunting accident. Davis wrote that an early issue of the &quot;Cherokee Advocate&quot; said he &quot;was the victim of a hydrarthritic trouble of the knee joint, commonly called &#x27;white swelling&#x27;.&quot; One doctor speculated that he had &quot;anascara [&quot;sic&quot;]&quot;. In any case, lameness prevented him from being a successful farmer or warrior.

Despite his lack of schooling, Sequoyah displayed much natural intelligence. As a child, he had devised and built milk troughs and skimmers for the dairy house that he had constructed. As he grew older and came in contact with more white men, he learned how to make jewelry. He became a noted silversmith, creating various items from the silver coins that trappers and traders carried. He never signed his pieces, so there are none that can be positively identified as his work.

Sequoyah may have taken over his mother&#x27;s trading post after her death, which Davis claimed occurred about the end of the 18th century. His store became an informal meeting place for Cherokee men to socialize and, especially, drink whiskey. Sequoyah developed a great fondness for alcohol and soon spent much of his time drunk. After a few months, he was rarely seen sober, neglecting his farm and trading business, and spending his money buying liquor by the keg.

Eventually, he took up new interests. He began to draw, then he took up blacksmithing, so he could repair the iron farm implements that had recently been introduced to the area by traders. Self-taught as usual, he made his own tools, forge, and bellows. He was soon doing a good business either repairing items or selling items he had created himself. His spurs and bridle bits were in great demand because he liked to decorate them with silver. Although he maintained his store, he both stopped drinking and stopped selling alcohol.

Sequoyah came to believe that one of white people&#x27;s many advantages was their written language, which allowed them to expand their knowledge, partake in many forms of media, and have a better network of communication. The Cherokees&#x27; disadvantage was having to rely solely on memory. This sparked his interest in wanting to create some form of a written language for the Cherokee nation.

By 1809, Sequoyah is believed to have started developing what became his Cherokee syllabary, in hopes of unifying the Cherokee nation and making them more independent. In 2008, archeologist Kenneth B. Tankersley (Cherokee Nation) of the University of Cincinnati found carvings from the syllabary in a cave in southeastern Kentucky, where Sequoyah is known to have had relatives. This cave was the traditional burial site of a Cherokee chief, Red Bird. Some 15 identifiable Cherokee syllabary symbols were found carved into the limestone, accompanied by a date of 1808 or 1818. In addition, there were petroglyphs that appeared to include ancient Cherokee symbols, in addition to bears, deer and birds.

=== Move to Alabama ===
It is unclear when Sequoyah moved to Alabama from Tennessee. Many Cherokee began migrating there even before ceding their land around Sequoyah&#x27;s birthplace in 1819, as they were under continual pressure by European-American settlers. Some sources claim he went with his mother, though there is no confirmed date for her death. Others have stated that it was around 1809 when he started his work on the Cherokee syllabary. Another source claims it was in 1818. However, this date is too late, because Sequoyah was already living in Alabama when he enlisted in the army.

In 1813–1814, Sequoyah served as a warrior of the Cherokee Regiment, commanded by Colonel Gideon Morgan, at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend against the &quot;Red Sticks&quot; (Creek, or Muskogee, renegades). His white comrades called him either George Guess or George Gist. The battle was part of the Creek War, launched by traditional Creek during the War of 1812 to assert their power within the people and expel the European-Americans.

While serving, Sequoyah witnessed the disadvantages of not having a written language. Unlike the white soldiers, he and his fellow Cherokee warriors could not write letters to home, read their military orders, or write down any events or thoughts that occurred during their service. This deepened his determination to create a reading and writing system for the Cherokee language. 

In 1817, Sequoyah signed a treaty that traded Cherokee land in the southeast for land in Arkansas. But in 1819, he backed out of the treaty, which resulted in the loss of his first Alabama home, leading him to move to Willstown (modern-day Fort Payne), Alabama.

=== Life after the creation of the syllabary ===
Sequoyah completed his syllabary in 1821. It was not immediately accepted by the Cherokee nation, but soon quickly spread. In 1824, Sequoyah was awarded a medal from the Cherokee National Council. This same year, Sequoyah moved from Alabama to Arkansas. 

Four years later, he was one of the &quot;Old Settler&quot; delegates that went to Washington, D.C., to sign the treaty that exchanged the Cherokee land in Arkansas for Indian Territory (modern-day Oklahoma). 

In 1829, Sequoyah settled in present-day Sallisaw, Oklahoma, with his wife and daughter. In 1838, the Cherokees from the southeast were moved to Indian Territory under Chief John Ross. After this, Sequoyah set out to unite the 16 other Old Settlers with the Ross Party because they already had established their own government. In 1839, Sequoyah and the 16 other Old Settlers and about 15 representatives of the Ross party signed the Act of Union, and a new Cherokee constitution was created.

Soon afterward, Sequoyah went to Mexico in search for Cherokees who had migrated there. He was hoping to spread his teachings of the syllabary and convince the migrated Cherokees to move to Indian Territory.

==Syllabary and Cherokee literacy==
As a silversmith, Sequoyah dealt regularly with European Americans who had settled in the area. He was impressed by their writing, and referred to their correspondence as &quot;talking leaves&quot;. He knew that the papers represented a way to transmit information to other people in distant places, which his fellow American soldiers were able to do but he and other indigenous people could not. A majority of the Cherokee believed that writing was either sorcery, witchcraft, a special gift, or a pretense; Sequoyah accepted none of these explanations. He said that he could invent a way for Cherokees to talk on paper, even though his friends and family thought the idea was absurd.

===Creation===
Around 1809, Sequoyah began creating a system of writing for the Cherokee language. Initially, he pursued a pictograph or logographic system, where every word in the language had a character or symbol. As he failed to plant his fields, endangering his survival, his friends and neighbors thought he had lost his mind. His wife is said to have burned his initial work, believing it to be witchcraft, a notion shared by some of his peers. Ultimately, he realized that this approach was impractical because it would require too many pictures to be remembered. 

He then tried making a symbol for each idea, but this also proved impractical.

Sequoyah&#x27;s third approach was to develop a symbol for each syllable in the language. He used the Bible as a reference, along with adaptations from English, Greek, and Hebrew letters. By 1821, he had created a set of 86 symbols (later streamlined to 85), each depicting a consonant-vowel sequence or a syllable of the Cherokee language. The symbols can be written in a chart layout, with the columns being each vowel and the rows being each consonant.

===Teaching the syllabary===
Sequoyah&#x27;s six-year-old daughter, Ayokeh (also spelled Ayoka), was the first person to learn from it. Word spread in their town that they had created a new way to communicate, and they were charged and brought to trial by the town chief. Sequoyah and Ayokeh were separated but still communicated by sending letters to one another. Eventually, the warriors presiding over their trial, along with the town, believed that Sequoyah had in fact created a new form of communication, and they all wanted him to teach it to them.

He traveled to the Indian Reserves in the Arkansas Territory, where some Cherokee had settled west of the Mississippi River. To convince the local leaders of the syllabary&#x27;s usefulness, Sequoyah asked each leader to say a word, which he wrote down and then called his daughter in to read the words back. Intrigued, the leaders allowed Sequoyah to teach a few local people the syllabary. This took several months, during which it was rumored that he might be using the students for sorcery. After completing the lessons, Sequoyah wrote a dictated letter to each student, and read a dictated response. This test convinced the western Cherokee that he had created a practical writing system.

When Sequoyah went to the eastern tribes, he brought a sealed envelope containing a written speech from one of the Arkansas Cherokee leaders. By reading this speech, he convinced the eastern Cherokee to also learn the system. From there it continued to be taught across the Cherokee tribes and towns in the east.

By 1830, as many as 90% of Cherokees were literate in their own language. 
===Use in official documents and print===

In 1825, the Cherokee Nation officially adopted the writing system, making them one of the first indigenous groups to have a functional written language. By the end of the year, the Bible and hymns were translated into Cherokee. In 1826, the Cherokee National Council commissioned George Lowrey and David Brown to translate and print eight copies of the laws of the Cherokee Nation in the Cherokee language.

In 1828, religious pamphlets, educational materials, and legal documents were all made using the syllabary. A newspaper was founded, the &quot;Cherokee Phoenix,&quot; the first bilingual newspaper in North America. This newspaper helped keep unity in a dispersed Cherokee Nation by allowing them to have their own network of communication and information. 

The syllabary was used for over 100 years to make newspapers, books, religious texts, and almanacs (calendars).

When the Cherokee Nation purchased their first printing press, some of Sequoyah&#x27;s handwritten symbols needed to be modified. To make the symbols clearer, they were replaced by adaptations from the Roman alphabet and used in the syllabary from that point on.

==Life in Indian Territory==
After the Nation accepted his syllabary in 1825, Sequoyah traveled to the Cherokee lands in the Arkansas Territory. There he set up a blacksmith shop and a salt works. He continued to teach the syllabary to anyone who wished.

In 1828, Sequoyah journeyed to Washington, D.C., as part of a delegation to negotiate a treaty for land in the planned Indian Territory. While in Washington, D.C., he sat for a formal portrait painted by Charles Bird King (see image at the top of this article). He holds a copy of the syllabary in his left hand and is smoking a long-stemmed pipe. During his trip, he met representatives of other Native American tribes. Inspired by these meetings, he decided to create a syllabary for universal use among Native American tribes. Sequoyah began to journey into areas of present-day Arizona and New Mexico, to meet with tribes there.

In 1829, Sequoyah moved to a location on Big Skin Bayou, where he built Sequoyah&#x27;s Cabin that became his home for the rest of his life. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1965. (The present-day city of Sallisaw, Oklahoma, developed near here.) The house was operated by the Oklahoma Historical Society until it was purchased by the Cherokee Nation on 9 November 2016.

In 1839, when the Cherokee were bitterly divided over the issue of removal to Indian Territory, Sequoyah joined with Jesse Bushyhead to try to reunite the Cherokee Nation. Sequoyah, representing the Western Cherokee, and Bushyhead representing the Eastern Cherokee, made a joint plea at a tribal council meeting at Takatoka on 20 June 1839. They succeeded in getting a voice vote to hold a new council of all Cherokee to resolve the reunification issues. This is when the Act of Union and a new Cherokee Constitution was created.

==Final journey and death==

Sequoyah dreamed of seeing reunification of the splintered Cherokee Nation. In the spring of 1842, he began a trip to locate other Cherokee bands who were believed to have fled to Mexico and attempted to persuade them to return to the Cherokee Nation, by then mostly residing in Indian Territory. He was accompanied by his son, Teesy (Chusaleta), as well as other Cherokee men identified as Co-tes-ka, Nu-wo-ta-na, Cah-ta-ta, Co-wo-si-ti, John Elijah, and The Worm:

Sometime between 1843 and 1845, he died due to an estimated respiratory infection during a trip to San Fernando de Rosas in Coahuila, Mexico. A letter written in 1845 by accompanying Cherokee stated that he had died in 1843:

The village of San Fernando de Rosas was later renamed as Zaragoza.

In 1938, the Cherokee Nation Principal Chief J. B. Milam funded an expedition to find Sequoyah&#x27;s grave in Mexico. A party of Cherokee and non-Cherokee scholars embarked from Eagle Pass, Texas, in January 1939. They found a grave site near a fresh water spring in Coahuila, Mexico, but could not conclusively determine the grave site was that of Sequoyah.

In 2011, the &quot;Muskogee Phoenix&quot; published an article relating a discovery in 1903 of a gravesite in the Wichita Mountains by Hayes and Fancher, which they believed was Sequoyah&#x27;s. The two men said the site was in a cave and contained a human skeleton with one leg shorter than the other, a long-stemmed pipe, two silver medals, a flintlock rifle and an ax. However, the site was far north of the Mexican border.

==International influence==
Sequoyah&#x27;s work has had international influence, encouraging the development of syllabaries for other previously unwritten languages. The news that an illiterate Cherokee had created a syllabary spread throughout the United States and its territories. A missionary working in northern Alaska read about it and created the syllabary that has become known as Cree syllabics. This syllabic writing inspired other indigenous groups across Canada to adapt the syllabics to create writing for their languages.

A literate Cherokee emigrated to Liberia, where he discussed his people&#x27;s syllabary. A Bassa language speaker of Liberia was inspired to create his own syllabary, and other indigenous groups in West Africa followed suit, creating their own syllabaries.

A missionary in China read about the Cree syllabary and was inspired to follow that example in writing a local language in China. The result of the diffusion of Sequoyah&#x27;s work has been the development of a total of 21 known scripts, which have been used to write more than 65 languages.

==Legacy==

Due to Sequoyah&#x27;s contributions and achievements in Cherokee history, there are statues, monuments, museums, and paintings dedicated in his honor across the United States and in various genres.

Science:
* The genus of the coast redwood (&quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot;) is named after Sequoyah.

Museums:

* The Carnegie Museum of Art, Architecture Hall, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Sequoyah Alphabet
* The Sequoyah Birthplace Museum in Monroe County, eastern Tennessee, features his life and Cherokee culture.
* In 1964, Sequoyah was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum

Paintings and pictures:

* Artist Henry Inman painted a portrait of Sequoyah ca. 1830; it now hangs in the United States National Portrait Gallery
* Sequoyah is pictured on the reverse of the 2017 Sacagawea Dollar coin

Statues and memorials:

* Oklahoma gave a statue of Sequoyah to the National Statuary Hall Collection in 1917. This was the first statue representing a Native American to be placed in the hall. It was created by Vinnie Ream, and is displayed in the Capitol rotunda in Washington, D.C.
* A monument honoring Chief Sequoyah of the Cherokee Nation was dedicated in September 1932 at Calhoun, Georgia. 34.530286°N 84.936806°W
* 1939, a bronze panel with a raised figure of &quot;Sequoyah,&quot; by Lee Lawrie, was erected in his honor at the Library of Congress
* A Sequoyah memorial was installed in front of the Museum of the Cherokee People in North Carolina

Landmark:

* Sequoyah&#x27;s Cabin, where he lived during 1829–1844 in the Cherokee Nation, Indian Territory, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965 in Oklahoma.
Other:
* On 20 December 1980 the United States Postal Service issued a 19¢ stamp in his honor in the Great Americans series.
* Addressing the exalted place Sequoyah holds in Cherokee imagination, the Cherokee composer and musicologist Jack Kilpatrick wrote: &quot;Sequoyah was always in the wilderness. He walked about, but he was not a hunter. I wonder what he was looking for.&quot;
* Johnny Cash sang about Sequoyah in his 1964 song &quot;The Talking Leaves&quot;.
* Sequoyah briefly appears as a character in &quot;Unto These Hills&quot;, an outdoor drama that has been performed in Cherokee, NC since 1950.

In 1824, the General Council of the Eastern Cherokee awarded Sequoyah a large silver medal in honor of the syllabary. According to Davis, one side of the medal bore his image surrounded by the inscription in English, &quot;Presented to George Gist by the General Council of the Cherokee for his ingenuity in the invention of the Cherokee Alphabet.&quot; The reverse side showed two long-stemmed pipes and the same inscription written in Cherokee. Sequoyah was said to wear the medal throughout the rest of his life and it was buried with him.

== Contemporary use of Cherokee ==
Cherokee is mainly spoken in Oklahoma, North Carolina, and Arkansas; between 1500 and 2100 people actively speak Cherokee in these three main areas. A 2018 survey states that there are 1200 Cherokee speakers who live in the Cherokee nation of Oklahoma, 217 speakers in Eastern North Carolina, and 101 speakers in the United Keetoowah tribe of Cherokee in Arkansas, and that the majority of the Cherokee speakers are people over 40.

Today, in the Cherokee nation (northeast Oklahoma) the syllabary is present on street signs and buildings, is the co-official language with English, and is taught in schools in Oklahoma and North Carolina. The Cherokee nation in the 21st century is trying to integrate this language into people&#x27;s daily lives. Their goal is to increase immersion programs in schools, encourage older Cherokee members to teach the younger generations, and in 50 years (as of 2008) to have about 80% more fluent Cherokee speakers. People of all ages are taught the language, parents and adults, children in schools, and it is offered at several universities in Oklahoma and North Carolina.

During the time when white settler Indian Removal policies removed indigenous tribes from their lands, a process now known as the Trail of Tears, the use of the Cherokee language dropped dramatically. Use of any indigenous language in the government-run Indian boarding schools resulted in some kind of physical punishment. In the late 20th century, there was a revitalization of the Cherokee language with programs, run by three sovereign Cherokee tribes, and online courses.

==Namesake honors==
* A small Mississippian arrowhead found throughout the Midwest and upper south was named Sequoyah by James Brown in 1968.
* The Sequoia trees in California were named &quot;Sequoia gigantea&quot; in 1847 by Austrian biologist Stephan Endlicher. While it was assumed that this was in honor of Sequoyah, this hypothesis has been questioned. Twenty-first century research in Austria has established that Endlicher, also a published linguist, was familiar with Sequoyah&#x27;s work. See Chief Sequoyah, a Sequoia tree in Sequoia National Park.
* A crystalline chemical compound found by distilling the needles of the trees was described by Georg Lunge and Th. Steinkaukler in 1880 and named sequoiene.
* The caterpillar of the sequoia-borer moth, a sesiid moth, was named &quot;Bembecia sequoiae&quot;.
* During the Sequoyah Constitutional Convention in 1905, the proposed State of Sequoyah was named in his honor, and merged with Oklahoma Territory to form the new State of Oklahoma in 1906.
* The name of the district where Sequoyah lived in present-day Oklahoma was changed to the Sequoyah District in 1851. When Oklahoma was admitted to the union in 1906, that area was recorded as Sequoyah County.
* Sequoyah Research Center is dedicated to collecting and archiving Native American writing and literature.
* Mount Sequoyah in the Great Smoky Mountains.
* Mount Sequoyah in Fayetteville, Arkansas, was named in honor of him after the city donated the top of East Mountain to the Methodist Assembly for a retreat.
* The Sequoyah Hills neighborhood of Knoxville, Tennessee.
* The Tennessee Valley Authority Sequoyah Nuclear Plant was named for him. 
* The Sequoyah Marina on Norris Lake in Tennessee, upstream from Norris Dam on the Clinch River.

<text>Rodelinda, regina de&#x27; Longobardi (HWV 19) is an opera seria in three acts composed for the first Royal Academy of Music by George Frideric Handel. The libretto is by Nicola Francesco Haym, based on an earlier libretto by Antonio Salvi. &quot;Rodelinda&quot; has long been regarded as one of Handel&#x27;s greatest works.

==Performance history==
&quot;Rodelinda&quot; was first performed at the King’s Theatre in the Haymarket, London, on 13 February 1725. It was produced with the same singers as &quot;Tamerlano&quot;. There were 14 performances; it was repeated on 18 December 1725, and again on 4 May 1731, a further 16 performances in all, each revival including changes and fresh material. In 1735 and 1736 it was also performed, with only modest success, in Hamburg at the Oper am Gänsemarkt. The first modern production – in heavily altered form – was in Göttingen on 26 June 1920 where it was the first of a series of modern Handel opera revivals produced by the Handel enthusiast Oskar Hagen. The opera reached the US in 1931 and was revived in London in 1939. A further notable London revival by the Handel Opera Society, in English and using a cut text, including both Joan Sutherland and Janet Baker in the cast, conducted by Charles Farncombe, was performed in June 1959. With the revival of interest in Baroque music and historically informed musical performance since the 1960s, &quot;Rodelinda&quot;, like all Handel operas, receives performances at festivals and opera houses today. Among other performances, &quot;Rodelinda&quot; was staged at the Glyndebourne Festival in the UK in 1998, by the Metropolitan Opera in New York in 2004 and by English National Opera in 2014. The ENO production was revived at the Bolshoi Theatre in 2015. The Gran Teatre del Liceu, Barcelona, performed the opera in March 2019, with Lisette Oropesa and Bejun Mehta in the leading roles. The Dutch National Opera staged &quot;Rodelinda&quot; in January 2020, with Lucy Crowe and Bejun Mehta in the leading roles.

==Roles==

==Synopsis==
=== The argument ===
Prior to the opening of the opera, Grimoaldo has defeated Bertarido, King of Lombardy, in battle and has usurped the throne of Milan. Bertarido has fled, leaving his wife Rodelinda and his son Flavio prisoners of the usurper. Failing to secure support to recover his crown, Bertarido has caused it to be reported that he has died in exile, a ruse to be used in an attempt to rescue his wife and son.

=== Act 1 ===

==== Rodelinda&#x27;s apartments ====
Alone in the palace, Rodelinda mourns the loss of her husband Bertarido. The usurper Grimoaldo enters, declaring a long-hidden passion for her. He proposes marriage and offers her back the throne that is rightfully hers. She angrily rejects him (Aria: &quot;L&#x27;empio rigor del fato&quot;). Eduige arrives looking for Grimoaldo. Grimoaldo, having previously been betrothed to Bertarido&#x27;s sister Eduige, now spurns her. After Grimoaldo leaves, the scheming Garibaldo, his counsellor, professes love for Eduige. She promises to return his love once she has had revenge on Grimoaldo (Aria: &quot;Lo farò, diro: spietato&quot;). Alone, Garibaldo reveals that his love for Eduige is feigned, and is part of a plan to gain the throne for himself (Aria: &quot;Di cupido impiego i vanni&quot;).

==== A cypress-grove ====
Bertarido, in hiding nearby, reads the inscription on his own memorial and longs for his beloved wife Rodelinda (Aria: &quot;Dove sei, amato bene?&quot;). Along with his friend and counsellor Unulfo, he secretly watches as a weeping Rodelinda and Flavio, her son, lay flowers at his memorial. Garibaldo enters with an ultimatum for Rodelinda: either she agrees to marry Grimoaldo, or her son will be put to death. Rodelinda consents but also vows to demand Garibaldo&#x27;s death when she returns to the throne. Bertarido, still watching, is aghast and takes Rodelinda&#x27;s decision as an act of betrayal.

=== Act 2 ===

==== A great hall ====
Garibaldo taunts Eduige, telling her that she has missed her chance to become queen. Eduige satirically congratulates Rodelinda, noting her sudden decision to betray her husband&#x27;s memory and marry his usurper. Eduige vows vengeance on Grimoaldo. Eduige departs and Grimoaldo enters. Rodelinda sets out her terms for marrying Grimoaldo: he must in her sight kill Flavio with his own hands. Grimoaldo, horrified, refuses. After Rodelinda leaves, Garibaldo encourages Grimoaldo to carry out the murder, but he again refuses. He says that Rodelinda&#x27;s act of courage and determination has made him love her all the more, though he has now lost hope of winning her. When the two advisors are alone, Unulfo asks Garibaldo how he could give a king such advice, and Garibaldo expounds his tyrannical perspective on the use of power (Aria: &quot;Tirannia gliel diede il regno&quot;).

==== A delightful prospect ====
Bertarido approaches the palace grounds in disguise; his sister Eduige recognizes his voice. Unulfo brings word of Rodelinda&#x27;s fidelity, and Eduige agrees to help Bertarido rescue his wife and son. Unulfo promises to pass a message to Rodelinda that her husband is still alive. Bertarido rejoices.

==== A gallery in Rodelinda&#x27;s apartment ====
Rodelinda and Bertarido meet in secret, and are discovered in an embrace by Grimoaldo who fails to recognise her husband. Grimoaldo is outraged, believing that Rodelinda has taken a lover. To save her honour, Bertarido reveals his identity but Grimoaldo vows to kill him anyway, whoever he may be. The spouses bid each other a last farewell (Duet: &quot;Io t&#x27;abbraccio&quot;).

=== Act 3 ===

==== A gallery ====
Unulfo and Eduige plan to release Bertarido from prison: they will smuggle to him a sword and the key to a secret passage. Garibaldo advises Grimoaldo to put the unknown man – whether Bertarido or not – to death. Grimoaldo is racked by jealousy, passion and fear.

==== A very dark prison ====
Languishing in prison, Bertarido receives the sword, the key, and a written note. When Unulfo comes to release him, Bertarido mistakes the visitor in the darkness for the executioner and wounds him with the sword. Unulfo shrugs the injury off, and the two leave. Eduige guides Rodelinda into the cell. Finding it empty, and seeing blood on the floor, they fear that Bertarido is dead.

==== A royal garden ====
Grimoaldo is tormented by remorse and flees to the palace garden, hoping to find a peaceful spot where he can seek solace in sleep (Aria: &quot;Pastorello d&#x27;un povero armento&quot;). Garibaldo, finding him unprotected, decides to kill him. Bertarido appears and kills the intended assassin, though sparing Grimoaldo (Aria: &quot;Vivi, tiranno!&quot;). Grimoaldo renounces his claim to the throne of Milan, and pledges himself once again to Eduige. He offers the throne back to Bertarido who accepts it once he is assured that his wife and son will be returned to him. There is general rejoicing.

==Sources==
The opera&#x27;s libretto is by Nicola Francesco Haym, and was based on an earlier libretto by Antonio Salvi that had been set by Giacomo Antonio Perti in 1710. Salvi&#x27;s libretto was derived from Pierre Corneille&#x27;s tragedy &quot;Pertharite, roi des Lombards&quot; (1652), which dealt with the history of Perctarit, king of the Lombards. The ultimate origin of the story, as of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Flavio&quot;, is Paul the Deacon&#x27;s eighth-century work&quot; Gesta Langobardorum&quot;. In the opera, &#x27;Pertharite&#x27; becomes &#x27;Bertarido&#x27;.

==Context and analysis==

The German-born Handel, after spending some of his early career composing operas and other pieces in Italy, settled in London, where in 1711 he had brought Italian opera for the first time with his opera &quot;Rinaldo&quot;. A tremendous success, &quot;Rinaldo&quot; created a craze in London for Italian opera seria, a form focused overwhelmingly on solo arias for the star virtuoso singers. In 1719, Handel was appointed music director of an organisation called the Royal Academy of Music (unconnected with the present-day London conservatoire), a company under royal charter to produce Italian operas in London. Handel was not only to compose operas for the company but hire the star singers, supervise the orchestra and musicians, and adapt operas from Italy for London performance.

Within a year, 1724–1725, Handel wrote three great operas in succession for the Royal Academy of Music, each with Senesino and Francesca Cuzzoni as the stars, the other two being &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; and &quot;Tamerlano&quot;.

Horace Walpole wrote of Cuzzoni in &quot;Rodelinda&quot;:She was short and squat, with a doughy cross face, but fine complexion; was not a good actress; dressed ill; and was silly and fantastical. And yet on her appearing in this opera, in a brown silk gown trimmed with silver, with the vulgarity and indecorum of which all the old ladies were much scandalised, the young adopted it as a fashion, so universally, that it seemed a national uniform for youth and beauty.

To 18th century musicologist Charles Burney, &quot;Rodelinda&quot; &quot;contains such a number of capital and pleasing airs, as entitles it to one of the first places among Handel&#x27;s dramatic productions&quot;. Burney notes particularly the aria for Bertarido in act 1, &quot;Dove sei, amato bene&quot;, calling it &quot;one of the finest pathetic airs that can be found in all his works... This air is rendered affecting by new and curious modulation, as well as by the general cast of the melody.&quot; This aria is also sometimes sung as a solo piece in English, to an unrelated text – &quot;Art thou troubled?&quot; – by W. G. Rothery, written in 1910.

The opera is scored for two recorders, flute, two oboes, bassoon, two horns, strings and continuo (cello, lute, harpsichord).

<doc id="533069" wikidata="Q3707858" url="?curid=533069" title="Type (biology)">
<text>In biology, a type is a particular (or in some cases a group of specimens) of an organism to which the scientific name of that organism is formally associated. In other words, a type is an example that serves to anchor or centralizes the defining features of that particular taxon. In older usage (pre-1900 in botany), a type was a taxon rather than a specimen.

A taxon is a scientifically named grouping of organisms with other like organisms, a set that includes some organisms and excludes others, based on a detailed published description (for example a species description) and on the provision of type material, which is usually available to scientists for examination in a major museum research collection, or similar institution.

==Type specimen==
According to a precise set of rules laid down in the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) and the &quot;International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants&quot; (ICN), the scientific name of every taxon is almost always based on one particular &quot;specimen&quot;, or in some cases specimens. Types are of great significance to biologists, especially to taxonomists. Types are usually physical specimens that are kept in a museum or herbarium research collection, but failing that, an image of an individual of that taxon has sometimes been designated as a type. Describing species and appointing type specimens is part of scientific nomenclature and alpha taxonomy.

When identifying material, a scientist attempts to apply a taxon name to a specimen or group of specimens based on their understanding of the relevant taxa, based on (at least) having read the type description(s), preferably also based on an examination of all the type material of all of the relevant taxa. If there is more than one named type that all appear to be the same taxon, then the oldest name takes precedence and is considered to be the correct name of the material in hand. If on the other hand, the taxon appears never to have been named at all, then the scientist or another qualified expert picks a type specimen and publishes a new name and an official description.

Depending on the nomenclature code applied to the organism in question, a type can be a specimen, a culture, an illustration, or (under the bacteriological code) a description. Some codes consider a subordinate taxon to be the type, but under the botanical code, the type is always a specimen or illustration.

For example, in the research collection of the Natural History Museum in London, there is a bird specimen numbered 1886.6.24.20. This is a specimen of a kind of bird commonly known as the spotted harrier, which currently bears the scientific name &quot;Circus assimilis&quot;. This particular specimen is the holotype for that species; the name &quot;Circus assimilis&quot; refers, by definition, to the species of that particular specimen. That species was named and described by Jardine and Selby in 1828, and the holotype was placed in the museum collection so that other scientists might refer to it as necessary.

At least for type specimens there is no requirement for a &quot;typical&quot; individual to be used. Genera and families, particularly those established by early taxonomists, tend to be named after species that are more &quot;typical&quot; for them, but here too this is not always the case and due to changes in systematics &quot;cannot&quot; be. Hence, the term name-bearing type or onomatophore is sometimes used, to denote the fact that biological types do not define &quot;typical&quot; individuals or taxa, but rather fix a scientific name to a specific . Type specimens are theoretically even allowed to be aberrant or deformed individuals or color variations, though this is rarely chosen to be the case, as it makes it hard to determine to which population the individual belonged.

The usage of the term &quot;type&quot; is somewhat complicated by slightly different uses in botany and zoology. In the &quot;PhyloCode&quot;, type-based definitions are replaced by phylogenetic definitions.

==Older terminology==
In some older taxonomic works the word &quot;type&quot; has sometimes been used differently. The meaning was similar in the first &quot;Laws of Botanical Nomenclature&quot;, but has a meaning closer to the term taxon in some other works:
Translation: This single character permits [one to] distinguish this type from all other species of the section ... After studying the diverse forms, I came to consider them as belonging to the one and the same specific type.

==In botany==
In botanical nomenclature, a &quot;type&quot; (&quot;typus&quot;, &quot;nomenclatural type&quot;), &quot;is that element to which the name of a taxon is permanently attached.&quot; (article 7.2) In botany, a type is either a specimen or an illustration. A specimen is a real plant (or one or more parts of a plant or a lot of small plants), dead and kept safe, &quot;curated&quot;, in a herbarium (or the equivalent for fungi). Examples of where an illustration may serve as a type include:
* A detailed drawing, painting, etc., depicting the plant, from the early days of plant taxonomy. A dried plant was difficult to transport and hard to keep safe for the future; many specimens from the early days of botany have since been lost or damaged. Highly skilled botanical artists were sometimes employed by a botanist to make faithful and detailed illustrations. Some such illustrations have become the best record and have been chosen to serve as the type of taxon.
* A detailed picture of something that can be seen only through a microscope. A tiny &quot;plant&quot; on a microscope slide makes for a poor type: the microscope slide may be lost or damaged, or it may be very difficult to find the &quot;plant&quot; in question among whatever else is on the microscope slide. An illustration makes for a much more reliable type (Art 37.5 of the &quot;Vienna Code&quot;, 2006).

A type does not determine the circumscription of the taxon. For example, the common dandelion is a controversial taxon: some botanists consider it to consist of over a hundred species, and others regard it as a single species. The type of the name &quot;Taraxacum officinale&quot; is the same whether the circumscription of the species includes all those small species (&quot;Taraxacum officinale&quot; is a &quot;big&quot; species) or whether the circumscription is limited to only one small species among the other hundred (&quot;Taraxacum officinale&quot; is a &quot;small&quot; species). The name &quot;Taraxacum officinale&quot; is the same and the type of the name is the same, but the extent to which the name actually applies varies greatly. Setting the circumscription of a taxon is done by a taxonomist in a publication.

Miscellaneous notes:
# Only a species or an infraspecific taxon can have a type of its own. For most new taxa (published on or after 1 January 2007, article 37) at these ranks, a type should not be an illustration.
# A genus has the same type as that of one of its species (article 10).
# A family has the same type as that of one of its genera (article 10).

The &quot;ICN&quot; provides a listing of the various kinds of types (article 9 and the Glossary), the most important of which is the holotype. These are
* holotype – the single specimen or illustration that the author(s) clearly indicated to be the nomenclatural type of a name
* lectotype – a specimen or illustration designated from the original material as the nomenclatural type when there was no holotype specified or the holotype has been lost or destroyed
* isotype – a duplicate of the holotype
* syntype – any specimen (or illustration) cited in the original description when there is no holotype, or any one of two or more specimens simultaneously designated as types
* paratype – any specimen (or illustration) cited in the original description that is not the holotype nor an isotype, nor one of the syntypes
* neotype – a specimen or illustration selected to serve as nomenclatural type if no material from the original description is available
* epitype – a specimen or illustration selected to serve as an interpretative type, usually when another kind of type does not show the critical features needed for identification

The word &quot;type&quot; appears in botanical literature as a part of some older terms that have no status under the &quot;ICN&quot;: for example a clonotype.

==In zoology==

In zoological nomenclature, the type of a species or subspecies is a specimen or series of specimens. The type of a genus or subgenus is a species. The type of a suprageneric taxon (e.g., family, etc.) is a genus. Names higher than superfamily rank do not have types. A &quot;name-bearing type&quot; is a specimen or image that &quot;provides the objective standard of reference whereby the application of the name of a nominal taxon can be determined.&quot;

===Definitions===
* A type specimen is a vernacular term (not a formally defined term) typically used for an individual or fossil that is any of the various name-bearing types for a species. For example, the type specimen for the species &quot;Homo neanderthalensis&quot; was the specimen &quot;Neanderthal-1&quot; discovered by Johann Karl Fuhlrott in 1856 at Feldhofer in the Neander Valley in Germany, consisting of a skullcap, thigh bones, part of a pelvis, some ribs, and some arm and shoulder bones. There may be more than one type specimen, but there is (at least in modern times) only one holotype.
* A type species is the nominal species that is the name-bearing type of a nominal genus or subgenus.
* A type genus is the nominal genus that is the name-bearing type of a nominal family-group taxon.
* The type series are all those specimens included by the author in a taxon&#x27;s formal description, unless the author explicitly or implicitly excludes them as part of the series.

===Use of type specimens===

Although in reality biologists may examine many specimens (when available) of a new taxon before writing an official published species description, nonetheless, under the formal rules for naming species (the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature), a single type must be designated, as part of the published description.

A type description must include a diagnosis (typically, a discussion of similarities to and differences from closely related species), and an indication of where the type specimen or specimens are deposited for examination. The geographical location where a type specimen was originally found is known as its &#x27;. In the case of parasites, the term &#x27; (or symbiotype) is used to indicate the host organism from which the type specimen was obtained.

Zoological collections are maintained by universities and museums. Ensuring that types are kept in good condition and made available for examination by taxonomists are two important functions of such collections. And, while there is only one &quot;holotype&quot; designated, there can be other &quot;type&quot; specimens, the following of which are formally defined:

====Holotype====

When a single specimen is clearly designated in the original description, this specimen is known as the &quot;holotype&quot; of that species. The holotype is typically placed in a major museum, or similar well-known public collection, so that it is freely available for later examination by other biologists.

====Paratype====

When the original description designated a holotype, there may be additional specimens that the author designates as additional representatives of the same species, termed paratypes. These are not name-bearing types.

====Allotype====
An allotype is a specimen of the opposite sex to the holotype, designated from among paratypes. The word was also formerly used for a specimen that shows features not seen in the holotype of a fossil. The term is not regulated by the ICZN.

====Neotype====
A neotype is a specimen later selected to serve as the single type specimen when an original holotype has been lost or destroyed or where the original author never cited a specimen.

====Syntype====

A syntype is any one of two or more specimens that is listed in a species description where no holotype was designated; historically, syntypes were often explicitly designated as such, and under the present ICZN this is a requirement, but modern attempts to publish species description based on syntypes are generally frowned upon by practicing taxonomists, and most are gradually being replaced by lectotypes. Those that still exist are still considered name-bearing types.

====Lectotype====
A lectotype is a specimen later selected to serve as the single type specimen for species originally described from a set of syntypes. In zoology, a lectotype is a kind of name-bearing type. When a species was originally described on the basis of a name-bearing type consisting of multiple specimens, one of those may be designated as the lectotype. Having a single name-bearing type reduces the potential for confusion, especially considering that it is not uncommon for a series of syntypes to contain specimens of more than one species.

Formally, Carl Linnaeus is the lectotype for &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, designated in 1959. He published the first book considered to be part of taxonomical nomenclature, the 10th edition of Systema Naturae, which included the first description of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; and determined all valid syntypes for the species. Crucially, in 1959, Professor William Stearne wrote in a passing remark on Linnaeus&#x27;s contributions, &quot;Linnaeus himself, must stand as the type of his &quot;Homo sapiens.&quot; He justified his choice by noting that the specimen that Linnaeus, who wrote his own autobiography five times, had most studied was probably himself. This sufficiently and correctly designated Linnaeus to be the lectotype for &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;.

It has also been suggested that Edward Cope is the lectotype for &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, based on the 1994 reporting by Louie Psihoyos of an unpublished proposal by Bob Bakker to do so. However, this designation is invalid both because Edward Cope was not one of the specimens described in Systema Naturae 10th Ed., and therefore not being a syntype is not eligible, and because Stearne&#x27;s designation in 1959 has seniority and invalidates future designations.

====Paralectotype====
A paralectotype is any additional specimen from among a set of syntypes after a lectotype has been designated from among them. These are not name-bearing types.

====Hapantotype====
A special case in Protistans where the type consists of two or more specimens of &quot;directly related individuals&quot; within a preparation medium such as a blood smear. The terms parahapantotype and lectohapantotype refer to type preparations additional to the hapantotype and designated by the describing author. As with other type designations the use of the prefix &quot;Neo-&quot;, such as Neohapantotype, is employed when a replacement for the original hapantotype is designated, or when an original description did not include a designated type specimen.

==== Iconotype ====
An illustration on which a new species or subspecies was based. For instance, the Burmese python, &quot;Python bivittatus,&quot; is one of many species that are based on illustrations by Albertus Seba (1734).

====Ergatotype====
An ergatotype is a specimen selected to represent a worker member in hymenopterans which have polymorphic castes.

====Hypotype====

A hypotype is a specimen whose details have previously been published that is used in a supplementary figure or description of the species.

====Kleptotype====

The term &quot;kleptotype&quot; informally refers to a type specimen or a part of it that has been stolen, or improperly relocated.

====Alternatives to preserved specimens====
Type illustrations have also been used by zoologists, as in the case of the Réunion parakeet, which is known only from historical illustrations and descriptions.

Recently, some species have been described where the type specimen was released alive back into the wild, such as the Bulo Burti boubou (a bushshrike), described as &quot;Laniarius liberatus&quot;, in which the species description included DNA sequences from blood and feather samples. Assuming there is no future question as to the status of such a species, the absence of a type specimen does not invalidate the name, but it may be necessary for the future to designate a neotype for such a taxon, should any questions arise. However, in the case of the bushshrike, ornithologists have argued that the specimen was a rare and hitherto unknown color morph of a long-known species, using only the available blood and feather samples. While there is still some debate on the need to deposit actual killed individuals as type specimens, it can be observed that given proper vouchering and storage, tissue samples can be just as valuable should dispute about the validity of a species arise.

====Formalisation of the type system====
The various types listed above are necessary because many species were described one or two centuries ago, when a single type specimen, a holotype, was often not designated. Also, types were not always carefully preserved, and intervening events such as wars and fires have resulted in the destruction of the original type material. The validity of a species name often rests upon the availability of original type specimens; or, if the type cannot be found, or one has never existed, upon the clarity of the description.

The ICZN has existed only since 1961 when the first edition of the Code was published. The ICZN does not always demand a type specimen for the historical validity of a species, and many &quot;type-less&quot; species do exist. The current edition of the Code, Article 75.3, prohibits the designation of a neotype unless there is &quot;an exceptional need&quot; for &quot;clarifying the taxonomic status&quot; of a species (Article 75.2).

There are many other permutations and variations on terms using the suffix &quot;-type&quot; (e.g., allotype, cotype, topotype, generitype, isotype, isoneotype, isolectotype, etc.) but these are not formally regulated by the Code, and a great many are obsolete and/or idiosyncratic. However, some of these categories can potentially apply to genuine type specimens, such as a neotype; e.g., isotypic/topotypic specimens are preferred to other specimens, when they are available at the time a neotype is chosen (because they are from the same time and/or place as the original type). A topotype is a specimen that was obtained from the same location that the original type specimen came from.

The term fixation is used by the Code for the declaration of a name-bearing type, whether by original or subsequent designation.

===Type species===
Each genus must have a designated type species (the term &quot;genotype&quot; was once used for this but has been abandoned because the word has become much better known as the term for a different concept in genetics). The description of a genus is usually based primarily on its type species, modified and expanded by the features of other included species. The generic name is permanently associated with the name-bearing type of its type species.

Ideally, a type species best exemplifies the essential characteristics of the genus to which it belongs, but this is subjective and, ultimately, technically irrelevant, as it is not a requirement of the Code. If the type species proves, upon closer examination, to belong to a pre-existing genus (a common occurrence), then all of the constituent species must be either moved into the pre-existing genus or disassociated from the original type species and given a new generic name; the old generic name passes into synonymy and is abandoned unless there is a pressing need to make an exception (decided case-by-case, via petition to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature).

===Type genus===

A type genus is a genus from which the name of a family or subfamily is formed. As with type species, the type genus is not necessarily the most representative but is usually the earliest described, largest or best-known genus. It is not uncommon for the name of a family to be based upon the name of a type genus that has passed into synonymy; the family name does not need to be changed in such a situation.

<doc id="533072" wikidata="Q413380" url="?curid=533072" title="Staurolite">
<text>Staurolite is a reddish brown to black, mostly opaque, nesosilicate mineral with a white streak. It crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system, has a Mohs hardness of 7 to 7.5 and the chemical formula: Fe2+2Al9O6(SiO4)4(O,OH)2. Magnesium, zinc and manganese substitute in the iron site and trivalent iron can substitute for aluminium.

==Properties==

Staurolite often occurs twinned in a characteristic cross-shape, called cruciform penetration twinning. In handsamples, macroscopically visible staurolite crystals are of prismatic shape. The mineral often forms porphyroblasts.

In thin sections staurolite is commonly twinned and shows lower first order birefringence similar to quartz, with the twinning displaying optical continuity. It can be identified in metamorphic rocks by its swiss cheese appearance (with poikilitic quartz) and often mantled porphyroblastic character.

==Name==
The name is derived from the Greek, &quot;stauros&quot; for cross and &quot;lithos&quot; for stone in reference to the common twinning.

==Occurrence==

Staurolite is a regional metamorphic mineral of intermediate to high grade. It occurs with almandine garnet, micas, kyanite; as well as albite, biotite, and sillimanite in gneiss and schist of regional metamorphic rocks.

It is the official state mineral of the U.S. state of Georgia and is also to be found in the Lepontine Alps in Switzerland.

Staurolite is most commonly found in Fannin County, Georgia. It is also found in Fairy Stone State Park in Patrick County, Virginia. The park is named for a local name for staurolite from a legend in the area. Samples are also found in Island Park, Idaho, near Henrys Lake; Taos, New Mexico; near Blanchard Dam in Minnesota; and Selbu, Norway.

==Use==
Staurolite is one of the index minerals that are used to estimate the temperature, depth, and pressure at which a rock undergoes metamorphism.

<text>The guanaco ( ; Lama guanicoe) is a camelid native to South America, closely related to the llama. Guanacos are one of two wild South American camelids; the other species is the vicuña, which lives at higher elevations.

== Etymology ==
The guanaco gets its name from the Quechua word &quot;wanaku&quot;. Young guanacos are called &quot;chulengos&quot; or &quot;guanaquitos&quot;.

== Characteristics ==

Guanacos stand between at the shoulder, body length of , and weigh . Their color varies very little (unlike the domestic llama), ranging from a light brown to dark cinnamon and shading to white underneath. Guanacos have grey faces and small, straight ears. The lifespan of a guanaco can be as long as 28 years. 

Guanacos are one of the largest terrestrial mammals native to South America today. Other terrestrial mammalian megafauna weighing as much or more than the guanaco include the tapirs, the marsh deer, the white-tailed deer, the spectacled bear, and the jaguar.

Guanacos have thick skin on their necks, a trait also found in their domestic counterparts, the llama, and their relatives, the wild vicuña and domesticated alpaca. This protects their necks from predator attacks. Bolivians use the neck skin of these animals to make shoes, flattening and pounding the skin to be used for the soles. In Chile, hunting is allowed only in Tierra del Fuego, where the only population not classified as endangered in the country resides. Between 2007 and 2012, 13,200 guanacos were legally hunted in Tierra del Fuego.

=== Diet ===
Like all camels, Guanacos are herbivores, grazing on grasses, shrubs, herbs, lichens, fungi, cacti, and flowers. The food is swallowed with little chewing and first enters the forestomach to be digested finally after rumination. This process is similar to that of ruminants, to which camels are not zoologically related. The camels&#x27; digestive system is likely to have developed independently of ruminants, which is evidenced by the fact that the forestomachs are equipped with glands.

=== Blood ===
Guanacos are often found at altitudes up to above sea level, except in Patagonia, where the southerly latitude means ice covers the vegetation at these altitudes. Their blood is rich in red blood cells, enabling them to survive in the low oxygen levels found at these high altitudes. A teaspoon of guanaco blood contains about 68 million red blood cells, four times that of a human.

=== Guanaco fiber ===
Guanaco fiber is particularly prized for its soft, warm feel and is found in luxury fabric. In South America, the guanaco&#x27;s soft wool is valued second only to that of vicuña wool. The pelts, particularly from the calves, are sometimes used as a substitute for red fox pelts, because the texture is difficult to differentiate. Like their domestic descendant, the llama, the guanaco is double-coated with coarse guard hairs and a soft undercoat, the hairs of which are about 16–18 μm in diameter and comparable to cashmere.

== Subspecies ==
*&quot;Lama guanicoe guanicoe&quot; from the north
*&quot;Lama guanicoe cacsilensis&quot; from the south

== Population and distribution ==
Guanacos inhabit the steppes, scrublands and mountainous regions of South America. They are found in the altiplano of Peru, Bolivia and Chile, and in Patagonia, with a small population in Paraguay. In Argentina they are more numerous in Patagonian regions, as well as in places such as Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego. In these areas, they have more robust populations, since grazing competition from livestock is limited. Guanaco respond to forage availability, occupying zones with low to intermediate food availability in the breeding season and those with the highest availability in the non-breeding season. 

Estimates, as of 2016, place their numbers around 1.5 to 2 million animals: 1,225,000–1,890,000 in Argentina, 270,000–299,000 in Chile, 3,000 in Peru, 150–200 in Bolivia and 20–100 in Paraguay. This is only 3–7% of the guanaco population before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors in South America. A small population introduced by John Hamilton exists on Staats Island in the Falkland Islands (Malvinas), with a population of around 400 as of 2003. In Torres del Paine National Park, the numbers of guanacos increased from 175 in 1975 to 3,000 in 1993.

Guanacos live in herds composed of females, their young, and a dominant male. Bachelor males form separate herds. While reproductive groups tend to remain small, often containing no more than 10 adults, bachelor herds may contain as many as 50 males. They can run at per hour, often over steep and rocky terrain. They are also excellent swimmers. A guanaco&#x27;s typical lifespan is 20 to 25 years.

In Bolivia, the habitat of Guanacos is found to be threatened by woody plant encroachment.

=== Atacama Desert ===
Some guanacos live in the Atacama Desert, where in some areas it has not rained for over 50 years. A mountainous coastline running parallel to the desert enables them to survive in what are called &quot;fog oases&quot; or lomas. Where the cool water touches the hotter land, the air above the desert is cooled, creating a fog and thus water vapor. Winds carry the fog across the desert, where cacti catch the water droplets and lichens that cling to the cacti soak it in like a sponge. Guanacos then eat the cactus flowers and the lichens.
== Ecology ==
The guanaco is a diurnal animal. It lives in small herds consisting of one male and several females with their young. When the male detects danger, he warns the group by bleating. The guanaco can run up to . This speed is important for the survival of guanacos because they cannot easily hide in the open grasslands of the Altiplano.

Natural predators of the guanaco include pumas and the culpeo or Andean fox. Fox predation was unknown until 2007 when predators began to be observed in the Karukinka Reserve in Tierra del Fuego. Scientists attribute this to the unfavourable climatic conditions on the island, which are causing food to become scarce, weakening the animals. The absence of pumas on Tierra del Fuego is also believed to be a factor that allows the fox to occupy their ecological niche. Finally, it is believed that this behaviour is not new, as the fox is nocturnal, which makes any predation challenging to observe. Faced with the threat of the fox, guanacos resort to cooperative strategies to protect their young with a shield formation, a circle around the vulnerable. If they are successful, they chase the fox away, which would be impossible with a puma.

When threatened, the guanaco alerts the rest of the herd with a high-pitched bleating sound, which sounds similar to a short, sharp laugh. The male usually runs behind the herd to defend them. Though typically mild-mannered, guanacos often spit when threatened, and can do so up to a distance of six feet.

=== Mating season ===
Mating season occurs between November and February, during which males often fight violently to establish dominance and breeding rights. Eleven-and-a-half months later, a single chulengo is born. Chulengos are able to walk immediately after birth. Male chulengos are chased off from the herd by the dominant male at around one year old.

== Conservation ==
While not considered an endangered species in southern Argentina and Chile, dead guanacos are a common sight throughout this region where they are entangled on fences. Studies have found that annual yearling mortality on fences (5.53%) was higher than adult mortality (0.84%) and was more frequent in ovine (93 cm high) than bovine (113 cm) fences. Most guanacos died entangled by their legs in the highest wire when trying to jump over the fence.

== Captivity and domestication ==

Around 300 guanacos are in U.S. zoos, and around 200 are registered in private herds. Guanacos have long been thought to be the parent species of the domesticated llama, which was confirmed via molecular phylogenetic analysis in 2001, although the analysis also found that domestic llamas had experienced considerable cross-hybridization with alpacas, which are descended from the wild vicuña.

The guanaco was independently domesticated by the Mapuche of Mocha Island in southern Chile, producing the chilihueque, which was bred for its wool and to pull the plough. This animal disappeared in the 17th century when it was replaced by Old World sheep and draft animals.

<text>Alsancak is a neighbourhood in the municipality and district of Konak, İzmir Province, Turkey. Its population is 5,581 (2022). It is part of the historic center of the city of İzmir.

==Overview==

As a notional zone, Alsancak extends from along the tip of the southern shores of the Gulf of İzmir, starting near İzmir&#x27;s historic square that carries the same name as the district (Konak Square) with the 19th century-built Pasaport Quay marking the point, and extending along a 3200-meter-long seaside street and promenade called &quot;Kordon&quot; (esplanade, or more specifically as Birinci Kordon, ) and to join the neighboring metropolitan district of Bornova, located eastwards and at the very end of the Gulf&#x27;s waters.

Within this larger notional zone of Alsancak, aside from the officially instituted and delimited quarter (&quot;mahalle&quot;) of Alsancak proper, the five neighbouring quarters of Umurbey, Kültür, Mimar Sinan, İsmet Kaptan and Akdeniz are found along the shore, and the whole is generally referred to as being part of the same complex.

In Ottoman times, the area was named &quot;La Punta&quot; (an Italian word meaning &quot;the cape&quot;; the name cited as &quot;La Pointe&quot; in French sources or in sources that borrow from them) and was the part of the city where the upper middle class was concentrated.

==Physical aspects==
Two large streets parallel to the coastline, named the First Kordon and the Second Kordon (), constitute the main arterial roads of the quarter. A level area situated in an alluvial plain, with well-designed streets, modern apartment blocks and stores, the city&#x27;s trendiest and the most expensive and exclusive residences and commercial space are found here, as well as the busiest office buildings, including consulates.

Two major hotels in partnership with international brand names of the industry, Swissôtel and Hilton, are located towards the Konak end of the area, just behind the Square of the Republic () distinguishable by the wide space with which it marks a point along the length of the esplanade and an equestrian statue of Atatürk, to whose honor a museum in the premises of a former mansion is also present towards the eastern end of Alsancak.

The Atatürk Museum building, which is a survivor of the transformation in recent decades of coastline residences from terraced double-storey houses to apartment blocks, also offers visitors a chance to have a glimpse of how the lives of the wealthy in 19th century İzmir was like.

Many restaurants, bars, cafes, discothèques and other entertainment venues are concentrated in Alsancak, increasingly within the intact rows of older and more traditional one- or two-storied buildings found in the inner smaller streets and are often restored specifically for the purpose of the intended commercial activity. Kültürpark, the distinct location of the İzmir International Fair, is also englobed by the area of the quarter of Alsancak in both administrative and practical terms.

The newest and most attended synagogue of İzmir, &quot;Shar Hashamayim&quot; is also in Alsancak where increasing numbers of the city&#x27;s remaining Jews opt to live, moving in from their traditional neighborhood of Karataş.

The Port of İzmir, İzmir Alsancak Stadium and Alsancak Railway Station are also located in Alsancak.

==Alsancak Railway Station and Quay==

The Alsancak Railway Station (Turkish: Alsancak Tren Garı) is the oldest railway station in Turkey, built by the &quot;Oriental Railway Company&quot; (ORC) incorporated in 1856, to build a railway line from İzmir to Aydın. The main building of the station was completed in 1858 and the line to Aydin was opened in 1866. In 2001 the station was expanded from 4 tracks and 2 platforms, to 10 tracks and 6 platforms. In 2006 the station was closed to passenger traffic due to the İzmir Metro expansion project. The station keeps on handling freight traffic and is connected to the harbor which has an entry just across the street.

One of the quays of İzmir&#x27;s urban ferry services is also located in Alsancak, called under the same name, as Alsancak Quay . Ferries here crisscross between Konak and Pasaport further to the west and the busy residential and shopping area of Karşıyaka at the opposite coast.

<text>Champlain College is a private college in Burlington, Vermont, United States. Founded in 1878, Champlain offers on-campus undergraduate and online undergraduate courses through Champlain College Online, along with online certificate and degree programs and master&#x27;s degree programs, in over 80 subject areas. Champlain enrolls 3,060 undergraduate students on its Burlington campus from 40 states and 18 countries.

==History==
Champlain was founded in 1878 as Burlington Business School, opened by G.W. Thompson, to prepare young men for &quot;the business cares and responsibilities of life.&quot; In 1884, when E. George Evans acquired the school, it became coeducational and changed its name to Queen City Business College. In 1905, it moved to Bank Street, and in 1910 it moved again to Main Street. A. Gordon Tittemore acquired the college in 1920, and renamed it Burlington Business College. In 1958, the College took on its current name and moved to its present location in the Hill Section of Burlington. That year, it offered associate degree programs and enrolled about 60 students.

Champlain College opened its first dormitories, Jensen and Sanders Halls, in 1965. It started new programs in social services in the 1970s, opened the Willett Foster Hall, home to the Engineering Technology Division, in 1982, and added the Hauke Family Campus Center in 1989. Champlain offered its first bachelor&#x27;s degree programs in Business and Accounting in 1990; three years later it began its first online education programs. In 2002, Champlain launched its first master&#x27;s degree program in Managing Innovation &amp; Information Technology. 
The College&#x27;s library, the Robert E. and Holly D. Miller Information Commons, opened in 1998 and in 2004 the school dedicated the S.D. Ireland Family Center for Global Business &amp; Technology, home to the Stiller School of Business. The following year, the IDX Student Life Center opened. Also in 2005, David F. Finney was inaugurated as the Champlain&#x27;s seventh president, and the College added a Master of Business Administration as its second master&#x27;s degree.

In 2006, President David F. Finney launched several initiatives, including the Emergent Media Center; the Champlain College Center for Digital Investigation, now called the Senator Patrick Leahy Center for Digital Investigations; and the Conference and Event Center. Champlain also introduced two scholarship programs: the New American Student Scholarship, for students with refugee or asylum status, and the Vermont First Scholarship for first-generation college students from Vermont, and the College launched its BYOBiz program, which promotes student entrepreneurship.

In 2007, the College opened a study-abroad campus in Montreal, Canada, followed by second study-abroad campus in Dublin, Ireland in 2008. Later that year, Champlain established the Core Division, followed by the Life Experience &amp; Action Dimension (LEAD) program in 2009.

In 2010, Champlain began offering an MFA in Emergent Media and a BS in Environmental Policy, and introduced the Center for Financial Literacy and the Champlain College Publishing Initiative. That same year, Roger H. Perry Hall was renovated. Perry Hall received LEED Platinum certification in 2012, and houses the Advising and Registration Center, Admissions, Financial Aid, Public Relations, and serves as a general purpose Student Welcome Center. In October 2012, Champlain College received the largest gift in its history, a gift of $10 million from the Stiller Family Foundation that established the Stiller School of Business and funded the Perry Hall Welcome and Admission Center, as well as to begin work on the Center for Communications &amp; Creative Media, which opened in the fall of 2015. In fall of 2013, Champlain was featured in an article in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, &quot;What Would an Ideal College Look Like? A Lot Like This,&quot; as part of the magazine&#x27;s &quot;American Futures&quot; series, which looked at American cities that are home to innovations and entrepreneurship.

President David F. Finney retired in June 2014, and Donald J. Laackman, president of Harold Washington College, became Champlain&#x27;s eighth president in July 2014.

Starting with the class of 2011, general education was taught in the form of an interdisciplinary core curriculum. Each course brings together three or four discrete disciplines with the use of various literature and open-ended discussion topics. First-year courses focus on the self, second-year on the community, and third year on global topics. Through courses such as Rhetoric, Concepts of the Self, and Concepts of Community, students gain a background in the liberal arts and sciences. One part of the curriculum is the mandatory &quot;Global Module,&quot; a guided discussion forum between Champlain students and students from other countries.

In the fall of 2008, incoming students began to participate in an out-of-the-classroom life skills program. This life skills program, called the Life Experience and Action Dimension or LEAD, is part of Champlain&#x27;s Education in 3-D initiative. LEAD aims to build knowledge in four areas: understanding personality styles, building inclusive community, lifelong career management, and financial sophistication.

<doc id="533088" wikidata="Q82334" url="?curid=533088" title="Filey">
<text>Filey () is a seaside town and civil parish in North Yorkshire, England. It is located between Scarborough and Bridlington on Filey Bay. Although it was a fishing village, it has a large beach and became a popular tourist resort.
According to the 2011 UK census, Filey parish had a population of 6,981, in comparison to the 2001 UK census population figure of 6,819, and a population of 6,870 in 1991.

Filey was historically mainly within the East Riding of Yorkshire, although until 1888 a small part of the town, including its parish church, was in the North Riding of Yorkshire. In 1974 the town was transferred to the new county of North Yorkshire.

==Geography==
Filey is at the eastern end of the Cleveland Way, a long-distance footpath; it starts at Helmsley and skirts the North York Moors. It was the second National Trail to be opened (1969). The town is at the northern end of the Yorkshire Wolds Way National Trail which starts at Hessle and crosses the Yorkshire Wolds. Filey is the finishing point for Great Yorkshire Bike Ride. The ride begins at Wetherby Racecourse.

Filey has a railway station on the Yorkshire Coast Line. A second station at Filey Holiday Camp railway station to the south of the town served the former Butlins holiday camp. The camp has since been re-developed into a 600-home holiday housing development, The Bay Filey. It is one of the largest coastal developments of this kind in the UK and the first homes were completed in 2007.

In July 2007 Filey was hit by flash floods which caused major problems.
==History==

In 1857 the foundations of a 4th-century Roman signal station were discovered at the Carr Naze cliff edge at the northern end of Filey Bay. The structure is long with a square tower wide, a defensive ditch and ramparts from a later era. Excavations at the time of the find and subsequently in the 1920s and 1990s uncovered Roman pottery and hoards of coins. The site is a protected Scheduled Monument. The find of Roman remains supports the case for Filey being the Roman settlement of &quot;Portus Felix&quot;.

The 12th century parish church dedicated to St Oswald, on Church Hill in the north of the town, is a Grade I listed building. It is the oldest building in Filey and Nicholas Pevsner wrote &quot;This is easily the finest church in the NE corner of the East Riding&quot; (Buildings of England). St Oswald&#x27;s has nearly 1,500 pieces of well-preserved medieval graffiti on the roof of the tower, ranging from initials up to complicated images of fully rigged sailing vessels, including one known as a Whitby Cat. The graffiti covers around 400 years of Filey&#x27;s history, and maps out identifiable people, their occupations, changes in literacy and coastal shipping, the start of tourism in the area, and even a possible record of 17th century plague. The graffiti was recorded and analysed by Historic England in 2016.

Filey was a small village until the 18th century when visitors from Scarborough arrived seeking the peace and quiet that Filey then offered. In 1835 a Birmingham solicitor called John Wilkes Unett bought of land and built the Crescent, later known as the Royal Crescent, which was opened in the 1850s. On several occasions in the mid-19th century, the novelist Charlotte Brontë visited Filey with the aim of recovering her faltering health. In June 1852 she wrote to her father: &quot;The Sea is very grand. Yesterday it was a somewhat unusually high tide - and I stood about an hour on the cliffs yesterday afternoon - watching the tumbling in of great tawny turbid waves - that make the whole shore white with foam and filled the air with a sound hollower and deeper than thunder.

Fishing at Filey has been a tradition for centuries, with most of those undertaking it coming from a long line of fishermen and women in their families. The fishing boats at Filey are cobles, like most of the others along the Yorkshire and North East coasts, and the catch is mostly sea trout. Limitations have been placed upon how and where they use their nets, which also trap salmon; some fear this may lead to the end of the fishing industry in Filey. In 1804, a lifeboat was procured for the town and it became a Royal National Lifeboat Institution asset in 1852. Filey Lifeboat Station is still in existence and has an inshore and an all-weather boat on station. The all-weather lifeboat was replaced in early 2021 with an Atlantic 85 vessel.

English composer Frederick Delius stayed as a boy on the Crescent with his family at Miss Hurd&#x27;s boarding house (number 24) in 1876 and 1877, and then at Mrs Colley&#x27;s (number 24) in 1897.

In 1931 the spire of a church was damaged by the Dogger Bank earthquake.

For more than 40 years Butlin&#x27;s Filey Holiday Camp was a major factor in Filey&#x27;s economy. Building began in 1939 and continued during the Second World War when it became an air force station known as RAF Hunmanby Moor. In 1945 it became a popular holiday resort and a new LNER branch line with station was constructed to serve the camp despite the topographical challenges involved. It opened on 10 May 1947 with a performance by the London International Orchestra conducted by Anatole Fistoulari with a performance by acclaimed pianist Solomon. British boxer Bruce Woodcock was convalescing at the Butlin&#x27;s camp around the same time following his punishing defeat at the hands of Joe Baksi a month earlier. By the late 1950s it could cater for 10,000 holiday makers but closed in 1984, causing a decrease in the holiday makers visiting Filey.

Filey was historically split between the East Riding of Yorkshire and the North Riding of Yorkshire. The boundary ran along Filey Beck, north of the town centre, so that most of the town was in the East Riding. When County Councils were formed by the Local Government Act 1888, the whole of Filey was placed in the East Riding.

Filey also boasts the Grade II listed Langford Villa on The Crescent () which was often chosen by the famous chocolatier Sir Joseph Terry as his place to &quot;summer&quot;; it is situated next door but one to The White Lodge Hotel.

In 2018, the town was featured in the Tour de Yorkshire for the first time.

==Governance==

At the lowest level of governance is Filey Town Council, electing a total of thirteen councillors. These councillors are responsible for burial grounds, allotments, play areas and some street lighting. Elections to the town council are held every four years and the most recent elections were held in May 2019. The Mayor of Filey is elected annually by the members of the town council. The council is based at Filey Town Council Offices on Queen Street.

At district level, the town was part of the Scarborough Borough Council area. The town was represented by three councillors on the Borough Council. On the North Yorkshire County Council the town elected one representative. Both councils were abolished in 2023 and replaced with a unitary authority, North Yorkshire Council.

===Parliamentary representation===
Filey was in the Ryedale constituency until the 2010 general election when it became part of the newly formed Thirsk and Malton constituency. Proposed boundary changes to the constituencies, would see Filey be moved from Thirsk and Malton into the Scarborough and Whitby constituency.

==Development==
Coast &amp; Country Housing Limited plan to build 300 houses in Filey. Scarborough council has approved plans for the £45 million housing project off Muston Road by Coast &amp; Country. Independent councillor Sam Cross, who represents Filey on the borough council, said: &quot;The infrastructure of the town can&#x27;t cope with it.&quot;
Coast and Country replied to the concerns by stating that the houses are being built to meet a pent-up latent demand for affordable housing and other housing within the town.

==Local media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire. Television signals are received from the Oliver&#x27;s Mount and via a local relay transmitter at Hunmanby. BBC North East and Cumbria and ITV Tyne Tees can also be received from the Bilsdale TV transmitter.

Filey’s local radio stations are BBC Radio York on 95.5 FM, Greatest Hits Radio Yorkshire Coast on 96.2 FM, Coast &amp; County Radio on 97.4 FM and This is The Coast that broadcasts online and on DAB. 

Local newspapers are &quot;Filey Bay Today&quot; and &quot;The Scarborough News&quot;.

<doc id="533089" wikidata="Q775342" url="?curid=533089" title="Head of the Charles Regatta">
<text>The Head of the Charles Regatta, also known as HOCR, is a rowing head race held on the penultimate complete weekend of October (i.e., on the Friday that falls between the 16th and the 22nd of the month, and on the Saturday and Sunday immediately afterwards) each year on the Charles River, which separates Boston and Cambridge, Massachusetts United States. It is the largest 3-day regatta in the world, with 11,000 athletes rowing in over 2,500 boats in 73 events. According to the Greater Boston Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau, the three-day event brings 225,000 people to the Greater Boston area and $72 million to the local economy.

The last races of the Regatta are generally the most prestigious: Championship 4s, and Championship 8s (both men and women). Championship sculling events (1x/single and 2x/double) race on Saturday afternoon. The Championship events usually include U.S. National Team athletes, as well as national team athletes from other top rowing nations.

The competitive field includes individual and team competitors from colleges, high schools, and clubs from nearly all American states and various countries. The 2006 field included rowers from China, South Africa, Croatia, Ireland, and the Netherlands. The age of athletes spans from 14 to 85 years old with experience levels from novice to Olympic. In 2007, approximately 10% of the field was international.

==Course==
The course is three miles (4,800 meters) long and stretches from the start at Boston University&#x27;s DeWolfe Boathouse near the Charles River Basin to the finish just after the Eliot Bridge and before Northeastern University&#x27;s Henderson Boathouse. The course is renowned for being challenging for crews to navigate without incident or penalty. The course contains six bridges, which appear in this order from the start:

The Weeks and Eliot Bridges fall at sharp turns in the course, and collisions occur here more than any other part of the course.

==Racing regulations==
Crews start the race at 15-second intervals. The starting order is based on the crew&#x27;s finishing time in the previous year, with the top finisher from the prior year leaving first, the second finisher leaving second, and so on. Crews that did not compete in the prior year are seeded after all prior year entrants in a random order, although race organizers have some discretion in the seeding process. Having presumably faster crews start ahead of presumably slower crews reduces the amount of passing boats must make during the race, reducing the potential for boating accidents. However, passing almost always occurs, and penalties are imposed on crews that do not follow passing regulations, such as failing to yield to a boat that closes to within one boat length of open water.

==History==

=== First year ===
The Head of the Charles Regatta was first organized in 1965 by Cambridge Boat Club members D&#x27;Arcy MacMahon, Howard McIntyre, and Jack Vincent. The members of the boat club thought that a fall regatta would be an entertaining way to break up the monotony of the training season for colleges and boat clubs in the area. D&#x27;Arcy MacMahon had been the captain of the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s lightweight varsity three seasons earlier. They initially had little hope the regatta would be a success, it was the wrong time of year and it wasn&#x27;t expected to draw any spectators.

Harvard University sculling instructor Ernest Arlett provided the idea for the head race. George Ernest Arlett came to the US because in England only &quot;gentlemen&quot; could race. Even when Arlett brought Northeastern University&#x27;s rowing team to Henley Royal Regatta and the team members were invited, the team entered by the front door and Mr. Arlett still had to enter by the rear or servants door. Class snobbery or pedigree was still in force.

Despite their reservations, the founders of the regatta were determined to see it become a success. In an interview with New York Times, Jerry Olrich and MacMahon identified that this regatta was &quot;destined to become a classic&quot;

The Regatta expanded to a two-day event in 1997 and again to a three-day event in 2021.

In 1991, Frederick V. Schoch was appointed Executive Director of the Regatta, and he continues to oversee the event.

===Charity program===
Since 1998, the Head of the Charles Regatta&#x27;s Charity Program has generated over $1,000,000 for its official charities, which include Cambridge Community Foundation and Community Rowing, Inc. The Charity Program allows competitors to gain an automatic entry into the Regatta in exchange for raising $1250 per person, per entry. Under official rules, any single, double, four, or eight is eligible to enter.

===Cancellations===
The race has been cancelled only twice: in 1996 due to storm bringing heavy rain and wind, and in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. (An online version in the fall of 2020 replaced the in-person race.)

==Awards==
First place medals are awarded to winning competitors in each event category of the race. The first place medals are struck bronze medallions that are 2.5 inches in diameter. They show a single sculler from above on the front, and are engraved with the year and event on the back. Only the first place medals are distributed at the Regatta on Saturday and Sunday evenings following the races. Medals for second and third place medallions are of the same design, but are 1.75 inches in diameter. The Regatta issues additional subordinate medals according to the number of entries in the race as well. 

1–9 Entries: up to 1st place awarded

10–19 Entries: up to 2nd place awarded

20–29 Entries: up to 3rd place awarded

30–39 Entries: up to 4th place awarded

40+ Entries: up to 5th place awarded

Special winner medals (2.5 inches in diameter) engraved (a) COLLEGE-CHAMPIONSHIP, (b) LIGHTWEIGHT, (c) CLUB, or (d) UNDER-17 shall be awarded respectively to (a) the fastest crew made up of undergraduates representing accredited/chartered Colleges or Universities in each event-division of the Championship 2x, Championship 4+ and Championship 8+, (b) the fastest Lightweight crew in the Championship 2x, (c) the fastest crew unaffiliated with an academic institution in each event-division of the Club 4+ and Club 8+, (d) the fastest U17 crew in the Youth Single, Youth Double, Youth Coxed Quad, Youth Four, and Youth Eight, and (e) the fastest JV entry in the Men’s and Women’s Championship Eight. 

Special medals are also issued to the most competitive Grand-Veteran scullers in the Senior-Veteran Singles Event; the fastest Veteran crews in the Senior-Master 2x, 4+, and 8+ events; the fastest Grand-Master crews in the Senior-Master 2x, 4+, and 8+ events.

Because of the 2020 cancellation caused by the global pandemic, the 2021 regatta awarded a special medal to the fastest Class of 2020 crew in the Alumni Four and Alumni Eight (crew must be at least 75% 2020 graduates, coxswain excluded).

Winners of special medals will not be awarded subordinate medals should they qualify. No special medal will be awarded if the first place medal winner also qualifies for a special medal.

<doc id="533106" wikidata="Q1384471" url="?curid=533106" title="Experimentum crucis">
<text>In science, an experimentum crucis (English: crucial experiment or critical experiment) is an experiment capable of decisively determining whether or not a particular hypothesis or theory is superior to all other hypotheses or theories whose acceptance is currently widespread in the scientific community. In particular, such an experiment must typically be able to produce a result that rules out all other hypotheses or theories if true, thereby demonstrating that under the conditions of the experiment (i.e., under the same external circumstances and for the same &quot;input variables&quot; within the experiment), those hypotheses and theories are &quot;proven false&quot; but the experimenter&#x27;s hypothesis &quot;is not ruled out&quot;. 

An opposite view, rejecting the decisive value of the &quot;experimentum crucis&quot; in choosing one hypothesis or theory over its rivals, is the Duhem–Quine thesis.

==History==
Francis Bacon in his &quot;Novum Organum&quot; first described the concept of a situation in which one theory but not others would hold true, using the name instantia crucis; the phrase &quot;experimentum crucis&quot;, denoting the deliberate creation of such a situation for the purpose of testing the rival theories, was later coined by Robert Hooke and then famously used by Isaac Newton.

The production of such an experiment is considered necessary for a particular hypothesis or theory to be considered an established part of the body of scientific knowledge. It is not unusual in the history of science for theories to be developed fully before producing a critical experiment. A given theory which is in accordance with known experiment but which has not yet produced a critical experiment is typically considered worthy of exploration in order to discover such an experimental test.

==Examples==
Robert Boyle was the first person to hail an experiment as &quot;experimentum crucis&quot; when he referred to the famous mercury barometer experiment on Puy-de-Dome in 1648. This experiment settled the question: Was there some natural resistance to the creation of an apparently empty space at the top of the tube, or was the height of the mercury determined solely by the weight of the air? 

In his &quot;Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot;, Isaac Newton (1687) presents a disproof of Descartes&#x27; vortex theory of the motion of the planets. In his &quot;Opticks&quot;, Newton describes an optical &quot;experimentum crucis&quot; in the &quot;First Book, Part I, Proposition II, Theorem II, Experiment 6&quot;, to prove that sunlight consists of rays that differ in their index of refraction.

A 19th-century example was the prediction by Poisson, based on Fresnel&#x27;s mathematical analysis, that the wave theory of light predicted a bright spot in the center of the shadow of a perfectly circular object, a result that could not be explained by the (then current) particle theory of light. An experiment by François Arago showed the existence of this effect, now called the Arago spot, or &quot;Poisson&#x27;s bright spot&quot;, which led to the acceptance of the wave theory.

A famous example in the 20th century of an &quot;experimentum crucis&quot; was the expedition led by Arthur Eddington to Principe Island in Africa in 1919 to record the positions of stars around the Sun during a solar eclipse (see Eddington experiment). The observation of star positions confirmed predictions of gravitational lensing made by Albert Einstein in the general theory of relativity published in 1915. Eddington&#x27;s observations were considered to be the first solid evidence in favor of Einstein&#x27;s theory.

In some cases, a proposed theory can account for existing anomalous experimental results for which no other existing theory can furnish an explanation. An example would be the ability of the quantum hypothesis, proposed by Max Planck in 1900, to account for the observed black-body spectrum, an experimental result that the existing classical Rayleigh–Jeans law could not predict. Such cases are not considered strong enough to fully establish a new theory, however, and in the case of quantum mechanics, it took the confirmation of the theory through &quot;new&quot; predictions for the theory to gain full acceptance.
===DNA, experimentum crucis===
:&quot;See §Context for crucial experiment in the discovery of the §structure of DNA, and §List of experiments in biology&quot;
In the discovery of the significance of the structure of DNA, the fact that DNA was a double helix enabled the discoverers, Francis Crick and James Watson, to suggest that one strand of the double helix could serve as the template for the second strand, as the second strand was being duplicated. This explained the &quot;secret of life&quot;, how the structure of DNA could serve as the mechanism for the gene (the genetic code), in which four nucleotides serve to encode the sequence of enzymes needed to catalyze the production of macromolecules in the cell, and which led to its application in synthetic biology, in genetic engineering, in forensics, genetic testing, genomics and pharmaceuticals, among other industries.

===Tanis fossil site===

In the 21st century, the discovery of the Tanis fossil site, a killing field in the Hell Creek formation of North Dakota, proved that the K-T boundary (now known as the KPg, or the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event) was the same event (the Chicxulub impact) which killed off the dinosaurs. This impact event was previously hypothesized from the global existence of iridium deposits 
(a rare element on Earth). In this case, the existence of a microtektite layer raining down upon the multiple intermixed species (including a Triceratops) which were found at the site (the Tanis Konservat-Lagerstätte) served as the conclusive witness, as cited in &quot;Science Daily&quot;. Based on the dating of the Tanis, the event occurred 65.76 million years ago (± 0.15 My).

=== Theory of Experimentum Crucis ===

There&#x27;s an emerging scholarship extending understanding and evaluation of experiments that fit into this category. J. A. Lohne tracks the development of the idea from Francis Bacon&#x27;s 1620 Instantie Crucis through the various prism optics experiments and discussions of 1722. 

An early indicator of a theory of Experimentum Crucis appears in John Locke&#x27;s Doctrine of Abstraction.

Lorne Falkenstein, reviewing Van Cleve expands the discussion of Experimentum crucis to the more general philosophical realm of Property dualism.

===San Diego Chargers===
On March 30, 1992, he was signed in Plan B free agency by the San Diego Chargers and was switched to center. He was originally allocated to play with the London Monarchs of the World League of American Football, where he appeared in 5 games, before signing on April 22 with the Barcelona Dragons and playing in one contest. He was released at end of preseason on August 31.

===San Francisco 49ers (first stint)===
On May 3, 1993, he was signed as a free agent by the San Francisco 49ers to play tackle and was cut after the season opener on September 7.

===Indianapolis Colts===
On September 9, 1993, he was signed by the Indianapolis Colts to play tackle. He was declared inactive in 4 games. He was released on October 13, after getting into a shouting match with a defensive coach over the injury to a wide receiver in practice.

===San Francisco (second stint)===
On November 11, 1993, he was signed to the San Francisco 49ers&#x27; practice squad and was released two weeks later on December 1.

===Dallas Cowboys (first stint)===
On December 7, 1993, he was signed by the Dallas Cowboys to the practice squad. On December 22, he was promoted to the active roster for depth purposes, after Mark Stepnoski was lost for the season with a right knee injury. He was declared inactive for Super Bowl XXVIII. He was released on August 17, 1994.

===Philadelphia Eagles===
On August 23, 1994, he signed with the Philadelphia Eagles. He was released two days later on August 25.

===Dallas Cowboys (second stint)===
On October 25, 1994, he was signed by the Dallas Cowboys, to provide depth after offensive tackle Erik Williams suffered season-ending injuries in a car accident. On November 1, he was released after one week to make room for offensive tackle Jerry Reynolds.

===Pittsburgh Steelers===
On February 22, 1995, he was signed as a free agent with the Pittsburgh Steelers and made the team as a reserve tackle. On September 24, against the Minnesota Vikings, he had his only career start, while playing left tackle in place of an injured John Jackson. He was a part of the team that lost to the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl XXX. He was cut on August 25, 1996.

===New York Jets===
On August 29, 1996, he signed with the New York Jets to provide depth at tackle after Jumbo Elliott and David Williams were injured. He was released on October 8.

===Chicago Bears===

===Montreal Alouettes===
On April 1, 1998, the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League traded linebacker Henry Newby and defensive tackle Juan Hammonds to the Hamilton Tiger-Cats for the CFL&#x27;s negotiation-list rights to Parrish. On May 26, he was signed by the Alouettes. He was cut before the start of the season.

===Kansas City Chiefs===
On February 8, 1999, he was signed by the Kansas City Chiefs. He was released on August 31.

==Personal life==
Parrish worked for Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley after his retirement. A self-taught computer expert, he was one of the first athletes to launch his own website. On March 10, 2004, he died at the age of 35, after battling cancer.

<doc id="533109" wikidata="Q650187" url="?curid=533109" title="Phosphatidylcholine">
<text>Phosphatidylcholines (PC) are a class of phospholipids that incorporate choline as a .
They are a major component of biological membranes and can easily be obtained from a variety of readily available sources, such as egg yolk or soybeans, from which they are mechanically or chemically extracted using hexane. They are also a member of the lecithin group of yellow-brownish fatty substances occurring in animal and plant tissues. Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (lecithin) is a major component of the pulmonary surfactant, and is often used in the lecithin–sphingomyelin ratio to calculate fetal lung maturity. While phosphatidylcholines are found in all plant and animal cells, they are absent in the membranes of most bacteria, including &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;. Purified phosphatidylcholine is produced commercially.

The name &quot;lecithin&quot; was derived from Greek λέκιθος, &quot;lekithos&quot; &#x27;egg yolk&#x27; by Theodore Nicolas Gobley, a French chemist and pharmacist of the mid-19th century, who applied it to the egg yolk phosphatidylcholine that he identified in 1847. Gobley eventually completely described his lecithin from chemical structural point of view, in 1874. Phosphatidylcholines are such a major component of lecithin that in some contexts the terms are sometimes used as synonyms. However, lecithin extracts consist of a mixture of phosphatidylcholine and other compounds. It is also used along with sodium taurocholate for simulating fed- and fasted-state biorelevant media in dissolution studies of highly lipophilic drugs.

Phosphatidylcholine is a major constituent of cell membranes and pulmonary surfactant, and is more commonly found in the exoplasmic or outer leaflet of a cell membrane. It is thought to be transported between membranes within the cell by phosphatidylcholine transfer protein (PCTP).

Phosphatidylcholine also plays a role in membrane-mediated cell signaling and PCTP activation of other enzymes.

==Structure and physical properties==

This phospholipid is composed of a choline head group and glycerophosphoric acid, with a variety of fatty acids. Usually, one is a saturated fatty acid (in the given figure, this is palmitic acid (hexadecanoic acid, H3C-(CH2)14-COOH); margaric acid (heptadecanoic acid, H3C-(CH2)15-COOH), identified by Gobley in egg yolk, also belong to that class); and the other is an unsaturated fatty acid (here oleic acid, or 9Z-octadecenoic acid, as in Gobley&#x27;s original egg yolk lecithin). However, there are also examples of disaturated species. Animal lung phosphatidylcholine, for example, contains a high proportion of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine.

Phospholipase D catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine to form phosphatidic acid (PA), releasing the soluble choline headgroup into the cytosol.

==Possible health benefits==

===Senescence===
A 2009 systematic review of clinical trials in humans found that there was not enough evidence to support supplementation of lecithin or phosphatidylcholine in dementia. The study found that a moderate benefit could not be ruled out until further large scale studies were performed.

===Lipolysis===
Though phosphatidylcholine has been studied as an alternative to liposuction, no peer-reviewed study has shown it to have comparable effects. Injection of phosphatidylcholine in lipomas has been studied, but the results have been mixed.

===Ulcerative colitis===
Treatment of ulcerative colitis with oral intake of phosphatidylcholine has been shown to result in decreased disease activity.

== Biosynthesis ==
Although multiple pathways exist for the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine, the predominant route in eukaryotes involves condensation between diacylglycerol (DAG) and cytidine 5&#x27;-diphosphocholine (CDP-choline or citicoline). The conversion is mediated by the enzyme diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase. Another pathway, mainly operative in the liver involves methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine with &quot;S&quot;-adenosyl methionine (SAM) being the methyl group donor.

<text>The &quot;Spruance&quot;-class destroyer was developed by the United States to replace the many World War II–built - and s, and was the primary destroyer built for the United States Navy during the 1970s and 1980s. It was named in honor of U.S. Navy Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, who successfully led major naval battles in the Asiatic-Pacific Theater during World War II such as the Battle of Midway and the Battle of the Philippine Sea.

Introduced in 1975, the class was designed with gas-turbine propulsion, a flight deck and hangar for up to two medium-lift helicopters, all-digital weapons, and automated 127 mm (5-inch) guns. The &quot;Spruance&quot; class was originally designed to escort a carrier group, primarily for anti-submarine warfare (ASW), with point-defense anti-aircraft warfare (AAW) missiles and limited anti-ship capabilities. Two dozen members of the class were upgraded with Tomahawk cruise missiles for land attack. The Navy retired the class somewhat earlier than planned, decommissioning the last ship in 2005. Most &quot;Spruance&quot;s were broken up or destroyed as targets. Its hull form and propulsion plant were adopted as the foundation of the &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class cruisers constructed in the 1980s. The class was succeeded as the main U.S. destroyer by the &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyer.

==History==

===Design===
Much larger than other destroyers of the era, the &quot;Spruance&quot;s were comparable in size to contemporary guided-missile cruisers (CG and CGN) and U.S. Navy light cruisers (CL) in World War II. This allowed them to accommodate a helicopter flight deck, a first for a U.S. Navy destroyer, and an enclosed hangar with space for up to two medium-lift helicopters, a first for a U.S. Navy destroyer or cruiser. The &quot;Spru-cans&quot; were the first large U.S. Navy ships to use gas turbine propulsion: four General Electric LM2500 gas turbines that generated about 80,000 horsepower (60 MW). This configuration (developed in the 1960s by the Royal Canadian Navy for the s and known as COmbined Gas And Gas, or COGAG) was very successful and used on most subsequent U.S. warships. As of 2010, all U.S. Navy surface combatants (except nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and the LCS-1) used the LM2500 COGAG arrangement, usually with two turbines per shaft.

The ships were initially controversial, especially among members of the United States Congress who believed that their unimposing looks, and their original armament of two guns and an ASROC and Sea Sparrow missile launcher, implied that the vessels were weak compared to Soviet designs that carried large numbers of anti-ship missiles. The &quot;Spruance&quot; class was also unfavorably compared to earlier U.S. designs that had more visible guns or launchers for Standard medium-range missiles. Their advocates noted that they were successful in their intended ASW role due to their seaworthiness, quiet operation, and ability to operate two helicopters.

The &quot;Spruance&quot; class received the &quot;DD&quot; designation in the hull classification symbol system which was previously applied to gun destroyers, although their primary armament as designed was missiles. However, their original complement of 8 Sea Sparrow anti-aircraft missiles was only sufficient for point defense, compared to other American destroyers designated as DDG which were designed to provide anti-aircraft warfare screening to the fleet, while some newer DDG ships further added surface-to-surface capabilities for anti-ship or land strike. In the early 1980s, the class received quadruple Harpoon missile launchers that were installed amidships. Six members of the class received Armored Box Launchers for Tomahawk surface-to-surface missiles, while a major update from the mid-1980s for 24 members of the class added a 61-cell Vertical Launch System (VLS) for the Tomahawk. Despite these upgrades, the class retained their DD classification as they lacked the area anti-aircraft capabilities of guided-missile cruisers (CG and CGN) and destroyers (DDG).

=== Contracts ===
Until the class was named for Admiral Spruance, the acquisition effort had been known as the DX program. It aimed to award the production contract for the entire class of 30 ships to a single shipyard, under the Total Package Procurement concept originated by the Whiz Kids of Robert McNamara&#x27;s Pentagon. The idea was to reap the benefits of mass construction. After a selection process &quot;noted for political influence and shifting rules,&quot; the entire contract was awarded on 23 June 1970 to the Litton-Ingalls shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi. Labor and technical problems caused cost overruns and delayed construction.

One additional ship, , was ordered on 29 September 1979. &quot;Hayler&quot; was originally planned as a DDH (Destroyer, Helicopter) design, which would carry more anti-submarine helicopters than the standard design of the &quot;Spruance&quot; class. Eventually this plan to build a DDH was scrapped and a slightly modified DD-963 class hull was put in commission.

Four additional ships were built originally for the Iranian Navy with the Mark 26/Standard AAW missile system and commissioned as the &quot;Kidd&quot;s for the U.S. Navy. The &quot;Kidd&quot;-class destroyers used the same hull as the &quot;Spruance&quot;s but they were more advanced general-purpose ships with area anti-air warfare capabilities that the &quot;Spruance&quot; class lacked. It was once planned to build all of the &quot;Spruance&quot; class up to this standard, but it was too expensive. A slightly lengthened version of the hull was also used for the s, originally planned as DDG-47-class destroyers but redesignated as cruisers in 1980 to emphasize the additional capability provided by the ships&#x27; Aegis combat systems, and their flag facilities suitable for an admiral and his staff.

An air-capable mini V/STOL aircraft carrier with fighters and ASW helicopters based on the &quot;Spruance&quot; hull was seriously considered but not produced.

===Upgrades===
The &quot;Spruance&quot; design is modular in nature, allowing for easy installation of entire subsystems within the ship. Although originally designed for anti-submarine warfare, seven vessels—&quot;Comte de Grasse&quot;, &quot;Merrill&quot;, &quot;Conolly&quot;, &quot;John Rodgers&quot;, &quot;Leftwich&quot;, &quot;Deyo&quot;, and &quot;Ingersoll—&quot;were initially upgraded with the installation of pair of four-round Armored Box Launchers (ABL) for the Tomahawk cruise missile, one each side of the ASROC launcher, giving them a land attack capability. 23 of the remaining vessels then received a more comprehensive upgrade with the installation of a 61-cell Mark 41 Vertical Launch Missile System (VLS) forward, replacing the ASROC launcher and allowing for a greater weapons load to be carried. One of the ABL ships, &quot;Deyo&quot;, also received the VLS upgrade while &quot;Harry W. Hill&quot; was the only &quot;Spruance&quot; that did not receive the Tomahawk as its VLS upgrade was cancelled. &quot;Hill&quot; and the remaining 6 ABL-equipped ships were the first of the class to be withdrawn from service.

*&quot;Merrill&quot; served as the Navy&#x27;s test platform for the Tomahawk Cruise Missile Program receiving armored box launchers and test launching a Tomahawk on 19 March 1980. &quot;Merrill&quot; carried two ABLs and an ASROC launcher into the 1990s until the ASROC launcher was removed.
*&quot;David R. Ray&quot; tested the RAM system in the 1980s, but had the system removed after the tests.
*&quot;Oldendorf&quot; was the test platform for the &quot;AN/SPQ-9B&quot; Anti-ship Missile Defense (ASMD) Fire control Radar to be outfitted on the s. The AN/SPQ-9B is used to detect all known and projected sea-skimming missiles.
*&quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; tested the Advanced Enclosed Mast/Sensor system which helped in the mast design of the &quot;San Antonio&quot;-class amphibious transport dock ships.

At least ten VLS ships, including &quot;Cushing&quot;, &quot;O&#x27;Bannon&quot;, and &quot;Thorn&quot;, had a 21-cell Mark 49 RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile launcher mounted on the starboard fantail.

&quot;Spruance&quot;-class destroyers fired 112 land attack Tomahawks during Operation Desert Storm.

===Decommissioning===
In order to save $28 million a year, the Navy accelerated the decommissioning of the &quot;Spruance&quot; class, though they could have served to 2019 had they been maintained and updated. Despite the recent modifications to the &quot;Spruance&quot; and &quot;Kidd&quot; classes, they were still considered expensive and manpower-intensive to operate, while the succeeding &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; class were more capable and versatile due to their Aegis combat system while also being more cost-efficient, and by the end of the 1990s, many &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyers had entered the fleet. While the early Flight I &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; ships only had a flight deck, Flight IIA and subsequent vessels added the enclosed hangar which made their aviation facilities comparable to the &quot;Spruance&quot; class.

The Navy planned to replace its current destroyers and cruisers with the new (DDG-1000) destroyers, but the 2010 Defense budget funded the construction of only three DDG-1000s. Production of &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; class continued and it became the U.S. Navy&#x27;s only operational class of destroyers after the , the last &quot;Spruance&quot;-class destroyer on active service, was decommissioned on 21 September 2005. &quot;Cushing&quot; was unsuccessfully offered to the Pakistan Navy before being sunk as a target on 29 April 2009. The four &quot;Kidd&quot;-class destroyers were decommissioned in 1998 and were sold to Taiwan in 2005 and 2006.

Few &quot;Spruance&quot;s were preserved in storage like some older classes or offered up for sale to foreign navies. Some were broken up and most of the rest were sunk as targets in various fleet exercises. One exception is the ex-, which replaced the ex- in 2005 as the Self Defense Test Ship. The remote-controlled SDTS tows a target barge, allowing crews to fire live weapons at a ship-like moving target.

<doc id="533114" wikidata="Q1392118" url="?curid=533114" title="Harold B. Lee">
<text>Harold Bingham Lee (March 28, 1899 – December 26, 1973) was an American religious leader and educator who served as the 11th president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from July 1972 until his death in December 1973.

== Early life ==
Lee was born in Clifton, Idaho, to Samuel Lee and Louisa Emeline Bingham and was the second of six children. The Lee family lived the rural life and Lee and his siblings spent most of their youth doing farm chores. During his childhood, his mother saved him from death several times. When he was eight, he was sent to get a can of lye from the shelf and spilled the deadly product all over himself. His mother opened a vat of pickled beets and poured cup after cup of the red vinegar all over him, which neutralized the lye. When Harold was a teen, he punctured an artery on a broken bottle. His mother cleaned it, but it became badly infected. She burned a black stocking to ashes and rubbed it in the open wound and it soon healed.

Lee was fortunate to receive a good education. He finished eighth grade at a grammar school in Clifton and his parents allowed him to continue his education at Oneida Stake Academy in Preston, Idaho. The first few years, Lee focused on music and played the alto, French, and baritone horns. Later, he played basketball and was a reporter for the school newspaper. He graduated in the spring of 1916.

The summer following his graduation Lee worked to receive his teaching certificate from Albion State Normal School at Albion, Idaho. After two summers of study in 1916 and 1917, Lee passed the state&#x27;s fifteen-subject test to receive his second- and third-class certificates. Lee held his first teaching position in the fall of 1916. He taught a class of 25 students, grades one to eight, in Weston, Idaho. His salary was $60 a month. When he was eighteen, he became principal of a school in Oxford, Idaho. In September 1920, church president Heber J. Grant called Lee on a mission to the western states, with headquarters in Denver, Colorado. He was twenty-one and served until December 1922.

==Marriages==
While on his mission, Lee met a sister missionary from Utah, Fern Lucinda Tanner. They renewed their acquaintance when they returned from their missions and were married on November 14, 1923, in the Salt Lake Temple. Fern died in 1962 and on June 17, 1963, Lee married Freda Joan Jensen, a former mission companion&#x27;s girlfriend who had remained unmarried. She died on July 1, 1981.

==Civic and community leadership ==
In 1932, at age thirty-three, Lee became a community leader when he was appointed to fill a vacancy in the Salt Lake City Commission. He was assigned to direct the Department of Streets and Public Improvements. A year later his political career was launched when he was elected to the same position.

== Service in the LDS Church ==

In 1930, Lee was called as president of the LDS Church&#x27;s Pioneer Stake in Salt Lake City. At the time of his setting apart, he was the youngest stake president then serving in the church.

As the 1929 Great Depression in the United States had left more than half of the stakes&#x27; members without jobs, Lee established a stake welfare program to aid members in distress. In 1932, the stake organized a Bishop&#x27;s Storehouse to provide members with basic food necessities. In 1936, Lee became managing director of the Church Welfare Program, overseeing the implementation of a churchwide welfare program based on the Pioneer Stake&#x27;s. This program—including Bishop&#x27;s Storehouses—remains in place to this day.

Although he also pursued a political career, he began full-time church service when he was called to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in 1941.

Lee served on a committee to streamline church organization and functions. For two decades Lee studied the subject and prepared proposals. Lee was the chairman of the Priesthood Correlation Committee under LDS Church president David O. McKay. The committee restructured church organization in the 1960s, including labeling the children&#x27;s and women&#x27;s organizations as auxiliary to the priesthood organization.

According to some historians, Hugh B. Brown petitioned McKay to rescind the policy of excluding people of African ancestry from the priesthood. However, McKay had not felt spiritual impressions that the time was right to do so. Historians observe that Brown continued to seek to reverse the ban &quot;administratively&quot;, but Lee was among those who noted that it was a matter of God making his will known through revelation. In December 1969, Lee initiated a release to church leaders, signed by Brown and N. Eldon Tanner, both serving as counselors in the First Presidency. This release regarded the church&#x27;s support for equal opportunities and civil rights, but also indicated that priesthood policy would not change until God revealed it through revelation.

When McKay died in 1970, Joseph Fielding Smith became church president and Lee was called as First Counselor in the First Presidency. He continued to gain practical experience for what was expected to be a long presidency of his own, given the fact that he was twenty-four years younger than Smith. In 1972, Smith died and Lee became church president. Later that year, Lee organized the church&#x27;s Jerusalem Branch and presided over its second Area Conference, held in Mexico; and four months prior to his death, presided over the first Area Conference for Germany, Austria, Holland, Italy, Switzerland, France, Belgium, and Spain, held in Munich on August 24–26, 1973.

==Death==
Lee&#x27;s presidency proved one of the briefest in the history of the church, lasting from July 7, 1972, to Lee&#x27;s sudden death due to a fatal pulmonary hemorrhage on December 26, 1973, at age 74. Lee was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery.
==Legacy==

After his death, a statue of Lee was dedicated at his birthplace. Brigham Young University also honored the former church president by renaming its library after him. The Harold B. Lee Library is one of the largest libraries in the western United States and contains of shelving.

Lee&#x27;s teachings as an apostle were the 2002 course of study in the LDS Church&#x27;s Sunday Relief Society and Melchizedek priesthood classes.

<text>The title of the Hero of the Czechoslovak Republic was established in 1955. The name of the title was changed to Hero of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic in 1960. It was awarded 31 times to some Czechoslovak war heroes, to the general and later president Ludvík Svoboda, to the Czechoslovak president Gustáv Husák, to the Czech cosmonaut Vladimír Remek, to various Soviet generals and marshals, and to Leonid Brezhnev. The never-awarded 32nd medal has been given to the Czech National Museum.

The title was awarded by the government to honor extraordinary merits for the republic connected with a heroic achievement or repeated achievements.

The Hero was always also awarded the Order of Klement Gottwald in similar fashion to how a Hero of the Soviet Union was also always awarded the Order of Lenin, a Hero of the People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria was also awarded the Order of Georgi Dimitrov, and a Hero of the German Democratic Republic was also awarded the Order of Karl Marx.

The medal was worn on the left breast side above all the Czechoslovak awards or their ribbons, always in natura and in front of the Gold Star of the .

The title was canceled as a result of the 1989 Velvet Revolution, when the government of the new Czech and Slovak Federative Republic on 7 October 1990 enacted a law setting up a new, de-communized honors system. No new awards of the title have been permitted thenceforth, but existing awardees were (and are) still permitted to wear their medals.

<text>The Independent Order of Rechabites (IOR), also known as the Sons and Daughters of Rechab, is a fraternal organisation and friendly society founded in England in 1835 as part of the wider temperance movement to promote total abstinence from alcoholic beverages. The Order has been active in Australia from 1843, promoting temperance and as a benefit society. A branch was established in the United States in 1842, and also flourished for a time. In the United Kingdom, the Order trades under the name of Healthy Investment, being well connected in upper society and involved in financial matters; there it gradually transformed into a financial institution which promotes teetotalism.

== History ==
The Independent Order of Rechabites was founded on 25 August 1835 as the Salford Unity of Rechabites, in the city of Salford, Lancashire, England. Their first lodge was &quot;Tent Ebenezer #1&quot; and soon &quot;tents&quot; were founded for adult females (over the age of 12), boys (aged 12–16), and for children of both sexes (age 5-12), as well as other adult males (age 16 and up.) In describing the heritage of the Independent Order of Rechabites, a circa 1892 newspaper in Leeds said:
The rituals and ceremonies of the Rechabites vary from place to place but the order promoted three degrees, Knight of Temperance, Knight of Fortitude, and Covenanted Knight of Justice. Lodges are called tents because Jehonadab (or Jonadab) commanded the Biblical sons of Rechab to live in tents (Jeremiah 35:6-7) and the governing body, in England at least, was called the Movable Committee, meeting in a different city every two years. Membership remains open to all who would sign a pledge to completely abstain from alcohol except for religious or medical purposes. There were also death and sickness benefits.

From the late 18th century a number of Friendly Societies had been set up to help working-class people with such things as health insurance and death benefits. Generally these societies held their meetings in pubs. In the 1830s a group of Manchester Methodists became concerned that by encouraging working men to attend public houses to pay their friendly society dues, then the societies were harming the men&#x27;s health and financial situation and threatening their moral welfare, rather than helping them. To counter this they set up a new Friendly Society called the Independent Order of Rechabites, named after the nomadic, abstaining Rechabites of the Old Testament. The IOR were an offshoot of the Calathumpians, then a diverse collection of social reformers of independent religious views. The organization was still active in the middle 20th century; Sir David Cannadine (British historian, born in Birmingham in 1950) described in 2019 attending a Rechabite meeting with his grandparents who were members.

A branch may be known as a &quot;Tent&quot;, since the biblical Rechabites lived exclusively in tents. Each Tent is ruled by a High Chief Ruler, assisted by a High Deputy Ruler, Corresponding Secretary, Sick and Tent Stewards, Inside and Outside Guardians, a Levite of the Tent and a number of Elders. Before one could join the Rechabites and benefit from their insurance and saving scheme a document has to be signed swearing that the proposed member and his family would not drink any alcoholic beverages. This document is known as The Pledge and represents a solemn promise. The initials &quot;IOR&quot; on a tombstone may indicate that the deceased was a member of the organisation.

The Victoria District of the Independent Order of Rechabites currently has 17 Tents and 5 Regions, while the Queensland District of The Independent Order of Rechabites currently has four Tents and two social committees.

== United States and Canada ==

In the United States and Canada there were several orders of Rechabites including the Independent Order of Rechabites of North America and the Encamped Knights of Rechab of North America. The most successful, however, was the Independent Order of Rechabites, which was founded in 1842 and was reported to have 990,000 at the beginning of the twentieth century. Like the Order in Britain, its local groups were called Tents. The national structure was the &quot;High Tent&quot; and the order was headquartered in Washington, DC. Membership was open to males aged 16 to 55, females aged twelve and up, and juveniles aged 5-16; the primary tents were composed of males 16–55 years old who believed in a Supreme Being and signed a total abstinence pledge. Individuals over fifty five were admitted as honorary members, and females over twelve and males under sixteen were permitted to form their own Tents. The Order worked three degrees: Knight of Temperance, Knight of Fortitude and Covenanted Knight of Justice.

==Australia==
 In Australia the IOR was first established in Tasmania in 1843, soon spreading to other states. Members of the IOR were provided with assistance during times of sickness, death and hardship.

IOR was active in Victoria and in 1876 it established &#x27;Tent&#x27; 138 in Bung Bong rural Victoria. The Building was also used for community purposes including meetings of the &#x27;Farmers Club&#x27; and as a Church of England.

In 1991, IOR Victoria combined with the IOR in other states to form a national private health fund. Members wishing to join IOR&#x27;s health fund were no longer required to sign a pledge of abstinence from alcohol. In 2005 the IOR health fund was sold to HCF Health Insurance, and the rest of the organisation continued as a temperance promoting organisation. In 2008, 38.5 million dollars of its funds management was transferred to the Foresters Friendly Society. As of 2024, the Independent Order of Rechabites retains a state branch in Victoria, with a number of affiliated tents.
==United Kingdom==
Branches of the Order were recorded in: Manchester in 1835; Skipsea, Yorkshire, in 1838; Leek, Staffordshire in 1839; Banbury (the Rechabites Cadbury Tent) in the 1880s; Burntwood in the 1890s; Lichfield in 1911; Leicester in 1922; Gloucester in 1930; Marlborough in 1937; and Telford in 1940.

Since 2004 the Rechabite Friendly Society has traded as Healthy Investment, a financial services organisation that continues to specialise in providing ethical savings and investment products, not restricted to teetotallers. The Society avoids direct investment in companies in the alcohol, arms, tobacco, gambling and pornography industries. It is a with-profits provider, which as a mutual insurance company means that there are no shareholders to benefit from members&#x27; investments.

The Society provides Tax Exempt Savings Plans only offered by Friendly Societies, and other savings products.

==Archives==
The archives of the Independent Order of Rechabites have been deposited at Senate House Library, University of London. Some material, including a history of the Glasgow District No. 40, is also held by the Archives of the University of Glasgow. Numerous archives of branches are held at local record offices.

<doc id="533123" wikidata="Q187031" url="?curid=533123" title="Paperboy">
<text>A paperboy is someoneoften an older child or adolescentwho distributes printed newspapers to homes or offices on a regular route, usually by bicycle or automobile. In Western nations during the heyday of print newspapers during the early 20th century, this was often a young person&#x27;s first job, perhaps undertaken before or after school. This contrasts with the newsboy or newspaper hawker, now extremely rare in Western nations, who would sell newspapers to passersby on the street, often with very vocal promotion. They were common when multiple daily papers in every cityas many as 50 in New York City alonecompeted.

==History==
The paperboy occupies a prominent place in the popular memory of many countries, including the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, and Japan. This is because it has long been the first paying job available to young boys. Newspaper industry lore suggests that the first paperboy, hired in 1833, was 10-year-old Barney Flaherty who was hired after seeing an advertisement in the Sun News and signing up for the job.

The duties of a paperboy varied by distributor, but usually included counting and separating papers, rolling papers and inserting them in newspaper bags during inclement weather, and collecting payments from customers.

The number of paperboys experienced a major decline. This is due partly to the disappearance of afternoon newspapers, whose delivery times worked better for school-aged children than did those of morning papers, which were typically delivered before 6 a.m. The numbers have also been affected by changing demographics, the availability of news and newspapers on the Internet; employment laws (particularly the mid-20th century ban of child labour), the decline of small towns that could be traversed by bicycle, and growing concerns for the safety of un-escorted children, all of which have led many newspapers to switch to delivery by adults. Today, they are mainly used by weekly community newspapers and free shopper papers, which still tend to be delivered in the afternoons. Alternatively, sometimes paperboys are only employed once a week to deliver the paper on Sunday. Many deliveries these days are by adults in cars, known as newspaper carriers. They have traditionally been hired by the newspapers as independent contractors.

<doc id="533124" wikidata="Q2766237" url="?curid=533124" title="Antecedent (grammar)">
<text>In grammar, an antecedent is one or more words that establish the meaning of a pronoun or other pro-form. For example, in the sentence &quot;John arrived late because traffic held him up,&quot; the word &quot;John&quot; is the antecedent of the pronoun &quot;him.&quot; Pro-forms usually follow their antecedents, but sometimes precede them. In the latter case, the more accurate term would technically be &quot;postcedent&quot;, although this term is not commonly distinguished from &quot;antecedent&quot; because the definition of &quot;antecedent&quot; usually encompasses it. The linguistic term that is closely related to &quot;antecedent&quot; and &quot;pro-form&quot; is &quot;anaphora&quot;. Theories of syntax explore the distinction between antecedents and postcedents in terms of binding.

==Examples==
Almost any syntactic category can serve as the antecedent to a pro-form. The following examples illustrate a range of proforms and their antecedents. The pro-forms are in bold, and their antecedents are underlined:

::a. Willy said he likes chocolate. 

::b. My eccentric uncle likes chocolate. He tells everyone to buy him chocolate. 

::c. Larry was helpful, and so was Kim. 

::d. He arrived in the afternoon, when nobody was home. 

::e. Thomas plays soccer in the park. The kids all congregate there. 

::f. Our helpers did it very carefully, and we did it like that as well. 

::g. Fred works hard, but Tom does not do the same. 

::h. Susan lies all the time, which everybody knows about. 

::i. Our politicians have been pandering again. This demotivates the voters. 

::j. Rob is a dentist and, as such, he fixes teeth. 

::k. Someone called who offered to help. She was really friendly. 

::l. The paragraph has in fact been checked by Sam, but Susan won&#x27;t do it. 

This list of proforms and the types of antecedents that they take is by no means exhaustive, but rather it is intended to merely deliver an impression of the breadth of expressions that can function as proforms and antecedents. While the stereotypical proform is a pronoun and the stereotypical antecedent a noun or noun phrase, these examples demonstrate that most any syntactic category can in fact serve as an antecedent to a proform, whereby the proforms themselves are a diverse bunch. The last two examples are particularly interesting, because they show that some proforms can even take discontinuous word combinations as antecedents, i.e. the antecedents are constituents. A particularly frequent type of proform occurs in relative clauses. Many relative clauses contain a relative pronoun, and these relative pronouns have an antecedent. Sentences d and h above contain relative clauses; the proforms &quot;when&quot; and &quot;which&quot; are relative proforms.

==Uncertain antecedents==
In some cases, the wording could have an uncertain antecedent, where the antecedent of a pronoun is not clear because two or more prior nouns or phrases could match the count, gender, or logic as a prior reference.
In such cases, scholars have recommended to rewrite the sentence structure to be more specific, or repeat the words of the antecedent rather than use only a pronoun phrase, as a technique to resolve the uncertain antecedent.

For example, consider the sentence, &quot;There was a doll inside the box that was made of clay&quot;, where the word &quot;that&quot; could refer to either the box or the doll. To make it clear that the doll is what is made of clay, the sentence could be reworded as one of the following: &quot;Inside the box, there was a doll that was made of clay&quot;, &quot;Inside the box, there was a doll made of clay&quot;, or &quot;There was a girl doll inside the box, and she was made of clay&quot; (or similar wording).

Antecedents may also be unclear when they occur far from the noun or phrase they refer to. Bryan Garner calls these &quot;remote relatives&quot; and gives this example from the New York Times: 
As Garner points out, “that were…the border” modifies “messages”, which occurs 7 words (3 of which are nouns) before. In context, the phrase could also modify “the Iraqi people”, hence the uncertainty.

==Postcedents==
The &quot;ante-&quot; in &quot;antecedent&quot; means &#x27;before; in front of&#x27;. Thus, when a pro-form precedes its antecedent, the antecedent is not literally an antecedent, but rather it is a postcedent, &quot;post-&quot; meaning &#x27;after; behind&#x27;. The following examples, wherein the pro-forms are bolded and their postcedents are underlined, illustrate this distinction:
::a. When it is ready, I&#x27;ll have a cup of coffee. 
::b. In her bed, my friend spends the entire morning. 
::c. It bothered me that she did not call. 
::d. Two violinists were there, at the party. 
::e. Sam tries to work then, when it is raining. 
Postcedents are rare compared to antecedents, and in practice, the distinction between antecedents and postcedents is often ignored, with the term &quot;antecedent&quot; being used to denote both. This practice is a source of confusion, and some have therefore denounced using the term &quot;antecedent&quot; to mean &quot;postcedent&quot; because of this confusion.

==Implied antecedents==
Some pro-forms lack a linguistic antecedent. In such cases, the antecedent is implied in the given discourse environment or from general knowledge of the world. For instance, the first person pronouns &quot;I&quot;, &quot;me&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, and &quot;us&quot; and the second person pronoun &quot;you&quot; are pro-forms that usually lack a linguistic antecedent. However, their antecedents are present in the discourse context as the speaker and the listener. Pleonastic pro-forms also lack a linguistic antecedent, e.g. &quot;It is raining&quot;, where the pronoun &quot;it&quot; is semantically empty and cannot be viewed as referring to anything specific in the discourse world. Definite pro-forms such as &quot;they&quot; and &quot;you&quot; also have an indefinite use, which means they denote some person or people in general, e.g. &quot;They will get you for that&quot;, and therefore cannot be construed as taking a linguistic antecedent.

<text>The London Astoria was a music venue at 157 Charing Cross Road, in London, England, that operated from 1976 to 2009.

Originally a warehouse during the 1920s, the building became a cinema and ballroom. It was converted for use as a theatre in the 1970s. After further development, the building re-opened in the mid-1980s, as a night club and live music venue for well-known musical acts. There are half a dozen clubs and smaller music venues in the adjacent buildings.

In 2009 the venue closed, and was demolished as part of the development plans of the Crossrail project. The venue is still seen today as having been an iconic music establishment, as it helped to launch the careers of many British rock bands and also played a part in the UK success of many international acts.

==History==
The Astoria was built on the site of a former Crosse &amp; Blackwell warehouse and opened in 1927 as a cinema. It was designed by Edward A. Stone, who also designed subsequent Astoria venues at Brixton (now the Brixton Academy), Old Kent Road, Finsbury Park and Streatham. When first constructed, the building was four storeys tall with a decorative frieze cornice surrounding its exterior. The original interior was styled as a square proscenium theatre consisting of a panelled barrel-vault ceiling supported by large columns, a viewing balcony and had false viewing boxes, which actually contained the organ pipes. From 1928, the basement was used as a ballroom dancing salon.

The venue&#x27;s interior was re-designed with a plainer, modern style in 1968. In 1977 it was converted for theatrical use. The venue went through another period of conversion when the theatre closed in 1984. It reopened in 1985 as a nightclub and live music venue with a capacity for 2,000 people. A booklet was published called &quot;The History of the Astoria&quot; by Nigel Crewe to commemorate its evolving uses.

At its closing in 2009 the record for the most consecutive sold-out shows at the Astoria was The Mission who performed seven straight nights between 21 and 27 March 1988 on their &quot;Children Play&quot; tour.
The venue would host the famous night &quot;The Trip&quot; at the height of the acid house scene in 1988.

Mean Fiddler acquired the lease for the London Astoria in May 2000, &quot;securing the future of live music at one of London&#x27;s most famous rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll venues.&quot; It was also connected to Astoria 2 so that the two venues could function as a single venue when needed. The Astoria continued to operate in this format until its ultimate closure in 2009.

==Closure and redevelopment of site==

In June 2006, the Astoria was sold by Compco Holdings to property group Derwent Valley Central, for £23.75m. It was rumoured that the buyers were planning to convert the site into a combination of shops, flats and offices to take advantage of an increase in property prices due to the forthcoming 2012 Olympics.

On 13 August 2007, Festival Republic sold most of its venues, and the rights to the name &quot;Mean Fiddler&quot;, to the MAMA Group, but it retained The Astoria and Mean Fiddler, which reverted to its old name of The Astoria 2, generally known as the LA2 (London Astoria 2).

In 2008 it became known that the Astoria would be demolished to make way for Crossrail, a major railway development crossing London from west to east. Despite public opposition, London Mayor Ken Livingstone confirmed that the venue would have to go, saying &quot;The construction of Crossrail means that the Astoria can&#x27;t be saved&quot;.

The nightclub G-A-Y left the Astoria in July 2008 and moved to the Heaven nightclub.

In January 2009, the Astoria closed its doors for the last time, having been subject to a compulsory purchase order for the Crossrail development. Its final night of opening was 14 January, when a &#x27;Demolition Ball&#x27; was held, co-organised by Get Cape Wear Cape Fly&#x27;s Sam Duckworth in aid of Billy Bragg&#x27;s Jail Guitar Doors charity and Love Music Hate Racism. Acts included The Automatic, My Vitriol and ex-Mansun singer Paul Draper, Frank Turner, ...And You Will Know Us By The Trail Of Dead and The King Blues. London Astoria 2 also had a closing party, headlined by rock band Open The Skies, with support from Outcry Fire, F.A.T.E and Orakai.

Demolition of the Astoria was completed by October 2009.

In 2012, plans by Nimax Theatres to build a new in-the-round theatre on the site adjacent to the Astoria were approved. The site could not be built on at that time due to the construction of Crossrail. The venue was due to open in November 2021 but its opening was delayed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The new theatre, @sohoplace, the first newly built West End theatre for 50 years, opened in October 2022 and seats 602.

<doc id="533141" wikidata="Q14691014" url="?curid=533141" title="National Underground Railroad Freedom Center">
<text>The National Underground Railroad Freedom Center is a museum in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio, based on the history of the Underground Railroad. Opened in 2004, the center also pays tribute to all efforts to &quot;abolish human enslavement and secure freedom for all people&quot;.

It is one of a new group of &quot;museums of conscience&quot; in the United States, along with the Museum of Tolerance, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and the National Civil Rights Museum. The center offers insight into the struggle for freedom in the past, in the present, and for the future, as it attempts to challenge visitors to contemplate the meaning of freedom in their own lives. Its location recognizes the significant role of Cincinnati in the history of the Underground Railroad, as thousands of slaves escaped to freedom by crossing the Ohio River from the southern slave states. Many found refuge in the city, some staying there temporarily before heading north to gain freedom in Canada.

After ten years of planning, fundraising, and construction, the $110 million (~$ in ) Freedom Center opened to the public on August 3, 2004; official opening ceremonies took place on August 23. The 158,000 square foot (15,000 m2) structure was designed by Boora Architects (design architect) of Portland, Oregon with Blackburn Architects (architect of record) of Indianapolis. Three pavilions celebrate courage, cooperation and perseverance. The exterior features rough travertine stone from Tivoli, Italy on the east and west faces of the building, and copper panels on the north and south. According to Walter Blackburn, one of its primary architects before his death, the building&#x27;s &quot;undulating quality&quot; expresses the fields and the river that escaping slaves crossed to reach freedom. First Lady Laura Bush, Oprah Winfrey, and Muhammad Ali attended the groundbreaking ceremony on June 17, 2002.

==Slave pen==

The center&#x27;s principal artifact is a 21 by 30-foot (6 by 9 m), two-story log slave pen built in 1830. By 2003, it was &quot;the only known surviving rural slave jail,&quot; previously used to house slaves prior to their being shipped to auction. The structure was moved from a farm in Mason County, Kentucky, where a tobacco barn had been built around it.

It was reconstructed in the second-floor atrium of the museum, where visitors encounter it again and again while exploring other exhibits. Passersby on the street outside can also see it through the center&#x27;s large windows.
The pen was originally owned by Captain John Anderson, a veteran of the Revolutionary War and slave trader. Slaves from the area were transported from Dover, Kentucky to slave markets in Natchez, Mississippi and New Orleans, Louisiana; they were held in this pen for a few days or several months, as he and other traders waited for favorable market conditions and higher selling prices. The pen has eight small windows, the original stone floor and fireplace. On the second floor are a row of wrought iron rings (see photo at right) through which a central chain ran, tethering men on either side. Male slaves were held on the second floor, while women were kept on the first floor, where they used the fireplace for cooking.

&quot;The pen is powerful,&quot; says Carl Westmoreland, curator and senior adviser to the museum. &quot;It has the feeling of hallowed ground. When people stand inside, they speak in whispers. It is a sacred place. I believe it is here to tell a story – the story of the internal slave trade to future generations.&quot;

Visitors to the museum could at one time walk through the holding pen and touch its walls. It is now closed off. The first names of some of the slaves believed to have been held in the pen are listed on a wooden slab in the pen&#x27;s interior; they were documented in records kept by slave traders who used the pen.

Westmoreland spent three and a half years uncovering the story of the slave jail. Its authentication by him and other historians is considered &quot;a landmark in the material culture of slavery&quot;. Westmoreland said,

We&#x27;re just beginning to remember. There is a hidden history right below the surface, part of the unspoken vocabulary of the American historic landscape. It&#x27;s nothing but a pile of logs, yet it is everything.

==Other features==
Prominent features of the Center include:
* The &quot;Suite for Freedom&quot; Theater features three animated films: these address the fragile nature of freedom throughout human history, particularly as related to the Underground Railroad and slavery in the United States.
* The &quot;ESCAPE! Freedom Seekers&quot; interactive display about the Underground Railroad; it presents school groups and families with young children a series of choices on an imaginary escape attempt. The gallery features information about figures including William Lloyd Garrison, a leading abolitionist; Harriet Tubman, an escaped slave and &quot;conductor&quot; on the Underground Railroad; and Frederick Douglass, an escaped slave who became an abolitionist and powerful orator.
* The film, &quot;Brothers of the Borderland,&quot; tells the story of the Underground Railroad in Ripley, Ohio, where conductors, both black (John Parker) and white (Reverend John Rankin), helped slaves such as a fictional Alice. It was directed by Julie Dash.
* Exhibits about the history of slavery and opponents including John Brown and President Abraham Lincoln; and the American Civil War that ended it.
* &quot;The Struggle Continues,&quot; an exhibit portrays continuing challenges faced by African Americans since the end of slavery, struggles for freedom in today&#x27;s world, and ways that the Underground Railroad has inspired groups in India, Poland and South Africa.
* The &quot;John Parker Library&quot; houses a collection of multimedia materials about the Underground Railroad and freedom-related issues.
* The &quot;FamilySearch Center&quot; allows visitors to investigate their own roots.
*Jane Burch Cochran created a quilt, &quot;Crossing to Freedom,&quot; a 7 ft by 10 ft that depicts symbolic images from the anti-slavery era to the Civil Rights Movement that hangs at an entrance to the center.

The Freedom Center&#x27;s former executive director and CEO, John Pepper, was previously the CEO of Procter &amp; Gamble.

<doc id="533143" wikidata="Q114085" url="?curid=533143" title="Rhinitis">
<text>Rhinitis, also known as coryza, is irritation and inflammation of the mucous membrane inside the nose. Common symptoms are a stuffy nose, runny nose, sneezing, and post-nasal drip.
The inflammation is caused by viruses, bacteria, irritants or allergens. The most common kind of rhinitis is allergic rhinitis, which is usually triggered by airborne allergens such as pollen and dander. Allergic rhinitis may cause additional symptoms, such as sneezing and nasal itching, coughing, headache, fatigue, malaise, and cognitive impairment. The allergens may also affect the eyes, causing watery, reddened, or itchy eyes and puffiness around the eyes. The inflammation results in the generation of large amounts of mucus, commonly producing a runny nose, as well as a stuffy nose and post-nasal drip. In the case of allergic rhinitis, the inflammation is caused by the degranulation of mast cells in the nose. When mast cells degranulate, they release histamine and other chemicals, starting an inflammatory process that can cause symptoms outside the nose, such as fatigue and malaise. In the case of infectious rhinitis, it may occasionally lead to pneumonia, either viral or bacterial. Sneezing also occurs in infectious rhinitis to expel bacteria and viruses from the respiratory tract.
Rhinitis is very common. Allergic rhinitis is more common in some countries than others; in the United States, about 10–30% of adults are affected annually. Mixed rhinitis (MR) refers to patients with nonallergic rhinitis and allergic rhinitis. MR is a specific rhinitis subtype. It may represent between 50 and 70% of all AR patients. However, true prevalence of MR has not been confirmed yet.

==Types==
Rhinitis is categorized into three types (although infectious rhinitis is typically regarded as a separate clinical entity due to its transient nature): (i) infectious rhinitis includes acute and chronic bacterial infections; (ii) nonallergic rhinitis includes vasomotor, idiopathic, hormonal, atrophic, occupational, and gustatory rhinitis, as well as rhinitis medicamentosa (rebound congestion); (iii) allergic rhinitis, triggered by pollen, mold, animal dander, dust, Balsam of Peru, and other inhaled allergens.

===Infectious===
Rhinitis is commonly caused by a viral or bacterial infection, including the common cold, which is caused by Rhinoviruses, Coronaviruses, and influenza viruses, others caused by adenoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses, human respiratory syncytial virus, enteroviruses other than rhinoviruses, metapneumovirus, and measles virus, or bacterial sinusitis, which is commonly caused by &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;, and &quot;Moraxella catarrhalis&quot;. Symptoms of the common cold include rhinorrhea, sneezing, sore throat (pharyngitis), cough, congestion, and slight headache.

===Nonallergic rhinitis===
Nonallergic rhinitis refers to rhinitis that is not due to an allergy. The category was formerly referred to as vasomotor rhinitis, as the first cause discovered was vasodilation due to an overactive parasympathetic nerve response. As additional causes were identified, additional types of nonallergic rhinitis were recognized. Vasomotor rhinitis is now included among these under the more general classification of nonallergic rhinitis. The diagnosis is made upon excluding allergic causes. It is an umbrella term of rhinitis of multiple causes, such as occupational (chemical), smoking, gustatory, hormonal, senile (rhinitis of the elderly), atrophic, medication-induced (including rhinitis medicamentosa), local allergic rhinitis, non-allergic rhinitis with eosinophilia syndrome (NARES) and idiopathic (vasomotor or non-allergic, non-infectious perennial allergic rhinitis (NANIPER), or non-infectious non-allergic rhinitis (NINAR).

In vasomotor rhinitis, certain nonspecific stimuli, including changes in environment (temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, or weather), airborne irritants (odors, fumes), dietary factors (spicy food, alcohol), sexual arousal, exercise, and emotional factors trigger rhinitis. There is still much to be learned about this, but it is thought that these non-allergic triggers cause dilation of the blood vessels in the lining of the nose, which results in swelling and drainage.

Non-allergic rhinitis can co-exist with allergic rhinitis, and is referred to as &quot;mixed rhinitis&quot;. The pathology of vasomotor rhinitis appears to involve neurogenic inflammation and is as yet not very well understood. The role of transient receptor potential ion channels on the non-neuronal nasal epithelial cells has also been suggested. Overexpression of these receptors have influence the nasal airway hyper-responsiveness to non-allergic irritant environmental stimuli (e.g., extremes of temperature, changes in osmotic or barometric pressure). Vasomotor rhinitis appears to be significantly more common in women than men, leading some researchers to believe that hormone imbalance plays a role. In general, age of onset occurs after 20 years of age, in contrast to allergic rhinitis which can be developed at any age. Individuals with vasomotor rhinitis typically experience symptoms year-round, though symptoms may be exacerbated in the spring and autumn when rapid weather changes are more common. An estimated 17 million United States citizens have vasomotor rhinitis.

Drinking alcohol may cause rhinitis as well as worsen asthma (see alcohol-induced respiratory reactions). In certain populations, particularly those of East Asian countries such as Japan, these reactions have a nonallergic basis. In other populations, particularly those of European descent, a genetic variant in the gene that metabolizes ethanol to acetaldehyde, ADH1B, is associated with alcohol-induced rhinitis. It is suggested that this variant metabolizes ethanol to acetaldehyde too quickly for further processing by ALDH2 and thereby leads to the accumulation of acetaldehyde and rhinitis symptoms. In these cases, alcohol-induced rhinitis may be of the &quot;mixed rhinitis&quot; type and, it seems likely, most cases of alcohol-induced rhinitis in non-Asian populations reflect true allergic response to the non-ethanol and/or contaminants in alcoholic beverages, particularly when these beverages are wines or beers. Alcohol-exacerbated rhinitis is more frequent in individuals with a history of rhinitis exacerbated by aspirin.

Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), particularly those that inhibit cyclooxygenase 1 (COX1), can worsen rhinitis and asthma symptoms in individuals with a history of either one of these diseases. These exacerbations most often appear due to NSAID hypersensitivity reactions rather than NSAID-induced allergic reactions.

The antihistamine azelastine, applied as a nasal spray, may be effective for vasomotor rhinitis. Fluticasone propionate or budesonide (both are steroids) in nostril spray form may also be used for symptomatic treatment. The antihistamine cyproheptadine is also effective, probably due to its antiserotonergic effects.

A systematic review on non-allergic rhinitis reports improvement of overall function after treatment with capsaicin (the active component of chili peppers). The quality of evidence is low, however.

===Allergic===

Allergic rhinitis or hay fever may follow when an allergen such as pollen, dust, or Balsam of Peru is inhaled by an individual with a sensitized immune system, triggering antibody production. These antibodies mostly bind to mast cells, which contain histamine. When the mast cells are stimulated by an allergen, histamine (and other chemicals) are released. This causes itching, swelling, and mucus production.

Symptoms vary in severity between individuals. Very sensitive individuals can experience hives or other rashes. Particulate matter in polluted air and chemicals such as chlorine and detergents, which can normally be tolerated, can greatly aggravate the condition.

Characteristic physical findings in individuals who have allergic rhinitis include conjunctival swelling and erythema, eyelid swelling, lower eyelid venous stasis, lateral crease on the nose, swollen nasal turbinates, and middle ear effusion.

Even if a person has negative skin-prick, intradermal and blood tests for allergies, they may still have allergic rhinitis, from a local allergy in the nose. This is called local allergic rhinitis. Many people who were previously diagnosed with nonallergic rhinitis may actually have local allergic rhinitis.

A patch test may be used to determine if a particular substance is causing the rhinitis.

===Rhinitis medicamentosa===

Rhinitis medicamentosa is a form of drug-induced nonallergic rhinitis which is associated with nasal congestion brought on by the use of certain oral medications (primarily sympathomimetic amine and 2-imidazoline derivatives) and topical decongestants (e.g., oxymetazoline, phenylephrine, xylometazoline, and naphazoline nasal sprays) that constrict the blood vessels in the lining of the nose.

===Chronic atrophic rhinitis===

Chronic rhinitis is a form of atrophy of the mucous membrane and glands of the nose.

===Rhinitis sicca===
Chronic form of dryness of the mucous membranes.

===Polypous rhinitis===
Chronic rhinitis associated with polyps in the nasal cavity.

==Pathophysiology==
Most prominent pathological changes observed are nasal airway epithelial metaplasia in which goblet cells replace ciliated columnar epithelial cells in the nasal mucous membrane. This results in mucin hypersecretion by goblet cells and decreased mucociliary activity. Nasal secretion are not adequately cleared with clinical manifestation of nasal congestion, sinus pressure, post-nasal dripping, and headache. Over-expression of transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels, such as TRPA1 and TRPV1, may be involved in the pathogenesis of non-allergic rhinitis.

=== Association between rhinitis and asthma ===
Neurogenic inflammation produced by neuropeptides released from sensory nerve endings to the airways is a proposed common mechanism of association between both allergic and non-allergic rhinitis with asthma. This may explain higher association of rhinitis with asthma developing later in life. Environmental irritants acts as modulators of airway inflammation in these contiguous airways. Development of occupational asthma is often preceded by occupational rhinitis. Among the causative agents are flours, enzymes used in processing food, latex, isocyanates, welding fumes, epoxy resins, and formaldehyde. Accordingly, prognosis of occupational asthma is contingent on early diagnosis and the adoption of protective measures for rhinitis.

==Diagnosis==
The different forms of rhinitis are essentially diagnosed clinically. Vasomotor rhinitis is differentiated from viral and bacterial infections by the lack of purulent exudate and crusting. It can be differentiated from allergic rhinitis because of the absence of an identifiable allergen.

Evidence has been published from a few health apps for mobile devices that show potential to assist in the diagnosis of rhinitis and rhinosinusitis and to evaluate management and treatment adherence. While this shows promise for clinical management, few had been validated in the scientific literature, and even fewer included considerations for multimorbidity.

==Management==
The management of rhinitis depends on the underlying cause.

For allergic rhinitis, intranasal corticosteroids are recommended. For severe symptoms intranasal antihistamines may be added.

==Pronunciation and etymology==
Rhinitis is pronounced , while coryza is pronounced .

&quot;Rhinitis&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek &quot;rhis&quot;, &quot;gen&quot;.: &quot;rhinos&quot;, &quot;nose&quot;. &quot;Coryza&quot; comes through Latin from Ancient Greek . According to physician Andrew Wylie, &quot;we use the term [&quot;coryza&quot;] for a cold in the head, but the two are really synonymous. The ancient Romans advised their patients to clean their nostrils and thereby sharpen their wits.&quot;

<doc id="533149" wikidata="Q3246315" url="?curid=533149" title="Head coach">
<text>A head coach, senior coach, or manager is a professional responsible for training and developing athletes within a sports team. This role often has a higher public profile and salary than other coaching positions. In some sports, such as association football and professional baseball, this role is referred to as the &quot;manager,&quot; while in others, like Australian rules football, it is called &quot;senior coach.&quot;

The head coach typically reports to a sporting director or general manager. In professional sports, where senior players are full-time employees under contract, the head coach often functions similarly to a general manager. Other coaches within the organization usually report to the head coach and specialize in areas such as offense or defense, with further subdivisions into specific roles like position coaches.

In youth sports, the head coach often serves as the primary representative of the coaching staff, managing communication with parents and overseeing the overall development of young athletes.

==American football==
Head coaching responsibilities in American football vary depending on the level of the sport.

===High school football===
As with most other head coaches, high school coaches are primarily tasked with organizing and training football players. This includes creating game plans, evaluating players, and leading the team during competition, deciding how the team is lined up, or their formation.

High school head coaches also have a variety of responsibilities beyond the football field. These include recruiting students within the school, scheduling opponents, and training/hiring/leading lower-level coaches. Coaches can also release or suspend players on their team for various reasons. Most coaches hold another position within their program&#x27;s school, typically as a teacher. High school football coaches are typically required to have at least a bachelor&#x27;s degree. Many coaches choose to earn a degree in physical education or sports management. Coaches will often preside over both a varsity and junior varsity team, but it is common for an assistant coach to handle the primary responsibilities of the junior varsity team.

=== College football ===
One of the major features of head coaching in college football is the high player turnover rate, which is how many players change teams, via the transfer portal, or getting drafted/graduating. It is currently averaging about 18% each season.

Head coaches at the college level have a paid staff and can concentrate on the overall aspect of the team rather than dealing with the nuances of training regimens and similar activities. Unlike head coaches at other levels, college coaching staff are solely responsible for the roster of players on the team. The ability to recruit top players plays a major role in success at the college level, and is done, in most cases, by the head coach or head recruiter.

A college coach acts as the face of a team, in a sport where the players regularly depart after a few years, compared to some coaches who have been in the same position for over a generation. They are often called upon to discuss off-the-field incidents such as rule infractions or player antics.

In a majority of states, the head coach of a public university&#x27;s football or men&#x27;s basketball program is the highest-paid state public official.

Major annual coaching honours given out at the end of the year include the Home Depot Coach of the Year, the Liberty Mutual Coach of the Year Award, the Associated Press College Football Coach of the Year Award, and the Paul &quot;Bear&quot; Bryant Award.

===National Football League===
At the professional level, head coaches often earn several million dollars a year, although there is considerable overlap between the salaries paid to top-earning college coaches and the range of salaries paid to head coaches in the National Football League. Since they do not have to travel the country recruiting high school players, head coaches at the professional level have much more time to devote to tactics and playbooks, which are coordinated with staff who are typically paid even more than at the college level. They typically report to the general manager.

A massive factor that affects NFL coaches salaries is the NFL&#x27;s $11 billion earnings, making it the highest revenue sport, exceeding Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) $7 billion. The NFL&#x27;s coaches are among the highest-paid professional coaches with professional football salaries topping a 2011 &quot;Forbes&quot; article on the highest-paid sports coaches.

Another major element of NFL coaches&#x27; contracts, negotiated between individual coaches and NFL teams/owners, are NFL-demanded provisions in the employment contracts of coaches that authorize the employing NFL teams to withhold part of a coach&#x27;s salary when league operations are suspended, such as lockouts or television contract negotiations.

====Salary====
As of 2023, the average annual salary for a head coach in the National Football League is approximately $6.6 million annually. The salary for an NFL head coach can range from $5 million to over $18 million per year. As of 2024, the highest paid NFL head coach is Andy Reid, the head coach of the Kansas City Chiefs.

==Association football==
In association football, a head coach has the same responsibilities as in any other sport. For instance, in European countries, a head coach usually picks their coaching staff. The main difference is a head coach usually works with a director of football, with the latter responsible for player recruitment and negotiating contracts. In the United Kingdom, these roles are sometimes combined in the position of manager.

In some countries, an individual may be granted a position as a &quot;senior coach&quot; and act as the first assistant to the head coach or run a junior squad in the club. In the absence of a head coach, a senior coach can temporarily take over as an interim head coach (or caretaker manager).

== Australian rules football or AFL ==

In Australian rules football, the head coach, or senior coach, is responsible for developing and implementing appropriate training programs for his players. The senior coach in the AFL is also responsible for determining the rotations and team lineups for each game. Moreover, the coaches are not the only ones involved in team operations, as in AFL teams, up to five different coaches may have their unique responsibilities. For example, there can be a forward, a midfielder, and a defense coach, each focusing on a particular position. Thus, each coach works with players in those positions.

== Rugby union ==
Rugby football union clubs have the option of employing a director of rugby (DOR), a head coach, or both. The responsibilities for each role vary between clubs. Generally, if a club decides to employ either a DOR or a head coach, it will hold more responsibility than if it employs individuals for both roles. It has been proposed that the DOR is a club-wide position, providing and ensuring the club is working towards a shared philosophy from youth teams to senior teams.[14][15] A head coach, on the other hand, is focused purely on planning and implementing coaching for the first team alongside a coaching staff consisting of a mixture of defense, attack, forwards, backs, skills, and strength and conditioning coaches.

== Basketball ==

=== National Basketball Association ===
In the National Basketball Association (NBA), the head coach is responsible for developing game plans, scouting opponents, and managing players.

== Baseball ==

=== Youth Baseball ===
In Little League, or other youth levels of baseball, the manager is responsible for teaching players technique and rules, organizing practices, choosing the lineup and starting pitcher. Oftentimes, the manager is a parent of a child on the team.

=== High School Baseball ===
At the High School level, there is a varsity and junior varsity level. The manager of the varsity team is the head of the school&#x27;s baseball program, yet he does not manage the junior varsity team, as that is left to another coach in the program.

=== College Baseball ===
At the college level, the manager is responsible for recruiting high school players to their university, setting the lineup and starting pitcher, making day-to-day decisions, and other choices. They do not teach and train players, that is left for younger levels and assistants, but they are the head of the program.

=== Minor League Baseball ===
In Minor League Baseball (MiLB), the manager is responsible for setting the lineup, pitcher, and making substitutions. It is similar to the Major Leagues. They prepare players for the major leagues and higher levels.

=== Major League Baseball ===
In Major League Baseball (MLB) the head coach, called the manager, is responsible for setting the lineup, choosing the starting pitcher, making substitutions, and supporting his players (often by arguing with the umpire). The manager will often make these decisions based on matchup, or platoon, advantages. Managers are often responsible for training players at lower levels, but specified assistant coaches are given that job at the highest level.

== Cricket ==
=== Role ===
To manage players treatment, rehab, recovery and fitness sessions, depending upon the needs during national cricket team&#x27;s engagement.

=== Australia Cricket Team ===
Andrew McDonald is the current head coach of Indian Cricket team.

=== Indian Cricket Team ===

=== American Distance Running ===

Head coaching responsibilities for Long-distance running vary depending on the level of the sport.

==== College Cross Country ====

<text>The short ton (abbreviation tn) is a measurement unit equal to . It is commonly used in the United States, where it is known simply as a ton; however, the term is ambiguous, the single word &quot;ton&quot; being variously used for short, long, and metric tons.

The various tons are defined as units of mass. They are sometimes used as units of weight, the force exerted by a mass at standard gravity (e.g., short ton-force). One short ton exerts a weight at one standard gravity of 2,000 pound-force (lbf).

==United States==

In the United States, a short ton is usually known simply as a &quot;ton&quot;, without distinguishing it from the tonne (), known there as the &quot;metric ton&quot;, or the long ton also known as the &quot;imperial ton&quot; (). There are, however, some U.S. applications where unspecified &quot;tons&quot; normally mean long tons (for example, naval ships) or metric tons (world grain production figures).

Both the long and short ton are defined as 20 hundredweights, but a hundredweight is in the US system (short or net hundredweight) and in the imperial system (long or gross hundredweight).

A short ton–force is .

<doc id="533156" wikidata="Q3127793" url="?curid=533156" title="Harry Brecheen">
<text>Harry David Brecheen (, , October 14, 1914 – January 17, 2004), nicknamed &quot;the Cat&quot;, was an American left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball who played most of his career for the St. Louis Cardinals. In the late 1940s, he was among the team&#x27;s stars, in 1946 becoming the first left-hander ever to win three games in a single World Series, and the only pitcher ever to win consecutive World Series games. He later led the National League in several categories in 1948.

Bracheen&#x27;s career World Series earned run average of 0.83 was a major league record from 1946 to 1976. From 1951 to 1971, he held the Cardinals&#x27; franchise record for career strikeouts by a left-hander, and he also retired with the fourth-highest fielding percentage among pitchers (.983), then the top mark among left-handers.

==Early life==
Born in Broken Bow, Oklahoma, Brecheen was acquired by the Cardinals in 1938 from the Chicago Cubs after two minor league seasons, but made only three relief appearances during 1940 and did not pitch again at the major league level until 1943. He was nicknamed &quot;The Cat&quot; because of his ability to cover bunts.

== Career ==
Brecheen appeared in three games, all in relief, in 1940. Exempted from military service during World War II with a 4-F classification due to a spinal malformation and a boyhood ankle injury, he pitched in the 1943 and 1944 World Series. In 1943, Brecheen pitched in 29 games, starting 13 of them. He went 9–6 with a 2.29 earned run average in 135 innings pitched. The next season, he went 16–5. Brecheen won game four of the 1944 World Series against the St. Louis Browns. He was key to the Cardinals&#x27; upset win over the Boston Red Sox in the 1946 World Series as he won three games during the series. Brecheen recorded his finest season in 1948, posting a win–loss record of 20–7 with 21 complete games and led the league in earned run average (2.24), strikeouts (149) and shutouts (7).

A two-time All-Star, Brecheen&#x27;s overall career record was 133 wins and 92 losses, with a 2.92 earned run average over 12 seasons. After breaking Bill Sherdel&#x27;s club record for career strikeouts by a left-hander in 1951, he held the mark until Steve Carlton surpassed it in 1971. Brecheen&#x27;s 25 career shutouts remain the Cardinal record for left-handers. His career World Series ERA of 0.83 stood as the record (with at least 25 innings) until Jack Billingham broke it in 1976 with a mark of 0.36.

Playing his entire career for St. Louis teams, Brecheen ended his career in 1953 as a playing coach with the St. Louis Browns; it was that team&#x27;s final season in the city before their move to Baltimore. He won his only start of the 1944 Series, which matched the city&#x27;s two teams.

As a hitter, Brecheen was better than average for a pitcher, posting a .192 batting average (129-for-673) with 48 runs, 2 home runs, 44 RBI and 45 bases on balls.

Brecheen&#x27;s screwball was ranked the eighth-best of all time by Bill James and Rob Neyer.

== Later life ==
Following his playing career, Brecheen remained with the Browns when they became the Baltimore Orioles. His playing career ended in 1954 when he hurt his arm trying to pick up a suitcase, but he remained with the organization as their pitching coach from 1954 to 1967. While coaching the Orioles pitchers for the next 14 years, the Orioles’ staff ranked in the top four in ERA. He trained many young pitchers including Billy O&#x27;Dell, Jack Fisher, Jim Palmer, Dave McNally, Steve Barber, Chuck Estrada, Jerry Walker and Milt Pappas. 

He was also successful with turning around the careers of veterans. In 1959, he converted 36-year-old Hoyt Wilhelm into a starter and the knuckleballer led the league with a 2.19 era and a 15-11 record. With Brecheen&#x27;s help, seemingly washed up Phillies legend Robin Roberts made a successful comeback with the Orioles after going 1-10 with a 5.85 ERA in 1961. Roberts would win 42 games with the Orioles over his 3 1/2 years with Baltimore. Brecheen was let go after the 1967 season after too many promising Orioles pitchers turned up with arm troubles during his long tenure. He was voted into the Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame in 1997. He died at age 89 in a nursing facility in Bethany, Oklahoma.

<text>The Independent Commission on the Voting System, popularly known as the Jenkins Commission after its chairman Roy Jenkins, was a commission into possible reform of the United Kingdom electoral system.

==The commission==

The commission was set up in December 1997 by the Labour government with the support of the Liberal Democrats, to investigate alternatives to the single member plurality (or &quot;first past the post&quot;) electoral system used for British general elections. A referendum was planned on whether to change the voting system.

The commission was asked to take into account four requirements:

# broad proportionality,
# the need for stable government,
# an extension of voter choice, and
# the maintenance of a link between MPs and geographical constituencies.

The commission reported in September 1998 and suggested the alternative vote top-up or AV+ system, which would directly elect some MPs by the alternative vote, with a number of additional members elected from top up lists similarly to Mixed-member proportional representation. The commission considered a single transferable vote system but rejected it because it would require massive constituencies of around 350,000 electors resulting in an oppressive degree of choice (i.e. too many candidates to choose from). Also, they described the counting of votes in STV as &quot;incontestably opaque&quot; and argued that different counting systems could produce different results. Finally, Jenkins rejected STV because it was a different system from those used in European and devolved parliaments, as well as the London Assembly.

==Actions taken from the commission==
No action was taken by the Labour government to change the electoral system.

After the 2010 election, with a hung parliament, and the Liberal Democrats potentially holding the balance of power, AV+ was again the subject of discussion, as a potential part of a coalition deal. However, the eventual coalition&#x27;s deal – between the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives – specified that there would be a referendum on &quot;the introduction of the Alternative Vote&quot;. This was confirmed in February 2011, when the referendum on AV (not AV+) was approved by Parliament.

The referendum took place on Thursday 5 May 2011, resulting in a 67.9% &quot;No&quot; vote, in favour of keeping the existing first-past-the-post; versus 32.1% &quot;Yes&quot; in favour of moving to AV. Of 440 voting areas (based on Parliamentary constituencies) only 10 of the 440 areas returned &quot;yes&quot; votes in favour of AV, of which six were in London, the others being Oxford and Cambridge, Edinburgh Central and Glasgow Kelvin.

== Geography ==
The origins of the name of the city and province of Batna are not clear, but most historians agree that it is of Arabic origin: &quot;m&#x27;batna&quot;, meaning: &quot;Where we sleep this night&quot;. Capital of the highlands situated between the Tell Atlas in the north and the Saharan Atlas in the south, with the Chott el Hodna in the middle, it constitutes a naturally protected passage between south and north. Its climate is moderate, hot and dry during summer time, due to its altitude (it being 800 metres above sea level) the winter is tough, snowy and at times cold (with temperatures of -15 °C recorded on some cold winter nights). This geo-political position is the origin of the last economy merging city due to a high commercial exchange rate between the north&#x27;s seaward opening, and the south&#x27;s source of all the wealth of the country (including reserves of oil, natural gas, iron and many minerals).

== Population ==
Batna City is the fourth largest Algerian city in terms of population; the number of permanent inhabitants is estimated by the Office National de Recencement at 446,000 (as of 2000), though other sources closer to the province estimate closer to one million. A large part of the population is largely mixed from all surrounding villages which suffer from a heavy unemployment rate and isolation. The natives are named &quot;Tamazight&quot;, or in the local dialect: &quot;Chaouyas&quot;, (the plural of Chaoui). The presence of the Tamazight is historically established; the locals refer to &quot;Jugurtha&quot;, &quot;Massinissa&quot; and especially &quot;Dihya&quot; or so called &quot;Kahina&quot;, as their ascendants and history. The local resistance to the repetitive invasions is a source of proud and trivial culture; Phoenicians, Romans, Arabs and French. The word &quot;Tamazight&quot; in Chaoui (Berber) language means &quot;Free men&quot;. As opposed to the surrounding villages (e.g. Arris, Fesdis, Ain Yagout, Kais, N&#x27;gaous, Merouana, Djerma, El Madher, Ouled Nail) where you can find pure chaoui, the city of Batna itself is very heterogeneous, including chaoui from Batna (like Ouled Sidi Yahia, Ouled Boujamâa), Biskra and Khenchla but also many non-berber or mixed families from the Algerian desert (from places such as Oued Souf, Tougourt, Msila and Ouled Jelle) and other places from the west, explaining the fact that the city is mostly arabophone.

== Economy ==
The economy is based on heavy industry launched during the first half of the 1970s. With chemicals, as well as with an industrial and textile base, the region attracts people from the whole region. The city offers a large choice of university orientation (15,000 students in 2001). The city urban structure is based on the old town buildings, narrow and highly populated; the actual city expansion policy is based on heavy works done the surrounding mountain flanks to provide enough buildable space.

== Life level ==
The rapid expansion of the city in the last 10 years is mainly due to the open market policy of the previous government, which was a benefit for many, but in the same way penalized many of the middle-class.

The continuously growing city results in an extreme level of inflation especially on the real estate domain where prices reach extreme levels (for example, ownership of one square meter of land in the city center costs $1000) where the lowest paid salaries are in the region of $180.

== Social life ==
The cultural aspect of the city was active during a time when the local theater group was giving continuous and innovating performances. The city consisted of 12 cinemas and 2 &quot;cinemathèques&quot;, one culture house and many open museums across the province. Due to recent events, security problems and an influx of population into the city, the cultural life has been heavily affected, though recently, thanks to the work of young artists, culture is once again on the public scene.

<text>The Cochrane Theatre, previously known as the Jeanetta Cochrane Theatre, was a receiving and producing theatre situated in Holborn, London, that opened in 1964. It is now used for television filming.

==History==
The theatre opened in 1963 and was named after its founder, Jeannetta Cochrane, who was a theatre practitioner specialising in costume and scenery design at the Central School of Art and Design, now part of the University of the Arts London. Through her persistence, Cochrane persuaded the London County Council to build a theatre attached to the school that could be used as a practice space. The theatre has a traditional proscenium arch and fly tower consisting of 41 counterweight flying bars, orchestra pit and a fully functioning paint frame (a rarity in London theatres).

From 1991 to 1995, Talawa Theatre Company had its home at the Cochrane Theatre.

The Cochrane closed in January 2012 when Central St Martin&#x27;s moved to a new site near King&#x27;s Cross (unifying what had been disparate locations for different parts of the college), with the new venue having its own theatre, the Platform Theatre.

Its owners since 2011, Grange Hotels, are set to demolish the building.

== Television productions ==
In June 2015 Channel 4 filmed a &quot;TFI Friday&quot; special at the theatre and a series of ten shows were produced live in October through December 2015.

Cochrane Theatre was chosen for the new series as the original location of Riverside Studios where the show was filmed has been demolished and is being redeveloped, due for completion in autumn 2017.

ITV&#x27;s late night chat show &quot;The Nightly Show&quot; was filmed at the Cochrane Theatre in 2017.

Channel 5&#x27;s &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot; with Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford was filmed at the Cochrane Theatre in 2019.

<text>A gadget is a mechanical device or any ingenious article. Gadgets are sometimes referred to as &quot;&quot;.

==History==
The etymology of the word is disputed. The word first appears as reference to an 18th-century tool in glassmaking that was developed as a spring pontil. As stated in the glass dictionary published by the Corning Museum of Glass, a gadget is a &quot;metal rod with a spring clip that grips the foot of a vessel and so avoids the use of a pontil&quot;. Gadgets were first used in the late 18th century. According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, there is anecdotal evidence for the use of &quot;gadget&quot; as a placeholder name for a technical item whose precise name one can&#x27;t remember since the 1850s; with Robert Brown&#x27;s 1886 book &quot;Spunyarn and Spindrift, A sailor boy&#x27;s log of a voyage out and home in a China tea-clipper&quot; containing the earliest known usage in print.

A widely circulated story holds that the word gadget was &quot;invented&quot; when Gaget, Gauthier &amp; Cie, the company behind the repoussé construction of the Statue of Liberty (1886), made a small-scale version of the monument and named it after their firm; however this contradicts the evidence that the word was already used before in nautical circles, and the fact that it did not become popular, at least in the US, until after World War I. Other sources cite a derivation from the French &quot;gâchette&quot; which has been applied to various pieces of a firing mechanism, or the French &quot;gagée&quot;, a small tool or accessory.

The October 1918 issue of &quot;Notes and Queries&quot; contains a multi-article entry on the word &quot;gadget&quot; (12 S. iv. 187). H. Tapley-Soper of The City Library, Exeter, writes:
A discussion arose at the Plymouth meeting of the Devonshire Association in 1916 when it was suggested that this word should be recorded in the list of local verbal provincialisms. Several members dissented from its inclusion on the ground that it is in common use throughout the country; and a naval officer who was present said that it has for years been a popular expression in the service for a tool or implement, the exact name of which is unknown or has for the moment been forgotten. I have also frequently heard it applied by motor-cycle friends to the collection of fitments to be seen on motor cycles. &#x27;His handle-bars are smothered in gadgets&#x27; refers to such things as speedometers, mirrors, levers, badges, mascots, &amp;c., attached to the steering handles. The &#x27;jigger&#x27; or short-rest used in billiards is also often called a &#x27;gadget&#x27;; and the name has been applied by local platelayers to the &#x27;gauge&#x27; used to test the accuracy of their work. In fact, to borrow from present-day Army slang, &#x27;gadget&#x27; is applied to &#x27;any old thing.&#x27;
The usage of the term in military parlance extended beyond the navy. In the book &quot;Above the Battle&quot; by Vivian Drake, published in 1918 by D. Appleton &amp; Co., of New York and London, being the memoirs of a pilot in the British Royal Flying Corps, there is the following passage: &quot;Our ennui was occasionally relieved by new gadgets—&#x27;gadget&#x27; is the Flying Corps slang for invention! Some gadgets were good, some comic and some extraordinary.&quot;

By the second half of the twentieth century, the term &quot;gadget&quot; had taken on the connotations of compactness and mobility. In the 1965 essay &quot;The Great Gizmo&quot; (a term used interchangeably with &quot;gadget&quot; throughout the essay), the architectural and design critic Reyner Banham defines the item as:
A characteristic class of US products––perhaps the most characteristic––is a small self-contained unit of high performance in relation to its size and cost, whose function is to transform some undifferentiated set of circumstances to a condition nearer human desires. The minimum of skills is required in its installation and use, and it is independent of any physical or social infrastructure beyond that by which it may be ordered from catalogue and delivered to its prospective user. A class of servants to human needs, these clip-on devices, these portable gadgets, have coloured American thought and action far more deeply––I suspect––than is commonly understood.
==Other uses==

The first atomic bomb was nicknamed &quot;the gadget&quot; by the Scientists of the Manhattan Project, tested at the Trinity site.

==Application gadgets==

In the software industry, &quot;Gadget&quot; refers to computer programs that provide services without needing an independent application to be launched for each one, but instead run in an environment that manages multiple gadgets. There are several implementations based on existing software development techniques, like JavaScript, form input, and various image formats. Proprietary formats include Google Desktop, Google Gadgets, Microsoft Gadgets, the AmigaOS Workbench and dashboard software Apple Widgets.

The earliest documented use of the term &quot;gadget&quot; in context of software engineering was in 1985 by the developers of AmigaOS, the operating system of the Amiga computers (&quot;intuition.library&quot; and also later &quot;gadtools.library&quot;). It denotes what other technological traditions call &quot;GUI widget&quot;—a control element in graphical user interface. This naming convention remains in continuing use (as of 2008) since then.

The X11 windows system &#x27;Intrinsics&#x27; also defines gadgets and their relationship to widgets (buttons, labels, etc.). The gadget was a windowless widget which was supposed to improve the performance of the application by reducing the memory load on the X server. A gadget would use the Window id of its parent widget and had no children of its own.

It is not known whether other software companies are explicitly drawing on that inspiration when featuring the word in names of their technologies or simply referring to the generic meaning. The word &quot;widget&quot; is older in this context. In the movie &quot;Back to School&quot; from 1986 by Alan Metter, there is a scene where an economics professor Dr. Barbay, wants to start for educational purposes a fictional company that produces &quot;widgets: It&#x27;s a fictional product.&quot;

<text>The Sony Sports Network, formerly known as the Sony Pictures Sports Network and also known as Sony TEN, is a group of Indian pay television sports channels owned by Culver Max Entertainment.

The original TEN Sports channel was first established on 1 April 2002 by Abdul Rahman Bukhatir. It was acquired by the Essel Group in 2010 and was added to Essel&#x27;s existing Zee Sports channel, launched in 2005. After the acquisition, Zee launched two new channels, TEN Cricket and TEN Golf, and rebranded Zee Sports as TEN Action.

In August 2016, Sony Pictures Networks India acquired all of the sports channels under Zee from Essel. In 2017, the networks were formally merged with Sony&#x27;s existing Sony ESPN and Sony Six channels as the Sony Pictures Sports Network, with the TEN channels rebranded as Sony TEN. The channels were then rebranded as the Sony Sports Network in October 2022, with all five channels now carrying the &quot;Sony Sports Ten&quot; prefix.

== History ==
In January 2001, Taj Television Ltd was formed in Dubai with Abdul Rahman Bukhatir as a backer. Bukhatir had various business interests and was known for transforming Sharjah as a major international cricket venue. The company launched the channel as TEN Sports (as part of its Taj Entertainment Network) on 1 April 2002. As of March 2004, the company was headed by Chris McDonald as the CEO and had 100 employees.

In June 2005, Zee Telefilms Limited launched Zee Sports, reportedly India&#x27;s first private sports channel. Zee Telefilms acquired a 50% stake in TEN Sports for 800 crore (₹) in 2006, and eventually acquired the remainder of its Indian operations in 2010. The sale did not include its Pakistani operations, which were retained by the Essel Group via its subsidiary, Tower Sports.
In 2010, Zee rebranded Zee Sports as Ten Action which featured adventure sports and non-cricket content. In 2011 Zee launched a new channel called Ten Cricket, exclusively for cricket matches. In March 2016, all channels in the Zee network were rebranded as Ten 1, Ten 2, and Ten 3 respectively.
In August 2016, Sony Pictures Networks India announced its intent to acquire Zee&#x27;s sports networks for US$385 million; the first phase of the sale, which included equity stakes in the holding companies Taj Television (India) Pvt Ltd and part of Taj TV Limited Mauritius, was completed in February 2017 for US$350 million. On 18 July 2017, all of Sony&#x27;s sports channels in India were rebranded as Sony TEN, and the high-definition feeds of Sony TEN 2 and 3 were also launched. The remainder of the sale was completed in September 2017.

The networks, along with new sisters Sony Six and Sony ESPN, were branded under the umbrella name, Sony Pictures Sports Network and began to phase in a rebranding as Sony Sports in 2020. Sony ESPN was shut down on 30 March 2020.

In June 2021, Sony launched Sony TEN 4, which broadcasts in the Telugu and Tamil languages. Actor Rana Daggubati served as a promotional ambassador for the network&#x27;s launch.

On 24 October 2022, the Sony Pictures Sports Network was rebranded as the Sony Sports Network, as part of a wider rebranding of all Sony Pictures Networks channels, under the versions of the global Sony television branding. Its channels were likewise rebranded under the new prefix Sony Sports Ten, and Sony Six was brought under the Ten branding for the first time as Sony Sports Ten 5.

<doc id="533177" wikidata="Q7376376" url="?curid=533177" title="Ruby River">
<text>The Ruby River is a tributary of the Beaverhead River, approximately 76 mi (122 km) long, in southwestern Montana in the United States. It rises in the Beaverhead National Forest in southwestern Madison County between the Snowcrest Range and the Gravelly Range. It flows north through the Ruby River Reservoir, past Alder, then northwest, flowing between the Tobacco Root Mountains to the northeast and the Ruby Range to the southwest. It joins the Beaverhead near Twin Bridges. The Beaverhead becomes the Jefferson River 2 mi (3.2 km) downstream where it joins the Big Hole River.

The river has also been known by these various names: Pah-mamar-roi, Pak-sam-ma-oi, Pashmaroi, Passamari, Philanthropy River, Stinking Water Creek, Stinking Water River, Stinkingwater River. 
The Ruby is a Class II river for stream access for recreational purposes.

== Ruby River angling ==
The Ruby River provides excellent fly fishing for anglers despite some battles with whirling disease and a massive fish kill in the lower stretches in 1994.

The upper stretch of the river, above Ruby Reservoir, has excellent fly fishing for rainbows, cutthroats and grayling. The lower stretch of the river, below Ruby Dam, provides excellent brown trout fishing. The average size of browns runs between 10-14 inches, with some fish reaching 18-20 inches. Because of limited access, fishing pressure on the lower river varies. Along private stretches, the river is rarely fished. Most of the angling is done at the few state access sites below the dam. This can cause significant crowding along those stretches, especially during the summer months.

===Seyler Lane access litigation===
In 2004, the Montana Public Land and Water Access Association (PLWAA) sued Madison County over access to the Ruby river via the Seyler Lane bridge south of Twin Bridges. Landowner James Cox Kennedy who had recently purchased the property was denying access to recreationalists via the Seyler Lane bridge. The litigation was finally resolved in 2014 when the Montana Supreme Court ruled in favor of the PLAWAA that there was an historic prescriptive easement at the bridge for recreational access. The litigation is a key milestone in Montana’s Stream Access Law.

<text>TrueSpace (styled as trueSpace) was a commercial 3D computer graphics and animation software developed by Caligari Corporation, bought-out by Microsoft. As of May 2009, it was officially discontinued, but with some &#x27;unofficial support&#x27; up to February 2010. 

== History ==
The company was founded in 1985 by Roman Ormandy. A prototype 3D video animation package for the Amiga Computer led to the incorporation of Octree Software in 1986. From 1988 to 1992, Octree released several software packages including Caligari1, Caligari2, Caligari Broadcast, and Caligari 24. Caligari wanted to provide inexpensive yet professional, industrial video and corporate presentation software. In 1993 Octree Software moved from New York to California and became known as Caligari Corporation. 

In 1994 trueSpace 1.0 was introduced on the Windows platform. In 1998 an employee inadvertently left a copy of the trueSpace 4.0 sourcecode on the company website&#x27;s public FTP server. The source code was released to the internet by the piracy release group REVOLT.
In early 2008, the company was acquired by Microsoft and trueSpace 7.6 was released for free.

==End of Life==
As of May 19, 2009, Ormandy announced that TrueSpace had been discontinued:

Elsewhere he thanks everyone, urges people to download all the free software as soon as possible. It may currently (as of 2023) be downloaded from a fan site along with various plugins.

After 2010, many of the developers helped develop Microsoft&#x27;s 3D Builder application available for free in the Windows Store. There are many similarities between 3D Builder and the original TrueSpace product.

== Overview ==
TrueSpace was a modeling/animation/rendering package. It featured a plug-in architecture that allowed the user to create tools to enhance the core package. TrueSpace was at the last release version 7 (also known to its users as tS7). Point upgrades had brought it up to version Rosetta Beta 7.61 and had added new modeling features. It also had an interface that beginners found easy to learn.

Caligari had enhanced the modeling, surfacing and rendering capabilities of TrueSpace, and the latest version TrueSpace7 allowed all aspects of real-time design, modeling and animation within a virtual 3D space shared by remote participants over the broadband internet. The TrueSpace7 collaboration server enables multiple participants to connect to a shared 3D space to create and manipulate shared content in real-time.

== Features ==
One of the most distinctive features of trueSpace is its interface, using mainly 3D widgets for most common editing operations. trueSpace can also be scripted, using Python for creating custom scripts, tools and plugins. trueSpace7 introduces the use of VBScript and JScript as scripting tools for developing plugins and interactive scenes. trueSpace is also known for its icon-heavy interface which was drastically overhauled for version 7 onwards. While staff at Caligari had originally made them &#x27;inhouse&#x27; during the creation process of earlier releases, trueSpace 7 had a new set of icons made by Paul Woodward, a freelance designer and illustrator.

Capabilities of the software include creating visualizations and animations with realistic lighting (through the use of radiosity, HDRI and global illumination) and organic modelling using NURBS, subdivision surfaces and metaballs.

The software has several native formats: RsScn for scenes, RsObj for objects, RSMat for materials, rsl for layouts, RsLgts for lighting, etc. Older formats native to trueSpace6.6 and earlier are also supported, e.g. one for standalone objects (with the file extension .cob), and another for the scenes (with the file extension .scn). Objects in trueSpace can be embedded in Active Worlds. In addition to its native formats, trueSpace can also import and export several additional model types.

== Modeling ==
*Polygon modeling
*NURBS
*Subdivision surface

== Rendering and surfacing ==
Currently TrueSpace has two native internal rendering engines and also support for DX9 pixel shader output quality images alongside the traditional style Render engines. These engines are:

* LightWorks (from Lightwork Design Ltd.)
* VirtuaLight 

TrueSpace7 also includes support for the VRay rendering engine.

<doc id="533193" wikidata="Q1890036" url="?curid=533193" title="Rush (video games)">
<text>In video games, rushing or rushdown is a battle tactic similar to the blitzkrieg or the human wave attack tactics in real-world ground warfare, in which speed and surprise are used to overwhelm an enemy&#x27;s ability to wage war, usually before the enemy is able to achieve an effective buildup of sizable defensive and/or expansionist capabilities.

It is also known as a zerg or zerg rush, a term which originated in the video game &quot;StarCraft&quot; to describe a common strategy for players of the Zerg race.

==Strategy games and tactical games==
In the real-time strategy game &quot;StarCraft&quot;, a &quot;Zerg rush&quot; is a strategy where a player using the Zerg race tries to overwhelm the opponent through large numbers of smaller units before the enemy is fully prepared for battle.

In strategy games, to perform a rush, the attacking player focuses on quickly building a large number of weak units (or some very rare and potent early game units) early on in the game with the hopes of swarming the opponents before they can defend themselves; this is to catch them off-guard and often to cripple the opponent&#x27;s economy structures. In the majority of cases, these units are fast and cheap to enable larger numbers and opportunistic attack strategies, but they may sometimes be chosen to exploit a particular weakness of the enemy. The player who rushes may sacrifice options such as long-term resource gathering, defense, or immediate research up the tech tree to opt instead for a quick strike, usually putting the rushing player at a severe disadvantage should the rush be unsuccessful.

A successful rush usually attempts to disrupt the resource gathering of the defending player or annihilate that player entirely. The rush is a risky tactic. If the rush is successful, then the player may have won the game or significantly set his or her opponent back; if the rush fails, then the rushing player may have lost valuable time and resources that would have been better spent on research, building defenses, and building more powerful units. A rush can also be considered a mass attack with primarily only one type of unit used, and depends on overwhelming numbers and force to succeed. The rush is often a suicidal attack (for the units involved); rushing units are often expected to die, but to nevertheless benefit the player initiating the rush by disrupting the opponent&#x27;s operations. Rushes may also be used to force an opponent between poor decisions. In video-games which track ammunition and other resources, such as in the &quot;Men of War&quot; and &quot;Wargame&quot; series, a rush forces an opponent to expend a limited resource (ammunition) to counter the attack, to retreat to evade the attack, or to not return the attack. The consequences of such means that an opponent will have less resources to fight another, well-structured assault, will have lost ground, or will have lost units, respectively.
An &quot;alpha strike&quot; denotes an all-out attack launched in hopes of achieving a decisive advantage, determining the inevitable defeat of the target before they can respond effectively. This is usually considered a risky manoeuvre, as if the attacker fails to gain a decisive advantage, it can leave the attacker&#x27;s units overextended and vulnerable to counter-attack.

<text>Sir Frederick Bowker Terrington Carter, (February 12, 1819 – March 1, 1900) was a lawyer and Premier of Newfoundland from 1865 to 1870 and from 1874 to 1878.

==Career==
Carter was the son of Peter Weston Carter grandson of William Carter and great-grandson of Robert Carter, who was appointed justice of the peace at Ferryland in 1750. In 1855, he was elected to the House of Assembly as a Conservative and was Speaker from 1861 to 1865. In 1865 he succeeded Sir Hugh Hoyles as Premier.

Carter was a supporter of Canadian confederation having been a delegate to the 1864 Quebec conference. However, the Conservatives were defeated on the Confederation issue in the November 1869 election by the Anti-Confederation Party led by Charles Fox Bennett. Even though Newfoundland did not join the confederation until 1949, Carter is considered one of the Fathers of Confederation. Carter became Premier a second time in 1874, serving until 1878, but had dropped the issue of joining Canada. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in 1878.

In 1880 Carter was appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland, succeeding Sir Hugh Hoyles, and served in the post until 1898. During his term as Chief Justice, Carter was a valued advisor for the Colonial Governors of Newfoundland and acted as administrator of the colony in their absence.

Carter was a Freemason of St. John&#x27;s Lodge, No. 579, a Newfoundland lodge under the United Grand Lodge of England.

He died in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland in early March 1900.

==Family==
Carter married, in 1846, Eliza Bayly, daughter of George Bayly, Controller of HM Customs, Newfoundland. The couple had eleven children.

<doc id="533196" wikidata="Q4114622" url="?curid=533196" title="Stimulation">
<text>Stimulation is the encouragement of development or the cause of activity in general. For example, &quot;The press provides stimulation of political discourse.&quot; An interesting or fun activity can be described as &quot;stimulating&quot;, regardless of its physical effects on senses. &quot;Stimulate&quot; means to act as a stimulus to; &quot;stimulus&quot; means something that rouses the recipient to activity; &quot;stimuli&quot; is the plural of &quot;stimulus&quot;.

A particular use of the term is physiological stimulation, which refers to sensory excitation, the action of various agents or forms of energy (stimuli) on receptors that generate impulses that travel through nerves to the brain (afferents). There are sensory receptors on or near the surface of the body, such as photoreceptors in the retina of the eye, hair cells in the cochlea of the ear, touch receptors in the skin and chemical receptors in the mouth and nasal cavity. There are also sensory receptors in the muscles, joints, digestive tract, and membranes around organs such as the brain, the abdominal cavity, the bladder and the prostate (providing one source of sexual stimulation). Stimulation to the external or internal senses may evoke involuntary activity or guide intentions in action. Such emotional or motivating stimulation typically is also experienced subjectively (enters awareness, is in consciousness). Perception can be regarded as conceptualised stimulation, used in reasoning and intending, for example. When bodily stimulation is perceived it is traditionally called a sensation, such as a kind of touch or a taste or smell, or a painful or pleasurable sensation. This can be thought of as psychological stimulation, which is a stimulus affecting a person&#x27;s thinking or feeling processes.

==Overview==
Stimulation, in general, refers to how organisms perceive incoming stimuli. As such it is part of the stimulus-response mechanism. Simple organisms broadly react in three ways to stimulation: too little stimulation causes them to stagnate, too much to die from stress or inability to adapt, and a medium amount causes them to adapt and grow as they overcome it. Similar categories or effects are noted with psychological stress with people. Thus, stimulation may be described as how external events provoke a response by an individual in the attempt to cope.

==Over-stimulation==

It is possible to become habituated to a particular degree of stimulation, and then find it uncomfortable to have a significant change from that level of the stimulus. Thus one can become used to intense stimuli or a fast-paced life and suffer withdrawal when they are removed. Stress and unhappiness may result an unaccustomed level of stimulation.

Ongoing, long-term stimulation can for some individuals prove harmful, and a more relaxed and less stimulated life may be beneficial despite possible initial discomfort or stress from the change. See also; sensory overload and burnout.

Chiropractor James Wilson has hypothesized that long-term overstimulation can result eventually in a phenomenon called adrenal fatigue, but there is no evidence that such a condition exists.

<text>The Kosovo Force (KFOR) is a NATO-led international peacekeeping force and military of Kosovo. KFOR is the third security responder, after the Kosovo Police and the EU Rule of Law (EULEX) mission, respectively, with whom NATO peacekeeping forces work in close coordination. Its operations are gradually reducing until the Kosovo Security Force, established in 2009, becomes self-sufficient.

KFOR entered Kosovo on 12 June 1999, one day after the United Nations Security Council adopted the UNSC Resolution 1244. At the time, Kosovo was facing a grave humanitarian crisis, with military forces from Yugoslavia in action against the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) in daily engagements. Nearly one million people had fled Kosovo as refugees by that time, and many permanently did not return.

Currently, 28 states contribute to the KFOR, with a combined strength of approximately 4,686 military personnel.

==Objectives==
KFOR focuses on building a secure environment and guaranteeing the freedom of movement through all Kosovo territory for all citizens, irrespective of their ethnic origins, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1244.

The Contact Group countries have said publicly that KFOR will remain in Kosovo to provide the security necessary to support the final settlement of Kosovo authorities.

==Structure==
KFOR contingents were grouped into five multinational brigades and a lead nation designated for each multinational brigade. All national contingents pursued the same objective to maintain a secure environment in Kosovo.

In August 2005, the North Atlantic Council decided to restructure KFOR, replacing the five existing multinational brigades with five task forces, to allow for greater flexibility with, removing restrictions on the cross-boundary movement of units based in different sectors of Kosovo. Then in February 2010, the Multinational Task Forces became Multinational Battle Groups, and in March 2011, KFOR was restructured again, into just two multinational battlegroups; one based at Camp Bondsteel, and one based at Peja.

In August 2019, the KFOR structure was streamlined. Under the new structure, the former Multinational Battlegroups are reflagged as Regional Commands, with Regional Command-East (RC-E) based at Camp Bondsteel, and Regional Command-West (RC-W) based at Camp Villaggio Italia.

=== Structure 2023 ===

** Multinational Specialized Unit (MSU), in Pristina (Military Police, crowd and riot control, peacekeeping operations regiment composed entirely of Italian Carabinieri)
** KFOR Tactical Reserve Battalion (KTRBN), at Camp Novo Selo (composed entirely of Hungarian Army troops)
*Kosovo Force Office, at Skopje International Airport

==Contributing states==

At its height, KFOR troops consisted of 50,000 men and women coming from 39 different NATO and non-NATO nations. The official KFOR website indicated that in 2008 a total 14,000 soldiers from 34 countries were participating in KFOR. The following list shows the number of troops which have participated in the KFOR mission. Most of the force has been downsized since 2008; current numbers are reflected here as well:

==Kosovo peacekeeping==

===Events===
On 9 June 1999 the Military Technical Agreement or Kumanovo Agreement between KFOR and the Governments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Serbia was signed by NATO General Sir Mike Jackson and Yugoslavia Colonel General Svetozar Marjanovic concluding the Kosovo War. This agreement outlined a rapid withdrawal of Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Forces from Kosovo, assigning to the KFOR Commander the airspace control over Kosovo and pending the later United Nations Security Council Resolution&#x27;s approval, the deployment of KFOR to Kosovo. On 10 June 1999 the United Nations Security Council adopted the UNSC Resolution 1244 authorizing the deployment in Kosovo of an international civil and security presence for an initial period of 12 months, and to continue thereafter unless the UNSC decides otherwise. The civil presence was represented by the United Nations Mission In Kosovo (UNMIK), while the security presence was led by KFOR.

Following the adoption of UNSCR 1244, General Jackson, acting on the instructions of the North Atlantic Council, made immediate preparations for the rapid deployment of the security force (Operation Joint Guardian), mandated by the United Nations Security Council. The first NATO-led elements entered Kosovo at 5 a.m. on 12 June. On 21 June, the UCK undertaking of demilitarization and transformation was signed by COMKFOR and the Commander in Chief of the UCK (Mr. Hashim Thaci), moving KFOR into a new phase of enforcing the peace and supporting the implementation of a civil administration under the auspices of the United Nations.

Within three weeks of KFOR entry, more than half a million out of those who had left during the bombing were back in Kosovo. However, in the months following KFOR deployment, approximately 150,000 Serbs, Romani and other non-Albanians fled Kosovo while many of the remaining civilians were subjected to violence and intimidation from ethnic Albanians.

October 28, 2000 the first Municipal Assembly Elections were held. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE) announced that approximately 80% of the population participated in this vote for local representatives. The final results were certified by the Special Representative for Kosovo of the UN Secretary-General, Bernard Kouchner, on 7 November.

KFOR was initially composed of 40,000 troops from NATO countries. Troop levels were reduced to 26,000 by June 2003, then to 17,500 by the end that year. Combat troops were reduced more than support troops. KFOR tried to deal with this by transferring tasks to UNMIK and the Kosovo Police Service (KPS), but UNMIK was also reducing its number of international police, and KPS were not numerous enough or competent enough to take over from KFOR.

The 2004 unrest in Kosovo was the worst ethnic violence since 1999, leaving hundreds wounded and at least 14 people dead. On 17 and 18 March 2004, a wave of violent riots swept through Kosovo, triggered by two incidents perceived as ethnically motivated acts. The first incident, on 15 March 2004, an 18-year-old Serb was shot near the all Serb village of Čaglavica, near Pristina.
On 16 March, three Albanian children drowned in the Ibar River in the village of Čabar, near the Serb community of Zubin Potok. A fourth boy survived. It was speculated that he and his friends had been chased into the river by Serbs in revenge for the shooting of Ivić the previous day, but this claim has not been proven. According to Human Rights Watch, the violence in March 2004 left 19 dead, 954 wounded, 550 homes destroyed, twenty-seven Orthodox churches and monasteries burned, and leaving approximately 4,100 Serbs, Roma, Ashkali (Albanian-speaking Roma), and other non-Albanian minorities displaced. Nineteen people, eight Kosovo Serbs and eleven Kosovo Albanians, were killed and over a thousand wounded-including more than 120 KFOR soldiers and UNMIK police officers, and fifty-eight Kosovo Police Service (KPS) officers.

The 10 February 2007 protest in Kosovo resulted in 2 deaths and many injuries. A crowd of ethnic Albanians in Pristina protested against a UN plan, also known as the Ahtisaari Plan, they felt fell short of granting full independence for Kosovo. The proposals, unveiled 2 February, recommended a form of self-rule and was strongly opposed by Serbia. The UN Security Council did not endorse the plan.

On February 17, 2008 unrest followed Kosovo&#x27;s declaration of independence . Some Kosovo Serbs opposed to secession boycotted the move by refusing to follow orders from the central government in Pristina and attempted to seize infrastructure and border posts in Serb-populated regions. There were also sporadic instances of violence against international institutions and governmental institutions, predominantly in North Kosovo. After declaring independence, the Kosovo government introduced new customs stamps, a symbol of their newly declared sovereignty. Serbia refused to recognize the customs stamps which led to the de facto prohibition of both direct import of goods from Kosovo to Serbia, as well as transit to third countries. Goods from Serbia, however, could still be freely imported into Kosovo. Pursuant to the Statement by the President of the Security Council on 26 November 2008 (S/PRST/2008/44), UNMIK was restructured and its rule of law executive tasks were transferred to EULEX. EULEX maintains a limited residual capability as a second security responder and provides continued support to Kosovo Police&#x27;s crowd and riot control capability.

The 25 August 2009 Pristina protests resulted in vehicle damages and multiple injuries.

On 22 July 2010, the International Court of Justice delivered its advisory opinion on Kosovo&#x27;s declaration of independence declaring that &quot;the adoption of the declaration of independence of the 17 February 2008 did not violate general international law because international law contains no &#x27;prohibition on declarations of independence&#x27;,&quot; nor did the adoption of the declaration of independence violate UN Security Council Resolution 1244, since this did not describe Kosovo&#x27;s final status, nor had the Security Council reserved for itself the decision on final status.

20 July 2011 Kosovo banned all imports from Serbia and introduced 10 percent tax for imports from Bosnia as both countries blocked exports from Kosovo. On 26 July 2011, a series of confrontations in North Kosovo began with a Kosovo Police operation to seize two border outposts along the Kosovo Serbia border and consequent clashes continued until 23 November. The clashes, resulting in multiple deaths and injuries, were over differences between who would administer the border crossings between Kosovo and Serbia along with what would happen with the revenue collected from the customs and removal of roadblocks to secure freedom of movement. On 3 September 2011, a deal to unblock the impasse between Serbia and Kosovo over exports was struck at EU-led negotiations in Brussels. Serbia agreed to accept goods marked “Kosovo Customs”, while Pristina gave up including state emblems, coats of arms, flags, or use of the word “republic” allowing Kosovo to interpret the label as referring to the customs of independent Kosovo, whereas Serbia could see it as a provincial customs label.

On 14 and 15 February 2012, an advisory referendum on accepting the institutions of the Republic of Kosovo was held in North Kosovo. 1 June 2012 Kosovo Serbs and a KFOR soldier were wounded when peacekeepers tried to dismantle Serb barricades, among the last on major roads yet to be dismantled, blocking traffic.

On 8 February 2013, a series of protests began against increases in electricity bills which later turned into protests against corruption. On 19 April 2013, the Belgrade Pristina Normalization Agreement was signed between the governments of Kosovo and Serbia. Prior, North Kosovo functioned independently from the institutions in Kosovo by refusing to recognize Kosovo&#x27;s 2008 declaration of independence and the Government of Kosovo opposed any parallel government for Serbs. The Brussels Agreement abolished the parallel structures and both governments agreed upon creating a Community of Serb Municipalities. The association was expected to be officially formed in 2016 but continued discussions has resulted in not forming the Community. By signing the Agreement, the European Union&#x27;s Commission considered Serbia had met key steps in its relations with Kosovo and recommended that negotiations for accession of Serbia to the European Union be opened. Several days after the agreement was reached, the European Commission recommended authorizing the launch of negotiations between the EU and Kosovo on the Stabilisation and Association Process.

The 2014 student protest in Kosovo demanded the resignation or dismissal of the University of Pristina Rector. Students threw red paint and rocks at the Kosovo Police who responded with tear gas. 30 Kosovo Police officers were injured and more than 30 students were arrested. The upper airspace over Kosovo, skies over 10,000 feet, was re-opened for civilian traffic overflights on 3 April 2014. This followed a decision by the North Atlantic Council to accept the offer by the Government of Hungary to act as a technical enabler through its national air navigation service provider, Hungarocontrol.

The 2015 Kosovo protests were a series of violent protests calling for the resignation of a Minister and the passage of a bill on Trepca Mines ownership. On 6 January protestors claiming that among the pilgrims visiting a local church for Orthodox Christmas included displaced Serbs from Gjakova involved in war crimes against Albanians in 1998-1999 threw blocks of ice at the bus breaking one of its windows. Kosovo Police arrested two protestors. The Minister For Community and Return, who accompanied the pilgrims, made a statement that was perceived by Kosovo Albanians as an ethnic slur leading to riots. The rioters, which included students and opposition parties, demanded his resignation and he was dismissed by the Kosovo Prime Minister. The Kosovo government&#x27;s announcement it was postponing a decision on the privatization process of the Trepca mining complex after Serb Kosovo Parliamentary Representatives protested claiming that the Serbian government had the right to retain ownership was met with student-led protests in Pristina, Lipljan and Ferizaj/Urosevac, Kosovo Albanian Miners in South Trepca and Kosovo Serbian Miners in North Trepca. Trepca&#x27;s lead, zinc, and silver mines once accounted for 75 percent of the mineral wealth of socialist Yugoslavia, employing 20,000 people. Trepca now operates at a minimum level to keep the mines alive employing several thousand miners. The Trepca mines are under the oversight of the Kosovo Privatization Agency.

9 January 2016, thousands of protestors wanted the government to withdraw from a border demarcation agreement with Montenegro and an agreement to set up a Community of Serb Municipalities. Police fired tear gas responding to protesters who threw Molotov cocktails and set fire to a government building. The Kosovo Assembly later withdrew the agreements.

On 14 January 2017, the Belgrade-Kosovska Mitrovica train incident happened when rhetoric was exchanged between Kosovo and Serbian Officials after Serbia announced restarting train service between Kosovo and Serbia and Kosovo responded stating that the train would be stopped at the border. The initial train was painted in the colors of the Serbian flag with the words “Kosovo is Serbia” printed down the side which was considered provocative by Kosovo Officials and Kosovo Officials stated that Police would stop it at the border. The train traveled from Belgrade to the border town of Raska and returned never crossing into Kosovo. Train service between Kosovo and Serbia remains non-existent.

On 21 March 2018, Kosovo&#x27;s Assembly ratified the border agreement with Montenegro. The European Union set ratification as a condition before it would grant Kosovo nationals visa-free access to the pass-port free Schengen area. 8 September, Serbia&#x27;s president visited North Kosovo&#x27;s Gazivode Lake, an important source of Kosovo&#x27;s water. The following day, his planned visit to the majority-Serb village Banje was cancelled by the Kosovo government after Kosovo Albanian protestors put up barricades at the village&#x27;s entrance. 29 Sept, Kosovo&#x27;s president visited Gazivode Lake. Serbia accused Kosovo police of seizing control of the lake and briefly detaining workers and Kosovo said police were there to provide security for the visit and nobody was detained. A Kosovo Serbian representative said Serbia was putting its military as well as police under high alert as a result. 20 November The international police agency (INTERPOL), rejected Kosovo&#x27;s membership. On 21 November, Kosovo imposed an import tax on Serbian and Bosnia Herzogovina goods. Kosovo said the tariff would be lifted when Serbia recognizes its sovereignty and stops blocking it from joining international organizations and Serbia said it will not participate in further dialogue until the measure is lifted.

On 1 July 2021, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg confirmed that the KFOR mission would continue. 

On 29 May 2023, more than 30 NATO peacekeeping soldiers defending three town halls in northern Kosovo were injured in clashes with Serb protesters, while Serbia&#x27;s president put the army on the highest level of combat alert.
The tense situation developed after ethnic Albanian mayors took office in northern Kosovo&#x27;s Serb-majority area after elections that the Serbs boycotted.

On 29 September 2023, the NATO Secretary-General announced the authorisation of additional forces to address the build up of Serbian troops on the border of Kosovo and Serbia in order to keep peace within the region.

<doc id="533199" wikidata="Q1329492" url="?curid=533199" title="S-Methylmethionine">
<text>&quot;S&quot;-Methylmethionine (SMM) is a derivative of methionine with the chemical formula (CH3)2S+CH2CH2CH(NH3+)CO2−. This cation is a naturally-occurring intermediate in many biosynthetic pathways owing to the sulfonium functional group. It is biosynthesized from -methionine and &quot;S&quot;-adenosylmethionine by the enzyme methionine &quot;S&quot;-methyltransferase. &quot;S&quot;-methylmethionine is particularly abundant in plants, being more abundant than methionine.

&quot;S&quot;-Methylmethionine is sometimes referred to as &quot;vitamin U&quot;, but it is not considered a true vitamin. The term was coined in 1950 by Garnett Cheney for uncharacterized anti-ulcerogenic factors in raw cabbage juice that may help speed healing of peptic ulcers.

==Biosynthesis and biochemical function==
&quot;S&quot;-Methylmethionine arises via the methylation of methionine by &quot;S&quot;-adenosyl methionine (SAM). The coproduct is &quot;S&quot;-adenosyl homocysteine.

The biological roles of &quot;S&quot;-methylmethionine are not well understood. Speculated roles include methionine storage, use as a methyl donor, regulation of SAM. A few plants use &quot;S&quot;-methylmethionine as a precursor to the osmolyte dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP). Intermediates include dimethylsulfoniumpropylamine and dimethylsulfoniumpropionaldehyde.

==Beer flavor precursor in barley malt==
&quot;S&quot;-Methylmethionine is found in barley and is further created during the malting process. SMM can be subsequently converted to dimethyl sulfide (DMS) during the malt kilning process, causing an undesirable flavor. Lightly kilned malts such as pilsner or lager malts retain much of their SMM content while higher kilned malt such as pale ale malt has substantially more of the SMM converted to DMS in the malt. Darker kilned malts such as Munich malt have virtually no SMM content since most has been converted to DMS. Other crystal malts and roasted malts have no SMM content and often no DMS content since the kilning also drives that compound out of the malt.

<text>The Big Hole River is a tributary of the Jefferson River, approximately 153 miles (246 km) long, in Beaverhead County, in southwestern Montana, United States. It is the last habitat in the contiguous United States for native fluvial Arctic grayling and is a historically popular destination for fly fishing, especially for trout.

==History==
At the time the Lewis and Clark Expedition traveled through the Big Hole River watershed, it was a buffer zone between several rival Native American tribes including the Nez Percé, Shoshone, Coast Salish, and Blackfeet. Lewis and Clark considered navigating up the Big Hole River, but chose the slower-flowing Beaverhead River instead. Trappers from both the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, the North West Company and the American Fur Company exploited the region from about 1810 to the 1840s. Miners and homesteaders settled the area between 1864 and the early 1900s. The Montana Salish called the river &quot;Sk͏ʷumcné Sewɫk͏ʷs&quot;, meaning &quot;waters of the pocket gopher&quot;.

In 1877 the U.S. troops under John Gibbon fought the Nez Percé Indians along the Big Hole River, during the Nez Perce War in the Battle of the Big Hole. The site of the battle along the North fork of the Big Hole is preserved as the Big Hole National Battlefield.

The establishment of Butte, Montana as a mining center and the coming of the Northern Railroad in 1871 assured Big Hole ranchers and farmers of a steady market for their beef, horses, mules, hay and dairy products. Ranches grew along the river from railroad supply points such as Divide, Montana. As a great improvement for preserving the wild hay for winter feeding of cattle, Herbert S. Armitage and David J. Stephens filed for a &quot;Hay-Stacker&quot; patent in 1909, which was awarded in 1910. This device, commonly known as a &quot;beaverslide&quot; remained popular until the 1990s, when it was largely displaced by mechanized equipment for producing large round bales.

==Watershed and course==
The Big Hole River watershed drains .

The source of the mainstem Big Hole River is Skinner Lake in the Beaverhead National Forest in the Beaverhead Mountains of the Bitterroot Range at the Continental Divide along the Montana-Idaho border in western Beaverhead County. However, Skinner Lake is in turn fed by Darkhorse Creek, which flows from Darkhorse and Cowbone Lakes, the former at . The Big Hole River flows northwest and north, past Wisdom and between the Anaconda Range to the northwest and the Pioneer Mountains to the east.

It flows around the north end of the Pioneers where it forms the border between Beaverhead County and Deer Lodge County and then Silver Bow County, then southeast past the town of Wise River, Montana, where it is joined by the Wise River. Near Glen, Montana it turns northeast and joins the Beaverhead River near Twin Bridges to form the Jefferson River, a tributary of the Missouri.

==Ecology and conservation==
Historic conflicts exist between ranchers in the valley who use the river for irrigation and recreationalists. In the early 1960s, the US Bureau of Reclamation proposed building the Reichle Dam near the town of Glen along the Big Hole River. Conservationist George F. Grant, Trout Unlimited and local ranchers combined forces to oppose the dam, successfully defeating the proposal in 1967.

===Grayling===
The Big Hole is the last habitat in the contiguous United States for native fluvial (river-dwelling) Arctic grayling (&quot;Thymallis arcticus&quot;). Fluvial Arctic grayling lived historically in the United States only in Michigan and the upper Missouri River above Great Falls, Montana. Adfluvial or lake-dwelling Arctic grayling, still thrive across the western half of Montana. The fluvial population comprises the Upper Missouri River distinct population segment (DPS) population. The two populations are commonly called Montana Arctic grayling. The Big Hole River Watershed Committee (BHWC) was formed in 1995 by several Big Hole ranchers and some factions of the conservation community who opposed an ESA listing for fluvial Arctic grayling. The Watershed Committee reached out to local and selected interested entities and developed a viable community-based consensus group to forge solutions to difficult problems that impact the river. The committee was criticized for exclusion of activist voices such as the Center for Biological Diversity and the Montana Wildlife Federation. In response, organizations such as the Big Hole River Foundation were formed, with the goal &quot;to understand, preserve, and enhance the free flowing character of the Big Hole River and to protect its watershed, culture, community and excellent wild trout fishery.&quot;

After years of debate by all interests in the Big Hole watershed, in April 2007, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) removed the fluvial Arctic Grayling from Endangered Species candidacy, which has resulted in a lawsuit by the Center for Biological Diversity and other interested parties, who have stated the view that the USFWS decision was politically mandated by Julie MacDonald, the former Department of Interior official who has since resigned. An Office of the Inspector General investigation found that &quot;MacDonald has been heavily involved with editing, commenting on, and reshaping the Endangered Species Program&#x27;s scientific reports.&quot; In the case of grayling, MacDonald ignored clear genetic differences between extremely rare fluvial (river) grayling and relatively common lacustrine (lake) grayling. In 2014, The USFWS again affirmed that local conservation efforts are sufficient to protect the grayling, and declined to list the DPS of the grayling as federally endangered.

An environmental DNA assay using tissue samples from grayling in the Bighole River can identify grayling with high specificity against other native and non-native salmonids in Montana.

==Angling the Big Hole==
The Big Hole river has been a destination for trout fisherman since the late 1880s when &quot;The Angler&#x27;s Guide&quot;, an Eastern angling journal advertised the Big Hole as a national destination fishery for grayling and trout while promising daily catches. Although the river still holds some native westslope cutthroat trout, their populations are almost non-existent. Instead, the river holds healthy wild populations of brook, rainbow and brown trout which were first introduced into the Big Hole in late 1880s as hatchery operations began in Butte and Bozeman, Montana. Native mountain whitefish are also prevalent in the river. In the 1980s, the state of Montana began stopping general stocking of all Montana rivers. The last hatchery fish were stocked in the Big Hole in 1990. Dozens of guides, outfitters and fishing lodges offer guided fishing on the Big Hole and its tributaries. The river is catch and release for brown trout (Dickey bridge to mouth)

The river is a Class I water from the Fishtrap fishing access site downstream from Wisdom to its confluence with the Jefferson River. This status affects the level of public access for recreational purposes.

<text>Place theory is a theory of hearing that states that our perception of sound depends on where each component frequency produces vibrations along the basilar membrane. By this theory, the pitch of a sound, such as a human voice or a musical tone, is determined by the places where the membrane vibrates, based on frequencies corresponding to the tonotopic organization of the primary auditory neurons.

More generally, schemes that base attributes of auditory perception on the neural firing rate as a function of place are known as rate–place schemes.

The main alternative to the place theory is the temporal theory, also known as timing theory. These theories are closely linked with the volley principle or volley theory, a mechanism by which groups of neurons can encode the timing of a sound waveform. In all cases, neural firing patterns in time determine the perception of pitch. The combination known as the place–volley theory uses both mechanisms in combination, primarily coding low pitches by temporal pattern and high pitches by rate–place patterns. It is now generally believed that there is good evidence for both mechanisms.

The place theory is usually attributed to Hermann Helmholtz, though it was widely believed much earlier.

Experiments to distinguish between place theory and rate theory are difficult to devise, because of the strong correlation: large vibrations with low rate are produced at the apical end of the basilar membrane while large vibrations with high rate are produced at the basal end. The two can be controlled independently using cochlear implants: pulses with a range of rates can be applied via electrodes distributed along the membrane. Experiments using implant recipients showed that, at low stimulation rates, ratings of pitch on a pitch scale were proportional to the log of stimulation rate, but also decreased with distance from the round window. At higher rates, the effect of rate was weaker, but the effect of place was strong.

<text>John Cody Fidler-Simpson (born 9 August 1944) is an English foreign correspondent who is currently the world affairs editor of BBC News. He has spent all his working life with the BBC, and has reported from more than 120 countries, including thirty war zones, and interviewed many world leaders. He was educated at Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he read English and was editor of &quot;Granta&quot; magazine.

==Early life and education==
Simpson was born on 9 August 1944 in Cleveleys, Lancashire, but was taken to his mother&#x27;s &quot;bomb-damaged house in London&quot; the following week. He says in his autobiography that his father Roy, a property developer, was a Christian scientist. His parents separated when he was seven years old and he chose to remain with his father while his mother cared for his two half sisters. He spent ten years growing up in Dunwich in Suffolk. He was educated at Dulwich College Preparatory School and St Paul&#x27;s School, followed by Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he read English and was editor of &quot;Granta&quot; magazine. In 1965 he was a member of the Magdalene &quot;University Challenge&quot; team. A year later Simpson started as a trainee sub-editor at BBC radio news.

==Career==
Simpson became a BBC reporter in 1970. Early in his career, the then prime minister Harold Wilson, angered by being asked whether he was about to call an election, punched Simpson in the stomach.

Simpson was the BBC&#x27;s political editor in 1980–81. He presented the &quot;Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; in 1981–82 and became diplomatic editor in 1982. He had also served as a correspondent in South Africa, Brussels and Dublin. He became BBC world affairs editor in 1988 and presented an occasional current affairs programme, &quot;Simpson&#x27;s World&quot;.

Simpson&#x27;s reporting career includes the following episodes:
* In November 1969 he interviewed the exiled King of Buganda, Mutesa II, hours before the latter&#x27;s death in his London flat from alcohol poisoning. The official cause was suicide but some suspected assassination. Simpson told the police the following day that the king, a fellow-graduate of Magdalene College, Cambridge, had been sober and in good spirits, but this line of enquiry was not pursued.
* He travelled back from Paris to Tehran with the exiled Ayatollah Khomeini on 1 February 1979, a return that heralded the Iranian Revolution, as millions lined the streets of the capital.
* In 1989 he avoided bullets at the Beijing Tiananmen Square massacre.
* Simpson reported the fall of the Ceauşescu regime in Bucharest later that year.
* He spent the early part of the 1991 Gulf War in Baghdad, before being expelled by the authorities.
* Simpson reported from Belgrade during the Kosovo War of 1999, where he was one of a handful of journalists to remain in the Yugoslav capital after the authorities, at the start of the conflict, expelled those from NATO countries.
* Two years later, he was one of the first reporters to enter Afghanistan in 2001, famously disguising himself by wearing a burqa, and subsequently Kabul in the US-led invasion of Afghanistan.
* Simpson was hunted by Robert Mugabe&#x27;s forces in Zimbabwe.
* In 2002 he had an interview with the Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn just four days before his assassination. Fortuyn was not happy with Simpson and his questions and so sent him away just five minutes after the start of the interview.
* He was the first BBC journalist to answer questions in a war zone from internet users via BBC News Online.
* While reporting on a non-embedded basis from Northern Iraq in the 2003 Iraq war, Simpson was injured in a friendly fire incident when a U.S. warplane bombed the convoy of American and Kurdish forces he was with. The attack was caught on film: a member of Simpson&#x27;s crew was killed and he himself was left deaf in one ear.

In 2008 and 2009, Simpson participated in a BBC programme called &quot;Top Dogs: Adventures in War, Sea and Ice&quot;. It saw Simpson unite with fellow Britons Sir Ranulph Fiennes, the adventurer, and Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, the round-the-world yachtsman. The team went on three trips, experiencing each other&#x27;s adventure field. The first episode, aired on 27 March 2009, saw Simpson, Fiennes and Knox-Johnston go on a news-gathering trip to Afghanistan. The team reported from the Khyber Pass and the Tora Bora mountain complex. The three also undertook a voyage around Cape Horn and an expedition hauling sledges across the deep-frozen Frobisher Bay in the far north of Canada.

During the 2011 Libyan civil war Simpson travelled with the rebels during their westward offensive, reporting on the war from the front lines and coming under fire on several occasions.

In 2016 Simpson presented a &quot;Panorama&quot; special, &quot;John Simpson: 50 Years on the Frontline&quot;, revisiting the people and places that have impacted on him most, revealing his thoughts on the challenges for the future.

In 2018, he described how a previous head of BBC News had recently tried to force him out of the BBC. &quot;I wasn&#x27;t the only one: he did the same to several eminent broadcasters, on the grounds that the news department was clogged at the top by the aged. I was unsighted by being assured regularly how wonderful my contribution to the BBC was. &#x27;I&#x27;d be distraught if you left&#x27;, he said.&quot;

Since 2022 he regularly presents Unspun World with John Simpson for BBC, dissecting political opinions from around the world as their world affairs editor.

==Awards==
Simpson has received various awards, including a CBE in the Gulf War honours list in 1991, an International Emmy for his report for the &quot;BBC Ten O&#x27;Clock News&quot; on the fall of Kabul, the Golden Nymph at the Cannes Film Festival, a Peabody award in the US, and three BAFTAs. He was appointed an honorary fellow of his old college at Cambridge, Magdalene, in 2000, and became the first Chancellor of Roehampton University in 2005.

Various universities have awarded him honorary doctorates: De Montfort, Suffolk College at the University of East Anglia, Nottingham, Dundee, Southampton, Sussex, St Andrews, Exeter and Leeds. He has received the Ischia International Journalism Award and the Bayeux-Calvados Award for war correspondents. In June 2011 he was made a Freeman of the City of London. Simpson was honoured by the City of Westminster at a Marylebone tree planting ceremony in May 2012.

==Personal life==
Simpson entered his first marriage in 1965 to American Diane Jean Petteys, with whom he has two daughters who were born in 1969 and 1971, respectively. Following his divorce, he married Dee (Adele) Kruger, a South African television producer, in 1996. Their son Rafe was born in January 2006 when Simpson was 61. Simpson, whose grandmother was born in Ireland, holds British and Irish citizenship; he moved back to London in 2005 after living in Ireland for several years.

In an interview with the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; Simpson admitted to using a legal tax avoidance scheme to purchase his London home in 2004, but stated that he would abandon the scheme and pay all applicable domestic taxes on its sale.

He is an Anglican and worships at Chelsea Old Church.

<doc id="533214" wikidata="Q2330674" url="?curid=533214" title="Dwarfing">
<text>Dwarfing is a process in which a breed of animals or cultivar of plants is changed to become significantly smaller than standard members of their species. The effect can be induced through human intervention or non-human processes, and can include genetic, nutritional or hormonal means. Used most specifically, dwarfing includes pathogenic changes in the structure of an organism (for example, the bulldog, a genetically achondroplastic dog breed), in contrast to non-pathogenic proportional reduction in stature (such as the whippet, a small sighthound dog breed).

==Animals==
In animals, including humans, dwarfism has been described in several ways. Shortened stature can result from growth hormone deficiency, starvation, portal systemic shunts, renal disease, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus and other conditions. Any of these conditions can be established in a population through genetic engineering, selective breeding, or insular dwarfism, or some combination of the above.

Dwarfing can produce more practical breeds that can fit in small accommodations, or may appeal aesthetically, as well as other associated side effects. Smaller stature may be a deliberate goal of breeding programs, or it may be a side effect of other breeding goals.

===Nonpurposeful dwarfing===

In some husbandry conditions, humans created dwarf breeds, or allowed them to develop, without specifically selecting for smaller animals. It is likely that the Shetland sheep breed, Shetland collie breed of dogs, and various pony breeds of horses developed in this manner. In the case of the Shetland sheep and collies, it is likely that environmental conditions, such as a lack of abundant fodder, led to farmers selecting smaller animals who continued to reproduce on limited food over larger animals who did not reproduce well on limited diets. In this case, the emphasis was on selecting for survival and reproduction, not size.

===Purposeful dwarfing===

Humans have encouraged the deliberate development of dwarf breeds of many domestic animals, including horses, cattle, dogs, and chickens. Some have been breeds of smaller animals that were not originally selected for size, but are now held to specific sizes by a breed standard. In many cases, the exact physiological mechanism that alters the growth of individuals in that breed is not well known, and some breeds have multiple mechanisms at play.

As the genetic mutations that cause dwarfing occur in many species, dwarf animals can be the offspring of normal-appearing animals. Even in breeds which have not been selected for dwarfing, some genetic lines may show a tendency to produce dwarfs, which may be encouraged by deliberate breeding. This often takes the form of in-breeding to concentrate recessive genes, and can result in other genetic abnormalities being established in the population.

Some animal breeds that have been formally subject to dwarfing include:

* Rabbits (American Fuzzy Lop, Britannia Petite (US), Dwarf Hotot, Florida White Rabbit, Jersey Wooly, Lionhead Polish (UK), Holland Lop Netherland Dwarf, Mini Rex, Mini Satin, others)
* Dogs (English Bulldog, French Bulldog, Chihuahua, Corgi, Whippet, Miniature Pinscher, others)
* Poultry (Bantam chickens, Call Ducks)
* Goats (Nigerian Dwarf, Pygmy Goat)
* Cattle (Dwarf Brahman, Lowline cattle Guinea Cracker Cattle, Dexter cattle)
* Equines (Miniature Donkey, Fell Pony, Hackney Pony Miniature horse, Shetland Pony, others)

==Plants==
As with animals, plants can be dwarfed through genetic engineering and selective breeding, but can also undergo natural, morphological changes to acclimatize to environmental stresses such as soil quality, light, drought, flood, cold, infection, and herbivory resulting in a dwarfed stature. Plants dwarfed due to environmental stress are said to be &quot;stunted.&quot; The majority of dwarfing in plants occurs not from the damage environmental stresses inflict on them, but instead by hormones produced in response to the stress. Plant hormones act as a signal to the various tissues of plants inducing one or more responses, the class of plant hormone responsible for dwarfing in plants due to injury are called jasmonates. Such responses include, but are not limited to: less frequent cell divisions and reduction of cell elongation.

===Dwarfing trees===

In horticulture, dwarfing can be considered a desirable characteristic in modern orchards. This kind of dwarfing can be attained through selective breeding, genetic engineering, or more often, scions are grafted on to dwarfing rootstocks. Almost all modern apples in commercial use are propagated as dwarf or semi-dwarf trees for ease of picking and spraying.

Dwarfing fruit trees acts through a reduction in the nutrients which travel from the roots through the trunk to the leaves and buds. Many commercial orchards of various species use this technique to improve the overall health and productivity of the individual trees. An individual tree may be made up of three or more separate cultivars - one for the root system, which is generally selected for good stability and resistance to soil-borne diseases, one for the trunk, which modifies the overall height of the tree, and one for the productive limbs and buds, which actually produces the fruit. Frequently, the root system stock is the most resistant to cold damage - both by natural selection and by protection from the cold air by the earth. When frost severely damages a tree, the more productive branch and bud cultivar may be killed off, leaving the root to sprout new stalks. In the case of oranges and other citrus, this results in sweet orange trees being frozen back so that the more hardy, cold-tolerant sour orange rootstock puts out new growth.

===Dwarfing grains===

Dwarfing genes are widely used in creating more productive food plants, such as grains. One condition that results in loss of grain crops is called &#x27;lodging&#x27;, where heavy ears of almost ripe grain bend the stalk until the grain touches the ground, becomes wet, and spoils. During the Green Revolution, research that identified wheat reduced-height genes (&quot;Rht&quot;) and a rice semidwarf gene (&quot;sd1&quot;) resulted in crops that yielded significantly more harvestable grain.

<doc id="533216" wikidata="Q7501254" url="?curid=533216" title="The Avenue (Milwaukee)">
<text>The Avenue (previously known as The Grand Avenue, The Shops of Grand Avenue and Shops of Grand Avenue) is an urban shopping plaza currently under renovation that spans three city blocks in the downtown neighborhood of Westown in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. There is one store anchored by T.J. Maxx and GRAEF-USA Incorporated, and three vacant spaces last occupied by Old Navy, OfficeMax, and Linens &#x27;n Things.

The Avenue has been the only major indoor shopping facility in the city of Milwaukee proper with the closing of Capitol Court in 2000 and the Northridge Mall in 2003 due to competition from newly renovated malls in nearby suburbs.

==History==

Grand Avenue opened in 1982 and hosted over 80 specialty stores, along with what was at one time the largest food court in Wisconsin.

The shopping center was named after a bustling merchant street during the 19th century, Grand Avenue (the portion of the present day Wisconsin Avenue west of the Milwaukee River). A main portion of The Shops of Grand Avenue encompasses the former Plankinton Arcade with many of its original features still intact including the statue of John Plankinton in the center of the circular atrium. The Arcade replaced the Plankinton House Hotel on the same site.

Grand Avenue was opened during a time when many downtown retail centers in major cities were shutting down. It sought to avoid these problems by relying on locally owned shops that cater to the &quot;urban&quot; tastes of the nearby populace, in addition to the national chain-stores it houses such as the anchor T.J. Maxx. Because of limited street/surface parking, an adjacent south ramp provides hourly fee parking, costs heavily offset by mall purchase validation.

At one time, the mall also featured Marshall Field&#x27;s (Gimbels until 1986) on the east edge of the mall, but the location closed in 1997. The building that housed it, now ASQ Center, is still connected to The Avenue by a skywalk and features a Residence Inn, although it is not technically part of The Avenue. With the east addition of the downtown YMCA, their circling walking track has views down to Grand Plankinton Concourse through skylights.

TJ Maxx and Linens &#x27;n Things were added in 2002.

In 2005, New York-based Ashkenazy Acquisition Corp purchased The Shops of Grand Avenue for $31.7 million. Due to the economic downfall and its impact on the Milwaukee metropolitan area, by 2009 the mall had lost many key tenants. In 2012 the mall was foreclosed upon and was put up for auction in October 2013. New York based real estate firm Alliance Capital Invest won with a final bid of $16.5 million. After struggling to improve performance, the mall was sold to a local ownership group for $24.6 million in December 2015.

On December 6, 2018, new plans for the existing space were announced as well as the space&#x27;s new name, The Avenue. The former third floor food court will become office space for GRAEF-USA Incorporated. A new food hall will open on the ground floor named 3rd Street Market Hall, late in 2019. In addition, the 52 unit Plankinton Clover Apartments will replace some of the former retail space.

<doc id="533221" wikidata="Q5585854" url="?curid=533221" title="Gordon Square">
<text>Gordon Square is a public park square in Bloomsbury, London, England. It is part of the Bedford Estate and was designed as one of a pair with the nearby Tavistock Square. It is owned by the University of London.

==History and buildings==
The square was developed by master builder Thomas Cubitt in the 1820s, as one of a pair with Tavistock Square, which is a block away and has the same dimensions. As with most London squares the central garden was originally for the private use of the residents of the surrounding houses, but it now belongs to the University of London and is open to the public. The square is named after the second wife of the 6th Duke of Bedford, Lady Georgiana Gordon, daughter of Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon. The university owns many of the buildings in the square and in early 2005 it submitted an application for a refurbishment of the square, including the reinstatement of railings similar to the originals. The work was completed in 2007. The west side of the square is dominated by the listed church of &quot;Christ the King&quot; and next to it the home of Dr Williams&#x27;s Library.

The Institute of Archaeology, a department of University College London, is on the north side of the square. The Campaign for Science and Engineering and UCL Urban Laboratory resides in Gordon House, at the square&#x27;s north-west corner. Gordon Street leads from the north-west corner with the Bloomsbury Theatre close by. The Warburg Institute (part of the School of Advanced Study) is located on the south-west corner of the square, across Tavistock Place.

Nos. 16–26, on the western side of the square, were not completed until 1855, and they represent some of the last buildings created by Thomas Cubitt. They now mostly house UCL academic departments. For example, No. 22 houses the Department of Science and Technology Studies.

Passfield Hall, a halls of residence for undergraduates at the London School of Economics, is on the north side of the square.

==Notable residents==
The economist John Maynard Keynes (1883–1946) lived at 46 Gordon Square, marked by a blue plaque. Before Keynes moved in, the same house was occupied by a young Virginia Woolf (1882–1941) and her siblings (including the noted painter and interior designer Vanessa Bell) and frequented by other members of the Bloomsbury Group. The writer and biographer Lytton Strachey lived at No. 51. Houses 43 to 46 are now occupied by the School of Arts, Birkbeck, University of London.

<doc id="533228" wikidata="Q7252459" url="?curid=533228" title="Providence Place">
<text>Providence Place is an American shopping mall in Providence, Rhode Island. With of gross leasable area, it has been the largest shopping mall in Rhode Island since it opened in 1999.
As of 2022, the mall is anchored by Macy&#x27;s and Boscov&#x27;s, and features premier brands such as Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, Adore Me, J.Crew, Brooks Brothers, Tiffany &amp; Co., and Free People.

==History==
Providence Place opened in 1999 with original anchors Lord &amp; Taylor, Filene&#x27;s, and Nordstrom. Lord &amp; Taylor was repositioned and shuttered entirely in June 2004. The space was later filled by JCPenney in February 2005. Filene&#x27;s became Macy&#x27;s in 2006.

In September 2015, JCPenney closed down as part of a company decision to close 40 stores nationwide.

Throughout 2016, the mall underwent major renovations. The area that JCPenney once occupied was converted into parking, and a guidance system was later added in the garage to direct customers to open spots. Stateside Parking was renamed to &quot;North Garage&quot;, and Cityside Parking was renamed to &quot;South Garage&quot;.

On October 9, 2018, it was announced that Boscov&#x27;s would replace Nordstrom, which closed on January 4 of the following year, when its lease expired.

On June 1, 2020, Providence Place suffered damage after people protesting the murder of George Floyd broke in and looted 12-18 stores.

A rise in working from home instead of downtown after the COVID-19 pandemic, increased online shopping, and preference for smaller in-person stores caused the mall to lose traffic. In October 2024, it was put in state receivership after lenders claimed it defaulted on $259 million in outstanding principal and interest.

On November 15, 2024, Dallas-based Centennial took over management from Brookfield Properties.

===Secret apartment===

Michael Townsend, Adriana Yoto and six other artists covertly built an apartment in a empty space in one of the mall&#x27;s parking garages in 2003 after hearing an advertisement which imagined living in the mall. The group lived there for up to three weeks at a time while documenting mall life. A cinderblock wall was built to keep the living space hidden. The apartment was burglarized at one point, with the occupants&#x27; PlayStation 2 game console being stolen. Some sources report that the mall&#x27;s security guards took the console in an attempt to identify the occupants. The apartment had no running water, so the residents all used the mall bathrooms. Townsend was caught in 2007 after Jaffa Lam, an artist from Hong Kong, visited and was detected by security guards. After the fully furnished apartment was discovered by mall security, Townsend, the head of the artists&#x27; cooperative, was initially charged with breaking and entering, but his charges were reduced to trespassing. The story received national attention. Prior to the discovery, he was planning on building a kitchen, installing wooden flooring, and adding a second bedroom. He pleaded no contest to trespassing and was sentenced to probation on October 2, 2007. The mall banned him from entering for life.

In 2024, it was announced that a feature documentary film on the secret apartment had been completed, titled &quot;Secret Mall Apartment&quot; and directed by filmmaker Jeremy Workman.

==Architecture==
The mall was built on land previously occupied by a dirt parking lot called &quot;Ray&#x27;s Park &amp; Lock.&quot; The proposed design was met by opposition from residents on the city&#x27;s East Side; developers changed the initial design to fit better into the neighborhood. The new design included more red and yellow brick and turrets on the roof, to reflect Providence&#x27;s industrial past.

The design of the mall was partly done by the architect Friedrich St. Florian. He also built the skybridge that connected the mall with the Omni Providence Hotel (formerly the Westin Hotel).

In total, Providence Place consists of fifteen levels. The lowest three are labeled P1-P3 (formerly C-A). Level P1 consists of Parking-Only North Garage (Stateside), and Street Level Restaurants Cityside. There was also a level D in the North Garage. Level P2 consists of DSW shoes and Restaurants, Old Navy at the North Garage, and CVS Pharmacy at the South Garage, and The Skybrige to the Omni Hotel. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond at the South Garage was open from 1999 until its closure in 2019. Level P3 consists of parking only, both at the North and South garages. Levels 1.5 and 2.5 also consist of parking only, both at the North and South garages. The South Garage is at the mall&#x27;s southern end, facing Downtown. The North Garage is at the mall&#x27;s northern end, facing state office buildings including the State Capitol.

The fifth through ninth levels are labeled 1, 1.5 (formerly 1M), 2, 2.5 (formerly 2M) and 3, which feature the indoor galleria (excluding the .5 levels). There is a Dave &amp; Buster&#x27;s, an IMAX theatre, and a 16-screen Showcase Cinemas on the seventh level. The mall also hosts two large parking garages labeled North Garage and South Garage, one stateside and the other cityside, anchored to its back end. Bridges connect the two sides over the Woonasquatucket River.

The mall&#x27;s Winter Garden is a noticeable architectural feature. The four-level structure in the center of the mall spans the Woonasquatucket River and Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor line. The area features large expanses of glass providing views of the city. The third level of the Winter Garden contains the food court and access to its fourth level, serving as the entrance to Dave and Buster&#x27;s, the IMAX theater, and the cinema. Although not directly connected to the mall, Amtrak&#x27;s Providence Station is located approximately 200 yards east of the mall, providing Acela Express and Northeast Regional service to Boston, New York City, and Washington, D.C.

<text>John Cotton (4 December 158523 December 1652) was a clergyman in England and the American colonies, and was considered the preeminent minister and theologian of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. He studied for five years at Trinity College, Cambridge, and nine years at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He had already built a reputation as a scholar and outstanding preacher when he accepted the position of minister at St. Botolph&#x27;s Church, Boston, in Lincolnshire, in 1612.

As a Puritan, he wanted to do away with the ceremony and vestments associated with the established Church of England and to preach in a simpler manner. He felt that the English church needed significant reforms, but he was adamant about not separating from it; his preference was to change it from within. Many ministers were removed from their pulpits in England for their Puritan practices, but Cotton thrived at St. Botolph&#x27;s for nearly 20 years because of supportive aldermen and lenient bishops, as well as his conciliatory and gentle demeanor. By 1632, however, the church authorities had greatly increased pressure on non-conforming clergy, and Cotton was forced into hiding. The following year, he and his wife boarded a ship for New England.

Cotton was highly sought as a minister in Massachusetts and was quickly installed as the second pastor of the Boston church, sharing the ministry with John Wilson. He generated more religious conversions in his first six months than had been made the whole previous year. Early in his Boston tenure, he became involved in the banishment of Roger Williams, who blamed much of his trouble on Cotton. Soon after, Cotton became embroiled in the colony&#x27;s Antinomian Controversy when several adherents of his &quot;free grace&quot; theology (most notably Anne Hutchinson) began criticizing other ministers in the colony. He tended to support his adherents through much of that controversy; near its conclusion, however, he realized that many of them held theological positions that were well outside the mainstream of Puritan orthodoxy, which he did not condone.

Following the controversy, Cotton was able to mend fences with his fellow ministers, and he continued to preach in the Boston church until his death. A great part of his effort during his later career was devoted to the governance of the New England churches, and he was the one who gave the name Congregationalism to this form of church polity. A new form of polity was being decided for the Church of England in the early 1640s, as the Puritans in England gained power on the eve of the English Civil War, and Cotton wrote numerous letters and books in support of the &quot;New England Way&quot;. Ultimately, Presbyterianism was chosen as the form of governance for the Church of England during the Westminster Assembly in 1643, though Cotton continued to engage in a polemic contest with several prominent Presbyterians on this issue.

Cotton became more conservative with age. He battled the separatist attitude of Roger Williams and advocated severe punishment for those whom he deemed heretics, such as Samuel Gorton. Cotton was a scholar, an avid letter writer, and the author of many books, and was considered the &quot;prime mover&quot; among New England&#x27;s ministers.

==Early life==
John Cotton was born in Derby, England, on 4 December 1585 and was baptized 11 days later at St. Alkmund&#x27;s Church there. He was the second of four children of Rowland Cotton, a Derby lawyer, and Mary Hurlbert, who was &quot;a gracious and pious mother&quot; according to Cotton&#x27;s grandson Cotton Mather. He was educated at Derby School in the buildings which are now called the Old Grammar School, Derby, under the tutelage of Richard Johnson, a priest of the Church of England.

Cotton matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1598 as a sizar, the lowest class of paying student and requiring some financial assistance. He followed a curriculum of rhetoric, logic, and philosophy, and then gave four Latin disputations for an evaluation. He received his B.A. in 1603 and then attended Emmanuel College, Cambridge, &quot;the most Puritan college in the kingdom&quot;, earning an M.A. in 1606 following a course of study which included Greek, astronomy, and perspective. He then accepted a fellowship at Emmanuel and continued with his studies for another five years, this time focusing on Hebrew, theology, and disputation; he was also allowed to preach during this time. An understanding of Latin was necessary for all scholars, and his study of Greek and Hebrew gave him greater insight into scripture.

Cotton became recognized for his scholarship and preaching during his time as a graduate student. He also tutored and worked as dean, supervising his juniors. Biographer Larzer Ziff calls his learning &quot;profound&quot; and his knowledge of languages &quot;phenomenal&quot;. Cotton became famous at Cambridge when he preached the funeral sermon of Robert Some, the late Master of Peterhouse, Cambridge, and he developed a large following for both his &quot;manner and matter&quot;. He left the university after five years but did not receive his Bachelor of Divinity degree until 1613, following the compulsory seven-year wait after his M.A. He was ordained as both deacon and priest of the Church of England on 13 July 1610. In 1612, he left Emmanuel College to become the vicar of St. Botolph&#x27;s Church in Boston, Lincolnshire, described as &quot;the most magnificent parochial edifice in the kingdom.&quot; He was only 27 years old, but his scholarly, vigorous, and persuasive preaching made him one of the leading Puritans in England.

===Cotton&#x27;s theology===

One of the influences on Cotton&#x27;s thinking while at Emmanuel was the teaching of William Perkins from whom he learned to be flexible, sensible, and practical, and how to deal with the political realities of being a non-conformist Puritan within a disapproving Church of England. He also learned the art of disagreeing while maintaining the appearance of conformity.

As Cotton steadily became more famous for his preaching, he struggled internally over his own spiritual condition. His state of uncertainty became one of desperation as he spent three years searching for any sign that the &quot;Lord had chosen him as one predestined to live in glory.&quot; His prayers were answered around 1611 when he became certain that &quot;he had been called to salvation.&quot;

Cotton considered the doctrine and preaching of his spiritual counselor Richard Sibbes to have been the greatest influence on his conversion. Sibbes&#x27; &quot;heart religion&quot; was attractive to Cotton; he wrote, &quot;The ambassadors of so gentle a Savior should not be overly masterly.&quot; Once converted, his style of pulpit oratory became more simple in expression, though disappointing to those who liked his former polished manner of speaking. Even in his new subdued manner, he had a profound impact on those hearing his message; Cotton&#x27;s preaching was responsible for the conversion of John Preston, the future Master of Emmanuel College and the most influential Puritan minister of his day.

As Cotton&#x27;s theology changed, he began placing less emphasis on preparation (&quot;works&quot;) to obtain God&#x27;s salvation, and more emphasis on the &quot;transforming character of the moment of religious conversion in which mortal man [is] infused with a divine grace.&quot; His theology was molded by a number of individuals, besides influences such as Perkins and Sibbes; his basic tenets stemmed from reformer John Calvin. He wrote: &quot;I have read the fathers, and the schoolmen and Calvin too, but I find that he that has Calvin has them all.&quot; Other inspirations to his theology include the Apostle Paul and Bishop Cyprian, and reformation leaders Zacharias Ursinus, Theodore Beza, Franciscus Junius (the elder), Jerome Zanchius, Peter Martyr Vermigli, Johannes Piscator, and Martin Bucer. Additional English role models include Paul Baynes, Thomas Cartwright, Laurence Chaderton, Arthur Hildersham, William Ames, William Whitaker, John Jewel, and John Whitgift.

In the religious theory developed by Cotton, the believer is totally passive in his personal religious experience, while the Holy Spirit provides spiritual regeneration. This model was in contrast to the theology of most other Puritan ministers, particularly those who became Cotton&#x27;s colleagues in New England; the &quot;preparationist&quot; preachers such as Thomas Hooker, Peter Bulkley, and Thomas Shepard taught that good deeds and morality were necessary to generate the spiritual activity leading to God&#x27;s salvation.

===Puritanism===

Cotton&#x27;s sentiments were strongly anti-Catholic, clearly evident in his writings, and this led him to oppose the established English church which had separated from the Catholic church in name only, according to the Puritan view. The English church had an &quot;officially sanctioned form of worship and an established ecclesiastical structure&quot;, and he felt that the Anglican church polity and ceremonies were not authorized by Scripture. Cotton and others wanted to &quot;purify&quot; such practices and were pejoratively labelled &quot;puritans&quot;, a term that stuck. He was opposed to the essence of the established church, yet he was just as opposed to separating from it because he viewed the Puritan movement as a way to change the church from within. This view was distinct from the Separatist Puritan view, which held that the only solution to the situation within the English church was to leave it and start something new, unrelated to the official Church of England. This was the view espoused by the Mayflower Pilgrims.

Non-separatist Puritanism is described by author Everett Emerson as &quot;an effort to continue and complete the reformation of the Church of England&quot; which had begun under Henry VIII of England. Following the reformation, Queen Elizabeth chose a middle way for the English Church between the two extremes of Calvinism and Catholicism.

The non-separatist Puritans, however, wanted to reform the Church of England so that it would resemble &quot;the best reformed churches&quot; on the Continent. To do this, their intention was to eliminate the observation of Saint&#x27;s days, do away with making the sign of the cross and kneeling while receiving communion, and eliminate the requirement for ministers to wear the surplice. They also wanted church governance to change, favoring Presbyterianism over Episcopacy.

The Puritans were greatly influenced by Continental reformer Theodore Beza, and they had four primary agendas: seeking moral transformation; urging the practice of piety; urging the return to the Christianity of the Bible, as opposed to prayer books, ceremonies, and vestments; and the strict recognition of the Sabbath. Cotton embraced all four of these practices. He received a small amount of Puritan influence while at Trinity; but at Emmanuel, Puritan practices were more visible under Master Laurence Chaderton, including non-prayer book services, ministers wearing no surplice, and communion being given around a table.

The Puritan movement hinged largely on the notion that &quot;a holy commonwealth could be established on earth.&quot; This had an important effect on what Cotton taught and the way that he taught it. He believed that the Bible could not save souls simply by being read. To him, the first step in conversion was the &quot;pricking of the hardened heart&quot; of the individual by hearing the word of God. In this regard, Puritanism &quot;emphasized the importance of preaching&quot; with the focus on the pulpit, while Catholicism emphasized sacraments where the focus was on the altar.

===Ministry at St. Botolph&#x27;s===
Puritan John Preston&#x27;s religious conversion was attributed to Cotton. Preston had become a political force at Queens&#x27; College and later the Master of Emmanuel, and he held favor with King James. In his college roles, he sent a steady stream of students to live with and learn from Cotton, giving Cotton the epithet &quot;Dr. Preston&#x27;s seasoning vessel.&quot;

When Cotton arrived at St. Botolph&#x27;s in 1612, non-conformity had already been practised for nearly 30 years. Nevertheless, he attempted to conform to the practices of the Church of England during his early tenure there, until his conscience no longer allowed him to do so. He then wrote a defence of his new position which he circulated among his sympathizers.

In time, Cotton&#x27;s preaching became so celebrated and his lectures so well attended that three lectures were added to his week, in addition to the usual Sunday morning sermon and Thursday afternoon lecture. Puritans throughout the kingdom sought to correspond with him or interview him, including Roger Williams with whom he later had a strained relationship. In 1615, Cotton began holding special services within his church where Puritanism could be practised in its true sense and the offensive practices of the established church could be totally avoided. Some members were excluded from these alternate services; they became offended and registered their complaints with the bishop&#x27;s court in Lincoln. Cotton was suspended, but alderman Thomas Leverett was able to negotiate an appeal, after which Cotton was reinstated. This interference maintained by Leverett and other aldermen was successful in protecting Cotton from Anglican church officials, enabling him to maintain his course of Puritanism under four different bishops of Lincoln: William Barlow, Richard Neile, George Montaigne, and John Williams.

The last 12 years of Cotton&#x27;s tenure at St. Botolph&#x27;s was spent under the tenure of Williams, who was a tolerant bishop with whom Cotton could be fairly frank about his non-conformist views. Cotton nurtured this relationship by agreeing with the bishop to the extent that his conscience allowed and being humble and cooperative when forced to disagree.

====Role as counsellor and teacher====
The surviving correspondence of John Cotton reveals the growth of his importance as a pastoral counselor to his church colleagues during the 1620s and into the 1630s.

Among those seeking his counsel were young ministers beginning their careers or facing some crisis. Others desiring his aide were older colleagues, including those who had left England to preach on the Continent. Cotton had become the experienced veteran who assisted his fellow ministers, particularly in their struggles with the conformity that was forced upon them by the established church. He assisted ministers from England and abroad, and also trained many students from Cambridge.

Ministers came to Cotton with a wide range of questions and concerns. In the years before his immigration to the Massachusetts Bay Colony, he gave advice to his former Cambridge student Reverend Ralph Levett, serving in 1625 as the private chaplain to Sir William and Lady Frances Wray at Ashby cum Fenby, Lincolnshire. As the family minister, Levett struggled to align his Puritan beliefs with this fun-loving household, which enjoyed dancing and exchanging valentine sentiments. Cotton&#x27;s advice was that valentines were like a lottery and &quot;a takeinge of Gods name in vaine,&quot; though dancing was acceptable, if not done in a lewd way. Levett was satisfied with the guidance.

After Charles I became king in 1625, the situation grew worse for Puritans and more of them moved to the Netherlands. Charles would not compromise with his rivals, and Parliament became dominated by Puritans, followed by civil war in the 1640s.

Under Charles, the Church of England reverted to more ceremonial worship, approaching that of Catholicism, and there was increased hostility towards the Calvinism that Cotton followed. Cotton&#x27;s colleagues were being summoned to the High Court for their Puritan practices, but he continued to thrive because of his supportive aldermen and sympathetic superiors, as well as his conciliatory demeanor.

Minister Samuel Ward of Ipswich remarked, &quot;Of all men in the world I envy Mr. Cotton, of Boston, most; for he doth nothing in way of conformity, and yet hath his liberty, and I do everything that way, and cannot enjoy mine.&quot;

===North American colonization===
The options for Puritan ministers who lacked Cotton&#x27;s success at avoiding the church authorities were to either go underground or to form a separatist church on the Continent. In the late 1620s, however, another option emerged as America began to open for colonization. With this new prospect, a staging area was established at Tattershall, near Boston, which was the seat of Theophilus Clinton, 4th Earl of Lincoln.

Cotton and the Earl&#x27;s chaplain, Samuel Skelton, conferred extensively, before Skelton left England to be the minister for the company of John Endicott in 1629. Cotton firmly opposed separatism, whereby newly formed churches in New England or continental Europe refused communion with the Church of England or with the continental reformed churches. For this reason, he was upset to learn that Skelton&#x27;s church at Naumkeag (later Salem, Massachusetts) had opted for such separatism and had refused to offer communion to newly arriving colonists.

In particular, he was grieved to learn that William Coddington, his friend and parishioner from Boston (Lincolnshire), was not allowed to have his child baptized &quot;because he was no member of any particular reformed church, though of the catholic&quot; (universal).

In July 1629, Cotton took part in a planning conference for emigration at Sempringham in Lincolnshire. Other future New England colonists who participated in the planning were Thomas Hooker, Roger Williams, John Winthrop, and Emmanuel Downing. Cotton did not emigrate for several more years, though he did travel to Southampton to preach the farewell sermon to Winthrop&#x27;s party.

Of Cotton&#x27;s thousands of sermons, this was the earliest one to be published. He also offered support to those who had already sailed, and he arranged in a 1630 letter for a hogshead of meal to be sent to Coddington who was at Naumkeag.

Shortly after seeing the New England colonists on their way, both Cotton and his wife became seriously ill from malaria. They stayed at the manor house of the Earl of Lincoln for nearly a year; he eventually recovered, but his wife died. He decided to travel to complete his recovery and, while doing so, he became much more aware of the dangers that Puritans were facing throughout England.

Nathaniel Ward wrote of his summons to court in a December 1631 letter to Cotton, mentioning that Thomas Hooker had already fled from Essex and gone to Holland. The letter is representative of the &quot;emotional agony&quot; faced by these ministers, and Ward wrote it as a sort of &quot;good-bye&quot;, knowing that he would be removed from his ministry. Cotton and Ward met again in New England.

===Flight from England===
On 6 April 1632, Cotton married widow Sarah (Hawkred) Story who had a daughter. He received word almost immediately thereafter that he was to be summoned to the High Court for his non-conforming practices. This was less than a year after receiving the letter from Ward. Cotton asked the Earl of Dorset to intercede on his behalf, but the earl wrote back that non-conformity and Puritanism were unpardonable offenses, and told Cotton &quot;you must fly for your safety.&quot;

Cotton was to appear before William Laud, the Bishop of London, who was on a campaign to suppress Puritan practices. He now felt that his best option was to disappear into the Puritan underground, and then decide his course of action from there.

In October 1632, he wrote his wife a letter from hiding, saying that he was being well cared for but that she would be followed if she attempted to join him. Two prominent Puritans came to visit him in hiding: Thomas Goodwin and John Davenport. Both men came to convince him that it would be acceptable for him to conform to the established church rather than deal with possible imprisonment.

Instead, Cotton compelled these two men into further non-conformity; Goodwin went on to be the voice of the independents (Congregationalists) at the Westminster Assembly in 1643, while Davenport became the founder of the Puritan New Haven Colony in America, using Cotton&#x27;s theocratic model of government. It was Cotton&#x27;s influence that made him &quot;the most important of the Congregational leaders&quot;, and later a prime target for attacks by the Presbyterians.

While in hiding, Cotton moved about in an underground Puritan network, staying at times in Northamptonshire, Surrey, and different places around London. He contemplated going to Holland like many nonconformists, which allowed a quick return to England should the political situation become favorable and appeasing the sense that a &quot;great reformation&quot; was to take place soon. He soon ruled out Holland, however, because of the negative feedback from fellow minister Thomas Hooker who had previously gone there.

Members of the Massachusetts Bay Colony heard about Cotton&#x27;s flight and sent him letters urging him to come to New England. None of the great Puritan clergymen had gone there, and he felt that it would put him at too great a distance to return should the situation in England warrant.

Despite this, he made his decision to emigrate by the spring of 1633 and wrote a letter to Bishop Williams on 7 May, resigning from his benefice at St. Botolph&#x27;s and thanking the bishop for his flexibility and mildness. By the summer, he had reunited with his wife, and the couple made their way to the coast of Kent. In June or July 1633, the 48-year-old Cotton boarded the ship &quot;Griffin&quot; with his wife and step-daughter, along with fellow ministers Thomas Hooker and Samuel Stone. Also on board was Edward Hutchinson, eldest son of Anne Hutchinson who was traveling with his uncle Edward. Cotton&#x27;s wife bore their son during the voyage, and they named him Seaborn. Eighteen months after his departure from England, Cotton wrote that his decision to emigrate was not difficult to make; he found preaching in a new land to be far preferable to &quot;sitting in a loathsome prison.&quot;

==New England==

Cotton and Thomas Hooker were the first eminent ministers to come to New England, according to Cotton&#x27;s biographer Larzer Ziff. Cotton was openly welcomed on his arrival in September 1633 as one of the two ministers of the church in Boston in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, having been personally invited to the colony by Governor Winthrop. Ziff writes, &quot;It was only fitting, the majority felt, that the most eminent preacher in the colony should be located in the principal city.&quot; Also, many who had come from Boston, Lincolnshire had settled in Boston, Massachusetts.

The Boston meetinghouse of the 1630s was small and windowless, with clay walls and a thatched roof—far different from Cotton&#x27;s former surroundings in the spacious and comfortable church of St. Botolph&#x27;s. Once established in his new church, however, his evangelical fervor contributed to a religious revival, and there were more conversions during his first six months in the pastorate than there had been the previous year. He was recognized as the leading intellectual in the colony and is the first minister known to have preached a theme of millennialism in New England. He also became the spokesman for the new church polity known as Congregationalism.

Congregationalists felt very strongly that individual congregations were real churches, while the Church of England had strayed far from the teachings of the Bible. Puritan leader John Winthrop arrived in Salem with the Winthrop Fleet in 1630, but minister Samuel Skelton informed him that they would not be welcomed at the celebration of the Lord&#x27;s supper and their children would not be baptized in Skelton&#x27;s church because of Winthrop&#x27;s association with the Church of England.

Cotton was initially offended by this action and was concerned that the Puritans in Salem had become separatists, as were the Pilgrims. However, Cotton eventually came to agree with Skelton and concluded that the only real churches were autonomous, individual congregations, and that there was no legitimate higher ecclesiastical power.

===Relation with Roger Williams===

Early in his New England tenure, Roger Williams began to be noticed for his activity in the Salem Church. This church was founded in 1629 and had already become a separatist church by 1630, when it denied communion to John Winthrop and his wife upon their arrival in Massachusetts; it also refused to baptize a child born at sea. Williams arrived in Boston in May 1631 and was offered the position of teacher in the Boston church, but he refused the offer because the church was not sufficiently separated from the Church of England. He even refused to become a member of the Boston church, but he had been selected as the teacher at Salem by May 1631 upon the death of Francis Higginson.

Williams had a reputation for both non-conformity and piety, although historian Everett Emerson calls him a &quot;gadfly whose admirable personal qualities were mixed with an uncomfortable iconoclasm&quot;. Boston&#x27;s minister John Wilson returned to England to get his wife in 1632, and Williams again refused an invitation to fill in during his absence. Williams had distinctive theological views, and Cotton differed with him on the issues of separatism and religious toleration. Williams had gone to Plymouth for a short while but returned to Salem, and was called to replace Salem&#x27;s minister Samuel Skelton upon his death.

During his tenure at Salem, Williams considered those who maintained ties with the Church of England to be &quot;the unregenerate&quot; and pushed for separation from them. He was supported by local magistrate John Endicott, who went so far as to remove the cross from the English flag as being a symbol of idolatry. As a result, Endicott was barred from the magistracy for a year in May 1635, and Salem&#x27;s petition for additional land was refused by the Massachusetts Court two months later because Williams was the minister there.

Williams was soon banished from the Massachusetts colony; Cotton was not consulted on the issue but he nevertheless wrote to Williams, stating that the cause of banishment was &quot;the tendency of Williams&#x27; doctrines to disturb the peace of the church and state.&quot; Williams was going to be shipped back to England by the Massachusetts magistrates, but instead he slipped away into the wilderness, spending the winter near Seekonk and establishing Providence Plantations near the Narragansett Bay the following spring. He eventually considered Cotton the &quot;chief spokesman&quot; for Massachusetts Bay Colony and &quot;the source of his problems&quot;, according to one historian.

Cotton went to Salem in 1636 where he delivered a sermon to the congregation. His goal was to make peace with the parishioners, but also to persuade them of what he perceived as the dangers of the separatist doctrine espoused by Williams and many others.

===Antinomian controversy===

Cotton&#x27;s theology espoused that a person is helpless to affect his own salvation, and instead is totally dependent on God&#x27;s free grace. In contrast, most of the other New England ministers were &quot;preparationists&quot;, espousing the view that morality and good works were needed to prepare one for God&#x27;s salvation. Most members of Cotton&#x27;s Boston church became very attracted to his theology, including Anne Hutchinson. She was a charismatic woman who hosted 60 or more people at her home each week to discuss Cotton&#x27;s sermons, but also to criticize the colony&#x27;s other ministers. Another highly important advocate of Cotton&#x27;s theology was the colony&#x27;s young governor Henry Vane, who had built an addition onto Cotton&#x27;s house where he lived during his time in Boston. Hutchinson and Vane followed the teachings of Cotton, but both of them also held some views that were considered unorthodox, and even radical.
John Wheelwright, a brother-in-law of Hutchinson, arrived in New England in 1636; he was the only other divine in the colony who shared Cotton&#x27;s free grace theology. Thomas Shepard was the minister of Newtown (which became Cambridge, Massachusetts). He began writing letters to Cotton as early as the spring of 1636, in which he expressed concern about Cotton&#x27;s preaching and about some of the unorthodox opinions found among his Boston parishioners. Shepard also began criticizing this unorthodoxy to his Newtown congregation during his sermons.

Hutchinson and the other free grace advocates continually questioned, criticized, and challenged the orthodox ministers in the colony. Ministers and magistrates began sensing the religious unrest, and John Winthrop gave the first public warning of the ensuing crisis with an entry in his journal around 21 October 1636, blaming the developing situation on Hutchinson.

On 25 October 1636, seven ministers gathered at the home of Cotton to confront the developing discord, holding a private conference which included Hutchinson and other lay leaders from the Boston church. Some agreement was reached concerning the theological differences, and Cotton &quot;gave satisfaction&quot; to the other ministers, &quot;so as he agreed with them all in the point of sanctification, and so did Mr. Wheelwright; so as they all did hold, that sanctification did help to evidence justification.&quot; The agreement was short-lived, and Cotton, Hutchinson, and their supporters were accused of a number of heresies, including antinomianism and familism. Antinomianism means &quot;against or opposed to the law&quot; and theologically means that a person considers himself not bound to obey any moral or spiritual law. Familism is named for a 16th-century sect called the Family of Love; it teaches that a person can attain a perfect union with God under the Holy Spirit, coupled with freedom from both sin and the responsibility for it. Hutchinson, Wheelwright, and Vane were antagonists of the orthodox party, but Cotton&#x27;s theological differences from the colony&#x27;s other ministers were at the center of the controversy.

By winter, the theological schism had become great enough that the General Court called for a day of fasting on 19 January 1637 to pray for a resolution of the colony&#x27;s difficulties. Cotton preached a conciliatory sermon at the Boston church on that morning, but Wheelwright preached a sermon in the afternoon which was &quot;censurable and incited mischief&quot; in the view of the Puritan clergy. Cotton considered this sermon to be &quot;ill-advised in manner, although ... valid enough in content.&quot;

====Events of 1637====
By March, the political tide began to turn against the free grace advocates. Wheelwright was tried and convicted of contempt and sedition for his fast-day sermon, but he was not yet sentenced. John Winthrop replaced Henry Vane as governor in May 1637, and all of the other Boston magistrates who supported Hutchinson and Wheelwright were voted out of office. Wheelwright was sentenced to banishment at the court which convened on 2 November 1637 and ordered to leave the colony within 14 days.
Anne Hutchinson was brought before the clergy and congregation at the Boston meeting house on 15 March 1638. A list of numerous theological errors was presented, four of which were addressed during a nine-hour session. Then Cotton was put in the uncomfortable position of delivering an admonition to his admirer. He said, &quot;I would speake it to Gods Glory [that] you have bine an Instrument of doing some good amongst us ... he hath given you a sharp apprehension, a ready utterance and abilitie to exprese yourselfe in the Cause of God.&quot;

With this said, it was the overwhelming conclusion of the ministers that Hutchinson&#x27;s unsound beliefs outweighed any good that she might have done and that she endangered the spiritual welfare of the community. Cotton continued:
You cannot Evade the Argument ... that filthie Sinne of the Communitie of Woemen; and all promiscuous and filthie cominge togeather of men and Woemen without Distinction or Relation of Mariage, will necessarily follow ... Though I have not herd, nayther do I thinke you have bine unfaythfull to your Husband in his Marriage Covenant, yet that will follow upon it.

Here Cotton was making a reference to Hutchinson&#x27;s theological ideas and those of the antinomians and familists, which taught that a Christian is under no obligation to obey moral strictures. He then concluded:
Therefor, I doe Admonish you, and alsoe charge you in the name of Ch[rist] Je[sus], in whose place I stand ... that you would sadly consider the just hand of God agaynst you, the great hurt you have done to the Churches, the great Dishonour you have brought to Je[sus] Ch[rist], and the Evell that you have done to many a poore soule.

Cotton had not yet given up on his parishioner, and Hutchinson was allowed to spend the week at his home, where the recently arrived Reverend John Davenport was also staying. All week the two ministers worked with her, and under their supervision she had written out a formal recantation of her unorthodox opinions. At the next meeting on Thursday, 22 March, she stood and read her recantation to the congregation, admitting that she had been wrong about many of her beliefs. The ministers, however, continued with her examination, during which she began to lie about her theological positions—and her entire defense unraveled. At this point, Cotton signaled that he had given up on her, and his fellow minister John Wilson read the order of excommunication.

====Aftermath====
Cotton had been deeply complicit in the controversy because his theological views differed from those of the other ministers in New England, and he suffered in attempting to remain supportive of Hutchinson while being conciliatory towards his fellow ministers. Nevertheless, some of his followers were taking his singular doctrine and carrying it well beyond Puritan orthodoxy. Cotton attempted to downplay the appearance of colonial discord when communicating with his brethren in England. A group of colonists made a return trip to England in February 1637, and Cotton asked them to report that the controversy was about magnifying the grace of God, one party focused on grace within man, the other on grace toward man, and that New England was still a good place for new colonists.

Cotton later summarized some of the events in his correspondence. In one letter he asserted that &quot;the radical voices consciously sheltered themselves&quot; behind his reputation. In a March 1638 letter to Samuel Stone at Hartford, he referred to Hutchinson and others as being those who &quot;would have corrupted and destroyed Faith and Religion had not they bene timely discovered.&quot;

His most complete statement on the subject appeared in a long letter to Wheelwright in April 1640, in which he reviewed the failings which both of them had committed as the controversy developed. He discussed his own failure in not understanding the extent to which members of his congregation knowingly went beyond his religious views, specifically mentioning the heterodox opinions of William Aspinwall and John Coggeshall. He suggested Wheelwright should have picked up on the gist of what Hutchinson and Coggeshall were saying.

During the heat of the controversy, Cotton considered moving to New Haven, but he first recognized at the August 1637 synod that some of his parishioners were harboring unorthodox opinions, and that the other ministers may have been correct in their views about his followers. Some of the magistrates and church elders let him know in private that his departure from Boston would be most unwelcome, and he decided to stay in Boston once he saw a way to reconcile with his fellow ministers.

In the aftermath of the controversy, Cotton continued a dialogue with some of those who had gone to Aquidneck Island (called Rhode Island at the time). One of these correspondents was his friend from Lincolnshire William Coddington. Coddington wrote that he and his wife had heard that Cotton&#x27;s preaching had changed dramatically since the controversy ended: &quot;if we had not knowne what he had holden forth before we knew not how to understand him.&quot; Coddington then deflected Cotton&#x27;s suggestions that he reform some of his own ideas and &quot;errors in judgment&quot;. In 1640, the Boston church sent some messengers to Aquidneck, but they were poorly received. Young Francis Hutchinson, a son of Anne, attempted to withdraw his membership from the Boston church, but his request was denied by Cotton.

Cotton continued to be interested in helping Wheelwright get his order of banishment lifted. In the spring of 1640, he wrote to Wheelwright with details about how he should frame a letter to the General Court. Wheelwright was not yet ready to concede the level of fault that Cotton suggested, though, and another four years transpired before he could admit enough wrongdoing for the court to lift his banishment.

Some of Cotton&#x27;s harshest critics during the controversy were able to reconcile with him following the event. A year after Hutchinson&#x27;s excommunication, Thomas Dudley requested Cotton&#x27;s assistance with counseling William Denison, a layman in the Roxbury church. In 1646, Thomas Shepard was working on his book about the Sabbath &quot;Theses Sabbaticae&quot; and he asked for Cotton&#x27;s opinion.

==Late career==

Cotton served as teacher and authority on scripture for both his parishioners and his fellow ministers. For example, he maintained a lengthy correspondence with Concord minister Peter Bulkley from 1635 to 1650. In his letters to Cotton, Bulkley requested help for doctrinal difficulties as well as for challenging situations emanating from his congregation. Plymouth minister John Reynes and his ruling elder William Brewster also sought Cotton&#x27;s professional advice.

In addition, Cotton continued an extensive correspondence with ministers and laymen across the Atlantic, viewing this work as supporting Christian unity similar to what the Apostle Paul had done in biblical times.

Cotton&#x27;s eminence in New England mirrored that which he enjoyed in Lincolnshire, though there were some notable differences between the two worlds. In Lincolnshire, he preached to capacity audiences in a large stone church, while in New England he preached to small groups in a small wood-framed church. He was able to travel extensively in England, and even visited his native town of Derby at least once a year. By contrast, he did little traveling in New England. He occasionally visited the congregations at Concord or Lynn, but more often he was visited by other ministers and laymen who came to his Thursday lectures. He continued to board and mentor young scholars, as he did in England, but there were far fewer in early New England.

===Church polity===
One of the major issues that consumed Cotton both before and after the Antinomian Controversy was the government, or polity, of the New England churches. By 1636, he had settled on the form of ecclesiastical organization that became &quot;the way of the New England churches&quot;; six years later, he gave it the name Congregationalism. Cotton&#x27;s plan involved independent churches governed from within, as opposed to Presbyterianism with a more hierarchical polity, which had many supporters in England. Both systems were an effort to reform the Episcopal polity of the established Church of England.
Congregationalism became known as the &quot;New England Way&quot;, based on a membership limited to saved believers and a separation from all other churches in matters of government. Congregationalists wanted each church to have its own governance, but they generally opposed separation from the Church of England. The Puritans continued to view the Church of England as being the true church but needing reform from within.

Cotton became the &quot;chief helmsman&quot; for the Massachusetts Puritans in establishing congregationalism in New England, with his qualities of piety, learning, and mildness of temper. Several of his books and much of his correspondence dealt with church polity, and one of his key sermons on the subject was his &quot;Sermon Deliver&#x27;d at Salem&quot; in 1636, given in the church that was forced to expel Roger Williams. Cotton disagreed with Williams&#x27; separatist views, and he had hoped to convince him of his errors before his banishment. His sermon in Salem was designed to keep the Salem church from moving further towards separation from the English church. He felt the church and the state should be separate to a degree but that they should be intimately related. He considered the best organization for the state to be a Biblical model from the Old Testament. He did not see democracy as being an option for the Massachusetts government, but instead felt that a theocracy would be the best model. It was in these matters that Roger Williams strongly disagreed with Cotton.

Puritans gained control of the English Parliament in the early 1640s, and the issue of polity for the English church was of major importance to congregations throughout England and its colonies. To address this issue, the Westminster Assembly was convened in 1643. Viscount Saye and Sele had scrapped his plans to immigrate to New England, along with other members of Parliament. He wrote to Cotton, Hooker, and Davenport in New England, &quot;urging them to return to England where they were needed as members of the Westminster Assembly&quot;. None of the three attended the meeting, where an overwhelming majority of members were Presbyterian and only a handful represented independent (congregational) interests. Despite the lopsided numbers, Cotton was interested in attending, though John Winthrop quoted Hooker as saying that he could not see the point of &quot;travelling 3,000 miles to agree with three men.&quot; Cotton changed his mind about attending as events began to unfold leading to the First English Civil War, and he decided that he could have a greater effect on the Assembly through his writings.

The New England response to the assembly was Cotton&#x27;s book &quot;The Keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven&quot; published in 1644. It was Cotton&#x27;s attempt to persuade the assembly to adopt the Congregational way of church polity in England, endorsed by English ministers Thomas Goodwin and Philip Nye. In it, Cotton reveals some of his thoughts on state governance. &quot;Democracy I do not conceive that ever God did ordain as a fit government either for church or commonwealth.&quot; Despite these views against democracy, congregationalism later became important in the democratization of the English colonies in North America. This work on church polity had no effect on the view of most Presbyterians, but it did change the stance of Presbyterian John Owen who later became a leader of the independent party at the Restoration of the English monarchy in 1660. Owen had earlier been selected by Oliver Cromwell to be the vice-chancellor of Oxford.

Congregationalism was New England&#x27;s established church polity, but it did have its detractors among the Puritans, including Baptists, Seekers, Familists, and other sectaries. John Winthrop&#x27;s &quot;Short Story&quot; about the Antinomian Controversy was published in 1644, and it prompted Presbyterian spokesman Robert Baillie to publish &quot;A Dissuasive against the Errours of the Time&quot; in 1645. As a Presbyterian minister, Baillie was critical of Congregationalism and targeted Cotton in his writings. He considered congregationalism to be &quot;unscriptural and unworkable,&quot; and thought Cotton&#x27;s opinions and conduct to be &quot;shaky.&quot;

Cotton&#x27;s response to Baillie was &quot;The Way of Congregational Churches Cleared&quot; published in 1648. This work brings out more personal views of Cotton, particularly in regards to the Antinomian Controversy. He concedes that neither Congregationalism nor Presbyterianism would become dominant in the domain of the other, but he looks at both forms of church polity as being important in countering the heretics. The brief second part of this work was an answer to criticism by Presbyterian ministers Samuel Rutherford and Daniel Cowdrey. Baillie made a further response to this work in conjunction with Rutherford, and to this Cotton made his final refutation in 1650 in his work &quot;Of the Holinesse of Church-members&quot;.

===Synod and Cambridge Assembly===
Following the Westminster Assembly in England, the New England ministers held a meeting of their own at Harvard College in Cambridge, addressing the issue of Presbyterianism in the New England colonies. Cotton and Hooker acted as moderators. A synod was held in Cambridge three years later in September 1646 to prepare &quot;a model of church government&quot;. The three ministers appointed to conduct the business were Cotton, Richard Mather, and Ralph Partridge. This resulted in a statement called the Cambridge Platform which drew heavily from the writings of Cotton and Mather. This platform was adopted by most of the churches in New England and endorsed by the Massachusetts General Court in 1648; it also provided an official statement of the Congregationalist method of church polity known as the &quot;New England Way&quot;.

===Debate with Roger Williams===
Cotton had written a letter to Roger Williams immediately following his banishment in 1635 which appeared in print in London in 1643. Williams denied any connection with its publication, although he happened to be in England at the time getting a patent for the Colony of Rhode Island. The letter was published in 1644 as &quot;Mr. Cottons Letters Lately Printed, Examined and Answered&quot;. The same year, Williams also published &quot;The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution&quot;. In these works, he discussed the purity of New England churches, the justice of his banishment, and &quot;the propriety of the Massachusetts policy of religious intolerance.&quot; Williams felt that the root cause of conflict was the colony&#x27;s relationship of church and state.

With this, Cotton became embattled with two different extremes. At one end were the Presbyterians who wanted more openness to church membership, while Williams thought that the church should completely separate from any church hierarchy and only allow membership to those who separated from the Anglican church. Cotton chose a middle ground between the two extremes. He felt that church members should &quot;hate what separates them from Christ, [and] not denounce those Christians who have not yet rejected all impure practices.&quot; Cotton further felt that the policies of Williams were &quot;too demanding upon the Christian&quot;. In this regard, historian Everett Emerson suggests that &quot;Cotton&#x27;s God is far more generous and forgiving than Williams&#x27;s&quot;.

Cotton and Williams both accepted the Bible as the basis for their theological understandings, although Williams saw a marked distinction between the Old Testament and New Testament, in contrast to Cotton&#x27;s perception that the two books formed a continuum. Cotton viewed the Old Testament as providing a model for Christian governance, and envisioned a society where church and state worked together cooperatively. Williams, in contrast, believed that God had dissolved the union between the Old and New Testaments with the arrival of Christ; in fact, this dissolution was &quot;one of His purposes in sending Christ into the world.&quot; The debate between the two men continued in 1647 when Cotton replied to Williams&#x27;s book with &quot;The Bloudy Tenant, Washed and Made White in the Bloud of the Lambe&quot;, after which Williams responded with yet another pamphlet.

===Dealing with sectaries===
A variety of religious sects emerged during the first few decades of American colonization, some of which were considered radical by many orthodox Puritans. Some of these groups included the Radical Spiritists (Antinomians and Familists), Anabaptists (General and Particular Baptists), and Quakers. Many of these had been expelled from Massachusetts and found a haven in Portsmouth, Newport, or Providence Plantation.

One of the most notorious of these sectaries was the zealous Samuel Gorton who had been expelled from both Plymouth Colony and the settlement at Portsmouth, and then was refused freemanship in Providence Plantation. In 1642, he settled in what became Warwick, but the following year he was arrested with some followers and brought to Boston for dubious legal reasons. Here he was forced to attend a Cotton sermon in October 1643 which he confuted. Further attempts at correcting his religious opinions were in vain. Cotton was willing to have Gorton put to death in order to &quot;preserve New England&#x27;s good name in England,&quot; where he felt that such theological views were greatly detrimental to Congregationalism. In the Massachusetts General Court, the magistrates sought the death penalty, but the deputies were more sympathetic to free expression; they refused to agree, and the men were eventually released.

Cotton became more conservative with age, and he tended to side more with the &quot;legalists&quot; when it came to religious opinion. He was dismayed when the success of Parliament in England opened the floodgates of religious opinion. In his view, new arrivals from England as well as visitors from Rhode Island were bringing with them &quot;horrifyingly erroneous opinions&quot;.

In July 1651, the Massachusetts Bay Colony was visited by three Rhode Islanders who had become Baptists: John Clarke, Obadiah Holmes, and John Crandall. Massachusetts reacted harshly against the visit, imprisoning the three men, while Cotton preached &quot;against the heinousness&quot; of the Anabaptist opinions of these men. The three men were given exorbitant fines, despite public opinion against punishment. Friends paid the fines for Clarke and Crandall, but Holmes refused to allow anyone to pay his fine. As a result, he was publicly whipped in such a cruel manner that he could only sleep on his elbows and knees for weeks afterwards. News of the persecutions reached England and met with a negative reaction. Sir Richard Saltonstall, a friend of Cotton&#x27;s from Lincolnshire, wrote to Cotton and Wilson in 1652 rebuking them for the practices of the colony. He wrote, &quot;It doth not a little grieve my spirit to heare what sadd things are reported dayly of your tyranny and persecutions in New-England as that you fyne, whip and imprison men for their consciences.&quot; He continued, &quot;these rigid wayes have layed you very lowe in the hearts of the saynts.&quot; Roger Williams also wrote a treatise on these persecutions which was published after Cotton&#x27;s death.

==Later life, death, and legacy==
During the final decade of his life, Cotton continued his extensive correspondence with people ranging from obscure figures to those who were highly prominent, such as Oliver Cromwell. His counsel was constantly requested, and Winthrop asked for his help in 1648 to rewrite the preface to the laws of New England. William Pynchon published a book that was considered unsound by the Massachusetts General Court, and copies were collected and burned on the Boston common. A letter from Cotton and four other elders attempted to moderate the harsh reaction of the court.

Religious fervor had been waning in the Massachusetts Bay Colony since the time of the first settlements, and church membership was dropping off. To counter this, minister Richard Mather suggested a means of allowing membership in the church without requiring a religious testimonial. Traditionally, parishioners had to make a confession of faith in order to have their children baptized and in order to participate in the sacrament of Holy Communion (Last Supper). In the face of declining church membership, Mather proposed the Half-way covenant, which was adopted. This policy allowed people to have their children baptized, even though they themselves did not offer a confession.

Cotton was concerned with church polity until the end of his life and continued to write about the subject in his books and correspondence. His final published work concerning Congregationalism was &quot;Certain Queries Tending to Accommodation, and Communion of Presbyterian &amp; Congregational Churches&quot; completed in 1652. It is evident in this work that he had become more liberal towards Presbyterian church polity. He was, nevertheless, unhappy with the direction taken in England. Author Everett Emerson writes that &quot;the course of English history was a disappointment to him, for not only did the English reject his Congregational practices developed in America, but the advocates of Congregationalism in England adopted a policy of toleration, which Cotton abhorred.&quot;

Some time in the autumn of 1652, Cotton crossed the Charles River to preach to students at Harvard. He became ill from the exposure, and in November he and others realized that he was dying. He was at the time running a sermon series on First Timothy for his Boston congregation which he was able to finish, despite becoming bed-ridden in December. On 2 December 1652, Amos Richardson wrote to John Winthrop, Jr.: &quot;Mr. Cotton is very ill and it is much feared will not escape this sickness to live. He hath great swellings in his legs and body&quot;. The &quot;Boston Vital Record&quot; gives his death date as 15 December; a multitude of other sources, likely correct, give the date as 23 December 1652. He was buried in the King&#x27;s Chapel Burying Ground in Boston and is named on a stone which also names early First Church ministers John Davenport (d. 1670), John Oxenbridge (d. 1674), and Thomas Bridge (d. 1713). Exact burial sites and markers for many first-generation settlers in that ground were lost when Boston&#x27;s first Anglican church, King&#x27;s Chapel I (1686), was placed on top of them. The present stone marker was placed by the church, but is likely a cenotaph.

===Legacy===
Many scholars, early and contemporary, consider Cotton to be the &quot;preeminent minister and theologian of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.&quot; Fellow Boston Church minister John Wilson wrote: &quot;Mr. Cotton preaches with such authority, demonstration, and life that, methinks, when he preaches out of any prophet or apostle I hear not him; I hear that very prophet and apostle. Yea, I hear the Lord Jesus Christ speaking in my heart.&quot; Wilson also called Cotton deliberate, careful, and in touch with the wisdom of God. Cotton&#x27;s contemporary John Davenport founded the New Haven Colony and he considered Cotton&#x27;s opinion to be law.

Cotton was highly regarded in England, as well. Biographer Larzer Ziff writes:

John Cotton, the majority of the English Puritans knew, was the American with the widest reputation for scholarship and pulpit ability; of all the American ministers, he had been consulted most frequently by the prominent Englishmen interested in Massachusetts; of all of the American ministers, he had been the one to supply England not only with descriptions of his practice, but with the theoretical base for it. John Cotton, the majority of the English Puritans concluded, was the prime mover in New England&#x27;s ecclesiastical polity.

Even Thomas Edwards, an opponent of Cotton&#x27;s in England, called him &quot;the greatest divine&quot; and the &quot;prime man of them all in New England&quot;.

Modern scholars agree that Cotton was the most eminent of New England&#x27;s early ministers. Robert Charles Anderson comments in the &quot;Great Migration&quot; series: &quot;John Cotton&#x27;s reputation and influence were unequaled among New England ministers, with the possible exception of Thomas Hooker.&quot; Larzer Ziff writes that Cotton &quot;was undeniably the greatest preacher in the first decades of New England history, and he was, for his contemporaries, a greater theologian than he was a polemicist.&quot; Ziff also considers him the greatest Biblical scholar and ecclesiastical theorist in New England. Historian Sargeant Bush notes that Cotton provided leadership both in England and America through his preaching, books, and his life as a nonconformist preacher, and that he became a leader in congregational autonomy, responsible for giving congregationalism its name. Literary scholar Everett Emerson calls Cotton a man of &quot;mildness and profound piety&quot; whose eminence was derived partly from his great learning.

Despite his position as a great New England minister, Cotton&#x27;s place in American history has been eclipsed by his theological adversary Roger Williams. Emerson claims that &quot;Cotton is probably best known in American intellectual history for his debate with Roger Williams over religious toleration,&quot; where Cotton is portrayed as &quot;medieval&quot; and Williams as &quot;enlightened&quot;. Putting Cotton into the context of colonial America and its impact on modern society, Ziff writes, &quot;An America in search of a past has gone to Roger Williams as a true parent and has remembered John Cotton chiefly as a monolithic foe of enlightenment.&quot;

==Family and descendants==


Cotton was married in Balsham, Cambridgeshire, on 3 July 1613 to Elizabeth Horrocks, but this marriage produced no children. Elizabeth died about 1630. Cotton married Sarah, the daughter of Anthony Hawkred and widow of Roland Story, in Boston, Lincolnshire, on 25 April 1632, and they had six children. His oldest child Seaborn was born during the crossing of the Atlantic on 12 August 1633, and he married Dorothy, the daughter of Simon and Anne Bradstreet. Daughter Sariah was born in Boston (Massachusetts) on 12 September 1635 and died there in January 1650. Elizabeth was born 9 December 1637, and she married Jeremiah Eggington. John was born 15 March 1640; he attended Harvard and married Joanna Rossiter. Maria was born 16 February 1642 and married Increase Mather, the son of Richard Mather. The youngest child was Rowland, who was baptized in Boston on 24 December 1643 and died in January 1650 during a smallpox epidemic, like his older sister Sariah.

Following Cotton&#x27;s death, his widow married the Reverend Richard Mather. Cotton&#x27;s grandson, Cotton Mather who was named for him, became a noted minister and historian. Cotton&#x27;s granddaughter Lumina Cotton was a botanist, writer and teacher who was the first woman to receive a doctorate in Botany from Ohio State University. Among Cotton&#x27;s descendants are Rev Nathaniel Thayer; U.S. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., Attorney General Elliot Richardson, actor John Lithgow, and clergyman Phillips Brooks.

==Works==
Cotton&#x27;s written legacy includes a large body of correspondence, numerous sermons, a catechism, and a shorter catechism for children titled &quot;Spiritual Milk for Boston Babes&quot;. The last is considered the first children&#x27;s book by an American; it was incorporated into &quot;The New England Primer&quot; around 1701 and remained a component of that work for over 150 years. This catechism was published in 1646 and went through nine printings in the 17th century. It is composed of a list of questions with answers. Cotton&#x27;s grandson Cotton Mather wrote, &quot;the children of New England are to this day most usually fed with [t]his excellent catechism&quot;. Among Cotton&#x27;s most famous sermons is &quot;&quot; (1630), preached to the colonists preparing to depart from England with John Winthrop&#x27;s fleet.

In May 1636, Cotton was appointed to a committee to make a draft of laws that agreed with the Word of God and would serve as a constitution. &quot;Moses, his judicialls&quot; was written by the subject, but it was not adopted. The resulting legal code was titled &quot;An Abstract of the laws of New England as they are now established&quot;. This was only modestly used in Massachusetts, but the code became the basis for John Davenport&#x27;s legal system in the New Haven Colony and also provided a model for the new settlement at Southampton, Long Island.

Cotton&#x27;s most influential writings on church government were &quot;The Keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven&quot; and &quot;The Way of Congregational Churches Cleared&quot;, where he argues for Congregational polity instead of Presbyterian governance. He also carried on a pamphlet war with Roger Williams concerning separatism and liberty of conscience. Williams&#x27;s &quot;The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution&quot; (1644) brought forth Cotton&#x27;s reply &quot;The Bloudy Tenent washed and made white in the bloud of the Lamb&quot;, to which Williams responded with &quot;Bloudy Tenent Yet More Bloudy by Mr. Cotton&#x27;s Endeavour to Wash it White in the Blood of the Lamb&quot;.

Cotton&#x27;s &quot;Treatise of the Covenant of Grace&quot; was prepared posthumously from his sermons by Thomas Allen, formerly Teacher of Charlestown, and published in 1659. It was cited at length by Jonathan Mitchell in his &#x27;Preface to the Christian Reader&#x27; in the Report of the Boston Synod of 1662. A general list of Cotton&#x27;s works is given in the Bibliotheca Britannica.

<doc id="533235" wikidata="Q6050324" url="?curid=533235" title="International Epidemiological Association">
<text>The International Epidemiological Association (IEA) is a worldwide association with more than 2000 members in over 100 different countries, who follow the aims of the association to facilitate communication amongst those engaged in research and teaching of epidemiology throughout the world, and to encourage its use in all fields of health including social, community and preventative medicine. These aims are achieved by holding scientific meetings and seminars, by publication of journals, reports, translations of books, by contact amongst members and by other activities consistent with these aims. Members are accepted without regard to race, religion, sex, political affiliation or country of origin.

The association publishes its own Journal, the &quot;International Journal of Epidemiology&quot; (IJE), which is published bi-monthly, a complimentary copy of which is included in the membership dues. It also sponsors a number of publications such as &quot;A Dictionary of Epidemiology&quot;, and &quot;The Development of Modern Epidemiology&quot;. In addition, the association organizes The World Congress of Epidemiology (WCE), which is held triennially in different parts of the world. The 19th WCE was held in Edinburgh, Scotland, August 2011, while the 20th WCE will be held in Anchorage, Alaska, August 2014. Regional Scientific Meetings are also held in the IEA regions during three-year periods between WCEs.

The IEA is in official relations with the World Health Organization (WHO) and is run by a council including executive and regional councilors for its seven regions in addition to the ex-officio members.

==Aims==

The objectives of the IEA are to:
* Promote the use of epidemiology and its application to the solution of health problems.
* Encourage the development of epidemiological methods and improvement in these methods.
* Promote the communication of epidemiological methods and findings amongst epidemiologists throughout the world as well as amongst all others concerned with health.
* Co-operate with both national and international organisations which are concerned with the promotion of health in the application of epidemiological methods in the solution of problems.
* Improve the dissemination of epidemiological findings nationally and internationally.
* Improve the recruitment, education and training of epidemiologists.

These objectives are achieved through networking professionals working in the field of epidemiology through different means, including its website: www.IEAweb.org Home; holding national, regional and international scientific meetings and congresses, as well as individual contacts between professional members. These have guided IEA&#x27;s activities over the years.

A determined effort was made in this decade to develop regional activities and to strengthen IEA links and co-operation with the WHO.

==Founding==

The International Corresponding Club, as the IEA was first called, was started in 1954 by John Pemberton of Great Britain and Harold N Willard of the United States with the advice and help of Robert Cruickshank. They had found, as traveling Research Fellows each in the other&#x27;s country, that they were handicapped by not being sufficiently well informed about the research and teaching in the field of social and preventive medicine in the various medical schools and research institutes. Initially it was to try and remedy this defect, that the Club was established on a small and informal basis. At first it was just a corresponding club whose object was &quot;to facilitate the communication between physicians working for the most part in university departments of preventive and social medicine, or in research institutes devoted to these aspects of medicine, throughout the world&quot;. This was to be achieved by the publication of a Bulletin twice a year and by members endeavouring to &quot;ensure a friendly and hospitable welcome for visitors&quot; from other countries. The first issue of the Bulletin appeared in January 1955 and contained contributions from 26 correspondents from nine countries.

Correspondents soon felt the need to meet to discuss research and teaching and the first formal meeting took place at the Ciba Foundation in London at the end of June 1956. By this time there were 49 correspondents from 18 countries, and one of them, A. Querido of Amsterdam invited the Club to hold its First International Scientific Meeting in the Netherlands. As a consequence a Study Group on Current Epidemiological Research, supported by a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, took place at Noordwijk in September 1957. There were 58 participants representing 44 university departments from 20 countries at this meeting. A constitution was formulated and the first executive committee was elected. The Noordwijk meeting was the first of the nineteenth international scientific meetings which have been held to date. The second was held in the Universidad del Valle in Cali, Colombia, in 1959 when the present title of the association was adopted.

==The World Congress of Epidemiology (WCE)==

With few exceptions, the scientific meetings of the association have been held every three years since 1957 in different locations around the world. At the first Council Meeting held in Montreal 17–18 August 2002, it was agreed that all meetings formerly entitled International Scientific Meeting would henceforth be called World Congress of Epidemiology (WCE), with a continued sequence of numbering. Here is a list of the WCE held since 1957:
* I Noordwijk, Netherlands, September 1957
* II Cali, Colombia, August 1959
* III Korčula, Yugoslavia, August 1961
* IV Princeton, US, August 1964
* V Primosten, Yugoslavia, August 1968
* VI Primosten, Yugoslavia, August 1971
* VII Brighton, England, August 1974
* VIII San Juan, Puerto Rico, September 1977

* XXI Saitama, Japan, August 2017
* XXII Melbourne, Australia, September 2021 [online]
* XXIII Cape Town, South Africa, September 2024

==Educational work==

The IEA has always attached great importance to the educational aspects of its work and its first Chairman, Robert Cruikshank, often used the phrase &quot;spreading the gospel&quot; to describe these aims.

The meeting in Cali in 1959 stimulated great interest in epidemiology in Colombia and as a result three seminars on epidemiology were later organized by the IEA in that country. This marked the beginning of a series of seminars in the South American continent and the Caribbean area.

The Milbank Memorial Fund helped to make this extensive series of seminars possible and the WHO, through the Pan American Health Organization, also cooperated in these seminars. By 1977 the IEA had organized, or played a prominent part in, 23 Seminars or Workshops on epidemiology in 19 different countries. These were often conducted in association with the WHO. The association only undertakes to organize or participate in seminars at the invitation of the national or local educational or governmental bodies concerned.

In 1969 a decision was taken to produce a guide on the teaching of epidemiology which would be suitable for use throughout the world. The WHO agreed to cooperate in this project and Dr Ronald Lowe and Jan Kostrzewski were asked to edit the guide. It was published first in English as Epidemiology: A guide to Teaching Methods Teaching Epidemiology: A guide for teachers in epidemiology, public health and clinical medicine and also published in French, German, Polish, Serbo-Croat Slovak, and Spanish editions; and editions in Russian and Slovakare in preparation.

Other of the classic texts sponsored by the IEA in collaboration with Oxford University Press is &quot;A Dictionary of Epidemiology&quot; Oxford University Press: A Dictionary of Epidemiology: Miquel Porta which remains the definitive dictionary in epidemiology worldwide. In fact, with contributions from over 220 epidemiologists and other users of epidemiology from around the globe, it is more than a dictionary: it includes explanations and comments on both core epidemiologic terms and on other scientific terms relevant to all professionals in clinical medicine and public health, as well as to professionals in the other health, life, and social sciences. The aim of the IEA in cosponsoring this dictionary in its more than 20-year history has been to facilitate communication among epidemiologist to develop a &quot;common language&quot; to the extent that this is possible. The first fourth editions of the dictionary were edited by John Last and the fifth edition was edited by Miquel Porta. In addition, the IEA has produced a publication to commemorate its 50th anniversary called &quot;History of Modern Epidemiology&quot; in addition to supporting three editions of the publication &quot;Teaching Epidemiology&quot; Teaching Epidemiology: A guide for teachers in epidemiology, public health and clinical medicine. The IEA offers a free copy of one of the first two publications as an incentive for life-time (10-years) or 3-year membership.

The IEA also comments on current topical issues in epidemiology through a series of online &quot;rapid response&quot; commentaries EpiBlog « IEA.

==The International Journal of Epidemiology (IJE)==

A decision was taken at the Sixth International Meeting in 1971 to found an international quarterly journal of epidemiology. The council believed that the journal could replace the old Bulletin in providing a link between members in intervals between international meetings by publishing association news, and serve a valuable purpose by publishing original articles in the field of epidemiology. Walter W. Holland was appointed the first editor in 1972. Between 2001 and 2016 under the editorship of George Davey Smith and Shah Ebrahim, the journal expanded. They introduced a number of new features and the positive effects of these changes are reflected in its improved impact factor (7.2 in 2015), which places it first among the international epidemiology journals. Six issues of the journal are published every year. Stephen Leeder took over as editor in 2017.

==Affiliations with international organizations==

The association has a long tradition of collaboration with other organizations, particularly with the WHO and the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) and International Clinical Epidemiologic Network (INCLEN) Inclen.

The IEA became affiliated with the CIOMS in 1955 and was represented on its executive committee. This affiliation led the association to the participation in preparing the international ethical guidelines for epidemiological studies, recognized by WHO as a key reference.

In 1966 the association was recognized by the WHO as a Non-Governmental Organization. In addition to representation at the World Health Assembly and regional committees, this affiliation contributed to excellent working relationships with WHO in the planning and execution of educational programmes of the IEA and in the production of the &quot;Guide to Teaching Epidemiology&quot;.

The IEA is also an active member of the Countdown initiative, and provides oversight on data quality, analyses and interpretation. The Countdown to 2015: Maternal, Newborn and Child Health is a global initiative that includes academics and representatives of multilateral and bilateral agencies, professional organizations and civil society who share the common goal of increasing accountability for progress towards the Millennium Development Goals for improving the health of mothers and children.

==Membership==

In the earlier years of the IEA, British and North American members were in the majority, mainly because the association had its origins in the UK and US. The council of the association has always been very conscious of this tendency and made active efforts to broaden the representativeness of the association by encouraging members to nominate epidemiologists from other countries. Nowadays, membership is growing in the association, with over 2,000 current members from around the world. Current membership categories include:

# Ordinary members (fully paid up members)
# Senior members (eligible for 50% discount of annual membership)
# Student members (eligible for 50% discount of annual membership)
# Joint members (with national epidemiological associations)
# Sponsored members
# Honorary members

The IEA has recently introduced a scheme of joint membership with various national epidemiological societies. Members of participating national societies join IEA at 30% of the usual rate and have all of the benefits of regular IEA membership, except that they receive the e-version of the IJE only. Joint membership have established with the following associations:

==Regional activities==

The development and strengthening of regional activities is manifested by the record of the regional meetings. These have been stimulating affairs as shown by the publications which resulted. There have been regular meetings in most IEA Regions, including: Africa, South-East Asia, Eastern Mediterranean, Europe, Latin America and Caribbean, North America and Western Pacific and occasional ones in the remainder. Of particular note have been those which marked the foundation and strength of national epidemiological associations as in Japan, China and Holland. The growth and interest in epidemiology and the enormous improvement in the quality, as well as the quantity of epidemiological research has been particularly notable in some IEA regions as South East Asia. For example, the Australian Regional IEA meeting in 1973 was attended by nine Japanese - at that time the only such practicing scientists in that country. There was, by 1995, a flourishing national association with more than 900 members and its own Journal published in English. It was the host for the 1996 International Scientific Meeting (ISM). The number of participants, at Regional Meetings in this area e.g. from China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand illustrate the increasing penetration of Epidemiology discipline.

The growth and strengthening of Epidemiology discipline outside Western Europe and North America has also led to increase in bids to act as hosts for ISMs, now known as WCEs.

==International training==

In effort of enforcing the capacity building role of IEA and moving the 20-year-old Florence course to the south, IEA has started an annual short-course in epidemiological methods. Indeed, the course is allied to the IEA-sponsored European Educational Programme in Epidemiology Programmes EEPE, annually held in Florence for three weeks every June/July, under the directorship of Rodolfo Saracci, for more than 2 decades. Thus, such course is intended as a &quot;Florence South&quot; course, run annually on a five-year cycle of the IEA regions outside of Europe and North America (South East Asia, Eastern Mediterranean, Africa, Latin America and Western Pacific). Introductory, intermediate and advance level courses are offered to provide epidemiologists and public health professionals an opportunity to become acquainted with the advances in epidemiologic methods that can enhance the role of epidemiology in clinical medicine and public health. These courses are addressed to epidemiologists, public health professionals, statisticians, and clinicians and include lectures, computer based analyses, exercises, discussion sessions, and practical experience in the design of a research proposal. The first course was held in Jaipur, India, in April 2009, the second in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in April, 2010, the third in Malawi in April 2011, while the latest was held in Lima, Peru, during May 2012. It is planned to have the upcoming course in Hangzhou, China, 2013.

The IEA also sponsors pre-conference courses prior to the WCE.

==Sir Richard Doll Prize==

In commemoration of Sir Richard Doll, IEA established in 2007 the &quot;Richard Doll Prize in Epidemiology&quot; to be awarded on triennial basis. The prize is awarded to an epidemiologist of the highest scientific standard. The recipient is honored for his/her scientific achievements that have advanced our understanding of the determinants of a disease of importance for health in populations through a body of research that may involve a series of studies, rather than a single publication. The prize winner is selected by a committee which includes current IEA president, president-elect, past-president in addition to two members appointed by the IEA Council. The prize is presented at the triennial WCE as $30,000 and a special plaque. The first prize has been conferred in 2008 to Prof Nubia Muñoz, while the second was awarded to Prof David Barker in 2011. Subsequent winners included Sir Richard Peto in 2014 George Davey Smith in 2017 and Cesar Victora in 2021.

==Early Career Epidemiologists (ECE)==

The IEA Executive Committee recently decided to create an International (worldwide) Early Career Epidemiologists group (ECE) within the IEA structure. A successful first meeting of ECE was held during the XIX IEA World Congress of Epidemiology (WCE) in Edinburgh (Scotland). The aims of this group are similar to those of the IEA, with a focus on identifying tools and opportunities to develop knowledge and careers for emerging professionals engaged in the field of epidemiology throughout the world. The IEA has decided to invest effort and resources in ensuring the connectivity among ECE and thus facilitate the promulgation of opportunities for IEA training events, a mentoring scheme, and other activities which promote the advance and appropriate use of the epidemiological methods and its development in all regions.

==The future==

The educational work of the IEA has always been regarded as one of its most important functions. This will continue through the media of the &quot;International Journal of Epidemiology&quot; and the International and Regional Scientific meetings. It is hoped that the IEA will be able to continue to play a part in the organization of seminars particularly in those parts of the world where epidemiology is not well developed. Owing to the lack of funds for this purpose such activities may have to be confined, for the present, to co-operation with national or international organizations, in particular the WHO, by providing faculty members and resource material rather than funds.

There was general support for continued regional development at the Seventh International Meeting and the first steps were taken towards the organization of further regional meetings. The previous council recommended that regional IEA councils covering the WHO regions should be established in order to stimulate recruitment of members and the organization of international meetings within regions. The present council consists of members from all the WHO regions and it is now considering the whole question of regional development.

<text>The Prudential Center (colloquially the Pru) is an enclosed shopping mall within the mixed-use Prudential Center complex in the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. It is located at the base of the Prudential Tower, and provides direct indoor connections to several nearby destinations, including the Hynes Convention Center, the office towers at 101 and 111 Huntington Avenue, and the Sheraton Boston hotel. The mall is connected to the Copley Place shopping mall via a skybridge over Huntington Avenue. As of 2022, the complex features notable brands such as Saks Fifth Avenue, Earl&#x27;s, Lacoste, Club Monaco, Ralph Lauren, and Vineyard Vines.

== Description ==
A Mandarin Oriental hotel is part of the complex, as well as the Avalon and the Belvidere Residences apartments.

The shopping complex is anchored by Saks Fifth Avenue. The mall is home to over 75 specialty retailers, including upscale stores such as Earl&#x27;s, Lacoste, Club Monaco, Ralph Lauren, Vineyard Vines, and more. Around 20 food-related businesses ranging from quick snacks to fine dining are located at the mall, with many other independent restaurants located nearby outside. A open-market format Eataly location was opened in November 2016, replacing a former food court within the mall.

Transportation connections include the Prudential subway station and the nearby Hynes Convention Center station, both on branches of the MBTA Green Line. The Back Bay multimodal station, with access to the MBTA Orange Line, MBTA Commuter Rail, and Amtrak inter-city rail, is a short climate-controlled walk away via the adjacent Copley Place shopping mall. MBTA bus routes 39, 54, and 507 stop at the center, and there is underground parking available on-site.

===St. Francis Chapel===
The St. Francis Chapel, a functioning Roman Catholic chapel staffed by the Oblates of the Virgin Mary and located inside the shopping center since 1969, offers three daily masses, the sacrament of reconciliation, and Eucharistic adoration daily, as well as a religious giftshop.

====20th century====
The original chapel was first dedicated on November 11, 1969, by Cardinal Richard Cushing. A crowd of 400, almost double its official capacity, crowded into the chapel for the dedication. Cushing said at the time he wanted it to be an &quot;ecumenical chapel. We want people of all faiths to come here and speak to God through their own prayers.&quot; He also wanted &quot;to make Christ&#x27;s presence known in the heart of a sprawling modern cityscape.&quot; Present at the dedication was Fr. Robert Lynch, OFM, the chapel&#x27;s first director.

It was originally staffed by the Franciscans who had come to Boston to establish the Shrine of St. Anthony in 1947. It was designed by Brother Cajetan Baumann, OFM, the head of Franciscan Art and Architecture Office and built by Cambridge&#x27;s Thomas O&#x27;Connor Company.

On June 1, 1983, the Franciscans turned over the Chapel to the Oblates of the Virgin Mary. In 1986, construction forced that chapel to close and a new chapel to be reopened near the entrance of the Hynes Convention Center, next to a Dunkin Donuts. This chapel, which is still in operation, was dedicated on April 28, 1993, by Cardinal Bernard Law.

====21st century====
In 2025, many of those who attend mass or come to pray at the chapel are young people, including many students from nearby colleges and universities. A group of students from the Berklee College of Music formed a choir. It also serves a large Hispanic community. It is estimated that between 1,500 and 2,000 people enter the chapel in a given week, many of whom are seeking to go to confession after years of being away from the Church.

In early 2025, the chapel underwent a series of renovations, including its first new coat of paint in 18 years, for a total cost of $40,000. The renovations were spurred by a $25,000 anonymous gift. Part of the renovations included scrubbing the walls behind the votive candles, which were smoky after tens of thousands of prayers were said there in the previous 30 years.

, Father Jeremy Paulin is the director of the chapel, a position he has held since June 2024.

== History ==
The location originally consisted of marshlands next to the Charles River in the Back Bay district of Boston. These wetlands were gradually filled in, and a large railyard was built. In the early 1960s, the railyard was replaced by the Prudential Tower and several smaller buildings.

Originally, only one department store (Saks), along with a handful of shops, existed around the base of the Prudential Tower in a small shopping arcade. Nearby structures including the Hynes Convention Center, 101 Huntington Avenue office tower, a Sheraton Hotel, and other various shops were separated by open plazas in a patchwork of disjointed buildings.

A large, windswept paved plaza off Boylston Street was dominated by a sculptural bronze male nude by Boston-educated artist Donald Harcourt De Lue, titled &quot;Quest Eternal&quot;, and installed in 1967. Popularly known as &quot;The Naked Guy&quot;, the 5-ton sculpture, cast in one piece, depicted a Mannerist heroic figure stretched diagonally upwards towards the sky. The Boston Christmas Tree, annually donated by Nova Scotia, was placed on this plaza from 1971 until 2002, when it was moved to the Boston Common.

In 1991, a plan was put forth to connect all of the buildings together with an enclosed and expanded shopping center, in the area bordered by Boylston Street, Huntington Avenue, and Dalton Street. The Hahn Company, together with then-owner Prudential Insurance Company of America, spent over two years developing the $100 million project.

In 1993, the new Shops at Prudential Center was completed, and largely successful in filling its new spaces. Multiple buildings surrounding the Prudential Center were now connected through the shopping arcade, with pedestrian traffic ranging from office workers to convention attendees, able to travel conveniently to various destinations regardless of the weather.

In 2014, a new entrance to the Prudential Center was built to replace the remaining open plaza bordering Boylston Street. This required that the &quot;Quest Eternal&quot; statue be removed, and its whereabouts and future were unknown to the general public. In 2019, the Boston City Council announced that it had accepted the donation of the statue from Boston Properties, and would install it in the public Smith Playground, near the intersection of Western Avenue and North Harvard Street in the Allston district. There remain several smaller works of public art at the Prudential Center complex, including temporary art installations.

On August 24, 2020, it was announced that high end regional division Lord &amp; Taylor would close. On June 30, 2022, it was announced that Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods was in final negotiations to take over the Lord &amp; Taylor building at the center for its House of Sports concept store.

== Reception ==
In November 2019, the online business news website MassLive rated the Shops at Prudential Center as fifth, and the immediately adjacent Copley Place as fourth-best, among 40 malls and shopping centers in Massachusetts.

<doc id="533237" wikidata="Q742672" url="?curid=533237" title="Dyscalculia">
<text>Dyscalculia () is a learning disability resulting in difficulty learning or comprehending arithmetic, such as difficulty in understanding numbers, numeracy, learning how to manipulate numbers, performing mathematical calculations, and learning facts in mathematics. It is sometimes colloquially referred to as &quot;math dyslexia&quot;, though this analogy can be misleading as they are distinct syndromes.

Dyscalculia is associated with dysfunction in the region around the intraparietal sulcus and potentially also the frontal lobe. Dyscalculia does not reflect a general deficit in cognitive abilities or difficulties with time, measurement, and spatial reasoning. Estimates of the prevalence of dyscalculia range between 3 and 6% of the population. In 2015 it was established that 11% of children with dyscalculia also have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Dyscalculia has also been associated with Turner syndrome and people who have spina bifida.

Mathematical disabilities can occur as the result of some types of brain injury, in which case the term &quot;acalculia&quot; is used instead of &quot;dyscalculia&quot;, which is of innate, genetic or developmental origin.

==Signs and symptoms==
The earliest appearance of dyscalculia is typically a deficit in subitizing, the ability to know, from a brief glance and without counting, how many objects there are in a small group. Children as young as five can subitize six objects, especially while looking at the dots on the sides of dice. However, children with dyscalculia can subitize fewer objects and, even when correct, take longer to identify the number than their age-matched peers. Dyscalculia often looks different at different ages. It tends to become more apparent as children get older; however, symptoms can appear as early as preschool. Common symptoms of dyscalculia are having difficulty with mental math, trouble analyzing time and reading an analog clock, struggle with motor sequencing that involves numbers, and often counting on fingers when adding numbers.

===Persistence in children===
Although many researchers believe dyscalculia to be a persistent disorder, evidence on the persistence of dyscalculia remains mixed. For instance, in a study done by Mazzocco and Myers (2003), researchers evaluated children on a slew of measures and selected their most consistent measure as their best diagnostic criterion: a stringent 10th-percentile cut-off on the TEMA-2. Even with their best criterion, they found dyscalculia diagnoses for children longitudinally did not persist; only 65% of students who were ever diagnosed over the course of four years were diagnosed for at least two years. The percentage of children who were diagnosed in two consecutive years was further reduced. It is unclear whether this was the result of misdiagnosed children improving in mathematics and spatial awareness as they progressed as normal, or that the subjects who showed improvement were accurately diagnosed, but exhibited signs of a non-persistent learning disability.

=== Persistence in adults ===
There are very few studies of adults with dyscalculia who have had a history of it growing up, but such studies have shown that it can persist into adulthood. It can affect major parts of an adult&#x27;s life. Most adults with dyscalculia have a hard time processing math at a 4th-grade level. For 1st–4th grade level, many adults will know what to do for the math problem, but they will often get them wrong because of &quot;careless errors&quot;, although they are not careless when it comes to the problem. The adults cannot process their errors on the math problems or may not even recognize that they have made these errors. Visual-spatial input, auditory input, and touch input will be affected due to these processing errors. Dyscalculics may have a difficult time adding numbers in a column format because their mind can mix up the numbers, and it is possible that they may get the same (wrong) answer twice due to their mind processing the problem incorrectly. Dyscalculics can have problems determining differences in different coins and their size or giving the correct amount of change and if numbers are grouped together, it is possible that they cannot determine which has less or more. If a dyscalculic is asked to choose the greater of two numbers, with the lesser number in a larger font than the greater number, they may take the question literally and pick the number with the bigger font. Adults with dyscalculia may struggle with directions while driving and with controlling their finances, leading to difficulties on a day-to-day basis.

====College students or other adult learners====
College students particularly may have a difficult time due to the fast pace and change in difficulty of the work they are given. As a result of this, students may develop much anxiety and frustration. After dealing with their anxiety for a long time, students can become averse to math and try to avoid it as much as possible, which may result in lower grades in math courses. Students with dyscalculia, however, can also do exceptionally well in writing, reading, and speaking.

==Causes==
Both domain-general and domain-specific causes have been put forth. With respect to pure developmental dyscalculia, domain-general causes are unlikely as they should not impair one&#x27;s ability in the numerical domain without also affecting other domains such as reading.

Two competing domain-specific hypotheses about the causes of developmental dyscalculia have been proposed – the &quot;magnitude representation&quot; (or &quot;number module deficit hypothesis&quot;) and the &quot;access deficit hypothesis&quot;.

===Magnitude representation deficit===
Dehaene&#x27;s &quot;number sense&quot; theory suggests that approximate numerosities are automatically ordered in an ascending manner on a mental number line. The mechanism to represent and process non-symbolic magnitude (e.g., number of dots) is often known as the &quot;approximate number system&quot; (ANS), and a core deficit in the precision of the ANS, known as the &quot;magnitude representation hypothesis&quot; or &quot;number module deficit hypothesis&quot;, has been proposed as an underlying cause of developmental dyscalculia.

In particular, the structural features of the ANS are theoretically supported by a phenomenon called the &quot;numerical distance effect&quot;, which has been robustly observed in numerical comparison tasks. Typically developing individuals are less accurate and slower in comparing pairs of numbers closer together (e.g., 7 and 8) than further apart (e.g., 2 and 9). A related &quot;numerical ratio effect&quot; (in which the ratio between two numbers varies but the distance is kept constant, e.g., 2 vs. 5 and 4 vs. 7) based on Weber&#x27;s law has also been used to further support the structure of the ANS. The numerical ratio effect is observed when individuals are less accurate and slower in comparing pairs of numbers that have a larger ratio (e.g., 8 and 9, ratio = 8/9) than a smaller ratio (2 and 3; ratio = 2/3). A larger numerical distance or ratio effect with comparison of sets of objects (i.e., non-symbolic) is thought to reflect a less precise ANS, and the ANS acuity has been found to correlate with math achievement in typically developing children and also in adults.

More importantly, several behavioral studies have found that children with developmental dyscalculia show an attenuated distance/ratio effect compared with typically developing children. Moreover, neuroimaging studies have also provided additional insights even when behavioral difference in distance/ratio effect might not be clearly evident. For example, Gavin R. Price and colleagues found that children with developmental dyscalculia showed no differential distance effect on reaction time relative to typically developing children, but they did show a greater effect of distance on response accuracy. They also found that the right intraparietal sulcus in children with developmental dyscalculia was not modulated to the same extent in response to non-symbolic numerical processing as in typically developing children. With the robust implication of the intraparietal sulcus in magnitude representation, it is possible that children with developmental dyscalculia have a weak magnitude representation in the parietal region. Yet, it does not rule out an impaired ability to access and manipulate numerical quantities from their symbolic representations (e.g., Arabic digits).

Moreover, findings from a cross-sectional study suggest that children with developmental dyscalculia might have a delayed development in their numerical magnitude representation by as much as five years. However, the lack of longitudinal studies still leaves the question open as to whether the deficient numerical magnitude representation is a delayed development or impairment.

===Access deficit hypothesis===

Rousselle &amp; Noël propose that dyscalculia is caused by the inability to map preexisting representations of numerical magnitude onto symbolic Arabic digits. Evidence for this hypothesis is based on research studies that have found that individuals with dyscalculia are proficient on tasks that measure knowledge of non-symbolic numerical magnitude (i.e., non-symbolic comparison tasks) but show an impaired ability to process symbolic representations of number (i.e., symbolic comparison tasks). Neuroimaging studies also report increased activation in the right intraparietal sulcus during tasks that measure symbolic but not non-symbolic processing of numerical magnitude. However, support for the access deficit hypothesis is not consistent across research studies.

==Diagnosis==
At its most basic level, dyscalculia is a learning disability affecting the normal development of arithmetic skills.

A consensus has not yet been reached on appropriate diagnostic criteria for dyscalculia. Mathematics is a specific domain that is complex (i.e. includes many different processes, such as arithmetic, algebra, word problems, geometry, etc.) and cumulative (i.e. the processes build on each other such that mastery of an advanced skill requires mastery of many basic skills). Thus dyscalculia can be diagnosed using different criteria, and frequently is; this variety in diagnostic criteria leads to variability in identified samples, and thus variability in research findings regarding dyscalculia.

Other than using achievement tests as diagnostic criteria, researchers often rely on domain-specific tests (i.e. tests of working memory, executive function, inhibition, intelligence, etc.) and teacher evaluations to create a more comprehensive diagnosis. Alternatively, fMRI research has shown that the brains of the children not affected can be reliably distinguished from the brains of the dyscalculic children based on the activation in the prefrontal cortex. However, due to the cost and time limitations associated with brain and neural research, these methods will likely not be incorporated into diagnostic criteria despite their effectiveness.

===Types===
Research on subtypes of dyscalculia has begun without consensus; preliminary research has focused on comorbid learning disorders as subtyping candidates. The most common comorbidity in individuals with dyscalculia is dyslexia. Most studies done with comorbid samples versus dyscalculic-only samples have shown different mechanisms at work and additive effects of comorbidity, indicating that such subtyping may not be helpful in diagnosing dyscalculia. But there is variability in results at present.

Due to high comorbidity with other disabilities such as dyslexia and ADHD, some researchers have suggested the possibility of subtypes of mathematical disabilities with different underlying profiles and causes. Whether a particular subtype is specifically termed &quot;dyscalculia&quot; as opposed to a more general mathematical learning disability is somewhat under debate in the scientific literature.
* Semantic memory: This subtype often coexists with reading disabilities such as dyslexia and is characterized by poor representation and retrieval from long-term memory. These processes share a common neural pathway in the left angular gyrus, which has been shown to be selective in arithmetic fact retrieval strategies and symbolic magnitude judgments. This region also shows low functional connectivity with language-related areas during phonological processing in adults with dyslexia. Thus, disruption to the left angular gyrus can cause both reading impairments and difficulties in calculation. This has been observed in individuals with Gerstmann syndrome, of which dyscalculia is one of constellation of symptoms.
* Procedural concepts: Research by Geary has shown that in addition to increased problems with fact retrieval, children with math disabilities may rely on immature computational strategies. Specifically, children with mathematical disabilities showed poor command of counting strategies unrelated to their ability to retrieve numeric facts. This research notes that it is difficult to discern whether poor conceptual knowledge is indicative of a qualitative deficit in number processing or simply a delay in typical mathematical development.
* Working memory: Studies have found that children with dyscalculia showed impaired performance on working memory tasks compared to neurotypical children. Furthermore, research has shown that children with dyscalculia have weaker activation of the intraparietal sulcus during visuospatial working memory tasks. Brain activity in this region during such tasks has been linked to overall arithmetic performance, indicating that numerical and working memory functions may converge in the intraparietal sulcus. However, working memory problems are confounded with domain-general learning difficulties, thus these deficits may not be specific to dyscalculia but rather may reflect a greater learning deficit. Dysfunction in prefrontal regions may also lead to deficits in working memory and other executive function, accounting for comorbidity with ADHD.

Studies have also shown indications of causes due to congenital or hereditary disorders, but evidence of this is not yet concrete.

==Treatment==
To date, very few interventions have been developed specifically for individuals with dyscalculia. Concrete manipulation activities have been used for decades to train basic number concepts for remediation purposes. This method facilitates the intrinsic relationship between a goal, the learner&#x27;s action, and the informational feedback on the action. A one-to-one tutoring paradigm designed by Lynn Fuchs and colleagues which teaches concepts in arithmetic, number concepts, counting, and number families using games, flash cards, and manipulables has proven successful in children with generalized math learning difficulties, but intervention has yet to be tested specifically on children with dyscalculia. These methods require specially trained teachers working directly with small groups or individual students. As such, instruction time in the classroom is necessarily limited. For this reason, several research groups have developed computer adaptive training programs designed to target deficits unique to dyscalculic individuals.

Software intended to remediate dyscalculia has been developed. While computer adaptive training programs are modeled after one-to-one type interventions, they provide several advantages. Most notably, individuals are able to practice more with a digital intervention than is typically possible with a class or teacher. As with one-to-one interventions, several digital interventions have also proven successful in children with generalized math learning difficulties. Räsänen and colleagues have found that games such as &quot;The Number Race&quot; and &quot;Graphogame-math&quot; can improve performance on number comparison tasks in children with generalized math learning difficulties.

Several digital interventions have been developed for dyscalculics specifically. Each attempts to target basic processes that are associated with maths difficulties. Rescue Calcularis was one early computerized intervention that sought to improve the integrity of and access to the mental number line. Other digital interventions for dyscalculia adapt games, flash cards, and manipulables to function through technology.

While each intervention claims to improve basic numerosity skills, the authors of these interventions do admit that repetition and practice effects may be a factor involved in reported performance gains. An additional criticism is that these digital interventions lack the option to manipulate numerical quantities. While the previous two games provide the correct answer, the individual using the intervention cannot actively determine, through manipulation, what the correct answer should be. Butterworth and colleagues argued that games like The Number Bonds, which allows an individual to compare different sized rods, should be the direction that digital interventions move toward. Such games use manipulation activities to provide intrinsic motivation toward content guided by dyscalculia research. One of these serious games is Meister Cody – Talasia, an online training that includes the CODY Assessment – a diagnostic test for detecting dyscalculia. Based on these findings, Dybuster Calcularis was extended by adaptation algorithms and game forms allowing manipulation by the learners. It was found to improve addition, subtraction and number line tasks, and was made available as Dybuster Calcularis.

A study used transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to the parietal lobe during numerical learning and demonstrated selective improvement of numerical abilities that was still present six months later in typically developing individuals. Improvement were achieved by applying anodal current to the right parietal lobe and cathodal current to the left parietal lobe and contrasting it with the reverse setup. When the same research group used tDCS in a training study with two dyscalculic individuals, the reverse setup (left anodal, right cathodal) demonstrated improvement of numerical abilities.

==Epidemiology==
Dyscalculia is thought to be present in 3–6% of the general population, but estimates by country and sample vary somewhat. Many studies have found prevalence rates by gender to be equivalent. Those that find gender difference in prevalence rates often find dyscalculia higher in females, but some few studies have found prevalence rates higher in males.

== History ==
The term &quot;dyscalculia&quot; was coined in the 1940s, but it was not completely recognized until 1974 by the work of Czechoslovakian researcher Ladislav Kosc. Kosc defined dyscalculia as &quot;a structural disorder of mathematical abilities.&quot; His research proved that the learning disability was caused by impairments to certain parts of the brain that control mathematical calculations and not because symptomatic individuals were &quot;mentally handicapped&quot;. Researchers now sometimes use the terms &quot;math dyslexia&quot; or &quot;math learning disability&quot; when they mention the condition. Cognitive disabilities specific to mathematics were originally identified in case studies with patients who experienced specific arithmetic disabilities as a result of damage to specific regions of the brain. More commonly, dyscalculia occurs developmentally as a genetically linked learning disability which affects a person&#x27;s ability to understand, remember, or manipulate numbers or number facts (e.g., the multiplication tables). The term is often used to refer specifically to the inability to perform arithmetic operations, but is also defined by some educational professionals and cognitive psychologists such as Stanislas Dehaene and Brian Butterworth as a more fundamental inability to conceptualize numbers as abstract concepts of comparative quantities (a deficit in &quot;number sense&quot;), which these researchers consider to be a foundational skill upon which other mathematics abilities build. Symptoms of dyscalculia include the delay of simple counting, inability to memorize simple arithmetic facts such as adding, subtracting, etc. There are few known symptoms because little research has been done on the topic.

==Etymology==

The term &quot;dyscalculia&quot; dates back to at least 1949.

Dyscalculia comes from Greek and Latin and means &quot;counting badly&quot;. The prefix comes from Greek and means &quot;badly&quot;. The root &quot;calculia&quot; comes from the Latin , which means &quot;to count&quot;; it is also a cognate of &quot;calculation&quot; and &quot;calculus&quot;.

<text>Queens Center Mall is an urban shopping mall in Elmhurst, Queens, New York City, on Queens Boulevard between 57th Avenue and Woodhaven Boulevard, one block away from Queens Place Mall. Queens Center Mall is the largest mall in Queens. It is currently owned and managed by The Macerich Company, who purchased the mall in the 1990s. The mall features Primark, JCPenney and Macy&#x27;s.

The mall has a gross leasable area of and 198 stores.

The mall is adjacent to the Woodhaven Boulevard station () on the IND Queens Boulevard Line of the New York City Subway. It is across the street from the former St. Johns Hospital and the Rock Church. It is also off Exit 19 on the Long Island Expressway.

==History==
Queens Center Mall opened on September 12, 1973, on land previously occupied by a children&#x27;s amusement park named Fairyland, a supermarket, and automobile parking. The original anchor tenants were Abraham &amp; Straus and Ohrbach&#x27;s. The mall underwent a major expansion from 2002 to 2004, nearly doubling in size as the original mall was renovated and another wing was added to the east of 92nd Street.

The mall&#x27;s current anchor tenants are Macy&#x27;s and JCPenney. In addition, it has a large food court in the basement. The food court includes BonChon, Burmese Bites &amp; Cbao, Charleys Philly Steaks, Chick-fil-A, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Famous Rotisserie &amp; Grill, Ice Queen, KFC, Kido Sushi, Noodle House, Panda Express, Poke Island Grill, San Wei, and Sarku Japan. In February 2024, the iconic Mcdonalds closed for good. It was a childhood memory for most people that grew up in the area. In addition, there are many other sit down restaurants scattered around the mall. In recent years, many restaurants come and go due to a surge in property tax. 

For a limited time during the 2006 Christmas shopping season, the Macy&#x27;s location in Queens Center was open 24 hours a day, becoming the first to do so. Since then, it has had all-day operating hours during every Christmas shopping season.

On March 8, 2019, the mall was evacuated when an appearance by rapper A Boogie wit da Hoodie was canceled and fans rioted and looted stores, including the Foot Locker. The mall reopened the next day.

<text>Staten Island Mall is a shopping mall in New Springville, Staten Island, New York City, opened in 1973. It is the only indoor shopping mall in the borough. It is the largest retail center on the island and is the site of the island&#x27;s third-largest public transit hub after the St. George Terminal and Eltingville Transit Center, with numerous bus routes that connect to the periphery of the mall area. It is the second largest shopping center in New York City. The mall features Primark, JCPenney, and Macy&#x27;s, in addition to an 11-screen dine-in AMC Theatres.

==Description==

The mall is owned by Brookfield Properties of Chicago, Illinois, itself a division of Brookfield Asset Management, whose U.S. operations are based in Manhattan. The mall has 200 stores employing approximately 3,000 people. Anchor tenants include JCPenney, Macy&#x27;s, Lidl, and Primark. The Food District also has anchors of Dave and Buster&#x27;s and an AMC Theatres dine-in cinema. A carnival by Reithoffer Shows was held from 1998 through 2018, bringing rides, games, and food stands into the parking lots of the mall. Amusements of America took the place of Reithoffer starting in 2019. The mall also has a strip mall called The Crossing, which features multiple shops and a restaurants.

== History ==
Prior to the construction of the mall, the land was occupied by the Staten Island Airport, which opened in 1941. The site was sold in 1955 with a shopping and amusement center envisaged, known as the Staten Island Center. In 1964 it was announced that Macy&#x27;s and Abraham &amp; Straus (A&amp;S) would open stores across from E. J. Korvette. Construction of the mall commenced in 1970 and it opened on August 9, 1973, with Macy&#x27;s and Sears. The A&amp;S store was not built on the property as announced years earlier. The shopping center was developed by Feist and Feist Realty Corp. and sold to the Rouse Company in 1980. Rouse remodeled the mall by removing the small shops in the center court known as the &quot;Honeycomb&quot;, adding escalators to the original six, and installing additional trees and several new fountains throughout the mall.

The mall was renovated and expanded in 1993 when the JCPenney wing was completed. JCPenney relocated to the mall from its longtime occupancy at the Forest Avenue Shoppers Town. The mall was originally a two-story building shaped like a letter &quot;T&quot;, with a large outdoor plaza on the Richmond Avenue side, gross leasable area (GLA) of and a tenant GLA of .

By the mid-2010, higher-end shops such as Michael Kors, Pandora, and Armani Exchange opened for business, and by 2011, numerous new brands (Adidas, Love Culture, etc.) were relocating or updating their looks while new tenants continued to revive the mall&#x27;s image.

The mall was expanded by between 2016 and 2019, which included the addition of a new retailers including Zara, Ulta Beauty, Dave &amp; Buster&#x27;s, Barnes &amp; Noble, Lidl, and AMC Theatres. The food court was moved from its former area into the newly expanded area in the mall, renamed the &quot;Food District&quot;. On March 15, 2017, Primark opened one of its first American locations. Sears closed, but The Container Store opened on an out parcel. A Krispy Kreme outparcel near the mall&#x27;s main entrance, the first Krispy Kreme on the island was opened in 2022.

By 2023, Staten Island Mall had announced several additions, among them are Newbury Comics, Miniso, Charlotte Russe, Sugar Bear, Hobby Lobby, and Rainbow. In April 2024, Uniqlo, a Japanese retailer and manufacturer, announced that it would reopen in Staten Island after 10 years. That October, Brookfield Properties announced that it planned to add to the mall.

==Transportation==
Several local, select and express New York City Transit Authority buses stop and either travel through or on the perimeter (where park and ride facilities exist) of the mall&#x27;s campus. They include the local buses/limited counterparts, the buses with no corresponding limited buses, the Select Bus Service route, and the express buses.

<text>John White (c. 1756 – 20 February 1832) was an Irish surgeon and botanical collector. 

== Biography ==
White was born in the townland of Drumaran, near Belcoo, in County Fermanagh in Ulster, the northern province in Ireland, about 1756, and not, as stated in the &quot;Dictionary of Australian Biography&quot; and the &quot;Australian Dictionary of Biography&quot;, in Sussex, England. On 18 June 1778 John White qualified as a surgeon&#x27;s mate, first rate, following examination at the Company of Surgeons in London. He entered the Royal Navy on 26 June 1778 as surgeon&#x27;s mate aboard . He was promoted surgeon in 1780, serving aboard until 1786 when Sir Andrew Hamond recommended him as principal naval surgeon for the voyage of the First Fleet to Australia.

In March 1787 White joined the First Fleet at Plymouth as surgeon for the convict transport &quot;Charlotte&quot;, where he found that the convicts had been living for some time on salt meat, a bad preparation for a long voyage. He succeeded in obtaining supplies of fresh meat and vegetables for them, and arranged that they should be allowed up on deck in relays to obtain fresh air. On arrival in Australia, White engaged one of the convicts, Thomas Barrett, to engrave a silver medallion to mark the occasion. The medallion, or &quot;Charlotte Medal&quot;, is displayed in Australia&#x27;s National Maritime Museum.

In 1788 White was appointed Surgeon-General of New South Wales and organised a hospital for the new colony, somewhat hampered by a lack of medical supplies. He became interested in the native flora and fauna of the new land and investigated the potential of Australian plants for use as medicine. He observed the olfactory qualities of eucalyptus and distilled eucalyptus oil in 1788.

White wrote &quot;A Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales&quot; (1790), which described many Australian species for the first time. &quot;Journal&quot; had 65 copper-plate engravings of birds, animals and plants, many of which were based on the water colour paintings of Sarah Stone, and during the next five years was translated into German and French. It is believed (by his unnamed biographer) that Thomas William Parr was employed as a sketch artist by White to produce natural history drawings as a starting point for development and colouring by other artists. White was the first to describe &quot;Litoria caerulea&quot;, a species of frog endemic to Australia and New Guinea, which has several common names, including &quot;White&#x27;s tree frog&quot;. In 1792, Thomas Watling a convict artist newly arrived to the colony was appointed by the government to assist John White in the production of copies of illustrations of various plants, insects and animals. A portrait of John White, a miniature on ivory, signed by Thomas Watling and dated &quot;N.S.Wales 1792&quot; is in the National Museum of Australia.

According to his journal, White severely disliked Australia, describing it as: &quot;a country and place so forbidding and so hateful as only to merit execration and curses.&quot; He applied for leave of absence in 1792, and received it in 1794, sailing for England on 17 December 1794 and later travelled to Ireland. In 1796 he resigned his position when given the option of returning to Australia. Earlier in 1796, White was elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society of London, and on 10 March 1797, the Senate of the University of St Andrews conferred the degree of Doctor of Medicine on him. White was a surgeon on HMS &quot;Royal William&quot;, and for 20 years he was stationed first at Sheerness from 1799 and then at Chatham Dockyard from 1803. He retired on a half pension in 1820, and died in Worthing, England in 1832.

==Legacy ==
Sydney&#x27;s White Bay is named in his honour.

John White is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of Australian lizard, &quot;Egernia whitii&quot;.
