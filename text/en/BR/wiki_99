<text>Dumbing down is the deliberate oversimplification of intellectual content in education, literature, cinema, news, video games, and culture. Originating in 1933, the term &quot;dumbing down&quot; was movie-business slang, used by screenplay writers, meaning: &quot;[to] revise so as to appeal to those of little education or intelligence&quot;. Dumbing-down varies according to subject matter, and usually involves the diminishment of critical thought by undermining standard language and learning standards, thus trivializing academic standards, culture, and meaningful information, as in the case of popular culture. 

==Education==
In the late 20th century, the proportion of young people attending university in the UK increased sharply, including many who previously would not have been considered to possess the appropriate scholastic aptitude. In 2003, the UK Minister for Universities, Margaret Hodge, criticised Mickey Mouse degrees as a negative consequence of universities dumbing down their courses to meet &quot;the needs of the market&quot;: these degrees are conferred for studies in a field of endeavour &quot;where the content is perhaps not as [intellectually] rigorous as one would expect, and where the degree, itself, may not have huge relevance in the labour market&quot;: thus, a university degree of slight intellectual substance, which the student earned by &quot;simply stacking up numbers on Mickey Mouse courses, is not acceptable&quot;.

In &quot;Dumbing Us Down: The Hidden Curriculum of Compulsory Schooling&quot; (1991, 2002), John Taylor Gatto presented speeches and essays, including &quot;The Psychopathic School&quot;, his acceptance speech for the 1990 New York City Teacher of the Year award, and &quot;The Seven-Lesson Schoolteacher&quot;, his acceptance speech upon being named as the New York State Teacher of the Year for 1991. Gatto writes that while he was hired to teach English and literature, he came to believe he was employed as part of a social engineering project. The &quot;seven lessons&quot; at the foundation of schooling were never explicitly stated, Gatto writes, but included teaching students that their self-worth depended on outside evaluation, that they were constantly ranked and supervised, and that they had no opportunities for privacy or solitude. Gatto speculated:

In examining the seven lessons of teaching, Gatto concluded that &quot;all of these lessons are prime training for permanent underclasses, people deprived forever of finding the center of their own special genius&quot;. That &quot;school is a twelve-year jail sentence, where bad habits are the only curriculum truly learned. I teach school, and win awards doing it. I should know.&quot;

In special education simplification of educational materials is called modification.

==Mass communications media==

In France, Michel Houellebecq has written (not excluding himself) of &quot;the shocking dumbing-down of French culture and intellect as was recently pointed out, [2008] sternly but fairly, by &quot;Time&quot; magazine&quot;.

==In popular culture==
The science fiction film &quot;Idiocracy&quot; (2006) portrays the U.S. as a greatly dumbed-down society 500 years in the future, in which low culture and philistinism were unintentionally achieved by eroding language and education coupled with dysgenics, where people of lower intelligence reproduced faster than the people of higher intelligence. Similar concepts appeared in earlier works, notably the science fiction short story &quot;The Marching Morons&quot; (1951), by Cyril M. Kornbluth which also features a modern-day protagonist in a future dominated by low-intelligence persons. Moreover, the novel &quot;Brave New World&quot; (1931), by Aldous Huxley, discussed the ways a utopian society was deliberately dumbed down in order to maintain political stability and social order by eliminating complex concepts unnecessary for society to function (e.g., the Savage tries reading Shakespeare to the masses and is not understood). More malevolent uses of dumbing down to preserve the social order are also portrayed in &quot;The Matrix&quot;, &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; and many dystopian movies.

The social critic Paul Fussell touched on these themes (&quot;prole drift&quot;) in his non-fiction book &quot;Class: A Guide Through the American Status System&quot; (1983) and focused on them specifically in &quot;BAD: or, The Dumbing of America&quot; (1991).

<text>Wanker is slang for &quot;one who wanks (masturbates)&quot;, but is most often used as a general insult. It is a pejorative term of English origin common in Britain and other parts of the English-speaking world (mainly Commonwealth of nations), including Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. It is synonymous with the insult &quot;&quot;.

==Meaning==

The terms &quot;wank&quot; and &quot;wanker&quot; originated in British slang during the late 19th and early 20th century. In modern usage, it is usually a general term of contempt rather than a commentary on sexual habits. &quot;Wanker&quot; has similar meanings and overtones to American pejoratives like &quot;jerk&quot; or &quot;jerk-off&quot;. More generally, &quot;wanker&quot; can carry suggestions of egotistical and self-indulgent behaviour and this is the dominant meaning in Australia and New Zealand.

&quot;Wanker&quot; may be indicated by a one-handed gesture, usually to an audience out of hearing range. It is performed by curling the fingers of the hand into a loose fist and moving the hand back and forth to mime male masturbation, which is equivalent to saying, &quot;that person is a wanker&quot;.

In the United States, the term is understood but rarely used.

Related are terms such as &quot;wanker&#x27;s colic&quot;, for an undiagnosed visceral pain, and &quot;wanker&#x27;s doom&quot;, for excessive masturbation, from slang used in the RAF and British prisons since the 1920s.

==Differences in perceived levels of offensiveness==
In December 2000, the Advertising Standards Authority published research on attitudes of the British public to pejoratives. It ranked &quot;wanker&quot; as the fourth most severe pejorative in English. The BBC describes it as &quot;moderately offensive&quot; and &quot;almost certain&quot; to generate complaints if used before the watershed.

In Australia, it is considered mildly offensive but is widely accepted and used in the media.

Mary Cresswell, an American etymologist, describes &quot;wanker&quot; as &quot;somewhat more offensive in British use than Americans typically realize&quot;. The word was used twice to comic effect in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Trash of the Titans&quot;, which caused no offence to American audiences, but prompted complaints on occasions when the episode was broadcast unedited in the United Kingdom.

==In popular culture==
&quot;The Winker&#x27;s Song (Misprint)&quot; by Ivor Biggun is one of many songs about masturbation. It describes the singer: &quot;I&#x27;m a wanker, I&#x27;m a wanker. And it does me good like it bloody well should&quot;, and it reached number 22 in the 1978 UK charts. It was banned by BBC Radio 1 and every national radio and television service.

Phil Collins used the word in his 1984 cameo appearance on &quot;Miami Vice&quot; and has sometimes been credited with introducing the word to America.

In the film &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot;, David St. Hubbins and Nigel Tufnel both use the word out of earshot to describe fellow rock star Duke Fame after a chance encounter.

On the American television show &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, Peggy Bundy&#x27;s maiden name is Wanker and her family is from the fictional Wanker County.

On the British television quiz show &quot;Countdown&quot;, contestants have to form the longest word possible from nine randomly selected letters. On one occasion, the letters permitted the spelling of &quot;wanker&quot; (or &quot;wankers&quot;) and both contestants replied with the word, leading one to quip &quot;we&#x27;ve got a pair of wankers&quot;. The sequence was edited out of the show (as is common with words), but has been shown as an outtake on other shows. However, on a later occasion, &quot;wanker&quot; was offered, and this instance was left in and broadcast unedited.

During the New Zealand national cricket team&#x27;s tours of Australia in the mid-1980s, Australian crowds extensively chanted &quot;Hadlee&#x27;s a wanker&quot; while New Zealand fast bowler Richard Hadlee was bowling, supported by hand-written banners. The reference even continued after Hadlee had retired, including a &quot;Hadlee&#x27;s a wanker&quot; banner appearing at an Australia v Croatia soccer game during the 2006 World Cup finals.

The comedy show &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot; featured a character named Mr. Wanker who was Mindy&#x27;s landlord. This was broadcast on American TV and later British TV.

Australian band TISM released an album in 1998 entitled &quot;www.tism.wanker.com&quot; (which was an active website for a few months after its release). One of the themes in its lyrics is breaking down male society into two distinct cultures: Yobs (the subject of the first single released from the album) and wankers. Its third single, &quot;Whatareya?&quot;, offers examples of differences between the types and tells the listener to decide which one he is.

Hard rock (formerly glam metal) band Vixen&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;Tangerine&quot; contains a hidden instrumental track titled &quot;Swatting Flies in Wanker County&quot;, written by then-member Gina Stile.

In February 2009, U2 member Bono called Chris Martin a wanker live on air during Jo Whiley&#x27;s Radio 1 show.

During a live radio debate on 28 May 2010, the future President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins, urged conservative American radio host Michael Graham to &quot;be proud to be a decent American rather than being just a wanker whipping up fear.&quot;

When acting as the ombudsman on &quot;Red Eye w/Greg Gutfeld&quot; in 2011, Mike Baker presented a graph of the &quot;wanker gap&quot; for the first half of the program. Baker has never given an explanation of the meaning of the &quot;wanker gap.&quot;

Jack Vance wrote a science fiction book entitled &quot;Servants of the Wankh&quot; in 1969. The title was changed to &quot;The Wannek&quot; due to its sounding like wanker.

Iron Maiden&#x27;s song &quot;El Dorado&quot; contains a veiled reference to the term in the line &quot;I&#x27;m a clever banker&#x27;s face, with just a letter out of place.&quot; In live performances, singer Bruce Dickinson would change to an explicit mention: &quot;I&#x27;m a clever wanker&#x27;s face, just a banker out of place.&quot;

In January 2015 the then Mayor of London Boris Johnson described British-born jihadists as &quot;pornography-obsessed inadequates who only turn to radical Islam when they fail to make it with girls...They are literally wankers&quot;.

Cockney Wanker is a long running character in &quot;Viz&quot;, based on a stereotypical male Cockney.

Inspired by controversy about The White Stripes&#x27; 2003 song &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; connected to Donald Trump&#x27;s 2016 presidential campaign, the British composer Ben Comeau wrote, in the style of J. S. Bach, a four-part fugue on the riff of that song to the words &quot;Donald Trump is a wanker.&quot;

<text>Yvonne Georgi (29 October 1903 – 25 January 1975) was a German dancer, choreographer and ballet mistress. She was known for her comedic talents and her extraordinary jumping ability. In her roles as a dancer, choreographer, and ballet mistress, she was an influential figure in dance for decades.

==Biography==

Georgi was born in Leipzig, Germany on 29 October 1903 to a French-Algerian mother and German father. She did not have any formal training in dance until she was seventeen and was &quot;discovered&quot; during a performance at a friend&#x27;s home. Though she had initially planned to study librarianship, she soon realized She went on to study at the Dalcroze Institute in Hellerau in 1920 and then the Wigman School in Dresden in 1921. Along with Gret Palucca and Hanya Holm, she was one of the best-known students of Mary Wigman and Robert Gergi.

Georgi debuted in Leipzig in 1923, touring as a soloist across Europe and North America. In 1924, she joined Münster, one of Kurt Jooss&#x27;s companies.

In 1925, Georgi began her career as a ballet mistress in Gera. While there, she choreographed her first ballets, including &quot;Saudades do Brazil&quot; to music by Darius Milhaud. These works quickly brought her notability.

From 1926 to 1931, Georgi was the ballet master for Staatsoper Hannover, and was one of the only choreographers to try to combine balletic and modern movement. Her first ballet evening &quot;Petrouchka&quot; and &quot;Pulcinella&quot; (1926), was highly successful, and the beginning of a long relationship with guest performer Harald Kreutzberg. Georgi and Kreutzberg performed as a duo across Germany and other countries, including a performance in New York in 1928. Their partnership ended with &quot;Le Train Bleu&quot; at the Berlin State Opera in 1931.

In 1931, Georgi founded what became the Ballets Yvonne Georgi in Amsterdam. In 1932, Georgi married Lodewijk Arntzenius, a Nazi sympathizer in Holland. From 1933 to 1935, Georgi served as the ballet director in Hanover and toured extensively. During this time, she began working with Henk Badings, who she continued to collaborate with throughout her career.

Georgi returned to the Netherlands during World War II. After the Nazis invaded Holland, Georgi ran the occupation government&#x27;s dance division until the war ended and she was forced to step down.

After the war, Georgi choreographed the film Ballerina in Paris. In 1951, she returned to Germany, where she directed the Abraxas Company and the Düsseldorf Opera Ballet. She then directed ballet in Hanover, and served as the director of the dance department at Hochschule für Musik, Theater und Medien Hannover until 1973.

Georgi had numerous première performances, among them the Electronic Ballet in 1957 to the music of Henk Badings. Her 1962 ballet &quot;Metamorphosen&quot; is considered one of the best German ballets of its time.

Georgi died in Hannover on January 25, 1975.

<doc id="533281" wikidata="Q3480151" url="?curid=533281" title="Interference theory">
<text>The interference theory is a theory regarding human memory. Interference occurs in learning. The notion is that memories encoded in long-term memory (LTM) are forgotten and cannot be retrieved into short-term memory (STM) because either memory could interfere with the other. There is an immense number of encoded memories within the storage of LTM. The challenge for memory retrieval is recalling the specific memory and working in the temporary workspace provided in STM. Retaining information regarding the relevant time of encoding memories into LTM influences interference strength. 
There are two types of interference effects: proactive and retroactive interference.

==History==
John A. Bergström is credited with conducting the first study regarding interference in 1892. His experiment was similar to the Stroop task and required subjects to sort two decks of cards with words into two piles. When the location was changed for the second pile, sorting was slower, demonstrating that the first set of sorting rules interfered with learning the new set. German psychologists continued in the field with Georg Elias Müller and Pilzecker in 1900 studying retroactive interference. To the confusion of Americans at a later date, Müller used &quot;associative Hemmung&quot; (inhibition) as a blanket term for retroactive and proactive inhibition.

The next major advancement came from American psychologist Benton J. Underwood in 1957. Underwood revisited the classic Ebbinghaus learning curve and found that most of the forgetting was due to interference from previously learned materials.

In 1924, John G. Jenkins and Karl Dallenbach showed that everyday experiences can interfere with memory, employing an experiment that showed that retention was better throughout sleep than over the same amount of time devoted to the activity. The United States again made headway in 1932 with John A. McGeoch suggesting that decay theory should be replaced by an interference theory. The most recent major paradigm shift came when Underwood proposed that proactive inhibition is more important or meaningful than retroactive inhibition in accounting for forgetting.

==Proactive interference==
Proactive interference is the interference of older memories with the retrieval of newer memories. Of the two effects of interference theory, proactive interference is the less common and less problematic type of interference compared to retroactive interference. Previously, it had been hypothesized that forgetting working memories would be nonexistent if not for proactive interference.

===Context===
Proactive interference build-up occurs with memories being learned in similar contexts. A common example is observing previous motor abilities from one skill interfering with a new set of motor abilities being learned in another skill from the initial. Proactive interference is also associated with poorer list discrimination, which occurs when participants are asked to judge whether an item has appeared on a previously learned list. If the items or pairs to be learned are conceptually related to one another, then proactive interference has a greater effect. Delos Wickens discovered that proactive interference build-up is released when there is a change to the category of items being learned, leading to increased processing in STM. Presenting new skills later in practice can considerably reduce proactive interference desirable for participants to have the best opportunity to encode fresh new memories into LTM.

=== Brain structures ===
The leading experimental technique for studying proactive interference in the brain is the “recent-probes” task. Initially, this is when participants must commit a set of items to memory. They then ask them to recall a specific item. Assessing them is shown by a probe. Thus, using recent-probes task and fMRIs, the brain mechanisms involved in resolving proactive interference identify as the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the left anterior prefrontal cortex.

=== Research ===

====With lists====
Researchers have studied the joint influence of proactive and retroactive interference using a list of items to be remembered. As expected, the recall was hampered by increasing the number of items in a given list. Proactive interference also affected learning when dealing with multiple lists. Researchers had participants learn a list of ten paired adjectives. The experimenters would consider a list to be learned if the participant could correctly recall eight of the ten items. After two days, participants could recall close to 70% of the items. However, those asked to memorize a new list the day after learning the first one had a recall of only 40%. Those who learned a third list recalled 25% of the items. Therefore, proactive interference affected the correct recall of the last list learned, because of the previous one, or two. In terms of forgetting, the effect of proactive interference was supported by further studies using different methods. The effect of proactive interference was reduced when the test was immediate and when the new target list was different from the previously learned lists.

==== Span performance ====
Span performance refers to working memory capacity. It is hypothesized that span performance is limited in language comprehension, problem-solving, and memory. Proactive Interference affects susceptibility to span performance limitations, as span performance in later experimental trials were worse than performance in earlier trials. With single tasks, proactive interference had less effect on participants with high working memory spans than those with low ones. With dual tasks, both types were similarly susceptible.

To differ, others have tried to investigate the relation of proactive interference when cued to forget. Turvey and Wittlinger designed an experiment to examine the effects of cues such as &quot;not to remember&quot; and &quot;not to recall&quot; with currently learned material. While &quot;not to remember&quot; had a significant effect in reducing proactive interference, cued to &quot;not to recall&quot; previously encoded and stored information did not significantly reduce the effect. Therefore, these associated cues do not directly control the potential effect of proactive interference on short-term memory span.

Proactive interference has shown an effect during the learning phase in terms of stimuli at the acquisition and retrieval stages with behavioral tasks for humans, as found by Castro, Ortega, and Matute. With 106 participants, they investigated two main questions: if two cues are learned as predictors of the same outcome (one after the other), would the second-cue outcome association be retarded? And secondly, once the second association is fully learned, will there still be an effect on subsequent trials? The research, as predicted, showed retardation and impairment in associations, due to the effect of Proactive Interference.

==Retroactive interference==
Retroactive interference, also known as &quot;Retroactive inhibition&quot;, is the interference of newer memories with the retrieval of older memories. In other words, subsequently learned memories directly contributes to the forgetting of previously learned memories. The effect of retroactive interference takes place when any type of skill has not been rehearsed over long periods. Of the two effects of interference theory, retroactive interference is considered the more common and more problematic type of interference compared to proactive interference.

RI is a classic paradigm that was first officially termed by Muller. These memory research pioneers demonstrated that filling the retention interval (defined as the amount of time that occurs between the initial learning stage and the memory recall stage) with tasks and material caused significant interference effects with the primary learned items.

As compared to proactive interference, retroactive interference may have larger effects because there is not only competition involved but also unlearning.

===Iconic research===

====Modified (free) recall====
Briggs&#x27;s (1954) study modeled McGeoch&#x27;s work on interference by setting the stage for a classic design of retroactive interference. In his study, participants were asked to learn 12 paired associates to a criterion of 100%. To ensure parsimony, these pairs can be labeled as A1-B1-, A2-B2-...A I -B I (also called AB/AC paradigm). Briggs used a &quot;modified free recall&quot; technique by asking participants to recall an item when cued with B I . Over multiple anticipation trials, participants learned B I items through the prompt of B I items. After perfecting A I - B I learning, participants were given a new list of paired associates to learn; however B I items were replaced with C I items (now given a list of A1-C1-, A2-C2-...A I -C I ). As the learning of A I -C I pairs increased, the learning of A I -B I pairs decreased. Eventually recalling the C I items exceeded the recall of the B I items, representing the phenomenon of retroactive interference.
A significant part of Briggs&#x27;s (1954) study was that once participants were tested after a delay of 24 hours the Bi responses spontaneously recovered and exceeded the recall of the Ci items. Briggs explained the spontaneous recovery illustration as an account of A I -B I items competing with A I -C I items or, as McGeoch would define it: &quot;a resultant [of] momentary dominance&quot;.

====Modified modified free recall====
J.M. Barnes and B.J. Underwood (1959) expanded Briggs&#x27;s (1954) study by implementing a similar procedure. The main difference in this study, however, was that, unlike Briggs&#x27;s (1954) &quot;modified free recall&quot; (MFR) task where participants gave one-item responses, Barnes and Underwood asked participants to give both List 1 and List 2 responses to each cued recall task. Participants’ ability to recall both items was termed the &quot;modified modified free recall&quot; (MMFR) technique. Equivocally to Briggs&#x27;s (1954) results, RI occurred when C I recalled responses gradually came to exceed B I responses. Barnes and Underwood argued that because there was &quot;unlimited recall time&quot; to produce multiple-item responses, the fact that A I -C I responses still trumped A I -B I responses represented an account of unlearning.

===Notable research concepts===

====Forgetting====
Since German psychologist H. Ebbinghaus (1885, 1913) made the first scientific studies on forgetting in the late nineteenth century, further research on the rate of forgetting presented information was found to be steep. While a variety of factors play a role in affecting the rate of forgetting, the general conclusion made is that 70% of originally recalled information is initially forgotten in 24 hours after a session of practice, followed by 80% of information forgotten within 48 hours. Afterwards, forgetting diminishes at a gradual rate, which leaves about 5% to 10% of retained information available for learners to access from practice until the next session. Despite the numbers, retroactive interference can be reduced significantly by implementing over-learning practice schedules, periodic refresh sessions when practicing skills, and skill rehearsal time for the inactive periods of practicing. Continuous skills are more resistant to the rate of forgetting compared to discrete skills, which indicates that the types of skills being practiced and retroactive interference significantly interact with one another.

===Theories===
The phenomenon of retroactive interference is highly significant in the study of memory as it has sparked a historical and ongoing debate in regards to whether the process of forgetting is due to the interference of other competing stimuli, or rather the unlearning of the forgotten material. The important conclusion one may gain from RI is that &quot;forgetting is not simply a failure or weakness of the memory system&quot; (Bjork, 1992), but rather an integral part of our stored knowledge repertoire. Although modern cognitive researchers continue to debate the actual causes of forgetting (e.g., competition vs. unlearning), retroactive interference implies a general understanding that additional underlying processes play a role in memory.

====Competition====
A standard explanation for the cause of RI is Competition. New associations compete with older associations and the more recent association would win out making it impossible to remember earlier associations. Spontaneous Recovery in MFR supports the claim of competition since after a rest period participants spontaneously remembered original pair associations that they were not able to remember right after the second test.

====Associative unlearning====
The associative unlearning hypothesis explains RI by saying that new associations replace the old associations in memory causing the participant to forget the initial associations. Barnes and Underwood argued that A I -C I responses still outnumber A I -B I responses after the delay period supports the Associative Unlearning Hypothesis over Competition.

===Brain structures===
Retroactive Interference has been localized to the left anterior ventral prefrontal cortex by magnetoencephalography (MEG) studies investigating Retroactive Interference and working memory in elderly adults. The study found that adults 55–67 years of age showed less magnetic activity in their prefrontal cortices than the control group. Executive control mechanisms are located in the frontal cortex and deficits in working memory show changes in the functioning of this brain area.

===Research===

====Pitch perception====
Retroactive Interference has also been investigated using pitch perception as the learning medium. The researcher found that the presentation of subsequent stimuli in succession causes a decrease in recalled accuracy. Massaro found that the presentation of successive auditory tones, confused perceptual short-term memory, causing Retroactive Interference as the new tone inhibits the retrieval of previously heard tones.

====Motor movement====
Wohldmann, Healey, and Bourne found that Retroactive Interference also affects the retention of motor movements. Researchers found that retroactive interference affects the performance of old motor movements when newly acquired motor movements are practiced. Physical practice of newly executed motor movements decreased the retention and recall of previously learned movements. Despite the retroactive interference noted by Wohldmann et al., researchers noted that mental practice decreased the amount of retroactive interference, suggesting that mental practice is more flexible and durable over time. This study of the superiority effect of physical practice is similar to the Word Superiority Effect made famous by Cattell.

====Word tasks====
Retroactive Interference increases when the items are similar, therefore increasing association between them as shown by spreading activation. Barnes and Underwood found that when participants in the experimental condition were presented with two similar word lists, the recollection of the first-word list decreased with the presentation of the second-word list. This finding contrasts the control condition as they had little Retroactive Inference when asked to recall the first-word list after a period of unrelated activity.

==Output interference==
Output Interference occurs when the initial act of recalling specific information interferes with the retrieval of the original information. An example scenario in which Output Interference might occur would be if one had created a list of items to purchase at a grocery store, but then, neglected to take the list when leaving home. The act of remembering a couple of items on that list decreases the probability of remembering the other items on that list.

===Research===

====Short-term memory====
Henry L. Roediger III and Schmidt found that the act of retrieval can serve as the source of the failure to remember, using multiple experiments that tested the recall of categorized and paired associative lists. Three experiments were carried out where subjects were first presented with category lists, and then, asked to recall the items in the list after being shown the category name as a cue. The further the test position from the category resulted in a decline of the recall of words. A fourth experiment revealed that only recent items were present in output interference in paired associative lists.


====Long-term memory====
Smith found that if categories with corresponding items were successfully recalled, a systematic decline would occur when recalling the items in a category across the output sequence. He conducted multiple experiments to determine the input conditioned necessary to produce Output Interference. In his first experiment word recall per category was greater at 60 sec than 30 sec when taking the last input category out to prevent recency effect. In his second experiment he changed the instructions, words used, and nature of the retention test, and showed with the recognition procedure, there was Output Interference but the effect was limited to the first three output positions. Even if retrieving items is necessary for a recall, it is not crucial to performance in a recognition tack. Recall of the organized information from long-term memory hurt the following item recalled. In long-term memory, Smith suggests that Output Interference has effects on extra-core material, which is represented as contextual information, rather than the core material, which is highly available as a result of organization.

====Effects of age====
In both short-term memory and long-term memory Smith measured output interference in three age groups (aged 20–39, 40–59, 60–80 years). The results of recall performance revealed significant differences due to age where the older group recalled fewer items than the middle group who recalled fewer items than the youngest group. Overall Smith concluded that memory decline appears with increased age with long-term memory forgetting rather than short-term memory forgetting and short-term memory was unaffected by age. However, output interference was unable to explain the memory deficit seen in older subjects.

Recent research of adults free recall and cognitive triage displayed similar findings of recall performance being poorer in older adults compared to younger adults. Although it was also indicated that older adults had an increased susceptibility to output interference compared to younger adults and the difference increased as additional items were recalled.

==Similar theories==

===Decay theory===
Decay theory outlines that memories weaken over time despite consolidation and storage. This is to say that although you remember a specific detail, over time you may have greater difficulty retrieving the detail you encoded. It has been suggested that the time interval between encoding and retrieval determines the accuracy of recall.

A practical example of decay theory is seen in the financial sector. If you open a bank account and do not deposit or withdraw money from the account, after some time, the bank will render the account dormant. The owner of the account, then, has to reopen the account for it to remain active. The bank account (the memory) is rendered dormant (the memory weakened) over time if there is no activity on the account (if the memory is not retrieved after some time).

====Similarities====
Decay theory is similar to interference theory in the way that old memories are lost over time. Memories are lost in Decay Theory by the passing of time. In Interference Theory, memories are lost due to newly acquired memories. Both Decay and Interference Theories are involved in psychological theories of forgetting.

====Differences====
Decay and interference theory differ in that Interference Theory has a second stimulus that impedes the retrieval of the first stimulus. Decay Theory is caused by time itself. Decay Theory is a passive method of forgetting as no interference is produced. Interference Theory is an active process because the act of learning new information directly impedes the recollection of previously stored information.

===Dual task interference===
Dual-task interference is a kind of interference that occurs when two tasks are attempted simultaneously. Harold Pashler wrote a paper summing up the theoretical approaches to dual-task interference. The basis of his research looked at when one attempts two or more tasks at the same time, why in some cases is one successful in completing their task and in other cases not.

====Capacity sharing====
Pashler proposed that the brain contains one mental entity where all tasks must be carried out. A real-life example of this could be going to the dentist; the only place to have cavities filled is at a dentist&#x27;s office. When the brain is attempting to complete two tasks, both tasks are present in the same mind area and compete for processing ability and speed. This relates to interference theory as the tasks compete. Interference theory says that the learning of new information decreases the retrieval of older information, and this is true for dual-task interference. The dominant task of the two inhibits the other task from completion. It is presumed that the dominant task would be a new task as a previously accomplished task would already be stored in memory. The new task would, then, be completed successfully as more mental effort is required to complete a novel task, and the previously completed task would not be completed as the new task dominated the mental capacity. Just as Interference Theory states, the completion of new tasks inhibits the completion of previously completed tasks due to capacity sharing.

====Cross talk models====
Cross-talk is the communication between sensory inputs, processing, and the thoughts of the individual. The theory is that if two processes are being activated, and they are not similar in any way (making cookies and going on vacation), the brain will be confused as separate cognitive areas are being activated, and there is conflicting communication between the two. Contrastingly, if the two processes are similar (making cookies and pouring milk), there will be less crosstalk and more productive and uninterrupted cognitive processing.

Crosstalk is used by engineers to discuss the degradation of communication channels due to context dependence.

Navon and Miller claim that Dual-Task Interference is caused by an outcome conflict, which is a result of one task producing, &quot;outputs, throughputs, or side effects that are harmful to the processing of the [other task]&quot;. This is the concept of Interference Theory. The thoughts, outputs, and side effects of one task either affect the previous or subsequent recall.

==Neurobiology==
===Event-related fMRI studies===
====Stroop and Simon task====
The performance of Stroop and Simon tasks were monitored on 10 healthy young adults using magnetic resonance image (MRI) scanning. Functional images were acquired at specific time intervals during each subject&#x27;s scan. Brain activation during the Stroop and Simon task was remarkably similar including anterior cingulate, supplementary motor cortex, visual association cortex, inferior temporal cortex, inferior parietal cortex, inferior frontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and caudate nuclei. Interference effects in the Stroop and Simon tasks activate similar brain regions at similar time distributions.

==Application ==

===Advertising===
It has been demonstrated that recall will be lower when consumers have afterward seen an ad for a competing brand in the same product class. Exposure to later similar advertisements does not cause interference for consumers when brands are rated on purchasing likelihood. This shows that information processing objective can moderate the effects of interference of competitive advertising. Competitive brand advertising not only interferes with consumer recall of advertising in the past but also interferes with learning new distinctive brand information in the future.

====Reducing competitive ad interference====
Repetition improves brand name recall when presented alone. When competitive advertising was presented, it was shown that repetition provided no improvement in brand name recall over a single exposure. The competitive ads interfered with the added learning from repetition. However, when the target brand name was shown using varying ad executions interference was reduced. Presenting ads in multi-modalities (visual, auditory) will reduce possible interference because there are more associations or paths to cue recall than if only one modality had been used. This is the principle of multimedia learning. Also, interference is increased when competing ads are presented in the same modality. Therefore, by presenting ads in multiple modalities, the chance that the target brand has unique cues is increased.

<doc id="533285" wikidata="Q5168657" url="?curid=533285" title="Copp's Hill">
<text>Copp&#x27;s Hill is an elevation in the historic North End of Boston, Massachusetts. It is bordered by Hull Street, Charter Street and Snow Hill Street. The hill takes its name from William Copp, a shoemaker who lived nearby. Copp&#x27;s Hill Burying Ground is a stop on the Freedom Trail.

==Early history==
Like all of the Shawmut Peninsula, the hill was Algonquian territory before the establishment of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The first English settlers to the hill arrived in the 1630s and built a windmill atop the hill to grind grain.

==Copp&#x27;s Hill Burying Ground==
Founded by the town of Boston in 1659, Copp&#x27;s Hill Burying Ground is the second oldest burying ground in the city. The cemetery&#x27;s boundaries were extended several times, and the grounds contain the remains of many notable Bostonians in the thousands of graves and 272 tombs.

Among the Bostonians buried here are the original owner, William Copp, his children, Increase Mather, Cotton Mather, Robert Newman, John Pulling, (the patriots who placed the signal lanterns in the steeple of Old North Church for Paul Revere&#x27;s midnight ride to Lexington and Concord), Prince Hall (the father of Black Freemasonry), and many unmarked graves of the African Americans who lived in the &quot;New Guinea&quot; community at the foot of the hill. The cemetery was not an official stop on the Freedom Trail when it was created in 1951, but it has since been added and is much-frequented by tourists and photographers.

==Revolutionary War==
During the Revolutionary War, the British used the hill to train artillery onto Charlestown during the Battle of Bunker Hill. For several years starting in 1806, soil was taken from the top of Copp&#x27;s Hill to increase the available building land by filling the Mill Pond. This removal reduced the height of the hill by about 7 feet (about 2 meters).

==Skinny House==
Across Hull street from the Copp&#x27;s Hill Burying Ground is an extremely narrow four-story spite house built shortly after the Civil War. Only wide at its widest point, the house is reported by the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; as having the &quot;uncontested distinction of being the narrowest house in Boston.&quot;

==The vista==
Copp&#x27;s Hill is the highest point in the North End and is the third highest hill in Boston after Beacon Hill and Fort Hill. As such, Copp&#x27;s Hill provides a view of numerous local landmarks. The Old North Church stands at one end of Hull Street. In the opposite direction, the Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge and the TD Garden are visible not far away. Over local rooftops the upper levels of Custom House Tower, One International Place, and other buildings in the Financial District can be glimpsed. Beyond the other side of the hill, across the Charles River in Charlestown, the &quot;USS Constitution&quot; and the &quot;USS Cassin Young&quot; may be seen docked at Boston Navy Yard with the Bunker Hill Monument in the distance.

<doc id="533287" wikidata="Q927511" url="?curid=533287" title="Morlocks (comics)">
<text>Morlocks are a group of mutant characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The characters are usually depicted as being associated with the X-Men in the Marvel Universe. Created by writer Chris Claremont and artist Paul Smith, they were named after the subterranean race of the same name in H. G. Wells&#x27; novel &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, but unlike in the Wells book, they are not a faceless, threatening mass of villains. They first appeared as a group in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #169 (May 1983). Caliban appeared prior to that, but he was not yet a member of the Morlocks.

The Morlocks were depicted as an underground society (both literally and figuratively) of outcast mutants living as tunnel dwellers in the sewers, abandoned tunnels, and abandoned subway lines beneath New York City. The Morlocks were composed of mutant misfits, especially those mutants who, because of physical mutations or other conspicuous manifestations of their mutant genetics, were unable to pass as human in normal society. Subjected to hate, fear, and disgust from human society due to their &quot;deformed&quot; appearances, dangerous mutations, or otherwise outcast or misfit statuses, most of the Morlocks viewed humans (and even other more mainstream mutants such as the X-Men) with distrust and anger, and they occasionally committed criminal or antisocial acts upon the above-ground human society.

Due to a series of tragedies, the original Morlocks no longer reside in subterranean New York City (except Marrow, who was one of the original Morlocks as a child), although a violent splinter cell Gene Nation and a comparable group called Those Who Live in Darkness have emerged. Similar groups, called Morlocks by readers and the X-Men themselves, have appeared under Chicago and London.

==Fictional group history==
According to Callisto, she formed the Morlocks by first recruiting Caliban. She then used his power to track down other mutants who were unable to integrate into normal society. The Morlocks initially squatted in a network of abandoned, interconnected tunnels beneath Manhattan, which had originally been built as Cold War bomb shelters and then forgotten, before expanding into sewers and abandoned subways. The Morlocks occasionally emerged to rob humans in Manhattan and would sometimes kidnap certain mutant children.

The X-Men were alerted to the existence of the Morlocks when their leader Callisto kidnapped Angel and intended to make him her mate. This brought Storm to challenge Callisto to a duel for leadership of the Morlocks. Victorious, Storm orders an end to their attacks on normal humans, but she does not assume leadership of the Morlocks full-time. Against her wishes, several Morlocks later kidnap the child superheroes Power Pack so that they could be raised by the Morlock Annalee, who had lost her own children. When Callisto discovers what was going on, she forces Annalee to let them go. They promise to return in the future to keep her company.

A majority of the Morlocks are killed by Mister Sinister&#x27;s Marauders in the &quot;Mutant Massacre&quot;. Most of the survivors join Gene Nation, having lived in a pocket dimension led by Mikhail Rasputin. Leech instead becomes a ward of Generation X. Other survivors include Erg and Beautiful Dreamer (whose whereabouts were unknown until &quot;Decimation&quot;), Thornn, (who would join X-Corporation), and Caliban.

It is later revealed that some of the Morlocks were failed experiments of the Dark Beast, although he made certain that they did not remember being tampered with; however, Mister Sinister recognized that some of the Morlocks were based on his own genetic studies (which the Dark Beast learned from the Sinister of his reality) and subsequently ordered the Marauders to kill the entire underground society.

A new group called the Tunnel Rats which also calls itself &quot;Those Who Live in Darkness&quot; have inhabited the sewer tunnels just below the surface of Mutant Town/District X. &quot;District X&quot; writer David Hine claims to never have intended this group to have any ties to the original Morlocks.

During the &quot;Decimation&quot; storyline, some of the remaining powered Morlocks sought out asylum at the X-Mansion. There were some Morlocks that remained underground under Marrow&#x27;s protection.

During the &quot;Endangered Species&quot; storyline, Masque and the Morlocks with him began their search for Magneto where they had some future-telling diaries with them where one of them states that Magneto is still a mutant in light of M-Day.

At the time when the Terrigen Cloud was loose on Earth infecting mutants with M-Pox since the &quot;Infinity&quot; storyline, the number of mutants that are living underground had increased. In addition to these mutants, Callisto showed sympathy towards the humans who sought out refuge from the global landscape. As a way to live out the dream of Professor X, this unified society of humans and mutants lived together as the New Morlocks. The Morlock are further decimated by the Mauraders, but Cyclops helps the Chechnyan government expel rebels in exchange for a Morlock sanctuary.

When Krakoa was established as a mutant paradise, the known Morlocks that reside there are Callisto, Caliban, Cybelle, Erg, a revived Healer, Leech, Masque, Marrow, Mole, a revived Piper, Skids, and a revived Tommy.

===Mutant Massacre===
The &quot;Mutant Massacre&quot; was one of Marvel&#x27;s annual crossovers events, centering on the Morlocks. The event resulted in the Marauders killing many of the Morlocks under orders of Mr. Sinister. Only a few survived, with the protection of the X-Men, X-Factor, Power Pack and Thor. The event spanned &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #210–212, &quot;X-Factor&quot; #9–11, &quot;The New Mutants&quot; #46, &quot;Thor&quot; #373–374 and &quot;Power Pack&quot; #27. Many new Morlocks debuted, although many were killed in their first appearance.

* Berzerker - An electric mutant who was formerly part of Masque&#x27;s splinter group, The Tunnelers. Killed by electrocuting himself with his own powers.

It was later revealed that this was Gambit&#x27;s doing. She resurfaced years later as one of the many resurrected mutants on Krakoa.
* Zeek - Killed by Harpoon.

===Post-Mutant Massacre===
Most of the surviving Morlocks relocated themselves throughout New York City after the massacre. Few, however, returned to the Alley, their original home. There, Masque assumed leadership. Many new surviving Morlocks were introduced when Sabretooth decided to finish his original task. He is stopped by a newly &quot;upgraded&quot; Caliban. Later, a splinter group of the Morlocks is introduced. This group, led by Pixie, attempts to escape Masque.

* Alex - Alex is an amorphous, blob-like creature, able to engulf and smother others. Current whereabouts and status unknown.

* Hump - Brute&#x27;s brother with a similar appearance and super-strength. Current whereabouts and status unknown.
* Lightning Bug - Killed in the &quot;Mutant Massacre&quot;. Astral essence survived and searches out a new form to inhabit. Its essence later perished.

* Thornn - Left the Morlocks after the Great Flood. Depowered as a result of &quot;Decimation&quot;, but she regained her physical mutation.

===The Hill===
With Masque presumed killed, an insane Mikhail Rasputin takes over as leader of the Morlocks in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #293. He floods the tunnels, attempting to destroy the remaining Morlocks. It is revealed later that he actually transported the Morlocks to another dimension dubbed the Hill, whose timeline moved faster than the main Marvel Universe. There, he set himself up as their king and forced them to fight for the right to live.

* Brain Cell - A mutant with telepathy. Current whereabouts and status unknown.
* Marilou - Killed by Mikhail Rasputin who also destroyed her face.

* MeMe - Mind shut down by Jean Grey to rescue humans he absorbed with his lifeform fusion ability.
* Monte - A mutant with bio-electric blasts. Current whereabouts and status unknown.
* Mikhail Rasputin - Former leader of the Morlocks. Transported them to the Hill dimension. Banished himself to Kapalan.
* Sack - A mutant with possession ability.

===Africa/Gene Nation===
With the Morlocks presumed dead from the floods caused by Mikhail Rasputin, some of the remaining Morlocks were relocated to Selima Oasis in North Africa. When attacked by Humanity&#x27;s Last Stand, an emotional backlash caused D&#x27;Gard to assume control over Storm, who relinquished her leadership role. In &quot;X-Men: Prime&quot; many of the Hill Morlocks returned to found Gene Nation. As the new group, they attacked the human oppressors of the past Morlocks under the leadership of Marrow. It is unknown whether the remaining Morlocks of Africa stayed there or relocated to New York. A few have been seen there since, as well as a few Morlocks who chose to remain in New York City despite previous attempts on their lives.

* Boost - One of the surviving Morlocks with power amplification abilities. Helped the Brotherhood of Mutants escape in exchange for being relocated to North Africa. Depowered.
* Carver - Leader of a splinter group of five Morlocks with super-strength and osteokinesis. He survived the Massacre and the Flood and who still followed the old Morlock rules.
* D&#x27;Gard - An empathic mutant who became leader of the Morlocks while in North Africa when he made Storm relinquish her leadership. Killed by Marrow as a sign of loyalty to the new Weapon X program

* Soteira - A mutant with unrevealed powers. Revealed to be around at the time Storm became Morlock leader. Was the scientist that put Revelation in suspended animation. Appeared as a hologram telling the Wolverine Skrull and the Punisher she will die as a result of prolonged exposure to Revelation&#x27;s powers.

===After M-Day===
After M-Day, some former Morlocks who lost their powers were Angel Dust, Boost, Callisto, Delphi, Irving, Marrow, Postman, Qwerty, Shatter, Tether and the probability of Feral and Thornn. However, Feral and Thornn were later seen re-powered; but this was later to be revealed in &quot;Wolverine&quot; vol. 3 #54-55 that only their physical mutations were restored, not their mutant powers, which led to Feral being killed by Sabretooth.

In one of Generation M&#x27;s &quot;Ex-Mutants&#x27; Diaries&quot;, Sally interviews Marrow about the Morlocks. Marrow reports that 80% of the remaining Morlocks (which was most likely already very small) are depowered now and look like humans. She states that most of them are still afraid about going out of the tunnels.

Currently, Marrow works as a watchman of the Morlocks, as she is called by the remaining ones when problems occur. She explained this status in the aftermath of thirteen depowered Morlocks murdered by Ghoul.

One character commented that, post-M-Day, the chance of meeting a Morlock in the tunnels under New York is now harder than meeting an alligator in the Floridian sewers.

Some former Morlocks who actually kept their powers sought refuge at Xavier&#x27;s Institute and became known as the 198. They are Beautiful Dreamer, Caliban, Erg, Leech, and Skids.

Dark Beast and Mikhail Rasputin are also still powered, though Mikhail is in Kapalan.

===The Extremists===
During Ed Brubaker&#x27;s &quot;The Extremists&quot; arc, the Morlocks reappear under the leadership of Masque and now consisting of Bliss, Erg, Litterbug, Skids and a recently captured Leech. Later in this story, it was revealed Skids only joined the Morlocks to spy on them on behalf of S.H.I.E.L.D.

==Other groups==
There are other groups that are related to the main Morlocks group:

===Chicago Morlocks===
In June 2002, Marvel released a four-part limited series, &quot;Morlocks&quot;. In it, a small group of mutants living in the sewers of Chicago help each other to fulfill their one last wish on the surface while trying to escape the mutant-hunting Sentinels.
* Angel Dust - She ran away from home upon discovering she was a mutant, to protect her family from possible Sentinel attacks. Adrenaline gives her bursts of super-strength. Confirmed to be depowered by S.H.I.E.L.D.

===London Tunnel Dwellers===
In &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #397–398, parts 3 and 4 of the &quot;Poptopia&quot; story, a group of Morlocks living in the tunnels of London are introduced. They were being pursued by an agent of the Church of Humanity named Mr. Clean, a genetically engineered human who was stalking and killing mutants. This was their only appearance. It is unknown whether or not they survived the persecution of the Church of Humanity.

* Burning Puddle - Son of Miss Saccharine. Sweats acid. Current whereabouts and status unknown.
* Carla - A mole-like woman. Current whereabouts and status unknown.

* Harmony - Mother of Hope who has gills. Current whereabouts and status unknown.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the 10th anniversary of the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; event, which takes place after the nuclear attack in &quot;X-Men: Omega&quot;, several characters who were not in the original storyline are introduced, among them are the Morlocks which includes Feral, Leech, Marrow, Skids and Thornn among many other unnamed mutants.

The Morlocks were largely a peaceful group who refused to follow Apocalypse&#x27;s regime and for that decision they were all captured and imprisoned in the Breeding Pens for gruesome experiments by Sinister and the Beast. One known Morlock member was Artemis.

After the fall of Apocalypse, a trail of escaped mutants from the Breeding Pens lead the X-Men underground, they encountered a group of scared, orphaned children called the Morlocks. The X-Men offered to help bring them out of hiding in the sewers, but the Morlocks lashed out at them for fear of being locked up and thrown back into cages by the X-Men, now mutant-hunting officers of the newly restored human government. The X-Men emerged victorious and the Morlocks were brought back to the Xavier Institute where they were detained.

===Ultimate Marvel===
The Morlocks in the &quot;Ultimate Marvel&quot; universe have a more sophisticated underground living situation than the mainstream Morlocks, including at least one mutant with energy-generating powers to provide electricity, hydroponic gardens to provide or supplement their food supply, and external air-exchange vents.

In Ultimate X-Men #80 Nightcrawler saves the Morlock named Pyro, who was outnumbered while fighting the Friends of Humanity and the police. Other members shown as of issue #82 are Caliban, Callisto, Sparks and Sunder (who was the leader). After a fight with the X-Men (who were trying to rescue Toad), the Morlocks elected Nightcrawler as their new leader. In #90 Mister Sinister finishes his 10 mutant kills at the Morlock base. His kills include Leech and Angel.

==In other media==

In their most notable appearance in &quot;Captive Hearts&quot;, the Morlocks capture Jean Grey and Cyclops before Storm rescues the pair and defeats Callisto while doing so, gaining leadership of the Morlocks. Storm eventually returns leadership of the Morlocks to Callisto in &quot;Have Yourself a Morlock Little X-Mas&quot;.

<text>Henk Badings (hĕngk bä&#x27;dĭngz) (17 January 190726 June 1987) was an Indonesian-Dutch composer.

==Early life==
Born in Bandung, Java, Dutch East Indies, as the son of Herman Louis Johan Badings, an officer in the Dutch East Indies army, Hendrik Herman Badings became an orphan at 7 years old. Having returned to the Netherlands in 1915, Badings took up violin and piano, however was dissuaded by his guardians from creating a career in music. Badings enrolled at the Delft Polytechnical Institute (later the Technical University), graduating in 1931. He worked as a mining engineer and palaeontologist at Delft until 1937, after which he dedicated his life entirely to music. Though largely self-taught, he became a pupil of Willem Pijper, the doyen of Dutch composers at the time, but their musical views differed widely and after Pijper had attempted to discourage Badings from continuing as a composer, Badings broke off contact.

==Music career==
In 1930 Badings had his initial big musical success when his first cello concerto (he eventually wrote a second) was performed at the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam. Champions of his work included such eminent conductors as Eduard van Beinum and Willem Mengelberg. He held numerous teaching positions; e.g., at the Musikhochschule Stuttgart and the University of Utrecht. Accused after the Second World War of collaboration with the Nazi occupation forces, in April 5, 1942 he was briefly cancelled from professional musical activity, but by June 3, 1947 he had been reinstated.

Badings used unusual musical scales and harmonies (e.g., the octatonic scale); he also used the harmonic series scale from the eighth to the fifteenth overtone. An exceptionally prolific artist, he had produced over a thousand pieces at the time of his death in Maarheeze in 1987.

Compositions by Badings include fifteen numbered symphonies, at least four string quartets, several concertos, other orchestral works including a &quot;Symphonietta : speelmuziek voor klein symphonie-orkest&quot;, other chamber music works, piano works, and incidental music.

In the 21st century, interest in Badings&#x27; music has grown. The German label CPO has committed itself to recording Badings&#x27; entire orchestral œuvre, and a Badings Festival was held in Rotterdam during October 2007.

<text>Operation Herkules (; ) was the German code-name given to an abortive plan for the invasion of Malta during the Second World War. Through air and sea landings, the Italians and Germans hoped to eliminate Malta as a British air and naval base and secure an uninterrupted flow of supplies across the Mediterranean Sea to Axis forces in Libya and Egypt.

Extensive preparations were made for the invasion but the success of other Axis operations – including the Battle of Gazala (26 May to 21 June 1942), the Axis capture of Tobruk on 21 June and Operation Aïda, the pursuit of the Allies into Egypt – led to Herkules being postponed and then cancelled in November 1942.

==Origins==
The Axis plan to invade Malta had its origin in Italian military studies conducted during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War in the mid-1930s. By 1938, &quot;Comando Supremo&quot;, the Italian army general staff, had estimated the amount of sea transport it would require to move military forces into North Africa, and identified the seizure of Malta as a prerequisite. An outline plan for a seaborne assault was drawn up and periodically revised; the &quot;Regia Marina&quot; initially showed little interest in it. The concept of an invasion was approved at a meeting between Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini from 29 to 30 April 1942.

==Axis plans and preparations==

===Airborne forces===

Command of the airborne component of &quot;Herkules&quot; was given to &quot;Generalmajor&quot; Kurt Student and &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; XI. Student had commanded the German airborne assault in the Battle of Crete in May 1941. This time, Student had months to prepare and learn from the mistakes made on Crete. Knowledge of British defensive positions on Malta was extensive, thanks to meticulous aerial mapping by the Italians. Every fortification, artillery emplacement and AA battery was carefully scrutinised. Student claimed later that &quot;We even knew the calibre of the coastal guns, and how many degrees they could be turned inland&quot;. Ten &quot;Gruppen&quot; of Junkers Ju 52 transports, with 500 aircraft, were allocated for the air landings, along with 300 DFS 230 gliders (carrying ten men each) and 200 larger Go 242 gliders (each carrying twenty-three men or a light vehicle/gun). Also to be included were two dozen Messerschmitt Me 321 &quot;Gigant&quot; gliders capable of carrying up to 200 fully equipped paratroopers or a tank. These were to be towed by new He 111Z (&quot;Zwilling&quot;) five-engined versions of the He 111 medium bomber.
The &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; would contribute 180 to 220 transport aircraft, mostly three-engined SM.75s (carrying 24–28 men each), SM.81s (12–14 men each) and SM.82s (30–34 men each). Given the distance between Axis airfields on Sicily and the dropping zones over Malta, it was possible for the transport aircraft to make four round trips per day. The aircraft were to drop an Italian and a German airborne division onto the southern side of the island. The paratroopers had to secure the high ground behind the invasion beaches and seize a nearby airfield for Axis transport aircraft to land another division and supplies. Airborne units for the invasion comprised the German &quot;Fliegerdivision 7&quot; (11,000 men), the Italian 185th Infantry Division &quot;Folgore&quot; (7,500 men) and the airlanding 80th Infantry Division &quot;La Spezia&quot; (10,500 men), about 29,000 airborne troops. Preparations for the airborne assault included construction of three glider strips south of Mount Etna on Sicily.

===Amphibious forces===

The seaborne assault force comprised 70,000 Italian troops who were to make amphibious landings at two points on the south-eastern side of the island, in Marsaxlokk bay, the main effort falling upon a site named &quot;Famagosta beach&quot; and a smaller secondary landing at &quot;Larnaca beach&quot;. Also to be seized were the lesser islands of Gozo and Comino. Amphibious feints would be directed at St. Paul&#x27;s Bay, Mellieħa Bay and north-west of Valletta near the old Victoria Lines, to draw British attention away from the real landing sites. The main assault convoy was scheduled to begin landing on Malta just before midnight on the first day, after the airborne forces had landed in the afternoon and secured the heights above the beaches. The bulk of the first-wave assault troops would come from the 20th Infantry Division &quot;Friuli&quot; (10,000 men) and the 4th Infantry Division &quot;Livorno&quot; (9,850 men) of the Italian XXX Corps. Also included were 1,200 men from the 1st Assault Battalion and &quot;Loreto&quot; Battalion (both drawn from the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot;) two battalions of &quot;San Marco&quot; Marines (2,000 men) three battalions of Blackshirts (1,900 men General Santi Quasimodo) and 300 (a commando unit of San Marco Marines specially trained in ocean swimming and beach assault).
A follow-up convoy would be mainly made up of troops from the Italian XVI Corps: the 26th Infantry Division &quot;Assietta&quot; (9,000 men), the 54th Infantry Division &quot;Napoli&quot; (8,900 men), artillery units (3,200 men) and the remainder of the 10th Armoured Regiment (3,800 men). The 1st Infantry Division &quot;Superga&quot; (9,200 men) plus a battalion of Blackshirts and 1,000 &quot;San Marco&quot; Marines were to be in position to land on the smaller island of Gozo in the early hours of the second day.

Armoured support for the invasion comprised sixty-four Italian Semovente 47/32 and eight heavier Semovente 75/18 self-propelled guns plus thirty L3 tankettes (comparable in size and armament to the British Bren Gun Carrier). Additional armour intended for &quot;Herkules&quot; included &quot;2.Kompanie/Panzerabteilung z.b.V.66&quot; (&quot;zur besonderen Verwendung&quot; [for special use]), a German unit commanded by Hans Bethke and partly equipped with captured Russian tanks. Ten assorted KV-1 [] and KV-2 [] heavy tanks were available. At least ten Italian &quot;motozattere&quot; (landing craft) were modified with reinforced flooring and internal ramps to carry these vehicles. Other tanks in the unit included captured Russian T-34 medium tanks, up-armoured German light tanks (five VK 1601s and five VK 1801s) plus twelve German Panzer IVGs armed with guns. Twenty German Panzer III tanks were also offered for use in the invasion but it is not known what unit these were to be drawn from. Plans to use the captured Russian tanks were at some point abandoned and all armour transported to Malta was to be Italian only. Two days were allowed for the amphibious assault and landing of the follow-up convoy, though this was dependent on quickly securing Marsaxlokk Bay to land heavier artillery pieces and a much higher tonnage of supplies.

===Landing craft===

Lacking enough landing craft for an amphibious assault, the &quot;Regia Marina&quot; secured plans from the German &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; to build copies of the &quot;Marinefährprahm&quot; Type A (MFP) in Italian shipyards. These shallow-draught vessels, were capable of transporting up to 200 equipped infantry, 2–3 medium tanks or an equivalent weight in cargo and could unload onto an open beach via a drop-down bow ramp. Sixty-five of these &quot;motozattere&quot; (MZs) were completed by July 1942 and about fifty were available for the invasion. Twenty German MFPs were transferred to the Mediterranean via the river Rhone to make up for an expected shortfall of Italian-built landing craft.

German-operated landing craft were sent to Italy via rail for the invasion, including twelve Siebel ferries (catamaran rafts powered by automobile engines driving water screws and armed with and flak guns), six Type 39 (carrying of cargo, two light vehicles or 45 infantry, unloaded via clamshell doors at the bow), six Type 40 (a larger version of the Type 39, carrying of cargo, three or four light vehicles or 80–90 fully equipped infantry), a company of eighty-one (Type 39 Stormboats, small plywood boats carrying up to six infantrymen and powered by outboard motors) plus an assortment of large inflatable rafts (carrying 25 troops each). Some rafts were powered by outboard motors and others had to be rowed.

The Italians assembled a collection of other naval craft to transport the amphibious forces. These included two former Strait of Messina railway ferries (converted to carry four to eight tanks each); ten passenger ships (800–1,400 men each), six former passenger ferries (400 men each), six cargo ships ( of supplies each), 30 ex-trawlers (300 men each); five converted minelayers (500 men each) and 74 assorted motorboats (30–75 men each). The Italians also requested the use of 200 additional German to quickly transfer men from ship to shore. The Italian landing flotilla and the supporting ships formed the Special Naval Force ( Admiral Vittorio Tur).

Specialised landing equipment for &quot;Herkules&quot; included the (Sea Snake), a floating ship-to-shore bridge originally developed by the German Army for Operation Sea Lion. It was formed from a series of joined modules that could be towed into place and act as a temporary jetty. Moored ships could then unload their cargo either directly onto the &quot;roadway&quot; or lower it down onto the via their cranes. The had been tested by the Army Training Unit at Le Havre in the fall of 1941 and was easily transportable by rail.

===Naval escort===
The &quot;Regia Marina&quot; had to protect the invasion convoys from attacks by the British Mediterranean Fleet and provide gunfire support during the landings. The force assigned to accomplish this included four battleships (&quot;Littorio&quot;, &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot;, &quot;Duilio&quot;, and &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;), four heavy cruisers, eight light cruisers and 21 destroyers. These ships would assemble and sortie from the ports of Messina, Reggio Calabria, Augusta and Cagliari. The two older &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;-class battleships would carry approximately 200 rounds each for shore bombardment. Italian and German submarines were to scout for and intercept British naval forces attempting to interfere with the seaborne landings. One submarine was to be stationed midway between Sicily and Malta, to act as a guide beacon for the transport aircraft on their way to and from the drop zones.

The Italians were confident they could defeat any daylight incursions by the Mediterranean Fleet, especially given the &quot;Luftwaffe&#x27;s&quot; ability to dominate the daytime skies, but there were concerns the Italian fleet would face serious difficulties if the British attacked at night. Lacking ship-borne radar and having neglected night-fighting training and equipment, the &quot;Regia Marina&quot; had been defeated at the Battle of Cape Matapan in March 1941. A similar encounter off Malta might wreak havoc on the slow-moving Axis invasion convoys, leaving the airborne forces cut off and imperilling Axis chances of taking the island.
The &quot;Regia Marina&quot; had made some efforts to rectify this situation by equipping the battleship &quot;Littorio&quot; with an experimental E.C.-3/bis &quot;Gufo&quot; (Owl) radar apparatus in August 1941, but the unit was considered unreliable (not until September 1942 did &quot;Littorio&quot; receive a standardised production-version &quot;Gufo&quot; with better performance; this set could detect surface ships at a range of and aircraft out to a range of ). In September 1941, while awaiting production of Italian-made radar units in quantity, the &quot;Regia Marina&quot; requested from the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; a &quot;FuMO&quot; 24/40 &quot;G DeTe&quot; unit for the new destroyer, &quot;Legionario&quot; (under construction). &quot;DeTe&quot; units could detect surface ships up to away. By March 1942, the set had been delivered and installed and a small group of Italian ratings had been trained in Germany on its use. Operational testing began that spring and by May, the fleet commander Vice-Admiral Angelo Iachino had submitted a report praising its performance.

==Maltese defences==

In 1942 the garrison of Malta consisted of 15 infantry battalions (11 Commonwealth, 4 Maltese) organised into four brigades totalling 26,000 men. Tank support was provided by the 1st Independent Troop of the Royal Tank Regiment, disembarked in November 1940, which was initially equipped with four Matilda II Infantry Tanks, armed with 2-pounder (40 mm) guns, and two Vickers Mk.VIC light tanks, armed with two machine guns (part of detachments from the 7th Royal Tank Regiment and the 3rd The King&#x27;s Own Hussars). These were reinforced in January 1942 by four Cruiser Mk I and three Cruiser Mk IV tanks and a Vickers Mk.VIC light tank, with the cruisers armed with 2-pounder (40 mm) guns (part of a detachment from the 6th Royal Tank Regiment).

Artillery support came from the 12th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery with twenty-four 25-pounder [] field guns, capable of providing fire support out to a range of and covering most of the island while remaining in protected static positions. Malta&#x27;s fixed defences included nineteen heavy coastal guns (varying in size from 12-inch to 16-inch, although these Victorian era weapons were all decommissioned), 130 smaller coastal guns (6-pounder to 9.2-inch) and 112 heavy and 144 light anti-aircraft guns.

The smaller coastal guns comprised&lt;br&gt;

* QF gun Mk II, on Mounting Mk I
* 18 × QF 6 pounder 10 cwt gun (9 × 2)
* ~30 × Ordnance QF 18 pounder

==Aftermath==
A date near mid-July 1942 was set for the invasion, partly to allow time to bring troops from other front line positions. Field Marshal Erwin Rommel supported the Malta plan and asked Hitler for command of the invasion forces. His reasons for supporting an invasion were to hinder the Allied troops fighting in Africa, as well as to remove the threat to the convoys heading to Italian-German forces with supplies, oil and men, all of which they lacked. He prioritised the attack to such an extent that he was willing to move units from his front for the attack. The head of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, Hermann Göring, opposed the invasion, fearing it would turn into another near-disaster for his paratroops, as had happened in the airborne assault on Crete. &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Albert Kesselring tirelessly promoted but even he was eventually dissuaded when it became apparent that too many air and ground units had been siphoned off to support the Axis drive into Egypt, diminishing any chance of success. With Hitler lacking faith in the parachute divisions after Crete and in the ability of the Italian navy to protect the invasion fleet from British naval attacks, the plan was cancelled.

<text>HMS &quot;Superb&quot; was a nuclear-powered fleet submarine of the serving in the Royal Navy.

&quot;HMS Superb&quot; was built by Vickers Shipbuilding Group, now a division of BAE Systems Submarine Solutions. &quot;Superb&quot; was launched on 30 November 1974 at Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria and commissioned into the Royal Navy on 13 November 1976. After being damaged in May 2008 in the Red Sea, she returned to HMNB Devonport where she was decommissioned slightly ahead of schedule on 26 September 2008.

==Operations==
She was the first British submarine to visit the Arctic Ocean and sail under the polar ice caps.

During the Falklands War, &quot;Superb&quot; was spotted sailing from Gibraltar, which prompted press speculation that she was sailing to the South Atlantic to enforce a maritime exclusion zone. In fact, only was sailing south at that time but the speculation was useful to promote the apparent threat of the Royal Navy in the South Atlantic and was not corrected by the Navy or Ministry of Defence.

&quot;Superb&quot; operated in the Indian Ocean in 2001, in support of Operation Veritas, part of the War in Afghanistan.
In January 2008 a sentry was found sleeping while on watch; the reprimand to the crew was caught on video.

===2008 underwater pinnacle collision===
On 26 May 2008 &quot;Superb&quot; hit an underwater pinnacle in the Red Sea, south of the Suez Canal. She remained watertight, and none of the 112 crew were injured; however, she was unable to re-submerge due to damage to her sonar. After undertaking initial repairs at the Souda Bay NATO base on Crete on 10 June 2008, she passed through the Mediterranean Sea, with a pause (at night) some miles off Gibraltar to disembark some less critical crew. &quot;Superb&quot; then continued back to the UK, arriving at Devonport Dockyard on 28 June 2008. After surveying the damage, the Royal Navy decided to decommission &quot;Superb&quot; slightly ahead of schedule on 26 September 2008.

Nearly two years after the grounding, &quot;Superb&quot;″s commanding officer at the time of the accident and two other officers were reprimanded for their roles in the collision. All three pleaded guilty to the charges of neglecting to perform their duty in failing to notice that the submarine was traveling towards the pinnacle. Despite the incident, all three officers were still serving in the Royal Navy at the time of the court-martial.

<text>The Dearborn River is a tributary of the Missouri River, approximately 70 mi (113 km) long, in central Montana in the United States. It rises in the Lewis and Clark National Forest, near Scapegoat Mountain in the Lewis and Clark Range of the Rocky Mountains at the continental divide, in western Lewis and Clark County. It flows generally southeast through secluded canyons, and joins the Missouri near Craig.

It is crossed by the Dearborn River High Bridge, which was constructed in 1897.

It is a popular destination for whitewater rafting and fly fishing. Whirling disease has become a significant problem among trout in the river.

The Dearborn is a Class I river for stream access for recreational purposes from the highway 431 bridge to its confluence with the Missouri river.

<doc id="533317" wikidata="Q5248831" url="?curid=533317" title="Decay theory">
<text>The Decay theory is a theory that proposes that memory fades due to the mere passage of time. Information is therefore less available for later retrieval as time passes and memory, as well as memory strength, wears away. When an individual learns something new, a neurochemical &quot;memory trace&quot; is created. However, over time this trace slowly disintegrates. Actively rehearsing information is believed to be a major factor counteracting this temporal decline. It is widely believed that neurons die off gradually as we age, yet some older memories can be stronger than most recent memories. Thus, decay theory mostly affects the short-term memory system, meaning that older memories (in long-term memory) are often more resistant to shocks or physical attacks on the brain. It is also thought that the passage of time alone cannot cause forgetting, and that decay theory must also take into account some processes that occur as more time passes.

==History==

The term &quot;decay theory&quot; was first coined by Edward Thorndike in his book &quot;The Psychology of Learning&quot; in 1914. This simply states that if a person does not access and use the memory representation they have formed the memory trace will fade or decay over time. This theory was based on the early memory work by Hermann Ebbinghaus in the late 19th century. The decay theory proposed by Thorndike was heavily criticized by McGeoch and his interference theory. This led to the abandoning of the decay theory, until the late 1950s when studies by John Brown and the Petersons showed evidence of time based decay by filling the retention period by counting backwards in threes from a given number. This led to what is known as the Brown–Peterson paradigm. The theory was again challenged, this time a paper by Keppel and Underwood who attributed the findings to proactive interference. Studies in the 1970s by Reitman tried reviving the decay theory by accounting for certain confounds criticized by Keppel and Underwood. Roediger quickly found problems with these studies and their methods. Harris made an attempt to make a case for decay theory by using tones instead of word lists and his results are congruent making a case for decay theory. In addition, McKone used implicit memory tasks as opposed to explicit tasks to address the confound problems. They provided evidence for decay theory, however, the results also interacted with interference effects. One of the biggest criticisms of decay theory is that it cannot be explained as a mechanism and that is the direction that the research is headed.

==Inconsistencies==

Researchers disagree about whether memories fade as a function of the mere passage of time (as in decay theory) or as a function of interfering succeeding events (as in interference theory). Evidence tends to favor interference-related decay over temporal decay, yet this varies depending on the specific memory system taken into account.

===Short-term memory===

Within the short-term memory system, evidence favours an interference theory of forgetting, based on various researchers&#x27; manipulation of the amount of time between a participant&#x27;s retention and recall stages finding little to no effect on how many items they are able to remember. Looking solely at verbal short-term memory within studies that control against participants&#x27; use of rehearsal processes, a very small temporal decay effect coupled with a much larger interference decay effect can be found. No evidence for temporal decay in verbal short-term memory has been found in recent studies of serial recall tasks. Regarding the word-length effect in short-term memory, which states that lists of longer word are harder to recall than lists of short words, researchers argue that interference plays a larger role due to articulation duration being confounded with other word characteristics.

===Working memory===

Both theories are equally argued in working memory. One situation in which this shows considerable debate is within the complex-span task of working memory, where a complex task is alternated with the encoding of to-be-remembered items. It is either argued that the amount of time taken to perform this task or the amount of interference this task involves cause decay. A time-based resource-sharing model has also been proposed, stating that temporal decay occurs once attention is switched away from whatever information is to be remembered, and occupied by processing of the information. This theory gives more credit to the active rehearsal of information, as refreshing items to be remembered focuses attention back on the information to be remembered in order for it to be better processed and stored in memory. As processing and maintenance are both crucial components of working memory, both of these processes need to be taken into account when determining which theory of forgetting is most valid. Research also suggests that information or an event&#x27;s salience, or importance, may play a key role. Working memory may decay in proportion to information or an event&#x27;s salience. This means that if something is more meaningful to an individual, that individual may be less likely to forget it quickly.

===System interaction===

These inconsistencies may be found due to the difficulty with conducting experiments that focus solely on the passage of time as a cause of decay, ruling out alternative explanations. However, a close look at the literature regarding decay theory will reveal inconsistencies across several studies and researchers, making it difficult to pinpoint precisely which indeed plays the larger role within the various systems of memory. It could be argued that both temporal decay and interference play an equally important role in forgetting, along with motivated forgetting and retrieval failure theory.

==Future directions==

Revisions in decay theory are being made in research today. The theory is simple and intuitive, but also problematic. Decay theory has long been rejected as a mechanism of long term forgetting. Now, its place in short term forgetting is being questioned. The simplicity of the theory works against it in that supporting evidence always leaves room for alternative explanations. Researchers have had much difficulty creating experiments that can pinpoint decay as a definitive mechanism of forgetting. Current studies have always been limited in their abilities to establish decay due to confounding evidence such as attention effects or the operation of interference.

===Hybrid theories===

The future of decay theory, according to Nairne (2002), should be the development of hybrid theories that incorporate elements of the standard model while also assuming that retrieval cues play an important role in short term memory. By broadening the view of this theory, it will become possible to account for the inconsistencies and problems that have been found with decay to date.

===Neuronal evidence===

Another direction of future research is to tie decay theory to sound neurological evidence. As most current evidence for decay leaves room for alternate explanations, studies indicating a neural basis for the idea of decay will give the theory new solid support. Jonides et al. (2008) found neural evidence for decay in tests demonstrating a general decline in activation in posterior regions over a delay period. Though this decline was not found to be strongly related to performance, this evidence is a starting point in making these connections between decay and neural imaging. 
A model proposed to support decay with neurological evidence places importance on the firing patterns of neurons over time. The neuronal firing patterns that make up the target representation fall out of synchrony over time unless they are reset. The process of resetting the firing patterns can be looked at as rehearsal, and in absence of rehearsal, forgetting occurs. This proposed model needs to be tested further to gain support, and bring firm neurological evidence to the decay theory.

<doc id="533318" wikidata="Q650448" url="?curid=533318" title="Manuel Moschopoulos">
<text>Manuel Moschopoulos (Latinized as Manuel Moschopulus; ), was a Byzantine commentator and grammarian, who lived during the end of the 13th and the beginning of the 14th century and was an important figure in the Palaiologan Renaissance. &quot;Moschopoulos&quot; means &quot;little calf,&quot; and is probably a nickname.

==Life==
Moschopoulos was a student of Maximos Planudes and possibly his successor as a head of a school in Constantinople, where he taught throughout his life. A mysterious and ill-documented excursion into politics led to his imprisonment for a while.

==Works==
His chief work is &quot;Erotemata grammaticalia&quot; (), in the form of question and answer, based upon an anonymous epitome of grammar, and supplemented by a lexicon of Attic nouns. He was also the author of &quot;scholia&quot; on the first and second books of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, on Hesiod, Theocritus, Pindar and other classical and later authors; of riddles, letters, and a treatise on the magic squares. His grammatical treatises formed the foundation of the labors of such promoters of classical studies as Manuel Chrysoloras, Theodorus Gaza, Guarini, and Constantine Lascaris. As an editor, while making many false conjectures, he was responsible for clearing many long-standing errors in the traditional texts. His comments when original, are mainly lexicographical.

Moschopoulos&#x27; treatise on magic squares is dedicated to Nicholas Rhabdas, his contemporary mathematician.

Other works include an anti-Latin theological pamphlet. A selection from his works under the title of &quot;Manuelis Moschopuli opuscula grammatica&quot; was published by F. N. Titze (Leipzig, 1822); see also Karl Krumbacher, &quot;Geschichte der byzantinischen Litteratur&quot; (1897) and M. Treu, &quot;Maximi monachi Planudis epistulae&quot; (1890), p. 208.

<doc id="533322" wikidata="Q1815229" url="?curid=533322" title="Lao script">
<text>Lao script or Akson Lao ( ) is the primary script used to write the Lao language and other minority languages in Laos. Its earlier form, the Tai Noi script, was also used to write the Isan language, but was replaced by the Thai script. It has 27 consonants ( ), 7 consonantal ligatures ( ), 33 vowels (/ ), and 4 tone marks ( ).

The Lao abugida was adapted from the Khmer script, which itself was derived from the Pallava script, a variant of the Grantha script descended from the Brāhmī script, which was used in southern India and South East Asia during the 5th and 6th centuries AD. Akson Lao is a sister system to the Thai script, with which it shares many similarities and roots. However, Lao has fewer characters and is formed in a more curvilinear fashion than Thai.

Lao is written from left to right. Vowels can be written above, below, in front of, or behind consonants, with some vowel combinations written before, over, and after. Spaces for separating words and punctuation were traditionally not used, but space is used and functions in place of a comma or period. The letters have no majuscule or minuscule (upper- and lowercase) differentiation.

==History==

The Lao script ultimately derived from a variant of the Old Khmer script of Angkor, through the Sukhothai script. By the late 15th century, a form of the Sukhothai script had reached the Mekong River basin, after which the script developed differences between its Thai and Lao variants. In the 1960s, the Lao People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party has simplified the spelling to be phonemic and omitted extra letters used to write words of Pali-Sanskrit origin.

In the 1930s, Maha Sila Viravong, a Buddhist scholar, backed by the Buddhist Institute in Vientiane and the Buddhist Academic Council, added an additional set of Lao characters to support Pali and Sanskrit, thereby filling the missing gaps in the existing script. While the Buddhist Institute published books that utilised these extended Indic characters, they did not see widespread usage, and fell out of usage by 1975. In 2019, the extended Indic characters were added to Unicode 12.

==Consonants==
The twenty-seven consonants of the Lao alphabet are divided into three tone classes—high (ສູງ ), middle (ກາງ ), and low (ຕ່ຳ )—which determine the tonal pronunciation of the word in conjunction with the four tone marks and distinctions between short and long vowels. Aside from tone, there are twenty-one distinct consonant sounds that occur in the Lao language. Each letter has an acrophonical name that either begins with or features the letter prominently, and is used to teach the letter and serves to distinguish them from other, homophonous consonants. The letter ອ is a special null consonant used as a mandatory anchor for vowels, which cannot stand alone, and also to serve as a vowel in its own right.

The letter ຣ (r) is a relatively new re-addition to the Lao alphabet. It was dropped as part of a language reform because most speakers pronounced it as &quot;l&quot;, and had an ambiguous status for several decades. A 1999 dictionary does not include it when listing the full alphabet but does use it to spell many country names. A comprehensive dictionary published by a high-ranking official in the Ministry of Information and Culture did not include it. However, as the Lao vocabulary began to incorporate more foreign names (such as Europe, Australia, and America) it filled a need and is now taught in schools. The letter ຣ can also be found in Unit 14 (ບົດທີ 14 ຮ ຫ ຣ) of a textbook published by the government. It is generally used as the first consonant of a syllable, or to follow a leading consonant, rarely as a final consonant.

===Consonant chart===
The table below shows the Lao consonant, its name, its pronunciation according to the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), as well as various romanization schemes, such as the French-based systems in use by both the US &quot;Board of Geographic Names&quot; and the British &quot;Permanent Committee on Geographical Names&quot; (BGN/PCGN), the English-based system in use by the US Library of Congress (LC), Royal Thai General System of Transcription (RTGS) used in Thailand, and finally its Unicode name. A slash indicates the pronunciation at the beginning juxtaposed with its pronunciation at the end of a syllable.

; Notes
===Consonantal digraphs and ligatures===
Lao also uses digraphs based on combinations of the silent (unpronounced) ຫ ຫ່ານ with certain other consonants, some of which also have special ligature forms that are optionally used.

In the Thai script, certain consonants are preceded by tone modifiers. This is because high consonants or low consonants cannot produce the full 5 tones of Thai. For instance, tone modifier ห can turn low consonants into high ones. This also explains why the Lao script reserved consonants with the same sounds (e.g. ຂ and ຄ /kʰ/, ສ and ຊ /s/). Both high and low consonants are needed to produce full five (or six) tones of Lao.

Such design also exists in Lao. Sonorants ງ, ຍ, ນ, ມ, ລ, ວ are originally low consonants, but when they&#x27;re preceded by ຫ, they become high consonants.

The older versions of the script also included special forms for combinations of ພ (pʰ) + ຍ (ɲ), ສ (s) + ນ (n), and ມ (m) + ລ (l). In addition, consonant clusters that had the second component of ຣ (r) or ລ (l) were written with a special form ◌ຼ underneath the consonant. Since these were not pronounced in Lao, they were removed during various spelling reforms, and this symbol only appears in the ligature ຫຼ.
===Phonetic===
Lao characters in initial position (several letters appearing in the same box have identical pronunciation).
:

Lao characters in final position. In the old documents, the letter ຽ could be found in place of ຍ.
== Vowels==
In its earlier form, Lao would be considered a full abugida, in which the &quot;inherent vowel&quot; is embedded in the consonant letters. The spelling reforms by the communist Lao People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party shallows the orthography: the main vowels are now written explicitly, but the rest of vowel diacritics still apply. However, many Lao outside of Laos, and some inside Laos, continue to write according to former spelling standards. For example, the old spelling of ສເຫຼີມ &quot;to hold a ceremony, celebrate&quot; contrasts with the new ສະເຫລີມ/ສະເຫຼີມ.

Vowels are constructed from only a handful of basic symbols, but they can be combined with other vowel forms and semi-vowels to represent the full repertoire of diphthongs and triphthongs used in the language.
Vowels cannot stand alone or begin a syllable, so the silent consonant ອ, which can function as a vowel in its own right, is used as a base when spelling a word that begins with a vowel sound.

The names of the vowels are just as easy as saying &quot;sala&quot; (ສະຫຼະ, ) before the vowel sign.
Some vowels have unique names, and these are ໃ◌ (ໄມ້ມ້ວນ, , &quot;rolled stem&quot;), ໄ◌ (ໄມ້ມາຍ, , &quot;unwound stem&quot;), ◌ົ (ໄມ້ກົງ, . , &quot;straight stem&quot;), ◌ັ (ໄມ້ກັນ, . , &quot;ear stem&quot;), ◌ຽ (ວິລາມ, ), and ◌ໍ (ນິກຄະຫິດ, ).

Although a dotted circle ◌ is used on this page to represent the consonant, in standard Lao orthography a small x symbol is used for this purpose.
Traditionally this was a simple, stylized, sans-serif x and it was included in Lao fonts before Unicode became widespread.
Unicode does not make it available as part of the Lao alphabet set, and a lower-case sans-serif x is often used instead.

Some vowels change their forms depending on whether they appear in the final or medial position.

=== Short and long vowels ===
=== Special vowels ===
:

As in the neighboring Thai script, ◌ະ is used to represent a glottal stop after a vowel.

==Punctuation==
Lao is traditionally not written with spaces between words. Spaces are reserved for ends of clauses or sentences. Periods are not used, and questions can be determined by question words in a sentence. Traditional punctuation marks include ◌໌, an obsolete mark indicating silenced consonants; ໆ, used to indicate repetition of the preceding word; ຯ, the Lao ellipsis that is also used to indicate omission of words; ฯ, a more or less obsolete symbol indicating shortened form of a phrase (such as royal names); and ฯລฯ, used to indicate &quot;et cetera&quot;.

In more contemporary writing, punctuation marks are borrowed from French, such as exclamation point !, question mark ?, parentheses (), and «» for quotation marks, although &quot;&quot; is also common. Hyphens (-) and the ellipsis (...) are also commonly found in modern writing.

== Numerals ==

==Other languages in Lao script==
According to Article 89 of the 2003 Amended Constitution of the Lao People&#x27;s Democratic Republic, the Lao alphabet, though originally used solely for transcribing the Lao language, is also used to write several minority languages.

#Additional Lao characters used to write Pali/Sanskrit, the liturgical language of Theravāda Buddhism, are now available with the publication of Unicode 12.0. The font &quot;Lao Pali (Alpha)&quot; can be downloaded from Aksharamukha.
#Additional Lao characters used to write Khmu’ were also encoded. The script has also been adapted for Katu, while Tai-speaking groups in Viet Nam including the Tai Dam and White Tai use a similar script (called Tai Viet).
#An older version of Lao, &quot;Tai Noi&quot;, was also used by the ethnic Lao of Thailand&#x27;s Isan region before Isan was incorporated into Siam. Its use was banned by the Thai government and supplemented with the very similar Thai alphabet in 1871; however, the region remained culturally and politically distant until further government campaigns and integration into the Thai state (Thaification) were imposed in the 20th century. Attempts to encode Thai Noi in Unicode have been made.
#The applicability of Lao script for other minority languages requires further evaluations.

Some minority languages use other writing systems. For example, the Hmong adopted the Romanized Popular Alphabet to spell the Hmong languages.

==Lao compatible software==
Linux has been available in Lao since 2005.

Windows did not officially support Lao until Windows Vista. User-generated fonts are freely available online.

In December 2011, the Lao Ministry of Science and Technology, in cooperation with the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications, officially authorized the use of Phetsarath OT as the standard national font.

The Phetsarath OT font was already adopted by the government in 2009; however, Lao users were unable to use it, as international software manufacturers did not include the font in their software systems. Mobile devices were not able to use or show Lao language. Instead, mobile phone users had to rely on Thai or English as language.

The Laos Ministry of Post and Telecommunications asked local technicians to develop a software system of international standard that would enable the Phetsarath OT font to be like other font systems that local users could access.

In March 2011, the Lao company XY Mobile presented the Phetsarath OT on mobile phones as well as tablet PCs using the mobile device operating system Android.

iOS supports Lao script on iPhones and iPads.

==Obsolete consonants==

The consonant letters below are obsolete, due to spelling reforms. Characters for these obsolete letters are added in later versions of Unicode. For additional details, see the Thai script page&#x27;s sections for the alphabetic table and usage for Sanskrit and Pali.

== Unicode ==

The Unicode block for the Lao script is U+0E80–U+0EFF, added in Unicode version 1.0. The first ten characters of the row U+0EDx are the Lao numerals 0 through 9. Throughout the chart, grey (unassigned) code points are shown because the assigned Lao characters intentionally match the relative positions of the corresponding Thai characters. This has created the anomaly that the Lao letter is not in alphabetical order, since it occupies the same code-point as the Thai letter .

<text>The East Gallatin River flows in a northwesterly direction through the Gallatin valley, Gallatin County, Montana. Rising from the confluence of Rocky Creek and several other small streams, the East Gallatin begins about one mile (1.6 km) east of downtown Bozeman, Montana. The river joins the main stem of the Gallatin River north of Manhattan, Montana. Throughout its course, the river traverses mostly valley floor ranch and farm land with typical summer flows of approximately .

==Angling the East Gallatin==
The East Gallatin river is a popular trout fishing stream and holds good populations of rainbow and brown trout as well as mountain whitefish. Access is limited to country road crossings and two public assess sites maintained by the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks department. Numerous spring creeks, most notably Ben Hart and Thompson, feed the East Gallatin throughout its course and provide excellent trout fishing as well.

<doc id="533330" wikidata="Q3587151" url="?curid=533330" title="1972 Fijian general election">
<text>General elections were held in Fiji between 15 and 29 April 1972, the first since independence from the United Kingdom in 1970. They were characterised by the lack of rancour between racial groups, typical of the 1966 general election and the 1968 by-elections.

The result was a landslide for the Alliance Party of the Prime Minister, Kamisese Mara, which won 33 of the 52 seats, and surprised many observers by capturing almost 25 percent of the Indo-Fijian vote. The Indo-Fijian-dominated National Federation Party led by Sidiq Koya won the remaining 19 seats. The election re-affirmed the political allegiances of the past, with the Alliance Party winning all the Fijian Communal seats with 82% of the vote, as well as all the General Communal seats. The National Federation Party (NFP) won all the Indian Communal sets with 73% of the vote. Voter turnout was 85.2% in the communal seats.

==Electoral system==
The 52-member House of Representatives consisted of 27 members elected from communal constituencies (12 Fijian, 12 Indo-Fijian and three general electors) and 25 members elected from national constituencies (10 Fijian, 10 Indo-Fijian and five general electors), all elected by first-past-the-post voting.

Voters could cast up to four votes; one in their own communal constituency, and three in their national constituency, in which they voted for a Fijian, Indo-Fijian and general elector candidate.

==Results==
==Aftermath==
Following the elections, R. D. Patel of the National Federation Party became Speaker.

Prime Minister Mara carried out a cabinet reshuffle, appointing a new cabinet with 14 ministers, an increase from 12 in the previous government. He appointed two members to the Senate – John Falvey and Penaia Ganilau – to allow them to join the cabinet.

<doc id="533333" wikidata="Q2133926" url="?curid=533333" title="Ray Lyman Wilbur">
<text>Ray Lyman Wilbur (April 13, 1875 – June 26, 1949) was an American medical doctor who served as the third president of Stanford University and as the 31st United States Secretary of the Interior under President Herbert Hoover, also a Stanford alum.

==Early and personal life==
Wilbur was born in Boonesboro, Iowa, the son of attorney and businessman Dwight Locke Wilbur and the former Edna Maria Lyman. He was raised with a brother, Curtis D. Wilbur, who served as the U.S. Secretary of the Navy under President Calvin Coolidge, and was a judge of the Supreme Court of California. The Wilbur family moved to Riverside, California, when Ray Lyman was twelve.

Wilbur graduated from Riverside High School, then studied at Stanford University, receiving a B.A. degree in 1896 and an M.A. degree in 1897. He then studied at Cooper Medical College in San Francisco (then of the University of California, San Francisco, now the medical school of Stanford), receiving a Doctor of Medicine degree in 1899.

While a freshman at his Stanford home, Wilbur met future President Herbert Hoover, who was drumming up business on campus for a local laundry. The two men became lifelong friends.

On December 5, 1898, Wilbur married the former Marguerite May Blake, who was a college friend of Lou Hoover, Herbert Hoover&#x27;s wife. The couple had five children (Jessica Wilbur Ely, Blake Colburn Wilbur, Dwight Locke Wilbur, Lois Wilbur Hopper, and Ray Lyman Wilbur, Jr.). Marguerite Wilbur died on December 24, 1946, at age 71.

==Stanford University==
Wilbur first became a member of Stanford&#x27;s faculty in 1896, as an instructor in physiology. In 1900, Wilbur was made an assistant professor while simultaneously carrying on a busy medical practice. He was the only physician in the university community.

From 1903 to 1909, Wilbur practiced medicine full-time. In 1909, he became a professor of medicine and in 1911 was named dean of the new Stanford University School of Medicine, located at the former Cooper Medical College, where Wilbur had received his M.D. degree. He served as the dean until 1916.

In 1916, he was chosen to serve as president of Stanford and continued in that position until 1943, including during his tenure as Secretary of the Interior. Upon his inauguration as its president, he said that he intended to devote the rest of his life to Stanford, and he did. From his retirement as president in 1943 until his death in 1949, he served as the University&#x27;s chancellor. During World War I, Wilbur served as a chief of the conservation division of the United States Food Administration. While at the USFA, he coined the slogan &quot;Food Will Win the War.&quot;

Wilbur reorganized graduate education, established the Lower Division, introduced Independent Study, and regrouped academic departments within the Schools of the University. He launched the Stanford Graduate School of Business and the Food Research Institute. Among his most notable stances while at Stanford were his opposition to fraternities and to automobiles on campus.

Wilbur served as the President of the American Medical Association from 1923 to 1924. In 1923, he was one of the doctors called in to consult when President Warren G. Harding fell ill in San Francisco, and was present at his deathbed. His son, Dwight Locke Wilbur, later followed in his footsteps as President of the AMA from 1968 until 1969. Wilbur belonged to several private men&#x27;s clubs, including the Bohemian Club, the Pacific-Union Club, the Commonwealth Club and the University Club in San Francisco.

When the California Legislature established the State Park Commission in 1927, Wilbur was named to the original commission, along with Major Frederick Russell Burnham, W. F. Chandler, William Edward Colby, and Henry W. O&#x27;Melveny.

==Secretary of the Interior==
On March 5, 1929, President Hoover nominated Wilbur as the U.S. Secretary of the Interior confirmed by the Senate, and assumed office the same day. His tenure ended on March 4, 1933, as Hoover left office.

As Interior Secretary, Wilbur addressed corruption in granting contracts for naval oil reserves, which had caused controversy during the Harding administration&#x27;s Teapot Dome scandal. Wilbur promulgated a policy that no new oil leases would be granted to private individuals except when mandated by law.
Wilbur was criticized by political opponents for his allocation of power from Boulder Dam to private utilities. Opponents also criticized him for renaming the dam Hoover Dam.

Wilbur took a particular interest in Native Americans while in office and reorganized the department&#x27;s Bureau of Indian Affairs. He assisted Native Americans in working to become more self-reliant.

==New Deal critic==
After leaving the Department of the Interior in 1933, Wilbur became a vocal critic of Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal and was the leading champion of &quot;rugged individualism&quot;.

He wrote: &quot;It is common talk that every individual is entitled to economic security. The only animals and birds I know that have economic security are those that have been domesticated—and the economic security they have is controlled by the barbed-wire fence, the butcher&#x27;s knife and the desire of others. They are milked, skinned, egged or eaten up by their protectors.&quot;

==Death and legacy==
Wilbur died of heart disease at his Stanford campus home on June 26, 1949, at age 74. He is buried at Alta Mesa Memorial Park in Palo Alto, California. Hoover eulogized him as &quot;my devoted friend and constant friend since boyhood.&quot; He said of Wilbur: &quot;During all his years, including his later chancellorship of Stanford, he has given a multitude of services to the people. Public health and education have been enriched over all these years from his sane statesmanship and rugged intellectual honesty. America is a better place for his having lived in it.&quot;
A dormitory complex at Stanford University is named after Wilbur.

<text>Wycliffe Bible Translators USA (also known as Wycliffe USA) is an interdenominational nonprofit organization with a goal &quot;for people from every language to understand the Bible and be transformed.&quot;

Based in Orlando, Florida, it partners with many organizations and churches around the world to help facilitate the work of Bible translation. It is the largest of the many independent organizations that together are part of Wycliffe Global Alliance.

==History==
Wycliffe USA was founded in 1942 by William Cameron Townsend, and is named after John Wycliffe who was responsible for the first complete English translation of the whole Bible into Middle English.

It led to the founding of many similar organisations around the world, with separate Wycliffe organizations in over 60 countries within the Wycliffe Global Alliance.

, translations of either portions of the Bible, the New Testament, or the whole Bible exist in over 3,658 of the 7,394 languages used on Earth. Wycliffe has translated the Bible into more than 700 languages.

==Methodology==
Wycliffe describes its mission as being to &quot;Serve with the global body of Christ to advance Bible translation and work together so people can encounter God through his Word&quot;.

Wycliffe missionaries develop alphabets, help preliterate people learn to read and write, and translate the Bible into written versions of currently spoken languages. By developing written languages, the organization is helping to &quot;save lost and dying languages.&quot;

Due to technological advances, Wycliffe&#x27;s missionaries in the United States connect with translation teams in other areas of the world to translate the Bible into additional languages. As a result, translations that used to take 20 or 30 years to finish can be completed in six or seven years in some cases.

Wycliffe has also joined with the Deaf Bible Society and other organizations to translate the Bible into sign languages.

==Associated organizations==
SIL International, originally the Summer Institute of Linguistics, began as a small summer training session for missionaries in Arkansas in 1934. It is a partner organization of the Wycliffe Global Alliance and Wycliffe USA.

A partner organization of SIL International, JAARS, originally the Jungle Aviation And Radio Service, based out of Waxhaw, NC, provides transportation and technical support for SIL in support of Bible translation across the globe.

The Seed Company is a subsidiary of Wycliffe USA that provides support to people doing Bible translations for their own languages.

<doc id="533342" wikidata="Q1054190" url="?curid=533342" title="Khmer script">
<text>Khmer script (, ) is an abugida (alphasyllabary) script used to write the Khmer language, the official language of Cambodia. It is also used to write Pali in the Buddhist liturgy of Cambodia and Thailand.

Khmer is written from left to right. Words within the same sentence or phrase are generally run together with no spaces between them. Consonant clusters within a word are &quot;stacked&quot;, with the second (and occasionally third) consonant being written in reduced form under the main consonant. Originally there were 35 consonant characters, but modern Khmer uses only 33. Each character represents a consonant sound together with an inherent vowel, either &quot;â&quot; or &quot;ô&quot;; in many cases, in the absence of another vowel mark, the inherent vowel is to be pronounced after the consonant.

There are some independent vowel characters, but vowel sounds are more commonly represented as dependent vowels, additional marks accompanying a consonant character, and indicating what vowel sound is to be pronounced after that consonant (or consonant cluster). Most dependent vowels have two different pronunciations, depending in most cases on the inherent vowel of the consonant to which they are added. There are also a number of diacritics used to indicate further modifications in pronunciation. The script also includes its own numerals and punctuation marks.

==Origin==

The Khmer script was adapted from the Pallava script, used in southern India and Southeast Asia during the 5th and 6th centuries AD, which ultimately descended from the Tamil-Brahmi script. The oldest dated Khmer inscription was found at Angkor Borei District in Takéo Province south of Phnom Penh and dates from 611. Stelae of the Pre-Angkorean and Angkorean periods, featuring the Khmer script, have been found throughout the former Khmer Empire, from the Mekong Delta to what is now southern Laos, Northeast Thailand, and Central Thailand. Slight differences can be seen between ancient Khmer inscriptions written in Sanskrit and those written in Khmer. These two different systems have evolved into the modern and styles of Khmer script. The former is used for sacred inscriptions while the latter is used for general use. The style is a cursive form of , adapted to fit the Khmer language.

The modern Khmer script differs somewhat from precedent forms seen on the inscriptions of the ruins of Angkor. The Thai and Lao scripts are descendants of an older cursive form of the Khmer script, through the Sukhothai script.

== Consonants ==
There are 35 Khmer consonant symbols, although modern Khmer only uses 33, two having become obsolete. Each consonant has an inherent vowel: &quot;â&quot; or &quot;ô&quot; ; equivalently, each consonant is said to belong to the &quot;a&quot;-series or &quot;o&quot;-series. A consonant&#x27;s series determines the pronunciation of the dependent vowel symbols which may be attached to it, and in some positions the sound of the inherent vowel is itself pronounced.

The two series originally represented voiceless and voiced consonants respectively (and are still referred to as such in Khmer). Sound changes during the Middle Khmer period affected vowels following voiceless consonants, and these changes were preserved even though the distinctive voicing was lost .

Each consonant, with one exception, also has a subscript form. These may also be called &quot;sub-consonants&quot;; the Khmer phrase is &#x27;, meaning &quot;foot of a letter&quot;. Most subscript consonants resemble the corresponding consonant symbol, but in a smaller and possibly simplified form, although in a few cases there is no obvious resemblance. Most subscript consonants are written directly below other consonants, although subscript &#x27; appears to the left, while a few others have ascending elements which appear to the right.

Subscripts are used in writing consonant clusters (consonants pronounced consecutively in a word with no vowel sound between them). Clusters in Khmer normally consist of two consonants, although occasionally in the middle of a word there will be three. The first consonant in a cluster is written using the main consonant symbol, with the second (and third, if present) attached to it in subscript form. Subscripts were previously also used to write final consonants; in modern Khmer this may be done, optionally, in some words ending &quot;-ng&quot; or &quot;-y&quot;, such as &quot;&quot; (&quot;give&quot;).

The consonants and their subscript forms are listed in the following table. Usual phonetic values are given using the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA); variations are described below the table. The sound system is described in detail at Khmer phonology. The spoken name of each consonant letter is its value together with its inherent vowel. Transliterations are given using the transcription system of the &quot;Geographic Department of the Cambodian Ministry of Land Management and Urban Planning&quot; used by the Cambodian government and the UNGEGN system; for other systems see Romanization of Khmer.

The letter appears in somewhat modified form (e.g. ) when combined with certain dependent vowels (see Ligatures).

The letter &quot;nhô&quot; is written without the lower curve when a subscript is added. When it is subscripted to itself, the subscript is a smaller form of the entire letter: &quot;-nhnh-&quot;.

Note that &#x27; and &#x27; have the same subscript form. In initial clusters this subscript is always pronounced , but in medial positions it is in some words and in others.

The series &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27; originally represented retroflex consonants in the Indic parent scripts. The second, third and fourth of these are rare, and occur only for etymological reasons in a few Pali and Sanskrit loanwords. Because the sound /n/ is common, and often grammatically productive, in Mon-Khmer languages, the fifth of this group, , was adapted as an a-series counterpart of &#x27; for convenience (all other nasal consonants are o-series).

=== Variation in pronunciation ===
The aspirated consonant letters (&quot;kh-&quot;, &quot;chh-&quot;, &quot;th-&quot;, &quot;ph-&quot;) are pronounced with aspiration only before a vowel. There is also slight aspiration with &quot;k&quot;, &quot;ch&quot;, &quot;t&quot; and &quot;p&quot; sounds before certain consonants, but this is regardless of whether they are spelt with a letter that indicates aspiration.

A Khmer word cannot end with more than one consonant sound, so subscript consonants at the end of words (which appear for etymological reasons) are not pronounced, although they may come to be pronounced when the same word begins a compound.

In some words, a single medial consonant symbol represents both the final consonant of one syllable and the initial consonant of the next.

The letter &quot;bâ&quot; represents only before a vowel. When final or followed by a subscript consonant, it is pronounced (and in the case where it is followed by a subscript consonant, it is also romanized as &quot;p&quot; in the UN system). For modification to &quot;p&quot; by means of a diacritic, see Supplementary consonants. The letter, which represented /p/ in Indic scripts, also often maintains the sound in certain words borrowed from Sanskrit and Pali.

The letters &quot;dâ&quot; and &quot;dô&quot; are pronounced when final. The letter &quot;tâ&quot; is pronounced in initial position in a weak syllable ending with a nasal.

In final position, letters representing a sound (&quot;k-&quot;, &quot;kh-&quot;) are pronounced as a glottal stop after the vowels , , , , , , , , . The letter &#x27; is silent when final (in most dialects; see Northern Khmer). The letter &#x27; when final is pronounced (which in this position approaches ).

=== Supplementary consonants ===
The Khmer writing system includes supplementary consonants, used in certain loanwords, particularly from French and Thai. These mostly represent sounds which do not occur in native words, or for which the native letters are restricted to one of the two vowel series. Most of them are digraphs, formed by stacking a subscript under the letter , with an additional &quot;treisăpt&quot; diacritic if required to change the inherent vowel to &quot;ô&quot;. The character for &quot;pâ&quot;, however, is formed by placing the &quot;musĕkâtônd&quot; (&quot;mouse teeth&quot;) diacritic over the character .

== Dependent vowels ==
Most Khmer vowel sounds are written using dependent, or diacritical, vowel symbols, known in Khmer as or (&quot;connecting vowel&quot;). These can only be written in combination with a consonant (or consonant cluster). The vowel is pronounced after the consonant (or cluster), even though some of the symbols have graphical elements which appear above, below or to the left of the consonant character.

Most of the vowel symbols have two possible pronunciations, depending on the inherent vowel of the consonant to which it is added. Their pronunciations may also be different in weak syllables, and when they are shortened (e.g. by means of a diacritic). Absence of a dependent vowel (or diacritic) often implies that a syllable-initial consonant is followed by the sound of its inherent vowel.

In determining the inherent vowel of a consonant cluster (i.e. how a following dependent vowel will be pronounced), stops and fricatives are dominant over sonorants. For any consonant cluster including a combination of these sounds, a following dependent vowel is pronounced according to the dominant consonant, regardless of its position in the cluster. When both members of a cluster are dominant, the subscript consonant determines the pronunciation of a following dependent vowel.

A non-dominant consonant (and in some words also &quot;hâ&quot;) will also have its inherent vowel changed by a preceding dominant consonant in the same word, even when there is a vowel between them, although some words (especially among those with more than two syllables) do not obey this rule.

The dependent vowels are listed below, in conventional form with a dotted circle as a dummy consonant symbol, and in combination with the a-series letter &quot;’â&quot;. The IPA values given are representative of dialects from the northwest and central plains regions, specifically from the Battambang area, upon which Standard Khmer is based. Vowel pronunciation varies widely in other dialects such as Northern Khmer, where diphthongs are leveled, and Western Khmer, in which breathy voice and modal voice phonations are still contrastive.

The spoken name of each dependent vowel consists of the word &quot;srăk&quot; (&quot;vowel&quot;) followed by the vowel&#x27;s a-series value preceded by a glottal stop (and also followed by a glottal stop in the case of short vowels).

===Modification by diacritics===
The addition of some of the Khmer diacritics can modify the length and value of inherent or dependent vowels.

The following table shows combinations with the &#x27; and &#x27; diacritics, representing final and . They are shown with the a-series consonant &quot;’â&quot;.
The first four configurations listed here are treated as dependent vowels in their own right, and have names constructed in the same way as for the other dependent vowels (described in the previous section).

Other rarer configurations with the &quot;&quot; are (or ), pronounced , and , pronounced . The word &quot;yes&quot; (used by women) is pronounced [caː] and rarely .

The &quot;bânták&quot; (a small vertical line written over the final consonant of a syllable) has the following effects:
*in a syllable with inherent &quot;â&quot;, the vowel is shortened to , UN transcription &quot;á&quot;
*in a syllable with inherent &quot;ô&quot;, the vowel is modified to before a final labial, otherwise usually to ; UN transcription &quot;ó&quot;
*in a syllable with the &quot;a&quot; dependent vowel symbol () in the a-series, the vowel is shortened to , UN transcription &quot;ă&quot;
*in a syllable with that vowel symbol in the o-series, the vowel is modified to , UN transcription &quot;oă&quot;, or to &quot;eă&quot; before &quot;k&quot;, &quot;ng&quot;, &quot;h&quot;

The &#x27; is equivalent to the &quot;a&quot; dependent vowel with the &#x27;. However, its o-series pronunciation becomes before final &quot;y&quot;, and before final (silent) &quot;r&quot;.

The &quot;yŭkôlpĭntŭ&quot; (pair of dots) represents (a-series) or (o-series), followed by a glottal stop.

===Consonants with no dependent vowel===
There are three environments where a consonant may appear without a dependent vowel. The rules governing the inherent vowel differ for all three environments. Consonants may be written with no dependent vowel as an initial consonant of a weak syllable, an initial consonant of a strong syllable or as the final letter of a written word.

In careful speech, initial consonants without a dependent vowel in weak initial syllables are pronounced with their inherent vowel shortened as if modified by the &quot;bânták&quot; diacritic (see previous section). For example the first-series letter &quot; in &quot; (&quot;torch&quot;) is pronounced with the short vowel . The second-series letter &quot; in &quot; (&quot;light&quot;) is pronounced with the short diphthong . In casual speech, these are most often reduced to for both series.

Initial consonants in strong syllables without written vowels are pronounced with their inherent vowels. The word (&quot;to tie&quot;) is pronounced , (&quot;weak&quot;, &quot;to sink&quot;) is pronounced . In some words, however, the inherent vowel is pronounced in its reduced form, as if modified by a &quot;bântăk&quot; diacritic, even though the diacritic is not written (e.g. &quot;corpse&quot;). Such reduction regularly takes place in words ending with a consonant with a silent subscript (such as &quot;every&quot;), although in most such words it is the &quot;bânták&quot;-reduced form of the vowel &quot;a&quot; that is heard, as in &quot;noise&quot;. The word &quot;you, person&quot; has the highly irregular pronunciation .

Consonants written as the final letter of a word usually represent a word-final sound and are pronounced without any following vowel and, in the case of stops, with no audible release as in the examples above. However, in some words adopted from Pali and Sanskrit, what would appear to be a final consonant under normal rules can actually be the initial consonant of a following syllable and pronounced with a short vowel as if followed by . For example, according to rules for native Khmer words, (&quot;good&quot;, &quot;clean&quot;, &quot;beautiful&quot;) would appear to be a single syllable, but, being derived from Pali &quot;subha&quot;, it is pronounced .

===Ligatures===
Most consonants, including a few of the subscripts, form ligatures with the vowel (ា) and with all other dependent vowels that contain the same cane-like symbol. Most of these ligatures are easily recognizable, but a few may not be, particularly those involving the letter . This combines with the a vowel in the form , created to differentiate it from the consonant symbol and also from the ligature for with ().

Some more examples of ligatured symbols follow:

: Another example with , forming a similar ligature to that described above. Here the vowel is not a itself, but another vowel (au) which contains the cane-like stroke of that vowel as a graphical element.

: An example of the vowel a forming a connection with the serif of a consonant.

: Subscript consonants with ascending strokes above the baseline also form ligatures with the vowel symbol.

: Another example of a subscript consonant forming a ligature, this time with the vowel .

: The subscript for is written to the left of the main consonant, in this case , which here forms a ligature with .

==Independent vowels==
Independent vowels are non-diacritical vowel characters that stand alone (i.e. without being attached to a consonant symbol). In Khmer they are called &quot;sră pénh tuŏ&quot;, which means &quot;complete vowels&quot;. They are used in some words to represent certain combinations of a vowel with an initial glottal stop or liquid. The independent vowels are used in a small number of words, mostly of Indic origin, and consequently there is some inconsistency in their use and pronunciations. However, a few words in which they occur are used quite frequently; these include: &quot;now&quot;, &quot;father&quot;, &quot;or&quot;, &quot;hear&quot;, &quot;give, let&quot;, &quot;oneself, I, you&quot;, &quot;where&quot;.

Independent vowel letters are named similarly to the dependent vowels, with the word &quot;sră&quot; (&quot;vowel&quot;) followed by the principal sound of the letter (the pronunciation or first of the pronunciations listed above), followed by an additional glottal stop after a short vowel. However the letter ឥ is called &quot;sră ĕ&quot; .

==Diacritics==
The Khmer writing system contains several diacritics (, , ), used to indicate further modifications in pronunciation.

== Dictionary order ==

For the purpose of dictionary ordering of words, main consonants, subscript consonants and dependent vowels are all significant; and when they appear in combination, they are considered in the order in which they would be spoken (main consonant, subscript, vowel). The order of the consonants and of the dependent vowels is the order in which they appear in the above tables. A syllable written without any dependent vowel is treated as if it contained a vowel character that precedes all the visible dependent vowels.

As mentioned above, the four configurations with diacritics exemplified in the syllables are treated as dependent vowels in their own right, and come in that order at the end of the list of dependent vowels. Other configurations with the &quot;reăhmŭkh&quot; diacritic are ordered as if that diacritic were a final consonant coming after all other consonants. Words with the &quot;bânták&quot; and &quot;sâmyoŭk sânhnhéa&quot; diacritics are ordered directly after identically spelled words without the diacritics.

Vowels precede consonants in the ordering, so a combination of main and subscript consonants comes after any instance in which the same main consonant appears unsubscripted before a vowel.

Words spelled with an independent vowel whose sound begins with a glottal stop follow after words spelled with the equivalent combination of &quot;’â&quot; plus dependent vowel. Words spelled with an independent vowel whose sound begins or follow after all words beginning with the consonants &quot;rô&quot; and &quot;lô&quot; respectively.

Words spelled with a consonant modified by a diacritic follow words spelled with the same consonant and dependent vowel symbol but without the diacritic. However, words spelled with (a &quot;bâ&quot; converted to a &quot;p&quot; sound by a diacritic) follow all words with unmodified &quot;bâ&quot; (without diacritic and without subscript). Sometimes words in which is pronounced &quot;p&quot; are ordered as if the letter were written .

== Numerals ==
The numerals of the Khmer script, similar to that used by other civilizations in Southeast Asia, are also derived from the southern Indian script. Western-style Arabic numerals are also used, but to a lesser extent.

In large numbers, groups of three digits are delimited with Western-style periods. The decimal point is represented by a comma. The Cambodian currency, the riel, is abbreviated using the symbol or simply the letter &quot;rô&quot;.

== Spacing and punctuation ==

Spaces are not used between all words in written Khmer. Spaces are used within sentences in roughly the same places as commas might be in English, although they may also serve to set off certain items such as numbers and proper names.

Western-style punctuation marks are quite commonly used in modern Khmer writing, including French-style guillemets for quotation marks. However, traditional Khmer punctuation marks are also used; some of these are described in the following table.

A hyphen ( &quot;sâhâ sânhnhéa&quot;) is commonly used between components of personal names, and also as in English when a word is divided between lines of text. It can also be used between numbers to denote ranges or dates. Particular uses of Western-style periods include grouping of digits in large numbers (see &quot;Numerals&quot; hereinbefore) and denotation of abbreviations.

== Styles ==
Several styles of Khmer writing are used for varying purposes. The two main styles are (literally &quot;slanted script&quot;) and (&quot;round script&quot;).

* () refers to oblique letters. Entire bodies of text such as novels and other publications may be produced in &quot;âksâr chriĕng&quot;. Unlike in written English, oblique lettering does not represent any grammatical differences such as emphasis or quotation. Handwritten Khmer is often written in the oblique style.
* () or () refers to upright or &#x27;standing&#x27; letters, as opposed to oblique letters. Most modern Khmer typefaces are designed in this manner instead of being oblique, as text can be italicized by way of word processor commands and other computer applications to represent the oblique manner of &quot;âksâr chriĕng&quot;.
* (), also known as the Khom Thai script, is a style used in Pali palm-leaf manuscripts. It is characterized by sharper serifs and angles and retainment of some antique characteristics, notably in the consonant &quot;kâ&quot; (). This style is also for yantra tattoos and yantras on cloth, paper, or engravings on brass plates in Cambodia as well as in Thailand.
* () is calligraphical style similar to &quot;âksâr khâm&quot; as it also retains some characters reminiscent of antique Khmer script. Its name in Khmer means literally &#x27;round script&#x27; and it refers to the bold and thick lettering style. It is used for titles and headings in Cambodian documents, on books, banknotes, shop signs and banners. It is sometimes used to emphasize royal names or other important names.

== Unicode ==

The basic Khmer block was added to the Unicode Standard in version 3.0, released in September 1999. It then contained 103 defined code points; this was extended to 114 in version 4.0, released in April 2003. Version 4.0 also introduced an additional block, called Khmer Symbols, containing 32 signs used for writing lunar dates.

The Unicode block for basic Khmer characters is U+1780–U+17FF:
The first 35 characters are the consonant letters (including two obsolete). The symbols at U+17A3 and U+17A4 are deprecated (they were intended for use in Pali and Sanskrit transliteration, but are identical in appearance to the consonant , written alone or with the &quot;a&quot; vowel). These are followed by the 15 independent vowels (including one obsolete and one variant form). The code points U+17B4 and U+17B5 are invisible combining marks for inherent vowels, intended for use only in special applications.

Next come the 16 dependent vowel signs and the 12 diacritics (excluding the &quot;kbiĕh kraôm&quot;, which is identical in form to the &quot;ŏ&quot; dependent vowel); these are represented together with a dotted circle, but should be displayed appropriately in combination with a preceding Khmer letter.

The code point U+17D2, called &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;foot&quot;, is used to indicate that a following consonant is to be written in subscript form. It is not normally visibly rendered as a character. U+17D3 was originally intended for use in writing lunar dates, but its use is now discouraged (see the Khmer Symbols block hereafter). The next seven characters are the punctuation marks listed hereinbefore; these are followed by the riel currency symbol, a rare sign corresponding to the Sanskrit avagraha, and a mostly obsolete version of the &quot;vĭréam&quot; diacritic. The U+17Ex series contains the Khmer numerals, and the U+17Fx series contains variants of the numerals used in divination lore.

The block with additional lunar date symbols is U+19E0–U+19FF:
The symbols at U+19E0 and U+19F0 represent the first and second &quot;eighth month&quot; in a lunar year containing a leap-month (see Khmer calendar). The remaining symbols in this block denote the days of a lunar month: those in the U+19Ex series for waxing days, and those in the U+19Fx series for waning days.

<text>Theodorus Gaza (, &quot;Theodoros Gazis&quot;; ; ), also called Theodore Gazis or by the epithet Thessalonicensis (in Latin) and Thessalonikeus (in Greek) (c. 1398 – c. 1475), was a Greek humanist and translator of Aristotle, one of the Greek scholars who were the leaders of the revival of learning in the 15th century (the Palaeologan Renaissance).

==Life==
Theodorus Gaza was born a Greek in an illustrious family in Thessaloniki, Macedonia in about c. 1400 when the city was under its first period of Turkish rule (it was restored to Byzantine rule in 1403). On the final capture of his native city by the Turks in 1430 he escaped to Italy. In December 1440 he was in Pavia, where he became acquainted with Iacopo da San Cassiano, who introduced him to his master Vittorino da Feltre. During a three years&#x27; residence in Mantua where Vittorino held the celebrated humanistic school &quot;La Giocosa&quot;, he rapidly acquired a competent knowledge of Latin under his teaching, supporting himself meanwhile by giving lessons in Greek, and by copying manuscripts of the ancient classics.

In 1447 he became professor of Greek in the newly founded University of Ferrara, to which students in great numbers from all parts of Italy were soon attracted by his fame as a teacher. His students there included Rodolphus Agricola. He had taken some part in the councils which were held in Siena (1423), Ferrara (1438), and Florence (1439), with the object of bringing about a reconciliation between the Greek and Latin Churches; and in 1450, at the invitation of Pope Nicholas V, he went to Rome, where he was for some years employed by his patron in making Latin translations from Aristotle and other Greek authors. In Rome, he continued his teaching activities: it was reported that on one occasion Pope Sixtus IV commissioned Gaza to translate Aristotle&#x27;s works into Latin, with the pay of a number of gold pieces; however on receiving the pay Gaza was insulted at the amount paid, and furiously cast the money into the Tiber river. Amongst his students were fellow Byzantine Greeks Demetrius Chalcondyles, a leading scholar of the Renaissance period and Andronicus Callistus, a cousin of Theodore Gaza&#x27;s.

After the death of Nicholas (1455), being unable to make a living at Rome, Gaza removed to Naples, where he enjoyed the patronage of Alphonso the Magnanimous for two years (1456–1458). Shortly afterwards he was appointed by Cardinal Bessarion to a benefice in Calabria, where the later years of his life were spent, and where he died about 1475 and was buried in the Basilian monastery of San Giovanni a Piro. After Gaza&#x27;s death he was remembered by renaissance writers and praised for his skills; a letter written to Pope Sixtus IV by Ermolao Barbaro in 1480 includes a detailed appraisal of Gaza&#x27;s translating abilities:

In the campaign waged by Plethon against Aristotelianism he contributed his share to the defence. His influence on humanists was considerable, in the success with which he taught Greek language and literature. At Ferrara he founded an academy to offset the influence of the Platonic academy founded by Plethon at Florence.

==Works==
His translations were superior, both in accuracy and style, to the versions in use before his time. He devoted particular attention to the translation and exposition of Aristotle&#x27;s works on natural science.

Gaza stood high in the opinion of most of his learned contemporaries, but still higher in that of the scholars of the succeeding generation. His Greek grammar (in four books), written in Greek, first printed at Venice in 1495, and afterwards partially translated by Erasmus in 1521, although in many respects defective, especially in its syntax, was for a long time the leading textbook. His translations into Latin were very numerous, including:

*&quot;Problemata&quot;, &quot;De partibus animalium&quot; and &quot;De generatione animalium&quot; of Aristotle
*the &quot;Historia Plantarum&quot; of Theophrastus
*the &quot;Problemata&quot; of Alexander of Aphrodisias
*the &quot;De instruendis aciebus&quot; of Aelian
*the &quot;De compositione verborum&quot; of Dionysius of Halicarnassus
*some of the &quot;Homilies&quot; of John Chrysostom.

He also turned into Greek Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De senectute&quot; and &quot;Somnium Scipionis&quot; with much success, in the opinion of Erasmus; with more elegance than exactitude, according to the colder judgment of modern scholars. He was the author also of two small treatises entitled &quot;De mensibus&quot; and &quot;De origine Turcarum&quot;.

The flowering plant genus &quot;Gazania&quot;, of southern Africa, is named after him.

<text>In English slang, a Croydon facelift (sometimes council house facelift, or in Northern Ireland a Millie facelift) is a particular hairstyle worn by some women. The hair is pulled back tightly and tied in a bun or ponytail at the back. The supposed result is that the skin of the forehead and face are pulled up and back, producing the effects of a facelift.

Traction alopecia, a type of gradual hair loss, can result from hairstyles that tightly pull the hair in this manner.

This hairstyle is frequently portrayed in the media as belonging to young women from the lower social classes, particularly the Chav subculture (&quot;Ned&quot; in Scotland, &quot;Millie&quot; in Northern Ireland). The term is thus considered derogatory because it portrays people from Croydon as being lower class. &quot;Croydon&quot; can be replaced by the name of any other unfashionable residential area. 

The &quot;Croydon Guardian&quot; newspaper jokingly suggested that the style may have originated with the ancient Egyptian Queen Nefertiti.

<doc id="533352" wikidata="Q3124026" url="?curid=533352" title="Culture of Saudi Arabia">
<text>The cultural setting of Saudi Arabia is greatly influenced by the Arab and Islamic culture. The society is, in general, deeply religious, conservative, traditional, and family-oriented. Many attitudes and traditions are centuries-old, derived from Arab civilization and Islamic heritage. However, its culture has also been affected by rapid change, as the country was transformed from an impoverished nomadic society into a rich commodity producer in just a few years in the 1970s. This change has also been affected by and the result of a number of factors including the communications revolution and external scholarships. The most recent ruler or king of Saudi is King Salman of Saudi Arabia.

The Wahhabi Islamic movement, which arose in the 18th century and is sometimes described as austerely puritanical, now predominates in the country. Following the principle of &quot;enjoining good and forbidding wrong&quot;, there are many limitations and prohibitions on behavior and dress which are strictly enforced both legally and socially, often more so than in other Muslim countries. However, many of the traditional restrictions have been lifted recently by the government including allowing women to drive and many other female-related issues. On the other hand, the things prohibited by Islam are banned in the country, for example, alcoholic beverages are strictly prohibited.

Daily life is dominated by Islamic observance. Five times each day, Muslims are called to prayer from the minarets of mosques scattered throughout the country. Because Friday is the holiest day for Muslims, the weekend is Friday to Saturday. In accordance with Islamic doctrine, only two religious holidays, &quot;Eid al-Fitr&quot; and &quot;Eid al-Adha&quot;, were publicly recognized, until 2006 when a non-religious holiday, the September 23 national holiday (which commemorates the unification of the kingdom) was reintroduced. In terms of gender relations, Saudi Arabia&#x27;s norms usually discourage non-familial free mixing between the sexes.

==History==
The area of modern-day Saudi Arabia formerly consisted of mainly four distinct historical regions: Hejaz, Najd and parts of Eastern Arabia (Al-Ahsa), and Southern Arabia (&#x27;Asir). It was founded in 1932 by Abdulaziz bin Abdul Rahman, also known as Ibn Saud in Western countries. Abdulaziz united the four regions into a single state through a series of conquests beginning in 1902 with the capture of Riyadh, the ancestral home of his family. Saudi Arabia has since been an absolute monarchy governed along Islamist lines. Saudi Arabia is sometimes called &quot;the Land of the Two Holy Mosques&quot;, in reference to Al-Masjid al-Haram (in Mecca) and Al-Masjid an-Nabawi (in Medina), the two holiest places in Islam. 

==Religion==
The land of Hijaz, particularly Mecca and Medina, is the place where Islam was firstly established. Thus, the majority of its population are Muslims. Moreover, Qur’an is considered the constitution of Saudi Arabia and the Islamic law &quot;sharia’&quot; is the main legal source. In Saudi Arabia, Islam is not just adhered politically by the government but also it has a great influence on the people&#x27;s culture and everyday life.

=== Religious demography ===

90% of the Saudi citizens are Sunni Muslims while 10% belong to Shia&#x27;s school. 80% of Shia’ are Twelvers who live in the Eastern province of Saudi Arabia and Medina. In Najran Province there are approximately 700,000 seveners Shia’. Moreover, the majority of expatriate in Saudi Arabia are Muslims.

====Islamic rituals in the community====
Unlike many other Muslim countries, Saudi Arabia has been following a strict version of Islam. The &quot;Sharia&quot; (Islamic law) is enforced by the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (also known as &quot;Haia&quot; or &quot;Mutaween&quot;), who patrol the streets &quot;enjoining good and forbidding wrong&quot;. Rules include dress codes, strict separation of men and women, attendance at prayer (&quot;salat&quot;) five times each day, and a strict ban of alcohol, and segregation of men and women in universities. Saudi Arabia is the only Muslim country where shops and other public facilities are required to close during prayer time which takes place five times a day and employees and customers are sent off to pray.

Women are required to wear the traditional ”abaya” (long, fully covered dress). However, women are no longer required to wear abayas in public but are required to dress modestly as a form of respecting the Saudi culture.

Cinema theatres were shut down in 1980, for example. However, Saudi Arabia has reopened cinema theaters since April 2018.

==== Calendar ====
The kingdom uses not the international Gregorian calendar, but the lunar Islamic calendar, with the start of each lunar month determined not ahead of time by astronomical calculation, but only after the crescent moon is sighted by the proper religious authorities. Civil workers in the governmental sector used to receive their salaries not according to the international Gregorian calendar, but the lunar Islamic calendar. However, the Gregorian calendar has been followed by many international companies operating in the country. Moreover, by 2016, a number of reforms took place in Saudi Arabia. One of them was to use the Gregorian calendar to pay for the civil servants. This measure has been taken to reduce the governmental spending as employees have lost 11 payment days.

Weekends

Friday is the holiest day for Muslims. Thus, the weekend in Saudi Arabia was Thursday-Friday. In 2013, the late King Abdullah Al-Saud issued a royal decree switching the weekend to become on Friday-Saturday. This step was taken to reduce the adverse effects suffered by Saudi businesses due to the difference in weekdays and weekends between Saudi Arabia and the other regional and international counterparts. Like all other Muslims, on Fridays Saudis attend Jomua’h prayer that is held by afternoon and accompanied with a sermon.

The holy month of Ramadan

Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, is a holy month for all Muslims. In Saudi Arabia, this month is especially important and different as the lifestyle of the people gets more spiritual. During the month, Muslims fast from dawn to dusk. Thus, in Saudi Arabia, the working hours are reduced as most of the employees go two hours later than usual. Moreover, friends and families gather by sunset to enjoy breaking their fast together. By night and particularly after the obligatory Isha’ prayer, people stay in mosques to pray the voluntary prayer of Taraweeh. Before the dawn prayer, Fajr, families wake up to eat Suhur, their last meal before they start fasting.

Saudi Arabia celebrates two public holidays, namely, &quot;Eid al-Fitr&quot; and &quot;Eid al-Adha&quot;. &quot;Eid al-Fitr&quot; comes after the holy month of Ramadan and employees enjoy a customary 5 to 10 days away from work. &quot;Eid al-Adha&quot; comes by the end of Hajj -pilgrimage- and employees get similar off days. However, some other religious days that are considered as public holidays in other Muslim countries are not given days off in Saudi Arabia including, the Islamic New Year, Mawlid Alnabi – Prophet Muhammad&#x27;s Birthday – and ‘Ashura day.

&quot;Fierce religious resistance&quot; had to be overcome to permit such innovations as paper money (in 1951), female education (1964), and television (1965) and the abolition of slavery (1962). There were a number of terrorist attacks targeting foreigners between 2001 and 2004, but these have been brought under control.

Public support for the traditional political/religious structure of the kingdom is so strong that one researcher interviewing Saudis found virtually no support for reforms to secularize the state. Even the small minority of Westernized and liberal Saudis expressed &quot;a desire for the kingdom to remain a Muslim society ruled by an overtly Muslim state.&quot;

Because of religious restrictions, Saudi culture lacks any diversity of religious expression or buildings but annual festivals such as the Janadriah Festival which celebrates Saudi Culture, custom and handicraft held in a specialized arena just north of Riyadh and public events such as The Annual Book Fair are open to the public and are very popular although policed by the religious police.

The festivals (such as Day of Ashura) and communal public worship of Shia Muslims who make up an estimated 10-15% are suppressed. Celebration of other (non-Wahhabi) Islamic holidays, such as the Muhammad&#x27;s birthday and the Day of Ashura (an important holiday for Shiites), are tolerated only when celebrated locally and on a small scale. Shia also face systematic discrimination in employment, education, the justice system according to Human Rights Watch.

No churches, temples or other non-Muslim houses of worship permitted in the country (although there are nearly a million Christians as well as Hindus and Buddhists among the foreign workers). Foreign workers are not allowed to celebrate Christmas or Easter, and reportedly private prayer services are forbidden in practice.
And at least one religious minority, the Ahmadiyya, are banned with adherents being deported according to a 2007 report by Human Rights Watch.

Proselytizing by non-Muslims and conversion by Muslims to another religion is illegal. According to the HeartCry Missionary Society, in 2014 the Saudi government &quot;issued an official statement signifying that capital punishment may now be used&quot; on those who distribute the Bible and all other &quot;publications that have prejudice to any other religious belief other than Islam.&quot;

In legal compensation court cases (&quot;Diyya&quot;) non-Muslim are awarded less than Muslims. Atheists are legally designated as terrorists.

==Social life and customs==
Saudi society lives within the circle of customs and traditions in which it was ingrained by the Arab culture of Islam and the Islamic culture, but the regions of the Kingdom differ from each other in the customs of clothing, food, dialects, songs, and even in marriage traditions. Saudi Arabia has a family-oriented culture; the family in Saudi Arabia is the most important social institution, so the bonds are strong between their members. Key aspects include the concepts of obedience and mutual respect, in addition to preserving family traditions and kinship ties.

=== Al Badou ===
A large portion of the original inhabitants of the area that is now Saudi were desert nomads known as Bedouin. They remain a significant and very influential minority of the indigenous Saudi population, though many who call themselves &quot;bedou&quot; no longer engage in &quot;traditional tribal activities of herding sheep and riding camels.&quot; According to authors Harvey Tripp and Peter North, Bedouin make up most of the judiciary, religious leaders and National Guard (which protects the throne) of the country. Bedouin culture is &quot;actively&quot; preserved by the government.

===Greetings===
Greetings in Saudi Arabia have been called &quot;formal and proscribed&quot; and lengthy. Saudis (men) tend &quot;to take their time and converse for a bit when meeting.&quot; Inquiries &quot;about health and family&quot; are customary, but never about a man&#x27;s wife, as this &quot;is considered disrespectful.&quot;
Saudi men are known for the physical affection they express towards total strangers (i.e. Saudi male strangers), thought by some to be a continuation of the desert tradition of offering strangers hospitality to ensure their survival.

=== Dress ===
The religion and customs of Saudi Arabia dictate not only conservative dress for men and women, but a uniformity of dress unique to most of the Middle East. Traditionally, the different regions of Saudi have had different dress, but since the re-establishment of Saudi rule these have been reserved for festive occasions, and &quot;altered if not entirely displaced&quot; by the dress of the homeland of their rulers (i.e. Najd).

Many women normally wear an &quot;abaya&quot;, a long black cloak that covers all but the hands and face in public despite this not being required. (Modest dress is compulsory for women in Islam but the color black for women and white for men is apparently based on tradition not religious scripture.) Some Saudi women wear a full face veil, such as a &quot;niqāb&quot; or a burqa. Women&#x27;s clothes are often decorated with tribal motifs, coins, sequins, metallic thread, and appliques. Saudi Arabia has recently relaxed the dress code for women.

The women of Saudi Arabia continue to wear the abaya in all its forms as a sign of modesty and identity. Although it is no longer mandatory, women choose to wear it, and it has become one of the most popular images of the country. Foreign women visiting the country also choose to wear the abaya, as a sign of respect.

In recent years it is common to wear Western dress underneath the &quot;abaya&quot;. (Foreign women in Saudi Arabia are &quot;encouraged&quot; by the religious police to wear an &quot;abaya&quot;, or at least cover their hair according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Authors Harvey Tripp and Peter North encourage women to wear an abaya in &quot;more conservative&quot; areas of the kingdom, i.e. in the interior.)
Saudi men and boys, whatever their job or social status, wear the traditional dress called a &quot;thawb&quot;, which has been called the &quot;Arabic dress&quot;. During warm and hot weather, Saudi men and boys wear white thobes. During the cool weather, wool thobes in dark colors are not uncommon. At special times, men often wear a &quot;bisht&quot; or &quot;mishlah&quot; over the thobe. These are long white, brown or black cloaks trimmed in metallic thread. A man&#x27;s headdress consists of three things: the &quot;tagia&quot;, a small white cap that keeps the &quot;gutra&quot; from slipping off the head; the &quot;gutra&quot; itself, which is a large square of cloth; and the &quot;igal&quot;, a doubled black cord that holds the &quot;gutra&quot; in place. Not wearing an igal is considered a sign of piety. The gutra is usually made of cotton and traditionally is either all white or a red and white checked. The gutra is worn folded into a triangle and centred on the head.
* &quot;Ghutrah&quot; () is a traditional &quot;keffiyeh&quot; headdress worn by men in the Arabian peninsula. It is made of a square of usually finer cotton cloth (&quot;scarf&quot;), folded and wrapped in various styles (usually a triangle) around the head. It is commonly worn in areas with an arid climate, to provide protection from direct sun exposure, and also protection of the mouth and eyes from blown dust and sand.
* &quot;Agal&quot; () is an item of Arab headgear constructed of cord which is fastened around the keffiyeh to hold it in place. The &quot;agal&quot; is usually black in colour.
* &quot;Thawb&quot; () is the standard Arabic word for garment. It is ankle length, woven from wool or cotton, usually with long sleeves similar to a robe.
* &quot;Bisht&quot; () is a traditional long, white, brown or black Arabic cloak trimmed in gold worn by men. It is usually only worn for prestige on special occasions such as weddings, or in chilly weather.
* &quot;Abaya&quot; () is a women&#x27;s garment. It is a black cloak which loosely covers the entire body except the head, although some Abayas cover the top of the head as well. Recent years have shown a rise in more colored abayas.

Among young men, since around 2000, Western dress, particularly T-shirts and jeans have become quite common leisure wear, particularly in the Eastern Province. Traditional footwear has been leather sandals but most footwear is now imported.

===Work===
Employment does not play the same part in native Saudi society as in some others. With enormous petroleum export earnings beginning in the mid-1970s the Saudi economy was not dependent on income from productive employment. Economists &quot;estimate only 30–40 percent&quot; of working-age Saudis &quot;hold jobs or actively seek work,&quot; and most employed Saudis have less-than-demanding jobs with the government.

As of 2008, 90% of those employed in the private sector were foreigners, and several decades long efforts to replace significant numbers of them with Saudis have been unsuccessful.

One explanation for this culture of leisure is the hot, dry climate of the peninsula which allowed nomadic herding but permitted agriculture only in a small area (the southwest corner). Like other nomadic herders worldwide, the ancestors of most Saudis did not develop the habits (so-called &quot;work ethic&quot;), skills, infrastructure, etc. of agricultural societies &quot;that lead ultimately to present-day industrialisation&quot;. As a consequence, &quot;Saudis have rarely worked in the sense that other nationalities have worked. No product-based commercial economy existed until oil&quot; was discovered.

===Socializing===
Traditionally social life in the kingdom has revolved around the home and family. Saudis regularly visit family members, particularly those of an older generation. For women, most of whom have their own jobs, it is routine (in fact the only outside activity) to pay visits to each other during the day. The ban on women driving was lifted in 2017.

For men, traditional hours involve a nap in late afternoon (after work if they are employed), and then socializing that begins after maghrib (roughly between 5 and 6:30 pm) and can last until well after midnight. Men gather in groups (known as &quot;shillas&quot; or &quot;majmu&#x27;as&quot;) of close friends of similar age, background, and occupation. Men typically relax, and joke while smoking &quot;shisha&quot; and playing balot (a card game), and have a meal around midnight before returning home. The groups may meet in &quot;diwaniyyas&quot; in each other&#x27;s homes or a residence rented for the occasion.

===Families===
Being part of a reserved, family-oriented society, Saudis tend to prefer to do business with, socialize with, and communicate with family members rather than outsiders, be they foreigners, or Saudis from other clans. Extended families tend to live in family compounds in cities whenever possible and stay in contact by cellphone when not. It is customary for elder family member to use their influence (&quot;wasta&quot;) for the benefit of family members, particularly for employment and advancement in the large Saudi government bureaucracy where most Saudis work.

===Marriage===

Traditionally, in Saudi Arabia (and other Gulf countries), families arrange marriages with the tribe or family&#x27;s considerations in mind. Forced marriage has also taken place. Sons and daughters have been encouraged to &quot;marry cousins or other relatives in order to increase and strengthen&quot; the extended family or tribe,
&quot;or occasionally to marry into another tribe in order to heal rifts&quot;. At least in the 1990s, most marriages in Saudi were &quot;consanguineous&quot;—i.e. between close relatives—sometimes a second cousin but usually a first cousin. and marriage between cousins in Saudi is among the highest rate in the world. The practice has been cited as a factor in higher rates of Type 2 diabetes (which affects about 32% of adult Saudis), hypertension (which affects 33%), and higher rates of severe genetic diseases like cystic fibrosis or a blood disorder,
thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, spinal muscular atrophy, deafness and muteness.
As a consequence of frequent consanguineous marriage, genetic counseling is a growing field in Saudi Arabia.

Traditionally men having more than one wife (polygyny) was &quot;fairly common&quot;, but marriage has become increasingly monogamous as income has declined and western ideas of mutual compatibility between husband and wife have taken hold.

====Steps of marriage====
* Proposal: traditionally, the prospective groom&#x27;s senior female leader informs the prospective bride&#x27;s mother of his intentions. . . both families determine whether or not the marriage would be suitable.
* Viewing (&quot;Shawfa&quot;): if assent is given by the two families, the bride is &quot;formally allowed to unveil in the presence of the future husband.&quot; This unveiling is delayed until the wedding party among very strict families.
* Marriage contract (&quot;Milka&quot;): if the viewing does not stop wedding plans, the amount of the dowery (&quot;mahr&quot;) and other terms are negotiated by the prospective groom and the father (or legal male guardian) of the prospective bride, and are executed (approved) usually by the imam of a mosque and witnessed by two male witnesses (or one man and two women) and recorded by a &quot;qadi&quot;. 
* Meeting of the families (&quot;Shabka&quot;): this is a &quot;gala&quot; party of both families, hosted by the bride&#x27;s family, at which time the bridegroom presents the dowry and an engagement ring to the bride along with other gifts of jewelry.
* Betrothal (&quot;Makhtui&quot;, &quot;Khatub&quot;, or &quot;Makhtubayn&quot;): &quot;setting the date&quot; for the wedding parties (one for men and one for women) is &quot;considered the formal betrothal.&quot;
* Henna party or ‘Night of the Henna’, is a party based around decorating the hands and feet of the bride with paste made from the henna plant. This is not a mandatory step in Marriage, it is optional, and often rare to happen in the recent years of Saudi Arabia. The occasion stems from South Asian traditions.
* Wedding celebrations (&quot;`Irs&quot;, &quot;Zaffaf&quot;, or &quot;Zawaj&quot;): usually comes six months to a year after the acceptance of the wedding proposal or based on their agreement. The separate wedding celebrations for men and women are attended by family, close friends and distinguished guests. Traditionally they were held in homes, but today are usually held in large hotel ballrooms or special wedding halls. Each party usually consists of a large dinner featuring roast lamb or baby camel over rice or cracked wheat served on the floor, that begins after &quot;`Isha`&quot;. A traditional congratulatory phrase the guests tell the groom is &#x27;from you the money; from her the children.&#x27; The men&#x27;s party ends after the dinner, but the bridegroom and the male members of his and the bride&#x27;s immediate family then go to the women&#x27;s party. The women&#x27;s party lasts longer than the men&#x27;s, is more elaborately decorated, and in addition to food, has music, singing, and dancing. Around midnight, the bridegroom and the other family male members arrive and are announced amidst the ululation or &quot;zaghārīt&quot; (high keening sound) of the women. The other men then leave, but the groom sits beside his bride on a dais while the party continues. Some wedding celebrations can go on for several days, but the groom need attend only the first night. After all the celebrations, the couple is traditionally escorted to their new home, or leave on their honeymoon. In some weddings, the couple meet for the first time on the final night of celebrations. On their return from the honeymoon if they have one, the couple either set up home with the groom&#x27;s parents and &quot;become members of the extended family or, as is increasingly the case, set up home by themselves&quot;.

====Divorce====
Saudi Arabia allows the traditional practice of &quot;triple talaq&quot; divorce, where a man can divorce his wife simply by saying ‘I divorce you’ (&quot;ṭalāq&quot;) three times. He can rescind the divorce if this was done in the heat of the moment, but only if the wife agrees (and only on three occasions). The husband must maintain a divorced wife and any children from the marriage if the wife is unable to support herself, although she may have trouble receiving timely payments. Children generally remain with their mother until about five or six, after which boys return to their father to begin their formal education. The husband can claim custody of any sons when they reach the age of ten. Girls more often remain with their mother. A female divorcee usually returns to her family, and few remarry. Despite the liberality of divorce laws, divorce is not commonplace outside of the royal family where it is &quot;endemic&quot;.)

Divorce for women who have been abandoned by their husbands in Saudi Arabia has been criticized for being slow.
Divorce initiated by a wife (&quot;khula&quot;) is unusual in the kingdom even if a husband has been unfaithful, abused or deserted his wife, or engaged in criminal activity.
For female initiated divorce in Saudi, a wife must go to a court for the case to be heard.

====LGBT rights====
Saudi is one of ten countries where homosexuality is punishable by death (the punishment of stoning to death may be applied to married men who&#x27;ve engaged in homosexual acts or any non-Muslim married or unmarried who commits homosexual acts with a Muslim) as well as fines, flogging, prison time, on first offense. In April 2020, the Saudi Supreme Court abolished the flogging punishment, and replaced it with jail time or fines or both.

===Other customs===
As in other Arab and especially Gulf countries, Saudi customs include avoiding certain practices, such as:
* anything that would cause someone (or at least another Saudi) embarrassment and loss of face; (criticism by outsiders must be delivered indirectly, circumspectly, and never in front of others)
* exposing the soles of the feet or footwear to someone; (other insulting body language include upward raising of a single finger, excessive pointing, fist clenching and pounding of the right fist into the left palm)
* using the left hand when eating (that hand traditionally being used for personal hygiene)
* rushing into doing business before conversation and the drinking of tea and coffee (violation of a desert code of hospitality, a code stemming from the recognition that a desert traveler who is denied hospitality might not survive)
* admiring a movable possession of a Saudi, since a hospitable Saudi will feel obliged to offer the possession as a gift to the guest admirer
* saying ‘Salam Alaikum’ when entering anywhere with another person there or not.
* Marketplace bargaining: it is expected to negotiate the prices of goods and services, and is not frowned upon in these places.
* Proverbs and sayings are frequently said, conveying wisdom, values, and life lessons.
* Coffee and Date combination: The combination of Saudi coffee and dates is a standard among get gatherings, and social settings, especially within the Bedioun tribes.
* A designated seat for the guest at a dinner party- usually next to the ‘best part’ of the food. Also not leaving dinner until the guest has finished eating.
* Big part of Saudi Arabian culture - Insisting. Insisting to stay more, eat more, etc.. from the other party as a sign of respect and appreciation.
* Returning Favors - a feeling of needing to owe someone because they have granted you something.

Observers have noted the importance of custom and tradition in Saudi society. Folk beliefs such as &quot;which foot to step first into the bathroom with, or urinating on the wheel of a new car to ward off the evil eye,&quot; hold an important place.

Older brothers—even if older by only a few days—should have their hand kissed by younger brothers, sit above them on formal occasions, enter a room before them.

Women who go on even short trips of a few days are expected to visit senior relatives and even close neighbors to bid them goodbye, and upon returning, make another round of visits to the same individuals to pay her respects and dispense small gifts. Saudis may &quot;require four to six months&quot; to check their plans with extended family before finalizing them.

One observer has noted that &quot;through their love of language, Saudis are swayed more by words rather than ideas and more by ideas than facts.&quot; While vigorous public arguments (&quot;shouting matches&quot;) may be commonplace, it &quot;is most unusual to see a Saudi strike another Saudi.&quot; This emphasis on rhetoric is reflected in foreign affairs where, for example, the government &quot;regularly condemns the State of Israel in the most vehement and bloodcurdling terms but rarely takes action.&quot;

Wasta: A term that refers to the use of connections and relationships to gain benefits and advantages. It is evident all around the world, but specifically in the Middle East. Key features of Wasta can include negotiations and contracts, better employment opportunities, and social ties. The Wasta culture in Saudi Arabia can connect to their family orientedness with extended family, as someone would always want something to be easier if a connection is present.

==Physical environment==
Many outsiders are struck by the superficial resemblance of Saudi cities (at least the major cities such as Jeddah, Riyadh and the eastern province), with their superhighways, shopping malls and fast food, to those of post-World War II western cities and suburbs.

===Urbanization===
As late as 1970, most Saudis lived a subsistence life in the rural provinces, but the kingdom has urbanized rapidly in the last half of the 20th century. As of 2012 about 80% of Saudis live in urban metropolitan areas, specifically Riyadh, Jeddah, or Dammam.

===Housing===
Saudi houses and housing compounds are often noted for the high walls (3 or 4 metres high) surrounding them, explained as useful in keeping out sandstorms and/or reflective of the families&#x27; self-contained outlook on the world.

===Style and decoration===
Like many people throughout the world, many Saudis derive &quot;much pleasure and pride&quot; in their homes. Saudis enjoy decorating rooms of their homes in &quot;all the colours of the spectrum&quot; and display objets d&#x27;art of many different styles together. &quot;Clashes of colour and culture are the norm, not the exception,&quot; with the value of an artefact, &quot;rather than consistency of style&quot; being the major criterion of display. Foreigners may also be struck by the lack of finishing touches in construction (&quot;Electrical switches may protrude from the wall supported only by their wiring&quot;) or maintenance (&quot;Piles of masonry are likely to lie scattered beside and on the streets of expensive suburbs&quot;).

===Islamic heritage sites===

Saudi Arabia, and specifically the Hejaz, as the cradle of Islam, has many of the most significant historic Muslim sites, including the two holiest sites of Mecca and Medina. One of the King&#x27;s titles is Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, the two mosques being Masjid al-Haram in Mecca (which contains Islam&#x27;s most sacred place, the Kaaba), and Al-Masjid al-Nabawi in Medina, which contains Muhammad&#x27;s tomb.

However, Saudi Wahhabism doctrine is hostile! to any reverence given to historical or religious places of significance for fear that it may give rise to &#x27;shirk&#x27; (that is, idolatry). As a consequence, under Saudi rule, an estimated 95% of Mecca&#x27;s historic buildings, most over a thousand years old, have been demolished for religious reasons. Critics claim that over the last 50 years, 300 historic sites linked to Muhammad, his family or companions have been lost, leaving fewer than 20 structures remaining in Mecca that date back to the time of Muhammad.

Demolished structures include the mosque originally built by Muhammad&#x27;s daughter Fatima, and other mosques founded by Abu Bakr (Muhammad&#x27;s father-in-law and the first Caliph), Umar (the second Caliph), Ali (Muhammad&#x27;s son-in-law and the fourth Caliph), and Salman al-Farsi (another of Muhammad&#x27;s companions). Other historic buildings that have been destroyed include the house of Khadijah, the wife of Muhammad, the house of Abu Bakr, now the site of the local Hilton hotel; the house of Ali-Oraid, the grandson of Muhammad, and the Mosque of abu-Qubais, now the location of the King&#x27;s palace in Mecca.

==Women, youth and foreigners==

===Women===

While women were forbidden to drive motor vehicles until June 24, 2018 and were consequently limited in mobility, they traditionally have often had considerable informal power in the home. According to journalist Judith Miller, &quot;some Saudi women were veritable tyrants in their own homes. They decided where their children would go to school, when and whom they would marry, whether their husbands would accept new jobs, with whom the family socialized, and where the family would live and spend vacations. They promoted their friends&#x27; husbands, sons and relatives to key jobs.&quot; David Long, a former American diplomat who had taught in the kingdom, has described Saudi men as &quot;the world&#x27;s most henpecked&quot;.

Outside the home, a number of Saudi women have risen to the top of some professions or otherwise achieved prominence; for example, Dr. Salwa Al-Hazzaa is head of the ophthalmology department at King Faisal Specialist Hospital in Riyadh and was the late King Fahad&#x27;s personal ophthalmologist. However employment for women is limited, and urban middle and upper-class women spend much time in socializing with the extended family and close friends. Writing in National Geographic Marrianne Alireza noted: &quot;For city women like us the only activity besides living communally within the extended family was leaving our quarters to visit other women in their quarters.&quot;

As of 2014, child marriage is still legal
but no longer common, with the average age at first marriage among Saudi females being 25 years old. However, in 2019 Members of the Saudi Shoura Council in 2019 approved fresh regulations for minor marriages that will see to outlaw marrying off 15-year-old children and force the need for court approval for those under 18. Chairman of the Human Rights Committee at the Shoura Council, Dr. Hadi Al-Yami, said that introduced controls were based on in-depth studies presented to the body. He pointed out that the regulation, vetted by the Islamic Affairs Committee at the Shoura Council, has raised the age of marriage to 18 and prohibited it for those under 15. Female literacy (81%) is lower than that of males, but the percentage of university graduates who are women (60%) is higher.

While the kingdom states that the status of women is &quot;a very noble and lofty one&quot;, according to leading Islamic scholars, women in Saudi do not have equal rights with men. Outside of Saudi, foreign sources have shown that discrimination of women is a significant problem and that there is an absence of laws criminalizing violence against women.
The World Economic Forum 2010 Global Gender Gap Report ranked Saudi Arabia 129th out of 134 countries for gender parity.
Under Saudi law, every adult female must have a male relative as her &quot;guardian&quot;, whose permission she is required to have in order to travel, study, or work. The guardian is legally entitled to make a number of critical decisions on a woman&#x27;s behalf. However, women above 18 will soon be allowed to travel abroad without taking their guardians permission as a new law is going to be enacted in this regard in 2019. In August 2019, the law has been already enacted and women above 21 are allowed to travel without a prior permission. The law came into effect at the end of August 2019.

In the courts, the testimony of a woman equals half of a man&#x27;s and the testimony of one man equals that of two women in family and inheritance law. Men are permitted up to four wives, but women are permitted no more than one husband. Men need no legal justification to unilaterally divorce their wives (talaq), while a woman can only obtain a divorce with the consent of her husband or judicially if her husband has harmed her. With regard to the law of inheritance, the Quran specifies that fixed portions of the deceased&#x27;s estate must be left to the &quot;Qu&#x27;ranic heirs&quot; and so daughters of the deceased will receive half of their brothers.

Saudi women&#x27;s lives are also shaped by Wahhabi religious policy of strict gender segregation. In health, obesity is a problem among middle and upper class Saudi women, who have domestic servants to do traditional work and have limited ability to leave their house. School sports for girls is forbidden, but as of April 2014, Saudi authorities in the education ministry have been asked by the Shoura Council to consider lifting that ban (with the proviso that any sports conform to Sharia rules on dress and gender segregation, according to the official SPA news agency).

In the public sphere restaurants have specially designated family sections women are required to use. They are also required to wear an abaya and at the very least cover their hair. Women, until June 2018 were forbidden to drive (though exception prior to 2018 were usually made in rural areas). (These restrictions are usually enforced by the &quot;religious police&quot;, known as the &quot;mutaween&quot;.) Women have been promised the vote in 2015 municipal elections.

===Youth===

Like many Muslim countries of the Middle East, Saudi Arabia has a high population growth rate and high percentage of its population under 30 years of age. Estimates of the young population of Saudi Arabia vary:
* Caryle Murphy gives the figure of 51% of the population being under the age of 25, as of February 2012.
* &quot;The Economist&quot; magazine estimates 60% of the Saudi population under the age of 21, as of March 2012.
* The &quot;United Nations, World Population Prospects: The 2012 Revision&quot; estimates only 28% of the population is under 14 years of age and significant change to Saudi culture is foreseen as this generation becomes older.
Factors such as the decline in per capita income from the failure of oil revenue to keep up with population growth, exposure to youth lifestyles of the outside world, lack of access to quality education and employment opportunity, change in child rearing practices and attitudes towards the ruling royal family—indicate their lives and level of satisfaction will be different than the generation before them.

In recent decades, child rearing in Saudi Arabia has increasingly been handled by hired servants.
Since foreign labour is cheap and common, even families of modest means usually have servants. In richer families, each child may have an individual servant.

However, unlike parents, servants can be fired/sacked and are often neither Muslims nor Arabs. Consequently, according to John R. Bradley, they both &quot;lack the authority... to discipline those in their care&quot;, and the ability and knowledge to &quot;pass down by example the core Islamic values and traditions that have always formed the bedrock of Saudi society.&quot;

Unlike their parents, who grew up during the oil boom of the 1970s and saw their standard of living rise from poverty to affluence, Saudis born &quot;in the 1980s and 1990s have no memory of the impoverished Arabia prior to the oil boom and thus express almost no sense of appreciation.&quot;

Instead, they have experienced a kingdom of poor schools, overcrowded universities, and declining job opportunities.. Moreover, their royal rulers&#x27; profligate and often non-Islamic lifestyles are increasingly transparent to Saudis and stand in sharp contrast both to Al Saud religious pretensions and to their own declining living standards.&quot;

Saudi youth are exposed to youth lifestyles of the outside world via the internet, as dating, and concerts are banned in their country. However, in 2017 concerts were no longer banned in Saudi Arabia. Public fields for soccer are scarce. Even shopping malls do not allow young men unless they are accompanied by a female relative.
As of 2014, men are no longer required to have a female relative to be able to enter shopping malls. Insofar as young people have a tendency to &quot;resent authority, reject rules, and seek to exert their independence,&quot; youth rebellion is more problematic because the number of &quot;restrictions and conventions against which youth can rebel&quot; in the kingdom is far larger than in most societies. The average age of the king and crown prince is 74, while 50–60% of Saudis are under twenty, creating a significant generation gap between rulers and ruled.

In a 2011 survey, 31% of Saudi youth agreed with the statement `traditional values are outdated and ... I am keen to embrace modern values and beliefs`—the highest percentage in the ten Arab countries surveyed.
The number who had confidence about the direction of their country dropped from 98% (in 2010) to 62%.
While in most societies these numbers might seem unremarkable, in Saudi Arabia any rebellion stands out against &quot;the unquestioning acceptance ... of previous generations&quot;.

Nearly two-thirds of university graduates earn degrees in Islamic subjects,
where job prospects are in the public sector, dependent on government revenues. However, funding for public sector may decline not expand in coming years. At least some experts expect the kingdom&#x27;s expenditures to &quot;exceed its oil revenues as soon as 2014.&quot;

Unemployment among 20- to 24-year-olds is 39% – 45% for women and 30.3% for men—compared to an official unemployment rate of 10% circa 2012.

====Tafheet====

The sport of &quot;Tafheet&quot; also called &quot;drifting&quot; or joyriding—illegal street racing-like phenomenon of generally non-modified factory-setup rental cars at very high speeds, around , across wide highways throwing the car left and right that is especially popular in the margins of society—has been noted by observers. A 2004 school survey carried out in the kingdom&#x27;s three biggest cities found that 45% of teenage boys were involved to some degree in joyriding.
The sport has been described as &quot;tyre-burning acrobatics often in stolen or &#x27;borrowed&#x27; cars before a flash-mob of youthful admirers.&quot; As a dangerous, illegal, and unregulated activity, crashes and fatalities sometimes occur.

===Foreigners===

Since the 1960s there has been a significant number of guest workers/foreign expatriates allowed into Saudi on work visas, and these now make up around 20–30% of the population of the country. Guest workers range in occupation from high skilled workers (employed to do jobs Saudis cannot do), to manual service workers (doing jobs Saudis &quot;will not do&quot;). A number of sources describe a &quot;pecking order&quot; among workers established by factors such as the importance of your employer, and country of origin. One source places workers from Gulf oil producing countries at the top, another places Americans there, but all agree that Nationals from places like Bangladesh, Yemen and Philippines are at the bottom. While foreign workers from Western countries are now a small minority, numbering only approximately 100,000, most of whom live in compounds or gated communities.

With a large number of unemployed Saudis, a growing population and need for government spending but stagnating oil revenues with which to pay foreign workers, the large number of expats has come to be seen as &quot;an enormous problem&quot; that &quot;distorts&quot; the Saudi economy and &quot;keeps young people out of the labor market.&quot;

In October 2011, the Saudi Labour Ministry put a &quot;ceiling&quot; on the number of guest workers at 20% of the Saudi population, requiring a reduction of foreign population by up to three million over several years.
In March 2013, a campaign was initiated to &quot;get rid of its illegal foreign workers, control the legal ones&quot;, and lower native-born Saudi unemployment. Approximately one million Bangladeshis, Indians, Filipinos, Nepalis, Pakistanis and Yemenis left between the campaign&#x27;s beginning and the deadline (November 4, 2013), with authorities planning to expel another one million illegal foreigners in 2014. Ethiopians were a particular target of the campaign, with thousands expelled. Various human rights entities have criticised Saudi Arabia&#x27;s handling of the issue. Prior to this workers were sometimes not hired or expelled as a way of registering Saudi disapproval of the workers&#x27; country. Saudi Arabia expelled 800,000 Yemenis in 1990 and 1991 during the Gulf War due to Yemen&#x27;s support for Saddam Hussein against Saudi Arabia, and cut the number of Bangladeshis allowed to enter Saudi in 2013 after the Bangladeshi government cracked down on the Islamist Jamaat-e Islami party there.

The Saudi–Yemen barrier was constructed by Saudi Arabia against an influx of illegal immigrants and against the smuggling of drugs and weapons.
A 2004 law passed by Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Council of Ministers, entitles Muslim expatriates of all nationalities (except Palestinian) who have resided in the kingdom for ten years to apply for citizenship with priority being given to holders of degrees in various scientific fields. (The estimated 240,000 Palestinians living in Saudi Arabia are excluded, because of Arab League agreement instructions barring the Arab states from granting them citizenship of another Arab state.)

Treatment of foreign workers is also an issue. According to Human Rights Watch, as of 2014, there was a &quot;worrying trend&quot; of expatriate domestic workers filing &quot;complaints of exploitation and abuse&quot; only to face counter-allegations by their employers of &quot;theft, witchcraft or adultery.&quot; 41 expat workers from just one country, Indonesia, faced &quot;possible death sentences&quot; in Saudi Arabia on charges &quot;ranging from black magic to stealing, adultery and murder&quot;.

In 2014 Saudi men were banned from marrying women from Bangladesh, Pakistan, Myanmar and Chad.

===Legacy of slavery===

The history of slavery in the Arabian Peninsula goes back hundreds of years, but with time the racism of slavery in the Arabian Peninsula disappeared. Slavery was banned in 1962 and was succeeded by the kafala system.

==Food and drink==
Today, Saudis follow many of their traditional habits, especially in food and drinks. As many Saudis are originally descended from tribes of sheep and goat herders, many Saudi dishes are mainly made of sheep meat.

Saudi Arabian cuisine is similar to that of the surrounding countries in the Arabian Peninsula and has been heavily influenced by Turkish, Persian, and African food. Animals are slaughtered in accordance with halal Islamic dietary laws, which consider pork forbidden (&quot;haram&quot;) and alcohol forbidden (&quot;haram&quot;). As a general rule, Saudis (like other Muslims) consider impure pork to be disgusting, but forbidden alcohol a temptation. Consequently, dietary laws regarding the former are more strictly observed than those regarding the latter.

=== Religious limitations ===
People of Saudi Arabia are restricted by the religious norms related to food and drink. Thus, alcohol is prohibited in Islam and, accordingly, it is prevented in the country. Furthermore, pork is also prohibited and Saudis do not eat it. Nevertheless, cows, sheep, chicken and other types of animals can&#x27;t be eaten unless they are slaughtered according to the Islamic law.

===Cuisine===

A dish consisting of a stuffed lamb, known as &quot;khūzī&quot;, is the traditional national dish. Kebabs are popular, as is &quot;shāwarmā&quot;, a marinated grilled meat dish of lamb, mutton, or chicken, sometimes wrapped in flat bread. As in other Arab countries of the Arabian Peninsula, &quot;machbūs&quot; (kabsa), a rice dish with fish or shrimp, is popular. Flat, unleavened bread is a staple of virtually every meal, as are dates and fresh fruit. Coffee, served in the Arabic style, is the traditional beverage.

The appearance of modern supermarkets and commercial restaurants starting in the 1970s has changed Saudi culinary habits. International cuisine, particularly fast food, has become popular in all Saudi urban areas (i.e. in 80% of the country).
While traditionally Saudis ate sitting on the floor using the right hand or flat bread to take food from a roasted lamb, goat or camel carcass, the practice of eating while sitting on a chair at a table has become more standard practice, if not the use of knives and forks.

;Table manners

Coffee is often served &quot;with great ceremony&quot;, and it is customary for a person to drink two or three cups to indicate their approval of the coffee. Cups are refilled unless a gesture—shaking the cup—is made to indicate the coffee-drinker has had enough. It is considered good manners for a guest to eat heartily.

=== Food sources ===
Saudi Arabia is a deserted country where many oases can be found. Accordingly, over 18 million date palms are planted in the country and 600 million pounds of dates are produced every year. Thus, dates are considered one of the main and permanent fruits in Saudi Arabia, particularly in Ramadan when dates are eaten in sunset by fasters to break their fast. Additionally, dates are eaten as a snack and many Saudi desserts are made of dates. Besides dates, numerous kinds of foodstuffs are planted in Saudi Arabia, including wheat, rice, beans, watermelon and others. Animals, such as goats, sheep, cows and camels are also nurtured in the country.

== News media ==

Educated Saudis are well-informed of issues of the Arab world, the Islamic world, and the world at large, but freedom of the press and public expression of opinion are not recognized by the government. The Basic Law of Saudi Arabia states that the media&#x27;s role is to educate and inspire national unity, and are prohibited from acts that lead &quot;to disorder and division&quot;. News stories, public speeches and other acts of personal expression cannot conflict with traditional Islamic values, or dissent from government policy, insult government officials, especially the royal family, and cannot delve too deeply into certain sensitive and taboo subject matters that might embarrass the government or spread dissent, i.e. the role of women in Saudi society, the treatment of Shiite Muslims, damage caused by natural disasters, or social problems such as the AIDS-HIV pandemic and human trafficking.

Most Saudi Arabian newspapers are privately-owned but subsidized and regulated by the government.
As of 2013, BBC News reported that criticism of the government and royal family and the questioning of Islamic tenets &quot;are not generally tolerated. Self-censorship is pervasive.&quot; As of 2014, Freedom House rates the kingdom&#x27;s press and internet &quot;Not Free&quot;.

== Civil society ==
Labor unions and political parties are prohibited in the kingdom, although a few underground political parties do exist. The government has created a national &quot;Consultative Council&quot; (which is appointed not elected, and does not pass laws), and has given permission for certain &quot;societies&quot; to exist (though they have little ability to influence government policy).
Informal public discussion of public policy is not actively encouraged, although it is not expressly per se, unless it is deemed to be promoting immorality, dissent or disloyalty. Limited non-partisan municipal elections were held in 2005.

== Sport ==

The most popular sport in Saudi Arabia is Association football (soccer) in both in participation and viewing. It is governed by the Saudi Arabia Football Federation that was founded in 1956.

There are 60 football clubs participating in three main professional football league levels; the Saudi Professional League involving 16 football clubs, Saudi First Division League with 20 clubs and Second Division with 24 clubs. The demotics competitions also include some cups such as King club, Crown Prince Cup and Saudi Super Cup.

The Saudi Arabia national football team has qualified five times for FIFA World Cup competitions, in 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, and most recently, in 2018. Moreover, it qualified for the AFC Asian Cup 10 times and had won three of them.

Recently, some Saudi players have become skilled enough to play in Europe. The players were sent to Spain to play in the La Liga aiming to improve their skills better.

Basketball is also popular. The Saudi Arabia national team won the bronze medal at the 1999 Asian Championship.

Horse racing is also another diversion in Saudi Arabia which has a historical and cultural legacy where Friday afternoon is the traditional time of horse racing in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. The establishment of the Equestrian Club of Riyadh in 1965 was a result of the importance of horse racing. Moreover, now Saudis are the dominant player in some international horse racing such as Royal Ascot to Longchamp and Melbourne.

Falconry is another sport with long traditions rooted in Bedouin culture. It mainly consists of raising falcons, training them and using them for hunting. Despite the inscription of Falconry by the UNESCO as a living human heritage, it is also emerging as a sport.

Camel racing is a uniquely Arabian sport practiced in the kingdom (and the UAE) that still has some mass popularity. There are camel racetracks in most of the kingdom&#x27;s major centres, and races for prize money on many weekends throughout the winter months. Like racehorses, camels with breeding pedigrees may be very valuable.

===Women&#x27;s sport===

In 2012, Saudi Arabia included women in its Olympic team for the first time. Two female athletes—a runner and judoka—participated. The inclusion followed international criticism for years of exclusion, but was controversial in the kingdom, and &quot;prompted some to abuse the morals&quot; of the athletes on social media.

As of April 2014, Saudi authorities in the education ministry have been asked by the Shoura Council to consider lifting a state school ban on sports for girls with the proviso that any sports conform to Sharia rules on dress and gender segregation, according to the official SPA news agency.

Women participation have then increased as four athletes were sent to the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio. They were two runner Sarah Attar, and Cariman Abu al-Jadail joined by judo athlete Wujud Fahmi and fencing competitor Lubna al-Omair.

In 2018, more than 1300 girls participated in a 3 km marathon, al-Ahsa Runs, for the first time in the country.

==Arts and entertainment==

Visual arts tend to be dominated by geometric, floral, and abstract designs and by calligraphy. Sunni Islam traditionally prohibits creating representations of people. With the advent of oil wealth in the 20th century came exposure to outside influences, such as Western housing styles, furnishings, and clothes.

Calligraphy is the art of forming arranging beautiful letters and symbols, and it is among the dominant art forms in Saudi Arabia. This art has been emerging in different themes such as metalwork, ceramics, glass textiles, painting, and sculpture.

Apart from the dominant art forms, there were some portrait paintings and sculptures produced by some artists in the 1960s like Artist Dia Aziz Dia from Jeddah.
Al-Qatt Al-Asiri is another essential art form represents the identity of the Asir region. It is the art of interior wall decoration usually carried out by women. The base of this art is white gypsum with colorful patterns of geometric shapes and symbol painted on it. This art form is now inscribed on UNESCO&#x27;s Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

The ten-day-long Jenadriyah National Festival celebrates the founding of the kingdom and showcases Saudi culture and heritage, traditional crafts such as pottery and woodcutting, folk dance and traditional songs.

=== Music and dance ===

Music and dance have always been part of Saudi life. Bedouin poetry, known as &quot;nabaṭī&quot;, is still very popular.
Traditional music is generally associated with poetry and is sung collectively. Instruments include the &quot;rabābah&quot;, an instrument not unlike a three-string fiddle, and various types of percussion instruments, such as the &quot;ṭabl&quot; (drum) and the &quot;ṭār&quot; (tambourine).
&quot;Al-sihba&quot; folk music has its origins in al-Andalus. In Mecca, Medina and Jeddah, dance and song incorporate the sound of the &quot;mizmar&quot;, an oboe-like woodwind instrument, in the performance of the &quot;mizmar&quot; dance. The drum is also an important instrument according to traditional and tribal customs. &quot;Samri&quot; is a popular traditional form of music and dance in which poetry is sung.
Of the native dances, the most popular is a martial line dance known as the Al Ardha, which includes lines of men, frequently armed with swords or rifles, dancing to the beat of drums and tambourines. As one non-Saudi described it, the performance consists of: &quot;barefooted males clad in their normal street clothes of thobe and gutra jumping up and down mostly in one spot while wielding swords&quot;.

&quot;Dahha&quot; is another popular dance in Northern Saudi performed by one line of men or two lines facing each other while a man in between sings a poem which can be a satirical, eulogy or a descriptive poem.

=== Literature ===
Bedouin poetry is a cultural tradition in Saudi Arabia. According to Sandra Mackey, author of &quot;The Saudis: Inside the Desert Kingdom&quot;, &quot;the role that formal poetry, prose, and oratory play in Saudi culture is totally alien to Western culture.&quot; Mackey explained that the Bedouin poet was the origin of Saudi society&#x27;s traditionally strong attachment to the concept of language. She said that poetry &quot;can arise in the most curious of situations&quot; due to the role of poetry in Saudi culture.

The literary renaissance began during the first quarter of the 20th century where the literary genre of poetry was improved in language and number of poets. The pioneer poets during that era include Mohammed Faqi (1914-2004), Tahir Zamakhshri (1914-1987), and Hasan Alqurashi (1926-2004).

Novel writing is another literary genre in Saudi literature where the first Saudi novel was The Twins (1930) by Abdul Alquddus Alansari. In the modern era of Saudi novel, some novel writer becomes popular like Turki Alhamad, Abdu Khal Raja Alim.

Theatre in Saudi Arabia back to 1928 where their origins were schools. The earliest attempts were in Qassim and Makkah, and subsequently, universities contributed to the theatre activities.

Contemporary Saudi novelists and artists include:
* Abdul Rahman Munif (many of his books were banned and his citizenship revoked)
* Turki al-Hamad
* Raja&#x27;a Alem
* Rajaa Al Sanie, author of best-selling novel &quot;Girls of Riyadh&quot;
* Ghazi Abdul Rahman Al Gosaibi
* Haifaa al-Mansour

===Entertainment===

During the 1970s, cinemas were numerous in the kingdom although they were seen as contrary to tribal norms. All cinemas and theaters were closed in 1980 as a political response to the Islamic revival and the increase in Islamist activism, most particularly the 1979 seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca. As of 2018, cinemas opened in multiple cities including Riyadh and Jeddah.

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman&#x27;s Vision 2030 should bring cinemas back to the country in early 2018. The establishment of the General Authority for Entertainment in 2016 has pushed for entertainment options of the including cinemas, public concerts, international conferences, competitions, singing show and other cultural activities.

<doc id="533358" wikidata="Q641609" url="?curid=533358" title="Heythrop College, University of London">
<text>Heythrop College, University of London, was a constituent college of the University of London between 1971 and 2018, last located in Kensington Square, London. It comprised the university&#x27;s specialist faculties of philosophy and theology with social sciences, offering undergraduate and postgraduate degree courses and five specialist institutes and centres to promote research. 

The college had a close affiliation with the Catholic Church, through the British Province of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) whose scholarly tradition went back to a 1614 exiled foundation in Leuven, Belgium, and whose extensive library collections it housed. While maintaining its denominational links and ethos the college welcomed all faiths and perspectives, women as well as men.

Through Heythrop&#x27;s close links with the Jesuits, it also served as the London centre for Fordham University, a Jesuit university in the United States. Other external groups, including A Call To Action (ACTA, British Catholic Association), also used meeting facilities on the site.

Following unsuccessful negotiations with St Mary&#x27;s University, Twickenham, another British university, and amid some controversy, in June 2015 the college&#x27;s governing body decided that the college would cease to be an independent constituent of the University of London, in 2018. It formally terminated operations and left the University of London on 31 January 2019. It was the first significant UK higher education institution to completely close permanently (not including mergers and name changes) since the dissolution of the original University of Northampton in 1265.

==Twentieth-century name==

The college acquired its name, &quot;Heythrop&quot;, from its 46 years at Heythrop Hall, a Grade II* listed early 18th-century country house in Italian Baroque style, southeast of Heythrop village in Oxfordshire. The English province of the Society of Jesus bought the dilapidated house and grounds in 1926 as a training centre for their scholastics. During its stay, the house was altered and enlarged, not always in a style sympathetic to the original architectural concept. In 1926 two wings were added to the north front built of Hornton ironstone from north Oxfordshire, much darker and browner than the stone used to build the original house in the 18th century.

In 1952, the indoor real tennis court was converted into a chapel and in 1965, a library was added. In 1960, two halls of residence were added in the grounds in contemporary style.

In 1970 the Jesuit province moved its facilities to London after it had negotiated for the centre&#x27;s faculties of theology and philosophy to become part of London University. It sold its Oxfordshire estate to the National Westminster Bank Group which turned the house and its precincts into a training and conference centre.

== History ==
===Beginnings in exile===

Due to continuing anti-Catholic persecution during the reign of James I, a network of English religious schools was established in Western Europe. Likewise the Society of Jesus preferred to establish its school for boys and its faculties of theology and philosophy for training English Jesuit candidates abroad. Under John Gerard it founded them in Leuven in 1614, before moving them to a newly constructed college in Liège in 1616, which became the . William Baldwin (1563–1632) was a professor of moral theology at the college in Louvain. He, like Gerard, was implicated in the Gunpowder Plot.

In 1624 the English Jesuit college obtained patronage from Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria, and his wife, hence the colours of the elector&#x27;s coat of arms were incorporated into its own coat of arms. The Liège college was protected in the Austrian Netherlands and continued relatively undisturbed for 178 years, through the suppression of the Society of Jesus in 1773 under the personal authority of Bishop François-Charles de Velbrück, until French troops surrounded the city in 1794.
Notable teachers and alumni included:
* John Carroll (1735–1815), first Roman Catholic bishop (and Archbishop of Baltimore) in the United States and founder of Georgetown University
* Charles Carroll (1737–1832), Maryland delegate and one of the signatories of the Declaration of Independence 
* Charles Plowden (1743–1821), Jesuit priest, writer and administrator; first rector at Stonyhurst
* Francis Plowden, Jesuit priest, barrister and writer. Taught at the college during the suppression of the Society of Jesus
* John Howard SJ was head of Liège College (1773–1783)
* William Strickland SJ was head of Liège College (1783–1790)
* Marmaduke Stone SJ (1748–1834), final director of the college (1790–1794), led the evacuation to England

===Repatriation to England and Wales===

During the French Revolutionary Wars, the continuity of the college is owed principally to two men: Marmaduke Stone SJ, who led the Liège college move to England in 1794 and an Old Boy of Watten and Bruges English College, Thomas Weld (of Lulworth), who generously donated his family seat, of Stonyhurst, a property in Lancashire, where the evacuees settled for the foreseeable future. While the environment in England was relatively benign for Catholics, the Catholic Church had suppressed the Jesuit order during the English province&#x27;s exile in Europe. They resolved therefore to accept the authority of the only remaining valid Jesuit province which was in the Russian Empire under superiors, Gabriel Gruber and Tadeusz Brzozowski. The latter became Superior General of the Society of Jesus in 1814, although still confined to Russia, when Pope Pius VII lifted the ban on the order. The former Liège college staff located its faculties on two sites, philosophy at Stonyhurst College in Lancashire and theology at St Beuno&#x27;s College in Denbighshire.

In 1840, Stonyhurst was recognised as an affiliated college of the University of London, which had been created in 1836. This allowed students to sit examinations for University of London degrees. Among the notable teaching staff were:
* Henry James Coleridge (1822–1893), professor of Scripture, religious preacher and writer
* Alfred Weld (1823–1890), professor of Science and Astronomy, Director of the Stonyhurst Observatory, grandson of the College founder
* Sylvester Joseph Hunter (1829–1896), Jesuit priest and educator
* John Morris (1826–1893) taught canon law in 1867
* George Tyrrell (1861–1909), an Irish Jesuit, taught philosophy at Stonyhurst (until his expulsion from the Jesuits) and was condemned for Modernism
* Franz Xavier Wernz (1842–1914), professor of canon law in 1882 at St Beuno&#x27;s. He served as the 25th Superior General of the Society of Jesus and was rector of the Pontifical Gregorian University, Rome

Among its alumni were:
* James Brodrick (1891–1973), Jesuit priest and historian
* Richard Clarke (1839–1900), Jesuit priest and theologian. First Master of Campion Hall, Oxford
* Aloysius Cortie (1859–1925), Jesuit priest and astronomer 
* Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844–1899), Jesuit priest, poet and professor 
* Joseph Rickaby (1845–1932), Jesuit priest and philosopher
* Martin D&#x27;Arcy SJ (1888–1976) was a philosopher of love, and a correspondent, friend, and adviser of a range of literary and artistic figures including Evelyn Waugh, Dorothy L. Sayers, W. H. Auden, Eric Gill and Sir Edwin Lutyens. He has been described as &quot;perhaps England&#x27;s foremost Catholic public intellectual from the 1930s until his death&quot;.

===Heythrop years===
In 1926, the faculties came together at Heythrop Hall, Oxfordshire. As a &quot;Collegium Maximum&quot;, the college&#x27;s right to admit its students to degrees was confirmed by the Holy See in 1932. In 1964, the college was raised to the status of a &quot;Pontifical Athenaeum&quot;, named as the &quot;Heythrop Faculties of Theology and Philosophy&quot;, open to lay men and women and clerics from outside the Society of Jesus. However, the college now also sought integration with the British educational system.

== Constituent of the University of London ==
For this purpose it moved to London in 1970, and obtained a royal charter of incorporation as a &quot;school&quot; of the University of London in the faculties of theology and arts on 11 March 1971. It began to award University of London degrees. After its move to London, to a Grade II listed Georgian townhouse, a former convent, at nos. 11–13 Cavendish Square in the Marylebone area, the college retained the name &quot;Heythrop College&quot;.
In 1993 the college moved to its final location, in the Maria Assumpta Centre at 23 Kensington Square, initially sharing the site with several other organisations, most notably the &quot;Westminster Pastoral Foundation&quot; (WPF), a reputable and long-established counselling training institute. In 2000 Heythrop College announced it needed more space for its library and delicate negotiations began with WPF. The college had assembled one of the largest philosophy and theology-related libraries in Britain. 
Eight years later, WPF were finally persuaded to uproot and vacate their extensive purpose-built premises, about a quarter of the Maria Assumpta site.

In January 2014, the college received decrees from the Congregation for Catholic Education of the Holy See officially reactivating its ecclesiastical faculties under the patronage of saint Robert Bellarmine. These ecclesiastical faculties were grouped together as the Bellarmine Institute. In June 2014, Heythrop College celebrated the 400th anniversary of its two original faculties. While the college still retained the English Jesuits&#x27; original function of training future priests of the Catholic Church, its contemporary teaching staff and student body had become much wider, more international and diverse.

The college ran into financial difficulties in the 2010s due to the changes in higher education in the United Kingdom. Undergraduate student recruitment declined after the cap on tuition fees was raised to £9,000 per annum in 2012, resulting in the Society of Jesus subsidising the college with millions of pounds: Claire Ozanne, the college&#x27;s final principal, also highlighted the impact of the administrative burden of quality assurance assessments such as the Teaching and Research Excellence Frameworks on small institutions like Heythrop. Despite explorations with other academies, strategic partnership talks with St Mary&#x27;s University, Twickenham, and an offer from the University of Roehampton for Heythrop to affiliate as one of its constituent colleges, no solution was found and in 2015 the decision was made to wind down and close by 2019.

== Maria Assumpta campus ==
The site was previously entirely owned by the Religious of the Assumption, a religious order of sisters founded in France by Saint Marie-Eugénie de Jésus. The Sisters originally ran a convent school and later a teacher training college on the mainly residential Victorian site, known for decades as &quot;The Maria Assumpta Centre&quot;. A number of the sisters continue to live on the site, and their Marie Eugénie Chapel was available for student use. A chaplaincy was provided for all College students, in addition to the University of London chaplaincy, along with an Islamic Prayer room.

Unlike many University of London colleges, Heythrop College managed in 2008, on the termination of their lease and the vacation of its premises by WPF, to take over the majority of facilities on the Maria Assumpta Kensington site. All lecture rooms, the students&#x27; union, the dining hall, previously shared with WPF and other tenant organisations, in the Victorian buildings in Kensington Square, came under its exclusive management. The College also took over the Alban Hall of residence, previously operated by the Sisters for women students only, which became briefly the College&#x27;s sole residential accommodation for a proportion of its selected student body.

=== Library ===
The college library comprising some 180,000 volumes, made it one of the largest theology and philosophy libraries in the United Kingdom. Some of its collections date back to the founding of the faculties in 1614. Between 2008 and 2018, the collections were housed in two buildings: the theology, social sciences and literature collections were held in the &quot;Copleston Wing&quot; of the college, formerly the main part of the WPF Training Centre, while philosophy collections were held in the Maria Assumpta Library in the main building. Heythrop also held many of its more precious volumes outside London, in the college repository in Egham, Surrey. It had a large and important collection of pre-1801 books, such as Edward Baddeley&#x27;s collections and a first edition of Isaac Newton&#x27;s &quot;Opticks&quot;. Heythrop students were also able to access the Senate House Library, and the libraries of other colleges of the university due to the college&#x27;s special status.

Since the College&#x27;s closure the library&#x27;s collections have been available through the Senate House Library. As the former college library is still owned by the Jesuits in Britain, they have also made most of the collection available through the Heythrop Library reading room at the London Jesuit Centre. The earliest printed books have been deposited at Campion Hall, Oxford.

== Academic profile ==
Heythrop prepared students for a range of specialist taught and research degrees. The college had five specialist institutes and centres which promoted research, conferences and a variety of educational outreach activities. These were the:
* Centre for Christianity and Inter-religious Dialogue
* Centre for Eastern Christianity
* Centre for Philosophy of Religion
* Religious Life Institute 
* Heythrop Institute for Religion and Society

All of the institutes conducted research in their own field.

The college offered full-time, and part-time courses through a combination of lectures, seminars and tutorials, including one-to-one tutorials.

The college had a growing research profile in its final years. It participated in the most recent Research Excellence Framework (2014) and gained considerable recognition for its research. The combined results for all elements of the REF placed Heythrop at 16th in the overall ranking for the Theology &amp; Religious Studies unit of assessment. Overall, 22% of its research outputs was deemed world-leading and a further 40% was deemed internationally excellent. The research works recognised in its submission reflected efforts in both its Theology and Philosophy departments.

=== Department of Philosophy ===
The department offered a variety of specialist philosophy degrees with students attached to one of the Centres at the College, embracing both the continental and analytic traditions, and the history of philosophy.

=== Department of Theology ===
In addition to theology, religious studies and ethics, Heythrop said it was the first college in the world to offer undergraduate and postgraduate degree courses focused on the Abrahamic Religions led by members of each of the three Abrahamic faiths. The Theology department also offered a Divinity programme to candidates for the Catholic priesthood, making it a centre of Roman Catholic training and learning in the United Kingdom.

=== Pastoral and social studies ===
The college had a distinctive history and range of teaching in pastoral theology and allied disciplines, with a profile in the United Kingdom and internationally. The Pastoral and Social Studies Department offered degree programmes in the following fields: pastoral theology and practical theology, including:
* Sociology of religion
* Christian spirituality
* Ethics
* Liturgy
* Canon law and psychology, including a specialism in the psychology of religion.

=== Bellarmine Institute ===
The Bellarmine Institute, named after St Robert Bellarmine, was the new name given to the Heythrop ecclesiastical Faculties of Theology and Philosophy in 2013. After moving to London and becoming established as a constituent college of the University of London, the Faculties had become dormant. They were reactivated on 17 September 2013 by a decree of the Congregation for Catholic Education of the Holy See, expanding the opportunities and teaching the college could offer to seminarians, priestly candidates and others. Before the closure of the college, it had been announced that the Society of Jesus, the college governors and the Archbishop of Westminster would look for ways for the ecclesiastical faculties to continue.

The institute offered degree programmes in theology and philosophy, intended for Catholic ordinands, those already engaged in church ministry and other scholars. The ecclesiastical degree programmes offered covered all three cycles for priestly formation in the Catholic Church.
* Baccalaureate in Sacred Theology (STB)
* Licentiate in Sacred Theology (STL)
* Doctor of Sacred Theology (STD) 
* Baccalaureate in Philosophy (BacPhil)
* Licentiate in Philosophy (PhL)
* Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)

In July 2019 both faculties were transferred to St Mary&#x27;s University Twickenham and renamed Mater Ecclesiae College.

=== Public lectures ===
The college hosted a number of free public lectures, research seminars and study days throughout the year on a variety of philosophical and theological topics. Concurrently, Heythrop ran a number of paid events that were open to the general public.

Heythrop College ran the Loschert Lecture, a lecture series delivered by eminent philosophers, theologians and people of faith. The series was intended to reflect from a consciously Christian perspective, on significant social, political and ethical issues in society. The series was named after William Loschert, chairman of the trustees of the London Centre of Fordham University, who donated the funding for the lectures. Lecturers included Charles Margrave Taylor, Baroness Scotland, Peter Sutherland and David Brennan.

=== &quot;The Heythrop Journal&quot; ===
Heythrop College sponsored &quot;The Heythrop Journal&quot;, an international philosophy and theology academic journal. Published on a bimonthly basis, &quot;The Heythrop Journal&quot; was founded in 1960 by Bruno Brinkman as a format for research on the relational dialogue between philosophy and theology. Still retaining this original function, the current editor is Patrick Madigan, who was a faculty member of Heythrop College. , the journal continues to be published.

=== Student activities ===
Apart from its students&#x27; union, Heythrop&#x27;s students established their in-house newspaper, &quot;The Lion&quot;, in 2010. It won the NUS &quot;Best Student Media&quot; award in 2011. In 2015, &quot;The Lion&quot; ceased publication.

== Closure ==
In September 2013, Heythrop College announced that it would stop recruiting undergraduates for University of London degrees, noting its then discussions about a &quot;strategic partnership&quot; with St Mary&#x27;s University, Twickenham. The initiative was attributed to financial difficulties the College faced as an autonomous college of the University of London. Accordingly, the number of student dropped from 700 in the academic year 2015/15 and 560 in 2015/16 to 425 in 2016/17 and 200 in 2017/18. In June 2017 it was confirmed that the college would close in October 2018, with no plans to transfer any departments or continue elsewhere. Heythrop ultimately closed at the end of the 2017/18 academic year, with the final graduations taking place at Senate House on 12 December 2018. From 1 August 2017, the University of London took over the academic sanction previously granted by Heythrop College for the Bachelor of Divinity and related Diploma and Certificate of Higher Education programmes offered through the University of London (Worldwide).

The site (on prime Kensington real estate) was sold, with some of the proceeds reverting to the Religious of the Assumption. While Westbourne Capital Partners applied to redevelop the site as a luxury retirement complex, this was later refused by the Mayor of London.

<text>In ancient Roman religion, the Quinquatria or Quinquatrus was a festival sacred to the Goddess Minerva, celebrated 19–23 March. According to Varro, it was so called because it was held on the fifth &quot;(quinqu-)&quot; day after the Ides, in the same way as the Tusculans called a festival on the sixth day after the Ides &quot;Sexatrus&quot; or one on the seventh &quot;Septimatrus&quot;. Both Varro and Festus state that the Quinquatrus was celebrated for only one day, but Ovid says that it was celebrated for five days, hence the name: on the first day no blood was shed, but that on the last four there were contests of gladiators. The first day was the festival proper, and that the following four were an expansion made perhaps in the time of Caesar to gratify the people. The ancient Roman religious calendars assign only one day to the festival.

Ovid says that this festival was celebrated in commemoration of the birthday of Minerva; but according to Festus it was sacred to Minerva because her temple on the Aventine was consecrated on that day. On the fifth day of the festival, according to Ovid, the trumpets used in sacred rites were purified; but this seems to have been originally a separate festival called Tubilustrium, which ancient calendars place on 23 March. When the celebration of Quinquatrus was extended to five days, the Tubilustrium would have fallen on the last day of that festival.

As this festival was sacred to Minerva, it seems that women were accustomed to consult fortune-tellers and diviners upon this day. Domitian caused it to be celebrated every year in his Alban villa, situated at the foot of the Alban hills, and instituted a &quot;collegium&quot; to superintend the celebration, which consisted of shows of wild beasts, of the exhibition of plays, and of contests of orators and poets.

There was also another festival of this name called &quot;Quinquatrus Minusculae&quot; or &quot;Quinquatrus Minores&quot;, celebrated on the Ides of June, on which the &quot;tibicines&quot; went through the city in procession to the temple of Minerva.

==Historical significance==
At the Quinquatria in 59, Nero invited his mother, Agrippina the Younger, to his villa near Baiae, in an attempt to assassinate her. His old tutor, Anicetus, whom he had raised to be captain of the fleet of Misenum, had undertaken to construct a vessel which could be sunk, without exciting suspicion. Agrippina landed at Bauli, between Baiae and Cape Misenum, and completed her journey in a litter. After the banquet, when night had fallen, she was induced to return to Bauli in the vessel which had been prepared for her destruction. But the mechanism did not work as planned, and Agrippina succeeded in swimming to shore, from which she proceeded to her villa on the Lucrine lake. Nero soon after succeeded in his goal, however, with further help from Anicetus.

<text>Normal for Norfolk (or NFN) is a slang term used in some parts of England for something that is peculiar, or odd.

The term comes from medical slang created by doctors to insult their patients. Utilised by doctors and Social Services in Norfolk and elsewhere to depict patients of lesser intellect, some were moved to record the letters &#x27;NFN&#x27; against the personal details of certain clients, where they were considered to be a bit strange or had peculiar habits. According to the urban myth, such clients were so common in that area that they were considered normal as far as Norfolk was concerned.

The term is considered derogatory because it portrays people from Norfolk as normally being strange, or peculiar with an inference that they are in-bred. The portrayal of people from Norfolk in this light is a common stereotype in England.

Within Norfolk itself, the phrase may also be known as &quot;Normal for Wisbech&quot;, which is in neighbouring Cambridgeshire. Most areas of the country have a regional variation of NFN, e.g. in North-West England, NFS (Normal for Stoke) may be heard.

&quot;Normal for Norfolk&quot;, was the title of a BBC series, about farmer Desmond MacCarthy, trying to keep Wiveton Hall, his 17th Century manor house, going. This ran for 2 series, of 4 episodes and 6 episodes respectively, in 2016 and 2018.

<text>In geology, a rift is a linear zone where the lithosphere is being pulled apart and is an example of extensional tectonics. Typical rift features are a central linear downfaulted depression, called a graben, or more commonly a half-graben with normal faulting and rift-flank uplifts mainly on one side. Where rifts remain above sea level they form a rift valley, which may be filled by water forming a rift lake. The axis of the rift area may contain volcanic rocks, and active volcanism is a part of many, but not all, active rift systems.

Major rifts occur along the central axis of most mid-ocean ridges, where new oceanic crust and lithosphere is created along a divergent boundary between two tectonic plates.

&quot;Failed rifts&quot; are the result of continental rifting that failed to continue to the point of break-up. Typically the transition from rifting to spreading develops at a triple junction where three converging rifts meet over a hotspot. Two of these evolve to the point of seafloor spreading, while the third ultimately fails, becoming an aulacogen.

==Geometry==

Most rifts consist of a series of separate segments that together form the linear zone characteristic of rifts. The individual rift segments have a dominantly half-graben geometry, controlled by a single basin-bounding fault. Segment lengths vary between rifts, depending on the elastic thickness of the lithosphere. 

Areas of thick colder lithosphere, such as the Baikal Rift, have segment lengths in excess of 80 km, while in areas of warmer thin lithosphere, segment lengths may be less than 30 km. Along the axis of the rift the position, and in some cases the polarity (the dip direction), of the main rift bounding fault changes from segment to segment. Segment boundaries often have a more complex structure and generally cross the rift axis at a high angle. These segment boundary zones accommodate the differences in fault displacement between the segments and are therefore known as accommodation zones.

Accommodation zones take various forms, from a simple relay ramp at the overlap between two major faults of the same polarity, to zones of high structural complexity, particularly where the segments have opposite polarity. Accommodation zones may be located where older crustal structures intersect the rift axis. In the Gulf of Suez rift, the Zaafarana accommodation zone is located where a shear zone in the Arabian-Nubian Shield meets the rift.

Rift flanks or shoulders are elevated areas around rifts. Rift shoulders are typically about 70 km wide. Contrary to what was previously thought, elevated passive continental margins (EPCM) such as the Brazilian Highlands, the Scandinavian Mountains and India&#x27;s Western Ghats, are not rift shoulders.

==Rift development==

===Rift initiation===
The formation of rift basins and strain localization reflects rift maturity. At the onset of rifting, the upper part of the lithosphere starts to extend on a series of initially unconnected normal faults, leading to the development of isolated basins. In subaerial rifts, for example, drainage at the onset of rifting is generally internal, with no element of through drainage.

===Mature rift stage===
As the rift evolves, some of the individual fault segments grow, eventually becoming linked together to form the larger bounding faults. Subsequent extension becomes concentrated on these faults. The longer faults and wider fault spacing leads to more continuous areas of fault-related subsidence along the rift axis. Significant uplift of the rift shoulders develops at this stage, strongly influencing drainage and sedimentation in the rift basins.

During the climax of lithospheric rifting, as the crust is thinned, the Earth&#x27;s surface subsides and the Moho becomes correspondingly raised. At the same time, the mantle lithosphere becomes thinned, causing a rise of the top of the asthenosphere. This brings high heat flow from the upwelling asthenosphere into the thinning lithosphere, heating the orogenic lithosphere for dehydration melting, typically causing extreme metamorphism at high thermal gradients of greater than 30 °C. The metamorphic products are high to ultrahigh temperature granulites and their associated migmatite and granites in collisional orogens, with possible emplacement of metamorphic core complexes in continental rift zones but oceanic core complexes in spreading ridges. This leads to a kind of orogeneses in extensional settings, which is referred as to rifting orogeny.

===Post-rift subsidence===
Once rifting ceases, the mantle beneath the rift cools and this is accompanied by a broad area of post-rift subsidence. The amount of subsidence is directly related to the amount of thinning during the rifting phase calculated as the beta factor (initial crustal thickness divided by final crustal thickness), but is also affected by the degree to which the rift basin is filled at each stage, due to the greater density of sediments in contrast to water. The simple &#x27;McKenzie model&#x27; of rifting, which considers the rifting stage to be instantaneous, provides a good first order estimate of the amount of crustal thinning from observations of the amount of post-rift subsidence. This has generally been replaced by the &#x27;flexural cantilever model&#x27;, which takes into account the geometry of the rift faults and the flexural isostasy of the upper part of the crust.

===Multiphase rifting===
Some rifts show a complex and prolonged history of rifting, with several distinct phases. The North Sea rift shows evidence of several separate rift phases from the Permian through to the Earliest Cretaceous, a period of over 100 million years.

===Rifting to break-up===
Rifting may lead to continental breakup and formation of oceanic basins. Successful rifting leads to seafloor spreading along a mid-oceanic ridge and a set of conjugate margins separated by an oceanic basin. Rifting may be active, and controlled by mantle convection. It may also be passive, and driven by far-field tectonic forces that stretch the lithosphere. Margin architecture develops due to spatial and temporal relationships between extensional deformation phases. Margin segmentation eventually leads to the formation of rift domains with variations of the Moho topography, including proximal domain with fault-rotated crustal blocks, necking zone with thinning of crustal basement, distal domain with deep sag basins, ocean-continent transition and oceanic domain.

Deformation and magmatism interact during rift evolution. Magma-rich and magma-poor rifted margins may be formed. Magma-rich margins include major volcanic features. Globally, volcanic margins represent the majority of passive continental margins. Magma-starved rifted margins are affected by large-scale faulting and crustal hyperextension. As a consequence, upper mantle peridotites and gabbros are commonly exposed and serpentinized along extensional detachments at the seafloor.

==Magmatism==

Many rifts are the sites of at least minor magmatic activity, particularly in the early stages of rifting. Alkali basalts and bimodal volcanism are common products of rift-related magmatism.

Recent studies indicate that post-collisional granites in collisional orogens are the product of rifting magmatism at converged plate margins.

==Economic importance==
The sedimentary rocks associated with continental rifts host important deposits of both minerals and hydrocarbons.

===Mineral deposits===
SedEx mineral deposits are found mainly in continental rift settings. They form within post-rift sequences when hydrothermal fluids associated with magmatic activity are expelled at the seabed.

===Oil and gas===
Continental rifts are the sites of significant oil and gas accumulations, such as the Viking Graben and the Gulf of Suez Rift. Thirty percent of giant oil and gas fields are found within such a setting. In 1999 it was estimated that there were 200 billion barrels of recoverable oil reserves hosted in rifts. Source rocks are often developed within the sediments filling the active rift (syn-rift), forming either in a environment or in a restricted marine environment, although not all rifts contain such sequences. Reservoir rocks may be developed in pre-rift, syn-rift and post-rift sequences. 

Effective regional seals may be present within the post-rift sequence if mudstones or evaporites are deposited. Just over half of estimated oil reserves are found associated with rifts containing marine syn-rift and post-rift sequences, just under a quarter in rifts with a non-marine syn-rift and post-rift, and an eighth in non-marine syn-rift with a marine post-rift.

<doc id="533378" wikidata="Q929582" url="?curid=533378" title="Macbeth (1971 film)">
<text>Macbeth (also known as The Tragedy of Macbeth or Roman Polanski&#x27;s Film of Macbeth) is a 1971 historical drama film directed by Roman Polanski, and co-written by Polanski and Kenneth Tynan. A film adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedy of the same name, it tells the story of the Highland lord who becomes King of Scotland through treachery and murder. Jon Finch and Francesca Annis star as the title character and his wife, noted for their relative youth as actors. Themes of historic recurrence, greater pessimism and internal ugliness in physically beautiful characters are added to Shakespeare&#x27;s story of moral decline, which is presented in a more realistic style.

Polanski opted to adapt &quot;Macbeth&quot; as a means of coping with the highly publicized Manson Family murder of his pregnant wife, Sharon Tate. Finding difficulty obtaining sponsorship from major studios, Playboy Enterprises stepped in to provide funding. Following troubled shooting around the British Isles mired by poor weather, &quot;Macbeth&quot; screened out of competition at the 1972 Cannes Film Festival and was a commercial failure in the United States. Initially controversial for its graphic violence and nudity, the film has since garnered generally positive reviews, and was named Best Film by the National Board of Review in 1972.

==Plot==
In the Middle Ages, a Norwegian and Irish invasion of Scotland aided by traitorous Thane of Cawdor, MacDonwald, is suppressed by Macbeth, Thane of Glamis, and Banquo. MacDonwald is sentenced to death by King Duncan and decrees Macbeth shall be awarded the title of Cawdor. Macbeth and Banquo do not hear of this news; when out riding, they happen upon Three Witches, who hail Macbeth as &quot;Thane of Cawdor and future King&quot;, and Banquo as &quot;lesser and greater&quot;. At their camp, nobles arrive and inform Macbeth he has been named the Thane of Cawdor, with Macbeth simultaneously awed and frightened at the prospect of usurping Duncan, in further fulfilment of the prophecy. He writes a letter to Lady Macbeth, who is delighted at the news. However, she fears her husband has too much good nature, and vows to be cruel for him. Duncan names his eldest son, Malcolm, Prince of Cumberland, and thus heir apparent, to the displeasure of Macbeth and Malcolm&#x27;s brother Donalbain. The royal family and nobles then spend the night at Macbeth&#x27;s castle, with Lady Macbeth greeting the King and dancing with him with duplicity.

Urged on by his wife, Macbeth steps into King Duncan&#x27;s chambers after she has drugged the guards. Duncan wakes and utters Macbeth&#x27;s name, but Macbeth stabs him to death. He frames the guards for the assassination and then murders them when Duncan&#x27;s corpse is discovered. Fearing a conspiracy, Malcolm and Donalbain flee to England and Ireland, and the Thane of Ross realises Macbeth will be king. An opportunistic courtier, he hails Macbeth at Scone, while the noble Macduff heads back to his home in Fife. When Macbeth begins to fear possible usurpation by Banquo and his son Fleance, he sends two murderers to kill them, and then sends Ross as the mysterious Third Murderer. Banquo is killed, while Fleance escapes. Macbeth, disposes of the two murderers by drowning them. After Banquo appears at a banquet as a ghost, Macbeth seeks out the witches, who are performing a nude ritual. The witches and the spirits they summon deceive Macbeth into thinking he is invincible, as he cannot be killed except by a man not born of woman and will not be defeated until &quot;Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane.&quot;

Ross is sent to Fife to direct the slaughter of Macduff, however, Macduff has gone to England. Ross enters Fife castle pretending to be a friend, but leaves the heavy castle doors open, allowing Macbeth&#x27;s gang of murderers in to kill Lady Macduff, the children and servants. With nobles fleeing Scotland, Macbeth chooses a new Thane of Fife, bestowing the title on Seyton over Ross. Disappointed, Ross leaves Scotland to join Malcolm and Macduff in England. They welcome him, unaware of his treachery. The English King has allied with Malcolm, committing forces led by Siward to overthrow Macbeth and install Malcolm on the Scottish throne.

The English forces invade, covering themselves by cutting down branches from Birnam Wood and holding them in front of their army to hide their numbers as they march on Macbeth in Dunsinane. When the forces storm the castle, Macduff confronts Macbeth, and during the sword fight, Macduff reveals he was delivered by Caesarean section. Macduff kills Macbeth by beheading him, and Ross presents the crown to Malcolm, who becomes the new King of Scotland. Meanwhile, Donalbain, out riding, encounters the witches.

==Cast==
==Themes and interpretations==

James Morrison wrote &quot;Macbeth&quot;″s themes of &quot;murderous ambition&quot; fit in with Polanski&#x27;s filmography, and saw similarities to Orson Welles&#x27;s 1948 film version of &quot;Macbeth&quot; in downplaying psychology and reviving the &quot;primitive edge&quot;. However, unlike Welles, Polanski chooses naturalism over expressionism. Author Ewa Mazierska wrote that, despite supposed realism in presenting soliloquies as voiceovers, Polanski&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot; was &quot;absurdist&quot;, not depicting history as an explanation for current events, but as a &quot;vicious circle of crimes and miseries&quot;. Each coronation occurs after the predecessor is violently dispatched, and guests and hosts always betray each other, with Polanski adding Ross leaving Fife&#x27;s castle doors open.

Deanne Williams read the film as not only Polanski&#x27;s reflections on the murder of Sharon Tate, but on wider issues such as the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and the Vietnam War. Francesca Royster similarly argues the use of English and Celtic cultures in the clothes and culture of the 1960s and 1970s, pointing to the publications of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; in the U.S. and the music of Led Zeppelin, ties the film&#x27;s past to the present. While Playboy Enterprises role was mainly to provide funding, Williams also saw Polanski&#x27;s Lady Macbeth as embodying &quot;Playboy &quot;mythos&quot;&quot; paradoxes, at times warm and sexy, at times a domestic servant, and at times femme fatale.

In one scene, Macbeth&#x27;s court hosts bear-baiting, a form of entertainment in the Middle Ages in which a bear and dogs are pitted against each other. Williams suggested the scene communicates Macbeth and Lady Macbeth&#x27;s growing callousness after taking power, while Kenneth S. Rothwell and Morrison matched the scene to Shakespeare&#x27;s Macbeth describing himself as &quot;bear-like&quot;.
Literary critic Sylvan Barnet wrote that the younger protagonists suggested &quot;contrast between a fair exterior and an ugly interior&quot;. Williams compared Lady Macbeth to Lady Godiva in her &quot;hair and naturalistic pallor&quot;, suggesting she could fit in at the Playboy Mansion. More &quot;ugliness&quot; is added by Polanski in the re-imagining of Ross, who becomes a more important character in this film. As with the leads, Ross demonstrates &quot;evil-in-beauty&quot; as he is played by &quot;handsome John Stride&quot;.

Barnet also wrote the changed ending with Donalbain meeting the witches replaced the message of &quot;measure, time and place&quot; with &quot;unending treachery&quot;. Film historian Douglas Brode also commented on the added ending, saying it reflected Polanski&#x27;s pessimism in contradiction to Shakespeare&#x27;s optimism. Likewise, Brode believed Macbeth&#x27;s &quot;Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow&quot; soliloquy becomes an articulation of nihilism in the film, while Shakespeare did not intend it to reflect his own sentiment.

==Production==
===Development===

Director Roman Polanski had been interested in adapting a Shakespeare play since he was a student in Kraków, Poland, but he did not begin until after the murder of his pregnant wife, Sharon Tate, and three of the couple&#x27;s mutual friends by members of the Manson Family at his house in Beverly Hills on the night of 9 August 1969. Following the murders, Polanski sank into deep depression, and was unhappy with the way the incident was depicted in the media, in which his films seemed to be blamed. At the time, he was working on the film &quot;The Day of the Dolphin&quot;, a project that collapsed and was turned over to another director, Mike Nichols. While in Gstaad, Switzerland during the start of 1970, Polanski envisioned an adaptation of &quot;Macbeth&quot; and sought out his friend, British theatre critic Kenneth Tynan, for his &quot;encyclopedic knowledge of Shakespeare&quot;. In turn, Tynan was interested in working with Polanski because the director demonstrated what Tynan considered &quot;exactly the right combination of fantasy and violence&quot;.
Around this time Richard Burton was discussing producing a version of &quot;Macbeth&quot; starring Elizabeth Taylor as Lady Macbeth from a script by Paul Dehn. &quot;I&#x27;d rather put it together than appear in it,&quot; said Burton, adding &quot;I&#x27;m not very confident getting it on in the present conditions in the film industry.&quot;

===Scripting===
Tynan and Polanski found it challenging to adapt the text to suit the feel of the film. Tynan wrote to Polanski, saying, &quot;the number one Macbeth problem is to see the events of the film from his point of view&quot;. During the writing process, Polanski and Tynan acted out their scenes in a Belgravia, London apartment, with Tynan as Duncan and Polanski as Macbeth. As with the 1948 film version of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, the soliloquies are presented naturalistically as voiceover narration.

In one scene Polanski and Tynan wrote, Lady Macbeth delivers her sleepwalking soliloquy in the nude. Their decision was motivated by the fact that people in this era always slept in the nude. Likewise, consultations of academic research of the Middle Ages led to the depiction of the nobles, staying at Macbeth&#x27;s castle, going to bed on hay and the ground, with animals present.

The added importance the film gives to Ross did not appear in the first draft of the screenplay, which instead invented a new character called the Bodyguard, who also serves as the Third Murderer. The Bodyguard was merged into Shakespeare&#x27;s Ross. The screenplay was completed by August 1970, with plans to begin filming in England in October.

===Finance===
Paramount Pictures, Universal Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer declined to finance the project, seeing a Shakespeare play as a poor fit for a director who achieved success with &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; (1968). Hugh Hefner, who published &quot;Playboy&quot;, had produced a few films with Playboy Enterprises and was eager to make more when he met Polanski at a party. The budget was set at $2.4 million.

Hefner&#x27;s involvement was announced in August 1970. The &quot;Evening Standard&quot; reported &quot;I understand that this new version will have a high content of sex and violence.&quot;

In April 1971 Columbia Pictures announced they had signed a three-year deal with Playboy Enterprises to make at least four films together the first of which was &quot;Macbeth&quot;.

===Casting===

Due to a feeling that the characters of &quot;Macbeth&quot; were more relatable to young people in the 1960s than experienced, elder actors, Polanski deliberately sought out &quot;young and good-looking&quot; actors for the parts of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. Francesca Annis and Jon Finch were 26 and 29, respectively, with Tynan remarking characters over 60 were too old to be ambitious.

Polanski wanted to cast either Victoria Tennant or Tuesday Weld in the role of Lady Macbeth. Weld rejected the role, unwilling to perform the nude scene. The role was also turned down by Glenda Jackson who said &quot;I don&#x27;t fancy six weeks on location, walking through that damned gorse for next to no money.&quot;

Casting of the role did not happen until just before the film started. Annis accepted the role after some reluctance, as she agreed the character should be older, but was easy to persuade to join the cast. Annis called the film &quot;75 percent Shakespeare and 25 percent Polanski&quot; saying &quot;there is nothing to get excited about&quot; her nude scene. &quot;I simply walk across a room.&quot;

Polanski&#x27;s first choice for Macbeth was Albert Finney, who rejected the role, after which Tynan recommended Nicol Williamson, but Polanski felt he was not attractive enough. Finch was better known for appearing in Hammer Film Productions pictures such as &quot;The Vampire Lovers&quot; and the television series &quot;Counterstrike&quot;. Finch met Polanski on a Paris-London plane and auditioned several times.

For the scene where the Three Witches and numerous others perform &quot;Double, double, toil and trouble&quot; in the nude, Polanski had difficulty hiring extras to perform. As a result, some of the witches are cut from cardboard. Polanski had a few of the elderly extras sing &quot;Happy Birthday to You&quot; while naked for a video, sent to Hefner for his 45th birthday.

===Filming===

&quot;Macbeth&quot; was filmed in various locations around the British Isles, starting in Snowdonia in Wales in October 1970. A considerable amount of shooting took place in Northumberland on the northeast coast of England, including Lindisfarne Castle, Bamburgh Castle and beach, St. Aidan&#x27;s Church and North Charlton Moors near Alnwick. Interior scenes were shot at Shepperton Studios; filming started 2 November 1970.

The production was troubled by poor weather, and the cast complaining of Polanski&#x27;s &quot;petulance&quot;. Fight director William Hobbs likened the long rehearsals in the rain to &quot;training for the decathlon&quot;.

Polanski personally handled and demonstrated the props and rode horses before shooting, and walked into animal feces to film goats and sheep. It was common for the director to snatch the camera away from his cameramen. He also decided to use special effects to present the &quot;dagger of the mind&quot;, believing viewers may be puzzled or would not enjoy it if the dagger did not appear on screen, but was merely described in the dialogue. The great challenges in portraying the catapult of fireballs into the castle led to Polanski calling it &quot;special defects&quot;.

By mid January the film was behind schedule. The completion guarantors arranged for Peter Collinson to be hired and filmed scenes in Shepperton. 

Polanski justified the film&#x27;s inefficiency, blaming &quot;shitty weather&quot;, and agreed to give up one-third of the rest of his salary, on top of which Hefner contributed another $500,000 to complete the film.

===Music===

For the film score, Polanski employed the Third Ear Band, a musical group which enjoyed initial success after publishing their album &quot;Alchemy&quot; in 1969. The band composed original music for the film, by adding electronic music to hand drums, woodwinds and strings. Recorders and oboes were also used, inspired by Medieval music in Scotland. Additionally, elements of music in India and the Middle East and jazz were incorporated into the score.

In the scene where King Duncan is entertained as Macbeth&#x27;s castle, lutes are played, and Fleance sings &quot;Merciless Beauty&quot; by Geoffrey Chaucer, though his lyrics did not fit the film&#x27;s time frame. While the score has some Middle Ages influence, this is not found in the scenes where Duncan is assassinated and Macbeth is killed. Polanski and the band used aleatoric music for these scenes, to communicate chaos.

==Release==
In the United States, the film opened in the Playboy Theater in New York City on 20 December 1971. Polanski bemoaned the release near January as &quot;cinematic suicide&quot; given usually low ticket sales for newly released films in that month. The film opened in London in February 1972. The film was screened at the 1972 Cannes Film Festival, but was not entered into the main competition. Polanski, Finch and Annis attended the Cannes festival in May 1972.

===Box office===
The film was a box office bomb. According to &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, Playboy Enterprises estimated in September 1973 that it would lose $1.8 million on the film, and that it would damage the company as a whole.

Total losses were $3.5 million. The losses caused Shakespeare films to appear commercially risky until Kenneth Branagh directed &quot;Henry V&quot; in 1989. Film critic Terrence Rafferty associated the financial failure with the various superstitions surrounding the play.

===Critical reception===
Upon release, &quot;Macbeth&quot; received mixed reviews, with much negative attention on its violence, in light of the Manson murders, and the nudity, blamed on its &quot;Playboy&quot; associations. Pauline Kael wrote the film &quot;reduces Shakespeare&#x27;s meanings to the banal theme of &#x27;life is a jungle&#x27;&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; staff dismissed the film, writing, &quot;Does Polanski&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot; work? Not especially, but it was an admirable try&quot;. Derek Malcolm, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, called the film shocking but not over-the-top, and Finch and Annis &quot;more or less adequate&quot;.

In contrast, Roger Ebert gave it four stars, writing it was &quot;full of sound and fury&quot; and &quot;All those noble, tragic Macbeths – Orson Welles and Maurice Evans and the others – look like imposters now, and the king is revealed as a scared kid&quot;. Roger Greenspun, for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, said that despite gossip about the film, it is &quot;neither especially nude nor unnecessarily violent&quot;, and that Finch and Annis give great performances. In &quot;New York&quot;, Judith Crist defended the film as traditional, appropriately focusing on Macbeth&#x27;s &quot;moral deterioration&quot;, and suited for youthful audiences, and drew parallel with its blood to the title of Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s 1957 &quot;Macbeth&quot; film, &quot;Throne of Blood&quot;.

Literary critic Sylvan Barnet wrote that, given Shakespeare&#x27;s writing, it was arguable &quot;blood might just as well flow abundantly in a film&quot;. However, he wrote the perceived inspiration from the Theatre of Cruelty is &quot;hard to take&quot;. Troy Patterson, writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, gave the film a B, calling it &quot;Shakespeare as fright show&quot; and Annis a better fit for &quot;Melrose Place&quot;. The &quot;Time Out&quot; review states the realistic acting did not do justice to the poetry, and the film &quot;never quite spirals into dark, uncontrollable nightmare as the Welles version (for all its faults) does&quot;.

Opinions improved with time, with filmmaker and novelist John Sayles saying, &quot;I think it&#x27;s a great piece of filmmaking&quot; in 2007, and novelist Martin Amis saying, &quot;I really think the film is without weaknesses&quot; in 2013. In his &quot;2014 Movie Guide&quot;, Leonard Maltin gave the film three and a half stars, describing it as &quot;Gripping, atmospheric and extremely violent&quot;. The film holds rating on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on reviews, with the consensus &quot;Roman Polanski&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot; is unsettling and uneven, but also undeniably compelling.&quot;

===Accolades===
===Home media===
After a restoration by Sony Pictures Entertainment, the film was placed in the Venice Classics section in the 2014 Venice Film Festival. In Region 1, The Criterion Collection released the film on DVD and Blu-ray in September 2014.

<text>Khagan or Qaghan (Mongolian:; or &quot;Khagan&quot;; ) is a title of imperial rank in Turkic, Mongolic, and some other languages, equal to the status of emperor and someone who rules a khaganate (empire). The female equivalent is Khatun.

It may also be translated as &quot;Khan of Khans&quot;, equivalent to King of Kings. In Bulgarian, the title became known as &quot;Khan&quot;, while in modern Turkic, the title became &quot;Khaan&quot; with the &quot;g&quot; sound becoming almost silent or non-existent; the &quot;ğ&quot; in modern Turkish &quot;Kağan&quot; is also silent. After the division of the Mongol Empire, monarchs of the Yuan dynasty and the Northern Yuan held the title of &quot;Khagan&quot;. &quot;Kağan, Hakan&quot; and &quot;Kaan&quot;, Turkish equivalents of the title are common Turkish names in Turkey.

The common western rendering as Great Khan (or &quot;Grand Khan&quot;), notably in the case of the Mongol Empire, is a translation of &quot;Yekhe Khagan&quot; (&quot;Great Emperor&quot; or &quot;&quot;).

== Etymology ==
The term is of unknown origin and possibly a loanword from the Rouran language. Canadian sinologist Edwin G. Pulleyblank (1962) first suggested that a Xiongnu title, transcribed as (Old Chinese: *&quot;hʷaʔ-hʷaʰ&quot;) might have been the original behind Turkic &quot;qaɣan&quot; ~ &quot;xaɣan&quot;. According to Vovin (2007, 2010) the term comes from &quot;qaγan&quot; (meaning &quot;emperor&quot; or &quot;supreme ruler&quot;) and was later borrowed and used in several languages, especially in Turkic and Mongolic.

Turkic and Mongolic (or Para-Mongolic) origin has been suggested by a number of scholars including Ramstedt, Shiratori, Pulleyblank, Sinor and Doerfer, and was reportedly first used by the Xianbei, as recorded in Book of Song. While Sinor believes &quot;qaγan&quot; or &quot;qapγan&quot; is an intensification of &quot;qan&quot; just as &quot;qap-qara&quot; is an intensification of &quot;qara&quot; &quot;black&quot;, in Turkic (with the eventual loss of the &quot;p&quot;), Shiratori rejects a Turkic etymology, instead supporting a Mongolic origin for both &quot;qan&quot; and the female form &quot;qatun&quot;.

According to Vovin, the word &quot;*qa-qan&quot; &quot;great-qan&quot; (&quot;*qa-&quot; for &quot;great&quot; or &quot;supreme&quot;) is of non-Altaic origin, but instead linked to Yeniseian &quot;*qεʔ ~ qaʔ&quot; &quot;big, great&quot;. The origin of &quot;qan&quot; itself is harder according to Vovin. He says that the origin for the word &quot;qan&quot; is not found in any reconstructed proto-language and was used widely by Turkic, Mongolic, Chinese and Korean people with variations from &quot;kan, qan, han and hwan.&quot; A relation exists possibly to the Yeniseian words &quot;*qʌ:j&quot; or &quot;*χʌ:j&quot; meaning &quot;ruler&quot;. 

It may be impossible to prove the ultimate origin of the title, but Vovin says: &quot;Thus, it seems to be quite likely that the ultimate source of both &quot;qaγan&quot; and &quot;qan&quot; can be traced back to Xiong-nu and Yeniseian&quot;.

Dybo (2007) suggests that the ultimate etymological root of Khagan comes from the Middle Iranian *&quot;hva-kama-&quot; ‘self-ruler, emperor’, following the view of Benveniste 1966. Savelyev and Jeong 2020 note that both the etymological root for Khagan and its female equivalent Khatun may be derived from Eastern Iranian languages, specifically from &quot;Early Saka *&quot;hvatuñ&quot;, cf. the attested Soghdian words &quot;xwt&#x27;w&quot; ‘ruler’ (&lt; *&quot;hva-tāvya-&quot;) and &quot;xwt&#x27;yn&quot; ‘wife of the ruler’ (&lt; *&quot;hva-tāvyani&quot;)&quot;.

==History==
The title was first seen in a speech between 283 and 289, when the Xianbei chief Tuyuhun tried to escape from his younger stepbrother Murong Hui, and began his route from the Liaodong Peninsula to the areas of Ordos Desert. In the speech one of Murong&#x27;s generals, Yinalou, addressed him as &quot;kehan&quot; (, later ); some sources suggests that Tuyuhun might also have used the title after settling at Qinghai Lake in the 3rd century.

The Rouran Khaganate (330–555) was the first people to use the titles Khagan and Khan for their emperors, replacing the Chanyu of the Xiongnu, whom Grousset and others assume to be Turkic. The Rourans were stated to be descendants of the Donghu people, who in turn are assumed to be proto-Mongols, Mongolic-speaking, or a &quot;non-Altaic&quot; group.

The Avar Khaganate (567–804), who may have included Rouran elements after the Göktürks crushed the Rouran ruling Mongolia, also used this title. The Avars invaded Europe, and for over a century ruled the Carpathian region. Westerners Latinized the title &quot;Khagan&quot; into &quot;Gaganus&quot; (in Historia Francorum), &quot;Cagan&quot; (in the Annales Fuldenses), or &quot;Cacano&quot; (in the Historia Langobardorum).

== Mongol khagans ==


&quot;The Secret History of the Mongols&quot;, written for that very dynasty, clearly distinguishes &quot;Khagan&quot; and &quot;Khan&quot;: only Genghis Khan and his ruling descendants are called &quot;Khagan&quot;, while other rulers are referred to as &quot;Khan&quot;. The title &quot;Khagan&quot; or &quot;Khaan&quot; most literally translates to &quot;great/supreme ruler&quot; in the Mongol language, and by extension &quot;sovereign&quot;, &quot;monarch&quot;, &quot;high king&quot;, or &quot;emperor&quot;. The title can also be expanded with the addition of &quot;Yekhe&quot; (meaning &quot;great&quot; or &quot;grand&quot;) to produce &quot;Yekhe Khagan&quot;, meaning &quot;Great Emperor&quot;.

The Mongol Empire began to split politically with the Toluid Civil War during 1260–1264 and the death of Kublai Khan in 1294, but the term &quot;Ikh Khagan&quot; (Great Khan, or Emperor) was still used by the emperors of the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), who also took on the title of the Emperor of China. After the fall of the Yuan dynasty, the title continued to be used by monarchs of the Northern Yuan dynasty. 

Thus, the Yuan is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Empire of the Great Khan&quot;, coexisting with the other independent Mongol-ruled khanates in the west, including the Chagatai Khanate and Golden Horde. Only the Ilkhanate truly recognized the Yuan&#x27;s overlordship as allies (although it was effectively autonomous). Because Kublai founded the Yuan, the members of the other branches of the Borjigin could take part in the election of a new Khagan as the supporters of one or other of the contestants, but they could not enter the contest as candidates themselves. 

Later, Yuan emperors made peace with the three western khanates of the Mongol Empire and were considered as their nominal suzerain. The nominal supremacy, while based on nothing like the same foundations as that of the earlier khagans (such as the continued border clashes among them), did last for a few decades, until the Yuan dynasty collapsed in 1368.

After the breakdown of Mongol Empire and the fall of the Yuan dynasty in the mid-14th century, the Mongols turned into a political turmoil. Dayan Khan (1464–1517/1543) once revived the Emperor&#x27;s authority and recovered its reputation on the Mongolian Plateau, but with the distribution of his empire among his sons and relatives as fiefs it again caused decentralized rule. The last Khagan of the Chahars, Ligdan Khan, died in 1634 while fighting the Jurchen-led Later Jin dynasty. In contemporary Mongolian language the words &quot;Khaan&quot; and &quot;Khan&quot; have different meanings, while English language usually does not differentiate between them. The title is also used as a generic term for a king or emperor (as , ), as in &quot;&quot; (, &quot;king/khaan of Spain Juan Carlos&quot;).

The early khagans of the Mongol Empire were:
# Genghis Khan (1206–1227; 21 years)
# Ögedei Khan (1229–1241; 12 years)
# Güyük Khan (1246–1248; 2 years)
# Möngke Khan (1251–1259; 8 years)

== Among Turkic peoples ==

The title became associated with the Ashina ruling clan of the Göktürks and their dynastic successors among such peoples as the Khazars (cf. the compound military title Khagan Bek). Minor rulers were rather relegated to the lower title of khan.

Both Khagan as such and the Turkish form Hakan, with the specification in Arabic &quot;al-Barrayn wa al-Bahrayn&quot; (meaning literally &quot;of both lands and both seas&quot;), or rather fully in Ottoman Turkish &quot;Hakan ül-Berreyn vel-Bahreyn&quot;, were among the titles in the official full style of the Great Sultan (and later Caliph) of the Ottoman Empire, reflecting the historical legitimation of the dynasty&#x27;s rule as political successor to various conquered (often Islamised) states. (The title began: Sultan Hân N.N., Padishah, &quot;Hünkar&quot;, Sovereign of the House of Osman, Sultan of Sultans, Khan of Khans, Commander of the Faithful and Successor of the Prophet of the Lord of the Universe; next followed a series of specifically &quot;regional&quot; titles, starting with Protector of the Holy Cities of Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem.)

&quot;Khagan&quot; is the second title of Safavid and Qajar shahs (kings) of Iran. For example, Agha Muhammad Khan Qajar, Fath Ali Shah and other Qajar shahs used this title. The nickname of Shah Ismail and other Safavid shahs is &quot;Kagan-i Suleyman shan&quot; (Khagan with the glory of Solomon).

=== Ottoman Empire ===

Ottoman rulers, after the 14th century, used only two titles &quot;shah&quot; and &quot;khan&quot; until end of the empire. Sultans like Mehmed the Conqueror and Suleiman the Magnificent used the title &quot;Khagan of the two seas&quot;. Yazıcıoğlu Ali, in early 15th century, traced Osman&#x27;s genealogy to Oghuz Khagan, the mythical ancestors of Western Turks, through his senior grandson of his senior son, so giving the Ottoman sultans primacy among Turkish monarchs. Though it was not entirely an imitation of Genghis Khanid doctrine, the Oghuz claim to sovereignty followed the same pattern. Bayezid I advanced this claim against Timur, who denigrated the Ottoman lineage.

== Chinese khagans ==

The &quot;Book of Wei&quot;, a Chinese history book, records that the title Khagan (可汗) and the title Huángdì (皇帝) are the same. Emperor Taizong of Tang was crowned Tian Kehan, or &quot;heavenly Khagan&quot; after defeating the Tujue (Göktürks). A later letter sent by the Tang court to the Yenisei Kirghiz Qaghan explained that &quot;the peoples of the northwest&quot; had requested Tang Taizong to become the &quot;Heavenly Qaghan&quot;. The Tang dynasty Chinese emperors were recognized as khagans of the Turks at least from 665 to 705; moreover, two appeal letters from the Turkic hybrid rulers, Ashina Qutluγ Ton Tardu in 727, the Yabgu of Tokharistan, and Yina Tudun Qule in 741, the king of Tashkent, addressing Emperor Xuanzong of Tang as Tian Kehan during the Umayyad expansion.

The name &quot;Chinese khagan&quot; (&quot;Khāqān-i Chīn&quot;, &quot;Khagan of China&quot;) referring to the ruler of China (i.e. Emperor of China) as a symbol of power appeared in medieval Turco-Persian literature works like the great 11th-century epic poem Shahnameh, which were circulated widely in Persia, Central Asia, and Xinjiang. During the Manchu-led Qing dynasty which extended into Inner Asia by the 18th century, their Turkic Muslim subjects (and surrounding Muslim khanates like the Khanate of Kokand) associated the Qing rulers with this name and commonly referred to the Qing emperors as the &quot;Chinese khagan&quot; (&quot;Khāqān-i Chīn&quot;).

== Among the Slavs ==
In the early 10th century, the Rus&#x27; people employed the title of &quot;kagan&quot; (or &quot;qaghan&quot;), reported by the Persian geographer Ahmad ibn Rustah, who wrote between 903 and 913.

It is believed that the tradition endured in the eleventh century, as the metropolitan bishop of Kiev in the Kievan Rus&#x27;, Hilarion of Kiev, calls both grand prince Vladimir I of Kiev (978–1015) and grand prince Yaroslav the Wise (1019–1054) by the title of &quot;kagan&quot;, while a graffito on the walls of Saint Sophia&#x27;s Cathedral gives the same title to the son of Iaroslav, grand prince Sviatoslav II of Kiev (1073–1076).

<doc id="533384" wikidata="Q845112" url="?curid=533384" title="Enceladus (Giant)">
<text>In Greek mythology, Enceladus () was one of the Giants, the offspring of Gaia (Earth) and Uranus (Sky). Enceladus was the traditional opponent of Athena during the Gigantomachy, the war between the Giants and the gods, and was said to be buried under Mount Etna in Sicily.

== Mythology ==
Enceladus was one of the Giants, who (according to Hesiod) were the offspring of Gaia, born from the blood that fell when Uranus was castrated by their son Cronus. The Giants fought Zeus and the other Olympian gods in the Gigantomachy, their epic battle for control of the cosmos. A Giant named Enceladus, fighting Athena, is attested in art as early as an Attic black-figure pot dating from the second quarter of the sixth century BC (Louvre E732). In literature, references to the Giant occur as early as the plays of the fifth-century BC Greek tragedian Euripides, where, for example, in Euripides&#x27; &quot;Ion&quot;, the chorus describes seeing on the late sixth-century Temple of Apollo at Delphi, Athena &quot;brandishing her gorgon shield against Enceladus&quot;. Although traditionally opposed by Athena, Virgil and others have Enceladus being struck down by Zeus. In Euripides&#x27; comic satyr play &quot;Cyclops&quot;, Silenus, the drunken companion of the wine god Dionysus, boasts of having killed Enceladus with his spear.

The third-century BC poet Callimachus has Enceladus buried under the island of Sicily, and according to the mythographer Apollodorus, Athena hurled the island of Sicily at the fleeing Enceladus during the Gigantomachy. The Latin poets Virgil, Statius and Claudian all locate his burial under Mount Etna, although other traditions had the monster Typhon or the Hundred-Hander Briareus buried under Etna. For some Enceladus was instead buried in Italy.

The Latin poet Horace has Enceladus use trees as spears. The second-century geographer Pausanias reports that a Tegean statue of Athena was called &quot;horse goddess&quot; because, according to a local account, Athena &quot;drove the chariot and horses against Enceladus&quot;. Claudian calls Enceladus &quot;all powerful king of the Earth-born giants&quot;, and has Gaia, imagining the Giants victorious, propose that &quot;Enceladus, rule the sea&quot;.

== The &quot;Dionysiaca&quot; ==
The fifth-century Greek poet Nonnus, in his poem &quot;Dionysiaca&quot;, mentions Enceladus as one of the several Giants that Dionysus battles in the Gigantomachy. Nonnus has Gaia set the Giants against Dionysus, promising Enceladus Athena as his wife should the Giants subdue Dionysus. Dionysus fought Enceladus with fire, but Enceladus was ultimately defeated by Zeus:&quot;[Dionysus] roasted the Giants&#x27; bodies with a great conflagration, an image on earth of the thunderbolt cast by Zeus. The torches blazed: fire was rolling all over the head of Encelados and making the air hot, but it did not vanquish him—Encelados bent not his knee in the steam of the earthly fire, since he was reserved for a thunderbolt.&quot;

== Cause of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes ==
Enceladus—like Typhon, Briareus and other vanquished monsters thought to be buried under volcanos—was said to be the cause of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Mount Etna&#x27;s eruptions were said to be the breath of Enceladus, and its tremors to be caused by him rolling over from side to side beneath the mountain. So, for example Virgil:&lt;poem&gt;Enceladus, his body lightning-scarred,
lies prisoned under all, so runs the tale:
o&#x27;er him gigantic Aetna breathes in fire
from crack and seam; and if he haply turn
to change his wearied side, Trinacria&#x27;s isle
trembles and moans, and thick fumes mantle heaven.&lt;/poem&gt; the c. 1st-century poem &quot;Aetna&quot; (perhaps written by Lucilius Junior):In Trinacrian waters Enceladus dies and is buried under Aetna by Jove&#x27;s decree; with the ponderous mountain above him he tosses restlessly, and defiantly breathes from his throat a penal fire.and Claudian:In the midst of the island rise the charred cliffs of Aetna, eloquent monument of Jove’s victory over the Giants, the tomb of Enceladus, whose bound and bruisèd body breathes forth endless sulphur clouds from its burning wounds. Whene’er his rebellious shoulders shift their burden to the right or left, the island is shaken from its foundations and the walls of tottering cities sway this way and that.

==Iconography==
The battle between Athena and Enceladus was a popular theme in Greek vase paintings, with examples from as early as the middle of the sixth century BC. From the description given in Euripides&#x27; &quot;Ion&quot;, the battle was apparently depicted on the late sixth-century BC Temple of Apollo at Delphi.

The east pediment of the Old Temple of Athena on the Acropolis of Athens, dating from the late sixth century, prominently displayed Athena standing over a fallen giant, possibly Enceladus. The battle was probably also depicted on the new &quot;peplos&quot; (robe) presented to Athena on the Acropolis of Athens as part of the Panathenaic festival.

== In later art and literature ==

At Versailles, Louis XIV&#x27;s consistent iconographic theme of the triumphs of Apollo and the Olympians against all adversaries included the fountain of Enceladus in its own &quot;cabinet de verdure&quot;, the Bosquet de l&#x27;Encélade, which was cut into the surrounding woodland and outlined by trelliswork; the ensemble has recently been restored. According to an engraving of the fountain by Le Pautre (1677), the sculptor of the gilt-bronze Enceladus was Gaspar Mercy of Cambrai.

William Shakespeare mentions &quot;Enceladus&quot; in &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;, Act 4, sc. 2, L 96. &quot;I tell you younglings, not Enceladus.&quot;

John Keats mentions Enceladus among the Titans in his &quot;Hyperion&quot; (1818/1819).

Porthos is likened to Enceladus when he is buried in a rock fall in &quot;The Man in the Iron Mask&quot; by Alexandre Dumas.

In Herman Melville&#x27;s , the image of Enceladus appears multiple times; the protagonist identifies with Enceladus in a dream.

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, inspired by the suffering of the Second Italian War of Independence, wrote his poem &quot;Enceladus&quot; in 1859.

== Namesakes ==
Enceladus, a moon of the planet Saturn, is named after the mythological Enceladus. Its south pole is interspersed with massive geysers of ice and water vapor that shoot hundreds of miles from its interior. The moon is considered by scientists to be one of the most likely locations in the Solar System to offer some habitability potential for microscopic life.

One of two surviving Short Belfast military transport aircraft is dubbed &quot;Enceladus&quot;.

In Antarctica, there is a grouping of nunataks (ridge) on Alexander Island called the Enceladus Nunataks—but these nunataks were named after Saturn&#x27;s moon, not after the giants of Greek mythology.

The Finnish eSports organisation ENCE takes its name from Enceladus.

<doc id="533389" wikidata="Q7203122" url="?curid=533389" title="Play the white man">
<text>To play the white man is an idiom which is used in parts of Great Britain and it means that someone is attempting to be decent and trustworthy in his or her actions. The phrase is commonly used by natives of the Yorkshire and the Humber region. 

A similar expression, which originated in the Southern United States in the 20th century, is that&#x27;s mighty white of you and variations thereof, and they mean &quot;thank you for being fair.&quot; Because of its racist connotations, since the mid-to-late 20th century, it has mostly been used ironically when it has been used at all.

In film lore, the phrase &quot;that&#x27;s mighty white of you&quot; was used in the film &quot;After the Thin Man&quot; (1936) by the character Nick Charles as said to the character Dancer, the night club host, who stated that he would pay for all the drinks at Nick&#x27;s table. A year later in another &quot;William Powell&quot; / &quot;Myrna Loy&quot; film &quot;Double Wedding&quot; (1937), the phrase is used by the character Mrs. Bly. It&#x27;s also used in other classic-era films like &quot;Whistling in Brooklyn&quot; (1943) by the character Wally Benton, &quot;Western Union&quot; (1941) by the character Vance Shaw, and &quot;The Miracle of Morgan’s Creek&quot; (1944) by the character Constable Edmund Kockenlocker. It is also used by Clint Eastwood as Inspector Harry Callaghan in the 1976 film &quot;The Enforcer&quot;, and by Sean Penn&#x27;s character, Mr. Wasey, in the 1986 movie, &quot;Shanghai Surprise&quot;. It is used as a typical 1937 Southern expression in the film &quot;O Brother Where Art Thou&quot; (2000).

The phrase &quot;It was damn white of him.&quot; was uttered by the character Arthur Manning, speaking to Perry Mason, in Erle Stanley Gardner&#x27;s &quot;The Case of the Dangerous Dowager.&quot;

<doc id="533392" wikidata="Q5448193" url="?curid=533392" title="March 1977 Fijian general election">
<text>General elections were held in Fiji between 19 March and 2 April 1977. As a result of a split in the ethnic Fijian vote, the ruling Alliance Party of Prime Minister Kamisese Mara suffered a narrow defeat. Although the Alliance Party received the most votes, it won only 24 seats, two fewer than the Indo-Fijian-dominated National Federation Party (NFP). One seat was won by the Fijian Nationalist Party, with the remaining seat going to an independent candidate, Osea Gavidi.

Although the NFP emerged as the largest party, Governor-General George Cakobau asked Mara to form a new government, claiming that he had the support of the majority of the House. The new government remained in office until early elections in September the same year.

==Results==
Around 25% of the Fijian vote went to the new Fijian Nationalist Party of Sakeasi Butadroka, an extremist organisation that ran on a &quot;Fiji for the Fijians&quot; platform and advocated the repatriation of Indo-Fijians to India.

Three ministers – Peniame Naqasima, Josua Toganivalu and Sakiasi Waqanivavalagi – lost their seats.

==Aftermath==
Following the elections Mara resigned as Prime Minister on 5 April and turned down offers from the NFP to participate in a coalition government. It was expected that the NFP would be unable to form a government without a majority, but independent MP Osea Gavidi announced that he would support the party, giving it a two-seat majority. However, Gavidi changed his mind the following day.

Four days after the election, Sidiq Koya arrived at Government House expecting to be offered the opportunity to form a government. However, he was told by Governor-General Cakobau that he had reappointed Mara. Cakobau then made a statement claiming that Mara had the support of the majority of MPs. &quot;Pacific Islands Monthly&quot; reported that following an NFP meeting to discuss the allocation of cabinet portfolios (in which Koya only narrowly won a vote to remain leader of the party), opponents of Koya had passed a message to the Governor-General stating that they would not support him as Prime Minister. Supporters of Koya subsequently blamed a faction led by NFP president Irene Jai Narayan for keeping the party out of office.

In June Mara moved a motion of confidence in his government. The NFP proposed an amendment that the Governor-General should ignore any request from Mara to dissolve parliament if the motion was defeated, and instead appoint Koya as Prime Minister. House Leader Jonati Mavoa claimed that the Governor-General had no legal right to ignore such a request. The NFP amendment passed after Butadroka voted in favour. However, Cakobau dissolved parliament at the end of June, with fresh elections later scheduled for September.

<text>Trailer trash is a derogatory North American English term for poor people living in a trailer or a run-down mobile home in a bad neighborhood. It is particularly used to denigrate white people living in such circumstances.

==History==
In the mid-20th century, poor whites who could not afford to buy suburban-style tract housing began to purchase mobile homes, which were not only cheaper but could be easily relocated if work in one location ran out. These – sometimes by choice and sometimes through local zoning laws – gathered in trailer parks, and the people who lived in them became known as &quot;trailer trash&quot; with the term dating to at least 1952. Despite many of them having jobs, albeit sometimes itinerant ones, the character flaws that had been perceived in poor white trash in the past were transferred to trailer trash, and trailer camps or parks were seen as being inhabited by retired people, migrant workers, and, generally, the poor. By 1968, a survey found that only 13% of those who owned and lived in mobile homes had white collar jobs.

Trailers got their start in the 1930s, and their use proliferated during the housing shortage of World War II when the Federal government used as many as 30,000 of them to house defense workers, soldiers, and sailors throughout the country, but especially around areas with a large military or defense presence, such as Mobile, Alabama and Pascagoula, Mississippi. In her book &quot;Journey Through Chaos&quot;, reporter Agnes Meyer of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; traveled throughout the country, reporting on the condition of the &quot;neglected rural areas&quot;, and described the people who lived in the trailers, tents, and shacks in such areas as malnourished, unable to read or write, and generally ragged. The workers who came to Mobile and Pascagoula to work in the shipyards there were from the backwoods of the South, &quot;subnormal swamp and mountain folk&quot; whom the locals described as &quot;vermin&quot;; elsewhere, they were called &quot;squatters&quot;. They were accused of having loose morals, high illegitimacy and crime rates, and of allowing prostitution to thrive in their &quot;Hillbilly Havens&quot;, and letting their children go undisciplined, causing high juvenile delinquency rates. The trailers themselves – sometimes purchased second- or third-hand – were often unsightly, unsanitary, and dilapidated, causing communities to zone them away from the more desirable neighborhoods, which meant away from schools, stores, and other necessary facilities, often literally on the other sides of the railroad tracks.

<text>The Royal Veterinary College (informally the RVC) is a veterinary school located in London and a member institution of the federal University of London. The RVC was founded in 1791 and joined the University of London in 1949. It is the oldest and largest Veterinary school in the United Kingdom, and one of only 11 in the country where students can study to become a vet.

==History==
===18th century===
The Veterinary College of London was founded in 1791 by a group led by Granville Penn, a grandson of William Penn, following the foundation of the first veterinary college in Europe in Lyon, France, in 1762. The promoters wished to select a site close to the metropolis, but far enough away to minimise the temptations open to the students, who were all men. Earl Camden was just then making arrangements to develop some fields he owned to the north of London, and he replied to the college&#x27;s newspaper advertisement for a suitable site with an offer to sell it some of his land. The site was rural, but urban developments appeared on all sides in the early decades of the 19th century, creating Camden Town.
Charles Benoit Vial de St Bel of the Lyon establishment was appointed as the first principal of the new college. The first students, just four of them, began their studies in 1792, and the first horse was admitted for treatment in 1793. St Bel died later that year and was succeeded by Edward Coleman, who managed the college for nearly forty six years and established its reputation. Among the first students were Delabere Pritchett Blaine and Bracy Clark. In its early years it was mainly concerned with horses, but the range of animals covered gradually increased. The original building was a quadrangle in a neoclassical style, and there was a paddock on the opposite side of Royal College Street, but this was later sold for housing development.

In 1796 John Shipp was the first qualified veterinary surgeon to join the British Army.

===19th century===
The college first acquired royal patronage from King George IV. In 1844 it was awarded a royal charter.

In 1865 RVC Professor James Beart Simonds was appointed as the first Chief Inspector and Veterinary Advisor to the Privy council, with particular regard to cattle plague.

In 1875 college was granted a royal charter as the Royal Veterinary College; it remains the only veterinary college in the UK to have its own royal charter.

In 1879 the Cheap Practice Clinic was established, later known as the Poor People&#x27;s Out-Patients Clinic. Some veterinary surgeons were concerned that the college was threatening their livelihoods, but the college argued that poor people could not afford veterinary fees, therefore their animals would go untreated if the Clinic were closed.

The college celebrated its centenary in 1891 and in that year the Students&#x27; Union was founded. In 1895 the first X-ray machine was acquired.

===20th century===
There was a major renovation in 1907 of the college horse boxes, which had fund-raisers&#x27; commemorative shields hung at their doorways.

Women were admitted to the College after the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 came into force. The first women were admitted in 1927.

In 1924 the Research Institute in Animal Pathology was built, headed by Professor John McFadyean.

Various extensions were added to the Camden Town site over the years. The buildings had become obsolete and in 1927 were officially declared dangerous structures. A fund-raising scheme for the total rebuilding of the college was launched by the new principal, Professor Sir Frederick Hobday.

In 1932 the Beaumont Animals&#x27; Hospital opened.

New buildings were opened by King George VI in November 1937.

During the Second World War, the RVC evacuated to Streatley, Berkshire, although the Beaumont Animals&#x27; Hospital remained open at Camden Town.

In 1949 the RVC became a school of the University of London.

In 1958 the Hawkshead field station, in Hertfordshire, was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II.

In the 1980s the Royal Veterinary College Animal Care Trust was launched with the Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother as patron, and the Queen Mother Hospital for Animals was opened at Hawkshead by the Queen Mother. Princess Anne, the Princess Royal, and Chancellor of the University of London, opened the surgical wing of the Sefton Equine Referral Hospital.

The bicentenary celebrations were held in 1991. The skeleton of the famous racehorse Eclipse, dissected in 1789 by St. Bel was once more the property of the RVC and was placed on display in the museum at Hawkshead.

Geoffrey Mead was appointed to the &quot;Vestey Chair of Food Safety and Veterinary Public Health&quot; in 1992, mentioned in a 2000 book, and described by a third party as &quot;the first post of its kind in the UK&quot;; however a search of the RVC website in August 2020 does not reveal any mention of Vestey or such a chair.

===21st century===
The London BioScience Innovation Centre was opened in 2001.

The Learning Resource Centre (Eclipse Building) was officially opened at Hawkshead by the Queen in October 2003. The Large Animal Clinical Centre was officially opened by Prince Philip The Duke of Edinburgh in October 2003.

In 2005 the Duchess of Cornwall visited the Hawkshead Campus as new Patron of the Royal Veterinary College Animal Care Trust.

The LIVE Centre at Hawkshead was officially opened by The Princess Royal in February 2007.

Stuart Reid was appointed principal of the RVC in late 2010.

==Campuses==

The RVC has two campuses, one in Camden in Central London and the other near Potters Bar in Hertfordshire. On the Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine course, students spend two years in Camden followed by three years in Potters Bar.

The 1930s buildings on Royal College Street in Camden Town, near St Pancras railway station remain, with minor extensions. Around half of the undergraduate students are based there at any one time. The Camden campus is also home to the main bulk of the RVC Student Union (RVCSU), including the main college bar, the Haxby.

The Hawkshead Campus is located in Brookmans Park, rural Hertfordshire, about north of central London, was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1959. The majority of the college sports teams train and play on the sports courts and fields at this campus, which is also home to the Queen Mother Hospital for Animals, Bolton&#x27;s Park Farm and the Buttery (a second union-run bar).

==Education==

The college now provides a number of undergraduate courses, including the Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine (BVetMed) as well as accelerated graduate entry BVetMed and a combined BVetMed, Bachelor of Veterinary Science (BSc) degree. BSc degrees are also provided in veterinary nursing, bioveterinary sciences, biological sciences and veterinary pathology, and a foundation degree in veterinary nursing is also offered.

The college also offers the Gateway course; the first year of an extended six-year veterinary degree programme, created for students who are part of the UK Widening Participation cohort. It is designed to equip students with the knowledge, understanding and skills needed to join a career-building veterinary degree course. This is a widening participation programme for UK non-selective state school students whose parents have not been to university and who receive, or would have been eligible between 2004 and 2010 in England, to receive an Education Maintenance Allowance payment.

There is a distance learning department and the Graduate School provides masters courses, PhD studentships and clinical training scholarships in a wide range of disciplines. The college&#x27;s Continuing Professional Development (CPD) Unit is a major academic provider of educational services to the veterinary community.

The RVC has an e-Media Unit which collaborates with other UK veterinary schools on the development of the WikiVet site.

== Student life ==

Students are encouraged to participate in extra-curricular activities both inside and outside of the college authority. The traditional sports of rowing, rugby, netball, hockey, and football are offered for both men and women; more unusually, students take part in sports such as shooting, ice-skating, and polo. For purpose of sports, the RVC is a part of the United Hospitals, and the sports clubs compete (and sometimes socialise) with the London medical schools (such as Barts, ICSM, and RUMS).

There are also a number of academically inclined clubs, such as the Farm Animal Clinical Club, the Student Equine Veterinary Association, and the Zoological Society. Non-academic societies include the Music Society, performing arts, games society, and the International Veterinary Students&#x27; Association (IVSA).

The Students&#x27; Union runs a number of events throughout the year. In the past, these have included a May Ball, Christmas Ball and Sports Ball, as well as a Halfway Dinner (which takes place in the second term of third year for students on the BVetMed course), Burns Night, an elaborate Freshers&#x27; Week and Raising and Giving (RAG) Fortnight. The union itself is steadily growing and includes representatives of the Association of Veterinary Students and IVSA; based out of Hawkshead House on the Hawkshead Campus, it provides social and academic opportunities for students of all cohorts and courses. A &#x27;Camden vs. Hawkshead&#x27; competition, traditionally taking place between pre-clinical and clinical students, is traditionally held in spring each year. Since 2018, a &#x27;varsity&#x27; weekend has also taken place between the RVC and the veterinary school at the University of Surrey; the inaugural event was hosted at Surrey but won by the RVC.

Students on the BVetMed course are invited to attend events organised by the Association of Veterinary Students (AVS) such as Sports Weekend (where the schools compete against each other in unisex football, rugby, netball, and other games) and the annual academic Congress. These allow veterinary students from the UK veterinary schools and the University College Dublin veterinary faculty to convene once or twice a year to socialise, network and compete. Sports Weekend was last held at the RVC in 2016, and Congress in 2019.

RVC students are also invited to participate in societies run by other universities in London; the University of London Union offers a selection of sports and societies, as does the Imperial College School of Medicine Students&#x27; Union, and students tend to take advantage of these opportunities as well as being involved in RVC societies.

==Research==
The Research Assessment Exercise in 2008 ranked the RVC as England&#x27;s best veterinary school of those institutions whose research is exclusively veterinary related. 55% of their submitted academic staff were viewed as producing &quot;world class&quot; or &quot;internationally excellent&quot; research. It is a self-governing college within the University of London and its scientists work together in interdisciplinary teams within one research division.

The disciplines of Epidemiology, Microbiology, Pathology, Immunology and Clinical Science are drawn together in the Centre for Emerging, Endemic and Exotic Diseases (CEEED Centre), opened in 2008.

Animal Welfare and the Animal Welfare unit situated at the college are fundamental to the RVC&#x27;s research mission and underpins their research programmes. The Structure and Motion Laboratory of the college also has facilities to study locomotion. Understanding how animals and people move is fundamental to musculoskeletal health and diseases that result from ageing, physical activity and the environment. The leaders of this Centre of Excellence are at the forefront of developing technologies to study animal movement, which are used in both basic and applied research.

The RVC has a Clinical Investigation Centre, co-ordinating disciplined study of its clinical caseload through its electronic patient record system and undertaking Phase II Clinical Trials under a Home Office license. They aim to translate research into solutions for veterinary and human medicine and use their expertise and veterinary patient caseload to undertake comparative research of both biomedical and veterinary significance.

==Clinical services==
The RVC runs three animal hospitals and three first opinion practices, all based in London and Hertfordshire. The hospitals treat over 20,000 patients per year.

For small animals, the RVC runs the Beaumont Sainsbury Animal Hospital, a first-opinion hospital based at the RVC&#x27;s Camden campus, and the Queen Mother Hospital for Animals, an animal referral hospital which provides clinical services in a wide range of specialities.

The equine services include the Equine Practice which is a first opinion ambulatory service, serving Hertfordshire and other local areas and the Equine Referral Hospital which provides referral clinical services to equine practices and horse owners throughout the south of England.

The RVC operates a referral farm animal hospital at its Hawkshead Campus, which provides full hospitalisation, diagnostic and surgical facilities for individual farm animals. The college has a collaboration with the Dairy Development centre, the Welsh Regional Veterinary Centre (WRVC), which provides a farm health investigation service to vets and farmers in the South Wales region.

<doc id="533399" wikidata="Q197383" url="?curid=533399" title="Fokino, Primorsky Krai">
<text>Fokino () is a closed town in Primorsky Krai, Russia, located on the coast of the Peter the Great Gulf, on the Abrek Bay, about south of Vladivostok, the administrative center of the krai. Population: 

It was previously known as &quot;Tikhookeansky&quot; (until 1980), &quot;Shkotovo-17&quot; (until 1994).

==History==
The village of Promyslovka was founded on the current site of Fokino in 1891. Promyslovka was granted urban-type settlement status in 1958, and the nearby naval village of Tikhookeansky followed suit in 1963. The settlements grew together, were merged, and were granted town status on October 4, 1980. However, due to its status as a base for the Russian Pacific Fleet, the town was closed, and referred to officially under the code name Shkotovo-17. Since 1994, Fokino has been the official name of the town.

After the APEC-2012 Summit was held in Vladivostok, Fokino will become the main naval base at the Russian Far East, where the Russian Pacific Fleet will be attached.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with two urban-type settlements (Dunay and Putyatin), incorporated as Fokino Town Under Krai Jurisdiction—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, Fokino Town Under Krai Jurisdiction is incorporated as Fokino Urban Okrug.

==Tourism==
It is a closed town because the Russian Pacific Fleet is based there. Foreigners must have a special permit to visit the town. However, the islands of Putyatin and Askold, which are a part of the territory administered by the town, are open for visits by tourists. Up to two thousand tourists visit Putyatin every year. They are attracted by the unique flora and fauna in the waters surrounding this island and its underwater landscape. Approximately 2,400 people inhabit Putyatin Island. Their main occupation is catching and processing sea products, breeding mink and spotted deer.

There is no permanent population on Askold. It is rarely visited by tourists because of the absence of regular transport connections with the mainland, and the status of the island which until 1995 had formed part of the Reserve where no economic activity was allowed. There are deposits of gold estimated at dozens of tonnes on Askold.

<doc id="533405" wikidata="Q1929419" url="?curid=533405" title="Michael Smith (Irish politician)">
<text>Michael Smith (born 8 November 1940) is an Irish former Fianna Fáil politician who served as Minister for Defence from 1997 to 2004, Minister for Education from November 1994 to December 1994, Minister for the Environment from 1992 to 1994 and a Minister of State in various governments. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Tipperary North constituency from 1969 to 1973, 1977 to 1981 and 1987 to 2002. He also served as a Senator for the Cultural and Educational Panel from 1983 to 1987 and for the Agricultural Panel from May 1982 to December 1982.

==Background and education==
Smith was born in Roscrea, County Tipperary in 1940. He was educated at CBS Templemore in County Tipperary. Smith worked as a farmer before entering Dáil Éireann at the 1969 general election as a Fianna Fáil TD for the Tipperary North constituency.

He lost his seat at the 1973 general election but was re-elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1977 general election.

==Political career==
===1980s===
In 1980, the Taoiseach Charles Haughey appointed him Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture. Smith lost his Dáil seat again at the February 1982 general election, and failed to regain it at the November 1982 general election. He spent the next five years as a Senator in Seanad Éireann, elected first by the Agricultural Panel and then by the Cultural and Educational Panel, before his re-election to the Dáil at the 1987 general election.

When Smith was returned to the Dáil in 1987, he was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Energy. He was appointed to cabinet as the Minister for Energy in 1988. His stay in cabinet was brief; following the 1989 general election he was demoted to Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce.

===1992–2007===
In February 1992, he returned to cabinet for two years as Minister for the Environment. He held office until Fianna Fáil left government in December 1994.

After the 1997 election, Fianna Fáil returned to government and Smith was appointed as Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science. In October 1997, he replaced David Andrews as Minister for Defence, and held that position until he was dropped from the cabinet in a reshuffle in 2004. During his tenure Smith dealt with the Army deafness compensation issue that ultimately resulted in claims of €300 million against the State.

At the 2007 general election he lost his seat to Noel Coonan of Fine Gael.

<text>UoSAT-2, which is also known as UO-11 and OSCAR-11, is a British satellite orbiting in Low Earth Orbit. The satellite functions as an amateur radio transmitter (known as an OSCAR) and was built at the University of Surrey. It launched into orbit in March 1984 and remains orbital and active, though unstable with irregular periods of transmission. All of the analogue telemetry channels failed in 2005, but as of 2014 the status channels were still operational. The satellite was still heard transmitting telemetry in 2023, thirty-nine years after launch.

It was operated by Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd.

== Characteristics ==
The satellite was the second in the UoSAT series of satellites built by University of Surrey; preceded by UoSAT-1 and followed by UoSAT-3.

The satellite carries a Digitalker speech synthesiser, magnetometers, a CCD camera, a Geiger-Müller tube, and a microphone to detect the vibrations of micrometeoroid impacts. Like UoSAT-1 it transmits telemetry data on the VHF beacon at 1200 baud, using asynchronous AFSK, though now all analogue telemetry channels have failed; on an FM receiver the audio signal resembles the cassette data format of the contemporary BBC Micro computer. Actually it is a BASICODE signal, but no citation. Slight modulation had also been observed on the S band beacon.

UoSAT-2&#x27;s solar arrays were bought at a premium compared to those of UoSAT-1, the design having been space tested by its predecessor.

== Support ==
The British affiliate of AMSAT distributed a library of software for the BBC Micro to track UoSAT-2 and other satellites and analyse telemetry broadcasts. A commercial fixed-frequency receiver, &quot;Astrid&quot;, was also produced by British firm MM Microwave for the education market, with accompanying BBC Micro software to display raw telemetry frames. For versatility the &quot;Astrid&quot; set included a demodulator to load signals through the serial port of any computer.

==South Atlantic anomaly==
As it went around the Earth it encountered data upsets, geo-located around the South Atlantic anomaly.

== Status ==
According to a February 2008 status report the satellite had no viable battery backup, operating only from its solar panels, and a watchdog timer on board was suspending activity for up to three weeks following any power anomaly. At the time of the report it was experiencing continuous sunlight for the last time, with the prediction that &quot;permanent eclipses&quot; in its orbit would begin in the middle of March 2008, limiting transmissions to &quot;a short time, possibly less [than] a single orbit, every 21 days.&quot; By April 2008 the updated prediction was that eclipses would continue until 2019.

After a 21-month gap in observations, UoSAT-2 resumed sending telemetry sometime before 10 December 2009, and is apparently continuing the watchdog-controlled transmission regime, though now on a ten-days-on, ten-days-off schedule. Its condition has not otherwise improved apart from some recovery of battery power, allowing broadcasts to continue into each eclipse.

Current observation reports for UoSAT-2 can be viewed and logged at the Oscar Satellite Status Page.

== 1988 Ski-Trek arctic expedition ==
The satellite was instrumental in providing a communications link, known as &quot;Nordski Comm&quot;, from the Ski-Trek support teams to the expedition party. The position of the skiers&#x27; emergency beacon was calculated daily by Cospas-Sarsat ground stations and relayed to them, and thousands of amateur radio listeners, as a spoken message from the Digitalker on board UoSAT-2. The message could also serve as an emergency channel to the skiers in the event that all other radio links failed.

<text>UltraHLE is a discontinued emulator for the Nintendo 64. Emulating the Nintendo 64 (which was only three years old at the time) made it the first of the N64 emulators to run commercial titles at a playable frame rate on the hardware of the time, and the first emulator for a currently-sold console system, which drew Nintendo to seek legal action against the developers.

==The Ultra High-level (UHLE) technique==
Earlier emulators had sought to accurately emulate all low-level operations of a target machine; this worked well for consoles such as the Super NES and Genesis that were substantially simpler than the computer running the emulator.

HLE was done even before the UltraHLE emulator (to emulate the BIOS, and the SNES enhancement chips). But UltraHLE introduced aggressive optimization and time-savers which go beyond traditional HLE.

Co-authors Epsilon and RealityMan realized that since N64 games were programmed in C, they could intercept (the far fewer) C library calls rather than machine-level operations, and simply reimplement the libraries. Thus UltraHLE is an emulator that is partly implemented as a simulator, in contrast to projects such as MAME. However it paved the way for playable emulators of recent consoles that require considerable graphical computational power which could be simulated easily with available PC graphic cards.

The final implementation was written in C and used the Glide API, specific to 3dfx adapters. Due to the emulator&#x27;s popularity, several Glide to DirectX translation utilities were made specifically for UltraHLE for non-3dfx video cards.

UltraHLE&#x27;s high-level emulation had its drawbacks; at the time of its release it was able to emulate only approximately 20 games to a playable standard as it emulated and simulated only those calls required by those specific games; it was necessary to adapt the emulator for games that used different parts of the N64 hardware. Nevertheless it supported many more titles than other contemporaneous N64 emulation projects such as Project Unreality.

Emulators other than UltraHLE eventually adopted variants of high-level emulation as well. For example, the Dolphin emulator, which emulates the GameCube and Wii, uses HLE to reimplement the Wii&#x27;s IOS operating system, and it also has an option for HLE of the GameCube&#x27;s audio DSP.

==Nintendo&#x27;s response and UltraHLE&#x27;s discontinuation==
Also notable for its time, UltraHLE was capable of playing commercial games while the console was still commercially viable, a feat which was ultimately noticed by Nintendo. In February 1999, Nintendo began the process of filing a lawsuit against the emulator&#x27;s authors, along with the website hosting the emulator. Speaking to &quot;PC Zone&quot;, Nintendo representative Beth Llewellwyn commented: &quot;Nintendo is very disturbed that RealityMan and Epsilon have widely distributed a product designed solely to play infringing copies of copyrighted works developed by Nintendo and its third-party licensees. We are taking measures to further protect and enforce our intellectual property rights which, of course, includes the bringing of legal action.&quot; Despite this, UltraHLE had grown beyond either its authors&#x27; or Nintendo&#x27;s control. Subsequently, Epsilon and RealityMan abandoned their pseudonyms and went silent.

After the source code was leaked in 2002, an OpenGL version of UltraHLE called UltraHLE 2064 was released, though it garnered little acclaim, as several more powerful emulators had subsequently been released. UltraHLE 2064 was available at its official site until the site was de-registered.

<doc id="533423" wikidata="Q1136659" url="?curid=533423" title="Solar water heating">
<text>Solar water heating (SWH) is heating water by sunlight, using a solar thermal collector. A variety of configurations are available at varying cost to provide solutions in different climates and latitudes. SWHs are widely used for residential and some industrial applications.

A Sun-facing collector heats a working fluid that passes into a storage system for later use. SWH are active (pumped) and passive (convection-driven). They use water only, or both water and a working fluid. They are heated directly or via light-concentrating mirrors. They operate independently or as hybrids with electric or gas heaters. In large-scale installations, mirrors may concentrate sunlight into a smaller collector.

As of 2017, global solar hot water (SHW) thermal capacity is 472 GW and the market is dominated by China, the United States and Turkey. Barbados, Austria, Cyprus, Israel and Greece are the leading countries by capacity per person.

==History==
Records of solar collectors in the United States date to before 1900, involving a black-painted tank mounted on a roof. In 1896 Clarence Kemp of Baltimore enclosed a tank in a wooden box, thus creating the first &#x27;batch water heater&#x27; as they are known today. Frank Shuman built the world&#x27;s first solar thermal power station in Maadi, Egypt between 1912 and 1913, using parabolic troughs to power a engine that pumped of water per minute from the Nile River to adjacent cotton fields.

Flat-plate collectors for solar water heating were used in Florida and Southern California in the 1920s. Interest grew in North America after 1960, but especially after the 1973 oil crisis.

Solar power is in use in Australia, Canada, China, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, Portugal, Romania, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States.

===Mediterranean===

Israel, Cyprus and Greece are the &quot;per capita&quot; leaders in the use of solar water heating systems supporting 30%–40% of homes.

Flat plate solar systems were perfected and used on a large scale in Israel. In the 1950s a fuel shortage led the government to forbid heating water between 10 pm and 6 am. Levi Yissar built the first prototype Israeli solar water heater and in 1953 he launched the NerYah Company, Israel&#x27;s first commercial manufacturer of solar water heating. Solar water heaters were used by 20% of the population by 1967. Following the energy crisis in the 1970s, in 1980 Israel required the installation of solar water heaters in all new homes (except high towers with insufficient roof area). As a result, Israel became the world leader in the use of solar energy &quot;per capita&quot; with 85% of households using solar thermal systems (3% of the primary national energy consumption), estimated to save the country of oil a year.

In 2005, Spain became the world&#x27;s first country to require the installation of photovoltaic electricity generation in new buildings, and the second (after Israel) to require the installation of solar water heating systems, in 2006.

===Asia===

After 1960, systems were marketed in Japan.

Australia has a variety of national and state and regulations for solar thermal starting with MRET in 1997.

Solar water heating systems are popular in China, where basic models start at around 1,500 yuan (US$235), around 80% less than in Western countries for a given collector size. At least 30 million Chinese households have one. The popularity is due to efficient evacuated tubes that allow the heaters to function even under gray skies and at temperatures well below freezing.

==Design requirements==
The type, complexity and size of a solar water heating system is mostly determined by:

* Changes in ambient temperature and solar radiation between summer and winter
* Changes in ambient temperature during the day-night cycle
* Possibility of the potable water or collector fluid overheating or freezing

The minimum requirements of the system are typically determined by the amount or temperature of hot water required during winter, when a system&#x27;s output and incoming water temperature are typically at their lowest. The maximum output of the system is determined by the need to prevent the water in the system from becoming too hot.

===Freeze protection===

Freeze protection measures prevent damage to the system due to the expansion of freezing transfer fluid. Drainback systems drain the transfer fluid from the system when the pump stops. Many indirect systems use antifreeze (e.g., propylene glycol) in the heat transfer fluid.

In some direct systems, collectors can be manually drained when freezing is expected. This approach is common in climates where freezing temperatures do not occur often but can be less reliable than an automatic system as it relies on an operator.

The third type of freeze protection is freeze-tolerance, where low-pressure water pipes made of silicone rubber simply expand on freezing. One such collector now has European Solar Keymark accreditation.

Notably, while the need for freeze protection has traditionally been a complicating factor, systems using evacuated tube collectors may be used in climates with moderate frosts without any need for drainback or antifreeze. This is because an evacuated tube system only has water in the thermally insulated header, not in the evacuated tubes themselves. Additional protection is also provided by the controller: if header temperature drops below a set value (typically 2 to 4&#x27;C) the circulating pump is automatically turned on for a short period to pass warmer water to the header.

===Overheat protection===

When no hot water has been used for a day or two, the fluid in the collectors and storage can reach high temperatures in all non-&quot;drainback&quot; systems. When the storage tank in a &quot;drainback&quot; system reaches its desired temperature, the pumps stop, ending the heating process and thus preventing the storage tank from overheating.

Some active systems deliberately cool the water in the storage tank by circulating hot water through the collector at times when there is little sunlight or at night, losing heat. This is most effective in direct or thermal store plumbing and is virtually ineffective in systems that use evacuated tube collectors, due to their superior insulation. Any collector type may still overheat. High pressure, sealed solar thermal systems ultimately rely on the operation of temperature and pressure relief valves. Low pressure, open vented heaters have simpler, more reliable safety controls, typically an open vent.

==Structure and working==
Simple designs include a simple glass-topped insulated box with a flat solar absorber made of dark-colored sheet metal, attached to copper heat exchanger pipes, or a set of metal tubes surrounded by an evacuated (near vacuum) glass cylinder. In industrial cases a parabolic mirror can concentrate sunlight on the tube. Heat is stored in a hot water storage tank. The volume of this tank needs to be larger with solar heating systems to compensate for bad weather and because the optimum final temperature for the solar collector is lower than a typical immersion or combustion heater. The heat transfer fluid (HTF) for the absorber may be water, but more commonly (at least in active systems) is a separate loop of fluid containing anti-freeze and a corrosion inhibitor delivers heat to the tank through a heat exchanger (commonly a coil of copper heat exchanger tubing within the tank). Copper is an important component in solar thermal heating and cooling systems because of its high heat conductivity, atmospheric and water corrosion resistance, sealing and joining by soldering and mechanical strength. Copper is used both in receivers and primary circuits (pipes and heat exchangers for water tanks).

The &#x27;drain-back&#x27; is another lower-maintenance concept. No anti-freeze is required; instead, all the piping is sloped to cause water to drain back to the tank. The tank is not pressurized and operates at atmospheric pressure. As soon as the pump shuts off, flow reverses and the pipes empty before freezing can occur.
Residential solar thermal installations fall into two groups: passive (sometimes called &quot;compact&quot;) and active (sometimes called &quot;pumped&quot;) systems. Both typically include an auxiliary energy source (electric heating element or connection to a gas or fuel oil central heating system) that is activated when the water in the tank falls below a minimum temperature setting, ensuring that hot water is always available. The combination of solar water heating and back-up heat from a wood stove chimney can enable a hot water system to work all year round in cooler climates, without the supplemental heat requirement of a solar water heating system being met with fossil fuels or electricity.

When a solar water heating and hot-water central heating system are used together, solar heat will either be concentrated in a pre-heating tank that feeds into the tank heated by the central heating, or the solar heat exchanger will replace the lower heating element and the upper element will remain to provide for supplemental heat. However, the primary need for central heating is at night and in winter when solar gain is lower. Therefore, solar water heating for washing and bathing is often a better application than central heating because supply and demand are better matched. In many climates, a solar hot water system can provide up to 85% of domestic hot water energy. This can include domestic non-electric concentrating solar thermal systems. In many northern European countries, combined hot water and space heating systems (solar combisystems) are used to provide 15 to 25% of home heating energy. When combined with storage, large scale solar heating can provide 50-97% of annual heat consumption for district heating.

===Heat transfer===

====Direct====
&quot;Direct&quot; or &quot;open loop&quot; systems circulate potable water through the collectors. They are relatively cheap. Drawbacks include:
* They offer little or no overheat protection unless they have a heat export pump.
* They offer little or no freeze protection, unless the collectors are freeze-tolerant or are of the evacuated tube type.
* Collectors accumulate scale in hard water areas, unless an ion-exchange softener is used.

The advent of freeze-tolerant designs expanded the market for SWH to colder climates. In freezing conditions, earlier models were damaged when the water turned to ice, rupturing one or more components.

====Indirect====
&quot;Indirect&quot; or &quot;closed loop&quot; systems use a heat exchanger to transfer heat from the &quot;heat-transfer fluid&quot; (HTF) fluid to the potable water. The most common HTF is an antifreeze/water mix that typically uses non-toxic propylene glycol. After heating in the panels, the HTF travels to the heat exchanger, where its heat is transferred to the potable water. Indirect systems offer freeze protection and typically overheat protection.

===Propulsion===

====Passive====

&quot;Passive&quot; systems rely on heat-driven convection or heat pipes to circulate the working fluid. Passive systems cost less and require low or no maintenance, but are less efficient. Overheating and freezing are major concerns.

====Active====
&quot;Active&quot; systems use one or more pumps to circulate water and/or heating fluid&quot;.&quot; This permits a much wider range of system configurations.

Pumped systems are more expensive to purchase and to operate. However, they operate at higher efficiency and can be more easily controlled.

Active systems have controllers with features such as interaction with a backup electric or gas-driven water heater, calculation and logging of the energy saved, safety functions, remote access and informative displays.

===Passive direct systems===
An &quot;integrated collector storage&quot; (ICS or batch heater) system uses a tank that acts as both storage and collector. Batch heaters are thin rectilinear tanks with a glass side facing the Sun at noon. They are simple and less costly than plate and tube collectors, but they may require bracing if installed on a roof (to support  lbs of water), suffer from significant heat loss at night since the side facing the sun is largely uninsulated and are only suitable in moderate climates.

A &quot;convection heat storage unit&quot; (CHS) system is similar to an ICS system, except the storage tank and collector are physically separated and transfer between the two is driven by convection. CHS systems typically use standard flat-plate type or evacuated tube collectors. The storage tank must be located above the collectors for convection to work properly. The main benefit of CHS systems over ICS systems is that heat loss is largely avoided since the storage tank can be fully insulated. Since the panels are located below the storage tank, heat loss does not cause convection, as the cold water stays at the lowest part of the system.

===Active indirect systems===

&quot;Pressurized antifreeze&quot; systems use a mix of antifreeze (almost always low-toxic propylene glycol) and water mix for HTF in order to prevent freeze damage.

Though effective at preventing freeze damage, antifreeze systems have drawbacks:
* If the HTF gets too hot the glycol degrades into acid and then provides no freeze protection and begins to dissolve the solar loop&#x27;s components.
* Systems without drainback tanks must circulate the HTF – regardless of the temperature of the storage tank – to prevent the HTF from degrading. Excessive temperatures in the tank cause increased scale and sediment build-up, possible severe burns if a tempering valve is not installed, and if used for storage, possible thermostat failure.
* The glycol/water HTF must be replaced every 3–8 years, depending on the temperatures it has experienced.
* Some jurisdictions require more-expensive, double-walled heat exchangers even though propylene glycol is low-toxic.
* Even though the HTF contains glycol to prevent freezing, it circulates hot water from the storage tank into the collectors at low temperatures (e.g. below ), causing substantial heat loss.

A &quot;drainback system&quot; is an active indirect system where the HTF (usually pure water) circulates through the collector, driven by a pump. The collector piping is not pressurized and includes an open drainback reservoir that is contained in conditioned or semi-conditioned space. The HTF remains in the drainback reservoir unless the pump is operating and returns there (emptying the collector) when the pump is switched off. The collector system, including piping, must drain via gravity into the drainback tank. Drainback systems are not subject to freezing or overheating. The pump operates only when appropriate for heat collection, but not to protect the HTF, increasing efficiency and reducing pumping costs.

===Do-it-yourself (DIY)===
Plans for solar water heating systems are available on the Internet. DIY SWH systems are usually cheaper than commercial ones, and they are used both in the developed and developing world. 

===Comparison===
==Components==

===Collector===

Solar thermal collectors capture and retain heat from the sun and use it to heat a liquid. Two important physical principles govern the technology of solar thermal collectors:
* Any hot object ultimately returns to thermal equilibrium with its environment, due to heat loss from conduction, convection and radiation. Efficiency (the proportion of heat energy retained for a predefined time period) is directly related to heat loss from the collector surface. Convection and radiation are the most important sources of heat loss. Thermal insulation is used to slow heat loss from a hot object. This follows the Second law of thermodynamics (the &#x27;equilibrium effect&#x27;).
* Heat is lost more rapidly if the temperature difference between a hot object and its environment is larger. Heat loss is predominantly governed by the thermal gradient between the collector surface and the ambient temperatures. Conduction, convection and radiation all occur more rapidly over large thermal gradients (the delta-&quot;t&quot; effect).

====Flat plate solar ====
Flat plate collectors are an extension of the idea to place a collector in an &#x27;oven&#x27;-like box with glass directly facing the Sun. Most flat plate collectors have two horizontal pipes at the top and bottom, called headers, and many smaller vertical pipes connecting them, called risers. The risers are welded (or similarly connected) to thin absorber fins. Heat-transfer fluid (water or water/antifreeze mix) is pumped from the hot water storage tank or heat exchanger into the collectors&#x27; bottom header, and it travels up the risers, collecting heat from the absorber fins, and then exits the collector out of the top header. Serpentine flat plate collectors differ slightly from this &quot;harp&quot; design, and instead use a single pipe that travels up and down the collector. However, since they cannot be properly drained of water, serpentine flat plate collectors cannot be used in drainback systems.

The type of glass used in flat plate collectors is almost always low-iron, tempered glass. Such glass can withstand significant hail without breaking, which is one of the reasons that flat-plate collectors are considered the most durable collector type.

Unglazed or formed collectors are similar to flat-plate collectors, except they are not thermally insulated nor physically protected by a glass panel. Consequently, these types of collectors are much less efficient when water temperature exceeds ambient air temperatures. For pool heating applications, the water to be heated is often colder than the ambient roof temperature, at which point the lack of thermal insulation allows additional heat to be drawn from the surrounding environment.

====Evacuated tube====

Evacuated tube collectors (ETC) are a way to reduce the heat loss, inherent in flat plates. Since heat loss due to convection cannot cross a vacuum, it forms an efficient isolation mechanism to keep heat inside the collector pipes. Since two flat glass sheets are generally not strong enough to withstand a vacuum, the vacuum is created between two concentric tubes. The inner tube is coated with a thermal absorber. Vacuum life varies from collector to collector, from 5 years to 15 years.

In addition, evacuated tubes contain a very efficient inner system to transfer heat from the tubes to the water in the header at the top of the array. This comprises a copper tube partly filled with a volatile liquid, sealed at both ends, and running down the centre of the tube. The top end of this tube plugs into a socket in the (water filled) header. Heat absorbed by the evacuated tube causes some of the volatile liquid in the copper tube to evaporate and pass to the header. At the header the gas then condenses, releasing heat there, and the liquid runs back down inside the tube.
Since the evacuated tubes themselves do not contain water, they are not vulnerable to frosting. The water passes through the thermally insulated header only, and in climates with moderate frosts, no draindown system is required. 

Also worth noting, since ETCs are (also) exposed on the underside: where they are installed raised from the roof (as in the illustration) they will capture not only direct heat from above, but also heat radiated from surrounding roof on the underside.

Flat plate collectors are generally more efficient than ETC in full sunshine conditions. However, the energy output of flat plate collectors is reduced slightly more than ETCs in cloudy or extremely cold conditions. Most ETCs are made out of annealed glass, which is susceptible to hail, failing given roughly golf ball -sized particles. ETCs made from &quot;coke glass&quot;, which has a green tint, are stronger and less likely to lose their vacuum, but efficiency is slightly reduced due to reduced transparency. ETCs can gather energy from the sun all day long at low angles due to their tubular shape.

===Pump ===

====PV pump====
One way to power an active system is via a photovoltaic (PV) panel. To ensure proper pump performance and longevity, the (DC) pump and PV panel must be suitably matched. Although a PV-powered pump does not operate at night, the controller must ensure that the pump does not operate when the sun is out but the collector water is not hot enough.

PV pumps offer the following advantages:
* Simpler/cheaper installation and maintenance
* Excess PV output can be used for household electricity use or put back into the grid
* Can dehumidify living space
* Can operate during a power outage
* Avoids the carbon consumption from using grid-powered pumps

====Bubble pump====

A bubble pump (also known as geyser pump) is suitable for flat panel as well as vacuum tube systems. In a bubble pump system, the closed HTF circuit is under reduced pressure, which causes the liquid to boil at low temperature as the sun heats it. The steam bubbles form a geyser, causing an upward flow. The bubbles are separated from the hot fluid and condensed at the highest point in the circuit, after which the fluid flows downward toward the heat exchanger caused by the difference in fluid levels. The HTF typically arrives at the heat exchanger at 70 °C and returns to the circulating pump at 50 °C. Pumping typically starts at about 50 °C and increases as the sun rises until equilibrium is reached.

===Controller===

A &quot;differential controller&quot; senses temperature differences between water leaving the solar collector and the water in the storage tank near the heat exchanger. The controller starts the pump when the water in the collector is sufficiently about 8–10 °C warmer than the water in the tank, and stops it when the temperature difference reaches 3–5 °C. This ensures that stored water always gains heat when the pump operates and prevents the pump from excessive cycling on and off. (In direct systems the pump can be triggered with a difference around 4 °C because they have no heat exchanger.)

===Tank===
The simplest collector is a water-filled metal tank in a sunny place. The sun heats the tank. This was how the first systems worked. This setup would be inefficient due to the equilibrium effect: as soon as heating of the tank and water begins, the heat gained is lost to the environment and this continues until the water in the tank reaches ambient temperature. The challenge is to limit the heat loss.
* The storage tank can be situated lower than the collectors, allowing increased freedom in system design and allowing pre-existing storage tanks to be used.
* The storage tank can be hidden from view.
* The storage tank can be placed in conditioned or semi-conditioned space, reducing heat loss.
* Drainback tanks can be used.

====Insulated tank====
ICS or batch collectors reduce heat loss by thermally insulating the tank. This is achieved by encasing the tank in a glass-topped box that allows heat from the sun to reach the water tank. The other walls of the box are thermally insulated, reducing convection and radiation. The box can also have a reflective surface on the inside. This reflects heat lost from the tank back towards the tank. In a simple way one could consider an ICS solar water heater as a water tank that has been enclosed in a type of &#x27;oven&#x27; that retains heat from the sun as well as heat of the water in the tank. Using a box does not eliminate heat loss from the tank to the environment, but it largely reduces this loss.

Standard ICS collectors have a characteristic that strongly limits the efficiency of the collector: a small surface-to-volume ratio. Since the amount of heat that a tank can absorb from the sun is largely dependent on the surface of the tank directly exposed to the sun, it follows that the surface size defines the degree to which the water can be heated by the sun. Cylindrical objects such as the tank in an ICS collector have an inherently small surface-to-volume ratio. Collectors attempt to increase this ratio for efficient warming of the water. Variations on this basic design include collectors that combine smaller water containers and evacuated glass tube technology, a type of ICS system known as an Evacuated Tube Batch (ETB) collector.

==Applications==

===Evacuated tube===

ETSCs can be more useful than other solar collectors during winter season. ETCs can be used for heating and cooling purposes in industries like pharmaceutical and drug, paper, leather and textile and also for residential houses, hospitals, nursing home, hotels, swimming pool etc.

An ETC can operate at a range of temperatures from medium to high for solar hot water, swimming pool, air conditioning and solar cooker.

ETCs higher operational temperature range (up to ) makes them suitable for industrial applications such as steam generation, heat engine and solar drying.

===Swimming pools===
Floating pool covering systems and separate STCs are used for pool heating.

Pool covering systems, whether solid sheets or floating disks, act as insulation and reduce heat loss. Much heat loss occurs through evaporation, and using a cover slows evaporation.

STCs for nonpotable pool water use are often made of plastic. Pool water is mildly corrosive due to chlorine. Water is circulated through the panels using the existing pool filter or supplemental pump. In mild environments, unglazed plastic collectors are more efficient as a direct system. In cold or windy environments evacuated tubes or flat plates in an indirect configuration are used in conjunction with a heat exchanger. This reduces corrosion. A fairly simple differential temperature controller is used to direct the water to the panels or heat exchanger either by turning a valve or operating the pump. Once the pool water has reached the required temperature, a diverter valve is used to return water directly to the pool without heating. Many systems are configured as drainback systems where the water drains into the pool when the water pump is switched off.

The collector panels are usually mounted on a nearby roof, or ground-mounted on a tilted rack. Due to the low temperature difference between the air and the water, the panels are often formed collectors or unglazed flat plate collectors. A simple rule-of-thumb for the required panel area needed is 50% of the pool&#x27;s surface area. This is for areas where pools are used in the summer season only. Adding solar collectors to a conventional outdoor pool, in a cold climate, can typically extend the pool&#x27;s comfortable usage by months and more if an insulating pool cover is used. When sized at 100% coverage most solar hot water systems are capable of heating a pool anywhere from as little as 4 °C for a wind-exposed pool, to as much as 10 °C for a wind-sheltered pool covered consistently with a solar pool blanket.

An active solar energy system analysis program may be used to optimize the solar pool heating system before it is built.

==Energy production==
The amount of heat delivered by a solar water heating system depends primarily on the amount of heat delivered by the sun at a particular place (insolation). In the tropics insolation can be relatively high, e.g. 7 kWh/m2 per day, versus e.g., 3.2 kWh/m2 per day in temperate areas. Even at the same latitude average insolation can vary a great deal from location to location due to differences in local weather patterns and the amount of overcast. Calculators are available for estimating insolation at a site.

Below is a table that gives a rough indication of the specifications and energy that could be expected from a solar water heating system involving some 2 m2 of absorber area of the collector, demonstrating two evacuated tube and three flat plate solar water heating systems. Certification information or figures calculated from those data are used. The bottom two rows give estimates for daily energy production (kWh/day) for a tropical and a temperate scenario. These estimates are for heating water to 50 °C above ambient temperature.

With most solar water heating systems, the energy output scales linearly with the collector surface area.
The figures are fairly similar between the above collectors, yielding some 4 kWh/day in a temperate climate and some 8 kWh/day in a tropical climate when using a collector with a 2 m2 absorber. In the temperate scenario this is sufficient to heat 200 litres of water by some 17 °C. In the tropical scenario the equivalent heating would be by some 33 °C. Many thermosiphon systems have comparable energy output to equivalent active systems. The efficiency of evacuated tube collectors is somewhat lower than for flat plate collectors because the absorbers are narrower than the tubes and the tubes have space between them, resulting in a significantly larger percentage of inactive overall collector area. Some methods of comparison calculate the efficiency of evacuated tube collectors based on the actual absorber area and not on the space occupied as has been done in the above table. Efficiency is reduced at higher temperatures.

==Costs==
In sunny, warm locations, where freeze protection is not necessary, an ICS (batch type) solar water heater can be cost effective.
In higher latitudes, design requirements for cold weather add to system complexity and cost.
This increases &quot;initial&quot; costs, but not life-cycle costs. The biggest single consideration is therefore the large initial financial outlay of solar water heating systems. Offsetting this expense can take years.
The payback period is longer in temperate environments.
Since solar energy is free, operating costs are small.
At higher latitudes, solar heaters may be less effective due to lower insolation, possibly requiring larger and/or dual-heating systems. In some countries government incentives can be significant.

Cost factors (positive and negative) include:
* Price of solar water heater (more complex systems are more expensive)
* Efficiency
* Installation cost
* Electricity used for pumping
* Price of water heating fuel (e.g. gas or electricity) saved per kWh
* Amount of water heating fuel used
* Initial and/or recurring government subsidy
* Maintenance cost (e.g. antifreeze or pump replacements)
* Savings in maintenance of conventional (electric/gas/oil) water heating system

Payback times can vary greatly due to regional sun, extra cost due to frost protection needs of collectors, household hot water use etc. For instance in central and southern Florida the payback period could easily be 7 years or less rather than the 12.6 years indicated on the chart for the United States.


The payback period is shorter given greater insolation. However, even in temperate areas, solar water heating is cost effective. The payback period for photovoltaic systems has historically been much longer. Costs and payback period are shorter if no complementary/backup system is required. thus extending the payback period of such a system.

===Subsidies===
Australia operates a system of Renewable Energy Credits, based on national renewable energy targets.

The Toronto Solar Neighbourhoods Initiative offers subsidies for the purchase of solar water heating units.

==Energy footprint and life cycle assessment==

===Energy footprint===
The source of electricity in an active SWH system determines the extent to which a system contributes to atmospheric carbon during operation. Active solar thermal systems that use mains electricity to pump the fluid through the panels are called &#x27;low carbon solar&#x27;. In most systems the pumping reduces the energy savings by about 8% and the carbon savings of the solar by about 20%. However, low power pumps operate with 1-20W. Assuming a solar collector panel delivering 4 kWh/day and a pump running intermittently from mains electricity for a total of 6 hours during a 12-hour sunny day, the potentially negative effect of such a pump can be reduced to about 3% of the heat produced.

However, PV-powered active solar thermal systems typically use a 5–30 W PV panel and a small, low power diaphragm pump or centrifugal pump to circulate the water. This reduces the operational carbon and energy footprint.

Alternative non-electrical pumping systems may employ thermal expansion and phase changes of liquids and gases.

===Life cycle energy assessment===
Recognised standards can be used to deliver robust and quantitative life cycle assessments (LCA). LCA considers the financial and environmental costs of acquisition of raw materials, manufacturing, transport, using, servicing and disposal of the equipment. Elements include:
* Financial costs and gains
* Energy consumption
* CO2 and other emissions
In terms of energy consumption, some 60% goes into the tank, with 30% towards the collector (thermosiphon flat plate in this case). In Italy, some 11 giga-joules of electricity are used in producing SWH equipment, with about 35% goes toward the tank, with another 35% towards the collector. The main energy-related impact is emissions. The energy used in manufacturing is recovered within the first 2–3 years of use (in southern Europe).

By contrast the energy payback time in the UK is reported as only 2 years. This figure was for a direct system, retrofitted to an existing water store, PV pumped, freeze tolerant and of 2.8 sqm aperture. For comparison, a PV installation took around 5 years to reach energy payback, according to the same comparative study.

In terms of CO2 emissions, a large fraction of the emissions saved is dependent on the degree to which gas or electricity is used to supplement the sun. Using the Eco-indicator 99 points system as a yardstick (i.e. the yearly environmental load of an average European inhabitant) in Greece, a purely gas-driven system may have fewer emissions than a solar system. This calculation assumes that the solar system produces about half of the hot water requirements of a household. But because methane (CH4) emissions from the natural gas fuel cycle dwarf the greenhouse impact of CO2, the net greenhouse emissions (CO2e) from gas-driven systems are vastly greater than for solar heaters, especially if supplemental electricity is also from carbon-free generation.

A test system in Italy produced about 700 kg of CO2, considering all the components of manufacture, use and disposal. Maintenance was identified as an emissions-costly activity when the heat transfer fluid (glycol-based) was replaced. However, the emissions cost was recovered within about two years of use of the equipment.

In Australia, life cycle emissions were also recovered. The tested SWH system had about 20% of the impact of an electrical water heater and half that of a gas water heater.

Analysing their lower impact retrofit freeze-tolerant solar water heating system, Allen &quot;et al.&quot; (qv) reported a production CO2 impact of 337 kg, which is around half the environmental impact reported in the Ardente &quot;et al.&quot; (qv) study.

==System specification and installation==
* Most SWH installations require backup heating.
* The amount of hot water consumed each day must be replaced and heated. In a solar-only system, consuming a high fraction of the water in the reservoir implies significant reservoir temperature variations. The larger the reservoir the smaller the daily temperature variation.
* SWH systems offer significant scale economies in collector and tank costs. Thus the most economically efficient scale meets 100% of the heating needs of the application.
* Direct systems (and some indirect systems using heat exchangers) can be retrofitted to existing stores.
* Equipment components must be insulated to achieve full system benefits. The installation of efficient insulation significantly reduces heat loss.
* The most efficient PV pumps start slowly in low light levels, so they may cause a small amount of unwanted circulation while the collector is cold. The controller must prevent stored hot water from this cooling effect.
* Evacuated tube collector arrays can be adjusted by removing/adding tubes or their heat pipes, allowing customization during/after installation.
* Above 45 degrees latitude, roof mounted sun-facing collectors tend to outproduce wall-mounted collectors. However, arrays of wall-mounted steep collectors can sometimes produce more useful energy because gains in used energy in winter can offset the loss of unused (excess) energy in summer.

<doc id="533425" wikidata="Q5448194" url="?curid=533425" title="September 1977 Fijian general election">
<text>Early general elections were held in Fiji between 17 and 24 September 1977. They followed elections in March which resulted in a hung parliament and no party able to gain a majority. The new election resulted in a landslide win for the Alliance Party (Fiji) led by Prime Minister Kamisese Mara, which won 36 seats out of 52. It was aided by a split in the main opposition, the National Federation Party (NFP) and a decline in support for the Fijian Nationalist Party.

==Background==
The March elections had seen the NFP win 26 seats, the Alliance 24, the Fijian Nationalist Party one and an independent one.

With divisions apparent in the NFP, Governor-General George Cakobau asked Alliance Party leader and incumbent Prime Minister Kamisese Mara to form a government, claiming that Mara was able to command a majority. However, in June the Alliance Party attempted to pass a motion of confidence in the government but lost as the sole Fijian Nationalist Party MP voted against. At the end of June Cakobau dissolved parliament, resulting in fresh elections being held.

Prior to the elections, the NFP openly split in two, with the faction of leader Sidiq Koya and a rival NFP group running against each other in 24 seats. Koya&#x27;s faction was symbolised by a dove, with the rival faction using a hibiscus flower

In August Fijian Nationalist Party leader Sakeasi Butadroka was given a six month jail sentence for inciting racial hatred.

==Results==
Koya lost his seat to a rival NFP candidate Jai Ram Reddy. Sole independent MP Osea Gavidi was narrowly re-elected, with five Alliance MPs being elected unopposed.

==Aftermath==
Following the elections, Mara appointed a twelve-member cabinet. Jai Ram Reddy became Leader of the Opposition.

Bill Clark later became Minister of Lands and Minerals and Sakiasi Waqanivavalagi became Minister of Youth and Sport.

In a cabinet reshuffle in January 1981, Clark became Minister of Energy, David Toganivalu became Minister of Commerce and Industry, Mohammed Ramzan became Minister of Health, Tomasi Vakatora became Minister of Labour, Industry Relations and Immigration, Ted Beddoes became Minister of Tourism, transport and Civil Aviation and Waqanivavalagi added Lands and Mineral Resources to his Youth and Sport portfolio.

<doc id="533426" wikidata="Q2475102" url="?curid=533426" title="Car alarm">
<text>A car alarm is an electronic device installed in a vehicle in an attempt to discourage theft of the vehicle itself, its contents, or both. Car alarms work by emitting high-volume sound (often a vehicle-mounted siren, klaxon, pre-recorded verbal warning, the vehicle&#x27;s own horn, or a combination of these) when the conditions necessary for triggering it are met. Such alarms may also cause the vehicle&#x27;s headlights to flash, may notify the car&#x27;s owner of the incident via a paging system, and may interrupt one or more electrical circuits necessary for the car to start. Although inexpensive to acquire and install, the effectiveness of such devices in deterring vehicle burglary or theft when their only effect is to emit sound appears to be negligible.

==History==
An early version of a car alarm for use as a theft deterrent was invented by an unknown prisoner from Denver in 1913. This version was manually armed, and triggered when someone tried to crank the engine. A later alarm inspired by an early version of a remote starter was published in 1916. This version had the car owner carry a receiver, which would buzz if the car ignition system was tampered with.

==Features==
Car alarms should not be confused with immobilizers; although the purpose of both may be to deter car theft, they operate in a dissimilar fashion. An immobilizer generally will not offer any audible or visual theft deterrence, nor require any more input from the driver than from the driver of a non-immobilizer car.

Car alarms can be divided into two categories:

* OEM (built into the vehicle at the factory)
* Aftermarket (installed at any time after the car has been built, such as by the new car dealer, an auto accessories store, or the vehicle&#x27;s owner)

Alarms often come with a mix of features. Remote car alarms typically consist of an additional radio receiver that allows the owner to wirelessly control the alarm from a key fob. Remote car alarms typically come equipped with an array of sensors along with immobilizers and motion detectors.

Keyless remote car alarms are typically based on strong cryptography authentication methods:
* Radio receiver
* Immobilizer
* Motion detector
* Wireless USB

== Arming and disarming of car alarms ==
===Remotes===
Typically car alarms are disarmed or armed by a remote. The remotes recently use rolling code.

===OEM alarms===
Almost all OEM alarms are typically armed and disarmed with the vehicle&#x27;s keyless entry remote. On many vehicles the key cylinders in the driver or front passenger door activate switches, so that when a key is used in the door the alarm will arm or disarm.
Some vehicles will arm when the power door lock switch is pressed with the driver&#x27;s door open, and the door is subsequently closed.
Some vehicles will disarm if the ignition is turned on; often when the vehicle is equipped with a key-based immobilizer and an alarm, the combination of the valid key code and the ignition disarms the system.

===Aftermarket alarms===
Like OEM alarms, aftermarket systems are usually armed and disarmed via remote. Usually they do not have provisions for external disarming from the key cylinder, but will typically have an override switch mounted in a hidden location.

== Triggers ==

The individual triggers for a car alarm vary widely, depending on the make and model of the vehicle, and the brand and model of the alarm itself (for aftermarket alarms). Since aftermarket alarms are designed to be universal (i.e. compatible with all 12-volt negative ground electrical systems as opposed to one carmaker&#x27;s vehicles), these commonly have trigger inputs that the installer/vehicle owner chooses not to connect, which additionally determines what will set the alarm off.

Generally, OEM alarms monitor the doors and trunk/hatch for unauthorized entry. On some vehicles this is done through pin switches, mercury switches, or microswitches integrated into the latch. On others, the doorlock mechanisms have switches built into them. Some OEM alarms additionally will trigger if the hood is opened, or if the ignition is turned on. A few systems have a shock sensor which will trigger upon a significant impact to the vehicle&#x27;s body, such as window glass being broken. Motion sensors monitoring the vehicle&#x27;s interior are installed in some higher end models.

The simplest aftermarket alarms are one-piece units with a siren and control module. The most common type of sensor is a shock sensor and two wires (12-volt constant power and ground) which are connected to the car&#x27;s battery. This type of alarm is triggered by vibration transferred to the shock sensor, or by voltage changes on the input (the alarm assumes that a sudden change in voltage is due to a door or trunk being opened, or the ignition being turned on); however, it is very prone to false triggers on late-model vehicles with many electronic control modules, which can draw current with the ignition off.

More sophisticated aftermarket alarms are wired into the vehicle&#x27;s electronics individually. Typically, these alarms have inputs for power and ground, as well as for positive- and negative-switched door open circuits, negative trunk and/or hood circuits, and ignition-switched circuits to detect the ignition being turned on; aftermarket alarms also usually have a shock sensor which may be built into the control module or external to it.

In addition, some aftermarket alarms have provisions for optional sensors (these must be purchased separately). The tilt sensor can sense the vehicle being tilted (alerting to towing). Tilt sensors come in digital or mercury. A digital sensor is more accurate since it sets itself, allowing for the vehicle to be placed on a hill and not cause false triggers. A sound discriminator or glass breakage sensor senses only the sound of glass breaking. Typically, a sound discriminator sensor can be eliminated using a shock sensor. Proximity, infrared, or motion sensors sense motion inside or outside the vehicle; these are typically installed on convertible or T-top vehicles. These sensors are usually adjustable in order to avoid false alarms. For example, a shock sensor will sometimes vibrate due to loud noises in the area such as heavy trucks, loud vehicle exhaust, or an accidental bump to the car from a passerby. Proximity sensors often cause false alarms in parking lots when a passerby is entering or exiting a vehicle parked next to the armed car. These often cause the alarm to falsely sense an attempted break-in.

==Effectiveness==

Although car alarms of some kind have been available since the beginning of the automobile era, the dramatic increase in their installation in the 1980s and 1990s coupled with the fact that nearly all types of car alarms are easily triggered accidentally (frequently because of high sensitivity settings) means that people who hear them often ignore them. In 1994, the New York City Police Department claimed that car alarms may actually be making car theft and break-in crimes more frequent. There is one account in 1992 of a thief in New York City rocking a car to deliberately trigger its alarm in order to help conceal the sound of a breaking window.

Because of the large number of false alarms with car alarms, many vehicle manufacturers no longer factory-fit simple noise-making alarms, instead offering silent immobilizers. Alternatively, an aftermarket vehicle tracking system can easily trace stolen vehicles. Most police tracking systems require the user to pay a recurring fee, whereas factory immobilizers are included in the purchase price of the vehicle. GPS locating systems enable the owner of the vehicle to lock and unlock, track, and disable the starter of the vehicle online.

Frequently, false alarms occur because car alarm owners use high sensitivity settings. This may be the main reason why loud bass frequency sound (loud music, other cars or motorcycles with loud exhaust systems, thunderstorms, etc.) can set off car alarms. The second possible reason is that some parts of the alarm system may be improperly installed.

<doc id="533433" wikidata="Q273274" url="?curid=533433" title="Éamon Ó Cuív">
<text>Éamon Ó Cuív (; born 23 June 1950) is an Irish former Fianna Fáil politician who served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Galway West constituency from 1992 to 2024. He previously served as deputy leader of Fianna Fáil from 2011 to 2012, as Minister for Social Protection from 2010 to 2011, Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs from 2002 to 2010, and as a Minister of State from 1997 to 2002. He also served as Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and Minister for Defence from January to March 2011, appointed to these positions in addition to his own on the resignation of other members of the government.

He served as a Senator for the Cultural and Educational Panel from 1989 to 1992.

He unsuccessfully contested the leadership of Fianna Fáil after the resignation of Brian Cowen. He lost to Micheál Martin. Martin appointed Ó Cuív as Deputy leader of Fianna Fáil, following Brian Lenihan Jnr&#x27;s death. However, Ó Cuív ceased to be Deputy leader of Fianna Fáil on 29 February 2012, because of his opposition to his party&#x27;s stance on the European Fiscal Compact. Ó Cuiv is the grandson of Fianna Fáil founder, Taoiseach and President of Ireland, Éamon de Valera.

==Early life==
Ó Cuív is the son of Brian Ó Cuív, professor of Celtic Studies at University College Dublin, and Emer de Valera, who was the last surviving daughter of Fianna Fáil founder, Taoiseach and President of Ireland Éamon de Valera, when she died at the age of 93 in February 2012. He is a nephew of Vivion de Valera, a former TD, and is a first cousin of Síle de Valera, former Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, and Aindrias Ó Caoimh, former judge of the High Court and of the European Court of Justice.

He was born in Blackrock, Dublin and was educated at Oatlands College, Dublin and University College Dublin. Before entering politics, he was the manager of Gaeltacht Co-operative, a company involved in agricultural services including timber milling, tourism and cultural development.

==Surname==
Ó Cuív&#x27;s family surname was changed from by his grandfather Shán Ó Cuív, a Cork journalist. In the early 20th century Shán changed the spelling of his surname to conform to a simplified spelling system of his own invention which he called &quot;An Leitriú Shimplí&quot;. The letter &#x27;v&#x27; is extremely rare in Irish outside modern loanwords, not being one of the 18 letters of the Irish alphabet.

==Political career==
===National politics===
Ó Cuív first stood for election to Dáil Éireann at the 1987 general election in the Galway West constituency, where he was the last-placed of the four Fianna Fáil candidates, only two of whom were elected. He did better in the 1989 general election, substantially increasing his share of the first-preference votes, but was the only one of the three Fianna Fáil candidates not to be elected.

He was then elected to the 19th Seanad as a Senator for the Cultural and Educational Panel. He served there until the 1992 general election, when he finally became a TD for Galway West. His vote had increased significantly and he was elected on the first count, coming a close second for Fianna Fáil behind the Labour Party&#x27;s Michael D. Higgins. At the 1997 general election, he was again elected in second place on the first count, this time being narrowly behind his Fianna Fáil colleague Frank Fahey. At the 2002 general election, he comfortably topped the poll, with over 20% of the first-preference votes. Ó Cuív again topped the poll in Galway West at the 2007 general election.

In 1994, Ó Cuív raised concern amongst some in Fianna Fáil when he suggested the possibility of a prospective conditional return to the Commonwealth of Nations as a gesture to Unionists in Northern Ireland. However, a straw poll of backbench Fianna Fáil TDs in 1998 showed that this had little support.

===Ministerial career===
In 1997, he was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, with responsibility for the Gaeltacht and the islands, serving under his cousin Síle de Valera, who was the senior minister at the department. In 2001, he was reassigned as Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development with responsibility for rural development and the Western Development Commission.

Following the 2002 general election, he was appointed to the cabinet as Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.

He publicly spoke of voting &quot;No&quot; in the first referendum on the Treaty of Nice. This caused controversy as the government of which he was a member had negotiated the Treaty and called for a &quot;Yes&quot; vote.

As minister, he introduced the Official Languages Act 2003, which created the office of An Coimisinéir Teanga.

Ó Cuív was at the centre of a controversy surrounding the official name of An Daingean / Dingle, a small Gaeltacht town in west County Kerry. The residents of the town held a plebiscite in November 2006, to determine which version of the town name should be used. Ó Cuív originally signalled that he was happy to abide by the locals&#x27; decision, but then said that the name could not legally be changed back to Dingle, following advice from the Attorney General of Ireland.

Ó Cuív was re-appointed to the same cabinet position after the 2007 election, and again in 2008 when Brian Cowen succeeded as Taoiseach.

In 2007, Ó Cuív again called for Ireland to return to the Commonwealth as a full member state, in light of the restoration of devolution to Northern Ireland and the meeting of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in Belfast.

In July 2009, Ó Cuív used a government helicopter to open a playground, at the cost of €10,000. On 23 March 2010, in a cabinet reshuffle, he was appointed as Minister for Social Protection. After the resignation of Tony Killeen in January 2011, Ó Cuív was also appointed as Minister for Defence, and he was also appointed Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government after John Gormley&#x27;s resignation days later. On 22 January 2011, after the resignation of Fianna Fáil leader Brian Cowen, Ó Cuív stated that he wished to be a candidate in the resulting election for the leadership of Fianna Fáil. He confirmed this on the TG4 News.

===Opposition===
Ó Cuiv was the Fianna Fáil Spokesperson for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources after Fianna Fáil were ousted from power at the 2011 general election. On 8 August 2011, party leader Micheál Martin, named Ó Cuiv as deputy leader of Fianna Fáil, replacing Brian Lenihan.

On 29 February 2012, Ó Cuív resigned as Fianna Fáil&#x27;s deputy leader and Communications Spokesperson. He resigned from these positions due to dissatisfaction with his party&#x27;s position on the Fiscal Compact Referendum. Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin stated that Ó Cuív would face expulsion from the parliamentary party if he did not vote with the party on the Fiscal Compact in the Dáil. Coming just a week before their party conference, Ó Cuív&#x27;s resignation caused a split down the middle of the Fianna Fáil party.

On 12 July 2012, Ó Cuív was reappointed to the Fianna Fáil front bench as Spokesperson for Agriculture and Food, and on Community Affairs. The post of deputy leader was not filled in the reshuffle. On 8 November 2018, Ó Cuív was sacked from the Fianna Fáil front bench for unveiling a candidate in a Northern Ireland election without the party&#x27;s permission.

In 2018, he was one of 25 TDs to vote against the Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, which proposed to replace the protection of the life of the unborn inserted by the Eighth Amendment with a provision allowing the termination of pregnancy to be regulated by law. This amendment was approved in a referendum in May 2018 by 66.4%, including 65.9% in his constituency. Ó Cuív was one of 15 TDs to vote against the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill, which became law at the end of 2018.

Following the 2020 general election, he said that he was &quot;completely against&quot; Fianna Fáil forming a coalition government with Fine Gael and the Green Party. He later went on to publicly doubt the programme for government.

On 24 July 2024, Ó Cuív announced that he would not contest the next general election.

<doc id="533436" wikidata="Q772421" url="?curid=533436" title="St George's, University of London">
<text>St George&#x27;s, University of London (SGUL), legally the St George&#x27;s Hospital Medical School, was a public university in South London, England. It merged with City, University of London to form City St George&#x27;s, University of London in August 2024. The names &quot;City, University of London&quot; and &quot;St George’s, University of London&quot; will provisionally continue as trading names until March 2025.

St George&#x27;s Hospital has its origins in 1733, and began formal registration of trainee fixtures in 1751. St George&#x27;s affiliated with the University of London soon after the latter&#x27;s establishment in 1836. St George&#x27;s is closely affiliated to St George&#x27;s Hospital and is one of the United Hospitals.

==History==

St George&#x27;s Hospital Medical School was originally established in 1733 as part of St George&#x27;s Hospital at Hyde Park Corner (now the site of The Lanesborough hotel), in central London. The medical school was relocated, together with St George&#x27;s Hospital to Tooting, South London in 1980. A joint faculty with Kingston University, the Faculty of Health and Social Care Sciences, has increased the variety of allied healthcare courses offered at St George&#x27;s, including Nursing, Physiotherapy, Paramedic Science and Radiography.

St George&#x27;s was the first institution in the United Kingdom to offer a four-year graduate entry Medicine degree based on the programme from Flinders University, with which it has an exchange programme. The first intake was in 2000 with 35 students and the course has since been emulated by many other universities. Entry to the course is highly competitive with candidates being required to sit the GAMSAT as part of the application process.

In 2008, St George&#x27;s announced that it planned to merge with Royal Holloway to form a single institution within the University of London. The merger was called off in a joint statement by the two colleges&#x27; principals on 25 September 2009. St George&#x27;s intends to keep working with Royal Holloway in the field of health and social care along with its well-established Joint Faculty with Kingston University. St George&#x27;s, Kingston University and Royal Holloway will continue to collaborate in the field of health and social care as part of the existing SWan (South West London Academic Network) healthcare alliance.

In 2021 merger talks between Royal Holloway and St George’s were reignited after over a decade. The merger was, once again, called off in a joint statement by the two Principals in December 2021.

In 2023, a merger was proposed between St George&#x27;s and City, University of London. It was confirmed in February 2024 that this merger would be going ahead, with the new institution to be named City St George&#x27;s, University of London.

==Campus==
The St George&#x27;s University of London campus is located in the Tooting area of south-west London, and is co-located with St George&#x27;s Hospital, a 1,300 bed major trauma centre.

Teaching facilities at the campus include clinical skills laboratories and a simulation suite allowing students to practice based on real-life situations including surgical and medical emergencies. The university library houses approximately 42,000 books and subscribes to over 10,000 journals.

Previously, the Rob Lowe Sports Centre located at the St George&#x27;s Hospital grounds provided sporting facilities to students and staff, including a sports hall, three squash courts, and weights and fitness rooms. However, the site has recently been decommissioned, with only the sports hall retained. Students have used other facilities instead, including the nearby Tooting Leisure Centre.

==Courses==

St George&#x27;s offers foundation and undergraduate degrees at its site in Tooting in medical, biomedical and healthcare sciences, including: Biomedical Science BSc (Hons), Biomedical Science Foundation Degree, Healthcare Practice DipHE and BSc (Hons), Healthcare Practice Foundation Degree, Healthcare Science (Physiological Sciences) BSc (Hons), Clinical Pharmacology BSc (Hons), Medicine (four-year graduate stream) MBBS4, Medicine (five-year) MBBS5, and Medicine (six-year) MBBS6, Physician Associate Studies MSc.

In partnership with Kingston University, the joint Faculty of Health and Social Care Sciences also offers degrees in physiotherapy, occupational therapy, paramedic science, nursing, midwifery, social work and diagnostic or therapeutic radiography.

St George&#x27;s, in partnership with INTO University Partners, has also formed a joint venture, INTO SGUL, to offer a Foundation in Medical, Biomedical and Health Sciences for international students whose qualifications do not allow direct progression into Bachelors level study in the UK, and a six-year MBBS and a four-year graduate stream MBBS programme specifically for international students, with clinical placements overseas. The first student cohort on each international MBBS programme entered St George&#x27;s in September 2012.

Outside of the UK, the MBBS4 is also offered in Nicosia, Cyprus, through a partnership between St George&#x27;s and the University of Nicosia. The new programme was inaugurated and the first student cohort commenced in Nicosia in September 2011. The programme at the University of Nicosia features international clinical placements in Israel and the United States.

St George&#x27;s also offers numerous research and taught postgraduate degrees.

==Teaching==
St George&#x27;s uses the integrated approach which involves the use of both Case Based Learning (CBL), Problem Based Learning (PBL) and a traditional style of learning with the use of lectures and tutorials. The degree of PBL used in teaching varies between courses, for example, being a major part of the Medicine (Graduate Entry) course but not prominently within the Biomedical Sciences curriculum. Anatomy is taught at St George&#x27;s through prosections and practical within the dissecting room, with anatomical dissection being optional as part of the Summer Dissection Programme.

In the medical curriculum, preclinical teaching (first and second year in the undergraduate stream, and first year in the graduate stream) is largely based on lectures and tutorials held at the St George&#x27;s campus, with a few weeks worth of attachments to various hospital departments. The third year of the undergraduate stream and second year of the graduate stream, also known as Transitional (T) year, comprises three blocks of PBL with lectures and tutorials and three blocks of clinical placements in medicine, surgery and general practice. Subsequent clinical years of either course are spent on clinical placements of various specialities, with teaching occurring as lecture weeks prior to each placement block, or teaching which occurs at hospital sites led by clinical staff.

Clinical placements for students on Medical degrees are mainly at St. George&#x27;s Hospital, and at other sites such as Kingston Hospital, Croydon University Hospital, St Helier Hospital and Epsom General Hospital. Other further sites, such as Frimley Park Hospital, St Peter&#x27;s Hospital and Margate Hospital are sites for placements during the later years of medical school.

==Student life==

The St George&#x27;s Students&#x27; Union (SGSU) organises various activities including fancy dress discos and a Rag Week, the annual series of fund-raising events. In recent years the Union has become more politically aware and shown greater interest in National Union of Students and British Medical Association activities.

Each new student at St George&#x27;s is assigned a &#x27;mum&#x27; or &#x27;dad&#x27; in the year above. These &#x27;parents&#x27; act as mentors for the new students, giving them advice about the course, often tutoring them when needed, as well as buying them drinks during Freshers&#x27; Week and beyond. Over the years the family expands to include siblings, uncles, aunts, grandparents etc., spanning all the years of the various courses.

St George&#x27;s enters a team into the British television quiz programme University Challenge each year and has previously excelled through the competition, especially in the field of medicine - unsurprisingly.

=== Academic, cultural and religious societies ===
There are several societies run by students at St George&#x27;s focussed on several different aspects of academia, ranging from the Henry Gray Anatomical Society, St George&#x27;s Surgical Society, Clinical Neuroscience Society, Cardiology Society and Paediatrics Society. Several clubs and societies cater to different segments of the student population, including cultural groups such as the Association of Chinese and British University Students (ABACUS), Afro-Caribbean Society or Arab Society. Religious groups include the Islamic Society and the Christian Union

=== Performance societies ===
Many student groups at St George&#x27;s produce yearly performances, mostly focused on dancing and singing. Some of these groups include the Diwali Show, Fashion Show, Tooting Show, St George&#x27;s Revue, and the Musical Society.

=== Sports clubs ===
St. George&#x27;s Hospital Medical School RFC is one of the oldest rugby clubs in the world having been founded in 1863.

St George&#x27;s also has a number of other sports clubs including Muay Thai, swimming, rowing, cheerleading, volleyball, fencing, football, netball, hockey, and many others and participates in various competitions. As St George&#x27;s is a member of the United Hospitals, the teams also compete in separate competitions with the five other medical schools within the University of London and that of Imperial College.

===Halls of residence===
The university runs a hall of residence, &quot;Horton Halls&quot;, a large modern site which first opened to new students in late September 2007, replacing &quot;St. George&#x27;s Grove&quot; the old hall of residence.

== 1980s student applications controversy ==
In December 1986, it was discovered that a computer program used to process student applications at St. George&#x27;s, written by Dr Geoffrey Franglen in 1979, had discriminated against non-Caucasians and female candidates by deliberately reducing their likelihood of being offered an interview. A Commission for Racial Equality inquiry found that this unfairly deprived 60 candidates a year, as well as finding that various senior academics were aware that the program was discriminatory several times between 1982 and 1986.

<text>The New World leaf-nosed bats (Phyllostomidae) are bats found from southern North America to South America, specifically from the Southwest United States to northern Argentina. They are ecologically the most varied and diverse family within the order Chiroptera. Most species are insectivorous, but the phyllostomid bats include within their number true predatory species and frugivores (subfamily Stenodermatinae and Carolliinae). For example, the spectral bat (&quot;Vampyrum spectrum&quot;), the largest bat in the Americas, eats vertebrate prey, including small, dove-sized birds. Members of this family have evolved to use food groups such as fruit, nectar, pollen, insects, frogs, other bats, and small vertebrates, and in the case of the vampire bats, even blood.

Both the scientific and common names derive from their often large, lance-shaped noses, greatly reduced in some of the nectar- and pollen-feeders. Because these bats echolocate nasally, this &quot;nose-leaf&quot; is thought to serve some role in modifying and directing the echolocation call. Similar nose leaves are found in some other groups of bats, most notably the Old World leaf-nosed bats.

New World leaf-nosed bats are usually brown, grey, or black, although five species are white. They range in size from in head-body length, and can weigh from . Most roost in fairly small groups within caves, animal burrows, or hollow trees, although some species aggregate in colonies of several hundred individuals. They do not hibernate, although some species have been reported to aestivate.

== Evolution ==
The Phyllostomidae, also known as New World leaf-nosed bats, are among the most ecologically diverse mammal families. This variation is measured by diversity in skull morphology and diet-related characteristics: Phyllostomidae consists of species that have evolved physical modifications for insectivory, frugivory, hematophagy, nectarivory, and omnivory. The nose-leaf—a distinctive characteristic of the family—is thought to have evolved to reflect the dietary and foraging behavior of different species of Phyllostomidae. With an evolutionary history tracing back to the Oligocene, fossil and phylogenetic evidence suggests the family originated about 30 million years ago. Leaf nosed bats evolved from Yangochiroptera and Miniopteridae with sister groups also evolving from this group. The Phyllostomidae consists of 61 genera and about 227 species.

== Description ==

New World leaf-nosed bats are bilaterally symmetrical and endothermic mammals characterized by an elaborate outgrowth of skin on their noses, called a nose-leaf, which is believed to aid in echolocation. The nose-leaf can be adorned with a vertical leaf, a concave upward leaf, or multiple accessory leaves; varying by species. Leaf-nosed bats lack a tail, have triangular-shaped ears that can have pointed or rounded tips, range in body size from , and have a wingspan of up to or more.

== Biology and ecology ==
Like other bats, leaf-nosed bats are nocturnal foragers that use echolocation to locate food sources, though the food sources vary between species. Many bats in the family Phyllostomidae appear to have limited reliance on echolocation, likely because frugivorous bats do not need to quickly identify flying insects like many other bats. Instead, species of leaf-nosed fruit bats appear to use scent to identify their preferred food sources.

When they are not foraging, leaf-nosed bats roost in abandoned buildings, caves, and beneath folded leaves depending on the species. Nearly every roosting option present among bats is represented within this family, including species that prefer to roost alone, as well as species that roost with thousands of other individuals every day.

===Diet===
The Phyllostomidae demonstrate the most diverse dietary habits of any family of bats across the globe. Because of this, general dietary patterns are categorized for each species. Leaf-nosed bats generally specialize in a particular type of diet which leads to classification in one of these groups: frugivore, nectarivore, insectivore, omnivore, or haematophagous. However, categorizations are based only on primary consumption habits, therefore observing species that occasionally consume food items outside of their particular classifications is not uncommon. Usually, when leaf-nosed bats consume outside of their primary dietary categorization, it is to ensure sufficient intake of nutrients that their primary food source may not provide. For example, nectar and ripe fruits provide sufficient amounts of carbohydrates and water, but are lacking in protein and fat. To meet basic nutritional requirements, leaf-nosed bats that primarily feed on fruit and nectar must also consume insects to ensure sufficient protein and fat intake and visit salt licks to acquire sodium and other nutrients.

Most leaf-nosed bats are classified as insectivores and feed on a variety of small insects. Certain species with this classification capture their prey either while in flight or from foliage in trees or on the ground. Carnivorous species feed on a variety of animals ranging from frogs to other bats. The Desmodontinae fall into this general carnivorous category, but are further distinguished by feeding exclusively on blood. In contrast, some species in this family feed on exclusively plants, gaining needed nutrients from fruits and leaves. Glossophaginae and Lonchophyllinae are nectar-feeding subfamilies.

=== Life cycle ===
Leaf-nosed bats are gonochoric (separate sexes) that partake in sexual copulation. These bats can live for 20–30 years and females become sexually active at two years of age. Female ovulation occurs from October through September, after the female mates, the gestation period ranges from 8–9 months with an initial 3- to 5-month diapause period when the fetus growth is slowed; this diapause period is controlled by hormones. The female gives birth to a single pup, which has open ears, open eyes, and the first set of deciduous teeth, and is fully furred at birth.

=== Social systems ===
Among species that roost in groups, some evidence exists for a social hierarchy with higher-ranking individuals gaining access to preferred areas of the site. Solitary roosting bats, though, live alone and maintain a strict fidelity to a single roosting site. In some cases, males live alone or with harems, while females prefer to roost with other individuals and their pups. In nearly every species that has been studied, mothers and pups maintain a social bond that lasts beyond nursing. Apparently, young bats can learn food preferences from their mothers and when they are reluctant to leave the nest, mothers literally nudge the infants out of the roost.

== Range ==
New World leaf-nosed bats range from the United States, in southern Arizona and the West Indies to northern Argentina. The family inhabits a diverse array of environments and habitats ranging from forests to deserts.

==Human impact==
Species of New World leaf-nosed bats that make their homes in forested areas are greatly affected by agricultural intensification. Specifically, it has been found that increased agricultural activity by humans causes negative conservation effects on these habitats and as a result reduces abundance and diversity of leaf-nosed bats that live there. California leaf-nosed bats in particular are susceptible to human disruption. This species is known to create large roosts in closed mine shafts due to their potential to provide warmth and isolation. When humans enter the shafts or rework old mines, this disrupts the roosts of the leaf-nosed bats and has the potential to be detrimental to the population as a whole.

<text>The Courtauld Institute of Art (), commonly referred to as The Courtauld, is a self-governing college of the University of London specialising in the study of the history of art and conservation. It is among the most prestigious specialist colleges for the study of the history of art in the world and is known for the disproportionate number of directors of major museums drawn from its small body of alumni.

The art collection is known particularly for its French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings and is housed in the Courtauld Gallery. The Courtauld is based in Somerset House, in the Strand in London. In 2019, the Courtauld&#x27;s teaching and research activities temporarily relocated to Vernon Square, London, while its Somerset House site underwent a major regeneration project.

==History==
The Courtauld was founded in 1932 through the philanthropic efforts of the industrialist and art collector Samuel Courtauld, the diplomat and collector Lord Lee of Fareham, and the art historian Sir Robert Witt.

Originally the Courtauld was based in Home House, a townhouse designed by Robert Adam in Portman Square, Marylebone. The Strand block of Somerset House, designed by William Chambers from 1775 to 1780, has housed the Courtauld since 1989.

The Courtauld has been an independent college of the University of London since 2002.

The Courtauld has featured several times on the BBC&#x27;s arts programme &quot;Fake or Fortune&quot;. In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Institute offered digital &quot;mini festivals&quot; called &quot;Open Courtauld Hour&quot;.

==Academic profile==
The Courtauld Institute of Art is the major centre for the study of the history and conservation of art and architecture in the United Kingdom. It offers undergraduate and postgraduate teaching to around 400 students each year. Degrees are awarded by the University of London.

The Courtauld was ranked first in the United Kingdom for History and History of Art in &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s 2011 University Guide. In the 2014 Research Excellence Framework, it was confirmed in this rank for research quality. &quot;The Independent&quot; has called it &quot;probably the most prestigious specialist college for the study of the history of art in the world&quot;.

The Courtauld was ranked, again, first in the United Kingdom for History and History of Art in &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s 2017 University Guide.

===Research===
According to the 2014 Research Excellence Framework, the Courtauld hosts the highest proportion of the UK&#x27;s world-leading and internationally excellent research among all higher education institutions with 95% of research rated in the top two categories (4*/3*), 56% of which was rated in the 4* category, tied for highest in the UK with London Business School.

===Undergraduate study===
The only undergraduate course offered by the Courtauld is a BA in the History of Art. This is a full-time course designed to introduce students to all aspects of the study of art history.

===Postgraduate study===
Several taught courses are offered at postgraduate level: master&#x27;s degrees in history of art, curating the art museum, the history of Buddhist art, and the conservation of wall paintings are taught alongside diploma courses in the conservation of easel paintings and the history of art. Students in the history of art master&#x27;s programme have to choose a specialisation ranging from antiquity to early modern to global contemporary artwork. Special options are taught in small class sizes of 5–10 students.
===Study resources===
The Courtauld has two photographic libraries which originated as the private collections of two benefactors: the Conway Library, covering architecture, architectural drawings, sculpture and illuminated manuscripts, named after Lord Conway of Allington, and the Witt Library, after Sir Robert Witt, covering paintings, drawings and engravings, and containing over two million reproductions of works by over 70,000 artists. In 2009, it was decided that the Witt Library would not continue to add new material to the collection, and in 2017 a mass digitisation project which will make both Witt and Conway items available online commenced as part of Courtauld Connects.

The book library is one of the UK&#x27;s largest holdings of art history books, periodicals and exhibition catalogues. There is a slide library which also covers films, and an IT suite.

An online image collection provides access to more than 40,000 images, including paintings and drawings from the Courtauld Gallery, and over 35,000 photographs of architecture and sculpture from the Conway Library. Two other websites sell high-resolution digital files to scholars, publishers and broadcasters, and photographic prints to a wide public audience.

The Courtauld uses a virtual learning environment to deliver course material to its students. Since 2004, the Courtauld has published an annual research journal, &quot;Immediations&quot;, edited by current members of the research student body. Each cover of the journal has been commissioned by a leading contemporary artist. Additionally, together with the Warburg Institute, the institute publishes &quot;The Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes&quot;, an annual publication of about 300 pages ().

==The Courtauld Gallery==
The Courtauld&#x27;s art collection is housed in the Courtauld Gallery. The collection was begun by the institute&#x27;s founder, Samuel Courtauld, who presented an extensive collection of mainly Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings in 1932. It was enhanced by further gifts in the 1930s and a bequest in 1948, and has since received many significant donations and bequests. The gallery contains some 530 paintings and over 26,000 drawings and prints. Since 1989, the gallery been housed in the Strand block of Somerset House, which was the first home of the Royal Academy, founded in 1768. In April 2013, the Head of the Courtauld Gallery was Ernst Vegelin.

== Notable people associated with the Courtauld==
The Courtauld is well known for its many graduates who have become directors of art museums around the world. These include the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the National Gallery, London; the National Portrait Gallery, London; the British Museum, London; the Tate, London; the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, San Francisco; the National Gallery of Art, Washington; and the Museo del Prado, Madrid. The number of notable alumni in the fine arts has earned graduates the &quot;Courtauld Mafia&quot; nickname.

<doc id="533446" wikidata="Q5448189" url="?curid=533446" title="1982 Fijian general election">
<text>General elections were held in Fiji between 10 and 17 July 1982. The paradoxical results were both a triumph and a setback for the Alliance Party of the Prime Minister, Kamisese Mara. The Alliance received 52% of the popular vote, only slightly down on its previous total, but won only 28 seats, eight fewer than in the previous elections of September 1977. Part of the reason for this discrepancy was that the slight surge in support for Mara&#x27;s Alliance in the Indo-Fijian community, from 14 percent to 16 percent, was not sufficient to translate into seats in Fiji&#x27;s communal electoral system, and did not therefore off-set losses among the ethnic Fijian community, particularly in the west of the country. The Western United Front of Osea Gavidi won only two seats, but split the vote, allowing the National Federation Party (NFP), with which it tactically allied itself, to gain seven seats for a total of 22. The NFP, which had split into two factions before the previous elections, had been reunited.

==Campaign==
A total of 137 candidates contested the 52 seats in the House of Representatives. One candidate – Subramani Basawaiya of the National Federation Party – was elected unopposed in the Savusavu–Macuatu East Indo-Fijian communal constituency, after his sole opponent, Alliance Party candidate Shiu Prasad, withdrew from the contest shortly before the elections. The Alliance claimed the withdrawal was tactical, as it would mean Indo-Fijian voters would be less likely to come out to vote, giving the Alliance an advantage in the national constituencies.

The Fijian Nationalist Party campaigned on a &#x27;Fiji for the Fijians&#x27; platform, with their manifesto including policies of reserving 46 of the 52 seats in the House of Representatives for Fijians and returning all freehold and crown lands to the Fijian community.

The Fijian-dominated Western United Front, established in July 1981 and led by Osea Gavidi, formed an electoral pact with the Indo-Fijian dominated National Federation Party, resulting in the NFP standing down in six Fijian national constituencies to allow the WUF to run.

==Results==
The Alliance received 86% of the vote in the Fijian communal constituencies, with the WUF on 7% and the NFP just 0.8%. In Indo-Fijian communal constituencies the NFP received 84% of the vote and the Alliance 15%.

Three deputy ministers lost their seats; Bill Clark, Ishwari Prasad Bajpai and Sakiasi Waqnivavalagi.

==Aftermath==
Following the elections, Mara formed a fifteen-member cabinet.

<doc id="533453" wikidata="Q1414254" url="?curid=533453" title="Pedal point">
<text>In music, a pedal point (also pedal note, organ point, pedal tone, or pedal) is a sustained tone, typically in the bass, during which at least one foreign (i.e. dissonant) harmony is sounded in the other parts. A pedal point sometimes functions as a &quot;non-chord tone&quot;, placing it in the categories alongside suspensions, retardations, and passing tones. However, the pedal point is unique among non-chord tones, &quot;in that it begins on a consonance, sustains (or repeats) through another chord as a dissonance until the harmony&quot;, not the non-chord tone, &quot;resolves back to a consonance&quot;.

Pedal points &quot;have a strong tonal effect, &#x27;pulling&#x27; the harmony back to its root&quot;. Pedal points can also build drama or intensity and expectation. When a pedal point occurs in a voice other than the bass, it is usually referred to as an inverted pedal point (see inversion). Pedal points are usually on either the tonic or the dominant (fifth note of the scale) tones. The pedal tone is considered a chord tone in the original harmony, then a nonchord tone during the intervening dissonant harmonies, and then a chord tone again when the harmony resolves. A dissonant pedal point may go against all harmonies present during its duration, being almost more like an added tone than a nonchord tone, or pedal points may serve as atonal pitch centers.

The term comes from the organ for its ability to sustain a note indefinitely and the tendency for such notes to be played on an organ&#x27;s pedal keyboard. The pedal keyboard on an organ is played by the feet; as such, the organist can hold down a pedal point for lengthy periods while both hands perform higher-register music on the manual keyboards.

==Types==
A double pedal is two pedal tones played simultaneously.
An inverted pedal is a pedal that is not in the bass (and often is the highest part.) Mozart included numerous inverted pedals in his works, particularly in the solo parts of his concertos. An internal pedal is a pedal that is similar to the inverted pedal, except that it is played in the middle register between the bass and the upper voices.

A drone differs from a pedal point in degree or quality. A pedal point may be a nonchord tone and thus required to resolve, unlike a drone, or a pedal point may simply be a shorter drone, a drone being a longer pedal point.

==Use in classical music==

There are numerous examples of pedal points in classical music. Pedal points often appear in early baroque music &quot;alla battaglia&quot;, notably prolonged in Heinrich Schütz&#x27;s &quot;Es steh Gott auf&quot; (SWV 356) and Claudio Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;Altri canti di Marte&quot;.

In Henry Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Fantasia upon One Note&quot; for a consort of viols, a tenor viol sustains a C throughout, while the other viols weave increasingly elaborate counter-melodies around it:

Pedal points are often found near the end of fugues &quot;... to reestablish the tonality of the composition after it has become clouded by the numerous modulations and digressions along the way within the middle entries of the subject and answer and in the connecting episodes&quot;. Fugues often conclude with figures written over a bass pedal point:
Pedal points are also used in other polyphonic compositions to strengthen a final cadence, signal important structural points in the composition, and for their dramatic effect.


Pedal points are somewhat problematic on the harpsichord, which has only a limited sustain capability. Often the pedal note is simply repeated at intervals. A pedal tone can also be realized with a trill; this is particularly common with inverted pedals. Another method of producing a pedal point on the harpsichord is to repeat the pedal point note (or its octave) on every beat. The rarely seen pedal harpsichord, a harpsichord with a pedal keyboard, makes it easier to perform repeated bass notes on the harpsichord, since both hands are still free to play on the upper manual keyboards.

With the development of the piano, composers began exploring the potential of a pedal-point in creating mood and atmosphere. An example is the inverted pedal that pervades the right hand part of the piano accompaniment in Schubert&#x27;s song &quot;Erlkönig&quot;:

According to Eugene Narmour (1987, p. 101) &quot;There is no instrument on which a pedal point sounds better than the piano (with its ready-made damper mechanism), and, safe to say, no composer more fond of harmonic pedals than Chopin.&quot; An example is the Prelude in D, Op. 28, No. 15, (the &quot;Raindrop Prelude&quot;) which, like the Purcell, features one repeated note throughout. The piece is in ternary form, with its serene outer &quot;A&quot; sections contrasting the brooding middle &quot;B&quot; section:

In this prelude, the repeated bass A that pervades the outer section becomes, through an enharmonic change, a G in the minor key middle section, where it moves from the bass to the top part. There are other examples of piano music where a single note pervades almost the entire piece: a persistent B features in both Debussy&#x27;s piano prelude &quot;Voiles&quot; and &quot;Le Gibet&quot; from Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Gaspard de la Nuit&quot;.

The term &quot;pedal point&quot; is also used to describe a bass note that is held for a long period in orchestral music, as in the symphonies of Jean Sibelius. Pedal points for orchestral music are often performed by the double basses with the bow, which creates a sustained, organ-like bass tone underneath the changing harmonies in the upper voices. The closing section of the third movement of Johannes Brahms&#x27;s &quot;Ein Deutsches Requiem&quot;, &quot;Herr, lehre doch mich&quot; (bars 173–208), features a sustained timpani roll on D natural for over two minutes until resolving in the final chord:
Ernest Newman (1947, p. iii) wrote of the &quot;mixed reception&quot; given to the &quot;Requiem&quot;, particularly this movement, which &quot;was greeted with many expressions of disapproval; the continual pedal point—intensified by the too vigorous work of the drummer&quot;.

==Use in opera==

The openings of the first two operas of Wagner&#x27;s cycle &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; (&quot;The Ring of the Nibelung&quot;) feature pedal notes. The prelude to &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; features an E pedal tone in the bass for 162 bars:

Robert Donington (1963, p. 35) says: &quot;The Ring opens quietly, but with an effect which in the context of harmonized music is apparently unique. For a very long passage there is not only no modulation but no change of chord. A chord of E major builds up: first the tonic sounds in the abysmal depths; next a fifth is added; then an arpeggio movement on the complete triad, calm but swelling, an embryonic motive ... But still the chord does not change ... A sense of timelessness sets in.&quot;

By contrast, the stormy prelude to &quot;Die Walküre&quot; features an inverted pedal: the sustained tremolos in the upper strings offset the melodic and rhythmic activity in the &#x27;cellos and basses:

Alban Berg’s expressionist opera &quot;Wozzeck&quot; makes subtle use of a pedal tone in Act 3, scene 2, when the jealous, put-upon soldier Wozzeck murders his unfaithful wife, Marie. Douglas Jarman (1989, p38) describes the powerful dramatic effect of this episode: &quot;Marie and Wozzeck are walking through the wood. Anxious, Marie tries to hurry on but Wozzeck detains her. A disjointed, sinister conversation follows until, as the moon rises, blood-red, Wozzeck draws a knife. A long crescendo begins as the note B natural, which has been present as a subdued pedal point throughout the scene, is now taken up by the kettledrums. Wozzeck plunges the knife into Marie’s throat.&quot;

==Use in jazz and popular music==
Examples of jazz tunes which include pedal points include Duke Ellington&#x27;s &quot;Satin Doll&quot;&quot; (intro), Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Too High&quot; (intro), Miles Davis&#x27;s &quot;On Green Dolphin Street&quot;, Bill Evans&#x27;s &quot;34 Skidoo&quot;, Herbie Hancock&#x27;s &quot;Dolphin Dance&quot; from his &quot;Maiden Voyage&quot; album, Pat Metheny&#x27;s &quot;Lakes&quot; and &quot;Half Life of Absolution&quot;, and John Coltrane&#x27;s &quot;Naima&quot;. The latter, from the album &quot;Giant Steps&quot;, has the notation &quot;E pedal&quot; to instruct the bass player to play a sustained pedal. Jazz musicians also use pedal points to add tension to the bridge or solo sections of a tune. In an ii-V-I progression, some jazz musicians play a V pedal note under all three chords, or under the first two chords.

Rock guitarists have used pedal points in their solos. The progressive rock band Genesis often used a &quot;pedal-point groove&quot;, in which the &quot;bass remains static on the tonic as chords move above the bass at varying speeds&quot;, with the Genesis songs &quot;Cinema Show&quot; and &quot;Apocalypse in 9/8&quot; being examples of this. &quot;By the late 1970s and early 1980s, pedal-point grooves such as this had become a well-worn cliché of progressive rock as they had of funk (James Brown’s &quot;Sex Machine&quot;), and were already making frequent appearances in more commercial styles such as stadium rock (Van Halen’s &#x27;Jump&#x27;) and synth-pop (Frankie Goes to Hollywood’s &#x27;Relax&#x27;).&quot;

Film composers use pedal points to add tension to thrillers and horror films. In the Hitchcock thriller film &quot;North by Northwest&quot;, Bernard Herrmann &quot;uses the pedal point and ostinato as techniques to achieve tension&quot;, resulting in a dissonant, dramatic effect. In one scene, &quot;The Phone Booth&quot;, Herrmann &quot;uses the timpani playing a low pedal B-flat to create a sense of impending doom&quot;, as one character is arranging for another character&#x27;s murder. Other notable examples from similar genres are the music for the opening title of the TV series &quot;Sherlock&quot; by David Arnold and Michael Price, and one of the main themes of Interstellar by Hans Zimmer: &quot;[...] to sustain a dominant pedal at length as this theme does gives an impression of a prolonged avoidance of resolution. Indeed, given the enormous length of time that elapses during Cooper’s absence, this is an entirely appropriate sentiment.&quot;.

In small combo jazz or jazz fusion groups, the double bass player or Hammond organist may also introduce a pedal point (usually on the tonic or the dominant) in a tune that does not explicitly request a pedal point, to add tension and interest. Thrash metal in particular makes abundant use a muted low E string (or lower, if other tunings are used) as a pedal point.

Other examples include The Supremes&#x27; &quot;You Keep Me Hangin&#x27; On&quot; (chorus: octave E&#x27;s against A, G, and F major chords) and John Denver&#x27;s &quot;The Eagle And The Hawk&quot; (intro: top two guitar strings, B &amp; E, against B, A, G, F, and E major chords). Also, Tom Petty&#x27;s &quot;Free Falling&quot; and Goo Goo Dolls&#x27; &quot;Name&quot;.

The term derives from a Middle English borrowing of the Old French &quot;panier&quot;, meaning &#x27;bread basket&#x27;.

==Animal panniers==
Traditional panniers for animal transport are typically made of canvas, leather, or wicker. Modern panniers may be rectangular boxes of hard-sided plastic. Panniers are loaded in such a manner as to distribute weight evenly on either side of the animal. For horse packing, and when carrying particularly heavy loads on other animals they are supported by a pack saddle to distribute weight more evenly across the back of the animal. In some cases, additional items are placed on the back of the animal, between the panniers.

==Bicycle panniers==

There are many styles of bicycle panniers. Touring panniers are usually sold in pairs, intended to hold enough equipment for self-sustained tours over days or weeks. The most common setup is to use a pair of smaller panniers (10 to 15 liters each) mounted on a low rider and a pair of larger ones on the rear carrier (20 to 30 liters each).

Commuters who bicycle have pannier options designed to hold laptop computers, files and folders, changes of clothes or shoes and lunches. There are also panniers that convert to backpacks or shoulder bags for easier carrying when not on a bicycle.

Panniers designed specifically for bicycles were patented by John B. Wood of Camden, New Jersey, in 1884. Hartley Alley designed a handlebar bag and other bicycle luggage that he manufactured and sold under the &quot;Touring Cyclist&quot; brand in the 1970s until his retirement in 1984.

===Construction===
Bicycle panniers are usually made of nylon or other synthetic fabric that can be stitched, or, in the case of waterproof panniers, welded together.

As bicycles are often ridden in the rain, many panniers are built to be water-repellent or waterproof by themselves. Others include built-in rain-covers, or rain-covers are offered as accessories. The shape of the pannier may be enforced by a frame or stiffening panel made of plastic or metal to help keep it in place and prevent it from contacting a wheel.

Panniers are usually built to attach to a rear rack or front rack already fitted to the bicycle. Removable panniers hook onto the top edge of the rack and are often held in place by a latch or elastic mechanism.

==Motorcycle panniers==

Motorcycle panniers are generally hard box containers with lids, made of metal or hard plastic. The panniers may be permanently fixed to the motorcycle or may be removable. Soft cases may be leather or fabric, usually without permanent mountings, and are often called &quot;saddlebags&quot; or &#x27;throwovers&#x27;.

<text>USS &quot;Grayling&quot; (SSN-646), a attack submarine, was the fifth ship of the United States Navy to be named for the grayling. Her keel was laid down in 1964, and she was launched just over three years later, and commissioned in 1969. She was involved in the submarine incident off Kola Peninsula on 20 March 1993, when she collided with the Russian Navy submarine . She was decommissioned in 1997, and disposed of a year later.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Grayling&quot; was awarded on 5 September 1962 and her keel was laid down at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard at Kittery, Maine, on 12 May 1964. She was launched on 22 June 1967, sponsored by Miss Lori Brinker, the daughter of Lieutenant Commander Robert Brinker, who was commanding officer of the previous when she was lost with all hands in September 1943 during World War II. &quot;Grayling&quot; (SSN-646) was commissioned on 11 October 1969.

==Service history==

===Collision with Russian submarine, 1993===

On 20 March 1993, &quot;Grayling&quot; collided with the Russian Navy submarine , a &quot;Delfin&quot;-class (NATO reporting name Delta IV-class) ballistic missile submarine north of Murmansk. &quot;Grayling&quot; had been tracking the Russian unit when the collision happened. The American submarine collided with the starboard bow of &quot;Novomoskovsk&quot;; neither submarine sustained serious damage.

===1993–1997===
In June 1996, &quot;Grayling&quot; took part in Exercise TAPON 96, a North Atlantic Treaty Organization exercise held in the Alboran Sea, Gulf of Cadiz, and eastern Atlantic Ocean, along with the U.S. Navy destroyer , the , the Spanish frigates , , and , the Spanish submarine , and the .

<doc id="533467" wikidata="Q738330" url="?curid=533467" title="Shoaib Akhtar">
<text>Shoaib Akhtar (; born 13 August 1975) is a Pakistani former international cricketer and commentator. Nicknamed the &quot;Rawalpindi Express&quot;, he is the fastest bowler in cricketing history, with an unbeaten 161.3 kmph (100.23 mph) delivery. Akhtar made his Test match debut in November 1997 as an opening fast bowler and played his first One Day International three months later. Post-retirement, he began a YouTube career by starting his own channel, where he gives reviews on International and league matches and Pakistani cricket.

==Early and personal life==
Akhtar was born into a Punjabi family, with his paternal side belonging to the Gujjar tribe and maternal side to the Awan tribe, in the small town of Morgah in Rawalpindi, Punjab.

His father, Mohammad Akhtar, whom Shoaib describes as very religious and “from a hardworking, economically unprivileged family of the Gujjar community”, worked as a night watchman at a petrol station belonging to the Attock oil refinery, and married his mother, Hameeda Awan, when she was a teenager, and they had five children: four sons, Shoaib being the fourth, followed by a daughter, while his name, which in Arabic means both “the one who brings people together” and “the one who separates”, was chosen by his mother.

He married Rubab Khan on 11 November 2014. In November 2016, they welcomed their first child, a son named Mohammad Mikaeel Ali, and in July 2019 they became parents a second time to another baby boy, Mujaddid. In March 2024, they welcomed a baby girl, Nooreh Ali.

==Early career ==
A good student, Akhtar was admitted to the Asghar Mall College, but he disrupted his studies to attend trials for the PIA team&#x27;s Karachi division to be held in Lahore. Lacking the money for a bus ticket, he waited for the bus to start and got onto the roof.

After some struggle, starting his List A career during the 1993/1994 season and his first-class career in 1994/1995, he caught the eye of Majid Khan, then the chief executive of the PCB, and after a good performance for the Pakistan A team&#x27;s tour of England, in 1996, he was rewarded with his maiden Test cap against the West Indies in 1997.

==International career==

Considering his subsequent high profile in cricket, Akhtar&#x27;s Test career started rather modestly. He was first picked to play on his home ground in Rawalpindi during the 2nd Test of the West Indies 1997/98 tour of Pakistan. He was subsequently included in the tour of South Africa during the winter of 1998, where he played in all three Tests. He was notably the spearhead of a depleted Pakistani bowling attack in the Peshawar Test against the visiting Australians later in 1998, where Mark Taylor scored his famous unbeaten 334 in Australia&#x27;s first innings. Subsequently, after 8 Tests and 16 innings, Akhtar had accumulated only 18 wickets.

Akhtar&#x27;s run of impressive performances started in 1999, during a pre-World Cup series against India. It was followed by outstanding bowling performances in Sharjah and later in the 1999 Cricket World Cup. His most significant performance was in India in 1999 when he captured eight wickets in the Asian Test championship match at Calcutta – including the wickets of Indian batsmen Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar when he bowled both batsmen off successive deliveries. It was the first ball he ever bowled to Tendulkar. He was also involved in Tendulkar&#x27;s wicket in the 2nd innings of that same Test, when he was perceived as obstructing him from reaching the crease before he was run out by a long throw from substitute fielder Nadeem Khan, leading to rioting in the stands.

In 2002, he was selected for the Pakistan team against Australia and achieved a small amount of success. However, the team performed poorly during the 2003 Cricket World Cup and after the tournament he was dropped from the Pakistan squad. 
He was selected back into the Pakistan squad as they had no choice in the 2003 Test match series against New Zealand, but struggled in a losing Test series against India in 2004. The series ended with a controversy when he left the field citing an injury leading to suspicions by former Pakistan captain, Inzamam-ul-Haq, about his commitment to the team. As a result, his relationship with Inzamam-ul-Haq and former Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer deteriorated. A medical panel was set up by the Pakistan Cricket Board to investigate the nature of his injury, however Pakistan officials dispelled all suspicions.

In 2005, Akhtar regained his reputation as a fast bowler for his side. Playing in a three-Test home series against England, he made a series of impressive bowling performances. His effective use of slower deliveries proved to be unplayable by the English batsmen. Akhtar emerged as the highest wicket taker of the series with seventeen wickets. His comeback was also remarkable as prior to his return, he had been criticized from all corners; such as by the Worcestershire chairman John Elliot for his celebrity attitude and lack of commitment to the team. His performance was also acknowledged by the English captain Michael Vaughan, who remarked &quot;I thought he (Shoaib) was a big difference between the two teams&quot;.

Throughout his career, he was regarded as one of the fastest bowlers in the history of international cricket. He achieved the record of the fastest recorded bowl to date at 161.3 km/h since 1998 when the bowling speed guns were introduced to international cricket with the new speed measuring method. He is also known as one of only three bowlers to have ever broken the 100 mph barrier in cricket history, with a delivery of 100.2 mph, during a one-day international against England at the 2003 World Cup.

===Struggle for form and consistent injuries (2007–2009)===
On 29 October 2007, Akhtar made his return to cricket after his 13-match ban and performed very well, taking 4 wickets for 43 runs against South Africa in the fifth and deciding match of the One Day International series in Lahore in Pakistan. Subsequently, he was included in the 16-man Pakistan squad for the 2007 tour of India.

===Rehabilitation and final years (2010–2011)===
Akhtar made a return to international cricket albeit in the shorter format of the game. In May 2010, PCB named him in a list of 35 probable&#x27;s for the Asia Cup. On 15 June 2010, Akhtar made his return, taking 3 wickets for 28 runs in the first match of the Asia Cup against Sri Lanka. He narrowly missed out a spot in the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 in place of the injured Umar Gul.

In July 2010, he was selected for the Twenty20 series against Australia but the selectors decided not to play him in the Test squad so that he would not get injured. He was subsequently selected for the ODI and Twenty20 series against England in September 2010.

Akhtar returned to the national side representing the country against England in the Twenty20 International. He bowled an impressive spell and returned with figures of 2 wickets for 23 runs. He continued to bowl well in the ODI series in the absence of regular fast-bowlers, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir, who were suspended by the International Cricket Council amid allegations of Spot-fixing. Despite his relatively good bowling form, Pakistani coach Waqar Younis insisted that the bowling attack must not become reliant on Akhtar, as he was 35 years of age and fitness troubles continued to affect him. Akhtar was selected for the tour of New Zealand and started his campaign off well with 3 wickets on Boxing Day in the first of two Twenty20 Internationals against New Zealand.

Akhtar was selected in Pakistan&#x27;s 15-man squad to play in the 2011 World Cup hosted by Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka in February to March. During the tournament, he announced that he would retire from international cricket at the end of the World Cup. He was dropped from the squad after group matches and was not included in the quarter final either.

==Domestic career==

===England county cricket===
Akhtar has played for three English county cricket clubs: Somerset in 2001, Durham in 2003 and 2004 and Worcestershire in 2005. He did achieve his moments of success, such as taking 5 wickets for 35 runs for Durham against Somerset in the National League in 2003 and claiming 6 wickets for 16 runs in the same competition for Worcestershire against Gloucestershire two years later, but he suffered from fitness problems, as well as a perception that he was less than interested in his task. This was particularly the case at Worcestershire: chairman John Elliott said &quot;Players like that are no good to our club. In fact, Akhtar has been no good for any club he&#x27;s been at.&quot;

===Indian Premier League===
Akhtar made a successful return to cricket in 2008 in his first game in the Indian Premier League, playing for the Kolkata Knight Riders against the Delhi Daredevils. Defending a low score of 133 runs, Akhtar took four top order wickets which ultimately led to the Daredevils being restricted to 110 runs. He ended with figures of 4 wickets for 11 runs from three overs, a performance which earned him the player of the match award. Akhtar denied that he had any point to prove with his performance, stating, &quot;I just wanted to win the game.&quot; Knight Riders&#x27; captain Sourav Ganguly also acknowledged Akhtar&#x27;s performance, &quot;He came to the country with lots [of things] happening behind him...But he showed a lot of character.&quot;

==Cricket controversies and injuries==
Akhtar&#x27;s career has been plagued with injuries, controversies and accusations of poor attitude. After Pakistan&#x27;s poor performance in the 2003 Cricket World Cup, he got involved in a verbal conflict with former Pakistan captain and fast bowler Waqar Younis. Later on Akhtar was sacked along with other players, including Younis. In a triangular series in 2003 held in Sri Lanka, he was caught ball tampering making him the second player in cricket to be banned on ball tampering charges. The same year he was banned for one Test match and two One Day International matches for abusing South African spin bowler Paul Adams, during a match against South Africa. In the 2004 home series with India, he struggled with wrist and back injuries, which raised questions about his commitment to the team.

He was sent back from the 2005 Australia tour with a hamstring injury amid rumours of indiscipline, lack of commitment and attitudinal complaints. He was subsequently fined by the Pakistan Cricket Board for avoiding a late night curfew. The rest of his cricketing career was riddled with ankle and knee injuries which forced him to undergo a surgery in February 2006, until finally he was banned for two years for allegedly using performance-enhancing drugs.

===Drug scandal===
On 16 October 2006, Akhtar was suspended by the Pakistan Cricket Board, along with Mohammed Asif after they tested positive for a performance-enhancing substance nandrolone. They were consequently pulled out from the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy. Former Pakistan Cricket Board chairman later stated that he had always suspected Akhtar of substance abuse due to his consistent &quot;reservations&quot; to drug tests. Former Pakistan captain Inzamam ul-Haq had also previously complained about Akhtar&#x27;s drug abuse but was not reported to the Pakistan Cricket Board. Akhtar immediately declared his innocence and he declined knowingly taking any performance-enhancing drugs. In a statement issued to the press, he claimed that he could never cheat teammates or opponents. During a hearing with the Pakistan Cricket Board Anti-Doping Committee, he along with Asif maintained taking non-steroidal dietary supplements. He, however, failed to convince the committee of his innocence. In its report submitted to the Pakistan Cricket Board, the Anti-Doping Committee recommended a two-year ban.

On 1 November 2006, the Pakistan Cricket Board handed down a two-year suspension to Akhtar and a one-year suspension to Asif, banning them from professional cricket during the period. Shoaib had subsequently been added to Pakistan Olympic Association list of doping offenders. However, on 5 December 2006 represented by his lawyer Abid Hassan Minto, Akhtar was cleared on appeal.

On 5 December 2006, Akhtar and Asif were acquitted by the tribunal appointed to review their appeals. After a clear hearing from Akhtar&#x27;s lawyer Abid Hassan Minto, the three-man committee, voted two to one in favour of the acquittal. Justice Fakhruddin Ebrahim, committee head, and Haseeb Ahsan, former Test cricketer, were in favour of the acquittal. The third member, Danish Zaheer, differed. &quot;Exceptional circumstances&quot; were cited including discrepancies between the instantaneous offence charges of doping that were laid and the quick delivery of a very harsh verdict. The complete drug testing procedure was concluded to have been technically flawed as it did not follow standard procedures. Other established facts by the committee included that the duo were not aware of the banned drug to be present in their supplements because the Pakistan Cricket Board itself had not informed them of the dangers of contaminated supplements.

Akhtar and Asif, however, did not play in the subsequent Test match series against the West Indies because the Pakistan Cricket Board had recommended that they play domestic games first to recover form and fitness. On 1 March 2007 Akhtar and Asif were ruled out of the Pakistani squad for the 2007 Cricket World Cup by team officials, minutes before the squad was to depart for the West Indies. The team management along with the Pakistan Cricket Board said their injuries were too severe to risk taking them to the Caribbean. Since neither of the two had been declared fit they did not undergo official doping tests.

World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA) challenged Pakistan&#x27;s decision to lift bans on fast bowlers Akhtar and Asif by taking the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland. The ICC supported the WADA appeal adding that it was committed to a dope free game. On 2 July 2007, the Court of Arbitration for Sport dropped the case, ruling it had no jurisdiction to challenge the decision made by PCB.

===Other controversies===
In August 2007, Akhtar was reported to have used foul language against Pakistan Cricket Board protesting the imposing of fine of Rs. 300,000 for indiscipline during the national camp in Karachi. In the week before the inaugural World Twenty20, held in South Africa, Akhtar was rumored to have hit Pakistani teammate Mohammad Asif with a bat after an argument in the dressing room. It started after Akhtar was ridiculed by Asif and Shahid Afridi for comparing himself with Imran Khan. After the initial inquiry, Akhtar was found to be at fault and was subsequently recalled from the Twenty20 World Cup squad and was sent home. He was also banned for 5 matches by the Pakistan Cricket Board. Akhtar later claimed that Afridi was responsible for the fight, saying &quot;He made some ill remarks about my family. And I could not tolerate them.&quot; Afridi however, denied these allegations adding that Asif would have suffered more injuries but for his intervention. Even Asif chipped in saying that Akhtar was lying and that &quot;Shahid Afridi had nothing to do with the fight&quot;, saying that &quot;he has not apologized to me.&quot;

On 1 April 2008, Akhtar was banned for five years for violating the players&#x27; code of conduct. The ban extended to all cricket for and in Pakistan. Despite the ban not preventing him from playing in the Indian Premier League, the IPL governing council decided not to allow Akhtar to play in the tournament until the end of the ban or unless it is lifted. IS Bindra, a member of the council, was quoted as saying, &quot;Even though they [the PCB] have cleared him to play for IPL, we felt that international discipline needs to be respected.&quot; Meanwhile, Akhtar vowed to go to great lengths to fight the ban, &quot;I will appeal, as is my right. If that fails I will go to court, if that fails then I will go to the Supreme Court.&quot; On 3 April, Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Nasim Ashraf served a legal notice on Akhtar, calling on him to retract statements he made to a news channel, alleging the ban was punishment in return for refusing to give the chairman a share of his earnings from the Indian Premier League, Ashraf also sought damages of Rs 100 million (approximately US$1.6 million) for &quot;defaming him personally&quot; and an additional Rs 100 million to the Pakistan Cricket Board for &quot;sullying the name of the Pakistan Cricket Board and the Pakistan Cricket team.&quot; A three-man appellate tribunal announced on 30 April that they had temporarily upheld Akhtar&#x27;s five-year ban, deciding to revisit the appeal hearing in June. Despite Akhtar&#x27;s later retracting his claims and also issuing an unconditional apology for &quot;any grief or embarrassment that may have been caused to the nation, particularly to the Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf&quot;, Ashraf&#x27;s legal counsel filed a Rs 220 million (approx. US$3.37 million) defamation suit against Akhtar in a civil court in Lahore on 2 May. On 4 May, the Pakistan Cricket Board&#x27;s appellate tribunal suspended the five-year ban for one month, until they reconvene on 4 June, allowing Akhtar to take part in the ongoing Indian Premier League. A day later, the Pakistan Cricket Board announced that they will no longer pursue the defamation suit following a reconciliation between Akhtar and chairman Nasim Ashraf at the house of Rehman Malik, a key political official, in Islamabad. &quot;My honour has been vindicated and now the defamation lawsuit will not be pursued,&quot; Ashraf was quoted as saying.

On 4 September 2008, Akhtar was sent back home from Heathrow airport by British immigration officials on visa grounds; Akhtar only had a visit visa but not a working visa, which is required to play in county cricket. He subsequently obtained the necessary visa and returned to play with English county club Surrey.

On 21 May 2009, Akhtar was dropped from 2009 ICC World Twenty20 Pakistan squad because of genital viral warts. 

During an interview in June 2009 former Pakistan cricket team head coach Geoff Lawson remarked that Shoaib was totally unprofessional as a cricketer, despite his rare natural talent a player with his attitude wouldn&#x27;t even be picked by a club team in Australia.

In July 2012, Akhtar accused the PCB stating that there was too much &quot;politics&quot; in the Board and some of its officials did not want Pakistani team to win.

In February 2023, he was criticized for saying that Babar Azam was not a &quot;brand&quot; because he &quot;lacks character&quot; and was unable to speak good English, extending this criticism to other players as well.

==Beyond cricket==
===Book===
In September 2011, few months after his retirement from international cricket, he released his autobiography &quot;Controversially Yours&quot;, co-written with Indian social anthropologist and journalist Anshu Dogra.

It was met with positive reviews, observers noting the interest of having Shoaib&#x27;s comments, nearly always critical, on issues pertaining to the administration of cricket in Pakistan, the controversies surrounding ball tampering and his views on cricketers, from Pakistan as well outside.

===Hosting===
In May 2017, at the beginning of Ramadan, he co-hosted the game show &quot;Geo Khelo Pakistan&quot; with Wasim Akram. The show ended in October 2017.

In February 2023, he launched his own &quot;The Shoaib Akhtar Show&quot; on the OTT platform UrduFlix.

===YouTube===
He owns a YouTube channel, in which he shares his opinions, interacts with his fans and talk with some of the current and past sports celebrities. The channel has been met with a positive response from the audience and as of August 2023 it has gained around 3.73 million subscribers.

<doc id="533476" wikidata="Q3915270" url="?curid=533476" title="1987 Fijian general election">
<text>General elections were held in Fiji between 4 and 11 April 1987. They marked the first electoral transition of power in Fijian history. Despite receiving just under 50% of the vote, the Alliance Party of longtime prime minister, Kamisese Mara was defeated by a coalition of the Fiji Labour Party (contesting a general election for the first time) and National Federation Party, which won 28 seats to the Alliance&#x27;s 24. The Labour Party&#x27;s Timoci Bavadra became prime minister.

Bavadra&#x27;s 28-member parliamentary caucus included only seven ethnic Fijians, all of them elected with predominantly Indo-Fijian support from national constituencies. His fourteen-member cabinet included six Fijians, seven Indo-Fijians and one European. Effective Indo-Fijian control of the government caused widespread resentment among the ethnic Fijian community, and after less than a month in office, the new government was deposed on 14 May in a coup d&#x27;état led by Lieutenant-Colonel Sitiveni Rabuka.

==Electoral system==
The 52 members of the House of Representatives were elected from two types of constituency, with candidature in each limited to one of three ethnic groups; Fijians, Indo-Fijians and General electors, generally of European or Chinese descent.

Twenty-seven members were elected from communal constituencies (12 Fijians, 12 Indo-Fijians and 3 general) in which voters voted for someone of their own ethnicity, with the remaining twenty-five elected from national constituencies (10 Fijian, 10 Indo-Fijian and 5 general) in which candidature was limited by ethnicity but all registered voters in a constituency could vote for.

==Results==
==Aftermath==
Following the elections Bavadra formed a fourteen-member cabinet.

<text>Preferred stock (also called preferred shares, preference shares, or simply preferreds) is a component of share capital that may have any combination of features not possessed by common stock, including properties of both an equity and a debt instrument, and is generally considered a hybrid instrument. Preferred stocks are senior (i.e., higher ranking) to common stock but subordinate to bonds in terms of claim (or rights to their share of the assets of the company, given that such assets are payable to the returnee stock bond) and may have priority over common stock (ordinary shares) in the payment of dividends and upon liquidation. Terms of the preferred stock are described in the issuing company&#x27;s articles of association or articles of incorporation.

Like bonds, preferred stocks are rated by major credit rating agencies. Their ratings are generally lower than those of bonds, because preferred dividends do not carry the same guarantees as interest payments from bonds, and because preferred-stock holders&#x27; claims are junior to those of all creditors.

Preferred equity has characteristics similar to preferred stock, but the term is typically used for investments in real estate or other private investments where the common stock is not publicly traded, so private equity has no public credit rating.

==Features==
Features usually associated with preferred stock include:

* Preference in dividends
* Preference in assets, in the event of liquidation
* Convertibility to common stock
* Callability (ability to be redeemed before maturity) at the corporation&#x27;s option (possibly subject to a spens clause)
* Nonvoting
* Higher dividend yields

===Preference in dividends===
In general, preferred stock has &quot;preference&quot; in dividend payments. The preference does not assure the payment of dividends, but the company must pay the stated dividends on preferred stock before or at the same time as any dividends on common stock.
Preferred stock can be &quot;cumulative&quot; or &quot;noncumulative&quot;. A cumulative preferred requires that if a company fails to pay a dividend (or pays less than the stated rate), it must make up for it at a later time in order to ever pay common-stock dividends again. Dividends accumulate with each passed dividend period (which may be quarterly, semi-annually or annually). When a dividend is not paid in time, it has &quot;passed&quot;; all passed dividends on a cumulative stock make up a dividend in arrears. A stock without this feature is known as a noncumulative, or &quot;straight&quot;, preferred stock; any dividends passed are lost if not declared.

===Other features or rights===
* Preferred stock may or may not have a fixed liquidation value (or par value) associated with it. This represents the amount of capital that was contributed to the corporation when the shares were first issued.
* Preferred stock has a claim on liquidation proceeds of a stock corporation equal to its par (or liquidation) value, unless otherwise negotiated. This claim is senior to that of common stock, which has only a residual claim.
* Almost all preferred shares have a negotiated, fixed-dividend amount. The dividend is usually specified as a percentage of the par value or as a fixed amount (for example, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric 6% Series A Preferred). Sometimes, dividends on preferred shares may be negotiated as &quot;floating&quot;; they may change according to a benchmark interest-rate index (such as LIBOR).
* Some preferred shares have special voting rights to approve extraordinary events (such as the issuance of new shares or approval of the acquisition of a company) or to elect directors, but most preferred shares have no voting rights associated with them; some preferred shares gain voting rights when the preferred dividends are in arrears for a substantial time. This is all variable on the rights assigned to the preferred shares at the time of incorporation.

The above list (which includes several customary rights) is not comprehensive; preferred shares (like other legal arrangements) may specify nearly any right conceivable. Preferred shares in the U.S. normally carry a call provision, enabling the issuing corporation to repurchase the share at its (usually limited) discretion.

==Types==
In addition to straight preferred stock, there is diversity in the preferred stock market. Additional types of preferred stock include:

* &quot;Prior preferred stock&quot;—Many companies have different issues of preferred stock outstanding at one time; one issue is usually designated highest-priority. If the company has only enough money to meet the dividend schedule on one of the preferred issues, it makes the payments on the prior preferred. Therefore, prior preferreds have less credit risk than other preferred stocks (but usually offer a lower yield).
* &quot;Preference preferred stock&quot;—Ranked behind a company&#x27;s prior preferred stock (on a seniority basis) are its preference preferred issues. These issues receive preference over all other classes of the company&#x27;s preferred (except for prior preferred). If the company issues more than one issue of preference preferred, the issues are ranked by seniority. One issue is designated first preference, the next-senior issue is the second and so on.
* &quot;Convertible preferred stock&quot;—These are preferred issues that holders can exchange for a predetermined number of the company&#x27;s common-stock shares. This exchange may occur at any time the investor chooses, regardless of the market price of the common stock. It is a one-way deal; one cannot convert the common stock back to preferred stock.
* &quot;Cumulative preferred stock&quot;—If the dividend is not paid, it will accumulate for future payment.
* &quot;Non-cumulative preferred stock&quot;—Dividends for this type of preferred stock will not accumulate if they are unpaid; very common in TRuPS and bank preferred stock, since under BIS rules preferred stock must be non-cumulative if it is to be included in Tier 1 capital.
* &quot;Exchangeable preferred stock&quot;—This type of preferred stock carries an embedded option to be exchanged for some other security.
* &quot;Participating preferred stock&quot;—These preferred issues offer holders the opportunity to receive extra dividends if the company achieves predetermined financial goals. Investors who purchased these stocks receive their regular dividend regardless of company performance (assuming the company does well enough to make its annual dividend payments). If the company achieves predetermined sales, earnings or profitability goals, the investors receive an additional dividend.
* &quot;Perpetual preferred stock&quot;—This type of preferred stock has no fixed date on which invested capital will be returned to the shareholder (although there are redemption privileges held by the corporation); most preferred stock is issued without a redemption date.
* &quot;Putable preferred stock&quot;—These issues have a &quot;put&quot; privilege, whereby the holder may (under certain conditions) force the issuer to redeem shares.
* &quot;Monthly income preferred stock&quot;—A combination of preferred stock and subordinated debt.

==Usage==
Preferred stocks offer a company an alternative form of financing—for example through pension-led funding; in some cases, a company can defer dividends by going into arrears with a little penalty or risk to its credit rating, however, such action could hurt the company meeting the terms of its financing contract. With traditional debt, payments are required; a missed payment would put the company in default.

Occasionally, companies use preferred shares as a means of preventing hostile takeovers, creating preferred shares with a poison pill (or forced-exchange or conversion features) that is exercised upon a change in control. Some corporations contain provisions in their charters authorizing the issuance of preferred stock whose terms and conditions may be determined by the board of directors when issued. These &quot;blank checks&quot; are often used as a takeover defence; they may be assigned very high liquidation value (which must be redeemed in the event of a change of control), or may have great super-voting powers.

When a corporation goes bankrupt, there may be enough money to repay holders of preferred issues known as &quot;senior&quot; but not enough money for &quot;junior&quot; issues. Therefore, when preferred shares are first issued, their governing document may contain protective provisions preventing the issuance of new preferred shares with a senior claim. Individual series of preferred shares may have a senior, pari-passu (equal), or junior relationship with other series issued by the same corporation.

==Users==
Preferred shares are more common in private or pre-public companies, where it is useful to distinguish between the control of and the economic interest in the company. Government regulations and the rules of stock exchanges may either encourage or discourage the issuance of publicly traded preferred shares. In many countries, banks are encouraged to issue preferred stock as a source of Tier 1 capital.

A company may issue several classes of preferred stock. A company raising venture capital or other funding may undergo several rounds of financing, with each round receiving separate rights and having a separate class of preferred stock. Such a company might have &quot;Series A Preferred&quot;, &quot;Series B Preferred&quot;, &quot;Series C Preferred&quot;, and corresponding shares of common stock. Typically, company founders and employees receive common stock, while venture capital investors receive preferred shares, often with a liquidation preference. The preferred shares are typically converted to common shares with the completion of an initial public offering or acquisition. An additional advantage of issuing preferred shares to investors but common shares to employees is the ability to retain a lower 409(a) valuation for common shares and thus a lower strike price for incentive stock options. This allows employees to receive more gains on their stock.

In the United States there are two types of preferred stocks: &quot;straight&quot; preferreds and &quot;convertible&quot; preferreds. Straight preferreds are issued in perpetuity (although some are subject to call by the issuer, under certain conditions) and pay a stipulated dividend rate to the holder. Convertible preferreds—in addition to the foregoing features of a straight preferred—contain a provision by which the holder may convert the preferred into the common stock of the company (or sometimes, into the common stock of an affiliated company) under certain conditions (among which may be the specification of a future date when conversion may begin, a certain number of common shares per preferred share, or a certain price per share for the common stock).

There are income-tax advantages generally available to &quot;corporations&quot; investing in preferred stocks in the United States. See Dividends received deduction.

But for &quot;individuals&quot;, a &quot;straight&quot; preferred stock, a hybrid between a bond and a stock, bears some disadvantages of each type of securities without enjoying the advantages of either. Like a bond, a straight preferred does not participate in future earnings and dividend growth of the company, or growth in the price of the common stock. However, a bond has greater security than the preferred and has a maturity date at which the principal is to be repaid. Like the common, the preferred has less security protection than the bond. However, the potential increase in the market price of the common (and its dividends, paid from future growth of the company) is lacking for the preferred. One advantage of the preferred to its issuer is that the preferred receives better equity credit at rating agencies than straight debt (since it is usually perpetual). Also, certain types of preferred stock qualify as Tier 1 capital; this allows financial institutions to satisfy regulatory requirements without diluting common shareholders. Through preferred stock, financial institutions are able to gain leverage while receiving Tier 1 equity credit.

If an investor paid par ($100) today for a typical straight preferred, such an investment would give a current yield of just over six percent. If, in a few years, 10-year Treasuries were to yield more than 13 percent to maturity (as they did in 1981) these preferreds would yield at least 13 percent; since the rate of dividend is fixed, this would reduce their market price to $46, a 54-percent loss. The difference between straight preferreds and Treasuries (or any investment-grade Federal-agency or corporate bond) is that the bonds would move up to par as their maturity date approaches; however, the straight preferred (having no maturity date) might remain at these $40 levels (or lower) for a long time.

Advantages of straight preferreds may include higher yields and—in the U.S. at least—tax advantages; they yield about 2 percent more than 10-year Treasuries, rank ahead of common stock in case of bankruptcy and dividends are taxable at a maximum rate of 15% rather than at ordinary-income rates (as with bond interest).

==Country-by-country perspectives==

===Canada===
Preferred shares represent a significant portion of Canadian capital markets, with over C$11.2 billion in new preferred shares issued in 2016. Many Canadian issuers are financial organizations that may count capital raised in the preferred-share market as Tier 1 capital (provided that the shares issued are perpetual). Another class of issuer includes split share corporations. Investors in Canadian preferred shares are generally those who wish to hold fixed-income investments in a taxable portfolio. Preferential tax treatment of dividend income (as opposed to interest income) may, in many cases, result in a greater after-tax return than might be achieved with bonds.

Preferred shares are often used by private corporations to achieve Canadian tax objectives. For instance, the use of preferred shares can allow a business to accomplish an estate freeze. By transferring common shares in exchange for fixed-value preferred shares, business owners can allow future gains in the value of the business to accrue to others (such as a discretionary trust).

===Germany===
The rights of holders of preference shares in Germany are usually rather similar to those of ordinary shares, except for some dividend preference and no voting right in many topics of shareholders&#x27; meetings. Preference shares in German stock exchanges are usually indicated with &quot;V&quot;, &quot;VA&quot;, or &quot;Vz&quot; (short for &#x27;)—for example, &quot;BMW Vz&quot;—in contrast to &quot;St&quot;, &quot;StA&quot; (short for &#x27;), or &quot;NA&quot; (short for &quot;&quot;) for standard shares. Preference shares with multiple voting rights (e.g., at RWE or Siemens) have been abolished.

Preferred stock may comprise up to half of total equity. It is convertible into common stock, but its conversion requires approval by a majority vote at the stockholders&#x27; meeting. If the vote passes, German law requires consensus with preferred stockholders to convert their stock (which is usually encouraged by offering a one-time premium to preferred stockholders). The firm&#x27;s intention to do so may arise from its financial policy (i.e. its ranking in a specific index). Industry stock indices usually do not consider preferred stock in determining the daily trading volume of a company&#x27;s stock; for example, they do not qualify the company for a listing due to a low trading volume in common stocks.

===United Kingdom===
Perpetual non-cumulative preference shares may be included as Tier 1 capital. Perpetual cumulative preferred shares are Upper Tier 2 capital. Dated preferred shares (normally having an original maturity of at least five years) may be included in Lower Tier 2 capital.

===United States===
In the United States, the issuance of publicly listed preferred stock is generally limited to financial institutions, REITs and public utilities. Because in the U.S. dividends on preferred stock are not tax-deductible at the corporate level (in contrast to interest expense), the effective cost of capital raised by preferred stock is significantly greater than issuing the equivalent amount of debt at the same interest rate. This has led to the development of TRuPS: debt instruments with the same properties as preferred stock. With the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010, TRuPS will be phased out as a vehicle for raising Tier 1 capital by bank holding companies. Outstanding TRuPS issues will be phased out completely by 2015.

However, with a qualified dividend tax rate of 23.8% (compared to a top ordinary interest marginal tax rate of 40.8%), $1 of dividend income taxed at this rate provides the same after-tax income as approximately $1.30 in interest income. The size of the preferred stock market in the United States has been estimated as $100 billion (), compared to $9.5 trillion for equities and US$4.0 trillion for bonds. The amount of new issuance in the United States was $34.1 billion in 2016.

===Other countries===
* In Nigeria, preferred shares make up a small percentage of a company&#x27;s stock with no voting rights except in cases where they are not paid dividends; owners of preferred shares are entitled to a greater percentage of company profits.
* &quot;Czech Republic&quot;—Preferred stock cannot be more than 50 percent of total equity.
* &quot;France&quot;—By a law enacted in June 2004, France allows the creation of preferred shares.
* &quot;South Africa&quot;—Dividends from preference shares are not taxable as income when held by individuals.
* &quot;Brazil&quot;—In Brazil, up to 50 percent of the capital stock of a company may be composed of preferred stock. The preferred stock will have at least one less right than the common stock (normally voting power), but will have a preference in receiving dividends.
* &quot;Russia&quot;—No more than 25% of capital may be preferred stock. Voting rights are limited, but if dividends are not fully paid, shareholders obtain full voting rights.

<text>Cheesecake is a dessert made with a soft fresh cheese (typically cottage cheese, cream cheese, quark or ricotta), eggs, and sugar. It may have a crust or base made from crushed cookies (or digestive biscuits), graham crackers, pastry, or sometimes sponge cake. Cheesecake may be baked or unbaked, and is usually served cold.

Vanilla, spices, lemon, chocolate, pumpkin, or other flavors may be added to the main cheese layer; Additional flavors and visual appeal may be added by topping the finished dessert with fruit, whipped cream, nuts, cookies, fruit sauce, chocolate syrup, or other ingredients.

== History ==

An ancient form of cheesecake may have been a popular dish in ancient Greece even prior to Romans&#x27; adoption of it with the conquest of Greece. The earliest attested mention of a cheesecake is by the Greek physician Aegimus (5th century BCE), who wrote a book on the art of making cheesecakes (—). The earliest extant cheesecake recipes are found in Cato the Elder&#x27;s , which includes recipes for three cakes for religious uses: , and . Of the three, &quot;placenta cake&quot; is the most like modern cheesecakes: having a crust that is separately prepared and baked.

A more modern version called a &quot;sambocade&quot;, made with elderflower and rose water, is found in &quot;Forme of Cury&quot;, an English cookbook from 1390. On this basis, the English chef Heston Blumenthal argues that cheesecake is an English invention.

The English name &quot;cheesecake&quot; has been used only since the 15th century, and the cheesecake did not evolve into its modern form until somewhere around the 18th century. Europeans began removing yeast and adding beaten eggs to the cheesecake instead. With the overpowering yeast flavor gone, the result tasted more like a dessert treat. The early 19th-century cheesecake recipes in &quot;A New System of Domestic Cookery&quot; by Maria Rundell are made with cheese curd and fresh butter. One version is thickened with blanched almonds, eggs and cream, and the cakes may have included currants, brandy, raisin wine, nutmeg and orange flower water.

Modern commercial American cream cheese was developed in 1872, when William Lawrence, from Chester, New York, was searching for a way to recreate the soft, French cheese Neufchâtel. He discovered a way of making an &quot;unripened cheese&quot; that is heavier and creamier; other dairymen came up with similar creations independently.

Modern cheesecake comes in two different types. Along with the baked cheesecake, some cheesecakes are made with uncooked cream cheese on a crumbled-cookie or graham cracker base. This type of cheesecake was invented in the United States.

== Culinary classification ==
Modern cheesecake is not usually classified as an actual &quot;cake&quot;, despite the name (compare with Boston cream &quot;pie&quot;). Some people classify it as a torte due to the usage of many eggs, which are the sole source of leavening, as a key factor. Others find compelling evidence that it is a custard pie, based on the overall structure, with the separate crust, the soft filling, and the absence of flour. Other sources identify it as a flan, or tart.

Smoked salmon cheesecake is a savoury form, containing smoked salmon. It is most frequently served as an appetizer or a buffet item. A smoked salmon cheesecake was a prize-winning recipe in 1996 in &quot;Better Homes and Gardens&quot;&#x27; Prize Tested Recipe Contest. The recipe called for the use of Swiss cheese along with the more usual (for cheesecakes) ricotta.

== National varieties ==

Cheesecakes can be broadly categorized into two basic types: baked and unbaked. Some do not have a crust or base. Cheesecake comes in a variety of styles based on region:

=== Africa ===

One popular variant of cheesecake in South Africa is made with whipped cream, cream cheese, gelatin for the filling, and a buttered digestive biscuit crust. It is not baked, and is sometimes made with Amarula liqueur. This variant is very similar to British cheesecake. This cheesecake is more common in British South African communities.

=== Asia ===

Japanese cheesecake, or soufflé-style or cotton cheesecake, is made with cream cheese, butter, sugar, and eggs, and has a characteristically wobbly, airy texture, similar to chiffon cake. No-bake cheesecakes are known as &quot;rare cheesecake&quot; (Japanese: レアチーズケーキ).

The most prominent version of cheesecake in the Philippines is ube cheesecake. It is made with a base of crushed graham crackers and an upper layer of cream cheese and &quot;ube halaya&quot; (mashed purple yam with milk, sugar, and butter). It can be prepared baked or simply refrigerated. Like other ube desserts in the Philippines, it is characteristically purple in color.

=== Europe ===

Basque cheesecake, composed of burnt custard and no crust, was created in 1990 by Santiago Rivera of the La Viña restaurant in the Basque Country, Spain. It achieved popularity online in the 2010s, helped by a recipe published by the British food writer Nigella Lawson. The Spanish chef Nieves Barragán Mohacho serves hers with a liquorice sauce, which Lawson included in her recipe. In 2021, Basque cheesecake was widely shared on Instagram and became &quot;ubiquitous&quot; in the UK. In 2023, the British restaurant critic Jay Rayner complained that Basque cheesecake had become overabundant in London.

Crostata di ricotta is a traditional Italian baked cheesecake made with ricotta cheese, chocolate chips and eggs. Many cakes and desserts are filled with ricotta, like cassata Siciliana and pastiera Napoletana.

Swiss &quot;Chäschüechli&quot; (&quot;ramequin&quot; in French-speaking parts of the country) are small cheesecake tartlets, savory rather than sweet.

, with meaning &quot;cheese&quot;, is baked Polish cheesecake dating back to the 17th century. It uses (traditional Polish quark) and is based more on eggs and butter, without cream or sour cream. Variations include (Kraków-style), with a lattice crust on top, (king&#x27;s), made from cocoa crust on the top and bottom of the cheesecake filling, and (Vienna-style), which is crustless.

 (Russian &quot;pulled&quot; cake) is a German baked cheesecake with a coca crust base and edge, with chocolate dough scattered over the cheesecake filling.

=== North America ===

The United States has several different recipes for cheesecake and this usually depends on the region in which the cake is baked, as well as the cultural background of the person baking it.

Chicago-style cheesecake is a baked cream cheese version that is firm on the outside with a soft and creamy texture on the inside. These cheesecakes are often made in a greased cake pan and are relatively fluffy in texture. The crust used with this style of cheesecake is most commonly made from shortbread that is crushed and mixed with sugar and butter. Some frozen cheesecakes are Chicago-style.

New York–style or Jewish-style cheesecake uses a cream cheese base. Gil Marks traces the origin of the New York-style or Jewish cheesecake in Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine to the 1930s, made famous in such establishments as Reuben&#x27;s Restaurant and kosher-style Jewish deli Lindy&#x27;s, opened by German-Jewish immigrant Leo Lindermann in 1921. Earlier cheese pie recipes called for cottage cheese. Cream cheese was invented in 1872 and made its way into American Jewish cuisine by 1929 according to Arnold Reuben, owner of the namesake restaurant, who claims credit for the recipe (as well as the Reuben sandwich) and is said to have won an award at the 1929 World&#x27;s Fair in Barcelona. Junior&#x27;s, established by Harry Rosen in 1950, is another NY Jewish establishment famous for New York-style cheesecake. Jewish baker in Decatur, Illinois Charles W. Lubin created the Sara Lee brand of supermarket cheesecakes and expanded into other cakes such as coffee cake, being sold in 48 states.

<text>The London College of Fashion is a constituent college of the University of the Arts London, a public art university in London, England. The college offers undergraduate and postgraduate study, short courses, study-abroad courses and business training in fashion and related topics. The patron is Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh. The current head of college is Professor Andrew Teverson.

== History ==

The origins of the London College of Fashion are in three early London trade schools for women: the Shoreditch Technical Institute Girls School, founded in 1906; the Barrett Street Trade School, founded in 1915; and the Clapham Trade School, founded in 1927. All were set up by the technical education board of the London County Council to train skilled labour for trades including dressmaking, millinery, embroidery, women&#x27;s tailoring and hairdressing; to these, furriery and men&#x27;s tailoring were later added. Graduates of the schools found work either in the garment factories of the East End, or in the skilled dressmaking and fashion shops of the West End of London.

After the Second World War the minimum school leaving age was 15; junior level courses at the colleges were scrapped. Barrett Street Trade School became Barrett Street Technical College, and the Shoreditch and Clapham schools were merged to form Shoreditch College for the Garment Trades. Both had the status of technical colleges, and began to take male students also. In 1967 the two colleges were merged to form the London College for the Garment Trades. This was renamed London College of Fashion in 1974.

In 1986 the London College of Fashion became part of the London Institute, which was formed by the Inner London Education Authority to bring together seven London art, design, fashion and media schools. The London Institute became a legal entity in 1988, could award taught degrees from 1993, was granted University status in 2003 and was renamed University of the Arts London in 2004.

In August 2000 Cordwainers College, a specialist school for leather-working, shoemaking and saddlery, was merged with the London College of Fashion. It was founded in Bethnal Green in 1887 as the Leather Trade School. The name was changed to Cordwainers Technical College in about 1914, and then to Cordwainers College in 1991.

The college moved to Stratford in east London in 2023.

It is one of six constituent colleges of the University of the Arts London, the others being Camberwell College of Arts, Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design, Chelsea College of Art and Design, London College of Communication and Wimbledon College of Art.

== Campus ==
Until 2023, when it moved to new premises in Stratford, the main building was in John Prince&#x27;s Street, just north of Oxford Circus, with other campuses at 272 High Holborn, 40 Lime Grove in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, and – in east London – 182 Mare Street, 100 Curtain Road and Golden Lane.

The new building, at 105 Carpenters Road in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in Stratford, was purpose-built to designs by Allies and Morrison, which were intended to reflect nineteenth-century mill buildings.

== Alumni ==
Among the alumni of the college are Jimmy Choo, shoe designer, Ioana Ciolacu, fashion designer, and Driss Jettou, former prime minister of Morocco.

<text>City, University of London was a public university from 1966 to 2024 in London, England. It merged with St George&#x27;s, University of London to form City St George&#x27;s, University of London in August 2024. The names &quot;City, University of London&quot; and &quot;St George’s, University of London&quot; will provisionally continue as trading names until March 2025.

Originally founded in 1894 as the Northampton Institute, it officially became a university when The City University was created by royal charter in 1966. The Inns of Court School of Law, which merged with City in 2001, was established in 1852, making it the university&#x27;s oldest constituent part. City joined the federal University of London on 1 September 2016, becoming part of the eighteen colleges and ten research institutes that then made up that university.

City has strong links with the City of London, and the Lord Mayor of London serves as the university&#x27;s rector. The university has its main campus in Central London in the London Borough of Islington, with additional campuses in Islington, the City of London, the West End and East End. It is organised into six schools, within which there are around forty academic departments and centres, including the Department of Journalism, Bayes Business School (formerly Cass Business School), and City Law School which incorporates the Inns of Court School of Law. The annual income of the institution for 2021–22 was £262.1 million, of which £12.9 million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £328.2 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;City Financial Statement 21/22&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

City is a founding member of the WC2 University Network which developed for collaboration between leading universities of the heart of major world cities particularly to address cultural, environmental and political issues of common interest to world cities and their universities. The university is a member of the Association of MBAs, EQUIS and Universities UK. Alumni of City include Mahatma Gandhi, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, members of Parliament of the United Kingdom, governors, politicians and CEOs.

==History==

===Origins===

City traces its origin to the Northampton Institute and the City Law School (established in 1852). The first was named after the Marquess of Northampton who donated the land on which the institute was built, between Northampton Square and St John Street in Islington. The institute was established to provide for the education and welfare of the local population. It was constituted under the City of London Parochial Charities Act (1883), with the objective of &quot;the promotion of the industrial skill, general knowledge, health and well-being of young men and women belonging to the poorer classes&quot;.

Northampton Polytechnic Institute was an institute of technology in Clerkenwell, London, founded in 1894. Its first Principal was Robert Mullineux Walmsley.

Alumni include Colin Cherry, Stuart Davies and Anthony Hunt. Arthur George Cocksedge, a British gymnast who competed in the 1920 Summer Olympics, was a member of the Northampton Polytechnic Institute&#x27;s Gymnastics Club and was Champion of the United Kingdom in 1920. In 1937 Maurice Dennis of the (Northampton Polytechnic ABC) was the 1937 ABA Middleweight Champion. Frederick Handley Page was a lecturer in aeronautics at the institute. The Handley Page Type A, the first powered aircraft designed and built by him, ended up as an instructional airframe at the school. The novelist Eric Ambler studied engineering at the institute.

The six original departments at the institute were Applied Physics and Electrical Engineering; Artistic Crafts; Domestic Economy and Women&#x27;s Trades; Electro-Chemistry; Horology; and Mechanical Engineering and Metal Trades.

===20th century===
A separate technical optics department was established in 1903–04. In 1909, the first students qualified for University of London BSc degrees in engineering as internal students. The Institute had been involved in aeronautics education since that year, and the School of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences celebrated the centenary of aeronautics at City in 2009. The institute was used for the 1908 Olympic Games; boxing took place there.

In 1957, the institute was designated a &quot;College of Advanced Technology&quot;.

The institute&#x27;s involvement in information science began in 1961, with the introduction of a course on &quot;Collecting and Communicating Scientific Knowledge&quot;. City received its royal charter in 1966, becoming &quot;The City University&quot; to reflect the institution&#x27;s close links with the City of London. The Apollo 15 astronauts visited City in 1971, and presented the Vice-Chancellor, Tait, with a piece of heat shield from the Apollo 15 rocket.

In October 1995, it was announced that City University would merge with both the St Bartholomew School of Nursing &amp; Midwifery and the Charterhouse College of Radiography, doubling the number of students in City&#x27;s Institute of Health Sciences to around 2,500.

===21st century===
The university formed a strategic alliance with Queen Mary, University of London, in April 2001. In May 2001, a fire in the college building gutted the fourth-floor offices and roof. In August 2001 City and the Inns of Court School of Law agreed to merge. Following a donation from Sir John Cass&#x27;s Foundation, a multimillion-pound building was built at 106 Bunhill Row for the Business School.
A new £23 million building to house the School of Social Sciences and the Department of Language and Communication Science was opened in 2004. The reconstruction and redevelopment of the university&#x27;s Grade II listed college building (following the fire in 2001) was completed in July 2006.

In 2007 the School of Arts received a £10m building refurbishment. A new students&#x27; union venue opened in October 2008 called &quot;TEN squared&quot;, which provides a hub for students to socialise in during the day and hosts a wide range of evening entertainment including club nights, society events and quiz nights.

In January 2010, premises were shared with the University of East Anglia (UEA) London, following City&#x27;s partnership with INTO University Partnerships. Since then City has resumed its own International Foundation Programme to prepare students for their pre-university year. City was ranked among the top 30 higher education institutions in the UK by the &quot;Times Higher Education Table of Tables&quot;.

In April 2011, it was announced that the current halls of residence and Saddler&#x27;s Sports Centre will be closed and demolished for rebuilding in June 2011. The new student halls and sports facility, now known as CitySport, opened in 2015.

In September 2016 The City University became a member institution of the federal University of London and changed its name to City, University of London.

In 2023, a merger was proposed between City and St George&#x27;s, University of London. On 1 August 2024, City merged with St George&#x27;s, University of London to form City St George&#x27;s, University of London.

<text>The montaña del Príncipe Pío is a hill in the western part of Madrid, Spain.
==Background==
It is named after prince Francisco Pío de Saboya, a member of the Italian Pio di Savoia family, whose mother Juana de Moura owned property there. Later, barracks (&quot;Cuartel de la Montaña&quot;) were constructed there. The Madrilene rebels who fought the Napoleonic invaders were executed there on the morning of 3 May 1808, as painted by Francisco de Goya.

Around the 1960s, the barracks were demolished to make room for the Parque del Oeste. The former location of the barracks is now the site of the Temple of Debod, a Nubian temple given by the Egyptian government to Spain in gratitude for Spanish help in saving antiquities during the building of the Aswan Dam.
