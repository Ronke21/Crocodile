<text>Kite types, kite mooring, and kite applications result in a variety of kite control systems. Contemporary manufacturers, kite athletes, kite pilots, scientists, and engineers are expanding the possibilities.

Kite control systems encompass a range of methods and technologies used for maneuvering and stabilizing kites in various applications. These systems have evolved from simple manual controls, to intricate automated and powered configurations, reflecting the spectrum of kite uses from recreational activities, to scientific research and energy generation. The development and refinement of these control systems have significantly expanded the capabilities and applications of kites, sometimes changing them from traditional leisure objects, into tools for modern-day purposes.

High-altitude kite control systems, especially notable in record-setting flights, incorporate advanced mechanisms such as on-board angle-of-attack adjusters. These systems are designed to manage kite line tension, often limiting it to a safe threshold to prevent breakage or loss of control. These high-altitude kites feature safety and tracking mechanisms like radio beacons for detection over long distances and strobe lights for enhanced visibility. The complexity of these systems shows the significant engineering and design efforts, aimed at maximizing the performance and safety of kites in challenging conditions.

In kite-fighting and recreational use, single-line control systems dominate, with the human operator mastering specific movements to control the kite. These movements include tugs, jerks, releases, and directional shifts, essential for maneuvering the kite in desired patterns or engaging in aerial combat. The evolution of control systems in this area highlights the blend of skill, tradition, and technological innovation in kite flying. Historical control systems, such as those developed by the Wright brothers and George A. Spratt, have played a key role in the broader field of aviation, illustrating the interconnectedness of kite technology with the development of flight.

Modern kite control systems extend into various specialized fields, including medium-length-tethered power kites and high-altitude electricity-generating wind-power kite systems. Power kites, controlled by multiple lines, are used for adjusting braking, and distorting the kite&#x27;s shape for specific functionalities. These kites find applications in sports, renewable energy, and scientific research. The control systems are often complex, involving patented technologies to manage the forces at play. Kite aerial photography and governable gliding parachutes show the versatility of kite control systems, adapting traditional kite flying techniques for purposes like photography, payload delivery, and sport parachuting. There is ongoing innovation in kite control technology, including the exploration of solar sail and plasma kites for space applications.

== Single-line kite control systems ==

=== High-altitude attempt single-line control systems ===
On-board angle-of-attack mechanisms were used in the 2000 altitude record-making flight; the operators&#x27; designed adjuster limited kite line tension to not more than 100 pounds by altering the angle of attack of the kite&#x27;s wing body. The kite&#x27;s line had a control: a line payout meter that did not function in the record-setting flight. However, some special tether line lower end used bungee and pulley arrangements to lower the impact of gusts on the long tether. Control of a kite includes how other aircraft see the kite system; the team placed a radio beacon (using two-meter frequency detectable for 50 miles) on the kite; for sight visibility, strobe lights were hung from the kite&#x27;s nose. Control via use of reels and pulleys become critical when tension is high; the team had to repair and replace parts during the flight session.

=== Auxiliary control ===
Auxiliary devices have been invented and used for controlling single-line kites. Devices on board the kite&#x27;s wing can react to the kite-line&#x27;s tension or to the kite&#x27;s angle of attack with the ambient stream in which the kite is flying. Special reel devices allow kite-line length and tension control. Moving the kite&#x27;s line lower end left or right or windward or anti-windward forms part of the control system of single-line kites. Devices at the kite&#x27;s bridle can be set to alter the relative lengths of sub-bridle lines in order to set the attitude of the kite so that the kite flies at a certain position of the potential positions; this can be done for one setting while the kite is readied for flight; but Kenneth C. Howard invited a device that can be operated on single-line kites during the flight session for variable settings: 
=== Fighter-kite control systems ===
The traditional fighter kiting with single-line control dominates kite fighting while multi-line kite fighting is yet a minor activity. The human operator of the single line aims to master movements (tugs, jerks, releases, directional movements) in order to have the unstable kite temporarily move in one direction or another. The intents of the controls are offensive and defensive; escape from an attack or position for an attack. The building of the kite so that motions by the kite&#x27;s human operator or pilot allow a temporary limited stability takes special care.

== Historical kite control systems ==
;Wing warping
:A quad-line two-handled kite control system to warp the wing shape used by the Wright brothers and other aviation pioneers. The brothers asserted the control system as their own invention, although several contemporaries claimed prior art including European patents issued in 1868 (before the brothers were born), culminating in a series of lawsuits was called the Wright brothers patent war.
:This control system is quite similar to the quad line sport kites used today.
;George A. Spratt triangle control frame
:Triangle control frame for any towed or free-flight kite system.
;Paresev

:A mass-shifting via pulley-routed cables from a control stick while kite pilot hung from the kite from a single tensional point.
;Blue-Hill Observatory
A piano-wire based kite control system.
;Barry Hill Palmer
:Of seven to eight experiments, Barry Hill Palmer found several control systems for his foot-launch hang glider in 1960–1962. He finally came upon what inventor George A. Spratt had already found in aviation and regarding any hang glider: a triangle control frame or A-frame in front of the pilot while the pilot hung from a tether either in a seat or harness for various positions; the mechanical arrangement precluded the later invention of the same. Many others would find the same mechanical arrangement for mass-shifting for Rogallo hang gliders and derivatives; these free-flying manned kites or hang gliders used the wing for the kites from the Fleep or Paresev or derivatives of that branch of stiffened flexible wings.

== Medium-length-tethered power kites ==
Power kites are controlled by two to five lines. The simplest systems provide steering by pulling either end of the kite. More lines can provide different functions. These are:

* adjusting the angle of attack: Pulling on lines attached to the front edge of the kite will reduce the angle of attack and thereby reduce the pull of the kite.
* braking: A line pulling the trailing edge down causes a braking effect that can be used either to make the kite turn quickly if applied to only one side, or to bring the kite down if applied symmetrically.
* distorting the kite: Useful when the kite is lying on the surface of the water. A fifth line is occasionally used to do this and thereby makes relaunching much quicker and easier.

The lines attach to different controllers:

;Rings or wrist loops
:These are commonly found on smaller foils.
;Two-line bars
:These are found on LEIs, target kites, and other recreational, and special-application kite systems. They almost always have a wrist leash attached to one of the lines so that the kite will come down if the bar is released.
;Three-line bars
:These are found on some foils. Lines from the ends of the bar attach to either side of the kite and the third line attaches to the rear edge of the foil. This line passes through the bar and is attached to a wrist leash via a cleat to lock the brake off until the bar is dropped. This bar design was never developed by the major manufacturers due to the complexity of the design; however an advanced model is now commercially available from K-trac.
;Four-line bars
:These are found on LEIs, Bows and some foils. This system provides angle-of-attack adjustment. There is usually a semi-permanent attachment, known as the chicken loop, fastened to the kiter&#x27;s harness via the front lines. Releasing the bar while still attached to the chicken loop causes the kite to assume its minimum angle of attack and therefore minimizes the pull generated. There is usually a safety mechanism so that the kite can be totally depowered by detaching from the chicken loop whilst still hanging on to the kite by a leash attached to one of the lines. There are many variants on this system.
;Five-line bars
:These are essentially a four-line system plus a fifth line attached to either the leading edge or trailing edge of the kite. A trailing edge system causes the kite to travel to the center of the power zone and thus re-launch with a lot of power. A leading edge system is used both as a depower and a relaunch device. It can be used to lower the angle of attack for depowering. For relaunch it can be used to assist rolling the kite into the proper position.
;Handles
:These are commonly found on four-line foils. Each handle is a bar with a line attached at each end and each handle controls either the left or right side of the kite. They are held at the top where the power lines attach. Brake lines attach to the bottom of each bar and go to the rear edge of each side of the kite. These provide a braking function &quot;not&quot; an angle of attack function

== Control of high-altitude electricity-generating wind-power kite systems ==

Human control of high altitude wind power systems is typically accomplished through servo mechanisms, as the tether tensions are too great for direct manual operation.

There are a number of patents in this area:
* Kite control systems by John D. Bellacera
* Several patents by Dominique and Bruno Legaignoux

Other concepts include:
* Pulling the lines using winches
* Rotating the line attachment points around a central pivot.
* Shifting the line attachment points back and forth (or up and down) using linear motors

== Control of kite rigs ==

Kite rigs are systems for propelling a vehicle, such as a boat, buggy, or a vehicle with snow and ice runners. They may be as simple as a person flying a kite while standing on a specialized skateboard, or be complex systems fixed to the vehicle with powered and automated controls. They differ from conventional sails in that they are flown from lines, not supported by masts.

===Commercial transport propulsion ===
Ship-pulling kites run to hundreds of square meters of area and require a special attachment points, a launch and recovery system, and fly-by-wire controls.

The SkySails ship propulsion system consists of a large foil kite, an electronic control system for the kite, and an automatic system to retract the kite.

The kite, while over ten times larger, bears similarities to the arc kites used in kitesurfing. However, the kite is an inflatable rather than a ram-air kite. Additionally, a control pod is used rather than direct tension on multiple kite control lines; only one line runs the full distance from kite to ship, with the bridle lines running from kite to control pod. Power to the pod is provided by cables embedded in the line; the same line also carries commands to the control pod from the ship.

The kite is launched and recovered by an animated mast or arm, which grips the kite by its leading edge. The mast also inflates and deflates the kite. When not in use, mast and deflated kite fold away.

== Target-kites ==
The term &quot;target kite&quot; generally refers to the war-time kites used for shipboard anti-aircraft gunnery practice. These were the invention of Paul E. Garber, doing war work while on leave from the Smithsonian (where he was responsible for the acquisition of much of the Air and Space collection).

The kites were ordinary two-spar Eddy style kites with a height of about five feet. The sail was sky blue with the profile of a Japanese Zero or German aircraft painted in black. Attached at the lower end of the vertical spar is a small rudder, much like a boat&#x27;s rudder. The rudder is controlled by two kite lines, which are also used to fly the kite. The two lines come down to earth and terminate at an either a &quot;flying bar&quot; (a bar with spools at either end) or a special two-spool reel which incorporated a ratchet mechanism to assist in equalizing line length. The spool was in the center of a wooden bar which held the lines a fixed distance apart.

== Indoor ==
A wand or pole with a string on the end is often used to lead indoor kites around.

== Hang-gliders ==

=== Unpowered short-tethered hang-gliders ===
Unlike the long-lined power kites used in extreme kiting sport, the focus in this section is the short-lined framed large kite. The kite line or &quot;hang line&quot; for best controlling the flight of the hang glider kite needs to be carefully lengthened; then the line frequently splits to two, three, or four main tethers that connect to the hung kite operator&#x27;s or pilot&#x27;s harness. Mike Meier, kite glider author, wrote How &quot;To Get The Right Hang Height&quot;. NASA used mass-shifting in the Paresev hung-pilot aircraft with a stiffened-frame kite. The hang tether was also stiffened, differently. In sport hang gliding kite systems using the short hang line, the hang loop or first section of the hanging kite line is a flexible webbing, then the main lines to the harness are cords and sometimes webbing that are flexible. Control of the attitude of the kite&#x27;s wing is achieved frequently by the pilot&#x27;s grabbing the kite&#x27;s stiffened airframe part called the control frame and pushing or pulling the kite&#x27;s airframe left or right or forward and aft in various combinations; this control system is most commonly called &quot;weight-shifting&quot; although mechanically the situation is altering positions of mass to alter the center of gravity of the entire system relative to the aerodynamic center of pressure in order to effect leveraging moments to control the flight.
The place on the kite airframe where the tether is tied is very important as in all kites; such connection or bridling takes into consideration the aerodynamic center of pressure and the system&#x27;s center of gravity. A key article by Mike Meier, &quot;Pitch Stability &amp; Center of Mass&quot; &quot;Location&quot;, focuses on this concern of control.

While flying the kite hang glider, there are times during flight instruction that instructors will have the student fully release from holding the triangle control frame, and simply hang. The hanging (gravity pulls the student&#x27;s body downwards and results in a tensional tugging of the kite&#x27;s wing) student experiences that the properly bridled and trimmed wing will fly stably. The student experiences that the letting go of the control frame will let a properly trim stable flight. However, since gusts occur, the student learns that hands-off flying is not the normal status—rather the kite pilot is almost always handling the control frame.

=== Powered short-tethered hang-gliders ===
Here the unpowered kite is tethered to a pilot who arranges to have a harness to which is attached a thrusting prime moving engine or motor; the total system is a powered aircraft while the kite itself remains unpowered (very differently is when an engine is mounted on a wing). The control system includes the control system of the similar system where the pilot is not thrust by a harnessed prime moving engine or motor; however, in controlling flight, adjustments for center of mass are respected. Further, while the pilot&#x27;s thrust is on, the pilot positions so that the kite&#x27;s kite line is angled so tugging of the wing is accomplished in the familiar kiting manner where the kite line begins upwind and angles upward downwind (relative wind is to be the wind in attention here).

=== Under tow by airplane ===
=== Under static-line tow ===
Here the tug kite line stays the same length during the kiting operation. The ground vehicle driver has special control duties. The kited hang glider person controls the kite in some ways different from other tow methods; careful distinctions are learned in professional instruction. Controlling things when unexpected events occur is a large part of instruction.

=== Under non-static-line tow ===
 The complex control system includes the operator of the winch. The length of line starts long and then gets shorter as the winch reels the tug line; this alters the control decisions by the kited hang glider pilot. Instruction for controls is available for new winch operators and hang glider pilots who want to be so kited. Distinguish this method from static-line (tug line stays same length during the tow). The control system for the shortening-the-tug-line method of kiting is different.

=== Under bungee-line launch===
Bungee launch control systems for kited hang gliders has its own special details. The tug kite line is very elastic; when tensed, the line is long; during use for launch, the kite line shortens. Controlling the kite&#x27;s wing attitudes is up to the pilot who frequently is hung from a short kite line while controlling a triangle control frame or other airframe part or even aerodynamic surface controls. Professional instruction is highly recommended. Inelastic portion of the bungee assembly is used to help guard against what can happen if the bungee breaks and snaps back toward the pilot; a tug-line parachute can be used to lower the speed that the released bungee will fall. Bungee launch is used most frequently for launch off slopes when free-foot-launch is not easy (site structure or pilots who have not the use of their legs), or for flatland short-flight demonstrations.

== Paragliders ==
The non-stiffened Francis Rogallo parawing, the Domina Jalbert founded parafoil wing, or other modified fully flexible wings (Barish sailwing, KiteShip wing, parasails, modified conical parachutes) do not lend themselves to a mounting of a prime moving engine or motor to them; rather the kiting lines to the unpowered wing terminate below the wing to a static or mobile anchoring; that anchoring itself may be with its own active thrusting engine or motor or the anchor (which could be payload, pilot, or both payload and pilot) may simply fall by gravity force—and thus by gravity tug the wing through the kite lines. When the payload or pilot is simply falling without adding a prime moving engine or motor, then the kited flexible wing is a paragliding wing; when the payload or pilot is additionally arranged with a thrust engine or motor, then the kited unpowered flexible wing with such thrust payload or pilot is a powered aircraft system or powered paragliding system. The control systems are varied for particular applications (ranging from lowering military payloads, autonomous powered paragliders or drones, sport paragliding, sport powered paragliding, scale-model paragliding, scale-model powered paragliding). All variations have in common the unpowered kite whether or not the payload and/or pilot is powered.

== Governable gliding parachutes ==
 These free-flight kites are governable parachutes and are used as payload delivery systems, sport gliding parachuting or skydiving, BASE jumping, scale-model parachuting. When used for delivery of sensitive payloads or carrying humans, the fast opening from packed format is damped by use of a slider. The wing remains unpowered and kited by bridle tethering lines; the lines attach to platforms or harnesses. The size and design of the kited wing is customized for the final type of use where packing, opening, and sink rate are important feature. Control systems are specialized for the specific use. Control systems sometimes include radio control from remote locations.

== Kite aerial photography ==

Kites used in kite aerial photography (KAP) are typically controlled using the same reels and spools as non-KAP kite flyers. The best KAP work seems be done at lower altitudes than expected (100–200&#x27;), so no special equipment is required. The most problematic KAP flights are when the best camera shot requires the kite to be flown amongst tall trees or buildings, so quick haul-in can be a plus.

The camera rig itself is attached to the kite line some distance beneath the kite, preferably with a pulley scheme that will permit the camera to float in a level attitude regardless of the kite&#x27;s gyrations. The &quot;Picavet&quot; system is one such scheme.

Further sophistication in kite photography comes with live video and radio control features to control where the camera is pointing. This is superior to the minimal rig which simply clicks the camera every few minutes and must be hauled down to earth to change the direction in which the camera points. The penalty of the radio control rigs is weight, which requires higher winds to do photography. So in addition to clear skies, high winds are also necessary, which will limit opportunities for photography.

== Solar sail and plasma kites ==
Scientists on one type of solar kite take pride that there will be a minimum of moving parts to control the movement of the solar kite through space and around the Earth, Moon, comet, or other Solar System body. A collection of scientists and engineers are expanding the definition of what a kite is; the solar kite described by authors C. Jack and C. Welch has the inertia of the mass of the kite providing resistance against photonic flow. Also, the controlling of the kite to alter the kite&#x27;s acceleration sets up a kiting scenario: causing the kite to deflect away from the pull of gravity to keep it flying on its intended path supports the inclusion of the solar sail as a kite in photonic flow. The kite is fed start data; the kite tracks the stars and operates three elements to control its attitude to effect its deflections to result in the flight path desired by the ground-directing kite operators. The position of the payload is changed to alter the relative positions of the kite&#x27;s center of pressure and center of mass; this is done in part by piezoelectric actuators. Also, the struts that hold the centered payload are differentially heated; such causes one of the struts to become longer than the cooler struts and thereby changing the center of mass relative to the center of pressure of the kite. Further, to cause an attitude change, tiny photo thrusters (heated wire) tweak the attitude of the kite; such thrusters do not propel the kite, but are only used to change the attitude of the kite&#x27;s sail. These mechanisms aim to give authoritative control at minimum power use for giving direction to the kite. Working solar kite groups are considering at least seventeen means of control of the solar kite/solar sail.

<text>The Aeolian mode is a musical mode or, in modern usage, a diatonic scale also called the natural minor scale. On the piano, using only the white keys, it is the scale that starts with A and continues to the next A only striking white keys. 
Its ascending interval form consists of a &quot;key note, whole step, half step, whole step, whole step, half step, whole step, whole step.&quot; That means that, in A aeolian (or A minor), a scale would be played beginning in A, move up a whole step (two piano keys) to B, move up a half step (one piano key) to C, then up a whole step to D, a whole step to E, a half step to F, a whole step to G, and a final whole step to a high A.

== History ==
The word &quot;Aeolian&quot;, like the names for the other ancient Greek &quot;tonoi&quot; and &quot;harmoniai&quot;, is an ethnic designation: in this case, for the inhabitants of Aeolis (), a coastal district of Anatolia. In the music theory of ancient Greece, it was an alternative name (used by some later writers, such as Cleonides) for what Aristoxenus called the Low Lydian &quot;tonos&quot; (in the sense of a particular overall pitching of the musical system—not a scale), nine semitones higher than the lowest &quot;position of the voice&quot;, which was called Hypodorian. In the mid-16th century, this name was given by Heinrich Glarean to his newly defined ninth mode, with the diatonic octave species of the natural notes extending one octave from A to A—corresponding to the modern natural minor scale. Up until this time, chant theory recognized eight musical modes: the relative natural scales in D, E, F and G, each with their authentic and plagal counterparts, and with the option of B instead of B in several modes.

In 1547, Heinrich Petri published Heinrich Glarean&#x27;s &quot;Dodecachordon&quot; in Basel. His premise had as its central idea the existence of twelve diatonic modes rather than eight, including a separate pair of modes each on the finals A and C. Finals on these notes, as well as on B, had been recognized in chant theory at least since Hucbald in the early tenth century, but they were regarded as merely transpositions from the regular finals a fifth lower. In the eleventh century, Guido d&#x27;Arezzo, in chapter 8 of his &quot;Micrologus&quot;, designated these transposed finals A, B, and C as &quot;affinals&quot;, and later still the term &quot;confinal&quot; was used in the same way. In 1525, Pietro Aaron was the first theorist to explain polyphonic modal usage in terms of the eightfold system, including these transpositions. As late as 1581, Illuminato Aiguino da Brescia published the most elaborate theory defending the eightfold system for polyphonic music against Glarean&#x27;s innovations, in which he regarded the traditional plainchant modes 1 and 2 (Dorian and Hypodorian) at the affinal position (that is, with their finals on A instead of D) as a composite of species from two modes, which he described as &quot;mixed modes&quot;. Glarean added &quot;Aeolian&quot; as the name of the &quot;new&quot; ninth mode: the relative natural mode in A with the perfect fifth as its dominant, reciting tone, reciting note, or &quot;tenor&quot;. The tenth mode, the plagal version of the Aeolian mode, Glarean called &quot;Hypoaeolian&quot; (&quot;under Aeolian&quot;), based on the same relative scale, but with the minor third as its tenor, and having a melodic range from a perfect fourth below the tonic to a perfect fifth above it.

Scholars for the past three centuries have regarded the modes added by Glarean as the basis of the minor/major division of classical European music, as homophonic music replaced Renaissance polyphony. Howard S Powers considers this to be an oversimplification, since the key of A minor is as closely related to the old transposed modes 1 and 2 (Dorian and Hypodorian) with finals on A—as well as to mode 3 (Phrygian)—as it is to Glarean&#x27;s Aeolian.

In modern usage, the Aeolian mode is the sixth mode of the major scale and has the following formula:

:1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

The Aeolian mode is the sixth mode of the major scale, that is, it is formed by starting on the sixth degree (submediant) of the major scale. For example, if the Aeolian mode is used in its all-white-note pitch based on A, this would be an A-minor triad, which would be the submediant in the relative major key of C major.

== Aeolian harmony ==

&quot;Aeolian harmony&quot; is harmony or chord progression created from chords of the Aeolian mode. Commonly known as the &quot;natural minor&quot; scale, it allows for the construction of the following triads (three note chords built from major or minor thirds), in popular music symbols: i, III, iv, v, VI, and VII. The scale also produces ii, which is avoided since it is diminished. The leading-tone and major V which contains it are also not used, as they are not part of the Aeolian mode (natural minor scale). However, Aeolian harmony may be used with mode mixture.

For example, VII is a major chord built on the seventh scale degree, indicated by capital Roman numerals for seven.

There are common subsets including i–VII–VI, i–iv–v and blues minor pentatonic derived chord sequences such as I–III–IV, I–IV, VII (The verse of &quot;I&#x27;m Your Man&quot;). All these lack perfect cadences (V–I), and may be thought of as derived from rewrite rules using recursive fourth structures (repeated progression by perfect fourth, see circle progression). Middleton suggests of modal and fourth-oriented structures that, rather than being, &quot;distortions or surface transformations of Schenker&#x27;s favoured V–I kernel, it is more likely that both are branches of a deeper principle, that of tonic/not-tonic differentiation.&quot;

==Songs that use Aeolian mode==
The Aeolian mode is identical with the natural minor scale. Thus, it is ubiquitous in minor-key music. The following is a list of some examples that are distinguishable from ordinary minor tonality, which also uses the melodic minor scale and the harmonic minor scale as required.

*Traditional – &quot;God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen&quot; 
*Bob Dylan – &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot;
*R.E.M. – &quot;Losing My Religion&quot;
* Phil Collins – &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot;
* Alter Bridge – &quot;Blackbird&quot;
*Fleetwood Mac – &quot;Isn&#x27;t It Midnight&quot;
*Pink Floyd – &quot;Shine on you Crazy Diamond&quot;
*Dido – &quot;White Flag&quot;
* Radiohead – &quot;Street Spirit&quot;
* Red Hot Chili Peppers – &quot;Californication&quot;

The Phrygian mode (pronounced ) can refer to three different musical modes: the ancient Greek &quot;tonos&quot; or &quot;harmonia,&quot; sometimes called Phrygian, formed on a particular set of octave species or scales; the medieval Phrygian mode, and the modern conception of the Phrygian mode as a diatonic scale, based on the latter.

== Ancient Greek Phrygian ==
The octave species (scale) underlying the ancient-Greek Phrygian &quot;tonos&quot; (in its diatonic genus) corresponds to the medieval and modern Dorian mode. The terminology is based on the &quot;Elements&quot; by Aristoxenos (fl. ), a disciple of Aristotle. The Phrygian &quot;tonos&quot; or &quot;harmonia&quot; is named after the ancient kingdom of Phrygia in Anatolia.

In Greek music theory, the &quot;harmonia&quot; given this name was based on a &quot;tonos&quot;, in turn based on a scale or octave species built from a tetrachord which, in its diatonic genus, consisted of a series of rising intervals of a whole tone, followed by a semitone, followed by a whole tone.

\relative c&#x27; {
 \clef treble \time 4/4
 e4^\markup { Greek Phrygian tonos (diatonic genus) on E } fis g a b cis d e
&lt;/score&gt;
In the chromatic genus, this is a minor third followed by two semitones.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\key e \major
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; {
 \clef treble \time 4/4
 e4^\markup { Greek Phrygian tonos (chromatic genus) on E } fisis gis a c cisis dis e
&lt;/score&gt;
In the enharmonic genus, it is a major third and two quarter tones.
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\key e \major
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f

\relative c&#x27; {
 \clef treble \time 4/4
 e4^\markup { Greek Phrygian tonos (enharmonic genus) on E } gis gisih a b dis disih e
&lt;/score&gt;

A diatonic-genus octave species built upon D is roughly equivalent to playing all the white notes on a piano keyboard from D to D:
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; {
 \clef treble \time 4/4
 d4 e f g a b c d
&lt;/score&gt;
This scale, combined with a set of characteristic melodic behaviours and associated ethe, constituted the &quot;harmonia&quot; which was given the ethnic name &quot;Phrygian&quot;, after the &quot;unbounded, ecstatic peoples of the wild, mountainous regions of the Anatolian highlands&quot;. This ethnic name was also confusingly applied by theorists such as Cleonides to one of thirteen chromatic transposition levels, regardless of the intervallic makeup of the scale.

Since the Renaissance, music theorists have called this same sequence (on a diatonic scale) the &quot;Dorian&quot; mode, due to a mistake interpreting Greek (it is different from the Greek mode called &quot;Dorian&quot;).

== Medieval Phrygian mode ==
The early Catholic Church developed a system of eight musical modes that medieval music scholars gave names drawn from the ones used to describe the ancient Greek &quot;harmoniai&quot;. The name &quot;Phrygian&quot; was applied to the third of these eight church modes, the authentic mode on E, described as the diatonic octave extending from E to the E an octave higher and divided at B, therefore beginning with a semitone-tone-tone-tone pentachord, followed by a semitone-tone-tone tetrachord:

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; {
 \clef treble \time 5/4
 e4 f g a b
 \time 4/4
 \parenthesize b c d e
&lt;/score&gt;
The ambitus of this mode extended one tone lower, to D. The sixth degree, C, which is the tenor of the corresponding third psalm tone, was regarded by most theorists as the most important note after the final, though the fifteenth-century theorist Johannes Tinctoris implied that the fourth degree, A, could be so regarded instead.

Placing the two tetrachords together, and the single tone at bottom of the scale produces the Hypophrygian mode (below Phrygian):

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&quot; {
 \clef treble \time 1/4
 g4
 \time 4/4
 a b c d \parenthesize d e f g
&lt;/score&gt;

== Modern Phrygian mode ==
In modern western music (from the 18th century onward), the Phrygian mode is related to the modern natural minor scale, also known as the Aeolian mode, but with the second scale degree lowered by a semitone, making it a minor second above the tonic, rather than a major second.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; {
 \clef treble \time 7/4
 e4^\markup { Modern E Phrygian mode } f g a b c d e2
&lt;/score&gt;
The following is the Phrygian mode starting on E, or E Phrygian, with corresponding tonal scale degrees illustrating how the modern major mode and natural minor mode can be altered to produce the Phrygian mode:

Therefore, the Phrygian mode consists of: root, minor second, minor third, perfect fourth, perfect fifth, minor sixth, minor seventh, and octave. Alternatively, it can be written as the pattern

: half, whole, whole, whole, half, whole, whole
In contemporary jazz, the Phrygian mode is used over chords and sonorities built on the mode, such as the sus4(9) chord (see Suspended chord), which is sometimes called a &quot;Phrygian suspended chord&quot;. For example, a soloist might play an E Phrygian over an Esus4(9) chord (E–A–B–D–F).

=== Phrygian dominant scale ===
A Phrygian dominant scale is produced by raising the third scale degree of the mode:

The Phrygian dominant is also known as the Spanish gypsy scale, because it resembles the scales found in flamenco and also the Berber rhythms; it is the fifth mode of the harmonic minor scale. Flamenco music uses the Phrygian scale together with a modified scale from the Arab &quot;maqām Ḥijāzī&quot; (like the Phrygian dominant but with a major sixth scale degree), and a bimodal configuration using both major and minor second and third scale degrees.

==Examples==
===Ancient Greek===
* The First Delphic Hymn, written in 128 BC by the Athenian composer Limenius, is in the Phrygian and Hyperphrygian &quot;tonoi&quot;, with much variation.
* The Seikilos epitaph (1st century AD) is in the Phrygian species (diatonic genus), in the Iastian (or low Phrygian) transposition.

===Medieval and Renaissance===
* Gregorian chant, &quot;Tristes erant apostoli&quot;, version in the &quot;Vesperale Romanum&quot;, originally Ambrosian chant.

<text>Eleonora Giulia Amalia Duse ( , ; 3 October 185821 April 1924), often known simply as Duse, was an Italian actress, rated by many as the greatest of her time. She performed in many countries, notably in the plays of Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio and Henrik Ibsen. Duse achieved a unique power of conviction and verity on the stage through intense absorption in the character, &quot;eliminating the self&quot; as she put it, and letting the qualities emerge from within, not imposed through artifice.

==Life and career==
=== Early life ===
Duse was born in Vigevano, Lombardy, Austrian Empire, in 1858 to Alessandro Vincenzo Duse (1820–1892) and Angelica Cappelletto (1833–1906). Lombardy would be taken from Austrian control the year after her birth by forces under the Kingdom of Sardinia, and would form part of the new Kingdom of Italy when she was about 3. Venice and some surrounding areas would remain part of the Austrian Empire until she was about 8.

Both her father and her grandfather, Luigi, were actors from Chioggia, near Venice, and she joined the troupe at age four. Due to poverty, she initially worked continually, traveling from city to city with whichever troupe her family was currently engaged. She came to fame in Italian versions of roles made famous by Sarah Bernhardt, such as &quot;La Dame aux camélias&quot;.

=== Career ===
She gained her first major success in Europe, then toured South America, Russia and the United States in 1893; beginning the tours as a virtual unknown but leaving in her wake a general recognition of her genius. While she made her career and fame performing in the theatrical &quot;warhorses&quot; of her day, she is remembered for her association with the plays of Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio and Henrik Ibsen.

In 1879, while in Naples, she met journalist Martino Cafiero, and became involved in a love affair with him. However, less than a year later, while she was in mid-pregnancy, he left her. The baby did not survive birth, and shortly thereafter Cafiero died as well. Duse then joined Cesare Rossi&#x27;s theater company, and met actor Tebaldo Checchi (pseudonym of Tebaldo Marchetti). The two married in 1881. By 1882, the couple had one daughter, Enrichetta Angelica, but separated after Duse became involved with another actor, Flavio Andò. 

By this time, her career was in full swing and her popularity was high in 1885. She travelled on tour to South America, and upon her return a year later she formed her own company, meaning that she would assume the additional responsibilities of both manager and director.

Between 1887 and 1894, she had an affair with the Italian poet Arrigo Boito, perhaps best remembered as Verdi&#x27;s librettist. Their relationship was carried out in a highly clandestine manner, presumably because of Boito&#x27;s many aristocratic friends and acquaintances. (Despite this, their voluminous correspondence over the years survives.) In later years the two remained on good terms until his death in 1918.

In 1895 she met Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio (1863–1938), who was five years her junior, and the two became involved romantically as well as collaborating professionally. Gabriele d&#x27;Annunzio wrote four plays for her. In contrast to her relations with Boito, her association with d&#x27;Annunzio was widely recognized. When d&#x27;Annunzio gave the lead for the premiere of the play to Sarah Bernhardt instead of Duse, there was a furious fight, and Duse ended her affair with him.

In contrast to Bernhardt&#x27;s outgoing personality, which thrived on publicity, Duse was introverted and private, rarely giving interviews. She found public appearances to be a distraction, and once remarked to a journalist that away from the stage, &quot;I do not exist&quot;. Bernhardt and Duse were unspoken rivals for many years. Comparisons of Duse to Bernhardt with regard to their acting talent were common, with warring factions arguing over their relative merits. Those who thought Duse the greater artist included George Bernard Shaw, who saw both actresses in London within the span of a few days, in the same play. Shaw gave his nod to Duse and defended his choice in an adamant oratory quoted by biographer Frances Winwar. Dame Ellen Terry, who knew them both, observed, &quot;How futile it is to make comparisons! Better far to thank heaven for both these women.&quot;

In 1896, Duse completed a triumphant tour of the United States; in Washington President Grover Cleveland and his wife attended every performance. Mrs. Cleveland shocked Washington society by giving, in Duse&#x27;s honor, the first-ever White House tea held for an actress. In 1909, Duse retired from acting.

=== Other relationships ===
Around the time of Duse&#x27;s retirement, she met and became involved in an affair with Italian feminist Lina Poletti, a former lover of writer Sibilla Aleramo. The two lived together in Florence, Italy, for two years before ending the relationship. She is reported to have had a relationship with Russian count and painter Alexander Wolkoff and lived in his palace in Venice, now known as Palazzo Barbaro Wolkoff.

=== Later life ===

Duse suffered from ill health (largely pulmonary) throughout most of her adult life, and the many years of touring had taken their toll. She retired from acting in 1909, but returned to the stage in 1921 in a series of engagements in both Europe and America.

During this interval, in 1916, she made one film, &quot;Cenere&quot; (&quot;Ashes&quot;), prints of which still survive. She was very disappointed in her work in the film, and later wrote to the French singer Yvette Guilbert with the request not to see &quot;that stupid thing, because you&#x27;ll find nothing, or almost nothing, of me in that film&quot;. There was also a certain amount of professional correspondence between Duse and D. W. Griffith, though ultimately nothing came of this.

On 30 July 1923, Duse became the first woman (and Italian) to be featured on the cover of the nascent magazine &quot;Time&quot;.

===Death===
Duse died of pneumonia at the age of 65 in Pittsburgh in Suite 524 of the Hotel Schenley while on the eastward return leg of a tour of the United States (the Hotel Schenley is now the William Pitt Union at the University of Pittsburgh). A bronze plaque in the lobby commemorates her death. After being moved to New York City, where she lay in state for four days before her funeral service, her body was returned to Italy (where another service was performed).

She is buried in Asolo – where she had made her home for the last four years of her life – at the cemetery of Sant&#x27; Anna. Her daughter Enrichetta donated some of her mother&#x27;s items to the state in 1933. These items are preserved in Asolo in the Museo Civico. In 1968 her granddaughter Eleonora Ilaria Bullough (aka Mary of St Mark as a Dominican nun) donated the last items to the Giorgio Cini Foundation in Venice.

== Acting philosophy ==

Duse was cryptic regarding her acting style. She claimed not to have a technique of any sort, and scorned at efforts to put her art into a science. What is known is that she had a highly heterodox, almost religious philosophy of acting, seeking to &quot;eliminate the self&quot; and become the characters she portrayed. It is a common misconception that her acting was purely intuitive and spontaneous, in reality she labored over her craft.

Duse wore little makeup but &quot;made herself up morally. In other words, she allowed the inner compulsions, grief and joys of her characters to use her body as their medium for expression, often to the detriment of her health.&quot;

According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, &quot;her art depended on intense naturalness rather than stage effect, sympathetic force and poignant intellectuality rather than the theatrical emotionalism of the French tradition.&quot;

Over the course of her career, Duse became well-known and respected for her assistance to young actors and actresses during the early stages of their careers. Among diverse artistic geniuses who acknowledged being inspired by Duse are modern dance pioneer Martha Graham and Imagist poetry pioneer Amy Lowell. She was great friends with actress Eva Le Gallienne, who wrote her biography.

==Recognition==
Duse was the subject of the 1947 biographical film &quot;Eleonora Duse&quot;. The Teatro Duse in Bologna is named for her. On the occasion of the celebrations in Asolo for the 100th anniversary of Duse&#x27;s death, an entire theatrical season was dedicated.

The upcoming film &quot;Duse&quot;, directed by Pietro Marcello, stars Valeria Bruni Tedeschi as Duse and Noémie Merlant as Enrichetta Checchi.

<text>The Granite Mountains are a short subrange of the Rocky Mountains in central Wyoming of the United States. The range runs approximately 100 mi (160 km) E-W along the south side of the Shoshone Basin, and north of the Sweetwater River, in eastern Fremont County and western Natrona County. The highest point is McIntosh Peak at . Independence Rock is at the east end of the range, and Split Rock was a prominent landmark on the Oregon Trail. The region is rich in uranium and other mineral deposits.

<doc id="523025" wikidata="Q947155" url="?curid=523025" title="Kirtan">
<text>Kirtana (; ), also rendered as Kiirtan, Kirtan or Keertan, is a Sanskrit word that means &quot;narrating, reciting, telling, describing&quot; of an idea or story, specifically in Indian religions. It also refers to a genre of religious performance arts, connoting a musical form of narration, shared recitation, or devotional singing, particularly of spiritual or religious ideas, native to the Indian subcontinent. A person performing kirtan is known as a &quot;kirtankara&quot; (or &quot;kirtankar,&quot; कीर्तनकार). 

With roots in the Vedic &quot;anukirtana&quot; tradition, a kirtan is a call-and-response or antiphonal style song or chant, set to music, wherein multiple singers recite the names of a deity, describe a legend, express loving devotion to a deity, or discuss spiritual ideas. It may include dancing or direct expression of &quot;bhavas&quot; (emotive states) by the singer. Many kirtan performances are structured to engage the audience where they either repeat the chant, or reply to the call of the singer.

A kirtan performance includes an accompaniment of regionally popular musical instruments, especially Indian instruments like the Indian harmonium, the veena, sitar, or ektara (strings), the tabla (one-sided drums), the mrdanga or pakhawaj (two-sided drum), flute (woodwinds), and karatalas or talas (cymbals). It is a major practice in Hinduism, Vaisnava devotionalism, Sikhism, the Sant traditions, and some forms of Buddhism, as well as other religious groups. Kirtan is sometimes accompanied by story-telling and acting. Texts typically cover religious, mythological or social subjects.

==Etymology and nomenclature==

The term &quot;kirtana&quot; (Devanagari: कीर्तन) generally means &quot;telling, narrating, describing, enumerating, reporting&quot;. The Sanskrit root of kirtan is &quot;kirt&quot; (). The term is found in the Samhitas, the Brahmanas, and other Vedic literature, as well as the Vedanga and Sutras literature. &quot;Kirt&quot;, according to Monier-Williams, contextually means &quot;to mention, make mention of, tell, name, call, recite, repeat, relate, declare, communicate, commemorate, celebrate, praise, glorify&quot;.

The term kirtan is found as &quot;anukirtan&quot; (or &quot;anukrti&quot;, &quot;anukarana&quot;, literally &quot;retelling&quot;) in the context of a Yajna (Vedic ritual offering), which meant a dual recitation of Vedic hymns in a dialogue style that was part of a ritual dramatic performance. 

The Sanskrit verses in the &quot;Shatapatha Brahmana&quot; (chapter 13.2, c. 800–700 BCE), for example, are written in the form of a riddle play between two actors. According to Louis Renou, in this text, &quot;the Vedic sacrifice (&quot;yajna&quot;) is presented as a kind of drama, with its actors, its dialogues, its portion to be set to music, its interludes, and its climaxes.&quot;

Generally speaking, kirtan, sometimes called &quot;sankirtana&quot; (literally, &quot;collective performance&quot;), is a kind of collective chanting or musical conversation. As a genre of religious performance art, it developed in the Indian bhakti movements as a devotional religious practice (i.e. bhakti yoga). But it is a heterogeneous practice that varies regionally, according to Christian Novetzke, and includes varying mixtures of musical instruments, dance, oration, theatre, audience participation, and moral narration. 

In Maharashtra for example, Novetzke says, a kirtan is a call-and-response style performance, ranging from devotional dancing and singing by a lead singer and audience to an &quot;intricate scholarly treatise, a social commentary or a philosophical/linguistic exposition&quot; that includes narration, allegory, humor, erudition and entertainment—all an aesthetic part of &quot;ranga&quot; (beauty, color) of the kirtan.

Kirtan is locally known by various names, including &quot;Abhang&quot;, &quot;Samaj Gayan&quot;, &quot;Haveli Sangeet&quot;, &quot;Vishnupad&quot;, &quot;Harikatha&quot;. Vaishnava temples in Assam and northeastern Indian have large worship halls called &quot;kirtan ghar&quot;—a name derived from their being used for congregational singing and performance arts. Kirtan is also sometimes called &quot;harinam&quot; (Sanskrit: harināma) in some Vaishnava traditions, which means &quot;[chanting] the names of God (Hari).&quot;

In regional languages, kirtan is scripted as ; Nepali and ; ; ; / ; Sindhi: / ; ; .

=== Bhajan and kirtan ===
Kirtans and &quot;bhajans&quot; are closely related, sharing common aims (devotion, faith, spiritual uplift and liberation), subjects, and musical themes. A &quot;bhajan&quot; is freer, and can be a single melody performed by a single singer with or without musical instruments. &quot;Kirtan&quot;, in contrast, is generally a group performance, typically with a call and response or antiphonal musical structure, similar to an intimate conversation or gentle sharing of ideas. Kirtan also generally includes two or more musical instruments, and has roots in Sanskrit prosody and poetic meter.

Many &quot;kirtans&quot; are structured for more audience participation, where the singer calls a spiritual chant, a hymn or a devotional theme, the audience responds by repeating the chant or by chanting back a reply of their shared beliefs.

==Hindu kirtan==



Musical recitation of hymns, mantras and the praise of deities has ancient roots in Hinduism, and may be found in the Vedic literature. A key feature of popular Hindu kirtan is that it is mostly sung in vernacular languages like Hindi and Bengali (unlike Vedic chanting, which is done in Sanskrit), though this may include Sanskrit mantras. This style of vernacular singing became popular during the medieval era (1300–1550) and the early modern period (1550–1750). 

Hindu kirtan is influenced by the practices and teachings of the various devotional Bhakti movements, who emphasized emotional loving relationship with a personal God, and also by the figures of the Sant tradition (like Kabir, Ravidas, and Namdev). Beginning with the Tamil Alvars and Nayanars in around the 6th century, bhakti spread outside Tamilakam after the 12th century. The foundations of the kirtan traditions are also found in works like the &quot;Bhagavad-gita&quot; which describes the bhakti marga (path of loving devotion to god) as a means to moksha. References to kirtan as a musical recitation are also found in the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, an important Vaishnava text. The story of Prahlada in the &quot;Avatara Katha&quot; mentions kirtan as one of nine forms of bhakti. 

Bhakti poets and musicians like Jayadeva (the 12th century author of the Sanskrit &quot;Gita Govinda&quot;) were influential in the development of Indian devotional music genres like kirtan (which, though written in the vernacular, often imitated the style of Sanskrit bhakti poems). Jayadeva was a great classical composer and wrote devotional music in the dhruvapada style (which is similar to dhrupad). 

There are various forms of Hindu kirtan, including northern traditions (often influenced by Hindustani music and Bengali music) and southern (Carnatic) traditions. Speaking of the Bengali kirtan tradition, Peggy Holroyde writes that &quot;kirtans do not strictly adhere to the raga scale and they incorporate a chorus led by a leader. Much of the musical value is subordinated to the sentimental emotion expressed in the words of the song.&quot; Regarding the southern (Carnatic) traditions of kirtan, they are generally &quot;less ornate&quot; than northern kirtan, making less use of &quot;grace, trills and arabesques&quot;, but they are also much more structured musical forms. 

While kirtan is influenced by the practice of Indian classical music, they are much simpler than the complicated instrumental and vocal compositions of Indian classical ensembles. The focus of kirtan is on the lyrics or mantras, which deliver religious messages and stories. Guy Beck, writing on the northern kirtan tradition, states that &quot;melody and rhythm are important, but devotional singers normally deplore musical virtuosity for its own sake, in contrast with the classical Hindustani and Karnatak traditions, which emphasize improvisation and technical mastery. A large variety of musical styles and forms exist, and no single formula has ever been mandated by custom to the exclusion of others. Musicians and religious leaders thus freely compose religious and devotional songs.&quot; However, some kirtan styles &quot;are&quot; highly refined and technical, like dhrupad and Bengali padavali kirtan, which is considered by Bengalis to be the most cultured religious music. 

Regarding the arrangement, most kirtan performances are done by a group, with a choir led by a lead singer sitting on the floor, though sometimes, kirtan is done by standing group in temples, religious processions, or on the street. 

Generally speaking, the performance may begin with recitations of Sanskrit mantras, like Om, names of deities, and may also include some Sanskrit prayers. Then the lead singer sings a song or a mantra while accompanying himself with a versatile instrument (like a harmonium or a sarangi), and the chorus (which may include the audience as well) repeats the lines and provides musical accompaniment and keeps the rhythm (with percussion instruments like the tabla). Sometimes the lead may have some solo lines, and the chorus can accompany them with a refrain. The performance may be punctuated by short sermons or stories. The song repertoire is generally drawn from medieval authors, but may include more recent additions. In temples, a formal worship ceremony (arati) may also follow. 

=== Styles of Hindu kirtan ===

==== Northern Vaishnava kirtan ====


One important promoter of Vaishnava kirtan in Bengal was Chandidas (1339–1399), who introduced Vaishnava kirtan in Bengali and was very influential on later Vaishnava northern kirtan. Chandidas was instrumental in the Bengali Vaiṣṇava Sahajiyā tradition, a form of tantric Vaishnavism focused on Radha and Krishna which flourished in Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, and Assam. The Vaiṣṇava Sahajiyā tradition produced many great Bengali language poets and singers. 

The 16th century CE saw an explosion of Vaishnava kirtan in the north. During this time, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu popularized Krishna based kirtan in Bengal, promoting and teaching the singing of Vaishnava songs which celebrate the love between Radha and Krishna, understood as being the love between the soul and God. Chaitanya is also known as the father of padavali singing, a highly developed and complex musical tradition. 

About the same time, Shankaradeva (1449–1568) in Assam inspired the Ekasarana Dharma bhakti movement that emphasized Advaita Vedanta philosophy within the Vaishnava framework of the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;. Shankaradeva helped establish &quot;Sattras&quot; (Hindu temples and monasteries) with &quot;kirtan-ghar&quot; (also called &quot;Namghar&quot;), for Krishnaite singing and dramatic performance.

Meanwhile, in the Braj region, Vallabha acharya launched a devotional movement which focused on kirtan songs about baby Krishna and his early childhood. One ofshoot of this tradition is the Radha-centered Radha-vallabha Sampradaya, whose singing style known as Haveli Sangeet is based on Hindustani classical forms like &quot;dhrupad&quot; and &quot;dhamar&quot;. Another kirtan style shared by the Braj traditions like the Vallabha, Haridasi, and Nimbarka is samaj gayan, which is a kind of collective singing.

Kirtan as a genre of religious music has been a major part of the Vaishnavism tradition, particularly starting with the Alvars of Sri Vaishnavism sub-tradition between the 7th to 10th century CE. After the 13th-century, two subgenres of kirtan emerged in Vaishnavism, namely the &quot;Nama-kirtana&quot; wherein the different names or aspects of god (a Vishnu avatar) are extolled, and the &quot;Lila- kirtana&quot; wherein the deity&#x27;s life and legends are narrated.

In the modern era, north Indian styles of kirtan are widely practiced in the modernist movements of Swami Sivananda, Anandamayi Ma, Sri Aurobindo, and A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. 

==== Carnatic traditions ====
In Andhra Pradesh, the compositions of the Tallapaka Annamacharya, a 14th-century Vaishnava mystic, represent the earliest known southern music called &quot;sankirtana&quot;. He wrote in praise of Lord Venkateswara, the deity of Seven Hills in Tirumala. During his long and prolific career, he reputedly composed and sang 32,000 Sankirtanas and 12 Shatakas (sets of hundred verses) in both Telugu and Sanskrit.

==== Marathi kirtan ====
There are three main styles of Marathi kirtan, Varkari, Naradiya and Jugalbandi.

Varkari Kirtan was pioneered by Sant Namdev (1270–1350) in Maharashtra. It is usually based on the works of seven famous Maharashtri saints: Saint Nivruttinath, Sant Dnyaneshwar, Sopandev, Muktabai, saint Eknath, Saint Namdev, and Saint Tukaram. Marathi kirtan is typically performed by one or two main performers, accompanied by harmonium and &quot;tabla&quot;. It involves singing, acting, dancing, and story-telling. 

The show goes for two or three hours as time permits and is not divided into parts like &quot;Naradiya Kirtan&quot;. This form was effectively performed for years by personalities like Hari Bhakti Parayan (sincere devotee of god) Sonopant (mama) Dandekar, Dhunda maharaj Deglurkar, Babamaharaj Satarkar, Dekhanebuwa, and many others in modern times. An institute at Alandi near Pune offers training in this form of Kirtan.

Naradiya Kirtan is divided into five main parts: naman (prayer), Purvaranga (the main spiritual lesson), chanting the names of God, katha or Akhyan (a story to support the lesson), final prayer. The Naradiya Marathi Kirtan popular in Maharashtra is most often performed by a single performer, and contains the poetry of saints of Maharashtra such as Dnyaneshwar, Eknath, Namdev and Tukaram. Learned poets from 17th and 18th century such as Shridhar, Mahipati, and Moropant contributed to develop this form of kirtan. A Naradiya kirtan performance can last for period of any length, from half an hour to three hours. Attendees may wear traditional clothing and the performers use instruments like the Indian harmonium, drums, and string instruments of various types mostly &quot;Zanz&quot;, &quot;chipali&quot;, &quot;Tal&quot; or &quot;Chimata&quot;. Naradiya kirtan performers are usually very learned in literature, music, dance, acting and comedy.

Jugalbandi Kirtan is performed by two persons, allowing question-answer, dialogue and debate. Performance requires skill in music, dance, comedy, oratory, debate, memory, general knowledge and Sanskrit literature. Training takes place at the Kirtan Kul in Sangli, the Akhil Bharatiya Kirtan Sanstha in Dadar, Mumbai, the Narad Mandir at Sadashiv Peth, Pune and the Kalidas Mahavidyalay in Ramtek, Nagpur as well as at smaller schools in Goa, Beed and Ujjain.

==Sikhism==


&quot;Kirtan&quot; (Gurmukhi: ਕੀਰਤਨ &quot;Kīratana&quot;) refers to devotional singing in Sikhism. It is typically performed at Gurdwaras (Sikh temples). Sikh scriptures and legends are usually recited in a song, to a certain &quot;raga&quot; and accompanied with musical instruments. The Gurus themselves created numerous musical instruments including the Taus, the Sarangi, the Saranda and a modification of the Pakhawaj (called Jori) creating an early form of the Tabla.

A &quot;Shabad Kirtan&quot; refers to the musical recitation of the Guru Granth Sahib, the primary scripture in the Sikhism tradition which is arranged according to &quot;raga&quot;. &quot;Shabad Kirtan&quot; can be listened to silently or sung along with the gathered congregation.

&quot;Kirtan&quot; in Sikh history has been the musical analog of &quot;Kathas&quot; recitation, both preferably performed by &quot;ragi jatha&quot;, or professional trained performers. A Sikh Kirtan is a religious, aesthetic and social event, usually held in a congregational setting on Sundays or over certain festivals to honor the historical Gurus, but major temples in the Sikh tradition recite &quot;Kirtan&quot; every day as a mark of daily bhakti (devotional remembrance) of God&#x27;s name. 

This congregational setting is called a &quot;Sangat&quot; or &quot;Satsang&quot;, a word that in ancient Indian texts means &quot;like minded individuals, or fellow travelers on a spiritual journey&quot;.

==Buddhism==
Numerous Buddhist traditions use vocal music with instrumental accompaniment as part of their rituals and devotional practices. Buddhist vocal music and chanting is often part of Buddhist rituals and festivals in which they may be seen as offerings to the Buddha. Chants, songs and plays about the life of the Buddha by the Buddhists of Bengal are sometimes called &quot;Buddha-samkirtan&quot; or &quot;Buddha kirtan.&quot; Instruments like the Indian harmonium, flute, dotara, khol and kartal are used as accompaniment&quot;.&quot; 

Music has been used by Buddhists since the time of early Buddhism, as attested by artistic depictions in Indian sites like Sanchi. Early Buddhist sources often have a negative attitude towards music, possibly because it was considered sensual and inconsistent with its core monastic teachings. However, Mahayana and Vajrayana sources tend to be much more positive to music, seeing it as a suitable offering to the Buddhas and as a skillful means to bring sentient beings to Buddhism. Buddhist songs and chants make use of the following genres: sutras, mantras, dharani, parittas, or verse compositions (such as gathas, stotras, and caryagitis). 

Examples of Buddhist musical traditions include the Newari Buddhist Gunlā Bājan, Tibetan Buddhist music, Japanese Buddhist Shōmyō, modern Indian Buddhist bhajans, and Cambodian Smot chanting. As there are many different traditions of Buddhist music and chanting, the musical instruments used vary widely, from solely relying on the human voice, to many types of classic instruments used in Asian music (such as the ancient Indian veena) as well as modern instruments (harmonium, keyboards, guitars, etc). 

There are also some Western Buddhists who have recently adopted kirtan singing. One Western Buddhist kirtan artist is Lee Mirabai Harrington.

== Judaism ==
The Bene Israel, a Jewish community in the Indian subcontinent, adopted the devotional singing style Kirtan from their Marathi Hindu neighbors. Their main traditional musical instruments are the Indian Harmonium and the Bulbul tarang.

In the modern era, kirtan has also been adopted by several jews like Susan Deikman. These jewish kirtans replace Sanskrit Hindu lyrics with Hebrew songs and chants.

==In the Western world==


The famed Bengali saint Paramahansa Yogananda was an early proponent of kirtan in the West. He chanted Guru Nanak Dev&#x27;s &quot;Hey Hari Sundara&quot; (&quot;Oh God Beautiful&quot;) with 3,000 people at Carnegie Hall in 1923. 

Kirtan became more common with the spread of Indian religious movements in the West in the 1960s. Movements which were influential in bringing Indian kirtan to West include the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), 3HO (Sikh followers of Yogi Bhajan), the Ramakrishna mission, the Divine Life Society, and Yogananda&#x27;s Self-Realization Fellowship.

Western kirtan singers, some of who learned in India, have also popularized the practice. Western kirtan performers include Krishna Das, Bhagavan Das, Nina Rao, Wah!, Jai Uttal, Snatam Kaur, Lokah Music, Deva Premal, Jahnavi Harrison, Jim Gelcer, Jyoshna, Aindra Das, Gina Sala&#x27;, and Gaura Vani &amp; As Kindred Spirits. Western Yoga centers report an increase in attendance at kirtans; according to &quot;Pure Music&quot;″s Frank Goodman in conversation with Krishna Das in 2006, kirtan has taken on a wider popularity. Some Western kirtan singers have also adapted kirtan songs with influences from other styles, including rock music, new-age music, African music and latin american music. There are also Kirtan singers in the west who sing more traditional Indian style kirtan such as Kamini Natarajan and Sheela Bringi.

Kirtan singing has also become popular among Westerners who consider themselves spiritual but who are not part of any specific religious institution or movement (&quot;spiritual but not religious&quot;). In this case, kirtan is seen as a social, expressive and holistic experience which helps one connect with the inner self. It is also considered egalitarian and manifests as an eclectic practice which draws on multiple cultures and is tolerant to most religions. Western spiritual kirtan can be found in Western yoga centers, new age groups, spiritual communes, and neo-shamanic circles. 

For some Western practitioners, kirtan is seen as a way of socializing, relaxing, achieving meditative states, expressing oneself, attaining inner peace and positive emotions, getting to know one&#x27;s inner self, and cultivating love for a deity and for others. 

In the United States case law, the term &quot;sankirtana&quot; has also been used to specifically refer to the promotional activities of ISKCON. ISKCON had sought the right to perform &quot;sankirtana&quot; in California airports such as in Los Angeles. The court ruled that while ISKCON has a constitutional rights of protected speech, the Los Angeles airport also has a right to forbid any form of solicitation, out of &quot;a legitimate interest in controlling pedestrian congestion and reducing the risk of fraud and duress attendant to repetitive, in-person solicitation of funds&quot; by all groups including ISKCON.

==Given name==
The male given name Kirtan or Kirtana is used in South India for females as well, particularly in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu.

<text>The Windsor uniform is a type of formal dress worn at Windsor Castle by male members of the British royal family (and some very senior courtiers).

==History==

The uniform was introduced by King George III in 1777. The full dress version, which had a good deal of gold braid about it, did not survive beyond 1936, but the undress version, introduced in 1798, is still worn today: a dark blue jacket with red facings. It is now worn only at Windsor Castle, and since the reign of King Edward VII, it has generally been worn only as evening dress (although King Charles III has worn a version of it as a riding coat).

The uniform currently takes the form of an evening tail coat of dark blue cloth, lapelled, with scarlet collar and cuffs. There are three buttons on each front, two at the back of the waist, two at the end of each tail, and also two on each cuff (plus one above). The gilt buttons bear a design of a Garter star within a garter, surmounted by the imperial crown.

It is worn with a white single-breasted waistcoat with three small gilt buttons of the same pattern, and with plain black evening-dress trousers. When the court is in mourning, a black waistcoat and black armband are worn. As well as the tail coat version, the late Duke of Edinburgh also wore (and King Charles III continues to wear) a dinner jacket version of the coat.

<doc id="523032" wikidata="Q15935" url="?curid=523032" title="Kanye West">
<text>Ye ( ; born Kanye Omari West ; June 8, 1977) is an American rapper and record producer. One of the most prominent figures in hip-hop, he is known for his varying musical style and polarizing cultural and political commentary. After dropping out of college to pursue a career in music, West began producing for regional artists in the Chicago area. As an in-house producer for Roc-A-Fella Records, he co-produced albums including Jay-Z&#x27;s &quot;The Blueprint&quot; (2001) before signing with the label as a recording artist. West&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;The College Dropout&quot; (2004), was met with critical acclaim and yielded the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100-number one single &quot;Slow Jamz&quot;. He peaked the chart on four other occasions with the singles &quot;Gold Digger&quot; (2005), &quot;Stronger&quot; (2007), &quot;E.T.&quot; (2011, as a featured artist), and &quot;Carnival&quot; (2024).

West&#x27;s second and third studio albums, &quot;Late Registration&quot; (2005) and &quot;Graduation&quot; (2007), both debuted atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the latter becoming West&#x27;s most commercially successful to date. Three of his subsequent albums, &quot;808s &amp; Heartbreak&quot; (2008), &quot;My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy&quot; (2010), and &quot;The Life of Pablo&quot; (2016), were certified triple platinum, and &quot;Yeezus&quot; (2013) was certified double platinum. &quot;Ye&quot; (2018), &quot;Jesus Is King&quot; (2019), and &quot;Donda&quot; (2021) continued West&#x27;s series of consecutive number one debuts on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. West has also released the collaborative albums &quot;Watch the Throne&quot; (2011) with Jay-Z, &quot;Kids See Ghosts&quot; (2018) with Kid Cudi, as well as &quot;Vultures 1&quot; and &quot;Vultures 2&quot; (2024) with Ty Dolla Sign. In fashion design, he has collaborated with Nike, Inc., Louis Vuitton, and Gap Inc. on clothing and footwear, and led the Yeezy collaboration with Adidas.

One of the world&#x27;s best-selling music artists with 160 million records sold, West has won 24 Grammy Awards, the 7th-most of all time. His other accolades include a &quot;Billboard&quot; Artist Achievement Award, a joint-record three Brit Awards for Best International Male Solo Artist, and the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award. West holds the joint record (with Bob Dylan) for most albums (4) topping the annual Pazz &amp; Jop critic poll. &quot;Time&quot; named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2005 and 2015. West&#x27;s first six solo albums were included on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list in 2020, with the same publication naming him one of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time.

West&#x27;s outspoken views have received significant media coverage. He has been a frequent source of controversy due to his conduct on social media, at award shows and in public settings, as well as his comments on the music and fashion industries, U.S. politics, race, and slavery. His Christian faith, high-profile marriage to Kim Kardashian, and mental health have also been topics of media attention. In 2020, West launched an unsuccessful independent presidential campaign that advocated for a consistent life ethic. Starting in 2022, West has drawn widespread condemnationand lost sponsors and partnershipsfor his antisemitic views. He has self-identified as a Nazi, praised Adolf Hitler, used swastika imagery, and denied the Holocaust.

== Early life ==
Kanye Omari West was born on June 8, 1977, in Atlanta, Georgia. After his parents divorced when he was three years old, he moved with his mother to Chicago, Illinois. His father, Ray West, is a former Black Panther and was one of the first black photojournalists at &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot;. Ray later became a Christian counselor, and in 2006, opened the Good Water Store and Café in Lexington Park, Maryland, with startup capital from his son. West&#x27;s mother, Donda C. West (née Williams), was a professor of English at Clark Atlanta University and the Chair of the English Department at Chicago State University before retiring to serve as his manager.

West was raised in a middle-class environment, attending Polaris School for Individual Education in suburban Oak Lawn, Illinois, after living in Chicago. At the age of 10, West moved with his mother to Nanjing, China, where she was teaching at Nanjing University as a Fulbright Scholar. According to his mother, West was the only foreigner in his class, but he settled in well and quickly picked up the language, although he has since forgotten most of it. When asked about his grades in high school, West replied, &quot;I got A&#x27;s and B&#x27;s.&quot;

West demonstrated an affinity for the arts at an early age; he began writing poetry when he was five years old. West started rapping in the third grade and began making musical compositions in the seventh grade, eventually selling them to other artists. West crossed paths with producer No I.D., who became West&#x27;s friend and mentor. After graduating from high school, West received a scholarship to attend Chicago&#x27;s American Academy of Art in 1997 and began taking painting classes. Shortly after, he transferred to Chicago State University to study English. At age 20, he dropped out to pursue his musical career. This greatly displeased his mother, who was also a professor at the university, although she would later accept the decision.

== Musical career ==
=== 1996–2002: Early work and Roc-A-Fella ===
West began his early production career in the mid-1990s, creating beats primarily for burgeoning local artists in the Chicago area. He received his first official production credits at age nineteen, when he produced eight tracks on &quot;Down to Earth&quot;, the 1996 debut album of Chicago-based underground rapper Grav. In 1998, West was the first producer signed to the management-production company Hip Hop Since 1978, founded by Gee Roberson and Kyambo &quot;Hip-Hop&quot; Joshua. For a time, West acted as a ghost producer for Deric &quot;D-Dot&quot; Angelettie. Due to his association with Angelettie, West was not able to release a solo album, so he formed the Go-Getters, a hip-hop group composed of him and fellow Chicago natives GLC, Timmy G, Really Doe, and Arrowstar. The Go-Getters independently released their first and only studio album, &quot;World Record Holders&quot; in 1999 through West&#x27;s company, Konman Productions. West spent much of the late 1990s further producing for several musical acts. He produced the third track on Foxy Brown&#x27;s second studio album &quot;Chyna Doll&quot; (1999), which became the second hip-hop album by a female rapper to peak atop the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart.
In 2000, West began producing for artists on Roc-A-Fella Records as an in-house producer. West is often credited with revitalizing Jay-Z&#x27;s career with extensive contributions to his 2001 album &quot;The Blueprint&quot;, which &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked among their list of greatest hip-hop albums. West produced songs for label cohorts such as Beanie Sigel and Freeway, but also produced beats which were used by artists on other labels including Ludacris, Alicia Keys, and Janet Jackson. Meanwhile, West struggled to attain a record deal as a rapper. Multiple record companies, including Capitol Records, denied or ignored him because he did not portray the gangsta image prominent in mainstream hip-hop at the time. Desperate to keep West from defecting to another label, then-label head Damon Dash reluctantly signed West to Roc-A-Fella as a recording artist.

A 2002 car accident, which shattered his jaw, inspired West; two weeks after being admitted to the hospital, he recorded &quot;Through the Wire&quot; at the Record Plant Studios with his jaw still wired shut. The song was first included on West&#x27;s debut mixtape &quot;Get Well Soon...&quot;, which was released in December 2002. At the same time, West announced that he was working on an album titled &quot;The College Dropout&quot;, whose overall theme was to &quot;make your own decisions. Don&#x27;t let society tell you, &#x27;This is what you have to do.&#x27;&quot;

=== 2003–2006: &quot;The College Dropout&quot; and &quot;Late Registration&quot; ===

West recorded the remainder of the album in Los Angeles while recovering from the car accident. It was leaked months before its release date, and West used the opportunity to remix, remaster, and revise the album before its release; West added new verses, string arrangements, gospel choirs, and improved drum programming. The album was postponed three times from its initial date in August 2003, and was eventually released in February 2004, reaching No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 as his debut single, &quot;Through the Wire&quot; peaked at No. 15 while on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart for five weeks. &quot;Slow Jamz&quot;, his second single, featuring Twista and Jamie Foxx, became the three musicians&#x27; first No. 1 hit. &quot;The College Dropout&quot; received critical acclaim, was nominated for the top album of the year by &quot;American Music Awards&quot; and &quot;Billboard&quot;, and has consistently been ranked among the great hip-hop works and debut albums by artists.

&quot;Jesus Walks&quot;, the album&#x27;s fourth single, reached the top 20 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop charts, despite industry executives&#x27; predictions that a song containing such blatant declarations of faith would never make it to the radio. &quot;The College Dropout&quot; was certified triple platinum in the U.S., and garnered West 10 Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year, and Best Rap Album (which it received). During this period, West founded GOOD Music, a record label and management company that housed affiliate artists and producers, such as No I.D. and John Legend, and produced singles for Brandy, Common, Legend, and Slum Village.

West invested $2 million and took over a year to make his second album. West was inspired by &quot;Roseland NYC Live&quot;, a 1998 live album by English trip hop group Portishead, produced with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, incorporating string arrangements into his hip-hop production. Though West had not been able to afford many live instruments around the time of his debut album, the money from his commercial success enabled him to hire a string orchestra for his second album &quot;Late Registration&quot;. West collaborated with American film score composer Jon Brion, who served as the album&#x27;s co-executive producer for several tracks. &quot;Late Registration&quot; sold over 2.3 million units in the United States alone by the end of 2005 and was considered by industry observers as the only successful major album release of the fall season, which had been plagued by steadily declining CD sales.

When his song &quot;Touch the Sky&quot; failed to win Best Video at the 2006 MTV Europe Music Awards, West went onto the stage as the award was being presented to Justice and Simian for &quot;We Are Your Friends&quot; and argued that he should have won the award instead. Hundreds of news outlets worldwide criticized the outburst. On November 7, 2006, West apologized for this outburst publicly during his performance as support act for U2 for their Vertigo concert in Brisbane. He later spoofed the incident on the 33rd-season premiere of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in September 2007.

=== 2007–2009: &quot;Graduation&quot;, &quot;808s &amp; Heartbreak&quot;, and VMAs incident ===
West&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Graduation&quot;, garnered major publicity when its release date pitted West in a sales competition against rapper 50 Cent&#x27;s &quot;Curtis&quot;. Upon their September 2007 releases, &quot;Graduation&quot; outsold &quot;Curtis&quot; by a large margin, debuting at number one on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and selling 957,000 copies in its first week. &quot;Graduation&quot; continued the string of critical and commercial successes by West, and the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Stronger&quot;, garnered his third number-one hit. &quot;Stronger&quot;, which samples French house duo Daft Punk, has been accredited to not only encouraging other hip-hop artists to incorporate house and electronica elements into their music, but also for playing a part in the revival of disco and electro-infused music in the late 2000s. His mother&#x27;s death in November 2007 and the end of his engagement to Alexis Phifer profoundly affected West, who set off for his 2008 Glow in the Dark Tour shortly thereafter.
Recorded mostly in Honolulu, Hawaii in three weeks, West announced his fourth album, &quot;808s &amp; Heartbreak&quot;, at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards, where he performed its lead single, &quot;Love Lockdown&quot;. Music audiences were taken aback by the uncharacteristic production style and the presence of Auto-Tune, which typified the pre-release response to the record. &quot;808s &amp; Heartbreak&quot; was released by Island Def Jam in November 2008. Upon its release, the lead single &quot;Love Lockdown&quot; debuted at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, while follow-up single &quot;Heartless&quot; debuted at number four. While it was criticized prior to release, &quot;808s &amp; Heartbreak&quot; is considered to have had a significant effect on hip-hop music, encouraging other rappers to take more creative risks with their productions.

While Taylor Swift was accepting her award for Best Female Video at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, West went on stage and grabbed the microphone from her to proclaim that Beyoncé deserved the award instead. He was subsequently removed from the remainder of the show for his actions. West was criticized by various celebrities for the outburst, and by President Barack Obama, who called West a &quot;jackass&quot;. The incident sparked a large influx of Internet photo memes. West subsequently apologized, including personally to Swift. However, in a November 2010 interview, he seemed to recant his past apologies, describing the act at the 2009 awards show as &quot;selfless&quot;.

=== 2010–2012: &quot;My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Watch the Throne&quot;, and &quot;Cruel Summer&quot; ===
Following the highly publicized incident, West took a brief break from music and threw himself into fashion, only to hole up in Hawaii for the next few months writing and recording his next album. Importing his favorite producers and artists to work on and inspire his recording, West kept engineers behind the boards 24 hours a day and slept only in increments. Noah Callahan-Bever, a writer for &quot;Complex&quot;, was present during the sessions and described the &quot;communal&quot; atmosphere as thus: &quot;With the right songs and the right album, he can overcome any and all controversy, and we are here to contribute, challenge, and inspire.&quot; A variety of artists contributed to the project, including close friends Jay-Z, Kid Cudi and Pusha T, as well as collaborations with artists including Justin Vernon of Bon Iver and Gil Scott Heron.
&quot;My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy&quot;, West&#x27;s fifth studio album, was released in November 2010 to widespread acclaim from critics, many of whom considered it his best work and said it solidified his comeback. In stark contrast to his previous effort, which featured a minimalist sound, &quot;Dark Fantasy&quot; adopts a maximalist philosophy and deals with themes of celebrity and excess. The record included the international hit &quot;All of the Lights&quot;, and &quot;Billboard&quot; hits &quot;Power&quot;, &quot;Monster&quot;, and &quot;Runaway&quot;, the latter of which accompanied a 35-minute film of the same name directed by and starring West. During this time, West initiated the free music program GOOD Fridays through his website, offering a free download of previously unreleased songs each Friday, a portion of which were included on the album. This promotion ran from August to December 2010. &quot;Dark Fantasy&quot; went on to go platinum in the United States, but its omission as a contender for Album of the Year at the 54th Grammy Awards was viewed as a &quot;snub&quot; by several media outlets.

2011 saw West embark on a festival tour to commemorate the release of &quot;My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy&quot; performing and headlining numerous festivals including; SWU Music &amp; Arts, Austin City Limits Music Festival, Oya Festival, Flow Festival, Live Music Festival,
The Big Chill, Essence Music Festival, Lollapalooza and Coachella which was described by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; as &quot;one of greatest hip-hop sets of all time&quot;, West released the collaborative album &quot;Watch the Throne&quot; with Jay-Z in August 2011. By employing a sales strategy that released the album digitally weeks before its physical counterpart, &quot;Watch the Throne&quot; became one of the few major label albums in the Internet age to avoid a leak. &quot;Niggas in Paris&quot; became the record&#x27;s highest-charting single, peaking at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The co-headlining Watch the Throne Tour kicked off in October 2011 and concluded in June 2012. In 2012, West released the compilation album &quot;Cruel Summer&quot;, a collection of tracks by artists from West&#x27;s record label GOOD Music.

=== 2013–2015: &quot;Yeezus&quot; and the &quot;Yeezus Tour&quot; ===
Sessions for West&#x27;s sixth solo effort begin to take shape in early 2013 in his own personal loft&#x27;s living room at a Paris hotel. Determined to &quot;undermine the commercial&quot;, he once again brought together close collaborators and attempted to incorporate Chicago drill, dancehall, acid house, and industrial music. Primarily inspired by architecture, West&#x27;s perfectionist tendencies led him to contact producer Rick Rubin fifteen days shy of its due date to strip down the record&#x27;s sound in favor of a more minimalist approach. Initial promotion of his sixth album included worldwide video projections of the album&#x27;s music and live television performances. &quot;Yeezus&quot;, West&#x27;s sixth album, was released June 18, 2013, to rave reviews from critics. It became his sixth consecutive number one debut, but also marked his lowest solo opening week sales.
In September 2013, West announced he would be headlining his first solo tour in five years, to support &quot;Yeezus&quot;, with fellow American rapper Kendrick Lamar accompanying him as a supporting act. The tour was met with rave reviews from critics. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described it as &quot;crazily entertaining, hugely ambitious, emotionally affecting (really!) and, most importantly, totally bonkers&quot;. Writing for &quot;Forbes&quot;, Zack O&#x27;Malley Greenburg praised West for &quot;taking risks that few pop stars, if any, are willing to take in today&#x27;s hyper-exposed world of pop&quot;, describing the show as &quot;overwrought and uncomfortable at times, but [it] excels at challenging norms and provoking thought in a way that just isn&#x27;t common for mainstream musical acts of late&quot;. West subsequently released a number of singles featuring Paul McCartney, including &quot;Only One&quot; and &quot;FourFiveSeconds&quot;, also featuring Rihanna.

In November 2013, West stated that he was beginning work on his next studio album, hoping to release it by mid-2014, with production by Rick Rubin and Q-Tip. Having initially announced a new album entitled &quot;Yeezus II&quot; slated for a 2014 release, West announced in March 2015 that the album would instead be tentatively called &quot;So Help Me God&quot;. In May 2015, West was awarded an honorary doctorate by the School of the Art Institute of Chicago for his contributions to music, fashion, and popular culture. The next month, West headlined at the Glastonbury Festival in the UK, despite a petition signed by almost 135,000 people against his appearance. Another petition aimed to block West from headlining the 2015 Pan American Games, garnering 50,000 supporters.

=== 2016–2017: &quot;The Life of Pablo&quot; and tour cancellation ===
West announced in January 2016 that &quot;Swish&quot; would be released on February 11, and later that month, released new songs &quot;Real Friends&quot; and a snippet of &quot;No More Parties in LA&quot; with Kendrick Lamar. On January 26, 2016, West revealed he had renamed the album from &quot;Swish&quot; to &quot;Waves&quot;. In the weeks leading up to the album&#x27;s release, West became embroiled in several Twitter controversies. Several days ahead of its release, West again changed the title, this time to &quot;The Life of Pablo&quot;. On February 11, West premiered the album at Madison Square Garden as part of the presentation of his Yeezy Season3 clothing line. Following the preview, West announced that he would be modifying the tracklist once more before its release to the public. He released the album exclusively on Tidal on February 14, 2016, following a performance on &quot;SNL&quot;. Following its release, West continued to tinker with mixes of several tracks, describing the work as &quot;a living breathing changing creative expression&quot; and proclaiming the end of the album as a dominant release form. Despite West&#x27;s earlier comments, in addition to Tidal, the album was released through several other competing services starting in April.
In February 2016, West stated on Twitter that he was planning to release another album in the summer of 2016, tentatively called &quot;Turbo Grafx 16&quot; in reference to the 1990s video game console of the same name. In June 2016, West released the collaborative lead single &quot;Champions&quot; off the GOOD Music album &quot;Cruel Winter&quot;, which has yet to be released. Later that month, West released a controversial video for &quot;Famous&quot;, which depicted wax figures of several celebrities (including West, Kardashian, Taylor Swift, businessman and then-presidential candidate Donald Trump, comedian Bill Cosby, and former president George W. Bush) sleeping nude in a shared bed.

In August 2016, West embarked on the Saint Pablo Tour in support of &quot;The Life of Pablo.&quot; The performances featured a mobile stage suspended from the ceiling. West postponed several dates in October following the Paris robbery of several of his wife&#x27;s effects. On November 21, 2016, West cancelled the remaining 21 dates on the Saint Pablo Tour, following a week of no-shows, curtailed concerts and rants about politics. He was later admitted for psychiatric observation at UCLA Medical Center. He stayed hospitalized over the Thanksgiving weekend because of a temporary psychosis stemming from sleep deprivation and extreme dehydration. Following this episode West took an 11-month break from posting on Twitter and the public in general.

=== 2017–2019: &quot;Ye&quot; and the Wyoming Sessions ===

It was reported in May 2017 that West was recording new music in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, with a wide range of collaborators. In April 2018, West announced plans to write a philosophy book entitled &quot;Break the Simulation&quot;, later clarifying that he was sharing the book &quot;in real time&quot; on Twitter and began posting content that was likened to &quot;life coaching&quot;. Later that month, he also announced two new albums, a solo album and self-titled collaboration with Kid Cudi under the name Kids See Ghosts, both of which would be released in June. Additionally, he revealed he would produce upcoming albums by GOOD Music label-mates Pusha T and Teyana Taylor, as well as Nas. Shortly thereafter, West released the non-album singles &quot;Lift Yourself&quot; and &quot;Ye vs. the People&quot;, in which he and T.I. discussed West&#x27;s support of Donald Trump.

Pusha T&#x27;s &quot;Daytona&quot;, &quot;the first project out of Wyoming&quot;, was released in May to critical acclaim, although the album&#x27;s artwork—a photograph of deceased singer Whitney Houston&#x27;s bathroom that West paid $85,000 to license—attracted some controversy. The following week, West released his eighth studio album, &quot;Ye&quot;. West has suggested that he scrapped the original recordings of the album and re-recorded it within a month. The week after, West released a collaborative album with Kid Cudi, titled &quot;Kids See Ghosts&quot;, named after their group of the same name. West also completed production work on Nas&#x27; &quot;Nasir&quot; and Teyana Taylor&#x27;s &quot;K.T.S.E.&quot;, which were released in June 2018.

In September, West announced his ninth studio album &quot;Yandhi&quot; to be released by the end of the month and a collaborative album with fellow Chicagoan rapper Chance the Rapper titled &quot;Good Ass Job&quot;. That same month, West announced that he would be changing his stage name to &quot;Ye&quot;. &quot;Yandhi&quot; was originally set for release in September 2018 but was postponed multiple times. In January 2019, West pulled out of headlining that year&#x27;s Coachella festival after negotiations broke down due to discord regarding stage design. In July, it was reported that songs from West&#x27;s unreleased album &quot;Yandhi&quot; were leaked online. The following month, Kim Kardashian announced that West&#x27;s next album would be titled &quot;Jesus Is King&quot;, effectively scrapping &quot;Yandhi&quot;. By October, the entire unfinished album was available for a short time on streaming services Spotify and Tidal.

=== 2019–2022: &quot;Jesus Is King&quot;, &quot;Donda&quot;, and &quot;Donda 2&quot; ===

On January 6, 2019, West started his weekly &quot;Sunday Service&quot; events, which included soul variations of both West&#x27;s and others&#x27; songs and were attended by multiple celebrities, including the Kardashians, Charlie Wilson, and Kid Cudi. West previewed a new song, &quot;Water&quot; at his &quot;Sunday Service&quot; orchestration performance at Coachella 2019, which was later revealed to feature on his upcoming album &quot;Jesus Is King&quot;; West released the album on October 25, 2019. It became the first to ever top the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums, Top Rap Albums, Top Christian Albums and Top Gospel Albums at the same time. On December 25, 2019, West and Sunday Service released &quot;Jesus Is Born&quot;, containing 19 songs, including several re-workings of older West songs.

West released a single titled &quot;Wash Us in the Blood&quot; on June 30, 2020, featuring fellow American rapper and singer Travis Scott, along with the music video, which was set to serve as the lead single from his tenth studio album &quot;Donda&quot;. However, in September 2020, West stated that he would not be releasing any further music until he is &quot;done with [his] contract with Sony and Universal&quot;. On October 16, he released the single &quot;Nah Nah Nah&quot;. West held several listening parties at Mercedes-Benz Stadium for his upcoming album &quot;Donda&quot; in the summer of 2021, where he had taken up temporary residence in one of the stadium&#x27;s locker rooms, converting it into a recording studio to finish the recording. After multiple delays, &quot;Donda&quot; was released on August 29, 2021. West claimed the album was released early without his approval and alleged that Universal had altered the tracklist. He released a deluxe edition of &quot;Donda&quot;, including five new songs, to streaming services on November 14, 2021. On November 20, days after ending their long-running feud, West and rapper Drake confirmed that they would stage the &quot;Free Larry Hoover&quot; benefit concert on December 9 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.

On January 5, 2022, West was announced as one of the 2022 headliners of Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. Later that month on January 15, West released the first single for his upcoming album &quot;Donda 2&quot;, &quot;Eazy&quot; featuring The Game, to be executive produced by American rapper Future. West hosted a listening event for the album at LoanDepot Park in Miami, Florida, on February 22. In April, shortly before Coachella, West pulled out as headlining act, then proceeded to pull out of headlining Rolling Loud. West and The Game performed the single on July 22, marking West&#x27;s first performance in five months following the low profile he had been keeping since &quot;Donda 2&quot; remained unfinished. A day later, despite cancelling as headliner, he appeared at Rolling Loud during Lil Durk&#x27;s set. In December 2022, after weeks of controversial antisemitic statements, West released a new song, &quot;Someday We&#x27;ll All Be Free&quot;, on his Instagram.

=== 2023–present: &quot;Vultures&quot; trilogy and &quot;Bully&quot; ===
On August 25, 2023, West was reported to be in the process of recording his eleventh studio album, with two sources close to him stating that the release of new music was &quot;imminent&quot;. On October 13, &quot;Billboard&quot; reported that West had finished recording a collaborative studio album with Ty Dolla Sign and was in the process of shopping the album to distributors, adding that the album was originally intended for an official release that day but was ultimately pushed back for unknown reasons and expected to drop within the coming weeks. The eponymous lead single for the album, &quot;Vultures&quot; featuring Bump J, was released on November 22, 2023.

Throughout late 2023 and early 2024, West and Ty Dolla $ign held several concerts previewing songs from the album. In a trailer for the album, West announced that &quot;Vultures&quot; would be released as a trilogy of albums, with each of the album&#x27;s three volumes set to be released on February 9, March 6, and April 5, 2024. In January 2024, West co-signed 4Batz and called him his favorite new artist. On February 8, 2024, West released the first volume&#x27;s second single, &quot;Talking / Once Again&quot; featuring his eldest daughter North. A day later, producer Erick Sermon revealed in an interview that West&#x27;s upcoming eleventh studio album was titled &quot;Y3&quot;, while also stating that he had contributed to the album in 2023. West has since denied working on an album titled &quot;Y3&quot;.

On February 10, 2024, hours after West held a listening party at UBS Arena, the first volume of the &quot;Vultures&quot; trilogy, entitled &quot;Vultures 1&quot;, was officially released. The album debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, becoming West&#x27;s eleventh consecutive and Ty Dolla Sign&#x27;s first number one album, respectively. &quot;Vultures 2&quot; released later that year on August 3. On September 28, during a concert in Haikou, China at the Wuyuan River Stadium, West announced his eleventh solo album &quot;Bully&quot;, debuting the track &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;.

== Musical style ==

West&#x27;s musical career is defined by frequent stylistic shifts and different musical approaches. In the subsequent years since his debut, West has both musically and lyrically taken an increasingly experimental approach to crafting progressive hip-hop music while maintaining accessible pop sensibilities. Ed Ledsham of &quot;PopMatters&quot; said that &quot;West&#x27;s melding of multiple genres into the hip-hop fold is a complex act that challenges the dominant white notions of what constitutes true &#x27;art&#x27; music.&quot; West&#x27;s rhymes have been described as funny, provocative and articulate, capable of seamlessly segueing from shrewd commentary to comical braggadocio to introspective sensitivity. West imparts that he strives to speak in an inclusive manner so groups from different racial and gender backgrounds can comprehend his lyrics, saying he desired to sound &quot;just as ill as Jadakiss and just as understandable as Will Smith&quot;. Early in his career, West pioneered a style of hip-hop production dubbed &quot;chipmunk-soul&quot;, a sampling technique involving the manipulation of tempo in order to chop and stretch pitched-up samples from vintage soul songs.

On his debut studio album, &quot;The College Dropout&quot; (2004), West formed the constitutive elements of his style, described as intricate hip-hop beats, topical subject matter, and clumsy rapping laced with inventive wordplay. The record saw West diverge from the then-dominant gangster persona in hip-hop in favor of more diverse, topical lyrical subjects, including higher education, materialism, self-consciousness, minimum-wage labor, institutional prejudice, class struggle, family, sexuality, his struggles in the music industry, and middle-class upbringing. Over time, West has explored a variety of music genres, encompassing and taking inspiration from chamber pop on his second studio album, &quot;Late Registration&quot; (2005), arena rock and europop on his third album, &quot;Graduation&quot; (2007), synth-driven electropop on his fourth album, &quot;808s &amp; Heartbreak&quot; (2008), acid-house, drill, industrial rap and trap on &quot;Yeezus&quot; (2013), gospel and Christian rap on &quot;The Life of Pablo&quot; (2016), &quot;Jesus is King&quot; (2019) and &quot;Donda&quot; (2021), and psychedelic music on &quot;Kids See Ghosts&quot; (2018).

== Other ventures ==
=== Fashion ===
Early in his career, West made clear his interest in fashion and desire to work in the clothing design industry. He launched his own clothing line in spring 2006, and developed it over the following four years before the line was ultimately cancelled in 2009. In January 2007, West&#x27;s first sneaker collaboration was released, a special-edition Bapesta from A Bathing Ape. In 2009, West collaborated with Nike to release his own shoe, the Air Yeezys, becoming the first non-athlete to be given a shoe deal with the company. In January 2009, he introduced his first shoe line designed for Louis Vuitton during Paris Fashion Week. The line was released in summer 2009. West has additionally designed shoewear for Italian shoemaker Giuseppe Zanotti.

In fall 2009, West moved to Rome, where he interned at Italian fashion brand Fendi, giving ideas for the men&#x27;s collection. In March 2011, West collaborated with M/M Paris for a series of silk scarves featuring artwork from &quot;My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy&quot;. In October 2011, West premiered his women&#x27;s fashion label at Paris Fashion Week. His debut fashion show received mixed-to-negative reviews. In March 2012, West premiered a second fashion line at Paris Fashion Week. Critics deemed the sophomore effort &quot;much improved&quot; compared to his first show.

On December 3, 2013, Adidas officially confirmed a new shoe collaboration deal with West. After months of anticipation and rumors, West confirmed the release of the Adidas Yeezy Boosts. In 2015, West unveiled a Yeezy clothing line, premiering in collaboration with Adidas early that year. In June 2016, Adidas announced a new long-term contract with Kanye West that extended the Yeezy line to a number of stores, planning to sell sports performance products like basketball, football, and soccer, although Adidas terminated the partnership with West in October 2022 due to his antisemitic remarks. In May 2021, West signed a 10-year deal linking Yeezy with GAP to create Yeezy Gap, however, in September 2022, West announced that he was ending the deal.

=== Business ventures ===
West founded the record label and production company GOOD Music in 2004, in conjunction with Sony BMG, shortly after releasing his debut album, &quot;The College Dropout&quot;. West, alongside then-unknown Ohio singer John Legend and fellow Chicago rapper Common were the label&#x27;s inaugural artists. The label houses artists including West, Big Sean, Pusha T, Teyana Taylor, Yasiin Bey / Mos Def, D&#x27;banj and John Legend, and producers including Hudson Mohawke, Q-Tip, Travis Scott, No I.D., Jeff Bhasker, and S1. GOOD Music has released ten albums certified gold or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In November 2015, West appointed Pusha T the new president of GOOD Music.

In August 2008, West revealed plans to open 10 Fatburger restaurants in the Chicago area after his company, KW Foods LLC, bought the rights to the chain in Chicago. The first location opened in September 2008 in Orland Park and a second followed in January 2009. The Orland Park location closed in early 2011 due to poor sales performance.

In January 2012, West announced his establishment of the creative content company Donda, named after his late mother. In his announcement, West proclaimed that the company would &quot;pick up where Steve Jobs left off&quot;; Donda would operate as a &quot;design company&quot; with a goal to &quot;make products and experiences that people want and can afford&quot;. In stating Donda&#x27;s creative philosophy, West articulated the need to &quot;put creatives in a room together with like minds&quot; in order to &quot;simplify and aesthetically improve everything we see, taste, touch, and feel&quot;. West is notoriously secretive about the company&#x27;s operations, maintaining neither an official website nor a social media presence. Contemporary critics have noted the consistent minimalistic aesthetic exhibited throughout Donda creative projects.

West expressed interest in starting an architecture firm in May 2013, saying &quot;I want to do product, I am a product person, not just clothing but water bottle design, architecture... I make music but I shouldn&#x27;t be limited to one place of creativity&quot; and then later in November 2013, delivering a manifesto on his architectural goals during a visit to Harvard Graduate School of Design. In May 2018, West announced he was starting an architecture firm called Yeezy Home, which will act as an arm of his already successful Yeezy fashion label. In June 2018, the first Yeezy Home collaboration was announced by designer Jalil Peraza, teasing an affordable concrete prefabricated home as part of a social housing project.

In March 2015, it was announced that West is a co-owner, with various other music artists, in the music streaming service Tidal. The service specialises in lossless audio and high definition music videos. Jay-Z acquired the parent company of Tidal, Aspiro, in the first quarter of 2015. Sixteen artist stakeholders including Jay-Z, Rihanna, Beyoncé, Madonna, Chris Martin, Nicki Minaj co-own Tidal, with the majority owning a 3% equity stake. In October 2022, in direct response to bans he received on Twitter and Instagram stemming from his antisemitic comments, West reached an agreement in principle to acquire the alt-tech social network Parler for an undisclosed amount. Parler and West mutually agreed to terminate the proposed deal in mid-November.

=== Philanthropy ===
West, alongside his mother, founded the Kanye West Foundation in Chicago in 2003, tasked with a mission to battle dropout and illiteracy rates, while partnering with community organizations to provide underprivileged youth access to music education. In 2007, West and the Foundation partnered with Strong American Schools as part of their &quot;Ed in &#x27;08&quot; campaign. As spokesman for the campaign, West appeared in a series of PSAs for the organization, and hosted an inaugural benefit concert in August of that year. In 2008, following the death of West&#x27;s mother, the foundation was rechristened The Dr. Donda West Foundation. The foundation ceased operations in 2011. In 2013, Kanye West and friend Rhymefest founded Donda&#x27;s House, Inc., a program aimed at helping at-risk Chicago youth.

West has contributed to hurricane relief in 2005 by participating in a Hurricane Katrina benefit concert after the storm had ravaged black communities in New Orleans and in 2012 when he performed at a Hurricane Sandy benefit concert. In January 2019, West donated $10 million towards the completion of the Roden Crater by American artist James Turrell. In June 2020, in the wake of the murder of George Floyd and the following protests, he donated $2million between the family of Floyd and other victims of police brutality, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. The donation funded legal fees for Arbery and Taylor&#x27;s families, as well as establishing a 529 plan to fully cover college tuition for Floyd&#x27;s daughter.

=== Acting and filmmaking ===
West made cameo appearances as himself in the films &quot;State Property 2&quot; (2005) and &quot;The Love Guru&quot; (2008), and in an episode of the television show &quot;Entourage&quot; in 2007. West provided the voice for &quot;Kenny West&quot;, a rapper, in the animated sitcom &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot; (2010–2012). In 2009, he starred in the Spike Jonze-directed short film &quot;We Were Once a Fairytale&quot; (2009), playing himself acting belligerently while drunk in a nightclub. West wrote, directed, and starred in the musical short film &quot;Runaway&quot; (2010), which heavily features music from &quot;My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy&quot;. The film depicts a relationship between a man, played by West, and a half-woman, half-phoenix creature.

In 2012, West co-directed another short film, along with Alexandre Moors, titled &quot;Cruel Summer&quot;, which premiered at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival in a custom pyramid-shaped screening pavilion featuring seven screens constructed for the film. The film was meant to tie in with the compilation album of the same name to be released later that year. West made a cameo appearance in the comedy &quot;Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues&quot; (2013) as a MTV News representative in the film&#x27;s fight scene. In September 2018, West announced the starting of a film production company named Half Beast, LLC. A documentary shot over 21 years featuring footage of West&#x27;s early days in Chicago through the death of his mother to his presidential run was announced to debut in 2021. Titled &quot;Jeen-Yuhs&quot;, it was acquired by Netflix for $30 million and released in 2022.

A documentary shot over six years with a billion-dollar budget was announced to debut in 2024. Titled &quot;In Whose Name?&quot;, it was directed by Nico Ballesteros and will be released in 2025.

=== Presidential campaigns ===
==== 2020 ====
On July 4, 2020, West announced on Twitter that he would be running in the 2020 presidential election. On July 7, West was interviewed by &quot;Forbes&quot; about his presidential run, where he announced that his running mate would be Wyoming preacher Michelle Tidball, and that he would run as an independent under the &quot;Birthday Party&quot;, explaining his decision of why he chose the name, saying, &quot;Because when we win, it&#x27;s everybody&#x27;s &#x27;birthday&#x27;.&quot; West also said he no longer supported Trump because he &quot;hid in [a] bunker&quot; during the COVID-19 pandemic. Continuing, he said, &quot;You know? Obama&#x27;s special. Trump&#x27;s special. We say Kanye West is special. America needs special people that lead. Bill Clinton? Special. Joe Biden&#x27;s not special.&quot;

Various political pundits speculated that West&#x27;s presidential run was a publicity stunt to promote his latest music releases. On July 15, 2020, official paperwork was filed with the Federal Election Commission for West, under the &quot;BDY&quot; Party affiliation amid claims that he was preparing to drop out. West held his first rally that weekend, on July 19. West aligned himself with the philosophy of a consistent life ethic, a tenet of Christian democracy. His platform advocated for the creation of a culture of life, endorsing environmental stewardship, supporting the arts, buttressing faith-based organizations, restoring school prayer, providing for a strong national defense, and &quot;America First&quot; diplomacy. In July 2020, West told &quot;Forbes&quot; that he is ignorant on issues such as taxes and foreign policy.

West conceded on Twitter on November 4, 2020. He received 66,365 votes in the 12 states he had ballot access in, receiving an average of 0.32%. Reported write-in votes gave West an additional 3,931 votes across 5 states. In addition, the &quot;Roque De La Fuente / Kanye West&quot; ticket won 60,160 votes in California (0.34%). According to &quot;Reuters&quot;, on January 4, 2021, a Kanye West-linked publicist pressured a Georgia election worker to confess to bogus charges of election tampering to assist Trump&#x27;s claims of election interference. In December 2021, &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; reported that West&#x27;s presidential campaign received millions of dollars in services from a secret network of Republican operatives, payments to which the committee did not report. According to campaign finance experts, this was done to conceal a connection.

==== 2024 ====
West stated his intention to run for president again in the 2024 presidential election, saying at a November 2019 event, &quot;When I run for president in 2024, we would&#x27;ve created so many jobs that I&#x27;m not going to run, I&#x27;m going to walk.&quot; He was met with laughter from the audience. In response to a request for additional information from the Federal Election Commission regarding the creation of a presidential exploratory committee, West&#x27;s representatives emphasized that he &quot;has not decided whether to become a candidate for president in the 2024 election&quot; and refused to file additional paperwork with the commission. West officially launched his presidential campaign in November 2022. West claimed to have asked former president Donald Trump to be his running mate; according to West, Trump was &quot;caught [...] off-guard&quot; by the request and warned him of losing if he decided to run. In October 2023, an attorney for West said that he &quot;is not a candidate for office in 2024&quot;.

==Views==

West has been an outspoken and controversial celebrity throughout his career, receiving criticism from the mainstream media, industry colleagues and entertainers, and three U.S. presidents. In a 2005 speech, West criticized both the media and the government&#x27;s racial disparities in their response to Hurricane Katrina, stating on live television &quot;George Bush doesn&#x27;t care about black people&quot;. He apologized for the comment in 2010, saying he &quot;didn&#x27;t have the grounds to call [Bush] a racist&quot; and later stated in regard to the remark that he &quot;was programmed to think from a victimized mentality&quot;. West voiced his opposition to abortion in 2013, citing his belief in the Sixth Commandment, and in 2022 deemed abortion &quot;genocide and population control&quot; of black people. In 2018, West stated that the 400-year enslavement of Africans &quot;sounds like a choice&quot;, before elaborating that his comment was in reference to mental enslavement and argued for free thought. He later apologized for the comment.

In late 2022, West made a series of antisemitic statements, resulting in the termination of his collaborations, sponsorships, and partnerships with &quot;Vogue&quot;, Universal Music Group, CAA, Balenciaga, Gap, and Adidas. West was widely condemned after appearing at a dinner hosted by Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago beside Nick Fuentes, a white nationalist. In a subsequent December appearance on Alex Jones&#x27;s &quot;InfoWars&quot;, West praised Adolf Hitler, denied the Holocaust, and identified himself as a Nazi. After the interview, West used his Twitter account to post a picture of a swastika entangled in a Star of David, and his account was terminated. In July 2023, Twitter reversed the ban, citing assurances from West that he would not post harmful content. According to a 2023 report published by the Anti-Defamation League, West&#x27;s antisemitic rhetoric has caused several instances of hate-speech vandalism, harassment, and violence across the United States. In December 2023, weeks before the release of his upcoming album, West apologized for his antisemitic remarks in a written statement on Instagram. In a subsequent interview, he said &quot;[s]ome of the stuff I was saying was true&quot; and that Black people cannot be antisemitic because they &quot;are Jew&quot;. In February 2025, he went on an anti-Semitic rant on X, professing his love for Hitler, and purchased local advertising during Super Bowl LIX which directed viewers to his website, where he was selling a swastika t-shirt. He also defended Sean Combs from sexual abuse allegations.

== Personal life ==
West has been one of the wealthiest musical artists; his net worth was as high as $1.8 billion in 2021. In October 2022, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated his net worth to have dropped to $400 million in large part due to Adidas&#x27;s termination of their partnership following a series of public antisemitic statements.

=== Name change ===
In August 2021, West applied to court to have his legal name changed from &quot;Kanye Omari West&quot; to &quot;Ye&quot;, with no middle or last name; he cited &quot;personal reasons&quot; for the change. The request was granted by Michelle Williams Court, a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge, in October 2021. West had alluded to wishing to change his name since 2018 and had used Ye as a nickname for several years prior, stating in a 2018 interview that he believed &quot;ye&quot; () was the most commonly used word in the Bible: &quot;In the Bible it means &#x27;you&#x27;. So, I&#x27;m you. I&#x27;m us. It&#x27;s us. It went from being Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye.&quot;

=== Relationships and family ===
====Kim Kardashian====
In April 2012, West began dating reality television star Kim Kardashian, with whom he had already been long-time friends. West and Kardashian became engaged in October 2013, and married at Fort di Belvedere in Florence in May 2014. Their private ceremony was subject to widespread mainstream coverage, with which West took issue. The couple&#x27;s high-profile status and respective careers have resulted in their relationship becoming subject to heavy media coverage; &quot;The New York Times&quot; referred to their marriage as &quot;a historic blizzard of celebrity&quot;.

West and Kardashian have four children: North West (born June 2013), Saint West (born December 2015), Chicago West (born via surrogate in January 2018), and Psalm West (born via surrogate in May 2019). In July 2020, during a presidential campaign rally of his, West revealed that he had previously considered abortion during Kardashian&#x27;s first pregnancy but has since taken anti-abortion views. In April 2015, West and Kardashian traveled to Jerusalem to have North baptized in the Armenian Apostolic Church at the Cathedral of St. James.

In September 2018, West announced that he would be permanently moving back to Chicago to establish his Yeezy company headquarters there. This did not actually occur, and West instead went on to purchase two ranches near Cody, Wyoming, where he recorded his eighth solo studio album, &quot;Ye&quot;. Kardashian resides with their children in a home that the now-divorced couple owns in California, whereas West moved into a home across the street to continue to be near their children. In October 2021, West began the process of selling his Wyoming ranch.

In July 2020, West acknowledged the possibility of Kardashian ending their marriage due to his adoption of anti-abortion views. Later that month, West wrote on Twitter that he had been attempting to divorce Kardashian. He also wrote that the Kardashian family was attempting &quot;to lock [him] up&quot;. In January 2021, CNN reported that the couple were discussing divorce. A month later, Kardashian filed for divorce, with the couple citing &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot;, agreeing to joint custody of their children, and declining spousal support from each other. The divorce settlement was finalized in November 2022, and West was ordered to pay $200,000 in monthly child support and be responsible for half of the children&#x27;s medical, educational, and security expenses.

====Other relationships====
West began an on-and-off relationship with the designer Alexis Phifer in 2002, and they became engaged in August 2006. They ended their 18-month engagement in 2008. Phifer stated that the pair had split amicably and remained friends. West dated model Amber Rose from 2008 until mid-2010. In an interview following their split, West stated that he had to take &quot;30 showers&quot; before committing to his next relationship with Kim Kardashian. In response, Rose stated that she had been &quot;bullied&quot; and &quot;slut-shamed&quot; by West throughout their relationship.

In January 2022, actress Julia Fox confirmed in an &quot;Interview&quot; essay that she was dating West. West continued to say that he wanted his &quot;family back&quot; and publicly lashed out at Kardashian&#x27;s new boyfriend, comedian Pete Davidson. His treatment of Davidson and Kardashian has been described by commentators as harassment and abusive; the 64th Annual Grammy Awards dropped him as a performer in response to his &quot;concerning online behavior&quot;. Less than two months after confirming their relationship, Fox said that she and West had split up but remained on good terms. She later said that she dated West purely to &quot;give people something to talk about&quot; during the COVID-19 pandemic and to &quot;get him off Kim&#x27;s case&quot;.

In January 2023, it was reported that West had informally married Australian architect Bianca Censori, who works for West&#x27;s Yeezy brand, in a private ceremony in Beverly Hills. The ceremony had no legal standing; the couple did not file for a marriage license. In response to West&#x27;s subsequent trips to Australia to visit Censori&#x27;s family, Australian Minister for Education Jason Clare commented that West may be denied a visa due to his recent antisemitic remarks. The Executive Council of Australian Jewry and the Anti-Defamation Commission further argued against granting West entry.

=== Legal problems ===

He has been accused of the extensive use of uncleared samples in his music, leading to numerous lawsuits. In December 2006, Robert &quot;Evel&quot; Knievel sued the rapper for trademark infringement of his name and likeness in West&#x27;s video for &quot;Touch the Sky&quot;. Knievel took issue with the &quot;vulgar and offensive&quot; and &quot;sexually charged video&quot; in which West takes on the persona of &quot;Evel Kanyevel&quot; that Knievel claimed damaged his reputation. The suit sought monetary damages and an injunction to stop distribution of the video. West&#x27;s attorneys argued that the music video amounted to satire and therefore was covered under the First Amendment. Days before his death in November 2007, Knievel amicably settled the suit after being paid a visit by West, saying, &quot;I thought he was a wonderful guy and quite a gentleman.&quot;

In 2014, after an altercation with a paparazzo at the Los Angeles Airport, West was sentenced to serve two years&#x27; probation for a misdemeanor battery conviction, and was required to attend 24 anger management sessions, perform 250 hours of community service, and pay restitution to the photographer. A separate civil lawsuit brought by the paparazzo was settled in 2015, a week before it was due for trial. According to TMZ, an appeal to have West&#x27;s conviction expunged from his criminal record was granted by a judge in 2016.
On June 29, 2022, a complaint was filed in U.S. District Court in New York claiming copyright infringement due to unauthorized use of a sample on the song &quot;Flowers&quot;. The complaint claims that West sampled Marshall Jefferson&#x27;s 1986 house track &quot;Move Your Body&quot; without gaining permission or providing compensation. In July 2022, West was sued for $416,000 by the fashion rental company the David Casavant Archive. The lawsuit claimed that West had failed to make payments on and return 13 rented pieces.

West was sued for wrongful termination, sexual harassment, and breach of contract by a former assistant in 2024. West denied the allegation. That same year, he was sued by a former model for sexual assault and strangulation. In the lawsuit, she claims that during a music video set, West choked and gagged her in the mouth.

=== Religious beliefs ===
After the success of his song &quot;Jesus Walks&quot; from the album &quot;The College Dropout&quot;, West was asked about his beliefs and said, &quot;I will say that I&#x27;m spiritual. I have accepted Jesus as my Savior. And I will say that I fall short every day.&quot; In a 2008 interview with &quot;The Fader&quot;, West stated that &quot;I&#x27;m like a vessel, and God has chosen me to be the voice and the connector&quot;. In a 2009 interview with online magazine Bossip, West stated that he believed in God, but at the time felt that he &quot;would never go into a religion&quot;. In 2014, West referred to himself as a Christian during one of his concerts. Kim Kardashian stated in September 2019: &quot;He has had an amazing evolution of being born again and being saved by Christ.&quot; In October 2019, West said with respect to his past, &quot;When I was trying to serve multiple gods it drove me crazy&quot; in reference to the &quot;god of ego, god of money, god of pride, the god of fame&quot;, and that &quot;I didn&#x27;t even know what it meant to be saved&quot; and that now &quot;I love Jesus Christ. I love Christianity.&quot;

===Politics===

In September 2012, West donated $1,000 to Barack Obama&#x27;s re-election campaign, and in August 2015 he donated $2,700 to Hillary Clinton&#x27;s 2016 campaign. He also donated $15,000 to the Democratic National Committee in October 2014. In December 2016, West met with President-elect Donald Trump to discuss bullying, supporting teachers, modernizing curriculums, and violence in Chicago. West subsequently stated he would have voted for Trump had he voted. In February 2017, however, West deleted all his tweets about Trump in purported dislike of the new president&#x27;s policies, particularly the travel ban. West reiterated his support for Donald Trump in April 2018. In October 2018, West donated to progressive Chicago mayoral candidate Amara Enyia.

On June 29, 2024, he arrived in Moscow, Russia, to celebrate the 40th birthday of Russian fashion designer Gosha Rubchinskiy. West was labeled an &quot;enemy of Ukraine&quot; after his trip to Moscow.

=== Mental health ===
On November 19, 2016, West abruptly ended a concert before being committed at the recommendation of authorities to the UCLA Medical Center with hallucinations and paranoia. While the episode was first described as one of &quot;temporary psychosis&quot; caused by dehydration and sleep deprivation, West&#x27;s mental state was abnormal enough for his 21 cancelled concerts to be covered by his insurance policy. He was reportedly paranoid and depressed throughout the hospitalization, but remained formally undiagnosed. Some have speculated that the Paris robbery of his wife may have triggered the paranoia. On November 30, West was released from the hospital.

In his song &quot;FML&quot; and his featured verse on Vic Mensa&#x27;s song &quot;U Mad&quot;, he refers to using the antidepressant medication Lexapro, and in his unreleased song &quot;I Feel Like That&quot;, he mentions feeling many common symptoms of depression and anxiety. In a 2018 interview, West said that he had become addicted to opioids when they were prescribed to him after liposuction. The addiction may have contributed to his nervous breakdown in 2016. In addition to his opioid addiction, West has stated that he has had addictions to alcohol, sex, and pornography. West said that he often has suicidal ideation. West was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2016, though his diagnosis was not made public until his 2018 album &quot;Ye.&quot; He told President Donald Trump that it was a misdiagnosis. He had reportedly accepted the diagnosis again by 2019, but again suggested that it had been a misdiagnosis in 2022. In December 2022, he suggested that he may be autistic, and later said in February 2025 that he had received a professional diagnosis.

In August 2024, West&#x27;s former Chief of Staff Milo Yiannopoulos stated in an affidavit filed to the California Dental Board that West was addicted to nitrous oxide. He alleged that dentist Thomas Connelly, who installed permanent titanium prosthodontics for West in January 2024, had moved into West&#x27;s apartment building and was charging him $50,000 a month to supply the drugs.

== Musical impact ==
West is among the most critically acclaimed popular music artists of the 21st century, earning praise from music critics, industry peers, and cultural figures. In 2014, &quot;NME&quot; named him the third most influential artist in music. &quot;Billboard&quot; senior editor Alex Gale declared West &quot;absolutely one of the best, and you could make the argument for the best artist of the 21st century.&quot; Sharing similar sentiments, Dave Bry of &quot;Complex Magazine&quot; called West the twenty-first century&#x27;s &quot;most important artist of any art form, of any genre.&quot; &quot;The Atlantic&quot; writer David Samuels commented, &quot;Kanye&#x27;s power resides in his wild creativity and expressiveness, his mastery of form, and his deep and uncompromising attachment to a self-made aesthetic that he expresses through means that are entirely of the moment: rap music, digital downloads, fashion, Twitter, blogs, live streaming video.&quot; Joe Muggs of &quot;The Guardian&quot; argued that &quot;there is nobody else who can sell as many records as West does [...] while remaining so resolutely experimental and capable of stirring things up culturally and politically.&quot;

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; credited West with transforming hip-hop&#x27;s mainstream, &quot;establishing a style of introspective yet glossy rap&quot; while deeming him &quot;a producer who created a signature sound and then abandoned it to his imitators, a flashy, free-spending sybarite with insightful things to say about college, culture, and economics, an egomaniac with more than enough artistic firepower to back it up.&quot; Writing for &quot;Highsnobiety&quot;, Shahzaib Hussain stated that West&#x27;s first three albums &quot;cemented his role as a progressive rap progenitor&quot;. &quot;AllMusic&quot; editor Jason Birchmeier described West as &quot;[shattering] certain stereotypes about rappers, becoming a superstar on his own terms without adapting his appearance, his rhetoric, or his music to fit any one musical mold&quot;. Lawrence Burney of &quot;Noisey&quot; has credited West with the commercial decline of the gangsta rap genre that once dominated mainstream hip-hop. The release of his third studio album has been described as a turning point in the music industry, and is considered to have helped pave the way for new rappers who did not follow the hardcore-gangster mold to find wider mainstream acceptance.

Hip-hop artists like Drake, Nicki Minaj, Travis Scott, Playboi Carti, Lil Uzi Vert, and Chance the Rapper have acknowledged being influenced by West. Several other artists and music groups of various genres have named West as an influence on their work. 

== Awards and achievements ==

West is the fourth-highest certified artist in the U.S. by digital singles (69 million). He had the most RIAA digital song certifications by a male artist in the 2000s (19), and was the fourth best-selling digital songs artist of the 2000s in the U.S. In Spotify&#x27;s first ten years from 2008 to 2018, West was the sixth most streamed artist, and the fourth fastest artist to reach one billion streams. West has the joint-most consecutive studio album to debut at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 (9) and was the first rapper to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in three distinct decades (2000s, 2010s, 2020s). He ranked third on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s 2000s decade-end list of top producers and has topped the annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll the joint-most times (four albums) with Bob Dylan.

West has been nominated for 75 Grammys, out of which he has won 24. He has been the most nominated act at five ceremonies, and has received the fourth-most wins overall in the 2000s. In 2008, West became the first solo artist to have his first three albums receive nominations for Album of the Year. West has won a Webby Award for Artist of the Year, an Accessories Council Excellence Award for being a stylemaker, International Man of the Year at the &quot;GQ Awards&quot;, a Clio Award for &quot;The Life of Pablo Album&quot; Experience, and an honour by The Recording Academy. West is one of eight acts to have won the Billboard Artist Achievement Award. In 2015, he became the third rap act to win the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award.

West&#x27;s first six solo studio albums were included on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2020 list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named &quot;The College Dropout&quot; the best album of the 2000s, &quot;Complex&quot; named &quot;Graduation&quot; the best album released between 2002 and 2012, &quot;808s &amp; Heartbreak&quot; was named by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as one of the 40 most groundbreaking albums of all time, &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; named &quot;My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy&quot; the best album of the 2010s, &quot;Yeezus&quot; was the most critically acclaimed album of 2013 according to Metacritic, and &quot;The Life of Pablo&quot; was the first album to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, go platinum in the U.S., and go gold in the UK, via streaming alone.

<doc id="523033" wikidata="Q3097311" url="?curid=523033" title="List of recessions in the United States">
<text>There have been as many as 48 recessions in the United States dating back to the Articles of Confederation, and although economists and historians dispute certain 19th-century recessions, the consensus view among economists and historians is that &quot;the [cyclical] volatility of GNP and unemployment was greater before the Great Depression than it has been since the end of World War II.&quot; Cycles in the country&#x27;s agricultural production, industrial production, consumption, business investment, and the health of the banking industry contribute to these declines. U.S. recessions have increasingly affected economies on a worldwide scale, especially as countries&#x27; economies become more intertwined.

The unofficial beginning and ending dates of recessions in the United States have been defined by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), an American private nonprofit research organization. The NBER defines a recession as &quot;a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than two quarters which is 6 months, normally visible in real gross domestic product (GDP), real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales&quot;.

In the 19th century, recessions frequently coincided with a financial crisis. Determining the occurrence of pre-20th-century recessions is more difficult due to the dearth of economic statistics, so scholars rely on historical accounts of economic activity, such as contemporary newspapers or business ledgers. Although the NBER does not date recessions before 1857, economists customarily extrapolate dates of U.S. recessions back to 1790 from business annals based on various contemporary descriptions. Their work is aided by historical patterns, in that recessions often follow external shocks to the economic system such as wars and variations in the weather affecting agriculture, as well as banking crises.

Major modern economic statistics, such as unemployment and GDP, were not compiled on a regular and standardized basis until after World War II. The average duration of the 11 recessions between 1945 and 2001 is 10 months, compared to 18 months for recessions between 1919 and 1945, and 22 months for recessions from 1854 to 1919. Because of the great changes in the economy over the centuries, it is difficult to compare the severity of modern recessions to early recessions. Before the COVID-19 recession began in March 2020, no post-World War II era had come anywhere near the depth of the Great Depression, which lasted from 1929 until 1941 (which included a bull market between 1933 and 1937) and was caused by the 1929 crash of the stock market and other factors.

==Early recessions and crises (1785–1836)==
Attempts have been made to date recessions in America beginning in 1790. These periods of recession were not identified until the 1920s. To construct the dates, researchers studied business annals during the period and constructed time series of the data. The earliest recessions for which there is the most certainty are those that coincide with major financial crises.

Beginning in 1835, an index of business activity by the Cleveland Trust Company provides data for comparison between recessions. Beginning in 1854, the National Bureau of Economic Research dates recession peaks and troughs to the month. However, a standardized index does not exist for the earliest recessions.

In 1791, Congress chartered the First Bank of the United States to handle the country&#x27;s financial needs. The bank had some functions of a modern central bank, although it was responsible for only 20% of the young country&#x27;s currency. In 1811 the bank&#x27;s charter lapsed, but it was replaced by the Second Bank of the United States, which lasted from 1816 to 1836.

==Free Banking Era to the Great Depression (1836–1929)==

In the 1830s, U.S. President Andrew Jackson fought to end the Second Bank of the United States. Following the Bank War, the Second Bank lost its charter in 1836. From 1837 to 1862, there was no national presence in banking, but still plenty of state and even local regulation, such as laws against branch banking which prevented diversification. In 1863, in response to financing pressures of the Civil War, Congress passed the National Banking Act, creating nationally chartered banks. Since there was neither a central bank nor deposit insurance during this era, banking panics were common.

The dating of recessions during this period is controversial. Modern economic statistics, such as gross domestic product and unemployment, were not gathered during this period: Victor Zarnowitz evaluated a variety of indices to measure the severity of these recessions. 

From 1834 to 1929, one measure of recessions is the Cleveland Trust Company index, which measured business activity and, beginning in 1882, an index of trade and industrial activity was available, which can be used to compare recessions.
==Great Depression onward (1929–present)==

Following the end of World War II and the large adjustment as the economy adjusted from wartime to peacetime in 1945, the collection of many economic indicators, such as unemployment and GDP, became standardized. Recessions after World War II may be compared to each other much more easily than previous recessions because of these available data. The listed dates and durations are from the official chronology of the National Bureau of Economic Research. GDP data are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, unemployment from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (after 1948). The unemployment rate often reaches a peak associated with a recession after the recession has officially ended.

Until the start of the COVID-19 recession in 2020, no post-World War II era came anywhere near the depth of the Great Depression. In the Great Depression, GDP fell by 27% (the deepest after demobilization is the recession beginning in December 2007, during which GDP had fallen 5.1% by the second quarter of 2009) and the unemployment rate reached 24.9% (the highest since was the 10.8% rate reached during the 1981–1982 recession).

The National Bureau of Economic Research dates recessions on a monthly basis back to 1854; according to their chronology, from 1854 to 1919, there were 16 cycles. The average recession lasted 22 months, and the average expansion 27. From 1919 to 1945, there were six cycles; recessions lasted an average 18 months and expansions for 35. From 1945 to 2001, and 10 cycles, recessions lasted an average 10 months and expansions an average of 57 months. This has prompted some economists to declare that the business cycle has become less severe.

Many factors that may have contributed to this moderation including the establishment of deposit insurance in the form of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1933 and increased regulation of the banking sector. Other changes include the use of fiscal policy in the form of automatic stabilizers to alleviate cyclical volatility. The creation of the Federal Reserve System in 1913 has been disputed as a source of stability with it and its policies having mixed successes. Since the early 1980s the sources of the Great Moderation has been attributed to numerous causes including public policy, industry practices, technology, and even good luck.

<text>The Sweetwater River is a long tributary of the North Platte River, in the U.S. state of Wyoming. As a part of the Mississippi River system, its waters eventually reach the Gulf of Mexico.

==Course==
The Sweetwater rises in southwestern Fremont County, at the continental divide near South Pass Wyoming, on the southern end of the Wind River Range. It flows ENE along the north side of the Antelope Hills, then ESE, through Fremont County, past Jeffrey City, between the Granite Mountains to the north and the Green Mountains (Wyoming) to the south, through what are now cattle-raising areas. In southern Natrona County, it passes Devil&#x27;s Gate and Independence Rock along the Oregon, California and Mormon Trails, and empties into the North Platte as the Sweetwater arm of Pathfinder Reservoir.

==History==
The Sweetwater River valley provided a route used by fur trappers, mountain men and fur traders as they went to their annual summertime Rocky Mountain Rendezvous located usually somewhere along the Green River Wyoming. These trappers and traders soon established a path for their pack trains along the Sweetwater and eventually cleared a rough wagon trail to the Green River.

In fall of 1823, trappers and fur traders Jedediah Smith and Thomas Fitzpatrick led their trapping crew south from the Yellowstone River to the Sweetwater River. They were looking for a safe location to spend the winter. Smith reasoned since the Sweetwater flowed east it must eventually run into the Missouri River. Trying to transport their extensive fur collection down the Sweetwater and North Platte River, they found after a near disastrous canoe crash that the rivers in Wyoming were too swift and rough for water passage. On July 4, 1824, they cached their furs under a dome of rock they named Independence Rock and started their long trek on foot to the Missouri River via the Sweetwater, North Platte and Platte River valleys. Upon arriving back in a settled area on the Missouri River they bought pack horses (on credit) and retrieved their furs. They had re-discovered the route that Robert Stuart of the Astor Expedition had taken in 1813—eleven years before. Thomas Fitzpatrick was often hired as a trail guide when the fur trade almost ceased in 1840. Jedediah Smith was killed by Indians about 1831.

By 1843 the Sweetwater River valley was a regular wagon trail providing the water, grass and fuel needed on the Oregon, California and Mormon Trails across Wyoming. The Sweetwater provided an almost direct path from the Platte and North Platte Rivers to the wide South Pass Continental Divide between the Atlantic Ocean rivers and Pacific Ocean rivers. South Pass was the easiest pass across the Atlantic and Pacific drainages. These wagon trails crossed the meandering Sweetwater River about nine times on their about 10 to 20 day trips along the Sweetwater River before they reached South Pass. The Sweetwater River&#x27;s connection to the California Trail is of particular interest to members of the Fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta, since it is a site where two early members met, including one of the fraternity&#x27;s six founders. At a time when such a meeting was incredibly unlikely, the coincidence was so fortuitous as to be chronicled in the fraternity&#x27;s history.

<text>Bad Boy&#x27;s Da Band was an American hip hop group put together by Sean &quot;P. Diddy&quot; Combs and signed to his label, Bad Boy Entertainment. The group&#x27;s formation was documented for three seasons of MTV&#x27;s reality television series, &quot;Making the Band 2&quot;.

== Career ==
During the preliminary period, 40,000 participants auditioned for a place in the group but Diddy narrowed it down to six artists. For several weeks the group was subjected to vigorous and sometimes demeaning tasks, including walking from midtown Manhattan to Brooklyn to purchase a Junior&#x27;s cheesecake for Diddy, and Ness&#x27;s battle with the Harlem rapper Jae Millz. Their first album, &quot;Too Hot for TV&quot;, was released in September 2003.

=== After Da Band ===
On the season three finale, the group effectively ended when Diddy dissolved them and chose to keep Ness and Babs. Though not chosen to be kept on the season three finale, Diddy later brought Chopper &quot;Young City&quot; back on the label. Ness and Babs were to be a duo and Chopper was to be a solo artist on Bad Boy South. Chopper eventually left the label and was followed by Babs some time later, leaving Ness the group&#x27;s only member still signed to Bad Boy. Ness has worked as a songwriter for Diddy on albums such as &quot;Press Play&quot; (2006). The group (minus Freddy P and Dylan, who was played by Chappelle and appeared via footage) parodied their experience during the filming of &quot;Making the Band 2&quot; on Dave Chappelle&#x27;s sketch comedy show &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot;. The group members have since been working on solo projects and have maintained good relationships with each other. Sara Rivers previously Sara Stokes has since been remarried to new husband Fashun Rivers and also now share a newborn together that goes by the moniker &quot;Baby&quot; Fashun. Sara is now very involved in her entrepreneurial endeavors with her company SaraFina Co. an apparel and skincare collection. Chopper and Ness were involved in a long-standing dispute but that seems to have been settled. According to Dylan in a 2014 interview, the group was talking about reuniting but Chopper is apparently not yet on board.

In 2022, it was revealed that Chopper was facing a felony sex trafficking charge in Las Vegas in an ongoing criminal investigation alleging that he used his large social media following to recruit women as prostitutes, according to police.

== Band members ==
* Sara Rivers (born June 1, 1977) – a Port Huron R&amp;B singer
* Dylan Dilinjah (born Dylan John on February 8, 1980) – a Brooklyn reggae vocalist
* Chopper &quot;Young City&quot; (born Kevin Barnes on January 12, 1987) – a rapper from the 3rd Ward of Uptown New Orleans, Louisiana

<doc id="523043" wikidata="Q531873" url="?curid=523043" title="Fallacy of composition">
<text>The fallacy of composition is an informal fallacy that arises when one infers that something is true of the whole from the fact that it is true of some part of the whole. A trivial example might be: &quot;This tire is made of rubber; therefore, the vehicle of which it is a part is also made of rubber.&quot; This is fallacious, because vehicles are made with a variety of parts, most of which are not made of rubber. The fallacy of composition can apply even when a fact is true of every proper part of a greater entity, though. A more complicated example might be: &quot;No atoms are alive. Therefore, nothing made of atoms is alive.&quot; This statement is incorrect, due to emergence, where the whole possesses properties not present in any of the parts.

This fallacy is related to the fallacy of hasty generalization, in which an unwarranted inference is made from a statement about a sample to a statement about the population from which it is drawn. The fallacy of composition is the converse of the fallacy of division.

==Examples==
*Bertrand Russell&#x27;s example in the Copleston–Russell debate: &quot;Every man who exists has a mother... therefore the human race must have a mother&quot;. This was intended to illustrate how cosmological arguments for God&#x27;s existence (specifically Frederick Copleston&#x27;s) commit the fallacy by assuming that the universe itself requires a cause or an explanation for its existence just because everything in the universe does.

*&quot;If someone stands up from their seat at a cricket match, they can see better. Therefore, if everyone stands up, they can all see better.&quot;

*&quot;Every brick in the wall is cube-shaped. Therefore, the whole wall is cube-shaped.&quot;

*&quot;Some people can become millionaires with the right business concept. Therefore, if everyone has the right business concept, everyone will become a millionaire.&quot;

*&quot;If a runner runs faster, that runner can win the race. Therefore, if all the runners run faster, they can all win the race.&quot;

*&quot;Since every part of a certain machine is light in weight, the machine as a whole is light in weight.&quot;
*In the economics of education, Bryan Caplan explains Credential inflation or degree inflation using the fallacy of composition: &quot;If one person gets a college degree, that person looks more appealing in the labor market. If everyone gets a college degree, everyone will look more appealing in the labor market.&quot; (The Case Against Education)

*In voting theory, the Condorcet paradox demonstrates a fallacy of composition: Even if all voters have rational preferences, the collective choice induced by majority rule is not transitive and hence not rational. The fallacy of composition occurs if from the rationality of the individuals one infers that society can be equally rational. The principle generalizes beyond the aggregation via majority rule to any reasonable aggregation rule, demonstrating that the aggregation of individual preferences into a social welfare function is fraught with severe difficulties (see Arrow&#x27;s impossibility theorem and social choice theory).

*In chemistry and materials science, a single type of atom may form allotropes with different physical properties from each other, and from their individual constituent atoms, such as diamond and graphite each consisting of carbon atoms. What is true of a single carbon atom is not true of a collection of carbon atoms bonded into a material. Furthermore, the properties of an atom differ from the properties of the individual subatomic particles that constitute it.

*In social network theory, a group of humans arranged into a social network can have abilities not possessed by the individual humans making up the network. A simple example is the bucket brigade, in which humans arranged into a chain can move buckets of water or other similar items across a distance faster and with less effort than can a disorganized group of individuals carrying the loads across the same distance. What is true of the part (an individual needing to move his or her body across the whole distance to move a load) is not true of the whole (in which individuals can move loads across the distance merely by standing in place and handing off the load to the next individual).

===In economics===
* The paradox of thrift is a notable fallacy of composition described by Keynesian economics.
* Division of labour is another economic example, in which overall productivity can greatly increase when individual workers specialize in doing different jobs. An individual worker may become more productive by specializing in making, say, hatpins, but by satisfying the wants of many other individuals for a given product, the specialist worker forces other workers to specialize in making different things. What is true for the part (earning more by investing in the skills or equipment to make a given product faster) is not true for the whole (because not everybody can profitably make the same product).
* In a tragedy of the commons, an individual can profit by consuming a larger share of a common, shared resource such as fish from the sea; but if too many individuals seek to consume more, they can destroy the resource.
* In the free rider problem, an individual can benefit by failing to pay when consuming a share of a public good; but if there are too many such &quot;free riders&quot;, eventually there will be no &quot;ride&quot; for anyone.

==&quot;Modo hoc&quot; fallacy==

The &quot;modo hoc&quot; (or &quot;just this&quot;) fallacy is the informal error of assessing meaning to an existent based on the constituent properties of its material makeup while omitting the matter&#x27;s arrangement. For instance, metaphysical naturalism states that while matter and motion are all that compose humans, it cannot be assumed that the characteristics inherent in the elements and physical reactions that make us up ultimately and solely define our meaning; for, a cow which is alive and well and a cow which has been chopped up into meat are the same matter but it is obvious that the &quot;arrangement&quot; of that matter clarifies those different situational meanings.

==See also==
* Association fallacy
* Interaction (statistics)
*Synecdoche, the figure of speech of two forms: 
**&quot;Pars pro toto&quot; using the word for a part by way of referring to the whole
**&quot;Totum pro parte&quot; using the word for the whole by way of referring to a part

<doc id="523045" wikidata="Q314532" url="?curid=523045" title="2004 German presidential election">
<text>An indirect presidential election (officially the 12th Federal Convention) was held in Germany on 23 May 2004.

The president of Germany (&quot;Bundespräsident&quot;) was the titular head of state of the Federal Republic of Germany. Germany is today often referred to as a &quot;chancellor democracy&quot;, reflecting the role of the chancellor as the country&#x27;s chief executive, and so consequently the president&#x27;s tasks are mostly ceremonial, but for the signing of all new federal laws before they go into effect. In practice however, all presidents have had informal influence on politics and society but mostly in a non-partisan way.

The president is not elected directly by the voters but by a special Federal Convention (Bundesversammlung) which is assembled every five years for this task alone, the exception being if the federal president’s term of office ends prematurely. This body consists of the members of the Bundestag and an equal number of members selected by the sixteen federal state parliaments.

The election date was set for 23 May in Berlin, the anniversary of the adoption of the German constitution. Of the 1,206 members only 549 belonged to the parties that controlled the federal government - the Social Democrats (SPD) and the German Green Party. Also in their camp were the 31 members of the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS). The opposition parties, the (Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU) and Free Democratic Party (FDP)), however, had a majority of 624 members because they commanded more seats in the federal states. One member belonged to a regional party; one was non-aligned.

Parties nominate candidates for the position, although the outcome of the election is very predictable because the members of the convention normally vote with strict party loyalty. As the majority of the opposition was not overwhelming (624 of 604 needed), &quot;dissident&quot; members could cause a surprise.

CDU/CSU and FDP nominated Horst Köhler, the head of the International Monetary Fund in Washington, D.C. Before that, he had been a senior official and was involved in negotiating both the German reunification treaty and the Maastricht Treaty on behalf of the German government. He is said to be rather modest but independently minded.

SPD and Greens had nominated Gesine Schwan, the head of the Viadrina European University in Frankfurt (Oder). She is a political scientist who also has been active for a long time in politics for the SPD - but has not always been in line with the party.

All eight preceding presidents had been men. Once in office, the president can be re-elected only once. The previous president Johannes Rau (SPD) cited personal reasons for his decision not to run for a second term and died in 2006.

Köhler won in the first voting round, receiving an immediate absolute majority of 604 (50.1%). Schwan won 589 votes, apparently attracting opposition voters.

<text>The Cathedral Church of St. Barnabas is a cathedral of the Roman Catholic Church in the city of Nottingham in Nottinghamshire, England. It is the mother church of the Diocese of Nottingham and seat of the Bishop of Nottingham. The cathedral is a grade-II* listed building.

==Location==
It is located on the corner of Derby Road and North Circus Street, on the opposite side of which are the Albert Hall and the Nottingham Playhouse (Wellington Circus).

==History==


It was built between 1841 and 1844, costing £15,000 (equivalent to £ in ), and was first consecrated in 1844, fifteen years after the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 ended most restrictions on Catholicism in the United Kingdom. A substantial amount of the cost was paid by the important Catholic Lord Shrewsbury. The architect was Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin who also designed the interior of The Houses of Parliament. It was built in the Early English Plain Gothic style, although in contrast, the Blessed Sacrament Chapel was richly decorated and Pugin&#x27;s later churches were built in that Decorated Gothic style throughout. Pugin was retained as architect by Rev Robert William Willson, then priest in charge of Nottingham. In 1842 he was named as Bishop-Elect of Hobart, Tasmania, and had to leave the work in Nottingham before completion.

Upon completion, the cathedral was the largest Catholic church built in England since the Reformation. Bishop Wiseman brought relics of St Barnabas from Rome to be included in the altar stone of the high altar.

Following the establishment of a new Catholic hierarchy in England and Wales in 1850 by the decree of Pope Pius IX, it was raised to cathedral status in 1852, becoming one of the first four Catholic cathedrals in England and Wales since the English Reformation. It is the seat of the Bishop of Nottingham.

The cathedral is a Grade II* listed building of the lancet style of architecture Most of Pugin&#x27;s decorative scheme was destroyed in the upheaval that surrounded the Second Vatican Council, when the old high altar was discarded, and most of the painted decoration smothered and painted plain. Other fittings removed at this time include the old cathedra, as well as the figures of St Mary and St John from the rood screen (the figures were reinstated in 1993). Buildings of England wrote: &#x27;The whole effect could hardly be further from the richness of decoration and atmosphere that Pugin intended&#x27;. A fragment of the scheme is preserved in the Blessed Sacrament chapel, and is the highlight of the interior. The replacement high altar from the 1960s was replaced again in 1993 with one in a more sympathetic style. Fragments of Pugin&#x27;s decoration, such as the roundels in the nave, were uncovered and restored, but most remains lost.

Another prominent feature of the cathedral is the tomb of Venerable Mary Potter, who founded the Little Company of Mary in Nottingham. The tomb was designed by Smith &amp; Roper.

In September 2022, it was announced that the cathedral was embarking on a project to restore some of the original planned designs by A W N Pugin. This will involve uncovering the whitewash which covers the original decoration of the Lady Chapel. The project is a joint enterprise between Nottingham Cathedral, Nottingham Trent University, and Culture Syndicates. It is being supported by a grant from the National Lottery Heritage Fund.

The clergy of the cathedral also serve the church of St. Augustine on Woodborough Road.

<text>George Packer (born August 13, 1960) is an American journalist, novelist, and playwright. He is best known for his writings about U.S. foreign policy for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and &quot;The Atlantic&quot; and for his book &quot;The Assassins&#x27; Gate: America in Iraq&quot;. Packer also wrote &quot;The Unwinding: An Inner History of the New America&quot;, covering the history of the US from 1978 to 2012. In November 2013, &quot;The Unwinding&quot; received the National Book Award for Nonfiction. His award-winning biography, &quot;Our Man: Richard Holbrooke and the End of the American Century&quot;, was released in May 2019. His latest book, &quot;Last Best Hope: America in Crisis and Renewal&quot;, was released in June 2021.

== Early life and education ==
Packer was born in California around 1960. His parents taught at Stanford University: his mother, Nancy Packer (née Huddleston), was a Wallace Stegner Fellow in the Creative Writing Program and later professor of English, and his father, Herbert L. Packer, was a distinguished professor of law, and the author of numerous books and articles. Packer&#x27;s maternal grandfather, George Huddleston, Sr., had served eleven successive terms (1915–1937) representing Alabama&#x27;s 9th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives. His uncle, George Huddleston, Jr., succeeded to his father&#x27;s seat in the House of Representatives from 1954 to 1964. Packer&#x27;s sister, Ann Packer, also is a writer. Their father&#x27;s background was Jewish and their mother&#x27;s Christian. In a 2022 talk for House of SpeakEasy&#x27;s &quot;Seriously Entertaining&quot; program, Packer shared that his father took his own life when he (Packer) was twelve years old, calling it &quot;the big event of my childhood.&quot;

Packer graduated from Yale University in 1982, where he resided at Calhoun College (now called Grace Hopper College). He served in the Peace Corps in Togo.

Packer is married to writer and editor Laura Secor. He was previously married to Michele Millon.

==Career==
His essays and articles have appeared in &quot;Boston Review&quot;, &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;World Affairs&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, among other publications. Packer was a columnist for &quot;Mother Jones&quot; and was a staff writer for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; from 2003 to 2018. He now writes for &quot;The Atlantic&quot;.

Packer was a Holtzbrinck Fellow Class of Fall 2009 at the American Academy in Berlin.

His 2005 book &quot;The Assassins&#x27; Gate: America in Iraq&quot; analyzes the events that led to the 2003 invasion of Iraq and reports on subsequent developments in that country, largely based on interviews with ordinary Iraqis. He was a supporter of the Iraq war. He was a finalist for the 2004 Michael Kelly Award.

In July 2013 the New Yorker Festival released a video entitled &quot;Geoffrey Canada on Giving Voice to the Have-nots&quot;, of a panel that was moderated by George Packer. Along with Canada, the panelists included Abhijit Banerjee, Katherine Boo, and Jose Antonio Vargas.

&quot;The Unwinding: An Inner History of the New America&quot; focuses on the ways that America changed in the years between 1978 and 2012. The book achieves this mainly by tracing the lives of various individuals from different backgrounds through the years. Interspersed are capsule biographies of influential figures of the time such as Colin Powell, Newt Gingrich, Elizabeth Warren, Jay-Z, and Raymond Carver.

In 2019, Packer released a book titled &quot;Our Man: Richard Holbrooke and the End of the American Century,&quot; a full-scale scholarly biography of Richard Holbrooke, one of the most influential U.S. diplomats of the late 20th Century. Our Man was a finalist for the 2020 Pulitzer Prize Finalist in Biography.

His 2021 book &quot;Last Best Hope: America in Crisis and Renewal&quot; describes the fragmentation of American society in recent decades into four mutually antagonistic &quot;four Americas&quot;: &quot;Free America&quot; (economically liberal), &quot;Smart America&quot; (educated, affluent and socially liberal), &quot;Real America&quot; (white rural precariat) and &quot;Just America&quot; (urban, progressive and economically disadvantaged).

<text>The white feather is a widely recognised propaganda symbol. It has, among other things, represented cowardice or conscientious pacifism; as in A. E. W. Mason&#x27;s 1902 book &quot;The Four Feathers&quot;. In Britain during the First World War it was often given to men out of uniform by women to shame them publicly into signing up. In the United States armed forces, however, it is used to signify extraordinary bravery and excellence in combat marksmanship.

==As a symbol of cowardice==
The use of the phrase &quot;white feather&quot; to symbolise cowardice is attested from the late 18th century, according to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;. The &quot;OED&quot; cites &quot;A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue&quot; (1785), in which lexicographer Francis Grose wrote &quot;White feather, he has a white feather, he is a coward, an allusion to a game cock, where having a white feather, is a proof he is not of the true game breed&quot;. This was in the context of cockfighting, a common entertainment in Georgian England.

=== The Crusades ===
Shame was exerted upon men in England and France who had not at the time of the Third Crusade. &quot;A great many men sent each other wool and distaff, hinting that if anyone failed to join this military undertaking they were only fit for women&#x27;s work&quot;. Wool played an important role in the medieval economy, and a distaff is a tool for spinning the raw material into yarn; the activities of textile production were so firmly associated with girls and women that &quot;distaff&quot; became a metonym for women&#x27;s work.

===World War I===

At the start of World War I, Admiral Charles Fitzgerald, who was a strong advocate of conscription, wanted to increase the number of those enlisting in the armed forces. Therefore he organised on 30 August 1914 a group of thirty women in his home town of Folkestone to hand out white feathers to any men that were not in uniform. Fitzgerald believed using women to shame the men into enlisting would be the most effective method of encouraging enlistment. The group that he founded (with prominent members being the authors Emma Orczy and Mary Augusta Ward) was known as the White Feather Brigade or the Order of the White Feather. 

While the true effectiveness of the campaign is impossible to judge, it spread throughout several other nations in the empire. In Britain, it started to cause problems for the government when public servants and men in essential occupations came under pressure to enlist. That prompted Home Secretary Reginald McKenna to issue employees in state industries with lapel badges reading &quot;King and Country&quot; to indicate that they were serving the war effort. Likewise, the Silver War Badge, which was given to service personnel who had been honourably discharged by wounds or sickness, was first issued in September 1916 to prevent veterans from being challenged for not wearing uniform. Anecdotes from the time indicate that the campaign was unpopular among soldiers, not least because soldiers who were home on leave could find themselves presented with feathers.
One example was Private Ernest Atkins, who was on leave from the Western Front. He was riding a tram when he was presented with a white feather by a girl sitting behind him. He smacked her across the face with his pay book and said, &quot;Certainly I&#x27;ll take your feather back to the boys at Passchendaele. I&#x27;m in civvies because people think my uniform might be lousy, but if I had it on I wouldn&#x27;t be half as lousy as you&quot;.

Private Norman Demuth, who was discharged from the British Army after he had been wounded in 1916, received numerous white feathers after he returned from the Western Front. In &quot;Forgotten Voices of the Great War&quot;, Demuth says:

Almost the last feather I received was on a bus. I was sitting near the door when I became aware of two women on the other side talking at me, and I thought to myself, &quot;Oh Lord, here we go again&quot;. One lent forward and produced a feather and said, &quot;Here&#x27;s a gift for a brave soldier.&quot; I took it and said, &quot;Thank you very much—I wanted one of those.&quot; Then I took my pipe out of my pocket and put this feather down the stem and worked it in a way I&#x27;ve never worked a pipe cleaner before. When it was filthy I pulled it out and said, &quot;You know, we didn&#x27;t get these in the trenches&quot;, and handed it back to her. She instinctively put out her hand and took it, so there she was sitting with this filthy pipe cleaner in her hand and all the other people on the bus began to get indignant. Then she dropped it and got up to get out, but we were nowhere near a stopping place and the bus went on quite a long way while she got well and truly barracked by the rest of the people on the bus. I sat back and laughed like mad.

Supporters of the campaign were not easily put off. A woman who confronted a young man in a London park demanded to know why he was not in the army. &quot;Because I am a German&quot;, he replied. He received a white feather anyway.

Occasionally injured veterans were mistakenly targeted, such as Reuben W. Farrow who after being aggressively asked by a woman on a tram why he would not do his duty, turned around and showed his missing hand causing her to apologise.

Perhaps the most misplaced use of a white feather was when one was presented to Seaman George Samson, who was on his way in civilian clothes to a public reception being held in his honour for having been awarded the Victoria Cross for gallantry in the Gallipoli campaign.

Roland Gwynne, later the mayor of Eastbourne (1929–1931), received a feather. That prompted him to enlist, and he would receive the Distinguished Service Order for bravery.

The writer Compton Mackenzie, then a serving soldier, complained about the activities of the Order of the White Feather. He argued that &quot;idiotic young women were using white feathers to get rid of boyfriends of whom they were tired&quot;. The pacifist Fenner Brockway said he received so many white feathers that he had enough to make a fan.

===World War II===
The white feather campaign was renewed during World War II.

==As a symbol of pacifism and peace==
In contrast, the white feather has been used by some pacifist organisations as an icon of abstinence from violence.

In the 1870s, the Māori prophet of passive resistance Te Whiti o Rongomai promoted the wearing of white feathers by his followers at Parihaka. They are still worn by the iwi associated with that area, and by Te Āti Awa in Wellington. They are known as &quot;te raukura&quot;, which literally means the red feather, but metaphorically, the chiefly feather. They are usually three in number, interpreted as standing for &quot;glory to God, peace on earth, goodwill toward people&quot; (Luke 2:14). Albatross feathers are preferred but any white feathers will do. They are usually worn in the hair or on the lapel (but not from the ear).

Some time after the war, pacifists found an alternative interpretation of the white feather as a symbol of peace. The apocryphal story goes that in 1775, Quakers in a Friends meeting house in Easton, New York were faced by a tribe of Indians on the war path. Rather than flee, the Quakers fell silent and waited. The Indian chief came into the meeting house and finding no weapons he declared the Quakers as friends. On leaving he took a white feather from his quiver and attached it to the door as a sign to leave the building unharmed.

In 1937 the Peace Pledge Union sold 500 white feather badges as symbols of peace.

==Other meanings==
In the United States, the white feather has also become a symbol of courage, persistence, and superior combat marksmanship. Its most notable wearer was US Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant Carlos Hathcock, who was awarded the Silver Star medal for bravery during the Vietnam War. Hathcock picked up a white feather on a mission and wore it in his hat to taunt the enemy. He was so feared by enemy troops that they put a price on his head. Its wear on combat headgear flaunts an insultingly-easy target for enemy snipers.

==Portrayals in popular culture==

===Literature===
&quot;The Four Feathers&quot; (1902), an adventure novel, by A. E. W. Mason, tells of Harry Feversham, an officer in the British Army, who decides to resign his commission the day before his regiment is dispatched to fight in Sudan (the 1882 First War of Sudan, leading to the fall of Khartoum). Harry&#x27;s three fellow officers and his fiancée conclude that he is resigning to avoid fighting in the conflict, and each sends him a white feather. Stung by the criticism, Harry sails to Sudan, disguises himself as an Arab, and looks for the opportunity to redeem his honour. He manages this by fighting a covert war on behalf of the British, saving the life of one of his colleagues in the process. On returning to England he asks each of his accusers to take back one of the feathers.

The 1907 P. G. Wodehouse novel &quot;The White Feather&quot; is a school story about cowardice and the efforts a boy goes to redeem himself by learning the sport of boxing.

&quot;Rilla of Ingleside&quot; (1921) by Lucy Maud Montgomery, the penultimate book in her Anne of Green Gables series, sees Anne Shirley&#x27;s son, Walter Blythe, enlist in the First World War after receiving a white feather in the mail; he subsequently dies in battle.

&quot;The Man Who Stayed at Home&quot;, a 1914 play by J. E. Harold Terry and Lechmere Worrall, was renamed &quot;The White Feather&quot; when staged in North America. The title character is a British secret agent who is falsely perceived to be a coward for his refusal to enlist as a soldier.

In &quot;The Camels are Coming&quot; (1932), the first collection of Biggles stories, Biggles is handed a white feather by a young woman while on leave in civilian clothes, who is later taken aback to find that he is one of the Royal Flying Corps&#x27; leading pilots.

In Pat Barker&#x27;s 1991 novel &quot;Regeneration&quot;, the character Burns is given two white feathers during his home leave from Craiglockhart War Hospital.

In the 1997 book &quot;Jingo&quot;, citizens of Ankh-Morpork are handed white feathers for not enlisting to fight in the impending war against Klatch.

In the novel &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot; (2004) by Jacqueline Winspear, four young girls take it upon themselves to hand out feathers to young men not in uniform in an effort to shame them into enlisting on Britain&#x27;s side in The Great War.

In the 2015 graphic novel &quot;&quot;, Christabel Pankhurst is depicted encouraging women to hand white feathers to every young man they see out of uniform. Persephone Wright, the protagonist of the story and heretofore a staunch supporter of Pankhurst&#x27;s Votes for Women campaigns, rejects the idea on ethical grounds, saying &quot;a man who&#x27;s been shamed into service isn&#x27;t a volunteer at all&quot;.

===Music===
The Order of the White Feather was the inspiration for the Weddings Parties Anything song &quot;Scorn of the Women&quot;, which concerns a man who is deemed medically unfit for service when he attempts to enlist, and is unjustly accused of cowardice.

In 1983, new wave band Kajagoogoo released their debut album called &quot;White Feathers&quot;, whose opener was the title track, a light-hearted allegory for weak people, whereas the final track, &quot;Frayo&quot;, had a political flavour, referencing cowardice as the cause for an unchanging war-torn world.

In 1985, progressive rock band Marillion released an anti-war song called &quot;White Feather&quot; as the ending track to their album &quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot;.

In 2009, &quot;White Feather&quot; was released as the third single from the Wolfmother album entitled &quot;Cosmic Egg&quot;.

===Film and television===
The novel &quot;The Four Feathers&quot; has been the basis of at least seven feature films, the most recent being &quot;The Four Feathers&quot; (2002), starring Heath Ledger. It was also parodied in the &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; episode &quot;The Two and a Half Feathers&quot;.

In the 1980 BBC TV series &quot;To Serve Them All My Days&quot;, David Powlett-Jones, a shell-shocked officer, takes a position in a boys&#x27; school. Suspecting that fellow teacher Carter may be avoiding war duty, he muses, &quot;I&#x27;d give a good deal to know whether he&#x27;s really got a gammy knee&quot;, to which an acerbic colleague responds, &quot;I suppose we couldn&#x27;t get some chubby cherub to give him the white feather&quot; as a means of accusing the suspected malingerer.

The 2000 Canadian miniseries, &quot;Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story&quot;, includes a scene in which Anne Shirley&#x27;s fiancé, Gilbert Blythe, receives a white feather from a young woman, despite the fact he is a medical doctor and therefore one who provides an essential service at home. He eventually does enlist, and much of the plot deals with Anne searching for him when he&#x27;s declared missing in action. As noted above, in the original novels, it is Anne and Gilbert&#x27;s son, Walter, who enlists after receiving a feather.

In the short-lived 2007 British period drama &quot;Lilies&quot;, the brother of the protagonists is discharged from the military during World War I after his boat sinks and he is one of a handful of shell-shocked survivors. Billy gets sent and given numerous white feathers for his perceived cowardice, and begins to hallucinate them choking him. This is a recurring theme throughout the series.

In the 2010 Australian film &quot;Beneath Hill 60&quot; about real-life soldier Oliver Woodward, Woodward, before enlisting, receives several feathers to which he jokingly states, &quot;Just a few more feathers, and I&#x27;ll have a whole chicken.&quot;

In the first episode of the second season of &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;, a pair of young women interrupt a benefit concert to hand out white feathers to the men who have not enlisted, before being ordered out by an angry Earl of Grantham.

In the 2021 film &quot;The King&#x27;s Man&quot;, Conrad is given a white feather to shame him into enlisting in the British Army.

===Comics===
DC Comics&#x27; spoof superhero team the Inferior Five includes a cowardly archer named White Feather. He was intended as a reference to DC Comics&#x27; more heroic character Green Arrow and similar &quot;super archer&quot; characters.

<doc id="523070" wikidata="Q1386420" url="?curid=523070" title="Joseph P. Kennedy II">
<text>Joseph Patrick Kennedy II (born September 24, 1952) is an American businessman, Democratic politician, and a member of the Kennedy family. He is a son of former United States Senator Robert F. Kennedy and Ethel Kennedy, and he is a nephew of former U.S. President John F. Kennedy and former U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy.

Kennedy served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from the 8th congressional district of Massachusetts from 1987 to 1999. In 1979 he founded and, until he was elected to the U.S. House, led Citizens Energy Corporation, a non-profit energy company which provides heating oil to low-income and elderly families in Massachusetts.

==Early life, family and education==
Kennedy was born in the Brighton section of Boston, Massachusetts on September 24, 1952. He was the second of 11 children to Ethel (née Skakel) and Robert F. Kennedy. He was named after his grandfather Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., the patriarch of the Kennedy family and his uncle Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. who was killed in an airplane crash in 1944 during World War II. Kennedy spent his childhood between the family&#x27;s homes in McLean, Virginia and Hyannis Port, Massachusetts.

Kennedy had a troubled youth and was expelled from several private schools as a result of his quick temper. He regularly got into fights with his younger brothers and male cousins. He was 15 when his father was assassinated. The night he was shot at the Ambassador Hotel, Kennedy along with two siblings, Kathleen and Robert Jr., were being flown to Los Angeles aboard one of the planes in the Secret Service&#x27;s presidential fleet&quot;&quot;.

Kennedy dropped out of Milton Academy, a preparatory boarding school in Milton, Massachusetts, when he was not allowed to take time off to work in his Uncle Ted&#x27;s 1970 Senate campaign and finished his high school studies at Manter Hall, a tutoring school in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1971. During his time at Milton, he was roommate to Thomas C. Wales.

Kennedy attended the University of California, Berkeley in 1972, but dropped out. He returned to school after a major car accident which occurred in 1973 and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Massachusetts Boston in 1976.

==Early career==
While on hiatus from college, he worked for several months as part of a federally funded program to combat and treat tuberculosis in the African American community in San Francisco, California. Mayor Joseph Alioto personally praised Kennedy&#x27;s work in the community. Kennedy resigned from his position in the program and returned to Massachusetts in the summer of 1973.

In 1979, Kennedy founded Citizens Energy Corporation, a non-profit organization to provide discounted heating oil to low-income and elderly families in Massachusetts. According to author J. Randy Taraborrelli, Kennedy started the venture &quot;to alleviate the burden of heating bills for the poor during the oil crisis of that year.&quot; By 1984, Citizens Energy helped provide low-cost heat for 250,000 families. In 2010, Kennedy transformed the organization to become a leader in renewable energy generation while continuing to use profits to provide energy savings to low-income families. (&quot;See Citizens Energy (since 1979) section below.&quot;)

==U.S. House of Representatives (1987–1999)==

===Elections===
In 1986, incumbent Democrat and Speaker of the House Thomas Phillip &quot;Tip&quot; O&#x27;Neill Jr., who had held Massachusetts&#x27; 8th congressional district (a Democratic stronghold in Boston and Cambridge, Massachusetts) seat since 1953, announced his retirement. Kennedy decided to run for the seat, which his uncle, former president John F. Kennedy, had held from 1947 to 1953. The Democratic nomination was contested by a number of well-known Democrats including state senator George Bachrach and state representative Mel King. However, Kennedy garnered endorsements from &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; and the retiring O&#x27;Neill. Kennedy won the primary with 53%. He won the general election with 72% of the vote. He won re-election in 1988 (80%), 1990 (72%), 1992 (83%), 1994 (99%), and 1996 (84%).

===Tenure===
Kennedy&#x27;s legislative efforts in the U.S. House of Representatives included

*Expanding the availability of credit to working Americans to buy homes and to open businesses.
*Requiring public disclosure of bank-lending practices in poorer neighborhoods and disclosure of bank home-mortgage approvals and refusals by race, sex, and income. Subsequent Federal Reserve Board studies based on these newly required disclosures found widespread evidence of discriminatory-loan practices. One study found that white borrowers in the lowest-income category were approved for mortgages more than African American borrowers in the highest-income category. Data from Boston, Chicago, and Minneapolis found that African Americans were turned down at three times the rate of whites.
*Helping create hundreds of thousands of new affordable-housing units nationwide by introducing tax credits to stimulate private investment in neighborhood housing developments after federal housing assistance had been cut by 75 percent during the 1980s.
*Chairing the House Banking subcommittee on consumer credit and insurance and holding the first U.S. congressional hearings to expose the lack of access to insurance in low-income neighborhoods.
*Proposing a balanced-budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution as a vehicle to end skyrocketing deficits, reduce interest rates, and free up investment capital for business growth rather than government bonds while fighting to end corporate tax breaks and subsidies.
*Overhauling federal public-housing law for the first time in almost 60 years, giving local housing authorities the ability to raise standards while protecting those who depend on public housing for shelter.
*Co-chairing the U.S. congressional biotechnology caucus and proposing to preserve and expand federal research and development accounts that stimulate the creation of new technologies and build the foundation for new jobs and business growth.
*Proposing the &quot;Mom and Pop Protection Act&quot; to help corner-store owners to install safety equipment and a &quot;National Stalker Reduction Act&quot; to require all states to enact comprehensive anti-stalking legislation, track stalkers, and establish a national domestic-violence database to track violations of civil-protection orders.
*Protecting kids from alcohol by proposing to limit television advertising of beer and wine between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. and to keep outdoor alcohol advertisements away from schools.
*Launching a bipartisan initiative in Massachusetts to fight child hunger that helped lead to an expansion of school breakfast and lunch programs.

In 1988 Kennedy traveled to Northern Ireland. During his stay the Democratic Unionist Party called him a &quot;Republican parrot&quot;. He also had a well publicized encounter with a British soldier who suggested that Kennedy return home. In 1991 Kennedy boycotted a speech to the U.S. Congress by the United Kingdom&#x27;s Queen Elizabeth II &quot;in protest to the British occupation in Northern Ireland.&quot;

In March 1998, following a year of family troubles that included the skiing death of his brother Michael LeMoyne Kennedy, he announced that he planned to retire from the U.S. House, citing &quot;a new recognition of our own vulnerabilities and the vagaries of life.&quot; An editorial in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; observed that &quot;Kennedy has remained steadfast in his political life to issues and constituencies no poll would have led him to: the poor, the homeless, disadvantaged children, and others swamped in the current tide of prosperity.&quot; He served in the U.S. House for six terms, until January 1999. In his final speech on the U.S. House floor, Kennedy delivered &quot;an impassioned plea for unity and forgiveness&quot; in the midst of Congressional debate regarding the proposed articles of impeachment of President Bill Clinton.

===Committee assignments===
Throughout his career in the U.S. House, Kennedy served on the House Banking Committee, where he played an active role in the federal saving-and-loan bailout, credit-reporting reform, the overhaul of the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933 and financial modernization. Kennedy also served on the House Veterans&#x27; Affairs Committee, passing legislation to strengthen the veterans&#x27; health-care system, to investigate the causes of Gulf War syndrome, and to provide medical treatment for veterans of the Persian Gulf War.

==Citizens Energy (since 1999)==
===Overview===
After leaving the House of Representatives, Kennedy returned to Citizens Energy. (During Kennedy&#x27;s terms in the House, it had been run by his brother Michael.) Citizens Energy pursues commercial ventures aimed at generating revenues that, in turn, are used to generate funds that could assist those in need in the U.S. and abroad. It grew to encompass seven separate companies, including one of the largest energy-conservation firms in the U.S. Citizens Energy became one of the U.S.&#x27;s first energy firms to move large volumes of natural gas to more than 30 states. As a precursor to market changes under electricity deregulation in the late 1990s, Citizens Energy was a pioneer in moving and marketing electrical power over the power grid. In recent years, Kennedy has led the company into the renewable-energy industry, building solar farms along the East Coast and transmission lines to support charitable programs like one giving free solar panels to low-income families in California. In 2019, Citizens Energy announced the completion of one of the largest Low-Income Community Shared Solar projects in the country, funded by its investment in the Sunrise PowerLink Transmission line. Totaling 30 megawatts, the record-breaking California project will provide $500 in energy savings to 12,000 low-income families each year.

===Public policy===
Since returning to Citizens Energy, Kennedy also has sought to influence energy-related public policy, challenging the Bush administration to invest in energy conservation and efficiency and renewable energy, encouraging Congress to fully fund federal heating assistance programs, proposing that oil-consuming countries work together to balance oil prices against Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) manipulation, and calling for the federal government and major oil companies to use portions of royalties from oil and gas extracted from federal lands and waters to help low-income families with the high price of energy. Kennedy has been criticized for the salaries paid to himself and his wife. In 2012, as CEO of Citizens Energy and related organizations, Kennedy was paid a total of $796,000 in compensation, and his wife was paid an additional $344,000 as Director of Marketing.

===Venezuela===
Beginning in 2005, Citgo Petroleum Company (Citgo), a wholly owned subsidiary of Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA)—the Venezuelan state-owned oil company—has been the primary donor of heating oil to Citizens Energy. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and others criticized Citizens Energy for continuing its relationship with the Venezuelan government and Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez, a harsh critic of the United States. In response, Kennedy and others have argued that it is hypocritical to criticize a non-profit organization for accepting oil from Venezuela while numerous other American businesses are profiting from robust trade with Venezuela and at a time when the U.S. government has cut low-income fuel assistance.

Although Citgo donations reportedly dried up in 2015 owing to Venezuela&#x27;s economic turmoil, the company was reported in 2009 to have donated 83 million gallons of oil over the two previous years, which was used to provide heating assistance to an estimated 200,000 families a year in 23 states.

Kennedy has since turned into a critic of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro, the handpicked successor of Chávez, accusing him of &quot;stealing democracy from the people&quot; and calling for Maduro&#x27;s removal.

==Later political considerations==
===Gubernatorial elections===
In 1993, a &quot;Boston Globe&quot; poll showed Kennedy within one percentage point of popular incumbent William Weld in a hypothetical gubernatorial match-up, prompting prominent state Democrats to try and recruit him for the race. Though no other Democrat was polling near Weld, Kennedy decided to forgo the race and remain in Congress. Mark Roosevelt won the nomination and lost to Governor Weld by over 40 points.

Kennedy was considered the front runner for the governorship of Massachusetts in 1998, but revelations about his personal life led to a tumultuous fall in public opinion polling, and he decided against running.
Kennedy explained in a VFW hall in a working-class corner of Boston that he believed he would never be able to focus his candidacy on issues: &quot;The race will focus on personal or family questions. It is not fair to my family, it is not fair to the people of Massachusetts and it is not the right thing to do.&quot;

=== 2010 U.S. Senate election ===
With the death of his uncle Ted Kennedy on August 25, 2009, Kennedy&#x27;s name had been mentioned as a possible candidate for his uncle&#x27;s United States Senate seat representing Massachusetts. In an Associated Press article, Democratic strategist Dan Payne said, &quot;He wouldn&#x27;t be human and he wouldn&#x27;t be a Kennedy if he didn&#x27;t give serious consideration to running for what is known as the &#x27;Kennedy seat&#x27; in Massachusetts.&quot; However, Kennedy released a statement on September 7 explaining that he would not pursue the seat. The seat eventually went by appointment to Paul G. Kirk and later by election to Republican Scott Brown.

===Endorsements===
Kennedy endorsed incumbent Democrat Joe Biden&#x27;s reelection campaign in the 2024 United States presidential election over a third-party/independent challenge by his brother Robert Jr.

==Personal life==

On February 22, 1972, Kennedy was on Lufthansa Flight 649 when it was hijacked. Shortly after the inflight movie began during the 747&#x27;s flight from New Delhi to Athens, five gunmen seized the jet and forced it to land at Aden International Airport, where all hostages were released the following day.

In August 1973, a Jeep he was driving on Nantucket overturned, fracturing a vertebra of his brother David and permanently paralyzing David&#x27;s girlfriend, Pam Kelley. The police cited Kennedy for reckless driving and the judge temporarily suspended his driver&#x27;s license. The Kennedy family paid for Kelley&#x27;s initial medical treatment and contributed modestly to her care during the years following the accident.

=== Marriages and reversed annulment ===
On February 3, 1979, Kennedy married Sheila Brewster Rauch, a daughter of banker Rudolph Stewart &quot;Stew&quot; Rauch Jr., president and then chairman of the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society. On October 4, 1980, the couple had fraternal twin sons, Matthew Rauch &quot;Matt&quot; Kennedy and Joseph Patrick &quot;Joe&quot; Kennedy III. They were legally divorced in 1991.

In 1993, Kennedy asked the Catholic Archdiocese of Boston for an annulment of his marriage to Rauch, claiming he was mentally incapable of entering into marriage at the time of the wedding. An annulment would have rendered the marriage void in the Church. This would have also allowed Kennedy to marry Anne Elizabeth &quot;Beth&quot; Kelly a former staff member of his, in a Catholic ceremony, as well as allow him to continue receiving Holy Communion (which is forbidden for a divorced person who remarries outside of the Church). Rauch refused to agree to the annulment; Kennedy married Kelly in a non-Catholic civil ceremony on October 23, 1993.

The Boston Archdiocese initially ruled in favor of the annulment, which Rauch says she discovered only after the fact, in 1996. An Episcopalian, she later wrote a book, &quot;Shattered Faith: A Woman&#x27;s Struggle to Stop the Catholic Church from Annulling Her Marriage&quot;, explaining that she was opposed to the concept of annulment because it meant in Catholic theology that the marriage had never actually existed. She also claimed that the Kennedy family influence made it possible to unilaterally &quot;cancel&quot; a 12-year marriage.

Catholic canon law at the time required a tribunal decision in favor of annulment to be automatically appealed, and the decision was not effective until a second, conforming, sentence was granted. Instead of allowing the appeal to take place in the United States, Rauch appealed directly to the Roman Rota, the highest appellate tribunal of the Catholic Church. The annulment was overturned by the Rota in 2005. Rauch says she was not informed of the decision until 2007, receiving the news from Boston Archdiocese officials. As the first decision was never confirmed, there was no time at which the Church finally declared the marriage to be null or gave Kennedy permission to remarry. Because the Rota was sitting as a second-instance appellate court, Kennedy could appeal against the decision to another Rotal panel.

<doc id="523076" wikidata="Q5419628" url="?curid=523076" title="Excitable medium">
<text>An excitable medium is a nonlinear dynamical system which has the capacity to propagate a wave of some description, and which cannot support the passing of another wave until a certain amount of time has passed (known as the refractory time).

A forest is an example of an excitable medium: if a wildfire burns through the forest, no fire can return to a burnt spot until the vegetation has gone through its refractory period and regrown. In chemistry, oscillating reactions are excitable media, for example the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction and the Briggs–Rauscher reaction. Cell excitability is the change in membrane potential that is necessary for cellular responses in various tissues. The resting potential forms the basis of cell excitability and these processes are fundamental for the generation of graded and action potentials. Normal and pathological activities in the heart and brain can be modelled as excitable media. A group of spectators at a sporting event are an excitable medium, as can be observed in a Mexican wave (so-called from its initial appearance in the 1986 World Cup in Mexico).

==Modelling excitable media==

Excitable media can be modelled using both partial differential equations and cellular automata.

===With cellular automata===

Cellular automata provide a simple model to aid in the understanding of excitable media. Perhaps the simplest such model is in. See Greenberg-Hastings cellular automaton for this model. 
Each cell of the automaton is made to represent some section of the medium being modelled (for example, a patch of trees in a forest, or a segment of heart tissue). Each cell can be in one of the three following states:

* Quiescent or excitable — the cell is unexcited, but can be excited. In the forest fire example, this corresponds to the trees being unburnt.
* Excited — the cell is excited. The trees are on fire.
* Refractory — the cell has recently been excited and is temporarily not excitable. This corresponds to a patch of land where the trees have burnt and the vegetation has yet to regrow.

As in all cellular automata, the state of a particular cell in the next time step depends on the state of the cells around it—its neighbours—at the current time. In the forest fire example the simple rules given in Greenberg-Hastings cellular automaton might be modified as follows:

* If a cell is quiescent, then it remains quiescent unless one or more of its neighbours is excited. In the forest fire example, this means a patch of land only burns if a neighbouring patch is on fire.
* If a cell is excited, it becomes refractory at the next iteration. After trees have finished burning, the patch of land is left barren.
* If a cell is refractory, then its remaining refractory period is lessened at the next period, until it reaches the end of the refractory period and becomes excitable once more. The trees regrow.

This function can be refined according to the particular medium. For example, the effect of wind can be added to the model of the forest fire.

==Geometries of waves==

===One-dimensional waves===

It is most common for a one-dimensional medium to form a closed circuit, i.e. a ring. For example, the Mexican wave can be modeled as a ring going around the stadium. If the wave moves in one direction it will eventually return to where it started. If, upon a wave&#x27;s return to the origin, the original spot has gone through its refractory period, then the wave will propagate along the ring again (and will do so indefinitely). If, however, the origin is still refractory upon the wave&#x27;s return, the wave will be stopped.

In the Mexican wave, for example, if for some reason, the originators of the wave are still standing upon its return it will not continue. If the originators have sat back down then the wave can, in theory, continue.

===Two-dimensional waves===

Several forms of waves can be observed in a two-dimensional medium.

A &quot;spreading wave&quot; will originate at a single point in the medium and spread outwards. For example, a forest fire could start from a lightning strike at the centre of a forest and spread outwards.

A &quot;spiral wave&quot; will again originate at a single point, but will spread in a spiral circuit. Spiral waves are believed to underlie phenomena such as tachycardia and fibrillation.

Spiral waves constitute one of the mechanisms of fibrillation when they organize in long-lasting reentrant activities named rotors.

<doc id="523088" wikidata="Q1804720" url="?curid=523088" title="Michael LeMoyne Kennedy">
<text>Michael LeMoyne Kennedy (February 27, 1958 – December 31, 1997) was an American lawyer, businessman, and activist in Massachusetts. He was the sixth of eleven children of Robert F. Kennedy and Ethel Kennedy. Kennedy also served as the manager of the non-profit organization Citizens Energy. He died in Aspen, Colorado, in 1997 after inadvertently skiing into a tree.

==Early life, family, and education==
Michael LeMoyne Kennedy was born on February 27, 1958, in Washington, D.C. He was named LeMoyne for Kirk LeMoyne Billings, the preparatory school roommate of his paternal uncle, John F. Kennedy, and a Kennedy family friend. He was five years old when his uncle was assassinated and ten years old when his father was assassinated. Kennedy spent his childhood between the family&#x27;s homes in McLean, Virginia, and Hyannis Port, Massachusetts.

Kennedy graduated from Harvard College in 1980 and subsequently earned his Juris Doctor from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1984. In 1985, Kennedy was admitted to the Massachusetts bar.

Kennedy married Victoria Denise Gifford, daughter of former NFL player and sportscaster Frank Gifford, on March 14, 1981 in New York City. They had one son, Michael LeMoyne Kennedy Jr. (b. 1983); and two daughters, Kyle Francis Kennedy (b. 1984) and Rory Gifford Kennedy (b. 1987). The family resided in Cohasset, Massachusetts.

==Career==
A Boston lawyer, Kennedy briefly worked for a private law firm before becoming chairman of his brother Joseph&#x27;s non-profit organization, Citizens Energy Corporation in 1986, which provides heating oil and services to elderly and low-income households in Massachusetts. Under Kennedy, Citizens diversified to provide discount AIDS-related medications to uninsured patients.

Kennedy co-chaired the Walden Woods Project, a non-profit organization to preserve Walden Pond in Concord, Massachusetts. In 1994, he co-founded Stop Handgun Violence, a Boston-based group that works to increase public awareness about the danger of handguns. That same year, he helped organize his uncle Ted Kennedy&#x27;s successful re-election campaign for the U.S. Senate against Republican challenger Mitt Romney. The conventional wisdom in Massachusetts was that he would be the next Kennedy family member to run for political office.

In 1992, Kennedy, his wife Victoria, and his mother Ethel made a cameo appearance on the NBC sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot; in Boston. 

===Affair===
In 1997, allegations were reported that Kennedy was having an affair with the family&#x27;s underage former babysitter, beginning when she was just 14 years old. Kennedy took and passed three polygraph tests arranged by his attorneys, claiming he had not had sex with the Cohasset teen until she was 16, the legal age of consent in Massachusetts at the time. Soon after the scandal began, Kennedy and his wife separated. Norfolk County District Attorney Jeffrey Locke decided to drop the investigation into statutory rape allegations because of a lack of cooperation from the babysitter. Kennedy and his older brother Joseph (who withdrew from the 1998 Massachusetts gubernatorial election, in part because of the scandal) were dubbed &quot;poster boys for bad behavior&quot; by cousin John F. Kennedy Jr. in an editorial in his magazine &quot;George&quot;. According to some Massachusetts political observers, the incident ended Kennedy&#x27;s hopes of following in his family&#x27;s political footsteps. According to Boston University professor Tobe Berkovitz, &quot;I would have to think as both a political and a public figure, he is just finished.&quot;

==Death==
Kennedy died on December 31, 1997, as the result of a skiing accident in Aspen Mountain, Colorado. He was playing football while on skis with several other members of the Kennedy family when, at approximately 4:15 p.m., he hit a tree. Kennedy was not wearing a helmet or other safety equipment. The family had been admonished by the ski patrol to cease the activity. After the accident, Kennedy was taken to Aspen Valley Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 5:50 p.m.

He was interred on January 3, 1998, in the family plot at Holyhood Cemetery in Brookline, Massachusetts.

<text>Francis Willughby&#x27;s Book of Games is a book published in 2003 that printed for the first time a transcription of a seventeenth-century manuscript written by Francis Willughby that was held in the library of the University of Nottingham. The modern edition was edited by Jeffrey L Forgeng, Dorothy Johnston, and David Cram, and was published by Ashgate Publishing Company with . The manuscript was left incomplete when Willughby died at the age of 36, but even in its unfinished state it provides an unrivalled insight into the sports and games of his period.

Among the features of the book include descriptions of card games that are otherwise only known from reference in literature. It also includes the first formal study of children&#x27;s board games to be written in a European language; investigation of the original manuscript has revealed that some of the descriptions of children&#x27;s games were actually written by an unknown child, with later corrections being made by Willughby.

== Card games ==
There is a general introduction about card games and then the following are described in detail: 
* One and Thirtie (Thirty One)
* One and Thirtie Bon Ace
* Hannikin Canst Abide It, an English version of Quinze
* Laugh &amp; Ly Downe
* Nodde, also spelt Noddy, a precursor to Cribbage
* Cribbidge (Cribbage) and variants called &quot;A New Cribbidge or Nodde&quot; and &quot;Double Hand Cribbidge&quot;
* Ruffe &amp; Trump, a form of Ruff and Honours
* Gleeke, also spelt Gleek
* Beast, or Le Beste, English version of the French &quot;La Bête&quot;
* Loosing Lodum and a variant called Winning Loadum
* Ging or Seven Cards
* Put, an old English gambling game
* Wheehee, a children&#x27;s game

== Tables games ==
There is a general introduction, &quot;Tables&quot;, on the equipment used for tables games followed by detailed accounts of the following:
* Dublets
* Ticktack
* Irish, the immediate ancestor of Backgammon
* Back Gammon (Backgammon)
* Long Laurence, not a tables game but a gambling game with an elongated die

<doc id="523100" wikidata="Q5377456" url="?curid=523100" title="Engblom v. Carey">
<text>Engblom v. Carey, 677 F.2d 957 (2d Cir. 1982), is a landmark decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit interpreting the Third Amendment to the United States Constitution for the first time. It is notable for being one of the few significant court decisions to interpret the Third Amendment prohibition of quartering soldiers in homes during peacetime without the owner&#x27;s consent. The dispute covered the housing of the National Guard in worker dorms while they were acting as prison workers during a strike.

In a 2–1 decision by a three-judge panel, &quot;Engblom&quot; articulated three principles that apply to challenges under the Third Amendment. First: national guardsmen are considered soldiers for the purposes of a Third Amendment claim. This holding extends Third Amendment protections beyond federal armed forces, such as the army, to include the state-regulated militia. Second: the Third Amendment is incorporated and thus applies to individual states as well as the federal government. This holding extends Third Amendment protections beyond federal use of the National Guard to include state use of the National Guard. Third: the protections of the Third Amendment apply beyond fee simple homeownership. This holding interprets the Third Amendment as protecting those who have general control over access to a property. The panel determined that the correctional officers were tenants (having such general control) and remanded the case back to the district court. However, the lower court ultimately ruled in the defendants&#x27; favor based on qualified immunity.

The Third Amendment remains one of the least cited sections of the Constitution in United States case law, and it has never provided the primary basis for a Supreme Court decision. As a decision of the Second Circuit, &quot;Engblom v. Carey&quot; is only binding precedent in New York, Vermont, and Connecticut, but its general implications have been considered by legal scholars.

== Legal background ==

The Third Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the quartering of soldiers in homes. While the relevance of the Third Amendment in modern times is limited, at the time the Constitution was ratified, quartering of soldiers was a major issue. In the colonial period, whenever Britain would launch a military operation in North America, their soldiers needed to be housed. This burden fell to the American colonies, and often soldiers would be quartered in private homes. This caused tension as early as 1676, and in 1683 the New York Assembly&#x27;s Charter of Liberties and Privileges responded by prohibiting the quartering of soldiers in private homes during peacetime. The problem continued during the French and Indian War, and after its conclusion, the British parliament passed the Quartering Acts which shifted onto the colonies the burden of quartering a standing army in peacetime. Ultimately, the quartering of troops proved too onerous, and in the Declaration of Independence, the revolutionaries cited the quartering of troops as a reason for independence. By the end of the Revolutionary War, three states had passed declarations of rights that prohibited the quartering of troops like New York&#x27;s 1683 resolution.

During the ratification of the Constitution, the lack of a bill of rights—including the right to be free from quartering soldiers—was a point of contention between federalists and anti-federalists. Federalists favored the quartering prohibitions in state constitutions, while anti-federalists proposed a stronger, nation-wide prohibition. From this debate, three versions of the third amendment were proposed. The first—proposed by the Maryland and New Hampshire delegations—prohibited quartering in homes during times of peace. The Virginia delegation proposed a second version which included language which clarified the right in times of war: soldiers would only be quartered &quot;as the law directs&quot;. This posed an interpretive issue, as peace and war may not cover times of unrest when the military is active but no declaration of war has been made. The version proposed by James Madison forbade forced quartering during times of peace but addressed the interpretive issues of the Virginia amendment by forbidding quartering in homes when not at peace, except as provided by law. However Madison&#x27;s proposal was rejected, and with minor alterations, Virginia&#x27;s proposal was ratified as the text of the Third Amendment:
Since its ratification, the Third Amendment has rarely been litigated, and no Supreme Court case has relied on the Third Amendment as the basis for a decision. As such, the Third Amendment has not been found to apply to the state—a principle known as the incorporation doctrine. Before the 1920s, the Bill of Rights was considered to only apply to the federal government, not actions by state governments. However, in the 1920s, the federal judiciary began to interpret the Fourteenth Amendment as preventing individual states from violating federally protected rights. Under the incorporation doctrine, Supreme Court cases found that individual amendments applied to the states. The few times the Supreme Court has cited the Third Amendment in decisions, it was in consideration of general constitutional principles—particularly privacy rights. Chief among them is the decision in &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot; (1965) which articulated a constitutionally protected right to privacy. &quot;Griswold&quot; found this right in multiple amendments, but included the Third Amendment among its examples of rights which imply overarching privacy right. However the Supreme Court has not taken up the question of whether the Third Amendment is incorporated. Because the National Guard is a state-run militia, if the Third Amendment were not incorporated, then its protections would not apply to quartering of state-controlled National Guard troops.

== Prior history ==
===Original dispute ===
Following the September 1971 Attica prison uprising, New York State instituted several reforms to address due process rights of prisoners, increase racial integration of prison staff, and improve training and address racism among corrections officers. As a result of these reforms, discontent grew among New York State corrections officers who felt their status and authority diminished. In December 1978, the union representing the officers began negotiating a new contract with the state. Having recently negotiated a seven-percent wage increase with the civil servant union, the state offered a seven-percent wage increase to the officers. The state also sought to reduce the seniority rights of officers and change the structure of the officers&#x27; workers&#x27; compensation leave. To counter the loss of status and authority, the union rejected the changes in seniority and leave policy and pushed for an increase of more than seven percent. After four months of negotiation, the union and state declared an impasse in March 1979. After mediation with the Public Employees Relation Board, the state offered a contract with a seven-percent pay increase and a clause to reopen the negotiation of these points in the second year. The union negotiating team accepted these terms, but it was not ratified by the union membership. On April 18, 1979, nearly all of the 7,000 officers of the New York State Department of Corrections went on strike.

Plaintiff-appellants Marianne Engblom and Charles Palmer were corrections officers at Mid-Orange Correctional Facility in Warwick, New York. Engblom and Palmer lived in the Upper Staff Building—a residence for staff located about a quarter-mile () from the prison. The tenancy was regulated by the Department of Corrections, and tenants were required to pay non-tax-deductible rent, provide their own furnishings, and were entitled to repairs and maintenance &quot;following normal &#x27;landlord-tenant responsibilities and practices&quot;. During the strike, New York Governor Hugh Carey activated the National Guard to maintain the prisons. The Guard arrived at Mid-Orange on April 19, 1979, and reached a total force of 260. These Guardsmen were housed in the school and administrative buildings before April 25, at which point the striking officer-tenants were evicted and Guardsmen stationed in those rooms. Both Engblom and Palmer were evicted in this manner.

The strike ended May 5, 1979. Engblom and Palmer subsequently filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the state of New York and its governor, Hugh Carey. Petitioners asserted violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and violation of the Third Amendment. 

=== District Court ===

The District Court ruled in favor of the defendants and dismissed the suit. Petitioners then appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.

== Decision ==
Rendered on May 3, 1982, the decision was written for the court by Judge Walter R. Mansfield. It began by affirming the District Court&#x27;s dismissal of the Due Process claim. It then turned to petitioners&#x27; Third Amendment claim.

Because of the lack of any prior Third Amendment jurisprudence, this decision established three important holdings not previously articulated: (1) that the National Guardsmen qualify as soldiers under the Third Amendment; (2) that the Third Amendment applies to state as well as federal authorities, i.e., is incorporated against the states; and (3), that the protection of the Third Amendment extends beyond homeowners, that is, those only with a fee simple arrangement, but includes anyone who, within their residence, has a legal expectation of privacy and a legal right to exclude others from entering into the premises. The majority held that the correctional officers&#x27; occupancy in the rooms was covered under the legal rules of &quot;tenancy&quot; and was therefore protected under the Third Amendment.

The case was remanded to District Court where it was decided in the defendants&#x27; favor, due to the principle that, as agents of the state, the defendants were covered by a qualified immunity unless they knowingly acted illegally. In the absence of any previous precedent on this issue, the standard of knowing illegality was not met.

Concurring in part and dissenting in part, Judge Irving R. Kaufman maintained that the officers&#x27; occupancy was covered under the lesser protection of employee housing and that the special circumstances of residency in prison grounds superseded Third Amendment protection. Kaufman deemed the application of the Third Amendment to be &quot;far-fetched&quot;.

<doc id="523101" wikidata="Q217268" url="?curid=523101" title="Songs About Jane">
<text>Songs About Jane is the debut studio album by American pop rock band Maroon 5. The album was released on June 25, 2002, by Octone and J Records. It became a sleeper hit with the help of five singles that attained chart success, led by &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot;, &quot;This Love&quot;, and &quot;She Will Be Loved&quot;. This is the band&#x27;s only album to feature founding drummer Ryan Dusick (excluding Kara&#x27;s Flowers releases).

The album was re-released on October 14, 2003, becoming a huge international commercial success, and received acclaim from fans and critics. It topped the album charts in Australia, France, New Zealand, the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom, and reached the top-ten in 17 other countries. At the end of 2004, the album reached the top-ten of the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. It had sold nearly 2.7 million copies by the end of 2004, and over 5.1 million copies in the U.S. by August 2015. By 2007 it had sold 10 million copies worldwide.

On June 5, 2012, the band released the album&#x27;s 10th anniversary edition, to coincide with their fourth studio album &quot;Overexposed&quot;. The anniversary edition features demos of all the album tracks, plus other B-Sides and demos. It also features an EPK and behind the scenes footage of the album.

To date, fans and critics consider &quot;Songs About Jane&quot; as the best album that the band has made.

== Background ==

All but one member of Maroon 5 had been members of a previous Los Angeles rock band called Kara&#x27;s Flowers, which released an album called &quot;The Fourth World&quot; in mid-1997 on Reprise Records with little success, and had previously released the independent album &quot;We Like Digging?&quot;. Kara&#x27;s Flowers left Reprise Records in 1999, and with the addition of guitarist James Valentine, the five-person band became known as Maroon 5.

The band played showcase gigs in New York City and Los Angeles. Singer and guitarist Adam Levine credited the interim with influencing the band&#x27;s new style in an interview with VH1. &quot;During the time between our record deals, I spent a lot of time in New York where I was exposed to an urban and hip-hop culture in a way that had never happened to me in L.A. It turned me on to an entirely new genre of music which has had a profound impact on my song writing.&quot;

The band signed with Octone Records, a New York independent label with distribution through BMG and an artist development deal with Clive Davis&#x27; J Records. The band recorded &quot;Songs About Jane&quot; at Rumbo Recorders in Los Angeles with producer Matt Wallace, who had also produced with Train, Faith No More, and O.A.R. Production was handled primarily by Wallace, with Mark Endert mixing with additional production for &quot;This Love&quot;.

Eight of the songs on the album were either written or co-written by Levine and keyboardist Jesse Carmichael, while the former was living in New York. Many of the lyrics for the album are inspired by Levine&#x27;s relationship with his ex-girlfriend, Jane Herman. Levine notes, &quot;I saw this girl at a gas station, and I fell in love with her,&quot; he says. &quot;I wrote a song about her and played it in the store where she worked. It was an awful song. But she found out about this relatively psychotic boy. She was my muse for years. . . . And then it kind of faded away.&quot; Levine also confirmed this, saying there was at least one line in every song about her.

== Release and reception ==

The album has been released with the Copy Control protection system in some regions. After the release of the album in mid-2002, the band toured with Michelle Branch and Nikka Costa. They also toured with Matchbox Twenty and Sugar Ray during some of their shows in 2003. In March 2004, the album had reached the top 20 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and had reached the top 10 by the end of the year. &quot;Songs About Jane&quot; also eventually topped the UK and Australian album charts. &quot;Songs About Jane&quot; was the seventh best-selling album of 2004 in the U.S., with about 2.7 million copies sold. In Australia, the album did not chart on the End of Year Charts until 2004, where it reached No. 6. After constant touring, three years after the release of &quot;Songs About Jane,&quot; it received a Grammy for Best New Artist. The album reached 5.1 million sales in the United States in August 2015.

The album received acclaim from music critics. Christian Hoard of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised the album for its &quot;vaguely funky white-soul stylings, tunefulness and vocals&quot; and mentioned &quot;Must Get Out&quot; and &quot;This Love&quot; as the album&#x27;s standout tracks. AllMusic&#x27;s MacKenzie Wilson called the album an &quot;impressive rebirth&quot; from Kara&#x27;s Flowers&#x27; &quot;indie outfit&quot;, stating: &quot;&quot;Songs About Jane&quot; is love-drunk on what makes Maroon 5 tick as a band ... they&#x27;ve got grit and a sexy strut, personally and musically.&quot; Caroline Sullivan of &quot;The Guardian&quot; commented that the album &quot;isn&#x27;t as useless as one would hope ... &quot;Songs About Jane&quot; is pitched at the Busted market, for which their guitar-mashing and surging harmonies eminently qualify them.&quot; In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Mikael Wood wrote that while Adam Levine&#x27;s &quot;sexual politics occasionally lapse into casual senior-year cruelty&quot;, he &quot;more often than not complicates the situation encouragingly.&quot; &quot;PopMatters&quot;″s Jason Thompson, however, panned the album, criticizing Levine&#x27;s likeness to Jay Kay of Jamiroquai. Calling the album &quot;limp at best&quot;, he further added: &quot;There&#x27;s simply nothing here to get excited about. And what about that soul that these guys are boasting about, anyway?&quot;.

== Songs ==

According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, as of 2022, &quot;Songs About Jane&quot; is one of the 15 best-performing 21st-century albums without any of its singles being number-one hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

The opening track and first single, &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot;, released a month after the album released, slowly started to pick up airplay which helped spur sales of the album. &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot; also made the top 20 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles charts and the singles charts in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. In an interview with MTV News in August 2002, Maroon 5 vocalist Adam Levine, when asked behind the development of &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot;, admitted that the song describes the band&#x27;s frustration with their label, Octone Records, during the making of their debut album. The band thought they had enough material for a release, but when the label told them to keep writing, Levine wrote this song in frustration at the pressure. &quot;That song comes sheerly [sic] from wanting to throw something. It was the 11th hour, and the label wanted more songs. It was the last crack. I was just pissed. I wanted to make a record and the label was applying a lot of pressure, but I&#x27;m glad they did.&quot;

The second track, &quot;This Love&quot;, was also the second single from the album. It won the band their first Grammy Award, for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals at the 2006 Grammy Awards. In March 2004 the song reached the top 10 of the Australian and United States singles charts. The single&#x27;s accompanying music video proved to be popular as well, but had to be edited from its original version to avoid being banned from MTV. In an interview, Levine revealed that the song was written in the &quot;most emotionally trying time&quot; in his life. He also added, &quot;I was in a relationship that was ending, but I was really excited on the other end because the band was about to go make the record and I was ecstatic to go in the studio. She was literally leaving town within days of me writing the lyrics to &#x27;This Love&#x27;, so I was in prime emotional condition to write a song with that kind of conflict.&quot; The demo of the song features a guitar solo.

&quot;She Will Be Loved&quot;, the fourth track and third single from the album, also reached similar chart success as the band&#x27;s previous hits, hitting No. 1 on the Mainstream Top 40 and Adult Top 40 charts, and topping the Australian and Belgian charts and peaking at No. 5 in the United States, the same chart position of previous single and breakthrough hit, &quot;This Love&quot;. The song prompted many alternative radio outlets to remove Maroon 5 from their playlists, on the ground that the band&#x27;s newer songs were too light for alt-rock audiences. These stations continued to play &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot; and &quot;This Love&quot;, but Maroon 5&#x27;s newer hits were played only on pop and adult contemporary stations. As of June 2014, the song has sold more than 3.5 million copies in the United States.

&quot;Tangled&quot;, the fifth track, was never released as a single. It is another song about a broken relationship, but it&#x27;s from the point of view of the abuser, instead of the abused. Levine was confessing about certain things that he&#x27;s done in his love life that he may have regretted. Writers from Billboard rated the song low on their ranking of the album, saying &quot;While &#x27;Tangled&#x27; follows a similar formula to several Jane highlights, the energy here falls short, and could use some of the album&#x27;s more poppier inflections... The intention is there, but the execution falls flat.&quot; Though it wasn&#x27;t all negative, with some positive views: &quot;Levine does hit some soaring notes as he sings lyrics of regret; so don’t be surprised if you catch yourself mouthing the words.&quot;

The seventh track, &quot;Must Get Out&quot;, was released as the fifth and final single from the album. Like many songs on the album, it was written by band members Adam Levine and Jesse Carmichael, while production and mixing was done by Matt Wallace. The band&#x27;s guitarist James Valentine explained that the downtempo song emulates Andy Summers and The Police. Lyrically, &quot;Must Get Out&quot; expresses a tough period of a relationship, with a dreamy lyrical story, where the band &quot;offers up clever imagery with &#x27;I&#x27;ve been the needle and thread/Weaving figures eights and circles &#x27;round your head&#x27; and frank confessions to today&#x27;s problems, &#x27;The city&#x27;s made us crazy and we must get out&#x27;.&quot; The single failed to chart in the US, but made the Top 30 in the United Kingdom, Ireland and New Zealand.

&quot;Sunday Morning&quot;, the eighth track, was released as the fourth single. It did not reach the chart success of the previous singles, but nevertheless became a hit song and garnered positive reviews from critics. Although the song only peaked at number 31 in the US, it topped the charts in Belgium and reached the top forty in Australia, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, South Korea, and the UK. It was reported that this song was the one that got the band signed to Octone Records, with its executive Ben Berkman calling it &quot;genius&quot;. Unlike many other songs on the album, the relationship Levine describes isn’t full of the pain that’s echoed through the rest of the album. Instead, it captures the sweet and tender moments that can outweigh the bad, like waking up next to the one you love on a cold, rainy day.

=== Outtakes ===

Two songs that did not make the cut for the album did release eventually, with &quot;Woman&quot; appearing on the &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; soundtrack, and Ragdoll appearing as a B-Side and on the deluxe editions. A demo version of &quot;Woman&quot; appeared from the album&#x27;s 10th anniversary edition, was featured on the 2013 Victoria&#x27;s Secret swimwear video. Another song, &quot;That&#x27;s Not Enough&quot; was recorded for the album, but this recording has not been released. A demo for the song can be found online. The song &quot;Wasted Years&quot;, contrary to popular belief, was not written for &quot;Songs About Jane&quot;, but instead for the band&#x27;s eventual sophomore album. The song first appeared on the live album &quot;Live – Friday the 13th&quot;, and then later the deluxe edition of &quot;Overexposed&quot;. A demo of the song similar to the demos featured on the 10th Anniversary edition of this album was recorded by Adam Levine and Sam Farrar, but has not been released.

<text>Managerial economics is a branch of economics involving the application of economic methods in the organizational decision-making process. Economics is the study of the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. Managerial economics involves the use of economic theories and principles to make decisions regarding the allocation of scarce resources.
It guides managers in making decisions relating to the company&#x27;s customers, competitors, suppliers, and internal operations.

Managers use economic frameworks in order to optimize profits, resource allocation and the overall output of the firm, whilst improving efficiency and minimizing unproductive activities. These frameworks assist organizations to make rational, progressive decisions, by analyzing practical problems at both micro and macroeconomic levels. Managerial decisions involve forecasting (making decisions about the future), which involve levels of risk and uncertainty. However, the assistance of managerial economic techniques aid in informing managers in these decisions.

Managerial economists define managerial economics in several ways:
#It is the application of economic theory and methodology in business management practice.
#Focus on business efficiency.
#Defined as &quot;combining economic theory with business practice to facilitate management&#x27;s decision-making and forward-looking planning.&quot;
#Includes the use of an economic mindset to analyze business situations.
#Described as &quot;a fundamental discipline aimed at understanding and analyzing business decision problems&quot;.
#Is the study of the allocation of available resources by enterprises of other management units in the activities of that unit.
#Deal almost exclusively with those business situations that can be quantified and handled, or at least quantitatively approximated, in a model.
The two main purposes of managerial economics are:
# To optimize decision making when the firm is faced with problems or obstacles, with the consideration and application of macro and microeconomic theories and principles.
# To analyze the possible effects and implications of both short and long-term planning decisions on the revenue and profitability of the business.

The core principles that managerial economist use to achieve the above purposes are:
* monitoring operations management and performance,
* target or goal setting
* talent management and development.

In order to optimize economic decisions, the use of operations research, mathematical programming, strategic decision making, game theory and other computational methods are often involved. The methods listed above are typically used for making quantitate decisions by data analysis techniques.

The theory of Managerial Economics includes a focus on; incentives, business organization, biases, advertising, innovation, uncertainty, pricing, analytics, and competition. In other words, managerial economics is a combination of economics and managerial theory. It helps the manager in decision-making and acts as a link between practice and theory.
Furthermore, managerial economics provides the tools and techniques that allow managers to make the optimal decisions for any scenario.

Some examples of the types of problems that the tools provided by managerial economics can answer are:
* The price and quantity of a good or service that a business should produce.
* Whether to invest in training current staff or to look into the market.
* When to purchase or retire fleet equipment.
* Decisions regarding understanding the competition between two firms based on the motive of profit maximization.
* The impacts of consumer and competitor incentives on business decisions

Managerial economics is sometimes referred to as business economics and is a branch of economics that applies microeconomic analysis to decision methods of businesses or other management units to assist managers to make a wide array of multifaceted decisions. The calculation and quantitative analysis draws heavily from techniques such as regression analysis, correlation and calculus.

==Economic Theories relevant to Managerial Economics==

Microeconomics is the dominant focus behind managerial economics, some of the key aspects include:

* &quot;Supply and Demand&quot;

The law of supply and demand describes the relationship between producers and consumers of a product. The law suggests that price set by the producer and quantity demanded by a consumer are inversely proportional, meaning an increase in the price set is met by a reduction in demand by the consumer.
The law further describes that sellers will produce a larger quantity of the good if it sells at a higher price.

Excess demand exists when the quantity of a good demanded is greater than the quantity supplied. Where there is excess demand, sellers can benefit by increasing the price. The inverse applies to excess supply.

* &quot;Production theory&quot;

Production theory describes the quantity of a good a business chooses to produce. This decision is informed by a variety of factors, including raw material inputs, labor, and capital costs like machinery. The production theory states that a business will strive to employ the cheapest combination of inputs to produce the quantity demanded.
The production function can be described in its simplest form by the function formula_1 where denotes the firm&#x27;s production, is the variable inputs and is the fixed inputs.

* &quot;Opportunity cost&quot;

The opportunity cost of a choice is the foregone benefit of the second best choice. Determining the opportunity cost requires detailing the costs and benefits of each action the business is considering to pursue, and the cost of choosing one activity over another. The decision-maker is then in the position to choose the action with the highest payoff.

* &quot;Theory of Exchange or Price Theory&quot;

The principle uses the conjecture of supply and demand to set an accurate price for a good. The aim of price theory is to allocate a price for a good such that the supply of a good is met with equal demand for the product. If a manager sets the price of a good too high, the consumer may think it is not worth the cost and decide not to purchase the good, hence creating excess supply. The opposite occurs when the price is set too low, causing demand for a good to be greater than supply.

* &quot;Theory of Capital and Investment Decisions&quot;

Capital investment decisions are a critical factor in an enterprise. They involve determining the rational allocation of funds that will enable an organization to invest in profitable projects or enterprises to improve the efficiency of organizations.
The rational allocation of funds may include acquiring business, investing in equipment, or determining whether an investment will improve the business at all.

* &quot;Elasticity of demand&quot;

The elasticity of demand is a prominent concept in managerial economics. Established by Alfred Marshall, elasticity of demand describes how sensitive a change in the quantity demanded is given a unit change in price. In his own words, Marshall describes the concept as ‘The elasticity of demand in a market is great or small according to as the amount demanded increases much or little for a given fall in price and diminish much or little for a given rise in price.

The microeconomic principles are useful principles to inform manager&#x27;s decision making. Managerial economics draws upon all of these analytical tools to make informed business decisions.

==Analytical Methods used in Managerial Economics==

* &quot;Price Elasticity of Demand Analysis&quot;

The price elasticity of demand is a highly useful tool in managerial economics as it provides managers with the predicted change in demand associated with an increase in the price charged for its goods and services. The price elasticity principle also outlines the changes in demand for goods with changes in the income of a populous.

Where formula_3 is the change in quantity demand for the respective change in price formula_4, with and representing the quantity and price of the good before a change was made.
The price elasticity is important for managerial economics as it aids in the optimization of marginal revenue of firms.

* &quot;Marginal analysis&quot;

In economics, marginal refers to the change in revenue and cost by producing one extra unit of output. Both the marginal cost and marginal revenue are extremely important in economics as a firm&#x27;s profit is maximized when the marginal cost is equal to the marginal revenue. Managers can make business decisions on the output level based on this analysis in order to maximize the profit of the firm.

Marginal Analysis is considered the one of the chief tools in managerial economics which involves comparison between marginal benefits and marginal costs to come up with optimal variable decisions. Managerial economics uses explanatory variables such as output, price, product quality, advertising, and research and development to maximise net benefits.

* &quot;Mathematical model analysis&quot;

The use of econometric analysis has grown with the development of economics and management, as has the use of differential calculus to determine profit maximisation.

By taking the derivative of a function, the maximum and minimum values of the function are easily determined by setting the derivative equal to zero. This can be applied to a production function to find the quantity of production that maximizes the profit of the firm. This concept is important for managers to understand in order to minimize costs or maximize profits.

The main applications of mathematical models are:

* &quot;Demand forecasting&quot;. Before determining the scale of production of a certain product, enterprises need to forecast the development potential of the market. Relevant mathematical models can be created to represent the quantitative changes in the various factors affecting the development of the market, and then analyse the magnitude of the impact of these changes on demand.
* &quot;Production analysis&quot;. The input of production factors, the choice of the form of production organisation and the determination of the product structure can all be analysed and decided by creating mathematical models.
* &quot;Cost decision&quot;. Cost is a factor that directly affects profit, and is one of the most important concerns for enterprise development. An enterprise&#x27;s cost level can be determined by applying mathematical models. When an enterprise changes the direction of production and operation, or expands its scale these methods can help determine the optimal level under the goal of maximising profit. 
* &quot;Market analysis&quot;. The market is a fundamental concept in economics and in practice manifests itself in many different forms. Mathematical models can be created to analyse the size, price and competitive strategies that a company may choose under various market conditions.
* &quot;Risk analysis&quot;. Risk analysis is the prediction of future states. Mathematical models can be created to represent the magnitude of the various factors involved in an investment and the impact that changes in magnitude may have on the benefits.

==Decision Making in Managerial Economics==

As &quot;the application of economic theory and methods to business decision-making&quot;, managerial economics is fundamentally about making decisions. The discipline is partially prescriptive in nature because it suggests a course of action to a managerial problem. Managerial economics aims to provide the tools and techniques to make informed decisions to maximize the profits and minimize the losses of a firm. Managerial economics has use in many different business applications, although the most common focus areas are related to the risk, pricing, production and capital decisions a manager makes. Managers study managerial economics because it gives them the insight to control the operations of their organizations. Organizations will function well if managers rationally apply the principles that apply to economic behavior.
Managerial economics as a science

# &quot;Define the Problem&quot;The first step in making a business decision is to understand the problem in its entirety. Without correct analysis of the problem, any solution developed will be inadequate.Incorrect problem identification can sometimes cause the problem that is trying to be solved.
# &quot;Determine the Objective&quot;The second step is evaluating the objective of the decision, or what the decision is trying to achieve. This step is determining a possible solution to the problem defined in step 1. Multiple possible solutions to the problem previously identified may be established. 
# &quot;Discover the Alternatives&quot;After in depth analysis into what is required to solve the problem faced by a business, options for potential solutions can be collated.In most cases, more than one possible solution to the problem exists. For example, a business striving to gain more attraction on social media could improve the quality of their content, collaborate with other creators or a combination of the two.
# &quot;Forecast the Consequences&quot;This step involves assessing the consequences of the problem&#x27;s solutions detailed in step 3. Possible consequences of a business decisions could include; productivity, health, environmental impacts and risk.Here, managerial economics is used to determine the risks and potential financial consequences of an action.
# &quot;Make a Decision&quot;After the consequences and potential solutions to the problem at hand have been analyzed, a decision can be made. At this point, the potential decisions should be measurable values which have been quantified by managerial economics to maximise profits and minimise risk and adverse outcomes of the firm. This step includes a sensitivity analysis of the solution. A sensitivity analysis of the selected solution details how the output of the solution changes with changes to the inputs. The sensitivity analysis allows the strengths and weaknesses of the designed solution to be analyzed.

== Pricing ==
It is important to understand what pricing decisions should be made regarding the products and services of the firm. Efficient pricing is required to maintain desired levels of revenue and profit, whilst also maintaining customer satisfaction. Setting a price too low reduces profitability, negatively affects the perceived quality of the product, and sets an expectation of price for the consumer. Setting a price too high may negatively affect the image of an organisation from the perspective of the consumer.

Managers may price using intuitive or technocratic decision-making styles. A technocratic approach relies on quantitative analysis and optimisation, and typically involves a compensatory method of evaluation. Compensatory evaluation allows one attribute to compensate for another attribute. For example, a manager may price a product at a lower price to compensate for its lower quality. Intuitive decision-making relies on consumer heuristics, defined as cognitive processes of fast decision-making, which occur by limiting the amount of information analysed.

Economic concepts such as competitive advantage, market segmentation, and price discrimination are relevant to pricing strategy. In order to set a price that drives sales and firm performance, managers must understand the economic environment in which they are operating.

=== Price Discrimination ===

Price discrimination involves selling the same or similar good at different prices to different consumer segments. Consumer segments are separated by a significant variation in the amount they are willing to pay. In order for price discrimination to occur, firms must be able to separate customer segments according to differing price elasticities, have some market power and prevent customers from re-selling the product.

There are three classic types of price discrimination.

* &quot;First-degree price discrimination&quot; or perfect price discrimination occurs when firm&#x27;s can accurately determine what each buyer is willing to pay. However, in practice this strategy is difficult to achieve as it requires full knowledge of the demand curve.
* &quot;Second-degree price discrimination&quot; occurs when firms can price products or services differently according to the number of units bought. Examples include quantity discounting, bulk pricing and two-for-one offers.
* &quot;Third-degree price discrimination&quot; prices products or services differently based on the unique demographic of different groups. Examples of third-degree price discrimination are student or senior discounts, or discounted travel tickets for last-minute buys.
Additional forms of price discrimination include bundling, intrapersonal price discrimination and purchase-history price discrimination. A firm&#x27;s ability to price discriminate effectively can improve their profitability and/or increase their customer base, but only if the conditions required for price discrimination are met.

=== Psychology of Pricing ===
The Psychology of Pricing is used to understand how pricing affects consumers perception of goods and their willingness to consume. The way a good is priced has implications for the perceived value of that good. Firms can capitalise on consumers willingness to pay by influencing their price perception, reducing the pain of paying and exploiting switching costs.

Consumer&#x27;s price perception can be altered by priming a smaller number (e.g. pricing a good as $4.99 instead of $5), anchoring to a high reference price or separating costs into individual components (e.g. the price of the good and shipping cost).

Reducing the pain of paying involves strategies to minimise the psychological &quot;pain&quot; individuals feel when spending, due to human&#x27;s loss averse nature. These include timing strategies, like block payments or charging before consumption, and salience strategies like digital or artificial (e.g. tokens) payments.

Finally, by exploiting switching costs, firms can increase producer surplus and/or keep a larger market share. Switching costs &quot;result from a consumers desire for compatibility between a current purchase and previous investment&quot;. However, often consumers fail to switch to the optimal choice because of loss aversion, information deficiencies, procrastination, status-quo bias or endowment effects. This allows firms to exploit this behaviour through strategies such as honeymoon pricing (or introductory rates) and add-on pricing, which involves a cheaper initial purchase but more expensive replacement (like printers and cartridges).

The psychology of pricing provides an explanation for why consumption patterns don&#x27;t always cohere with the neoclassical understanding, which assumes price and consumption have an inverse relationship. The Snob Effect, Bandwagon Effect and Veblen Effect are three counter-examples to this assumption.

* &quot;The Snob Effect&quot; occurs when consumers reduce their consumption of a good when others begin consuming it. Have attached unique perceived value to the good, this value erodes as demand increases.
* The Bandwagon Effect is the inverse. Consumers want to consume what everyone else is and therefore value goods by perceived social value rather than price.
* Under &quot;the Veblen Effect&quot;, consumers accept price as an indication of value, and therefore consume more as the price increases.

== Consumer decision making (Theories and Biases) ==

In order to successfully make organisational decisions, management must have an understanding of consumer behaviour and decision-making. Consumer behaviour relates to buying, using and selling goods, services, time and ideas by decision-making units.

=== Rational Choice Theory ===

Rational Choice Theory is a decision-making theory, also known as the law-and-economics theory, which applies the assumption that people will try and maximise their outcomes, have well-defined preferences and are consistently rational decision-makers. This theory develops on the Economic Man Theory, which assumed that people respond to stimuli (external factors) to generate a response (outcome). Rational Choice Theory builds on this theory by understanding that the consumer is an information processing decision-maker, however, it fails to incorporate psychological literature and empirical findings on the psychology of human-behaviour.

Rational Choice Theory makes the following assumptions:

# Objective criteria exist to enable a consumer to determine rational choices from irrational choices.
# Organisations and Consumers have negligible behavioural differences.
# Consumers make decisions based on conscious consideration of factors.
# Consumers make decisions using rational considerations.
# Consumers decide from a stable set of preferences.
# Consumers aim to maximise their circumstances.
# In maximising their circumstances, consumers perform a risk assessment.
# Satisfaction is easily assessable.

These assumptions do not account for circumstances of human error where consumers misinterpret information, or only consider portions of relevant information. The assumption of rational choice theory that when provided with all the required information, consumers will make a rational decision is limited. Instead, understanding bounded rationality, a concept explored in behavioural economics, can assist firms and managers in decision making.

=== State-Dependent Preferences ===

Consumer preferences depend on the state the consumer is in when making the decision. For example, food tastes better when you are hungry or attending a concert is more enjoyable if you are not injured. Most models of state-dependant preferences assume people are aware of the effect their current state has on preference formation in that moment. However, empirical studies suggest this is not always true. Several biases help explain this incongruence.

* &quot;Projection bias&quot; occurs when consumers predict that their future tastes will represent their current tastes.
* &quot;Attribution bias&quot; occurs when consumers consider past experiences in deciding whether to repeat a previously performed consumption activity. This bias can lead to systematic errors in economic decisions.
* &quot;Status quo bias&quot; occurs when consumers would rather follow previous procedures, or buy previously used products, without evidence that this choice is better than alternatives. This bias opposes the basic law of human nature, that the most adaptable species is the one to survive, and is in opposition with positive views on change expressed in business literature.

=== Cognitive Biases ===
Beyond biases that influence state-dependent preferences, there is a whole host of cognitive biases that can shape consumer preferences and influence decision making. See cognitive biases for a full list. These biases can have real implications for the effectiveness of firms, public policies and choices generally.

== Incentives ==

Monetary and non-monetary incentives are used by managers to motivate employees to achieve results aligned with firms&#x27; objectives. The outcome of incentives depends on the design and the implementation process of the incentives, their interaction with intrinsic and social motivations, and the behavioural effects of their removal.

In a field experiment analyzing the effects of performance-based monetary incentives, it was shown that productivity improved in line with employees&#x27; ability, however, there was an increase in neglect of non-incentivised tasks.

Monetary incentives generally have two kinds of effects, known as the standard direct price effect, and the indirect psychological effect. The standard direct price effect makes incentivised behavior more attractive; and the indirect psychological effect makes incentivised behavior less appealing by relaying important information from principals (manager) to agents (worker) surrounding quality expectations, which can provoke unexpected behavioural outcomes.

Agents receive information from both the size and existence of incentives. For example, offering members of the community high monetary compensation to be in the presence of a nuclear waste site, indicates that there are high risks involved with the plant, making community members less willing to accept the plant even in the presence of monetary incentives. Contrarily, in a famous experiment, a childcare centre introduced a fee of $3 for parents who picked their children up late. The information conveyed to the parents from this incentive was that the small fine indicated being late is not too bad, and in the short run the number of late pick-ups increased. This information persisted when the fee was removed, and parents who had experienced the fine were more likely to pick their child up late than those who had not received the information given by the incentive.

As a general rule however, when incentives are high enough, the standard direct price effect tends to take precedence over the indirect psychological effect, unless incentives are so high that agents form a negative inference of the circumstances.

=== Pay disparity ===

Where workers are paid at a substantially lower rate to their peers, outputs and attendance can fall out of alignment with organisational objectives. Pay disparity can cause harm to an organisations social culture, cohesion and cooperation, and alter the workplace dynamic significantly. In developing countries where social interactions are heavily relied upon for economic activity, these effects are particularly undesirable. Evidence suggests these consequences can be avoided by clearly justifying pay inequality to workers. Potentially due to self-serving bias, workers are often unwilling to believe they perform at a lower standard than their peers unless shown undeniable evidence. Particularly in settings where employees do not trust their managers, workers may be inclined to suspect favouritism until they are given evidence and justifications.

Tournament theory is used to describe why different pay levels exist between different roles in the business hierarchy. The idea of tournament theory is that agents who put in effort to achieve promotions are rewarded with a higher, non-incremental, pay rate. The reward of a higher pay rate incentivizes behaviour that leads to promotions. This behaviour is often lucrative and therefore ideal for the business. Tournaments can be very powerful at incentivizing performance. Empirical research in economics and managements have shown that tournament-like incentive structure increases the individual performance of workers and managers in the workplace.

However, research has also shown that tournaments consistently disadvantage certain groups, such as women. The prevalence of tournament structured competitions for career progression provides an explanation for why women are often underrepresented in high positions. Other studies have investigated gender discrepancies in risk aversion, feedback aversion, overconfidence, self-perception of ability, negotiation skills and self-promotion as further explanations that can contribute to differences in pay despite uniform performance. Managers ability to identify the role of biases in perpetuating inequalities within the workplace can be instrumental in improving firm outcomes.

=== Game Theory ===
Game theory is the study where individuals study the different choices agents make with respect to their personal preferences, incentives and benefits.

==== Assumptions of game theory ====

# Common Knowledge: Common knowledge is the assumption that information presented in the game is known by all players taking part in the game.
# Rationality: The rational assumption is one where players are able to accurately weigh the cost and benefits of all the information presented subsequently making their decisions based on their assessment. Economic rationality in game theory is the assumption that the player ranks their assessments based on what would benefit them the most. Subsequently the player will choose the outcome as well as paths that best benefit themselves.

===== Strategies in Game Theory =====

# Best response: The best response is the strategy (or strategies) that yields the most favourable outcome for players, with the assumption that the players have been given other strategies.
# Nash Equilibrium: The nash equilibrium is the strategy where players have no incentive to deviate from their choices or behaviours.
# Dominant Strategy: The strategy where no matter what the other player plays the dominant strategy will always be superior producing and dictating the outcome. Strictly dominated strategy is a strategy where the other strategy chosen always results in a lousier outcome. Weakly dominated strategy is a strategy where it produces the lousier or equivalent outcom when compared to the outcome of the alternate strategy.

===== Examples of games in Game Theory =====

# Prisoners dilemma: The prisoner dilemma game provides economists with insights on disputes between individuals and group incentives that result in the outcomes being less than optimal.
# Simultaneous games: The simultaneous game is one where players make decisions at the same time.

== Demand Analysis and Forecasting ==

Demand forecasting assists management in predicting future sales and revenue projection, which inform operations and marketing decisions as well future financial planning. The process of demand forecasting often uses business analytics, particularly predictive analytics, with respect to historical data and other analytical information, to make an accurate estimation. For example, using an estimate of a firm&#x27;s capital expenditure and cash flow, managers can create forecasts that assist in financial planning and improve the financial health of the firm.

Effective demand management considers factors which are both within and beyond the firm&#x27;s control, such as disposable income, competition, price, advertising and customer service.

Consumer choice is highly influential on demand analysis, as each consumer aims to maximise their satisfaction with a combination of goods and services, subject to their personal budget constraint. Costs of production

Production costs directly affect a firm&#x27;s profitability. In order to maximise profits, firms identify the cost minimising output level for a firm where marginal cost equals marginal revenue. The most common types of costs that are factored into this decision include:
*Fixed costs
*Variable costs
*Marginal cost
*Average total cost 
*Sunk costs
The impact of short-run and long run costs are important in determining production in a certain firm
. It is assumed some costs are fixed in the short-run and are thus considered &quot;fixed costs&quot;. Thus production costs are determined by variable costs. However, in the long run, all costs are variable, which allows more flexibility in changing inputs to determine the optimal level of inputs for a profit maximising output.

== Profitability Management ==

Profitability management is understanding what makes a firm profitable, and what can be done to improve its profitability. It integrates finance and sales, and aims to optimize sales revenue and marginal cost of the firm. Profit management is technology enabled, as firms must be quick to respond to rapid changing market and to know the true economic cost of its products and services. Management needs to drive cooperation between different functions of the firm such as sales, marketing, and finance, to ensure the teams recognize the importance of coordinated effort. Proper planning and profitability management is key to good business management.

== Capital Management ==

Capital management is the planning, monitoring, and controlling of the assets and liabilities of a firm, particularly, in an effort to maintain cash flow to meet the firm&#x27;s short-term and long-term financial obligations. Proper capital management is important to the financial health of a firm, with efficient resource allocation through capital management, firms can improve its cash flow and profitability. Capital management involves tracking various ratios within the firm, most important ones include:

*Capital ratio
*Inventory turnover ratio
*Collection ratio

Rate of return and cost of capital (i.e. interest rate) are important factors of capital management.

==Implications of macroeconomics and microeconomics==

When making decisions, managerial economics is used to analyze the micro and macroeconomic environments relating to an organization. Microeconomics considers the actions of individual firms surrounding utility maximization, whilst Macroeconomics considers the actions and behaviour of the economy as a whole. As such, both area of economics have influence in the development of managerial economic frameworks.

=== Macroeconomics ===
With regard to macroeconomic trends, the forecasting and analysis of areas such as output, unemployment, inflation and societal issues are essential in managerial economics. This is because these areas in the macroeconomy have the ability to provide an overview of global market conditions, which can be imperative for managers to understand. 
An example of managerial economics using macroeconomic principles is a manager choosing to hire new staff rather than training old ones in a time where the rate of unemployment is high, as the possible talent pool would be very large. The political structure of a country (whether authoritarian or democratic), political stability and attitudes towards the private sector can also affect the growth and development of organizations. This can be seen through the influence different government policies can have on management quality. In particular, policies around product market competition has been seen to significantly impact collective management practices in countries by either reducing or supporting poorly managed firms. A clear understanding of relevant markets and their different conditions is a vital task for a managerial economist, as even with market instability and fluctuations the goal is to always steer the company to profits.

Managerial economics has components of microeconomics

Managers study and manage the internal environment of organisations and work for the profitability and long-term operation of the organisation. This aspect refers to the study of microeconomics. Managerial economics deals with the problems individual organisations face, such as the organisation&#x27;s main objectives, the demand for its products, the organisation&#x27;s price and output decisions, available substitutes and giveaways, the supply of inputs and raw materials, the target or potential consumers of its products, etc.

=== Microeconomics ===

Microeconomics is closely related to Managerial economics through areas such as; consumer demand and supply, opportunity cost, revenue creation and cost minimization. Managerial economics inculcates the application of microeconomics application and makes use of economic theories and methods in analyzing a business and its management. Moreover, managerial economics combines economic tool and technique to solve the managerial problems.

Microeconomics also gives indication on the most effective allocation of resources the business has available.
These microeconomic theories and considerations are used via managerial economics to make decisions regarding the business. By understanding the principles of microeconomics, managers can be well informed to make accurate decisions regarding the firm.

An example of managerial economics using microeconomic principles is the decision of a manager to increase the price of the goods being sold. A manager should evaluate the price elasticity of the product to equate the respective demand of the product after the price change.

==Managerial economics in practice==

From a management perspective, managerial economics techniques are useful in many areas regarding business decision-making, most commonly including:

* Risk analysis – various models are used to quantify risk and asymmetric information and to employ them in decision rules to manage risk.
* Production analysis – microeconomic techniques are used to analyze production efficiency, optimum factor allocation, costs, economies of scale and to estimate the firm&#x27;s cost function.
* Pricing analysis – microeconomic techniques are used to analyze various pricing decisions including transfer pricing, joint product pricing, price discrimination, price elasticity estimations, and choosing the optimum pricing method.
* Capital budgeting – investment theory is used to examine a firm&#x27;s capital purchasing decisions.

<doc id="523107" wikidata="Q2289233" url="?curid=523107" title="Singh">
<text>Singh (: ) is a title, middle name, or surname that means &quot;lion&quot; in various South Asian and Southeast Asian communities. Traditionally used by the Hindu Kshatriya community, it was later mandated in the late 17th century by Guru Gobind Singh (born Gobind Das) for all male Sikhs as well, in part as a rejection of caste-based prejudice and to emulate Rajput naming conventions. As a surname or a middle name, it is now found throughout the world across communities and religious groups, becoming more of a generic, caste-neutral, decorative name—similar to names such as Kumar and Lal.

== Etymology and variations ==
The word &quot;Singh&quot; is derived from the Sanskrit word सिंह (IAST: siṃha) meaning &quot;lion&quot;, and is used to convey a &quot;hero&quot; or &quot;eminent person&quot;.

Several variants of the word are found in other languages:
* In Tibetan, it is written as སིང་ with the same pronunciation (Sing).
* In Tamil, the word for lion is Singham or Singhe written as சிங்க, also derived from Sanskrit.
* In Burmese, it is spelled သီဟ (&quot;thiha&quot;), derived from the Pali variant &quot;siha.&quot;
* In Urdu, it is written as with the same pronunciation as Hindi. Variations include Simha and Sinha in Bihar.
* In Indonesian, it is written as Singa and it means lion.

== History ==

Originally, the Sanskrit word for lion, variously transliterated as Simha or Singh, was used as a title by Kshatriya warriors in northern parts of India. The earliest recorded examples of names ending with &quot;Simha&quot; are the names of the two sons of Rudraraman, who ruled the Western Satraps in the second century CE. Jayasimha, the first ruler of the Chalukya dynasty to bear the title Simha, ruled around 500 CE. The Vengi branch of the Chalukyas continued using Simha as a last name until the eleventh century. The Rajputs started using Singh in preference to the classical epithet of &quot;Varman&quot;. Among the Rajputs, the use of the word Singh came into vogue among the Paramaras of Malwa in 10th century CE, among the Guhilots and the Kachwahas of Narwar in the 12th century CE, and the Rathores of Marwar after the 17th century.

By the sixteenth century, &quot;Singh&quot; had become a popular surname among Rajputs. It was adopted by the Sikhs in 1699, as per the instructions of Guru Gobind Singh. Singh is used by all baptized male Sikhs, regardless of their geographical or cultural binding; the women use Kaur. Guru Gobind Singh introduced the surname &quot;Singh&quot; for Sikh men to foster equality and unity within the community. This move aimed to eliminate caste distinctions and promote a fearless and righteous identity. By adopting &quot;Singh,&quot; Sikh men were encouraged to live as saint-soldiers, embodying courage, justice, and a commitment to serving humanity, According to Pashaura Singh, the Guru gave male Sikhs the name &quot;Singh&quot;, which was associated with aristocracy, to imitate the traditions of the Rajput hill chiefs near Anandpur Sahib.

In the 18th century, several groups started using the title &quot;Singh&quot;. These included the Brahmins, the Kayasthas and the Baniyas of what are now Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. In the 19th century, even the Bengal court peons of the lower castes adopted the title &quot;Singh&quot;. Bhumihars, who originally used Brahmin surnames, also started affixing Singh to their names. In Bihar and Jharkhand, the surname came to be associated with power and authority, and was adopted by people of multiple castes, including Brahmin zamindars. Citing Kshatriya status, numerous communities use &#x27;Singh&#x27; as part of their names. Some Jains have also adopted the surname in addition to various Hindu castes.

Many Muslim Shins historically used the surname &quot;Sing&quot;, the earlier form of the name, &quot;Simha&quot;, was frequently appended to names found in the Gilgit Manuscripts, a corpus of Buddhist texts and the oldest surviving manuscripts in India, discovered in the Gilgit region of Kashmir.

People belonging to several other castes and communities also started using Singh as a title, middle name or a surname; these include non-Sikh Punjabis, Charans, Yadavs, Gurjars, Brahmins, Marathas, Jats, Kushwahas, Rajpurohits, Kumawats etc. Dalit and other backward groups have also adopted the name, including the Bhils, Koeris, and Dusadhs. The name is also found among the Indian diaspora.

== Usage ==

&quot;Singh&quot; is generally used as a surname or as a middle name/title. When used as a middle name, it is generally followed by the caste, clan or family name. To reduce caste discrimination, some Sikhs append &quot;Khalsa&quot; or their native village names to Singh.

Originally, a common practice among the Rajput men was to have &quot;Singh&quot; as their last name, while Rajput women had the last name &#x27;Kanwar&#x27;. However, now, many Rajput women have Singh in their name as well.

=== Nepal ===
Singh is a common name in Nepal; the appellation has acquired caste-neutral status due to its wide scale adoption by many members of Nepali society. Some notable examples of Nepalis with the middle name/surname Singh are:
Amar Singh Thapa, Ranodip Singh, and Pratap Singh Shah.

=== Outside South Asia ===
Singh is a common Hindu name in Guyana. Some Indian immigrants to British Guiana are believed to have adopted surnames traditionally associated with high caste status, including Sharma and Tiwari (Brahmin), as well as Singh (Kshatriya).

A section of around a million adherents of Sikhism that live abroad in Western countries only keep Singh or Kaur as their last name. This has caused legal problems in immigration procedures, especially in Canada. For a decade, the Canadian High Commission in New Delhi stated in letters to its Sikh clients that &quot;the names Kaur and Singh do not qualify for the purpose of immigration to Canada&quot;, requiring people with these surnames to adopt new ones. The ban was denounced by the Sikh community, after which the Citizenship and Immigration Canada announced it was dropping the policy, calling the whole issue a misunderstanding based on a &quot;poorly worded&quot; letter.

<doc id="523111" wikidata="Q334323" url="?curid=523111" title="Ouyang Xiu">
<text>Ouyang Xiu (; 1007 – 1072 CE), courtesy name Yongshu, also known by his art names Zuiweng () and Liu Yi Jushi (), was a Chinese historian, calligrapher, epigrapher, essayist, poet, and politician of the Song dynasty. He was a renowned writer among his contemporaries and is considered the central figure of the Eight Masters of the Tang and Song. He revived the Classical Prose Movement (first begun by the two Tang dynasty masters two centuries before him) and promoted it in imperial examinations, paving the way for future masters like Su Shi and Su Zhe.

Ouyang Xiu&#x27;s interests as a writer were remarkably diverse. As a historian, he was put in charge by Emperor Renzong of Song of creating the &quot;New Book of Tang&quot;, which was completed in 1060 CE. He also wrote in his spare time the &quot;Historical Records of the Five Dynasties&quot;, the only book in the Twenty-Four Histories to have been written in private by a single author. As a poet, he was a noted writer of both the &quot;cí&quot; and &quot;shi&quot; genres. But it was his prose writings like &quot;Zuiwengting Ji&quot; that won him the greatest acclaim. Treatises from Ouyang&#x27;s voluminous œuvre range from studies of flowers to literary criticism and political commentaries.

Politically, Ouyang Xiu was one of the major proponents of the Qingli Reforms of the 1040s. When lead reformer Fan Zhongyan fell from power in 1045 CE, Ouyang was also demoted to posts away from the capital. He returned to the central government only in 1054, and gradually moved up the bureaucratic ladder again, until in 1060 he was made the assistant councilor of the state. He retired from politics in 1071, after vehemently (and unsuccessfully) opposing the New Policies of Wang Anshi, whose career he very much helped.

==Early life==
He was born in Sichuan, where his father was a judge, though his family came from present-day Jishui (then known as Luling), Jiangxi. His family was relatively poor, not coming from one of the old great lineages of Chinese society. Losing his father when he was three, his literate mother was responsible for much of his early education; her method is the origin of the chengyu (&quot;a mother&#x27;s admirable dedication to the education of her children&quot;). He was unable to afford traditional tutoring and was largely self-taught. The writings of Han Yu were particularly influential in his development. He passed the &quot;jinshi&quot; degree exam in 1030 on his third attempt at the age of 22.

==Official career==
After passing the &quot;jinshi&quot; exam, he was appointed to a judgeship in Luoyang, the old Tang dynasty eastern capital. While there, he found others with his interest in the writings of Han Yu. Politically, he was an early patron of the political reformer Wang Anshi, but later became one of his strongest opponents. At court, he was both much loved and deeply resented at the same time.

In 1034 he was appointed to be a collator of texts at the Imperial Academy in Kaifeng where he was associated with Fan Zhongyan, who was the prefect of Kaifeng. Fan was demoted, however, after criticizing the Chief Councillor and submitting reform proposals. Ouyang was later demoted as well for his defense of Fan, an action that brought him to the attention of other reform-minded people.

Military threats from the Liao dynasty and Xi Xia in the north in 1040 caused Fan Zhongyan to come back into favor. Fan offered Ouyang a post as secretary, but Ouyang refused. Instead, in 1041 Ouyang obtained a position preparing a catalogue of the Imperial Library.

1043 was the high point in the first half of the eleventh century for reformers. Ouyang and Fan spurred the Qingli Reforms, a ten-point reform platform. Among other things, these included improved entrance examinations for government service, elimination of favouritism in government appointments, and increased salaries. They were able to implement some of these ideas in what was later called the Minor Reform of 1043, but the emperor rescinded their changes and Fan and his group fell from power. Ouyang was demoted to service in the provinces. He returned briefly to court in 1049 but was forced to serve a two-year sabbatical during the mourning period for his mother, who died in 1052.

Upon his return to government service, he was appointed to the Hanlin Academy, charged with heading the commission compiling the &quot;New Book of Tang&quot; (1060). He also served as Song ambassador to the Liao on annual visits and served as examiner of the &quot;jinshi&quot; examinations, working on improving them in the process.

In the early 1060s, he was one of the most powerful men in court, concurrently holding the positions of Assistant Chief Councillor, Hanlin Academician, Vice Commissioner of Military Affairs, and Vice Minister of Revenues.

Around the time of the ascension of Emperor Shenzong of Song in 1067, Ouyang was charged with several crimes, including having sexual relations with his daughter-in-law. While the charges had no credibility, the investigation alone damaged Ouyang&#x27;s reputation. His request to retire was declined by the emperor, who sent him to magistrate positions in Shandong and Anhui. While a magistrate in Shandong, he opposed and refused to carry out reforms advocated by Wang Anshi, particularly a system of low-interest loans to farmers. He was finally permitted to retire in 1071.

==Prose==
In his prose works, he followed the example of Han Yu, promoting the Classical Prose Movement. While posted in Luoyang, Ouyang founded a group who made his “ancient prose” style a public cause. He is listed as one of the Eight Masters of the Tang and Song.

Among his most famous prose works is the &quot;Zuiwengting Ji&quot; (). The Zuiweng Pavilion near Chuzhou is named in his honor whilst the poem is a description of his pastoral lifestyle among the mountains, rivers and people of Chuzhou. The work is lyrical in its quality and acclaimed as one of the highest achievements of Chinese travel writing. Chinese commentators in the centuries immediately following the work&#x27;s composition focused on the nature of the writing. Huang Zhen said that the essay is an example of &quot;using writing to play around&quot;. It was agreed that the essay was about &quot;fengyue&quot;, the enjoyment of nature. During the Qing dynasty, however, commentators began to see past the playfulness of the piece to the thorough and sincere joy that the author found in the joy of others.

==Historian==

Ouyang led the commission compiling the &quot;New Book of Tang&quot;, which completed its work in 1060. He wrote &quot;New History of the Five Dynasties&quot; on his own following his official service. The book was not discovered until after his death.

As a historian, he has been criticised as overly didactic, but he played an important role in establishing the use of epigraphy as a historiographic technique. Epigraphy, as well as the practice of calligraphy, figured in Ouyang&#x27;s contributions to Confucian aesthetics. In his &quot;Record of the Eastern Study&quot; he states how literary minded gentlemen might utilize their leisure to nourish their mental state. The practice of calligraphy and the appreciation of associated art objects were integral to this Daoist-like transformation of intellectual life.

The Ming dynasty writer Feng Menglong recorded a possibly apocryphal anecdote regarding Ouyang&#x27;s writing style in his collection of short stories &quot;Gujin Tan&#x27;gai&quot; (). As the story goes, during one of Ouyang&#x27;s trips outside the Hanlin Academy with his associates, they witnessed an unusual event: a horse became spooked, galloped down a busy street, and kicked to death a dog sleeping there. Ouyang challenged his two associates to express this event in writing. One wrote: &quot;A dog was lying in the thoroughfare and was kicked to death by a galloping horse,&quot; while the other wrote: &quot;A horse galloped down a thoroughfare. A lying dog encountered it and was killed.&quot; Ouyang teased his junior colleagues, &quot;A history book in your hands would remain incomplete after ten thousand volumes.&quot; When asked for his own rendering, Ouyang, replying with a smile, wrote: &quot;A galloping horse killed a dog in its path.&quot;

==Poetry==
His poems are generally relaxed, humorous and often self-deprecatory; he gave himself the title &quot;The Old Drunkard&quot;. He wrote both &quot;shi&quot; and &quot;cí&quot;. His &quot;shi&quot; are stripped down to the essentials emphasised in the early Tang period, eschewing the ornate style of the late Tang. He is best known, however, for his &quot;cí&quot;. In particular, his series of ten poems entitled &quot;West Lake Is Good&quot; set to the tune &quot;Picking Mulberries&quot; helped to popularise the genre as a vehicle for serious poetry.

Ouyang&#x27;s poetry, especially the mature works of the 1050s, dealt with new themes that previous poets had avoided. These include interactions with friends, family life, food and beverages, antiques, and political themes. He also used an innovative style containing elements that he had learned from his prose writing. This includes his use of self-caricature and exaggeration. Ouyang&#x27;s poetry bears the characteristic of literary playfulness common to Northern Song poetry. For example, many poems have titles that indicate that they originated in rhyme games, and feature extensive rhyming schemes throughout. Below is one of the many poems Ouyang Xiu wrote about the famed West Lake in Hangzhou.

==Legacy==
He died in 1072 in present-day Fuyang, Anhui. His influence was so great, even opponents like Wang Anshi wrote moving tributes on his behalf. Wang referred to him as the greatest literary figure of his age.

During the Ming dynasty, Li Dongyang, who rose to be the highest official in the Hanlin Academy, was an admirer of Ouyang Xiu, regarding him as &quot;an ideal example of the scholar-official committed to both public service and literary art&quot;, and praising his writings for their tranquility and propriety.

<text>A cost-of-living index is a theoretical price index that measures relative cost of living over time or regions. It is an index that measures differences in the price of goods and services, and allows for substitutions with other items as prices vary.

There are many different methodologies that have been developed to approximate cost-of-living indexes. A Konüs index is a type of cost-of-living index that uses an expenditure function such as one used in assessing expected compensating variation. The expected indirect utility is equated in both periods.

==Application to price index theory==
The United States Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a price index that is based on the idea of a cost-of-living index. The U.S. Department of Labor&#x27;s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) explains the differences:
The CPI frequently is called a cost-of-living index, but it differs in important ways from a complete cost-of-living measure. BLS has for some time used a cost-of-living framework in making practical decisions about questions that arise in constructing the CPI. A cost-of-living index is a conceptual measurement goal, however, not a straightforward alternative to the CPI. A cost-of-living index would measure changes over time in the amount that consumers need to spend to reach a certain utility level or standard of living. Both the CPI and a cost-of-living index would reflect changes in the prices of goods and services, such as food and clothing that are directly purchased in the marketplace; but a complete cost-of-living index would go beyond this to also take into account changes in other governmental or environmental factors that affect consumers&#x27; well-being. It is very difficult to determine the proper treatment of public goods, such as safety and education, and other broad concerns, such as health, water quality, and crime that would constitute a complete cost-of-living framework.

==Economic theory==
The basis for the theory behind the cost-of-living index is attributed to Russian economist A. A. Konüs. The theory assumes that consumers are optimizers and get as much utility as possible from the money that they have to spend. These assumptions can be shown to lead to a &quot;consumer&#x27;s cost function&quot;, &quot;C&quot;(&quot;u&quot;,&quot;p&quot;), the cost of achieving utility level &quot;u&quot; given a set of prices &quot;p&quot;. Assuming that the cost function holds across time (i.e., people get the same amount of utility from one set of purchases in year as they would have buying the same set in a different year) leads to a &quot;true cost of living index&quot;. The general form for Konüs&#x27;s true cost-of-living index compares the consumer&#x27;s cost function given the prices in one year with the consumer&#x27;s cost function given the prices in a different year:

:formula_1

Since &quot;u&quot; can be defined as the utility received from a set of goods measured in quantity, &quot;q&quot;, &quot;u&quot; can be replaced with &quot;f&quot;(&quot;q&quot;) to produce a version of the true cost of living index that is based on price and quantities like most other price indices:

:formula_2

In simpler terms, the true cost-of-living index is the cost of achieving a certain level of utility (or standard of living) in one year relative to the cost of achieving the same level the next year.

Utility is not directly measurable, so the true cost of living index only serves as a theoretical ideal, not a practical price index formula. However, more practical formulas can be evaluated based on their relationship to the true cost of living index. One of the most commonly used formulas for consumer price indices, the Laspeyres price index, compares the cost of what a consumer bought in one time period (q0) with how much it would have cost to buy the same set of goods and services in a later period. Since the utility from q0 in the first year should be equal to the utility from q0 in the next year, Laspeyres gives the upper bound for the true cost-of-living index. Laspeyres only serves as an upper bound, because consumers could turn to substitute goods for those goods that have gotten more expensive and achieved the same level of utility from q0 for a lower cost. In contrast, a Paasche price index uses the cost of a set of goods purchased in one time period with the cost it would have taken to buy the same set of goods in an earlier time period. It can be shown that the Paasche is a lower bound for true cost of living index. Since upper and lower bounds of the true cost of living index can be found, respectively, through the Laspeyres and Paasche indices, the geometric average of the two, known as the Fisher price index, is a close approximation of the true cost of living index if the upper and lower bounds are not too far apart.

<text>The Hansaviertel () is the smallest &quot;Ortsteil&quot; (district) of Berlin and is between Großer Tiergarten and the Spree River, within the central Mitte borough of Berlin.

The district was almost completely destroyed during World War II but was rebuilt from 1957 to 1961 as a social housing project by international master architects such as Alvar Aalto, Egon Eiermann, Walter Gropius, Oscar Niemeyer, and Sep Ruf. Called &quot;Interbau&quot;, the whole ensemble has two churches (St. Ansgar and Kaiser-Friedrich-Gedächtniskirche). It is now protected as a historic monument.

==History==
The area&#x27;s streets are named after &quot;Hansa cities&quot;; cities that were part of the Hanseatic League, a trading network established in the Middle Ages. &quot;Hansaplatz&quot;, the central square, has a small shopping arcade, a library and the Grips-Theater. Hansaplatz subway station was built in 1957, though the U9 line did not open until 1961. Some Gründerzeit buildings remained north of the Stadtbahn railway. Altonaer Straße, named after the Altona district in Hamburg, leads to the Victory Column. Bellevue Palace, the residence of the German president is nearby.

==Hansaplatz==
Right beside the U-bahn train station is Hansaplatz square. Now an unremarkable traffic junction, this was an active plaza before the war.

<text>The Alabama Council for Technology in Education (ACTE) was founded in the early 1980s, to promote general education and knowledge of technology for Alabama students in grades 3–12, in many areas ranging from computer literacy to video production.

==Background==
The ACTE comprises eight regions throughout Alabama: North East, North West, North Central, East Central, West Central, Central, South East and South West. These regions hold annual Regional Technology fairs whereby the winners go to the State Fair in Montgomery to compete in fourteen competition categories.

The largest of the regional fairs is the jointly-held South East and South West Regional fair that is held at the Faulkner State College campus in Bay Minette, Alabama.

Over 200 schools throughout Alabama are part of the ACTE.</text><links>

<text>Rory Elizabeth Katherine Kennedy (born December 12, 1968) is an American documentary filmmaker. Kennedy has made documentary films that center on social issues such as addiction, her opposition to nuclear power, the treatment of prisoners-of-war, and the politics of the Mexican border fence. 

She is the youngest child of U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy and Ethel Kennedy. 

==Early life and education==

Rory Elizabeth Katherine Kennedy was born on December 12, 1968, at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C., to parents Robert F. Kennedy, a former United States Attorney General, U.S. Senator, and 1968 U.S. presidential candidate, and his wife Ethel Kennedy. She was born six months after her father was shot and killed. Her mother chose her name &quot;Rory&quot; after the last high king of Ireland, Rory O&#x27;Connor, who ruled in the 12th century.

On December 19, 1968, a week after Rory was born, her mother took her to her father&#x27;s grave at Arlington National Cemetery. Kennedy&#x27;s older brother Michael LeMoyne Kennedy was assigned as her godparent by their mother. In December 1997, she tried to resuscitate her brother Michael after a skiing accident in Aspen, Colorado, which was fatal. Friends of the Kennedy family said Rory and Michael spoke almost every day of their lives.

When Rory was a teenager, she was arrested during a protest outside the South African Embassy. When she was 15, her 28-year-old brother David died from a drug overdose. Rory graduated from Madeira School in McLean, Virginia, and then Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. During her sophomore year at Brown, Rory organized a rally in front of a Providence supermarket. In solidarity with migrant farm workers, she urged shoppers to boycott grapes.

==Career==
In the 1990s, Kennedy and fellow Brown classmate Vanessa Vadim (daughter of Roger Vadim and Jane Fonda) formed May Day Media, a non-profit organization based in Washington, D.C., that specializes in the production and distribution of films with a social conscience. &quot;Women of Substance&quot; was Kennedy&#x27;s first documentary. The film was released in 1994, and the idea came out of a paper about female addicts that she wrote while a student at Brown. In 1998, Kennedy and another fellow Brown graduate Liz Garbus founded Moxie Firecracker Films, which specializes in documentaries that highlight pressing social issues. The television networks that have shown its films include: A&amp;E, the UK&#x27;s Channel 4, Court TV, Discovery Channel, HBO, Lifetime, MTV, Oxygen, PBS, Sundance Channel, and TLC.

She directed and co-produced &quot;American Hollow&quot; (1999), a film about a struggling Appalachian family that received critical acclaim and many awards. HBO broadcast the film and publisher Little, Brown and Company simultaneously released Kennedy&#x27;s companion book. Kennedy presented the documentary at Wittenberg University on September 13, 2001.
In October 2001, Kennedy traveled to Cleveland, Ohio, to address the opening meeting of the National Council of Jewish Women. At the meeting, she spoke about her documentary film-production company &quot;Change the World Through Film&quot;.

Kennedy directed and co-produced the Emmy Award-nominated series &quot;Pandemic: Facing AIDS&quot; (2003), which premiered at the International AIDS Conference in Barcelona, Spain, on July 8, 2002. It was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and tells the stories of AIDS patients outside the Western world. It was broadcast in America as a five-part series on HBO in June 2003.

Kennedy directed and co-produced &quot;A Boy&#x27;s Life&quot; (2004), the story of a young boy and his family in rural Mississippi. The movie premiered at the 2003 Tribeca Film Festival and was awarded the Best Documentary prize at the Woodstock Film Festival; it was later broadcast on HBO.

When Kennedy was asked in a March 24, 2004, interview with &quot;Salon&quot; about her interest in the American South, she cited her father&#x27;s experiences in the region as an inspiration and starting point. In the same article, she goes on to mention that showing class differences in American culture also motivates her.

She directed and co-produced &quot;Indian Point: Imagining the Unimaginable&quot; (2004) for HBO, which was broadcast on September 9, 2004. The film takes a &quot;what if&quot; look at the catastrophic consequences of a radioactive release at the Indian Point Energy Center, a three-unit nuclear-power plant station, located north of midtown Manhattan, New York City, New York.

Kennedy directed and co-produced &quot;Homestead Strike&quot; (2006) as part of The History Channel&#x27;s series, &quot;10 Days that Unexpectedly Changed America&quot; (April 2006).

She was a co-executive producer for &quot;Street Fight&quot; (2005), which chronicles the 2002 Newark, New Jersey, unsuccessful mayoral campaign of Democratic Cory Booker — then a Newark Municipal Councilman — against Democratic eighteen-year incumbent Mayor Sharpe James. The film earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary (Feature). (Booker later won the mayoral election on May 9, 2006, against Democratic Ronald Rice; James did not seek re-election for another four-year term in 2006.)

Kennedy directed and co-produced &quot;Ghosts of Abu Ghraib&quot; (2007), which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and won the 2007 Primetime Emmy Award for Best Documentary. Kennedy first learned of the Abu Ghraib prison practices when images came out in the media, which were accompanied by a &quot;New Yorker&quot; article by Seymour Hersh. According to Kennedy, she was &quot;horrified and shocked and disgusted&quot; by the images of the naked prisoners and laughing American soldiers. She conducted interviews with people who were present at the prison along with those directly involved in the abuse. Kennedy&#x27;s opinion of the participants changed after she interviewed them, when she began feeling they &quot;were very humane and very much like me&quot; and discovered they &quot;were not monsters.&quot;

She directed &quot;Thank You, Mr. President: Helen Thomas at the White House&quot; for HBO Documentary Films, which premiered on HBO on August 18, 2008. According to reviews, the 40-minute-long documentary provided an interesting, though brief, glimpse into the iconic journalist.

On June 30, 2009, Kennedy was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

Kennedy directed &quot;The Fence (La Barda)&quot;, which premiered at the opening night of The Sundance Film Festival 2010. The film made its debut on HBO on September 16, 2010. Favorably received, it details the woeful inadequacies of the border fence between the United States and Mexico, which has increased migrants&#x27; deaths, but does not deter illegal immigration.

In 2011, she produced and directed &quot;Ethel&quot;, which was a documentary about her mother. The movie premiered at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival and aired on HBO on October 18, 2012. Reviews portrayed the documentary as a moving tribute, but criticized its lack of depth. Kennedy conducted interviews with her siblings over five days at the Kennedy family compound in Hyannis Port. For the finished film, she went through &quot;some 100 hours&quot; of archive footage, photos and home videos.
&quot;Last Days in Vietnam&quot; was directed by Kennedy and co-produced with Keven McAlester; the documentary film debuted at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2014. During production of the film, she spoke with U.S. military and Vietnam nationals now in the U.S. and said the most exciting part of the film to her was &quot;telling the untold stories about Americans and Vietnamese who were on the ground, who went against U.S. policy and risked their lives to save Vietnamese&quot;. Kennedy was reported to have signed with production company Nonfiction Unlimited in May 2014. In September 2014, &quot;Last Days in Vietnam&quot; opened at the Nuart Theater in Los Angeles. Kennedy had difficulty getting some of the people featured in her film to get involved. Out of them, she believed Henry Kissinger had the most reluctance to the project. On their reluctance, Kennedy stated: &quot;I think a lot of those folks suffered post-traumatic stress from that moment. When I asked them to relive it, it really took a toll. Many of the people told me it took them a week to recover from the interviews. I&#x27;ve gotten tons of emails from people in Vietnam who can&#x27;t see the film because it&#x27;s too traumatic for them.&quot; &quot;Last Days in Vietnam&quot; was nominated as Best Documentary Feature for the 87th Academy Awards.

In 2024, Kennedy directed and produced &quot;The Synanon Fix&quot; a documentary series revolving around Synanon for HBO.

In early 2024, Film Training Manitoba based in Winnipeg, Canada announced Kennedy as the distinguished speaker for the Manitoba Film Master Series which took place at the Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology (MITT). The Film Master Series included a session with Kennedy instructing specifically for women, non-binary, and Trans participants.

==Activism and politics==
Kennedy advocates for several social activism organizations and sits on the board of numerous non-profit organizations. In March 2010, Kennedy gave a presentation at The Ritz-Carlton, where she spoke on the effects of alcohol and drug abuse and concluded that addiction and domestic violence &quot;are intricately connected.&quot; She also voiced her support of treatment options, calling them &quot;more important than the criminal justice approach&quot;. Executive director and CEO of Comprehensive Alcoholism Rehabilitation Programs Robert Bozzone agreed with her opinion and added, &quot;If you listen to Rory, treatment is more effective than incarceration.&quot; Referring to the shooting of Michael Brown, Kennedy believed the reason it garnered national media attention &quot;is that it&#x27;s a touch point that indicates a larger social challenge that we all need to mull over and try to grapple with in a thoughtful and considerate way, and I think it has to do both with race and class.&quot;

Kennedy announced her support of Barack Obama as the Democratic Party&#x27;s nominee in the 2008 U.S. presidential election in an op-ed essay, &quot;Two fine choices, one clear decision - Obama&quot;. She endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016.

On January 11, 2019, Kennedy co-authored a Rolling Stone opinion piece with Red Hot Chili Peppers singer Anthony Kiedis and the Malibu Foundation&#x27;s Trevor Neilson on the current climate crisis. Also in 2019, Kennedy co-founded the Climate Emergency Fund along with Getty family heiress Aileen Getty. The fund has distributed over $4 million to several environmental activist organizations including Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil.

On April 1st, 2024, during an appearance on Good Morning America to promote her new docuseries, &quot;The Synanon Fix&quot;, Kennedy expressed her wish that voters in the 2024 United States presidential election not vote for her brother, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., to avoid pulling Democrat votes away from Joe Biden. She endorsed Biden&#x27;s candidacy, making the announcement in April 2024 alongside five additional siblings of her and Robert. 

After Biden dropped out, Kennedy endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris&#x27;s campaign, after their siblings denounced her brother Robert Jr.&#x27;s decision to endorse former President Donald Trump, calling the move a &quot;betrayal.&quot;

==Personal life==
Following college graduation, Kennedy moved to New York and then briefly to Los Angeles.
Kennedy&#x27;s brother Michael LeMoyne Kennedy died in December 1997 as a result of a skiing accident. She was with him at the time of the accident and tried to save his life by giving him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Despite her efforts, he had been fatally injured. Kennedy attended his funeral in January 1998.

On August 2, 1999, Kennedy married Mark Bailey in Greece at the mansion of shipping tycoon Vardis Vardinoyiannis. Kennedy met Bailey in Washington through mutual friends after graduating from Brown University. The wedding was originally scheduled for July 17 in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, but was postponed after the plane piloted by her cousin John F. Kennedy, Jr. and passengers Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy (his wife) and her sister, Lauren Bessette crashed en route to the event. The tent erected for the wedding instead became a site for family prayers during the search for her cousin.

In October 1999, Kennedy and her husband moved to a new home in a West Village neighborhood they reportedly loved.

Kennedy and her husband have two daughters and a son.

Around the time of the birth of her second daughter in 2004, Kennedy and her husband purchased a home. Kennedy went on maternity leave from her filmmaking career for the birth of her son in 2007. She sold her Shelter Island home in December 2009.

According to Trulia.com, Kennedy purchased a home in Malibu, California, in January 2013 and currently resides there.

== Public image ==
Prior to the 1990s, Kennedy was said to have been known solely for being the child who was born after the assassination of her father, Robert F. Kennedy. Following the plane crash of her cousin John F. Kennedy, Jr., she established notability for being the cousin whose wedding he planned to attend. Anita Gates of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Kennedy would understandably want to be known as &quot;the one who became a filmmaker.&quot;

Edward Klein wrote in his book &quot;The Kennedy Curse: Why Tragedy Has Haunted America&#x27;s First Family for 150 Years&quot; that Rory Kennedy &quot;had suffered more from the Kennedy Curse than any other member of the family.&quot; Klein then listed the deaths of her father and brother David, as well as her role in unsuccessfully attempting to save the life of her brother Michael Kennedy.

Kennedy has spoken of her work and its relation to that of her father. &quot;I don&#x27;t think of it as a continuation of his work, but I certainly think I was influenced by the person that he was and have made a range of choices because of what he contributed to the world. I have enormous respect for all that he accomplished in his short life and how much he was able to move people and touch people. I&#x27;ve certainly been inspired by that.&quot; On January 14, 2010, Full Frame announced Kennedy and Liz Garbus would be the recipients of that year&#x27;s Career Award. In the press release, Full Frame called the duo&#x27;s work &quot;unique&quot;.

<text>Robert Taylor Homes was a public housing project in the Bronzeville neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago, Illinois from 1962 to 2007. The largest housing project in the United States, it consisted of 28 virtually identical high-rises, set out in a linear plan for two miles (3 km), with the high-rises regularly configured in a horseshoe shape of three in each block. It was located along State Street between Pershing Road (39th Street) and 54th Street, east of the Dan Ryan Expressway. The project was named for Robert Rochon Taylor (1899–1957), an African-American activist and the first African American chairman of the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA). It was a part of the State Street Corridor which included other CHA housing projects: Stateway Gardens, Dearborn Homes, Harold Ickes Homes, and Hilliard Homes.

==History==
Robert Taylor Homes were completed in 1962 and named for Robert Rochon Taylor (1899–1957), an African American activist and Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) board member who in 1950 resigned when the city council refused to endorse potential building locations throughout the city of Chicago that would induce racially integrated housing.
At one time, it was the largest public housing development in the country, and it was intended to offer decent affordable housing. It was composed of 28 high-rise buildings with 16 stories each, with a total of 4,415 units, mostly arranged in U-shaped clusters of three, stretching for two miles (three kilometers). It could hold over 27,000 residents.

==Problems==
The Robert Taylor Homes faced many of the same problems that doomed other high-rise housing projects in Chicago such as Cabrini–Green. These problems included drug dealing, drug abuse, gang violence, and the perpetuation of poverty. Planned for 11,000 inhabitants, the Robert Taylor Homes housed up to a peak of 27,000 people. Six of the poorest US census areas with populations above 2,500 were found there. Including children who are not of working age, at one point 95 percent of the housing development&#x27;s 27,000 residents were unemployed and listed public assistance as their only income source, and 40 percent of the households were single-parent, female-headed households earning less than $5,000 per year. About 96 percent were African-American. The concrete high-rises, many with the scars of arson fire, sat in a narrow stretch of slum. Neglect was evident in littered streets, poorly enforced building codes and scant commercial or civic amenities. Aside from neglect and ignoring crime, police officers also felt unsafe in darkened hallways and were frequently shot at from the high rises. In the Robert Taylor Homes a survey was conducted and showed that the majority of residents either had a family member in prison or expected one to return from prison within two years. This caused issues when residents tried to relocate; many of these returning prisoners had partners, children and/or mental illnesses that prevented them from relocating to another residence.

===Gang violence and drugs===
The Mickey Cobras (MC&#x27;s), Gangster Disciples (GDs), and Black Disciples (BDs) gangs dominated the housing project. Police intelligence sources say that the elevated number of homicides was the result of gang &quot;s&quot;, as gang members and drug dealers fought over control of given Chicago neighborhoods. The CHA estimated that $45,000 in drug deals took place daily. Former residents of the Robert Taylor Homes have said that the drug dealers fought for control of the buildings. In one weekend, more than 300 separate shooting incidents were reported in the vicinity of the Robert Taylor Homes. Twenty-eight people were killed during the same weekend, with 26 of the 28 incidents believed to be gang-related.

===Crime===
Numerous crimes occurred in the Robert Taylor Homes, reaching an all–time high in the mid–1970s. Most crimes committed at the housing project were drug and street gang violence related. In October 1976, 22–year-old Denise Dozier was thrown from a 15th floor apartment window; she survived the incident. On June 25, 1983, 18 month-old Vinyette Teague was abducted from the project after her grandmother left her alone in the hallway for a few minutes to answer a phone call. An estimated 50 people were in the hallway at the time of the abduction, but police were unable to gather enough evidence to make any arrests. She has never been seen or heard from since. On August 15, 1991, shortly before midnight, CHA police officer Jimmie Haynes was fatally wounded by a sniper rifle at the project. He died two days later at Mercy Hospital and Medical Center. Three suspects were charged with his murder. A maintenance worker at the project was beaten to death by gang members after he allowed police officers access to a building where a gang meeting was taking place in February 1993.

==Redevelopment==
In 1993, it was decided to replace all Robert Taylor Homes with a mixed-income community in low-rise buildings as part of a federal block grant received for the purpose from the HOPE VI federal program. In 1996, HOPE VI federal funds were granted specifically for off-site Taylor replacement housing. The Chicago Housing Authority moved out all residents by the end of 2005. On March 8, 2007, the last remaining building was demolished. As of 2007, a total of 2,300 low-rise residential homes and apartments, seven new and renovated community facilities, and a number of retail and commercial spaces are to be built in place of the old high-rise buildings. The development costs are expected to total an estimated $583 million. Part of the redevelopment is the renaming of the area to &quot;Legends South&quot;.

==Notable residents==
The Robert Taylor Homes were also home at one time to:
* Mr. T (Lawrence Tureaud), actor and former wrestler.
* Kirby Puckett, baseball player.
* Deval Patrick, 71st Governor of Massachusetts.
*Corey Holcomb, comedian and actor.
*Open Mike Eagle, Hip-hop artist.
* Ronnie Lester, University of Iowa All American, NBA Player for Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Lakers, NBA Scout for Los Angeles Lakers and Phoenix Suns.
*Beauty Turner, writer and community activist.
*Maurice Cheeks, basketball player.
*Skee-Lo (Antoine Roundtree), american rapper and producer.
*Kenny Duckworth, Kendrick Lamar&#x27;s father.
*Michael Colyar, comedian and actor.
*Derrius Quarles, Entrepreneur and author

==Research==
Because of the standardized housing and near homogeneous demographics, the RTH cluster was an ideal location for studying the effects of urban living and lack of &quot;green space&quot; on the human condition. This type of research in environmental psychology was most clearly demonstrated by a group of studies done by Frances Kuo and William Sullivan of the Landscape and Human Health Laboratory (formerly the Human-Environment Research Laboratory) at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. The history and economy of this housing development was studied by Sudhir Alladi Venkatesh in his book &quot;American Project&quot; (). In his 2008 book &quot;Gang Leader For A Day: A Rogue Sociologist Takes To The Streets&quot; (), Venkatesh also profiled the area, its residents and the &quot;Black Kings&quot;, a Chicago gang known for selling drugs. The &quot;Black Kings&quot; were renamed for the book to preserve anonymity, although it is likely referential to the Gangster Disciples. Although not about the Robert Taylor Homes, author Alex Kotlowitz wrote about the Chicago Housing Authority, the demographics and the history of the Chicago Housing projects in his book &quot;There Are No Children Here&quot; (). The book discusses the Henry Horner Homes, but also looks at and discusses the issues within the entire area. The housing development was the subject of a PBS documentary called &quot;Crisis On Federal Street&quot; which aired nationally in August 1987.

<text>The term Khalsa refers to both a community that follows Sikhism as its religion, as well as a special group of initiated Sikhs. The &quot;Khalsa&quot; tradition was initiated in 1699 by the Tenth Guru of Sikhism, Guru Gobind Singh. Its formation was a key event in the history of Sikhism. The founding of Khalsa is celebrated by Sikhs during the festival of Vaisakhi.

Guru Gobind Singh started the &quot;Khalsa&quot; tradition after his father, Guru Tegh Bahadur, was beheaded during the rule of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb after the Hindu Brahmins requested for his help to save their religion. Guru Gobind Singh created and initiated the Khalsa as a warrior with a duty to protect the innocent from religious persecution. The founding of the &quot;Khalsa&quot; started a new phase in the Sikh tradition. It formulated an initiation ceremony (&quot;amrit sanskar&quot;, nectar ceremony) and rules of conduct for the &quot;Khalsa&quot; warriors. It created a new institution for the temporal leadership of the Sikhs, replacing the earlier &quot;Masand&quot; system. Additionally, the &quot;Khalsa&quot; provided a political and religious vision for the Sikh community.

Upon initiation, a male Sikh was given the title of Singh meaning &quot;lion&quot;. Kaur was made the sole, compulsory identifier for female Sikhs in the twentieth century. The rules of life include a behavioural code called &quot;Rahit.&quot; Some rules are no tobacco, no intoxicants, no adultery, no Kutha meat, no modification of hair on the body, and a dress code (Five Ks).

==Etymology==
&quot;Khalsa&quot;, is derived from the Arabic word &quot;Khalis&quot; which means &quot;to be pure, to be clear, to be free from, to be sincere, to be true, to be straight, to be solid&quot;.

Sikhism emerged in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent (now parts of Pakistan and India). During the Mughal empire rule, according to professor Eleanor Nesbitt, &quot;Khalsa&quot; originally meant the land that was possessed directly by the emperor, which was different from &quot;jagir&quot; land granted to lords in exchange for a promise of loyalty and annual tribute to the emperor.

Prior to Guru Gobind Singh, the religious organization was organized through the &quot;masands&quot; or agents. The &quot;masands&quot; would collect revenue from rural regions for the Sikh cause, much like &quot;jagirs&quot; would for the Islamic emperor. The &quot;Khalsa&quot;, in Sikhism, came to mean pure loyalty to the Guru, and not to the intermediary &quot;masands&quot; who were increasingly becoming corrupt, states Nesbitt.

==Background==
The word &quot;Khalsa&quot; as used by Sikhs first finds mentions in the &quot;hukamnamas&quot; issued during the guruship tenure of Guru Hargobind, where he references the congregation of the east as being the &quot;Khalsa of the guru&quot;. A later hukamnama issued by Guru Tegh Bahadur refers to the local Sikh congregation of Pattan Farid as being &#x27;Guru ji ka Khalsa&#x27; (&quot;Khalsa of the guru&quot;). In a hukamnama of Guru Gobind Singh dated to 25 April 1699, he refers to a congregation of local Sikhs of Bhai Gurdas Bhagte Phaphre village as &#x27;sangat sahlang&#x27;, with the &#x27;sahlang&#x27; term being a different designation from that of a Khalsa. According to the &quot;Dabestan-e Mazaheb&quot;, the &#x27;sahlang&#x27; term referred to person(s) initiated into the Sikh religion by a masand, who acted as representatives on behalf of the Sikh gurus. Such Sikhs were termed as &quot;meli&quot; or &quot;masandia&quot;, and were differentiated from Sikhs who had received their initiation rites directly from a Sikh guru, whom were termed as &quot;Khalsa&quot;. Whilst extant hukamnamas of Guru Gobind Singh from the period of 1699 to 1707 refer to local Sikh congregations or individual Sikhs as being the guru&#x27;s Khalsa (often with the phrase &#x27;&quot;Sarbat sangat mera Khalsa hai&quot;&#x27; meaning &quot;the entire congregation is my Khalsa&quot;), with the coming of the end of a personal guruship, Guru Gobind Singh would then issue a hukamnama to the Sikh congregation of Varanasi on 3 February 1708 that referred to them as being &quot;&#x27;Waheguru ji ka Khalsa&quot;&#x27; (&quot;Khalsa of Waheguru&quot;).

The term &quot;Khalsa&quot; in Sikhism predates the events of Vaisakhi in 1699. Before the formalization of the Khalsa Panth in April 1699, the term Khalsa referred to a very special Sikh who was held in high esteem and considered as being close to the Guru. The Khalsa Panth&#x27;s formalization in 1699 essentially opened this restricted class of Sikhs as a possibility to attain for the wider congregation. During the period of Banda Singh Bahadur, two extant hukamnamas of Banda that were issued to the Sikh congregations of Bhai Rupa and Jaunpur refer to them as being &#x27;&quot;Akal Purakh jio da Khalsa&quot;&#x27; (meaning &quot;the Khalsa of the Immortal Being&quot;). With the later hukamnamas of Guru Gobind Singh&#x27;s widowed wives, Mata Sundari and Mata Sahib Devan, of which there are around a dozen issued variously between the years 1717–1732, the Khalsa is also described as belonging to the supreme god, termed as &quot;Akal Purakh&quot;. By the time the Akal Takht began to issue hukamnamas, referring to itself as &quot;&#x27;Sat Sri Akal Purakh ji ka Khalsa&quot;&#x27;, the phrase &#x27;Waheguru ji ka Khalsa&#x27; had already been established in common Sikh parlence to refer to specific people or a collective.

The Sikhs faced religious persecution during the Mughal Empire rule. Guru Arjan Dev, the fifth Guru, was arrested and executed by Mughal Emperor Jahangir in 1606. The following Guru, Guru Hargobind formally militarised the Sikhs and emphasised the complementary nature of the temporal power and spiritual power. In 1675, Guru Tegh Bahadur, the ninth Guru of the Sikhs and the father of Guru Gobind Singh was executed by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb for resisting religious persecution of non-Muslims, and for refusing to convert to Islam. Guru Gobind Singh&#x27;s sons were killed since they refused to convert to Islam.

==Foundation==

In 1699, the tenth Guru of Sikhism, Guru Gobind Singh asked Sikhs to gather at Anandpur Sahib on 13 April 1699, the day of Vaisakhi, the annual harvest festival. Guru Gobind Singh addressed the congregation from the entryway of a tent pitched on a hill, now called Kesgarh Sahib. He drew his sword, according to the Sikh tradition, and then asked for a volunteer from those who gathered, someone willing to sacrifice his head. One came forward, whom he took inside a tent. The Guru returned to the crowd without the volunteer, but with a bloody sword.

He asked for another volunteer and repeated the same process of returning from the tent without anyone and with a bloodied sword four more times. After the fifth volunteer went with him into the tent, the Guru returned with all five volunteers, all safe. Rather, the Guru had slaughtered 5 goats from which the blood had appeared. He called the volunteers the &quot;Panj Pyare&quot; and the first Khalsa in the Sikh tradition. These five volunteers were: Daya Ram (Bhai Daya Singh), Dharam Das (Bhai Dharam Singh), Himmat Rai (Bhai Himmat Singh), Mohkam Chand (Bhai Mohkam Singh), and Sahib Chand (Bhai Sahib Singh). 

Guru Gobind Singh then mixed water and sugar into an iron bowl, stirring it with a double-edged sword while reciting Gurbani to prepare what he called Amrit (&quot;nectar&quot;). He then administered this to the &quot;Panj Pyare&quot;, accompanied by recitations from the Adi Granth, thus founding the &quot;khanda ki pahul&quot; (baptism ceremony) of a Khalsa – a warrior community. After the first five Khalsa had been baptized, the Guru asked the five to baptize him as a Khalsa. This made the Guru the sixth Khalsa, and his name changed from Guru Gobind Rai to Guru Gobind Singh.

Around 80,000 men were initiated into the Khalsa order in a few days after its formalization on 13 April 1699.

He introduced ideas that indirectly challenged the discriminatory taxes imposed by Islamic authorities. For example, Aurangzeb had imposed taxes on non-Muslims that were collected from the Sikhs as well, for example the jizya (poll tax on non-Muslims), pilgrim tax and &quot;Bhaddar&quot; tax – the last being a tax to be paid by anyone following the Hindu ritual of shaving the head after the death of a loved one and cremation. Guru Gobind Singh declared that Khalsa does not need to continue this practice, because &quot;Bhaddar&quot; is not dharam, but a &quot;bharam&quot; (illusion). Not shaving the head also meant not having to pay the taxes of Sikhs who lived in Delhi and other parts of the Mughal Empire. However, the new code of conduct also led to internal disagreements between Sikhs in the 18th century, particularly between the Nanakpanthi and the Khalsa.

Guru Gobind Singh had a deep respect for the Khalsa, and stated that there is no difference between the True Guru and the &quot;Sangat&quot; (panth). Before he found the Khalsa, the Sikh movement had used the Sanskrit word &quot;Sisya&quot; (literally, disciple or student), but the favored term thereafter became Khalsa. Additionally, before the Khalsa, the Sikh congregations across India had a system of &quot;Masands&quot; appointed by the Sikh Gurus. The &quot;Masands&quot; led the local Sikh communities, and local temples collected wealth and donations for the Sikh cause.

Guru Gobind Singh concluded that the &quot;Masands&quot; system had become corrupt, he abolished them and introduced a more centralized system with the help of Khalsa that was under his direct supervision. These developments created two groups of Sikhs, those who initiated as Khalsa, and others who remained Sikhs but did not undertake the initiation. The Khalsa Sikhs saw themselves as a separate religious entity, while the Nanak-panthi Sikhs retained their different perspective.

The Khalsa warrior community tradition started by Guru Gobind Singh has contributed to modern scholarly debate on pluralism within Sikhism. His tradition has survived into modern times, with initiated Sikhs referred to as Khalsa Sikhs, while those who do not get baptized are referred to as Sahajdhari Sikhs.

==Dress and code of conduct==
Guru Gobind Singh initiated the Five K&#x27;s tradition of the Khalsa,
* Kesh: uncut hair.
* Kangha: a wooden comb.
* Kara: an iron or steel bracelet worn on the wrist.
* Kirpan: a sword or dagger.
* Kachera: short breeches.

He also announced a code of discipline for Khalsa warriors. Tobacco, eating meat slaughtered according to Muslim ritual and sexual intercourse with any person other than a spouse were forbidden. The Khalsas also agreed to never interact with those who followed rivals or their successors. The co-initiation of men and women from different castes into the ranks of Khalsa also institutionalized the principle of equality in Sikhism regardless of one&#x27;s caste or gender. According to Owen and Sambhi, Guru Gobind Singh&#x27;s significance to the Sikh tradition has been very important, as he institutionalized the Khalsa, resisted the ongoing persecution by the Mughal Empire, and continued &quot;defense of Sikhism and Hinduism against the Muslim assault of Aurangzeb&quot;.

According to the Sikh Code of Conduct (Sikh Rehat Maryada), Amritdhari Khalsa Sikh men must wear a turban and the 5 K&#x27;s. Baptized women are not required to tie a turban, and it remains a personal choice. It also clearly states that it is not appropriate for Sikh women to cover their faces with any type of veil as practiced in the Indian, Islamic, or Judeo-Christian traditions. Piercing of the nose or ears for wearing ornaments is forbidden for Sikh men and women. Sikhs cannot wear any token of any other faith. Sikhs must not have their head bare or wear caps. They also cannot wear any ornaments piercing through any part of the body.

===Prohibitions===
The four prohibitions or mandatory restrictions of the Khalsa or life of Khalsa at the time of Guru Gobind Singh are:

# Not to disturb the natural growth of the hairs.
# Not to eat the Kutha meat.
# Not to cohabit with a person other than one&#x27;s spouse.
# Not to use tobacco, alcohol or any type of drugs.

A Khalsa who breaks any code of conduct is no longer a Khalsa and is excommunicated from the Khalsa Panth and must go and &#x27;pesh&#x27; (get baptized again). Guru Gobind Singh also gave the Khalsa 52 hukams or 52 specific additional guidelines while living in Nanded in 1708.

== Guruship of the Khalsa (Guru Panth) ==
The guruship of the collective Khalsa, as realized through the collective body of &quot;committed&quot; &quot;Amritdharis&quot; (baptized Sikhs), is known as the &quot;Guru Panth&quot;. The Sikh Rehat Maryada states &quot;The Guru Panth (Panth’s status of Guruhood) means the whole body of committed baptized Sikhs. This body was fostered by all the ten Gurus and the tenth Guru gave it its final shape and invested it with Guruhood&quot;. A Khalsa Sikh is expected to go above-and-beyond duties such as partaking in the &quot;langar&quot; service, &quot;seva&quot;, or fanning the &quot;chaur sahib&quot; (fly-whisk) in-congregation. A Khalsa Sikh is also expected to materialize their life as &quot;benevolent exertion&quot; that secures the most good with the most minimal intervention, realized through &quot;collective action&quot;. Thus, a Sikh not only has individualistic duties, but also duties relating to the collective of the Khalsa, as the Sikh is one unit of the &quot;Guru Panth&quot;.

The Khalsa is considered equal to the Guru in Sikhism.

The five men, known as the Panj Pyare or the Five Beloved Ones, were baptized by the Guru and given the title of Singh, which means lion. They were then given the Amrit, a mixture of sugar and water stirred with a sword, and were asked to drink it. The significance of the Khalsa is reflected in the fact that Guru Gobind Singh considered it his equal. He allowed the Panj Pyare to give him Tankah, or punishment. There are instances where this occurred, as reported in the &quot;Suraj Prakash&quot;.

Guru Gobind Singh demonstrated his respect for the Panj Pyare by bowing down to them and asking them to baptize him. This act is known as the Pahul ceremony or Amrit Sanchar, and it is still performed in Sikhism today. The Guru&#x27;s act of bowing down to the Panj Pyare was a symbolic gesture of the Guru&#x27;s humility and his recognition of the Panj Pyare&#x27;s spiritual authority as being equal to his own.

The Panj Pyare, in turn, demonstrated their loyalty to the Guru by baptizing him and giving him the title of Singh, as well as still revering him as the Guru. This act was a recognition of the Guru&#x27;s spiritual authority and his commitment to the principles of Sikhism. The Panj Pyare were not just the Guru&#x27;s disciples; they were also his equals (collectively) and his companions in the struggle for justice and equality. Guru Gobind Singh wrote two famous excerpts collectively known as the &quot;Khalsa Mahima,&quot; which can be found in the &quot;Dasam Granth,&quot; and &quot;Sarbloh Granth.&quot; Below is an excerpt of the &quot;Khalsa Mahima&quot; from the Sarbloh Granth:

ਖ਼ਾਲਸਾ ਮੇਰੀ ਜਾਤ ਅਰ ਪਤ॥ ਖ਼ਾਲਸਾ ਸੋ ਮਾ ਕੋ ਉਤਪਤ॥ ਖ਼ਾਲਸਾ ਮੇਰੋ ਭਵਨ ਭੰਡਾਰਾ॥ ਖ਼ਾਲਸੇ ਕਰ ਮੇਰੋ ਸਤਿਕਾਰਾ॥ ਖ਼ਾਲਸਾ ਮੇਰੋ ਸਵਜਨ ਪਰਵਾਰਾ॥ ਖ਼ਾਲਸਾ ਮੇਰੋ ਕਰਤ ਉਧਾਰਾ॥ ਖ਼ਾਲਸਾ ਮੇਰੋ ਪਿੰਡ ਪਰਾਨ॥ ਖ਼ਾਲਸਾ ਮੇਰੀ ਜਾਨ ਕੀ ਜਾਨ॥

&quot;romanized: xālasā merī jāt ara pata. xālasā so mā ko utapata. xālasā mero bhavana bhaṇḍārā. xālasā kara mero satikārā. xālasā mero savajana paravārā. xālasā mero karata udhārā. xālasā mero piṇḍa parāna. xālasā merī jāna kī jāna.&quot;

Translation: Khalsa is my caste &amp; creed. Because of the Khalsa, I was born. Khalsa is my world treasure. Because of the Khalsa, I have respect. Khalsa is my close family. Khalsa grants me favours. Khalsa is my body and soul. Khalsa is the breath of my life.

- Sri Manglacharan Purana, pages 519–524, &quot;Khalsa Mero Rup Hai Khas&quot;

The famous contemporary Writer, Bhai Gurdas Singh (Not to be confused with Bhai Gurdas), notes in his book of compositions, or &quot;vāran:&quot;

ਵਾਹਵਾਹਗੋਬਿੰਦਸਿੰਘਆਪੇਗੁਰੁਚੇਲਾ॥੧॥

&quot;vāha-vāha-gobinda-singh-āpe-guru-celā ||1||&quot;

Hail, hail (Guru) Gobind Singh; He, Himself, is the Master and Disciple too.

- Bhai Gurdas Singh Ji Vaaran

Whilst Guru Gobind Singh passed on the mantle of guruship to both the &quot;Guru Granth&quot; and &quot;Guru Panth&quot;, the practice of Guru Panth was prevalent in the 18th century during the era of the Sikh Confederacy but fell into obscurity during the rise of Ranjit Singh. Today, the Guru Panth is rarely evoked, being overshadowed by the more popular &quot;Guru Granth&quot;.

== Martiality ==

A Khalsa is enjoined, to be honest, treat everyone as equal, meditate on God, maintain his fidelity, resist tyranny and religious persecution of oneself and others.

One of the duties of the Khalsa is to practice arms. This has been deemed necessary due to the rising persecution of the rulers. Before joining the Khalsa, most of the people were from professions like farming, pottery, masonry, carpenters, Labanas, etc.

Guru Gobind Singh in Oct 1708 deputed his disciple Banda Singh Bahadur to lead the Khalsa in an uprising against the Mughals. Banda Singh Bahadur first established a Sikh republic and then brought in the land reforms in the form of breaking up large estates and distributing the land to peasants. He and his comrades were eventually defeated and executed, but he became an icon among the Sikhs. After a long exile the Khalsa regrouped under Nawab Kapur Singh, who gathered local Khalsa leaders and created &quot;Dal Khalsa&quot;, a coalition army. The Dal Khalsa fought against the Mughals and the Afghans, eventually resulting in the establishment of a number of small aristocratic republics called misls (autonomous confederacies) and later in the formation of the Sikh Empire.

After the fall of the Mughal Empire and the later establishment of the Sikh Empire in Punjab, the Khalsa was converted into a strong, multi-religious and multinational fighting force, modernized according to European principles: the Sikh Khalsa Army which had a huge role in the expansion of the empire. Led by generals like: Maharaja Ranjit Singh himself, Misr Diwan Chand and Hari Singh Nalwa. It successfully defeated all its adversaries, including the Afghan tribals and army, Hill Chiefs, Misldars, Chinese, Tibeans and Gorkhas. By the time of death of the Maharaja Ranjit Singh in 1839, the whole army of Sikh Empire was assessed at 120,000 men, with 250 artillery pieces. The irregular levies were included.

The official name of the state (Sikh Empire) of Sikhs was &quot;Sarkar-i-Khalsa&quot;: Government of the Khalsa. The boundaries of this state stretched from Tibet to Afghanistan and from Kashmir to Sutlej in the south and included regions of Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Kashmir, Ladakh, etc. The &quot;Sarkar-i-Khalsa&quot; was dissolved during two wars fought against the British between 1846 and 1849.

==Initiation==
Initiation into the Khalsa is referred to as Amrit Sanchar (water of immortality life-cycle rite) or Khande di Pahul (Initiation with the double edged sword). Anyone from any previous religion, age, caste, or knowledge group can take Amrit (Amrit Chhakh) when they are convinced that they are ready. This baptism is done by the Panj Pyare in front of the Guru Granth Sahib. The devotee must arrive at the place of baptism, usually a Gurdwara, in the morning after bathing completely including having washed their hair and must be wearing the 5 articles of the Khalsa uniform.

After baptism, the new Singh or Kaur must abide by the four restrictions or must get re-baptised if they break any of them.

=== Initiation of women ===

The initiation of women did not receive mainstream acceptance until the emergence of the Singh Sabha Movement in the twentieth century. Rehat-namas produced shortly after the Khalsa&#x27;s inauguration are exclusively addressed to men, and communicate various notions surrounding women. Although they do not explicitly negate a woman&#x27;s place in the Khalsa, the exhortations and directives within them are interpreted by scholars such as W. H. McLeod and Doris Jakobsh as women being ancillaries to the initiated men, as opposed to having a formal role. They mandate men to respect women in the same manner that is rendered to their mother, prohibit violence against them, cursing them, and engaging in extramarital affairs. They further regard women as innately untrustworthy never to be confided in or relied on. Men were to partake in righteous warfare and protect their families, whereas women were expected to be housewives raising their children and providing service for their husbands. Early Sikh texts either omitted any mention of directives concerning the initiation of women or rejected it; an exception to this norm was the &quot;Chaupa Singh Rahit-nama&quot; which explicitly forbade a woman&#x27;s initiation conducted through the khanda ceremony; they were to instead receive charan amrit. W.H. McLeod notes that while the tenor of the rahitnamas marked the milieu of the 18th century and into the time of Ranjit Singh, some progress had occurred in the mid nineteenth century; Joseph Davey Cunningham, in 1849, reported that some women had received initiation conducted through a single edged sword, as opposed to the customary double edged one. The Tat Khalsa, concerned about the marginal presence of women in the Khalsa tradition and identity, led nascent efforts in the 1900s to allow women the same initiation as men, which was later emphatically advocated for and codified in the Sikh Rehat Maryada. According to Jaspal Kaur Singh, the baptism of women and the bestowal of &quot;Kaur&quot; was incipient only during the colonial period, during which the Tat Khalsa sought to combat perceived threats to Sikhism, both from Christian missionaries and Arya Samaj proselytization, by removing &quot;Hinduized&quot; and &quot;un-Sikh&quot; cultural and religious practices from within their fold and introducing egalitarian practices to the fore of the religion.

Gilbert Lewis, an anthropologist, wrote that the rigid delimitation between men and women in the praxis of the Khalsa stemmed from a need to enhance esotericism within their institution and create a tightly bonded brotherhood ready to deal with the harsh exigencies of war and defence. This also manifested through the disparity between male and female naming conventions as prescribed by Guru Gobind Singh; men were mandated the compulsory identifier of &quot;Singh&quot;, whereas women received no such dictum.

Nikky-Guninder Kaur Singh, in her explication of the inauguration of the Khalsa, maintained that women were allowed into the Khalsa and received the title of &quot;Kaur&quot;, which she purports was congruent with and indicative of the inherent egalitarianism of the Sikh tradition. Her claims were criticized by Doris Jakobsh who argued that her work revealed the effectiveness and pervasiveness of the Singh Sabha&#x27;s interpolations. Jacob Copeman, an anthropologist, described Singh&#x27;s analysis as deliberately elusive, clearly presenting itself at the level of mythos, and based on the recovery of lost potentials. Jakobsh contends that the initiation of women into the Khalsa originated with the Namdharis, who during the British Raj, were particularly active in preaching for the upliftment of women and against pervading social taboos. She further posits that as the military ethos of the Sikhs reached its apogee under the mandate of Guru Gobind Singh, women were concomitantly made to undertake more traditional roles. She cites tales from the Dasam Granth and rahit-namas to support her hypothesis; women were often depicted as seducers and thus inhibited men from attaining the warrior-saint status that the Guru wanted to inculcate in his order. According to Merry Wiesner-Hanks, as the influence of the Khalsa grew, women and those not in the Khalsa brotherhood were relegated to secondary status in the Sikh community.

J. S. Grewal considers Jakobsh to be fascinated by the &quot;theology of difference,&quot; and oversimplifying the issue; Gurinder Singh Mann, not attributing the &quot;Charitropakhyan&quot; to Guru Gobind Singh, considers both the analyses of Nikky Singh and Jakobsh to be lopsided, as in his view they both glean selectively from the Dasam Granth.

==Initial tensions with the non-Khalsa disciples==
With the creation of Khalsa, Guru Gobind Singh abolished all existing social divisions in line with the teachings of Guru Nanak Dev. In their new order, the former lowest of the low would stand with the former highest; all would become one and drink from the same vessel. All previous beliefs relating to family, occupation, customs and ceremonies were declared useless by the Guru. This caused discomfort to the conservative followers of the Guru and they protested. Many departed from the ceremony, but the Guru declared that the low castes should be raised and would dwell next to him.

Sri Gur Sobha (18th century) by Senapati contains two sections (&quot;adhyays&quot;) on the controversies that arose, when Guru Gobind Singh&#x27;s disciples in Delhi heard the news of his new order. Much of the controversy stated in &quot;Sri Gur Sobha&quot; revolves around &quot;bhaddar&quot;, the ritual shaving of the head after the death of a close relative, which was discouraged by Guru Gobind Singh. According to Sainapti, while creating the Khalsa, Guru Gobind Singh said that &quot;bhaddar&quot; is &quot;bharam&quot; (illusion), and not &quot;dharam&quot;.

Tensions developed between the Punjabi Khatri disciples of the Guru in Delhi, and members of the newly formed Khalsa. A prominent Khatri disciple was expelled from the place of worship (&quot;dharmasala&quot;) for refusing to join the Khalsa. Another disciple was expelled for eating with him, starting a chain of further expulsions. The expelled disciples convened a community gathering, at which two wealthy Khatris demanded that the Khalsa produce a written order from the Guru that a new mandatory code of conduct had been promulgated.

A Khatri family that refused to follow the &quot;bhaddar&quot; ritual was boycotted by the Khatri community. The Khatri council (panch) closed the bazaar to pressure the Khalsa. The Khalsa petitioned the state officials to intervene, who forced the reopening of the shops. Later, peace was established between the two groups in a &quot;sangat&quot; (congregation). However, hostility between some Khatris and the Khalsa persisted in the later years.

In contrast to the &quot;Khalsa&quot; Sikh, a &quot;Sahajdhari&quot; Sikh is one who reveres the teachings of the Sikh Gurus, but has not undergone the initiation. Sahajdhari Sikhs do not accept some or all elements of the dress and behavioral codes of the Khalsa Sikhs.

==Contemporary status==
Today, the Khalsa is respected by the entire gamut of Sikhs; however, not all Sikhs are Amritdharis. The issue of Khalsa code of conduct has led to several controversies. In the early 1950s, a serious split occurred in the Canadian Sikh community, when the Khalsa Diwan Society in Vancouver, British Columbia elected a clean-shaven Sikh to serve on its management committee. Although most of the early Sikh immigrants to Canada were non-Khalsa, and a majority of the members of the society were clean-shaven non-Khalsa Sikhs, a faction objected to the election of a non-Khalsa to the management committee. The factions in Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia broke away from the Khalsa Diwan Society and established their gurdwara society called Akali Singh.

The Khalsa has been predominantly a male institution in Sikh history, with &quot;Khalsa&quot; authority with the male leaders. In the contemporary era, it has become open to women but its authority remains with Sikh men.

3HO is a Western sect that emerged in 1971, founded by Harbhajan Singh Khalsa also known as Yogi Bhajan. It requires both men and women to wear turbans, and adopt the surname Khalsa.

Each year the Khalsa display their military skills around the world at a festival called Hola Mohalla. During Hola Mohalla, military exercises are performed alongside mock battles followed by kirtan and valor poetry competitions. The Khalsa also lead the Sikhs in the annual Vaisakhi parade.

<text>The Surtees Racing Organisation was a race team that spent nine seasons (1970 to 1978) as a constructor in Formula One, Formula 2, and Formula 5000.

==History==
The team was formed by John Surtees, a four-time 500cc motorcycle champion and the 1964 Formula One champion in 1966 to compete in the newly formed Canadian-American Challenge Cup (CanAm) &quot;unlimited&quot; sports car racing series. Entering as an owner/driver, Surtees won the championship in its first year, driving a Lola T70.

Surtees also fielded an entry in another newly formed series in 1969, becoming part of Formula 5000 after taking over a project started by Len Terry and Roger Nathan, and his team constructed its own cars for the first time. His team was successful, winning five races, consecutively at Mondello Park, Koksijde, Zandvoort, Snetterton and Hockenheim, during a twelve race season.

This inspired Surtees to expand to Formula One, and after having had a difficult season with BRM in 1969, he decided to become an owner/driver again. The team ran the full 1970 season, but Surtees was forced to run the first four races in an old McLaren due to a delay in the construction of his in-house F1 car. The new BP-sponsored car earned its first (and only) points that year in the Canadian Grand Prix.

Surtees added a second full-time car in for German driver Rolf Stommelen, and ran a third car for various drivers in a number of races. Three drivers, Surtees, Stommelen, and motorcycling champion Mike Hailwood earned three points each for the marque that year.

After the 1971 season, Surtees retired from full-time competition, and the team ended up with three new full-time drivers in . Hailwood returned to Surtees for a full year; joining him were Australian Tim Schenken and Italian Andrea de Adamich, the latter of whom brought sponsorship money to the team. Hailwood produced Surtees&#x27; first podium finish that year in the Italian Grand Prix, finishing second to Emerson Fittipaldi. All three drivers scored points for the team, and Surtees finished fifth in the Constructors&#x27; Championship.

Schenken was replaced in 1973 by Brazilian Carlos Pace, and the team only ran two full-time cars after de Adamich left following the season opener. Pace finished third in Austria and fourth in Germany, but it was the only points finishes the team had all season, as Hailwood was left scoreless. Hailwood departed for McLaren after the year, being replaced by Jochen Mass in . It was a difficult year for Surtees, as Pace left the team in mid-season, and replacement Derek Bell struggled to qualify for races, capped by Austrian driver Helmut Koinigg&#x27;s fatal crash at the 1974 United States Grand Prix. A fourth place by Pace at his home track were the only points Surtees managed to get, and they failed to finish in the top ten in the Constructors&#x27; Championship.

Low on money for , the team pared back to a single car for John Watson (although a second car was entered for Dave Morgan at Silverstone). The season was a tremendous struggle for Surtees, with no points scored, and the team missed three of the final four races. 1976 was much better, however, as Surtees landed a well-known, but otherwise controversial sponsorship deal with Durex condoms, and Australian Alan Jones joined the team. Jones finished fifth in Belgium and at Brands Hatch, and fourth in Japan. A second car, with Chesterfield sponsorship, was entered for American Brett Lunger, while a customer car was raced by Frenchman Henri Pescarolo during the second half of the season. With seven points, Surtees placed tenth in the Constructors&#x27; Championship.

Jones&#x27;s success resulted in him leaving the team for the emerging Shadow team, and money problems forced Surtees to run one car regularly again in 1977, this time for Vittorio Brambilla. Brambilla&#x27;s season was effective, also finishing in the points three times. Still, his good results did not prevent Surtees from further monetary troubles. In 1978, the team added a second car for pay driver, Briton Rupert Keegan, but the money problems continued. A lack of decent results caused further problems.

Unable to get sufficient money, the team left F1 after the season, despite having a car built for . After racing the car in the British Aurora championship (formerly F5000) briefly that year, Surtees Racing Organization was closed for good.

===Models===
* TS5 1969-1970 F5000/Formula A. Runner up in the 1969 Guards F5000 championship. Won Le Circuit Continental at Circuit Mont-Tremblant (driven by David Hobbs). One car was purchased by James Garner&#x27;s American International Racing team and raced at Lime Rock (blown engine) and the same race Hobbs won (knocked out in an 8-car pile-up part way through the 1st lap).
* TS7 1970 Formula One. Designed by Surtees, Shahab Ahmed, and Peter Connew. DFV/Hewland &quot;kit car&quot; followed closely on TS5 layout. Surtees won the Oulton Park International Gold Cup non-Championship race in this car.
* TS8 1971-1972 F5000. Runner up in Rothmans Championship in 1971.
* TS9 1971-1972 Formula One. A derivative of the TS7 with a longer wheelbase and wider track. Surtees repeated his Oulton Park win in 1971.
* TS10 1972 Formula Two. Powered by a Cosworth BDA engine Mike Hailwood convincingly won the 1972 European F2 Championship in this car. Two independent teams purchased TS10s but were not contenders in the series.
* TS11 1972-1973 F5000. Based on the TS9 with a Chevrolet engine. Gijs van Lennep won the 1972 Rothmans European Formula 5000 Championship driving the TS11 and a McLaren M18. A TS11 chassis with TS8 bodywork was prepared to run the 1972 Tasman Series after the TS8 intended for the series was wrecked beyond repair. Hailwood finished second in the series in this car.
* TS14 1972-1973 Formula One. This car marked the beginning of the end for Surtees. Firestone was anticipating leaving Formula One and had little interest in working with Surtees to cure the TS14&#x27;s habit of devouring tires. It was the first car in F1 to fully comply with crumple-zone legislation, incorporating these into its side pods within which the radiators were mounted, laying down the floorplan for the vast majority of subsequent F1 designs. It was a very quick car at its introduction but a series of accidents and lack of development support did not help it reach its potential. Surtees drove his last F1 race in the TS14 at Monza in 1972.
* TS15 1973 Formula Two. With BMW supplying engines exclusively to March Surtees was forced to settle for second place in the F2 Championships. A good car, but no match for the BMW engine. A development of this car, the TS17, was intended to run a Ford Motor Company V8 in F5000, but nothing came of the plan.
* TS16 1974-1975 Formula One. Based on the TS14, but overweight and with less than top notch DFV engines. The team also failed to engage a single major sponsor for 1974 so money was tight to say the least. Only a single car was run and to cap off a truly terrible year driver Helmut Koinigg was killed during the 1974 United States Grand Prix at Watkins Glen. The car was run again in 1975 and John Watson scored in three non-Championship events, but no championship points were scored.
* TS19 1976-1978 Formula One. A fresh car designed by Surtees and Ken Sears the TS19 managed to score points for Surtees in 1976 and 1977, and even ran the opening races of the 1978 season.
* TS20 1978 Formula One. A development of the TS19, the TS20 was a clean design that promised well, only to be completely overshadowed by the introduction of ground effects.

<doc id="523128" wikidata="Q295838" url="?curid=523128" title="Anzac Bridge">
<text>The Anzac Bridge is an eight-lane cable-stayed bridge that carries the Western Distributor (A4) across Johnstons Bay between Pyrmont and Glebe Island (part of the suburb of Rozelle), on the western fringe of the Sydney central business district, New South Wales, Australia. The bridge forms part of the road network leading from the central business district, the Sydney Harbour Bridge, and Cross City Tunnel to the Inner West and Northern Suburbs.

==History==

=== Glebe Island bridges ===
There were two bridges over Johnstons Bay before the construction of the Anzac Bridge.

The first bridge was constructed as part of a project to move the abattoirs out of central Sydney, and to construct public abattoirs at Glebe Island. The first pile of the original bridge was driven in October 1860. The bridge was opened in 1862 and was a timber beam bridge long and wide with a swing section on the eastern side. It replaced a double steam punt crossing.

The second Glebe Island Bridge was an electrically operated swing bridge opened in 1903, the year after the opening of the new Pyrmont Bridge over Sydney&#x27;s Darling Harbour, which has a similar design. The bridge was designed by Percy Allan of the New South Wales Public Works Department who also designed the Pyrmont Bridge. Delays due to increasing traffic, which were exacerbated by having to close a major arterial road to allow the movement of shipping into Blackwattle Bay, led to the construction of the present-day Anzac Bridge. The 1903 bridge is still standing, but there is no access to pedestrians or vehicular traffic.

=== Anzac Bridge ===
The stay cable design concept development and final design for the new bridge were carried out by a team from the Roads &amp; Traffic Authority, led by their Chief Bridge Engineer Ray Wedgwood and the construction by Baulderstone. The bridge was opened to traffic on 3 December 1995 as the Glebe Island Bridge.

The bridge was given its current name on Remembrance Day in 1998 to honour the memory of the soldiers of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (known as Anzacs) who served in World War I. An Australian Flag flies atop the eastern pylon and a New Zealand Flag flies atop the western pylon. A bronze memorial statue of an Australian Anzac soldier (&quot;digger&quot;) holding a Lee–Enfield rifle in the &quot;rest on arms reverse&quot; drill position was placed on the western end of the bridge on Anzac Day in 2000. A statue of a New Zealand soldier was added to a plinth across the road from the Australian Digger, facing towards the east, and was unveiled by Prime Minister of New Zealand Helen Clark in the presence of Premier of New South Wales Morris Iemma on Sunday 27 April 2008.

== Description ==
The bridge is wide and the main span is long. The reinforced concrete pylons are high and support the deck by two planes of stay cables. Initially the stay cables were plagued by vibrations which have since been resolved by the addition of thin stabilising cables between the stay cables.

There is a grade-separated shared pedestrian footpath and cycleway located on the northern side of the bridge, making possible a walk from Glebe Point Road, down Bridge Road, over the bridge and round Blackwattle Bay back to Glebe Point Road.

The bridge can carry a maximum of 180,000 cars per day. It reached its maximum capacity in 2002, only seven years after it was finished and consistent with the principles of induced demand of traffic.

The bridge is regularly patrolled by security guards as a counter-terrorist attack measure. Security cameras also monitor the walkway.

The bridge has a speed limit of : it was reduced from in January 2005. Also prior to that date, the bridge had seven traffic lanes (4 eastbound, 3 westbound).

Originally, there were bus stops at the western end of the bridge, but they were removed because buses pulling out from the stops created a hazard as they merged with other traffic moving at (or close to) the speed limit. The Australian Anzac statue on the northern side of the bridge is adjacent to the former city-bound bus stop; the New Zealand Anzac statue was installed within the ramp area of the former stop on the southern side.

==Use in popular culture==
The bridge has been used in a number of artistic works including:

* The bridge was used in the &quot;Looking for Alibrandi&quot; (1999) movie scene where the title character, Josephine Alibrandi, and her date Jacob Coote rode across the bridge on Jacob&#x27;s motorcycle.
* Deni Hines&#x27; song &quot;It&#x27;s Alright&quot; (1995) features the nearly completed bridge in the music video group dance sequences, the filming of which taking place a few months before the bridge&#x27;s December 1995 opening.
* You Am I&#x27;s song &quot;Purple Sneakers&quot; from the band&#x27;s album &quot;Hi Fi Way&quot; (1995) opens with the lyric &quot;Had a scratch only you could itch, underneath the Glebe Point bridge&quot;. The Glebe Island Bridge was still under construction when Tim Rogers wrote and recorded the song in 1994, with the bridge&#x27;s name change to &#x27;Anzac Bridge&#x27; not occurring until 1998.

<text>The El Segundo blue (Euphilotes allyni) is an endangered species of butterfly. It is endemic to a small dune ecosystem in Southern California that used to be a community called Palisades del Rey, close to the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). 
== Taxonomy ==
It was originally thought to be a subspecies of the square-spotted blue (&quot;E. battoides&quot;) or the Bernardino blue (&quot;E. bernardino&quot;), but recent authorities consider it its own species.
== Conservation ==
In 1976 it became a federally designated endangered species. This butterfly’s habitat has been substantially reduced due to urban development and invasive plants, and it now exists as a handful of populations restricted to coastal dunes in the vicinity of Los Angeles.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The El Segundo Blue Butterfly Habitat Preserve next to LAX exists to protect the subspecies. Until 2013, there are only three colonies of this tiny butterfly still in existence. The largest of these is on the grounds of LAX; a further colony exists on a site within the huge Chevron El Segundo oil refinery complex, and the smallest colony is an area of only a few square yards on a local beach. In 2013, the El Segundo blue was discovered living and breeding in the Ballona Wetlands, and its range now extends south to the Palos Verdes Peninsula and some have been located in Santa Barbara County. The butterfly lays its eggs on Seacliff buckwheat (Eriogonum parvifolium), which the adults also use as a nectar source. This is its host plant. Recently, some nearby beach cities such as Redondo Beach have replaced ice plant growth near the beaches with coast buckwheat, in order to provide the butterflies with more of their natural food source.

<text>A zookeeper, sometimes referred as animal keeper, is a person who manages zoo animals that are kept in captivity for conservation or to be displayed to the public. They are usually responsible for the feeding and daily care of the animals. As part of their routine, the zookeepers may clean the exhibits and report health problems. They may also be involved in scientific research or public education, such as conducting tours and answering questions.

==Background==
Animal collections requiring wild animal care takers or zookeepers have existed since about 3,000 B.C.

Early civilizations in Mesopotamia (present day Iraq), Egypt, China and India allowed rulers and the wealthy class citizens to keep collections of wild animals. These civilizations had individuals who caught and cared for wild animals such as fish and birds. King Hammurabi (Babylonia, 1728-1686 BC) established the first known Code of Laws, which included fees that could be charged by “ox and ass doctors” or what we know today as veterinarians.

Some ancient collections of animals were very large and contained a wide variety of species, although specific details of these collections were not recorded. Many cultures such as the Chinese, Egyptians, Persians, Greeks, Arabian, and India collected. Little is known about how or where they kept these animals, or even what the animals were. Our knowledge comes from when these animals appeared in the processionals (parades) or in the arena fights. However, there is proof that large elephant exhibits were maintained outside of Rome. There is also proof of people who cared for the sick animals (veterinarians).

In the areas known as the New World, Aztec and Inca societies also maintained large animal collections. While these were only discovered in the early 16th century, they were much older than that. Montezuma (Mexico City) had the largest known collections. One collection consisted of birds and required some 300 keepers. Another collection consisted of mammals and reptiles requiring another 300 keepers. There were also fresh and salt water fish ponds.

==Duties and responsibilities==
A zookeeper&#x27;s responsibilities usually include feeding, maintaining and cleaning the animals, diet preparation, behavioral observation, record keeping, exhibit maintenance and providing environmental enrichment for the animals in their care. Some also conduct behavioral or reproductive research on a species and participate in public education through talks, programs or shows. They are expected to clean enclosures every day. They look for any signs of injuries or illness in the animals, and in the case of sickness or injury, the keeper is responsible for contacting a veterinarian, and sometimes a zookeeper will assist a veterinarian.

Some zookeepers train the animals to make caring for them easier. For example, a zookeeper can train an elephant to lift their feet so that a veterinarian can check them more easily. Some zookeepers are responsible for informing an audience, in an exhibit or presentation, about certain types of animals and their behavioral characteristics. They also talk about experiences with the animal, and answer questions. The keeper is also responsible for lecturing the visiting public on how to behave responsibly toward the exhibited animals.

Depending on the zoo structure, keepers may be assigned to work with a broad group of animals, such as mammals, birds, or reptiles, or they may work with a limited collection of animals such as primates, large cats, or small mammals. Traditionally, the live exhibits were often organized by taxonomy, resulting in clusters of carnivores cages, bird aviaries, primate exhibits, and so on, which led to sections within a zoo cared for by specialized staff. Some keepers can become highly specialized such as those who concentrate on a specific group of animals like birds, great apes, elephants or reptiles.

Modern habitat exhibits attempt to display a diversity of species of different animal classes within one enclosure to represent ecosystem concepts. Groups of enclosures are organized by themes, relating to, for example, zoogeography and bioclimatic zones, rather than taxonomy. The shift in exhibit arrangements is changing the scope of work for animal keepers, as they become habitat keepers, with a necessary working knowledge of living environment care, including landscape maintenance, plant care, climate control, and expanded knowledge of animals husbandry for many more species across taxonomic classes.

==Educational requirements==

The educational requirements for an entry-level zookeeper vary.

In the US they are often required to have completed a college degree in zoology, biology, wildlife management, animal science, or some other animal-related field. Some colleges offer programs oriented towards a career in zoos. Job advancement is also possible but more limited than in some other careers requiring a college degree. In other institutions keepers are required to have finished a full apprenticeship as craftsmen, before receiving special training for their task as animal keeper. In fact in many European countries, people intending to keep or take care of wild animals need to be licensed. This license will only be given if they can prove sufficient knowledge and practical abilities (evidence of competence). Of course in the vast array of zoos in the world, some of them are still privately owned amateur facilities with a lack of well-trained personnel.

In contrast, some zoos in Australia have a strong reliance on dedicated part-time volunteer workers, who assist zookeepers in the simpler tasks such as preparation of foods and medicines, and cleaning of animal enclosures.

==Internships and volunteer work==

In the US, in addition to good academic preparation, most zoos prefer to hire people for zookeeping positions who have prior animal-handling experience. There are a wide variety of internships that aspiring zoo keepers can take both during and after college. Many of these internships can be found by going to a local zoo or aquarium. Other internships can be found in an animal-related facility, including vet hospitals, humane society shelters, wildlife rehabilitation centers, farms and stables. Internships are an opportunity for individuals who are considering a career in animal welfare to learn more about companion animals and their behaviors.

== Occupational hazards ==
There are several occupational hazards associated with zookeepers including allergens, zoonoses, bite injuries, slips, trips, and falls, chemicals, stress, and noise. These exposures have been associated with increased rates of alergic diseases, skin infections, bite-related infections, intestinal diseases, tuberculosis and psychological stress. The National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians publishes guidelines to identify and control risks associated with contact with animals in public settings.

<doc id="523135" wikidata="Q1952877" url="?curid=523135" title="Edmond Dantès">
<text>Edmond Dantès () is a title character, Byronic hero and the protagonist of Alexandre Dumas&#x27;s 1844 adventure novel &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;. Within the story&#x27;s narrative, Dantès is an intelligent, honest and loving man who turns bitter and vengeful after he is framed for a crime he did not commit. When Dantès finds himself free and enormously wealthy, he takes it upon himself to reward those who have helped him in his plight and punish those responsible for his years of suffering. He is known by the aliases The Count of Monte Cristo (), [[Abbé]] Busoni, [[Lord]] Wilmore, and [[Sinbad the Sailor]].

== History ==

=== Dantès, first mate ===
When the reader is first introduced to Edmond Dantès, he arrives in Marseille as first mate aboard the merchant ship &quot;Le Pharaon&quot; (The Pharaoh). At only 19 years old, the young Dantès seems destined for success. Although the trip was successful, the former Captain, Leclère, has fallen ill and died. Dantès relays these events to his patron, M. Morrel, who tells Dantès that he will try to have him named captain. Dantès rushes off to see his father and then his beloved, the young Catalan woman Mercédès, and the two agree to be married immediately.

=== The engagement and the arrest ===
The marriage never occurs, however. On the very night of their nuptial feast, Dantès is arrested as a suspected Bonapartist, a helper to Napoléon, and taken to see the public prosecutor, Gérard de Villefort. Edmond had been anonymously and falsely denounced by Danglars, Edmond&#x27;s shipmate over whom he was promoted, and Fernand Mondego, a rival suitor for Mercédès&#x27; hand. Prosecutor De Villefort concludes that Edmond is innocent, and assures him that he will be released. He then asks for a piece of evidence cited in a letter denouncing Edmond to the authorities. The letter claims that on Edmond&#x27;s last voyage, he made a stopover at the island of Elba, and received a letter from the deposed Emperor Napoléon. Edmond hands over the letter, which he received in the name of Captain Leclère, and of which the contents are unknown to Edmond. De Villefort throws the letter on the fire for the letter is addressed to his father. Once again he promises Edmond&#x27;s speedy release. De Villefort has renounced his father, a staunch Bonapartist, and destroyed the letter to protect himself, not Edmond; to further protect his name, de Villefort sentences Edmond to imprisonment in the dreaded Chateau d&#x27;If, an island fortress from which no prisoner had ever escaped, and to which the most dangerous political prisoners are sent.

=== Despair and near-suicide ===
After six long years in solitary confinement in the dungeons of the Chateau, Edmond decides to commit suicide by starving himself. Fearing he will be forced to eat, he throws out his food in secrecy. After nearly six months, he hears scratching against the wall of his cell. Curiosity about the source of the noise inspires him to begin eating again. He taps on his wall several times, and when the scratching stops, he concludes that it is a prisoner trying to escape. He then uses the saucepan on which his food is served to begin digging where he heard the scratching before in hopes that it was another prisoner digging his way to freedom. Dantès eventually breaks through enough of the wall that he is able to exchange a brief greeting with an old Italian abbé named Faria, sometimes called the &quot;Mad Priest&quot;, who had indeed been attempting to dig to freedom.

=== Edmond and the Abbé ===
The two prisoners become very close, with the learned priest teaching Dantès all he knows about reading, mathematics, science, languages, philosophy, history, sword fighting, and economics. Together, they determine who betrayed Edmond, and although Faria disapproves, Edmond plans vengeance against his betrayers. The two spend years digging a tunnel to freedom, but Faria dies before they can escape. Before Abbe Faria died, he revealed to Edmond a secret treasure, hidden on the island of Monte Cristo. That night, Edmond exchanges himself for his mentor in the priest&#x27;s bodybag, and escapes from the prison. The jailers, rather than burying prisoners, toss them over the fortress&#x27; wall into the sea, weighted with an iron ball chained around the legs. Using a knife made from a sharpened crucifix, Edmond frees himself and reaches the surface. Edmond swims to a small island nearby to seek refuge from the storm for the night. The next day, he swims out to sea as a smuggling ship passes by and is rescued under the pretense of being a shipwreck victim. Edmond soon suggests a stopover and trading of goods at the small island of Monte Cristo, during which he confirms that Faria&#x27;s treasure exists. On this and subsequent visits, Edmond becomes wealthy.

=== Loyalty and betrayal ===
Upon returning to Marseille, Edmond learns that his father had died of hunger and that Mercédès had married Fernand 8 months after he was supposedly executed for treason. His old neighbour Gaspard Caderousse is still alive, and—under the guise of the Abbé Busoni—Edmond visits him to learn more. Caderousse tells him that Morrel had tried to obtain a fair trial for Edmond, and how Mercédès pleaded for his release. He also learns that those who had remained loyal to him had suffered greatly, while those who had betrayed him had prospered. Edmond thanks Caderousse for the information, paying him with a large diamond that he said had come into Edmond&#x27;s possession while in prison. Realizing that only Morrel had remained loyal, Edmond creates three disguises – an Englishman named Lord Wilmore, a clerk from the banking firm Thomson and French, and Sinbad the Sailor – and uses them to save Morrel from bankruptcy and suicide. Edmond then goes into hiding, spending nine years reforming himself as the Count of Monte Cristo.

=== Paris and the Count ===
Edmond emerges into Parisian society as the mysterious and sophisticated Count of Monte Cristo. Having purchased the deed to the island from whence he obtained his treasure, Edmond is able to place himself in the upper strata of Parisian society and assume the role of one of the most influential men in all of France. As such, he is introduced to several other powerful men, most notably Danglars, who is now a wealthy banker; Mondego, who is now Count de Morcerf and a military hero; and M. Villefort, who is now the &quot;procureur du roi&quot;, one of the most powerful advocates in the country. Furthermore, Mondego has married Mercédès, and the two have a son named Albert. Having established himself in Parisian society, and having distanced himself from Edmond Dantès, the Count is able to formulate his plans of revenge against the men who betrayed him. By the end of the novel, Edmond had exacted his revenge on all of the men who would have seen him rot in prison. He exposes crimes committed by Villefort and Mondego, ruining their respective reputations and bringing the police down upon them; Villefort goes insane, and Mondego commits suicide. He arranges for Danglars to be temporarily captured by the Italian bandit Luigi Vampa, made to understand Edmond&#x27;s suffering, and stripped of all of his wealth. Edmond, at the end of the novel, departs with his ward Haydée (previously enslaved by Mondego and liberated by Edmond), leaving with words of wisdom: &quot;to wait and hope&quot;.

== Portrayal in adaptations ==
James O&#x27;Neill, father of playwright Eugene, performed the title role over 6,000 times during his career. Edmond Dantès has been portrayed on TV and film many times by actors such as George Dolenz, Alan Badel, Robert Donat, Jean Marais, Louis Jourdan, Gérard Depardieu, Richard Chamberlain, Jim Caviezel and, most recently, Pierre Niney and Sam Claflin. Dantès has also been portrayed on stage, including in a musical adaptation of the novel.

In the Japanese animated television series &quot;&quot;, he is voiced by Jōji Nakata in the Japanese version and by Jamieson Price in the English dub.

There are also at least three adaptations into television soap operas, the last of which being the 2006 Mexican series &quot;Montecristo&quot;.

In 2011, ABC debuted the television drama &quot;Revenge&quot;, billed as a loose adaptation of Dumas&#x27; &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;. In it, the character of Dantès is envisioned as a female protagonist by the name of Emily Thorne (portrayed by actress Emily VanCamp).

He is portrayed as an Avenger-class Servant in the popular mobile game, &quot;Fate/Grand Order&quot;, where his character is designed for the game by Rui Komatsuzaki and voiced by Nobunaga Shimazaki.

Craig Horner portrays the Count of Monte Cristo in the second episode of the sixth season of &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;. In the series, Edmond seeks revenge on Baron Danglars for burning down his village and murdering his fiancée. Edmond manages to kill him at a party. Afterwards, he is approached by the Evil Queen Regina who was impressed with his vengeance and hires Edmond to kill Snow White and Prince Charming. Edmond poses as a victim of the Queen and becomes Snow and Charming&#x27;s wine steward, but he is hesitant to kill them after he discovers they are nice people. Edmond nonetheless prepares to poison the royal couple. As Rumplestiltskin needs them alive for his own purposes, he poisons Snow and Charming&#x27;s handmaiden Charlotte, whom Edmond has fallen in love with, with poison from the Agrabahn Vipers. This forces Edmond to take Charlotte to the Land of Untold Stories where their story &quot;cannot play out&quot;. Years later, the Evil Queen has redeemed but because of Dr. Jekyll&#x27;s serum, Regina and the Queen are two separate people. Edmond is among the inhabitants of the Land of Untold Stories that are emigrated to Storybrooke with Charlotte dying from the poison. The Evil Queen takes Edmond&#x27;s heart to try to force him to kill Snow and Charming. This left Regina with no choice but to kill Edmond by throwing her sword into his back.

In 2024, two adaptations of the novel were produced, first getting released a French feature film, &quot;Le Comte de Monte-Cristo&quot;, starring Pierre Niney, and later, an English-language television miniseries, &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;, starring Sam Claflin.

== Referenced in other films ==
Edmond Dantès was referenced in the final scenes of &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; (2005); protagonist Evey Hammond describes terrorist V as Edmond Dantès after he martyrs himself to bring down the tyrannical Norsefire government. Earlier in the movie, V and Evey watch the 1934 film adaptation of &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;, which V states is his favourite movie.

Writer/director John Hughes used Edmond Dantès as his pseudonym late in his career.

== Sources ==

The story of Dantès&#x27; imprisonment in the Château d&#x27;If was likely inspired by the imprisonment of general Thomas-Alexandre Dumas (Alexandre Dumas, &quot;père&quot;″s own father) in a dungeon fortress in Taranto, Italy, in 1799–1801.

<text>A try is a way of scoring points in rugby union and rugby league football. A try is scored by grounding the ball in the opposition&#x27;s in-goal area (on or behind the goal line). Rugby union and league differ slightly in defining &quot;grounding the ball&quot; and the &quot;in-goal&quot; area. In rugby union a try is worth 5 points, and in rugby league a try is worth 4 points. 

The term &quot;try&quot; comes from &quot;try at goal&quot;, signifying that grounding the ball originally only gave the attacking team the opportunity to try to score with a kick at goal.

A try is analogous to a touchdown in American and Canadian football, with the major difference being that a try requires the ball be simultaneously touching the ground and an attacking player, whereas a touchdown merely requires that the ball enter the airspace above the &quot;end zone&quot; while in the possession of an opposing player. In both codes of rugby, the term &quot;touch down&quot; formally refers only to grounding the ball by the defensive team in their in-goal.

A try is scored in wheelchair rugby following a change in terminology in an effort to become more aligned to rugby union &quot;tries&quot; (Tries are worth 1 point each, and, unlike tries in rugby union and rugby league, there is no subsequent conversion attempt). Wheelchair rugby league gives tries the same number of points as the normal game (four) and conversions are taken and are worth two points.

==Scoring a try==
===Aspects common to both union and league===
There are differences in the fine detail of the laws and their interpretation between the two rugby codes. These are the common aspects, while the differences are treated below.

*The player holding the ball to score a try and the ball itself must not be in touch or touch-in-goal (including on or over the dead ball line). The touchline, touch-in-goal lines and dead ball lines count as being &#x27;out&#x27;. There has to be contact with the ground by a player or the ball for it to be ruled in touch or touch-in-goal. Parts of the body in the air above the lines and outside the field of play or in-goal are not touch, and it is common to see players who are partly in the air over the lines still grounding the ball successfully.
*The in-goal area in which the ball must be grounded includes the goal line, but not the touch-in-goal and dead ball lines. 
*Grounding the ball in both codes means either holding it and touching it to the ground in-goal, or placing hand, arm or front of body between waist and neck (the front torso) on top of the ball which is on the ground in-goal.
*A player does not need to be holding the ball to ground it. If the ball is on the ground or just above it, it can be touched to the ground with a hand, arm or front torso. Match officials interpret dropping the ball in-goal as a knock-on, and disallow a try. For a try to be awarded, they consider whether the player had the intention to ground the ball and was in control of the ball when he did. Grounding of the ball can be instantaneous, it does not matter if the player immediately lets go and the ball then bounces forward.
*An attacking player who falls to the ground before reaching the goal line scores a try if momentum carries the player so that the ball touches the in-goal, including the goal line.

===Variations specific to rugby union===
*A player may ground the ball in one of two ways: 1) if the ball is held in the hand(s) or arm(s), merely touching the ball to the ground in-goal suffices and no downward pressure is required; 2) if the ball is on the ground in-goal, downward pressure from the hand(s), arm(s) or upper body (waist to neck) is required. For a try to be awarded, an attacking player must ground the ball before a defender does so. If there is doubt about which team first grounded the ball, the attacking team are awarded a 5-metre scrum.
*A player who is in touch or touch-in-goal, but who is not carrying the ball, may score a try by grounding the ball in-goal.
*Since May 2020 the goal-posts and padding at ground level are not considered part of the goal line. A try may not be scored by grounding the ball at the foot of the posts.
*A player may ground the ball in a scrum as soon as the ball reaches or crosses the goal line. (A scrum can only exist in the field-of-play, so as soon as the ball touches or crosses the line, the scrum is over and players may unbind and ground the ball.)
*If an attacking player is tackled short of the goal-line but &quot;immediately&quot; reaches out and places the ball on or over the goal-line, a try is scored. (This is a direct contrast to rugby league, which would award a penalty for &quot;double movement&quot;, see below. There is occasionally confusion amongst spectators and players at community levels of the game and an incorrect protest of &quot;double movement&quot; is a common one at English rugby union matches. A &quot;double movement&quot; in rugby union involves movement of the torso, rather than arms only.)
*If a television match official (TMO, or video referee) has been appointed, the referee may ask for advice before deciding whether to award a try. The referee is first required to specify the officials&#x27; on-field decision (try or no try) before specifying what matters are in doubt. This can include circumstances related to the scoring of the try, such as whether the ball was grounded properly or the scorer&#x27;s foot was in touch, as well as matters that happened prior to the try, such as whether a pass was forward or a player committed an obstruction. The TMO is not confined to the matters the referee specified and can offer advice to the referee on other things that have happened. The TMO is, however, confined to looking back no further than the last two phases of play. If the officials determine that the on-field decision was clearly wrong, it will be reversed and another decision substituted. Otherwise, the on-field decision stands.

===Variations specific to rugby league===

*The laws of rugby league still refer to the need for &quot;downward pressure&quot; to be exerted in grounding the ball with hand or arm.
*The laws of rugby league specify that a try is scored if an attacker grounds the ball simultaneously with a defender.
*An attacking player whose momentum does not allow the ball to reach the try-line or in-goal after their ball-carrying arm touches the ground may &quot;not&quot; reach out to score if a defender is in contact with them; this is disallowed by interpretation as a &quot;double movement&quot;.
*Players who are in touch-in-goal and not carrying the ball may &quot;not&quot; score a try by pressing a loose ball still in play to the ground.
*A try may not be scored in a scrum which crosses the goal line, but when the ball comes out of scrum a player may pick it up and &#x27;bore through&#x27; their own scrum to score a try.
*Video referees in rugby league are given a wider scope to look at the validity of a try. If the onfield referee is unsure or needs clarification, they may refer to the video referee to award a possible try. This referral must also be sent with the onfield referee&#x27;s opinion on whether the play is a &#x27;Try&#x27; (signaled by forming a &#x27;T&#x27; with their forearms) or &#x27;No Try&#x27; (signaled by folding their arms across the shoulders). The video referee must then find evidence to support the opinion, or conclusive evidence against the opinion. In the event the video referee cannot prove or deny the opinion, the original opinion is upheld.

==Point value==
In rugby union, a try is worth five points; in rugby league, four (except in Nines, where a try between the goal posts is worth 5). 

Although a try is worth less in rugby league, it is more often the main method of scoring due to the smaller value of a goal kick and surety of possession - penalties are worth 2 points and drop-goals are worth 1 point (2 points in the NRL if beyond 40 metres) whereas in rugby Union they are worth 3 points each. In rugby union, there is heavier reliance placed on goals to accumulate points at elite levels due to the significant value of goals and the defending team&#x27;s skills.

In rugby union, the value of a try has varied over time, from none to five points. In rugby league, the original value was three; this was increased to four in 1983.

For the 2015–16 Welsh Premier Division season, World Rugby and the Welsh Rugby Union experimented with the awarding of six points for a try, along with other scoring changes. The intended result of a faster, more running-focussed game was not realised and the changes were reverted the following year.

In the NRL and NRLW Nines competitions, a try is normally worth 4 points, but is sometimes worth 5 points when the ball carrier enters the &quot;try zone&quot; between the uprights.

In some rugby union competitions, a 9 point try, or power try, is awarded if attacks are launched within 22 meters of the scoring team&#x27;s own try line. Global Rapid Rugby was the most popular competition to implement this.

==Penalty try==
In both rugby league and rugby union, if the referee believes that a try has been prevented by the defending team&#x27;s misconduct, he may award the attacking team a &quot;penalty try&quot;. Penalty tries are always awarded under the posts regardless of where the offence took place. In rugby union, a penalty try is awarded when, &quot;in the opinion of the referee, a try probably would have been scored (or scored in a more advantageous position) if not for an act of foul
play by an opponent&quot;. In rugby league, the referee &quot;may award a penalty try if, in his opinion, a try would have been scored but for the unfair play of the defending team&quot;. Like in rugby union, a penalty try is awarded between the goal posts irrespective of where the offence occurred.

In rugby union, before 1 January 2017 a conversion had to be attempted following the award of a penalty try. From that date, no conversion is attempted and the attacking team is awarded 7 points. The offending player must be temporarily suspended or sent off.

In rugby league, a possible 8-point try is awarded if the defending team commits an act of foul play as the ball is being grounded. The try is awarded, and is followed by a conversion attempt, in-line from where the try was scored, and then a penalty kick from in front of the posts. In rugby union, foul play after a try being scored results in a penalty being awarded on the half way mark, in lieu of a kick off.

A penalty try and a possible 8 point try are two separate results with the latter being scarcely seen in today&#x27;s game.

==Conversion== 

In both codes, when a try is scored, the scoring team gets to attempt a &quot;conversion&quot;, which is a kick at goal to convert the try from one set of points into another larger set of points. The kick is taken at any point on the field of play in line with the point that the ball was grounded for the try, and parallel to the touch-lines. If successful, additional points are scored. For the conversion to be successful, the ball must pass over the crossbar and between the uprights. In both codes, the conversion may be attempted as either a place kick (from the ground) or a drop kick. Most players will nevertheless opt for a place kick, this being generally regarded as the easier skill. Note, however, that in both rugby sevens (usually, but not always, played under union rules) and rugby league nines, conversions may only take place as drop kicks.

In rugby league, the game clock continues during preparation and execution of a conversion, with the institution of a 25-second shot clock at certain tournaments from the moment the try is awarded by the referee, within which time the conversion kick must be taken, hence a team may decline a conversion attempt if recommencing play as quickly as possible is advantageous to them. An example of this occurred in the 2020 NRL Grand Final, when the Penrith Panthers scored a try with 20 seconds remaining in the match, bringing them to within 6 points of the Melbourne Storm. Penrith declined the conversion in order to give themselves time to try to draw level on the last play; had the team chosen to take the conversion, the remaining time on the clock would have elapsed, ending the match with a certain Panthers loss.

In rugby union the clock is not stopped during the conversion and the kicker has to attempt the conversion within 90 seconds. The try scorer has the right to decline the conversion attempt by saying to the referee &quot;no kick&quot; after scoring.

To make the conversion easier, attacking players will try to ground the ball as close to the centre of the in-goal area as possible. The attacking player will, however, generally ground the ball when confronted by a defender rather than risk losing the ball by being tackled or passing it to a teammate.

In both rugby union and rugby league, a conversion is worth two points; a successful kick at goal thus converts a five-point try to seven for rugby union, and a four-point try to six for rugby league.

==Past to present==
In early forms of rugby football, the point of the game was to score &quot;goals&quot;. A try [at goal] was awarded for grounding the ball in the opponents&#x27; in-goal area. The try had zero value itself, but allowed the attacking team to &quot;try&quot; a kick at goal without interference from the other team. This kick, if successful, &quot;converts&quot; a &quot;try&quot; into a &quot;goal&quot;.

Modern rugby and all derived forms now favour the try over a goal and thus the try has a definite value, that has increased over time and has for many years surpassed the number of points awarded for a goal. In rugby league and rugby union, a conversion attempt is still given, but is simply seen as adding extra &#x27;bonus&#x27; points. These points, however, can mean the difference between winning or losing a match, so thought is given to fielding players with good goal-kicking skill.

Since 1979, in rugby union, the &quot;try&quot; and &quot;conversion goal&quot; have been officially considered as separate scores. Before then, the converted try was officially a single score called a &quot;goal from a try&quot; which replaced the score of the (unconverted) &quot;try&quot;. The change allowed the player who touched down for the try and the player who kicked the conversion to be credited separately for their portions of the score. Until the 1990s, a restart kick after an unconverted try was taken as a place kick, with drop-kicks taken after a goal.

<text>Clarkson University is a private research university with its main campus in Potsdam, New York. Clarkson has additional graduate program and research facilities in the New York Capital District. It was established in 1896 and enrolled over 4,000 students in 2024. studying toward bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degrees in each of its schools or institutes: the Institute for a Sustainable Environment, the School of Arts &amp; Sciences, the David D. Reh School of Business, the Wallace H. Coulter School of Engineering, and the Earl R. and Barbara D. Lewis School of Health Sciences. The university is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;.

==History==
The school was founded in 1896, funded by the sisters of Thomas S. Clarkson, a local entrepreneur who was accidentally killed while working in his sandstone quarry not far from Potsdam. When a worker was in danger of being crushed by a loose pump, Clarkson pushed him out of the way risking his own life. Clarkson was crushed against a wall by the swinging pump, sustaining severe internal injuries. He died five days later. The Clarkson family realized great wealth in the development of such quarries, and Potsdam sandstone was highly sought after by developers of townhouses in New York City and elsewhere. The family were important benefactors in the Potsdam area. The school was called the Thomas S. Clarkson Memorial School of Technology.

In 1913, the name was changed to Thomas S. Clarkson Memorial College of Technology, which was used in a shortened version as Clarkson College of Technology (CCT). During the first half of the 20th century the majority of the campus was located &quot;downtown&quot;. The campus slowly expanded to an area known as the &quot;Hill&quot;, located on the south-western edge of Potsdam village. As of 2001, almost all academics and housing had moved to the hill campus, although the university still uses the downtown buildings known as Old Snell and Old Main for administrative functions. In 2022, the Clarkson board of trustees named the hill campus &quot;The Collins Hill Campus&quot; in honor of longtime President Tony Collins. 

On February 24, 1984, the school officially became Clarkson University although the pep band&#x27;s rallying cry at hockey games is still &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Tech!&quot;. The institution and its hockey team have carried the nickname &quot;Tech&quot; since the 1896 founding. &quot;CCT&quot; is still printed on older school property and equipment.

On February 1, 2016, Union Graduate College merged into Clarkson University and became the Clarkson University Capital Region Campus in Schenectady, New York.

On February 5, 2025, Clarkson announced that Michelle Larson would be the university&#x27;s 19th and first female president for a term starting on April 1, 2025.

==Academics==

More than 50 undergraduate majors and minors are available at the university. The university also offers master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees. These degree programs are offered through the School of Arts &amp; Sciences, David D. Reh School of Business, Institute for a Sustainable Environment, Wallace H. Coulter School of Engineering, the Earl R. and Barbara D. Lewis School of Health Sciences and the Clarkson School.Clarkson University is home to the Center for Advanced Materials Processing (CAMP). CAMP is dedicated to developing Clarkson&#x27;s research and educational programs in high-technology materials processing.

===The Clarkson School===
The Clarkson School, a special division of Clarkson University, was founded in 1978. The school offers students an early entrance opportunity into college, replacing the typical senior year of high school with a year of college. It is one of few college early admission programs in the country that provides a real community living/learning experience on a university campus.

The Clarkson School&#x27;s Bridging Year is a &quot;bridging year&quot; between high school and college for students who are ready to enter college early. Every year, 50 to 80 high school students are accepted to The Clarkson School, where they may work towards a GED and take college classes. They may also work with their high schools to complete a high school diploma or drop out of high school entirely. After they complete the program, they are given the option to enter Clarkson University with all credits from the previous year or to transfer to another school, usually as freshmen with advanced standing.

Students in The Clarkson School are fully matriculated undergraduates with freshman status at the university. They take classes with other University students and usually carry a course load of 15 to 18 credits per semester for two semesters. College credits may also be given for college and Advanced Placement courses taken before entering The Clarkson School. Cross-registration at neighboring area colleges and universities can provide additional college credits, particularly in art, music and languages. These credits also appear on an official Clarkson University transcript.

The Clarkson School students are housed in Newell House and Ormsby House in Price Hall and the typical class size is about 50 students. Students participating in this program are often called &quot;Schoolies&quot; by other Clarkson students.

==Campus==
Clarkson has two campuses in Potsdam—the &quot;downtown&quot; campus and the Collins Hill Campus—as well as the Capital Region Campus in Schenectady, New York.

The health science departments of Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy and Physician Assistant Studies are located on the downtown campus. The campus bookstore is located in downtown Potsdam. The last student dormitory (Congdon) located on the downtown campus closed in May 2006. The only buildings remaining in Clarkson&#x27;s service at the downtown campus are a few administration buildings, the Army ROTC house, the Clarkson Hall Center for Health Sciences (physical therapy and physician assistant studies), and the Peyton Hall Business Incubator. Other downtown campus buildings contain leased space to businesses.

===Athletics===

Clarkson&#x27;s athletic teams are known collectively as the Golden Knights. There are 20 varsity athletic teams. Except for the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s alpine and nordic skiing, all of these teams compete in the NCAA.

While Clarkson is an NCAA Division III school, both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ice hockey teams compete in Division I, with both teams playing in the ECAC. The men&#x27;s team is a traditional power in the ECAC. They have won 6 ECAC Tournament Championships, most recently in 2019. Clarkson&#x27;s most recent NCAA tournament was as the number two seed in the 2019 NCAA Northeast Regional, where they lost in overtime to the University of Notre Dame, 3–2, in the 1st round.

The women&#x27;s team has appeared in every tournament since entering the ECAC in 2004 and have appeared in four NCAA tournaments, winning the 2018 edition, 2017 edition, and 2014 edition, the first three NCAA titles won by the school, the first NCAA ice hockey title won by a school in St. Lawrence County, and the first Division I NCAA championship won by a school from the North Country.

Each year, executive board members of the Golden Knotes hire music students from the neighboring Crane School of Music to serve as music director of the group.

====FIRST Robotics====
Clarkson Robotics brings Clarkson University students together with local high school students to design, build, and test a robot that competes in the FIRST Robotics Competition each year.

====Applied Computer Science Labs====
Applied CS Labs - The Applied Computer Science Labs at Clarkson University consists of the Clarkson Open Source Institute, the Internet Teaching Lab, and the Virtual Reality Lab, however only the first two are populated. These labs, collectively referred to on campus as COSI, are almost entirely student-run, offering the opportunity to gain experience in managing both facilities and projects. All three labs are located on the 3rd floor of the Science Center in rooms SC334 and SC336. The Applied CS Labs are home to Clarkson University&#x27;s open source mirror, which serves downloads for popular projects like Blender (software) and the Ubuntu operating system, among many others.

====Clarkson Pep Band====

The Clarkson University Pep Band is a student-run organization that supports the Clarkson University Golden Knights ice hockey teams. The band consists of approximately 75 full-time members, and performs at Clarkson&#x27;s Cheel Arena at all of the home games for the Men&#x27;s NCAA Division I hockey team and some games for the NCAA Division I Women&#x27;s team.

The band also travels to Clarkson Men&#x27;s ECAC Hockey conference away games with 35-40 members (unless restricted by the policies of the opposing team&#x27;s arena) and post-season tournaments.

The Clarkson University Pep Band was founded in the fall of 1964, by a small group of Clarkson students. 

====Clarkson Theatre Company====
The Clarkson Theatre Company (CTC) is a student-run theatre group, part of Clarkson University and supported by the Clarkson University Student Association (CUSA). The mission of CTC is to provide both theatrical entertainment and an outlet for artistic self-expression in the realm of the theatre arts at Clarkson. Membership consists of students and faculty from Clarkson and the other Associated Colleges of the St. Lawrence Valley (SUNY Potsdam, SUNY Canton, and St. Lawrence University)

Every fall, CTC puts on a musical over Clarkson University&#x27;s family weekend, sometime in mid-to-late October. The production time for this show is between 5 and 7 weeks. After the fall production is over, preparations for the One Act Festival begin. This festival is made up of short plays chosen and directed by students, as well as several written by students. This festival is usually put on as a fundraiser for a charity chosen by the executive board, and takes place at the end of January or beginning of February. The next show, usually a straight play, is put on near the beginning of April. Show choice for each slot is not limited to either a musical or play, but it is traditional to use this structure; as shows are chosen by a general member vote, however, any show can be chosen to be put on any semester.

Wes Craven, creator of the A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise, was a professor at Clarkson University in 1968, as well as faculty adviser to the Clarkson Drama Club (the predecessor of the current Clarkson Theatre Company). As part of one of Professor Craven&#x27;s classes, Humanities IV, several Theta Chi members wanted to make a spoof of traditional horror movies, about the strange occurrences in their fraternity&#x27;s house at 18 Elm Street. The filming included CTC&#x27;s home, Old Snell Hall, where the boiler room scene took place in the basement. While none of those involved had very much film experience, they made the film for about $300 and it was shown twice on campus. Much of Craven&#x27;s inspiration for &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; came from this first filmmaking experience; the house in the movie, while not the house used in the first version, resembles this house and also resides on Elm Street.

===Fraternities and sororities===
Clarkson social fraternities began organizing on campus in 1903. Several local organizations accepted members from both Clarkson and SUNY Potsdam. In 1977, the first Clarkson-only sorority was founded, and in 1987, Clarkson discontinued recognition of the local sororities at SUNY Potsdam. Clarkson women were still allowed to join these organizations but they could not participate in on-campus rush or live in their houses prior to other off-campus options. Over the years, there have been many different fraternities and sororities that have come and gone due to declining membership, university probationary periods, and disaffiliation from nationals. In order for the university to recognize a Greek organization, all the members must be registered Clarkson students. Additionally, any new organization applying for recognition after 1977 must affiliate with a national organization within five years to maintain recognition. Clarkson recognized international and national fraternities are Alpha Chi Rho, Delta Upsilon, Phi Kappa Sigma, Sigma Chi, Sigma Phi Epsilon, Tau Epsilon Phi and Tau Kappa Epsilon; there remains only one recognized local fraternity, Zeta Nu. Clarkson recognized international and national sororities are Delta Zeta, Phi Sigma Sigma, Theta Phi Alpha, and Kappa Delta Chi. Additionally, there are a number of professional Greek-lettered organizations: Alpha Kappa Psi, Chi Epsilon, Omega Chi Epsilon, Phi Delta Epsilon, Phi Kappa Phi, Tau Beta Pi, and Tri-Beta. Clarkson is home to a chapter of the national service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega. Clarkson also has several local fraternities that are not recognized by the school including Beta Tau, Omicron Pi Omicron, and Tau Delta Kappa.

Interfraternity Council

The Interfraternity Council (IFC) provides outlets for social interaction among the fraternity and sorority members. IFC helps to sponsor educational opportunities for all of its members and to help to promote the fraternal ideals of leadership, scholarship, service, community, and brotherhood.

Panhellenic Council

The Panhellenic Council is the governing body of the sorority system. The Panhellenic Council provides many opportunities for involvement in campus life and the fraternity and sorority system outside of the individual sororities. Recruitment, social, and educational opportunities are provided by the council. All social sororities recognized by Clarkson University adhere to the rules and regulations set by the National Panhellenic Conference.

Greek Life

Fraternities and sororities attend each other&#x27;s national philanthropy and local community service events. Greek Week and Ice Carnival have an extensive history both with the local colleges and the Potsdam community.

<text>Sian Mary Williams (; born 28 November 1964) is a Welsh journalist, current affairs presenter, and psychologist.

From 2001 until 2012, Williams regularly presented weekday editions of &quot;BBC Breakfast&quot; as well as all main news bulletins on BBC One. She presented two series of BBC One&#x27;s discussion programme &quot;Sunday Morning Live&quot; from 2014 until 2015.

From January 2016 until March 2022, she was the main presenter of &quot;5 News at 5&quot;. In March 2022 ITN announced Williams was to leave her daily presenting role. Williams said in the announcement she planned to continue with some broadcasting projects, but also devote more time to &quot;delivering psychological support&quot;. Williams is a registered counselling psychologist with the Health and Care Professions Council.

==Early life==
Williams was born in Paddington, London, to Welsh parents and was brought up in Eastbourne, East Sussex. Her mother, Katherine Rees, was from Llanelli and had moved to London training to be a nurse at St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, where Williams was born.

In 2012 Williams began training in Psychology, gaining an MSc degree from the University of Westminster, and was awarded a doctorate in Counselling Psychology in 2021 from City, University of London after working in the National Health Service and elsewhere.

==Career==
Williams joined the BBC in 1985 and began working as a reporter and producer for BBC Local Radio stations in Liverpool, Sheffield, Leeds and Manchester.

Prior to the channel&#x27;s launch in 1997, Williams joined BBC News 24 as an output editor. During screen tests for potential presenters, one applicant became unwell and Williams was asked to step into the role. Producers were impressed with her performance and they offered her the prime presenting slot of 4:00 pm to 7:00 pm alongside Gavin Esler. She remained with the channel for nearly two years before joining BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Six O&#x27;Clock News&quot; in 1999 as Special Correspondent.

Williams left &quot;BBC Breakfast&quot; on 15 March 2012 after the programme&#x27;s production team was relocated to Salford. In 2012 she rejoined BBC Radio 4 to co-present &quot;Saturday Live&quot;.

In March 2022 ITN announced Williams was to leave her daily presenting role at &quot;5 News&quot; but would continue to front &quot;Mind Matters&quot;. Williams said in the announcement she planned to continue with some broadcasting projects, but also devote more time to &quot;delivering psychological support&quot;.

She told &quot;Woman and Home&quot; magazine that she was diagnosed in 2014, a week after her 50th birthday.

He toured and recorded as a member of the Joe Ely Band and has also played with Jerry Jeff Walker, Guy Clark, Butch Hancock, Terry Allen, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Golden Bear, and other Texas musicians. Maines was a member of The Maines Brothers Band in the late 1970s and early 1980s and has contributed to alt-country releases, including Uncle Tupelo&#x27;s &quot;Anodyne&quot; and Wilco&#x27;s debut, &quot;AM&quot;.

Maines began producing some of his own music, branching out beginning with other country artists, early on starting with Terry Allen&#x27;s seminal 1979 album, &quot;Lubbock (On Everything)&quot;. He has produced and worked on recording projects with numerous artists, including Parker McCollum, The Chicks, Bad Livers, Richard Buckner, Roger Creager, Anna Fermin&#x27;s Trigger Gospel, Pat Green, Butch Hancock, Wayne Hancock, Terri Hendrix, Rita Hosking, Ray Wylie Hubbard, Intocable, Robert Earl Keen, Lost Gonzo Band, Bob Livingston, Charlie Robison, Owen Temple, Two Tons of Steel, Jerry Jeff Walker, The Waybacks, Dale Watson and Martin Zellar. He frequently tours with Terri Hendrix throughout the United States, and is a major part of her band and production as an artist.

Maines won a Grammy Award for Best Country Album in 2003 as producer of the album &quot;Home&quot; by The Chicks&#x27; (formerly known as the Dixie Chicks). As the father of Natalie Maines, lead singer of The Chicks, he was instrumental in bringing the current lineup of bandmates together in 1995, which jump-started their sudden popularity and change in sound. Susan Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Wide Open Spaces&quot;, which had been sent to Maines, proved to be a hit from their debut album, and has remained their signature song.

As of 2020, Lloyd Maines, on guitars, has accompanied singer/songwriter Terri Hendrix live and in recordings since 1997 and her second album.

Maines has twice been inducted into the West Texas Walk of Fame — in 1993 as a member of the Maines Brothers Band and in 2012 in his own name.

<text>Hilbert College is a private Franciscan college in Hamburg, New York. The college is named after Colette Hilbert of the Franciscan Sisters of Saint Joseph, who founded the school in 1957 to train teachers.

Bogel Hall and McGrath Library were the first buildings to open when the college moved from the FSSJ Motherhouse to the new Hamburg campus in 1969. St. Joseph Residence Hall and the Campus Center opened the following year. The college later added four new apartment-style residence buildings (2003); Trinity Hall (2009), Paczesny Hall (2006), and the Swan Auditorium (2006).

<doc id="523154" wikidata="Q7177146" url="?curid=523154" title="Peter Strauss Ranch">
<text>The Peter Strauss Ranch is a regional park unit of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area - and operated by the National Park Service as Peter Strauss Ranch Park. It is located in the central Santa Monica Mountains — on Mulholland Highway near Agoura Hills, Southern California, in the Western United States. The ranch is named after the actor Peter Strauss, who was the last private owner-resident of the property. Much of the ranch was destroyed during the Woolsey Fire in November 2018.

==Geography==
The Peter Strauss Ranch Park is noted for its extensive California oak woodlands and montane chaparral habitats traversed by a walking path and hiking trail. The moister area along Triunfo Creek has a riparian zone density of plants and animals. The park&#x27;s habitats represent the California chaparral and woodlands Ecoregion - with the diverse species of the flora of the Santa Monica Mountains.

Recreational facilities, beyond trails, also include guided nature walks and programs, a swimming pool and the Lake Enchanto Dam, and a stone ranch house with a large terrazzo patio available for outdoor social events, including concerts, weddings, picnics, and art exhibits. 

==History==
The area was inhabited by the Chumash people for up to 8,000 years. After Spanish colonization of Alta California, it was taken to become part of the Rancho Las Virgenes land grant. After California became one of the United States in 1850, the area was surveyed in 1881 to confirm the grant&#x27;s land patent. A California live oak (&quot;Quercus agrifolia&quot;) that was used as a marker in the survey still stands, just west of the swimming pool, with an upside-down letter &quot;T&quot; still visible in the bark.

===20th century===
In the early 20th century, the automobile manufacturer Harry Miller, famous for his patented master carburetor featured at the Indianapolis 500, purchased the ranch as a weekend retreat from his factory and residence in Los Angeles. In 1926, Miller built the current stone ranch house, the look-out tower, and the aviary. He held grand parties there during Prohibition, having someone watch for the cops from the tower. The man would then run to the house to warn them to put the booze away. Miller also maintained a private zoo on the grounds. During the Great Depression, Miller suffered financial ruin after attempting to build aircraft engines, forcing him to sell the property.

In the mid-1930s, the property was purchased by Warren Shobert and Arthur Edeson, who renamed the property &quot;Shoson&quot; and transformed it into a recreational fairyland resort for children and adults. The Lake Encanto Dam, creating Lake Encanto, was constructed on Triunfo Creek. The resort was later renamed &quot;Lake Enchanto.&quot; Competition from other, larger amusement parks and resorts led to the decline of Lake Enchanto, which fell into disrepair and closed around 1960.

In 1976, actor Peter Strauss purchased the property after being moved by the area&#x27;s natural beauty while filming the mini-series &quot;Rich Man, Poor Man&quot; at nearby Malibu Lake. Strauss restored the property to a more natural look and lived there until 1983, when he sold it to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. The National Park Service purchased the ranch in 1987.

===Woolsey Fire damage===
On November 14, 2018, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; published images showing ruined structures on the site and reported that the Ranch was reduced to &quot;charred remnants.&quot; The stage was rebuilt in the natural amphitheater and concerts resumed in 2022.

<text>Cazenovia College was a private college in Cazenovia, New York. Founded as the Genesee Seminary in 1824 and sponsored by the Methodist Church in 1894, the college adopted the name of Cazenovia Seminary. It was reorganized in 1942 after church sponsorship was withdrawn and was Cazenovia College for Women from 1961 to 1982, when the college became co-educational again. It closed on June 30, 2023, due to poor finances and other economic issues.

== History ==

Cazenovia College began in 1824 as the Genesee Seminary and was the second Methodist seminary to be established in the United States. Between 1904 and 1931, it functioned as a secondary school for local young people, an arrangement that ended when Cazenovia Central High School was built. It was sponsored by the Methodist Church but was a non-sectarian institution. It was initially located in the old Madison County Courthouse. Cazenovia was co-educational from its foundation. The seminary was created at the instigation of George Peck and several other prominent clergymen in the area. In 1839, the seminary initiated a &quot;three year course&quot;, as it was called, which was focused at the education of women. The seminary also had a missionary course, and in 1843 Sophronia Farrington (class of 1828) went out as the first female missionary to Africa, under the auspices of the Young Men&#x27;s Missionary Society of Boston. This was the earliest foreign mission established by the Methodist Episcopal Church.

Later the institution was known as Cazenovia Seminary. It was known as the Oneida and Genesee Conference Seminary, the Oneida Conference Seminary, and the Central New York Conference Seminary over the years. It did not officially adopt the name Cazenovia Seminary until 1894 but the name was at times used from its inception and is often used to refer to it at any time before it became a college.

In 1942 church sponsorship of Cazenovia was withdrawn and it was reorganized to include a junior college program as well as the prep school with the name of Cazenovia Junior College. It then became Cazenovia College for Women in 1961. In 1982 it returned to being co-educational and adopted its final name, Cazenovia College, although it was not recognized as a bachelor&#x27;s degree-granting institution until 1988. In 2019 it began its first graduate program, a Master of Science in Clinical Mental Health Counseling.

In September 2022, after a failed attempt to refinance debt, the college defaulted on a $25 million bond payment owed to the Madison County Capital Resource Corporation. On December 7, 2022, it was announced that the school would permanently close, citing poor finances as the main reason. In April 2023, the entire campus was put up for sale by A&amp;G Real Estate Partners. The final commencement took place on May 13, 2023. In addition, there was an online-only session of summer classes ending June 25, 2023 with a final closure date of June 30, 2023. The final president of the college was David Bergh. The college&#x27;s records are maintained by nearby Le Moyne College. 

In July 2023 it was announced that the New York State Police would use the former campus as a temporary home of a state police training academy. The state police plan to use the site for the next two years while the campus is on the market to be sold.

The temporary police training academy site is scheduled to close in 2025.

== Athletics ==
The Cazenovia athletic teams were called the Wildcats. The college was a member of the NCAA Division III ranks, primarily competing in the North Atlantic Conference (NAC) from 2020–21 until its closure. The Wildcats previously competed in the North Eastern Athletic Conference (now known as the United East Conference) from 2004 to 2020.

Cazenovia competed in 16 intercollegiate varsity sports. Men&#x27;s sports included baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer and swimming &amp; diving, while women&#x27;s sports included basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming &amp; diving, equestrian and volleyball. There was also a co-ed eSports team. At various times, Cazenovia also had men&#x27;s crew, equestrian, tennis and volleyball, as well as women&#x27;s cheerleading, crew and tennis teams, but they no longer existed at the time of the college&#x27;s closure in 2023.

<text>The Palos Verdes blue (&quot;Glaucopsyche lygdamus palosverdesensis&quot;) is a small endangered butterfly native to the Palos Verdes Peninsula in southwest Los Angeles County, California, United States. As its distribution has been proven to be limited to one single site, it has one of the best claims to being the world&#x27;s rarest butterfly.

==Overview==
The Palos Verdes blue (&quot;G. l. palosverdesensis&quot;) is a localized subspecies of the silvery blue (&quot;G. lygdamus&quot;), which ranges over much of North America. It was described in 1977, shortly before it became one of the second groups of butterflies to be listed under the US Endangered Species Act in 1980. It is distinguished from other subspecies of &quot;G. lygdamus&quot; by its slightly different patterning on the underside of the wing and an earlier flight period. The subspecies was described from the southern slope of the Palos Verdes Peninsula in coastal Los Angeles County.

The Palos Verdes blue butterfly was thought to be driven to extinction in 1983, primarily by development of its habitat. The last three to six known individuals were seen and photographed in March, 1983, but the site they occupied was scraped shortly after for fire control. In 1994, the butterfly was rediscovered by Rick Rogers, Rudi Mattoni, and Timothy Dahlum at the Defense Fuel Support Point in San Pedro, which is located on the northern (inland) side of the Palos Verdes Peninsula. This new population lays eggs on an additional food plant (common deerweed, &quot;Lotus scoparius&quot;) but shares physical and behavioral characteristics with the other now-extinct populations.

==Biology==
===Taxonomy and systematics===
&quot;Glaucopsyche lygdamus palosverdesensis&quot; is a subspecies of &quot;Glaucopsyche lygdamus&quot; (the &quot;silvery blue&quot;), a species of butterfly found throughout North America. There are currently 11 subspecies of silvery blue. &quot;G. lygdamus palosverdesensis&quot; was first described in the 1970s and was distinguished from other &quot;G. lygdamus&quot; by its faster and early flight, wing color and wing spot patterns.

===Morphology===
The Palos Verdes blue butterfly has a wingspan of only . The male has a bright silvery-blue dorsal wing outlined in a narrow line of black, while the female&#x27;s dorsal wing is a more brownish-gray colour. Both males and females have gray ventral wings with dark spots surrounded by white rings.

===Habitat===
&quot;G. lygdamus palosverdesensis&quot; persists particularly on the Palos Verdes Peninsula, 15 miles south of Los Angeles, in a coastal sage scrub habitat. This subspecies is locally monophagous, or particular to one species of food plant. The entire subspecies was originally thought to be particular only to the locoweed or rattlepod (&quot;Astragalus trichopodus lonchus&quot;), but the population rediscovered in 1994 used common deerweed (&quot;Lotus scoparius&quot;) as its larval food plant. These two types of plants are fast becoming scarce on the Palos Verdes Peninsula because of housing development. Retention of these larval food plants is essential for conservation of the Palos Verdes blue.

===Life stages===
Oviposition, laying of eggs on the larval food plant, occurs only once a breeding season for the Palos Verdes blue. There are at least four larval instars, or stages of development. After 7 to 10 days the larvae emerge and crawl to the base of the food plant where they pupate. Pupae remain in diapause until emerging as adults. The flight period and reproductive period occur together, beginning in late January and ending in early May. It is rare to see the Palos Verdes blue far from its home food patch, but research shows that males cover more distance and have longer periods of flight. Palos Verdes blues are a diurnal and panmictic subspecies. They are also non-migratory and very particular in their use of larval food plants. Their adult lifespan is only five days.

===Relationships with other species===
Interspecific competition may occur with other lycaenid butterflies for the larval food plant. A mutualism between ants and larvae has been observed during the instars of butterfly development. &quot;G. l. palosverdesensis&quot; has a host-parasite relationship with its larval food plants, &quot;Astragalus lonchus&quot; and &quot;Lotus scoparius&quot;. Predation by western yellowjackets (&quot;Vespula pensylvanica&quot;) on the Palos Verdes blue has also been observed at the Defense Fuel Point location.

==Conservation==
===Laws===
&quot;G. lygdamus palosverdesensis&quot; was listed as an &quot;endangered species&quot; by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service on July 2, 1980. This listing also included city-owned critical habitat, plus comments and recommendations for species conservation. Insects are not currently protected by California laws.

===Threats===
The main threat to the Palos Verdes blue has been habitat destruction due to weeds and rototilling, which has negative effects on the essential larval food plants. Recreational, commercial, or residential development of the Palos Verdes Peninsula is also a major concern in preservation of the food plants.

===Court case===
In 1982, the city of Rancho Palos Verdes bulldozed the then most extensive known habitat of the butterfly to build a baseball field, an act believed to have been a principal cause of the die-off of the subspecies before its rediscovery in 1994. The US Fish and Wildlife Service maintained that the city was &quot;well aware&quot; of the butterfly and the site status. According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, the mayor of the city &quot;said no one complained about butterfly destruction until grading had been completed.&quot; In 1987, the city was charged by the federal government with violating the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The case was dismissed later that year by a federal court, which said a municipality was not a person for purposes of the ESA, and thus could not be held criminally responsible. The following year, the US Congress responded by amending the act to include any &quot;individual, corporation, partnership, trust, association, or any other private entity; or any officer, employee, agent, department, or instrumentality of the Federal Government, of any State, municipality, or political subdivision of a State, or of any federal government; any State, municipality, or political subdivision of a State; or any other entity subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.&quot;

===Reintroduction===
The Palos Verdes Peninsula is split into the north and south slopes. On the north slope, reintroduction is suggested based on presence of deerweed (&quot;Lotus scoparius&quot;) and a native plant index number. The only habitat known so far on the north slope is the Defense Fuel Support Point location. The south slope has many more historic sites of Palos Verdes blue, which are all suggested for reintroduction, including any more sites containing locoweed (&quot;Astragalus&quot;). Particular sites of reintroduction and rehabilitation of the Palos Verdes blue include Defense Fuel Support Point in San Pedro and the Linden H. Chandler Preserve.
In conjunction with other organizations, the Palos Verdes Peninsula Land Conservancy is installing and maintaining coastal sage scrub habitat on the slopes around the fuel tanks to benefit the blue butterfly. The Urban Wildlands Group, a nonprofit organization &quot;dedicated to the conservation of species, habitats, and ecological processes in urban and urbanizing areas&quot;, conducts the captive breeding program. This program is a collaboration with Moorpark College and is directed by Moorpark College professor Dr. Jana Johnson.

Since that time, the Defense Logistics Agency, which operates the facility, has funded habitat restoration and a breeding program for the blue butterfly. Honey, produced on the premises, is provided to the captive rearing program so the butterflies are able to feed on the same food source as its wild companions. Major Jason Pike, an entomologist for the Defense Logistics Agency who has been monitoring the project, commented, &quot;The military takes its responsibilities for endangered species on its properties very seriously, and DLA is pleased to provide support for the blue butterfly project.&quot;

===Mass rearing===
Mass rearing of the Palos Verdes blue has been taking place since rediscovery in 1994. The mass rearing is conducted for conservation purposes, reintroduction and prevention of extinction. The mass rearing takes place in &quot;tent&quot; cages containing both known larval food plants. It has been variably successful. In 2008, 2,400 butterflies were raised in a laboratory at Moorpark College. In addition to accepting the conditions of the butterflies&#x27; protected status, landowners seeking to house the butterflies needed to prove they could provide sufficient numbers of &quot;yellow-flowering deer weed plants.&quot;

===Modeling===
Although population viability analysis models are often very important for predicting the outcome of conservation efforts, there have been many problems with using population viability analysis models to predict Palos Verdes blue populations. This type of modeling has proved inconclusive mainly because the Palos Verdes blue utilizes habitat so variably, depending on climatic and successional changes. So far, the appropriate habitat has been hard to find, and expert intuition has often been wrong. Long-term population studies are not available to provide this information because of the many local extinctions and declining numbers of this subspecies. For this reason, the subspecies long-term viability is very difficult to predict.

===Key conservationists===
Current conservation efforts are supported by the Defense Logistics Agency and the U.S. Navy and implemented by the Palos Verdes Peninsula Land Conservancy, The Urban Wildlands Group, and The Butterfly Project led by biologist Jana J. Johnson at Moorpark College. The Youth Environmental Service program of the Palos Verdes / South Bay Audubon Society and other volunteer groups have provided help weeding and establishing habitat for the butterfly. The Youth Environmental Service (YES) program started in 2012 and focuses on conserving the Linden H. Chandler Preserve, where they work on restoring native plants for the Palos Verdes blue butterfly.

<text>In abstract algebra, the free monoid on a set is the monoid whose elements are all the finite sequences (or strings) of zero or more elements from that set, with string concatenation as the monoid operation and with the unique sequence of zero elements, often called the empty string and denoted by ε or λ, as the identity element. The free monoid on a set &quot;A&quot; is usually denoted &quot;A&quot;∗. The free semigroup on &quot;A&quot; is the subsemigroup of &quot;A&quot;∗ containing all elements except the empty string. It is usually denoted &quot;A&quot;+.

More generally, an abstract monoid (or semigroup) &quot;S&quot; is described as free if it is isomorphic to the free monoid (or semigroup) on some set.

As the name implies, free monoids and semigroups are those objects which satisfy the usual universal property defining free objects, in the respective categories of monoids and semigroups. It follows that every monoid (or semigroup) arises as a homomorphic image of a free monoid (or semigroup). The study of semigroups as images of free semigroups is called combinatorial semigroup theory.

Free monoids (and monoids in general) are associative, by definition; that is, they are written without any parenthesis to show grouping or order of operation. The non-associative equivalent is the free magma.

== Examples ==

=== Natural numbers ===
The monoid (N0,+) of natural numbers (including zero) under addition is a free monoid on a singleton free generator, in this case, the natural number 1. 
According to the formal definition, this monoid consists of all sequences like &quot;1&quot;, &quot;1+1&quot;, &quot;1+1+1&quot;, &quot;1+1+1+1&quot;, and so on, including the empty sequence. 
Mapping each such sequence to its evaluation result
and the empty sequence to zero establishes an isomorphism from the set of such sequences to N0.
This isomorphism is compatible with &quot;+&quot;, that is, for any two sequences &quot;s&quot; and &quot;t&quot;, if &quot;s&quot; is mapped (i.e. evaluated) to a number &quot;m&quot; and &quot;t&quot; to &quot;n&quot;, then their concatenation &quot;s&quot;+&quot;t&quot; is mapped to the sum &quot;m&quot;+&quot;n&quot;.

=== Kleene star ===
In formal language theory, usually a finite set of &quot;symbols&quot; A (sometimes called the alphabet) is considered. A finite sequence of symbols is called a &quot;word over &quot;A&quot;&quot;, and the free monoid &quot;A&quot;∗ is called the &quot;Kleene star of &quot;A&quot;&quot;.
Thus, the abstract study of formal languages can be thought of as the study of subsets of finitely generated free monoids. 

For example, assuming an alphabet &quot;A&quot; = {&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;}, its Kleene star &quot;A&quot;∗ contains all concatenations of &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot;:
:{ε, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;ab&quot;, &quot;ba&quot;, &quot;caa&quot;, &quot;&quot;, ...}.

If &quot;A&quot; is any set, the &quot;word length&quot; function on &quot;A&quot;∗ is the unique monoid homomorphism from &quot;A&quot;∗ to (N0,+) that maps each element of &quot;A&quot; to 1. A free monoid is thus a graded monoid. (A graded monoid formula_1 is a monoid that can be written as formula_2. Each formula_3 is a grade; the grading here is just the length of the string. That is, formula_3 contains those strings of length formula_5 The formula_6 symbol here can be taken to mean &quot;set union&quot;; it is used instead of the symbol formula_7 because, in general, set unions might not be monoids, and so a distinct symbol is used. By convention, gradations are always written with the formula_6 symbol.)

There are deep connections between the theory of semigroups and that of automata. For example, every formal language has a syntactic monoid that recognizes that language. For the case of a regular language, that monoid is isomorphic to the transition monoid associated to the semiautomaton of some deterministic finite automaton that recognizes that language. The regular languages over an alphabet A are the closure of the finite subsets of A*, the free monoid over A, under union, product, and generation of submonoid. 

For the case of concurrent computation, that is, systems with locks, mutexes or thread joins, the computation can be described with history monoids and trace monoids. Roughly speaking, elements of the monoid can commute, (e.g. different threads can execute in any order), but only up to a lock or mutex, which prevent further commutation (e.g. serialize thread access to some object).

==Conjugate words==

We define a pair of words in &quot;A&quot;∗ of the form &quot;uv&quot; and &quot;vu&quot; as conjugate: the conjugates of a word are thus its circular shifts. Two words are conjugate in this sense if they are conjugate in the sense of group theory as elements of the free group generated by &quot;A&quot;.

===Equidivisibility===
A free monoid is equidivisible: if the equation &quot;mn&quot; = &quot;pq&quot; holds, then there exists an &quot;s&quot; such that either &quot;m&quot; = &quot;ps&quot;, &quot;sn&quot; = &quot;q&quot; (example see image) or &quot;ms&quot; = &quot;p&quot;, &quot;n&quot; = &quot;sq&quot;. This result is also known as Levi&#x27;s lemma.

A monoid is free if and only if it is graded (in the strong sense that only the identity has gradation 0) and equidivisible.

== Free generators and rank ==
The members of a set &quot;A&quot; are called the free generators for &quot;A&quot;∗ and &quot;A&quot;+. The superscript * is then commonly understood to be the Kleene star. More generally, if &quot;S&quot; is an abstract free monoid (semigroup), then a set of elements which maps onto the set of single-letter words under an isomorphism to a monoid &quot;A&quot;∗ (semigroup &quot;A+&quot;) is called a &quot;set of free generators&quot; for &quot;S&quot;.

Each free monoid (or semigroup) &quot;S&quot; has exactly one set of free generators, the cardinality of which is called the &quot;rank&quot; of &quot;S&quot;.

Two free monoids or semigroups are isomorphic if and only if they have the same rank. In fact, &quot;every&quot; set of generators for a free monoid or semigroup &quot;S&quot; contains the free generators, since a free generator has word length 1 and hence can only be generated by itself. It follows that a free semigroup or monoid is finitely generated if and only if it has finite rank.

A submonoid &quot;N&quot; of &quot;A&quot;∗ is stable if &quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, &quot;ux&quot;, &quot;xv&quot; in &quot;N&quot; together imply &quot;x&quot; in &quot;N&quot;. A submonoid of &quot;A&quot;∗ is stable if and only if it is free.
For example, using the set of bits { &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot; } as &quot;A&quot;, the set &quot;N&quot; of all bit strings containing an even number of &quot;1&quot;s is a stable submonoid because if &quot;u&quot; contains an even number of &quot;1&quot;s, and &quot;ux&quot; as well, then &quot;x&quot; must contain an even number of &quot;1&quot;s, too. While &quot;N&quot; cannot be freely generated by any set of single bits, it &quot;can&quot; be freely generated by the set of bit strings { &quot;0&quot;, &quot;11&quot;, &quot;101&quot;, &quot;1001&quot;, &quot;10001&quot;, ... } – the set of strings of the form &quot;10&quot;n&quot;1&quot; for some nonnegative integer &quot;n&quot; (along with the string &quot;0&quot;).

===Codes===
A set of free generators for a free monoid &quot;P&quot; is referred to as a basis for P: a set of words &quot;C&quot; is a code if &quot;C&quot;* is a free monoid and &quot;C&quot; is a basis. A set &quot;X&quot; of words in &quot;A&quot;∗ is a prefix, or has the prefix property, if it does not contain a proper (string) prefix of any of its elements. Every prefix in &quot;A&quot;+ is a code, indeed a prefix code.

A submonoid &quot;N&quot; of &quot;A&quot;∗ is right unitary if &quot;x&quot;, &quot;xy&quot; in &quot;N&quot; implies &quot;y&quot; in &quot;N&quot;. A submonoid is generated by a prefix if and only if it is right unitary.

==Factorization==

A factorization of a free monoid is a sequence of subsets of words with the property that every word in the free monoid can be written as a concatenation of elements drawn from the subsets. The Chen–Fox–Lyndon theorem states that the Lyndon words furnish a factorization. More generally, Hall words provide a factorization; the Lyndon words are a special case of the Hall words.

==Free hull==
The intersection of free submonoids of a free monoid &quot;A&quot;∗ is again free. If &quot;S&quot; is a subset of a free monoid &quot;A&quot;* then the intersection of all free submonoids of &quot;A&quot;* containing &quot;S&quot; is well-defined, since &quot;A&quot;* itself is free, and contains &quot;S&quot;; it is a free monoid and called the free hull of &quot;S&quot;. A basis for this intersection is a code.

The defect theorem states that if &quot;X&quot; is finite and &quot;C&quot; is the basis of the free hull of &quot;X&quot;, then either &quot;X&quot; is a code and &quot;C&quot; = &quot;X&quot;, or

:|&quot;C&quot;| ≤ |&quot;X&quot;| − 1 .

==Morphisms==
A monoid morphism &quot;f&quot; from a free monoid &quot;B&quot;∗ to a monoid &quot;M&quot; is a map such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;xy&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)⋅&quot;f&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) for words &quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot; and &quot;f&quot;(ε) = ι, where ε and ι denote the identity elements of &quot;B&quot;∗ and &quot;M&quot;, respectively. The morphism &quot;f&quot; is determined by its values on the letters of &quot;B&quot; and conversely any map from &quot;B&quot; to &quot;M&quot; extends to a morphism. A morphism is non-erasing or continuous if no letter of &quot;B&quot; maps to ι and trivial if every letter of &quot;B&quot; maps to ι.

A morphism &quot;f&quot; from a free monoid &quot;B&quot;∗ to a free monoid &quot;A&quot;∗ is total if every letter of &quot;A&quot; occurs in some word in the image of &quot;f&quot;; cyclic or periodic if the image of &quot;f&quot; is contained in {&quot;w&quot;}∗ for some word &quot;w&quot; of &quot;A&quot;∗. A morphism &quot;f&quot; is &quot;k&quot;-uniform if the length |&quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;)| is constant and equal to &quot;k&quot; for all &quot;a&quot; in &quot;A&quot;. A 1-uniform morphism is strictly alphabetic or a coding.

A morphism &quot;f&quot; from a free monoid &quot;B&quot;∗ to a free monoid &quot;A&quot;∗ is simplifiable if there is an alphabet &quot;C&quot; of cardinality less than that of &quot;B&quot; such the morphism &quot;f&quot; factors through &quot;C&quot;∗, that is, it is the composition of a morphism from &quot;B&quot;∗ to &quot;C&quot;∗ and a morphism from that to &quot;A&quot;∗; otherwise &quot;f&quot; is elementary. The morphism &quot;f&quot; is called a code if the image of the alphabet &quot;B&quot; under &quot;f&quot; is a code. Every elementary morphism is a code.

===Test sets===
For &quot;L&quot; a subset of &quot;B&quot;∗, a finite subset &quot;T&quot; of &quot;L&quot; is a &quot;test set&quot; for &quot;L&quot; if morphisms &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; on &quot;B&quot;∗ agree on &quot;L&quot; if and only if they agree on &quot;T&quot;. The Ehrenfeucht conjecture is that any subset &quot;L&quot; has a test set: it has been proved independently by Albert and Lawrence; McNaughton; and Guba. The proofs rely on Hilbert&#x27;s basis theorem.

===Map and fold===

The computational embodiment of a monoid morphism is a map followed by a fold. In this setting, the free monoid on a set &quot;A&quot; corresponds to lists of elements from &quot;A&quot; with concatenation as the binary operation. A monoid homomorphism from the free monoid to any other monoid (&quot;M&quot;,•) is a function &quot;f&quot; such that
* &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;1...&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;1) • ... • &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;)
* &quot;f&quot;() = &quot;e&quot;
where &quot;e&quot; is the identity on &quot;M&quot;. Computationally, every such homomorphism corresponds to a map operation applying &quot;f&quot; to all the elements of a list, followed by a fold operation which combines the results using the binary operator •. This computational paradigm (which can be generalized to non-associative binary operators) has inspired the MapReduce software framework.

==Endomorphisms==
An endomorphism of &quot;A&quot;∗ is a morphism from &quot;A&quot;∗ to itself. The identity map &quot;I&quot; is an endomorphism of &quot;A&quot;∗, and the endomorphisms form a monoid under composition of functions.

An endomorphism &quot;f&quot; is prolongable if there is a letter &quot;a&quot; such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) = &quot;as&quot; for a non-empty string &quot;s&quot;.

===String projection===
The operation of string projection is an endomorphism. That is, given a letter &quot;a&quot; ∈ Σ and a string &quot;s&quot; ∈ Σ∗, the string projection &quot;p&quot;a(&quot;s&quot;) removes every occurrence of &quot;a&quot; from &quot;s&quot;; it is formally defined by

:formula_9

Note that string projection is well-defined even if the rank of the monoid is infinite, as the above recursive definition works for all strings of finite length. String projection is a morphism in the category of free monoids, so that

:formula_10

where formula_11 is understood to be the free monoid of all finite strings that don&#x27;t contain the letter &quot;a&quot;. Projection commutes with the operation of string concatenation, so that formula_12 for all strings &quot;s&quot; and &quot;t&quot;. There are many right inverses to string projection, and thus it is a split epimorphism.

The identity morphism is formula_13 defined as formula_14 for all strings &quot;s&quot;, and formula_15. 

String projection is commutative, as clearly

:formula_16

For free monoids of finite rank, this follows from the fact that free monoids of the same rank are isomorphic, as projection reduces the rank of the monoid by one.

String projection is idempotent, as

:formula_17

for all strings &quot;s&quot;. Thus, projection is an idempotent, commutative operation, and so it forms a bounded semilattice or a commutative band.

==The free commutative monoid==
Given a set &quot;A&quot;, the free commutative monoid on &quot;A&quot; is the set of all finite multisets with elements drawn from &quot;A&quot;, with the monoid operation being multiset sum and the monoid unit being the empty multiset.

For example, if &quot;A&quot; = {&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;}, elements of the free commutative monoid on &quot;A&quot; are of the form
:{ε, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;ab&quot;, &quot;a&quot;2&quot;b&quot;, &quot;ab&quot;3&quot;c&quot;4, ...}.

The fundamental theorem of arithmetic states that the monoid of positive integers under multiplication is a free commutative monoid on an infinite set of generators, the prime numbers.

The free commutative semigroup is the subset of the free commutative monoid that contains all multisets with elements drawn from &quot;A&quot; except the empty multiset.

The free partially commutative monoid, or &quot;trace monoid&quot;, is a generalization that encompasses both the free and free commutative monoids as instances. This generalization finds applications in combinatorics and in the study of parallelism in computer science.

<doc id="523171" wikidata="Q7981631" url="?curid=523171" title="Wells College">
<text>Wells College was a private liberal arts college in Aurora, New York, located in the Finger Lakes region of New York. The college had cross-enrollment with Cornell University and Ithaca College. For much of its history it was a women&#x27;s college. It was within the Aurora Village–Wells College Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The college was closed by the board of trustees and president of the college at the end of the spring 2024 semester, citing financial difficulties. The closure process was expected to continue through the end of 2024.

==History==

The college was established as a women&#x27;s college in 1868, called Wells Seminary, by Henry Wells, co-founder of Wells Fargo and the American Express Company. Wells had the building for Wells Seminary constructed on property he donated, declining an invitation from Ezra Cornell to build a new campus in the (relatively) more cosmopolitan Ithaca. Two years later, in 1870, the seminary adopted the name, Wells College. On August 9, 1888, the college&#x27;s main building burned to the ground. The building was replaced in 1890 by the so-called new Main Building, designed by architect William Henry Miller.
In 1906, Henry Wells&#x27; 1852 mansion, Glen Park, was purchased by the Alumnae Association and given to the college for its use.

In 1886, Frances Folsom, Wells Class of 1885, married President Grover Cleveland and became the youngest First Lady of the United States. She was the only First Lady to have her wedding in the White House, and she was the first First Lady to have graduated from college. Frances Cleveland (later Preston, after her second marriage) served on the college&#x27;s board of trustees for 50 years.

In 1965, Walter Netsch designed the Louis Jefferson Long Library. The design of this award-winning and locally landmarked building is a prime example of Netsch&#x27;s use of &quot;field theory&quot; and inspired two other buildings on campus, Barler Music Hall and Campbell Art Building.

===Coeducation===
After 136 years as an historically women&#x27;s college, on October 2, 2004, the Wells College Office of the President and the Board of Directors announced, with no prior involvement from student body or alumni, that the institution would become coeducational in 2005, in order to increase enrollment. Students and alumni protested against the change. Some parents also became involved in the protests. Some students said their protests were patterned after ones at Mills College in the early 1990s. A website entitled &quot;Wells for Women&quot; was established to organize support. After the college&#x27;s decision to adopt coeducation was approved by its board, students filed a lawsuit, which the courts rejected.

===Financial difficulties===
In 2020, the president of Wells College, Jonathan Gibralter, sent a letter to the college community reporting that financial issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic threatened the college&#x27;s future, writing, &quot;If New York State continues its mandate that our campus remain closed through all or part of the [2020] fall semester, Wells simply will not receive enough revenue to continue operations.&quot; With about 15% of Wells College&#x27;s operating revenue coming from its Italy-based study abroad program, COVID-19-related impacts significantly affected the college&#x27;s finances.

On April 29, 2024, the college president and the chair of the college&#x27;s board of trustees announced that the college would close at the end of the spring 2024 semester due to financial difficulties. The university community, including 352 students and 150 staff were provided no prior notice to make arrangements. It was announced that Manhattanville University would maintain the college&#x27;s transcripts, business records, and other important artifacts.

The closure began May 31, 2024, &quot;with full closure expected by the end of [2024]&quot;. On July 1, 2024, Susan Henking was appointed president to oversee the closure.

==Academics==

In 2023, &quot;U.S. News&quot; ranked Wells at 152 (tied) among liberal arts colleges nationally. Additionally, &quot;U.S. News&quot; ranked Wells at 10 (tied) in Top Performers on Social Mobility.

Wells College had several study abroad programs, most notably in Florence, Italy. It had created centers in sustainability, business and entrepreneurship, and book arts. Undergraduate students were required to participate in at least two internships during their time at Wells, one of which had to be off-campus.

Wells had an honor code to which all students subscribed. By signing the Honor Code, Wells students pledged &quot;not to lie, cheat, steal, deceive, or conceal in the conduct of their collegiate life&quot;. Wells allowed students to have take-home exams and to work in their residence hall rooms, at the library, or on the dock by the lake, rather than only in classrooms.

==Athletics==

As a member of the Private College Athletic Conference throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, the &quot;Express&quot; sports teams of the college captured four consecutive conference championships in women&#x27;s tennis (1977–78, 1978–79, 1979–80, 1980–81). They also won titles in women&#x27;s bowling (1978–79, 1979–80). Wells, which officially became an NCAA Division III institution prior to the 1986–87 athletic season, joined the Atlantic Women&#x27;s Colleges Conference (AWCC) prior to the 1996–97 athletic season. In 1996, the Wells women&#x27;s soccer team captured the school&#x27;s only AWCC championship title. At the time, Wells offered six intercollegiate athletic sports: field hockey, softball, women&#x27;s lacrosse, women&#x27;s soccer, women&#x27;s swimming and women&#x27;s tennis.
In 2005, as part of the Board of Trustees&#x27; decision to accept men to the traditionally all-women&#x27;s college, Wells incorporated men&#x27;s soccer, men&#x27;s swimming, and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country into their athletic cadre. 
Prior to the 2007–08 academic year, the Express teams were invited to join the North Eastern Athletic Conference (NEAC) and compete against 14 other schools in the East Region. In joining the NEAC, Wells competed for conference championships and the opportunity to receive an automatic qualifier to participate in the NCAA tournament in select sports. Ultimately, Wells captured six conference championships in the NEAC. Men&#x27;s swimming won the first league title in 2009–10, and earned a second title in 2012–13. Women&#x27;s swimming have won three consecutive conference championships, during the 2011–12, 2012–13, and 2013–14 seasons. Men&#x27;s basketball won the NEAC championship in 2010–11 and was the first team from Wells to participate in the NCAA Tournament.

In the 2018–19 season, the Wells men&#x27;s volleyball team made it to the Elite 8 (Quarterfinals) in the NCAA Division III Men&#x27;s Volleyball Tournament before falling to Stevens Institute of Technology. In the 2019–20 season, the Wells College women&#x27;s swim team won first place in the NEAC swimming championships. In 2021, the NEAC rebranded and became the United East Conference. For the next two athletic seasons, Wells was a member of the United East. In 2022, the Allegheny Mountain Collegiate Conference and Wells announced the Express would become full-time members at the start of the 2023–24 school year.

As of the 2021–22 athletic season, Wells offered 15 NCAA Division III varsity sports, including field hockey, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s volleyball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country, softball, and baseball. Athletics were offered with half a PE (physical education) credit earned for each season completed.

On April 29, 2024 the college announced its closure. Despite the uncertain time, Wells athletics had a successful spring season in their lone season in the AMCC. The baseball team finished with a 19–18 overall record, while just missing the AMCC tournament by a game. The women&#x27;s lacrosse team capped off the final season in program history winning the AMCC championship and regular-season title. The Express finished the season 16–1 overall and 6–0 in conference play. Wells hosted the semifinals and championship rounds. On May 4, the Express defeated Mt. Aloysius to win the AMCC title by a score of 19–6 in what was the final sporting event in Wells College history, fitting for an institution that was founded as a women&#x27;s college. Despite winning their conference tournament, the Express did not get a bid to the NCAA Division III Women&#x27;s Lacrosse Tournament; the AMCC was not an automatic qualifying confrence, because it had only four teams competing. Between the baseball and women&#x27;s lacrosse teams, the Express accumulated a plethora of all-conference selections during the final spring 2024 season.

<doc id="523173" wikidata="Q1064600" url="?curid=523173" title="Linear separability">
<text>In Euclidean geometry, linear separability is a property of two sets of points. This is most easily visualized in two dimensions (the Euclidean plane) by thinking of one set of points as being colored blue and the other set of points as being colored red. These two sets are &quot;linearly separable&quot; if there exists at least one line in the plane with all of the blue points on one side of the line and all the red points on the other side. This idea immediately generalizes to higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces if the line is replaced by a hyperplane.

The problem of determining if a pair of sets is linearly separable and finding a separating hyperplane if they are, arises in several areas. In statistics and machine learning, classifying certain types of data is a problem for which good algorithms exist that are based on this concept.

==Mathematical definition==

Let formula_1 and formula_2 be two sets of points in an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space. Then formula_1 and formula_2 are &quot;linearly separable&quot; if there exist &quot;n&quot; + 1 real numbers formula_5, such that every point formula_6 satisfies formula_7 and every point formula_8 satisfies formula_9, where formula_10 is the formula_11-th component of formula_12.

Equivalently, two sets are linearly separable precisely when their respective convex hulls are disjoint (colloquially, do not overlap).

In simple 2D, it can also be imagined that the set of points under a linear transformation collapses into a line, on which there exists a value, k, greater than which one set of points will fall into, and lesser than which the other set of points fall.

== Examples ==

Three non-collinear points in two classes (&#x27;+&#x27; and &#x27;-&#x27;) are always linearly separable in two dimensions. This is illustrated by the three examples in the following figure (the all &#x27;+&#x27; case is not shown, but is similar to the all &#x27;-&#x27; case):

However, not all sets of four points, no three collinear, are linearly separable in two dimensions. The following example would need &quot;two&quot; straight lines and thus is not linearly separable:

Notice that three points which are collinear and of the form &quot;+ ⋅⋅⋅ — ⋅⋅⋅ +&quot; are also not linearly separable.

== Number of linear separations ==
Let formula_13 be the number of ways to linearly separate &quot;N&quot; points (in general position) in &quot;K&quot; dimensions, thenformula_14When &quot;K&quot; is large, formula_15 is very close to one when formula_16, but very close to zero when formula_17. In words, one perceptron unit can almost certainly memorize a random assignment of binary labels on N points when formula_16, but almost certainly not when formula_17.

== Linear separability of Boolean functions in &quot;n&quot; variables ==

A Boolean function in &quot;n&quot; variables can be thought of as an assignment of &quot;0&quot; or &quot;1&quot; to each vertex of a Boolean hypercube in &quot;n&quot; dimensions. This gives a natural division of the vertices into two sets. The Boolean function is said to be &quot;linearly separable&quot; provided these two sets of points are linearly separable. The number of distinct Boolean functions is formula_20where &quot;n&quot; is the number of variables passed into the function.

Such functions are also called linear threshold logic, or perceptrons. The classical theory is summarized in, as Knuth claims.

The value is only known exactly up to formula_21 case, but the order of magnitude is known quite exactly: it has upper bound formula_22 and lower bound formula_23. 

It is co-NP-complete to decide whether a Boolean function given in disjunctive or conjunctive normal form is linearly separable.

== Support vector machines==

Classifying data is a common task in machine learning.
Suppose some data points, each belonging to one of two sets, are given and we wish to create a model that will decide which set a &quot;new&quot; data point will be in. In the case of support vector machines, a data point is viewed as a &quot;p&quot;-dimensional vector (a list of &quot;p&quot; numbers), and we want to know whether we can separate such points with a (&quot;p&quot; − 1)-dimensional hyperplane. This is called a linear classifier. There are many hyperplanes that might classify (separate) the data. One reasonable choice as the best hyperplane is the one that represents the largest separation, or margin, between the two sets. So we choose the hyperplane so that the distance from it to the nearest data point on each side is maximized. If such a hyperplane exists, it is known as the &quot;maximum-margin hyperplane&quot; and the linear classifier it defines is known as a &quot;maximum margin classifier&quot;.

More formally, given some training data formula_24, a set of &quot;n&quot; points of the form

:formula_25

where the &quot;y&quot;&quot;i&quot; is either 1 or −1, indicating the set to which the point formula_26 belongs. Each formula_27 is a &quot;p&quot;-dimensional real vector. We want to find the maximum-margin hyperplane that divides the points having formula_28 from those having formula_29. Any hyperplane can be written as the set of points formula_30 satisfying

: formula_31

where formula_32 denotes the dot product and formula_33 the (not necessarily normalized) normal vector to the hyperplane. The parameter formula_34 determines the offset of the hyperplane from the origin along the normal vector formula_33.

If the training data are linearly separable, we can select two hyperplanes in such a way that they separate the data and there are no points between them, and then try to maximize their distance.

<text>Quercus agrifolia, the California live oak, or coast live oak, is an evergreen live oak native to the California Floristic Province. Live oaks are so-called because they keep living leaves on the tree all year, adding young leaves and shedding dead leaves simultaneously rather than dropping dead leaves en masse in the autumn like a true deciduous tree. Coast live oaks may be shrubby, depending on age and growing location, but is generally a medium-sized tree. It grows west of the Sierra Nevada mountain range from Mendocino County, California, south to northern Baja California in Mexico. It is classified in the red oak section of oaks (&quot;Quercus&quot; sect. &quot;Lobatae&quot;).

This species is commonly sympatric with canyon live oak (&quot;Q. chrysolepis&quot;), and the two may be hard to distinguish because their spinose leaves are superficially similar.

==Description==

Coast live oak typically has a much-branched trunk and reaches a mature height of . Some specimens may attain an age exceeding 1,000 years. Examples of this include the Grand Oak of Cherry Valley, California, the Encino Oak Tree, which died in the 1990s (part of the stump has been preserved) and the Pechanga Great Oak. The tree is extremely drought-tolerant.

The trunk, particularly for older individuals, may be highly contorted, massive and gnarled. The crown is broadly rounded and dense, especially when aged 20 to 70 years; in later life the trunk and branches are more well defined and the leaf density lower. The oldest specimens might exceed in trunk circumference and in height.

The leaves are dark green, oval, often in shape, long and broad; the leaf margin is spiny-toothed (spinose), with sharp thistly fibers that extend from the lateral leaf veins. The outer layers of leaves are designed for maximum solar absorption, containing two to three layers of photosynthetic cells.

These outer leaves are deemed to be small in size to more efficiently re-radiate the heat gained from solar capture. Shaded leaves are generally broader and thinner, having only a single layer of photosynthetic cells. The convex leaf shape may be useful for interior leaves which depend on capturing reflected light scattered in random directions from the outer canopy. The leaf shape may be also useful as condensation surfaces for &quot;dew and mist, which would allow the tree to survive years with limited rainfall&quot;.

The flowers are produced in early-to-mid spring; the male flowers are pendulous catkins long, the female flowers inconspicuous, less than long, with 1–3 clustered together. The fruit is a slender reddish brown acorn long and broad, with the basal quarter enclosed in a cupule; unusually for a red oak, the acorns mature about 7–8 months after pollination (most red oak acorns take 18 months to mature).

===Recognized varieties===
There are two varieties of &quot;Quercus agrifolia&quot;:
===Hybridity===

Several hybrids between coast live oak and other red oak species have been documented. Hybrids with interior live oak (&quot;Q. wislizenii&quot;) are known in many areas in northern California. Coast live oak also hybridizes with Shreve oak (&quot;Q. parvula&quot; var. &quot;shrevei&quot;). All these oak species show evidence of introgression with one another.

==Etymology==
In naming the species, Née compared it to a species illustrated in Leonard Plukenet&#x27;s &quot;Phytographia&quot; under the descriptive name &quot;Ilex folio agrifolii americana, forte agria, vel aquifolia glandifera&quot; which Plukenet had compared, in his &quot;Almagestum botanicum&quot;, to Luigi Anguillara&#x27;s &quot;Agrifolia glandifera&quot;, the noun &#x27;&quot;Agrifolia&quot;&#x27; being a Medieval Latin form of &#x27;&quot;Aquifolium&quot;&#x27; meaning a holly or holly-leaved oak, and related to the Modern Italian &quot;&#x27;Agrifoglio&quot;,&#x27; meaning &#x27;holly.&#x27;

==Distribution and habitat==

Normally the tree is found on well-drained soils of coastal hills and plains, often near year-round or perennial streams. It may be found in several natural communities including coast live oak woodland, Engelmann oak woodland, valley oak woodland and both northern and southern mixed evergreen forests. While normally found within of the Pacific Ocean at elevations less than , in southern California it occasionally occurs at up to in elevation.

It is the only California native oak that thrives in the coastal environment, although it is rare on the immediate shore; it enjoys the mild winter and summer climate afforded by ocean proximity, and it is somewhat tolerant of aerosol-borne sea salt. The coastal fog supplies relief from the rainless California summer heat.

It is the dominant overstory plant of the coast live oak woodland habitat, often joined by California bay laurel and California buckeye north of Big Sur. Associated understory plants include toyon, various manzanitas and western poison-oak.

== Ecology ==

The California oak moth (&quot;Phryganidia californica&quot;) caterpillar subsists entirely on living and fallen leaves of the Coast Live Oak. In 8–10 year cycles, the caterpillar will appear in sufficient abundance to denude healthy trees. The trees recover, and botanists speculate that the species provide mutual benefit, possibly in the form of fertilizer for the oak. The coast live oak is also the only known foodplant of &quot;Chionodes vanduzeei&quot; caterpillars.

Live oak trees, among other western oaks, are also known to support acorn woodpeckers, which store their acorns in tree trunks and remove them when they want to eat. 

== Allergenicity ==
The pollen of the coast live oak is a severe allergen. Pollination occurs in spring.

==Uses==

===Historical===

At least twelve distinct cultures of Native Americans are known to have consumed the acorns as a dietary staple. The seeds were ground into meal, which after being washed was boiled into mush or baked in ashes to make bread. A particular usefulness of the tree lies in its ability to yield acorns in winter season as well. In the 18th century, Spaniards in the San Fernando Valley used the wood for charcoal to fire kilns in making adobe. Later this form of charcoal would be utilized in the baking, gunpowder and electric power industries.

In the 18th and 19th centuries shipbuilders sought out the odd angular branches to make special joints. Pioneers moving west would harvest small amounts for making farm implements and wagon wheels, but the greatest impact was the wholesale clearing of oak woodlands to erect sprawling cities such as San Diego and San Francisco. The irregular shape often let the tree escape widespread harvest for building timbers, and also led the early settlers to endow the coast live oak with mystical qualities. Its stateliness has made it a subject of historical landscape painters throughout California modern history since the mid-19th century.

===Modern===

Coast live oak has also become a common addition to western US landscaping. It is however sensitive to changes in grading and drainage; in particular, it is important to respect the root crown level and avoid adding soil near the trunk when construction or landscaping occurs.

Also, if incorporating it into a landscaping scheme with artificial irrigation, it is important to avoid regular watering within the oak&#x27;s drip line (canopy), since wet soil in the summer increases infection rates by soil-borne &quot;Phytophthora&quot; diseases like sudden oak death.

Santa Maria–style barbecue is grilled over coals of coast live oak.

==Culture==
The coast live oak, especially in its Spanish forms &quot;encino&quot; or &quot;encina&quot;, &quot;encinitas&quot; &quot;little oaks&quot;, and &quot;encinal&quot; &quot;oak grove&quot;, gave its name to seven land grants across California and to many communities and geographic features. These include Rancho Los Encinos, the Los Angeles community of Encino, Encinitas near San Diego, and Encinal del Temescal, now the city of Oakland.

Paso Robles (fully &#x27;El Paso de Robles&#x27; or &#x27;Pass of the Oaks&#x27;) also refers to the ubiquitous live oaks in the region as a geographical place name.

<doc id="523179" wikidata="Q741775" url="?curid=523179" title="Enemy of the people">
<text>The terms enemy of the people and enemy of the nation are designations for the political opponents and the social-class opponents of the power group within a larger social unit, who, thus identified, can be subjected to political repression. In political praxis, the term &quot;enemy of the people&quot; implies that political opposition to the ruling power group renders the people in opposition into enemies acting against the interests of the greater social unit: society, the nation, etc.

In the 20th century, the politics of the Soviet Union (1922–1991) much featured the term &quot;enemy of the people&quot; to discredit any opposition, especially during the régime of Stalin (r. 1924–1953), when it was often applied to Trotsky. In the 21st century, U.S. president Donald Trump regularly used the &quot;enemy of the people&quot; term against critical politicians, journalists and the press.

Like the term &quot;enemy of the state&quot;, the term &quot;enemy of the people&quot; originated and derives from the , a public enemy of the Roman Empire. In literature, the term &quot;enemy of the people&quot; features in the title of the stageplay &quot;An Enemy of the People&quot; (1882), by Henrik Ibsen, and is a theme in the stageplay &quot;Coriolanus&quot; (1605), by William Shakespeare.

==Origins==
===Rome: the Republic and the Empire===
The expression &quot;enemy of the people&quot; dates to Imperial Rome. The Senate declared Emperor Nero a &quot;hostis publicus&quot; in 68 CE. Its direct translation is &quot;public enemy&quot;. Whereas &quot;public&quot; is currently used in English to describe something related to collectivity at large, with an implication towards government or the State, the Latin word &quot;publicus&quot; could, in addition to that meaning, also refer directly to people, making it the equivalent of the genitive of &quot;populus&quot; (&quot;people&quot;), &quot;populi&quot; (&quot;popular&quot; or &quot;of the people&quot;). Thus, &quot;public enemy&quot; and &quot;enemy of the people&quot; are, etymologically, near synonyms.

===French Revolution===
The words &quot;ennemi du peuple&quot; were used extensively during the French Revolution. On 25 December 1793 Robespierre stated: &quot;The revolutionary government owes to the good citizen all the protection of the nation; it owes nothing to the Enemies of the People but death&quot;. The Law of 22 Prairial in 1794 extended the remit of the Revolutionary Tribunal to punish &quot;enemies of the people&quot;, with some political crimes punishable by death, including &quot;spreading false news to divide or trouble the people&quot;.

==Marxist–Leninist states==
===Soviet Union===
The Soviet Union made extensive use of the term &quot;vrag naroda&quot; (), literally meaning &quot;enemy of the people&quot;. The term was first used in a speech by Felix Dzerzhinsky, the first chairman of the Cheka, after the October Revolution. The Petrograd Military Revolutionary Committee printed lists of &quot;enemies of the people&quot;, and Vladimir Lenin invoked it in his decree of 28 November 1917:
Other similar terms were in use as well:
*&quot;enemy of the labourers&quot; (враг трудящихся, &quot;vrag trudyashchikhsya&quot;)
*&quot;enemy of the proletariat&quot; (враг пролетариата, &quot;vrag proletariata&quot;)
*&quot;class enemy&quot; (классовый враг, &quot;klassovyi vrag&quot;), etc.

The term &quot;enemy of the people&quot; was used in the 1936 Constitution of the Soviet Union, in Article 131 about public property: &quot;Persons who encroach on public, socialist property are enemies of the people.&quot;

The term &quot;enemy of the workers&quot; was formalized in the Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code), and similar articles in the codes of the other Soviet Republics.

At various times these terms were applied, in particular, to Tsar Nicholas II and the Imperial family, aristocrats, the bourgeoisie, clerics, business entrepreneurs, anarchists, kulaks, monarchists, Mensheviks, Esers, Bundists, Trotskyists, Bukharinists, the &quot;old Bolsheviks&quot;, the army and police, emigrants, saboteurs, wreckers (вредители, &quot;vrediteli&quot;), &quot;social parasites&quot; (тунеядцы, &quot;tuneyadtsy&quot;), &quot;Kavezhedists&quot; (people who administered and serviced the Chinese Eastern Railway, abbreviated KVZhD, particularly the Russian population of Harbin, China), and those considered bourgeois nationalists (notably Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Armenian, Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian nationalists, as well as Zionists and the Basmachi movement).

After 1927, Article 20 of the Common Part of the penal code that listed possible &quot;measures of social defence&quot; had the following item 20a: &quot;declaration to be an enemy of the workers with deprivation of the union republic citizenship and hence of the USSR citizenship, with obligatory expulsion from its territory&quot;. Nevertheless, most &quot;enemies of the people&quot; suffered labor camps, rather than expulsion.

====Rejection of the phrase====
On 25 February 1956, Nikita Khrushchev delivered a speech to the Communist Party in which he identified Stalin as the author of the phrase and distanced himself from it, saying that it made debate impossible. &quot;This term automatically made it unnecessary that the ideological errors of a man or men engaged in a controversy be proven,&quot; Khrushchev said. &quot;It made possible the use of the cruelest repression, violating all norms of [...] legality, against anyone who in any way disagreed with Stalin, against those who were only suspected of hostile intent, against those who had bad reputations ... The formula ‘enemy of the people’ was specifically introduced for the purpose of physically annihilating such individuals.&quot;

For decades afterwards, the phrase &quot;was so omnipresent, freighted and devastating in its use under Stalin that nobody [in Russia] wanted to touch it. ... except in reference to history and in jokes&quot;, according to William Taubman in his biography of Khrushchev.

===Cambodia and China===
According to Philip Short, an author of biographies of Mao Zedong and Cambodia&#x27;s Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot, in domestic political struggles Chinese and Cambodian communists rarely if ever used the phrase &quot;enemy of the people&quot; as they were very nationalistic and saw it as an alien import.

In 1957, in the speech and in the essay &quot;On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People&quot;, Mao said that: &quot;At the present stage, the period of building socialism, the classes, strata and social groups which favour, support and work for the cause of socialist construction all come within the category of the people, while the social forces and groups which resist the socialist revolution and are hostile to or sabotage socialist construction are all enemies of the people.&quot;

===Albania===
Enemy of the people (Alb: Armiku i popullit) in Albania were the enemy typology of the Communist Albanian government used to denounce political or class opponents. The term is today considered totalitarian, derogatory and hostile. There are still some politicians who use the term on political opponents with the intention of dehumanization.

After the communist takeover, many who were labeled with this term were executed or imprisoned. Enver Hoxha declared religious leaders, landowners, disloyal party officials, clerics and clan leaders as &quot;enemies of the people&quot;. This is said to have led to the death of 6,000 people. Thousands were sentenced to death. From 1945 to 1992, around 5,000 men and women were executed and close to 100,000 were sent to prison as they were labeled enemies of the people. Many who were targeted held important leadership positions in the party and state structures of the regime. Hoxha also used the term against the Soviet Union and the US when he spoke: &quot;as to ’Albania being only one mouthful’, watch out, gentlemen, for socialist Albania is a hard bone that will stick in your throat and choke you!&quot;. On 1 June 1945, The Albanian Central Commission for the Discovery of Crimes, of War Criminals and Enemies of the People requested the International Commission for the Discovery of Crimes and War Criminals to hand over a number of Albanian war criminals found in concentration camps in Italy such as Bari, Lecce, Salerno and others. In 1954, Hoxha condemned the American and British liberation of Albania calling them &quot;enemies of the people&quot;. In the 1960s, many Albanian migrants returned from Austria and Italy after having fled in the 1940s, and despite having been promised not to be punished, were immediately arrested as &quot;enemies of the people&quot;. In 1990, Ismail Kadare applied for political asylum in France, which was granted, resulting in him being condemned by Albanian officials as an &quot;enemy of the people&quot;.

==Nazi Germany==
Regarding the Nazi plan to relocate all Jews to Madagascar, the Nazi tabloid &quot;Der Stürmer&quot; wrote that &quot;The Jews don&#x27;t want to go to Madagascar – They cannot bear the climate. Jews are pests and disseminators of diseases. In whatever country they settle and spread themselves out, they produce the same effects as are produced in the human body by germs. ... In former times sane people and sane leaders of the peoples made short shrift of &quot;enemies of the people&quot;. They had them either expelled or killed.&quot;

==Russia==

The term returned to post-Soviet Russia in the late 2000s with a number of nationalist and pro-government politicians (most notably Ramzan Kadyrov) calling for restoration of the Soviet approach to the &quot;enemies of the people&quot; defined as all non-system opposition.

On 28 December 2022, Dmitry Medvedev, Deputy Secretary of the Security Council of Russia, said that Russians who fled Russia after the invasion of Ukraine and are opposed to the war should be labeled &quot;enemies of society&quot; and barred from returning to Russia.

== United Kingdom ==

During the aftermath of the referendum on membership of the European Union, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; was criticized for a headline describing judges (in the &quot;Miller&quot; case) as &quot;Enemies of the People&quot; for ruling that the process for leaving the European Union (i.e. the triggering of Article 50) would require the consent of the British Parliament. The May administration had hoped to use the powers of the royal prerogative to bypass parliamentary approval. The paper issued character assassinations of all the judges involved in the ruling (Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, Sir Terence Etherton, and Lord Justice Sales), and received more than 1,000 complaints to the Independent Press Standards Organisation. The Secretary of State for Justice, Liz Truss, issued a three-line statement defending the independence and impartiality of the judiciary, which some saw as inadequate due to the delayed response and failure to condemn the attacks.

== United States ==

=== 1960s ===
In the United States during the 1960s, organizations such as the Black Panther Party and Students for a Democratic Society were known to use the term. In one inter-party dispute in February 1971, for example, Black Panther leader Huey P. Newton denounced two other Panthers as &quot;enemies of the people&quot; for allegedly putting party leaders and members in jeopardy.

=== Donald Trump ===

In 2020 the Committee to Protect Journalists published a special report by Leonard Downie Jr. titled &quot;The Trump Administration and the Media&quot;. In the very beginning the report stated:

Trump has habitually attacked the news media in rallies, responses to reporters’ questions, and many hundreds of tweets. He has repeatedly called the press “fake news,” “the enemy of the people,” “dishonest,” “corrupt,” “low life reporters,” “bad people,” “human scum” and “some of the worst human beings you’ll ever meet.” 

From his inauguration in January 2017 through October 15, 2019, Trump called the news media the &quot;enemy of the people&quot; 36 times on Twitter.

<doc id="523181" wikidata="Q7917104" url="?curid=523181" title="Vatera">
<text>Vatera is an 8-kilometer long sandy beach in the southern part of Lesbos island. The name (Βατερά) comes from &quot;βάτα&quot; (&quot;vata&quot;, meaning &quot;bramble&quot;), in reference to prickly bushes that blocked the old mule-drive access.

It is 55 km in total from Mytilini. The 7 km long, sandy beach here, backed by vegetated hills and looking out to Hios and Psara, offers some of the warmest, cleanest swimming on Lesvos. Several family hotels and taverns with traditional tastes are across the biggest beach on the island.

3 km away is Agios Fokas, where foundations and columns stubs remain of the temple of Dionysos and an early Christian basilica.

The Vatera area hit the Greek news in 1997 when a palaeontologist, Michael Dermitzakis, confirmed what farmers unearthing bones had long suspected when he announced that the area was a treasure trove of two-million-year-old fossils, belonging to the Late Pliocene. The fossils include bones of stenoid horses (&quot;Equus stenonis&quot;), mastodons, a baboon-like monkey (&quot;Paradolichopithecus&quot;) and a giant tortoise (&quot;Cheirogaster&quot;), the latter the size of a small car.

Around two million years ago, Lesvos was not an island but was joined to the Asian mainland, and the gulf of Vatera was a subtropical shallow sea. The environment of Vatera at that time, was partly forested, partly open woodlands, with meandering rivers through the area flowing to the sea. The animals in question died somewhere near the rivers and their carcasses were transported by the water downstream. They got stuck somewhere at a bend, and sediments covered the remains until they were removed by Dermitzakis&#x27; team. In the nearby village of Vrissa, the University of Athens has established a natural history collection dedicated to the palaeontological finds.

<text>Ramil Sahib oghlu Safarov (, , born August 25, 1977) is an officer of the Azerbaijani Army who was convicted of the 2004 murder of Armenian Army Lieutenant Gurgen Margaryan. During a NATO-sponsored training seminar in Budapest, Safarov broke into Margaryan&#x27;s dormitory room at night and axed Margaryan to death while he was asleep. In Azerbaijan, Safarov has become a highly celebrated figure for his killing of an Armenian.

In 2006, Safarov was convicted of premeditated murder and sentenced to life imprisonment in Hungary with a 30-year minimum. After his request under the Strasbourg Convention, he was extradited on August 31, 2012, to Azerbaijan, where he was greeted as a hero, pardoned by Azerbaijani president Ilham Aliyev despite contrary assurances made to Hungary, promoted to the rank of major and given an apartment and over eight years of back pay. According to Azerbaijani authorities, Safarov was pardoned in compliance with the Constitution. Following Safarov&#x27;s pardon, Armenia severed diplomatic relations with Hungary and immediate protests broke out in Yerevan. The extradition was widely condemned by international organizations and governments of many countries, including the United States, Russia and France.

In a 2017 investigation into the Azerbaijani laundromat money-laundering scheme, it was uncovered and revealed that several bank transfers in 2012, totalling more than USD $9 million, made to the Hungarian MKB Bank account in Budapest right around the time when the Hungarian government extradited Safarov to Azerbaijan.

==Early life==
Ramil Safarov was born on August 25, 1977, in the Şükürbəyli village of Jabrayil District, former Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic of the Soviet Union (now Azerbaijan), where he finished middle school. He is one of four brothers. Jabrayil was occupied by Armenian forces on August 26, 1993, and remained under the control of the self-proclaimed Armenian Republic of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh) as part of the unresolved Nagorno-Karabakh conflict until October 4, 2020. Safarov&#x27;s family fled to Baku in 1991. During a court hearing, Safarov claimed to recount memories from the years of war, during which he had lost family members. This, however, contradicted another version he told the court, where he stated that he was studying in Azerbaijan&#x27;s capital of Baku and in Turkey from 1992 to 1996. He continued his studies at Maltepe Military High School in İzmir, Turkey, and then at the Turkish Military Academy, graduating in 2000, after which he returned to Azerbaijan.

==Budapest murder==
In January 2004, the 26-year-old Ramil Safarov, along with another officer from Azerbaijan, went to Budapest, Hungary, to participate in the three-month English language courses, organized by NATO&#x27;s Partnership for Peace program for military personnel from different countries. Two Armenian officers, a 25-year-old Gurgen Margaryan and Hayk Makuchyan, also participated in this program.

On the evening of February 18, Safarov bought an axe and a honing stone at Tesco, near Ferenc Puskás Stadium. He took them in the bag to his dormitory room at the Zrínyi Miklós National Defence University, where all the course participants were staying. Safarov&#x27;s roommate had returned to his native Ukraine to attend the funerals of his relatives and so nobody interrupted Safarov as he sharpened the axe in his room. At around 5:00 am on February 19, Safarov took the axe and went to Margaryan&#x27;s room, which he was sharing with his Hungarian roommate, Balázs Kuti. The door of their room was not locked. Safarov attacked the sleeping Margaryan with the axe and delivered 16 blows to his body, which almost severed Margaryan’s head. The noises woke up Kuti, who was shocked seeing the Azerbaijani officer standing by Gurgen’s bed with a long axe in his hands. As Kuti later testified, &quot;By that time I understood that something terrible had happened for there was blood all around. I started to shout at the Azerbaijani urging him to stop it. He said that he had no problems with me and would not touch me, stabbed Gurgen a couple of more times and left. The expression of his face was as if he was glad he had finished something important. Greatly shocked, I ran out of the room to find help, and Ramil went in another direction&quot;.

Afterwards, Safarov headed for the room of Makuchyan, the other Armenian student, with the intention of attacking him also, but found his door locked. He shouted out Makuchyan’s name in a threatening voice. The half-sleeping Makuchyan wanted to open the door, but his Lithuanian roommate stopped him and called his compatriot next door to check what was going on. Meanwhile, Safarov went to look for Makuchyan in the room of the Serbian and the Ukrainian roommates, showing them the blood-stained axe and stating that he thirsted for nobody&#x27;s blood but Armenian. Later the eyewitnesses confessed that they were afraid to approach Ramil with a blood-stained axe closer than three meters.

Soon after, the Hungarian police, which was summoned by Balázs Kuti, arrived and arrested Safarov at the scene. A Hungarian court later found that it was an attempt on Makuchyan’s life and recognized the latter also as a victim. While announcing the verdict the judge particularly emphasized that if Safarov had not been restrained by his fellow officers he would have killed the second Armenian officer as well.

===Interrogation and trial===
During his initial interrogation Safarov confessed to killing Margaryan and his intention to kill Makuchyan. Questioned about his motives during the interrogation, Safarov stated:

According to Balázs Kuti, at the very beginning of the language courses, when the students got acquainted, there was a conversation about different international issues, but nobody spoke of it afterwards. Kuti also said that he had not noticed any strain in the relationship between Margaryan and the Azerbaijani officers. Makuchyan&#x27;s neighbor, officer Saulius Paulius, also said that he observed nothing strange in the relationship between the Armenian and the Azerbaijani guys. The police afterwards interrogated all the students and all testified that there was no conflict between the Armenian and the Azerbaijani officers and that they did not even interact with each other.

Later in an interview to the Armenian newspaper &quot;Iravunk&quot;, Makuchyan confirmed that neither Gurgen nor him had had any contacts with any of the Azerbaijani officers. &quot;They were not of a communicative type. Usually, after classes, they went straight to their rooms&quot;, said Makuchyan. To the question as to why he chose to attack Margaryan first, Safarov answered it was because he was big, muscular and of sportive type.

When the case went to trial Safarov&#x27;s defense claimed that the murder was committed because Margaryan had insulted the Azerbaijani flag. The claim that Safarov had been somehow insulted underwent several variations among press and politicians in Azerbaijan, without any evidence. Safarov did not mention any insult in either his court trial, and made it very clear he killed Margaryan just because he was an Armenian. No witnesses were ever called during the trial to corroborate these allegations of harassment in court and prosecution lawyers strongly disputed that they had taken place. Despite the lack of evidence the Azerbaijani media, including state-owned media outlets, have circulated the version of the flag for making Safarov a national hero.

The defense also alleged that Safarov was mentally sick when committing the murder; however, the forensic medical examination, which was upheld by the judge, showed that &quot;Safarov was sane and aware of the consequences of his act&quot;.

On April 13, 2006, a Hungarian court sentenced Safarov to life imprisonment without right of appeal for 30 years. The judge, András Vaskuti, cited the premeditated nature and brutality of the crime and the fact that Safarov showed no remorse for his deeds as the reasons for the sentence. Handing down a life sentence, the judge particularly emphasised that “the murder of a sleeping man in peace time is always a crime and cannot be an act of heroism”. On February 22, 2007, a Hungarian appeals court upheld the ruling following an appeal filed by Safarov&#x27;s lawyer.
While serving his sentence, Safarov translated several novels by Hungarian authors into Azeri, including Magda Szabó&#x27;s &quot;The Door&quot; () and &quot;The Paul Street Boys&quot; () (youth novel by the Hungarian writer Ferenc Molnár).

===Reaction to the murder and the sentence===
A lawyer representing the victim&#x27;s family welcomed the sentence as a &quot;good decision for the Hungarian court and for Armenian society.&quot;

Many officials in Azerbaijan publicly praised Safarov&#x27;s actions, while there were also those who condemned them. Elmira Süleymanova, the human rights commissioner (ombudsman) of Azerbaijan, declared that Safarov&#x27;s punishment was far too harsh and that &quot;Safarov must become an example of patriotism for the Azerbaijani youth&quot;. The banned radical Azerbaijan National Democrat Party awarded Safarov with the title of &quot;Man of the Year 2005&quot; for killing an Armenian.

Fuad Agayev, a prominent Azeri lawyer, said that Azeris &quot;...have to urgently stop this current campaign to raise Safarov to the rank of national hero. He is no hero.”

The United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs condemned Azerbaijan&#x27;s reaction to the brutal murder of the Armenian officer in a hearing. A report which was published by the Committee on Foreign Affairs contained a statement by Bryan Ardouny, Executive Director of the Armenian Assembly of America, who stated that &quot;The Azerbaijani government has also consistently failed to condemn Safarov, an Azeri military officer who in 2003 [sic] brutally murdered an Armenian participant at a NATO Partnership for Peace military training exercise in Budapest, Hungary. Instead, it has encouraged domestic media and various organizations to treat the murderer as a celebrity. That individual has since been awarded the title of &#x27;Man of the Year&#x27; by Azerbaijan’s National-Democratic Party.&quot;

==Extradition and pardon==
===Safarov&#x27;s welcome in Azerbaijan===
After serving eight years of the life sentence, Safarov was extradited under the framework guidelines of the 1983 Strasbourg Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons and transferred to Azerbaijan on August 31, 2012. Although the Hungarian government stated that it had received assurances from the Azerbaijan government that the remainder of the sentence would be enforced, President Ilham Aliyev issued a pardon immediately upon Safarov&#x27;s arrival in Baku and ordered that he be &quot;freed from the term of his punishment.&quot;

Azerbaijani Defense Minister Safar Abiyev promoted Safarov to the rank of major and the Defense Ministry of Azerbaijan provided him with an apartment and over eight years of back pay. On September 1, Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry spokesman Elman Abdullayev said that the return of Safarov to Azerbaijan is a matter of relations between Azerbaijan and Hungary, which was resolved in the &quot;framework of the law and is not contrary to norms and principles of the international law.&quot; He described Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan&#x27;s statements as &quot;hysterical&quot; and accused him of being one of the leaders of the group that committed the Khojaly Massacre.

After arriving in Baku, Safarov stated: &quot;This is restoration of justice. It was a bit of surprise for me.&quot; He then visited Martyrs&#x27; Lane to lay flowers at the tomb of Azerbaijan&#x27;s former president Heydar Aliyev. He also laid flowers at the Eternal Flame monument and visited a monument to Turkish soldiers.

Novruz Mammadov, the head of the presidential foreign relations department, said that secret talks had been going on for a year between Azerbaijan and Hungary, and that agreement had been reached on the visit of Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán.

A week before Safarov&#x27;s release there came reports that the two countries were in talks over a loan from Azerbaijan to Hungary of 2-3bn euros ($2.5–3.8bn; £1.6–2.4bn) which gave way to speculations in Hungary that Orbán extradited Safarov in return for a promise that Azerbaijan would buy Hungarian bonds. In a 2017 investigation, an Azerbaijani laundromat money-laundering scheme was uncovered and revealed, among many other briberies, that several bank transfers in 2012, totalling more than USD $9 million, made to the Hungarian MKB Bank account in Budapest right around the time when the Hungarian government extradited Safarov to Azerbaijan. Several media outlets suggested a connection between Viktor Orbán&#x27;s visit to Baku in June and the first instalment of $7.6 million transferred to the bank account in July, since by the end of August Safarov was handed over to Azerbaijan.

Azerbaijani high-ranking officials have praised Safarov&#x27;s extradition and pardon giving him a hero&#x27;s welcome. Presidential Administration of Azerbaijan Novruz Mammadov stated in the interview:
Yes, he is in Azerbaijan. This is a great news for all of us. It is very touching to see this son of the homeland, which was thrown in jail after he defended his country&#x27;s honor and dignity of the people.

Elnur Aslanov, Chief of the Political Analysis and Information Department of the Presidential Administration of Azerbaijan said that &quot;...heroes as Mubariz Ibrahimov and Ramil Safarov with their bravery brought the second breath to the Azerbaijani society and people”.

Ali Ahmedov, Deputy Chairman and Executive Secretary of the ruling New Azerbaijan Party stated that the &quot;Order of President Ilham Aliyev to pardon Ramil Safarov is a triumph of determination, courage and justice&quot;.

Prominent public figures in Azerbaijan have made similar statements endorsing Safarov&#x27;s image as a hero. Famous Azerbaijani singer and a deputy of Azerbaijani Parliament Zeynab Khanlarova made the following statement:
Safarov is not just a hero of Azerbaijan, he is an international hero! A monument should be set up to him. Not every man could do this. There are two heroes − Mr. Ilham Aliyev and Ramil Safarov. I would have done exactly as Ramil did. He did the right thing to take the life of an Armenian.

Commenting on the hero&#x27;s welcome received by Safarov in Azerbaijan, Geydar Dzhemal, political scientist, the Chairman of the Islamic Committee of Russia, said,
“I am absolutely convinced that the welcoming of Ramil Safarov as a hero in Azerbaijan is quite natural”.

On September 19, 2013, during the opening ceremony of the Guba Memorial Complex, President Aliyev stated that they &quot;restored the justice&quot; by returning Safarov to Azerbaijan.
Аzeri leaders have more than once called Armenians number one enemy, while Safarov’s attorney stated at Budapest trial that &quot;killing an Armenian is not a crime in Azerbaijan.&quot;

===International reaction===
====Armenia====

President Serzh Sargsyan announced Armenia&#x27;s suspension of diplomatic relations and all official communications with Hungary on the day of Safarov&#x27;s release. &quot;This is not a simple murder. It is murder on ethnic grounds,&quot; he said.

Sargsyan suggested the possibility that Azerbaijani president Ilham Aliyev and Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán had entered into a secret agreement during the latter&#x27;s visit to Baku on June 30, 2012. A number of sources in the media have also speculated that Hungary&#x27;s deepening economic ties with Azerbaijan may have had something to do with Safarov&#x27;s release. Sargsyan concluded his statements by saying, &quot;with their joint actions the authorities of Hungary and Azerbaijan have opened the door for the recurrence of such crimes.&quot;

Demonstrations took place in front of the Hungarian consulate in Yerevan, during which the building was pelted with tomatoes. Demonstrators also burned a Hungarian flag. A photo of Safarov was also burned by the activists. National Assembly Speaker Hovik Abrahamyan cancelled his visit to Hungary planned for late September.

Hayk Makuchyan, whom Safarov unsuccessfully planned to kill on the same night as Margaryan, stated that he will petition to all judicial instances and possibly The Hague, since the murder was committed on ethnic grounds, adding: &quot;I had no doubt that Ramil Safarov would not have served his sentence in the case of an extradition. But the Azerbaijani leadership’s cynicism surpassed everything.&quot;

====Hungary====
On September 2 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Hungary announced the country &quot;refuses to accept and condemns the action of Azerbaijan, which contradicts the relevant rules of international law and sharply contrasts the undertaking of the Azerbaijani side in this matter, confirmed by the Deputy Minister of Justice of the Republic of Azerbaijan in his letter &lt;...&gt; of 15 August 2012.&quot; The Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the action of Azerbaijan in a diplomatic note. The press release also states that &quot;Hungary regards the decision of Azerbaijan inconsistent with the spirit of cooperation based on mutual trust that has been achieved during the past years between our respective countries.&quot;

The opposition parties strongly criticized Viktor Orbán and his cabinet for the move.
Despite government denials, opposition parties said Orbán let Safarov return to Azerbaijan in the hope of economic favors in return from the energy producer Azerbaijan.

Representatives of MSZP, the then largest opposition party, called for various subcommittees of the parliament to examine who exactly made the decision and why the procedure was kept secret. MSZP had been in power until 2010, and had refused to release Safarov. The Socialists have also called on Orbán to resign over the decision.

====Other countries ====
*: Both the United States National Security Council and the State Department expressed &quot;deep concern&quot; over the matter. The press statement from Washington said: &quot;We are expressing our deep concern to Azerbaijan regarding this action and seeking an explanation. We are also seeking further details from Hungary regarding the decision to transfer Mr. Safarov to Azerbaijan.&quot; National Security Council Spokesman Tommy Vietor also stated: &quot;President Obama is deeply concerned by today’s announcement that the President of Azerbaijan has pardoned Ramil Safarov following his return from Hungary... We are communicating to Azerbaijani authorities our disappointment about the decision to pardon Safarov. This action is contrary to ongoing efforts to reduce regional tensions and promote reconciliation.&quot; &quot;We were appalled by the glorification that we heard in some quarters of somebody who was convicted of murder,&quot; said Philip H. Gordon, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs. He called the case &quot;a real provocation in the region.&quot; The Azerbaijani foreign ministry responded, &quot;it is perplexing that the U.S. government interferes in the relations of two independent states – Azerbaijan and Hungary&quot; and suggested that the U.S. response was connected to the elections in the U.S.
*: On September 3, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following statement: &quot;In Russia, which is the co-chairman of the OSCE Minsk Group on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict settlement, received reports with deep concern regarding the clemency of Baku Azeri serviceman Ramil Safarov, who was sentenced to life imprisonment for the commission of the murder of an Armenian officer with an extreme atrocity in Hungary in the 2004, as well as regarding the preceded decision of the Hungarian authorities to extradite him to Azerbaijan. We believe that these actions of Azerbaijan, as well as the Hungarian authorities to run counter to the efforts agreed at international level, particularly through the OSCE Minsk Group, directed to reduce tension in the region.&quot;
*: Foreign Ministry said that &quot;France expresses her concern following the announcement of the pardon granted to M. Safarov by the Azerbaijani authorities&quot;. As one of the OSCE Minsk Group countries, France is &quot;strongly committed to a peaceful solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, [and] believes that this decision risks seriously damaging the negotiation efforts and the establishment of a climate of trust between the parties.&quot;
*: Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt tweeted &quot;Strange decision in Azerbaijan to pardon man having murdered an Armenian in Hungary. Rule of law must apply.&quot;
*: Foreign Affairs Minister Erato Kozakou-Marcoullis&#x27;s statement said &quot;we deeply regret and deplore this Presidential pardon and the damage inflicted by the actions that followed the release, aimed at glorifying this hideous crime, to the reconciliation efforts with Azerbaijan and we are also very concerned of its effects on regional stability.&quot;

====European Court of Human Rights====
A court case, Makuchyan and Minasyan v. Azerbaijan and Hungary, was brought in front of the European Court of Human Rights and decided upon in 2020, the final judgement placing blame on Azerbaijan for its decisions in the treatment of Safarov (mala fide acts), but largely acquitting Hungary for its part in transferring the convicted murderer to his home country (due diligence).

====Organizations====
* UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has expressed his concern over Safarov&#x27;s extradition and subsequent pardon. The U.N.&#x27;s top human rights official also strongly criticized Safarov&#x27;s pardon. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay&#x27;s spokesman, Rupert Colville, told reporters Friday in Geneva that &quot;ethnically motivated hate crimes of this gravity should be deplored and properly punished – not publicly glorified by leaders and politicians... We are also in full agreement with the Co-Chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group who earlier this week expressed deep concern about “the damage the pardon and any attempts to glorify the crime have done to the [Nagorno-Karabakh] peace process and trust between the two sides.&quot;&quot;
*: EU Foreign Affairs Representative Catherine Ashton and European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy Štefan Füle announced that they are &quot;concerned by the news that the President of Azerbaijan has pardoned Azerbaijani army officer Ramil Safarov&quot;. They called on Azerbaijan and Armenia &quot;to exercise restraint, on the ground as well as in public statements, in order to prevent an escalation of the situation in the interest of regional stability and on-going efforts towards reconciliation&quot;. The EU foreign relations spokeswoman, Maja Kocjanic, told press in Brussels: &quot;We are particularly concerned with the impact the developments might have on the wider region.&quot;
::* European Parliament passed a resolution on the Ramil Safarov case, stating that it “deplores the decision by the President of Azerbaijan to pardon Ramil Safarov”, &quot;the hero’s welcome accorded to Mr Safarov in Azerbaijan and the decision to promote him to the rank of major…” as well as expresses a “concern about the example this sets for future generations and about the promotion and recognition he has received from the Azerbaijani state”. As for the legitimacy of Aliyev’s pardon the European Parliament &quot;Considers that, while the presidential pardon granted to Mr Safarov complies with the letter of the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, it runs contrary to the spirit of that international agreement, which was negotiated to allow the transfer of a person convicted on the territory of one state to serve the remainder of his or her sentence on the territory of another state”.

* Collective Security Treaty Organisation: Secretary-General Nikolay Bordyuzha stated that Azerbaijan&#x27;s decision to pardon Safarov is against international law. He then continued, &quot;this move was obviously done for the sake of short-term political goals and can not be justified by anything&quot;.
* OSCE Minsk Group: The OSCE Minsk Group (composed of negotiators from the US, Russia and France to encourage a peaceful, negotiated resolution to the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh) stated that Azerbaijan&#x27;s pardoning of a military officer who murdered an Armenian officer has harmed attempts to establish peace between the countries.
*: NATO likewise condemned Safarov&#x27;s pardon. NATO Secretary General Fogh Rasmussen expressed his &quot;deep concern&quot; and stated that &quot;The act [Safarov] committed in 2004 was a terrible crime that should not be glorified. The pardon damages trust and does not contribute to the peace process.&quot;
*Council of Europe: &quot;Honouring a convicted murderer and transforming him into a hero is unacceptable&quot;, Secretary General Thorbjørn Jagland has declared. Human rights commissioner Nils Muižnieks and Jean-Claude Mignon, President of the Parliamentary Assembly, also expressed their outrage at the pardon.

====Non-governmental organizations====
Amnesty International human rights organization issued a public statement on the occasion of Safarov&#x27;s release, which stated, &quot;By pardoning and then promoting Ramil Safarov, President Aliyev has signalled to Azerbaijanis that violence against Armenians is not only acceptable, but rewarded. The Azerbaijani government should rescind any privileges awarded to Safarov and publicly condemn ethnic violence.&quot;

British expert on Caucasus Thomas de Waal called President Aliyev&#x27;s move to pardon Safarov &quot;deeply provocative.&quot; In De Waal&#x27;s view, &quot;This is now a full-blown state-to-state row, with as yet unknowable consequences.&quot;

;Azerbaijan
Mixed thoughts came from Azerbaijani organizations and figures in Azerbaijani society. Zardusht Alizadeh, chair of the Open Society Institute in Azerbaijan, condemned the act of pardon, saying it would not contribute positively to the peaceful solution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. According to Alizadeh, the act was not based on any political will, respect of law or interest in conflict resolution, but instead had only &quot;cheap fame&quot; to it. The noted journalist Khadija Ismayilova, Radio Liberty&#x27;s lead correspondent in Azerbaijan, commented that what Safarov had done was &quot;awful&quot; and the reaction of seeing him as a hero &quot;happens when society is not allowed to do anything. They are angry. People of Azerbaijan lost the war, lost the territory to occupants, became refugees, lost their siblings including civilians and they were stopped and banned from restoring justice on the battle field.&quot; on her Facebook account.

Former deputy of the Azerbaijan National Assembly and writer Akram Aylisli refused to comment on the &quot;campaign,&quot; but did note that he had his &quot;own ideas of and approach to heroism.&quot; Azerbaijani media have criticized the United States&#x27; concern for Safarov&#x27;s pardon and added that it should have reacted the same way when Varoujan Garabedian, a member of ASALA who was imprisoned in France, was expelled to Armenia after his pardon by France in 2001. Meanwhile, the organization Azerbaijani Americans for Democracy sent an open letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, urging the United States to devote more of its attention to the human rights abuses of President Aliyev, instead of Safarov&#x27;s pardon.

The leading Azerbaijani Russian-language news website &quot;Day.az&quot; called on its readers to edit the Russian Wikipedia article on Safarov to prevent it from the possible &quot;revenge of Armenian nationalists.&quot;

;Hungary
Péter Erdő, the Archbishop of Esztergom-Budapest and the Hungarian Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church, in a letter to Catholicos of All Armenians Karekin II, issued a statement expressing &quot;full solidarity with the Armenian Christians and with the Armenian people that has so much suffered in the past.&quot;

In October 2012 four Hungarian intellectuals—historian and political analyst Zoltán Bíró, rector of the John Wesley Theological College Gábor Iványi, journalist/publicist Gábor Deák and writer Rudolf Ungváry—arrived in Armenia to apologize for the extradition of Ramil Safarov. During the press conference in Yerevan they stated: “We organized the journey to inform of most of Hungarian people’s disagreement, and our discontent with the authorities’ decision to transfer a sleeping officer’s assassin back to his homeland.&quot; Mr. Iványi said, “We have come to express our regret and shame. Hungary didn’t even officially recognize the Armenian genocide as the country was in need of Turkish support then. As for the prime minister having allowed for the extradition, he would have resigned his post”.

Hungarian scientist and expert in Armenian studies Benedek Zsigmond joined in the protest organized by many NGOs in Hungary against the decision of Safarov&#x27;s extradition and made a public statement of apology for the Hungarian government&#x27;s action. On his Facebook page he wrote &quot;Today I feel ashamed that I am Hungarian. I apologize to all Armenians... Today is the black day in the recent history of Hungary.&quot; He also personally apologized during his visit to Armenia calling the extradition an &quot;unacceptable, amoral act&quot;.

On September 4, 2012, a demonstration took place in front of the Hungarian Parliament Building in Kossuth Square. It was reported that about two thousand Hungarians protested against their government&#x27;s actions.

In September, the Kispest district of Budapest had a new square named after Kemal Atatürk and a statue of him was revealed among protests from local Armenians and Greeks who considered it a provocation. In the months preceding the ceremony the local government was pondering the matter, being caught between the resentment of minority groups and the will to preserve good relations with its sister city Pendik, whose representatives have already been invited to the ceremony. Only two days after its unveiling, the statue was vandalized by red paint being poured over it. The statue has been restored since.

;Armenian diaspora
In many cities around the world where Armenian diaspora is present, demonstrations took place against Hungarian and Azerbaijani government actions, including New York City, Ottawa, Tbilisi, Rostov-on-Don, and Nicosia.

A year after Safarov had been extradited, the Armenian community in Hungary claimed that they did not feel safe and that their relationship with the Hungarian government was getting worse every day, as the authorities were making their lives there &quot;more difficult&quot;.

<doc id="523186" wikidata="Q410689" url="?curid=523186" title="U.S. Route 83">
<text>U.S. Route 83 (US 83) is a major north–south United States Numbered Highway that extends in the central United States. Only four other north–south routes are longer: US 1, US 41, US 59, and US 87, while US 83 follows a straighter north-south path than all of these. Nearly half of its mileage is in the state of Texas. The highway&#x27;s northern terminus is north of Westhope, North Dakota, at the Canadian border, where it continues as Manitoba Highway 83 (PTH 83). The southern terminus is at the Veterans International Bridge in Brownsville, Texas. Together, US 83 and PTH 83 form a continuously numbered north-south highway with a combined distance of 3,450 kilometres (2,140 mi).

==Route description==
===Texas===
US 83 is a largely north–south highway, in length, in Texas except for a segment parallel to the Rio Grande, where it takes an east–west course, much of which runs concurrently with Interstate 2 (I-2). It enters the United States and Texas near Brownsville concurrent with US 77 and then splits from US 77 at Harlingen. Passing Weslaco with I-2, it begins to veer northward and passes the current western terminus of I-2 at Peñitas(A new short roadway designated as Spur 83 forms a branch from Business US 83 to I-2), follows the Rio Grande to Laredo where it meets I-35 in a concurrency before heading northwestward. It meets I-10 at Junction, where it has a concurrency with I-10, before heading almost due-north to Abilene, meeting I-20 on an expressway before heading north again on mostly undivided surface roads. It again heads slightly west of due north to meet US 287 in Childress and I-40 in Shamrock. About north of Perryton it leaves Texas and enters Oklahoma. Except for Abilene, Laredo, and some cities in the lower Rio Grande Valley it is largely rural in nature.

===Oklahoma===

US 83 traverses the Oklahoma panhandle along the western border of Beaver County, but in this brief stretch it encounters no fewer than three other federal highways. Approximately from the Texas line, US 83 intersects US 412 in the hamlet of Bryan&#x27;s Corner. Continuing its journey northward, the highway crosses the Beaver River, then intersects US 64 in Turpin. US 83 north and US 64 east are co-signed for three northbound miles, where US 64 turns eastward. At this intersection, US 270 west joins the highway, and together with US 83 proceeds northbound for the final to the Kansas line.

===Kansas===

US 83 enters the Sunflower State in Seward County, approximately south of Liberal, where it intersects US 54 and US 270 ends. North of Liberal, US 83 begins a concurrency with US 160, and the highways remain joined until reaching Sublette, the seat of Haskell County. US 83 and US 160 split north of Sublette; US 160 heads west toward Ulysses, and US 83 continues north toward Garden City.

At Garden City, US 50 and US 400 join US 83 for a brief concurrency on a bypass around the east and north sides of the city while US 83 Business follows the former routing through downtown. All three routes cross K-156, also known as Kansas Avenue, in the northwest portion of the city. At the north end of the US 50/US 83 Business route, US 83 splits and heads north toward Scott City, while US 50 and US 400 remain joined through the rest of the state. The highway passes through largely unpopulated areas of Finney County and Scott County before reaching a junction with K-96 in downtown Scott City.

In northern Scott County, K-4 has its origins at US 83, heading east toward Healy, and US 83 traverses through rolling farmlands until reaching Oakley, the seat of Logan County. US 83 reaches US 40 less than a mile west of I-70, and the two highways jog west for a brief multiplex before US 83 splits and crosses I-70.

North of I-70, US 83 intersects US 24 then curves northeast, east of Gem in Thomas County. US 83 continues its northeasterly track through Rexford and Selden. After passing through Selden, US 83 intersects the southern terminus of K-383 and the northern terminus of K-23. From here, US 83 turns north, crosses into Decatur County then continues north and intersects US 36 in Oberlin. Oberlin is the last area of significant population the highway passes in Kansas; the next city is McCook, Nebraska.

===Nebraska===

US 83 enters Nebraska south of McCook, where it meets US 6 and US 34. It continues northward to North Platte, where it intersects I-80 and US 30. After leaving North Platte in a northeasterly direction, it turns north near Thedford and goes north through the Sand Hills to Valentine. For before Valentine, it runs concurrently with US 20. After passing through Valentine, it continues north to enter South Dakota.

===South Dakota===

US 83 enters South Dakota south of Olsonville on a segment of highway which passes through the Rosebud Indian Reservation. After a brief overlap with US 18 in Mission, the route turns north and meets I-90 at Murdo. The two routes overlap as US 83 goes east with I-90 until Vivian, where US 83 turns north. At Fort Pierre, US 83 meets US 14 and South Dakota Highway 34. The three highways overlap as they cross the Missouri River and enter Pierre. At Pierre, SD 34 separates and US 83 turns northeast with US 14. They separate near Blunt and US 83 turns northward. US 83 briefly overlaps with US 212 near Gettysburg and with US 12 through the Selby area. US 83 leaves South Dakota north of Herreid.

The South Dakota section of US 83, with the exception of concurrencies with US 18, I-90, US 14, US 212, and US 12, is defined at South Dakota Codified Laws § 31-4-180.

===North Dakota===

From South Dakota, US 83 enters North Dakota near the town of Hague, and runs northward for approximately , serving the small cities of Strasburg and Linton before reaching Interstate 94. It follows I-94 west to Bismarck, where it resumes a generally northward course as a four-lane highway.

Headed toward Minot US 83 traverses mostly agricultural land, passing through the small cities of Wilton, Washburn, and Underwood north to Max. Leaving Underwood, US 83 encounters a large strip-mining coal (lignite) operation which can be seen from the roadway in the vicinity of Falkirk. North of Coleharbor, US 83 briefly merges both roadways and shares land with an adjacent railroad line in order to cross a viaduct that separates Lake Sakakawea from Lake Audubon. North of the lakes, the surroundings return to cropland and grazing land, with a wind farm located south of Minot.

The highway passes directly through central Minot as Broadway, the city&#x27;s primary north-south thoroughfare, with the Minot Bypass to the west as an alternate route. After passing Minot Air Force Base, US 83 returns to a two-lane highway; approximately north of the base, it is co-signed with eastbound State Highway 5 for about . The highway then diverges from ND 5 to head north through Westhope to the Canadian border.

<text>Epididymal hypertension (EH), informally referred to as blue balls for males or blue vulva for females, is a harmless but uncomfortable sensation in the genital regions during a prolonged state of sexual arousal. It usually resolves within hours unless relieved through an orgasm.

In females, the discomfort occurs in the erectile tissue and clitoris of the vulva. In males, the phenomenon results in an uncomfortable testicular sensation. It most often describes a temporary fluid congestion in the testicles or vulva, caused by prolonged sexual arousal without orgasm.

The term &quot;epididymal hypertension&quot; is derived from the epididymis, a part of the male reproductive system. The term is also applied to females despite the lack of an epididymis in female anatomy. Professor Caroline Pukall, who co-wrote the first in-depth study on EH, has suggested using the term &quot;throbbing crotch syndrome&quot;. The term &quot;blue balls&quot; is thought to have originated in the United States, first appearing in 1916. Though lesser known, the equivalent of this phenomenon in females is informally referred to as &quot;blue vulva&quot;, among other names. It is not to be confused with the inability to orgasm or the masturbatory practice of edging.

==Research==
The phenomenon is sometimes associated with males who are experiencing and practicing delayed, multiple, or inhibited ejaculation. There is scant information on the phenomenon in scientific literature. Little formal data exists regarding the condition. The treatment is to achieve orgasm, or alternatively strain to move a very heavy object—in essence doing a Valsalva maneuver.

== Causes ==
The cause of epididymal hypertension is a large amount of blood circulation to the genital area, specifically the penis and testicles, without the release of tension associated with orgasm and ejaculation. When a large amount of blood flows to the genital region, the penis becomes erect and the testicles also experience increased blood flow and swelling. In the vulva, the blood flow increases in erectile tissue, causing it to expand. After orgasm, the tissue shrinks back to its initial size as most of the blood leaves. When this does not occur, it can cause mild discomfort.

== Symptoms ==
The following indications and symptoms may be experienced by both sexes:

* heaviness
* aching
* discomfort or mild pain

==See also==
* Delayed ejaculation
* Edging (sexual practice)
* Erotic sexual denial
* Prostatic congestion
* Sexual frustration
* Pampiniform plexus
* Varicocele
