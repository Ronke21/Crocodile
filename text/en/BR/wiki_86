<text>Vandal Savage (Vandar Adg) is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. He is said to be a Cro-Magnon warrior who gained immortality and advanced healing abilities after encountering a strange meteorite during prehistoric times. For over 50,000 years, he plagues the Earth as a villain and occasional conqueror, sometimes using different names but most often calling himself Vandal Savage. He is a brilliant and sadistic tactician with immense knowledge in various sciences and forms of combat. Throughout history, his most frequent enemies are immortal or reincarnating heroes such as Immortal Man, Hawkman, Hawkgirl, and Resurrection Man. He is also a recurring foe of the Justice Society and the Justice League and occasionally works as a member of super-villain organizations such as the Injustice Society and the Legion of Doom.

Vandal Savage has been substantially adapted into media outside comics. He is voiced by Phil Morris in &quot;Justice League&quot; and Miguel Ferrer in &quot;Young Justice&quot;, with David Kaye replacing Ferrer following his death. Furthermore, Savage appears in media set in the Arrowverse, portrayed by Casper Crump.

==Publication history==
Vandal Savage first appeared during the Golden Age of Comic Books in &quot;Green Lantern&quot; #10 (December 1943), created by writer Alfred Bester and artist Martin Nodell. In the story, he has pointed, demonic ears and reveals he is a million-year-old Cro-Magnon man who gained immortality from a special meteor. The story ends when the Green Lantern (Alan Scott) causes Savage to fall into a seemingly bottomless pit. Four years later, he made his second appearance in &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #37 (1947), where he joined the original Injustice Society, a team of villains that battled the Justice Society of America. The story featured Savage targeting Hawkman, who decades later would be established as one of Savage&#x27;s most frequent enemies.

During the Silver Age of Comic Books, DC rebooted its universe of superheroes, altering some character histories while also creating new versions of familiar characters. The Silver Age version of the Flash (Barry Allen) and his contemporaries were later said to live in the universe of Earth-One. The Golden Age Flash, Golden Age Green Lantern, and the Justice Society of America were retroactively said to be inhabitants of Earth-Two, where their stories took place. This made Vandal Savage an inhabitant of Earth-Two as well.

Sixteen years after his second comic book story, Vandal Savage returned in &quot;The Flash&quot; #137 (June 1963). This comic established he was closer to 50 thousand years old than 1 million years old, and also revealed that his original name had been Vandar Adg. After this, he became a recurring enemy to the heroes of Earth-Two and Earth-One, sometimes crossing the dimensional barrier between the two realities. Frequently, he battled the Flashes and Superman. In &quot;Action Comics&quot; #515-516 (1981), the story indicated Vandal Savage was no longer just ageless but could also heal from any physical injury, even near disintegration. The story shows Savage seemingly reduced to ash by a meteorite, but Superman concludes the villain will still return. In &quot;Action Comics&quot; #542 (1983), this is proven correct, and Savage reveals his body was able to heal and reform even from near total destruction.

Two years after Vandal Savage&#x27;s return to comics in the Silver Age, &quot;Strange Adventures&quot; #177 (1965) introduced a hero called the Immortal Man. Whenever the Immortal Man died or was killed, his powerful amulet allowed him to quickly materialize in a new body elsewhere on Earth, without having to literally be born again and with his memories intact. The Immortal Man initially appeared in four stories, then disappeared from comics for seventeen years. He returned in a two-part story in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #552–553 (1984), written by Marv Wolfman with art by Gil Kane. In this story, it was said the Immortal Man and Vandal Savage were archenemies across history and had been since before they had gained their powers. The Immortal Man&#x27;s amulet was also revealed to be a piece of the same meteorite that made Savage immortal. The same story featured the Immortal Man forming a team of Forgotten Heroes to fight Savage.

During the crossover &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, the Immortal Man seemingly died, giving up his reincarnation energy to help save reality. As a result of this crossover, the histories of Earth-One and Earth-Two were merged and revised into a new, unified DC Universe, altering some character histories in the process. The crossover was followed by &quot;History of the DC Universe&quot;, a two-part mini-series intended to establish the basic history of the new timeline (although within a few years, several parts of it were already dismissed and contradicted by new stories). &quot;History of the DC Universe&quot; #1 established for the first time that Vandar Adg&#x27;s people were known as the Blood Tribe (while the Immortal Man came from the Bear Tribe). The same issue showed that the meteor which made Vandal Savage immortal also enhanced his intelligence and altered his body, explaining why he resembled a modern &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; when other stories claimed he was originally Cro-Magnon.

Over time, new revelations were made about Vandal Savage, such as the fact that he kept track of his children and descendants in case he needed to harvest them for organs and replacement parts, since his ability to heal has weakened over time. The comic book series &quot;Resurrection Man&quot; said Savage and the Immortal Man were not made immortal by radiation or gases from the meteorite they encountered but by sub-atomic robots it carried called &quot;tektites&quot; that entered their bloodstreams. The same comic book series revealed that along with the Immortal Man, Savage has also regularly fought Mitchell Shelley, the Resurrection Man, across history. Likewise, it was revealed that Vandal Savage had regularly fought the reincarnating heroes Hawkman and Hawkgirl across many of their lives, sometimes being responsible for their deaths. The crossover &quot;Final Crisis&quot; depicts characters believing Vandal Savage is the inspiration for the story of Cain from the Bible.

In 2011, DC rebooted its history again with the &quot;New 52&quot; timeline. In the &quot;New 52&quot; series &quot;Demon Knights&quot;, it was said that Vandal Savage worked alongside several heroes and warriors during the Dark Ages, fighting evil rather than causing it. During these days, Savage is a mirthful, often drunk warrior who enjoys a fight as a break from boredom. In 2016, &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; restored much of the pre-&quot;New 52&quot; history while making some new changes. The 2017 comic book &quot;Dark Days: The Forge&quot; and the 2018 series &quot;The Immortal Men&quot; establishes that Vandal Savage and the Immortal Man were part of the Council of Immortals, a group whose members gained immortality from the same meteor.

==Fictional character biography==
=== Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; ===
In his debut story, Vandal Savage manipulates the Green Lantern and his secret identity Alan Scott into helping his schemes, later revealing he knows they are the same person. Savage explains that he is &quot;one million years old&quot; and was once a Cro-Magnon man who was the chief of his tribe. After being exposed to gases from a meteor, Savage is rendered comatose for months and awakens to discover that he has gained eternal youth. Savage does not reveal his original name to the Green Lantern, but claims that over the years he has lived under many identities, including an ancient king of Sumer, Cheops, Julius Caesar, and Genghis Khan. When he realized he could still die from injury, he decided to no longer act as a public man of power and instead would serve as an advisor to powerful leaders including Napoleon Bonaparte, Otto von Bismarck, and Adolf Hitler; gaining resources and political influence while others could be the target for assassination. Now in the modern-day, he wishes to become a powerful figure in the government and war industry. In the end, he is defeated when Green Lantern opens a seemingly bottomless pit beneath him, causing him to fall out of sight.

Years later, he is revealed to be alive and recruited to the original incarnation of the Injustice Society, a group dedicated to defeating the heroic Justice Society of America. During this adventure, he targets and captures JSA member Hawkman. The Justice Society proves victorious, however, and Vandal Savage is imprisoned.

By the early 1950s, the Justice Society members largely retire. Years later, Jay Garrick, the Flash (a founding member of the Justice Society), is visited by Barry Allen, the Flash of a parallel universe and a founding member of the Justice League. Barry designates his own home as Earth-One and the world of the Justice Society and Injustice Society as Earth-Two.

After 16 years of prison, Vandal Savage has his freedom again and lures the Justice Society members out of retirement, capturing them. He accidentally attracts the attention of Barry Allen, who aids the older heroes against the villain. As a result of the adventure, the Justice Society decides to return to semi-active duty. Starting in this same story, Savage is now said to be 50,000 years old rather than one million, and his original name is revealed to be Vandar Adg. The stories now say the meteor that mutated him did so through radiation rather than exotic gases, and that it did not actually explode but warped through space and time. A later story reveals that a fragment of the same radioactive meteor is recovered by a caveman named Klarn of the Bear Tribe, an enemy of Vandar Adg, who then makes it into an amulet. With this amulet, Klarn gains a unique reincarnation ability; every time he is killed or dies, he quickly reappears elsewhere on Earth in a new body, fully clothed, and with his memories of all past lives intact. Becoming one of Savage&#x27;s most frequent enemies over the millennia, he is known to many as the Immortal Man.

Following his failure to hold the Justice Society prisoner, Vandal Savage realizes he is not only aging but completely losing his immortality. He learns that the meteor that made him immortal in the first place did not explode into ash as he thought but actually warped through space and time, crossing through dimensions and into Limbo. Savage manipulates Jay Garrick and Barry Allen into helping him free the meteor back into Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, hoping another exposure will recharge his immortality. Instead, it seemingly destroys him. Since Savage was shifting between the dimensions of Earth-One and Earth-Two just before the meteor impacted with him, he is now stuck in a partial existence between both worlds, only able to achieve tangibility in one while being a shadow form in the other. He also temporarily gains the ability to project messages and images into the minds of others. Though he regains his full state of physical being later and returns to Earth-Two, he still fails to regain his immortality. Later on, he uses the Superman of Earth-Two as a power source to recharge his immortality. Savage hopes to also take all of Superman&#x27;s power, but Earth-Two&#x27;s heroes arrive and foil the scheme.

Later on, Savage, once again immortal, alters the history of Earth-One so that he has been its ruler for centuries, with Superman serving as his trusted enforcer. Realizing Savage is a cruel leader who censors news media so only good things are said about his rule, Superman joins the rebellion against the villain and then restores the original history. Traveling back in time to when he first gained his power, Savage is seemingly destroyed by the radiation of the meteor that made him immortal. Later, his body rebuilds itself from the ash, either due to his healing always being this powerful or because the meteor&#x27;s radiation temporarily enhanced his immortal abilities. Deciding to conquer the world through technology, Savage remains on modern-day Earth-One and creates the technological research corporation Abraxas in Metropolis, pretending to be an altruistic scientist and businessman while secretly continuing his plans for conquest and battling Superman. Later on, the Immortal Man (having apparently relocated to Earth-One) recruits a team of Forgotten Heroes to combat Savage&#x27;s schemes.

=== Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; ===
Following &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, several universes merged into one single timeline, creating a new version of history where the Justice Society and Justice League had always lived on the same Earth, with one team forming decades after the other. In this new history, Savage is still originally a Cro-Magnon warrior called Vandar Adg, now said to have been leader of the Blood Tribe. The Post-Crisis version of Savage is more bloodthirsty, and it is suggested by some that he is the first cannibal on record in human history. As with the Silver Age stories, the meteor that made him immortal is one that travels by warping through space and time, now specifically said to have originated from the future. Savage eventually learns the meteor didn&#x27;t empower him through radiation but by infecting him with sub-atomic robots it carried called &quot;tektites&quot;. These tektites make him ageless and able to heal from great damage and lethal wounds, while also increasing his intelligence, making him more human in form, and increasing his strength, reflexes, resiliency to injury, and tolerance to pain. The Immortal Man is still present at Savage&#x27;s origin, and still fashions an amulet from a piece of the meteor. It is now said the presence of tektites in both their bodies allows the two enemies to sense each other and sometimes be drawn to each other.

Though he is unaware of it at the time, Vandar Adg had intestinal cancer when he was made immortal. This affects the cancer cells as well, preserving them and making them unable to be removed. Throughout the centuries, the cancer causes Savage great bouts of pain and discomfort.

Along with the Immortal Man, Savage makes enemies of many across history, including the early human Anthro and the immortal mystic known as the Phantom Stranger. At different points in history, Savage faces Batman due to the hero becoming temporarily lost wandering through time as a result of the &quot;Final Crisis&quot;. Similarly, Savage often fights the time traveler Rip Hunter and his allies across the millennia. As he grows older, Savage realizes he has three human enemies who constantly reincarnate, though unlike the Immortal Man they do so in the traditional sense, needing to literally be reborn as children again following each death. Two of these enemies are known as Prince Khufu and his wife Chay-Ara in their original lives, fated to meet each other and fall in love in all subsequent lives. In the early 20th century, they are reborn as Carter Hall and Shiera Saunders, Hawkman and Hawkgirl. Vandal Savage compares the two reincarnating Hawk heroes to cockroaches. Savage&#x27;s other reincarnating enemy is a man named Mitchell Shelley, who is repeatedly reborn again and usually recalls the events of his past lives, leading him to remaining the same person. In many lives, Shelley fights Savage, becoming his most frequent enemy next to the Immortal Man.

Vandal Savage claims to have been several noteworthy figures of history, but it has been shown that at least some of these boasts are false, a means of taking credit and seeming more important. At times he enjoys being a soldier for glory or a minor conqueror. More often, unwilling to test how much damage his immortality can repair, he is content to be an advisor behind the scenes. While temporarily living in ancient Atlantis, the center of magic on Earth, Savage founds a secret society known as the Children of the Light. This organization helps topple the power of Atlantis. Before the continent sinks, Savage&#x27;s followers leave and spread across Earth, becoming known as the Illuminati. Savage serves as its secret leader for many years. In Ancient Egypt, Savage is known as Khafre and makes an enemy of Nabu, who will one day merge with a human host to become the superhero Doctor Fate.

As superheroes rise in the modern-day, Savage believes he has found enemies worthy of fighting directly. This leads him to confront Green Lantern (Alan Scott) in the 1940s, and then join the Injustice Society to fight the hero&#x27;s comrades. When he later decides the Justice Society of America have become too formidable, Vandal Savage uses his influence on several senators to shut the heroes down. In 1951, the House Un-American Activities Committee openly questions if the JSA members are secret spies and Communists, pressuring them to reveal their identities and serve the U.S. government. The JSA choose to retire instead, which Savage considers a victory as it means an end to widespread superhero activity for decades.

At some point after the retirement of the JSA, Vandal Savage fathers a daughter whom he names Scandal. As with many children he has had over the centuries, Vandal dismisses any notions of love or affection towards Scandal. However, he comes to admire her warrior spirit and talent for violence, leading him to protect her at times in the hopes that she will one day provide an even more formidable heir whom he can use.

Many years later, the debut of Superman leads to the Modern Age of Superheroes. The Justice League forms and Vandal Savage winds up opposing them. By this time, Savage has begun funding clandestine terrorist organizations and advanced scientific research, both to increase his resources and due to his realizing his immortality is weaker than it used to be. Savage starts tracking down his descendants to rely on them for organ transplants if he needs them, as his body now has a harder time regenerating full organs if they are too greatly damaged. Related to this, he funds research into cloning.

Wally West, the latest hero to be called the Flash, realizes Vandal Savage is hiding under the alias of Burt Villers, an art dealer. The two have a brief battle. Soon afterward, one of Savage&#x27;s scientific projects leads to the creation of Velocity 9, a highly-addictive drug that imbues a person with superhuman speed. Savage releases this drug to criminals who then perform high-speed crimes, but the Velocity 9 causes accelerated aging and severe strokes. The Velocity 9 scheme is thwarted by Wally West. Later on, Wally&#x27;s friend and fellow Teen Titans founder Roy Harper (known as Arsenal) is revealed to be one of Savage&#x27;s descendants.

Soon after the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, Savage captures the Immortal Man. He then funds the Lab, a group attempting to recreate the tektites that make the villain immortal. The Lab experiments on blood samples taken from both Savage and the Immortal Man, hoping to understand the sub-atomic technology. By this time, Mitchell &quot;Mitch&quot; Shelley has reincarnated, now living as a lawyer in Viceroy, South Carolina. Though suffering from visions and dreams of his past lives, Shelley is unable to learn the full truth of his past before he is targeted for death by enemies. Though he survives, he wanders the streets, brain-damaged and amnesiac. Later, he is coincidentally kidnapped by the Lab, as Savage&#x27;s organization is now testing its tektite technology by injecting it into homeless people and seeing if they survive lethal injuries. Shelley&#x27;s ability to reincarnate and remember his past lives seems to interact with the tektites, turning him into a Resurrection Man. Now whenever he is killed, he always returns, and each time he does so he possesses a different additional super-power. After escaping the Lab, Shelley&#x27;s memories return in part, and he recalls his long-time rivalry with Vandal Savage. With the Forgotten Heroes, Shelley confronts Savage and learns the Immortal Man has been his prisoner for years. When a tektite-empowered creature emerges from a time-warp, apparently from the same source that produced the meteor that gave Savage and Immortal Man their power years ago, it causes chaos and starts to disrupt reality. Shelley, Immortal Man, and Savage join forces against the creature. In the end, the Immortal Man uses his own tektite field to overload the creature&#x27;s own technology, killing them both in the process.

When the now-adult founding members of the Teen Titans decide to reform the group under the name the Titans, they soon interfere with one of Vandal Savage&#x27;s schemes. To counter them, Savage creates his own team of villains known as Tartarus (the mythological prison of the ancient Titans). The members include the Red Panzer, Gorilla Grodd, Lady Vic, Siren, and Cheshire (both an enemy of the Titans and the mother of Roy Harper&#x27;s child Lian). Tartarus targets Adeline Wilson, a leader of the terrorist group the H.I.V.E., to use her blood for a new immortality serum. Before the Titans can stop him, Savage slits Wilson&#x27;s throat. The Red Panzer dies in the subsequent battle. Savage then shoots Cheshire, distracting the Titans as he and his other recruits escape. The Titans then rescue their old teammate Omen from Tartarus and the tide is turned after the Siren changes sides. The villain group disbands.

Soon before the events of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, Vandal Savage joins the newly reorganized Secret Society of Super Villains (now simply calling itself &quot;the Society&quot;). Meanwhile, his now-adult daughter Scandal Savage joins the newest group to call itself the Secret Six, a team that opposes the Society&#x27;s agenda. Savage later reveals that he believes Scandal and her Secret Six teammate the Catman would produce a suitable and formidable heir. Scandal, however, is romantically involved with the woman Knockout. Seeing this as defiance, Savage threatens Knockout and the team.

Vandal Savage becomes leader of a doomsday cult and endows his followers with a variety of superhuman abilities thanks to a serum based on his own blood (though they lose these abilities without regular injections). His recruit Fantasia then casts illusions to trick the Flash into bringing Savage an alien &quot;Summoner&quot; device. Deciding that the planet is overpopulated and no longer an enjoyable place for him to live, Savage intends to use the Summoner to force the Thanatos asteroid to crash to Earth, causing an apocalypse event and &quot;thinning out the herd&quot; of the human race. The Flash reverses the effect of the device, pushing the asteroid away, but then Savage leaps into the path of the beam, believing he will gain greater power from the asteroid just as a meteor once gave him power before. As he is sent to the asteroid, he declares that he will protect the Flash and his family and heirs as thanks for Wally West&#x27;s help in his achievement of new power. As Savage vanishes, his followers are rounded up and their abilities fade. Savage&#x27;s immortality allows him to survive on the meteor and he later returns to Earth by &quot;hitching a ride&quot; on a comet that is headed in that direction.

A story in &quot;JSA: Classified&quot; #10-13 depicts Savage with his immortality and regenerative abilities now drained and suffering from a brain tumor. Believing he will die soon, Savage decides to try one last act of revenge against Alan Scott, the first superhero he ever fought and his first true enemy of the modern era. When this fails, Savage consumes a clone of himself to restore his power, at least temporarily. This story claims Savage no longer has descendants to harvest for survival and says he is only 37,000 years old, both of which contradict comics published before and afterward, leaving the story&#x27;s place in canon questionable.

Savage later returns as the mastermind behind a group of superhuman Neo-Nazis called the Fourth Reich, targeting the heirs of several Golden Age superheroes. They kill the heroes Minute-Man, General Glory, and Mister America, along with their families. The Fourth Reich kills nearly all of Commander Steel&#x27;s family. The battle ends when the Fourth Reich is defeated and Savage is struck down by a fire truck.

===&quot;Final Crisis&quot;===
In &quot;Final Crisis: Revelations&quot;, the Order of the Stone (who worship Cain from the Bible) comes in possession of the Spear of Destiny, a magical item which Hitler once used to keep superheroes from entering Nazi-occupied territories. They plunge the Spear of Destiny into Savage&#x27;s body, causing the spirit of Cain to be reborn in him. Using the Spear, Savage/Cain separates the Spectre, the Spirit of Vengeance, from his human host, then enslaves him. Savage/Cain&#x27;s plans are undone by Renee Montoya, the vigilante known as the Question, who manages to steal the Spear and reunite the Spectre with his host. The Spectre sentences Savage to walk the Earth, unable to disguise the Mark of Cain on his face, to be reviled and denied rest until God says otherwise.

The superhero team known as the Outsiders meet a group calling themselves the Insiders, members of Savage&#x27;s tribe who were also exposed to the power of the meteor he encountered, all gaining immortality as a result. The Insiders seek out meteorite fragments of the original meteor, while Savage forms a temporary alliance with the near-immortal terrorist cult leader Ra&#x27;s al Ghul to thwart the group. By this time, Savage begins to believe he is in fact the Biblical figure Cain. He succeeds in ridding himself of the Mark of Cain by passing it on to the Question. Montoya then removes the Mark of Cain from herself simply by acknowledging her flaws and shortcomings, a feat Vandal Savage could never consider.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===
In 2011, &quot;The New 52&quot; rebooted the DC universe. Vandal Savage gained immortality and superhuman strength by encountering a small meteorite that broke off from a radioactive comet that passed by Earth. Savage later learns that this meteor nearly struck Krypton before, but was deflected by an ancestor of Superman&#x27;s. During the Dark Ages and the time of King Arthur, Savage joins with Etrigan the Demon, Madame Xanadu, and the Shining Knight to form the Demon Knights, fighting powerful forces that threaten humanity. Savage himself does this not out of altruism but to avoid boredom and test his might.

In the modern day, the series &quot;DC Universe Presents&quot; presents Savage as an imprisoned serial killer who claims he is ancient and that his murders were sacrifices to forgotten gods. His daughter Kassandra &quot;Kass&quot; Sage is an FBI agent who consults him on a case. In this timeline, Savage is also the father of Angelo Bend, whom he later kills (although Angelo appears again without explanation as the Angle Man).

Savage is later depicted as a villain free of imprisonment. After Superman&#x27;s identity is exposed and he finds himself losing his powers, Superman eventually learns that Savage is responsible for his power drain after somehow infecting Superman with a form of radiation that hinders his body&#x27;s ability to absorb sunlight. After capturing most of the Justice League and stealing Superman&#x27;s Fortress of Solitude, Savage reveals that the comet which empowered him before will be passing by Earth again, and he intends to collect it with the aid of some of his mortal descendants, all of whom gain power as the comet approaches. Reaching the comet, he gains greater power and attempts to recruit Superman to his side after Superman is able to cure himself of the radiation inhibiting his powers through a risky form of kryptonite &quot;chemotherapy&quot;. Rejecting Savage&#x27;s offer, Superman sends the comet away, causing Savage to revert to his default form and power level.

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot;===
In 2016, DC Comics implemented another relaunch of its books called &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to &quot;The New 52&quot;. In the new history, Vandal Savage is one of a group of five people who are made immortal by a radioactive meteorite that fell to Earth many thousands of years before recorded history. This group becomes the Council of Immortals, hoping to shape the human race from the shadows. Each of these immortals, including Savage, can share their ability to stop aging with others, creating many followers down through the centuries.

In the modern day, Vandal Savage attempts to create a new Injustice Gang, but his plans are thwarted by Lex Luthor, who decides to form his own Legion of Doom. Luthor then seemingly beats Savage to death with a doorknob made from a piece of the Totality, the oldest energy source in existence, and one of the few things that could successfully kill the immortal cave man.

When Hawkman and Hawkgirl recount their time with the Justice Society and the day that they fought the Injustice Society, Vandal Savage was seen as a member of the Injustice Society. Hawkgirl faced off against Savage. After Brain Wave unleashes a powerful psychic attack that knocks everyone down, Per Degaton and Savage prepare to finish off Hawkman and Hawkgirl. Hawkman and Hawkgirl throw their maces enough for them to collide. This enables the Justice Society to turn the tables against the Injustice Society.

Thanks to the conclusion of &quot;Dark Nights: Death Metal&quot;, Vandal Savage has been restored to the present day, becoming a member of the joint hero/villain collaboration on the space station &quot;The Totality&quot;.

==Powers and abilities==
Vandal Savage&#x27;s long life has allowed him to become a master of hand-to-hand combat, an expert in military tactics and a variety of weapons, and familiar with many cultures, languages, and fields of science. His choice of weaponry changes depending on the battle. Sometimes he employs swords, knives, and maces, while other times he wields advanced technology, such as energy-based weapons, a suit that allows him limited flight, or a pen-sized sonic device that can immobilize people with super-speed.

In the original Golden Age and Silver Age stories, Vandal Savage was ageless but could still die by injury, which is the traditional definition of immortality. Over time, he began gradually aging and then lost his immortality completely in the twentieth century before finding a way to regain it. For a brief time when he existed out of phase with his home dimension of Earth-Two, Savage was able to mentally project messages and images.

Starting in the 1980s, Savage was depicted not only as ageless but also having superhuman healing abilities, meaning his body could repair itself from lethal damage and destruction. He also exhibited greater strength, speed, reflexes, resiliency to injury, and tolerance to pain than the average human being. In the 1990s, it was revealed that the source of his power was not radiation-induced mutation but a colony of sub-atomic robots called &quot;tektites&quot; inhabiting his bloodstream and cells. These tektites work to preserve and rebuild his body by any means necessary. Over time, this immortality has weakened, and Savage has had to rely on his children, descendants, or clones for organ replacement and blood transfusions. He has also funded research into tektite replication.

Later stories revealed Savage had intestinal cancer when he acquired his immortality. The regenerative power that keeps him alive also keeps the cancerous cells from being removed. Throughout his life, this causes Savage intermittent bouts of pain.

Savage&#x27;s blood can be used to create a serum that can imbue another person with superhuman powers. The nature of these superhuman abilities is unpredictable. The powers cannot be maintained without regular injections of the serum. Following &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, it is indicated that Savage&#x27;s blood can also be used to make another person ageless.

During the &quot;Final Crisis&quot; crossover event, Savage bore the metaphysical &quot;Mark of Cain&quot; on his face. Though the mark could vanish if the bearer recognized their own shortcomings and flaws, Savage did not realize this and passed it on to another person.

In the &quot;New 52&quot; timeline, Savage was mutated by radiation from a passing comet, one which had almost destroyed the planet Krypton years before. This gave him not only immortality and advanced healing, but also superhuman strength. When Savage later encountered the comet again, his proximity to it increased his power, giving him flight, organic armor, and an energy field of an unknown nature. When the comet was destroyed, Savage apparently lost these extra abilities.

==Children==
Over the millennia, Savage has occasionally fathered children and has many descendants alive on earth. One such descendant is Roy Harper. Savage&#x27;s more recent children who still live include: his daughter Scandal Savage (the only one of his children he considers his true heir) and Cliff DeWitt, who helps run the clandestine organization known as the Lab (which gave the Resurrection Man his powers). The demon Grendel, famously known for his role in the story of &quot;Beowulf&quot;, is also apparently a child of Vandal Savage. Grendel refers to Savage as &quot;Cain&quot;, a reference to the first murderer in the Bible.

The &quot;New 52&quot; version of Vandal Savage also fathered Kassidy Sage, an FBI agent, and Angelo Bend, the villain known as the Angle Man.

==Other versions==
=== &quot;DC One Million&quot; ===
An older future version of Vandal Savage from the 853rd century appears in &quot;DC One Million&quot;. This Savage was noticeably older than his 20th-century counterpart and is no longer truly immortal. This version of Savage was later permanently killed by a nuclear explosion.

===&quot;Star Trek/Legion of Super-Heroes&quot;===
Vandal Savage appears in the &quot;Star Trek&quot;/&quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; crossover, co-published by DC Comics and IDW Publishing in 2011. This version is a parallel universe version of Flint, a mysterious immortal previously encountered by James T. Kirk and his crew. In one timeline, Savage/Flint has adopted the name &quot;Emperor Vandar the First&quot;, having somehow captured Q in the distant past and harnessed his power. When Kirk&#x27;s senior staff and some of the Legion find themselves in Vandar&#x27;s version of the 23rd century, they split into teams to confront Vandar in the present and find the source of his power in the past. Eventually, Brainiac 5 and Spock free Q and undo the timeline where Vandar became emperor of humanity.

===&quot;The Multiversity&quot;===
An alternate universe incarnation of Vandal Savage appears in Grant Morrison&#x27;s 2014 miniseries &quot;The Multiversity&quot;. This version is an inter-dimensional pirate from Earth-40, a world resembling the 1930s and ruled by pulp fiction-style villains.

==In other media==
===Television===

* Writers Danny Bilson and Paul De Meo expressed interest in featuring Vandal Savage in &quot;The Flash&quot; had the series been picked up for a second season.
* Vandal Savage appears in &quot;Justice League&quot;, voiced by Phil Morris. This version is approximately twenty-five thousand years old. In the three-part episode &quot;The Savage Time&quot;, he attempts to use future technology to help Nazi Germany win World War II so he can eventually conquer the world, only to be thwarted by the time-traveling Justice League and WWII heroes Steve Trevor, the Blackhawks, and the Easy Company. In the two-part episode &quot;Maid of Honor&quot;, he resurfaces in the present, passing himself off as his own grandson while attempting to marry Kasnia&#x27;s princess Audrey to obtain political power, but is thwarted by the Justice League once more. In the two-part episode &quot;Hereafter&quot;, Savage devastates the Earth using a gravity-based superweapon, but comes to regret his actions 30,000 years later. After Toyman&#x27;s weapon transports Superman to his time, Savage helps him return to the present to stop his younger self and restore the future despite knowing he will be erased from existence.
* A character inspired by Vandal Savage and King Kull named Kru&#x27;ll the Eternal appears in &quot;&quot;, voiced by Michael Dorn. Similar to Savage, he is a prehistoric human who gained immortality from exposure to a meteorite. Following his introduction in the episode &quot;Menace of the Conqueror Caveman!&quot;, he joins the Monster Society of Evil in the episode &quot;The Malicious Mr. Mind!&quot;.
* A character inspired by Vandal Savage named Curtis Knox appears in the &quot;Smallville&quot; episode &quot;Cure&quot;, portrayed by Dean Cain. Similar to Savage, Knox is a centuries-old immortal, and is additionally implied to have lived as Napoleon and Jack the Ripper and been a member of the Nazi Party. Additionally, he was originally referred to as Vandal Savage in the script, but the producers were prevented from using the name.
* Vandal Savage appears in &quot;Young Justice&quot;, voiced by Miguel Ferrer in the first two seasons and subsequently by David Kaye following Ferrer&#x27;s death. This version is the leader of the Light and a Mongolian Cro-Magnon from the Pleistocene who sports facial scars from a previous encounter with a cave bear. In the 10th and 13th centuries, Savage encountered and formed alliances with Klarion the Witch Boy and Darkseid respectively and went on to become the ancestor of Nabu and the Homo magi and Atlantean races through his grandson Arion. As of the present, he and Klarion, among others, founded the Light based on a survival of the fittest mentality, with Savage believing that the Justice League is stopping humanity from evolving further.
* Vandal Savage appears in media set in the Arrowverse, portrayed by Casper Crump. This version originated as Hath-Set, an Egyptian priest who became immortal after being exposed to dark matter ore from Thanagarian meteorites and spent the succeeding millennia reinventing himself as Vandal Savage, hunting Prince Khufu and Priestess Chay-Ara&#x27;s reincarnations to strengthen himself, and mentoring esteemed conquerors such as Per Degaton.
** First appearing in the crossover event &quot;Heroes Join Forces&quot;, Savage obtains the Staff of Horus and attempts to kill Khufu and Chay-Ara&#x27;s current reincarnations, Carter Hall and Kendra Saunders, only to be temporarily killed by them, the Flash, the Green Arrow, and the latter pair&#x27;s allies before Malcolm Merlyn collects Savage&#x27;s ashes.
** A future incarnation of Savage appears in &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot;. In the first season, he allies with the Time Masters, who believe he is the only one who can thwart a Thanagarian invasion in 2166. However, rogue Time Master Rip Hunter forms the Legends to kill Savage in retaliation for Savage killing his family. After the Legends kill the Time Masters, Savage attempts to create a temporal paradox by detonating Thanagarian meteorites in three different time periods, but the radiation renders him and his past selves mortal again. The Legends eventually destroy the meteorites while Saunders kills Savage. As of the fourth season, Savage has grown fond of the Legends following his death, respecting their prowess, despite having been sent to Hell.

After a battle with the Suicide Squad, Savage is killed after Professor Zoom phases the card out of his body.

<text>Allium tuberosum (garlic chives, Oriental garlic, Asian chives, Chinese chives, Chinese leek) is a species of plant native to the Chinese province of Shanxi, and cultivated and naturalized elsewhere in Asia and around the world. It has a number of uses in Asian cuisine.

== Description ==
&quot;Allium tuberosum&quot; is a rhizomatous, clump-forming perennial plant growing from a small, elongated bulb (about , across) that is tough and fibrous. Unlike either onion or garlic, it has strap-shaped leaves with triangular bases, about wide. It produces many white flowers in a round cluster (umbel) on stalks tall. It grows in slowly expanding perennial clumps, but also readily sprouts from seed. In warmer areas (USDA zone 8 and warmer), garlic chives may remain green all year round. In cold areas (USDA zones 7 to 4b), leaves and stalks completely die back to the ground, and resprout from roots or rhizomes in the spring.

The flavor is more like garlic than chives.

== Taxonomy ==
Originally described by Johan Peter Rottler, the species name was validly published by Curt Polycarp Joachim Sprengel in 1825. &quot;A. tuberosum&quot; is classified within &quot;Allium&quot; in subgenus &quot;Butomissa&quot; , section &quot;Butomissa&quot; , a group consisting of only &quot;A. tuberosum&quot; and &quot;A. ramosum&quot; , which have been variously regarded as either one or two genetic entities.

== Distribution and habitat ==
&quot;Allium tuberosum&quot; originated in the Siberian–Mongolian–North Chinese steppes, but is widely cultivated and naturalised. It has been reported as growing wild in scattered locations in the United States (Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Nebraska, Alabama, Iowa, Arkansas, and Wisconsin). However, it is believed to be more widespread in North America because of the availability of seeds and seedlings of this species as an exotic herb and because of its high aggressiveness. This species is also widespread across much of mainland Europe and invasive in other areas of the world.

== Ecology ==
A late summer- to autumn-blooming plant, &quot;A. tuberosum&quot; is one of several &quot;Allium&quot; species known as wild onion and/or wild garlic that, in various parts of the world, such as Australia, are listed as noxious weeds or as invasive &quot;serious high impact environmental and/or agricultural weeds that spread rapidly and often create monocultures&quot;.

== Cultivation ==

Often grown as an ornamental plant in gardens, several cultivars are available. &quot;A. tuberosum&quot; is distinctive by blooming later than most native or naturalised species of &quot;Allium&quot;. It is cold-hardy to USDA zones 4–10 (). Garlic chives are regarded as easy to grow in many conditions and may spread readily by seeds or can be intentionally propagated by dividing their clumps.

A number of varieties have been developed for either improved leaf (&quot;e.g.&quot; &#x27;Shiva&#x27;) or flower stem (&quot;e.g.&quot; &#x27;Nien Hua&#x27;) production. While the emphasis in Asia has been primarily culinary, in North America, the interest has been more as an ornamental. &#x27;Monstrosum&#x27; is a giant ornamental cultivar.

== Uses ==

Uses include as ornamental plants, including cut and dried flowers, and as a culinary herb. Garlic chives have been widely cultivated for centuries in East Asia for their culinary value. The flat leaves, the stalks, and immature, unopened flower buds are used as flavouring. Another form is &quot;blanched&quot; by regrowing after cutting under cover to produce white-yellow leaves and a subtler flavor.

=== China ===
The leaves are used as a flavoring in a similar way to chives or scallions, and as a stir fry ingredient. They are often used in dumplings with eggs, shrimp, and/or pork. A Chinese flatbread similar to the scallion pancake may be made with garlic chives instead of scallions. Garlic chives are also one of the main ingredients used with yi mein dishes. Its flowers are fermented to make garlic chive flower sauce (). 

When the leaves of garlic chives are blanched by growing them in dark environments these are called () or (), known in English as yellow garlic chives. These are considered a delicacy and are used in various stir fry dishes.

=== India===
In Manipur and other northeastern states of India, it is grown and used as a substitute for garlic and onion in cooking and is known as &quot;maroi nakuppi&quot; in Manipuri.

=== Japan ===
In Japan, where the plant is known as (), it is used both for its garlic-like flavor and its sweetness, in miso soups and salads, stir-fries with eggs, and Japanese dishes such as gyōza dumplings and fried liver.

=== Central Asia ===
In Central Asian countries such as Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, where the plant has been introduced through cultivation by Dungan farmers and ties with neighboring China, garlic chives are known by transliterations of their name. Used in cooking, it is sometimes added as a filling to manty, samsa, laghman, yuta, ashlan-fu, and other typical dishes.

=== Korea ===
Known as (), garlic chives are widely used in Korean cuisine. They can be eaten fresh as , pickled as kimchi and , and pan-fried in (pancake). They are also one of the most common herbs served with (soup with rice), as well as a common ingredient in (dumplings).

=== Nepal ===
In Nepal, cooks fry a curried vegetable dish of potatoes and &quot;A. tuberosum&quot; known as &quot;dunduko sag&quot;.

=== Vietnam===
In Vietnam, the leaves of garlic chives, known as , are cut up into short pieces and used as the only vegetable in a broth with sliced pork kidneys.

<doc id="530166" wikidata="Q7396175" url="?curid=530166" title="Sabine Pass, Port Arthur, Texas">
<text>Sabine Pass is a neighborhood in Port Arthur, Texas. It had been incorporated in 1861 before being formally annexed by Port Arthur in 1978. However, Sabine Pass retains its own distinct identity with its own school district, post office, and port authority. The Port Arthur Convention and Visitors Bureau stated that Sabine Pass is &quot;often regarded as&quot; being a &quot;self-contained&quot; community.

Sabine Pass was the site of two naval battles, the First Battle of Sabine Pass, and the Second Battle of Sabine Pass, as well as land skirmishes that occurred around the historic Sabine Pass Lighthouse during the Civil War.

== History ==
In 1832, Thomas Corts (of England) and John McGaffey (of New Hampshire) were among the first settlers of the Sabine Pass area. Stephen Hendrickson Everitt (1806–1844) wrote a letter to Republic of Texas President Mirabeau B. Lamar on March 11, 1839, seeking to establish a post office in the area. There was already a Republic of Texas custom&#x27;s house, established in 1837, as well as a United States customs house at Garrison Ridge, and the nearest post office was 40 miles away. On October 19, 1839, Everitt, representing John Bevil, filed an intention with Chief Justice Palmer in Jasper County, to form a city to be known as &quot;City of the Pass&quot; with 1600 acres and 2500 lots, but was unsuccessful. There is some confusion as to if this was Sabine Pass that he had previously written about or an intended city to the south. Records also indicate that in 1839, Sam Houston, along with Philip Sublette and associates, laid out what is referred to as &quot;the first townsite of Sabine&quot;, containing 2,060 lots with Niles F. Smith as the agent. Niles was appointed collector of revenue for the port of Sabine 1842. Philip Sublett and Houston were friends and associates. Houston stayed with Sublett while recuperating from wound received at San Jacinto. In 1836, Sublett nominated Houston for president of the Republic of Texas.

According to the Adams-Onis Treaty the Louisiana boundary was &quot;to landfall&quot; on the west bank of the Sabine River but there was still a border dispute between the United States and the Republic of Texas. The US claimed jurisdiction down the Sabine River to the Gulf of Mexico and Texas claimed it ended at the Sabine River delta. By 1838 the U.S. assigned the revenue cutter USRC Woodbury (1837) to patrol the Sabine Lake as part of the Gulf of Mexico patrol. By 1844, the Republic of Texas had the Santa Anna patrolling the area. There was one instance that could have led to war between the United States and the Republic of Texas. The Santa Anna had instructed two schooners loading cotton to stop at the custom house to pay a tonnage fee. The customs house had two cannons and when the schooners attempted to run the customs port the agent fired a warning shot across the bow of each ship and then six more as an attempt to sink them. Both schooners weighed anchor and settled the matter.

=== Community name ===
The name of the community evolved over time from City of Sabine, to Sabine City, and then to Sabine Pass. Although requested in 1839, and there was a steam lumber mill in the community in 1846, a post office was not established until 1847, as the &quot;Sabine City Post Office&quot;. In 1841, William Kennedy, in &quot;The Rise, Progress and Prospects of the Republic of Texas&quot; (published in London in 1841), mentioned the settlement of the area and wrote, &quot;Taylor&#x27;s creek, a small stream that enters Sabine Bay from the west, a few miles above the city of Sabine ...&quot;, By not capitalizing &quot;city&quot; it appears that the city was named Sabine. No records indicate that the settlement was ever called just &quot;Sabine&quot; so this might have been referring to the name of the place as &quot;City of Sabine&quot;. There is reference that General J. B. Magruder, &quot;ordered construction of a major fortification of five redoubts seven miles west of Sabine City ...&quot; in 1863, but Sabine Pass was incorporated on June 15, 1861.

The expectations of the earlier settlers, as well as the founders of Sabine Pass, never materialized. Arthur Stilwell had original plans for the southern terminus of the Kansas City, Pittsburg and Gulf Railroad Company to be Sabine Pass. But the Kountze brothers, who owned the land Stilwell needed for the railroad, refused to make a deal so Port Arthur was born.

=== Sabine Pass and the Civil War ===
During the American Civil War, Fort Manhassett, Fort Sabine, and Fort Griffin (not to be confused with the later frontier fort) were built by the Confederacy to protect the waterway of Sabine Pass, the Sabine River, and the Neches River under General J. B. Magruder.

Two battles, the First Battle of Sabine Pass, and the Second Battle of Sabine Pass, both occurred around the Sabine Lake estuary, in Sabine Pass, between the southern end of the current community of Sabine Pass, Texas and the Sabine Pass Lighthouse on the Louisiana side. In 1970, construction crews attempting to repair SH-87 accidentally dug up Civil War era ammunition. The following is an excerpt from Texas State Highway 87:
In 1970, road machinery used in its construction accidentally dug up several cannonballs and crumbling kegs of black powder about 10 miles west of Sabine Pass. Further excavation eventually produced more kegs of black powder and several hundred cannonballs. The ammunition had been buried there by Confederate soldiers in what were the diches of Fort Manhassett in 1865. Fort Manhassett was a series of earthworks constructed by the Confederacy in 1863 to defend the western approaches to Sabine Pass.
== Geography ==
The community lies along State Highway 87 at Sabine Pass, thirty miles southeast of Beaumont in extreme southeastern Jefferson County. Sabine Pass is outside of the Jefferson County levee system, which protects other communities in the county.

=== Hurricanes ===

Because of the short distance separating Sabine Pass from the Gulf of Mexico, the city has suffered greatly from numerous hurricanes since its founding. After hurricanes in 1886, 1900, 1915, and the devastating Hurricane Audrey in 1957, economic development moved north from Sabine Pass to the cities of Beaumont, Port Arthur, and Orange, which still dominate the area&#x27;s economy today.

On September 24, 2005, Hurricane Rita came ashore over Sabine Lake—the surge from the storm destroyed more than 90% of the structures in Sabine Pass. In February 2006, the team from &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot; (&quot;EM: HE&quot;) visited the town and rebuilt the Firehouse (which included a new Firetruck worth $400,000), the High School Auditorium and gave dozens of families $350 gift cards from Sears to replace items such as clothes, space heaters, blankets etc., lost due to Hurricane Rita. This town was featured in the &quot;EM:HE - After The Storm Texas Special&quot; which aired on the ABC on April 14, 2006. Adam Saunders, a spokesperson for the City of Port Arthur, said that of the 225 houses in Sabine pass, 20% of them were livable after Rita hit Sabine Pass.

In September 2008, Hurricane Ike struck Galveston and managed to generate the highest surge ever recorded at Sabine Pass. Saunders said that a fewer number of houses remained livable after Ike than after Rita. Cindy Horswell of the &quot;McClatchy - Tribune Business News&quot; said that Sabine Pass was &quot;among those hardest hit&quot; by Hurricane Ike. 225 families lived in Sabine Pass pre-Ike, and in January 2009 Steve Fitzgibbons, the city manager of the City of Port Arthur, estimated that at that time, half of the families had returned to Sabine Pass post-Ike. Fire station #4, the one built by &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot;, was destroyed by Ike, and FEMA provided funding for a new fire station. The new station, built 12 feet above sea level and able to withstand 150 mile-per-hour winds, was dedicated in August 2013.

== Arts and culture ==
Sabine Pass Battleground State Historic Site
is an outdoor sculpture park that covers the history of the Sabine Pass Battleground during the Civil War. The park features an interpretive pavilion and walkway, a 14-foot statue and monument, ADA-accessible sidewalks and restrooms, covered picnic tables and grills, 4-lane boat ramps with ADA-accessible dock, 1/4 mole of shoreline with safety railing.

== Wildlife habitats ==
Sabine Pass is known for its wildlife. Sea Rim State Park and McFaddin National Wildlife Refuge lie at the end of Highway 87. The two provide excellent wildlife and especially bird watching venues. Camping on the Gulf of Mexico beach at Sea Rim State Park is a popular attraction.

== Government and infrastructure ==
While Port Arthur annexed Sabine Pass in 1978, the census of the two began to be enumerated together since the 1990s. While Sabine Pass has a separate school district, post office, water district, and port authority, it is incorporated into the city of Port Arthur. Police and fire protection is provided by the Port Arthur city government.

=== Legislative Districts ===
*State Board of Education; District 007
*Texas House of Representatives; District 021
*Texas Senate; District 017
*U.S. Congressional; District 002

== Education ==
Sabine Pass Independent School District serves the community. The Sabine Pass School District is assigned to Galveston College in Galveston.

<doc id="530176" wikidata="Q7330278" url="?curid=530176" title="Toledo Bend Reservoir">
<text>Toledo Bend Reservoir is a reservoir on the Sabine River between Texas and Louisiana. The lake has an area of , the largest man-made body of water partially in both Louisiana and Texas, the largest in the South, and the fifth largest by surface acre in the United States. The dam is capable of generating 92 megawatts of electrical power. The dam itself is located in the northeast corner of Newton County, Texas; however, that county includes very little of the reservoir, as most of it extends northward into parts of Sabine and DeSoto parishes in Louisiana, and Sabine, Shelby, and Panola counties in Texas.

==Historical development==
The land along the Orange area often flooded from the Sabine, with destructive effects. Also, the considerations for municipal, industrial, agricultural, and recreational purposes were part of the reasons the Texas State Legislature formed the &quot;Sabine River Authority of Texas&quot; (SRA-T) in 1949, and in 1950 the Louisiana State Legislature created the &quot;Sabine River Authority, State of Louisiana&quot; (SRA-L) for the project.

The two autonomous entities formed the &quot;Sabine River Compact&quot;, a memorandum of agreement, approved by the Legislatures of the States of Texas (1953) and Louisiana (1954), The U.S. Congress, and the President. These organizations and the compact were a result of efforts that began with the &quot;Sabine River Watershed Association&quot; of Texas after World War II as well as citizens from Louisiana, to create a freshwater supply, that included hydroelectric power, as well as providing recreation.

With both authorities in agreement, in 1955 a feasibility report was initiated and by 1959, the two states allocated 30 million dollars for the project. The land was acquired in 1963, with the work following the subsequent year. The &quot;Massman-Johnson Construction Company&quot; served as the general contractor, and by the completion of the project in , Texas&#x27; estimated share of the funds was $70 million. The dam was built by the two states, without any assistance from the federal government.

==History==
Beginning in May 1963, land acquisitions for Toledo Bend Reservoir started as a joint management project of Texas and Louisiana River Authorities. Construction on the Toledo Bend Dam, spillway, and power plant, began on May 11, 1964. The closure section of the earthen embankment and impoundment of water was begun in October 1966. The power plant was completed and began operating in the early part of 1969. The Toledo Bend Project was constructed primarily for the purposes of water supply, hydroelectric power generation, and recreation.

Toledo Bend Reservoir forms a portion of the boundary between the states of Texas and Louisiana. From the dam site, which is north of Burkeville, TX, the reservoir extends up the river for about to Logansport, LA, and inundates land in Sabine, Shelby, Panola, and Newton Counties, Texas, and Sabine and DeSoto Parishes, Louisiana.

In 2003, during recovery operations following the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster, some remains of the astronauts were recovered west of the Reservoir.

===Area impact===
Many communities were affected in the impacted parishes and counties.

====Sabine Parish====
In Sabine Parish, there were several communities that included houses and other buildings such as schools and churches predominantly poor and minority, that were inundated.
*Pine Flat Community (100 individuals and included about 50 homes and a school),
*Barlake community, 
*Richard Neck community,
*Kites Landing

The water, normally covering an area of about has a controlled storage capacity of .

Toledo Bend is the nation&#x27;s only public water conservation and hydroelectric power project to be undertaken without federal participation in its permanent financing.

==Public recreation==
Toledo Bend, with its of shoreline, offers a large variety of recreational activities and is a major element in serving the growing demand for water oriented outdoor recreation. Both private and public facilities are available for swimming, boating, picnicking, fishing, camping, hunting, and sightseeing. The reservoir is a popular location for freshwater fishing with many clubs hosting tournaments.

At present, the lake is best suited to shallow draft power boats due to a large number of trees and stumps that are still in the body of the lake. Although there are numerous well marked boat lanes that have been cleared of stumps and trees, one should use caution even on the boat lanes; one should use extreme caution when off the boat lanes and maintain a watch for stumps and/or trees as well as floating logs.

The lake is home to the Toledo Bend Army Recreation Park. The park is located on the south end of the lake, and is available only to active and retired military personnel and government employees. The park offers a convenience store with well-maintained fleet of pontoon boats, bay boats, bass boats, kayaks, and canoes for rent. A developed beach area with a bath house, cabins, and yurts are available. The park is operated by the US Army at nearby Fort Johnson in Leesville, Vernon Parish.

<doc id="530178" wikidata="Q211791" url="?curid=530178" title="Heckler &amp; Koch G3">
<text>The Heckler &amp; Koch G3 () is a select-fire battle rifle chambered in 7.62×51mm NATO developed in the 1950s by the German firearms manufacturer Heckler &amp; Koch, in collaboration with the Spanish state-owned firearms manufacturer CETME. The G3 was the service rifle of the German &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; until it was replaced by the Heckler &amp; Koch G36 in the 1990s, and was adopted into service with numerous other countries.

The G3 has been exported to over 70 countries and manufactured under license in at least 15 countries. Over 7.8 million G3s have been produced. Its modular design was used for several other HK firearm models, including the HK21, MP5, HK33, PSG1, and G41.

==History==
The origin of the G3 can be traced back to the final years of World War II when Mauser engineers at the Light Weapon Development Group (&quot;Abteilung 37&quot;) at Oberndorf am Neckar designed the &quot;Maschinenkarabiner Gerät 06&quot; (MKb &quot;Gerät&quot; 06, &quot;machine carbine device 06&quot;) prototype assault rifle chambered for the intermediate 7.92×33mm &quot;Kurz&quot; cartridge, first with the &quot;Gerät&quot; 06 model using a roller-locked short recoil mechanism originally adapted from the MG 42 machine gun but with a fixed barrel and conventional gas-actuated piston rod. With careful attention to the mechanical ratios, the gas system could be omitted. The resultant weapon, &quot;Gerät&quot; 06H (the &quot;H&quot; suffix is an abbreviation for &quot;halbverriegelt&quot; - &quot;half-locked&quot;) was assigned the designation StG 45(M) (&quot;Sturmgewehr 45(M)&quot;, assault rifle 45) but was not produced in significant numbers and the war ended before the first production rifles were completed.

The German technicians involved in developing the StG 45(M) were taken to work in France at Centre d&#x27;Etudes et d&#x27;Armement de Mulhouse (CEAM). The StG 45(M) mechanism was modified by Ludwig Vorgrimler and Theodor Löffler at the Mulhouse facility between 1946 and 1949. Three versions were made, chambered in .30 Carbine, 7.92×33mm &quot;Kurz&quot;, and the experimental 7.65×35mm French short cartridge developed by Cartoucherie de Valence in 1948. A 7.5×38mm cartridge using a partial aluminium bullet was abandoned in 1947. Löffler&#x27;s design, designated &quot;Carabine Mitrailleuse Modèle 1950&quot;, was retained for trials among 12 different prototypes designed by CEAM, MAC, and MAS. Engaged in the Indochina War and being the second NATO contributor, France canceled the adoption of these new weapons for financial reasons.

In 1950, Vorgrimler moved to Spain where he created the LV-50 rifle chambered for the &quot;Kurz&quot; cartridge and later, the proprietary 7.92×40mm CETME M53 round. At this point, the rifle was renamed the &quot;Modelo 2&quot;. The &quot;Modelo&quot; 2 drew the attention of the West German Bundesgrenzschutz (Border Guards), who sought to re-equip the newly formed national defense forces. Not willing to accept a cartridge outside of the NATO specification, the Germans asked CETME to develop a 7.62×51mm version of the rifle. The resulting CETME Model A was chambered for the 7.62×51mm CETME cartridge which was identical in chamber dimensions but had a reduced-power load compared to the 7.62×51mm NATO round. Further development of the rifle with input from H&amp;K produced the CETME Model B which received several modifications, including the ability to fire from a closed bolt in both semi-automatic and automatic firing modes, a new perforated sheet metal handguard (the folding bipod had been the foregrip in previous models), improved ergonomics and a slightly longer barrel with a 22 mm rifle grenade launcher guide. In 1958, this rifle was accepted into service with the Spanish Army as the &quot;Modelo 58&quot;, using the 7.62×51mm CETME round.

In 1956, the Bundesgrenzschutz canceled their planned procurement of the CETME rifles, adopting the Belgian-made FN FAL as the &quot;Gewehr&quot; 1 (G1) instead. However, the newly formed West German Army (&quot;Bundeswehr&quot;) now showed interest and soon purchased a number of CETME rifles (7.62×51mm NATO chambering) for further testing. The CETME, known as the &quot;Automatisches Gewehr&quot; G3 according to German nomenclature, competed successfully against the Swiss SIG SG 510 (G2) and the American AR-10 (G4) to replace the previously favored G1 rifle. In 1956 the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; started extended troop trials with 400 CETME rifles. Heckler &amp; Koch made a number of changes to the CETME rifles. In January 1959, the Bundeswehr officially adopted the technically improved CETME proposal. The West German government wanted the G3 rifle to be produced under license in Germany; purchase of the G1 had previously fallen through over FN&#x27;s refusal to grant such a license. In the case of the G3, the Dutch firm Nederlandse Wapen en Munitiefabriek (NWM) held production and sales rights to the CETME design outside of Spain. To acquire production rights, the West German government offered NWM contracts to supply the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) with 20mm ammunition. Production of the G3 was then assigned to Rheinmetall and Heckler &amp; Koch. The latter company already had ties to CETME, and had worked to further optimize the CETME rifle for use with the full-power 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge (as opposed to the downgraded CETME variant). In 1969, Rheinmetall gave up production rights to the G3 in exchange for Heckler &amp; Koch&#x27;s promise not to bid on MG 3 machine gun production. Later in 1977, the West German government ceded ownership of G3 production and sales rights exclusively to Heckler &amp; Koch. After obtaining these rights, Heckler &amp; Koch initially had to pay the government 4 Deutsche Marks per rifle, despite having been awarded the contract by the German government.

Initial production G3 rifles differed substantially from more recent models; early rifles featured closed-type mechanical flip-up sights (with two apertures), a lightweight folding bipod, a stamped sheet steel handguard, a wooden buttstock (in fixed stock models) or a telescopic metal stock. Before delivery to the Bundeswehr, each G3 went through functional checks, zeroing the sight line (&quot;Anschießen&quot;) and a shooting test at the factory. In the process, five shots were fired at a target at with particularly accurate sighting-in ammunition. The 5-shot group could not exceed (1.2 mil/4.13 MOA) diameter. The weapon was modernized during its service life (among other minor modifications it received new sights, a different flash suppressor, and a synthetic handguard and shoulder stock), resulting in the most recent production models, the G3A3 (with a fixed polymer stock) and the G3A4 (telescoping metal stock). The rifle proved successful in the export market, being adopted by the armed forces of over 40 countries. Of that figure, 18 countries undertook domestic production of the G3 under license. Known manufacturers of the weapon included France (MAS), Greece (Hellenic Defence Systems), Iran (Defense Industries Organization), Luxembourg (Luxemburg Defense Technologie), Mexico, Myanmar, Norway (Kongsberg Våpenfabrikk), Pakistan (Pakistan Ordnance Factories), Portugal (FBP), Saudi Arabia (Military Industries Corporation (Saudi Arabia)), Sweden (Husqvarna Vapenfabrik AB and FFV Carl-Gustaf in Eskilstuna), Thailand, Turkey (MKEK) and the United Kingdom (Royal Ordnance).

The Bundeswehr was working on improving their G3 rifles in the 1990s with a brass deflector that deflects spent cartridge cases down and frontwards from the operator and a new polymer pistol-grip/fire-control assembly module that allows better ambidextrous operation of the safety lever when they had their G3 rifles replaced for the Heckler &amp; Koch G36. Currently (2018) hundreds of thousands of G3A3A1, G3A4A1 and G3KA4A1 modernized variants rifles are maintained by Bundeswehr personnel and kept in reserve or are available in military base small arms storages. The Iranian version remains in production as of 2024.

==Design details==
===Operating mechanism===


The G3 is a selective-fire automatic weapon that employs a roller-delayed blowback operating system. The two-piece bolt assembly consists of a breech (bolt head) and bolt carrier. The bolt is held in battery by two sliding cylindrical rollers that engage locking recesses in the barrel extension. The breech is opened when both rollers are compressed inward against camming surfaces driven by the rearward pressure of the expanding gases upon the bolt head. As the rollers move inward, recoil energy is transferred to the locking piece and bolt carrier which begin to withdraw while the bolt head slowly moves rearward in relation to the bolt carrier. As the bolt carrier clears the rollers, pressure in the bore drops to a safe level, the bolt head is caught by the bolt carrier and moves to the rear as one unit, continuing the operating cycle.

Based on the geometric relationship arising from the angles of the roller contact surfaces of the locking piece and the barrel extension recesses, the recoil of the bolt head is delayed by a ratio of 4:1 for the 7.62×51mm NATO chambering. Thus during the same period of time, the bolt head carrier moves 4 times faster than the bolt head. This ratio is continued until the locking rollers have been withdrawn from the barrel extension recesses.

The bolt features an anti-bounce mechanism that prevents the bolt from bouncing off the barrel&#x27;s breech surface. The &quot;bolt head locking lever&quot; is a spring-loaded claw mounted on the bolt carrier that grabs the bolt head as the bolt carrier group goes into battery. The lever essentially ratchets into place with friction, providing enough resistance to being re-opened that the bolt carrier does not rebound. The spring-powered claw extractor is also contained inside the bolt while the lever ejector is located inside the trigger housing (actuated by the recoiling bolt).

The chamber has longitudinal gas relief flutes cut in the chamber wall to ease the cartridge case&#x27;s extraction upon firing. These flutes allow propellant gas to flow between the case and chamber wall, equalizing the pressure between the inner and outer surfaces of the front of the cartridge case. The intentional propellant gas ingress at the gas relief flutes significantly reduces case friction against the chamber wall, making extraction more reliable by preventing the cartridge case from sticking and tearing.

The reliable functioning of roller-delayed blowback mechanisms is limited by specific ammunition and arm parameters like bullet weight, propellant charge, barrel length and amount of wear. For obtaining a proper and safe functioning parameters bandwidth Heckler &amp; Koch offer a variety of locking pieces with different mass and shoulder angles. The angles are critical and determine the unlock timing and pressure curve progression as the locking pieces act in unison with the bolt head carrier.

===Features===


The G3 is a modular weapon system. Its butt-stock, fore-stock and pistol-grip/fire-control assembly may be changed at will in a variety of configurations (listed below). Simple push-pins hold the components in place and removing them will allow the user to remove and replace parts rapidly.
The weapon made extensive use of cost-saving pressed and stamped steel components rather than machined parts and spot welding to connect parts. The stamped sheet metal cocking handle tube and receiver are large exposed parts that are prone to deformation from hard impact as they were designed to be relatively thin to save weight. If dented severely or deep enough during field service, reliability problems due to internal parts movement impairments can occur that put the rifle out of action and can not be field solved by the user. To determine and correct such situations armorers are trained to employ specially designed &quot;GO&quot; and symmetry gauges and straightening mandrels to fairly quickly repair such problems.

====Trigger====
The rifle is hammer fired and has a trigger mechanism with a 3-position fire selector switch that is also the manual safety toggle that secures the weapon from accidentally discharging (fire selector in the &quot;E&quot; or &quot;1&quot; position – single fire mode (&quot;Einzelfeuer&quot;), &quot;F&quot; or &quot;20&quot; – automatic fire (&quot;Feuerstoß&quot;), &quot;S&quot; or &quot;0&quot; – weapon is safe (&quot;Sicher&quot;), trigger disabled mechanically). The weapon can be fitted with an optional four-position safety/fire selector group illustrated with pictograms with an ambidextrous selector lever. The additional, fourth selector setting enables a three-round burst mode of fire. The rifle has a relatively high trigger pull of due to a drop safety requirement. An interchangeable set-trigger pack assembly featuring a trigger stop and less trigger pull is available for the G3SG/1 and other sniping orientated variants.

====Sights====
The original G3 and G3A1 rifle variants had a relatively low iron sight line that consisted of a &quot;Klappvisier,&quot; an &quot;L-type&quot; flip up rear sight and hooded front post.
From the G3A2 variant the firearm is equipped with a relatively low iron sight line that consists of a &quot;Drehvisier&quot; a rotary rear drum and hooded front post. The rear sight is mechanically adjustable for both windage and elevation with the help of tools. This deliberately prevents non-armorers to (re)zero the iron sight line. The rotary drum features an open V-notch (numbered 1) for rapid target acquisition, close range, low light and impaired visibility use and three apertures (numbered 2, 3 and 4) used for: in increments for more precise aiming. The 1 V-notch and 2 or aperture settings have an identical point of aim. The V-notch and apertures are calibrated for US M80 / German DM111 series or other equivalent 7.62×51mm NATO ball ammunition. The receiver housing has recesses that work with STANAG claw mounts/HK clamp adapters used to mount day or night aiming optics.

====Barrel====
The rifled barrel – four right-hand grooves with a twist rate to adequately stabilize the military 7.62×51mm NATO ammunition of the era – terminates with a slotted flash suppressor which can also be used to attach a bayonet or serve as an adapter for launching rifle grenades. From the G3A3 the barrel was free floated from the stock and had polygonal rifling. The barrel chamber is fluted with twelve flutes, which assists in the initial extraction of a spent cartridge casing (since the breech is opened under very high barrel in internal cartridge case pressure).

====Feeding====
The G3A3 (A4) uses either steel (260 g) or aluminium (140 g) 20-round double-stacked straight box magazines, or a 50-round drum magazine. H&amp;K developed a prototype plastic disposable magazine in the early 1960s, but it was not adopted as aluminum magazines were just as light and proved more durable, as well as easier to produce.

====Accessories====
Standard accessories supplied with the rifle include: a detachable bipod (not included with rifles that have a perforated plastic handguard), sling, cleaning kit and a speed-loading device. Several types of bayonet are available for the G3, but with few exceptions they require an adapter to be inserted into the end of the cocking tube. The most common type features a 6 inch spear-point blade nearly identical with the M7 bayonet, but with a different grip because of its mounting above the barrel. The weapon can also mount a 40 mm HK79 under-barrel grenade launcher, blank firing adapter, a straight blowback bolt (called a &quot;PT&quot; bolt, lacks rollers) used for firing 7.62×51mm ammunition with plastic bullets, a conversion kit used for training with .22 Long Rifle ammunition and a sound suppressor (that uses standard ammunition).

==Variants==

The G3 served as a basis for many other weapons, among them: the PSG1 and MSG90 precision rifles, the HK11 and HK21 family of light machine guns, a semi-automatic version known as the HK41, a &quot;sporterized&quot; model called the SR9 (designed for the civilian market in countries where the HK91 would not qualify, primarily the US after the 1989 importation restrictions) and the MC51 carbine.
* G3: Original model based on the CETME Model 58 introduced in 1959 and approved in 1960. It had a wooden stock and handguard.
* G3A1: G3 approved in 1963 with a single-position, retractable stock sliding in grooves pressed in the sides of the body, locked by a catch under the special bodycap. This design was chosen after earlier experimentation with an MP-40 style ventrally-folding metal stock; excessive recoil caused it to be dropped from consideration.
* G3A2: G3 developed in 1962 with new rotating drum rear sight and a &quot;Freischwinger&quot; (FS) free-floating barrel that significantly improved accuracy.
* G3A3: The most well known 1963 version. Drum sights with an improved front sight, a flash-suppressor/muzzle brake capable of firing NATO standard grenades, a fixed solid plastic buttstock, and a plastic handguard that does not contact the free-floating barrel. The handguard came in a slim, ventilated version and a wide version. The latter allows for the attachment of a bipod.
* G3A3A1: This is a version of the G3A3 with an ambidextrous trigger group and brass deflector. This is an official German Army designation, not an HK factory one.
* G3A4: The G3A4 uses drum sights and a single position, retractable stock. Entered service in 1974 for frontline infantry units.
* G3A4A1: This is a variant of the G3A4 with an ambidextrous trigger group and brass deflector. This is an official German Army designation, not an HK factory one.
* G3KA4: Smallest of the line, it is a &quot;Karabiner&quot;, or carbine version of the G3. It uses an HK33 handguard, features drum sights, a retractable stock, and a barrel (reduced in length to the base of the front sight post), that is too short for use with a bayonet or rifle grenades.
* G3KA4A1: Variant of the G3KA4 with a polymer grip assembly, ambidextrous trigger group and brass deflector. This is an official German Army designation, not an HK factory one.

===Models made under license===
The G3 rifle is or was produced under license in the following countries: Pakistan, Brazil, Iran, France, Greece, Norway, Mexico, Myanmar, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Sweden and Turkey.

The Pakistani manufacturer, Pakistan Ordnance Factories (POF) uses the same model number for both automatic versions as well as versions of different manufacturing that are made as semi automatic for the civilian market. POF&#x27;s definition of the civilian versions are &quot;Semi Auto Irreversible&quot;.

* G3A3: Model number for Pakistani-made version of G3A3, manufactured in two different versions; automatic or semi automatic. 
* G3P4: Model number for Pakistani-made version of G3A4, manufactured in two different versions; automatic or semi automatic.
* G3A5: HK assigned model number for the HK-made Danish version of the G3A3. It differs in that it has a silent bolt-closure device. In Danish service it is known as the Gv M/66. The Gv M/66 was originally intended for use with optics as a designated marksman rifle, while the rest of the squad were issued M1 Garands.
* G3A6: HK assigned model number for the Iranian-made version of the G3A3. It differs in having a dark-green handguard, stock, and trigger pack.
* G3A7: HK assigned model number for the Turkish-made version of the G3A3.
* G3A7A1: HK assigned model number for the Turkish-made version of the G3A4.
* HSG1: HK assigned model number for the Luxembourg-made version of the G3A3.
* BA63: Model number for Myanmar-made version of original G3 (with wooden stock, handguard and flip sight) 

===Other military variants and derivatives===
====Denmark====
* Gv M/75: Variant leased from the German Bundeswehr / German government by the Danish government to replace the aging M1 Garands. Originally manufactured by either Rheinmetall or HK for the German Bundeswehr. The Gv M/75 rifles are basically G3s with the old style straight cocking tube as opposed to the later FS (&quot;Freischwinger&quot;, &quot;Cantilevered&quot;) variant. The Rheinmetall versions lack an external selector lever and can be converted from semi-automatic to full automatic (or vice versa) by the use of a special tool.

====Myanmar====
* BA63 (Burma Army): Licensed produced G3 by Myanmar stated owned KaPaSa factories in partnership with Fritz Werner Industry Ausrustungen-Gmbh (FRG) and the German Technical Corporation Agency with licensing rights sold by 1960 with the first 10,000 G3s bought from West Germany (through Rheinmetall) before Burmese factories went operational due to fears that it could align with East Germany. It was the main battle rifle for Myanmar armed forces until they were replaced by MA series 5.56mm assault rifles in 1995. The BA63 is still in service with Myanmar Police Force, People&#x27;s Militia and ethnic Border Guard Forces.
* BA64: Typically known as the G4 in Myanmar armed forces, this is the heavy barreled light machine gun (LMG) version of standard G3A3 with bipod, carrying handle and full metal hand-guard with ventilation ports. Produced by KaPaSa factories in partnership with Fritz Werner Industry Ausrustungen-Gmbh (FRG). As standard, a pair of G4s were issued to every infantry section in the Myanmar Army. It has now been phased out from in favour of the MA series light machine guns. The BA64 remained in service with Myanmar Police Force, People&#x27;s Militia and ethnic Border Guard Forces.
* BA72: Typically known as G2 in Myanmar. Assault carbine version of G3A4/G3K with shorter barrel and wooden stock.
* BA100: A copy of the G3A3ZF sniper rifle.

====Norway====
* AG-3: Norwegian G3A5 variant produced by Kongsberg Våpenfabrikk, with the given name &quot;Automatgevær 3&quot;. A total of 253,497 units were produced for the Norwegian Armed Forces from 1967 to 1974. The Norwegian AG-3 differs from the original G3; it has a buttstock that is approx. 2 cm longer, the bolt carrier has a serrated thumb groove to aid in silent bolt closure, it features an all-metal cocking handle and a different bayonet mount. Throughout Autumn 2020, the Norwegian home guard began to replace the AG-3 with the Heckler &amp; Koch HK416 and MP7, a transition which is planned to see completion by the end of the year.
* AG-3F1: An AG-3 with a retractable stock as on G3A4. Produced by Kongsberg Våpenfabrikk. A retractable stock was required by certain groups of soldiers within the Norwegian Armed Forces, primarily vehicle crews with limited space inside, particularly where a quick disembarkment from such a vehicle is required. All versions of the AG-3 have the ability to attach a 40 mm HK79 grenade launcher.
* AG-3F2: An improvement of the AG-3F1, featuring B&amp;T Picatinny rails on the receiver, as well as a RIS handguard. On the AG-3F2, Aimpoint red dot sights were mounted onto the receiver top rail for faster quick acquisition, and easier aiming in low-light conditions.
==== Portugal ====
*m/963 The HK G3 was selected to equip the Portuguese Armed Forces as the new service rifle. Fábrica de Braço de Prata started in 1962 to manufacture under licence the G3, including the manufacture of its components and parts and its final assembly. Later, West Germany placed an order for 50,000 Portuguese-made G3 rifles for its own armed forces.

====Sweden====
* Ak 4: Swedish-made version of the G3A3, with a buttstock that is 2 cm longer, the bolt carrier has a serrated thumb groove to aid in silent bolt closure and fitted with a heavy buffer for higher number of rounds fired before failure. The iron sights feature extended sight adjustments in increments, because the hit probability met Swedish military doctrine. The rifles were manufactured from 1965 to 1970 by both Carl Gustafs stads gevärsfaktori and Husqvarna Vapenfabriks and from 1970 until the end of production in 1985 – exclusively by Carl Gustaf in Eskilstuna. All Ak 4s are adapted to mount the M203 grenade launcher. Sweden has supplied unmodified Ak 4s to Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
* Ak 4OR: Optiskt Riktmedel, optical sight. This model is fitted with a Hensoldt 4×24 telescopic sight mounted via a HK claw mount. During a few years it was not issued but it is now again in use by the &quot;Hemvärnet - Nationella skyddsstyrkorna&quot; (&quot;Swedish Home Guard&quot;).
* Ak 4B: In this updated version the iron sights have been removed and replaced with an Aimpoint CS red-dot reflex sight mounted on a Picatinny rail. The rail is welded onto the rifle. Used by &quot;Hemvärnet - Nationella skyddsstyrkorna&quot; (&quot;Swedish Home Guard&quot;).
* Ak 4C: An updated version of the Ak 4B with an adjustable-length stock designed and manufactured by the Swedish company Spuhr i Dalby AB. Fielded in 2017 and used by &quot;Hemvärnet - Nationella skyddsstyrkorna&quot; (&quot;Swedish Home Guard&quot;).
* Ak 4D: An updated version of the Ak 4B with the adjustable-length stock of the Ak 4C but with the addition of a modular handguard (also designed and manufactured by the Swedish company Spuhr i Dalby AB) and the Hensoldt 4×24 telescopic sight of the Ak 4OR in a Picatinny mount. The Ak 4D will be used by the Swedish Army as a stop-gap DMR.

====Iran====
* DIO G3-A3 Bullpup: Iranian bullpup variant of the G3.

====Pakistan====

The Pakistani models are manufactured in both automatic and civilian semi automatic versions sharing the same model number.
* G3A3: Pakistan Ordnance Factories designation for license-produced G3A3 rifles. Manufactured in two different versions; automatic or semi automatic.
* G3P4: Pakistan Ordnance Factories designation for license-produced G3A4 rifles. Manufactured in two different versions; automatic or semi automatic.
* G3S: A version of G3P3 with a shorter barrel. Manufactured in two different versions; automatic or semi automatic.
* G3M-Tactical: A light weight version of G3 rifle with polymer body and shorter barrel. Manufactured in two different versions; automatic or semi automatic.
* AZB (DMR): A high precision version of G3 rifle with extended barrel length and mill std. picatinny rail as rifle scope mount. Manufactured in two different versions; automatic or semi automatic.

====United Kingdom====
* F.R. Ordnance MC51 Machine Carbine: Produced by the United Kingdom firm F.R. Ordnance International Ltd. The MC51 weighs , has a folded overall length of , a barrel length of only , which produces a muzzle velocity of approx. and a muzzle energy of 2215 J. Another UK-based company called Imperial Defence Services Ltd. absorbed FR Ordnance and continues to market the MC51 standard variant.

===Specialized G3 types===


* G3TGS: This is simply a G3 with a 40 mm HK79 under-barrel grenade launcher. TGS stands for &quot;Tragbares Granat System &quot; (&quot;portable grenade system&quot;).
* G3A3ZF: This is a rifle issued with a STANAG claw-and rail scope bracket and a Hensoldt Fero Z24 4×24 telescopic sight to be mounted and zeroed by the user. The ZF stands for &quot;Zielfernrohr&quot; (&quot;Telescopic Sight&quot;). The Hensoldt Fero Z24 4×24 telescope sight for G3 rifle and claw mount assembly were developed for designated marksman use. The Fero Z24 elevation knob features Bullet Drop Compensation (BDC) settings for in increments calibrated for 7.62×51mm NATO ball ammunition. The G3A3ZF is otherwise a standard G3A3 that during factory test shooting printed a 5-shot group of (0.8 mil/2.75 MOA) diameter or less.
* G3SG/1: A modified/accurized rifle for sharpshooter/sniper use introduced in 1972. The &quot;SG&quot; stands for &quot;Scharfschützengewehr&quot; (&quot;Sharpshooting Rifle&quot;). The rifles were individually selected from the G3 production line for outstanding accuracy during test-firing and then modified. G3SG/1 rifles got a heavy, dual-stage buffer, fixed mounted, Zeiss Diavari-DA 1.5-6×36 power telescopic sight and STANAG claw mount assembly mounted. The standard trigger was exchanged for an adjustable set-trigger pack assembly with a trigger pull and in the set operation mode, the buttstock has a slightly adjustable auxiliary cheek riser, and the lengthened handguard has an integrated bipod. The Zeiss Diavari-DA 1.5-6×36 was windage adjustable and had an elevation knob featuring Bullet Drop Compensation (BDC) settings for . For the sub ranges the BDC numbers are yellow. The BDC numbers for the longer ranges are white and in increments. The automatic fire mode was retained but the set-trigger mode could only be used for semi-automatic firing.
* MSG3: A variant introduced in 1988 featuring a long barrel, a newer telescopic sight mount that is found on only a few of the Heckler &amp; Koch rifles, as compared to the more conventional claw mounts, though the claw mounting points remain on the receiver. This newer telescopic sight mount does not allow the use of the open sights with the mount in place, as is the case with the more conventional claw mount. The receiver is not strengthened. In addition to the G3SG/1 the buttstock has an auxiliary cheek riser and its length is adjustable and features the PSG1 semi-automatic only trigger pack. MSG stands for &quot;Militärisches Scharfschützen Gewehr&quot; (&quot;Military Sniper Rifle&quot;).
* MSG90: A somewhat cheaper and lighter long barrel version of the PSG1 modified for military sniping/designated marksman applications. The MSG90 and PSG1 have different trigger packs.
* PSG1: A free-floating long barrel semi-automatic only version of the G3 introduced in 1985 with a strengthened receiver with rails welded over the channels where a retractable buttstock would slide and numerous other upgrades and such to meet the necessities of police sniper units. This rifle is famous for its accuracy and comfort, but infamous for its price and inability to be deployed by military units because some upgrades made the rifle too fragile. PSG stands for &quot;Präzisionsscharfschützengewehr&quot; (&quot;Precision Sniper Rifle&quot;).
* HK32: An experimental variant of the rifle chambered for the Soviet 7.62×39mm M43 cartridge. It was never wholly adopted by any country.

===Law enforcement and civilian models===

* G3A1*: The terminology used by custom gunsmiths (e.g., Choate) and importers (e.g., Interarms) for imported semi-automatic G3 weapons with an aftermarket side-folding stock. This is not part of official HK nomenclature.
* HK41: The HK41 is a semi-automatic version of the G3 that was marketed to law-enforcement. Limited sales at home and US import restrictions and firearms regulations led this weapon to be dropped from HK&#x27;s product line quickly and it was replaced by the HK91.
* Fleming Arms HK51: Contrary to popular belief, the HK51 is not made by H&amp;K, being a creation of the American Class II manufacturing after-market. The HK51 has no real standards, but is usually a cut down and modified G3A3, or its semi-automatic clones the HK41 and HK91, modified to take MP5 stock and accessories. It is usually fitted with a collapsible stock; with a 211 mm (8.31-inch) long barrel; it is relatively small at 589 mm (23.17 inches) with the stock retracted and 780 mm (30.72 inches) with the stock extended. The first commercial version was by Bill Fleming of Fleming Arms and existed before Heckler &amp; Koch made the HK53.
* HK91: The HK91 is a semi-automatic version of the G3 similar to the HK41, also marketed to civilians. However, in order to comply with US firearm regulations a number of modifications to the HK91 were made that do not appear on the first pattern HK41. Internal parts that could allow fully automatic fire were removed. A shelf was welded onto the receiver where the push-pin of the trigger pack would normally go, to prevent installation of a fully automatic trigger pack. This did not allow the use of the paddle style magazine release and so the magazine release button on the right side of the magazine well must be used instead. It is otherwise identical to the G3A3/A4. Importation into the United States began in 1974 and ceased in 1989, with some 48,000 rifles being imported.
* HK911: The HK911 was an HK91A2 with the flash hider removed and the receiver re-stamped with an extra 1 to comply with the US importation ban of 1989. The new designation theoretically made it legally immune to the Import Ban, as no &quot;HK911&quot; rifles were mentioned on the list of banned guns. However, the later banning of several &quot;paramilitary&quot; features on the HK911 made it illegal.
* SR9: These variants of the HK91ZF were created to comply with the Semi-Auto Import Ban of 1989, which included all variants of the HK91. They differed from the HK91 in that they had their flash hiders removed and featured a smooth forend that lacked the bipod attachment point. The SR9 series were banned from importation to the United States because they could accept standard-capacity magazines. The SR9 was an HK91A2ZF with the pistol grip and buttstock replaced with a one-piece thumbhole stock.
** SR9 (T): The (T), or &quot;Target&quot;, model was an HK91A2ZF with the trigger replaced with the PSG-1 model, the pistol grip replaced with an ergonomic PSG-1 grip and the buttstock replaced with an MSG90 model.
** SR9 (TC): The (TC), or &quot;Target Competition&quot;, model was an HK91A2ZF with the trigger group, pistol grip and buttstock derived from the PSG-1.

====Other manufacturers====
* PTR Industries 91 Series: PTR Industries is manufacturing semi-automatic copies of the HK G3 called the PTR 91. They use tooling from the FMP arms factory in Portugal to build the rifles.
* Century International Arms: Century Arms builds a clone of the CETME C (similar to a G3) under the designation C308.
* SAR-3: Semi-automatic copy of the HK-91 made by Hellenic Defence Systems in Greece and imported into the United States by Springfield Armory.
** SAR-8: Post-ban version of SAR-3, modified with a thumbhole stock and shipped with 10-round magazines to comply with import restrictions.
* Schwaben Arms: Civilian clones for the German market called M41.
* MKE: MKEK made a clone known as the T41.
* LuxDefTec: Luxembourgish clones of the G3 designated HSG41.

===Former===

* : Originally in 1975, Heckler and Koch sold to Indumil the manufacturing license for the G3, the MP5 submachine gun, and the HK21 machine gun. Replaced in service by IMI Galil.
* : G3A5, as the &quot;Gevær Model 1966&quot; (Gv M/66). Another variant, designated &quot;Gevær Model 1975&quot; (Gv M/75) was leased from the German government. All G3s in Danish service are being replaced by the Diemaco C7 (Gv m/95), and Diemaco C8 (Gv m/96).
* : Turkish made G3s used by Special Forces.
* : G3A3 and A4 versions. The G3 was the standard-issued rifle of the Portuguese Army from 1963 to 2020, manufactured under license by Fábrica de Braço de Prata before it shut down. In 2019, it was replaced by FN SCAR L rifles. 
* : Portuguese built G3s were used by auxiliary or reserve units of the Rhodesian Security Forces
* : 100,000 FMP-manufactured surplus G3 rifles were bought from Portugal and designated the R2 Rifle. It was the standard-issue rifle of the South African Marine Corps and South African Air Force, as well within the South West African Territorial Force as a substitute for the R1 Rifle (FN FAL) until it was replaced by the R4 assault rifle in the 1980s The rifle&#x27;s stock would soon break down in the heat and become loose, so a replacement stock made of a tough polymer was made by Choate Machine &amp; Tool. The forend had recesses for a bipod&#x27;s legs and the FAL-style polymer buttstock had a rubber buttplate.

<text>In Japanese Buddhism, mikkyō (密教, from &quot;himitsu bukkyō&quot;, literally &quot;secret Buddhism&quot;) or Japanese Esoteric Buddhism, is the lineage of Vajrayana transmitted to Japan, primarily in the early Heian by Kūkai, and to a later extent by Saichō and his successors such as Ennin. It consists of complex systems of icons, meditative rituals, and ritual languages; distinct from the exoteric (, 顕経) schools.

Mikkyō is descended most recently from the Chinese Tangmi tradition, especially the dual mandala system taught by Huiguo, itself derived from Indo-Chinese tantric masters such as Amoghavajra. Shingon focuses almost exclusively on esotericism, while Tendai views exoteric and esoteric doctrines as complementary. Shugendo is a syncretic tradition which integrates mikkyō with Shintō and Taoist practices. Esoteric practices are diffused throughout the Japanese Buddhist tradition in various forms outside of these schools.

Mikkyō has been influential in Japanese culture and history, shifting aristocratic court culture away from the Confucian &quot;ritsuryō&quot; political structure, and contributing to the development of Japanese literature through &quot;waka&quot; and the development of the &quot;kana&quot; syllabary.

== History ==
In older Chinese literature, the term &quot;esoteric&quot; is used rhetorically to &quot;designate what this or that writer feels is superior or best in the tradition.&quot; Aaron Proffitt argues that &quot;&#x27;Esoteric Buddhism&#x27; can be taken as a synonym for Mahayana Buddhism itself&quot; in particular contexts, where it takes a polemical rather than descriptive function. The &quot;esoteric&quot; appellation was applied Mahayana to distinguish it from other vehicles as early as the 5th century. The &quot;Dà zhìdù lùn&quot; (&quot;Treatise on the Great Perfection of Wisdom&quot;) distinguishes between esoteric (&quot;mimi&quot;, 祕密) and exoteric (&quot;xianshi&quot;, 顯示) Buddhadharma:
In the exoteric [form], the Buddha, , and are all fields of merit since their defilements have been exhausted without residue. In the esoteric [form], it is explained that bodhisattvas attain the acquiescence to the nonproduction of the dharmas...
In the 9th century Kūkai introduced his own esoteric-exoteric taxonomy, theorizing the esoteric as always-already present in the exoteric teachings, while simultaneously the consummation and highest form of those teachings. He similarly presents Shingon as &quot;vajrayana of secrecy&quot;, separate from both the Mahayana and Hinayana teachings. Kūkai used a number of other terms for his lineage, such as the &quot;mantra treasury&quot; and , literally &quot;vajra vehicle&quot;. Taimitsu (台密) and Tōmitsu refer to the esoteric lineages of Tendai and Shingon respectively. Historically, &quot;shingon&quot; was largely interchangeable with mikkyō; sources often refer to Tendai esotericism as &quot;the shingon of the Tendai lineages.&quot; 

Elements such as mantra, dharani, and various esoteric texts were already present in Japan before Kūkai. Dōshō, Dōji, Simsang, Kaimei, and other clerics introduced esoteric sutras to Japan before the Heian era. Ōya Tokujō used the term &quot;nanmitsu&quot; (南密) to refer to this Nara-period esotericism.In the 17th century, sectarian scholars began distinguishing between zomitsu and junmitsu, or &quot;miscellaneous esotericism&quot; and &quot;pure esotericism&quot; respectively, to describe the disparate, diffused esoteric elements versus the highly-structured approach of the Shingon and Tendai schools. This distinction was introduced by the Tokugawa priest Ekō (1666-1734). Ryūichi Abe is critical of this taxonomy, noting that Kūkai himself imported various zomitsu scriptures, while the junmistu Vairocanābhisaṃbodhi Sūtra, understood as the primary source of Kūkai&#x27;s school, was already circulating in Japan before Kūkai&#x27;s first travels to China.

== Theory and practice ==
Scholarly approaches to mikkyō often stress the attainment of Buddhahood &quot;in this very body&quot; (&quot;sokushin jōbutsu&quot;, 即身成佛), or within one&#x27;s lifetime. This is achieved through the practice of the &quot;Three Mysteries&quot; (&quot;sanmi&quot;, 三密) of mudra, mantra, and mandala. These correspond to body, speech, and mind respectively. The Three Mysteries &quot;awaken beings to the true nature of reality&quot; which is constituted by the identity of all things with Mahāvairocana. This is a &quot;process of mutual interpenetration&quot; referred to as &quot;nyū ga gan yū&quot; (入我我入, &quot;entering me, me entering&quot;).

=== Dual-mandala system ===
Kūkai introduced the integrated practice of the &quot;Womb realm mandala&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;Mahākaruṇā-garbhodbhava-maṇḍala&quot;, 胎藏界曼荼羅) and the &quot;Vajra realm mandala&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;Vajradhātu-maṇḍala&quot;, 金剛界曼荼羅) to Japan from Huiguo. These mandalas correspond, respectively, to the &quot;Mahāvairocana&quot; and the &quot;Vajraśekhara&quot; sutras.

=== Abhiṣeka ===
Abhiṣeka (&quot;kanjō&quot;) is a &quot;ritual of passage&quot; which initiates a student into esoteric practice, based on classical and medieval coronation rites.

=== Goma ===

=== Ajikan ===
&quot;Ajikan&quot; () is a form of ritual meditation on the Siddham syllable &quot;A&quot;, the seed syllable (Skt. &quot;bīja mantra&quot;) for Vairocana. Kukai&#x27;s &quot;Precious Key to the Secret Treasury&quot; gives a brief overview of the practice:
Visualize: a white lotus flower with eight petals,
[above which is a full moon disc] the size of a forearm in diameter,
[in which is] a radiant silvery letter A.
Unite your dhyāna with prajñā in an adamantine binding;
Draw the quiescent prajñā of the tathāgata [into your
mind].
== Influence ==
Mikkyō &quot;functioned as a practical technology that had a direct bearing on medieval politics and economy&quot;. Fabio Rambelli interprets mikkyō &quot;as an ensemble of knowledge [...] implemented through interpretive strategies, repertoires of metaphors, and a general structuring of knowledge.&quot;

Buddhism justified writing in the Japanese language, whereas earlier periods favored Classical Chinese. Medieval Mikkyō understood native Japanese poetry as sacred literature analogous to mantras, and many prominent waka poets, such as Henjō and Saigyō, were Esoteric Buddhist clergy. Kūkai is traditionally attributed with the invention of the syllabary and composing the . Ton&#x27;a relates a legend (among many circulating in medieval Japan) that Kūkai developed the kana to facilitate the work of carpenters who were building the stupa at Mount Koya. While certainly apocryphal, &quot;the systematic importation of Sanskrit...encouraged the emergence of the native script of kana characters&quot;, the derivation of the gojūon from siddhaṃ &quot;point[s] to the reason underlying the belief widespread in the medieval period that Kūkai was the inventor of the kana syllabary.&quot;

<text>The Adirondack Park is a park in northeastern New York protecting the Adirondack Mountains. The park was established in 1892 for &quot;the free use of all the people for their health and pleasure&quot;, and for watershed protection. At , it is the largest park in the contiguous United States. 

Notable among parks in the United States, about 52 percent of the land is privately owned inholdings. The remaining 48 percent is publicly owned by the state as part of the Forest Preserve. Use of public and private lands in the park is regulated by the Adirondack Park Agency.

The Adirondack Park contains 46 High Peaks, 2,800 lakes and ponds, of rivers and streams, and an estimated of old-growth forests. It is home to 105 towns and villages, as well as numerous farms, businesses, and a timber-harvesting industry. The park has a population of 130,000 permanent and 200,000 seasonal residents, and sees over 12.4 million annual visitors. The inclusion of human communities makes the park one of the most successful experiments in conserving previously developed lands in the industrialized world.

The Adirondack Forest Preserve was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1963.

==History==

===Early tourism===

Before the 19th century, the wilderness was viewed as desolate and forbidding. As Romanticism developed in the United States, the view of wilderness became more positive, as seen in the writings of James Fenimore Cooper, John Muir, Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson.

The 1849 publication of Joel Tyler Headley&#x27;s &quot;Adirondack; or, Life in the Woods&quot; triggered the development of hotels and stage coach lines. William Henry Harrison Murray&#x27;s 1869 wilderness guidebook depicted the area as a place of relaxation and pleasure rather than a natural obstacle.

Financier and railroad promoter Thomas Clark Durant acquired a large tract of central Adirondack land and built a railroad from Saratoga Springs to North Creek. By 1875, there were more than two hundred hotels in the Adirondacks including Paul Smith&#x27;s Hotel. About this time, the Great Camps were developed.

===Moves to protect New York&#x27;s water supply===
Following the Civil War, Reconstruction Era economic expansion led to an increase in logging and deforestation, especially in the southern Adirondacks.

In 1870 Verplanck Colvin made the first recorded ascent of Seward Mountain during which he saw the extensive damage done by lumbermen. He wrote a report which was read at the Albany Institute and printed by the New York State Museum of Natural History. In 1872 he was named to the newly created post of Superintendent of the Adirondack Survey and given a $1000 budget by the state legislature to institute a survey of the Adirondacks.

In 1873 he wrote a report arguing that if the Adirondack watershed was allowed to deteriorate, it would threaten the viability of the Erie Canal, which was then vital to New York&#x27;s economy. He was subsequently appointed superintendent of the New York state land survey. In 1873, he recommended the creation of a state forest preserve covering the entire Adirondack region.

===Article XIV: forever wild===

In 1884, a state legislative commission chaired by botanist Charles Sprague Sargent recommended establishment of a forest preserve, to be &quot;forever kept as wild forest lands.&quot; The New York State Legislature subsequently passed a law in 1885 
for the preservation of forests which designated all state lands within certain counties in the Adirondacks and Catskills as Forest Preserve to be forever kept as wild forest lands. This forestry law also established a Forest Commission which was charged with care, custody, control and superintendence of the Forest Preserve.

In 1894, Article VII, Section 7, (renumbered in 1938 as Article XIV, Section 1) of the New York State Constitution was adopted, which reads in part:

The lands of the state, now owned or hereafter acquired, constituting the forest preserve as now fixed by law, shall be forever kept as wild forest lands. They shall not be leased, sold or exchanged, or be taken by any corporation, public or private, nor shall the timber thereon be sold, removed or destroyed.

In 1902, the legislature passed a bill defining the Adirondack Park for the first time in terms of the counties and towns within it. In 1912 the legislature further clarified that the park included the privately owned lands within it as well as the public holdings.

The restrictions on development and lumbering embodied in Article XIV have withstood many challenges from timber interests, hydropower projects and large-scale tourism development interests. Further, the language of the article, and decades of legal experience in its defense, are widely recognized as having laid the foundation for the U.S. National Wilderness Act of 1964. As a result of the legal protections, many pieces of the original forest of the Adirondacks have never been logged and are old-growth forest.

===20th-century development===

Early in the 1900s, recreational use increased dramatically. The State Conservation Department (now the DEC) responded by building more facilities: boat docks, tent platforms, lean-tos, and telephone and electrical lines. With the building of Interstate 87 in the 1960s, private lands came under great pressure for development. This growing crisis led to the 1971 creation of the Adirondack Park Agency (APA) to develop long-range land-use plans for both the public and private lands within the Blue Line.

In consultation with the DEC, the APA formulated the State Land Master Plan which was adopted into law in 1973. The plan is designed to channel much of the future growth in the Park around existing communities, where roads, utilities, services, and supplies already exist.

In 2008 The Nature Conservancy purchased Follensby Pond – about of private land inside the park boundary – for $16 million. The group plans to sell the land to the state, which will add it to the forest preserve once the remaining leases for recreational hunting and fishing on the property expire.

===Comparison of the Park in 1900 and 2000===
Data compiled by the Adirondack Experience, Blue Mountain Lake, New York

==Park management==

The park is managed by two state agencies; the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, created in 1970 and headquartered in Albany; and the Adirondack Park Agency, created in 1971 and headquartered in Ray Brook. Noted forest ranger Clarence Petty sat on the commission that recommend the creation of the APA. This system of management is distinctly different from New York&#x27;s state park system, which is managed by the Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation. According to the State Land Master Plan, state lands are classified.

The Adirondack Park Land Use and Development Plan (APLUDP) applies to private land use and development. It defines APA jurisdiction and is designed to direct and cluster development to minimize impact.

===Land use classifications===
Areas rounded to the nearest per cent. 49% of the park is privately owned, 45% state owned, and 6% is water.

==== Private land use ====
* Resource Management: 51% of private land use. Used for residential, agriculture, and forestry. Most development requires an Agency permit. Limited to an average of 15 buildings per square mile.
* Rural Use: 17%. Most uses are permitted; residential uses and reduced intensity development that preserves rural character is most suitable. Limited to an average of 75 buildings per square mile.
* Low Intensity: 9%. Most uses are permitted; residential development at a lower intensity than hamlet or moderate intensity is appropriate. Limited to an average of 200 buildings per square mile.
* Moderate Intensity: 3%. Most uses are permitted; residential development is most appropriate. Limited to an average of 500 buildings per square mile.
* Hamlet: 2%. These are the growth and service centers of the region where the APA encourages development with very limited permit requirements. Activities requiring an APA permit are: erecting buildings or structures over 40 feet high, projects involving more than 100 lots, sites or units, projects involving wetlands, airports, and watershed management projects. Hamlet boundaries usually go well beyond established settlements to provide room for future expansion. There is no limit on the average number of buildings per square mile.
* Industrial: &lt;1%. Where industry exists or has existed, and areas which may be suitable for future development. Industrial and commercial uses are also allowed in other land use area classifications. There is no limit on the average number of buildings per square mile.

==== Adirondack Park state land use ====
* Wild forest: 51% of state land use. Areas that have seen higher human impact and can thus withstand a higher level of recreational use. Often these are lands which were logged heavily in the recent past (sometimes right before being transferred to the state). Powered vehicles are allowed.
* Wilderness: 46%. These are managed like federal U.S. Wilderness Areas. Areas far more affected by nature than humanity, to the extent that the latter is practically unnoticeable, for example virgin forest. No powered vehicles are allowed in wilderness areas. Recreation is limited to passive activities such as hiking, camping, hunting, birding and angling which are themselves subject to some further restrictions to ensure that they leave no trace.
* Canoe area: &lt;1%. Lands with a wilderness character that have enough streams, lakes and ponds to provide ample opportunities for water-based recreation. The Saint Regis Canoe Area is the only such designated area in the park.
* Primitive: &lt;1%. Like wilderness, but may have structures that cannot easily be removed, or some other existing use that would complicate a wilderness designation. For most practical purposes there is no difference between a primitive area and a wilderness area.
* Intensive Use: &lt;1%. Places like state campgrounds or day use areas. The developed ski area Whiteface Mountain is in this classification.
* Historic: &lt;1%. Sites of buildings owned by the state that are significant to the history, architecture, archaeology or culture of the Adirondacks, those on the National Register of Historic Places or carrying or recommended for a similar state-level designation.
* State Administrative: &lt;1%. Applies to a limited number of DEC-owned lands that are managed for other than Forest Preserve purposes. It covers a number of facilities devoted to research, and state fish hatcheries.

==== Wilderness areas ====
State wilderness areas account for 46% of the area of the park which is not private property. They are managed like federal wilderness areas. These areas are far more affected by nature than humanity, to the extent that the latter is practically unnoticeable, for example virgin forest. No powered vehicles are allowed in wilderness areas.

* Blue Ridge Wilderness Area - 47,177 acres (185.09 km2))
* Five Ponds Wilderness Area - 107,230 acres (447.44 km2)
* Giant Mountain Wilderness Area - 23,100 acres (92.14 km2)
* Ha-De-Ron-Dah Wilderness Area - 26,600 acres (107.36 km2)
* High Peaks Wilderness Area - 275,460 acres (779.77 km2)
* Hoffman Notch Wilderness Area - 38,488 acres (146.62 km2)
* Hudson Gorge Wilderness Area - 24,477 acres (99.05 km2)
* Hurricane Mountain Wilderness Area - 13,784 acres (55.78 km2)
* Jay Mountain Wilderness Area - 7,951 acres (28.7 km2)
* McKenzie Mountain Wilderness Area - 37,616 acres (152.23 km2)
* Pepperbox Wilderness Area - 23,816 acres (91.30 km2)
* Pharaoh Lake Wilderness Area - 46,283 acres (185.68 km2)
* Pigeon Lake Wilderness Area - 50,100 acres (202.8 km2)
* Round Lake Wilderness Area - 11,430 acres (44.5 km2)
* Sentinel Range Wilderness Area - 23,874 acres (94.10 km2)
* Siamese Ponds Wilderness Area - 114,010 acres (455.37 km2)
* Silver Lake Wilderness Area - 106,770 acres (426.01 km2)
* West Canada Lake Wilderness Area - 168,920 acres (634.12 km2)
* William C. Whitney Wilderness Area - 19,500 acres (83.0 km2)

The 19,000-acre (77 km2) Saint Regis Canoe Area, presently the only Canoe Area in the park, operates under essentially the same conditions as the Wilderness Areas.

===Advocacy===
Private organizations are buying land in order to sell it back to New York State to be added to the public portion of the Park. A number of non-governmental organizations work for the park:
* The Adirondack Council, founded in 1975, is the largest citizen environmental group in New York State. Its mission is to ensure the ecological integrity and wild character of the Adirondack Park. It sponsors research, educates the public and policy makers, advocates for policies, and takes legal action when necessary to uphold constitutional protections and agency policies established to protect the Adirondacks.
* Adirondack Wild, whose goal is to uphold the &quot;forever wild&quot;, or Article 14 of the New York Constitution.
* The Wildlife Conservation Society&#x27;s Adirondack Program
* The Adirondack Chapter of the Nature Conservancy.
* The Adirondack Mountain Club has 28,000 members and has an environmental advocacy program that grew out of the need for responsible public policies to protect these lands.
* Founded in 1901, the Association for the Protection of the Adirondacks (AFPA) is the oldest non-profit advocate for the long-term protection and health of the natural and human communities of the Adirondack Park. In 2009, it merged with the Residents&#x27; Committee to Protect the Adirondacks (RCPA) and was renamed Protect the Adirondacks!
* The Adirondack Research Consortium (ARC) brings together scientists from research organizations and people who work to make the park a better place.

==Conservation==

The fur trade led to the near-extirpation of the beaver in the park by 1893. Other species, such as the moose, elk, wolf, and cougar were hunted either for their meat, for sport, or because they were seen as a threat to livestock. The historical presence in the area of animals such as the Canada lynx, wolverine, and caribou are unclear.

Reintroduction efforts for beaver began around 1904 by introducing the remaining beaver in the Adirondacks to imported Canadian ones, and later, from Yellowstone. The population quickly grew to around 2000 in roughly ten years, and around 20,000 in 1921, with the addition of beavers in different areas of the park. Although the reintroduction was marked as an ecological success, the elevated beaver population was found to have negative economic impacts on waterways and timber sources.

The introduction of elk to the Adirondacks, a species that is unclear to have ever previously occupied the region, would continue after the late-19th century. After two previously failed attempts to introduce elk, in 1903, over 150 elk were reported by the State of New York Forest, Fish, and Game Commission to have been released and surviving in the park. The elk population increased for several years, only to decline and ultimately disappear due to poaching.

To protect and maintain the elk population in the future, the DeBar Mountain Game Refuge was established within the Forest Preserve. This act of preserving the species was motivated for hunting purposes rather than an ecological or natural aspect. The Game Refuge was defined by a wire fence, numerous postings, and caretakers employed by the State. This effort to control nature was also observed in the actions of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), work crews who established access roads and water-supply expansion.

A negative result of the CCC coming to the Park was their trapping and killing of &quot;vermin&quot;, which were animals such as hawks, owls, fox, and weasels that preyed on other species sought after by hunters and fishermen. This proved to have unanticipated ecological consequences (most notably the overpopulation of deer) which were reported by the New York State Conservation Department in 1945.

Ongoing efforts have been made to reintroduce native fauna that had been lost in the park during earlier exploitation. There are 53 known species of mammals that live in the park, including raccoons, moose, black bears, coyotes, opossums, beavers, porcupines, fishers, martens, river otters, and bobcats.

Notable birds of prey that breed in the park include the red-tailed hawk, broad-winged hawk, peregrine falcon, osprey, great horned owl, barred owl, northern saw-whet owl, and turkey vulture. Other notable breeding birds include northern forest specialists like Canada jays, black-backed woodpeckers, boreal chickadees, spruce grouse, palm warblers, and yellow-bellied flycatchers.

There are more than 3,000 lakes and of streams and rivers. Many areas within the park are devoid of settlements and distant from usable roads. The park includes over of hiking trails; these trails comprise the largest trail system in the nation.

==Tourism and recreation==

An estimated 7–10 million tourists visit the park annually. There are numerous accommodations, including cabins, hunting lodges, villas and hotels, in and around Lake Placid, Lake George, Saranac Lake, Old Forge, Schroon Lake and the St. Regis Lakes. Although the climate during the winter months can be severe, with temperatures falling below , a number of sanatoriums were located there in the early twentieth century because of the positive effect the air had on tuberculosis patients.

Golf courses within the park border include the Ausable Club, the Lake Placid Club, and the Ticonderoga Country Club. Many of the Adirondack Mountains, such as Whiteface Mountain (Wilmington), Mt. Pisgah (Saranac Lake), Gore Mountain (North Creek), West Mountain (Glen&#x27;s falls), Hickory (Luzerne), and Mt. Morris (Tupper Lake) have been developed as ski areas.

Hunting and fishing are allowed in the Adirondack Park, although in many places there are strict regulations. Because of these regulations, the large tourist population has not overfished the area, and as such, the brooks, rivers, ponds and lakes are home to large trout and black bass populations. Although restricted from much of the park, snowmobile enthusiasts can ride on a large network of trails.

===Cultural===
The Adirondack Park Agency visitor interpretive centers are designed to help orient visitors to the park via educational programs, exhibits, and interpretive trails. Educational programs are available for school groups as well as the general public.

The Wild Center in Tupper Lake offers extensive exhibits about the natural history of the region, including a 1,000-foot-long series of elevated bridges that rise up over the forest on the center&#x27;s campus. Many of the exhibits are live and include native turtles, otter, birds, fish and porcupines. The center, which is open year-round, has trails to a river and pond on its campus.

The Adirondack Experience in Blue Mountain Lake contains an extensive collection about the human settlement of the Park.

The Six Nation Indian Museum in Franklin has as a mission to provide education about Iroquois (also known as Haudenosaunee) culture, particularly environmental ethics, and to reinforce traditional values and philosophies. This is done via artifacts, presentations, and hosted visits.

===Hiking and rock climbing===
The 46 highest mountains in the park, known as Adirondack High Peaks, were thought to be over when climbed by brothers Robert and George Marshall between 1918 and 1924. Surveys have since shown that four of these peaks — Blake Peak, Cliff Mountain, Nye Mountain and Couchsachraga Peak — are in fact just slightly under . Some hikers try to climb all of the original 46 peaks, and there is a Forty Sixers club for those who have done so. 

Cliffs with rock climbing and ice climbing routes are scattered throughout the park boundaries.

===Watersports===
The surface of many of the lakes lies at an elevation above ; their shores are usually rocky and irregular, and the wild scenery within their vicinity has made them very attractive to tourists. It is the site of the Adirondack Canoe Classic. Flatwater and whitewater canoeing and kayaking are very popular. Hundreds of lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams link to provide routes ranging from under to weeklong treks. Whitewater kayaking and canoeing are popular on many free-flowing rivers in the Adirondacks, particularly in the spring. Whitewater rafting trips are run in the spring on the Moose River near Old Forge. Raft trips are possible on the Hudson River near North River from April to October, due to dam releases provided by the Town of Indian Lake.

Motorboating is formally restricted on only a few bodies of water.

=== Visitor centers ===
The Adirondack Park Agency visitor interpretive centers (or VICs) were established in 1989 and 1990. The centers helped orient visitors to the park via educational programs, exhibits, and interpretive trails. Educational programs were available for school groups as well as the general public. Due to state fiscal and budgetary constraints, Governor David Paterson marked the VICs for closure on December 31, 2010, and in 2011, New York State sold both visitor centers to nearby colleges.

==== Paul Smith&#x27;s College VIC ====

The Paul Smith&#x27;s VIC opened in 1989 and in 2011 became the Paul Smith&#x27;s College VIC, owned and operated by Paul Smith&#x27;s College. Located on approximately 2,700 acres (11 km2) in Paul Smiths, New York, near Paul Smith&#x27;s College, the Paul Smith&#x27;s College Visitor Interpretive Center has approximately 25 miles of maintained trails. Throughout the property visitors will encounter every habitat type found in the Adirondack Park except alpine. Each spring the PSC VIC hosts the Great Adirondack Birding Festival. Throughout the year visitors can partake of guided interpretive walks, regular outdoor activities, naturalist-led canoe paddles on Barnum Pond, and assorted workshops and programs. In the winter the trails are open for snowshoeing and cross-country skiing.&#x27;

==== Newcomb center ====

The Adirondack Interpretive Center is situated on ESF&#x27;s Huntington Wildlife Forest, a biological field station the college has operated in Newcomb since 1932, and also home to the college&#x27;s Adirondack Ecological Center. It opened in 1990. Located on 236 acres (0.96 km2) at the outlet of Rich Lake, the center has approximately three and a half miles of interpretive trails. Habitats include lakeshore, wetlands, old growth forest, and mixed northern forest. Throughout the year staff conduct naturalist-led trail walks, guided paddles on Rich Lake, and assorted workshops and lectures. All trails are open in the winter for snowshoeing; cross-country skiing is permitted, and requires varying degrees of skill depending on trails and conditions. Management and ownership of the Newcomb center was assumed by the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry (SUNY-ESF) on July 1, 2010, with program responsibility beginning January 1, 2011.

== Development and industry ==
While the park does contain large areas of wilderness, some areas developed to a varying degree.

Census towns with more than 5,000 inhabitants include: 
* Tupper Lake 
* Ticonderoga 
* Dannemora, site of the Clinton Correctional Facility. Although most of the town, including the prison, is located inside the park boundary, the entire town is excluded from the park by statute.
* Harrietstown includes Saranac Lake and the Adirondack Regional Airport. 
* North Elba includes Lake Placid, and the Lake Placid Olympic Sports Complex.

Interstate 87 or &quot;Northway&quot;, completed in the 1970s, runs north to south through the eastern edge of the park, connecting Montreal to Upstate New York. The park is traversed by military training routes of the Air National Guard.

There are six business parks in Essex County, of which two have certified shovel ready sites. There are also two in Franklin County. There are many maple syrup producers, and their work is documented at the American Maple Museum at Croghan.

Educational institutions include the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry and Paul Smith&#x27;s College.

===Railways===
Railways were used extensively from about 1871 to the 1930s for passenger transport and freight. Passenger transport was supplemented by stagecoaches. Rail operators included Chateaugay Railroad, Adirondack Railway, Delaware and Hudson Canal Company, Lake Champlain Transportation Company, New York Central Railroad, Northern Adirondack Railroad Company, Ogdensburg and Lake Champlain Railroad, New York and Ottawa Railway, Mohawk and Malone Railway and Fulton Chain Railway.
The principal rail company to the major resorts was the New York Central Railroad. Destinations within the park, served by its &quot;Adirondack Division&quot;, included Loon Lake, Saranac Lake, Lake Placid, Santa Clara, Tupper Lake, Thendara, Old Forge, and Lake Clear. On the edge of the park boundary were Brandon and St. Regis Falls. North of the park were Moira and Malone. In 1920 there were 10 scheduled daily passenger train stops in Big Moose.

Starting in the 1930s, people began to use automobiles rather than the train. However, through the 1950s and until 1961, there was a daily day train and a daily night train in each direction to Lake Placid station. Passenger train service ended on April 24, 1965. Freight service to and from the Adirondacks also declined after World War II. The Penn Central Transportation Company, successor to the New York Central, continued freight service between Utica and Lake Placid until it abandoned the Remsen-Lake Placid line in 1972.

===Airports===
There are many small airstrips and lakes for seaplanes to land but there is only one commercial airport within the park. The Adirondack Regional Airport sits just outside of the Village of Saranac Lake in the hamlet of Lake Clear, town of Harrietstown. The airport&#x27;s commercial airline service is funded by the government&#x27;s Essential Air Service program, which provides small communities with flights to major cities that could not be supported without the help of government funding. Plattsburgh International Airport is located outside the park.

==Architectural heritage==

There is an Adirondack architectural style that relates to the rugged style associated with the Great Camps. The builders of these camps used native building materials and sited their buildings within an irregular wooded landscape. These camps for the wealthy were built to provide a primitive, rustic appearance while avoiding the problems of in-shipping materials from elsewhere.

=== Fire towers ===
In 1903 and 1908 fires consumed nearly of forest. In 1909, the first Adirondack fire lookout tower, made of logs, was erected on Mount Morris and many others were built over the next several years. From 1916 steel towers were built. At one time or another, there have been fire towers at 57 locations in today&#x27;s Adirondack Park. The system worked for about 60 years, but has since been replaced by other technologies. Today, 34 towers survive in the region and many have been restored and are accessible to the public. Some in the Adirondack Forest Preserve have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places, including those on the following mountains: Arab, Azure, Blue, Hadley, Kane, Loon Lake, Poke-O-Moonshine, St. Regis, Snowy, and Wakely.

=== Industrial ===
McIntyre Furnace &amp; McNaughton Cottage: an 1853 blast furnace, the 1832 McNaughton Cottage, the remains of the Tahawus Club era buildings, and the early mining-related sites.

=== Ecclesiastical ===
St. Regis Presbyterian church: designed by prolific Saranac Lake architect William L. Coulter and built on land donated by Paul Smith. Construction funds came from donations from the congregation, which was largely made up of summer residents. It served as a church from 1899 to 2010.

=== Infrastructure ===
The Bow Bridge: The Bow Bridge in Hadley is one of only two parabolic or lenticular truss bridges in the region and one of only about 50 remaining in the country. It was built over the Sacandaga River by the Berlin Iron Bridge Co. in 1885.

The AuSable Chasm Bridge.

=== Residential and leisure ===

The Adirondack lean-to is a three sided log shelter.

Saranac Village at Will Rogers: a Tudor Revival style retirement community, was constructed in 1930 as a tuberculosis treatment facility for vaudeville performers. Due to the subsequent decline of vaudeville performers, and an eventual cure for tuberculosis, its doors closed in 1975. After sitting unused for twenty years, it was bought in 1998 by the Alpine Adirondack Association, LLC and reopened in January 2000 as a retirement community.

Camp Santanoni was once a private estate of approximately 13,000 acres (53 km2), and now is the property of the state, at Newcomb. It was a residential complex of about 45 buildings. Now a National Historic Landmark, this is one of the earliest examples of the Great Camps of the Adirondacks. At the time of completion in 1893, Camp Santanoni was regarded as the grandest of all such Adirondack camps.

Wellscroft, at Upper Jay, is a Tudor Revival–style summer estate home. It is a long, -story, building with several projecting bays, porches, gables and dormers, a porte cochere and a service wing. The rear facade features a large semi-circular projection. The first-story exterior is faced in native fieldstone. The interior features a number of Arts and Crafts style design features. Also on the property are a power house, fire house, gazebo, root cellar, reservoir, ruins of the caretaker&#x27;s house and carriage house, and the remains of the landscaped grounds. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.

Prospect Point Camp: a Great Camp notable for its unusual chalets inspired by European hunting lodges.

<doc id="530187" wikidata="Q1543280" url="?curid=530187" title="Theme Park (video game)">
<text>Theme Park is a construction and management simulation video game developed by Bullfrog Productions and published by Electronic Arts in 1994. The player designs and operates an amusement park, with the goal of making money and creating theme parks worldwide. The game is the first instalment in Bullfrog&#x27;s &quot;Theme&quot; series and their &quot;Designer Series&quot;.

Development took about a year and a half, with the team aiming for as much realism as possible. Certain features, including multiplayer, were dropped. Over 15 million copies were sold, and ports for various games consoles were released, most in 1995. &quot;Theme Park&quot; received generally positive reviews. Reviewers praised the gameplay and humour, but criticised console ports for reasons such as lack of save or mouse support. The game received a Japanese localisation (in addition to normal Japanese releases), &quot;Shin Theme Park&quot;, released in 1997 for the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation, and remakes for the Nintendo DS and iOS, released in 2007 and 2011 respectively. &quot;Theme Hospital&quot; is Bullfrog&#x27;s thematic successor to the game, and two direct sequels followed: &quot;Theme Park World&quot; (known as &quot;Sim Theme Park&quot; in some territories) and &quot;Theme Park Inc&quot; (also known as &quot;SimCoaster&quot;).

==Gameplay==
Starting with a free plot of land in the United Kingdom and a few hundred thousand pounds, the player must build a profitable amusement park. Money is spent on building rides, shops, and staff, and earned through sale of entry tickets, merchandise, and refreshments. Shops available include those selling foodstuff (such as ice creams) or soft drinks, and games such as coconut shies and arcades. Their attributes can be customised, which may affect customers&#x27; behaviour: for example, affecting the flavour of foods (e.g. by altering the amount of sugar an ice cream contains) may entice customers to return. Facilities such as toilets, and items that enhance the park&#x27;s scenery (such as trees and fountains) can be purchased. Over thirty attractions, ranging in complexity from the bouncy castle and tree house to more complicated and expensive rides such as the roller coaster and Ferris wheel are available. Also available are shows (called &#x27;acts&#x27;) with themes such as clowns and mediaeval. Certain rides, such as roller coasters, require a track to be laid out. The ride complement varies between platforms: for example, the PlayStation version is missing the mediaeval and dolphin shows. Rides require regular maintenance: if neglected for too long they will explode. Depending on the platform, it is possible to tour the park or the rides.

Visitors arrive and leave via a bus. The entry price can be set, and loans can be taken out. The player starts with a limited number of shops, rides, and facilities available. Research must be carried out to purchase others. Research can also make rides more durable, staff more efficient, and buses larger with increased capacity. The topic of research and how much funding goes into it is determined by the player.

Staff available for employment include entertainers, security guards, mechanics, and handymen. Lack of staff can cause problems, including messy footpaths, rides breaking down, crime, and unhappy visitors. If visitors become unhappy, thugs may come to vandalise the park by committing offences such as popping balloons, stealing food, and beating up entertainers. Occasionally, wages and the price of goods must be negotiated; failure to reach an agreement results in staff strikes or loss of shipment.

&quot;Theme Park&quot; offers three levels of simulation: the higher difficulties requiring more management of aspects such as logistics. For example, at full level, the player must manage research, negotiations, stocks, and shares. On sandbox, the game does not involve those aspects. The player can switch mode at any time. Game time is implemented like a calendar: at the end of each year, the player is judged on that year&#x27;s performance against rivals. Game speed can be adjusted, and staff can be moved by the player. Cash awards may be earned for doing well, and trophies may be awarded for achievements such as having the longest roller coaster.

The goal is to increase the park&#x27;s value and available money so that it can be sold and a new lot purchased from another part of the world to start a new theme park. Once enough money has been made, the player can auction the park and move on to newer plots, located worldwide and having different factors affecting gameplay, including the economy, weather, terrain and land value. The Mega Drive and SNES versions feature different settings (e.g. desert and glacier) depending on the park&#x27;s location.

==Development==
Peter Molyneux stated that he came up with the idea of creating &quot;Theme Park&quot; because he felt the business genre was worth pursuing. He said that &quot;Theme Park&quot; is a game he had always wanted to create, and wanted to avoid the mistakes of his earlier business simulation game, &quot;The Entrepreneur&quot;: he wanted to create a business simulation game and make it fun so that people would want to play it. In an interview, he explained that the primary reason he created &quot;Theme Park&quot; was because he wanted players to create their dream Theme Park. Another reason is he wanted players to understand the kind of work running one entails. The three difficulty settings enable players to choose the desired depth: simply having fun creating a theme park, or making all the business decisions too. Molyneux stated that the most difficult part to program was the visitors&#x27; behaviour.

The story was originally to have the player play the role of a nephew who had inherited a fortune from his aunt, to be spent only on the world&#x27;s largest and most profitable theme park. The graphics were drawn and modelled using 3D Studio. Molyneux stated that each person takes about 200 bytes of memory, enough for them to have their own personality. The team travelled the world visiting theme parks and taking notes, and sound effects were sampled from real parks. Molyneux explained that they were going for as much realism as possible. There was to be a feature where a microphone is placed on a visitor and so the player could hear what they were saying, and multiplayer support was dropped two weeks prior to release because of a deadline. Multiplayer mode would have let players send thugs to other parks.

&quot;Theme Park&quot; took roughly a year and a half for Molyneux and co-designer and chief programmer Demis Hassabis to develop. Much of the code was used in &quot;Theme Hospital&quot;, and an animation editor was improved by &quot;Theme Hospital&quot;″s designer and producer Mark Webley, who dubbed it The Complex Engine. Artist Gary Carr did not think the game was a good idea, and disliked the art style. Molyneux wanted him to create a colourful style to appeal to a Japanese market, but Carr disagreed and left Bullfrog. Carr later retracted his beliefs and, in 2012, stated that he considered the game a classic. In 1994, Molyneux was developing both &quot;Theme Park&quot; and &quot;Magic Carpet&quot;. The game was mostly complete by January 1994 and scheduled for release on 28 March, but this was pushed back to June, and then August. &quot;Theme Park&quot; sold over 15 million copies, and was extremely popular in Japan (the Japanese PlayStation version sold 85 thousand copies within weeks), as well as Europe. &quot;Theme Park&quot; did not sell well in the United States; Molyneux hypothesised that this was because the graphics are too childish for American audiences. The game is the first instalment in Bullfrog&#x27;s &quot;Designer Series&quot;, and it was intended for the series to use &quot;Theme Park&quot;″s engine and for each instalment to have three simulation levels. The PC version was sponsored by Midland Bank.

The PlayStation port was developed by Krisalis Software, and released in 1995. The Mega CD port features CD soundtrack, and was developed by Domark and released in the same year. Bullfrog developed the Mega Drive port, which was mostly complete by April 1995, and the Sega Saturn port, released in November 1995. Other ports include the Amiga CD32, Atari Jaguar, 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, and Macintosh. Mark Healey handled the graphics for the Mega Drive and Super Nintendo Entertainment System versions. The graphics were completed in three days. The PC version was released on GOG.com on 9 December 2013.

== Reception ==
&quot;Theme Park&quot; received critical acclaim. The gameplay, graphics, and addictiveness in particular were well received. A reviewer of &quot;Edge&quot; commented that the game is complex, but praised the detail and addictiveness. &quot;PC Gamer&quot;″s Gary Whitta was highly impressed with the game: he eulogised the fun factor and compared it to that of &quot;SimCity 2000&quot;. He also praised the &quot;gloriously cartoony&quot; graphics and &quot;exceptional&quot; soundtrack. &quot;Theme Park&quot; was named as the &quot;PC Gamer&quot; June 1994 Game of The Month. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; reviewer complimented the &quot;cute&quot; graphics, and described the game as &quot;fun&quot; and &quot;feature-packed&quot;. The visitors&#x27; and ride animations were complimented by French magazine &quot;Joystick&quot;.

The Jaguar version was noted by critics as having problems such as slowdown and lack of a save option, although some liked the graphics and gameplay. The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; commented that the game itself is great fun, but that the Jaguar conversion had confusing menus and dithered text which is excessively difficult to read. &quot;GamePro&quot; echoed these criticisms and further stated that the Jaguar version suffers from frustrating slowdown. They summarised that &quot;Ocean didn&#x27;t work hard enough to make &quot;Theme Park&quot; look and sound good on the Jaguar&quot;. A reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot; took the reverse position, saying that the Jaguar conversion &quot;is seamless&quot; and the game itself was mediocre. Their elaboration was that &quot;slow gameplay and confusing layouts keep it from ever achieving the addictiveness of the other &#x27;god&#x27; games, and most players will find themselves bored before they&#x27;ve even run through all of the options&quot;. German magazine &quot;Atari Inside&quot;″s reviewer complimented the addictiveness, but the lack of save opportunities was criticised, and a reviewer from &quot;ST Computer&quot; believed the game&#x27;s complexity and colourful graphics assured it of being long and attractive. &quot;Mega Fun&quot;″s main criticism of the Jaguar version was its inability to save in-game.

The Saturn version was noted as being mostly faithful to the PC original. Sam Hickman of &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; praised it for retaining the original intro, music, speech samples, and features of the PC version (all of which had been left out of most previous console versions), although a reviewer from the Japanese magazine of the same name criticised the lack of mouse support. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; reviewer held a similar opinion to that of Hickman by commending the Saturn version for being a comprehensive port of the PC original, and also applauded the addictive simulation gaming of &quot;Theme Park&quot;, calling it &quot;&quot;SimCity&quot; with a playful spirit&quot;. &quot;Mean Machines Sega&quot; reviewer compared it to the Mega Drive version, citing the save function and variety of entertainers as major improvements over that version. A &quot;Next Generation&quot; critic lauded the game&#x27;s &quot;simple interface&quot;, &quot;infectious gameplay&quot;, and &quot;realistic business fundamentals&quot;, but felt the Saturn&#x27;s &quot;near-perfect&quot; conversion of the PC original was commendable but unexciting, and expressed regret that there were no upgrades or additions. &quot;GamePro&quot; gave a terse joint review of the Saturn and PlayStation versions, commenting: &quot;You decide every detail, right down to the roller coaster&#x27;s speed. Simple graphics and sounds offer up little treats to keep the game interesting. Overlapping menu systems force you to read the manual&quot;.

Critics had similar opinions of other versions. &quot;Mean Machines Sega&quot; described the game as &quot;the most complex Megadrive game ever created&quot;, and eulogised playability and longevity, but criticised the behaviour of the handymen. &quot;CU Amiga&quot; praised the addictiveness of the Amiga version, and called the game &quot;colourful&quot;. The visuals were likewise commended by Jeuxvideo.com on the PC and Macintosh versions, and the British humour was complimented as well. German magazine &quot;Mega Fun&quot; compared the SNES version to the Mega Drive version, and said the SNES version had better controls and music, creating atmosphere. Reviewing the PlayStation version, &quot;Maximum&quot; said that the game &quot;is probably one of the best sim games around. It manages to strike a balance between in-depth game play and personality, which you don&#x27;t get with the more brow-furrowing games of this genre&quot;, although the only improvement being a view option was cited as a disappointment. &quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the 3DO version of the game, and stated that &quot;it&#x27;s cute, but we&#x27;re waiting for 3DO&#x27;s &quot;Transport Tycoon&quot;&quot;. In their review of the Macintosh version of the game, they believed that players would think of it when they visit Disneyland.

===Accolades===

In 1997, &quot;Theme Park&quot; appeared jointly with &quot;Theme Hospital&quot; at No. 61 on &quot;PC Gamer&quot;″s list of top 100 games. In 2004, &quot;Theme Park&quot; was inducted into GameSpot&#x27;s list of the greatest games of all time. In 1995, Total! ranked the game 36th on their Top 100 SNES Games. In 1996, GamesMaster rated the Sega Saturn version 6th in its &quot;The GamesMaster Saturn Top 10.&quot;

==Re-releases==
A Japanese remake of &quot;Theme Park&quot;, titled was released on 11 April 1997 by Electronic Arts Victor for the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn. This version is different from other releases in Japan; the game&#x27;s style and visuals are changed. The game was remade for the Nintendo DS by EA Japan. It was released in Japan on 15 March 2007 with releases in the US and Europe on 20 and 23 March, respectively. New features of the game are the user interface, which was designed to fit the stylus functionality of the DS platform, and bonus rides/shops exclusive to certain properties, such as a tea room themed on an AEC Routemaster bus for England, Japanese dojo-style bouncy castle for Japan, a Coliseum-themed pizza parlour for Italy, a La Sagrada Familia-themed paella restaurant for Spain etc. The remake is based on the DOS version. The game differs from the original in that the game provides four different advisers. &quot;Theme Park&quot; was remade for iOS in 2011. Items can only be placed on designated places, and the game relies on premium items. Rides can cost up to $60 (£46) in real money, and for this reason the game was not well received.

<text>Stewart Gilligan &quot;Stewie&quot; Griffin is a fictional character from the animated television series &quot;Family Guy&quot;. He is voiced by series creator Seth MacFarlane and first appeared on television, along with the rest of the Griffin family, in the episode &quot;Death Has a Shadow&quot; on January 31, 1999. Stewie was created and designed by MacFarlane himself, who was asked to pitch a pilot to the Fox Broadcasting Company, based on &quot;The Life of Larry&quot; and &quot;Larry &amp; Steve&quot;, two shorts made by MacFarlane featuring a middle-aged man named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve.

Stewie is a highly toddler who talks and acts as an adult. He is the third child and second son of Peter and Lois Griffin, the youngest brother of Meg, the younger brother of Chris, and the older half-brother of Bertram. He began the series as a cal sociopath, initially obsessed with violence, matricide, and world domination. As the series progressed, particularly following the two-episode arc &quot;Stewie Kills Lois&quot; and &quot;Lois Kills Stewie&quot;, the devious and violent aspects of Stewie&#x27;s personality were toned down, and he has evolved into an eccentric, friendlier, and flamboyant scamp (something possibly foreshadowed in the direct-to-video film &quot;Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story&quot;). He has also come to have a very close friendship with the family&#x27;s anthropomorphic dog, Brian, whom he originally used to antagonize in the earliest episodes. Stewie is considered to be the show&#x27;s breakout character and has received numerous award nominations from writers such as Jodiss Pierre.

==Role in &quot;Family Guy&quot;==
Stewie Griffin is portrayed as a one-year-old prodigy who has a sophisticated voice, 
American football head, and can speak very fluently in an upper-class British accent with quite-advanced vocabulary. He reaches his first birthday in the season 1 episode &quot;Chitty Chitty Death Bang&quot;, and the family celebrates Stewie&#x27;s birthday in a cutaway gag in the season 12 episode &quot;Chap Stewie&quot;. As Stewie&#x27;s first birthday was celebrated in the episode &quot;Chitty Chitty Death Bang&quot;, it is safe to assume that it was Stewie&#x27;s second first birthday in the episode &quot;Chap Stewie&quot;. Very highly literate and able to cite pop culture references that long predate his birth, Stewie is also entranced by Raffi and &quot;Teletubbies&quot;.

Stewie succumbs to other childish tendencies; he believes Peter has truly disappeared in a game of peekaboo, often has difficulties understanding the concept of shapes, talks to his teddy bear Rupert as if he were alive, is overcome with laughter when Lois blows on his stomach; and has no idea how to use a toilet. MacFarlane has stated that Stewie was created to represent the general helplessness of an infant through the eyes of an adult. Per cartoon physics, his ability to move objects of greater weight than himself is not surprising to other characters, nor is his apparent ability to retrieve firearms from hammerspace or his ability to talk. According to &quot;Don&#x27;t Be a Dickens at Christmas&quot;, he understands German (but cannot speak it), as his great-great-grandmother is of German descent and the Pewterschmidts (except Lois) speak it. In &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; it is revealed that he is descended from Italian polymath Leonardo da Vinci, on Lois&#x27;s side of the family.

Stewie&#x27;s mastery of physics and mechanical engineering is quite extraordinary and at a level of science fiction. He has constructed advanced fighter jets, mind control devices, a weather control device, a teleportation device, robots, clones, a working Transporter device from &quot;Star Trek&quot;, time machines, a Multiverse Transporter, and a shrinking pod, as well as an assortment of weapons including lasers, rocket launchers, and crossbows. Stewie employs these to cope with the perceived stresses of infant life (such as teething pain and eating broccoli) and to murder his mother, Lois, with mixed success at best depending on the objective. As made clear in the pilot episode, Stewie&#x27;s matricidal tendencies are a result of Lois constantly and unwittingly thwarting his schemes, and so he desires to kill her to carry out his plans without her interference.

In other, later episodes, Stewie engages in other violent and criminal acts, including robbery, aggravated assault, carjacking, loan sharking, forgery, and killing off many minor characters (with a tank, guns, and other assorted weaponry).

Stewie eventually realizes his dreams of matricide and world domination in the sixth season two-part episode &quot;Stewie Kills Lois&quot; and &quot;Lois Kills Stewie&quot;. The events are reverted in a deus ex machina ending, where most of the story turns out to be a computer simulation. Because of the rather disastrous ending for himself in the simulation, being shot and killed by Peter, he decides to put aside his outlandish plans of matricide and world domination for the time being.

Stewie shows a complete disdain for most people, especially Matthew McConaughey, but does show affection and even rare instances of kindness to his family. Such moments include his support for Meg (whom he traditionally calls &quot;Megan&quot;) as when he chided Brian&#x27;s coke-induced hostility to her (&quot;The Thin White Line&quot;), retracted his joke, &quot;I hate you too, bitch&quot; when Meg said &quot;I hate you all&quot; to the family (&quot;Untitled Griffin Family History&quot;), told his parents to stop their gross negativism on Meg&#x27;s attempt at cooking and give her a chance (&quot;Trading Places&quot;), and wiped her tears during a weepy moment. On a more frequent basis though, Stewie constantly disrespects Meg, as he does with most elders (and as most people do to Meg), often being rude to her and subjecting her to the malice of his misbehavior, once even tricking her outside to be attacked by bees on steroids.

He generally thinks of Peter as an inferior—regarding him simply as &quot;the fat man&quot; and, at one point, harboring doubts that Peter could be his father (&quot;Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story&quot;)—but does bond with him over a shared love of practical jokes made at Lois&#x27; expense (&quot;The Courtship of Stewie&#x27;s Father&quot;). While Stewie typically regards Chris as a stooge, he considers him his only friend aside from Brian and even helped Chris to dress when he felt too shy to date (&quot;Extra Large Medium&quot;) and assists him in dealing with bullies (&quot;Secondhand Spoke&quot;). In a few episodes, such as &quot;Stewie Loves Lois&quot;, it is shown that Stewie can love his mother. In that episode, after Lois recovers and repairs a lost Rupert and serves Stewie a meal he likes, he rethinks Lois and accepts her as a loving mother. When he becomes too dependent on her, she deliberately takes no notice of him; when he hurts himself, she tries to show notice of him again, and he returns to hating her. However, at the end of the season nine premiere, &quot;And Then There Were Fewer&quot;, when Diane Simmons is about to murder Lois for uncovering her murderous revenge scheme, Stewie secretly saves Lois by killing Diane with a sniper rifle, though he states to himself that he only did it to not miss out on the opportunity to kill Lois in the future.

In the more recent seasons, Stewie has a larger amount of freedom from his parents, usually spending much of his time with Brian. This extends to the point of his ability to keep pigs from parallel universes (&quot;Road to the Multiverse&quot;) or take part in the television series &quot;Jolly Farm&quot; (&quot;Go Stewie Go&quot;), as compared to the first season, in which his plans were constantly hindered by Lois. In &quot;The Hand That Rocks the Wheelchair&quot;, Stewie inadvertently clones an evil twin of himself after trying to increase his evil nature. By the end of the episode, it is suggested that the original Stewie may have been unknowingly killed by Brian (as he cannot tell them apart) and Stewie turns to the camera with glowing yellow eyes (reminiscent of Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot;). But so far, the Stewie has recently seen in &quot;Trading Places&quot;, the follow-up episode, he still seems to have his mostly harmless eccentricity, shown when he asks Brian if he wants to trade places with him for fun.

He also starts to interact with more people despite still having hatred towards many of them, as shown in cutaways in later episodes and is more flamboyant. Stewie is shown in more recent episodes to be a superfan of Taylor Swift and even sets her up with Chris as a prom date. Stewie has had a few rare interactions with his pedophile elderly neighbor Herbert. Stewie intensely dislikes him and is one of the few characters fully aware of Herbert&#x27;s nature, even calling him a pervert to his face. All this does, however, is move Herbert into thinking Stewie is &quot;feisty&quot;.

In the season 16 episode &quot;Send in Stewie, Please&quot;, it is revealed that Stewie&#x27;s English accent is fake and that he has an American Boston accent, although the follow-up joke that has him speak in numerous other voices (of Seth MacFarlane&#x27;s other characters) suggests it was a mere gag.

==Development==
Stewie is voiced by &quot;Family Guy&quot; creator Seth MacFarlane, who also provides the voices of Brian Griffin, Peter Griffin, and Glenn Quagmire as well as numerous minor characters. MacFarlane based Stewie&#x27;s accent on the voice of English actor Rex Harrison, particularly on Harrison&#x27;s performance in the 1964 musical drama film &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, with further influence coming from The Simpsons character Mr. Burns. MacFarlane has stated that his inspiration for the Stewie name was a car owned by Stan Lee. MacFarlane has also linked Stewie with David Hyde Pierce on more than one occasion, saying he wants Pierce to play Stewie if a live action version of the show would ever be created.

Stewie&#x27;s head has the shape of a rugby ball. In the episode &quot;Stuck Together, Torn Apart&quot;, a cutaway shows Stewie&#x27;s head to be normally shaped, until he hits it on the ceiling while bouncing on the bed, and it is elongated into the familiar shape. Flashbacks in &quot;Chitty Chitty Death Bang&quot;, however, show his head was already shaped like a football when he was born.
===Ambiguous sexuality===
Stewie&#x27;s sexuality is ambiguous. When the writers began to flesh out Stewie&#x27;s character beyond being a generic supervillain in season two, MacFarlane and the writers began to explore Stewie&#x27;s sexuality with a series of one-off gags, which hinted in &quot;Chick Cancer&quot; and &quot;We Love You, Conrad&quot; that Stewie might be homosexual. One example is in the episode, &quot;Brian and Stewie&quot;, where Stewie&#x27;s cellphone screensaver is of a muscular man. Another is where he has a picture of Chris Noth in his wallet and he expresses his wishes to have sexual relations with Brian&#x27;s son, Dylan. In some episodes, such as &quot;Turkey Guys&quot; and &quot;Send in Stewie, Please&quot;, Stewie appears to be on the verge of coming out of the closet when he is interrupted for comedic effect.

In other instances, such as when Stewie falls in love with a girl, Janet, in &quot;Dammit Janet!&quot;, he is &quot;a very unhappy repressed heterosexual&quot; in Seth MacFarlane&#x27;s words. In the commentary for &quot;Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story&quot;, the writers describe how they were going to make Stewie discover he was gay but decided to scrap this idea to retain Stewie&#x27;s sexual ambiguity for writing purposes. MacFarlane planned for the series third season to end with Stewie coming out after a near-death experience. The show&#x27;s abrupt cancellation caused MacFarlane to abort these plans, and the episode &quot;Queer Is Stewie?&quot; was produced, but never shown. Since that point, MacFarlane has opted to have Stewie portrayed as sexually ambiguous, as, in his eyes, the flexibility of Stewie&#x27;s sexuality allows for much more freedom in terms of writing for the character.
MacFarlane later elaborated:

When asked why he made the decision &quot;to take Stewie from homicidal maniac to gay little song boy?,&quot; MacFarlane answered: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t a conscious decision. Characters evolve in certain ways and we found that doing the take-over-the-world thing every week was getting played out and was starting to feel a little dated. It was weirdly feeling a little &#x27;90s and believe me, if we were still doing that, the show would be on its last legs. I only half-jokingly go by the guideline that, if it&#x27;s something that might ruin the show, it&#x27;s a story we should probably do.&quot;

MacFarlane told &quot;Playboy&quot; &quot;We had an episode that went all the way to the script phase in which Stewie does come out. It had to do with the harassment he took from other kids at school. He ends up going back in time to prevent a passage in Leviticus from being written: &#x27;Thou shalt not lie with mankind as with womankind. It is an abomination.&#x27; But we decided it&#x27;s better to keep it vague, which makes more sense because he&#x27;s a one-year-old. Ultimately, Stewie will be gay or a very unhappy repressed heterosexual. It also explains why he&#x27;s so hellbent on killing his mother, Lois, and taking over the world: he has a lot of aggression, which comes from confusion and uncertainty about his orientation.&quot;

==Reception==
MacFarlane has been nominated for two awards for voicing Stewie Griffin. In 1999, he won a Primetime Emmy Award in the category Outstanding Voice-Over Performance. In 2006, he received an Annie Award in the Best Voice Acting in an Animated Television, Production category, for his voice work in the episode &quot;Brian the Bachelor&quot;. In addition, &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine rated Stewie the 95th-greatest villain of all time. Stewie was also named the best &quot;Family Guy&quot; character on a list of &quot;Top 25 Family Guy Characters&quot; compiled by IGN. In 2010, Entertainment Weekly placed him 45th on its list of the &quot;Top 100 Characters of the Past Twenty Years.&quot; Gay.com ranked Stewie as the fifteenth-gayest cartoon character. Hal Boedeker, a critic for &quot;The Orlando Sentinel&quot;, called Stewie &quot;a brilliant creation&quot;. Stewie (and Brian) usually form the center-plot for the show&#x27;s highest-rated and most critically acclaimed episodes, these being the &quot;Road to ...&quot; episodes. In a list of Stewie and Brian&#x27;s greatest adventures, five of the &quot;Road to ...&quot; episodes occupied the top five places.

===Allegations of plagiarized design===
Several commentators have noticed similarities between Stewie and the title character of the graphic novel &quot;Jimmy Corrigan, the Smartest Kid on Earth&quot; (first published in 1995), including its author, Chris Ware. Ware has remarked that the similarities are &quot;a little too coincidental to be simply, well, coincidental.&quot; He further stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t want a book of seven years&#x27; worth of my stuff to become available and then be accused of being a rip-off of &quot;Family Guy&quot;.&quot; 20th Century Fox insists that Stewie is an entirely original character. In a 2003 interview, MacFarlane said that he had never seen the comic strip before, described the similarities as &quot;pretty shocking&quot; and said that he could &quot;see how [Ware] would reach that conclusion.&quot;

==Merchandise and appearances in other media==
Stewie has been included on &quot;Family Guy&quot; T-shirts, baseball caps, bumper stickers, cardboard standups, refrigerator magnets, posters, and several other items. Stewie appears in the &quot;Family Guy Video Game!&quot;, where Stewie discovers his brother Bertram attempting to outdo him in taking over the world. Desperate to stop him, Stewie shrinks and makes his way to Bertram&#x27;s lair within Peter&#x27;s testicles to discover his plan, destroy his henchman cloning lab, and rescue a kidnapped Rupert from a rocket. He finally confronts Bertram in the park, where Bertram turns himself into a giant. &quot;Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story&quot; is a DVD movie about Stewie&#x27;s secret and what can be his future. Stewie is also a playable character (along with Brian) in the show&#x27;s second video game, &quot;Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse&quot;, where the pair travel through the multiverse again, to defeat Bertram.

Stewie appeared in the &quot;Bones&quot; season 4 episode &quot;The Critic in the Cabernet&quot;, as the result of a brain tumor-induced hallucination that FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz) was suffering from. MacFarlane wrote all of Stewie&#x27;s dialogue for the episode. The character appeared in a Coca-Cola commercial during Super Bowl XLII, he and Brian appeared in a commercial for Wheat Thins, he presented a musical number at the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards with Brian, and he appeared at the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards. He appeared on the December 21, 2009, episode of &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; to present &quot;Top Ten Things You Don&#x27;t Want To Hear From Your Child.&quot; In the 2023 animated feature film &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem&quot;, Stewie was mentioned as part of a joke from Donatello to Micheangelo on how the latter&#x27;s head shape was if &quot;Stewie had a baby with &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot;&quot;. Stewie appears in the 2024 Simpsons short &quot;May the 12th Be with You&quot;. He is seen requesting to have vodka put in his juice box, only for Homer to put him in a bag and carry him off to Moe&#x27;s Tavern.

==Understanding Stewie==
There is much debate over which characters in &quot;Family Guy&quot; can understand Stewie. In an interview, MacFarlane said that everyone can basically understand him, but they ignore him or just think to themselves &quot;oh how cute&quot; when he talks. However, at the 2011 Comic-Con panel, he compared this to Wile E. Coyote in the old &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoons. MacFarlane went on to say that Brian always hears Stewie, and more recently so does Chris, but the writers usually strive for Peter, Lois, and Meg (apart from &quot;Leggo My Meg-O&quot;) not to hear him. Once Stewie leaves the house, the question of who can hear him depends very much on the story. MacFarlane also states that these rules can be broken for the sake of comedy, so this could change from one episode to another.

There are several jokes within the series revolving around whether the Griffins, other than Brian, can understand Stewie. In &quot;E. Peterbus Unum&quot;, a student watching the episode from the distant future asks his teacher, &quot;So, can the family understand the baby, or... what&#x27;s the deal with that?&quot; In &quot;Inside &quot;Family Guy&quot;&quot;, Peter apologizes to the family, to which Stewie comments: &quot;Oh that&#x27;s nice of you to say&quot;. Peter replies: &quot;Thank you, Stewie, who I can understand&quot;. In &quot;Stewie&#x27;s First Word&quot;, after Stewie utters an expletive that everyone around him can clearly understand, he eventually concludes that people can only understand him when he wants them to, namely whenever he is feeling intense emotion.

<text>Pietro II Orseolo (961−1009) was the Doge of Venice from 991 to 1009, and a member of the House of Orseolo.
He began the period of eastern expansion of Venice that lasted for the better part of 500 years. He secured his influence in the Dalmatian Romanized settlements from the Croats and Narentines, freed Venetia from a 50-year-old taxation to the latter, and started Venetia&#x27;s expansions by conquering the islands of Lastovo (&quot;Lagosta&quot;) and Korčula (&quot;Curzola&quot;) and acquiring Dubrovnik (&quot;Ragusa&quot;).

==Reign==

=== Relations with Byzantium ===
In 992 Pietro II Orseolo concluded a treaty with the Byzantine emperor Basil II to transport Byzantine troops in exchange for commercial privileges in Constantinople. His dogaressa was Maria Candiano.

Following repeated complaints by the Dalmatian city-states in 997, the Venetian fleet under Orseolo attacked the Neretvian pirates of Neretva (Narentines) on Ascension Day in 998. Pietro then took the title of &quot;Dux Dalmatianorum&quot; (Duke of the Dalmatians), associating it with his son Giovanni Orseolo.

=== Scorched earth policy ===
On 9 May 1000 Doge Pietro II decided to finally pacify the Croatians and the Narentines during the last Croatian-Bulgarian wars, protecting Venetian trade colonies and the interests of Romanized Dalmatians. Without difficulties, his fleet of six ships scorched the entire eastern half of the Adriatic coast, with only the Neretvians offering resistance. After the Neretvians stole goods and captured forty traders from Zadar, the Doge dispatched ten ships that caught the Neretvians near the island of Kača. He captured them all and brought them triumphantly to Split. There, Neretvian emissaries requested the release of the prisoners. Pietro II agreed provided that the Neretvian Archont himself agreed to bow before him. Moreover, the Neretvians would also have to renounce the old tax that Venetia had to pay since 948, and guarantee safe passage to Venetian ships in the Adriatic.

Pietro II released all prisoners except for six Narentines, whom he kept as hostages. The mainland Narentines were thus pacified; the citizens of Korčula decided to wage war against Orseolo, but were eventually conquered. Lastovo however, continued to resist Venetian incursions. The island was infamous for being a pirate haven. In the effort to decisively quell further opposition, Pietro II ordered the evacuation of the island city. Despite continuing opposition, he eventually razed Lastovo to the ground.

At the same time that Pietro II subjugated Lastovo, the former Croatian king Svetoslav Suronja fled to Venice after being deposed by his two brothers. To bolster his weakened position, King Stephen I of Croatia married Pietro II Orseolo&#x27;s daughter, Joscella (Hicela) Orseolo. Their son Peter Krešimir IV became king in Croatia in 1059.

Pietro II Orseolo was married to Maria Candiano, the daughter of doge Vitale Candiano and niece of doge Pietro IV Candiano. Their son Giovanni was associated with his father in the dogeship in 1003, and on his death in 1007 his brother Ottone took his place. Ottone later succeeded his father as the doge of Venice until 1026, while his son Peter reigned as King of Hungary. Pietro&#x27;s younger son Domenico Orseolo&#x27;s children settled in Ravenna and became the stem of the Orsini family.

== Legacy ==
The date of his victory became that of the &quot;Festa della Sensa&quot;, the Ascension Festival, the oldest festival in Venice. It was commemorated by the Doge and the bishop of Olivolo going past the Lido and blessing the waters, invoking good fortune for the Venetian navy.

<text>The Republic of Indian Stream or the Indian Stream Republic was an unrecognized republic in North America, along the section of the border that divides the current Canadian province of Quebec from the U.S. state of New Hampshire. It existed from July 9, 1832, to August 5, 1835. Described as &quot;Indian Stream Territory, so-called&quot; by the United States census-taker in 1830, the area was named for Indian Stream, a small watercourse. It had an organized elected government and constitution and served about three hundred citizens.

==History==
=== Settlement ===
The area was first settled by Europeans under a land grant, from King Philip, an Abenaki man, named after Metacomet, who was also called King Philip.

This grant was sold to one land-speculation company, while a second group of Indians from the same tribe made representations to another company of Europeans that their chief had been deposed and that they were empowered to issue a grant to the second company. Following the Revolutionary War, both companies surveyed the territories and issued their own land grants to settlers, which frequently overlapped one another. After the War of 1812, when both companies were in financial straits, they merged and reconciled all land claims.

=== Establishment ===
The establishment of Indian Stream as an independent nation was, essentially, the result of the ambiguous boundary between the United States and British Lower Canada as defined in the 1783 Treaty of Paris. There were three possible interpretations of where &quot;the northwesternmost head of the Connecticut River&quot; might be. As a result, the area in and around the three tributaries that fed into the head of the Connecticut River was not definitively under the jurisdiction of either the United States or Lower Canada (which was formed in 1791).

The relevant text from the treaty reads:
The Republic encompassed the northern reaches of what is now the state of New Hampshire, including the four Connecticut Lakes. While the British claimed the southeasternmost branch (the chain of Connecticut Lakes), the U.S. claimed the border as it is today (i.e., Halls Stream to the west, which is, arguably, the &quot;northwesternmost headwater&quot; of the Connecticut). Both sides sent in tax collectors and debt-collecting sheriffs. The double taxation angered the population, and the Republic was formed to put an end to the issue until such time as the United States and Great Britain could reach a settlement on the boundary line. Some of the citizenry considered Indian Stream to be part of the U.S. but not a part of New Hampshire. The Indian Stream assembly declared independence on July 9, 1832, and produced a constitution. One of the drafters of the constitution was Luther Parker, who served as justice of the peace for the Republic from 1832 to 1835.

The Constitution of Indian Stream states in &quot;Part Second – Form of Government&quot;:
=== Annexation to New Hampshire ===

The independence declaration did not cause the sheriff of Coos County to cease his involvement in affairs, with later events leading to an impending invasion by New Hampshire. On July 30, 1835, this sheriff asked for the militia. Two companies of infantry from the towns around Colebrook met at Stewartstown, ready to march into the disputed territory. The sheriff preceded them and, on August 4, met with between 30 and 40 members of the assembly, to whom he issued an ultimatum. Threatened with forcible occupation, most of the gathered assembly capitulated and relented to being annexed by New Hampshire. The Republic ceased to operate independently the next day when five leaders of Indian Stream wrote to a British official in Sherbrooke, Lower Canada, that, with a response to their petition for protection by the British not having occurred in time, Indian Stream had agreed to annexation by New Hampshire. One of the &quot;Streamers&quot;, Richard I. Blanchard, agreed to serve as a deputy sheriff of Coos County. The militia stayed in Stewartstown and dispersed to their homes on August 6.

The annexation of Indian Stream by New Hampshire did not resolve the land dispute. Local British officials took a dim view of the annexation. An incident soon tested the situation. In October 1835, Blanchard led a small party to arrest John Tyler for an unpaid hardware-store debt. After the arrest, Tyler was freed on the road back to Coos County by a group of his neighbors. In reporting the incident to the British magistrate, Tyler falsely stated under oath that the location of his arrest was Drayton, Lower Canada. The magistrate then issued a warrant for Blanchard&#x27;s arrest, which was carried out by a deputy and a few members of the British faction of Streamers, who returned with Blanchard toward the magistrate&#x27;s house in Lower Canada.

Along the way, a group of Streamers stopped them in the road, rescued Blanchard and returned with their freed comrade to Indian Stream. The deputy&#x27;s party continued on to the magistrate&#x27;s house. Several hours later, there was a commotion in the road nearby from a posse of armed Streamers, emboldened by liquor, bent on making an impression. The invading posse shot the deputy through the thigh and then captured the hobbled magistrate with a blow of a saber to his scalp during a struggle. They returned to Canaan, Vermont, with the bleeding magistrate as prisoner, where local leaders treated his wound and released him immediately. In the aftermath, a detachment of fifty New Hampshire militia, including troops and officers, occupied the territory from mid-November until February 18, 1836. On April 2, 1836, a resolution &quot;that New Hampshire has a right to exercise an unconditional control over the territory of Indian Stream&quot; was approved by the citizens of Indian Stream.

This international incident caused a diplomatic crisis. The British ambassador to the United States protested to President Andrew Jackson and the Secretary of State. Both governments, appalled at the idea of war over a matter so trivial as a hardware-store debt, determined to take measures so that matters did not escalate, and an uneasy peace endured in the years preceding the conclusion of a treaty settling the border.

In July 1837, Lord Palmerston in London dismissed all charges in the British judiciary system arising from the incident and reiterated the British position that the territory was part of British North America. The area was still described as Indian Stream at the time of the U.S. census taken on June 1, 1840, when the local population totalled 315. Upon petition by the residents, the area was incorporated as the town of Pittsburg in 1840.

In 1842, the land dispute was definitively resolved by the Webster–Ashburton Treaty, and the land was assigned to New Hampshire. The 1845 Lewis Robinson &quot;Map of New Hampshire based on the latest authorities&quot; shows the boundary as being north of the town of Clarksville but just south of modern-day Pittsburg.

<text>The Trans-Israel pipeline (), also Tipline, Eilat–Ashkelon Pipeline, or Europe–Asia Pipeline is an oil pipeline in Israel extending from the Gulf of Aqaba on the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. It was originally built to transport crude oil originating from Iran inside Israel and to Europe.

The 254 km, 42&quot; pipeline&#x27;s capacity from a special pier in Ashkelon to Eilat&#x27;s port on the Red Sea is per day, and in the opposite direction. The pipeline is owned and operated by the Eilat Ashkelon Pipeline Company (EAPC) which also operates several other oil pipelines in Israel.

==History==

Following the Suez crisis, the Israeli government started the country&#x27;s first crude oil pipeline between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea with a 24,000 bbl/day 8-inch pipe line from Eilat to Beersheba. Initially augmented by truck and rail transport to the Mediterranean coast and to Israel&#x27;s only and underutilized refinery at Haifa, the link to the coast was completed in 1957 with a 16-inch line from Beersheba to Ashdod. Tankers were then carrying crude oil to Haifa. The final leg, a 90-mile 16-inch pipe line from Ashdod to Haifa along the coast was completed in July 1958. An expansion of capacity of the 125 mile section from the Red Sea to Beersheba was initiated in February 1960, raising the overall capacity of the system from 30,000 bbl/day to 100,000 bbl/day. The expansion coincided with the beginning of production for export at Haifa, which had been lacking a sufficient supply of crude oil since 1948 and was producing only for the local market.

The large diameter pipeline was built in 1968 as a 50/50% joint-venture between Israel and Iran. However, Iran ceased using the pipeline after the overthrow of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in the Iranian Islamic Revolution of 1979 and the subsequent severing of relations between the two countries.

In 2003, Israel and Russia made an agreement to supply Asian markets with Russian oil delivered by tankers from Novorossiysk to Ashkelon and then reloaded onto tankers in Eilat for shipment to Asia. The oil would therefore flow in the opposite direction to that intended originally. This route from Europe to Asia is shorter than the traditional one around Africa and cheaper than the one via the Suez Canal.

In December 2014, a breach near the southern end of the pipeline led to a massive oil spill into the Evrona Nature Reserve.

In September 2020, a preliminary agreement was reached to transport Emirati oil from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean through the pipeline.

In May 2021, a storage tank in the Ashkelon depot of the pipeline was damaged by a rocket fired from Gaza in the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis.

===Legal claim by Iran===
Following the seizure of the pipeline in 1979, Iran pursued a claim for compensation against Israel. On 27 June 2016, the Swiss Federal Tribunal decided the case in Iran&#x27;s favor with an award of $1.1 billion plus interest.

<text>Saint-Ouen-sur-Seine (; literally &quot;St. Audoin on Seine&quot;) is a commune in the northern suburbs of Paris, France, located from the centre of Paris. It is part of the Seine-Saint-Denis department, in the Île-de-France region, and of the Métropole du Grand Paris. The commune was called Saint-Ouen until 2018, when it obtained a change of name by ministerial order.

The communes neighbouring Saint-Ouen-sur-Seine are Paris, to the south, Clichy, to the west, Villeneuve-la-Garenne, Gennevilliers and L&#x27;Île-Saint-Denis, to the north, and Saint-Denis to the east. The commune of Saint-Ouen-sur-Seine is part of the canton of Saint-Ouen-sur-Seine, which also includes L&#x27;Île-Saint-Denis and part of Épinay-sur-Seine. Saint-Ouen also includes the Cimetière de Saint-Ouen.

==History==
The town was named after Saint Audoin, a famous 7th century AD Frankish bishop. On 1 January 1860, the city of Paris was enlarged by annexing neighbouring communes. On that occasion, a part of the commune of Saint-Ouen was annexed to the city of Paris. At the same time, the commune of La Chapelle-Saint-Denis was disbanded and divided between the city of Paris, Saint-Ouen, Saint-Denis, and Aubervilliers. Saint-Ouen received a small part of the territory of La Chapelle-Saint-Denis. The commune of Montmartre was also disbanded; the city of Paris annexed most of Montmartre, but Saint-Ouen did receive a small northern part of the territory of that commune.

==Population==

==Flea market==

Saint-Ouen-sur-Seine is home to Paris&#x27; flea market, the highest concentration of antique dealers and second-hand furniture dealers in the world. The flea market (&quot;marché aux puces&quot;) is held every Saturday, Sunday, and Monday; because of this high frequency, compared to other flea markets, it has tended to consist only of professionals who rent their spot for a minimum term of three years. In 2014 the flea market site was acquired by Jean-Cyrille Boutmy from Gerald Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster.

==Transport==
Saint-Ouen-sur-Seine is served by three stations of the Paris Metro: Garibaldi (line 13), Saint-Ouen (line 14 and RER line C) and Mairie de Saint-Ouen (lines 13 and 14).

<text>Indian Stream is a tributary of the Connecticut River, approximately long, in New Hampshire in the United States. It rises in the mountains of extreme northern New Hampshire, in Coos County near the Canada–United States border, where the East Branch of Indian Stream joins the West Branch. Indian Stream flows south-southwest, joining the Connecticut downstream from the village of Pittsburg.

The area around Pittsburg was the subject of a border dispute in the 1830s between the United States and Canada, leading to the short-lived, self-proclaimed Republic of Indian Stream. The border dispute, based upon an ambiguity in the Treaty of Paris (1783), was resolved in 1842, with the river drainage and the land lying east of Halls Stream established as part of the state of New Hampshire.

<text>William Nathaniel Bell (March 6, 1817 – September 6, 1887), originally from Edwardsville, Illinois and later a resident of Portland, Oregon, was a member of the Denny Party, the first group of Euro-American settlers in what is now Seattle, Washington. He lived in Seattle from 1851 to 1856 and then again from 1870 till his death.

in 1852, Bell was a delegate at the Monticello Convention that produced a petition to US Congress to split the Oregon Territory, creating the Washington Territory, which would later become the state of Washington.

==Family==

His first wife, Sarah Ann Peter (daughter of Keziah Peter), died of tuberculosis in June 1856. With her, he had five children:

* Laura Keziah 1842–1887 (married surname: Coffman) 
* Olive Julia 1846–1921 (married surnames: Stearns and Stewart)
* Mary Virginia 1847–1931 (married 1872 to George W. Hall) 
* Alvina Lavina 1851–1857 
* Austin Americus 1854–1889

His second wife, Lucy Gamble, was the younger sister of Sarah Ann.

==Legacy==
His family is remembered in the name Belltown, a neighborhood immediately north of Downtown where his land claim was located. Bell named many of the streets in the area after his own children, including Bell Street, Virginia and Olive Streets and Olive Way (named for his daughters), and Stewart Street, named for Olive&#x27;s husband Joseph H. Stewart.

<doc id="530214" wikidata="Q4951962" url="?curid=530214" title="Boxing in the 1940s">
<text>[[Boxing]] in the 1940s in many ways reflected worldwide events that affected other endeavors as well.

World War II raged early in the decade, and just like baseballers, many popular boxers went overseas to fight for their countries, Joe Louis, Billy Conn, Beau Jack, and Bob Montgomery among them. Louis was used to entice Americans to join the war against Germany, a couple of propaganda movies starring Louis and many propaganda posters being produced. The posters in particular are collectors&#x27; items today. Louis&#x27; great rival, Max Schmeling, a lifelong opponent of the Nazi regime, was forced by Adolf Hitler to join the German military after his loss to Louis at their 1938 rematch.

Because of the war many world championship divisions were frozen. Sometimes, a title bout was held five years after the last title bout in that division had been held.

Television was in its infancy in the 1940s, but nonetheless, viewers were treated to many 10-round, non-title fights, and many crown challengers became household names under the absence of so many world champions.

The 1940s did have some historic world title fights and rivalries. Sugar Ray Robinson and Jake LaMotta began their series of famous bouts towards the middle of the decade, Jack and Montgomery fought four times, and Rocky Graziano and Tony Zale starred in what boxing critics have often called one of the fiercest rivalries in boxing history.

The heavyweight division was dominated by Louis, the only man in history to be world champion throughout every year of a decade. He became world champion in 1937 and kept the title until 1949.

LaMotta lost a highly controversial fight to Billy Fox in 1947. LaMotta later testified he threw the fight to earn a title shot at world middleweight champion Marcel Cerdan,

<doc id="530216" wikidata="Q3001795" url="?curid=530216" title="Media coverage of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict">
<text>Media coverage of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict has been said, by both sides and independent observers, to be biased. This coverage includes news, academic discussion, film, and social media. These perceptions of bias, possibly exacerbated by the hostile media effect, have generated more complaints of partisan reporting than any other news topic and have led to a proliferation of media watchdog groups.

==Types of bias==
===The language of conflict===
Several studies have concluded that &quot;terminology bias&quot; has been a recurrent feature of coverage of the conflict, and scholars and commentators such as Yasir Suleiman argue that language manipulation plays an important role in endeavours to win over the international public, with some concluding that Israel has proven more adept in this battle. Diction, or word choice, affects the interpretation of the same set of entities or events. There is an emotional and semantic difference between the verbs &quot;died&quot; and &quot;killed,&quot; and similarly between &quot;kill&quot; and &quot;murder&quot;; &quot;murder&quot; evokes stronger negative emotions and connotes intent. In the context of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, various terminological issues arise. The terms &quot;disputed territories&quot; versus &quot;occupied territories&quot; reflect different positions on the legal status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The terms &quot;security fence&quot; and &quot;apartheid wall,&quot; &quot;neighbourhood&quot; and &quot;settlement,&quot; and &quot;militant,&quot; &quot;freedom fighter&quot; and &quot;terrorist,&quot; while used to describe the same entities, present them in a different light and suggest a different narrative. Similarly, describing an attack or bombing as a &quot;response&quot; or &quot;retaliation&quot; again places the events in a different light.

In the immediate aftermath of the Six-Day War Israeli usage initially adopted the standard terminology of referring to the West Bank and Gaza as &quot;occupied territories&quot; (&quot;ha-šeṭaḥim ha-kevušim&quot;). This was soon replaced by &quot;administered territories&quot; (&quot;ha-šeṭaḥim ha-muḥzaqim&quot;). Finally, the West Bank area, excluding East Jerusalem, was renamed &quot;Judea and Samaria&quot; (&quot;Yehudah we-Šomron&quot;), a term chosen to affirm the Biblical basis for the Jewish people&#x27;s connection to that territory. Rashid Khalidi describes how, in the wake of the Six Day War, Israeli policy-makers have designated East Jerusalem not as &quot;occupied&quot; or a cultural and spiritual centre for Muslims and Arabs for 14 centuries, but as &quot;the eternal, indivisible capital of Israel&quot; and &quot;reunited&quot;. While the default term in international law is &quot;belligerent occupation&quot;, over subsequent decades, U.S. media coverage, which initially described Israel&#x27;s presence in either of the Palestinian territories as an &quot;occupation&quot;, gradually dropped the word and by 2001 it had become &quot;almost taboo&quot; in, and &quot;ethereal in its absence&quot; from, American reportage. A poll of British newsreaders that same year found that only 9% were aware that Israel was the occupying power of Palestinian territories. Israeli academic surveys at the time of Operation Defensive Shield (2002) also found that the Israeli public thought the West Bank revolt was evidence that Palestinians were trying, murderously, to wrest control of territories within Israel itself.

In 2002, Greg Myre wrote of the rise of a &quot;verbal arms race&quot; where &quot;(m)uch of the Mideast conflict is about winning international support&quot;, one which escalated with the onset of the Al-Aqsa Intifada. Brian Whitaker, reviewing 1,659 articles covering events in the Guardian and Evening Standard for this period (2000–2001), observed the same effects, adding that omission of important adjectives was notable: 66% failed to mention that the incidents took place in an occupied territory. Hebron was described as a divided city, though 99% of its inhabitants are Palestinian, whereas Israel describes Jerusalem as &quot;undivided&quot; though a third of its inhabitants are Palestinian. Likewise, Jews live in &quot;communities&quot;, Palestinians in &quot;areas&quot;. In his view Israel had won the verbal war. In reporting the 2006 capture of Gilad Shalit on Israeli soil and his removal to the Gaza Strip, and Israel&#x27;s response of detaining 60 Hamas members, half Palestinian West Bank parliamentarians, the former was said to have been &quot;kidnapped&quot; while the latter, seized from their beds in night raids and removed to Israeli prisons, were &quot;arrested&quot;. 

According to 2008 analysis, Israeli newspaper reportage of violence, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) &quot;confirms&quot;, or &quot;says&quot;, while the Palestinians &quot;claim&quot;. The word &quot;violence&quot; itself connotes, according to Gershon Shafir, different events in Israeli and non-Israeli discourse: In the former, it is essentially dissociated from the 50-year-long practice of occupying Palestinian lands and used to refer only to an intermittent recourse to military methods to contain episodic upsurges of hostile Palestinian resistance, a means employed when the security of an otherwise peaceful state is said to be at stake. Thus, Israeli violence is restricted to responses to specific events like putting down the First and Second Intifadas, Israel&#x27;s wars in Gaza and the Palestinian knifing attacks in 2015–2016, which were mainly the work of lone wolves. Shafir argues to the contrary that the occupation &quot;is best understood as ongoing, day-in and day-out coercion, and its injuries include material, psychological, social, and bodily harm&quot;. And, he further claims, it is the coercive techniques of the institutions of occupation deployed to enforce submission that produce the occasional eruptions of &quot;military operations&quot; and wars. Violence is omnipresent reality for Palestinians, on the other hand, and found in all facets of the occupation. Consequently, he concludes, the most intense suppression of uprisings and wars cannot be considered in isolation from the occupation regime as an everyday experience.

Such omissions and alterations in the terms used are cited as an example of the pervasive use of euphemisms or loaded terminology in reportage on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a problem which the International Press Institute thought sufficiently important by 2013 to issue a handbook to guide journalists through the semantic minefield. What Palestinians call &quot;assassinations&quot; – the shooting of people suspected of terrorism – Israel first called &quot;pre-emptive strikes&quot;, then &quot;pinpoint preventive operations&quot;, and also &quot;extrajudicial punishments&quot; or &quot;long-range hot pursuit&quot; until &quot;focused prevention&quot; was finally settled on. Offers to return &quot;occupied territory&quot; are &quot;(painful) concessions&quot; rather than a compliance with international law. For decades, Israeli announcements, speaking of arrests of children, never used the word &quot;child&quot;. Even a 10-year-old shot by the IDF could be referred to as &quot;a young man of ten.&quot; The use of the term &quot;colonialism&quot; by New Historians to describe Zionist settlement, a term likening the process to the French colonization of Algeria and the Dutch settlement of South Africa, has likewise been challenged, with some asserting that this is a demonizing term used in Palestinian textbooks. Robert Fisk argues that the descriptive language used by major political players and the press to describe the occupation is one of &quot;&quot;: occupied lands become &quot;disputed territories&quot;; colonies are described as &quot;settlements&quot;, &quot;neighbourhoods&quot; &quot;suburbs&quot;, &quot;population centres&quot;; dispossession and exile are referred to as &quot;dislocation&quot;/&quot;displacement&quot;; Israelis are shot by &quot;terrorists&quot; but when Palestinians are shot dead they die in &quot;clashes&quot;; the Wall becomes a &quot;fence&quot; or &quot;security barrier&quot;. Suicide bombers for Palestinians are &quot;martyrs&quot; (&quot;shahid&quot;); Israel prefers &quot;homicide bombers&quot;. Israel calls one of its uses of Palestinians as human shields a &quot;neighbour procedure&quot;. If children are killed by Israeli fire, these events are often contextualized by the &quot;shop-worn euphemism&quot; (Fisk) of their being &quot;caught in the crossfire&quot;. Deporting West Bankers to Gaza, which Myre describes as collective punishment for families who have siblings that participated in terror incidents, is described by Israel as an &quot;order limiting the place of residency&quot;. Israeli military actions are customarily referred to as &quot;responses&quot; or &quot;retaliations&quot; to a Palestinian attack, even if it is Israel that strikes first.

The Intercept reported that in October 2024, on the outbreak of the Israel–Hamas war, an internal memo written by Philip Pan and other senior &quot;New York Times&quot; editors instructed the paper&#x27;s journalists to restrict, or avoid or refrain generally from using the terms genocide, ethnic cleansing, occupied territory, Palestine, and refugee camps.

===Media and academic coverage===
The quality of both Media coverage of the Arab–Israeli conflict and research and debates on university campuses have been the object of extensive monitoring and research. Public discussion of the occupation is also contested, especially on university campuses. Pro-Israeli Jewish students complain that they have been vilified or harassed; some proposed talks on Palestinian perspectives have been cancelled on the grounds that audiences might not be able to objectively evaluate the material. In response to attempts to silence several high-profile critics of Israeli territorial policies concerns have been expressed that the topic itself is at risk, and that the political pressures restricting research and discussion undermine academic freedom. In the latter regard, organizations like Campus Watch closely report and denounce what they consider &quot;anti-Israeli&quot; attitudes. In addition to Israel&#x27;s hasbara organization, intent on countering negative press images, there are also many private pro-Israeli organizations, among them CAMERA, FLAME, HonestReporting, Palestinian Media Watch and the Anti-Defamation League which subject reportage to scrutiny in the belief news on Israel has systematically distorted reality to privilege Palestinian versions. In Ehud Barak&#x27;s view Palestinians are &quot;products of a culture in which to tell a lie..creates no dissonance&quot;. Others allow that both sides lie, but &quot;Arabs&quot; are better at it. The term Pallywood was coined to suggest that Palestinian coverage of their plight, in a genre called &quot;traumatic realism&quot;, is marked by a diffuse intent to fraudulently manipulate the media, beginning with the killing of Mohammad Durrah, and, it has been argued, still being evoked as late as 2014 to dismiss Israeli responsibility for the Beitunia killings. The idea has been dismissed as bearing the hallmarks of a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;. 

In university settings, organizations like Campus Watch closely report and denounce what they consider &quot;anti-Israeli&quot; attitudes. Academics like Sara Roy have argued on the other hand that &quot;the climate of intimidation and censorship surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, both inside (at all levels of the education hierarchy) and outside the U.S. academy, is real and longstanding&quot;.
On the other hand, book-length studies have been devoted to testing the theory that the world&#x27;s understanding of the conflict, though &quot;mediated by Israeli newspapers to a domestic audience&quot;, is &quot;anti-Israel&quot;. Attempts have been made to silence several high-profile critics of Israeli policies in the territories, among them Tony Judt, Norman Finkelstein, Joseph Massad, Nadia Abu El-Haj and William I. Robinson. Such difficulties have given rise to anxieties that the topic itself is at risk, and that the political pressures circumscribing research and discussion undermine academic freedom itself.

Internal Israeli studies have argued that local press coverage has traditionally been conservative, reflecting the often tendentious and biased views of the political and military establishment, and similar tendencies have been noted in Palestinian reportage. In a sample of 48 reports of 22 Palestinian deaths, 40 Israeli accounts only gave the IDF version, a mere 8 included a Palestinian reaction. Tamar Liebes, former director of the Smart Institute of Communication at the Hebrew University, argued that Israeli &quot;Journalists and publishers see themselves as actors within the Zionist movement, not as critical outsiders&quot;. The explosive expansion of the Internet has opened up a larger sphere of controversy. Digital forensics flourishing on social networks have occasionally revealed problems with a few widely circulating images of dead Palestinians, but, according to Kuntzman and Stein, technical suspicion quickly yielded ground, among Israeli Jewish social media practitioners who combined a politics of militant nationalism with global networking conventions, to unfounded polemical claims, making out that, &#x27;the fraudulent, deceiving Palestinian was a &quot;natural condition&quot; that required no substantiation&#x27;, and that, generically, images of dead or injured Palestinians were faked. Palestinians commonly use the phrases &quot;gang of settlers&quot; or &quot;herd of settlers&quot; to refer to Israeli settlers, expressions perceived as offensive and dehumanising because &quot;gang&quot; implies thuggish criminality (though some Palestinians view settlers as criminals) and &quot;herd&quot; uses animal imagery to refer to people. A former vice president of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs in the United States has remarked that many rabbis themselves address their congregations by tiptoeing around the topic of Israel and Palestine, and that there is a widespread fear that speaking forthrightly will make their community life and careers insecure.

John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt have argued that &quot;the American media&#x27;s coverage of Israel tends to be strongly biased in Israel&#x27;s favour&quot; compared to reportage in other democratic countries&#x27; media, with a tendency to marginalize anyone who voices a critical attitude. A 2001 study concluded that press coverage had highlighted violent displays and demonstrations of Palestinian grievances as if it were Palestinians who &quot;looked for a confrontation&quot;, but consistently failed to add any context of the systematic abuses to which they are subjected. Marda Dunsky argues that empirical work appears to support Mearsheimer and Walt&#x27;s claim. She concluded that coverage of (a) the refugee problem; (b) settlements; (c) the historical and political background, (which are either frequently skimmed over or entirely omitted), and (d) violence, &quot;reflects the parameters of U.S. Middle East policy&quot;, regarding both U.S. aid and support for Israel. This view that American media are biased towards Palestinians has been challenged by authors who cite research that concluded most mainstream media have a &quot;liberal&quot; bias, a criticism extended to European outlets like &quot;Le Monde&quot; and the BBC.

According to Israeli historian Ilan Pappe, it is better to talk about the Palestinian resistance and decolonisation of Palestine from the river to the sea, instead of using the misleading language of the American and Western media such as &quot;Iran-backed terrorist group Hamas&quot; or &quot;peace process&quot;. Universities and mainstream media still refuse to define the Zionist project as a colonial project, or as it is more accurately called a settler-colonial project, according to him.

====Retaliation====
A study by the American organization Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting monitored the use of the term &quot;retaliation&quot; in the nightly news broadcasts of the three main American networks CBS, ABC, and NBC between September 2000 through March 17, 2002. It found that of the 150 occasions when &quot;retaliate&quot; and its variants were used to describe attacks in the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, 79 percent were references to Israel &quot;retaliating&quot; and only 9 percent were references to Palestinians &quot;retaliating&quot;.

====Emotive language====
In a 2004 study of BBC television news coverage, the Glasgow Media Group documented differences in the language used by journalists for Israelis and Palestinians. The study found that terms such as &quot;atrocity,&quot; &quot;brutal murder,&quot; &quot;mass murder,&quot; &quot;savage cold blooded killing,&quot; &quot;lynching&quot; and &quot;slaughter&quot; were used to describe the death of Israelis but not the death of Palestinians. The word &quot;terrorist&quot; was often used to describe Palestinians. However, in reports of an Israeli group attempting to bomb a Palestinian school, members of the Israeli group were referred to as &quot;extremists&quot; or &quot;vigilantes&quot; but not as &quot;terrorists.&quot;

A study by openDemocracy found that in BBC coverage of the Israel-Hamas war from 7 October to 4 November, the word &quot;massacre&quot; was only used to describe Israeli deaths, despite a larger number of Palestinians being killed.

===Omission===
A 2001 study by Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting (FAIR) found only 4% of US network news reports concerning Gaza or the West Bank mentioned that these are occupied territories. The figure was cited in the 2003 documentary &quot;Peace, Propaganda &amp; the Promised Land&quot;, screened by the Canadian Broadcasting Company (CBC) in 2008. CBC&#x27;s French-language radio ombud questioned the independence of FAIR&#x27;s research, referring to the group as a “pro-Palestinian” and “militant group.” FAIR responded by updating their analysis for the 2008-09 period, finding that number had gone down to only 2% of network news programs about Gaza or the West Bank mentioning an occupation.

===Lack of verification===
The ethics and standards of journalism require journalists to verify the factual accuracy of the information they report. Factual verification&quot; is what separates journalism from other modes of communication, such as propaganda, fiction or entertainment&quot;. Lack of verification involves the publication of potentially unreliable information prior to or without independent confirmation of the facts, and has resulted in various scandals. In the context of the Israel-Palestinian conflict, for example, consider:
*The Battle of Jenin, after which early media reports claimed that Israel &quot;massacred&quot; hundreds of Palestinian civilians. Later investigations by the United Nations and Human Rights Watch estimated the total Palestinian death toll at 52 (with estimates of civilian deaths ranging from 22 to 26) and contradicted previous claims that a massacre had taken place.
*The Islamic Jihad shooting attack on Kiryat Arba in November 2002, which Western media reports described as an attack on &quot;worshipers,&quot; resulting in international condemnations. According to the Jerusalem Post, Islamic Jihad &quot;opened fire at a [sic] security forces safeguarding Jewish worshipers,&quot; and according to both Haaretz and the Jerusalem Post, the twelve Israelis killed all belonged to the IDF, the Israeli Border Police, or the Hebron security force.
In a 2021 analysis of Austrian media reporting on the conflict, political scientist Florian Markl found that such failures of verification disproportionately affected Israel, with these failures consistently and incorrectly presenting Israel as the aggressor or Palestine as the victim.

===Selective reporting===
Selective reporting involves devoting more resources, such as news articles or air time, to the coverage of one side of the story over another.

A former AP correspondent Matti Friedman criticised the media for ignoring certain aspects of the conflict (such as Ehud Olmert&#x27;s peace offer, the corruption of the Palestinian Authority, the Hamas charter and the intimidation of reporters by Hamas) for political reasons.
===Disproportionate coverage===

A former AP correspondent Matti Friedman criticised the media for focusing on the Arab-Israeli conflict in the disproportionate manner compared to other conflicts with more casualties, citing the example of his former employer having more staff in Israel and Palestine than in the whole of Africa, China or India.

===False compromise===

False compromise refers to the claim, made by some Israeli advocates and by some Palestinian advocates, that their side of the conflict is morally right and the other side is morally wrong and, therefore, attempts to balance the presentation of both viewpoints wrongfully suggests that both sides are morally equivalent. In the words of journalist Bret Stephens, &quot;Moral clarity is a term that doesn&#x27;t get much traction these days, least of all among journalists, who prefer &#x27;objectivity&#x27; and &#x27;balance.&#x27; Yet good journalism is more than about separating fact from opinion and being fair. Good journalism is about fine analysis and making distinctions, and this applies as much to moral distinctions as to any others. Because too many reporters today refuse to make moral distinctions, we are left with a journalism whose narrative and analytical failings have become ever more glaring&quot;.

===U.S. media bias===

Research indicates that major U.S. news outlets often portray the Gaza war in a manner that favors Israeli viewpoints. A study analyzing over 1,000 articles from prominent newspapers such as &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; found a consistent bias against Palestinians. These publications disproportionately emphasized Israeli casualties, employed emotive language to describe Israeli suffering, and provided extensive coverage of antisemitic incidents in the U.S., while largely overlooking anti-Muslim racism following significant events.

The perceived imbalance in reporting has prompted responses from within the journalistic community. In 2021, over 500 journalists signed an open letter expressing concerns about U.S. media’s neglect of Israel’s oppression of Palestinians. This movement gained momentum in 2023, with more than 1,500 journalists from various U.S. news organizations signing a letter protesting Western media’s coverage of Israeli actions against Palestinians.

==Reasons for bias==
===Coercion or censorship===
Coercion or censorship refers to the use of intimidation or force to promote favorable reports and to confiscate unfavorable reports. In the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, both sides accuse each other of coercion or censorship as an explanation of alleged bias in favor of the other side. In support of these claims, Israeli advocates point to kidnappings of foreign reporters by Palestinians, while Palestinian advocates point to media blackouts and confiscation of reports by Israelis. Additionally, both sides point to reports by both governmental and non-governmental organizations, which assess the degree of journalistic freedom in the region. See Media of Israel and Human rights in Israel#Freedom of speech and the media.

===Prejudiced journalists===
Journalists may intentionally or unintentionally distort reports due to political ideology, national affiliation, antisemitism, anti-Arabism, or Islamophobia.

Richard Falk, United Nations special rapporteur on Palestinian human rights, has stated that in the media-distorted picture surrounding the Middle East, those who reports honestly and factually are accused of bias, whereas pro-Israel bias is perceived as mainstream. Falk has stated that because the media don&#x27;t adequately report violations of international law by Israel, &quot;the American public isn&#x27;t aware of the behavior of Israel or the victimization of the Palestinian people. This creates a kind of imbalance.&quot; Ira Stoll of the &quot;New York Sun&quot;, and formerly of the &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot;, attributes alleged anti-Israel media bias in part to reporters of Jewish background.

It has also been reported that many journalists in Gaza who identify as independent are instead affiliated with Hamas, who gives them support to do their jobs such as cars, drivers, internet access, and shelter in hospitals during wartime, and in exchange monitors their work to ensure that they present Hamas&#x27; version of the conflict. These journalists are then quoted by western news sources without identifying their affiliation with Hamas.

==Contentious incidents==
To substantiate claims that the media favors the other side, participants in the conflict on each side frequently cite a number of illustrative and extreme examples of controversial reporting. This section lists incidents of controversial reporting frequently cited by only Israelis and Israel advocates, by only Palestinians and Palestinian advocates, or by both sides. The list of incidents appear chronologically, according to when the incident took place. Where events took place on the same date, the incidents appear sorted alphabetically.
===Muhammad al-Durrah affair===

On September 30, 2000, the 11- to 12-year-old boy, Muhammad al-Durrah, was shot in Palestinian-Israeli crossfire at the Netzarim junction. France 2, which caught the incident on tape, claimed that Israel had fatally shot the boy. After an official, internal investigation, the IDF conceded that it was probably responsible and apologized for the shooting. Al-Durrah became a symbol of the Second Intifada and of Palestinian martyrdom.

External investigations suggested that the IDF could not have shot the boy and that the tape had been staged. In 2001, following a non-military investigation, conducted by Israeli Southern Command Maj.-Gen. Yom Tov Samia, the Israeli Prime Minister&#x27;s Foreign Media Advisor, Dr. Ra&#x27;anan Gissin, along with Daniel Seaman of the Israeli Government Press Office (GPO) publicly challenged the accuracy of the France 2 report. In 2005, the head of the Israeli National Security Agency, Major-General (res.) Giora Eiland publicly retracted the IDF&#x27;s initial admittance of responsibility. To avoid negative publicity and a resulting backlash, the IDF did not conduct its own official, military investigation until 2007. On October 1, 2007, Israel officially denied responsibility for the shooting and claimed that the France 2 footage had been staged, prompting criticism from Al-Durrah&#x27;s father.

However, in early 2012, Dr. David Yehudah was sued by al-Dura&#x27;s father and was acquitted in French court.

The French defamation case was definitely settled on June 26, 2013, by the French Court of Appeals: Philippe Karsenty was convicted of defamation and fined €7,000 by the Paris Court of Appeals. Karsenty&#x27;s version, which described the killing of young Mohammed Al Durah as &quot;staged&quot;, was rejected by the French Court&#x27;s final decision.

===Photo of Tuvia Grossman===

On September 30, 2000, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the Associated Press, and other media outlets published a photograph of a club-wielding Israeli police officer standing over a battered and bleeding young man. The photograph&#x27;s caption identified the young man as a Palestinian and the location as the Temple Mount. The young man in the picture was 20-year-old Tuvia Grossman, a Jewish American student from Chicago who had been studying at a Yeshiva in Israel; the Israeli police officer in the photograph, actually came to his rescue by threatening his Palestinian assailants.

After a complaint by Grossman&#x27;s father, &quot;The New York Times&quot; issued a correction on October 4. A few days later the &quot;Times&quot; published an article about the incident and printed a more complete correction. The &quot;Times&quot; attributed the error to a misidentification by the Israeli agency that took the photo compounded by a further misidentification by the Associated Press &quot;which had received many pictures of injured Palestinians that day&quot;.

More than 20 years after the incident, the Grossman photo is cited as one of the most infamous examples of distorted media coverage in the Israel-Palestine conflict. Instead of showing Israeli aggression against a Palestinian, what the photo really showed was a Jewish victim of a brutal attack committed by Arabs. The episode is often cited by those who accuse the media of having an anti-Israel bias, and was the impetus for the founding of pro-Israel media watchdog HonestReporting.

Seth Ackerman of FAIR described the attention given to the photo, as well as the two &quot;NYT&quot; corrections, as disproportionate to a &quot;plausible, though careless&quot; assumption resulting from &quot;garbled information from the Israeli photographer&quot;.

===Battle of Jenin===
On April 3, 2002, following the Passover massacre on March 27 which killed 30 Israeli civilians and wounded as many as 143, the IDF began a major military operation in the Jenin refugee camp, a city which, according to Israel, had &quot;served as a launching site for numerous terrorist attacks against both Israeli civilians and Israeli towns and villages in the area&quot;. The fighting, which lasted eight days and resulted in the deaths of 52 Palestinians (including 14 civilians, according to the IDF, and 22 civilians, according to HRW) and 23 Israeli soldiers, has been interpreted quite differently by Israelis and Palestinians. In the aftermath of the fighting, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat claimed that the IDF had killed 500 Palestinians and accused Israel of committing a &quot;massacre&quot;. Early news publications, following both IDF estimates of 200 Palestinians killed and Palestinian estimates of 500 Palestinians killed, reported hundreds of Palestinian deaths and repeated claims that a massacre had taken place. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International later found that no massacre had taken place, although both organizations charged the IDF with war crimes and human rights violations. The United Nations similarly dismissed claims that hundreds of Palestinians had been killed as unsubstantiated, a finding which was widely interpreted and reported as rejecting claims of a &quot;massacre&quot;.

Israelis cite the reporting surrounding the Battle of Jenin Palestinian allegations that a massacre had taken place, a claim disputed by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.

===Gaza beach blast===

On June 9, 2006, an explosion on a beach in the Gaza Strip killed seven Palestinians, including three children. Palestinian sources claimed that the explosion resulted from Israeli shelling. After a three-day investigation, Israel concluded that the blast could not have resulted from an IDF artillery shell. This IDF investigation was criticized by both Human Rights Watch and &quot;The Guardian&quot; for ignoring evidence. The IDF agreed that the report should have mentioned two gunboat shells fired at about the time of the deaths but stated that these shells had landed too far away from the area to be the cause of the explosion and this omission did not impact the report&#x27;s overall conclusion that Israel had not been responsible for the blast. According to Human Rights Watch, the IDF acknowledged that the cause of the blast may have been an unexploded 155mm artillery shell from an earlier shelling, or another location, but suggested it might have been placed there as an IED by Palestinians.

An investigation by Human Rights Watch concluded that the explosion was caused by a 155mm Israeli artillery shell, stating that &#x27;The shrapnel, crater, and injuries all point to this weapon as the cause.&#x27;

===2006 Lebanon War photographs controversies===
On August 5, 2006 Charles Foster Johnson of Little Green Footballs accused Reuters of inappropriately manipulating images of destruction to Beirut caused by Israel during the Second Lebanon War. In response to these allegations, Reuters toughened its photo editing policy and admitted to inappropriate photo manipulation on the part of Adnan Hajj, a freelance photographer whom Reuters subsequently fired. Additionally, BBC, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and the Associated Press recalled photos or corrected captions in response to some of the accusations. This journalistic scandal, dubbed &quot;Reutersgate&quot; by the blogosphere in reference to the Watergate scandal and is frequently cited by Israelis and by Israel advocates to demonstrate alleged anti-Israel bias, this time in the form of an outright forgery created by a biased local freelance photographer.

===&quot;Mystery of Israel&#x27;s Secret Uranium Bomb&quot;===
On October 28, 2006, &quot;The Independent&quot; published an article, by Robert Fisk, which speculated, based on information from the European Committee on Radiation Risk, that Israel may have used depleted uranium weapons during the 2006 Lebanon War. The article prompted criticism by HonestReporting for coming to conclusions prematurely, and resulted in an investigation by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). On November 8, 2006, UNEP concluded that Israel had not used any form of uranium-based weapons. Israelis and Israel advocates cite the article as an instance of &quot;shoddy journalism&quot;, arising allegedly as a result of media sensationalism.

===Samir Kuntar as a hero===
On July 19, 2008, Al Jazeera TV broadcast a program from Lebanon that covered the &quot;welcome-home&quot; festivities for Samir Kuntar, a Lebanese militant who had been imprisoned in Israel for murdering several people, including a four-year-old child, in a Palestine Liberation Front raid from Lebanon into Israel. In the program, the head of Al Jazeera&#x27;s Beirut office, Ghassan bin Jiddo, praised Kuntar as a &quot;pan-Arab hero&quot; and organized a birthday party for him. In response, Israel&#x27;s Government Press Office (GPO) threatened to boycott the satellite channel unless it apologized. A few days later an official letter was issued by Al Jazeera&#x27;s director general, Wadah Khanfar, in which he admitted that the program violated the station&#x27;s Code of Ethics and that he had ordered the channel&#x27;s programming director to take steps to ensure that such an incident does not recur.

===Baby death date misrepresentation===
A Gaza man falsely claimed that his five-month-old baby died on March 23, 2012, when the generator powering his respirator ran out of fuel, a result of the Egyptian blockade on Gaza and Egyptian cut-off of fuel to Gaza. The baby&#x27;s death, which had been &quot;confirmed&quot; by a Gaza health official, would have been the first to be connected with the territory&#x27;s energy shortage. The baby&#x27;s father, Abdul-Halim Helou, said that his son Mohammed was born with a lymphatic disorder and needed removal of the fluids that accumulated in his respiratory system, and had only a few months to live. He said that they had erred in how much fuel was required and that if they had been &quot;living in a normal country with electricity&quot;, his son&#x27;s chances of living longer would have been better.

However, the report was called into question when it emerged that the timing of the baby&#x27;s death had been misrepresented, and appeared to be an attempt by Gaza&#x27;s Hamas rulers to exploit the death to gain sympathy. The Associated Press later learned that news of Mohammed Helou&#x27;s death had already appeared on March 4 in the local Arabic newspaper Al-Quds and that Hamas was now trying to recycle the story to capitalize on the family&#x27;s tragedy. The Al-Quds article contained the same details as the later report, but with an earlier date. When confronted by the Associated Press, the family and Hamas official Bassem al-Qadri continued to insist that the baby had only recently died. The AP reporter Diaa Hadid tweeted, &quot;#Hamas misrepresented a story. Two Hamas officials misled us and so did the family.&quot;

The Associated Press then retracted the story, explaining that &quot;The report has been called into question after it was learned that a local newspaper carried news of the baby&#x27;s death on March 4.&quot;

An Israeli government spokesman said he was not surprised by Hamas&#x27; attempt to &quot;hide the truth and manipulate the information that is allowed to get out of Gaza.&quot;

===Gaza floods caused by opening dams in Israel===

Gaza is a coastal plain, bordering the Negev desert which witnesses flash floods during heavy rains as water runs across the surface of the impervious desert soil. During the 2013 winter storm in the Middle east Ma&#x27;an News Agency reported that Israel opened dams, leading to Gaza floods. However, no such dams actually exist.

=== Gazan paramedic killed by the Israeli army ===
Razan Ashraf Abdul Qadir al-Najjar was a nurse/paramedic who was killed by the Israeli army while volunteering as a medic during the 2018 Gaza border protests. She was fatally shot in the chest by an Israeli soldier as she, reportedly with her arms raised to show she was unarmed, tried to help evacuate the wounded near Israel&#x27;s border fence with Gaza.

The Israeli army released footage in which she purportedly admitted to participating in the protests as a human shield, supposedly at the request of Hamas. The video was later found to be a clip from an interview with a Lebanese television station that had been edited by the IDF to misleadingly take al-Najjar&#x27;s comments out of context. In the actual, unedited video, she made no mention of Hamas, and called herself a &quot;rescuing human shield to protect and save the wounded at the front lines&quot;, with everything following &quot;human shield&quot; trimmed out of the Israeli clip. The IDF was widely criticized for tampering with the video to chip away at her image.

==Films==
This section discusses films with media coverage of the Arab-Israeli conflict as its main topic. The films presented in this section appear in alphabetical order.

===&quot;Décryptage&quot;===

&quot;Décryptage&quot; is a 2003 documentary written by Jacques Tarnero and directed by Philippe Bensoussan. The French film (with English subtitles) examines media coverage of the Arab–Israeli conflict in French media, and claims that the media&#x27;s presentation of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict in France is consistently skewed against Israel and may be responsible for exacerbating anti-Semitism.

===&quot;Peace, Propaganda, and the Promised Land&quot;===

&quot;Peace, Propaganda, and the Promised Land&quot; is a 2004 documentary by Sut Jhally and Bathsheba Ratzkoff. The movie claims that the influence of pro-Israel media watchdog groups, such as CAMERA and Honest Reporting, leads to distorted and pro-Israel media reports. In its response to the movie, the pro-Israel JCRC criticizes the film for not discussing the influence of &quot;the numerous pro‐Palestinian media watchdog groups, including, ironically, FAIR (Fair and Accuracy in the Media, which describes itself as &#x27;A National Media Watch Group&#x27;), whose spokesperson played a prominent role in the film&quot;. According to the pro-Palestinian &quot;LiP Magazine&quot;, the movie &quot;offers a great starting point for thinking about media misrepresentation of the Israel-Palestinian conflict, and useful analysis of how language is used to manipulate public opinion,&quot; but is short on &quot;solid statistics and facts to back up some of its blanket statements&quot;. A review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; by Ned Martel found that the film &quot;largely ignores Palestinian leadership, which has surely played a part in the conflict&#x27;s broken vows and broken hearts. And such a lack of dispassion weakens the one-sided film&#x27;s bold and detailed argument&quot;.

==Internet and social media==

Advocacy groups, governments and individuals use the Internet, new media and social media to try to influence public perceptions of both sides in the Arab/Palestinian–Israeli conflict. &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot; writer Megan Jacobs has written &quot;War in the Middle East is being waged not only on the ground, but also in cyberspace.&quot; While Israeli and Palestinian advocacy websites promote their respective points of view, fierce debate over the Arab–Israeli conflict has embroiled social networking websites and applications with user-generated content, such as Facebook, Google Earth, Twitter and Wikipedia. According to an Associated Press article, Israelis and Palestinians make use of social media to promote &quot;rival narratives&quot; and draw attention to their own suffering to gain international sympathy and backing. However, &quot;distortions and mistakes are instantly magnified on a global scale.&quot;

===Facebook===
Facebook is a social networking website, which allows users to connect and interact with other people online, both directly by &quot;friending&quot; people and indirectly through the creation of groups. Because the website allows users to join networks organized by city, workplace, school, and region, Facebook has become embroiled in a number of regional conflicts. Facebook groups such as &quot;&#x27;Palestine&#x27; Is not a country... De-list it from Facebook as a country!&quot; and &quot;Israel is not a country! ... Delist it from Facebook as a country!&quot;, among others reflecting the mutual non-recognition of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, have protested Facebook&#x27;s listing of Israel and Palestine, respectively, as countries. This controversy became particularly heated when, in response to protests over Palestine being listed as a country, Facebook delisted it. The move infuriated Palestinian users and prompted the creation of numerous Facebook groups such as &quot;The Official Petition to get Palestine listed as a Country&quot;, &quot;Against delisting Palestine from Facebook&quot;, and &quot;If Palestine is removed from Facebook ... I&#x27;m closing my account&quot;. Facebook, in response to user complaints, ultimately reinstated Palestine as a country network. A similar controversy took place regarding the status of Israeli settlements. When Israeli settlements were moved from being listed under the Israel network to the Palestine network, thousands of Israelis living in the area protested Facebook&#x27;s decision. In response to the protest, Facebook has allowed users living in the area to select either Israel or Palestine as their home country.

Another controversy over Facebook regarding the Arab-Israeli conflict concerns Facebook groups which, against Facebook&#x27;s terms of use, promote hatred and violence. According to former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, Facebook has been used to promote anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism. A proliferation of Facebook groups praising the perpetrator of the Mercaz HaRav massacre in 2008 prompted the creation of the Facebook group &quot;FACEBOOK: Why do you support Anti-Semitism and Islamic Terrorism&quot;, which claimed to have succeeded in deleting over 100 pro-Palestinian Facebook groups with violent content, by reporting the groups to Facebook. The group, which since evolved into the Jewish Internet Defense Force, took over the Facebook group &quot;Israel is not a country! Delist it from Facebook as a country&quot; when, according to the JIDF, Facebook stopped removing such groups. After taking over the group, the JIDF began to remove its more than 48,000 members and replaced the group&#x27;s graphic with a picture of an IAF jet with the flag of Israel in the background. This sparked controversy.

===Twitter===
According to a McClatchy news article, those using social media, including even official spokesmen and public officials, have a habit of &quot;re-purposing&quot; older photographs and videos to illustrate current-day events. Few people check the accuracy of the material before spreading it to others. During the March 2012 Gaza–Israel clashes there were three such notable Twitter incidents. Ofir Gendelman, a spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, tweeted a photo of an Israeli woman and her two children ducking a Gaza rocket describing it as &quot;when a rocket fired by terrorists from Gaza is about to hit their home.&quot; When it was proved the photo was from 2009 he said &quot;I never stated that the photo was current. It illustrates the fear that people in southern Israel live in.&quot; Avital Leibovich, the head of the foreign desk for Israel&#x27;s military, sent a tweet from her official account of a video of rockets from Gaza being fired at Israel. It later was discovered the video had been taken in October 2011. When questioned she said her tweet was not misleading and &quot;Launching a rocket does not differ whether it happened in November, July or now&quot;.

Leibovich was one of a number of bloggers who criticized Khulood Badawi, an Information and Media Coordinator for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs who tweeted a picture of a Palestinian child covered in blood. She captioned it &quot;Another child killed by #Israel... Another father carrying his child to a grave in #Gaza.&quot; It was discovered the picture was published in 2006 and was of a Palestinian girl who had died in an accident and been brought to the hospital shortly after an Israeli air strike in Gaza. Israel&#x27;s Ambassador to the United Nations Ron Prosor called for Badawi&#x27;s dismissal, stating that she was &quot;directly engaged in spreading misinformation&quot;. Humanitarian Coordinator and the Head of Office in Jerusalem later met with officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Israel to discuss these events. UN Under-Secretary General Valerie Amos wrote, &quot;It is regrettable that an OCHA staff member has posted information on her personal Twitter profile, which is both false and which reflects on issues that are related to her work.&quot;

A few days later Badawi tweeted on her personal account &quot;Correction: I tweeted the photo believing it was from the last round of violence &amp; it turned out to be from 2006 This is my personal account.&quot; Ma&#x27;an News Agency reported a week later that the hospital medical report on the dead girl stated that she died &quot;due to falling from a high area during the Israeli strike on Gaza&quot;. There are differing accounts of how the Israeli air strike, reported to be as little as 100 meters away, may have caused the accident.

In the immediate aftermath of the 2021 Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Associated Press reporter Emily Wilder was fired because of tweets made during the conflict, after right-wing media sources complained of her pro-Palestinian views.

===Wikipedia===

Wikipedia is an online, collaboratively written encyclopedia. While editing conflicts occur frequently, one particular conflict, involving CAMERA and &quot;The Electronic Intifada,&quot; was reported in &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; and the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; (&quot;IHT&quot;). When CAMERA encouraged individuals sympathetic to Israel to participate in editing Wikipedia to &quot;lead to more accuracy and fairness on Wikipedia&quot;, &quot;The Electronic Intifada&quot; accused CAMERA of &quot;orchestrating a secret, long-term campaign to infiltrate the popular online encyclopedia Wikipedia to rewrite Palestinian history, pass off crude propaganda as fact, and take over Wikipedia administrative structures to ensure these changes go either undetected or unchallenged.&quot; The accusations led to administrative actions on Wikipedia—including the banning of certain editors. In a separate article entitled &quot;The Wild West of Wikipedia&quot;, which appeared in &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; and IMRA, Gilead Ini of CAMERA decried &quot;Wikipedia&#x27;s often-skewed entries about the Middle East&quot;, described Wikipedia&#x27;s rules as &quot;shoddily enforced&quot;, and wrote that, following the incident, &quot;many editors who hoped to ensure accuracy and balance ... are now banned&quot; while &quot;partisan editors ... continue to freely manipulate Wikipedia articles to their liking&quot;.

Two Israeli right-wing groups, the Yesha Council and My Israel, launched a project to increase the dissemination of pro-Israel views on Wikipedia. The project organiser, Ayelet Shaked, emphasized that the information has to be reliable and meet Wikipedia rules. &quot;The idea is not to make Wikipedia rightist but for it to include our point of view,&quot; said Naftali Bennett, the director of the Yesha Council. In this vein, the groups taught a course on how to edit Wikipedia. The Yesha Council also launched a new prize, &quot;Best Zionist Editor,&quot; to be awarded to the most productive editor on Israel-related topics.

In 2013, news outlets including &quot;Haaretz&quot; and France24 reported the indefinite block of an editor who had concealed the fact that he was an employee of right-wing media group NGO Monitor. The editor was reported to have edited English Wikipedia articles on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict &quot;in an allegedly biased manner&quot;.

<doc id="530217" wikidata="Q5377228" url="?curid=530217" title="Energy value of coal">
<text>The energy value of [[coal]], or fuel content, is the amount of potential energy coal contains that can be converted into heat. This value can be calculated and compared with different grades of coal and other combustible materials, which produce different amounts of heat according to their grade.

While chemistry provides ways of calculating the heating value of a certain amount of a substance, there is a difference between this theoretical value and its application to real coal. The grade of a sample of coal does not precisely define its chemical composition, so calculating the coal&#x27;s actual usefulness as a fuel requires determining its proximate and ultimate analysis (see &quot;Chemical Composition&quot; below).

==Chemical composition==
Chemical composition of the coal is defined in terms of its proximate and ultimate (elemental) analyses. The parameters of proximate analysis are moisture, volatile matter, ash, and fixed carbon. Elemental or ultimate analysis encompasses the quantitative determination of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur and oxygen within the coal. Additionally, specific physical and mechanical properties of coal and particular carbonization properties 

The calorific value &quot;&quot;Q&quot;&quot; of coal [kJ/kg] is the heat liberated by its complete combustion with oxygen. &quot;Q&quot; is a complex function of the elemental composition of the coal. &quot;Q&quot; can be determined experimentally using calorimeters. Dulong suggests the following approximate formula for &quot;Q&quot; when the oxygen content is less than 10%: 

:&quot;Q&quot; = 337&quot;C&quot; + 1442(&quot;H&quot; - &quot;O&quot;/8) + 93&quot;S&quot;,

where &quot;C&quot; is the mass percent of carbon, &quot;H&quot; is the mass percent of hydrogen, &quot;O&quot; is the mass percent of oxygen, and &quot;S&quot; is the mass percent of sulfur in the coal. With these constants, &quot;Q&quot; is given in kilojoules per kilogram.

<text>Mount Tai () is a mountain of historical and cultural significance located north of the city of Tai&#x27;an. It is the highest point in Shandong province, China. The tallest peak is the &quot;Jade Emperor Peak&quot; (), which is commonly reported as being tall.

Mount Tai is known as the eastern mountain of the Sacred Mountains of China. It is associated with sunrise, birth, and renewal, and is often regarded the foremost of the five. Mount Tai has been a place of worship for at least 3,000 years and served as one of the most important ceremonial centers of China during large portions of this period. Because of its sacred importance and dramatic landscape, it was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987. It meets 7 of the 10 evaluation standards of World Heritage, and is listed as a World Heritage site that meets the most standards, along with the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area in Australia.

An earthquake or thunderstorm occurred in Mount Tai in 1831 BC or 1652 BC, also known as Mount Tai earthquake. This event was first recorded in the &quot;Bamboo Annals&quot;, and at present, it is recognized by most scholars as the first recorded earthquake in Chinese history.

==Location==

Mount Tai is located in western Shandong, just north of the city of Tai&#x27;an and to the south of the provincial capital Jinan. It extends from above sea level and covers an area of at its base. The Jade Emperor Peak, which rises } above sea level, is located at 36° 16′N and 117° 6′E.

=== Geological origin speculation ===
Mount Tai was formed in the middle of the Cenozoic about 30 million years ago. The stratum of Mount Tai is ancient, mainly composed of several ancient rocks such as mixed rock, mixed granite and various gneiss.
The government prevented exploration of the caves, for they are unassessed and potentially dangerous. 
The Luxi region (including Mount Tai) used to be a huge subsiding belt or sea canal. The orogeny made the rock layers on the subsidence zone folded and uplifted into ancient land, forming a huge mountain system, which has experienced 2 billion years of weathering and denudation, and the terrain has gradually become flat. About 600 million years ago, Mount Tai sank into the sea again. After more than 100 million years, the entire area rose to land again, and the ancient Mount Tai uplifted into a relatively low barren hill. In the late Mesozoic period about 100 million years ago, due to the extrusion and subduction of the Pacific plate to the Eurasian Plate, the Taishan stratum experienced extensive folds and fractures under the influence of the Yanshanian. During the crustal movement above, Mount Tai was rapidly uplifted. In the mid-Cenozoic period about 30 million years ago, the outline of Mount Tai was basically formed today.

=== Climatic vegetation ===
Due to its height, Mount Tai also has a vertical climate change. The lower part of the mountain is a warm temperate zone and the top of the mountain is a medium temperate zone. The mountain is cloudy and foggy, with an average annual precipitation of 1132mm, while the surrounding area receives only 750mm. Taishan scattering coverage rate reaches 80%. On the foothills, deciduous forests, broad-leaved coniferous mixed forests, Coniferous forest, alpine shrubs and grass can be seen in sequence. The vertical boundaries of the forest belts are distinct and the vegetation landscapes are different. There are 989 species of seed plants in 144 families, including 433 species of woody plants in 72 families, 556 species of herbaceous plants in 72 families, and 462 species of medicinal plants in 111 families.

==History==
Traces of human presence at Mount Tai date back to the Paleolithic period. Evidence of human settlement of the area can be proven from the neolithic period onwards. During this time, two cultures had emerged near the mountain, the Dawenkou culture to the south and the Longshan culture to the north.

During the Xia dynasty (c. 2070–1600 BC) the mountain was known as Mount Dai () and lay within the borders of Qingzhou, one of the Nine Provinces of ancient China.

Religious worship of Mount Tai has a tradition dating back 3,000 years, from the time of the Shang (c. 1600–1046 BC) to the Qing dynasty (1644–1912). Over time, this worship evolved into the Feng and Shan sacrifices. The sacrifices were an official imperial rite and Mount Tai became one of the principal places where the emperor would carry out the sacrifices to pay homage to heaven (on the summit) and earth (at the foot of the mountain) in the Feng () and Shan () sacrifices respectively. The two sacrifices are often referred to together as the Fengshan sacrifices (). Carving of an inscription as part of the sacrifices marked the attainment of the &quot;great peace&quot;.

By the time of the Zhou dynasty (c. 1046–256 BC) sacrifices at Mount Tai had become highly ritualized ceremonies in which a local feudal lord would travel there to make sacrifices of food and jade ritual items. These would then be arranged in a ritually correct pattern before being buried on the mountain. In the Spring and Autumn period (771–476 BC) the vassal states of Qi and Lu bordered Mount Tai to the north and south respectively, from where their feudal lords both made independent sacrifices on Mount Tai. According to Zhou ritual belief, the spirit of Mount Tai would only accept sacrifices offered by a feudal lord, leading Confucius (in his &quot;Analects&quot; 3.6) to criticize the ministers who offered state sacrifices here after usurping power. In the ensuing Warring States period (475–221 BC), to protect itself against invasion, the State of Qi erected a -long wall, the ruins of which are still present today. The name &quot;Tai&#x27;an&quot; of the neighboring city is attributed to the saying &quot;If Mount Tai is stable, so is the entire country&quot; (both characters of &quot;Tai&#x27;an&quot;, &quot;泰&quot; and &quot;安&quot;, have the independent meaning of &quot;peace&quot;).

In 219 BC, Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China, held a ceremony on the summit and proclaimed the unity of his empire in a well-known inscription. During the Han dynasty (206 BC–220 AD), the Feng and Shan sacrifices were considered the highest of all sacrifices.

Rituals and sacrifices were conducted by the Sui.

The emperors of the past dynasties went to Mount Tai to worship the heavens and tell the earth. Confucian Buddhism, preaching, and experience, and cultural figures climbed the mountain, leaving behind a dazzling array of stone inscriptions, cliffs, and couplet stone carvings. The cliff carvings on Mount Tai are also the most famous mountains. There are more than 1,800 stone inscriptions in Mount Tai, including more than 800 steles and 1,000 cliff stone inscriptions, distributed in 157 Daimiao, 215 at Dailu, 576 at Shantou East Road, 258 at Daiding, more than 80 at Daixi, and Daiyin 44 locations, more than 400 locations in Lingyan Temple, more than 100 locations in Shentong Temple. It mainly includes 5 types of sacrificial ceremonies of the emperors of the past dynasties, the creation and restoration of temples, the tomb inscriptions of the stone scriptures, the poems of chants, the scenery and the couplets, most of which are natural stone inscriptions.

Japan, India, the Persian court in exile, Goguryeo, Baekje, Silla, the Turks, Khotan, the Khmer, and the Umayyad Caliphate all had representatives attending the Feng and Shan sacrifices held by Emperor Gaozong of Tang in 666 at Mount Tai.

Also, Chinese worshippers of the mountain who were not nobles have also played an important role in the history of communities near the mountain and pilgrimage across China.

In 2003, Mount Tai attracted around six million visitors. A renovation project was completed in late October 2005, which aimed at restoring cultural relics and renovating damaged buildings of cultural significance. Widely known for its special ceremonies and sacrifices, Mount Tai has seen visits by many poets and literary scholars who have traveled there to gain inspiration. There are grandiose temples, many stone inscriptions and stone tablets with the mountain playing an important role in the development of both Buddhism and Taoism.

==Natural significance==
Mount Tai is a tilted fault-block mountain with height increasing from the north to the south. It is the oldest example of a paleo-metamorphic formation from the Cambrian Period in eastern China, and is known as the &quot;Taishan Complex&quot;. The uplift of the region started in the Proterozoic Era; by the end of the Proterozoic, it had become part of the continent.

Besides the Jade Emperor Peak, other distinctive rock formations are the &quot;Heaven Candle Peak&quot;, the &quot;Fan Cliff&quot;, and the &quot;Rear Rock Basin&quot;.

Mount Tai lies in the zone of oriental deciduous forest; about 80% of its area is covered with vegetation. The flora is known to comprise almost 1,000 species. Some of the trees in the area are very old and have cultural significance, such as the &quot;Han Dynasty Cypresses&quot;, which were planted by the Emperor Wu Di, the &quot;Tang Chinese Scholartree&quot; (about 1,300 years old), the &quot;Welcoming-Guest Pine&quot; (500 years old) and the &quot;Fifth-Rank Pine&quot;, which was named originally by the Emperor Qin Shi Huang, but was replanted about 250 years ago.

===Physical features===

Mount Tai rises abruptly from the vast plain of central Shandong, and is naturally endowed with many scenic sites. Geologically, it is a tilted fault-block mountain, higher to the south than north, and is the oldest and most important example of the paleo-metamorphic system representative of the Cambrian Period in eastern China. Referred to as the Taishan Complex, it comprises magnetized, metamorphic, sedimentary rock and an intrusive mass of various origins that were formed in the Archean Era 1700-2000 million years ago. Subsequently, in the Proterozoic Era, the Taishan region began to rise, becoming part of the continent by the end of the era. Uplift continued until the middle of the Cenozoic Era. The gneiss which emerged in the Taishan region is the foundation for all of North China. Cambrian strata, fully emerged in the north, are rich in fossils. Six streams flow from the summit, their water renowned for its extremely low mineral content, slight acidity (pH = 6.3) and relatively high oxygen content (6.4 milligrams per liter (mg/L)).

==Climate==
The area falls within the warm continental monsoon climate (Koppen &quot;Dwb&quot;). Meteorological data is not available. The regular climate is molly to -2 degrees Celsius.

===Vegetation===
Vegetation covers 79.9% of the area, which is densely wooded, but information about its composition is lacking. The flora is diverse and known to comprise 989 species, of which 433 species are woody and the rest herbaceous. Medicinal plants total 462 species and include multiflower knotweed, Cannabis, Taishan ginseng, Chinese gromwell and sealwort, which are renowned throughout the country. Some trees are very old and famous, notably the &quot;Han Dynasty Cypresses&quot; (planted 2,100 years ago by Emperor Wu Di of the Han dynasty), &#x27;Welcoming Guest Pine&#x27; (500 years old) and &#x27;Fifth Rank Pine&#x27; (named by Emperor Qin Shi Huang of the Qin dynasty).

===Fauna===
There are over 200 species of animals in addition to 122 species of birds, but precise details are lacking. Large-scaled fish &quot;Varicorhinus macrolepis&quot; is found in running water at 300–800 m.

==Cultural significance==

Mount Tai is of key importance in Chinese religion, being the eastern one of the five Sacred Mountains of China. According to historical records, Mount Tai became a sacred place visited by emperors to offer sacrifices and meditate in the Zhou dynasty before 1000 BC. A total of 72 emperors were recorded as visiting it. Legend holds that Emperor Shun began the tradition of imperial visits to Mount Tai.

Writers also came to acquire inspiration, to compose poems, write essays, paint and take pictures. Hence, a great many cultural relics were left on the mountain.

These are not to be confused with spirit tablets.

===Dai Miao===

The Temple of the God of Mount Tai, known as the &quot;Dai Temple&quot; (), is the largest and most complete ancient building complex in the area. It is located at the foot of Mount Tai in the city of Tai&#x27;an and covers an area of 96,000 square meters. The temple was first built during the Qin dynasty. Since the time of the Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD), its design has been a replica of the imperial palace, which makes it one out of three extant structures in China with the features of an imperial palace (the other two are the Forbidden City and the Confucius Temple in Qufu). The temple has five major halls and many small buildings. The centerpiece is the &quot;Palace of Heavenly Blessings&quot; (Tian Kuang), built in 1008, during the reign of the last Northern Song emperor, Huizong. The hall houses the mural painting &quot;The God of Mount Tai Making a Journey&quot;, dated to the year 1009. The mural extends around the eastern, western and northern walls of the hall and is high and long. The theme of the painting is an inspection tour by the god. Next to the Palace of Heavenly Blessings stand the Yaocan Pavilion and the entrance archway as well as the Bronze Pavilion in the northeast corner. The Dai Temple is surrounded by 2,100‑year‑old cypresses that date back to the Han dynasty. The oldest surviving stair may be the 6,000 granite steps to the top of the mountain.

The site contains a number of well-preserved steles from the Huizong reign, some of which are mounted on &quot;bixi&quot; tortoises. There is a much later, Qianlong era &quot;bixi&quot;-mounted stele as well.


===Shrine of the Blue Dawn===
The &quot;Shrine of the Blue Dawn&quot; (), near the top of the mountain is another grand building complex, a special combination of metal components, wood, and bricks and stone structures. It is dedicated to the goddess Bixia (Blue Dawn). From the Taishan Temple to the Blue Dawn Temple there are numerous stone tablets and inscriptions and ancient buildings on the way. Visitors derive much pleasure from climbing Mount Taishan. From the red gate at the foot of the mountain to the South Heaven Gate at the top are some 6,660 stone steps, which wind their way up the mountain slopes, each step offering a different view.

===Shibapan===
The &quot;Shibapan&quot; () means 18 levels stairs, which is the most advantageous part of stairs in Mount Tai. A total of 1,827 stone steps, is one of the main signs Mount Tai. People always say: &quot;Mount Tai of the majestic, all in Shibapan, Mount Tai of the sublime, all in the climb in!&quot; Shibapan has three parts, the &quot;Slow Eighteens&quot;(), the &quot;Hard Eighteens&quot;(), and the &quot;No slow no hard Eighteens&quot; (). The &quot;Slow Eighteens&quot; means this period is easier to climb, and the &quot;Hard Eighteens&quot; means it is harder to climb, which is interesting.

===Other monuments===

A flight of 7,200 total steps (including inner temple steps), with 6,293 Official Mountain Walkway Steps, lead up the East Peak of Mount Tai, along its course, there are 11 gates, 14 archways, 14 kiosks, and four pavilions.

In total, there are 22 temples, 97 ruins, 819 stone tablets, and 1,018 cliff-side and stone inscriptions located on Mount Tai. These include a Temple of the Jade King (), a Temple of the Blue Deity (), a Temple of Confucius (), a Temple of Doumu () and the Puzhao Buddhist Temple ().

Among the tablets and inscriptions on the top of Mount Tai, the inscription that declares Mount Tai the &quot;Most Revered of the Five Sacred Mountains&quot; () on the &quot;Sun Viewing Peak&quot; () is of particular renown. It was written by a member of the Aisin Gioro clan () in 1907 and is featured on the reverse side of the five yuan bill of the 5th series renminbi banknotes and page 26 of PRC biometric passport. Another inscription marks the &quot;Lu-Viewing Platform&quot; () from which Confucius took in the view over his home state of Lu and then pronounced &quot;The world is small&quot;.

The Wordless Stele () stands in front of the Jade Emperor Temple. Legend has it that the emperor who commissioned the stele was dissatisfied with the inscription suggested by his scribes and decided to leave it blank instead to leave its meaning to be imagined by the viewer. Another theory is that weather eroded the original calligraphic inscription.

===Other significant places===
*&quot;Suicide Cliff&quot; (), renamed &quot;Loving Life Cliff&quot; () in the Ming dynasty
*&quot;Sun-Viewing Peak&quot; ()
*&quot;Moon-Viewing Peak&quot; ()
*&quot;Platform of Gazing over Lu&quot; ()
*&quot;Rock of Exploring the Sea (of Clouds)&quot; ()

==Infrastructure==

Visitors can reach the peak of Mount Tai via a bus which terminates at the &quot;Midway Gate to Heaven&quot;, from there a cable car connects to the summit. Covering the same distance on foot takes from two and a half to six hours. The supplies for the many vendors along the road to the summit are carried up by porters either from the Midway Gate to Heaven or all the way up from the foot of the mountain.

To climb up the mountain, one can take one of two routes. The more popular east route starts from Taishan Arch. On the way up the 7,200 stone steps, the climber first passes the Ten Thousand Immortals Tower (Wanxianlou), Arhat Cliff (Luohanya), and Palace to Goddess Dou Mu (Doumugong). The climbing from the &quot;First Gate to Heaven&quot; (yi1 tian1 men2), the main entrance bordering on Tai&#x27;an town, up the entire mountain can take two and a half hours for the sprinting hiker to six hours for the leisure pace. Reaching the &quot;Midway Gate to Heaven&quot; from &quot;First Gate to Heaven&quot; is one hour at a sprint up to two and a half hours leisurely. To the northeast of the Palace to Goddess Dou Mu is Sutra Rock Valley in which the Buddhist Diamond Sutra was cut in characters measuring fifty centimeters across believed to be inscribed in the Northern Wei dynasty. The west route, taken by fewer tourists, is more scenic, but has less cultural heritage.

<text>This is a list of rivers and significant streams in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New Hampshire]].

All watercourses named &quot;River&quot; (freshwater or tidal) are listed here, as well as other streams which are either subject to the New Hampshire Comprehensive Shoreland Protection Act or are more than long. New Hampshire rivers and streams qualify for state shoreland protection (and are listed here in bold) if they are &quot;fourth-order&quot; or larger water bodies, based on the Strahler method of stream order classification. 

==By drainage basin==
All New Hampshire rivers ultimately flow to the Atlantic Ocean. The list is sorted by major drainage basin, running from north to south along the Atlantic coast, with respective tributaries arranged based on their entry into the main stream from mouth to source. Where several tributaries enter a single lake, they are listed running clockwise from the lake outlet.

<doc id="530228" wikidata="Q203041" url="?curid=530228" title="Pohjola">
<text>Pohjola (; from &#x27;base, bottom&#x27;, but used in derived forms like &quot;pohjois-&quot; to mean &#x27;north&#x27; + &quot;-&quot; &#x27;place&#x27;), sometimes just Pohja (), is a location in Finnish mythology. It is one of the two main polarities in the Finnish national epic, the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, along with Kalevala or Väinölä.

== Pohjola and the &quot;Kalevala&quot; storytellers ==
C. Ganander (1789), characterised Pohjola as
: &#x27;the most extreme North ... a dark and terrible place. Tartarus and Ultima Thule&#x27;.
:&quot;Yttersta Norden, beskrives såsom en mörk och förfärlig ort. Tartarus &amp; ultima Thule&quot;

=== Attempts to treat Pohjola as a non-mythic place ===
Elias Lönnrot, one of the principal collectors of Finnish folk lyric poetry and composer of the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, went to some lengths to interpret Pohjola as a real place, considering whether its inhabitants might be Saami or Finns, and precisely where areas such as Luotela / Luode (&#x27;North-West region&#x27;), Pimentola (&#x27;region of darkness&#x27;), Sariola, and Untamola / Uni (&#x27;region of sleep&#x27;) might be; many other scholars followed his lead.

However, the idea of an otherworldly far north is a widespread motif in both Classical and medieval European literature, and has a corresponding concept, &quot;boasso&quot;, in Saami culture. Thus Pohjola can be thought of as a purely abstract place, a literary trope standing as the source of evil – a foreboding, horrible, forever cold land in the far north.

=== Pohjola in the &quot;Kalevala&quot; tales ===
In &quot;The Kalevala&quot;, Pohjola mainly appears as the home of women whom the male heroes, from the land of Kalevala, seek as wives.
The Mistress of Pohjola is Louhi, a powerful, evil witch. The great smith Seppo Ilmarinen forges the Sampo at her demand as a payment for the hand of her daughter in marriage. The Sampo is a magic artefact, possibly a mill of plenty that churns out abundant goods, like the Cornucopia. Its exact nature is unclear, but its churning lid has also been interpreted as a symbol of the celestial vault of the heavens: Embedded with stars, it revolves around a central axis, or the pillar of the world.

Other Kalevala characters also seek marriage with the daughters of Pohjola. These include the adventurer Lemminkäinen, and the wise old man Väinämöinen. Louhi demands from them deeds similar to the forging of Sampo, such as shooting the Swan of Tuonela. When the suitor finally gets the daughter, weddings and great drinking and eating parties are held at the great hall of Pohjola.

The foundation of the world pillar, also thought of as the root of the &quot;world tree&quot;, was probably located in Pohjola, somewhere just over the northern horizon from the Finnish mythological perspective. The pillar was thought to rest on the &quot;Pohjantähti&quot; or North Star.

The bulk of the Kalevala are the stories about the Sampo, kept in Pohjola. The major episodes in the Pojola series are:
* The forging of the Sampo and its abundance hoarded by the witch Louhi inside a great mountain, in the dark reaches of Pohjola.
* The struggles of the southern people and their raid of Pohjola to seize the Sampo for their own needs.
* The Sampo being broken in the course of the struggle over it, and the loss of its all-important lid (which implies shattering the world tree at the north pole).

==In music==
&quot;Pohjola&#x27;s Daughter&quot; is a symphonic tone poem by Jean Sibelius.

The Finnish metal band Sentenced used the frozen land of Pohjola as inspiration for the albums &quot;Journey to Pohjola&quot; and &quot;North from Here&quot; released in 1992 and 1993.

&quot;Pohjola&quot; is also the name of a song on an album Unsung Heroes by a Finnish folk metal band Ensiferum. The lyrics are based on a poem by 19th century freiherr and politician Yrjö Koskinen.

The Finnish folk metal band Moonsorrow has a song entitled &quot;Taistelu Pohjolasta&quot; (&quot;The Battle for Pohjola&quot;). Two different versions of it appear on their 1999 demo &quot;Tämä ikuinen talvi&quot; (&quot;This Eternal Winter&quot;) and their 2008 EP &quot;Tulimyrsky&quot; (&quot;Firestorm&quot;).

==Other uses==
In modern Finnish, the word &quot;Pohjola&quot; or &quot;Pohjoismaat&quot; is used to refer to the &quot;Nordic countries&quot;, the equivalent of which in Scandinavian languages is &quot;Norden&quot;. &quot;Pohjola&quot; is occasionally translated in English as &quot;Northland&quot; or &quot;Pohjoland&quot;.

The 2017 anime series &quot;Little Witch Academia&quot; has an episode entitled &quot;Pohjola&#x27;s Ordeal&quot;.

<text>Klang or Kelang, officially Royal City of Klang (), is a city, royal city and former capital of the state of Selangor, Malaysia. It is located within the Klang District. It was the civil capital of Selangor in an earlier era prior to the emergence of Kuala Lumpur and the current capital, Shah Alam. Port of Port Klang, which is located in the Klang District, is the 12th busiest transshipment port and the 12th busiest container port in the world.

The Klang Royal City Council or &quot;&quot; exercises jurisdiction for a majority of the Klang District while the Shah Alam City Council exercises some jurisdiction over the east of Klang District, north of Petaling District and the other parts of Selangor State including Shah Alam itself.

As of 2010, the Klang City has a total population of 240,016 (10,445 in the city centre), while the population of Klang District is 842,146, and the population of all towns managed by Klang Municipal Council is 744,062, making it Selangor&#x27;s second largest city.

==Etymology==
Klang may have taken its name from the Klang River which runs through the city. The entire geographical area in the immediate vicinity of the river, which begins at Kuala Lumpur and runs west all the way to Port Klang, is known as the Klang Valley.

One popular theory on the origin of the name is that it is derived from the Mon–Khmer word &quot;Klong&quot;, which may mean a canal or waterway. Alternatively it has also been argued that it means &quot;warehouses&quot;, from the Malay word &quot;Kilang&quot; – in the old days, it was full of warehouses (&quot;kilang&quot; currently means &quot;factory&quot;).

Klang was also once known as Pengkalan Batu meaning &quot;stone jetty&quot;.

Unlike most other place names in Malaysia, the Chinese name for Klang (), is neither a direct transcription nor translation of the Malay place name, but likely a transcription of another Malay word &quot;Pasang&quot;, referring to the rising tides around the Klang Valley.

==History==
The royal city of Klang has been a site of human settlement since prehistoric times. Bronze Age drums, axes and other artefacts have been found in the vicinity of the town and within the town itself. A bronze bell dating from the 2nd century BC was found in Klang and is now in the British Museum. Also found in or near Klang are iron tools called &quot;tulang mawas&quot; (&quot;ape bones&quot;) and a bronze drum. Commanding the approaches to the tin rich Klang Valley, Klang has always been of key strategic importance. It was mentioned as a dependency of other states as early as the 11th century. Klang was also mentioned in the 14th century literary work &quot;Nagarakretagama&quot; dated to the Majapahit Empire, and the Klang River was marked and named on the earliest maritime charts of Chinese Admiral Cheng Ho who visited Malacca from 1409 to 1433.
Klang was under the control of the Malacca Sultanate in the 15th century. The celebrated Tun Perak, the Malacca&#x27;s greatest Bendahara, came from Klang and became its territorial chief. According to the &quot;Malay Annals&quot;, the people of Klang overthrew the local chief or &quot;penghulu&quot; and asked the Sultan of Malacca Muzaffar Shah to appoint another, and Tun Perak was then appointed the leader. Klang was known as a producer of tin; according to Manuel Godinho de Erédia, it produced one hundred &quot;bares&quot; of tin a year when the Portuguese occupied Malacca. Klang however remained in Malay hands after the fall of Melaka to the Portuguese in 1511, and was controlled by the Sultan of Johor-Riau. In the 17th century, the Bugis began to settle in the coastal region of Selangor including Klang, and the Selangor sultanate was created in the 1766, which then controlled Klang.
In the 19th century, the importance of Klang greatly increased by the rapid expansion of tin mining as a result of the increased demand for tin from the West. The desire to control the Klang Valley led directly to the Klang War (also called the Selangor Civil War) of 1867–1874 when Raja Mahdi fought to regain what he considered his birthright as territorial chief against Raja Abdullah. During the Klang War, in 1868, the seat of power was moved to Bandar Temasya, Kuala Langat, and then to Jugra which became the royal capital of Selangor.

Klang however did not lose its importance. In 1874, Selangor accepted a British Resident who would &quot;advise&quot; the Sultan, and Klang became the capital of British colonial administration for Selangor from 1875 until 1880 when the capital city was moved to Kuala Lumpur due to the growth of Kuala Lumpur from tin-mining. Today Klang is no longer State capital or the main seat of the ruler, but it remains the headquarters of the District to which it gives it name.

Until the construction of Port Swettenham (now known as Port Klang) in 1901, Klang remained the chief outlet for Selangor&#x27;s tin, and its position was enhanced by the completion of the Klang Valley railway to Bukit Kuda in 1886, which was then connected to Klang itself via a rail bridge, the Connaught Bridge, completed in 1890. In the 1890s its growth was further stimulated by the development of the district into the State&#x27; leading producer of coffee, and later rubber. In 1903, the royal seat was moved back to Klang when it became the official seat of Sultan Sulaiman (Sultan Alauddin Sulaiman Shah).

In May 1890, a local authority, known as Klang Health Board, was established to administer Klang town. The official boundary of Klang was first defined in 1895. The first road bridge over the Klang River connecting the two parts of the town, the Belfield Bridge, was constructed in 1908. In 1926 the health boards of Klang and Port Swettenham were merged, and in 1945 the local authority was renamed Klang Town Board. In 1954, the Town Board became the Klang Town Council after a local election was set up to select its members in accordance with the Local Government Election Ordinance of 1950. In 1963, the Port Klang Authority was created and it now administers three Port Klang areas: Northport, Southpoint, and West Port.

In 1971, the Klang District Council, which incorporated the nearby townships of Kapar and Meru as well as Port Klang, was formed. After undergoing a further reorganisation according to the Local Government Act of 1976 (Act 171), Klang District Council was upgraded to Klang Municipal Council (KMC) on 1 January 1977 and Klang Royal City Council (KRCC) beginning 5 February 2024. From 1974 to 1977, Klang was the state capital city of Selangor before the seat of government shifted to Shah Alam in 1977.

==Districts==

Klang is divided into North Klang and South Klang, which are separated by the Klang River. North Klang is divided into three sub-districts which are Kapar (Located at the north of North Klang), Rantau Panjang (situated at the west of North Klang) and Meru (at the east of North Klang).

Klang North used to be the main commercial centre of Klang, but since 2008, more residential and commercial areas as well as government offices are being developed in Klang South. Most major government and private health care facilities are also located at Klang South. Hence, this area tends to be busier and becomes the centre of social and recreational activities after office hours and during the weekends. This is triggered by the rapid growth of new and modern townships such as Bandar Botanic, Bandar Bukit Tinggi, Taman Sentosa Perdana, Taman Sri Andalas, Taman Bayu Perdana, Taman Sentosa, Glenmarie Cove, Kota Bayuemas etc. all located within Klang South.

At the Klang North side, some of the older and established residential areas include Berkeley Garden, Taman Eng Ann, Taman Klang Utama, Bandar Baru Klang and so forth. Newer townships include Bandar Bukit Raja, Aman Perdana and Klang Sentral.

Malaysia&#x27;s busiest port, Port Klang was previously named Port Swettenham until 1972 when it was renamed Port Klang. Port Klang is located at Klang South.

== Economy ==
Initially, Bukit Kuda port (located at 12.5 miles away from Klang river mouth) was established as a port that connect to mining areas within Kuala Lumpur. Later, a railway line was built connecting Bukit Kuda with Kuala Lumpur. However, the Bukit Kuda port was found to be unsuitable. Therefore, the town of Klang which is located at three miles nearer to the river mouth than Bukti Kuda, was chosen to become the major port. A bridge was constructed across the Klang river and railway was connected to Klang in August 1890. Klang port received huge amount of traffic in the following years, which later the authorities decided to extend the railway line to the mouth of the river where new port named &quot;Port Swettenham&quot; would be constructed in 1901. However, Port Swettenham was plaqued with malaria infections which affected coolies and port staff greatly, causing a delay in unloading cargoes from the ships. Sir Malcom Watson, a district surgeon in Klang solved the malaria problem in 1903 by clearing the forests and undergrowth and construct a drainage system at the same time.

Klang gradually became the main manufacturing centre for Malaya after the end of World War I. The first person who set up a factory in Klang was a millionaire from Singapore named Tan Kah Kee. His factory produced canned pineapples. The setting up of his factory stimulated the pineapple plantations around Klang. After Tan went bankrupt in 1934, Goh Hock Huat, one of the pineapple producers, decided to set up his own pineapple canning factory. More factories opened in Klang due to its proximity to Port Swettenham. In the following years, factories producing rubber products and oil factory producing products from groundnuts were set up with skills and machineries imported from Singapore.
The economy of Klang is closely linked with that the greater Klang Valley conurbation which is the most densely populated, urbanised and industrialised region of Malaysia. There is a wide range of industries within the Klang municipality, major industrial areas may be found in Bukit Raja, Kapar, Meru, Taman Klang Utama and Sungai Buloh, Pulau Indah, Teluk Gong and others. Rubber used to be an important part of the economy of the region, but from the 1970s onwards, many rubber plantations have switched to palm oil, and were then converted again for urban development and infrastructure use.

Port Klang forms an important part of the economy of Klang. It is home to about 95 shipping companies and agents, 300 custom brokers, 25 container storage centres, as well as more than 70 freight and transport companies. It handled almost 50% of Malaysia&#x27;s sea-borne container trade in 2013. The Port Klang Free Zone was established in 2004 to transform Port Klang into a regional distribution hub as well as a trade and logistics centre.

The port is part of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road that runs from the Chinese coast to Singapore, towards the southern tip of India to Mombasa, from there through the Red Sea via the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean, there to the Upper Adriatic region to the northern Italian hub of Trieste with its connections to Central Europe and the North Sea.

==Politics==
Klang encompasses three parliamentary seats held by both Perikatan Nasional (1 seat) and also the Pakatan Harapan coalitions (2 seats). These constituencies are subdivided into state seats.
==Demographics==

The following are the census figures for the population of Klang. The 1957 and 1970 figures are for the Klang district and were collected before the reorganisation of Klang and the Bumiputra status being used as a category. The 2010 figures are for MP Klang. The figure for Klang city is not given as what constitutes Bandar Klang appears to be inconsistent with considerable fluctuation in population figures over the years.

== Crime ==
There are a number of criminal gangs operating in Klang, and gang violence is not uncommon. Among the Chinese community, there are the Ang Bin Hoey triad gangs such as Gang 21 which operates in Kuala Lumpur and the Klang Valley. There are also Gang 24, Gang 36 and others, and their members are often Indians. Due to economic development and changes in the industry, many rubber estates where Indian plantation workers used to live and work were closed, and this is thought to have contributed to a rise of gangsterism amongst the displaced and economically-deprived Indians. It is thought that the Indians originally worked for Chinese gang leaders but they now dominate many of these criminal organisations.

==Transportation ==
Klang is served by six commuter stations that constitute the Port Klang Line of the KTM Komuter system, namely Bukit Badak, Kampung Raja Uda, Klang, Teluk Pulai, Teluk Gadong and Pelabuhan Klang stations. 

By September 2025, Klang is expected to be connected to the LRT Shah Alam transit line.

Klang is connected to the rest of the Klang Valley via the Federal Highway, the New Klang Valley Expressway (NKVE), South Klang Valley Expressway (SKVE), the North Klang Straits Bypass (New North Klang Straits Bypass) as well as the KESAS Highway. The West Coast Expressway (WCE) currently under construction, will run between Changkat Jering, Perak and Klang-Banting, Selangor. The construction is expected to be fully completed by early 2025.

Klang is also served by the RapidKL bus route. Klang Sentral acts as a terminal for long-distance buses and taxis in northern Klang. There is a non-stop hourly bus service every day from and to KLIA2 to Klang, and the embarkation point is located at the AEON Bukit Tinggi Shopping Centre. Smart Selangor Bus Programme was established by the Selangor State Government to provide an efficient and high quality free public transportation service to its citizens.

The double-decked Kota Bridge was first built in late 1950s as a replacement for the Belfield Bridge. The double-decked bridge now closed to car traffic after a new Kota Bridge was built alongside it in the 1992, although the lower deck is still used by pedestrians, bicycles and motorcycles. A second bridge in Klang, the Musaeddin (Tengku Kelana) Bridge, was built in the 1980s near the Kota Bridge. The RM199 million Klang Third Bridge was opened for traffic in May 2017, complementing the existing two other road bridges in the city that connect Klang North and Klang South.

<text>Christopher Cross &quot;Chris&quot; Griffin is a fictional character from the animated television series &quot;Family Guy&quot;. He is the second of three children of Peter and Lois Griffin and is the older brother of Stewie Griffin and the younger brother of Meg Griffin. He is voiced by the American actor, producer, and writer Seth Green and first appeared on television, along with the rest of the Griffin family, in the episode &quot;Death Has a Shadow&quot; on January 31, 1999.

Chris Griffin was created and designed by the series&#x27; creator, Seth MacFarlane, who was asked to pitch a pilot to the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series&#x27; pilot episode was based on &quot;The Life of Larry&quot; and &quot;Larry &amp; Steve&quot;, two shorts made by MacFarlane which featured a middle-aged man named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve. Chris was based on Milt, the teenage son character in &quot;The Life of Larry&quot;. Chris is an overweight adult boy with long, shaggy blond hair and medium skin. He wears a blue t-shirt, black sweatpants, white sneakers with red stripes, and an orange baseball cap with black on the back. His face looks similar to his father&#x27;s, having the same kind of eyes, nose and chin. In the first three seasons, he wore golden hoop earrings.

Originally designed as a somewhat gregarious, yet unintelligent teenager, Chris has become more awkward and idiotic over the course of the show. Running gags in the series involving Chris include the existence of an &#x27;Evil Monkey&#x27; in his closet (though it is later revealed that the monkey is not evil), his frequent masturbation, and his perverted admirer, the elderly Herbert who lusts after and repeatedly tries to prey on him throughout the show&#x27;s run.

==Character origins==
The character of Chris Griffin resembles that of Milt&#x27;s, the son of the main character Larry Cummings in &quot;The Life of Larry.&quot; The animated short film was created by Seth MacFarlane at the Rhode Island School of Design in 1995 which later led to the development of &quot;Family Guy&quot;, which aired three years later.

Seth Green has stated that his main inspiration for Chris&#x27; voice came from envisioning how the Buffalo Bill character from the thriller film &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; would sound if he were speaking through a PA system at a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant.

==Personality==

Similar to his older sister Meg, Chris is portrayed as a typical adolescent, albeit one who comes off as being good-natured and easy-going. As such, the character tends to take things in stride, not worrying about much, seemingly enjoying his position in life. On the Volume 1 DVD Boxset TV guides special &quot;Family Guy&quot; edition, it is stated that Chris &quot;wouldn&#x27;t hurt a fly, unless it landed on his hot dog&quot;.

Chris is seemingly willing to take drastic measures to meet his academic needs, especially to address his below-average grades. In one episode, he thinks he got a bad grade on his geometry test when he tickled his brain with a plastic army man&#x27;s rifle inserted into his nose, accidentally puncturing a lobe.

Despite frequently displaying Peter&#x27;s characteristic stupidity, Chris is usually portrayed as a faster learner than Peter, and has a variety of talents, such as filmmaking, video editing, etc. In &quot;Patriot Games&quot;, when the family moves to London, Chris is the only member of the family who learns how to speak cockney English in a matter of seconds. Conversely, however, when his brother Stewie tries to help him prepare for a history exam in &quot;Stewie, Chris, &amp; Brian&#x27;s Excellent Adventure&quot;, he seems to show great difficulty in grasping new ideas. Chris and Stewie are often shown to share a strong bond: with Stewie claiming the two are a team who look out for one another like &quot;Owl and Costello&quot;.

He also shares his father&#x27;s cartoonish lack of common sense, tends to be absent-minded, gets confused easily, and appears to be extremely naïve; in &quot;Lethal Weapons&quot;, when Peter and Lois are having a fist fight, Chris cheers for the former, telling him to &quot;kick her ass!&quot;. Earlier in the episode, after Chris breaks a vase with his basketball and Lois tells Peter to punish him with a spanking, Peter tells him to &quot;punish [himself]&quot; and subsequently spanks himself. In &quot;Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story&quot;, when the children watch Lois and Peter trying to make love, Chris mistakes it for a fight and says, &quot;Meg, why do you think they&#x27;re fighting?&quot;, but Meg angrily whispers to him &quot;They&#x27;re not.&quot; In the episode &quot;Trading Places&quot;, after Chris accidentally damages Peter&#x27;s dirt bike, Peter &quot;punishes&quot; him by making him start smoking.

Although Meg is often humiliated or embarrassed by his actions like she is with Peter&#x27;s actions, Chris usually loves and cares for her deeply, and the two are frequently shown to get along very well. Up until sometime during the sixth season, Chris is more socially active at school than Meg, having various friends, including several girls, while attending Buddy Cianci Junior High School, and later at James Woods Regional High School (now called Adam West High School).

As the series progresses and Meg is seen more often with her group of friends, Chris&#x27;s social status is greatly reduced to the point of being unpopular and virtually friendless at James Woods Regional High School. While just as socially looked down upon as Meg (though to a lesser extent of being bullied), he is outwardly confident and spirited, mostly when dealing with the ups and downs of being a teenager, such as running for Homecoming King, standing up to bullies, lashing out against his date, and frequently acting out against Peter&#x27;s hurtful ways.

In &quot;Stew-Roids&quot;, Chris&#x27;s popularity increases drastically when the school&#x27;s queen bee, Connie D&#x27;Amico, dates him. At first, she does this to be more popular since &quot;dating a loser&quot; improves her self confidence, however she begins to develop feelings towards Chris when he confesses his feelings towards her. Later in the episode, however, Chris&#x27;s popularity turns him mean and shallow, and he dumps Connie after making out with two other girls at a house party. Connie and Meg then briefly team up to humiliate Chris by having Neil Goldman show the school a video of him re-enacting a scene from &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; in which Buffalo Bill dances nude in front of a mirror, which results in Connie regaining her popularity, while Chris is socially demoted back to being an outcast.

In &quot;Once Bitten&quot;, Chris befriends Neil Goldman, the Jewish resident &quot;nerd/geek&quot; and Meg&#x27;s self-proclaimed love interest. Although their friendship was initially a ploy for Neil to get closer to Meg, Neil feels bad for using Chris and returns to him to resume their friendship.

==Evil Monkey==
As a running gag, starting in the episode &quot;Dammit Janet!&quot;, Chris is regularly tormented by the Evil Monkey, who lives in his closet, though whenever he complains about it to anyone, they often laugh along with him instead thinking it is a joke, after which the monkey appears with a malevolent grimace and points at Chris in a threatening and intimidating manner. In &quot;Hannah Banana&quot;, Chris proves the monkey&#x27;s existence to the family, though ends up becoming friends with him after the monkey &quot;(who appears not to be evil at all, but just a poor creature who was depressed after his ex-wife cheated on him with another monkey)&quot; helps him write out a book report and subsequently pass.

The simian explains his frightening mannerisms as a result of various conditions and unintended actions. Chris introduces him to his friends, they hang out with each other in &quot;fun&quot; places, and the monkey helps Chris in his studies in school, which Peter does not do. This, however, causes a rift between Chris and Peter when the former realizes that the monkey cares more for him than his father. Eventually, the Evil Monkey helps the two characters to patch things up, especially after Peter saves the monkey from Miley Cyrus (who is depicted as an android) who had kidnapped him à la &quot;King Kong&quot;. After that, the monkey happily moves out of Chris&#x27; closet to live in the closet of Tom Tucker&#x27;s son, Jake, where the cycle will start in anew, as Jake himself experiences difficulty with his father.

In a 2003 interview, Seth MacFarlane stated that the writers thought it would be funny to give Chris a childhood fear that is actually real, since he has &quot;a childlike mind&quot;. The monkey&#x27;s trademark grimace and pointing was the idea of writer Mike Barker.

==Identification with Seth Green==
Another running gag, which began in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; remake episode &quot;Blue Harvest&quot;, has Chris defend the overall career of voice actor Seth Green, along with the animated series &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;: an Adult Swim show Green co-created as an in-joke where Green and Seth MacFarlane are jokingly portrayed as &#x27;bitter competitors&#x27; in the field of adult animation.

When Peter (MacFarlane) methodically denigrates &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; in &quot;Blue Harvest&quot;, Chris loses his temper and storms off. This gag is continued in &quot;Something, Something, Something, Dark Side&quot;: though Chris attempts to maintain a cool head, he storms off again when Peter offers to tell the story of &quot;Without a Paddle&quot;, a critically panned film that featured Green. Both these scenes happen in the framing device of the episode (in which the family recounts the events of the original Star Wars trilogy whilst they have lost power during a storm) and not in the interior &quot;Star Wars&quot; narrative, in which Green portrays Chris as &quot;Star Wars&quot; hero Luke Skywalker.

In the final &quot;Star Wars&quot; parody, &quot;It&#x27;s a Trap!&quot;, mocking Green&#x27;s career provokes further dismay in Chris: who attempts to defend Green from Carter Pewterschmidt, who claims the actor &quot;really gets under [his] skin&quot; and has failed to be part of any successful project, by citing &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and the Austin Powers film series as prominent examples of success in Green&#x27;s career. Chris is rebuffed by Pewterschmidt: who argues that the popularity of &quot;Buffy&quot; was largely over-stated by coverage of the show by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; and that moviegoers were largely uninterested in Green&#x27;s involvement in the Austin Powers films.

Furthermore, after Chris refuses to fight Stewie, the latter claims to be unfazed, as Stewie could simply &quot;get Seth Green to fight [him]&quot;, claiming Green will &quot;do anything for money&quot; citing &quot;Sex Drive&quot;: a critically and commercially unsuccessful film starring Green as an example of the actor&#x27;s greed, and deriding the film due to its obscurity. These taunts give Chris (in character as Skywalker) the conviction to retaliate against Stewie/Darth Vader and Carter/Darth Sidious (both played by MacFarlane).

In the closing scenes of the episode&#x27;s framing device, an irritated Chris asks his father Peter about his various derisions of Seth Green, to which Peter retorts that he simply finds Green to be a &quot;douche&quot;. An agitated Chris thus discusses his opinion of Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane&#x27;s career suggesting the animated sitcom is a rip-off of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;; MacFarlane is then defended by the characters whom he voices (Peter, Brian and Stewie): who refer to MacFarlane as handsome and talented.

Outside of the &quot;Star Wars&quot;-themed episodes, &quot;Road to the Multiverse&quot; plays on the running gag, but with Stewie provoking the &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; universe counterpart of Chris by asking &quot;How does it feel to be on a major network for thirty seconds?&quot;, which prompts Chris to scream &quot;Fuck you!&quot;

Chris&#x27; birthday is February 8, which also happens to be the same day as Seth Green.

<doc id="530238" wikidata="Q478293" url="?curid=530238" title="Cooking off">
<text>Cooking off (or thermally induced firing) is unfired weapon ammunition exploding prematurely due to heat in the surrounding environment. The term is used both for detonation of ammunition not loaded into a weapon, and unintended firing of a loaded weapon due to heating.

A fast cook-off is a cook-off caused by fire. A slow cook-off is caused by a sustained thermal event less intense than fire.

A cooked-off round may cause a sympathetic detonation of adjacent rounds. Insensitive munitions are designed to be less vulnerable to accidental firing induced by external heat.

== Artillery ==
Inherent design flaws in early 17th century Swedish leather cannons led to the gun tube overheating which prematurely ignited the gunpowder, injuring the loader.

Muzzle-loading cannon on merchant and naval vessels of the Age of Sail would fire if the vessels caught fire while the guns were loaded. Examples include the merchantman and .

After the cooking off of artillery shells in the G5 howitzers in the late 1980s, the South African Army changed commands from &quot;cease fire&quot; to &quot;cease loading&quot; . This allowed crews to fire any loaded shells to prevent them from heating up and exploding.

== Machine guns ==
Cooking off is a characteristic of certain air-cooled machine guns firing from a closed bolt. In such a design, when the trigger is released the weapon feed leaves a final round in the chamber. Residual heat conducts through the cartridge case. If the kindling point of the propellant is eventually reached it will burn even though the primer has not been struck, thus firing the chambered round. Nitrocellulose, the primary component of modern smokeless powder, has a relatively low autoignition temperature of around . Contrary to popular myth, this will not cause the machine gun to &quot;runaway&quot; at cyclic rate of fire (as compared to a slamfire) because each chambered round has to first be brought up to temperature. The time this takes depends on the temperature of the chamber and of the environment, but is usually several seconds, although if caused deliberately may be very fast. During this time the barrel is cooling.

Cook offs in machine guns are prevented by:
* Cased ammunition: Among its many functions, the metallic cartridge case acts as a heat sink protecting the propellant from chamber heat. The case must first be brought up to temperature before the propellant inside can burn.
* Cooling: Barrels can be liquid-cooled (like a radiator in an automobile engine), or exchanged periodically. Most modern infantry machine guns (GPMG, general-purpose machine gun) are issued with several quick change barrels that are swapped out allowing one barrel to cool while the gun fires with the other.
* Open bolt: Most modern infantry machine guns (and submachine guns) fire from an open bolt, meaning the bolt remains to the rear when the trigger is released. Pulling the trigger releases the bolt forward and fires the weapon simultaneously. Assuming proper operation (no stoppages) a cook off is not possible with this design because a cartridge is not chambered until the moment the trigger is pulled and the weapon is fired, thus there is nothing in the chamber.

=== Closed bolt ===
Most modern infantry assault rifles fire from a closed bolt, meaning that when ready to fire, there is a round in the chamber of the barrel and the bolt and working parts are in the forward position, closing the breech. Squeezing the trigger releases the striker or hammer, firing the cartridge in the chamber. Assuming proper operation (no stoppages) a cook off is possible with this design because a cartridge is kept chambered in the potentially hot chamber, where it can absorb enough heat to cause ignition of its propellant. Apart from the possibility to cook off the heated propellant requires a special formula to allow for consistent muzzle velocity throughout all temperatures.

=== Caseless ammunition ===
Caseless ammunition eliminates the metal case that typically holds the primer or igniter and the powder charge (smokeless powder) that propels the bullet. The metal case absorbs a large portion of the waste heat of firing. Ejecting this hot, empty case removes that heat from the weapon. With caseless rounds, other means of reducing waste heat are necessary, especially in automatic fire.

== Tanks ==
Cooking off is a serious hazard to crews in damaged and disabled tanks. Attempted solutions include storing ammunition under water and insulating ammunition compartments. The current technique, used in tanks such as the M1 Abrams, is to armor the compartments and provide blow-off panels to channel the force of the explosion to the exterior of the tank and prevent the jack-in-the-box effect.

== Missiles and air-dropped bombs ==
The risk of aircraft armament cooking off is a significant hazard during pre-flight operations, especially for aircraft carriers. Fuel fires, which can spread across the flight deck rapidly and engulf many aircraft, are the most serious risk. This was a significant contributor to the 1967 fire disaster aboard the , when such a fire (set off by an inadvertently fired Zuni rocket striking the fuel tanks of a waiting A-4 Skyhawk) detonated two unguided bombs of Korean War vintage which had been loaded onto the stricken bomber, rupturing the fuel tanks of adjacent aircraft and setting off a chain reaction of similarly cooked off bombs. Because of the age and condition of the first two bombs, the fire safety crew was unable to cool them before they cooked off, which should have been possible for contemporary weapons with higher cook-off temperatures.

A different sort of cook-off event was the trigger for the 1969 explosion and fire aboard the , which also involved a Zuni rocket. During this event, the exhaust from an MD-3A &quot;Huffer&quot; Air Start Unit (ASU) overheated the warhead of a Zuni that was mounted on a parked aircraft, causing it to cook off. As with the &quot;Forrestal&quot; disaster, this led to procedural and equipment changes, specifically regarding ASUs.

<doc id="530241" wikidata="Q10075" url="?curid=530241" title="List of emperors of the Ming dynasty">
<text>The emperors of the Ming dynasty, who were all members of the House of Zhu, ruled over China proper from 1368 to 1644 during the late imperial era of China (960–1912). Members of the Ming dynasty continued to rule a series of rump states in southern China, commonly known as the Southern Ming, until 1662; the Ming dynasty succeeded the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty and preceded the Manchu-led Qing dynasty.

The Ming dynasty was founded by the peasant rebel leader Zhu Yuanzhang, known as the Hongwu Emperor. The longest-reigning emperor of the dynasty was the Wanli Emperor (), who ruled for 48 years; the shortest was his successor, the Taichang Emperor, who ruled for only 29 days in 1620. The youngest ruler at the time of his ascension was Emperor Yingzong, who was only 9 years old, while the oldest ruler at the time of his death was the Hongwu Emperor, who died at the age of 71.

The emperor of the Ming dynasty, following a practice established in the Zhou dynasty, was known as the &quot;Son of Heaven&quot; (). He was viewed as the intermediary between humans and heaven and was responsible for conducting numerous rituals to honor the supreme deities who safeguarded the empire. In addition, he participated in various ceremonies to commemorate significant events in both his own life and that of the empire. During audiences, his subjects were expected to demonstrate their submission by prostrating themselves before him, although the majority of decisions were actually made by the Grand Secretariat and the ministries. When he traveled, he was accompanied by an impressive entourage and protected by his imperial guard.

The majority of the Ming emperors resided in the Forbidden City, a complex of palaces and buildings in Beijing. Prior to the Yongle Emperor, who moved the capital in 1420, the emperor&#x27;s residence was located in a similar complex in Nanjing.

== Background ==

The Ming dynasty was founded by Zhu Yuanzhang (the Hongwu Emperor), who was one of the leaders of the Red Turban peasant rebellion. Despite humble beginnings, he successfully built his own state, defeated other rebel leaders, and forced the last Yuan emperor to flee China proper. On Chinese New Year in 1368, Zhu Yuanzhang declared the establishment of a new imperial dynasty titled &quot;Great Ming&quot; () and declared himself its first emperor.

The emperors of the Ming dynasty inherited the throne according to the principle of primogeniture. According to the Hongwu Emperor&#x27;s &quot;Ancestral Instructions&quot;, the heir to the throne was always the eldest son of the emperor and empress, or his heir, followed by younger sons of the empress. Sons of concubines were excluded from the line of succession. Conservative officials strongly insisted on following this strict rule throughout the Ming era. Even the Wanli Emperor, who for two decades tried to appoint his third son, Zhu Changxun, as crown prince, was eventually forced to give in and appoint his eldest son, the future Taichang Emperor. The only successful violator of the succession rules was the Yongle Emperor, the third emperor of the dynasty. He gained power in a three-year civil war against his nephew, the Jianwen Emperor.

The emperor, or &quot;huangdi&quot;, was the supreme head of state, a tradition that dated back to the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC) and was continued by the Ming dynasty. In theory, he held ultimate authority over all officials and generals, and the entire country was expected to obey his decrees. However, this power came at a cost, as the Hongwu Emperor tightly controlled his power through numerous purges. As the dynasty progressed, the successors of the Hongwu Emperor lacked his decisiveness and were constrained by traditional limitations. The emperor was not expected to make independent decisions regarding the direction of the country. Instead, memoranda and demands were presented to them with proposed solutions. The emperor&#x27;s role was to either confirm the submitted proposals or negotiate an alternative solution with the submitters. Similarly, the emperors appointed officials and generals based on recommendations from the Ministry of Personnel or the Ministry of War. In the case of high dignitaries, the ruler was given a choice between two to three candidates. Major issues were typically discussed at official audiences or informal meetings, and it was necessary to reach a broad consensus among court dignitaries before making any significant decisions.

During the reigns of the Hongwu Emperor and his successors, China generally experienced a period of economic growth and political stability. In the 17th century, a combination of climate changes and poor economic policies led to widespread famines and epidemics. As a result, the government&#x27;s authority weakened, and numerous uprisings erupted. In 1644, the rebel army successfully captured Beijing, leading to the suicide of the last Ming emperor, the Chongzhen Emperor (). The leader of the uprising, Li Zicheng, declared himself the emperor of the new Shun dynasty. To defeat the rebels, Wu Sangui, the last Ming general in the northeast, invited the Manchu-led Eight Banners of the Qing dynasty to enter the Central Plains. The Manchus then occupied northern China that same year.

Despite losing control of the north, members of the Ming imperial family continued to rule over southern China. However, they were gradually pushed out by the Manchus until the last Ming emperor, Zhu Youlang, was executed in 1662 in Burma. Later historians referred to the emperors of the Ming regimes in southern China as the rulers of the Southern Ming dynasty.
== List of emperors ==
The emperor&#x27;s personal name () was tabooed after his ascension to the throne. He was referred to and addressed with titles of varying degrees of formality—Your Majesty (), His Majesty the Emperor (, or simply ). After death, the emperor received an honorary posthumous name (), usually consisting of nineteen written characters for emperors of the Ming dynasty; however, the founder of the dynasty, the Hongwu Emperor, was honored with a name of twenty-three written characters. Another name given posthumously was the temple name () which, along with the posthumous name, was used for worship in the Imperial Ancestral Temple. Due to the repetition of the same temple and posthumous names for emperors of different dynasties, the dynastic name is used as a differentiator when necessary. For example, the Hongwu Emperor is frequently referred to as &quot;Ming Taizu&quot;.

Era name (), or &quot;reign title&quot;, was chosen at the beginning of the emperor&#x27;s reign to reflect the political, economic, and/or social landscapes at the time. During the Ming dynasty, except for Emperor Yingzong, the emperors only declared one era name during their reign, whereas emperors of previous dynasties usually had multiple era names. As a result, the emperors of the Ming dynasty were commonly referred to by their single era names.

<doc id="530251" wikidata="Q2526966" url="?curid=530251" title="Deathlok">
<text>Deathlok (also referred to as Deathlok the Demolisher) is the name of several fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The first Deathlok, Luther Manning, appeared in &quot;Astonishing Tales&quot; #25 (Aug. 1974), created by Rich Buckler. At least five subsequent Marvel characters have used the &quot;Deathlok&quot; identity since then: Michael Collins, Jack Truman, [[Deathlok|Rebecca Ryker]], Henry Hayes, and [[Deathlok|Jemma Simmons]]. A recurring theme among these characters is that a dead human has been reanimated with cybernetic technology. &quot;Deathlok technology&quot; has also been used thematically by Marvel writers in other stories.

The character has also appeared on television in animation and live action, with J. August Richards and Bill Paxton respectively portraying the original variations [[Deathlok|Mike Peterson]] and [[Deathlok|John Garrett]] in the television series &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot;

==Creation==
Originally conceived as the main character in a novel, Rich Buckler got the opportunity to use the character within the comics medium. Development was put on a hold when Marvel Comics was negotiating for the comic book adaptation rights for the television series &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;, until Charlton Comics claimed the rights. Buckler then purchased a copy of the television series&#x27; source material &quot;Cyborg&quot; by Martin Caidin. Buckler stated, &quot;So what I did was rethink part of it, and make sure things were the opposite...so while the Six Million Dollar Man was a good looking guy, I took that all away from Deathlok. I made him a monster and instead of being friends with technology he was enemies with it and then it developed from there. And it actually got deeper as a concept.&quot;

Buckler stated the character was an inversion of Captain America.

The original comic run makes numerous references to Mary Shelly&#x27;s novel &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, a character whom Deathlok shares many parallels with.

==Publication history==
Although initially announced as the new lead feature for Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Worlds Unknown&quot; comic, under the title &quot;Cyborg&quot;, the first Deathlok series ran in &quot;Astonishing Tales&quot; #25–28, 30–36 (cover-dated Aug. 1974–July 1976). This initial version of the character, Luther Manning, later guest-starred with Spider-Man in &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; #46 (June 1976), and the story from the cancelled &quot;Astonishing Tales&quot; comics was finished in &quot;Marvel Spotlight&quot; #33 (April 1977). Deathlok subsequently appeared with the Thing in &quot;Marvel Two-in-One&quot; #27 and 54. The Luther Manning Deathlok then appeared in &quot;Captain America&quot; #286–288 (Oct.-Dec. 1983).

A new Deathlok, Michael Collins, debuted in the miniseries &quot;Deathlok&quot; #1–4 (July–Oct. 1990, reprinted as &quot;Deathlok Special&quot; #1–4 the following year). This second Deathlok went on to a 34-issue series cover-dated July 1991 to April 1994, plus two summer &quot;Annual&quot;s in 1992 and 1993. The third Deathlok, S.H.I.E.L.D. espionage agent Jack Truman, debuted in an 11-issue miniseries (Sept. 1999–June 2000). Deathlok has also appeared in four issues of the miniseries &quot;Beyond!&quot;, and Michael Collins, in human form and not as Deathlok, appeared in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #544–545 (May–June 2007). Multiple unnamed Deathlok units appear in &quot;Black Panther&quot; vol. 4 #1–6. Possessing no human sentience, they were automatons created from corpses of soldiers killed in Iraq.

A new Deathlok named Henry Hayes debuted during the &quot;Original Sin&quot; event from Nathan Edmondson and Mike Perkins. While the character was considered to be an adaptation of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) portrayal of Deathlok, Mike Petersen, Edmondson stated that the coincidences were just &quot;happy similarities&quot; and that ultimately they tried to go for a total original concept. This Deathlok had his own ongoing series that began in October 2014.

A new Deathlok named Jemma Simmons, first appeared in &quot;S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; vol. 3 #1 by Mark Waid and Carlos Pacheco, adapted from the MCU character of the same name, before becoming Deathlok in the sequel comic series &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; #8, turned into one by Hayes to save her life.

==Fictional character biography==
===Luther Manning===

Colonel Luther Manning is an American soldier from Detroit, Michigan, who, after being fatally injured, is reanimated in a post-apocalyptic future (originally given the date of 1990) only to discover that what remains of his dead body has been turned into the experimental Deathlok cyborg by Simon Ryker. He verbally communicates with his symbiotic computer, to which he refers as the abbreviated &quot;&#x27;Puter&quot;. He escapes from Ryker&#x27;s control, although he dreams he has regained his humanity. He battles the evil corporate and military regimes that have taken over the US, while simultaneously struggling not to lose his humanity. He battles Simon Ryker and the first War-Wolf, and he encounters his wife and son for the first time after becoming a cyborg. He battles Simon Ryker&#x27;s Super-Tank, and then begins a hunt for a &quot;cyborg doctor&quot;. He battles Simon Ryker as the Savior Machine, and his mind is ultimately transferred into a Luther Manning clone. He battles mutants alongside a time-traveling Spider-Man. He begins working for the CIA, encounters Godwulf for the first time, and is then finally sent back in time to the modern era.

Deathlok battles the Devil-Slayer, but then battles demons alongside Devil-Slayer. He later becomes controlled by Mentallo and the Fixer and is sent to assassinate the President, but is stopped by the Thing and Nick Fury. After his capture he becomes catatonic, and is taken to England for treatment by the Thing. He is cured by Louis Kort, and Nick Fury takes him into custody. Deathlok is rebuilt by Roxxon as a robot and sent to sabotage Project Pegasus. The robot battles the Thing and Quasar, and self-destructs. The real Deathlok, now working for the Brand Corporation, battles Captain America and a time-traveling Luther Manning clone. Alongside Captain America, Godwulf, and the Redeemers, he battles Hellinger. Some time later, the &quot;mainstream timeline&quot; Luther Manning begins dreaming that he is Deathlok. He is charged with temporal energy by Timestream. Timestream recruits this &quot;mainstream&quot; human Manning. Deathlok, Timestream, and Manning battled the Collins Deathlok, Siege, and Godwulf. The Manning Deathlok eventually returns to his own time and overthrows the megalomaniac who had taken over the country. Manning remains in his near-future alternate reality, searching for a purpose in life and unable to disconnect himself from the machine bonded to him.

Eventually, Manning travels to the mainstream Marvel Universe and encounters Daredevil and the Kingpin. He lives a life of solitude until being apprehended by S.H.I.E.L.D., from which he is later kidnapped by the supervillain the Owl and, immobilized, put up for auction as a weapon. Before a sale can be completed, he is stolen by the crime lord the Hood and sent on a kamikaze decoy run.

===John Kelly===

Kelly first appeared as Deathlok in &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot; #62. This version of Deathlok was originally controlled by Kelly until its systems determined that Kelly&#x27;s brain function was detrimental to its completion of the &quot;First Run&quot; program. The Deathlok unit then completed its mission. Kelly&#x27;s brain was removed from the cyborg and disposed of. One of Ryker&#x27;s assistants took the brain presumably for use in the SIEGE unit. This version was made for the United States Army by the CIA&#x27;s Deathlok-program co-head, Harlan Ryker, after studying Luther Manning&#x27;s cyborg body. The Kelly Deathlok later became known as Siege.

===Michael Collins===

Professor Michael Collins was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was a pacifist working for the Roxxon cybernetics corporation Cybertek. Upon discovery of the Deathlok program, he was shot with a sedative by Harlan Ryker and his brain was transplanted into the body of the John Kelly Deathlok cyborg. The machine was used against rebels fighting against Roxxon&#x27;s influence in the fictional South American country of Estrella. Collins regained his consciousness during that mission and stopped the cyborg programming that would have killed a small child.

Although his brain was intended to serve only as a medium for the robot&#x27;s programming, he was able to assert his will over it (installing a &quot;no-killing parameter&quot; into its programming). The computer is fully willing to listen to Collins, though he must take care to present his orders in a way that helps fulfill the mission and keep people from dying. The computer is fully capable of understanding distinct concepts, such as bluffing, as when Collins is forced to pretend to take a hostage. Later he met Jesus Badalamente and also battles Mainframe. Collins learns that his human body was still alive, and encounters Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. Collins aids Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. in preventing a nuclear strike on the United States. With the Fantastic Four, the X-Men, and Misty Knight, Deathlok later battles Mechadoom. He meets the Punisher, and battles Silvermane. After that, he teams up with Spider-Man and several other heroes to stop the Sinister Six. He next meets Moses Magnum. Collins finally reveals his existence as a cyborg to his family. Collins then begins to search for his human body. During this time he fought the Sleepwalker, and helps Silver Sable retrieve a purloined Statue of Liberty. He assists a makeshift team of other heroes in the &quot;Maximum Carnage&quot; incident, protecting the people of New York from a mass-murdering group of supervillains.

During the events of the miniseries &quot;Beyond!&quot;, the cosmic being the Stranger (pretending to be the Beyonder) transported Collins to an alien planet, where he was forced to live for years until being rescued with the aid of several other heroes. However, his rescue required the sacrifice of Greg Willis, the superhero known as Gravity. As an act of gratitude, Collins arranged Gravity&#x27;s funeral. When Willis&#x27; body was later stolen by the cosmic entity known as Epoch, Collins enlisted the aid of the Fantastic Four in retrieving it.

===Jack Truman/Larry Young===
Jack Truman, also known as Agent 18, was an agent of the international espionage outfit S.H.I.E.L.D. who was transformed into a cyborg to battle the Red Skull. Through telepathic means, he eventually swapped his mind into the body of another former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and a rival, Larry Young. Young was considered as a &quot;potential recruit&quot; for the Initiative program.

In the &quot;Vengeance&quot; mini-series, Truman was still trapped in Larry Young&#x27;s body, while Young was unable to get to grips with the cyborg body and was unable to function without appropriate maintenance, with his body seen rusting in a junk yard.

===Project: Deathlok===
During the &quot;Dark Reign&quot; storyline, a H.A.M.M.E.R. strike force consisting of corpses animated with crude bionics was sent to capture a super-soldier research center known as &quot;The World&quot;. These models acted like traditional zombies, craving brains. Their mission was unsuccessful and as a result, the research group which produced them, called &quot;Project: Deathlok&quot;, was scrapped.

===Death Locket===
In the &quot;Avengers Arena&quot; series as part of the &quot;Marvel NOW!&quot; event, a female teenage version of Deathlok dubbed Death Locket is introduced. She is revealed to be Rebecca Ryker, the daughter of Harlan Ryker. After being maimed in an explosion that killed her mother and brother, Rebecca was rebuilt using the Deathlok technology that her father developed. Arcade later kidnaps her alongside the students of the Avengers Academy and Braddock Academy and forces them to fight other teenage superhumans in his latest version of Murderworld.

===Henry Hayes===

A new Deathlok debuted during the &quot;Original Sin&quot; storyline. Henry Hayes worked at Doctors Without Borders. During his duty, he lost a leg in a suicide bomber attack in Kandahar (or was brainwashed into thinking he did). Henry was taken care of by the company Biotek, who provided him with a composite fiber prosthesis. Upon being placed under mind-control, Henry Hayes became Deathlok, where he was used as an assassin, a soldier, a killer, a fighter, and an operative. He had participated in at least one armed conflict alongside organized troops, and assassinated countless people even in populated areas. He was even once close to being captured by S.H.I.E.L.D. when a mission went bad in Russia. Henry Hayes was often memory-wiped and did not remember his assignments. While at MTA Metro-North station, he tried to engage discussion with another leg amputee and advised him to contact Biotek, as his own prosthesis (plastic ones, as it was the only kind his pension afforded him) forced the man to use crutches. This man left, seemingly displeased with the discussion. Immediately afterward, he met Seth Horne, an off-duty S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who was present when the Eye of the Watcher exploded, releasing a blast of energy which revealed deep secrets to anyone in its radius. To Horne, it revealed Hayes&#x27; true story. This level 4 agent wanted to congratulate him, stating that S.H.I.E.L.D. would wish to have him in their ranks. As Henry Hayes really did not know what Horne was talking about, he threatened to call the authorities, forcing the agent to leave after a last congratulations. Immediately, Henry Hayes was ordered to kill him as the announcement board of the station indicated the words &quot;Whiskey David&quot;, triggering Henry Hayes&#x27; Deathlok persona. After following Seth Horne into the restroom, Deathlok quickly executed him, left, took some medications, and returned to his civilian life heading to the train to join his daughter Aria.

===Jemma Simmons===

In the &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; comic book, Jemma Simmons (based on the character from the TV show of the same name) became the newest Deathlok, though she has yet to actually take the name. She becomes one after getting infected with an unknown substance contained within a &quot;targeted DNA bomb&quot; that begins to deteriorate her condition, which also placed her in a coma. With the help of Henry Hayes and Bobbi Morse, she is transformed into a Deathlok, which successfully saves her life.

===Deathloks of Lingares===
During the &quot;Iron Man 2020&quot; event, Force Works encounters a group of Deathloks on the island of Lingares who overwhelm and capture them. Quake states to the soldiers that the dead that captured them are Deathloks. With Quake translating, War Machine, U.S. Agent, and Mockingbird learned that someone called the &quot;Scientist&quot; showed up claiming to help them where he made Deathloks from the fallen countrymen to help deal with a giant. Unfortunately, something went wrong. It is soon discovered that the giant attacking Lingares is Ultimo who attacks both sides. As Quake, U.S. Agent, and Mockingbird get the prisoners to safety, War Machine fights off his paralysis and starts fighting the Deathloks trying to experiment on him. War Machine is then saved by someone he recognizes who is in need of his services. Moments later, War Machine arrives with his armor, U.S. Agent&#x27;s shield, and the equipment of Quake and Mockingbird as he fights off the Deathloks. The rest of Force Works discover that War Machine&#x27;s rescuer is MODOK Superior. It is then revealed that MODOK Superior created these Deathloks to help gain control of Ultimo which transforms him into Ulti-MODOK. Once the bearded Deathlok with the central processing unit is beheaded, James Rhodes briefly turns himself into a Deathlok to control the other Deathloks who follow Ulti-MODOK into the lava-filled chasm that Quake briefly opened.

==Powers and abilities==
===Manning===
Col. Luther Manning&#x27;s body was rebuilt into a cyborg body by Harlan Ryker. Deathlok&#x27;s mechanical, cybernetic physiology granted him several superhuman powers including superhuman strength, stamina, agility, reflexes, and a computer augmented brain. The right arm and left half of his face are armored cybernetic implants. He wears a woven metal-mesh body suit of considerable durability. Deathlok also carried a helium-neon laser pistol designed by the U.S. Army of his time, and a throwing dagger. Manning was a military academy graduate, and a brilliant military strategist. He is a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, and proficient with knives, daggers, handguns, and laser pistols. He was later captured and upgraded by Earth-616&#x27;s S.H.I.E.L.D. and given jet boots that allowed him to leap at great heights and his other abilities were perhaps enhanced to greater levels.

===Collins===
Michael Collins&#x27; human brain was transplanted into a cyborg body by a group of scientists at Cybertek. His cyborg body grants him the same powers as Manning, only with much greater strength, speed, and resistance to injury. He possesses a broad spectrum of visual and auditory powers. Deathlok has the ability to interface with virtually any computer system. He is also able to project his consciousness and sensory projections directly into the Net, making him capable of directly hacking computer systems far more efficiently than a traditional hacker. His body can also target (nearly infallibly) multiple objects and track them. He could scan the entire electromagnetic spectrum. He has learned to use internal nano-bots to repair and alter both his organic and inorganic parts, enabling him to appear as either a humanoid cyborg, or completely human. He also has a very sophisticated A.I., capable of quickly making complex strategies and evaluating their chance of success. If requested, the A.I. can take control of the body to perform these operations. Collins himself possesses no combat skills, but under computer-guided combat routines, he is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant with an extensive database of combat techniques and strategies.

Collins is an excellent computer programmer with an advanced degree in computer science and prosthetics, and helped construct the Deathlok body, along with other Cybertek scientists including William Hansen, Ben Jacobs, Stanley Cross, Dr. Hu, and Jim Dworman. After becoming Deathlok, Collins later modified his own systems. Like Manning, Collins wears a woven metal-mesh body suit of considerable durability. He carries a plasma pistol which draws its energy from his internal power source. Thus, the weapon can only be fired if in contact with the outlets in Deathlok&#x27;s hand. Deathlok also possesses a collapsible plasma rifle capable of greater firepower with the same limitations, a supply of fragmentation plasma grenades, and a molybdenum steel knife. He wears a wrist bracelet that allows Deathlok to override similar cybernetic operating systems, and an adamantium/vibranium alloy shock dampening helmet. He sometimes uses a refitted Cybertek Dragonfly fighter with a range of several hundred miles.

==Other versions==
===Mutant X===
In the &quot;Mutant X&quot; reality, Deathlok is a member of the Avengers.

===Deathlok-dominated future===
In the pages of &quot;Savage Avengers&quot;, an unidentified Earth has its 2099 dominated by Deathloks led by a variation of Ultron who has taken the name &quot;Deathlok Prime&quot;. Doom 2099 was shown to be an inmate at Hellrock Prison where he was held in a special area. When a time-displaced Dagger comes upon his cell, Doom 2099 is offered a deal to join the Avengers. Doom 2099 accepts so that he can take his revenge on Ultron.

===Abomination Deathlok===
On Earth-11045, a variant of Abomination/Emil Blonsky molded with Deathlok technology appears as Abomination Deathlok as a member of Kang the Conqueror&#x27;s Chronos Corps.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; #70 (February 2005), the Ultimates fight a person they refer to as Luther Manning, who looks like Deathlok and whom Spider-Man describes as a &quot;half-robot half-zombie guy&quot;. The superheroes take him into custody.

===Deathlok Prime===
Wolverine&#x27;s rogue ops team joins an alternate future Deathlok-Prime – now free from its homicidal human host&#x27;s brain – to face down invaders from a different possible future where X-Force, and all other superheroes, have been turned into &quot;Deathloks&quot; controlled by worldly authorities with popular support, which produces a crime-free utopia for everyone else. Deathlok appeared later as a guest speaker for one of the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning&#x27;s classes. Deathlok revealed the potential futures of the students present and the probabilities of them occurring. Notably, Deathlok refused to comment on Genesis&#x27; future, revealing to him in private that only he can choose his fate.

===X-Factor===
In &quot;X-Factor&quot; #231 (April 2012), in a version of reality where Wanda Maximoff declared &quot;no more humans&quot; instead of &quot;no more mutants&quot;, Tony Stark is attacked by a mostly-cyborg version of Steve Rogers, who refers to himself as &quot;Deathlok&quot;.

===Amalgam===
An original, alternate universe variant of Deathlok from Earth-9602 appears in the Amalgam Comics one-shot &quot;Bruce Wayne: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot;. This version is Jason Todd, a S.H.I.E.L.D. who was mentored by Bruce Wayne and Moonwing and eventually succeeded the latter. After being wounded by the villain Hyena, he is recovered by Hydra, who transform him into a cyborg.

===Tomorrow Dies Today===
Featured in the &quot;Weapon X&quot; comic, the Roxxon-controlled future known as Earth-10511 where a version of Deathlok is known as &quot;General&quot;.

==In other media==
===Television===
* A team of Deathloks appear in the &quot;Black Panther&quot; episode &quot;To the End&quot;. They are sent by the US government to ostensibly assist Wakanda in repelling an invasion by a neighboring country backed by Klaw while secretly coercing or fostering a regime friendly to an American agenda. They arrive in time, but are sent back by Black Panther.
* The Deathlok concept is adapted for the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) series &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; The series&#x27; primary incarnation is Mike Peterson (portrayed by J. August Richards), who was enhanced with a variation of the Extremis drug created by Project Centipede after being injured. After Phil Coulson&#x27;s team manage to save his life and avert civilian casualties when he goes into a rampage, Peterson joins S.H.I.E.L.D. However, on a later mission, he is severely injured and captured by Project Centipede, a division of the terrorist organization Hydra, and converted into a cyborg assassin. He is eventually saved from Hydra by Coulson&#x27;s team and helps to prevent the terrorists from using the company Cybertek to create an army of Deathloks. Following this, Peterson leaves on a mission of self-discovery in the first season finale. He reappears to aid Coulson in the second season while the latter is on the run from an independent faction of S.H.I.E.L.D., having been personally contacted and recruited by Coulson to work as his agent in the intervening months and provided with several technological upgrades. Later in the season, Peterson is recaptured by Hydra, who remove his cybernetic parts. Once he is back in S.H.I.E.L.D.&#x27;s care, they offer to restore his missing prosthetics and abilities. He makes his final appearance in the series&#x27; 100th episode, &quot;The Real Deal&quot;, wherein he aids Coulson in sealing an inter-dimensional rift while fighting manifestations of his pre-Deathlok form, Hive, Lash, and the alien Vrellnexians. Mike also attends Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons&#x27; wedding before leaving once more.
** In the episode &quot;Ragtag&quot;, Coulson&#x27;s team discover files on &quot;Project Deathlok&quot; while infiltrating Cybertek and discover that S.H.I.E.L.D. turncoat John Garrett was the first Deathlok.
* Deathlok appears in &quot;Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.&quot;, voiced by Mark Hildreth. This version is from a future where the Skrulls successfully invaded Earth, and was turned into a cyborg and sent back in time to change the timeline. He comes into conflict with the Agents of S.M.A.S.H., who are unaware of his motives, before they learn the truth and become allies to him.

===Film===
* In the early 1990s, a Deathlok film was at the script stage, with Randall Frakes as the screenwriter. Paramount Pictures bought the film rights in 2001, and hired Lee Tamahori to direct. Stu Zicherman and Raven Metzner were assigned as writers, while Avi Arad and Steven Paul would produce. In 2004, Paul McGuigan was being considered to replace Tamahori, while David Self provided rewrites. McGuigan later revealed that he was involved, but Marvel Studios put the film on a hiatus. He also praised Self&#x27;s screenplay and that he envisioned Robert Downey Jr. for the lead role.

==In popular culture==
* In an interview, artist George Pérez described Deathlok inspiring him during the creation of the DC Comics character Cyborg. &quot;In the case of Cyborg I was inspired visually - and I think it is obvious from the head - by Deathlok... then I decided to make him more robotic than android by making more metallic parts of him, so that he wasn&#x27;t quite as human... but the half-face metallic plate was obviously inspired by Deathlok by Rich Buckler.&quot;
* &quot;Psychotron&quot; by Megadeth (from the album &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot;, 1992) was inspired by the Deathlok character.

<text>Microfiber (microfibre in British English) is synthetic fibre finer than one denier or decitex/thread, having a diameter of less than ten micrometers.

The most common types of microfiber are made variously of polyesters; polyamides (e.g., nylon, Kevlar, Nomex); and combinations of polyester, polyamide, and polypropylene. Microfiber is used to make mats, knits, and weaves, for apparel, upholstery, industrial filters, and cleaning products. The shape, size, and combinations of synthetic fibers are chosen for specific characteristics, including softness, toughness, absorption, water repellence, electrostatics, and filtering ability.

They are commonly used for cleaning scratch prone surfaces such as displays, glass, and lenses. Microfiber cloth makes use of van der Waals force to remove dirt without scratches.

==History==
Production of ultra-fine fibers (finer than 0.7 denier) dates to the late 1950s, using melt-blown spinning and flash spinning techniques. Initially, only fine staples of random length could be manufactured and very few applications were found. Then came experiments to produce ultra-fine fibers of a continuous filament: the most promising experiments were made in Japan in the 1960s, by Miyoshi Okamoto, a scientist at Toray Industries. Okamoto&#x27;s discoveries and those of Toyohiko Hikota led to many industrial applications, including Ultrasuede, one of the first successful synthetic microfibers, which entered the market in the 1970s. Microfiber&#x27;s use in the textile industry then expanded. Microfibers were first publicized in the early 1990s, in Sweden, and saw success as a product in Europe over the course of the decade.

==Apparel==

===Clothing===
Microfiber fabrics are man-made and frequently used for athletic wear, such as cycling jerseys, because the microfiber material wicks moisture (perspiration) away from the body; subsequent evaporation cools the wearer.

Microfiber can be used to make tough, very soft fabric for clothing, often used in skirts, jackets, bathrobes, and swimwear. Microfiber can be made into Ultrasuede, a synthetic imitation of suede leather, which is cheaper and easier to clean and sew than natural suede leather.

===Accessories===
Microfiber is used to make many accessories that traditionally have been made from leather: wallets, handbags, backpacks, book covers, shoes, cell phone cases, and coin purses. Microfiber fabric is lightweight, durable, and somewhat water repellent, so it makes a good substitute.

Another advantage of microfiber fabric (compared to leather) is that it can be coated with various finishes and can be treated with antibacterial chemicals. Fabric can also be printed with various designs, embroidered with colored thread, and heat-embossed.

==Other uses==

===Textiles for cleaning===

In cleaning products, microfiber can be 100% polyester, or a blend of polyester and polyamide (nylon). It can be either a woven product or a non woven product, the latter most often used in limited use or disposable cloths. In the highest-quality fabrics for cleaning applications, the fiber is split during the manufacturing process to produce multi-stranded fibers. A cross section of the split microfiber fabric under high magnification would look like an asterisk.

The split fibers and the size of the individual filaments make the cloths more effective than other fabrics for cleaning purposes. The structure traps and retains the dirt and also absorbs liquids. Unlike cotton, microfiber leaves no lint, the exception being some micro suede blends, where the surface is mechanically processed to produce a soft plush feel.

For microfiber to be most effective as a cleaning product, especially for water-soluble soils and waxes, it should be a split microfiber. Non-split microfiber is little more than a very soft cloth. The main exception is for cloths used for facial cleansing and for the removal of skin oils (sebum), sunscreens, and mosquito repellents from optical surfaces such as cameras, phones and eyeglasses wherein higher-end proprietary woven, 100% polyester cloths using 2 μm filaments, will absorb these types of oils without smearing.

Microfiber used in non-sports-related clothing, furniture, and other applications is not split because it is not designed to be absorbent, just soft. When buying, microfiber may not be labeled to designate whether it is split. One method to determine the type of microfiber is to run the cloth over the palm of the hand. A split microfiber will cling to imperfections of the skin and can be either heard or felt as it does. Alternatively, a small amount of water can be poured onto a hard, flat surface and pushed with the microfiber. If the water is pushed rather than absorbed, it is not split microfiber.

Microfiber can be electrostatically charged for special purposes like filtration.

===Cloths and mops===
Microfiber products used for consumer cleaning are generally constructed from split conjugated fibers of polyester and polyamide. Microfiber used for commercial cleaning products also includes many products constructed of 100% polyester. Microfiber products are able to absorb oils especially well and are not hard enough to scratch even paintwork unless they have retained grit or hard particles from previous use. Due to hydrogen bonding, microfiber cloth containing polyamide absorbs and holds more water than other types of fibres.

Microfiber is widely used by car detailers to handle tasks such as removing wax from paintwork, quick detailing, interior cleaning, glass cleaning, and drying. Because of their fine fibers which leave no lint or dust, microfiber towels are used by car detailers and enthusiasts in a similar manner to a chamois leather.

Microfiber is used in many professional cleaning applications, for example in mops and cleaning cloths. Although microfiber mops cost more than non-microfiber mops, they may be more economical because they last longer and require less effort to use.

Microfiber textiles designed for cleaning clean on a microscopic scale. According to tests, using microfiber materials to clean a surface reduces bacteria by 99%, whereas a conventional cleaning material reduces bacteria by only 33%. Microfiber cleaning tools also absorb fat and grease and their electrostatic properties allow them to attract dust strongly.

Microfiber cloths are also used to clean photographic lenses as they absorb oily matter without being abrasive or leaving a residue, and are sold by major manufacturers such as Sinar, ZEISS, Nikon and Canon. Small microfiber cleaning cloths are commonly sold for cleaning computer screens, cameras, phones and eyeglasses.
Microfiber is unsuitable for some cleaning applications as it accumulates dust, debris, and particles. Sensitive surfaces (such as all high-tech coated surfaces e.g. CRT, LCD and plasma screens) can easily be damaged by a microfiber cloth if it has picked up grit or other abrasive particles during use. One way to minimize the risk of damage to flat surfaces is to use a flat, non-rugged microfiber cloth, as these tend to be less prone to retaining grit.

Rags made of microfiber must only be washed with regular laundry detergent, not oily, self-softening, soap-based detergents. Fabric softener must not be used; the oils and cationic surfactants in the softener and self-softening detergents will clog up the fibers and make them less absorbent until the oils are washed out. Hot temperatures may also cause microfiber cloth to melt or become wrinkled.

===Insulation===
Microfiber materials such as PrimaLoft are used for thermal insulation as a replacement for down feather insulation in sleeping bags and outdoor equipment, because of their better retention of heat when damp or wet. Microfiber is also used for water insulation in automotive car covers. Depending on the technology the fiber manufacturer is using, such material may contain from 2 up to 5 thin layers, merged. Such combination ensures not only high absorption factor, but also breathability of the material, which prevents the greenhouse effect.

===Basketballs===
With microfiber-shelled basketballs already used by FIBA, the NBA introduced a microfiber ball for the 2006–07 season. The ball, which is manufactured by Spalding, does not require a &quot;break-in&quot; period of use as leather balls do and has the ability to absorb water and oils, meaning that sweat from players touching the ball is better absorbed, making the ball less slippery. Over the course of the season, the league received many complaints from players who found that the ball bounced differently from leather balls, and that it left cuts on their hands. On January 1, 2007, the league scrapped the use of all microfiber balls and returned to leather basketballs.

===Other===
Microfibers used in tablecloths, furniture, and car interiors are designed to repel wetting and consequently are difficult to stain. In furniture, microfiber is a close alternative to leather due to the simple upkeep of the qualities of the material. Easy to wipe off liquids and better suited for individuals with pets. Microfiber tablecloths will bead liquids until they are removed and are sometimes advertised showing red wine on a white tablecloth that wipes clean with a paper towel. This and the ability to mimic suede economically are common selling points for microfiber upholstery fabrics (e.g., for couches).

Microfibers are used in towels especially those to be used at swimming pools as even a small towel dries the body quickly. They dry quickly and are less prone than cotton towels to become stale if not dried immediately. Microfiber towels need to be soaked in water and pressed before use, as they would otherwise repel water as microfiber tablecloths do.

Microfiber is also used for other applications such as making menstrual pads, cloth diaper inserts, body scrubbers, face mitts, whiteboard cleaners, and various goods that need to absorb water and/or attract small particles.

In the medical world, the properties of microfibers are used in the coating of certain fabric sheets used to strengthen the original material.

==Environmental and safety issues==
Microfiber textiles tend to be flammable if manufactured from hydrocarbons (polyester) or carbohydrates (cellulose) and emit toxic gases when burning, more so if aromatic (PET, PS, ABS) or treated with halogenated flame retardants and azo dyes. Their polyester and nylon stock are made from petrochemicals, which are not a renewable resource and are not biodegradable.

For most cleaning applications they are designed for repeated use rather than being discarded after use. An exception to this is the precise cleaning of optical components where a wet cloth is drawn once across the object and must not be used again as the debris collected are now embedded in the cloth and may scratch the optical surface. 

Microfiber products also enter the oceanic water supply and food chain similarly to other microplastics. Synthetic clothing made of microfibers that are washed release materials and travel to local wastewater treatment plants, contributing to plastic pollution in water. A study by the clothing brand Patagonia and University of California, Santa Barbara, found that when synthetic jackets made of microfibers are washed, on average of microfibers are released from the washing machine. These microfibers then travel to local wastewater treatment plants, where up to 40% of them enter into rivers, lakes, and oceans where they contribute to the overall plastic pollution. Microfibers account for 85% of man-made debris found on shorelines worldwide. Fibers retained in wastewater treatment sludge (biosolids) that are land-applied can persist in soils.

<doc id="530256" wikidata="Q287183" url="?curid=530256" title="De dicto and de re">
<text>De dicto&quot; and &quot;de re are two phrases used to mark a distinction in intensional statements, associated with the intensional operators in many such statements. The distinction is used regularly in analytical metaphysics and in philosophy of language.

The literal translation of the phrase &quot;de dicto&quot; is &quot;about what is said&quot;, whereas &quot;de re&quot; translates as &quot;about the thing&quot;. The original meaning of the Latin locutions may help to elucidate the living meaning of the phrases, in the distinctions they mark. The distinction can be understood by examples of intensional contexts of which three are considered here: a context of thought, a context of desire, and a context of modality.

==Context of thought==
There are two possible interpretations of the sentence &quot;Peter believes someone is out to get him&quot;: 

On the &quot;de dicto&quot; interpretation, &#x27;someone&#x27; is unspecific and Peter suffers a general paranoia; he believes that it is true that a person is out to get him, but does not necessarily have any beliefs about who this person may be. What Peter believes is that the predication &#x27;someone is out to get Peter&#x27; is satisfied.

On the &quot;de re&quot; interpretation, &#x27;someone&#x27; is specific, picking out some particular individual. There is some person Peter has in mind, and Peter believes that person is out to get him.

In the context of thought, the distinction helps us explain how people can hold seemingly self-contradictory beliefs. Say Lois Lane believes Clark Kent is weaker than Superman. Since Clark Kent is Superman, taken &quot;de re&quot;, Lois&#x27;s belief is untenable; the names &#x27;Clark Kent&#x27; and &#x27;Superman&#x27; pick out an individual in the world, and a person (or super-person) cannot be stronger than himself. Understood &quot;de dicto&quot;, however, this may be a perfectly reasonable belief, since Lois is not aware that Clark and Superman are one and the same.

==Context of desire==

Consider the sentence &quot;Jana wants to marry the tallest man in Fulsom County&quot;. It could be read either &quot;de dicto&quot; or &quot;de re&quot;; the meanings would be different. One interpretation is that Jana wants to marry the tallest man in Fulsom County, whoever he might be. On this interpretation, what the statement tells us is that Jana has a certain unspecific desire; what she desires is for &quot;Jana is marrying the tallest man in Fulsom County&quot; to be true. The desire is directed at that situation, regardless of how it is to be achieved. The other interpretation is that Jana wants to marry a certain man, who in fact happens to be the tallest man in Fulsom County. Her desire is for &quot;that man&quot;, and she desires herself to marry &quot;him&quot;. The first interpretation is the &quot;de dicto&quot; interpretation, because Jana&#x27;s desire relates to the words &quot;the tallest man in Fulsom County&quot;, and the second interpretation is the &quot;de re&quot; interpretation, because Jana&#x27;s desire relates to the man those words refer to.

Another way to understand the distinction is to ask what Jana would want if a nine-foot-tall immigrant moved to Fulsom county. If she continued to want to marry the same man – and perceived this as representing no change in her desires – then she could be taken to have meant the original statement in a &quot;de re&quot; sense. If she no longer wanted to marry that man but instead wanted to marry the new tallest man in Fulsom County, and saw this as a continuation of her earlier desire, then she meant the original statement in a &quot;de dicto&quot; sense.

==Context of modality==
The number of discovered chemical elements is 118. Take the sentence &quot;The number of chemical elements is necessarily greater than 100&quot;. Again, there are two interpretations as per the &quot;de dicto&quot;/&quot;de re&quot; distinction. 

* The &quot;de dicto&quot; interpretation formula_1 says that, in other accessible possible worlds, even if the inner workings of the atom could differ (so that formula_2 have different values), the number of elements still could not be 100 or fewer.
* The &quot;de re&quot; interpretation &quot;formula_3&quot; says that, the inner workings of the atom are what they are (formula_4 in all accessible possible worlds), and the number 118 is greater than 100.

Another example: &quot;The President of the US in 2001 could not have been Al Gore&quot;. 

* The &quot;de dicto&quot; reading formula_5 says that, in other accessible possible worlds, even if the result of the 2000 election could differ, the President of the US in 2001 still could not have been Al Gore. This claim seems false; presumably, in some other accessible possible worlds where the Supreme Court did not rule that Bush had won the election, Al Gore could have been the President of the US in 2001 in that possible world.
* The &quot;de re&quot; reading formula_6 says that, the President of the US in 2001 is who he is, and that is George Bush in all accessible possible worlds, and George Bush could not have been Al Gore.

==Representing &quot;de dicto&quot; and &quot;de re&quot; in modal logic==

In modal logic the distinction between &quot;de dicto&quot; and &quot;de re&quot; is one of scope. In &quot;de dicto&quot; claims, any existential quantifiers are within the scope of the modal operator, whereas in &quot;de re&quot; claims the modal operator falls within the scope of the existential quantifier. For example:
Generally speaking, formula_7 is logically equivalent to formula_8, both meaning that all &quot;x&quot; in all the possible worlds are &quot;A&quot; (assuming that the range of quantification/domain of discourse is the same in all the accessible possible worlds); However, formula_9 means that each accessible possible world has its own &quot;x&quot; that is &quot;A&quot;, but they are not necessarily the same, whereas formula_10 means that there is a special &quot;x&quot; that is &quot;A&quot; in all accessible possible worlds. 

Similarly, formula_11 is logically equivalent to formula_12, both meaning that in some accessible possible world, there is some &quot;x&quot; that is &quot;A&quot;; However, formula_13 means that in some accessible possible world, all &quot;x&quot; are &quot;A&quot;, whereas formula_14 means that for each &quot;x&quot; in the range of quantification/domain of discourse, there is some accessible possible world where &quot;x&quot; is &quot;A&quot;, but it can be true that no world has two &quot;x&quot; that are both &quot;A&quot;.

<text>Gustav Friedrich Waagen (11 February 1794 – 15 July 1868) was a German art historian. His opinions were greatly respected in England, where he was invited to give evidence before the royal commission inquiring into the condition and future of the National Gallery, for which he was a leading candidate to become director. He died on a visit to Copenhagen in 1868.

==Biography==
Waagen was born in Hamburg, the son of a painter and a nephew and lover of the poet Ludwig Tieck. Having passed through the college of Hirschberg, Silesia (modern Jelenia Góra), he volunteered for service in the Napoleonic campaign of 1813–14, and on his return attended the lectures at Breslau University. He devoted himself to the study of art, which he pursued in the great European galleries, first in Germany, then in the Netherlands and Italy.

A pamphlet on the brothers Van Eyck led in 1832 to his appointment to the directorship of the newly founded Berlin Museum (now vastly expanded as the Berlin State Museums), although his main interest was the paintings in what is now the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin. The result of a journey to London and Paris was an important publication in three volumes, &quot;Kunstwerke und Künstler in England und Paris&quot; (Berlin, 1837–39), which became the basis for his more important &quot;The Treasures of Art in Great Britain&quot;, translated by Elizabeth Eastlake, (4 vols, London, 1854 and 1857). This remains a significant source for the provenance of paintings then in English collections. Although Waagen has been criticised for his &quot;amateurish and erratic expertise&quot; by modern standards, his work was regarded as highly authoritative for the following half-century.

In 1844, he was appointed professor of art history at Berlin University, and in 1861 he was called to St Petersburg as adviser in the arranging and naming of the pictures in the imperial collection. On his return, he published a book on the Hermitage collection (Munich, 1864). Among his other publications are some essays on Rubens, Mantegna and Signorelli; &quot;Kunstwerke und Künstler in Deutschland&quot;; and &quot;Die vornehmsten Kunstdenkmäler in Wien&quot;.

In 1849 Waagen became a corresponding member, living abroad, of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands. In 1861, he was elected an honorary associate of the Imperial Academy of Arts in St Petersburg.

<doc id="530264" wikidata="Q284733" url="?curid=530264" title="Jack Marshall">
<text>Sir John Ross Marshall (5 March 1912 – 30 August 1988) was a New Zealand politician of the National Party. He entered Parliament in 1946 and was first promoted to Cabinet in 1951. After spending twelve years as the deputy prime minister of New Zealand, he served as the 28th prime minister from February until December 1972.

The Second National Government, in office since 1960, appeared worn-out and out of touch, and at the time of Marshall&#x27;s appointment it seemed headed for heavy electoral defeat. After Labour&#x27;s victory in the 1972 general election, Marshall became Leader of the Opposition. He was determined to remain as leader of the National Party, but in July 1974 was challenged for the leadership by Robert Muldoon, his deputy, rival and successor.

Marshall&#x27;s politeness and courtesy were well known, and he was sometimes nicknamed &quot;Gentleman Jack&quot;. He disliked the aggressive style of some politicians, preferring a calmer, less confrontational approach. These traits were sometimes misinterpreted as weakness by his opponents. Marshall was a strong believer in pragmatism, and he disliked what he considered populism in other politicians of his day. At his death he was described as &quot;A soft spoken lawyer almost too nice to be a politician&quot;.

== Early life ==
Marshall was born in Wellington. He grew up in Wellington, Whangārei, and Dunedin, attending Whangarei Boys&#x27; High School and Otago Boys&#x27; High School. He was noted for his ability at sports, particularly rugby.

After leaving high school, Marshall studied law at Victoria University College. He gained an LL.B. in 1934 and an LL.M. in 1935. He also worked part-time in a law office. He was deeply involved with the Presbyterian Church, also serving for a time as president of the New Zealand Bible Society.

In 1941, during World War II, Marshall joined the New Zealand Military Forces, and received officer training. In his first few years of service, he was posted to 36th Battalion and served in Fiji, Norfolk Island, New Caledonia, and the Solomon Islands, eventually reaching the rank of major. During this time he also spent five months in the United States at a marine staff school in Virginia. On 29 July 1944, while on leave in Perth, Western Australia, Marshall married Jessie Margaret Livingston, a nurse. At the start of 1945, Marshall was transferred to the Divisional Cavalry Battalion in Italy and participated in the battle of the Senio River and the liberation of Trieste.

== Member of Parliament ==




After the war, Marshall briefly established himself as a barrister, but was soon persuaded to stand as the National Party&#x27;s candidate for the new Wellington seat of Mt Victoria in the 1946 election. He won the seat by 911 votes. He was, however, nearly disqualified by a technicality – Marshall was employed at the time in a legal case for the government, something which ran afoul of rules barring politicians from giving business to their own firms. However, because Marshall had taken on the case before his election (and so could not have influenced the government&#x27;s decision to give him employment), it was obvious that there had been no wrongdoing. As such, the Prime Minister, Peter Fraser of the Labour Party, amended the regulations.

Marshall&#x27;s political philosophy, which was well-defined at this stage, was a mixture of liberal and conservative values. He was opposed to laissez-faire capitalism, but was equally opposed to the redistribution of wealth advocated by socialists – his vision was of a property-owning society under the benign guidance of a fair and just government. Barry Gustafson states, &quot;[Marshall] was strongly motivated by his Christian faith and by an equally deep intellectual commitment to the principles of liberalism.&quot;

=== Cabinet Minister ===
In the 1949 election, Marshall kept his seat. The National Party gained enough seats to form a government, and Sidney Holland became Prime Minister. Marshall was elevated to Cabinet, taking the role of Minister of Statistics and also having ministerial responsibility for the State Advances Corporation. He also became a direct assistant to Holland.
After the 1951 election, Marshall became Minister of Health (although he also retained responsibility for State Advances until 1953). In the 1954 election, his Mt Victoria seat was abolished, and he successfully stood for another Wellington electorate, Karori. After the election, he lost the Health portfolio, instead becoming Minister of Justice and Attorney-General. In these roles, he supported the retention of the capital punishment for murder. In 1957, he proposed a referendum on capital punishment. (New Zealand&#x27;s last execution was carried out in 1957, during Marshall&#x27;s time in office.) He also supported the creation of a separate Court of Appeal.

When Holland became ill, Marshall was part of the group that persuaded him to step down. Keith Holyoake became Prime Minister. Marshall sought the deputy leadership, managing to defeat Jack Watts for this post. The result was kept secret from the caucus and several cabinet ministers privately speculated that Watts had actually won, but Holyoake overturned the result, concerned with Watts&#x27; health.

=== Deputy Prime Minister ===

Shortly after the leadership change, National lost the 1957 election to Labour&#x27;s Walter Nash. Marshall, therefore, became deputy leader of the Opposition. The Nash government did not last long, however – its drastic measures to counter an economic crisis proved unpopular. Marshall was later to admit that the crisis had been prompted by a failure to act by the National government. Labour lost the 1960 election, and National returned to power.

Marshall once more became Deputy Prime Minister, but rather than Attorney-General and Minister of Justice again he was allocated several new positions, including ministerial responsibility for Industries and Commerce, Overseas Trade, Immigration, and Customs. One of his major achievements was the signing of trade arrangements with Australia and the United Kingdom. Marshall also supported the abolition of compulsory union membership, which had been a National Party election policy – when the government eventually decided not to push forward with the change, Marshall&#x27;s relations with some of his colleagues were strained.

Marshall promoted the retention of capital punishment for murder. However, Labour under Arnold Nordmeyer was opposed, and in 1961 ten National MPs, including Robert Muldoon, crossed the floor and voted with Labour to abolish it.

Increasingly, as time went on, Marshall became overworked, with Holyoake giving him more and more cabinet responsibilities. In the 1960s he led negotiations over trade consequences if Britain joined the European Economic Community (EEC). His polite and genial nature suited him well to diplomatic and trade negotiations. He was most noted for his successful negotiating for continued access to Europe for New Zealand farming exports after Britain had joined the EEC. Marshall was also put under considerable pressure by ongoing labour disputes, which he took a significant role in resolving. Relations between Marshall and Robert Muldoon, the Minister of Finance, grew very tense, with Marshall resenting Muldoon&#x27;s open interference in the labour negotiations. Marshall was also responsible for establishing the Accident Compensation Corporation.

=== Prime Minister (1972)===
On 7 February 1972, Holyoake stepped down as Prime Minister. Marshall contested the leadership against Muldoon, and won. Muldoon became Deputy Prime Minister. Marshall was keen to reorganise the government, believing that it had become stagnated and inflexible. The public, however, were tired of the long-serving National government, and considered the reshuffles insufficient.

In the 1972 general election, Norman Kirk&#x27;s Labour Party was triumphant. On 8 December, after Marshall had been in office for less than a year, Kirk was sworn in as Prime Minister and Marshall became the Leader of the Opposition.

=== Leader of the Opposition ===

Marshall became Leader of the Opposition in 1972. He made the choice to not separate the shadow cabinet from the rest of the caucus to encourage party unity. He made minimal changes to his portfolio allocations from February 1972 to highlight National&#x27;s experience and stability, contrasting from the comparative inexperience of the new Labour Government.

On 4 July 1974, Marshall was informed that a leadership challenge from his own deputy, Muldoon, was imminent. Aware that much of his support had drained away, Marshall resigned, leaving Muldoon to take the leadership unopposed. Marshall&#x27;s decline was primarily the result of his inability to damage the highly popular Kirk; Marshall&#x27;s quiet, understated style did not fit well with the aggressive tactics required of an opposition party seeking to return to government. Ironically, Kirk died later that same year and his replacement, Bill Rowling, was perceived as a quiet and non-confrontational leader, just as Marshall had been.

After relinquishing the leadership Marshall remained on the front bench as Shadow Minister of Overseas Trade. He decided to retire from parliament at the .

== Later life and death ==

He remained active in the National Party organisation, and was highly respected for his many years of service. Marshall was initially reticent on his successors activities, though he became publicly more critical of Muldoon&#x27;s aggressive personality with time. Following the Moyle Affair he was interviewed on television about the incident in which he criticised Muldoon&#x27;s behavior, of accusing Labour MP Colin Moyle of being picked up by the police for homosexual activities, stating &quot;I think anyone who indulges in this kind of conduct is damaging himself and lowering the status of Parliament&quot;. Over time he grew ever more critical of Muldoon, accusing him of being overly aggressive and controlling. Muldoon&#x27;s highly controversial decision to allow a visit by a rugby union team from apartheid South Africa exasperated Marshall even more. He wrote his memoirs (split into two volumes) which &quot;pulled no punches&quot; in his description of Muldoon and his 1974 leadership coup.

In addition to his memoirs, Marshall wrote a law book and published several children&#x27;s books about the adventures of a character named &#x27;Dr Duffer&#x27;. He had first started writing the stories as a law student in his youth, but did not publish the first book until 1978. They were very popular, with the first book selling out within a week and thousands more being ordered. He was active in various charities and cultural organisations, including the New Zealand Chess Association, and was a founder of the New Zealand Portrait Gallery. Many of his later activities were related to his strong Christian faith. Marshall died in Snape, Suffolk, England, on 30 August 1988, en route to Budapest to give an address at the world conference of the United Bible Societies. He was survived by his wife and four children.

==Honours==
In 1953, Marshall was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal, and in 1977 he received the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal.

In the 1973 New Year Honours, Marshall was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour, in recognition of his service as New Zealand prime minister, and the following year he was bestowed with a knighthood as a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire.

In the 1992 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Margaret, Lady Marshall, was appointed a Companion of the Queen&#x27;s Service Order for community service.

<text>Lazar Gulkowitsch (; 20 December 1898 – July 1941), also Gulkovich or Gulkowicz; was an eminent Estonian Jewish Studies scholar. He was killed by the Nazis in the summer of 1941.

==Life==
Born in Zirin, Minsk province, Russian Empire as the son of a merchant, Gulkowitsch attended school in Baranavichy and then the famous Mir Yeshiva. During World War I, the family fled to Nikolayev, Ukraine, where Gulkowitsch graduated from high school.

In 1918-1919, Gulkowitsch went to Virbalis in Lithuania, where he headed a Hebrew-speaking basic school and was part of the Rabbinate. He then took up studying medicine at the University of Königsberg, Germany (now Kaliningrad, Russia), but also attended classes in Philosophy and Theology, especially Old Testament. In 1922, he received both a Ph.D. and an M.A., the former with a work on the Kabbalah, and in 1924, and M.D., with a specialization in ophthalmology. In Königsberg, Gulkowitsch married Frieda Rabinowitz (27 February 1900 – Fall 1941); the couple had two daughters.

Immediately after handing in his medical dissertation, however, Gulkowitsch had been invited by the University of Leipzig to take over the lectureship in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Talmudic Sciences from the renowned and recently deceased Israel Issar Kahan. Leipzig in Saxony was then the &quot;mecca&quot; of Oriental Studies in Germany, a very large and very highly regarded university (probably the best outside of Prussia). Gulkowitsch also became director of the Institute of Late Jewish Studies within the Old Testament division of the Divinity School. With his appointment, Gulkowitsch automatically became a German citizen.

At Leipzig, Gulkowitsch not only taught but continued studying there, with the eminent scholars available (especially in Islamic Studies, Near Eastern Studies, Ethiopian Studies, and Assyriology, as well as Philosophy with the eminent Theodor Litt) towards his Habilitation, which he attained in 1927. Continuing at Leipzig as &quot;Privatdozent&quot; (unsalaried senior lecturer who may be called to a professorship), he became, in 1932, Professor extraordinary (full professor without a chair) of Late Jewish Studies within the Faculty of Philosophy, the only such position within a German university. However, already a year later, in 1933, due to the Nazi rise to power and the Nuremberg race laws (which were, i.a., directed against Jews as civil servants, which in Germany professors are), he was dismissed from the University of Leipzig.

In the same year, however, the University of Tartu in Estonia, which had a very distinguished tradition of Oriental Studies and Hebrew, had opened, pushed by the local scholars and supported, i.a., by Albert Einstein - a new Institute of Jewish Studies – a remarkable and defiant feat for 1933, even for an independent country like Estonia proud of its minority rights laws. Gulkowitsch received the appointment as Professor and Chair of Jewish Studies and started teaching in Tartu in 1934. He attracted many high-calibre graduate students (mostly Jewish) and established an international publication series on Jewish Studies. Gulkowitsch taught in German; the Tartu institute was probably the only place in the world where scholarship on Jewish issues in German was possible to be upheld during times of the Holocaust. During his Tartu tenure, Gulkowitsch travelled as much abroad as was possible during that time, especially to Sweden (Uppsala University) and Britain (University of Cambridge).

After the Soviet Union invaded and annexed Estonia for the first time in 1940, Gulkowitsch&#x27;s chair was abolished in 1941 and he himself dismissed. When the Nazis invaded Estonia in the same year, Gulkowitsch and, perhaps some weeks later, his entire family were – like almost 1,000 Estonian Jews who had not been deported and remained there – murdered by the Nazis.

==Work==
Gulkowitsch&#x27;s methodology was philological, he approached his studies from the perspective of a critical reading of the relevant texts. Gulkowitsch&#x27;s main areas of research covered the fields of: 
*Chassidism (towards which he was critical as an irrational and mystic phenomenon)
*the Kabbalah (as a rational system)
*linguistic history of Hebrew and methodology of philological approaches generally
*translations and editions of Talmudic tracts
*Maimonides and Spinoza
The irrational-mystic approach to the study of religion also has its proponents (one could mention the tradition of Rudolf Otto and his classic &quot;The Holy&quot; (1917) here), but in the Comparative Religion field, Gulkowitsch&#x27;s approach, if somehow modified, could today be considered mainstream. This is less so within Jewish Studies (and the study of that discipline), partially for historical reasons, because the rationalism of Gulkowitsch&#x27;s style seemed to some unduly accommodationist to non-Jewish principles and systems of thought and too critical of its mystic traditions (Gulkowitsch indeed demystifies the Kabbala and the Talmud and is very critical of Chassidism). Thus, Jewish Studies scholars like Gerschom Sholem have criticized, and continue to criticize, Gulkowitsch&#x27;s work.

Because many of Gulkowitsch&#x27;s writings after 1933 were published in German in Estonia, they were actually not very well distributed and did not become part of the scholarly discourse of Jewish Studies, although they are of an extremely high quality and put Gulkowitsch clearly at the forefront of his area. Recent efforts to republish his most significant works with Germany&#x27;s leading publisher of Judaica, Mohr Siebeck in Tübingen, failed in 2005, after agreement with the press had already been reached, due to unknown reasons on the publishers&#x27; side.

<doc id="530269" wikidata="Q2066913" url="?curid=530269" title="Sleat">
<text>Sleat is a peninsula and civil parish on the island of Skye in the Highland council area of Scotland, known as &quot;the garden of Skye&quot;. It is the home of the clan &quot;MacDonald of Sleat&quot;. The name comes from the Scottish Gaelic , which in turn comes from Old Norse &quot;sléttr&quot; (smooth, even), which well describes Sleat when considered in the surrounding context of the mainland, Skye and Rùm mountains that dominate the horizon all about Sleat.

== Geography ==
The peninsula extends from an isthmus between the heads of Loch Eishort and Loch na Dal for southwest to Point of Sleat at the southern tip of Skye. It is bounded on the northwest by Loch Eishort and on the southeast by the Sound of Sleat. Most of Sleat, unlike most of Skye, is fairly fertile, and though there are hills, most do not reach a great height.

=== Communities ===
Sleat is a traditional parish that has several communities and two major landowners (the Clan Donald Lands Trust and Eilean Iarmain Estate). Most of the population lives on the southern side of the peninsula. The main settlements along the Sound of Sleat are, from north east to south west, Isleornsay, Teangue, Ferindonald, Kilmore, Armadale, Ardvasar and Aird of Sleat. On the northwest side are Tokavaig and Tarskavaig.

Sleat Community Trust (), the local development trust, has purchased the Skye Ferry Filling Station at Armadale and in common with many communities is investigating the options for renewable energy production. It also owns Sleat Renewables Ltd., a timber production company. In October 2007 the Trust hosted the Highlands and Islands Community Energy Company annual conference.

== Transport and communications ==
The A851 road links Armadale to the rest of Skye. In the early 2000s the final section of a new double-track road through Sleat from Armadale Ferry to Broadford was finished. After later substantial upgrades by June 2019 it became a S2 road throughout. Most teenage school-children in Sleat travel along the A851 to attend Portree High School, where there is a hostel for those who live particularly far away.

Minor roads connect the two coasts of Sleat, and a minor road also extends beyond Armadale to Aird of Sleat. Beyond Aird a track leads to the Point of Sleat Lighthouse.

A Caledonian MacBrayne car ferry connects Armadale to Mallaig on the mainland.

== Gaelic ==

After the Trotternish peninsula, the Sleat peninsula is the second strongest Gaelic-speaking area in Skye. In the 1901 census, 91% of the population was recorded as speaking Gaelic, with 10% recorded as Gaelic monolinguals. In the 2011 census, 39% of the population in Sleat were recorded as speaking Gaelic, with the highest percentage of Gaelic speakers in Tarskavaig and Achnacloich (51%), and the lowest in Armadale (27%). The local primary school, Bun-sgoil Shlèite, is a designated Gaelic-medium school. There was some local and national controversy in 2006 about the decision to change the status of the school from an English school with a Gaelic medium unit to a Gaelic school but in the end the Highland Council opted for a compromise solution, designating the school as an all-Gaelic school but with an English-medium unit. Sleat is home to Scotland&#x27;s only Gaelic-medium college, Sabhal Mòr Ostaig, which provides university-level education in a number of subjects in Gaelic, and is the largest employer in the area. The Gaelic feature-length film, &quot;,&quot; was largely filmed in Sleat and produced by Christopher Young, a Sleat resident and partial Gaelic speaker.

<text>Mahalalel (, ) is an Antediluvian patriarch named in the Hebrew Bible. He is mentioned in the Sethite genealogy as the grandfather of Enoch and subsequently the ancestor of Noah.

== Etymology ==
The meaning of the name could be translated as &quot;the shining one of El.&quot; The King James Version spells his name Mahalaleel in the Old Testament and Maleleel in the New Testament.

== Biblical narrative ==
Mahalalel was born when his father Kenan (Adam&#x27;s great-grandson through Seth) was 70 years old. He was one of many children of Kenan. (Genesis 5:12-13; 1 Chronicles 1:2; Jubilees 4:14 Luke 3:37). 

When he was aged 54-60, Mahalalel married Dinah, the daughter of his paternal uncle Barakiel. At the age of 65, he fathered Jared (when the Watchers &quot;descended on the earth&quot; as per Jubilees 4:15). He fathered many other children after that point (Genesis 5:15-16).

At the age of 227, he became a grandfather to Jared&#x27;s son Enoch (Genesis 5:18), who was born through Baraka, the daughter of Mahalalel&#x27;s brother Râsûjâl (Jubilees 4:16). 

Sometime before he turned 292, Mahalalel explained to Enoch the first of the two dream visions the latter had, as recounted through the perspective of Enoch:

Roughly 300 years after this incident, Enoch was &quot;taken up&quot; by God (Genesis 5:23-24). At this point, Mahalalel was 592 years old.

When Mahalalel was 840, his 910-year-old father Kenan died (Genesis 5:14).

After Kenan&#x27;s death, Mahalalel lived 55 more years and died at 895 (Genesis 5:17), placing him eighth in the records for the unusually long lifespans for the antediluvian patriarchs. At the time of Mahalalel&#x27;s death, Noah was 234 as per the Masoretic chronology.

== Genealogy ==
== In Islam ==
Mahalalel is mentioned in the various collections of tales of the prophets, which mentions him in an identical manner. Islamic scholar Tabari tells that his story was also found in Persian literature and likens him with the Pishdadian king Hushang.

==Allusions==
===Latter Day Saint usage===
In the original 1835 edition of the &quot;Doctrine and Covenants&quot;, Mahalaleel was used as a code name for Algernon Sidney Gilbert. 

=== Literature ===
Thomas Hardy, in his novel, &quot;The Return of the Native&quot; (1878), references Mahalaleel as one who betokened an advanced lifetime: &quot;The number of their years may have adequately summed up Jared, Mahalaleel, and the rest of the antediluvians, but the age of a modern man is to be measured by the intensity of his history.&quot;

The pet cat that comes to the manor in the storm in Joyce Carol Oates&#x27;s novel &quot;Bellefleur&quot; (1980) is named Mahalaleel.

=== Films ===
Mahalalel is named as part of the Generations of Adam by the narrator of the film &quot;&quot; (1994). 

In the film &quot;Noah&quot; (2014), Lamech (played by Marton Csokas) remembers Mahalalel and other ancestors before conferring the Sethite birthright to the young Noah (Dakota Goyo).

<text>Edward Kent (January 8, 1802 – May 19, 1877) was an American attorney and politician who served as the 12th and 15th governor of Maine. He was among the last prominent members of the Whig Party in Maine before it collapsed in favor of the Republicans. He is the only Maine governor to have been elected to two non-consecutive terms (1838–39 and 1841–42), though his second term was through direct appointment by the Whig-dominated Maine Legislature.

==Early life and education==
Born in 1802 in Concord, New Hampshire, Kent was raised in Bangor, Maine. He graduated from Harvard University in 1821, in the same class as Ralph Waldo Emerson. According to a biographical article reprinted in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;he had no rank in college and in truth was president of the &quot;Lazy Club&quot;.

== Career ==
He apprenticed as a lawyer in Topsham, Maine, but established his own practice in the growing lumber-port of Bangor in 1825. He was elected to the Maine Legislature in 1829 and held political offices on and off the rest of his life, becoming the second mayor of Bangor (1836–1837) and governor of Maine.

Kent went into practice with Jonas Cutting in 1831 and their partnership lasted 18 years. The two constructed the Jonas Cutting–Edward Kent House in Bangor&#x27;s Broadway neighborhood, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as an example of the Greek Revival style.

Kent ended his public life as an associate justice of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court (1859–73). His law partner and neighbor Jonas Cutting served almost concurrently in the same position (1854–75). Kent&#x27;s uncle Prentiss Mellen had been the first chief justice of the same court.

Kent played a part in both instigating and resolving the Aroostook War.

== Personal life ==
While living in Rio de Janeiro, his wife and two children died of yellow fever. His surviving child died soon after they returned to Bangor. Kent married a second time, to Abigail Ann Rockwood who was the niece of first wife Sarah Johnston, and had one more child, Edward Kent Jr., who became the chief justice of the Arizona Territory Supreme Court.

He died of congestive heart failure in 1877 in Bangor, Maine, and is buried at the Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

=== Legacy ===
Fort Kent, situated where the Fish River meets the Saint John River in the Saint John River Valley, was named in his honor. Later, the town of Fort Kent, Maine was named for the military installation (of which only a single blockhouse survives) and for Governor Kent.

<text>Tuvia Grossman () is an Israeli-American man who was erroneously identified as a Palestinian in the caption of a photograph that was published by the Associated Press (AP) during the Second Intifada. Taken on the eve of Rosh Hashanah in September 2000, the photograph shows an officer of the Israel Border Police defending Grossman at a gas station after the latter was surrounded, stabbed, and beaten by a Palestinian mob when his taxi driver attempted to take a shortcut through a Palestinian neighbourhood in Jerusalem. However, the AP&#x27;s caption identified Grossman as a Palestinian man at the Temple Mount, giving the impression that he had been brutalized by the Israeli police officer. It was marketed widely by the AP and featured in several Arab media and government outlets, in addition to mainstream American newspapers like &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;.

Following the publishing, Grossman&#x27;s father contacted &quot;The New York Times&quot; to correct his son&#x27;s identity and reveal the true context of incident that was occurring when the photograph was taken. An article was then published by the newspaper to explain that Grossman was actually a Jewish student, that the photograph was not taken at the Temple Mount, and that the Israeli police officer—later identified as Gidon Tzefadi (), a Druze from Kisra-Sumei—was ordering the attacking Palestinian mob to stay back.

The AP publishing of Grossman&#x27;s photograph highlights one of many contentious media incidents in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. It received severe backlash from a number of pro-Israel watchdogs and advocacy organizations.

==Second Intifada incident==
On the eve of Rosh Hashana in September 2000, Grossman, a Jewish student from Chicago who was enrolled at Yeshivas Bais Yisroel in the Israeli settlement of Neve Yaakov (a neighborhood of Jerusalem), hailed a taxi with two friends to visit the Western Wall. When the driver took a shortcut through the East Jerusalem Palestinian neighborhood of Wadi al-Joz, a mob of about 40 Palestinian Arabs surrounded the taxi, smashed the windows, and dragged Grossman out, whereupon they beat him. The mob kicked him repeatedly, stabbed him once in the leg, and then pounded his head with rocks. Grossman managed to run to a nearby gas station where he collapsed, and an Israeli policeman, wielding a club, protected him and threatened the mob. The photograph was taken at that time by a freelance photographer who was at the gas station; in the photo, Grossman is shown bleeding and crouched under the policeman who is shouting and waving his club.

=== News coverage ===
At the outset of the Second Intifada on 30 September 2000, the &quot;New York Times&quot; and other media outlets published an AP photo of a bloodied Grossman crouching beneath a club-wielding Israeli Border Police officer. The caption under the photo simply identified the two as an &quot;Israeli policeman and a Palestinian&quot;.

==== Corrections ====
The victim&#x27;s true identity was revealed when Dr. Aaron Grossman of Chicago, the father of Tuvia Grossman, sent the following letter to the &quot;New York Times&quot;:
Regarding your picture on page A5 of the Israeli soldier and the Palestinian on the Temple Mount -- that Palestinian is actually my son, Tuvia Grossman, a Jewish student from Chicago. He, and two of his friends, were pulled from their taxicab while traveling in Jerusalem, by a mob of Palestinian Arabs, and were severely beaten and stabbed.

That picture could not have been taken on the Temple Mount because there are no gas stations on the Temple Mount and certainly none with Hebrew lettering, like the one clearly seen behind the Israeli soldier attempting to protect my son from the mob.

In response, the &quot;New York Times&quot; published a correction on 4 October 2000, stating the following:

A picture caption on Saturday about fighting between Israelis and Palestinians in Jerusalem included an erroneous identification from The Associated Press for a wounded man shown with an Israeli policeman. He was Tuvia Grossman of Chicago, an American student in Israel, not an unidentified Palestinian. In some copies the caption also misidentified the site where Mr. Grossman was wounded. It was in Jerusalem&#x27;s Old City, but not on the Temple Mount.

In this correction, Tuvia Grossman is accurately identified as &quot;an American student in Israel,&quot; but it is not noted that he is Jewish and his beating is not described. The location is still misstated, this time as Jerusalem&#x27;s Old City, while the true location was the Palestinian Arab neighborhood of Wadi al-Joz.

Three days later, on 7 October 2000, the &quot;Times&quot; published another correction:

A picture caption on Page A6 last Saturday about fighting in Jerusalem gave an erroneous identification from The Associated Press for a wounded man shown with an Israeli policeman. He was Tuvia Grossman of Chicago, an American studying at a Jewish seminary in Jerusalem, not an unidentified Palestinian. In some copies the caption also included the news agency&#x27;s erroneous reference to the site. The incident occurred in an Arab neighborhood of Jerusalem, not on the Temple Mount or elsewhere in the Old City.

A correction in this space on Wednesday cited the errors incompletely and omitted an explanation of the scene. The officer was waving a nightstick at Palestinians, telling them to stay away from Mr. Grossman. He was not beating Mr. Grossman.

This note was accurate, and accompanied by an article which described the beating:

They looked out, as they recalled later, and saw a crowd of Palestinian youths blocking the road and closing in on them.

A stone crashed through the back window and Mr. Pollock&#x27;s head was gashed. Then all of the taxi&#x27;s windows were shattered in a volley of rocks, and the terrified Americans tried to huddle down and cover their faces. The doors were jerked open, they said, and they were dragged out by the mob and beaten.

The article further noted the following:

The officer [shown above Grossman in picture], wielding a club and moving toward him protectively, ordered the Palestinians to back off.

&quot;He recognized that Tuvia was Jewish and was being pursued, and he was yelling, &#x27;Back off! Back off!&#x27;&quot; Mr. Grossman&#x27;s aunt, Shelley Winkler, of Far Rockaway, Queens, said yesterday, having learned what happened from Mr. Grossman&#x27;s parents, Dr. Aaron and Tzirel Grossman, who went to Israel early in the week

==== Usage in Arab media and government outlets ====
Several organizations have used Grossman&#x27;s picture, falsely presenting him as a Palestinian. One of them was an Egyptian government website, along with a number of other Arab sites.

This same picture has been used to cause anger toward Coca-Cola by falsely identifying Grossman as a Palestinian.

=== Aftermath ===
In April 2002, a District Court in Paris ordered the French daily newspaper &quot;Libération&quot; and the Associated Press to pay 4,500 Euros to Grossman in damages for misrepresenting him.

Seth Ackerman of FAIR, a progressive left-leaning media watchdog, posited that the response of pro-Israel media critics was excessive, as &quot;no one alleged any deliberate falsification&quot; by AP, adding that &quot;the vast majority of injuries in Jerusalem the day the Grossman photograph was taken were sustained by Palestinians&quot;.

According to Ackerman, seven to eight U.S. newspapers picked up the photo along with the original erroneous caption. The Associated Press acknowledged the error and set about correcting it, along with almost all of the newspapers that printed the photograph. The &quot;New York Times&quot; published two retractions (one on 4 October 2000 and another three days later) as well as a 670-word news article tracing the incident from the time the photograph was taken to when it was published.
&quot;Newspapers across the country carried angry commentaries and letters by supporters of Israel brandishing the mislabeled photograph as palpable proof of their long-held suspicions. The &quot;New York Post&quot; (10/5/00) and &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; (10/6/00) each ran op-eds on the photo. In commentaries, the mislabeled photo was proof that pro-Palestinian &quot;misreporting by the media has been rampant&quot; (&quot;Albany Times-Union&quot;, 10/25/00), and that &quot;Anti-Israel Bias Warps American Minds&quot; (&quot;Providence Journal-Bulletin&quot;, 10/13/00). &quot;Daily Oklahoman&quot; columnist Edie Roodman (10/13/00) accused the media of &quot;&#x27;indirectly stimulating riots&#x27; by Palestinians.&quot; – Seth Ackerman, FAIR
==Later life==
In September 2005, Tuvia Grossman made &quot;aliyah&quot; (immigrated to Israel): &quot;I knew that I wanted to be here, in Israel,&quot; Grossman said as he prepared to leave his hometown of Chicago for his flight. &quot;Nothing was going to stop me.&quot; Grossman had studied law in his native Chicago. After immigrating to Israel, he did an internship at the Israeli Supreme Court, passed the Israeli bar, and became a lawyer. Grossman worked for a time as an energy and infrastructure lawyer at both Gornitzky &amp; Co. and Epstein Rosenblum Maoz (ERM) in Tel Aviv. Currently, he is the Director of Business Affairs at Tahal Water Energy Ltd.

=== Identity of the police officer ===
In 2010, ten years after the incident, Tuvia Grossman finally met the police officer who saved his life, learning that his name was Gidon Tzefadi. Tzefadi is an Israeli Druze and former Chief Superintendent of the Israeli East Jerusalem Border Police. The event was documented on the website HonestReporting.

<doc id="530284" wikidata="Q4582489" url="?curid=530284" title="Battle of Mount Tumbledown">
<text>Mount Tumbledown, Mount William, and Sapper Hill are located to the west of Port Stanley, the capital of the Falkland Islands. Due to their proximity to the capital, these positions held strategic importance during the 1982 Falklands War. On the night of 13–14 June, British forces launched an offensive against Mount Tumbledown and the surrounding high ground. The operation was successful, forcing the retreat of the Argentine force. This engagement, one of several night battles during the British advance toward Stanley, allowed British troops to secure a dominant position over the town, leading to the fall of Stanley and the surrender of Argentine forces on the islands.

British forces were the 2nd Battalion, Scots Guards, 42 Commandos Mortars and four light tanks of the Blues and Royals. The 7th Gurkha Rifles were in reserve with the task of capturing Mount William, allowing the Welsh Guards through to take Sapper Hill. The attack was supported by gunfire from HMS &quot;Active&quot;.

The Argentinian forces defending the mountains around Port Stanley were Commander Carlos Hugo Robacio&#x27;s 5th Marine Infantry Battalion (BIM 5), a reinforced, cold-weather-trained and equipped Marine battalion. Prior to the British landings, the Argentine Marines battalion had been brought up to brigade strength by a company of the Amphibious Engineers Company, a heavy machine-gun company of the Headquarters Battalion, a battery of the 1st Marine Field Artillery Battalion, three Tigercat SAM, Six Hispano-Suiz, HS-831 30mm AA batteries of the 1st Marine Anti-Aircraft Regiment, a 2nd and 3rd Marine Infantry Battalion platoon, military police and a canine platoon.

==Tumbledown defenders==
Captain Eduardo Villarraza&#x27;s N Company from the 5th Marine Battalion would defend Mounts Tumbledown and William
* 1st Platoon, Marine Second Lieutenant (&quot;Guardiamarina&quot;) Carlos Bianchi, was dug in on Mount William
* 2nd Platoon, Marine Second Lieutenant Marcelo Oruezabala, between Tumbledown and William
* 3rd Platoon, Marine Sergeant &quot;Suboficial&quot; or Chief Petty Officer Jorge Lucero, on the Northern slopes of Tumbledown, overlooking Moody Brook
* 4th Platoon, Sub-Lieutenant Carlos Daniel Vázquez, dug in near the summit, covering the Western approaches
* 5th Platoon, Lieutenant Héctor Omar Miño, behind the 4th Platoon, facing North in support of Lucero&#x27;s men
* Heavy machine guns and dogs from the Headquarters Battalion on Mount Tumbledown and Sapper Hill
* Tigercat SAM launchers and anti-tank guns, one on Mount William in support of Bianchi&#x27;s platoon and the other supporting Lucero&#x27;s.
* Marine SAM Platoon, with British Blowpipe and Russian SA-7 MPADS on Sapper Hill
* 60mm Mortar Platoon, in two sections near the summit, under Marine Sergeants David Ramos and Lucio Monzón

At the time of the battle, Marine Teniente de Navio Eduardo Villarraza&#x27;s N Company was stationed on Tumbledown, Mount William was occupied by O Company of the Marine battalion, commanded by Marine Captain Ricardo Quiroga. In reserve behind N Company was B Company of the 6th Army Regiment, under Major Oscar Ramón Jaimet, M Company, led by Marine Captain Rodolfo Oscar Cionchi, was stationed on Sapper Hill.

==Early moves==
On the morning of 13 June, the Scots Guards were moved by helicopter from their position at Bluff Cove to an assembly area near Goat Ridge, west of Mount Tumbledown. The British plan called for a diversionary attack south of Mount Tumbledown by a small number of the Scots Guards, assisted by the four light tanks of the Blues and Royals, while the main attack came as a three-phase silent advance from the west of Mount Tumbledown.

In the first phase, G company would take the western end of the mountain. In the second phase, Left Flank (company) would pass through the area taken by G company to capture the centre of the summit. In the third phase, Right Flank would pass through Left Flank to secure the eastern end of Tumbledown.

A daytime assault was initially planned but was postponed at the British battalion commander&#x27;s request. In a meeting with his company commanders, the consensus was that the long uphill assault across the harsh ground of Tumbledown would be suicidal in daylight.

The British &#x27;softening up&#x27; bombardment began at 7:30 local time, Major Jaimet later recalled:
I heard the cries of the wounded calling for their comrades, twelve men wounded before nightfall. We thought we had suffered before, but what luxury and comfort compared to this.
During the battle, the 5th Marines Command Post took five direct hits, but Commander Robacio emerged unscathed.

==Diversion==
At 8:30 p.m. on 13 June, the diversionary attack began. The 2nd Bn Scots Guards&#x27; Reconnaissance Platoon and Pipes &amp; Drums Platoon, commanded by Major Richard Bethell (a former SAS officer) and supported by four light tanks of the Blues and Royals clashed with the Argentine Marine O Company under Marine Captain Quiroga in a blocking position on the lower slopes of Mount William. On William&#x27;s southern slopes, a landmine detonation disabled one of the light tanks, causing minor injuries to its three-man crew. The tank was eventually repaired and returned to service as a &quot;Scorpoled&quot;, Sabre.

The initial advance was unopposed, but a heavy firefight broke out when British troops made contact with Argentinian defences. The Argentinians opened fire, killing two British soldiers and wounding four others. After two hours of hard fighting, the Argentinian company withdrew to its main defences on William and the British secured the position. Marine First Class Private José Luis Fazio fought against Bethell&#x27;s force:

At about 22:30 hours our battalion had its first intensive gun battle with British companies which appeared out of nowhere. I heard Private Roberto Barboza yell &quot;The English are here!&quot; ... I remember our Operations Officer requested the artillery to assist at 23.00 with star shells. The close quarter battle was such that the Argentine artillery was unable to drop shells on to the British attackers. I was shooting, doing my work. I don&#x27;t know if I killed anyone. We just fired our rifles, that&#x27;s all. Contact was maintained for over an hour before battalion headquarters ordered Obra Company to fall back ... What we did not realise at the time was that a wounded Marine made his way to the amphibious engineer platoon and threw a grenade, wounding a Major. Simultaneously, the Major opened fire, killing him.

After the successful diversion, the British force withdrew, carrying their wounded with them. During the withdrawal, two additional soldiers were injured by shellfire and four more after inadvertently entering a minefield. The explosions of the mines prompted Argentine Marine Major Antonio Pernías to instruct the 81 mm mortar platoon stationed on Mount William, as well as the longer-range 120mm mortar attached to &#x27;C&#x27; Company, 3rd Infantry Regiment on Sapper Hill, to open fire on both the minefield and the potential withdrawal route of any forces attacking Mount William. The barrage lasted approximately forty minutes. British casualties were slightly mitigated as the mortar shells predominantly landed on soft peat, which lessened the impact of the explosion. The diversion suffered a total of 2 killed, Lance Corporal Pashley of 9 Parachute Squadron and WO2 Danny Wight, with 16 more wounded.

==Night attack==
At 9 p.m., half an hour after the start of the diversionary attack, Major Iain Dalzel-Job&#x27;s G Company started its two-mile advance. Reaching its objective undetected, the company found the western end of the mountain undefended and occupied it easily, but later came under shellfire that wounded 10.

Major John Kiszely&#x27;s Left Flank passed through them and reached the central region of the peak unopposed, but then came under heavy fire.

The Argentinians, later learned to be of company strength, directed mortar, grenade, machine gun and small arms fire from close range at the British company, killing three British soldiers. Marine Sub-Lieutenant Héctor Mino&#x27;s 5th Platoon (1st Amphibious Engineer Company), held the rocks behind Sub-Lieutenant Carlos Vázquez&#x27;s 4th Platoon, N Company. In the centre of the 4th Marine Platoon position were the remnants of Second Lieutenants Óscar Silva&#x27;s and Marcelo Llambías-Pravaz&#x27;s RI 4 platoons as well as the remnants of Second Lieutenants Celestino Mosteirín&#x27;s and Marcelo Dorigón&#x27;s RI 12 platoons, which had recently fought on Two Sisters, Goat Ridge and Mount Harriet.

For between four and five hours, a contingent of Argentine defenders, including a composite force of Marine and Army personnel from six infantry platoons, engineers and a platoon of mortar operators, held their positions on Tumbledown, preventing the advance of British forces. To identify enemy bunkers, British Guardsmen fired Illuminating Parachute flares toward the summit. Both sides engaged in a sustained exchange of fire, with the Guardsmen deploying 66mm and 84mm anti-tank rounds, while the Argentine forces, firing from cover, retaliated using rifle grenades. Despite the assault, the Argentine defenders remained resolute, shouting obscenities in English and even singing the Marcha de las Malvinas.

Lieutenant Colonel Michael Scott, the commanding officer of the 2nd Battalion, Scots Guards, considered the possibility of withdrawing and launching another assault the following night. Reflecting on the situation, he later remarked,
The old nails were being bitten a bit, if we hadn&#x27;t held on to Tumbledown, it might have encouraged them to keep on fighting.
=== Left flank ===
The fighting was hard going for Left Flank, as Argentine forces were well prepared with entrenched machine guns and snipers. However, at 2:30 a.m., a renewed British assault succeeded in overwhelming the troops of the 4th and 12th Regiments. Despite this, the surviving members of Vazquez&#x27;s 4th Platoon continued to resist until approximately 7:00 a.m. British forces ultimately secured control of the mountaintop, inflicting casualties, capturing numerous defenders from the 4th and 12th Regiments, and, in some instances, engaging in close-quarters combat with fixed bayonets. Marine Private Jorge Sanchez recalled:

The fighting was sporadic, but at times fierce, as we tried to maintain our position. By this time we had ten or twelve dead, including one officer [Second Lieutenant Oscar Silva, Argentine Army]. I hadn&#x27;t fired directly at a British soldier, as they had been too hard to get a clear shot at. I can remember lying there with all this firing going over my head. They were everywhere. The platoon commander [Marine Sub-Lieutenant Carlos Daniel Vazquez] then called Private Ramon Rotela, manning a 60-millimetre mortar and Rotela fired it straight up into the air so that the bombs landed on ourselves. At this point I had been up and in actual combat for over six hours. It was snowing and we were tired. Some of the guys had surrendered, but I didn&#x27;t want to do this. I had only twenty rounds left and I decided to continue the fight from Mount William. I popped up, fired a rifle grenade in the direction of 8 to 10 British soldiers to keep their heads down, and then ran for the 2nd Platoon. I can remember saying some type of prayer hoping the British wouldn&#x27;t shoot me in the back.

Major Kiszely, who was to become a senior general after the war, was the first man into the Argentine position, shooting two Argentine conscripts and bayoneting a third. Seeing their company commander among the enemy inspired 14 and 15 Platoons to make the final dash across open ground to of the remaining Argentine Marines. Kiszely and six other Guardsmen suddenly found themselves standing on top of the mountain, looking down on Stanley, which was under street lighting and vehicles could be seen moving along the roads.

Argentine forces, consisting of Second Lieutenant Augusto La Madrid&#x27;s platoon from Major Jaimet&#x27;s B Company and Marine Lieutenant Héctor Miño&#x27;s amphibious engineer platoon reinforced by Marine Lieutenant Waldemar Aquino and Marine Second Lieutenant De Marco, launched a counterattack. During the assault, a burst of machine-gun fire from La Madrid’s unit wounded three Guardsmen, including Lieutenant Alasdair Mitchell, commander of 15 Platoon and a bullet struck the compass attached to the belt of Major Kiszely.

For his role in leading a bayonet charge during the engagement, Kiszely was awarded the Military Cross.

==Counterattack==
By 6 a.m., the advance of Left Flank had come to a halt, resulting in significant casualties among the Guards. On the eastern sector of the mountain, the conscript platoons of La Madrid and Miño were attempting to resume their assault. In response, Colonel Scott issued orders for Right Flank to advance and eliminate the remaining enemy positions. Second Lieutenant La Madrid later provided an account of the combat:

I went forward to make a reconnaissance and could see that the British had two machine guns and a missile launcher in action. I went through another gap in the rocks and was surprised by three men speaking in English behind and above me and firing over the top of me. I could see them with my night binoculars ... I took a rifle grenade and fired at where I had seen the first three men. I heard it explode and some shouts and cries of pain ... I ran back to my position and ordered my men to open fire. We stopped them, but they thinned out and came round our flanks ... They also engaged us with light mortars and missile launchers. This went on for a long time, and we suffered heavy casualties ... We started to run short of ammunition ... Also, I could see that we were outflanked, with the British behind us, so we were cut off from my company ... I reorganized and found that I was down to sixteen men. I started to retire ... I left six men in a line with a machine gun to cover our retreat, but really we were fighting all the time, we could not break contact. They came on us fast, and we fell back ... We eventually got through to Stanley through what I would like to say was a perfect barrage fired by the Royal Artillery. We had to wait for breaks in the firing, but I still lost a man killed there.

Major Simon Price sent 2 and 3 Platoons forward, preceded by a volley of 66mm rockets to clear the Argentine reinforcements. Major Price placed 1 Platoon high up in the rocks to provide fire support for the assault troops.

Lieutenant Robert Lawrence led 3 Platoon in a flanking manoeuvre to the right of the Argentinian positions, intending to catch the defenders off guard. However, the British troops were spotted and temporarily pinned down by enemy fire. Despite this, a bayonet charge was launched, successfully overrunning the Argentinian defenders. Lance-Corporal Graham Rennie of 3 Platoon later recounted the British assault:

Our assault was initiated by a Guardsman killing a sniper, which was followed by a volley of 66mm anti-tank rounds. We ran forward in extended line, machine gunners and riflemen firing from the hip to keep the enemy heads down, enabling us to cover the open ground in the shortest possible time. Halfway across the open ground, 2 Platoon went to ground to give covering fire support, enabling us to gain a foothold on the enemy position. From then on we fought from crag to crag, rock to rock, taking out pockets of enemy and lone riflemen, all of whom resisted fiercely.
Lieutenants La Madrid and Miño withdrew their respective platoons, sustaining five killed during the counterattack. In an effort to support them, the platoons under Second Lieutenants Aldo Franco and Guillermo Robredo advanced from the eastern edge of the mountain. As the British forces pressed forward from the central region of Tumbledown, they again encountered intense Argentine resistance. However, by advancing in pairs under covering fire, they successfully engaged and cleared the remaining Bravo Company platoons, ultimately securing control over the eastern sector of Mount Tumbledown.

Right Flank had secured its objective at the cost of five wounded, Left Flank sustained two dead and &quot;several&quot; injuries during the Argentine counterattack and when mortar fire from Mount William targeted British wounded and stretcher bearers.

At the moment of victory on the eastern slopes, Lawrence was nearly killed when a bullet, reportedly fired by an Argentine &quot;sniper,&quot; struck the side of his head. He was later awarded the Military Cross for bravery, though he endured a year in a wheelchair and the use of his left arm.

The Argentine was identified by Lieutenant La Madrid as Private Luis Jorge Bordón or Walter Ignacio Becerra armed with an Argentine standard FN FAL rifle, and providing covering fire for the Argentine retreat. He also fired on a Westland Scout helicopter evacuating casualties from Tumbledown, wounding two men, Guardsman Kenny Mains and Captain Swinton, the Forward Observation Officer (FOO) attached to the Gurkhas as they moved toward Mount William. He was eventually killed by the concentrated fire of several Guardsmen.

==Fall of Tumbledown==
By 9:00 a.m., the Scots Guards had secured the high ground to the east of Tumbledown Mountain, while the Gurkha units began advancing across the saddle extending southward from Tumbledown to Mount William. The Gurkhas successfully captured Mount William, sustaining eight wounded, primarily due to artillery fire.

During the engagement, the Scots Guards captured 30 prisoners, several of whom were from Bravo Company of Regiment of Infantry 6. Additionally, the bodies of 30 Argentine Army and Marine personnel were discovered in and around the defensive perimeter of the 5th Marine Battalion.

The 2nd Battalion, Scots Guards, suffered eight fatalities and 43 wounded. According to Sergeant Thomas MacGuinnes of 13 Platoon, who played a significant role in overcoming Argentine defenses, a further 20 to 30 Guardsmen from Left Flank Company remained immobile, having sustained concussions from Argentine artillery, mortars, and rifle-grenade fire, or after experiencing falls on the wet and rugged terrain during the prolonged engagement.

Additional casualties were recorded among other British units, The Royal Engineers and Welsh Guards each suffered one fatality, with a combined total of 13 wounded, including 8 Gurkhas and a Forward Observation Officer, Captain Keith Swinton.

Dhanbahadur Rai, a Gurkha soldier, provided an account of the battle:

The Scots Guards were assigned to attack Tumbledown, with the Gurkhas following in support. We were meant to complete the assault while they provided covering fire from Tumbledown. During the night, we advanced behind the Scots Guards, but at one point, our commanding officer ordered us to halt. The terrain resembled a valley, and after stopping, artillery bombardment commenced. The headquarters and A Company sustained twelve wounded. The following morning, as we resumed movement, our commanding officer, the MILAN anti-tank Platoon commander and Forward Observation Officer were advancing when they came under rifle fire. Our commanding officer shouted, &quot;Look, Goli Ayo!&quot; (&quot;Get down! Someone fired!&quot;). The FOO was standing and observing when a second shot struck him in the chest.

==Assault of Sapper Hill==

===Relevant deployments===
While the majority of the 5th Marine Battalion was stationed on Mounts Tumbledown and William, M Company was positioned along the slopes of Sapper Hill. Their deployment was reinforced by the 1st Marine Anti-Aircraft Battalion, as well as a contingent from the Marine Dog Platoon with five military working dogs: Ñaro, Nego, Vogel, Warner and Xuavia, their handlers and accompanying riflemen, all under the command of Sub-Lieutenant Miguel Paz.

Also present on Sapper Hill were 155 mm guns from the 101st Artillery Group, the 120mm Heavy Mortar Platoon from Captain Ramón Alberto Varela&#x27;s C Company, and the Reconnaissance Platoon (under Lieutenant Norman Osvaldo Reynoso) from the 3rd &quot;General Manuel Belgrano&quot; Mechanized Infantry Regiment. A mobile Westinghouse AN/TPS-43 long-range radar had been positioned on Sapper Hill since April.

On 1 May, a Royal Navy bombardment of Sapper Hill killed Private Daniel Cabiglioli (from M Company). The Westinghouse radar was damaged and would remain out of service for several days. That night, patrolling near Sapper Hill, a five-man squad (under Sergeant Miguel Angel Martinez) from the 3rd Regiment Recce Platoon discovered an abandoned rubber boat. The following day, the 1st Assault Section of the 601st Commando Company, led by First Lieutenant José Martiniano Duarte, checked the boat for explosives before transporting it to Port Stanley for examination.

In early June, Lieutenant Reynoso&#x27;s Recce Platoon exchanged small arms fire with a British patrol, most likely G Squadron SAS, who had commandeered a yacht at Bluff Cove Settlement to operate behind Tumbledown and sent men forward in a helicopter.

On 12 June, Harrier XW919 was hit by shrapnel, possibly from a Tigercat missile and damaged while dropping CBUs on an artillery position near Sapper Hill. During the recovery, the aircraft caught fire on &quot;Hermes&quot; flight deck, owing to a fractured reaction pipe. Argentine sources claim that the aircraft was hit by AAA immediately after an attack on a 155 mm howitzer, which was lightly damaged with six soldiers wounded. The Harrier was repaired and though still operational, was ultimately transferred to the School of Flight Deck Operations at Culdrose, and eventually donated to the Polish Aviation Museum, Kraków.

On 13 June, a Welsh Guards messenger (Lance Corporal Chris Thomas), bringing forward food supplies to Major Christopher Drewrywe&#x27;s Number 2 Company (1WG), was killed when his motorbike ran over a mine.

===Last Stand===
At dawn on 14 June, Major Phillip Neame&#x27;s D Company of 2 PARA, engaged in the final stages of the Battle of Wireless Ridge, reported observing a large concentration of Argentine forces regrouping on Sapper Hill. Argentine artillery units and a platoon from the 6th Regiment under Second Lieutenant La Madrid remained operational, engaging Neame&#x27;s company before incurring further casualties, including Privates Horacio Echave and Horacio Balvidares.

As Argentine forces repositioned on Sapper Hill, additional casualties were sustained due to a British bombardment and retaliatory fire from Wireless Ridge. Among those killed were Sergeant Víctor Hugo Juárez from the 5th Marine Battalion Headquarters, Private Vicente Antonio Díaz from the 1st Amphibious Engineers Company, and Private Ricardo Ramírez from the 81mm Mortar Platoon stationed on Mount William.

The Welsh Guards and Royal Marine Battalion were placed on standby to support the British offensives against Mounts Tumbledown and William. Their orders were to advance toward Sapper Hill only once these objectives had been secured. However, during their movement, they became entangled in a minefield, significantly delaying their progress. While attempting to extricate themselves, they came under heavy mortar fire from Argentine positions on Sapper Hill.

Major Drewrywe&#x27;s Welsh Guards eventually reached the base of Sapper Hill, only to find that the Argentine M Company remained in position. As a result, the Guardsmen were compelled to withdraw, using the morning fog as cover and this time successfully avoiding the minefield.

Due to these delays, it was decided that 45 Commando should advance from Two Sisters to seize Sapper Hill. As 45 Commando moved forward, Alpha and Charlie Companies of 40 Commando successfully evaded detection by Argentine defenders and were airlifted by helicopter. They landed on the slopes of Sapper Hill shortly before 45 Commando&#x27;s arrival, and together, both units launched an assault, ultimately securing the hill.

===Argentine Retreat===
Unwilling to abandon Tumbledown, Commander Carlos Robacio on Sapper Hill was planning to counterattack and drive back the Guardsmen. Only the personal intervention of Colonel Félix Aguiar, the 10th Brigade Chief of Staff, brought the fighting to an end in the Tumbledown sector. The 5th Marines worked their way back into Stanley, leaving the 2nd Platoon of Marine Second Lieutenant Marcelo Davis and 3rd Platoon of Marine Second Lieutenant Alejandro Koch of M Company to cover the retreat. The Argentine Marine companies withdrew safely, although pursued by artillery fire and hit by a laser-guided bomb dropped by Flight Lieutenant Mark Hare in XZ133 killing two of the Marine canines, &quot;Nego&quot; and &quot;Ñaro&quot;. Argentine Panhard armoured cars were moved forward to the edge of Stanley to cover the retreating Argentine Marines.

Marine Privates Roberto Leyes, Eleodoro Monzón and Sergio Ariel from M Company were killed protecting the Argentine retreat from Sapper Hill. Six Royal Marines were wounded by mines and small-arms fire securing Sapper Hill, including four Marines from 40 Commando, one Sapper from Condor Troop and a Forward Observation Officer (Major Brian Armitage) from 3 Commando Brigade HQs.

The Royal Marines, under Second Lieutenant Carl Bushby, defended their position in 9 Troop as Argentine Marines, commanded by Davis, launched a counterattack, the final assault of the ground campaign. Two British Sea Kings parked within range of Koch&#x27;s Marines were hit by machine-gun fire and rifle grenades from Sergeant Miguel Angel Vaca and Corporal Carlos Jorge Sini, both remained operational.

At the foot of the hill, there was an enormous minefield. Lieutenant Paul Allen and Marine Wayne McGregor of 7 Troop were both wounded activating anti-personnel mines. A group of Sappers from Condor Troop went ahead to clear a path through the mines, with Sergeant Peter Thorpe wounded in the process. Tanks of the Blues &amp; Royals moved forward to provide covering fire if required. During the helicopter evacuations of the wounded, Captain Sam Drennan of No. 656 Squadron would win the Distinguished Flying Cross for rescuing a wounded Gurkha and Guardsman from the middle of a minefield. However, when the Royal Marines and Welsh Guardsmen advanced, they found Sapper Hill abandoned. The delay caused by the mines probably saved many lives. The Argentine Marine companies had been deeply entrenched and were well equipped with heavy machine guns. To Guardsman Tracy Evens, the Sapper Hill positions looked impregnable:

We were led to an area that the company would rest at for the night, I still took in the fact that the Argies had prepared Sapper Hill well, they had depth positions that would have made the task of taking it very hard.

As the Guardsmen secured their positions, the British forces lost a Volvo Bv 202 tracked vehicle to a mine in the Sapper Hill sector.

We ran over a mine. I went up through the roof and the vehicle went up and was turned right round by the explosion, recalled Major Brian Armitage who was shortly evacuated to receive medical treatment.

==Military recognition==
For the courage displayed in the attack, men from 2 SG were awarded one Distinguished Service Order, two Military Crosses, two Distinguished Conduct Medals (one posthumously) and two Military Medals. Men from 9 Para Squadron, Royal Engineers, were awarded two Military Medals and Captain Sam Drennan, the Army Air Corps Scout pilot who had picked up the injured soldiers under fire and a former Scots Guards NCO, received the Distinguished Flying Cross.

Carlos Robacio, BIM5 commander, was awarded the Argentine Nation to the Valour in Combat Medal and the battalion itself was decorated by the Argentine Congress in 2002.

Due to his actions on both Two Sisters and Tumbledown, Private Oscar Ismael Poltronieri of La Madrid&#x27;s platoon was awarded the Argentine Nation to the Heroic Valour in Combat Cross, Argentina&#x27;s highest military decoration. He is the only conscript soldier in his nation&#x27;s recent history who has received this honour.

After the battle, Pipe Major James Riddell of 2 SG stood near the top of the mountain and played his bagpipes. He played a quick march he had composed &quot;on the back of a fag packet&quot; during the battle, following a long tradition in which Pipe Majors were encouraged &quot;to write tunes to commemorate any actions in which their regiments have been engaged&quot;. He named the tune &quot;The Crags of Tumbledown Mountain&quot;. It was released as a single by the Pipes and Drums of 2SG a year later.

<text>The Amber Spyglass is the third and final novel in the &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; trilogy by Philip Pullman. Published in 2000, it won the 2001 Whitbread Book of the Year award, the first children&#x27;s novel to do so. It was named Children&#x27;s Book of the Year at the 2001 British Book Awards, and was the first children&#x27;s book to be longlisted for the Booker Prize.

In 2022, the novel was adapted as the third series of the joint BBC-HBO television series &quot;His Dark Materials&quot;.

==Setting==
The novel is set in a number of worlds dominated by the Magisterium, a theocracy which actively suppresses heresy. In some of these worlds, humans&#x27; souls naturally exist outside of their bodies in the form of sentient &quot;dæmons&quot; in animal form. Important plot devices are the alethiometer, a truth-telling symbol reader; the subtle knife, capable of cutting windows between worlds; and the amber spyglass, a device for viewing the form of consciousness known as Dust.

==Plot==
Having learned of the witches&#x27; prophecy that Lyra Belacqua is the second Eve, the Magisterium decides she must be killed to prevent a new fall. Lyra&#x27;s ambitious and hardhearted mother, Mrs Coulter, hides her in a remote cave. In her drugged sleep, Lyra dreams of meeting her friend Roger in the land of the dead, and promises to help.

In the world of Cittàgazze the angels Balthamos and Baruch try to persuade Lyra&#x27;s friend Will to take the subtle knife to Lord Asriel, whose army is preparing to fight the Magisterium, but Will insists on finding Lyra first. They are attacked by the archangel Metatron but escape to another world just in time with the help of the subtle knife. The angels explain that the very first angel to condense out of Dust had falsely claimed to be the creator, and had acquired great power as the Authority. Now aged, he dwells in an isolated citadel and has delegated most of his powers to his regent Metatron.

The physicist Mary Malone finds herself in a world of sapient creatures called mulefa. The trees they rely on have been dying, and she uses lacquer from their sap to construct a spyglass that allows her to see Dust. She discovers that it is streaming rapidly away, no longer able to provide the trees with nourishment.

Will meets Iorek Byrnison. Together they find Lyra&#x27;s cave, arriving at the same time as the forces of the Magisterium. Will wakes Lyra and uses the knife to escape into another world, but when he loses concentration the knife breaks. Iorek uses his metalworking skills to repair it.

Lyra and Will travel to the world of the dead. Visitors are forced to leave their dæmons behind, causing Lyra and her dæmon Pantalaimon enormous pain. Will&#x27;s dæmon, previously internal, now becomes visible. After finding Roger, they persuade the harpies that control the world to allow them to open a window so the dead can leave. The dead step through and joyfully dissolve, their atoms becoming one with the universe.

Asriel&#x27;s army and the forces of the Magisterium join battle. Mrs Coulter, who has allied herself with Asriel, enters the Authority&#x27;s citadel, tempts Metatron, and then betrays him. Mrs Coulter, Asriel and Metatron fall into an abyss and are destroyed. Lyra and Will free the Authority from a crystal litter in which he is being carried, and find him demented and powerless – so feeble that mere exposure to the wind causes his form to dissolve.

Lyra and Will escape with their dæmons to the mulefa world, where Mary tells them of her own past. Before becoming a physicist she had been a nun, but had lost her faith when she had fallen in love and realised that the nun&#x27;s heaven was empty. Hearing her words, Lyra experiences new and strange sensations of her own. The next day, Lyra and Will set off to picnic in the wood. The couple kiss and confess their love for each other, and the Dust envelops them.

The witch Serafina Pekkala explains that each opened window between worlds creates a new spectre, and it is through those windows that Dust has been escaping. All existing windows must be closed, apart from the one leading from the world of the dead. Lyra and Will are devastated to learn that they must return to their respective worlds, as they cannot survive for long in any other. They promise each other that they will go to a bench in their respective Oxford Botanic Gardens every midsummer&#x27;s day to remember.

They return, and the witches set about closing the windows. Will deliberately destroys the subtle knife. In her own world, Lyra finds that she has lost the ability to intuitively read her alethiometer. She decides to take up the academic study of alethiometry and, together with Pantalaimon who has now taken the permanent form of a pine marten, she resolves to build the Republic of Heaven.

==Changes to US edition==
Pullman&#x27;s publishers have primarily marketed the &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; series to young adults, but Pullman also intended to speak to adults. &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot; is partly a re-evaluation of the Biblical tale of Adam and Eve. Pullman said Lyra&#x27;s sexual awakening &quot;is exactly what happens in the Garden of Eden … Why the Christian Church has spent 2,000 years condemning this glorious moment, well, that&#x27;s a mystery. I want to confront that, I suppose, by telling a story that this so-called original sin is anything but. It&#x27;s the thing that makes us fully human.&quot;

The North American edition alters passages describing Lyra&#x27;s incipient sexuality. The text in the UK edition includes this passage in the chapter &quot;Marzipan&quot;:

This is amended in the US edition to:

Other passages have also been modified in the US edition.

==Chapter headings==
Each chapter carried at the beginning a quotation from one of Pullman&#x27;s favourite authors, including Milton (&quot;Paradise Lost&quot;), William Blake and Emily Dickinson. Before &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; first came out the publisher had asked Pullman to produce his customary drawings for the head of each chapter, his drawings first appeared in the Lantern Slide editions of the books.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot; won critical acclaim and became the first children&#x27;s book to win the Whitbread Book of the Year. It was generally well-received among British press. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported on reviews from several publications with a rating scale for the novel out of &quot;Love It&quot;, &quot;Pretty Good&quot;, &quot;Ok&quot;, and &quot;Rubbish&quot;: &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Guardian&quot;, &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Observer&quot;, &quot;New Statesman&quot;, and &quot;Spectator&quot; reviews under &quot;Love It&quot; and &quot;Sunday Times&quot; review under &quot;Ok&quot; and &quot;Times&quot; review under &quot;Rubbish&quot;. The book was also generally well-received amongst American press. According to Book Marks, the book received &quot;rave&quot; reviews based on six critic reviews with three being &quot;rave&quot; and three being &quot;positive&quot;. Globally, Complete Review saying on the consensus &quot;Generally enthusiastic, some very much so&quot;. It also won the British Book Awards, Children&#x27;s book of the year, American Library Association Best Book for Young Adults, &quot;Parents&#x27; Choice&quot; Good Book Award, &quot;Horn Book&quot; Fanfare Honor Book, New York Public Library Book for the Teen Age and ABC Children&#x27;s Booksellers&#x27; Choice, and became a &quot;New York Times&quot; Bestseller.

Michael Dirda praised &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot; as &quot;an expertly paced and orchestrated novel.&quot; He notes Pullman&#x27;s allusiveness: &quot;In his acknowledgments Philip Pullman admits he has stolen material &#x27;from every book I have ever read.&#x27; Besides finding hints of &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; and Blake&#x27;s poetry, the astute will pick up echoes of the following: Christ&#x27;s harrowing of hell, Jewish Kabbalah (the legend of the godlike angel Metatron), Gnostic doctrine (Dust, our sleeping souls needing to be awakened), the &#x27;death of God&#x27; controversy, &quot;Perelandra&quot;, the Oz books (the Wheelers), Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ring of the Nibelungs&quot; (Siegfried&#x27;s mending of the sword), Aeneas, Odysseus and Dante in the Underworld, the Grail legend and the wounded Fisher King, Peter Pan, Wordsworth&#x27;s pantheistic &#x27;&#x27;, the doctrine of the hidden God and speculation about the plurality of worlds, situational ethics (actions, not people, being good or bad), the cessation of miracles, &quot;Star Wars&quot;...and even Pullman&#x27;s own early novel for adults, &quot;Galatea&quot;.&quot; He concludes by writing that &quot;&quot;His Dark Materials&quot; is a novel of electrifying power and splendor, deserving celebration, as violent as a fairy tale and as shocking as art must be.&quot;

In 2019, it was ranked sixth in &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s list of the 100 best books since 2000.

==TV adaptation==
The third series of the joint BBC-HBO television adaptation of &quot;His Dark Materials&quot;, released in December 2022, mainly covers &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot;.
==Audiobook==
An audiobook version narrated by Pullman and with a full cast was released in 2001.

<text>Henri Marteau (31 March 1874 – 3 October 1934) was a French violinist and composer.

==Life and career==

Marteau&#x27;s debut was made when he was 10 at a concert given by the Vienna Philharmonic Society conducted by Hans Richter. A tour through Switzerland and Germany followed. A year later Charles Gounod selected him to play the &quot;obbligato&quot; of &quot;Vision de Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot;, composed for the Joan of Arc Centenary Celebration at Reims, where he also performed, before an audience of 2500 people, his teacher Léonard&#x27;s Violin Concerto No. 5.

Marteau was an advocate of chamber music. On 13 April 1894, he, pianist Ami Lauchame, a violist named Koert, and a cellist named Hegner were reported to have given their second invitation chamber music concert in New York, performing works of Camille Saint-Saëns and Gabriel Fauré; a third concert was scheduled for the following week. By 1906, Marteau was leading a string quartet that broke up in a dispute over a work by Max Reger. In Berlin, he formed another string quartet with his student Licco Amar as second violinist and Hugo Becker as cellist; later, Becker&#x27;s student George Georgescu would take over the cello position.

Marteau died of pneumonia on his estate in Lichtenberg, Bavaria, at the age of 60.

<text>David Popper (June 18, 1843 – August 7, 1913) was a Bohemian cellist and composer.

==Life==
Popper was born in Prague, and studied music at the Prague Conservatory. His family was Jewish. He studied the cello under Julius Goltermann (1825–1876) and soon attracted attention. He made his first tour in 1863; in Germany he was praised by Hans von Bülow, son-in-law of Franz Liszt, who recommended him as Chamber Virtuoso in the court of Prince von Hohenzollern-Hechingen in Löwenberg. In 1864, he premiered Robert Volkmann&#x27;s Cello Concerto in A minor, Op. 33, with Hans von Bülow conducting the Berlin Philharmonic. He lost this job a couple of years later due to the prince&#x27;s death.

He made his debut in Vienna in 1867, and was made principal cellist at the Hofoper. From 1868 to 1870 he was also a member of the Hellmesberger Quartet. In 1872, he married pianist Sophie Menter, a pupil of Liszt who later joined the staff at the St. Petersburg Conservatory. In 1873, Popper resigned from his post at the Hofoper so as to continue his tours with his wife on a larger scale, giving concerts throughout Europe. Popper&#x27;s and Menter&#x27;s marriage was dissolved in 1886.

That year, Liszt recommended Popper for a teaching position at the newly opened string department at the Conservatory at Budapest. In Budapest, he participated in the Budapest Quartet with Jenő Hubay. He and Hubay performed chamber music on more than one occasion with Johannes Brahms, including the premiere of Brahms&#x27;s Piano Trio No. 3 in Budapest, on December 20, 1886.

Popper died in Baden, near Vienna.

Among his notable students were Arnold Földesy, Jenő Kerpely, Mici Lukács, Ludwig Lebell and Adolf Schiffer (teacher of János Starker).

David Popper was one of the last great cellists who did not use an endpin. An 1880 drawing of Popper playing in a string quartet shows that although he started his cello career without using an endpin, he adopted it later in his life. An old edition of the &quot;Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; described him thus: &quot;His tone is large and full of sentiment; his execution highly finished, and his style classical.&quot;

==Works==

Popper was a prolific composer of cello music, writing four concertos (or five, since Joseph Haydn&#x27;s fifth cello concerto is written by David Popper), a &quot;Requiem&quot; for three cellos and orchestra (1891) and a number of smaller pieces which are still played today, including the solo piece &quot;Tarantella&quot;. His shorter showpieces were written to highlight the unique sound and style of the cello, extending the instrument&#x27;s range with pieces such as &quot;Spinnlied&quot; (Spinning Song), &quot;Elfentanz&quot; (Dance of the Elves), or the &quot;Ungarische Rhapsodie&quot; (Hungarian Rhapsody), which was published by the Friedrich Hofmeister Musikverlag. He also wrote instructional pieces. Popper is also known for his High School of Cello Playing (Op. 73), a book of cello études that is widely used by advanced cello students.

<doc id="530290" wikidata="Q2261853" url="?curid=530290" title="Lyra's Oxford">
<text>Lyra&#x27;s Oxford is a 2003 novella by Philip Pullman depicting an episode involving the heroine of &quot;His Dark Materials&quot;, Pullman&#x27;s best-selling trilogy. &quot;Lyra&#x27;s Oxford&quot; is set when Lyra Belacqua is 15, two years after the end of the trilogy.

The book consists mainly of an illustrated short story, &quot;Lyra and the Birds&quot;. A fold-out map of &quot;Oxford by Train, River and Zeppelin&quot; is bound in the book, a fictional map of Oxford that exists in Lyra&#x27;s world. It also includes some advertisements for books and travellers&#x27; catalogues. Two pages from a &quot;Baedeker&quot; published in Lyra&#x27;s world (including entries for the Eagle Ironworks, the Oxford Canal, the Fell Press and the Oratory of St Barnabas the Chymist, all in the Jericho area of Lyra&#x27;s Oxford), a postcard from the character Mary Malone, and a brochure for the cruise ship &quot;Zenobia&quot; are also included. The postcard contains four images of sites in the &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; trilogy: the physics lab in which Mary Malone works, the house occupied by Lord Boreal, the row of hornbeam trees where Will first discovered a window between the worlds, and the bench where Lyra and Will have pledged to visit each other in spirit once a year.

The preface by Pullman begins:

==&quot;Lyra and the Birds&quot; plot summary==
Lyra is looking at a flock of birds from the tower of Jordan College in her Oxford, when she notices that the birds are attacking what turns out to be a dæmon in the shape of a fellow bird. This dæmon must be a witch&#x27;s because there is no human near. Lyra saves the dæmon, called Ragi, from the flock, and he urges Lyra to help him find a man called Sebastian Makepeace. Lyra cleverly figures out where to find him and that he is the last remaining alchemist, and promises Ragi to bring him to the alchemist after school. In the evening, Lyra escapes from St Sophia&#x27;s School and leads Ragi from outside Jordan College (Turl Street) to Juxon Street where Sebastian Makepeace lives. Ragi flies above Lyra and hides on roofs to avoid suspicion. On the way, Ragi is attacked by some pigeons, but manages to save himself. Ragi also tells Lyra why he needs Sebastian Makepeace&#x27;s help: his witch, Yelena Pazhets, is seriously ill. This new illness causes witches to die while not affecting their dæmons, leaving them alive and lonely after their witch&#x27;s death. Lyra is shocked by this.

Reaching Makepeace&#x27;s house at the end of Juxon Street, near the Oxford Canal, Lyra&#x27;s dæmon Pantalaimon manages to look through Makepeace&#x27;s window without being noticed by Ragi. Pan sees the alchemist lying on the floor and witch&#x27;s instruments nearby. Sensing something is wrong, Lyra continues walking, past Makepeace&#x27;s house, at which Ragi cries for his witch. Lyra realises it was a trap and now finds herself being attacked by the witch. She moves towards the canal and decides to fight the witch, because this is what Will would do.

When Yelena charges, a swan rushes past Lyra and attacks her. Yelena dies shortly after. Lyra carries the swan back to the canal, after which a recovered Sebastian Makepeace takes her into his house and explains that Yelena wanted to kill Lyra and blame him for the murder: Yelena was once Sebastian&#x27;s lover and their son died in the war that was waged in &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot;. Yelena blamed Lyra for her son&#x27;s death. The dead witch Yelena in the middle of the street caused some consternation; Sebastian helps Lyra to get away unnoticed. Lyra returns to St Sophia&#x27;s. Back home, Lyra and Pan contemplate the day&#x27;s events: the birds were actually helping her, and, looking for some meaning behind the events, Lyra feels that Oxford is protecting her.

<text>&#x27; (provisional designation &#x27;) is a kilometer-sized asteroid, classified as a near-Earth object, Mars-crosser and potentially hazardous asteroid of the Apollo group.

== Description ==

Three months after its discovery on 6 December 1997 by James V. Scotti of the University of Arizona&#x27;s Spacewatch Project, the asteroid was predicted to make an exceptionally close approach to Earth on 28 October 2028. Additional precovery observations of the asteroid from 1990 were quickly found that refined the orbit and it is now known the asteroid will pass Earth on 26 October 2028, at a distance of . During the close approach, the asteroid should peak at about apparent magnitude 8.2, and will be visible in binoculars.

 measures between 0.7 and 1.4 kilometers in diameter.

This asteroid also regularly comes near the large asteroid Pallas.

=== IAU Circular ===

On 11 March 1998, using a three-month observation arc, a faulty International Astronomical Union circular and press information sheet were put out that incorrectly concluded &quot;that the asteroid was &#x27;virtually certain&#x27; to pass within 80% of the distance to the Moon and stood a &#x27;small...not entirely out of the question&#x27; possibility of hitting the Earth in 2028.&quot; But by 23 December 1997, it was clear that XF11 had no reasonable possibility of an Earth impact. Many news outlets mistakenly emphasized the possibility of disaster.

Within hours of the announcement, independent calculations by Paul Chodas, Don Yeomans, and Karri Muinonen had calculated that the probability of Earth impact was essentially zero, and vastly less than the probability of impact from as-yet-undiscovered asteroids. Chodas (1999) concurs with Marsden (1999) that based on the 1997 data alone there was about 1 chance in a hundred thousand that XF11 could have been on an Earth-impact trajectory—that is, until the 1990 precovery observations eliminated such possibilities. During the October 2002 close approach, the asteroid was observed by the 70-meter Goldstone radar dish, further refining the orbit.

<text>Josef Gabriel Rheinberger (17 March 1839 – 25 November 1901) was an organist and composer from Liechtenstein, residing in Bavaria for most of his life. As court conductor in Munich, he was responsible for the music in the royal chapel. He is known for sacred music, works for organ and vocal works, such as masses, a Christmas cantata and the motet &quot;Abendlied&quot;; he also composed two operas and three singspiele, incidental music, secular choral music, two symphonies and other instrumental works, chamber music, and works for organ.

== Life and career ==
Rheinberger was born on 17 March 1839 in Vaduz as the son of Johann Peter Rheinberger and his mother Elisabeth Carigiet as one of eleven children, including his brother Peter Rheinberger.
When only seven years old, he was already serving as organist at the Vaduz parish church, and his first composition was performed the following year. In 1849, he studied with composer in Feldkirch, Vorarlberg.

In 1851, his father, who had initially opposed his son&#x27;s desire to embark on the life of a professional musician, relented and allowed him to enter the Munich Conservatorium. Not long after graduating, he became professor of piano and of composition at the same institution. When this first version of the Munich Conservatorium was dissolved, he was appointed &quot;répétiteur&quot; at the Court Theatre, from which he resigned in 1867.
Rheinberger married his former pupil, the poet and socialite in 1867. They had no children. Franziska wrote the texts for much of her husband&#x27;s vocal work.

The stylistic influences on Rheinberger ranged from contemporaries such as Brahms to composers from earlier times, such as Mendelssohn, Schumann, Schubert and, above all, Bach. He also painted for literature in English and German.

In 1877, he was appointed court conductor, responsible for the music in the royal chapel. He was subsequently awarded an honorary doctorate by Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. A distinguished teacher, he numbered many Americans among his pupils, including Horatio Parker, William Berwald, George Whitefield Chadwick, Bruno Klein, Sidney Homer and Henry Holden Huss. Other students of his included important figures from Europe: Italian composer Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari, Serbian composer Stevan Stojanovic Mokranjac, and German composers Engelbert Humperdinck and Richard Strauss and the conductor (and composer) Wilhelm Furtwängler. When the second (and present) Munich Conservatorium was founded, Rheinberger was appointed Royal Professor of organ and composition, a post he held for the rest of his life.

On 31 December 1892, after a long illness, his wife died and two years later poor health led him to give up the post of Court Music Director.

His religious works include twelve masses (one for double chorus, three for four voices &quot;a cappella&quot;, three for women&#x27;s voices and organ, two for men&#x27;s voices and one with orchestra), a Requiem and a Stabat Mater. His other works include several operas, symphonies, chamber music, and choral works.

Today Rheinberger is remembered above all for his elaborate and challenging organ compositions; these include two concertos, 20 sonatas in 20 different keys (of a projected set of 24 sonatas in all the keys), 22 trios, and 36 solo pieces. His organ sonatas were once declared to be

Rheinberger died in 1901 in Munich, and was buried in the Alter Südfriedhof. His grave was destroyed during World War II, and his remains as well as those of his wife were moved to his home town of Vaduz in 1950.

<text>The Aloha Tower is a retired lighthouse that is considered one of the landmarks of the state of Hawaii in the United States. Opened on September 11, 1926, at a cost of $160,000 ($2,805,206 in 2024), the Aloha Tower is located at Pier 9 of Honolulu Harbor. It has been, and continues to be, a guiding beacon welcoming vessels to the City and County of Honolulu. Just as the Statue of Liberty greeted hundreds of thousands of immigrants each year to New York City, the Aloha Tower greeted hundreds of thousands of immigrants to Honolulu. At 10 stories and 184 feet (56 m) of height topped with 40 feet (12 m) of flag mast, for four decades the Aloha Tower was the tallest structure in Hawaii. It was built in the Hawaiian Gothic architectural style.

==History==

===Attack on Pearl Harbor===

When the attack on Pearl Harbor came on December 7, 1941, Coast Guardsmen from the were ordered to take up defensive positions around Aloha Tower and protect it from being occupied. The Aloha Tower was painted in camouflage to disappear at night.

===Redevelopment===

In 1981, the Governor of Hawaii and the Hawaii State Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism established the Aloha Tower Development Corporation. The public corporation was charged with developing the land around the Aloha Tower to benefit the state&#x27;s commercial trade industry based at Honolulu Harbor while at the same time providing the residents of Hawaii with ample access to the downtown waterfront. The entire Aloha Tower Complex, as defined by the public corporation, was identified as Piers 5 and 6, Piers 8 through 23, and portions of Nimitz Highway and Iwilei.

===Museum marketplace===

In 1982, the Hawaii Maritime Center was opened near the Aloha Tower in an old royal pier to present the history of Honolulu Harbor and the relative industries it served. In 2002, the Hawaii Maritime Center became an incorporated institution of the Bishop Museum. The center was closed to the public on May 1, 2009 and was later converted into a Hawaii Pacific University dormitory in 2015.

Docked at the royal pier is the &quot;Falls of Clyde&quot;, a historic shipping vessel.

==Recent developments==
Aloha Towers adjacent Nimitz Highway has been thrown around with various proposals of projects to make it more efficient. In addition to this, proposals are being thrown around regarding redevelopment surrounding Aloha Tower.

===Highway tunnel proposal===
In 2004, a controversial proposal was made to construct an underground highway tunnel beneath the complex.

===Future Skyline service===

Proposals involving introducing rail transit near the Aloha Tower have been thrown around for years. Initially, this included the re-establishment of streetcars, but was changed to a Light Metro system once the Skyline Project was announced. This will result in the (Downtown) Skyline station being built near the Aloha Tower. As of 2024, this station is under construction and is expected to open in 2031.

===Proposed redevelopment of adjacent areas===
As part of the adjacent Skyline Station&#x27;s transit oriented development plan, the parking lot fronting the Aloha Tower and the adjacent decommissioned Hawaiian Electric power plant, would be demolished for various mixed-use developments. In addition to this, the surrounding commercial offices would be converted into residential mixed-use condos. In fact, the first conversion: the Modea condo is already expected to be completed in 2025.

===Hawaii Pacific University===
in 2015, the Hawaii Pacific University has taken over the former Aloha Tower Marketplace and converted the facility into a expansion of its campus, including 78 student housing units for 278 students.

===Security concerns following September 11, 2001 attacks===

In consideration of heightened security measures after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, public access to the observation deck was restricted, but has since been reopened.

==Concerts==

American hard rock band Skid Row performed in concert at Aloha Tower Stage on October 10, 1992.

<text>Karl Wilhelm Julius Hugo Riemann (18 July 1849 – 10 July 1919) was a German musicologist and composer who was among the founders of modern musicology. The leading European music scholar of his time, he was active and influential as both a music theorist and music historian. Many of his contributions are now termed as Riemannian theory, a variety of related ideas on many aspects of music theory.

==Biography==
Riemann was born at Grossmehlra, Schwarzburg-Sondershausen.

His first musical training came from his father Robert Riemann, a land owner, bailiff and, to judge from locally surviving listings of his songs and choral works, an active music enthusiast. Hugo Riemann was educated by Heinrich Frankenberger, the Sondershausen Choir Master, in Music theory. He was taught the piano by August Barthel and Theodor Ratzenberger (who had once studied under Liszt). He graduated from the gymnasiums at Sondershausen and Arnstadt.

Riemann studied law and finally philosophy and history at Berlin and Tübingen. After participating in the Franco-Prussian War he decided to devote his life to music, and studied accordingly at the Leipzig Conservatory. He then went to Bielefeld for some years as a teacher and conductor, but in 1878 returned to Leipzig as a visiting professor (&quot;Privatdozent&quot;) at the University.

As a much-desired appointment at the Conservatory did not materialize, Riemann went to Bromberg in 1880, but 1881–90 he was a teacher of piano and theory at Hamburg Conservatory. After a short time at the Sondershausen Conservatory, he held a post in the conservatory at Wiesbaden (1890–95). He eventually returned to Leipzig University as lecturer in 1895. In 1901, he was appointed professor, and in 1914 he was made Director of the Institute of Musicology.

Eight days before he would have turned 70, he died of jaundice.

==Writings==
Riemann is one of the most influential music theorists. In his publications and lectures he coined various terms which are still in everyday use, such as the harmonic function theory (therein popular terms such as the &quot;tonic&quot;, the &quot;dominant&quot;, the &quot;subdominant&quot; and the &quot;parallel&quot;). In addition, the term and theory of the metric and rhythmic phrase, a basic element of today&#x27;s music education, originate in Riemann.

Among his best-known works are the &quot;Musik-Lexikon&quot; (1882; 5th ed. 1899; Eng. trans., 1893–96), a complete dictionary of music and musicians, the &quot;Geschichte der musiktheorie im IX.-XIX. jahrhundert&quot;(1898), a history of music theory in Europe through the 19th century, the &quot;Handbuch der Harmonielehre&quot;, a work on the study of harmony, and the &quot;Lehrbuch des Contrapunkts&quot;, a similar work on counterpoint, all of which have been translated into English.

The &quot;Geschichte&quot; was widely used among lecturers of music for around half a century after it was written. In his book, he meticulously documented the development of polyphonic theory from the ancient times to the 16th century. With this, he concluded that common intervals heard in polyphonic music were used intuitively in folk practices due to the ostensibly &quot;natural&quot; element of these intervals. As he developed as a theorist, he focused more and more on human nature, using psychology as the basis of his ideas.
His philosophical background exposed him to Pitagorean musical philosophy, which states that the natural harmony of the macrocosmos, or the world outside, is reflected in the microcosmos, or the world inside. The feelings generated by sounds and chords are just an intuitive rediscovery of a reality, a mathematical harmony, that is already there in the human being.
Thus, what humans feel when hearing music is alike the acoustical phenomenon of sympathetic resonance.

He was an advocate of harmonic dualism, and his theory of harmonic function is the foundation of harmonic theory as it is still taught in Germany. He also elaborated a set of harmonic transformations that was adapted by the American theorist David Lewin, and eventually evolved into a significant strain of neo-Riemannian theory. Another pillar of modern neo-Riemannian theory, the Tonnetz, was not Riemann&#x27;s own invention, but he played an important role in popularizing and disseminating it.

He authored many works on many different branches of music. His pupils included the German composer, pianist, organist, and conductor Max Reger and the musicologist and composer Walter Niemann.

==Compositions==
He wrote many pieces for piano, songs, a piano sonata, six sonatinas, a violin sonata, and a string quartet.

<text>The , often abbreviated to , was a left-leaning union confederation. Founded in 1950, it was the largest labor federation in Japan for several decades.

==Origins==

In the immediate aftermath of Japan&#x27;s defeat in World War II, the United States-led Allied Occupation of Japan issued directives legalizing labor unions, which were then protected by the new Constitution of Japan promulgated in 1947. In the early postwar years, numerous labor unions formed in industries throughout Japan, many of which were under the influence of the Japan Communist Party. However, in 1950, following the advent of the global Cold War, and taking advantage of the sense of crisis precipitated by the sudden outbreak of the Korean War, conservative Japanese government and business leaders launched, with the tacit approval of US Occupation authorities, a &quot;Red Purge&quot; to remove communists and suspected communists from government and private-sector jobs. As part of the purge, Japanese conservatives fomented &quot;democracy cells&quot; within the established, Communist Party-dominated labor unions. As these unions collapsed amid the purge, the cells emerged and joined with some affiliates of the Japanese Federation of Labour to form a new labor federation, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, or Sōhyō.

==Early militancy==

Conservatives hoped that the new federation would be more moderate than the federations controlled by the Communist Party, which had been extremely militant. However, Sōhyō rapidly fell under the sway of the Japan Socialist Party and took the lead in organizing an escalating series of increasingly large and contentious labor actions over the course of the 1950s, and increasingly became involved in political protests as well.

On May 1, 1952, Sōhyō spearheaded a nationwide day of protest against the perceived one-sided nature of the Peace Treaty ending the Occupation of Japan. Although most of these activities were peaceful, a violent clash between protesters and police outside the Imperial Palace in Tokyo led to several deaths and injuries and became remembered as &quot;Bloody May Day.&quot;

Over the rest of the 1950s, Sōhyō became actively involved in a number of political and social movements, including movements to ban nuclear weapons and against US military bases in Japan. It also led a large number of strikes for higher wages across many different industries. Sōhyō&#x27;s period of militancy culminated in 1960 when it took a leading role in the massive Anpo protests against revision of the US Japan Security Treaty, as well as the large-scale strike at the Miike Coal Mine in northern Kyushu. As part of the anti-Security Treaty Struggle, Sōhyō organized a nationwide general strike that involved 6.4 million workers and remains the largest recorded strike in Japanese history. However, both these efforts ended in disastrous defeats, and thereafter Sōhyō increasingly retreated from contentious strikes in favor of more moderate workplace actions.

==Merger to form Rengo==

A large portion of Sōhyō merged with the more conservative Japanese Confederation of Labor (Domei) and other unions to form Rengo in 1987. Rengo was formally launched in 1989. Some elements of Sōhyō instead joined one of two new federations: the National Confederation of Trade Unions (Zenroren), and the National Trade Union Council (Zenrokyo).

<doc id="530307" wikidata="Q438424" url="?curid=530307" title="Marcello Gandini">
<text>Marcello Gandini (26 August 1938 – 13 March 2024) was an Italian car designer widely known for his work with the Italian car design house Bertone, where his work included designing the Alfa Romeo Carabo and Montreal, Lancia Stratos Zero, Maserati Khamsin, Ferrari GT4, Fiat X1/9, and several Lamborghinis, including the Bravo, Miura, Marzal, Espada, Urraco, and Countach. Gandini himself said his design interests prioritised vehicle architecture, construction, assembly, and mechanisms over styling.

&quot;Car Design News&quot; awarded Gandini the magazine&#x27;s first Lifetime Achievement Award in 2012, and said his stature within the industry could not be overstated. Flavio Manzoni, chief design officer at Ferrari, said Gandini was &quot;probably the greatest car designer ever&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Gandini was born in Turin on 26 August 1938 into a &quot;family steeped in classical music&quot;. His father was a former orchestral conductor and composer and wanted his son to become a pianist. Gandini, however, developed an early and intense interest in cars and mechanical engineering. He was sent to a classical lyceum and studied the piano, but continued to have &quot;a passion for engines, mechanics and technology&quot; and left school at 18, which resulted in his being rejected by his parents. 

== Career ==
In 1964, Gandini approached Nuccio Bertone, head of the Gruppo Bertone company, who was impressed by his zeal and wanted to apprentice him to Giorgetto Giugiaro, his chief designer. The following year Giorgetto left to start his own studio, and at the age of 27, Gandini was hired to take his place. He designed the Lamborghini Miura, from first sketch to finished prototype, in three months, and remained with the company for fourteen years.Gandini created the &quot;″Stile Bertone&quot;&#x27; styling house in Caprie. Turin, working as its general manager as well as designing concept cars, and managing the construction of prototype automobiles for the many car makers who hired Bertone, often specifically Gandini.

Gandini is most known for his designs for many Lamborghini sports cars, beginning with the groundbreaking rear mid-engined Lamborghini Miura in the mid-1960s with a transversely mounted V12. He went on to design the Espada, Urraco, Countach, and the original design proposal for the Diablo, as well as a number of Lamborghini concept cars.Gandini also designed practical mass-production cars, including sub-compacts, such as the Innocenti Mini and the first generation Volkswagen Polo, as well as midsize family cars, such as the first-generation BMW 5 Series and Citroën BX. The Lancia Stratos rally sportscar, featuring a seamless semi-elliptic windshield and door glass combination, is also a Gandini design.

Gandini left Bertone in July 1979 to found his own design house, Clama, pursuing freelance automotive, industrial, and interior design. Gandini worked exclusively for Renault for the first five years, resulting in the second generation Renault 5 (the&quot; &#x27;Supercinq&quot;&#x27;) and the Renault Magnum truck. He later worked with Maserati, Nissan, Toyota, and Subaru, and returned to Lamborghini to work on the Diablo in the 1990s.

Gandini also designed in other areas, including home architecture, the design of a nightclub interior, and the body styling of the Heli-Sport CH-7 helicopter.

In January 2024, Gandini was recognised by the Polytechnic University of Turin with an honorary degree in mechanical engineering.

Gandini died on 13 March 2024, at the age of 85.

<text>Northamptonshire County Cricket Club is one of eighteen first-class county clubs within the domestic cricket structure of England and Wales. It represents the historic county of Northamptonshire. Its limited overs team is called the Northants Steelbacks – a reference to the Northamptonshire Regiment which was formed in 1881. The name was supposedly a tribute to the soldiers&#x27; apparent indifference to the harsh discipline imposed by their officers. Founded in 1878, Northamptonshire (Northants) held minor status at first but was a prominent member of the early Minor Counties Championship during the 1890s. In 1905, the club joined the County Championship and was elevated to first-class status, since when the team have played in every top-level domestic cricket competition in England.

The club plays the majority of its games at the County Cricket Ground, Northampton, but has used outlier grounds at Kettering, Wellingborough, Rushden and Peterborough (historically part of Northamptonshire, but currently governed with Cambridgeshire) in the past. It has also used grounds outside the county for one-day games: for example, at Luton, Tring and Milton Keynes.

During the 2022 season, Northamptonshire played in Division One of the County Championship. They also played in the North Division of the Royal London One-Day Cup and the North Division of the T20 Blast.

==History==
===Earliest cricket===
Cricket had probably reached Northamptonshire by the end of the 17th century and the first two references to cricket in the county are within a few days of each other in 1741. On Monday 10 August, there was a match at Woburn Park between a Bedfordshire XI and a combined Northants and Huntingdonshire XI. Woburn Cricket Club under the leadership of the Duke of Bedford was on the point of becoming a well known club. On Tuesday 18 August, a match played on the Cow Meadow near Northampton between two teams of amateurs from Northamptonshire and Buckinghamshire is the earliest known instance of cricket being played in Northamptonshire county.

===Origin of club===
On 31 July 1878, the official formation of Northants CCC took place at a meeting in the George Hotel, Kettering based on an existing organisation that dated back to 1820. The 1820 date, if it could be verified, would make Northants the oldest club in the present-day County Championship. The club came to prominence in the Minor Counties Championship during the 1890s as, between 1900 and 1904, the bowling of George Thompson and William East was much too good for almost all batsmen at that level. The county applied for first-class status in 1904 and was promoted the following year when it joined the County Championship. They played its inaugural first-class match &quot;versus&quot; Hampshire CCC at Southampton on 18, 19 &amp; 20 May 1905 when making its County Championship debut.

===Stepping up to first-class===
Although Thompson and East proved themselves to be bowlers of high class, a weak batting line-up meant that the team remained close to the bottom of the championship table until Sydney Smith arrived in 1909. After three years in the middle of the table, Northants surprisingly improved to finish second in 1912 and fourth in 1913. Thompson, Smith and William &quot;Bumper&quot; Wells formed one of the strongest attacks in county cricket at the time, whilst Smith and Haywood were the county&#x27;s best batsmen.

Thompson and Smith finished playing after World War I and, during the inter-war period, Northamptonshire were regularly one of the weaker championship sides. This was exacerbated when Vallance Jupp declined due to age and, despite the arrival of Nobby Clark, a young left arm fast bowler from Huntingdonshire who burst onto the scene at the age of 20 in 1922 with 20 wickets at an average of 17.10 and Fred Bakewell, an exciting batsman who regularly exceeded 1000 runs a season, Northamptonshire could only finish above second from last four times between 1923 and 1948, finishing last every year from 1934 to 1938 and enduring a run of 99 matches from 14 May 1935 to 29 May 1939 without a single championship victory, a record that has never been beaten and doesn&#x27;t look like being beaten in the future. Things got worse for Northamptonshire during this time when Bakewell&#x27;s career ended due to a broken arm in a car crash that also resulted in the fatality of teammate, Reginald Northway.

===The post-war recovery===
After the Second World War, things could only get better for Northamptonshire and they started by recruiting widely from other counties and countries, bringing in Freddie Brown from Surrey; the Australians Jock Livingston, George Tribe and Jack Manning; the New Zealander Peter Arnold; and the Cambridge University opening bat and leg-spinner Raman Subba Row. Brown joined as captain in 1949, and led the team to six place in his first season after previous years of disappointment. Under the new leadership of Dennis Brookes (a stalwart batsman for over 20 years), finished second in 1957, their best finish for 45 years. This was mainly due to the bowling attack of Frank Tyson, Vincent Broderick, Michael Allen, George Tribe and Manning. Northamptonshire were widely considered the best team in England in the late 1950s and early 1960s, during this time Keith Andrew, Northants best ever Wicket-keeper broke the records of most victims in an innings and a season.
Subsequently, the club has seen mixed fortunes. The club has had intermittent success in one-day competitions, but it has still not won the County Championship, although second place was achieved in each of 1957, 1965 and 1976. Nonetheless, it has included several famous players qualified for England, including the South African-born batsman Allan Lamb; fast bowler David Larter; the hard hitting opener Colin Milburn, whose career was cut tragically short by an eye injury sustained in a car crash; the reliable batsmen David Steele and Rob Bailey; opening batsman Wayne Larkins; and all-rounders Peter Willey and David Capel.

Several notable overseas players such as Matthew Hayden, Curtly Ambrose, André Nel, Kapil Dev, Mike Hussey, Sarfraz Nawaz, Mushtaq Mohammad, Anil Kumble, Dennis Lillee and Bishen Bedi have starred for the club, which was particularly formidable as a one-day batting outfit in the late 1970s and early 1980s. More recently, Lance Klusener and Monty Panesar have been notable players.

Northants have recently been criticised for the number of Kolpak players in the team, but for the 2009 season there were only three in Andrew Hall, Johan van der Wath and Nicky Boje, and only one in 2013 in Hall.

===White ball success===

Northamptonshire have played in the domestic T20 Blast competition since its inaugural season in 2003. They play as the Northants Steeelbacks, taking their nickname from the Northamptonshire Regiment.

Under the captaincy of Alex Wakely they first won the competition in 2013, defeating Surrey by 102 runs (D/L). This was the first white ball trophy won by the county since 1992. After finishing runners up to Lancashire in the 2015 edition, the Steelbacks once again won the competition in 2016, defeating Durham by 4 wickets.

==Ground history==

As with all county cricket clubs, Northamptonshire CCC represents the historic county and not any modern or current administrative unit. In Northamptonshire&#x27;s case, this means the county of Northamptonshire and the Town of Northampton, although the club have in the past played some home matches outside the historic borders such as in Luton and Milton Keynes.

Northamptonshire first played at the county ground in Northampton in 1905, and continue to do so till this day even though Northampton Town F.C. shared the ground up until 1994 when &quot;the Cobblers&quot; moved to Sixfields Stadium. After the football club moved, the ground at the Abington Avenue was demolished and replaced by a new indoor school which includes seating looking on to the ground. In 2009, Northants cricket announced plans to improve the ground by building two new stands on the scoreboard side of the ground, there will also be a permanent commentary box with a view to have a &#x27;mini Lord&#x27;s&#x27; style media centre.

<text>Osteospermum , is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Calenduleae, one of the smaller tribes of the sunflower/daisy family Asteraceae. They are known as the daisybushes or African daisies. Its species have been given several common names, including African daisy, South African daisy, Cape daisy and blue-eyed daisy.

In horticulture, several widely cultivated species continue to be sold, grown and referred to as &quot;Osteospermum&quot;, however some of these species have been scientifically reclassified as being members of the genus &quot;Dimorphotheca&quot;, including &quot;Dimorphotheca barberae&quot; (synonym &quot;Osteospermum barberae);&quot; &quot;Dimorphotheca ecklonis (synonym Osteospermum ecklonis),&quot; &quot;Dimorphotheca fruticosa (synonym Osteospermum fruticosum);&quot; &quot;and Dimorphotheca jucunda (synonym Osteospermum jucundum).&quot;

==Description==
Their alternate (rarely opposite) leaves are green, but some variegated forms exist. The leaf form is lanceolate. The leaf margin is entire, but hardy types are toothed.

The daisy-like composite flower consists of disc florets and ray florets, growing singly at the end of branches or sometimes in inflorescences of terminal corymbose cymes. The disc florets are pseudo-bisexual and come in several colors such as blue, yellow and purple. The hardy types usually show a dark blue center in the disc until the yellow pollen is shed. The ray florets are female and are found diverse colors such as white, cream, pink, purple, mauve to yellow. Some cultivars have &quot;spooned&quot; petals such as &quot;Pink Whirls&quot;. Many species flower a second time late summer, stimulated by the cooler night temperatures. Hardy types show profuse flowering in the spring, but they do not get a second flush of flowers.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Osteospermum&quot; was named by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. The scientific name is derived from the Greek &quot;osteon&quot; (bone) and Latin &quot;spermum&quot; (seed). Plants of the World Online and the South African National Biodiversity Institute accept a broad definition of the genus, which is a sister taxon to &quot;Dimorphotheca&quot;. Other authorities treat its generic synonyms (&quot;Chrysanthemoides&quot;, &quot;Oligocarpus&quot;, etc.) as separate genera.

==Distribution==
There are about 70 species native to southern and eastern Africa and the Arabian peninsula.

==Cultivation==
&quot;Osteospermum&quot; are popular in cultivation, where they are frequently used in summer bedding schemes in parks and gardens. Numerous hybrids and cultivars have been grown with a wide range of tropical colors. Yellow cultivars tend to have a yellow center (sometimes off-white).

Plants prefer a warm and sunny position and rich soil, although they tolerate poor soil, salt or drought well. Modern cultivars flower continuously when watered and fertilised well, and dead-heading is not necessary, because they do not set seed easily. 
If planted in a container, soil should be prevented from drying out completely. If they do, the plants will go into &quot;sleep mode&quot; and survive the period of drought, but they will abort their flower buds and not easily come back into flower. Moreover, roots are relatively susceptible to rotting if watered too profusely after the dry period.

===Cultivars===
Most widely sold cultivars are grown as annuals, are mainly hybrids of &quot;O. jucundum&quot;, &quot;O. ecklonis&quot; and &quot;O. grandiflorum&quot; and can be hardy to -2 °C (30 °F). If hardy, they can be grown as perennials or as shrubs.

<text>The University of Bamberg () in Bamberg, Germany, specializes in the humanities, cultural studies, social sciences, economics, and applied computer science.

== Campus ==
The university is partly housed in historical buildings in Bamberg&#x27;s Old Town. These include the former Jesuit college (Theology), the former Hochzeitshaus (History), the old slaughterhouse (Earth Science), and the former fire station (Oriental Studies). The departments of Languages and Literature are partly housed in buildings which once belonged to the Kaiser-Heinrich High School.
The Social Sciences and Economics department, which accommodates a large proportion of the students, are in Feldkirchenstrasse. The former ERBA cotton mill, on an island in the Regnitz, has been acquired to create student apartments in the red-brick building, as well as in an adjoining new 14,000m2 building.

== Organization ==

The university today has four faculties:
*Faculty of Humanities
