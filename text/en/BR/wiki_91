<text>Pharnaces II of Pontus (; about 97–47 BC) was the king of the Bosporan Kingdom and Kingdom of Pontus until his death. He was a monarch of Persian and Greek ancestry. He was the youngest child born to King Mithridates VI of Pontus from his first wife, his sister Queen Laodice. He was born and raised in the Kingdom of Pontus and was the namesake of his late double great grandfather Pharnaces I of Pontus. After his father was defeated by the Romans in the Third Mithridatic War (73–63 BC) and died in 63 BC, the Romans annexed the western part of Pontus, merged it with the former Kingdom of Bithynia and formed the Roman province of Bithynia and Pontus. The eastern part of Pontus remained under the rule of Pharnaces as a client kingdom until his death.

==Rebellion against his father==
Pharnaces II was raised as his father&#x27;s successor and treated with distinction. However, little is known of his youth from ancient writers and find him first mentioned after Mithridates VI was defeated by the Roman general Pompey during the Third Mithridatic War. Cassius Dio and Florus wrote that Mithridates planned to attack Italy by crossing Scythia and the River Danube, according to the former, or through Thrace, Macedonia and the rest of Greece, according to the latter. Appian also wrote about a planned invasion of Italy, but did not mention any routes. The scale of the expedition put many of his soldiers off. Castor of Phanagoria and his city rebelled. Many of the castles he had occupied on the eastern shores of the Black sea also rebelled. This was followed by a rebellion by Pharnaces. 
Appian wrote that Pharnaces conspired against his father. The conspirators were captured and tortured. However, Mithridates was persuaded to spare Pharnaces. The latter feared his father&#x27;s anger and knew that Mithridates’ soldiers were not keen on the expedition. He went to Roman deserters who were encamped near Mithridates to highlight the dangers of the expedition and to encourage them to desert his father. He sent other people to do the same in other camps. In the morning there was an uprising. Mithridates fled and Pharnaces was proclaimed king by the troops. Mithridates sent messengers to ask his son for permission to withdraw safely. When they did not return, he tried to poison himself. However, it did not have an effect on him because he was used to taking small portions of poison as a protection against poisoners. Thus, he got an officer to kill him. Pharnaces sent his body to Pompey together with an emissary who offered submission and hostages. Pharnaces asked to be allowed to rule his father&#x27;s kingdom or the Cimmerian Bosporus. Pompey named him a friend and ally of the Romans. He gave him the Cimmerian Bosporus except for Phanagoria, which was to be independent as a reward for having been the first to rebel against Mithridates.

Cassius Dio also gave an account of the rebellion of Pharnaces. He wrote that as Mithridates&#x27; position became weaker, some of his associates became disaffected and some of the soldiers mutinied. Mithridates suppressed this before it caused troubles and punished some people, including some of his sons, just of the basis of suspicions. Pharnaces was afraid of his father and plotted against him. He also hoped to receive his kingdom from the Romans if he defected. Mithridates sent some guards to arrest him, but he won them over. He then marched against his father who was in Panticapaeum. Mithridates sent some soldiers ahead to confront him, but these were also won over. Panticapaeum surrendered to Pharnaces and he had his father put to death. Mithridates took some poison, but this did not kill him as he was used to take large doses of poison as an antidote. He was weakened and did not manage to take his life. He died fighting some men who had reached him. Pharnaces had his body embalmed and sent it to Pompey as proof that he had killed him. He also offered him his surrender. Pompey granted Pharnaces the kingdom of Bosporus and ‘enrolled him as a friend and ally’ of Rome.

In contrast with Appian and Cassius Dio, Festus wrote that &quot;Pompey imposed a king, Aristarchus, on the [Cimmerian] Bosphorians and Colchians.&quot;

Appian wrote that Pharnaces besieged Phanagoria and the towns neighboring the Bosporus. Short of food, the Phanagoreans had to come out and fight. They were defeated. Pharnaces did not harm them. He made friends with them, took hostages, and left. According to Appian, this was not long before he made his attacks in Anatolia.

== Invasions in Anatolia and defeat of Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus ==
In 49 BC, a civil war (Caesar&#x27;s Civil War) broke out between Gaius Julius Caesar and the Roman senate whose forces were led by Pompey. Caesar defeated Pompey in Greece in 47 BC, went to Egypt and was besieged in Alexandria of Egypt. Pharnaces took advantage of this to invade part of Anatolia.

Cassius Dio wrote that Pharnaces seized Colchis easily. He took advantage of the absence of Deiotarus, the king of Galatia and Lesser Armenia, to seize Lesser Armenia, part of Cappadocia, and some cities in the Roman province of Bithynia and Pontus which had formerly been part of the Kingdom of Pontus and had been assigned to the Bithynia district of that province. Caesar, who still had trouble in Egypt, sent Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus to take charge of the Roman legions in Roman province of Asia. Domitius added the forces of Deiotarus and Ariobarzanes III, the king of Cappadocia, to his forces. He advanced towards Pharnaces, who had seized Nicopolis, a city in Lesser Armenia. Pharnaces sent envoys to negotiate an armistice. Domitius rejected this, attacked, was defeated and withdrew back to Asia. Pharnaces then conquered the rest of Pontus. He seized the city of Amisus in Pontus, plundered it and killed all its men of military age. He next advanced towards Bithynia and the Roman province of Asia, but stopped because he learnt that Asander, whom he had left in charge back home in the Cimmerian Bosporus had revolted.

Plutarch wrote that Pharnaces defeated Domitius, who withdrew from Pontus. He then occupied Bithynia and Cappadocia. After that he set his eyes on Lesser Armenia. He incited the princes and tetrarchs of that territory to revolt. In his book on the Civil Wars, Appian only mentioned that Pharnaces seized the city of Amisus in Pontus, sold its inhabitants into slavery and made the boys eunuchs. However, in his book on the Mithridatic Wars, he wrote that Pharnaces seized Sinope in Pontus and wanted to also take Amisus (further east in Pontus) and that it was for this reason that he made war on Domitius. However, the rebellion of Asander drew him away from Roman Asia. Florus only mentioned Cappadocia and wrote that Pharnaces relied on Roman internal feuds rather that his valour to invade it.

Cicero wrote that Deiotarus also supported Domitius financially and sent him money to Ephesus. He sent him money a third time by auctioning some of his property to raise it.

The Alexandrine War gives more details about the interactions between Domitius and Pharnaces. King Deiotarus went to see to Calvinus to beg him not to allow Lesser Armenia or Cappadocia, to be overrun by Pharnaces, otherwise he could not pay the money he had promised to Caesar. Domitius considered this money to be indispensable for the military expenses and felt that it would be shameful if the kingdoms of the Roman allies and friends were to be seized by Pharnaces. Thus, he sent envoys to Pharnaces to ask him to withdraw from Armenia and Cappadocia, believing that this would have greater impact than advancing on him with an army. He had sent two legions to Caesar for his war in Alexandria. He had at his disposal only one Roman legion, the 36th, and two legions provided by Deiotarus which were equipped and trained the Roman way. He had 1000 cavalry and received the same number of cavalry from Ariobarzanes II. A lieutenant was sent to Cilicia to gather auxiliary troops. A legion was also raised hastily and in an improvised manner in Pontus. These forces assembled at Comana on Pontus.

Pharnaces sent a reply in which he said that he had withdrawn from Cappadocia but had recovered Lesser Armenia which was his inheritance from his father and that, regarding this, he would wait for Caesar&#x27;s reply and comply with what he decided. Domitius thought that he had withdrawn from Cappadocia out of necessity rather than his free will because he heard about the two legions sent to Caesar and thought that if they advanced towards Armenia, he could defend it better if he stayed in Lesser Armenia. Domitius insisted that Pharnaces should withdraw from Lesser Armenia, too, and marched towards Armenia through a wooded ridge which formed the border between Cappadocia and Armenia and extended into Lesser Armenia. This was higher ground in which he could not be attacked. He could also get supplies from Cappadocia from here. Pharnaces sent several embassies for peace talks, which were rejected. Domitius encamped near Nicopolis in Lesser Armenia. There was a narrow defile nearby. Pharnaces set up an ambush with selected infantrymen and all his cavalry. He got the local farmers to graze their cattle at various points in the gorge so that Domitius would not suspect an ambush and to encourage his troops to scatter to plunder the cattle. He also kept sending envoys for further deceit. However, this resulted in Domitius staying in his camp. Pharnaces was worried that his ambush might be discovered and recalled his troops to camp.

Domitius set off for Nicopolis and encamped by the town. Pharnaces lined up for battle, but Domitius did not take this up and completed the fortification of his camp. Pharnaces intercepted dispatches from Caesar to Domitius and learnt that the latter was still in difficulty in Alexandria and was asking Domitius to send him reinforcements and to advance closer to Alexandria via Syria. Pharnaces thought that Domitius was about to withdraw. He dug two trenches on the path which would be easier to do battle. He placed his infantry between the trenches and the cavalry, which far outnumbered the Roman cavalry, on the flanks, outside the trenches. Domitius thought that it would not be safe to withdraw. He lined up for battle near his camp, posting the legions of Deioratus in the centre, the 36th on the right and the one from Pontus in a narrow line supported by the remaining cohorts.

In the battle the 36th attacked the enemy cavalry successfully and advanced close to the city walls, crossed the trench and attacked the enemy rear. The Pontic legion tried to go cross the trench to attack the enemy&#x27;s exposed flank. However, while crossing, it was pinned down and overwhelmed. The legions of Deiotarus hardly offered any resistance. Pharnaces, having won in the centre and the right turned on the 36th and surrounded it. This legion formed a circle and, while fighting, it withdrew to a hill, losing only 250 men. Domitius retreated to Asia via Cappadocia. Pharnaces occupied Pontus, took many towns by storm, plundered the property of Roman and Pontic citizens and meted out harsh punishments on the youth. He boasted that he had recovered the kingdom of his father and thought that Caesar would be defeated in Alexandria.

==Defeat by Gaius Julius Caesar==
Cassius Dio wrote that after escaping the siege of Alexandria and defeating Ptolemy XIII of Egypt, Caesar rushed to Armenia. Pharnaces, who was heading north to deal with the rebellion of Asander, turned back to meet Caesar. He was worried about the speed with which he was advancing. He sent envoys to Caesar to see if he could make terms with him, reminding him that he had never cooperated with Pompey. He hoped for a truce and that Caesar would proceed to deal with urgent matters in Italy and Africa, after which he could resume his war. Caesar suspected this and treated two embassies well, so that Pharnaces would hope for peace and he could attack him by surprise. However, he reproached Pharnaces when a third embassy arrived. On the same day he engaged in battle. There was confusion caused by the cavalry and scythe-bearing chariots of the enemy, but then Caesar won.

According to Plutarch, Caesar learned about the defeat of Domitius by Pharnaces and that Pharnaces was taking advantage of this to occupy Bithynia and Cappadocia and hoped to gain Lesser Armenia by instigating revolts by the local princes and tetrarchs when he left Egypt and was crossing Asia. Caesar advanced against him with three legions. He defeated Pharnaces in the Battle of Zela (see Battle of Zela (47 BC)), annihilated his army and drove him out of Pontus. Suetonius wrote that Caesar proceeded via Syria and defeated Pharnaces “in a single battle within five days after his arrival and four hours after getting sight of him.” Frontinus wrote that Caesar drew up his battle line on a hill. This made victory easy as his men could throw darts at the enemy and put them to flight quickly. Appian wrote that when Caesar was within 200 stades (c. 3 km, 1.9 miles), Pharnaces sent envoys to negotiate peace. They brought a golden crown and offered him Pharnaces’ daughter in marriage. Caesar walked in front of his army and talked to the envoys until he reached the camp of Pharnaces. He then said, &quot;Why should I not take instant vengeance on this parricide?&quot; He jumped on his horse and started the battle, killing many of the enemy, even though he had only 100 cavalry.

Plutarch and Appian wrote that Caesar wrote the word ‘veni, vidi vici’. These are usually translated as ‘I came, I saw, I conquered.’ Plutarch said that Caesar wrote these words to announce “the swiftness and fierceness of this battle to one of his friends at Rome, Amantius” Florus remarked that Caesar crushed Pharnaces “like a thunderbolt which in one and the same moment has come, has struck and has departed. Caesar&#x27;s boast was no vain one when he said that the enemy was defeated before he was seen.” Appian wrote that Caesar “exclaimed, &quot;O fortunate Pompey, who was considered and named the Great for warring against such men as these in the time of Mithridates, the father of this man.&quot; Suetonius wrote that after this victory Caesar often remarked “on Pompey&#x27;s good luck in gaining his principal fame as a general by victories over such feeble foemen.”

Caesar then sailed to Syria. There he received news of political trouble in Rome. His presence in Rome was urgent. Caesar wanted to quickly sort out affairs in Syria, Cilicia and Asia and deal with Pharnaces first. He visited the more important states in Syria to settle local disputes. He then sailed to Cilicia and summoned all the states of the province and settled local affairs. In Cappadocia he prevented disputes between Ariobarzanes II of Cappadocia and his brother Ariarathes by giving the latter part of Lesser Armenia as a vassal of the former. In Galatia, close to the border with Pontus, he ordered Deiotarus to provide a Galatian legion. This was a modest and inexperienced force. Besides this legion Caesar had the veteran 6th legion he had brought from Alexandria, which had lost many men in previous combats and was reduced to 1,000 men, and two legions which had fought with Domitius.

Caesar received envoys from Pharnaces who asked him not to start hostilities and said that Pharnaces would obey his instructions. Caesar replied that he would be fair if Pharnaces kept his promise and ordered him to withdraw from Pontus and make restitutions to Rome&#x27;s allies and Roman citizens. He would accept his gifts (Pharnaces had sent him a golden crown) only after he had done what he was asked. Pharnaces promised to comply and, hoping that Caesar would trust him as he had to return to Rome in a hurry, he asked for a later date for his withdrawal and proposed agreements as a delaying tactic. Caesar understood this and decided to act swiftly and catch him by surprise.

Pharnaces was encamped near Zela, in Pontus, which was in a plain. Around the town there many hills and valleys. A very high hill, three miles from the town, was linked to it by paths on higher ground. Pharnaces had repaired the rampart of the camp his father had built when he posted his forces there during the Third Mithridatic War. Caesar encamped five miles away. He ordered his men to collect material for a rampant. The following night he left his camp with all his troops and occupied a spot nearer the enemy camp which was the place where Pharnaces’ father defeated a Roman army. This caught the enemy by surprise. Caesar got slaves to bring the material for the rampart, which the soldiers begun to build.

Pharnaces lined up all his forces in front of Caesar&#x27;s camp, on the opposite side of the valley. In order not to delay the construction work, Caesar drew up only his first line in front of it. Pharnaces began to march down the steep ravine which was unsuitable for military action. He then placed his force in battle array and climbed the steep hillside. His foolhardiness was unexpected and caught Caesar unprepared. He recalled his men from their work and formed a battle line. They panicked because they were not in regular formation. Pharnaces&#x27; scythed chariots threw the men into confusion. However, the chariots were quickly overwhelmed by a mass of missiles. Then the enemy infantry engaged, and heavy fighting started. The 6th legion on the right wing pushed the enemy back down the slope. So did, but more slowly, the left wing and the centre. The uneven ground made this easier. Many of the enemy were trampled over by falling comrades and many were killed. The Romans seized the enemy camp and the entire force was killed or captured. Pharnaces escaped. This victory filled Caesar &#x27;with incredible delight&#x27; because he brought a very serious war to an end quickly, won an easy victory and resolved a very difficult situation.

==Death==
After his defeat, Pharnaces fled to Sinope with 1,000 cavalry. Caesar, who was too busy to follow him, sent Domitius after him. Pharnaces surrendered Sinope. Domitius agreed to let him leave with his cavalrymen, but killed his horses. Pharnaces sailed to the Cimmerian Bosporus, intending to recover it from Asander. He collected a force of Scythians and Sarmatians, and captured Theodosia and Panticapaeum. In response, Asander attacked and defeated Pharnaces. He was defeated because he was short of horses and his men were not used to fighting on foot. Pharnaces was killed in this battle. Strabo wrote that Asander then took possession of the Bosporus. In response, Julius Caesar gave a tetrarchy in Galatia and the title of king to Mithridates of Pergamon. This Mithridates became Mithridates I of the Bosporus. Caesar also allowed him to wage war against Asander and conquer the Cimmerian Bosporus because he had shown cruelty to his friend Pharnaces.

Pharnaces II was fifty years old at his death and had been the king of the Cimmerian Bosporus fifteen years.

==Coinage==
Gold and silver coins have survived from his reign dating from 55 BC to 50 BC. An example displays a portrait of Pharnaces II on the obverse. On the reverse, it displays Apollo semi-draped, seated on a lion-footed throne, holding a laurel branch over a tripod. Apollo&#x27;s left elbow is resting on a cithara at his side. On top and between Apollo is inscribed his royal title in Greek: &quot;ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΝ ΜΕΓΑΛΟΥ ΦΑΡΝΑΚΟΥ&quot;, which means &quot;of King of Kings Pharnaces the Great&quot;.

==Marriage, issue and succession==
In the early 1st century BC Mithridates VI made an alliance with the Sarmatian tribes, and, probably through this alliance, Pharnaces (possibly sometime after 77 BC) married an unnamed Sarmatian noblewoman. She may have been a princess, a relative of a ruling Sarmatian monarch or an influential aristocrat of some stature. His Sarmatian wife bore Pharnaces a son, Darius, a daughter, Dynamis, and a son, Arsaces. The names that Pharnaces II gave his children are a representation of his Persian and Greek heritage and ancestry. His sons were made Pontic kings for a time after his death, by Roman triumvir Mark Antony. His daughter and her family succeeded him as ruling monarchs of the Bosporan Kingdom. Pharnaces II through his daughter would have further descendants ruling the Bosporan Kingdom.

==Pharnaces II in opera==
The 18th-century librettist Antonio Maria Lucchini crafted a libretto based on incidents from the life of Pharnaces II that was originally set by Antonio Vivaldi in 1727 under the title &quot;Farnace&quot;. Based on the number of revivals of it that were staged, it must be counted as one of Vivaldi&#x27;s most successful operas. A few later composers also set Lucchini&#x27;s libretto, among them Josef Mysliveček, with Farnace of 1767. Pharnaces II also appears in Mitridate by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

<text>Isaac Bickerstaff Esq was a pseudonym used by Jonathan Swift as part of a hoax to predict the death of then-famous Almanac-maker and astrologer John Partridge.

&quot;All Fools&#x27; Day&quot; (1 April, now known as April Fools&#x27; Day) was Swift&#x27;s favourite holiday, and he often used this day to aim his satirical wit at non-believers in an attempt to &quot;make sin and folly bleed&quot;. Disgruntled by Partridge&#x27;s sarcastic attack about the &quot;&quot;infallible&quot; Church&quot; written in his 1708 issue of &quot;Merlinus Almanac&quot;, Swift projected three letters and a eulogy as an elaborate plan to &quot;predict&quot; Partridge&#x27;s &quot;&quot;infallible&quot; death&quot; on 29 March, the anniversary of the famous 1652 &quot;Black Monday&quot; eclipse, widely seen as discrediting to astrology.

The first of the three letters, &quot;Predictions for the Year 1708&quot;, published in January 1708, predicts, among other things, the death of Partridge by a &quot;raging fever&quot;. In the second letter, &quot;The Accomplishment of the First of Mr. Bickerstaff&#x27;s Predictions&quot;, published in March 1708, Swift writes not as Bickerstaff but as a &quot;man employed in the Revenue&quot;, and &quot;confirms&quot; the imaginary Bickerstaff&#x27;s prediction. To accompany &quot;The Accomplishments&quot;, Swift also published an elegy for Partridge in which, typical of Swift&#x27;s satire, he blames not only Partridge, but those who purchase the Almanacs as well:

The hoax gained immense popularity, and plagued Partridge to the true end of his life. Mourners, believing him dead, often kept him awake at night by crying outside his window. Accounts of an undertaker arriving at his house to arrange drapes for the mourning, an elegy being printed and even a gravestone being carved, culminate in Partridge publishing a letter in hopes of having the last word and proclaiming (and reclaiming) himself as living. In 1709 Swift, writing as Bickerstaff for the last time, published &quot;A Vindication of Isaac Bickerstaff&quot;, in which he abandoned any real attempt to maintain the hoax but disputed Partridge&#x27;s public letter, saying, &quot;There were sure no man alive ever to writ such damned stuff as this.&quot; He went on sarcastically to reason that &quot;Death is defined by all Philosophers [as a] Separation of the Soul and Body. Now it is certain, that the poor Woman, who has best Reason to know [Partridge&#x27;s wife], has gone about for some time to every Alley in the Neighbourhood, and swore to the Gossips, that Her Husband had neither Life nor Soul in Him.&quot;

==Later influence==
Later in 1709, Richard Steele bolstered the release of his new paper &quot;The Tatler&quot; by naming the fictitious Isaac Bickerstaff Esq. as editor. &quot;The Tatler&quot; had occasional contributions from Swift, although largely written by Steele and Joseph Addison.

Benjamin Franklin based the persona of &quot;Poor Richard&quot;, the author of &quot;Poor Richard&#x27;s Almanack&quot;, on Swift&#x27;s Bickerstaff character.

In Jules Verne&#x27;s 1895 novel &quot;Propeller Island&quot;, the governor of the titular island is named Cyrus Bikerstaff, in tribute to Swift&#x27;s character.

H. P. Lovecraft used the pseudonym &quot;Isaac Bickerstaffe [sic], Jr.&quot; in 1914 for a series of letters to the editor of &quot;The Providence Evening News&quot;, refuting the predictions of an astrologer the paper published.

The Canadian caricaturist Don Evans (born Toronto, 1936) published in 1975–85 three volumes of cartoons under the pseudonym Isaac Bickerstaff. He lives in Orillia, Ontario, where he is active in local politics. Personal archives including 300 drawings are at the University of Calgary.

In the novel &quot;The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society&quot; (2008) and its eponymous 2018 film adaptation, the lead character, author Juliet Ashton, writes under the pen name Izzy Bickerstaff.

Adam J. Smith and Jo Waugh of &quot;The Conversation&quot; and Patricia Casey, writing for the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;, have suggested that fictional Twitter user Titania McGrath, created by comedian and &quot;Spiked&quot; columnist Andrew Doyle, was influenced by Bickerstaff.

<text>John Partridge (1644 – ) was an English astrologer, the author and publisher of a number of astrological almanacs and books.

==Life==

Partridge was born 18 January 1644 (OS) in East Sheen, Surrey, and died in either 1714 or 1715.

Although starting out in life humbly enough (he was working as a shoemaker in Covent Garden around 1680), Partridge managed to teach himself enough Latin, Greek, Hebrew and astrology to enroll at Leyden University, Holland. He graduated in Medicine and by 1682 was styling himself &quot;Physician to his Majesty&quot;. Although he was one of the sworn physicians of the court, he apparently never attended nor received any salary.

Partridge undertook to himself the task of reforming astrology. His program for reform involved eliminating the elements derived for the medieval Arabic tradition in favour of a return to Ptolemy.

Partridge was strongly identified with the Whig faction in seventeenth-century English politics. He was forced into exile in the Dutch Republic during the reign of James II. The reign was also marked by Partridge&#x27;s feud with his former astrological mentor John Gadbury, who converted to Catholicism. This quarrel spread into a feud with George Parker.

==Swift hoax==

In the 1708 edition of the &quot;Merlinus Almanac&quot;, Partridge sarcastically referred to the Church of England as the &quot;infallible Church&quot;. This drew the attention of satirist and Church of Ireland cleric Jonathan Swift. Playing on Partridge&#x27;s own (generally inaccurate) yearly predictions of deaths of notable individuals, Swift, writing under the pseudonym Isaac Bickerstaff, predicted in a letter published in January 1708 that Partridge himself would die an &quot;infallible death&quot; on 29 March that year. On that date, Swift published another letter (purportedly by a &quot;man employed in the Revenue&quot;) confirming Partridge&#x27;s death. The letter was reprinted by other writers and publishers along with its brilliant accompanying eulogy:

&quot;Here five foot deep lyes on his back&quot;&lt;br&gt;
 &quot;A cobbler, starmonger, and quack…&quot;&lt;br&gt;
 &quot;Who to the stars in pure good-will&quot;,&lt;br&gt;
 &quot;Does to his best look upward still.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
 &quot;Weep all you customers that use&quot;&lt;br&gt;
 &quot;His pills, his almanacks or shoes.&quot;

When Partridge published a letter proclaiming that he had not in fact died, Swift announced that his letter was false, as &quot;no man alive ever writ such damned stuff as this.&quot; Partridge&#x27;s intense unpopularity among Church supporters, those whose deaths he had falsely predicted, anti-Whigs, and those who felt his &quot;astrology&quot; was in reality quackery kept the hoax going long after Swift finally dispensed with it. Partridge reportedly suffered from the effects of the hoax for the rest of his life.

<text>Télesphore-Damien Bouchard (December 20, 1881 – November 13, 1962) was a politician in Quebec, Canada.

Born in Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec, he was the mayor of the municipality from 1917 to 1930 and from 1932 to 1944 and president of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities in 1918. He also founded the Union des municipalités de la province de Québec (Federation of municipalities in the province of Quebec) in 1919. He served as Liberal leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly of Quebec from 1936 to 1939, after Liberal leader Adélard Godbout lost the 1936 election and also narrowly lost his own seat. Bouchard served as opposition leader while Godbout remained leader of the Liberal Party.

After the Liberals returned to power in the 1939 election, he served in Godbout&#x27;s cabinet. Resigned in 1944 when he was appointed to the Senate, where he remained until his death. Overall, he was the MLA for the district of Saint-Hyacinthe from 1912 to 1919 and from 1923 to 1944.

A leading campaigner for public ownership of electric utilities, he became first president of Hydro-Québec in April 1944. Two months later he was fired by Premier Godbout, after Bouchard made a series of anticlerical statements.

<doc id="531362" wikidata="Q7543114" url="?curid=531362" title="Small multiple">
<text>A small multiple (sometimes called trellis chart, lattice chart, grid chart, or panel chart) is a series of similar graphs or charts using the same scale and axes, allowing them to be easily compared. It uses multiple views to show different partitions of a dataset. The term was popularized by Edward Tufte.

According to Tufte,

==Modern example==
In the example, the departmental salary expense is charted by month with a dashed line indicating the average for each department. The scales on each panel are different to emphasize the relative change over time compared to the range. Standardizing the scales could provide insight into comparisons in magnitude between the different departments. Two independent Y axes may be utilized when presenting data with different numeric scales in each panel.

== Historical examples ==

Some of the earliest known examples of this type of visualization include the photographic series &quot;Horse In Motion&quot; by Eadweard Muybridge, around 1886, and Francis Amasa Walker&#x27;s chart of citizen&#x27;s occupations in census year 1870 appearing in the &quot;Statistical Atlas of the United States.&quot;

Muybridge&#x27;s work not only proved for the first time that all four of a horse&#x27;s hooves left the ground during gallop (see upper central plates), but it also broke new ground in terms of artistic expression and became foundational to the development of the motion picture. Muybridge went on to produce many more examples of small multiples showing animal locomotion through the medium of stop-motion photography, including boys playing leapfrog and a bison cantering.

Sketched graphic examples can be found in Francis Amasa Walker&#x27;s charts appearing in the 1870 &quot;Statistical Atlas of the United States.&quot; Superintendent of the US Census at the time of its creation, Walker was determined to modernize the Census collection and analysis methods and used the Atlas to present the final data set using unprecedented visual forms, including many beautiful examples of small multiples.
Adjacent is a chart showing the population broken down by occupation, including a count of those attending school, according to the 1870 Census. This graphic is innovative in its use of both a treemap display and a latticed layout of small multiples. Additional examples appearing in the &quot;Atlas&quot; include side-by-side geographic maps showing the changes in population over time, as well as tiled mosaic charts showing population demographic breakdowns, and diverging bar graphs showing deaths broken down by age and gender, tiled by state.

== Thematic maps ==

Small multiples are a popular technique in cartographic design for multivariate mapping. As with the small multiple chart, each panel uses the same underlying two-dimensional space, but in this case that is a geographic space. Typically, the variables being mapped are of a similar type, such as types of agricultural products, so that the same strategy of map symbol can be used on each panel, enabling rapid comparison between the maps. 

Another common use of small multiples is to show change in spatial patterns over time, as an alternative to an animated map. Several tests of the effectiveness of each method have generally concluded that they have distinct advantages, with animation being better for seeing trends, especially movement, and small multiples being better for making comparisons between times.

=== Origins (1899–1913) ===

The school was founded on October 2, 1899, by Sir Patrick Manson as the London School of Tropical Medicine after the Parsi philanthropist Bomanjee Dinshaw Petit made a donation of £6,666.

It was initially located at the Albert Dock Seamen&#x27;s Hospital in the London Docklands. Just prior to this teaching in tropical medicine had been commenced in 1899 at the Extramural school at Edinburgh and even earlier at London&#x27;s Livingstone College founded in 1893. Before giving lectures at St George&#x27;s Hospital, London, in 1895, Livingstone College afforded Manson his first opportunity to teach courses in tropical medicine. Manson&#x27;s early career was as a physician in the Far East. On his return to London, he was appointed Medical Advisor to the Colonial Office. He strongly believed that physicians should be trained in tropical medicine to treat British colonial administrators and others working throughout Britain&#x27;s tropical empire. He also encouraged and mentored Ronald Ross during this period to uncover the correct etiology of malaria, which Ross subsequently discovered in 1897, winning the Nobel Prize for his efforts. The original school was established as part of the Seamen&#x27;s Hospital Society.

In 1902, the benefactor Petit wrote the following about the institution in a letter to Sir Francis Lovell (Dean of the school), quoted in &quot;The Times&quot;. 
Among the school&#x27;s early achievements were discoveries by George Carmichael Low, who proved filariasis is spread by mosquito bites, and Aldo Castellani, who discovered trypanosomes in the cerebral fluid of those affected by sleeping sickness. Experiments were also conducted by the school&#x27;s faculty which provided proof that mosquitoes act as the vector in the spread of malaria.

=== World Wars (1914–1945) ===
During World War I, many of the faculty were conscripted into the army where they often continued to treat or research tropical diseases with the aim of protecting the health of the troops fighting in the Middle Eastern and African campaigns. Meanwhile, enough faculty remained at the school to continue its operations, although enrollment drastically fell during the war. The remaining faculty contributed to the war effort nonetheless by becoming increasingly involved in treating soldiers with dysentery, malaria, and other tropical diseases after their return from overseas. On the night of January 19, 1917, a TNT explosion from a nearby munition depot damaged the school and hospital, further complicating the school&#x27;s operations. The school&#x27;s wartime contributions were acknowledged on October 10, 1917, by a surprise visit from King George V and in 1918 by a visit from Queen Mary, Prince Edward, and Princess Mary.
As a result of the war, the school expected an increase in the amount of patients with tropical diseases and so a resolution was proposed to move the school to Central London to improve upon the school&#x27;s isolated location. Consequently, the school moved, together with the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, to Endsleigh Gardens in central London, taking over a former hotel which had been used as a hospital for officers during the First World War. The building was officially opened by George VI, then Duke of York, on 11 November 1920. In 1921 the Athlone Committee recommended the creation of an institute of state medicine, which built on a proposal by the Rockefeller Foundation to develop a London-based institution that would lead the world in the promotion of public health and tropical medicine. This enlarged school, now named the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, was granted its Royal Charter in 1924. The school moved to the current building in 1929.

The school remained at its location in London during World War II despite the risk of bombings and an offer for accommodation by Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge. The number of students and staff fell as a result of the war, with some staff being called upon for military service. After 1941 and continuing until the end of the war, regular instruction ceased and the school instead started providing short courses in tropical medicine to nurses and doctors of the Allied Forces. On 10 May 1941, a bomb struck the building and caused a fire which was only put out the following morning due to a lack of firemen. Only four people were present at the time and remained unharmed, however, around a sixth of the building was damaged, with particularly the side facing Malet Street sustaining extensive damage. Although the damage was only fully repaired seven years later, teaching of short courses resumed the Monday after the bombing.

=== Post-war period (1946–1960) ===
The healthcare environment changed in the wake of the war, both nationally and internationally, with the establishment of the National Health Service and the World Health Organization. The Chief Medical Officer and former Dean of LSHTM, Sir Wilson Jameson, played a critical role in the establishment of both.

LSHTM served a crucial role in reshaping scientific research and public health in the post-war period. Sir Austin Bradford Hill, a professor of Medical Statistics at the school, was the statistician on the Medical Research Council Streptomycin in Tuberculosis Trials Committee and their 1948 study evaluating the use of streptomycin in treating tuberculosis, which is generally accepted as the first randomized controlled trial to have been conducted. Two years later Bradford Hill and Sir Richard Doll, a member of the MRC Statistical Research Unit based at LSHTM, were the first to demonstrate the association between cigarette smoking and lung cancer. They also set up the well-known British Doctors Study to provide evidence for a causal relationship. In 1951, alumnus Max Theiler was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine &quot;for his discoveries concerning yellow fever and how to combat it&quot;. George Macdonald, professor of tropical hygiene and director of the Ross Institute at LSHTM, was the first to propose the basic reproduction number (formula_1) in his 1952 study of malaria, which remains a key statistic in the study of infectious diseases to this day. The following year, alumnus Jerry Morris was the first to establish the role of physical exercise in preventing heart disease. Richard Doll established the connection between asbestos and lung cancer in 1955, while two Readers at the school established the connection between air pollution and respiratory diseases in 1958.

=== End of the 20th century (1961–1999) ===
The university went through various changes during the latter part of the 20th century. In 1962 it acquired its first electronic computer in a collaboration with Birkbeck College, while a year later it built insectaries in its vault with financial support from the Wellcome Trust. Due to the school&#x27;s need for work with live insects, the insectaries were thought to have housed the largest mosquito farm in the world. In the meantime the school closed its library and expanded the Keppel Street building to increase research and teaching space. Once completed in 1967, the modernised parts were officially opened by Princess Alexandra. In the final years of the millennium, the school launched its first distance learning programmes to an initial enrollment of 149 students for the 1998/1999 cohort.

The faculty of the school continued to make significant contributions to scientific research and public health. This included further work by Austin Bradford Hill, who postulated the Bradford Hill criteria in 1965 to determine causality. The criteria have since been widely used in public health research. LSHTM also started the long-running Whitehall Study in 1967 which found significant social inequalities in health in the 18,000 participants from the UK Civil Service. The Black Report published in 1980, for which alumnus Jerry Morris was one of the contributors, found similar inequalities. In 1972, the first case of lassa fever in the U.K. was diagnosed at the school. The school&#x27;s faculty were also involved in research projects to advance understanding and prevention of various infectious diseases around this time, such as the Karongo Prevention Study in Malawi. Professors at the university developed the sisterhood method in 1989, thereby increasing the accuracy of maternal mortality data from low-income countries and developing a method which is still recommended by the WHO to this day. The National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles was launched by the school in 1990 and is still being run with partners at University College London.

=== Modern era (2000–present) ===
The school went through various expansions in 2004, 2009, 2010, 2017, and 2018 to accommodate the school&#x27;s rapid growth. The expansion in 2010 was the first time the university expanded outside of its Keppel Street location to Tavistock Place. The new location was originally intended as a joint project with UCL, however, the project was eventually amended and scaled down when UCL pulled out of the project. Tavistock Place was further expanded in 2017 with an additional research facility. Moreover, the MRC Unit The Gambia and the MRC Uganda Research Unit officially joined the university in 2018. These transfers were part of the MRC&#x27;s long-term programme of transferring Units into a host University in order to bring strategic benefits to both parties.

In 2004, professor Liam Smeeth was unable to find any association between the MMR vaccine and autism, thereby providing proof against the fraudulent Lancet MMR autism paper by Andrew Wakefield. In subsequent years, professor Joy Lawn led various studies and publications on neonatal deaths, including the 2011 and 2016 The Lancet Stillbirth Series. In 2016, various LSHTM researchers contributed to the understanding of the 2015–16 Zika virus epidemic. A year later, alumnus Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus became the Director-General of the World Health Organization.

An independent review published in 2021 concluded there is evidence of structural racism at LSHTM. The findings included that staff of colour are less likely to be promoted, more likely to be on short-term contracts, and that leadership has been too slow to act on issues of colonialism and racism. The school&#x27;s Director apologised to those who have been affected and stated the school is committed to address the issues. The school&#x27;s Council commissioned the review in the wake of the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests.

==== Response to the 2014 Ebola epidemic ====
When the World Health Organization declared that the Western African Ebola virus epidemic was a public health emergency of international concern in August 2014, LSHTM coordinated various response efforts. More than 500 academic and professional services staff volunteered to respond, with many volunteers deployed via Save the Children, Public Health England, Médecins Sans Frontières and the WHO. LSHTM continued to pay the salary of anyone who volunteered to work on Ebola care and control in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, or backfill posts in WHO offices. Staff and students carried out mathematical modelling and other research to support Ebola response planning. Experts, including LSHTM faculty, established an Ebola Response Anthropology Platform to help health workers develop culturally sensitive interventions and developed free online education programmes to combat the spread of the disease. Researchers, including researchers from LSHTM, carried out accelerated clinical trials in the field, including the EBOVAC Ebola vaccine trials which is still ongoing. LSHTM was part of an independent panel advising on major reforms targeted at prevention of future global outbreaks and now runs the UK Public Health Rapid Support Team in partnership with Public Health England, funded by the UK Government. Former LSHTM Director Peter Piot was named among &#x27;the Ebola fighters&#x27; as Time Person of the Year and LSHTM itself also won various awards for its response.

==Campus==

The school moved to its present location near the intersection of Gower Street and Keppel Street in 1929. A competition to design a new school building to be sited in Gower Street, was held involving five architects, all experienced in laboratory design and construction. This was won in 1925 by Morley Horder and Verner O. Rees who located the main entrance in Keppel Street. The foundation stone was laid in 1926 by Neville Chamberlain, then Minister of Health, and the completed building was opened in 1929 by the Prince of Wales, later to become Edward VIII. The purchase of the site and the cost of a new building was made possible through a gift of $2m from the Rockefeller Foundation.

Although the building&#x27;s façade has remained largely unchanged, the interior has gone through various renovations. The first renovation was completed in 1951 to restore bomb damage sustained during World War II, with the subsequent decades seeing further building work to add and redevelop floors. In 2004 a new seven-storey building within the school&#x27;s north courtyard was opened by Desmond Tutu, while the Princess Royal opened a new five-storey building in the south of the courtyard in 2009.

The school also has a secondary site on Tavistock Place to the east since 2010.

==Organisation and administration==

===Governance===
The school&#x27;s sole governing body under its Royal Charter is the council. It has sole management control and supervision of the institution, though it delegates some of its functions to its committees and some operational powers to the Director of the school. The Council meets four times a year and has a diverse membership, with various independent members as well as elected staff members and a membership for the Director of the school. The current chair is Don Robert, who is also the Chairman of the London Stock Exchange Group.

The school is an exempt charity and as such is regulated by the Office for Students.

===Faculties===

====Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health====

The Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health aims to develop and use its research expertise ranging from clinical trials, statistical analysis, genetic epidemiology, large-scale observational studies and field trials through to the design and evaluation of clinical and public health interventions in low, middle and high-income countries. It has around 300 academic staff and 150 research students who work in more than 20 countries on topics ranging from infectious to chronic diseases. It runs various master&#x27;s degree programmes and short courses, while LSHTM&#x27;s Clinical Trials Unit is also run under this faculty.

====Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases====
The Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases (ITD) was formed in August 1997 and encompasses all of the laboratory-based research in the school as well as that on the clinical and epidemiological aspects of infectious and tropical diseases. The Faculty is organised into three large departments and has over 500 members of staff. The range of disciplines represented in the faculty is very broad and inter-disciplinary research is a feature of much of its activity.

The spectrum of diseases studied is wide and there are major research groups working on topics which include:

*HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases
*malaria and other vector borne diseases
*tuberculosis
*vaccine development and evaluation
*vector biology and disease control

There is close interaction between scientists in different research teams. The Faculty has overseas links which provide a basis for field studies and international collaborations in developed and developing countries. Funding for research in the Faculty comes from around 45 funding organisations and agencies.

====Faculty of Public Health and Policy====

The Faculty of Public Health and Policy aims to improve global health through research, teaching and the provision of advice in the areas of health policy, health systems and services, and individual, social and environmental influences on health. Interests and activities embrace the health needs of people living in countries at all levels of development.
The school has the largest numbers of research active staff in the areas of epidemiology, public health and health services research in the UK. The Faculty of Public Health and Policy has over 250 members of staff, including epidemiologists, public health physicians, economists, policy analysts, anthropologists, sociologists, historians, psychologists, statisticians and mathematicians. The Faculty&#x27;s research programmes, with an annual spend of over £7m, focus on public health problems of importance both globally and in the UK, and build on an extensive network of collaborations.

The research programmes exploit multidisciplinary and multi-method approaches, generate new knowledge for specific contexts and test transferability to different settings, and engage with policymakers and providers of health care to ensure research is relevant and translated into practice.

The Faculty hosts School Centres in the areas of History in Public Health, Research on Drugs and Health Behaviours, Spatial Analysis in Public Health, Global Change and Health, Health of Societies in Transition (ECOHOST), and Gender Violence and Health. In addition, staff participate in Centres based in other departments, notably the Malaria Centre and the Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Disease.

===Logo===
The seal of LSHTM is based on a coin from the archeological site Selinus, Sicily struck in 466 BC. It was designed by the sculptor and medallist Allan Gairdner Wyon. It shows two Greek gods associated with health – Apollo, the god of prophecy, music and medicine, and his sister Artemis, goddess of hunting and chastity, and comforter of women in childbirth – in a horse-drawn chariot. Artemis is driving while her brother the great archer is shooting arrows. The fruitful date palm was added to indicate the tropical activities of the school but also has a close connection with Apollo and Artemis: when their mother Leto gave birth to them on the island of Delos, miraculously a palm sprang up to give her shade in childbirth.

Asclepius, Apollo&#x27;s son, was the god of ancient Greek medicine, and was frequently shown holding a staff entwined with a snake. Snakes were used in this healing cult to lick the affected part of the patient. Significantly Asclepius&#x27; five daughters were Hygeia (the goddess of healthiness), Panacea (the healer of all ailments), Iaso (recuperation from illness); Aceso (the healing process); and Aegle (radiant good health). Asclepius&#x27; staff with a snake coiled round it (known as a symbol of the medical professions) was placed at the base of the seal to emphasise the medical interests of the school. The seal was redesigned in 1990 by Russell Sewell Design Associates, and is retained today within the current LSHTM logo.

<text>Dorfan was an American toy company based in Newark, New Jersey from 1924 to 1934.

Their production lines specialized in O gauge and Wide gauge toy trains.

==History==
Bringing years of previous toy making experience, Milton and Julius Forcheimer, two immigrant cousins from Nuremberg, Germany, whose family was involved in the production of Fandor trains founded Dorfan in 1924. The Fandor brand name is an amalgam of Fannie &amp; Dora (who were the mothers of Milton &amp; Julius). When Milton &amp; Julius immigrated to America, they reversed the names Dora &amp; Fannie to create the Dorfan name. A Fandor engineer, John C. Koerber, helped to get Dorfan started (McKenney 1993; Dorfan, pp. 165–166).

Dorfan entered into a well developed American market for electric trains. A market dominated by Ives, Lionel and American Flyer. But it entered at a most opportune time, the American market was in an upswing. Dorfan gained considerable market share through promotion, innovation and manufacture. Dorfan gained enough ground to be included among the &quot;Big Four&quot; of American prewar model train manufacturers (McKenney, Greenberg 1993; Dorfan, pp. 5–6,163–165).

Dorfan produced detailed tinplate rolling stock with diecast power units. Dorfan was the first U.S. train manufacturer to use die casting in its manufacturing process. They had developed an alloy train body that would withstand a fall to a concrete floor without breaking. Dorfan was also the first to have &quot;Distance Remote Control&quot;, a reversing unit without a fixed sequence. Dorfan is also noted as one of the first to have passenger figures visible in coach windows. However, being the pioneer of something at times has its disadvantages. Dorfan&#x27;s alloys suffered from impurities, which weakened the metal and caused the trains to disintegrate over time, an early victim of zinc pest. Dorfan replaced the damaged parts, but at great expense. Dorfan was also unique in its approach of building model trains that could be easily disassembled and reassembled, encouraging its customers to take the trains apart and learn how they worked (McKenney, 1993; Dorfan, pp. 166–167).

At its peak, Dorfan had about 150 employees, but the Great Depression crippled the company and was not able to recover. It ended production in 1934, although old inventory was sold at least until 1936 (McKenney 1993; Dorfan, pp. 165–166).

Because of the inevitable deterioration of the engine castings, limited numbers of Dorfan trains survive today, making them among the highly sought after models by collectors.

Some of the Dorfan tooling was later used by Unique Art to make its tinplate trains in the early 1950s (McKenney, 1993; Dorfan, pp. 166).

<text>Gravity Probe A (GP-A) was a space-based experiment to test the equivalence principle, a feature of Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity. It was performed jointly by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The experiment sent a hydrogen masera highly accurate frequency standardinto space to measure with high precision the rate at which time passes in a weaker gravitational field. Masses cause distortions in spacetime, which leads to the effects of length contraction and time dilation, both predicted results of Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity. Because of the bending of spacetime, an observer on Earth (in a lower gravitational potential) should measure a slower rate at which time passes than an observer that is higher in altitude (at higher gravitational potential). This effect is known as gravitational time dilation.

The experiment was a test of a major consequence of Einstein&#x27;s general relativity, the equivalence principle. The equivalence principle states that a reference frame in a uniform gravitational field is indistinguishable from a reference frame that is under uniform acceleration. Further, the equivalence principle predicts that phenomenon of different time flow rates, present in a uniformly accelerating reference frame, will also be present in a stationary reference frame that is in a uniform gravitational field.

The probe was launched on June 18, 1976 from the NASA-Wallops Flight Center in Wallops Island, Virginia. The probe was carried via a Scout rocket, and attained a height of , while remaining in space for 1 hour and 55 minutes, as intended. It returned to Earth by splashing down into the Atlantic Ocean.

==Background==
The objective of the Gravity Probe A experiment was to test the validity of the equivalence principle. The equivalence principle is a key component of Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity, and states that the laws of physics are the same in an accelerating reference frame as they are in a reference frame that is acted upon by a uniform gravitational field.

===Equivalence principle===

The equivalence principle can be understood by comparing a rocket ship in two scenarios. First, imagine a rocket ship that is at rest on the Earth&#x27;s surface; objects dropped within the rocket ship will fall towards the floor with an acceleration of . Now, imagine a distant rocket ship that has escaped Earth&#x27;s gravitational field and is accelerating at a constant due to thrust from its rockets; objects in the rocket ship that are unconstrained will move towards the floor with an acceleration of . This example shows one way that a uniformly accelerating reference frame is indistinguishable from a gravitational reference frame.

Furthermore, the equivalence principle postulates that phenomena that are caused by inertial effects will also be present due to gravitational effects. Consider a beam of light that is shined horizontally across a rocket ship, which is accelerating. According to a non-accelerating observer outside the rocket ship, the floor of the rocket ship accelerates towards the light beam. Therefore, the light beam does not seem to travel on a horizontal path according to the inside observer, rather the light ray appears to bend toward the floor. This is an example of an inertial effect that causes light to bend. The equivalence principle states that this inertial phenomenon will occur in a gravitational reference frame as well. Indeed, the phenomenon of gravitational lensing states that matter can bend light, and this phenomenon has been observed by the Hubble Space Telescope, and other experiments.

===Time dilation===

Time dilation refers to the expansion or contraction in the rate at which time passes, and was the subject of the Gravity Probe A experiment. Under Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity, matter distorts the surrounding spacetime. This distortion causes time to pass more slowly in the vicinity of a massive object, compared to the rate experienced by a distant observer. The Schwarzschild metric, surrounding a spherically symmetric gravitating body, has a smaller coefficient at formula_1 closer to the body, which means slower rate of time flow there. 

There is a similar idea of time dilation occurrence in Einstein&#x27;s theory of special relativity (which involves neither gravity nor the idea of curved spacetime). Such time dilation appears in the Rindler coordinates, attached to a uniformly accelerating particle in a flat spacetime. Such a particle would observe time passing faster on the side it is accelerating towards and more slowly on the opposite side. From this apparent variance in time, Einstein inferred that change in velocity affects the relativity of simultaneity for the particle. Einstein&#x27;s equivalence principle generalizes this analogy, stating that an accelerating reference frame is locally indistinguishable from an inertial reference frame with a gravity force acting upon it. In this way, the Gravity Probe A was a test of the equivalence principle, matching the observations in the inertial reference frame (of special relativity) of the Earth&#x27;s surface affected by gravity, with the predictions of special relativity for the same frame treated as being accelerating upwards with respect to free fall reference, which can thought of being inertial and gravity-less.

==Experimental setup==
The Gravity Probe A spacecraft housed an atomic hydrogen maser system. Maser is an acronym for microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation, and is similar to a laser, as it produces coherent electromagnetic waves in the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum. A hydrogen maser produces a very accurate signal (1.42 billion cycles per second), which is highly stableto one part in a quadrillion (). This is equivalent to a clock that drifts by less than two seconds every 100 million years. A microwave signal derived from the maser frequency was transmitted to the ground throughout the mission. The one-way signal received from the rocket was relativistically Doppler shifted due to the speed of the rocket and in addition was gravitationally Doppler blue-shifted by a minute amount.

In addition to the hydrogen maser carried by the rocket, another hydrogen maser on the ground was used as a source for continuous transmission of a microwave signal to the rocket. A microwave transponder carried on the rocket returned the signal to the Earth. On the way up, the signal received by the rocket was Doppler shifted due to the speed of the rocket and was gravitationally red-shifted by a minute amount. The transponder signal received on the ground was Doppler shifted due to the speed of the rocket and was gravitationally blue-shifted by the same amount that it was red-shifted on the way up. Since the gravitational Doppler shift of the signals on the way up always exactly cancelled the gravitational Doppler shift on its way down, the two-way Doppler shift of the signal received on the ground depended only on the speed of the rocket. 

In a microwave frequency mixer, one-half of the two-way Doppler shift from the transponded ground maser signal was subtracted from the Doppler shift of the space maser. In this way, the Doppler shift due to the spacecraft&#x27;s motion was completely cancelled out, leaving only the gravitational component of the Doppler shift. 

The probe was launched nearly vertically upward to cause a large change in the gravitational potential, reaching a height of . At this height, general relativity predicted a clock should run 4.5 parts in faster than one on the Earth, or about one second every 73 years. The maser oscillations represented the ticks of a clock, and by measuring the frequency of the maser as it changed elevation, the effects of gravitational time dilation were detected.

==Results==
The goal of the experiment was to measure the rate at which time passes in a higher gravitational potential, so to test this the maser in the probe was compared to a similar maser that remained on Earth. Before the two clock rates could be compared, the Doppler shift was subtracted from the clock rate measured by the maser that was sent into space, to correct for the relative motion between the observers on Earth and the motion of the probe. The two clock rates were then compared and further compared against the theoretical predictions of how the two clock rates should differ. The stability of the maser permitted measurement of changes in the rate of the maser of 1 part in for a 100-second measurement.

The experiment was thus able to test the equivalence principle. Gravity Probe A confirmed the prediction that deeper in the gravity well, the flow of time is slower, and the observed effects matched the predicted effects to an accuracy of about 70 parts per million.

<text>George Carlyle Marler, (September 14, 1901 – April 10, 1981) was a politician, notary and philatelist in Quebec, Canada.

==Education==
Born in Montreal, Quebec, Marler studied at Selwyn House School, Bishop&#x27;s College School, Royal Naval College of Canada and McGill University, where he earned a bachelor of civil law degree.

==City Councillor==
Marler served as city councillor from 1940 to 1947 and as Deputy Chairman of Montreal Executive Committee in Montreal.

==Member of the legislature==
Marler successfully ran as a Liberal candidate in the provincial district of Westmount–Saint-Georges in a by-election held on March 23, 1942. He was re-elected in the 1944, 1948 and 1952 elections.

==Leader of the Opposition==
In the 1948 election, Liberal Leader Adélard Godbout lost re-election in the district of L&#x27;Islet. Marler took over as Leader of the Official Opposition. Godbout resigned as Liberal Leader on July 22, 1949. At the 1950 Quebec Liberal Party leadership convention, Marler declined nomination, and Georges-Émile Lapalme became the new party leader on May 20, 1950. However, Lapalme failed to win a seat in the legislature in the 1952 election, so Marler continued as Leader of the Opposition until Lapalme won a by-election in 1953.

==Member of the Federal Cabinet==
Marler resigned from the legislature on June 30, 1954, and was appointed to the federal cabinet of Louis Saint-Laurent as minister of transport. Later that year he won a by-election and became the Member of Pariliament for the federal district of Saint-Antoine—Westmount. He was re-elected in the 1957, but was defeated in 1958.

==Legislative Councillor==
Marler was appointed Minister without Portfolio in the Cabinet of Jean Lesage in October 1960. A month later, he was appointed to the Legislative Council of Quebec.

==Death==
Marler died on April 10, 1981, in Montreal.

<text>Philipp Jakob Cretzschmar (11 June 1786 – 4 May 1845) was a German physician and natural scientist.

Cretzschmar was born at Sulzbach and studied medicine at the University of Würzburg. He taught anatomy and zoology at the Senckenberg Medical Institute of Frankfurt.

Cretzschmar was the founder and second director of the Senckenberg Natural History Society in 1817. One of the founding members of the society was Eduard Rüppell, and the two men collaborated in publishing the results of Rüppell&#x27;s explorations in Africa. The &quot;Atlas zu der Reise im nördlichen Afrika&quot; (&quot;Atlas of Rüppell&#x27;s Travels in Northern Africa&quot;; 1826–31) included an ornithological section by Cretzschmar describing around thirty new species, including Meyer&#x27;s parrot, Nubian bustard, Goliath heron, streaked scrub warbler and Cretzschmar&#x27;s bunting. In the field of mammalogy, he is the binomial author of the scimitar-horned oryx and Soemmerring&#x27;s gazelle.

<text>Lord Howe Island (; formerly Lord Howe&#x27;s Island; Norfuk: Lord Howe Ailen) is an irregularly crescent-shaped volcanic remnant in the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand, part of the Australian state of New South Wales. It lies directly east of mainland Port Macquarie, northeast of Sydney, and about southwest of Norfolk Island. It is about long and between wide with an area of , though just of that comprise the low-lying developed part of the island. The island is named after Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe.

Along the west coast is a sandy semi-enclosed sheltered coral reef lagoon. Most of the population lives in the north, while the south is dominated by forested hills rising to the highest point on the island, Mount Gower (). The Lord Howe Island Group comprises 28 islands, islets, and rocks. Apart from Lord Howe Island itself, the most notable of these is the volcanic and uninhabited Ball&#x27;s Pyramid about to the southeast of Howe. To the north lies the Admiralty Group, a cluster of seven uninhabited islets.

The first reported sighting of Lord Howe Island took place on 17 February 1788, when Lieutenant Henry Lidgbird Ball, commander of the Armed Tender HMS &quot;Supply&quot;, was en route from Botany Bay to found a penal settlement on Norfolk Island. On the return journey, Ball sent a party ashore on Lord Howe Island to claim it as a British possession. It subsequently became a provisioning port for the whaling industry, and was permanently settled in June 1834. When whaling declined, the 1880s saw the beginning of the worldwide export of the endemic kentia palms, which remains a key component of the island&#x27;s economy. The other continuing industry, tourism, began after World War II ended in 1945.

The Lord Howe Island Group is part of the state of New South Wales and is regarded legally as an unincorporated area administered by the Lord Howe Island Board, which reports to the New South Wales Minister for Environment and Heritage. The island&#x27;s standard time zone is UTC+10:30, or UTC+11 when daylight saving time applies. The currency is the Australian dollar. Commuter airlines provide flights to Sydney, Brisbane, and Port Macquarie.

UNESCO records the Lord Howe Island Group as a World Heritage Site of global natural significance. Most of the island is virtually untouched forest, with many of the plants and animals found nowhere else in the world. Other natural attractions include the diversity of the landscapes, the variety of upper mantle and oceanic basalts, the world&#x27;s southernmost barrier coral reef, nesting seabirds, and the rich historical and cultural heritage. The Lord Howe Island Act 1981 established a &quot;Permanent Park Preserve&quot; (covering about 70% of the island). The island was added to the Australian National Heritage List on 21 May 2007 and the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The surrounding waters are a protected region designated the Lord Howe Island Marine Park.

==Bioregion==
Lord Howe Island is part of the IBRA region Pacific Subtropical Islands (code PSI) and is subregion PSI01 with an area of . In the WWF ecoregion system, Lord Howe Island constitutes the entirety of the &#x27;Lord Howe Island subtropical forests&#x27; ecoregion (WWF ID#AA0109). This ecoregion is in the Australasian realm, and the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome. The WWF ecoregion has an area of 14 km2 (5½ sq. mi.)

==History==

===Prehistory===
Before European discovery and settlement, Lord Howe Island apparently was uninhabited, and unknown to Polynesian peoples of the South Pacific. No evidence to suggest prehistoric human activity has ever been found on Lord Howe Island, even after an extensive archaeological investigation in 1996. In &quot;Australian Archaeology&quot; Atholl Anderson concluded in 2003 that, &quot;the case for no pre-European settlement on Lord Howe Island is now more compelling than before&quot; and that &quot;the absence of pre-European settlement on Lord Howe Island is not easily explained. At 16 km2 (6¼ sq. mi.) it is twice the size of Pitcairn Island and half the size of Norfolk Island, two other remote subtropical islands that were inhabited prehistorically, and it had a biota very similar to that of Norfolk Island.&quot;

===1788–1834: First European visits===

The first reported sighting of Lord Howe Island was on 17 February 1788 by Lieutenant Henry Lidgbird Ball, commander of the Armed Tender (the oldest and smallest of the First Fleet ships), which was on its way from Botany Bay with a cargo of nine male and six female convicts to found a penal settlement on Norfolk Island. On the return journey of 13 March 1788, Ball observed Ball&#x27;s Pyramid and sent a party ashore on Lord Howe Island to claim it as a British possession. Numerous turtles and tame birds were captured and returned to Sydney. Ball named Mount Lidgbird and Ball&#x27;s Pyramid after himself and the main island after Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe, who was First Lord of the Admiralty at the time.

A drawing made in May 1788 by Arthur Bowes Smyth who was the surgeon aboard , a ship of the First Fleet heading for China on its return trip to England.
Many names on the island date from this time, and also from May of the same year, when four ships of the First Fleet, , , &quot;Lady Penrhyn&quot; and , visited it. Much of the plant and animal life was first recorded in the journals and diaries of visitors such as David Blackburn, Master of &quot;Supply&quot;, and Arthur Bowes Smyth, surgeon of the &quot;Lady Penrhyn&quot;.

Smyth was in Sydney when the &quot;Supply&quot; returned from the first voyage to Norfolk Island. His journal entry for 19 March 1788 noted that:

&quot;...the &quot;Supply&quot;, in her return, landed at the island she [discovered] in going out, and all were very agreeably surprised to find great numbers of a fine turtle on the beach and, on the land amongst the trees, great numbers of fowls very like a guinea hen, and another species of fowl not unlike the landrail in England, and all so perfectly tame that you could frequently take hold of them with your hands but could, at all times, knock down as many as you thought proper, with a short stick. Inside the reef also there were fish innumerable, which were so easily taken with a hook and line as to be able to catch a boat full in a short time. She brought thirteen large turtles to Port Jackson and many were distributed among the camp and fleet.&quot;

Watercolour sketches of native birds including the Lord Howe woodhen, white swamphen and Lord Howe pigeon were made by artists including George Raper and John Hunter. As the latter two birds were soon hunted to extinction, these paintings are their only remaining pictorial record. Over the next three years, the &quot;Supply&quot; returned to the island several times in search of turtles, and the island was also visited by ships of the Second and Third Fleets. Between 1789 and 1791, the Pacific whale industry was born with British and American whaling ships chasing sperm whales along the equator to the Gilbert and Ellice archipelago, then south into Australian and New Zealand waters. The American fleet numbered 675 ships and Lord Howe was located in a region known as the Middle Ground noted for sperm whales and southern right whales.

The island was subsequently visited by many governments and whaling ships sailing between New South Wales and Norfolk Island and across the Pacific, including many from the American whaling fleet, so its reputation as a provisioning port preceded settlement, with some ships leaving goats and pigs on the island as food for future visitors. Between July and October 1791, the Third Fleet ships arrived at Sydney and within days, the deck work was being reconstructed for a future in the lucrative whaling industry. Whale oil was to become Australia&#x27;s most profitable export until the 1830s, and the whaling industry shaped Lord Howe Island&#x27;s early history.

===1834–1841: Settlement===

Permanent settlement on Lord Howe was established in June 1834, when the British whaling barque &quot;Caroline&quot;, sailing from New Zealand and commanded by Captain John Blinkenthorpe, landed at what is now known as Blinky Beach. They left three men, George Ashdown, James Bishop, and Chapman, who was employed by a Sydney whaling firm to establish a supply station. The men were initially to provide meat by fishing and by raising pigs and goats from feral stock. They landed with (or acquired from a visiting ship) their Māori wives and two Māori boys. Huts were built in an area now known as Old Settlement, which had a supply of fresh water, and a garden was established west of Blinky Beach.

The settlers bartered their stores of water, wood, vegetables, meat, fish, and bird feathers for clothes, tea, sugar, tools, tobacco, and other commodities not available on the island, but it was the whalers&#x27; valuation that had to be accepted. These first settlers eventually left the island when they were bought out for £350 in September 1841 by businessmen Owen Poole and Richard Dawson (later joined by John Foulis), whose employees and others then settled on the island.

===1842–1860: Trading provisions===
The new business was advertised and ships trading between Sydney and the New Hebrides (Vanuatu) would also be put into the island. &quot;Rover&#x27;s Bride&quot;, a small cutter, became the first regular trading vessel. Between 1839 and 1859, five to 12 ships made landfall each year, occasionally closer to 20, with seven or eight at a time laying off the reef. In 1842 and 1844, the first children were born on the island. Then in 1847, Poole, Dawson, and Foulis, bitter at failing to obtain a land lease from the New South Wales government, abandoned the settlement although three of their employees remained. One family, the Andrews, after finding some onions on the beach in 1848, cultivated them as the &quot;Lord Howe red onion&quot;, which was popular in the Southern Hemisphere for about 30 years until the crop was attacked by smut disease.

In 1849, just 11 people were living on the island, but soon the island farms expanded. In the 1850s, gold was discovered on mainland Australia, where crews would abandon their ships, preferring to dig for gold than risk their lives at sea. As a consequence, many vessels avoided the mainland and Lord Howe Island experienced an increasing trade, which peaked between 1855 and 1857. In 1851, about 16 people were living on the island. Vegetable crops now included potatoes, carrots, maize, pumpkin, taro, watermelon, and even grapes, passionfruit, and coffee. Between 1851 and 1853, several aborted proposals were made by the NSW government to establish a penal settlement on the island.

From 1851 to 1854, Henry Denham captain of HMS &quot;Herald&quot;, which was on a scientific expedition to the southwest Pacific (1852–1856), completed the island&#x27;s first hydrographic survey. On board were three Scottish biologists, William Milne (a gardener-botanist from the Edinburgh Botanic Garden), John MacGillivray (naturalist) who collected fish and plant specimens, and assistant surgeon and zoologist Denis Macdonald. Together, these men established much basic information on the island&#x27;s geology, flora, and fauna.

Around 1853, a further three settlers arrived on the American whaling barque &quot;Belle&quot;, captained by Ichabod Handy. George Campbell (who died in 1856) and Jack Brian (who left the island in 1854) arrived, and the third, Nathan Thompson, brought three women (called Botanga, Bogoroo, and a girl named Bogue) from the Gilbert Islands. When his first wife Botanga died, he then married Bogue. Thompson was the first resident to build a substantial house in the 1860s from mainland cedar washed up on the beach. Most of the residents with island ancestors have blood relations or are connected by marriage to Thompson and his second wife Bogue.

In 1855, the island was officially designated as part of New South Wales by the Constitution Act.

===1861–1890: Scientific expeditions===
From the early 1860s, whaling declined rapidly with the increasing use of petroleum, the onset of the California Gold Rush, and the American Civil War—with unfortunate consequences for the people of the island. To explore alternative means of income, Thompson, in 1867, purchased the &quot;Sylph&quot;, which was the first local vessel to trade with Sydney (mainly pigs and onions). It anchored in deep water at what is now Sylph&#x27;s Hole off Old Settlement Beach but was eventually tragically lost at sea in 1873, which added to the woes of the island at that time.

In 1869, the island was visited by magistrate P. Cloete aboard the &quot;Thetis&quot; investigating a possible murder. He was accompanied by Charles Moore, director of the Botanic Gardens in Sydney, and his assistant William Carron, who forwarded plant specimens to Ferdinand von Mueller at the botanic gardens in Melbourne, who by 1875, had catalogued and published 195 species. Also on the ship was William Fitzgerald, a surveyor, and Mr. Masters from the Australian Museum. Together, they surveyed the island with the findings published in 1870 when the population was listed as 35 people, their 13 houses built of split palm battens thatched on the roof and sides with palm leaves. Around this time, a downturn of trade began with the demise of the whaling industry, and sometimes six to 12 months passed without a vessel calling. The older families lost interest in market gardening with the provisions rotting in the storehouses.

From 1860 to 1872, 43 ships had collected provisions, but from 1873 to 1887, fewer than a dozen had done so. This prompted some activity from the mainland. In 1876, a government report on the island was submitted by surveyor William Fitzgerald based on a visit in the same year. He suggested that coffee be grown, but the kentia palm was already catching world attention. In 1878, the island was declared a forest reserve and Captain Richard Armstrong became the first resident government administrator. He encouraged schools, tree-planting, and the palm trade, dynamited the north passage to the lagoon, and built roads. He also managed to upset the residents, and parliamentarian Bowie Wilson was sent from the mainland in April 1882 to investigate the situation. With Wilson was a team of scientists who included H. Wilkinson from the Mines Department, W. Condor from the Survey Department, J. Duff from the Sydney Botanical Gardens, and A. Morton from the Australian Museum. J. Sharkey from the Government Printing Office took the earliest known photographs of the island and its residents. A full account of the island appeared in the report from this visit, which recommended that Armstrong be replaced. Meanwhile, the population had increased considerably and included 29 children; the report recommended that a schoolmaster be appointed. This study sealed a lasting relationship with three scientific organisations, the Australian Museum, Sydney Royal Botanic Gardens, and Kew Royal Botanic Gardens.

===1890–1999===
In 1883, the company Burns Philp started a regular shipping service and the number of tourists gradually increased. By 1932, with the regular tourist run of SS &quot;Morinda&quot;, tourism became the second-largest source of external income after palm sales to Europe. &quot;Morinda&quot; was replaced by in 1932, and she in turn by other vessels. The service continues into the present day with the fortnightly Island Trader service from Port Macquarie.

The palm trade began in the 1880s when the lowland kentia palm (&quot;Howea forsteriana&quot;) was first exported to Britain, Europe, and America, but the trade was only placed on a firm financial footing when the Lord Howe Island Kentia Palm Nursery was formed in 1906 (see below).

The first plane to appear on the island was in 1931, when Francis Chichester alighted on the lagoon in a de Havilland Gipsy Moth converted into a floatplane. It was damaged there in an overnight storm, but repaired with the assistance of islanders and then took off successfully nine weeks later for a flight to Sydney. After World War II, in 1947, tourists arrived on Catalina and then four-engined Sandringham flying boats of Ansett Flying Boat Services operating out of Rose Bay, Sydney, and landing on the lagoon, the journey taking about 3½ hours. When Lord Howe Island Airport was completed in 1974, the seaplanes were eventually replaced with QantasLink twin-engined turboprop Dash 8–200 aircraft.

In 1990, Lance Knight the master of the island&#x27;s supply ship &quot;Sitka&quot; called a meeting in the town hall to propose the formation of an island owned shipping service. 
Lance set off around the world to find a ship and whilst in South-East Asia made one of the most well-known surf discoveries of all time at Lance&#x27;s Right on the island of Sipora in the Mentawai Islands of Indonesia.
Lance eventually returned to the island with its now iconic ship, the MV &quot;Island Trader&quot;.

===21st century===
In 2002, the Royal Navy destroyer struck Wolf Rock, a reef at Lord Howe Island, and almost sank. In recent times, tourism has increased and the government of New South Wales has been increasingly involved with issues of conservation.

On 17 October 2011, the supply ship M/V &quot;Island Trader&quot;, carrying 20 tonnes of fuel, ran aground in the lagoon. The ship refloated at high tide with no loss of crew or cargo.

The 2016 film &quot;The Shallows&quot; starring Blake Lively was largely filmed on the island.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in New South Wales, a public health order was issued on 22 March 2020 that declared Lord Howe Island a public risk area and directed restricted access. As of that date there were no known cases of COVID-19 on the Island.

One of the most contentious issues amongst islanders in the 21st century is what to do about the rodent situation. Rodents have only been on the island since the ran aground in 1918, and have wiped out several endemic bird species and were thought to have done the same to the Lord Howe Island stick insect. A plan in 2016 was made to drop 42 tonnes of rat bait across the island, but the community was heavily divided.

The island was due to be declared rodent-free in October 2021, two years after the last live rat was found, but a living male and pregnant female were discovered in April 2021. As of October 2023, the island is considered rat free. The eradication, contrary to many community reservations, has seen birds, insects, and plants flourish at levels not seen in decades.

==Demographics==
As at the 2016 census, the resident population was 382 people, and the number of tourists was not allowed to exceed 400. Early settlers were European and American whalers and many of their offspring have remained on the island for more than six generations. Residents now work in the kentia palm industry, tourism, retail, some fishing, and farming. In 1876 on Sundays, games and labour were suspended, but no religious services were held. Nowadays, the area known locally as Church Paddock has Anglican, Roman Catholic, and Adventist churches, the religious affiliations on the island being 30% Anglican, 22% no religion, 18% Catholic and 12% Seventh Day Adventist. The ratio of the sexes is roughly equal, with 47% of the population in the age group 25–54 and 92% holding Australian citizenship.

==Governance and land tenure==

Official control of Lord Howe Island lay initially with the British Crown until it passed to New South Wales in 1855, although, until at least 1876, the islanders lived in &quot;a relatively harmonious and self-regulating community&quot;. In 1878, Richard Armstrong was appointed administrator when the NSW Parliament declared the island a forest reserve, but as a result of ill feeling, and an enquiry, he was eventually removed from office on 31 May 1882 (he returned later that year though to view the transit of Venus from present-day Transit Hill). After his removal, the island was administered by four successive magistrates until 1913, when a Sydney-based board was formed; in 1948, a resident superintendent was appointed. In 1913, the three-man Lord Howe Island Board of Control was established, mostly to regulate the palm seed industry, but also administering the affairs of the island from Sydney until the present Lord Howe Island Board was set up in 1954.

The Lord Howe Island Board is an NSW Statutory Authority established under the Lord Howe Island Act 1953, to administer the island as part of the state of New South Wales. It reports directly to the state&#x27;s Minister for Environment and Heritage and is responsible for the island&#x27;s care, control, and management. Its duties include the protection of World Heritage values; the control of development; the administration of Crown Land, including the island&#x27;s protected area; provision of community services and infrastructure; and regulating sustainable tourism. In 1981, the Lord Howe Island Amendment Act gave islanders the administrative power of three members on a five-member board. The board also manages the Lord Howe Island kentia palm nursery, which together with tourism, provides the island&#x27;s only source of external income. Under an amendment bill in 2004, the board now comprises seven members, four of whom are elected from the islander community, thus giving about 350 permanent residents a high level of autonomy. The remaining three members are appointed by the minister to represent the interests of business, tourism, and conservation. The full board meets on the island every three months, while the day-to-day affairs of the island are managed by the board&#x27;s administration, with a permanent staff that had increased to 22 people by 1988.

Land tenure has been an issue since the first settlement, as island residents repeatedly requested freehold title or an absolute gift of cultivated land. Original settlers were squatters. The granting of a lease to Richard Armstrong in 1878 drew complaints, and a few short-term leases (&quot;permissive occupancies&quot;) were granted. In 1913, with the appointment of a board of control, permissive occupancies were revoked and the board itself given permissive occupancy of the island. Then the Lord Howe Island Act 1953 made all land the property of the Crown. Direct descendants of islanders with permissive occupancies in 1913 were granted perpetual leases on blocks up to for residential purposes. Short-term special leases were granted for larger areas used for agriculture, so in 1955, 55 perpetual leases and 43 special leases were granted. The 1981 amendment to the act extended political and land rights to all residents of 10 years or more. An active debate exists concerning the proportion of residents with tenure and the degree of influence on the board of resident islanders about long-term planning for visitors, and issues relating to the environment, amenities, and global heritage.

===Parliamentary representation===
====New South Wales====
As a dependency of the Colony of New South Wales, Lord Howe Island was not represented in parliament until the 1894 New South Wales colonial election following the passage of the &quot;Parliamentary Electorates and Elections Act, 1893&quot;. Since 1894, Lord Howe Island has been included in the following New South Wales Legislative Assembly districts:

As part of the redistribution of electoral districts for the 2023 state election, a proposal was received to move Lord Howe Island back into the electorate of Sydney. However, the NSW Electoral Commission eventually decided to retain the island within the electorate of Port Macquarie.

====Commonwealth====
Since 1901, Lord Howe Island has been included in the following Australian House of Representatives electoral divisions:

==Economy==
===Kentia palm industry===
The first exporter of palm seeds was Ned King, a mountain guide for the Fitzgerald surveys of 1869 and 1876, who sent seed to the Sydney Botanic Gardens. Overseas trade began in the 1880s, when one of the four palms endemic to the island, the kentia palm (&quot;Howea forsteriana&quot;), which grows naturally in the lowlands, was found to be ideally suited to the fashionable conservatories of the well-to-do in Britain, Europe, and the United States. The assistance of mainland magistrate, Frank Farnell, was needed to put the business on a sound commercial footing when in 1906, he became company director of the Lord Howe Island Kentia Palm Nursery, whose shareholders included 21 islanders and a Sydney-based seed company. However, the formation of the Lord Howe Island Board of Control was needed in 1913 to resolve outstanding issues.

The kentia palm (known locally as the thatch palm, as it was used to roof the houses of the early settlers) is popular worldwide as a decorative palm that grows well both outdoors (in sufficiently warm climates) and indoors; the mild climate of the island has led to the evolution of a palm that can tolerate low light, a dry atmosphere, and lowish temperatures — ideal for indoor conditions, particularly in higher-end venues such as hotel lobbies, galleries and large foyers where their high price (thanks to their relative rarity) is no disincentive to their use. Up until the 1980s, the palms were only sold as seed but from then onwards only as high-quality seedlings. The nursery received certification in 1997 for its high-quality management complying with the requirements of Australian Standard AS/NZS ISO 9002.

Seed is gathered from both natural forests and plantations, most collectors being descendants of the original settlers. The seed is then germinated in soilless media and sealed from the atmosphere to prevent contamination. After testing, seedlings are picked, washed (bare-rooted), sanitized, and certified, then packed and sealed into insulated containers for export. Nursery profits, in turn, are used in projects that enhance the island&#x27;s ecosystems. The nursery plans to expand the business to include the curly palm (&quot;Howea belmoreana&quot;) and other native plants of special interest.

By the late 1980s, annual exports had begun to provide a revenue of over A$2 million, constituting the only major industry on the island apart from tourism.

===Tourism===

Lord Howe Island is known for its geology, birds, plants, and marine life. Popular tourist activities include scuba diving, birdwatching, snorkelling, surfing, kayaking, and fishing. To relieve pressure on the small island environment, only 400 tourists are permitted at any one time. The island is reached by plane from Sydney Airport or Brisbane Airport to Lord Howe Island Airport in less than two hours. The Permanent Park Preserve declared in 1981 has similar management guidelines to a national park.
====Facilities====
With fewer than 800 people on the island at any time, facilities are limited; they include a bakery, butcher, general store, liquor store, restaurants, post office, museum, and information centre, a police officer, a ranger, and an ATM at the bowling club. Stores are shipped to the island fortnightly by the &quot;Island Trader&quot; from Port Macquarie. The island has a small four-bed hospital and dispensary. A small botanic garden displays labelled local plants in its grounds. Most electricity is supplied by 1.3 MW solar power and 3.7 MWh battery at 240 volts AC, complemented by diesel generators. No public transport or mobile phone coverage is available, but public telephones, fax facilities, and internet access are, as well as a local radio station and newsletter, &quot;The Signal&quot;.

Tourist accommodation ranges from luxury lodges to apartments and villa units. The currency is the Australian dollar, and there are two banks. No camping facilities are on the island and remote-area camping is not permitted. To protect the fragile environment of Ball&#x27;s Pyramid (which carries the last remaining wild population of the endangered Lord Howe Island stick insect), recreational climbing there is prohibited. No pets are allowed without permission from the board. Islanders use tanked rainwater, supplemented by bore water for showers and washing clothes.

====Activities====
As distances to sites of interest are short, cycling is the main means of transport on the island. Tourist activities include golf (9-hole), lawn bowls, tennis, fishing (including deep-sea game fishing), yachting, windsurfing, kitesurfing, kayaking, and boat trips (including glass-bottom tours of the lagoon). Swimming, snorkelling, and scuba diving are also popular in the lagoon, as well as off Tenth of June Island, a small rocky outcrop in the Admiralty group where an underwater plateau drops to reveal extensive gorgonia and black corals growing on the vertical walls. Other diving sites are found off Ball&#x27;s Pyramid, away, where trenches, caves, and volcanic drop-offs occur.

Bushwalking, natural history tours, talks, and guided walks take place along the many tracks, the most challenging being the eight-hour guided hike to the top of Mount Gower. The island has 11 beaches, and hand-feeding the kingfish (&quot;Seriola lalandi&quot;) and large wrasse at Ned&#x27;s Beach is very popular. Walking tracks cover the island with difficulty graded from 1–5, they include—in the north: Transit Hill 2-hour return, ; Clear Place, 1– to 2-hour return; Stevens Reserve; North Bay, 4-hour return, ; Mount Eliza; Old Gulch, 20-minute return, ; Malabar Hill and Kims Lookout, 3 or 5-hour return, and—in the south: Goat House Cave, 5-hour return, ; Mount Gower, 8-hour return, ; Rocky Run and Boat Harbour; Intermediate Hill, 45-minute return, ; and Little Island, 40-minute return, . Recreational climbers must obtain permission from the Lord Howe Island Board.

==Geography==
Lord Howe Island is an irregularly crescent-shaped volcanic remnant in the southwest Pacific Ocean. Lying in the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand, the island is east of mainland Port Macquarie, northeast of Sydney, and about from Norfolk Island to its northeast. The island is about long and between wide with an area of . Along the west coast is a semienclosed, sheltered coral reef lagoon with white sand, the most accessible of the island&#x27;s 11 beaches.
Both the north and south sections of the island are the high ground of the relatively untouched forest, in the south comprising two volcanic mountains, Mount Lidgbird () and Mount Gower which, rising to , is the highest point on the island. The two mountains are separated by the saddle at the head of Erskine Valley. In the north, where most of the population lives, high points are Malabar () and Mount Eliza (). Between these two uplands is an area of cleared lowland with some farming, an airstrip, and housing.

The Lord Howe Island Group of islands comprises 28 islands, islets, and rocks. Apart from Lord Howe Island itself, the most notable of these is the pointed rocky islet Balls Pyramid, a eroded volcano about to the southeast, which is uninhabited by humans but bird-colonised. It contains the only known wild population of the Lord Howe Island stick insect, formerly thought to be extinct. To the north is the Admiralty Group, a cluster of seven small, uninhabited islands. Just off the east coast is Mutton Bird Island, and in the lagoon is the Blackburn (Rabbit) Island.

===Geological origins===

Lord Howe Island is the highly eroded remains of a 7-million-year-old shield volcano, the product of eruptions that lasted for about 500,000 years. It is one of a chain of islands that occur on the western rim of an undersea shelf, the Lord Howe Rise, which is long and wide extending from New Zealand to the west of New Caledonia and consisting of continental rocks that separated from the Australian plate 60 to 80 million years ago to form a new crust in the deep Tasman Basin. The shelf is part of Zealandia, a microcontinent nearly half the size of Australia that gradually submerged after breaking away from the Gondwanan supercontinent. The Lord Howe Seamount Chain is defined by coral-capped guyots stretching to the north of the island for and including the Middleton ( away) and Elizabeth ( away) reefs of the Elizabeth and Middleton Reefs Marine National Park Reserve. This chain of nine volcanic peaks was probably produced by the northward movement of the Australian Plate over a stationary hotspot, so the oldest guyots were the first formed and most northerly as the plate moved northward at a rate of per year (see plate tectonics).

The Lord Howe Seamount Chain is parallel to the Tasmantid Seamount Chain. Because detailed compositional analysis elsewhere has suggested that as well as individual compositional maturation with time within an individual seamount chain, there may be underlying shared mantle plume sources in such parallel chains, this issue has been examined with samples from Lord Howe Island. These samples share certain compositional analysis similarities with the volcanics from Taupo Bank which would be consistent with a common or similar mantle plume source.

===Basalts and calcarenite===
Two periods of volcanic activity produced the major features of the island. The first about 6.9 million years (Mya) ago produced the northern and central hills, while the younger and highly eroded Mount Gower and Mount Lidgbird were produced about 6.3 Mya by successive basalt (an extrusive igneous rock) lava flows that once filled a large volcanic caldera (crater) and can now be seen as horizontal basalt strata on mountain cliffs (at Malabar and Mount Gower) occasionally interspersed with dikes (vertical lava intrusions). Geological pyroclastic remnants of a volcanic eruption can be seen on the Roach Island (where the oldest rocks occur) and Boat Harbour as tuff (ash), breccia (with angular blocks), and agglomerate (rounded &#x27;bombs&#x27;). Offshore on the Lord Howe Rise, water depths reach falling to to the west of the rise. From the dimensions of the rock on which the island stands, the island has been calculated to erode to 1/40th of its original size.

Rocks and land at the foot of these mountains is calcarenite, coral sand, blown inland during the Pleistocene between 130,000 and 20,000 years ago and cemented into stratified layers by water percolation. In this rock are fossils of bird bones and eggs, land and marine snails, and the extinct giant horned turtle (&quot;Meiolania platyceps&quot;) which is not closely related to any living kind of turtle. The crescent of the island protects a coral reef and lagoon; the barrier reef, at 31°30&#x27;S, is the most southerly in the world. Beach sands, rather than consisting of quartz grains derived from granite, as on the mainland, are made of fragments of shell, coral, and coralline algae, together with basalt grains, and basaltic minerals such as black diopside and green olivine. The lowland consists of alluvial soils.

The island continues to erode rapidly and is expected to be fully submerged within 200,000 years, taking an appearance akin to the Middleton and Elizabeth Reefs.

===Climate===
Lord Howe Island has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot; under the Köppen climate classification).

In general, the summers are warm and humid with erratic rainfall, but occasionally heavy, while in winter it is very mild with rainfall more or less uniform. There is a gradual transition from summer to winter conditions and vice versa. Winds are frequent and salt-laden, being moderate easterlies in the summer and fresh to strong westerlies in the winter. July is the windiest month, and the winter months are subject to frequent gales and strong winds. The island has 67.8 clear days, annually.

Storms and occasional cyclones also affect the island. Rainfall records are maintained in the north, where rainfall is less than in the frequently cloud-shrouded mountains of the south. Wide variations in rainfall can occur from year to year. July and August are the coldest months with average minimum temperatures around and no frost. Average maximum temperatures range from in the winter to in the summer. The humidity averages in the 60–70% range year-round, becoming more noticeable on warmer summer days than in the cooler winter months.

The average temperature of the sea ranges from in July, August, and September to in March.

==Flora and fauna==

===Plants===

Lord Howe Island is a distinct terrestrial ecoregion known as the Lord Howe Island subtropical forests. It is part of the Australasian realm and shares many biotic affinities with Australia, New Guinea, and New Caledonia. In geological terms at 7 million years old, Lord Howe Island is relatively young and was never part of any continent, its flora and fauna colonising the island from across the sea, carried by the wind, water, or birds, possibly assisted at a geological time when other islands were exposed, enabling island hopping. Nevertheless, it has been sufficiently remote for long enough to evolve endemic species.
The high degree of endemism is emphasised by the presence of five endemic genera: &quot;Negria&quot;, &quot;Lordhowea&quot;, &quot;Howea&quot;, &quot;Lepidorrhachis&quot;, and &quot;Hedyscepe&quot;. Island plants are similar to those of Norfolk Island, the two islands sharing some endemic species, for example, the critically endangered species of creeping vine &quot;Calystegia affinis&quot;. The combined flora of these two islands is more closely related to that of New Zealand and New Caledonia than to that of Australia. Also, a small but clear link exists with the plants of Vanuatu. The closest mainland affinities are with the vegetation of subtropical southeastern Queensland. A link with Gondwanaland is indicated by the presence of endemic species such as the wedding lily (&quot;Dietes robinsoniana&quot;) whose only living relatives occur in South Africa.

The flora of the island is relatively untouched, with a large number of rare plants, 44% being endemic to the island. With a diversity of conditions ranging from valleys to ridges, plains, and misty mountain tops, habitat is available for a wide range of plant communities, which have been comprehensively analysed and mapped. Many of the island&#x27;s unique plants grow on or around the mountain summits, where the height has allowed the development of a true cloud forest and many different microhabitats, from sea level to the summits. With the increased humidity brought by the clouds on Mount Gower and the other mountain tops, the range of endemic plants include mosses, ferns and flowering plants.

One of the best-known plant genera endemic to Lord Howe Island is &quot;Howea&quot;, an endemic genus of palms (Arecaceae) that are commonly known as kentia palms and are popular houseplants. Mosses include Spiridens muelleri. There are 57 species of ferns, of which 25 are endemic: they are most abundant in the moist environments of the southern island, especially the higher parts of Mount Gower, perhaps the most apparent being the four endemic tree ferns in the genus &quot;Cyathea&quot; that occur on the southern mountains. &quot;Hedyscepe&quot; and &quot;Lepidorrhachis&quot; are the other two palm genera that are also endemic to the island.

Since the rodent eradication program, researchers have observed an increase in the amount of growth and seeds, especially of the &quot;larger, fleshy, fruited plants&quot;, previously eaten by rats. As the understorey grows thicker, this in turn will provide habitat for small animals such as snails and insects, which in turn provide food for the birds.

====Communities and special plants====

Plant communities have been classified into nine categories: lowland subtropical rainforest, submontane rainforest, cloud-forest and scrub, lowland swamp forest, mangrove scrub and seagrass, coastal scrub and cliff vegetation, inland scrub and herbland, offshore island vegetation, shoreline and beach vegetation, and disturbed vegetation.
Several plants are immediately evident to the visitor. Banyan (&quot;Ficus macrophylla&quot; subsp. &quot;columnaris&quot;) is a remarkable tree with a buttressed trunk and pendulous aerial roots; it can be seen on the track to Clear Place and near Ned&#x27;s Beach. Pandanus tree (&quot;Pandanus forsteri&quot;) has spectacular teepee-like prop roots and pineapple-like fruits that are orange-red when mature, the tough leaves being used for basketry. It occurs in damp areas such as creek beds, and fine specimens can be seen along the Boat Harbour track. Ten species of orchids are on the island, the most noticeable being the bush orchid (&quot;Dendrobium macropus &quot;subsp.&quot; howeanum&quot;) on lowland trees and rocks, bearing cream flowers from August to September. Other prominent flowering plants in the summer include, on the mountain slopes, the whiskery red flowers of mountain rose (&quot;Metrosideros nervulosa&quot; and &quot;Metrosideros sclerocarpa&quot;), the massed, small, yellow flowers of corokia (&quot;Corokia carpodetoides&quot;), orange, plump flowers of pumpkin tree (&quot;Negria rhabdothamnoides&quot;), and white spikes of Fitzgerald tree (&quot;Dracophyllum fitzgeraldii&quot;). The kava bush has large, aromatic, heart-shaped leaves. After heavy rain, the endemic glowing mushroom &quot;Mycena chlorophanos&quot;, and &quot;Omphalotus nidiformis&quot;, can be found in the palm forests.

The palms are the signature plants of the island as the kentia and curly palms especially dominate the landscape in many places, the kentia being of special economic importance. All four species are endemic to the island, often occurring in dense, pure stands, the one that has proved such a worldwide success as an indoor plant being the kentia or thatch palm (&quot;Howea forsteriana&quot;). This is a lowland palm with drooping leaflets and seed branches in &#x27;hands&#x27; of three to five, while the curly palm (&quot;H. belmoreana&quot;), which occurs on slightly higher ground, has upwardly directed leaflets and solitary &#x27;hands&#x27;. Natural hybrids between these species occur on the island and a mature specimen of one is growing in the island nursery. On the mountain sides higher than about 350 m, the big mountain palm (&quot;Hedyscepe canterburyana&quot;) occurs; it has large, golf ball-sized fruits, while the little mountain palm (&quot;Lepidorrhachis mooreana&quot;) has marble-sized fruits and is only found on the mountain summits.

===Animals===
No snakes nor poisonous or venomous animals or plants occur, and no dangerous daytime sharks are found off the beaches, although tiger sharks have been reported on the cliff side of the island.

====Birds====

A total of 202 different birds have been recorded on the island. Eighteen species of land birds breed on the island and many more migratory species occur on the island and its adjacent islets, many tame enough that humans can get quite close. The island has been identified by BirdLife International as an endemic bird area, and the Permanent Park Preserve as an important bird area because it supports the entire population of Lord Howe woodhens, most of the breeding population of providence petrels, over 1% of the world population of another five seabird species, and the whole populations of three endemic subspecies.

Fourteen species of seabirds breed on the island. Red-tailed tropicbirds can be seen in large numbers circling the Malabar cliffs, where they perform acrobatic courting rituals. Between August and May, thousands of flesh-footed and wedge-tailed shearwaters return to the island at dusk each day. From the Little Island Track between March and November, one of the world&#x27;s rarest birds, the providence petrel, also performs courtship displays during winter breeding, and it is extremely tame. The island was its only breeding location for many years after the breeding colony on Norfolk Island was exterminated in the late 19th century, though a small population persists on the adjacent Phillip Island. The Kermadec petrel was discovered breeding on Mount Gower in 1914 by ornithologist Roy Bell while collecting specimens for Gregory Mathews and the black-winged petrel was only confirmed as a breeder in 1971; its numbers have increased following the elimination of feral cats from the island.

The flesh-footed shearwater, which breeds in large numbers on the main island in spring-autumn, once had its chicks harvested for food by the islanders. The wedge-tailed and little shearwaters breed on the main island and surrounding islets, though only a small number of the latter species can be found on the main island. Breeding white-bellied storm petrels was another discovery by Roy Bell. Masked boobies are the largest seabirds breeding on Lord Howe and can be seen nesting and gliding along the sea cliffs at Mutton Bird Point all year round. Sooty terns can be seen on the main island at Ned&#x27;s and Middle Beaches, North Bay, and Blinkey Beach; the most numerous of the island&#x27;s breeding seabirds, their eggs were formerly harvested for food. Common and black noddies build nests in trees and bushes, while white terns lay their single eggs precariously in a slight depression on a tree branch, and grey ternlets lay their eggs in cliff hollows.

Three endemic passerine subspecies are the Lord Howe golden whistler, Lord Howe silvereye, and Lord Howe currawong. The iconic endemic rail, the flightless Lord Howe woodhen, is the only surviving member of its genus; its ancestors could fly, but with no predators and plenty of food on the island, this ability was lost. This made it easy prey for islanders and feral animals, so by the 1970s, the population was less than 30 birds. From 1978 to 1984, feral animals were removed and birds were raised in captivity to be successfully reintroduced to the wild. The population is now relatively safe and stable.

Domestic Mallards have colonised Lord Howe Island from New Zealand. They have replaced the Pacific Black Duck through competition and introgressive hybridisation.

====Mammals, reptiles and amphibians====

Only one native mammal remains on the islands, the large forest bat. The endemic Lord Howe long-eared bat is known only from a skull and is now presumed extinct, possibly the result of the introduction of ship rats.

Two terrestrial reptiles are native to the island group: the Lord Howe Island skink and the Lord Howe Island gecko. Both are rare on the main island, but more common on smaller islands offshore. The garden skink and the bleating tree frog have been accidentally introduced from the Australian mainland. During the Pleistocene the giant terrestrial horned turtle &quot;Meiolania platyceps&quot; was endemic to the island, but this is currently thought to have gone extinct before human occupation as a result of postglacial sea-level rise.

====Invertebrates====
The Lord Howe stick insect disappeared from the main island soon after the accidental introduction of rats when the SS &quot;Makambo&quot; ran aground near Ned&#x27;s Beach on 15 June 1918. In 2001, a tiny population was discovered in a single &quot;Melaleuca howeana&quot; shrub on the slopes of Ball&#x27;s Pyramid, has been successfully bred in captivity, and is nearing re-introduction to the main island. The Lord Howe stag beetle is a colourful endemic beetle seen during summers. Another endemic invertebrate, the Lord Howe flax snail (or Lord Howe &quot;Placostylus&quot;), has also been affected by the introduction of rats. Once common, the species is now endangered and a captive-breeding program is underway to save the snail from extinction. An endemic species that is likely to have become extinct due to human-introduced rats was the large rove beetle &quot;Hesperus gigas&quot; (Lea, 1929) comb. nov. (formerly &quot;Cafius gigas&quot; Lea, 1929) (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae). The Lord Howe Island wood-feeding cockroach was thought extirpated from the island until a small population was found.

====Marine life====

Marine environments are near-pristine with a mixture of temperate, subtropical, and tropical species derived from cool-temperate ocean currents in the winter and the warm East Australian Current, which flows from the Great Barrier Reef, in summer. Of the 490 fish species recorded, 13 are endemic and 60% are tropical. The main angling fish are yellowtail kingfish and New Zealand bluefish, while game fish include marlin, tuna, and giant kingfish called &quot;greenbacks&quot;. Over 80 species of corals occur in the reefs surrounding the islands. Australian underwater photographer Neville Coleman has photographed various nudibranchs at Lord Howe Island.

Various species of cetaceans inhabit or migrate through the waters in the vicinity, but very little about their biology in the area is known due to a lack of studies and sighting efforts caused by locational conditions. Bottlenose dolphins are the most commonly observed and are the only species confirmed to be seasonal or yearly residents, while some other dolphin species have also been observed. Humpback whales are the only large whales showing slow but steady recoveries as their numbers annually migrating past the island of Lord Howe are much smaller than those migrating along the Australian continent.

Historically, migratory whales such as blue, fin, and sei whales were very abundant in the island waters but were severely reduced in numbers to near-extinction by commercial and illegal hunts, including the mass illegal hunts by the Soviet Union and Japan in the 1960s to 1970s. Southern right and sperm whales were most severely hunted among these, hence the area was called the Middle Ground by whalers. These two were likely once seasonal residents around the island, where right whales prefer sheltered, very shallow bays, while sperm whales mainly inhabit deep waters.

===Conservation===

About 10% of Lord Howe Island&#x27;s forests have been cleared for agriculture, and another 20% has been disturbed, mostly by domestic cattle and feral sheep, goats, and pigs. As a result, 70% of the island remains relatively untouched, with a variety of plants and animals, many of which are endemic, and some of which are rare or threatened. Two species of plants, nine terrestrial birds, one bat, and at least four invertebrates have become extinct since 1778. Endemism at the generic level includes the palms &quot;Howea&quot;, &quot;Hedyscepe&quot; and &quot;Lepidorrhachis&quot;, a woody daisy &quot;Lordhowea insularis&quot;, the tree &quot;Negria&quot;, the leech &quot;Quantenobdella howensis&quot;, three annelid worm genera (&quot;Paraplutellus&quot;, &quot;Pericryptodrilus&quot; and &quot;Eastoniella&quot;), an isopod shrimp &quot;Stigmops&quot;, a hemipteran bug &quot;Howeria&quot;, and a cricket &quot;Howeta&quot;.

The Lord Howe Island Board instigated an extensive biological and environmental survey (published in 1974), which has guided the island conservation program. A group of scientists including director of the Australian Museum, Frank Talbot, and others from the Royal Botanic Gardens, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, and the CSIRO undertook an environmental survey of the island in 1970, reporting on environmental degradation there. 

In 1981, the Lord Howe Island Amendment Act proclaimed a &quot;Permanent Park Preserve&quot; over the north and south ends of the island. Administration of the preserve was outlined in a management plan for the sustainable development of the island prepared by the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, which has a ranger stationed on the island. The island was cited under the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1982.

Offshore environmental assets are protected by the Lord Howe Island Marine Park. This consists of a state marine park managed by the Marine Parks Authority of New South Wales in the waters out to three nautical miles around the island and including Ball&#x27;s Pyramid. It also includes a Commonwealth Marine Park extending from 3 to 12 nautical miles out and managed by the federal Department of the Environment and Heritage. In total the Marine Park covers about .

====Feral animals and plants====
Pigs and goats were released on the island as potential food sources in the early 1800s; the goats destroyed shrubs and grasses used as nesting sites and the pigs ate eggs and chicks and disturbed the land by rooting for food. Several birds have become extinct on the island since the arrival of humans. The first round of extinctions included the Lord Howe swamphen or white gallinule, the white-throated pigeon, the red-crowned parakeet, and the Tasman booby, which were eliminated by visitors and settlers during the 19th century, either from overhunting for food or protection of crops. Black rats were released from provisioning whaling ships in the 1840s and mice from Norfolk Island in 1860. In 1918, the black rat was accidentally introduced with the shipwreck of the S.S. &quot;Makambo&quot;, which ran aground at Ned&#x27;s Beach. This triggered a second wave of extinctions, including the vinous-tinted thrush, the robust white-eye, the Lord Howe starling, the Lord Howe fantail and the Lord Howe gerygone, as well as the destruction of the native phasmid and the decimation of palm fruits. Bounties were offered for rats and pig tails and &#x27;ratting&#x27; became a popular pursuit. Subsequent poisoning programs have kept populations low. The Lord Howe boobook may have become extinct through predation by, or competition with, the Tasmanian masked owls, which were introduced in the 1920s in a failed attempt to control the rat population. Stray dogs are also a threat, as they could harm the native woodhen and other birds.

Invasive plants such as Crofton weed and Formosa lily occur in inaccessible areas and probably cannot be eradicated, but others are currently being managed. In 1995, the first action was taken to control the spread of introduced plants on the island, chiefly ground asparagus and bridal creeper, but also cherry guava, Madeira vine, &quot;Cotoneaster&quot;, &quot;Ochna&quot;, and &quot;Cestrum&quot;. This has been followed by weeding tours and the formation of the Friends of Lord Howe Island group in 2000. Programs have also been started to remove weeds from private properties and re-vegetate some formerly cultivated areas. An environmental unit was created by the board and it includes a flora management officer and a permanent weed officer. Weeds have been mapped and an eradication program is in place, supported by improved education and quarantine procedures.

Introduced species that harmed Lord Howe&#x27;s native flora and fauna, namely feral pigs, cats, and goats, were eradicated by the early 2000s.

In July 2012, the Australian federal Environment Minister Tony Burke and the New South Wales Environment Minister Robyn Parker announced that the Australian and New South Wales governments would each contribute 50% of the estimated A$9 million cost of implementing a rodent eradication plan for the island, using the aerial deployment of poison baits. The plan was put to a local vote and is considered controversial. Around 230 woodhens were captured before the rodent eradication commenced in early 2019. Following the successful eradication of the rodents, all woodhens and currawongs were released across the island in late 2019 and early 2020.

A recovery program has restored the Lord Howe woodhen&#x27;s numbers from only 20 in 1970 to about 200 in 2000, which is close to carrying capacity.

====Climate change====
According to an analysis by eminent Australian academic Tim Flannery, the ecosystem of Lord Howe Island is threatened by climate change and global warming, with the reefs at risk from rises in water temperature. The first international conference on global artificial photosynthesis as a climate-change solution occurred at Lord Howe Island in 2011, the papers being published by the &quot;Australian Journal of Chemistry&quot;.

== Heritage listings ==
The Lord Howe Islands Group was inscribed on the World Heritage List for its unique landforms and biota, its diverse and largely intact ecosystems, its natural beauty, and its habitats for threatened species. It also has significant cultural heritage associations in the history of NSW.

Lord Howe Island and adjacent islets, Admiralty Islands, Mutton Bird Islands, Ball&#x27;s Pyramid, and associated coral reefs and marine environs were added to the Australian National Heritage List on 21 May 2007, based on the World Heritage List.

Lord Howe Island was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

In September 2019 it was revealed that, in 2017, federal environment minister Josh Frydenberg overruled a recommendation from his department to install two wind turbines. The project, which would have substantially reduced the island&#x27;s dependence on diesel-powered electricity generators, had been considered not to endanger the island&#x27;s heritage status and was supported by the islanders.

<doc id="531385" wikidata="Q1114042" url="?curid=531385" title="Lee wave">
<text>In meteorology, lee waves are atmospheric stationary waves. The most common form is mountain waves, which are atmospheric internal gravity waves. These were discovered in 1933 by two German glider pilots, Hans Deutschmann and Wolf Hirth, above the Giant Mountains.
They are periodic changes of atmospheric pressure, temperature and orthometric height in a current of air caused by vertical displacement, for example orographic lift when the wind blows over a mountain or mountain range. They can also be caused by the surface wind blowing over an escarpment or plateau, or even by upper winds deflected over a thermal updraft or cloud street.

The vertical motion forces periodic changes in speed and direction of the air within this air current. They always occur in groups on the lee side of the terrain that triggers them. Sometimes, mountain waves can help to enhance precipitation amounts downwind of mountain ranges. Usually a turbulent vortex, with its axis of rotation parallel to the mountain range, is generated around the first trough; this is called a rotor. The strongest lee waves are produced when the lapse rate shows a stable layer above the obstruction, with an unstable layer above and below.

Strong winds (with wind gusts over ) can be created in the foothills of large mountain ranges by mountain waves. These strong winds can contribute to unexpected wildfire growth and spread (including the 2016 Great Smoky Mountains wildfires when sparks from a wildfire in the Smoky Mountains were blown into the Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge areas).

== Basic theory ==

Lee waves are a form of internal gravity waves produced when a stable, stratified flow is forced over an obstacle. This disturbance elevates air parcels above their level of neutral buoyancy. Buoyancy restoring forces therefore act to excite a vertical oscillation of the perturbed air parcels at the Brunt-Väisäla frequency, which for the atmosphere is:

formula_1, where formula_2 is the vertical profile of potential temperature.

Oscillations tilted off the vertical axis at an angle of formula_3 will occur at a lower frequency of formula_4. These air parcel oscillations occur in concert, parallel to the wave fronts (lines of constant phase). These wave fronts represent extrema in the perturbed pressure field (i.e., lines of lowest and highest pressure), while the areas between wave fronts represent extrema in the perturbed buoyancy field (i.e., areas most rapidly gaining or losing buoyancy).

Energy is transmitted along the wave fronts (parallel to air parcel oscillations), which is the direction of the wave group velocity. In contrast, the phase propagation (or phase speed) of the waves points perpendicular to energy transmission (or group velocity).

==Clouds==
Both lee waves and the rotor may be indicated by specific wave cloud formations if there is sufficient moisture in the atmosphere, and sufficient vertical displacement to cool the air to the dew point. Waves may also form in dry air without cloud markers. Wave clouds do not move downwind as clouds usually do, but remain fixed in position relative to the obstruction that forms them.

* Around the crest of the wave, adiabatic expansion cooling can form a cloud in shape of a lens (lenticularis). Multiple lenticular clouds can be stacked on top of each other if there are alternating layers of relatively dry and moist air aloft.
* The rotor may generate cumulus or cumulus fractus in its upwelling portion, also known as a &quot;roll cloud&quot;. The rotor cloud looks like a line of cumulus. It forms on the lee side and parallel to the ridge line. Its base is near the height of the mountain peak, though the top can extend well above the peak and can merge with the lenticular clouds above. Rotor clouds have ragged leeward edges and are dangerously turbulent.
* A foehn wall cloud may exist at the lee side of the mountains, however this is not a reliable indication of the presence of lee waves.
* A pileus or cap cloud, similar to a lenticular cloud, may form above the mountain or cumulus cloud generating the wave.
* Adiabatic compression heating in the trough of each wave oscillation may also evaporate cumulus or stratus clouds in the airmass, creating a &quot;wave window&quot; or &quot;Foehn gap&quot;.

==Aviation==

Lee waves provide a possibility for gliders to gain altitude or fly long distances when soaring. World record wave flight performances for speed, distance or altitude have been made in the lee of the Sierra Nevada, Alps, Patagonic Andes, and Southern Alps mountain ranges. The Perlan Project is working to demonstrate the viability of climbing above the tropopause in an unpowered glider using lee waves, making the transition into stratospheric standing waves. They did this for the first time on August 30, 2006 in Argentina, climbing to an altitude of . The Mountain Wave Project of the Organisation Scientifique et Technique du Vol à Voile focusses on analysis and classification of lee waves and associated rotors.

The conditions favoring strong lee waves suitable for soaring are:

* A gradual increase in windspeed with altitude
* Wind direction within 30° of perpendicular to the mountain ridgeline
* Strong low-altitude winds in a stable atmosphere
* Ridgetop winds of at least 20 knots

The rotor turbulence may be harmful for other small aircraft such as balloons, hang gliders and paragliders. It can even be a hazard for large aircraft; the phenomenon is believed responsible for many aviation accidents and incidents, including the in-flight breakup of BOAC Flight 911, a Boeing 707, near Mount Fuji, Japan in 1966, and the in-flight separation of an engine on an Evergreen International Airlines Boeing 747 cargo jet near Anchorage, Alaska in 1993.

The rising air of the wave, which allows gliders to climb to great heights, can also result in high-altitude upset in jet aircraft trying to maintain level cruising flight in lee waves. Rising, descending or turbulent air, in or above the lee waves, can cause overspeed, stall or loss of control.

==Other varieties of atmospheric waves==
There are a variety of distinctive types of waves which form under different atmospheric conditions.

* &quot;Wind shear&quot; can also create waves. This occurs when an atmospheric inversion separates two layers with a marked difference in wind direction. If the wind encounters distortions in the inversion layer caused by thermals coming up from below, it will create significant shear waves in the lee of the distortions that can be used for soaring.

* &quot;Hydraulic jump induced waves&quot; are a type of wave that forms when there exists a lower layer of air which is dense, yet thin relative to the size of the mountain. After flowing over the mountain, a type of shock wave forms at the trough of the flow, and a sharp vertical discontinuity called the hydraulic jump forms which can be several times higher than the mountain. The hydraulic jump is similar to a rotor in that it is very turbulent, yet it is not as spatially localized as a rotor. The hydraulic jump itself acts as an obstruction for the stable layer of air moving above it, thereby triggering wave. Hydraulic jumps can be distinguished by their towering roll clouds, and have been observed on the Sierra Nevada range as well as mountain ranges in southern California.
* &quot;Hydrostatic waves&quot; are vertically propagating waves which form over spatially large obstructions. In hydrostatic equilibrium, the pressure of a fluid can depend only on altitude, not on horizontal displacement. Hydrostatic waves get their name from the fact that they approximately obey the laws of hydrostatics, i.e. pressure amplitudes vary primarily in the vertical direction instead of the horizontal. Whereas conventional, non-hydrostatic waves are characterized by horizontal undulations of lift and sink, largely independent of altitude, hydrostatic waves are characterized by undulations of lift and sink at different altitudes over the same ground position.
* &quot;Kelvin–Helmholtz instability&quot; can occur when velocity shear is present within a continuous fluid or when there is sufficient velocity difference across the interface between two fluids.
* &quot;Rossby waves&quot; (or planetary waves) are large-scale motions in the atmosphere whose restoring force is the variation in Coriolis effect with latitude.

<text>Heinrich Wilhelm Schott (7 January 1794 – 5 March 1865) was an Austrian botanist. He is known for his extensive work on aroids (Araceae). 

==Biography==
Schott was born on 7 January 1794 in Brno, Moravia. He studied botany, agriculture and chemistry at the University of Vienna, where he was a pupil of Joseph Franz von Jacquin (1766–1839). He was a participant in the Austrian Brazil Expedition from 1817 to 1821. In 1828 he was appointed &quot;Hofgärtner&quot; (royal gardener) in Vienna, later serving as director of the Imperial Gardens at Schönbrunn Palace (1845). In 1852 he was in charge of transforming part of palace gardens in the fashion of an English garden. He also enriched the Viennese court gardens with his collections from Brazil. He was also interested in Alpine flora, and was responsible for development of the alpinum at Belvedere Palace in Vienna.

In 2008, botanists P.C.Boyce &amp; S.Y.Wong published &quot;Schottarum&quot;, a genus of flowering plants from Borneo belonging to the family Araceae. Then they published &quot;Schottariella&quot;, a monotypic genus of flowering plants from Borneo belonging to the family Araceae, both genera were named in honour of Heinrich Wilhelm Schott.

Schott died on 5 March 1865 at Schönbrunn Palace, Vienna, at the age of 71.

<doc id="531394" wikidata="Q284790" url="?curid=531394" title="Jefferson River">
<text>The Jefferson River is a tributary of the Missouri River, approximately long, in the U.S. state of Montana. The Jefferson River and the Madison River form the official beginning of the Missouri at Missouri Headwaters State Park near Three Forks. It is joined downstream (northeast) by the Gallatin.

From broad valleys to a narrow canyon, the Jefferson River passes through a region of significant geological diversity, with some of the oldest and youngest rocks of North America and a diversity of igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary formations.

The region was only intermittently inhabited by Native Americans until relatively recent times, and no single tribe had exclusive use of the Jefferson River when the Lewis and Clark Expedition first ascended the river in 1805. Today, the Jefferson River retains much of its scenic beauty and wildlife diversity from the days of Lewis and Clark, yet is threatened by water use issues and encroaching development. The Jefferson is a segment of the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail, administered by the National Park Service.

==Course==

From the Rocky Mountains of southwestern Montana, three small rivers converge to form the headwaters of the Jefferson River. The longest begins at Brower&#x27;s Spring, 9,030 feet (2,750 m) above sea level, on the northern flank of the Centennial Mountains. The site is marked by a pile of rocks. The water flows west then north as Hell Roaring Creek before merging with Rock Creek and flowing west through Upper and Lower Red Rock Lakes. Here it becomes the Red Rock River, flowing west through Lima Reservoir and then northwest into Clark Canyon Reservoir near Dillon. Below the dam, the river is known as the Beaverhead River. It is joined by the Ruby River above the town of Twin Bridges and converges with the Big Hole River to form the Jefferson about two miles downstream from town.

The Jefferson River flows north through the Jefferson Valley towards Whitehall and then east, where it is joined by the Boulder River before passing through the narrow Jefferson River canyon near Lewis and Clark Caverns State Park. After the canyon, the river passes into a broad valley again near Willow Creek. The Jefferson converges with the Madison River at Missouri Headwaters State Park near Three Forks to form the Missouri River, joined a short distance downstream by the Gallatin River.

After flowing into the Missouri, its waters continue into the Mississippi River, eventually into the Gulf of Mexico. These rivers combine to be the fourth longest river on Earth.

The geology of the Jefferson River and the surrounding mountain ranges includes some of the oldest rocks found in North America, dating back to the Archean Eon, 2.7 billion years ago. Found primarily in the Tobacco Root and Ruby ranges, these ancient rocks are metamorphic, having been highly compressed and nearly re-melted by geologic forces over eons of time. Frequently found along the Jefferson River, these rocks include layered feldspars, gneiss, glassy quartz, heavy dark amphibolite, and sometimes marble.

About a billion years ago, the Willow Creek Fault, north of the Jefferson River canyon, dropped down deeply and filled with seawater, stretching north to Alberta and British Columbia. Eventually, the sea receded and erosion wore away intervening geologic history until about 530 million years ago, during the Cambrian Period of the Paleozoic Era.

A new sea encroached on the land, depositing sedimentary layers of limestone, dolomite, shale, and sandstone over several hundred million years. Limestone is generally made of calcium from marine animals that have been compacted and cemented together. Dolomite is similar but has more magnesium. Shale is formed from fine-grained mud, silts, and clays that have been compacted and cemented together. The sandstone is made up of quartz and feldspar.

By the Mississippian Period, 340 million years ago, much of western North America was covered with a warm, shallow sea, much like the Gulf Coast of Florida today. Small marine fossils can be found in the Madison Group limestone that makes up the steep, narrow section of the Jefferson River canyon today.

Gentle uplift eventually raised the region above sea level again. Rainwater percolated down through cracks in the limestone, dissolving rock and creating caves such as those found at Lewis and Clark Caverns State Park.

Local mountains, such as the Tobacco Roots were formed from the Boulder Batholith. The batholith is composed of at least seven, and possibly as many as fourteen, discrete igneous rock masses called plutons, which formed beneath the Earth&#x27;s surface during a period of magma intrusion about 73 to 78 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous. The rising buoyant plutons resulted from subduction along what was then the west coast of North America. Regional uplift brought the deep-seated granite to the surface, where erosion exposed the rocks and the mineral veins they contained. The granite generally consists of quartz, hornblende, and feldspars. Gold, silver, and other semi precious minerals are also associated with batholiths.

The ancient metamorphic and more recent sedimentary layers above the batholiths eroded away as the magma pushed up through the crust. Thus, the granite batholiths are typically found at the center of local mountain ranges, while the much older metamorphic gneiss is usually found lower in the mountains, and limestone layers are mostly found in the foothills nearest the Jefferson River.

The Rocky Mountains began a new and continuing phase of crustal stress 5 to 10 million years ago as tectonic forces began to pull the region apart. Blocks of earth dropped down to form valleys, and the Jefferson River eroded a channel through rock to form the Jefferson River canyon.

==First peoples==

Archaeologists believe that the first Americans migrated across the Bering land bridge from Asia between 12,000 and 30,000 years ago. They followed the Great North Trail, which dipped down into Montana along the east slope of the Rocky Mountains. These Paleo-Indians or Clovis people hunted the now-extinct mammoths and bison with Clovis points. Clovis points dated 12,000 to 13,000 years old have been found along the Missouri River near Townsend, Montana, about forty-five miles beyond the Jefferson. Paleo-Indians seldom entered the Rockies, where glaciation persisted.

Upstream from the Jefferson, at Barton Gulch, a tributary of the Ruby-Jefferson River system, archaeologists excavated an extensive complex of Paleo-Indian cooking pits and earth ovens dated to 9400 RCYBP.

Between 6,000 and 7,000 years ago, climate change brought dramatically drier conditions to the Northern Rockies. It is thought that far fewer animals survived in the region and the native peoples likely migrated elsewhere. Montana was apparently only intermittently inhabited after that until relatively recent times.

In the 1500s, the Kootenai came into Montana from the north. The Salish and Pend d&#x27;Oreille migrated in from the north and northwest, venturing south to the Jefferson River/Missouri Headwaters and eastward. Major population shifts started in the early 1600s, bringing several new tribes into Montana. With horses of Spanish origin, the Shoshone migrated into Montana from the Great Basin and hunted buffalo, becoming the dominant tribe in the area. However, the arrival and expansion of European settlers on the east coast pushed Native Americans west, in a domino effect that extended all the way into Montana. The Crow migrated into Montana from the east in the 1600s, followed by the Blackfeet, Gros Ventre, and Assiniboine in the 1700s. With the acquisition of guns and horses, the Blackfeet became the dominant tribe on the plains in the 1700s. The Shoshone were largely pushed back over the continental divide into Idaho, but still ventured into Montana hunting and foraging. By 1800, the Missouri headwaters and much of southwest Montana was a crossroads frequented by the Lemhi Shoshone, Bannock, Nez Perce, Flathead, Crow, Sioux, and Piegan Blackfeet.

Sacagawea, of the Lemhi Shoshone, was captured by the Hidatsa on the lower Jefferson River in 1800, when she was about twelve years old. She was later married to Toussaint Charbonneau and both of them joined the Lewis and Clark Expedition when Lewis and Clark wintered with the Hidatsa in North Dakota in 1804–05.

==Lewis and Clark Expedition==

Little was known about the American West at the beginning of the nineteenth century. The Missouri River flowed southeast from an unknown source, joining the Mississippi River before flowing south to the Gulf of Mexico. The Columbia River originated at a similar latitude as the Missouri, and flowed west to the Pacific Ocean. What lay in between was the subject of much speculation.

The United States acquired the Missouri River watershed through the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, and President Thomas Jefferson sent Meriwether Lewis and William Clark with a company of men to explore up the Missouri in the hopes of finding a navigable water route to the Pacific, with a low portage connecting one watershed with the other. The Expedition departed from Saint Louis, Missouri in the spring of 1804, ascended the Missouri River that summer, then wintered over with the Hidatsa Indians in North Dakota, where they met Toussaint Charbonneau and his Shoshone wife Sacagawea. Lewis and Clark hired Charbonneau to join the expedition, in part because Sacagawea&#x27;s people were native to the Missouri headwaters. The Lewis and Clark Expedition arrived at the Missouri Headwaters on 27 July 1805.

Of the three streams that make up the headwaters of the Missouri, the eastern fork is the smallest, while the larger middle and western forks are of relatively equal size. Therefore, Lewis and Clark concluded that it would be inappropriate for any fork to retain the name &quot;Missouri.&quot; Instead, they named the western fork the Jefferson, the middle fork as the Madison, and the eastern fork as the Gallatin, as Meriwether Lewis noted in his journal on July 28, 1805:

:&quot;Both Capt. C. and myself in opinion with to the impropriety of calling either of these &quot;[three]&quot; streams the Missouri and accordingly agreed to name them after the President of the United States and the Secretaries of the Treasury and state...&quot;
The expedition rested a couple days at the Missouri headwaters, then began to ascend the Jefferson River, using ropes to pull the dugout canoes upstream against the current. Along the way they hunted deer, elk, bighorn sheep, and encountered grizzly bears. Describing the upper Jefferson River, Lewis recorded on August 2, 1805:

The valley though which our rout of this [day] lay and through which the river winds it&#x27;s meandering course is a beatifull level plain with but little timber and that on the verge of the river. the land is tolerably fertile, consisting of a black or dark yellow loam, and covered with grass from 9 Inches to 2 feet high. The plain ascends gradually on either side of the river to the bases of two ranges of mountains which ly parallel to the river and which terminate 〈it&#x27;s〉 the width of the vally. the tops of these mountains were yet partially covered with snow while we in the valley. were suffocated nearly with the intense heat of the midday sun. the nights are so could that two blankets are not more than sufficient covering.

Arriving at a major confluence, Lewis and Clark named the western fork the Wisdom River, the eastern fork the Philanthropy River and retained the middle fork as a continuation of the Jefferson River. However, none of these names were retained. These rivers are known today as the Big Hole, the Ruby, and the Beaverhead.

The Jefferson River is a segment of the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail, established by Congress in 1978 and administered by the National Park Service.

==Recreation==

The Jefferson River is rated as Class I water for recreational purposes from its origin at the Beaverhead and Big Hole rivers to its confluence with the Missouri at Three Forks. The river is suitable for floaters and beginning paddlers, except during high water flows in the spring. Possible hazards include downed trees, called &quot;sweeps&quot; and diversion dams constructed to channel river water into irrigation ditches. Water levels often drop off by mid-summer, making it necessary to drag watercraft over shallow riffles.

The Jefferson River consists of three distinct sections.

The upper Jefferson is a much-braided, meandering river and floodplain system that supports productive farm fields, extensive cottonwood groves, rich meadows, and abundant wildlife. The river creates diverse habitats as it naturally shifts back and forth across the Jefferson Valley, forming oxbows and swamps of various depth and age. Shifting channels and natural flooding facilitates the germination of cottonwood seedlings. Individual cottonwood groves are often germinated from a single flood event and tend to be of uniform age. The upper Jefferson extends from the confluence of the Big Hole and the Beaverhead rivers approximately 44 miles downstream to the community of Cardwell.

The middle Jefferson enters a narrow canyon a short distance downstream from Cardwell and is largely contained by the geography for most of the next 15 miles downstream to Sappington Bridge. Lacking the ability to flood or meander, this section of the river has few trees, swamps, meadows, and significantly less wildlife than the upper Jefferson.

The lower Jefferson opens up again into a meandering, braided river from Sappington bridge approximately 24 miles downstream to its confluence with the Madison River. Here, the riparian zone again supports an extensive community of swamps, meadows, cottonwood groves, and productive farm lands.

==Environmental Degradation==

Throughout its length, the Jefferson River is used extensively as a source of irrigation water for local farms and ranches. Dams constructed upstream on the Ruby and Beaverhead rivers store surplus water from spring runoff which is released to augment natural flows during the summer irrigation season. However, portions of the river can become severely dewatered, shallow, and warm in drought years, adversely impacting fish populations. The unnaturally warm water, combined with excess nutrients from irrigation runoff and grazing practices, can stimulate rapid growth of algae in mid-summer, to the detriment of anglers and floaters.

On August 5, 2016, the Jefferson River stream flow was measured at only 19 CFS (cubic feet per second). This occurred even while the three main tributaries to the Jefferson were contributing 1140 CFS. The Ruby River was measured at 310 CFS, the Big Hole River was measured at 200 CFS and the Beaverhead River was measured at 630 CFS. Irrigators took over 98% of this stream flow by forcing the river into irrigation channels using diversion dams, leaving less than 2% of water in the river. Montana has no minimum stream flow legislation to prevent the total dewatering of the Jefferson River in the future.

While much of the Jefferson River remains untouched and scenic, it is threatened by new housing developments that incrementally fragment wildlife habitat and vistas along the river. Efforts to stabilize portions of the riverbank with rock, concrete, and other rip-rap materials have inhibited the river&#x27;s ability to flood, meander, and form new cottonwood groves and wildlife habitat. In addition, rip-rapped sections of the river tend to funnel floodwaters downstream, increasing the impact to other landowners.

<text>The Beaverhead River is an approximately tributary of the Jefferson River in southwest Montana (east of the Continental Divide). It drains an area of roughly . The river&#x27;s original headwaters, formed by the confluence of the Red Rock River and Horse Prairie Creek, are now flooded under Clark Canyon Reservoir, which also floods the first of the river. The Beaverhead then flows through a broad valley northward to join the Big Hole River and form the Jefferson River. With the Red Rock River included in its length, the river stretches another , for a total length of , one of the more significant drainages of south-western Montana.

The name of the Beaverhead originates from Beaverhead Rock on the middle river. This rock formation was recognized by Sacajawea when the Lewis and Clark Expedition passed the area in 1805. There were also many beavers in the area at the time, but the name does not originate from the animal. In 1805, Captain Meriwether Lewis traveled up the Jefferson and Beaverhead first, but when the rest of the expedition came, a sign Lewis had left at the confluence of the Beaverhead and Big Hole telling them to follow the Beaverhead had been cut down by a beaver, and the expedition traveled up the Big Hole instead. As a result, the swifter current of the Big Hole swamped two of their canoes before they could travel back down to the confluence.

Together with the Red Rock River, the Beaverhead forms the uppermost headwaters of the Missouri River, the longest tributary of the Mississippi River.

The river is a Class I water from the Clark Canyon Dam to its confluence with the Jefferson River for the purposes of public access for recreational purposes.

<text>Riddley Walker is a science fiction novel by American writer Russell Hoban, first published in 1980. It won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for best science fiction novel in 1982, as well as an Australian Science Fiction Achievement Award in 1983. It was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1981.

It is Hoban&#x27;s best-known adult novel and a drastic departure from his other work, although he continued to explore some of the same themes in other settings.

== Production ==
Hoban began work on the novel in 1974, inspired by the medieval wall painting of the legend of Saint Eustace at Canterbury Cathedral.

== Plot ==
Roughly two thousand years after a nuclear war has devastated civilization, Riddley, the young narrator, stumbles upon efforts to recreate a weapon of the ancient world.

The novel&#x27;s characters live a harsh life in a small area which is presently the English county of Kent, and know little of the world outside of &quot;Inland&quot; (England). Their level of civilization is similar to England&#x27;s prehistoric Iron Age, although they do not produce their own iron but salvage it from ancient machinery. Church and state have combined into one secretive institution, whose mythology, based on misinterpreted stories of the war and an old Catholic saint (Eustace), is enacted in puppet shows.

==Characters==
*Riddley Walker, the 12-year-old protagonist
*Brooder Walker, Riddley&#x27;s father who is known for his &quot;connexions&quot; (prophetic stories) and dies early in the story
*Lorna, the seer/priest in their village
*Abel Goodparley and Erny Orfing, agents of the political-religious government
*Eusa, a religious figure portrayed in puppet form
*Lissener, titled the Ardship of Cambry, one of the mutant &quot;Eusa folk&quot;

== Language ==
One of the most notable features of the book is its unique dialect: an imagined future version of the English language. This language blends puns, phonetic spelling, and colloquialisms, and is influenced by the dialects of East Kent as Hoban heard them before 1980, where the book is set. Professor of English John Mullan praised the novel&#x27;s dialect as an &quot;extraordinary risk&quot; and noted that the language &quot;naturalises the shattered world&quot; of the novel, absorbing and engaging readers. Author Peter Schwenger called the language &quot;quasi-illiterate, largely phonetic,&quot; arguing that it &quot;slows us to the pace of an oral culture.&quot;

Some features include: 

* Technological idioms: &quot;progam&quot; for plan, &quot;gallack seas&quot; for the heavens, &quot;Puter Leat&quot; for the computer elite, &quot;pirntowt&quot; for printout (or conclusion), &quot;the Littl Shyning Man the Addom&quot; for the atom
* Capitalized nouns: &quot;Plomercy&quot; for diplomacy, &quot;Trubba&quot; for trouble, &quot;Master Chaynjis&quot; for changes, or the apocalypse
* Phonetic spelling: &quot;fizzics&quot; for physics, &quot;vackt our wayt&quot; for evacuated, &quot;soar vivers&quot; for survivors
* Place names: &quot;Inland&quot; for England, &quot;Cambry&quot; for Canterbury, &quot;Do It Over&quot; for Dover, &quot;Fork Stoan&quot; for Folkestone
* Titles: &quot;Wes Mincer&quot; for Westminster, &quot;Pry Mincer&quot; for prime minister, &quot;Guvner&quot; for leader, &quot;Ardship of Cambry&quot; for Archbishop of Canterbury
* Colloquialisms: &quot;bye bye hump&quot; for burial mound, &quot;doing the juicy&quot; for sex, &quot;Bad Time&quot; for nuclear armageddon
* Kent dialect: &quot;parbly&quot; for probably, &quot;arnge&quot; for orange, &quot;barms&quot; for bombs

== Critical reception ==

Peter Ruppert noted that Hoban&#x27;s novel draws on &quot;such well-known dystopias as &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;, and &quot;A Canticle for Leibowitz&quot;&quot;, and &quot;what is unique in Hoban&#x27;s haunting vision of the future is his language&quot; which is described as being similar to the &quot;Nadsat&quot; slang spoken in Anthony Burgess&#x27; &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. &quot;The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot; stated that, &quot;The force and beauty and awfulness of Hoban&#x27;s creation is shattering,&quot; and praised the author&#x27;s use of a crude &quot;Chaucerian English&quot;. John Mullan of The Guardian also praised Hoban&#x27;s decision to narrate the novel in a devolved form of English: &quot;The struggle with Riddley&#x27;s language is what makes reading the book so absorbing, so completely possessing.&quot;

&quot;Library Journal&quot; wrote that the book holds &quot;a unique and beloved place among the few after-Armageddon classics&quot;. It was included in David Pringle&#x27;s book &quot;Science Fiction: The 100 Best Novels&quot;. In 1994, American literary critic Harold Bloom included &quot;Riddley Walker&quot; in his list of works comprising the Western Canon.

== Adaptations ==
=== Film and theatre ===
* Robert C. Cumbow wrote in &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; that the post-apocalyptic film &quot;Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome&quot; borrowed &quot;whole ideas, themes and characterizations&quot; from the novel.
* Hoban&#x27;s own theatrical adaptation premiered at the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester, in February 1986. It was directed by Braham Murray and starred David Threlfall. Its U.S. premiere was at the Chocolate Bayou Theatre, in April 1987, directed by Greg Roach.
* In 1989, Russell Hoban gave permission for theatre students at Sir Percival Whitley/Calderdale College, Halifax, West Yorkshire, to transcribe the book into a theatrical script, which was then staged in a new production at The Square Chapel, Halifax.
* In November 2007, the play was produced by Red Kettle in Waterford, Ireland, to positive reviews.
* In 2011, the play was also adapted for Trouble Puppet Theater Co. by artistic director Connor Hopkins at Salvage Vanguard Theater in Austin, Texas. This production employed tabletop puppetry inspired by the Bunraku tradition and was supported by an original score by Justin Sherburn.
* In March 2015, a group of Aberystwyth drama students performed the play in Theatre y Castell over the course of two days. The production was directed by David Ian Rabey.

=== Popular music ===
* &quot;The Rapture of Riddley Walker&quot; is the eighth song on the Clutch album &quot;From Beale Street to Oblivion&quot; (2007).
* &quot;Widder&#x27;s Dump&quot;, named after a location in the book and notes on the credits as being inspired by the novel, is the fifth song on the 1989 &quot;King Swamp&quot; album.
* &quot;In the Heart of the Wood and What I Found There&quot; from the album &quot;Thunder Perfect Mind&quot; by Current 93 features references to Riddley Walker. Another Current 93 song, &quot;The Blue Gates of Death&quot; from the album Earth Covers Earth incorporates a rhyme from the book. Also, their album &quot;Of Ruine or Some Blazing Starre&quot; cites the Saint Eustace story.
* &quot;Ode to Riddley Walker&quot; is the title track of the second solo album by The Owl Service vocalist Diana Collier (2020). The song refers directly to Hoban&#x27;s novel.

<text>Charles Ernest Gault (September 19, 1861 – December 25, 1946) was a politician in Quebec, Canada.

He was born in Montreal, Canada East, and educated at the High School of Montreal.

He was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Quebec in a 1907 by-election in Montréal division no. 5, and was re-elected in 1908. He was elected in Montréal–Saint-Georges in 1912, 1916, 1919, 1923, 1927, 1931, and 1935. He lost in 1936 and retired from politics.

He served as Conservative leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly of Quebec from 1931 to 1932, after Conservative leader Camillien Houde lost the 1931 Quebec election and also failed to win a seat.

On November 7, 1932, the Conservative caucus chose Maurice Duplessis to be leader of the Opposition, replacing Gault. Duplessis was formally elected Conservative Party leader on October 4, 1933. On December 12, 1933, Gault was expelled from the Conservative caucus and sat as an independent. He was re-elected in the 1935 election as a Conservative, but in his unsuccessful election bid in 1936 he ran as an independent Conservative candidate and lost to Gilbert Layton of the Union Nationale, which had been formed from the merger of the now-defunct Conservative Party of Quebec and the short-lived Action libérale nationale.

<text>Waterstones Booksellers Limited, trading as Waterstones (formerly Waterstone&#x27;s), is a British book retailer, owned by US investment group, Elliott Investment Management, that operates 311 shops, mainly in the United Kingdom and other nearby countries. , it employs around 3,500 staff in the UK and Europe. An average-sized Waterstones shop sells a range of approximately 30,000 individual books, as well as stationery and other related products.

Established in 1982 by Tim Waterstone, after whom the company was named, the bookseller expanded rapidly until being sold in 1993 to WHSmith. In 1998, Waterstones was bought by a consortium of Waterstone, EMI and Advent International. The company was taken under the umbrella of HMV Group, which later merged the Dillons and Ottakar&#x27;s brands into the company. Following several poor sets of results for the group, HMV put the chain up for sale. In May 2011, it was announced that A&amp;NN Capital Fund Management, owned by Russian billionaire Alexander Mamut, had bought the chain for £53.5m and appointed James Daunt as managing director. The company is incorporated in England and Wales as Waterstones Booksellers Ltd, with its registered office at 203–206 Piccadilly, London (which is also the location of its flagship shop).

Waterstones also owns Hodges Figgis (the oldest bookshop in Ireland, founded in 1768), Hatchards (the oldest bookshop in the UK, founded in 1797), and Foyles (a chain of seven bookshops in England).

In April 2018, hedge fund Elliott Management Corporation bought a majority stake in the company.

The bookseller has concession agreements with Paperchase and previously with coffee chains Costa Coffee and Starbucks in some shops, but since 2012 has introduced its own Café W brand. For a time, Waterstones sold e-readers, including in 2012 partnering with Amazon to sell the Amazon Kindle, but has since pulled out of this market for commercial reasons.

Waterstones administers and supports various literary awards, including the Children&#x27;s Laureate award and the Waterstones Children&#x27;s Book Prize.

==History and developments==
===Formation &amp; WHSmith: 1982–1998===

The chain was founded in 1982 by Tim Waterstone after he took a £6,000 redundancy payout from WHSmith. He set up his first shop in Old Brompton Road, Kensington with the ambition of creating a &quot;different breed of bookshop&quot;, using techniques he had seen in the United States. He used literary authors in front-of-shop displays and employed highly literate staff.

The model proved successful and the chain set about expanding its shop portfolio. In 1990 WHSmith took a strong minority stake in the chain, and ten years after its birth, by 1992, Waterstone&#x27;s had grown to be the largest bookseller group in Europe. WHSmith then acquired the company in 1993 at an enterprise value of £47m, paying £5.27 a share on 8.1m 10p shares, a 53x multiple for the early-stage investors. Under WHSmith, Waterstones pursued international expansion, opening its first US shop in Boston in 1991, as well as further domestic expansion—opening its 100th UK shop in a former chapel in Reading.

The chain was part of the eventual dismantling of the Net Book Agreement, when in 1991, following a promotion by then-rivals Dillons, the company decided to pursue its own discounting promotion on selected titles. By 1997, the agreement had collapsed and been declared illegal.

===HMV Group: 1998–2011===
Following an attempt by Tim Waterstone in 1997 to buy the entire WHSmith group, WHSmith sold the Waterstones chain for £300 million to HMV Media plc (now HMV Group)—a joint venture between EMI, Advent International and Tim Waterstone. This included high-street brands HMV and rival Dillons, creating an international entertainment retailer. Waterstone was appointed chairman of the group but stood down in 2001, citing &quot;concerns for the way the company was being run&quot;, and was replaced by Alan Giles. A year later, all Dillons shops were rebranded as Waterstones, with some sold to rival Ottakar&#x27;s, making the brand defunct. The chain had also begun pulling out of its US overseas venture.

In 2001, Waterstones launched the &quot;Waterstones Books Quarterly&quot; magazine, containing book reviews and author interviews. In the same year, the booksellers&#x27; online operation, Waterstones.co.uk, was franchised to Amazon.com, with the company expressing a desire &quot;to concentrate on its high street and campus shops&quot;. The move resulted in the loss of 50 jobs. In 2003, Waterstones announced it was supporting Dyslexia Action as its chosen charity, helping to raise awareness and understanding for dyslexia.

In 2006, Giles stepped down from his position and was replaced by Gerry Johnson as managing director of Waterstones and Simon Fox as group CEO. In April 2006, following two bids by Permira for the group, Tim Waterstone attempted to buy back the company from HMV for £256 million, but later withdrew his offer, specifying that the conditions set by HMV were &quot;too punitive&quot; to accept. A strategic review in September saw Waterstones pull out of its franchise agreement with Amazon to re-launch its online business, &quot;Waterstones.com&quot;, independently. The chain also began to pilot a loyalty programme in South-West England and Wales. The scheme was successful, launching nationally as &quot;The Waterstones Card&quot; across its entire shop portfolio.

Waterstones piloted a brand refresh exercise in selected shops, beginning with Manchester&#x27;s Arndale Centre in 2007. On 19 November 2007, the chain closed its first branch on Old Brompton Road. Following a consultation, the company&#x27;s supply chain was overhauled in 2008, with the implementation of a warehouse and distribution centre in Burton-upon-Trent. Existing direct-to-store deliveries from suppliers were replaced by a centralised warehouse capable of receiving merchandise and sorting an estimated 70 million books per year, and 200 staff were made redundant by the process. In September 2008, Waterstones began selling the Sony Reader in an agreement that saw the booksellers&#x27; branches and Sony Centre shops stock the reader exclusively for two weeks after its release. Waterstones.com began to supply e-books in the .epub format. In November 2009, Waterstones moved into second-hand bookselling in a partnership with Alibris setting up an online reselling tool called &quot;Waterstones Marketplace&quot;, part of Waterstones.com.

In January 2010, HMV Group announced that Waterstones like-for-like sales over the Christmas period were down 8.5 per cent on the previous year. This culminated in the resignation of managing director Gerry Johnson, with immediate effect. He was replaced by development director Dominic Myers, who was managing director of the British academic bookselling chain Blackwells until 2005. Myers joined HMV in 2006 to oversee the integration of Ottakar&#x27;s into the chain. In response to the decline in sales, he implemented a three-year plan in which branches were tailored to their local market alongside a &#x27;rejuvenation&#x27; of the company brand and an increase in range. As part of these changes, Waterstones implemented new branding in May 2010, developed by agency VentureThree. The company also moved to support the Rainbow Trust, which provides support to children with life-threatening and terminal illnesses and their families, in the same year.

After an announcement that profits would be at the lower end of analysts&#x27; forecasts due to falling sales and a share price fall of 20%, HMV Group indicated its intention to close a number of Waterstones branches in January 2011. These shop closures, including two in Dublin, Republic of Ireland and nine others across the United Kingdom occurred in February 2011. Further branch closures in Luton, Dorking, Lancaster University, Harrods, Gateshead and Norwich Arcade were completed by the end of 2011.

===Alexander Mamut &amp; James Daunt: 2011–present===

In May 2011, HMV Group announced the sale of Waterstones to A&amp;NN Capital Fund Management, a fund controlled by Russian businessman Alexander Mamut for £53 million. The takeover was welcomed by publishers as &quot;a step forward to re-establishing a proper physical presence&quot;. On 29 June 2011, the sale of Waterstones was completed and approved by the vast majority of shareholders at an emergency general meeting. Mamut appointed James Daunt, founder of Daunt Books, as managing director and, in October 2011, a board of directors was announced, including Miranda Curtis as chairman. In September 2011, the bookseller announced that it intended to drop its 3-for-2 deal on books after a decade. The offer was replaced with a &quot;bespoke offer&quot;, based on branches choosing their own pricing structures from available discounts.

In January 2012, the company announced that it would be moving away from the branding developed in 2010 by agency VentureThree, and reverting to its original logo. This involved the removal of the apostrophe from its name because, James Daunt argued, &quot;Waterstones without an apostrophe is, in a digital world of URLs and email addresses, a more versatile and practical spelling&quot;. This decision received media coverage, in which the company was subject to criticism. John Richards, of the Apostrophe Protection Society, said that the change was &quot;just plain wrong&quot; and &quot;grammatically incorrect&quot; while the move sparked outrage on Twitter, involving debate on whether the move was grammatically incorrect or not. Linguist David Crystal on his blog added: &quot; ... if Waterstone&#x27;s wants to become Waterstones, that&#x27;s up to the firm. It&#x27;s nothing to do with expressing possession or plurality or anything to do with meaning.&quot;

In the same month, Waterstones confirmed plans to open a Russian-language bookshop in its Piccadilly branch, intending to stock 5,000 titles, with the shop being entirely staffed by Russian-speaking booksellers. The concession, named &quot;The Russian Bookshop&quot;, opened in March 2012.
Following a decision in late 2011 to scrap an e-reading offer in-branch, it was announced in May 2012 that Waterstones would be selling the Amazon Kindle across its estate. James Daunt launched the new agreement with Amazon stating that Waterstones would be offering &quot;e-reading services and offer Kindle digital devices&quot; throughout the company&#x27;s branches and on its website, with an intention to &quot;make the Kindle experience better&quot;. This announcement was received with surprise across the book industry as it had been suggested that Waterstones was developing a partnership with Barnes &amp; Noble to launch the Nook in the UK, or that the company was developing its own device, but Daunt &quot;ultimately rejected&quot; other avenues as Waterstones &quot;would have been out of the market&quot; before their implementation.

It was also announced in May 2012 that the company would begin a refurbishment plan, with Mamut &quot;investing tens of millions of pounds&quot; to fund the refit of a planned 100 shops before the end of the year. The plan saw the introduction of wi-fi into shops, reorganisation of shop sections and space dedicated areas for Kindle devices, and a number of own-brand coffee shops called &quot;Café W&quot;. The Café W brand was trialled in the Sutton branch, with an expressed aim for around 130 shops over a three-year period to be fitted with a café. The announcement also noted the introduction of a &quot;click-and-collect&quot; service.

The Amazon Kindle officially launched in-branch in October 2012 with an &quot;outdoor and press advertising campaign&quot; promoting the launch, with the Kindle Fire and Kindle Paperwhite model going on sale for the first time in the UK along with older models. The Kindles were tailored with Waterstones screensavers, which led to some complaints and customers attempting to return their devices. The release of the Kindle coincided with a relaunch of the company&#x27;s brand in the same month, pushing the message that the chain was the &quot;nation&#x27;s leading bookshop&quot; and producing an exclusive anthology, the &quot;Waterstones Red Anthology&quot;, to help promote the shops.

By the end of 2012, the Waterstones estate had shrunk to 288 shops, with &quot;commercial reasons&quot; given for the closure of branches in Bromsgrove, Stevenage, Watford, Fleet Street, High Holborn and Epsom among others, with staff being redeployed where possible. In 2012, Daunt stated that future expansion was being considered, based on the performance of the company. The accounts for the year to 2012 showed Waterstones, prior- and post-acquisition had made losses of £37.3 million.
Started in 2012 was an overhaul of the company&#x27;s business strategy, with centralised decision-making giving way to shop-based decisions and a renewed emphasis on traditional bookselling techniques. Waterstones embarked on a major restructuring of staffing levels, with a company-wide consultation with 560 managerial staff to subsequently reduce roles within the company. This consultation led to Head Office staff departures and around 200 branch and regional managers leaving their posts. Waterstones launched a number of new partnerships through the year, including with the University of Derby to launch a professional qualification programme for its staff, with the Folio Society to extend customer reach and stock selection in London-based bookshops, and partnering with a new charity, BookTrust. By the end of 2013, Waterstones had cut its losses to £12.2 million, opened 12 further Café W outlets, and embarked on a capital investment in its shop portfolio of £29.5 million.

In 2014, they opened new shops in Ringwood, Blackburn and Southwold, its first branch to be without Waterstones branding, as well as closing shops in Eastleigh and St Neots. Continued business strategy change saw further departures from head office in brand communication and PR and a renewed agency contract for Waterstones&#x27; digital marketing with Epiphany. The retailer overhauled its business technology with new algorithms on its website to help personalise the online shopping experience, updated point-of-sale IT and by introducing contactless payment in its shops. The retailer partnered with Airbnb to hold a one-off &quot;sleepover&quot; for customers in its Piccadilly branch in October 2014 after a customer was accidentally trapped in the Trafalgar Square branch after closing. Accounts for 2014 saw operating income losses narrow to £3.8 million, but sales slip by 5.9%.

The ongoing strategic changes made to the way the business operates included the decision in October 2015, after three years on sale in shops, to remove the Kindle from its offer following &quot;pitiful&quot; sales and handing the retail space over to books. This was followed, after a failed attempt to buy BlinkBox books from Tesco in January 2015, with Waterstones announcing it had sold its e-book business to Rakuten Kobo Inc. in May 2016, subsequently directing customers who had purchased e-books through the retailer to access their e-books via Kobo&#x27;s eBook site. This sale represented an exit from the e-book and e-reader market for Waterstones after eight years and multiple platforms.
The company partnered with Oxfam in 2015 to raise £1 million for those impacted by the Syrian civil war crisis through a nationwide campaign called &quot;Buy Books for Syria&quot;. Further changes to shops were made in 2015, with the closure of Wimbledon and Birmingham New Street, the opening of The Rye Bookshop and a return to Welwyn Garden City. The company reported an operating income of £5.4 million and a further narrowing of losses to £4.5 million from £18.8 million the previous year.

In a 2016 interview, Daunt stated that Amazon &quot;defines how Waterstones acts&quot; and while Waterstones could not compete with the internet retailer digitally, it could offer a credible alternative, believing there was &quot;a future in physical bookselling&quot;. Waterstones continued to look at &quot;fixing the basics&quot; during 2016, such as adjusting shop opening hours and harnessing data from the loyalty card as well as the refurbishment of physical shops, including the Canterbury branch, and work on its e-commerce routes through improvements to product ranking. Shops in Oxford Street Plaza, Edinburgh George Street and Reading Oracle were closed, Harpenden Books, Glasgow Fort and Tottenham Court Road were opened and Wimbledon and Watford were reopened in new sites. The newly opened shops benefitted from a refreshed brand look, widely welcomed by the book trade. The retailer renewed its partnership with Oxfam to continue to raise money for the Syrian crisis, donating £5 for each &quot;Book of the Month&quot; sold in-shop during November 2016. Daunt made public his concern that the UK EU referendum was likely to impact on company sales due to an expected retail downturn following a &#x27;no&#x27; vote. He later noted that sales had remained &quot;buoyant&quot; following the decision to leave the European Union, but remained pessimistic for the future.

Accounts show that in the year ending April 2016, Waterstones made its first profit in seven years, of £11.7 million. This included increased profits in Ireland, with sales rising 7% over the year, with the company expressing a desire to open more shops in Ireland. The management board was reduced from seven members to three in August 2016, with the departure of Miranda Curtis and a statement that the future composition was under review. Waterstones announced it had raised £300,000 for BookTrust in three years since partnering, and would continue the partnership for a fourth year.

In April 2018, hedge fund Elliott Management Corporation bought a majority stake in the company, leaving Alexander Mamut&#x27;s Lynwood Investments with a minority holding. The sale completed in early June 2018. Daunt remained as chief executive.

In 2021, an article in &quot;The Bookseller&quot; reported that Waterstones were planning a collaboration with Next to have Waterstones within some Next stores. In April 2022, a new Waterstones within Next in Martlesham, Ipswich, was announced.

In 2022, Waterstones purchased Blackwell&#x27;s, the largest independent bookstore in the UK, for an undisclosed sum. The acquisition was done under US hedge fund Elliott Investment Management.

==Acquisitions==

===Dillons (including Hatchards)===
Acquired in 1995 by the Thorn EMI group, Dillons was the UK&#x27;s second-largest bookseller behind Waterstones and was the bookselling arm of EMI&#x27;s retail division, which included HMV. Dillons had acquired Hatchards. Following the demerger of Thorn and EMI in 1996, the retail arm was divested from the EMI portfolio within a year and spun off into the HMV Media Group, an investment venture between EMI Group and Advent International private equity group. This venture included HMV, Dillons and Waterstones (the latter bought from WHSmith for £300 million), combining to make an international entertainment retailer of more than 500 shops. Following a rebuffed takeover attempt in 1997 of WHSmith, Tim Waterstone became part of the deal and by May 1998, following the £801 million-deal completion became chairman of the group. All Dillons shops were incorporated within the Waterstones brand by 1998.

===Ottakar&#x27;s===

In September 2005, HMV Group began attempts to buy rival book chain Ottakar&#x27;s. This alarmed publishers and authors, who hoped the Office of Fair Trading would refer the takeover bid to the Competition Commission. In March 2006, the Competition Commission cleared Waterstones for takeover of the Ottakar&#x27;s, stating that the takeover would &quot;not result in a substantial lessening of competition&quot;, and is &quot;not likely to affect book prices, range of titles offered or quality of service&quot;. Through extensive research, they also found that &quot;contrary to widespread perception, Waterstones, like Ottakar&#x27;s, operates a book-buying system which mixes central and local input on stock selection.&quot;

On 31 May 2006, Waterstones announced that it had successfully negotiated the takeover of Ottakar&#x27;s. HMV chief executive Alan Giles said: &quot;A combined Waterstones and Ottakar&#x27;s business will create an exciting, quality bookseller, able to respond better to the increasingly competitive pressures of the retail market.&quot; Ottakar&#x27;s chairman Philip Dunne said: &quot;Over the last year the book market has undergone a significant change with new levels of competition from the supermarkets and online retailers impacting all specialist booksellers and in particular those with insufficient scale to compete on equal terms.&quot;

Following the takeover, HMV announced that they would be rebranding every branch of Ottakar&#x27;s as a Waterstones. In July 2006, a conversion programme was initiated and within four months, every Ottakar&#x27;s shop had been relaunched as a Waterstones and had seen the loss of 100 jobs.

===Books Etc===

In August 2008, the now-defunct Borders chain agreed to sell eight Books Etc. shops to Waterstones for an undisclosed sum. The takeover, which represented of retail space and incurred no staff losses, increased Waterstones&#x27; presence within London to almost 50 shops, &quot;crucially [in] areas that are not represented by Waterstones bookshops&quot;. The shops, in Fleet Street, London Wall, Holborn, Wandsworth, Uxbridge, Finchley Road and Canary Wharf, were rebranded and merged into the Waterstones chain by September 2008.

===Foyles===
In September 2018, Waterstones confirmed it would buy 115-year-old Foyles, with seven stores, while retaining the brand. James Daunt said the purchase would help &quot;to protect and champion the pleasures of real bookshops in the face of Amazon&#x27;s siren call&quot;.

=== Blackwell&#x27;s ===
In February 2022, Waterstones acquired Blackwell&#x27;s for an undisclosed sum.

==Controversies ==

===Tax===
Tim Waterstone and James Daunt have been critical of tax avoidance by Amazon.com in the British press. Amazon has received sustained scrutiny for the amount of its overall sales that are reported by its UK subsidiary, in comparison to those &quot;processed offshore in Luxembourg to avoid UK tax&quot;. In the 2012–13 financial year, Amazon paid £3.2 million in tax on sales of £4.2 billion and received £2.5 million in grants from the government. In the same period, it was revealed that Waterstones paid £11.9 million in tax, despite an operating loss of £25.4 million and sales of £410.4 million.

In a report on tax avoidance in the book industry, the magazine Ethical Consumer argued that A&amp;NN Capital Fund Management, Waterstones&#x27; parent company in Bermuda, &quot;likely to be for tax avoidance purposes&quot;. In response to this, Waterstones issued a clarification on their website reading &quot;As a UK registered and domiciled business, Waterstones fulfils all its tax obligations. This will include both the payment and reporting of all necessary UK taxes, as set out under UK tax legislation.&quot; In the 2013–14 financial period, the first full year under A&amp;NN, Waterstones reported sales to Companies House of £398.5 million and an operating loss of £12.2 million.

===Non-branded shops===

Waterstones opened its first non-branded shop in Southwold, Suffolk in July 2014 called Southwold Books. The company decided not to use its branding as it wished to &#x27;fit in&#x27; with the town&#x27;s high proportion of independent retailers, but this move drew anger from local residents at the time as they viewed the move as &quot;dishonest&quot; and said that local shop rents were being increased because of retail chains moving in and this subsequently was &quot;changing the character of the high street&quot;.

Non-branded Waterstones became an issue again in 2016 at a national level, following newspaper reports about not only Southwold Books but two further shops, The Rye Bookshop in Sussex and Harpenden Books in Hertfordshire, being opened and local residents not realising the connection with the retailer. Commentators were split on the ethics of the decision to open unbranded shops, but it was noted that at no point had attempts been made to hide the connection to the retailer. In interviews, James Daunt denied any &quot;subterfuge&quot; and said he wanted for the shops to behave as independent retailers do and have their own identity. He further stated that more unbranded shops were likely to open in the future.

===Environmental impact===
Waterstones has worked with the British Safety Council to consider its environmental impact, including factors beyond its carbon footprint. After a 2008 audit, the Council awarded Waterstones three out of a possible five stars for environmental impact.

=== Real living wage ===
, Waterstones does not pay the &quot;real living wage&quot;, as recommended by the Living Wage Foundation, and a rate significantly higher than the official National Living Wage. More than 1,300 writers backed a campaign to ask Waterstones to pay the &quot;real living wage&quot;. In response Waterstone managing director James Daunt said the company was &quot;simply not profitable enough&quot; and that &quot;there&#x27;s a long gap between wanting to do something and it being remotely sensible&quot;. Waterstones said that only Ikea, Majestic and Lush or other similar large retailers pay the &quot;real living wage&quot;.

==Awards==

Waterstones maintains and supports various literary awards, including the Waterstones Book of the Year, the Waterstones Children&#x27;s Book Prize, the Waterstones Debut Fiction Prize, Waterstones Irish Book of the Year, the Pushkin House Russian Book Prize, and the Waterstones Children&#x27;s Laureate, as well as now-defunct awards including the Waterstones 11 and the Guardian First Book Award. The company has also received various industry and consumer awards.

===Waterstones prizes===

==== Book of the Year ====
The prize, which has been running since 2012, sees booksellers from across the company select a shortlist of books from any category, published at any time, before the winner is chosen by panel.

==== Children&#x27;s Book Prize ====

Waterstones continued the Ottakar&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Book Prize under its own brand and since 2005, the Waterstone&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Book Prize has attempted &quot;to uncover hidden talent in children&#x27;s writing&quot; by awarding authors with no more than two previously published books (adult or children&#x27;s fiction).
Waterstones is also the main sponsor of &quot;The Waterstones Children&#x27;s Laureate&quot;, previously sponsored by Ottakar&#x27;s. The 2011–2013 role saw the position carry the Waterstones branding for the first time, with the company stating it was &#x27;up weighting [its] activity&#x27; and &#x27;supporting the role in shops and online in different ways throughout the year and beyond.&#x27; Holders of the role during sponsorship include Julia Donaldson, Malorie Blackman and the current holder, Chris Riddle.

====Debut Fiction Prize====
The Waterstones Debut Fiction Prize, established in 2022, is an annual literary award presented to the best debut fiction published in the previous 12 months.
====Irish Book of the Year====

====Waterstones 11====

Set up in 2011, the Waterstones 11 was created to promote debut literary fiction from new authors being published in the year ahead. Books were chosen from a list of 100 submitted by publishers, and were announced in January 2011 with in-shop and online support, as well as a media campaign for the final 11. The inaugural 11 included the Orange Prize winner &quot;The Tiger&#x27;s Wife&quot; by Téa Obreht, Man Booker Prize nominee &quot;Pigeon English&quot;, by Stephen Kelman and the Edinburgh International Book Festival First Book Award winner &quot;When God Was a Rabbit&quot; by Sarah Winman. The last list was announced in January 2013, followed by the discontinuation of the prize in January 2014.

<text>The Madison River is a headwater tributary of the Missouri River, approximately 183 miles (295 km) long, in Wyoming and Montana. Its confluence with the Jefferson and Gallatin rivers near Three Forks, Montana forms the Missouri River.

The Madison rises in Teton County in northwestern Wyoming at the confluence of the Firehole and Gibbon rivers, a location in Yellowstone National Park called &quot;Madison Junction&quot;. It first flows west, then north through the mountains of southwestern Montana to join the Jefferson and the Gallatin rivers at Three Forks. The Missouri River Headwaters State Park is located on the Madison at Three Forks.
In its upper reaches in Gallatin County, Montana, the Hebgen Dam forms Hebgen Lake. In its middle reaches in Madison County, Montana, the Madison Dam forms Ennis Lake and provides hydroelectric power. In 1959, the 1959 Hebgen Lake earthquake formed Quake Lake just downstream from Hebgen Dam. Downstream from Ennis, the Madison flows through Bear Trap Canyon, known for its class IV-V whitewater. The Bear Trap Canyon section is part of the Lee Metcalf Wilderness area.

The river was named in July 1805 by Meriwether Lewis at Three Forks. The central fork of the three, it was named for U.S. Secretary of State James Madison, who later succeeded Thomas Jefferson as President in 1809. The western fork, the largest, was named for President Jefferson and the east fork for Treasury Secretary Albert Gallatin.

The Madison is a class I river in Montana for the purposes of access for recreational use.
==Fauna==

The Madison River is widely regarded as one of the finest trout fisheries in the world. It is classified as a blue ribbon fishery in Montana, where fly fisherman target brown trout, rainbow trout, cutthroat trout, and mountain whitefish.

Grizzly bears and wolves reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park roam the river valley.

<doc id="531432" wikidata="Q29589" url="?curid=531432" title="Autostereogram">
<text>An autostereogram is a two-dimensional (2D) image that can create the optical illusion of a three-dimensional (3D) scene. Autostereograms use only one image to accomplish the effect while normal stereograms require two. The 3D scene in an autostereogram is often unrecognizable until it is viewed properly, unlike typical stereograms. Viewing any kind of stereogram properly may cause the viewer to experience vergence-accommodation conflict.

The optical illusion of an autostereogram is one of depth perception and involves stereopsis: depth perception arising from the different perspective each eye has of a three-dimensional scene, called binocular parallax.

Individuals with disordered binocular vision and who cannot perceive depth may require a wiggle stereogram to achieve a similar effect.

The simplest type of autostereogram consists of a horizontally repeating pattern, with small changes throughout, that looks like wallpaper. When viewed with proper vergence, the repeating patterns appear to float above or below the background. The well-known &quot;Magic Eye&quot; books feature another type of autostereogram called a random-dot autostereogram , similar to the first example, above. In this type of autostereogram, every pixel in the image is computed from a pattern strip and a depth map. A hidden 3D scene emerges when the image is viewed with the correct vergence.

Unlike normal stereograms, autostereograms do not require the use of a stereoscope. A stereoscope presents 2D images of the same object from slightly different angles to the left eye and the right eye, allowing the viewer to reconstruct the original object via binocular disparity. When viewed with the proper vergence, an autostereogram does the same, the binocular disparity existing in adjacent parts of the repeating 2D patterns.

There are two ways an autostereogram can be viewed: &quot;wall-eyed&quot; and &quot;cross-eyed&quot;. Most autostereograms (including those in this article) are designed to be viewed in only one way, which is usually wall-eyed. Wall-eyed viewing requires that the two eyes adopt a relatively parallel angle, while cross-eyed viewing requires a relatively convergent angle. An image designed for wall-eyed viewing if viewed correctly will appear to pop out of the background, whereas if viewed cross-eyed it will instead appear as a cut-out behind the background and may be difficult to bring entirely into focus.

==History==
In 1593, Giambattista della Porta viewed one page of a book with one eye and another page with the other eye. He was able to read one of the pages, the other being invisible, and switch &quot;the visual virtue&quot; to read the other page, the first becoming invisible. This is an early example of dissociating vergence from accommodation—a necessary ability for seeing autostereograms. However, Porta saw competition between images viewed by the two eyes, binocular rivalry.

It was not until 1838 that the Charles Wheatstone published an example of cooperation between the images in the two eyes: stereopsis (binocular depth perception). He explained that the depth arose from differences in the horizontal positions of the images in the two eyes. He supported his explanation by showing flat, two-dimensional pictures with such horizontal differences, stereograms, separately to the left and right eyes through a stereoscope he invented based on mirrors. From such pairs of flat images, people experienced the illusion of depth.

In 1844, David Brewster discovered the &quot;wallpaper effect&quot;. He noticed that when he stared at repeated patterns in wallpapers while varying his vergence, he could see them either behind the wall (with wall-eyed vergence) or in front of the wall (with cross-eyed vergence). This is the basis of wallpaper-style autostereograms.

In 1939 Boris Kompaneysky published the first random-dot stereogram containing a hand-drawn image of the face of Venus, intended to be viewed with a device.

In 1959, Bela Julesz, vision scientist, psychologist, and MacArthur Fellow, invented random dot stereograms while working at Bell Laboratories on recognizing camouflaged objects from aerial pictures taken by spy planes. At the time, many vision scientists assumed that stereopsis required prior analysis of visible contours of images in each eye, but Julesz showed it occurs with images with no such visible contours in each of the eyes. The contours of the depth object become visible only after stereopsis had processed the differences in the horizontal positions of dots in the two eyes&#x27; images.

Japanese designer Masayuki Ito, following Julesz, created a single image stereogram in 1970 and Swiss painter Alfons Schilling created a handmade single-image stereogram in 1974, after creating more than one viewer and meeting with Julesz. Having experience with stereo imaging in holography, lenticular photography, and vectography, he developed a random-dot method based on closely spaced vertical lines in parallax.

In 1979, Christopher Tyler of Smith-Kettlewell Institute, a student of Julesz and a visual psychophysicist, combined the theories behind single-image wallpaper stereograms and random-dot stereograms (the work of Julesz and Schilling) to create the first black-and-white random-dot autostereogram with the assistance of computer programmer Maureen Clarke using Apple II and BASIC. Stork and Rocca published the first scholarly paper and provided software for generating random-dot stereograms. This type of autostereogram allows a person to see 3D shapes from a single 2D image without the aid of optical equipment. In 1991 computer programmer Tom Baccei and artist Cheri Smith created the first color random-dot autostereograms, later marketed as &quot;Magic Eye&quot;.

A computer procedure that extracts back the hidden geometry out of an autostereogram image was described by Ron Kimmel.
In addition to classical stereo it adds smoothness as an important assumption in the surface reconstruction.

In the late &#x27;90s many children&#x27;s magazines featured autostereograms. Even gaming magazines like &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; had a section specifically made for these illusions. Since then several books were published with Magic Eye Beyond 3D: Improve Your Vision being one key publication that placed this intriguing illusion into the mainstream.

==How they work==

===Simple wallpaper===

Stereopsis, or stereo vision, is the visual blending of two similar but not identical images into one, with resulting visual perception of solidity and depth. In the human brain, stereopsis results from complex mechanisms that form a three-dimensional impression by matching each point (or set of points) in one eye&#x27;s view with the equivalent point (or set of points) in the other eye&#x27;s view. Using binocular disparity, the brain derives the points&#x27; positions in the otherwise inscrutable &quot;z&quot;-axis (depth).

When the brain is presented with a repeating pattern like wallpaper, it has difficulty matching the two eyes&#x27; views accurately. By looking at a horizontally repeating pattern, but converging the two eyes at a point behind the pattern, it is possible to trick the brain into matching one element of the pattern, as seen by the left eye, with another (similar looking) element, beside the first, as seen by the right eye. With the typical wall-eyed viewing, this gives the illusion of a plane bearing the same pattern but located behind the real wall. The distance at which this plane lies behind the wall depends only on the spacing between identical elements.

Autostereograms use this dependence of depth on spacing to create three-dimensional images. If, over some area of the picture, the pattern is repeated at smaller distances, that area will appear closer than the background plane. If the distance of repeats is longer over some area, then that area will appear more distant (like a hole in the plane).
People who have never been able to perceive 3D shapes hidden within an autostereogram find it hard to understand remarks such as, &quot;the 3D image will just pop out of the background, after you stare at the picture long enough&quot;, or &quot;the 3D objects will just emerge from the background&quot;. It helps to illustrate how 3D images &quot;emerge&quot; from the background from a second viewer&#x27;s perspective. If the virtual 3D objects reconstructed by the autostereogram viewer&#x27;s brain were real objects, a second viewer observing the scene from the side would see these objects floating in the air above the background image.

The 3D effects in the example autostereogram are created by repeating the tiger rider icons every 140 pixels on the background plane, the shark rider icons every 130 pixels on the second plane, and the tiger icons every 120 pixels on the highest plane. The closer a set of icons are packed horizontally, the higher they are lifted from the background plane. This repeat distance is referred to as the depth or &quot;z&quot;-axis value of a particular pattern in the autostereogram. The depth value is also known as Z-buffer value.
The brain is capable of almost instantly matching hundreds of patterns repeated at different intervals in order to recreate correct depth information for each pattern. An autostereogram may contain some 50 tigers of varying size, repeated at different intervals against a complex, repeated background. Yet, despite the apparent chaotic arrangement of patterns, the brain is able to place every tiger icon at its proper depth.

===Depth maps===

Autostereograms where patterns in a particular row are repeated horizontally with the same spacing can be read either cross-eyed or wall-eyed. In such autostereograms, both types of reading will produce similar depth interpretation, with the exception that the cross-eyed reading reverses the depth (images that once popped out are now pushed in).

However, icons in a row do not need to be arranged at identical intervals. An autostereogram with varying intervals between icons across a row presents these icons at different depth planes to the viewer. The depth for each icon is computed from the distance between it and its neighbor at the left. These types of autostereograms are designed to be read in only one way, either cross-eyed or wall-eyed. All autostereograms in this article are encoded for wall-eyed viewing, unless specifically marked otherwise. An autostereogram encoded for wall-eyed viewing will produce inverse patterns when viewed cross-eyed, and vice versa.

The wall-eyed depth map example autostereogram to the right encodes 3 planes across the &quot;x&quot;-axis. The background plane is on the left side of the picture. The highest plane is shown on the right side of the picture. There is a narrow middle plane in the middle of the &quot;x&quot;-axis. Starting with a background plane where icons are spaced at 140 pixels, one can raise a particular icon by shifting it a certain number of pixels to the left. For instance, the middle plane is created by shifting an icon 10 pixels to the left, effectively creating a spacing consisting of 130 pixels. The brain does not rely on intelligible icons which represent objects or concepts. In this autostereogram, patterns become smaller and smaller down the &quot;y&quot;-axis, until they look like random dots. The brain is still able to match these random dot patterns.

The distance relationship between any pixel and its counterpart in the equivalent pattern to the left can be expressed in a &quot;depth map&quot;. A depth map is simply a grayscale image which represents the distance between a pixel and its left counterpart using a grayscale value between black and white. By convention, the closer the distance is, the brighter the color becomes.

Using this convention, a grayscale depth map for the example autostereogram can be created with black, gray and white representing shifts of 0 pixels, 10 pixels and 20 pixels, respectively as shown in the greyscale example autostereogram. A depth map is the key to creation of random-dot autostereograms.

===Random-dot===
A computer program can take a depth map and an accompanying pattern image to produce an autostereogram. The program tiles the pattern image horizontally to cover an area whose size is identical to the depth map. Conceptually, at every pixel in the output image, the program looks up the grayscale value of the equivalent pixel in the depth map image, and uses this value to determine the amount of horizontal shift required for the pixel.

One way to accomplish this is to make the program scan every line in the output image pixel-by-pixel from left to right. It seeds the first series of pixels in a row from the pattern image. Then it consults the depth map to retrieve appropriate shift values for subsequent pixels. For every pixel, it subtracts the shift from the width of the pattern image to arrive at a repeat interval. It uses this repeat interval to look up the color of the counterpart pixel to the left and uses its color as the new pixel&#x27;s own color.
Unlike the simple depth planes created by simple wallpaper autostereograms, subtle changes in spacing specified by the depth map can create the illusion of smooth gradients in distance. This is possible because the grayscale depth map allows individual pixels to be placed on one of 2&quot;n&quot; depth planes, where &quot;n&quot; is the number of bits used by each pixel in the depth map. In practice, the total number of depth planes is determined by the number of pixels used for the width of the pattern image. Each grayscale value must be translated into pixel space in order to shift pixels in the final autostereogram. As a result, the number of depth planes must be smaller than the pattern width.

The fine-tuned gradient requires a pattern image more complex than standard repeating-pattern wallpaper, so typically a pattern consisting of repeated random dots is used. When the autostereogram is viewed with proper viewing technique, a hidden 3D scene emerges. Autostereograms of this form are known as Random Dot Autostereograms.

Smooth gradients can also be achieved with an intelligible pattern, assuming that the pattern is complex enough and does not have big, horizontal, monotonic patches. A big area painted with monotonic color without change in hue and brightness does not lend itself to pixel shifting, as the result of the horizontal shift is identical to the original patch. The following depth map of a shark with smooth gradient produces a perfectly readable autostereogram, even though the 2D image contains small monotonic areas; the brain is able to recognize these small gaps and fill in the blanks (illusory contours). While intelligible, repeated patterns are used instead of random dots, this type of autostereogram is still known by many as a Random Dot Autostereogram, because it is created using the same process.
===Animated===

When a series of autostereograms are shown one after another, in the same way moving pictures are shown, the brain perceives an animated autostereogram. If all autostereograms in the animation are produced using the same background pattern, it is often possible to see faint outlines of parts of the moving 3D object in the 2D autostereogram image without wall-eyed viewing; the constantly shifting pixels of the moving object can be clearly distinguished from the static background plane. To eliminate this side effect, animated autostereograms often use shifting background in order to disguise the moving parts.

When a regular repeating pattern is viewed on a CRT monitor as if it were a wallpaper autostereogram, it is usually possible to see depth ripples. This can also be seen in the background to a static, random-dot autostereogram. These are caused by the sideways shifts in the image due to small changes in the deflection sensitivity (linearity) of the line scan, which then become interpreted as depth. This effect is especially apparent at the left hand edge of the screen where the scan speed is still settling after the flyback phase. On a TFT LCD, which functions differently, this does not occur and the effect is not present. Higher quality CRT displays also have better linearity and exhibit less or none of this effect.

==Mechanisms for viewing==

Much advice exists about seeing the intended three-dimensional image in an autostereogram. While some people may quickly see the 3D image in an autostereogram with little effort, others must learn to train their eyes to decouple eye convergence from lens focusing.

Not every person can see the 3D illusion in autostereograms. Because autostereograms are constructed based on stereo vision, persons with a variety of visual impairments, even those affecting only one eye, are unable to see the three-dimensional images.

People with amblyopia (also known as lazy eye) are unable to see the three-dimensional images. Children with poor or dysfunctional eyesight during a critical period in childhood may grow up stereoblind, as their brains are not stimulated by stereo images during the critical period. If such a vision problem is not corrected in early childhood, the damage becomes permanent and the adult will never be able to see autostereograms. It is estimated that some 1 percent to 5 percent of the population is affected by amblyopia.

===3D perception===
Depth perception results from many monocular and binocular visual clues. For objects relatively close to the eyes, binocular vision plays an important role in depth perception. Binocular vision allows the brain to create a single Cyclopean image and to attach a depth level to each point in it.
The brain uses coordinate shift (also known as parallax) of matched objects to identify depth of these objects. The depth level of each point in the combined image can be represented by a grayscale pixel on a 2D image, for the benefit of the reader. The closer a point appears to the brain, the brighter it is painted. Thus, the way the brain perceives depth using binocular vision can be captured by a depth map (Cyclopean image) painted based on coordinate shift.


The eye operates like a photographic camera. It has an adjustable iris which can open (or close) to allow more (or less) light to enter the eye. As with any camera except pinhole cameras, it needs to focus light rays entering through the iris (aperture in a camera) so that they focus on a single point on the retina in order to produce a sharp image. The eye achieves this goal by adjusting a lens behind the cornea to refract light appropriately.

When a person stares at an object, the two eyeballs rotate sideways to point to the object, so that the object appears at the center of the image formed on each eye&#x27;s retina. In order to look at a nearby object, the two eyeballs rotate towards each other so that their eyesight can converge on the object. This is referred to as &quot;cross-eyed viewing&quot;. To see a faraway object, the two eyeballs &quot;diverge&quot; to become almost parallel to each other. This is known as &quot;wall-eyed viewing&quot;, where the convergence angle is much smaller than that in cross-eyed viewing.

Stereo-vision based on parallax allows the brain to calculate depths of objects relative to the point of convergence. It is the convergence angle that gives the brain the absolute reference depth value for the point of convergence from which absolute depths of all other objects can be inferred.
===Simulated 3D perception===

The eyes normally focus and converge at the same distance in a process known as accommodative convergence. That is, when looking at a faraway object, the brain automatically flattens the lenses and rotates the two eyeballs for wall-eyed viewing. It is possible to train the brain to decouple these two operations. This decoupling has no useful purpose in everyday life, because it prevents the brain from interpreting objects in a coherent manner. To see a human-made picture such as an autostereogram where patterns are repeated horizontally, however, decoupling of focusing from convergence is crucial.

By focusing the lenses on a nearby autostereogram where patterns are repeated and by converging the eyeballs at a distant point behind the autostereogram image, one can trick the brain into seeing 3D images. If the patterns received by the two eyes are similar enough, the brain will consider these two patterns a match and treat them as coming from the same imaginary object. This type of visualization is known as &quot;wall-eyed viewing&quot;, because the eyeballs adopt a wall-eyed convergence on a distant plane, even though the autostereogram image is actually closer to the eyes. Because the two eyeballs converge on a plane farther away, the perceived location of the imaginary object is behind the autostereogram. The imaginary object also appears bigger than the patterns on the autostereogram because of foreshortening.

The following autostereogram shows three rows of repeated patterns. Each pattern is repeated at a different interval to place it on a different depth plane. The two non-repeating lines can be used to verify correct wall-eyed viewing. When the autostereogram is correctly interpreted by the brain using wall-eyed viewing, and one stares at the dolphin in the middle of the visual field, the brain should see two sets of flickering lines, as a result of binocular rivalry.

While there are six dolphin patterns in the autostereogram, the brain should see seven &quot;apparent&quot; dolphins on the plane of the autostereogram. This is a side effect of the pairing of similar patterns by the brain. There are five pairs of dolphin patterns in this image. This allows the brain to create five apparent dolphins. The leftmost pattern and the rightmost pattern by themselves have no partner, but the brain tries to assimilate these two patterns onto the established depth plane of adjacent dolphins despite binocular rivalry. As a result, there are seven apparent dolphins, with the leftmost and the rightmost ones appearing with a slight flicker, not dissimilar to the two sets of flickering lines observed when one stares at the 4th apparent dolphin.

Because of foreshortening, the difference in convergence needed to see repeated patterns on different planes causes the brain to attribute different sizes to patterns with identical 2D sizes. In the autostereogram of three rows of cubes, while all cubes have the same physical 2D dimensions, the ones on the top row appear bigger, because they are perceived as farther away than the cubes on the second and third rows.

===Viewing techniques===
If one has two eyes, fairly healthy eyesight, and no neurological conditions which prevent the perception of depth, then one is capable of learning to see the images within autostereograms. &quot;Like learning to ride a bicycle or to swim, some pick it up immediately, while others have a harder time.&quot;

As with a photographic camera, it is easier to make the eye focus on an object when there is intense ambient light. With intense lighting, the eye can constrict the pupil, yet allow enough light to reach the retina. The more the eye resembles a pinhole camera, the less it depends on focusing through the lens. In other words, the degree of decoupling between focusing and convergence needed to visualize an autostereogram is reduced. This places less strain on the brain. Therefore, it may be easier for first-time autostereogram viewers to &quot;see&quot; their first 3D images if they attempt this feat with bright lighting.

Vergence control is important in being able to see 3D images. Thus it may help to concentrate on converging/diverging the two eyes to shift images that reach the two eyes, instead of trying to see a clear, focused image. Although the lens adjusts reflexively in order to produce clear, focused images, voluntary control over this process is possible. The viewer alternates instead between converging and diverging the two eyes, in the process seeing &quot;double images&quot; typically seen when one is drunk or otherwise intoxicated. Eventually the brain will successfully match a pair of patterns reported by the two eyes and lock onto this particular degree of convergence. The brain will also adjust eye lenses to get a clear image of the matched pair. Once this is done, the images around the matched patterns quickly become clear as the brain matches additional patterns using roughly the same degree of convergence.

When one moves one&#x27;s attention from one depth plane to another (for instance, from the top row of the chessboard to the bottom row), the two eyes need to adjust their convergence to match the new repeating interval of patterns. If the level of change in convergence is too high during this shift, sometimes the brain can lose the hard-earned decoupling between focusing and convergence. For a first-time viewer, therefore, it may be easier to see the autostereogram, if the two eyes rehearse the convergence exercise on an autostereogram where the depth of patterns across a particular row remains constant.

In a random dot autostereogram, the 3D image is usually shown in the middle of the autostereogram against a background depth plane (see the shark autostereogram). It may help to establish proper convergence first by staring at either the top or the bottom of the autostereogram, where patterns are usually repeated at a constant interval. Once the brain locks onto the background depth plane, it has a reference convergence degree from which it can then match patterns at different depth levels in the middle of the image.

The majority of autostereograms, including those in this article, are designed for divergent (wall-eyed) viewing. One way to help the brain concentrate on divergence instead of focusing is to hold the picture in front of the face, with the nose touching the picture. With the picture so close to their eyes, most people cannot focus on the picture. The brain may give up trying to move eye muscles in order to get a clear picture. If one slowly pulls back the picture away from the face, while refraining from focusing or rotating eyes, at some point the brain will lock onto a pair of patterns when the distance between them matches the current convergence degree of the two eyeballs.

Another way is to stare at an object behind the picture in an attempt to establish proper divergence, while keeping part of the eyesight fixed on the picture to convince the brain to focus on the picture. A modified method has the viewer focus on their reflection on a reflective surface of the picture, which the brain perceives as being located twice as far away as the picture itself. This may help persuade the brain to adopt the required divergence while focusing on the nearby picture.

Those who wear eyeglasses with so-called &quot;progressive&quot; lenses, in which the focal length gradually changes so as to ease the viewing of close objects using the lower part of the lens, may find that viewing a stereogram is easier if the glasses are pushed up a little so that the stereogram is viewed through a part of the lens optimized for images that are closer than the actual distance to the stereogram. When the eyes are made divergent by looking (or pretending to look) at a far-away object, the overcorrection from viewing the stereogram through the &quot;wrong&quot; part of the lens can bring the stereogram into focus without needing to overcome the tendency to focus on the far-away object while attempting to focus on the stereogram. 

For crossed-eyed autostereograms, a different approach needs to be taken. The viewer may hold one finger between their eyes and move it slowly towards the picture, maintaining focus on the finger at all times, until they are correctly focused on the spot that will allow them to view the illusion.

Stereoblindness, however, is not known to permit the usages of any of these techniques, especially for persons in whom it may be, or is, permanent.

==Terminology==
*Stereogram and autostereogram
:&quot;Stereogram&quot; was originally used to describe as a pair of 2D images used in stereoscope to present a 3D image to viewers. The &quot;auto&quot; in &quot;autostereogram&quot; describes an image that does not require a stereoscope. The term &quot;stereogram&quot; is now often used interchangeably with &quot;autostereogram&quot;. Dr. Christopher Tyler, inventor of the autostereogram, consistently refers to single image stereograms as autostereograms to distinguish them from other forms of stereograms.
*Random dot stereogram (RDS)
:Random dot stereogram, describes a pair of 2D images containing random dots which, when viewed with a stereoscope, produced a 3D image. The term is now often used interchangeably with random dot autostereogram.
*Single image stereogram (SIS)
:Single image stereogram (SIS). SIS differs from earlier stereograms in its use of a single 2D image instead of a stereo pair and is viewed without a device. Thus, the term is often used as a synonym of &quot;autostereogram&quot;. When the single 2D image is viewed with proper eye convergence, it causes the brain to fuse different patterns perceived by the two eyes into a virtual 3D image without, hidden within the 2D image, the aid of any optical equipment. SIS images are created using a repeating pattern. Programs for their creation include Mathematica.
*Random dot autostereogram/hidden image stereogram
:Is also known as single image random dot stereogram (SIRDS). This term also refers to autostereograms where the hidden 3D image is created using a random pattern of dots within one image, shaped by a depth map within a dedicated stereogram rendering program.
*Wallpaper autostereogram/object array stereogram/texture offset stereogram
:Wallpaper autostereogram is a single 2D image where recognizable patterns are repeated at various intervals to raise or lower each pattern&#x27;s perceived 3D location in relation to the display surface. Despite the repetition, these are a type of single image autostereogram.
*Single image random text stereogram (SIRTS)
:A single image random text ASCII stereogram is an alternative to SIRDS using random ASCII text instead of dots to produce a 3D form of ASCII art.
*Map textured stereogram
:In a map textured stereogram, &quot;a fitted texture is mapped onto the depth image and repeated a number of times&quot; resulting in a pattern where the resulting 3D image is often partially or fully visible before viewing.

<text>The Bloomsbury Theatre is a theatre located on Gordon Street in Bloomsbury, within the London Borough of Camden. It is owned by University College London. The Theatre has a seating capacity of 541 and offers a professional programme of innovative music, drama, comedy and dance throughout the year. It also provides a space for student-led productions.

Funded by a UGC grant and a considerable private donation, the theatre was opened in 1968 under the name Collegiate Theatre and was renamed the Bloomsbury Theatre in 1982. From 2001 to 2008, the theatre was known as The UCL Bloomsbury, to emphasise its connection to UCL, which uses the venue for student productions for 12 weeks a year. The Bloomsbury Theatre recently returned to the logo designed by cartoonist Gerald Scarfe, which had been using for nearly twenty years until 2001. The main theatre was closed for renovation in 2015 and reopened in February 2019.

The basement below the Theatre holds the Bloomsbury Studio, a black box performance space with a flexible seating configuration and capacity. 

The theatre building also provides access to the UCL Union Fitness Centre and the Clubs and Societies Centre on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th floors. A UCL Union-run café is located on the Ground Floor. Access to the Main UCL Wilkins Building (Octagon Building) and the UCL Refectory is possible through the theatre building.

Many notable artists have performed at the theatre, including UCL alumnus Ricky Gervais who performed two of his standup shows there, both of which were filmed for release on DVD and was the venue for Crusader Norman Housley come-back lecture series: Contesting the Crusades, which he developed into a popular history book.

In July 1982, the Bloomsbury Theatre premiered the English language performance of Pirandello&#x27;s Liola, by Internationalist Theatre, directed by UCL alumnus Fabio Perselli, who also did the translation.

From 2001, the theatre provided a residency for the New London Orchestra and hosted Robin Ince&#x27;s &quot;Nine Lessons and Carols for Godless People&quot; for several years.

May 2006 Paul Simon performed a concert which was recorded for the BBC Radio 2

January 2008 Adele performed her first solo concert which included a full performance of her debut album 19 which topped No.1 in the UK charts in the same week.

Christopher Nolan and Emma Thomas met while being members of UCL Film Society and credit the Bloomsbury theatre as being key to developing their careers in directing and producing.

<text>Faslane (Gaelic: Am Fas Leathann) on Gare Loch is the name of a bay near the village of Garelochhead, and is now the main part of HM Naval Base &quot;Clyde&quot; in Argyll and Bute, Scotland, as well as being a Defence Logistics Organisation port, operated in dual site organisation with &quot;Great Harbour&quot;, Greenock, by Serco Denholm.

Faslane is currently home to the United Kingdom&#x27;s Trident SSBN submarines

There is also Faslane Peace Camp outside the base, protesting since 1982 against the nuclear missiles and submarines there.

==History==
The immediate area was sparsely populated until a naval base was constructed during World War II, though Garelochhead was already a thriving village served by Clyde steamers and a railway station. A shipbreakers operated at Faslane until the mid-1980s, when its site was taken over for expansion of the naval base.

<text>Frank Leroy Chance (September 9, 1877 – September 15, 1924) was an American professional baseball player. A first baseman, Chance played in Major League Baseball for the Chicago Cubs and New York Yankees from 1898 through 1914. He also served as manager of the Cubs, Yankees, and Boston Red Sox.

Discovered by the Cubs as he played semi-professional baseball while attending college, Chance debuted with the Cubs in 1898, serving as a part-time player. In 1903, Chance became the Cubs&#x27; regular first baseman, and in 1905, he succeeded Frank Selee as the team&#x27;s manager. Chance led the Cubs to 100 wins in 1906, 1907, 1909, and 1910, becoming the first manager to compile four 100-win seasons (only eight other managers have accomplished the feat in MLB history), with no manager, other than Chance, leading a team to 100 wins four times in five seasons. They would win four National League championships in that span and won the World Series in 1907 and 1908. With Joe Tinker and Johnny Evers, Chance formed a strong double play combination, which was immortalized as &quot;Tinker-to-Evers-to-Chance&quot; in &quot;Baseball&#x27;s Sad Lexicon&quot;.

Let go by the Cubs after the 1912 season, Chance signed with the Yankees, serving as a player–manager for two seasons. He joined the Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League as a player–manager, returning to MLB in 1923 as manager of the Red Sox. Chance was named the manager of the Chicago White Sox in 1924, but never took control of the team as he became ill. He died later that year.

Noted for his leadership abilities, Chance earned the nickname &quot;Peerless Leader.&quot; He is the all-time leader in managerial winning percentage in Cubs history. Chance was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in the 1946 balloting by the Veterans Committee, along with Tinker and Evers. He was inducted into the Fresno County Athletic Hall of Fame&#x27;s first class, in 1959.

==Early life==
Chance was born in Salida, California, in Stanislaus County, on September 9, 1877. His family was of English and Scottish descent. He was raised in Fresno, California and attended Fresno High School. His father was president of the first national bank in Fresno.

Chance enrolled at the University of California, where he pursued a degree in dentistry. He transferred to Washington College in Irvington, California. While playing baseball for the school&#x27;s baseball team, he received an offer to play semi-professional baseball for a team in Sullivan, Illinois, for $40 a month ($ in current dollar terms), which he accepted.

Returning to college the next year, Chance led his team to a third-place finish in an amateur tournament of 50 teams. Bill Lange of the Chicago Cubs discovered Chance and convinced the Cubs to sign him as a backup catcher and outfielder, receiving $1,200 a year ($ in current dollar terms). Chance was scouted by other teams, but chose the Cubs as Tim Donohue was the only catcher ahead of him on the Cubs&#x27; depth chart.

==Professional baseball career==

===Chicago Cubs===

Chance began his career in 1898 with the Chicago Cubs, serving as a reserve catcher and outfielder. He played irregularly through the 1902 season. Due in part to finger injuries suffered while catching, Chance played in no more than 75 games in a season through 1902. In 1903, Johnny Kling became the Cubs&#x27; full-time catcher. As Bill Hanlon, the Cubs&#x27; first baseman, left the team, manager Frank Selee moved Chance to first base. Though Chance initially balked at the position change, he agreed when he received a pay raise.

Chance enjoyed a breakout season in 1903, recording a .327 batting average and 67 stolen bases; the latter mark led the National League (NL). His .439 on-base percentage was third-best in the league, behind Roy Thomas and Roger Bresnahan, and his 81 runs batted in (RBIs) tied Jake Beckley for sixth-best. Chance had a .310 batting average in 1904, good for sixth place in the NL. His .382 on-base percentage was the fourth-best in the league, and his .430 slugging percentage was fifth-best. Chance also hit six home runs, tying him with Dan McGann, Red Dooin, and Cozy Dolan for third place, his 42 stolen bases tied McGann for fourth place, and his 89 runs scored were seventh-best. On May 30, 1904, he was hit by a pitch five times in a double header.
Selee fell ill in 1905, and Chance was selected to succeed him as manager. That year, he also batted .316 with 92 runs scored and 70 RBIs. His batting average was sixth-best in the NL, while he led the league with a .450 on-base percentage, and finished seventh with a .434 slugging percentage. His 38 stolen bases were sixth-best in the league. In 1906, Chance batted .319 and led the NL in runs scored (103) and stolen bases (57). His batting average was fifth-best in the league, while his .419 on-base percentage finished in third, and his .430 slugging percentage placed him in fifth. When Chance stole home from second base in a tie game against the Cincinnati Reds, team owner Charles W. Murphy granted him a ten-percent ownership stake in the club to show his gratitude. Chance later sold his share of the franchise for approximately $150,000. Meanwhile, The Cubs won 116 games during the 1906 season, taking the NL pennant. The Chicago White Sox of the American League defeated the Cubs in the 1906 World Series.

Chance batted .293 during the 1907 season, finishing sixth in the NL, while his .395 on-base percentage was third-best. He tied Ed Abbaticchio for seventh with 35 stolen bases. The Cubs returned to the World Series in 1907. Though Chance only batted .154 in the 1907 World Series, the Cubs defeated the Tigers in four games.

Chance began to decline during the 1908 season. Though he finished third in the NL with 27 doubles, he did not finish among the ten best in the categories of batting average, on-base percentage, or stolen bases in 1908, 1909, or 1910. Chance batted .421 in the 1908 World Series, as the Cubs again defeated the Tigers, this time in five games.

By 1910, Chance began to groom Fred Luderus as his successor at first base. He rebuilt the team in 1911 after Evers&#x27;s nervous breakdown and the departure of Harry Steinfeldt, replacing them with Heinie Zimmerman and Jim Doyle respectively. The Cubs returned to the World Series in 1910, against the Philadelphia Athletics. Chance batted .353 in the 1910 World Series, though the Athletics won the series in five games. Chance was ejected in game three, becoming the first player ever ejected from a World Series game. Chance continued to transition himself out of the Cubs&#x27; lineup in 1911, as he played in only 31 games.

===New York Yankees===
In 1912, Chance endured surgeries to correct blood clots in his brain that were caused by being hit by pitches in his head. Meanwhile, Chance argued with Murphy, who had been releasing expensive players from the Cubs in an effort to save the team money. The New York Yankees negotiated for Chance&#x27;s release from the Cubs after the 1912 season. The Cubs released Chance while he was hospitalized, and in January 1913, Chance signed a three-year contract with the Yankees, worth $120,000 ($ in current dollar terms), to serve as the Yankees&#x27; manager. He also played first base for the Yankees and served as field captain, though he played in no more than 12 games in a season. The Yankees sat in last place on the next-to-last day of the 1913 season, but won their final game to finish in seventh place. In 1914, Chance named Roger Peckinpaugh the Yankees&#x27; new captain.

After struggling during the 1914 season, Chance criticized the talent brought to him by Yankees scout Arthur Irwin. After repeatedly seeking to have Irwin fired, he offered his resignation from the team late in the season on the condition that he still was to receive his 1915 salary. After this was accepted by team owner Frank J. Farrell, Chance resigned with three weeks remaining in the season, and Peckinpaugh served as player–manager for the remainder of the season.

===Later career===

Chance returned to his native California, and was named manager of the Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League in 1916. Chance won the league championship in 1916. He re-signed with the Angels for the 1917 season and was also granted a part ownership in the Angels from the majority owner, John F. Powers. Powers and Chance remained good friends for the rest of his life. He resigned during the 1917 season due to his declining health. He then served as president of the California Winter League, continuing to instill discipline in players: he fined Ty Cobb for &quot;abusing an umpire&quot;.

Chance managed the Boston Red Sox in 1923. The Red Sox did not retain Chance after the season. But some sources noted that Chance had only agreed to a one-year contract and was not necessarily interested in returning to the Red Sox, a team described by one sportswriter as no better than a minor league club. After his relationship with the Red Sox was severed, he was named the Chicago White Sox manager for the 1924 season but developed severe influenza before he could take the helm. He soon developed other respiratory complications, including asthma. Chance submitted his resignation to owner Charles Comiskey, but Comiskey refused to accept it, giving him the opportunity to return to the team when his health improved. He returned to Chicago briefly in April, but was unable to take charge of the team. Chance returned to Los Angeles where he underwent emergency surgery in April 1924. Evers was named the White Sox acting manager for the 1924 season.

===Career summary===

====Overview====
Chance was part of the trio of infielders remembered for their double-play ability, with Joe Tinker and Johnny Evers. The trio were immortalized as &quot;Tinker-to-Evers-to-Chance&quot;, also known as &quot;Baseball&#x27;s Sad Lexicon&quot;, written by the 28-year-old &quot;New York Evening Mail&quot; newspaper columnist Franklin Pierce Adams in July 1910. Chance helped Evers develop an underhanded throw.

Chance took over as Chicago&#x27;s manager in 1905. His playing time decreased towards the end of the decade. The Cubs won the NL pennant in 1906, 1907, 1908 and 1910, and won the World Series in 1907 and 1908—the team&#x27;s last World Series titles before 2016. He became the highest paid player in baseball, earning as much as $25,000 ($ in current dollar terms) in 1910. Noted for his leadership abilities, Chance earned the nickname &quot;Peerless Leader.&quot; John McGraw, a contemporary and rival of Chance, considered Chance one of the greatest players he ever saw.

Chance&#x27;s lifetime record as a manager was 946–648 ( winning percentage); his .664 winning percentage as manager of the Cubs is the highest in franchise history. As a player, Chance is the Cubs&#x27; all-time career leader in stolen bases, with 400. He led the Cubs in batting average in 1903, 1904, 1905 and 1907. In World Series play, Chance batted .300, recording 21 hits, scoring 11 runs, and stealing 10 bases.

Chance was a disciplinarian. He preached moderation in socializing, including avoiding alcohol, to his players. Chance fined his players for shaking hands with members of the opposing team and forced Solly Hofman to delay his wedding until after the baseball season, lest marriage impair his abilities on the playing field. In August 1911, Chance suspended Tinker for the remainder of the season for using profanity, though he reinstated Tinker two days later.

====Managerial record====

==Personal==

During the baseball offseasons, Chance worked as a prizefighter. James J. Corbett and John L. Sullivan, among the best fighters of the era, both considered Chance &quot;the greatest amateur brawler of all time.&quot; Chance owned a ranch in Glendora, California, which he sold prior to becoming manager of the Red Sox.

Chance married Edythe Pancake on October 3, 1903. Edythe became an advocate for baseball, imploring women to attend baseball games.

Chance died on September 15, 1924 at age 47. Some sources simply said that he died after a &quot;long illness&quot;, while others attributed it to heart disease brought on by severe spasms of bronchial asthma. He was survived by his wife, mother, sister, and three brothers. Chance was interred in the Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery, Los Angeles. His death was greatly mourned, and his funeral received widespread publicity in Los Angeles and Chicago. Among his pallbearers were Powers and race car driver Barney Oldfield. His estate was valued at $170,000 ($2.35 million today).

==Honors==
After falling short of induction in the Baseball Hall of Fame by seven votes in 1945, Chance was elected to the Hall of Fame in the 1946 balloting by the Veterans Committee. Tinker and Evers were elected the same year. Chance was also elected to the Fresno County Athletic Hall of Fame&#x27;s first class, in 1959.

A baseball field in Fresno named after Chance operated from 1935 to 1941. Joe DiMaggio played in the first-ever game at Frank Chance Field. Retired players participated in an exhibition game in Chance&#x27;s honor in 1937.

The City of Hope National Medical Center created the Frank L. Chance Research Fellowship Foundation in his memory.

<text>Robert Taschereau (September 10, 1896 – July 26, 1970) was a lawyer who served as the 11th Chief Justice of Canada from 1963 to 1967, as a puisne justice of the Supreme Court of Canada from 1940 to 1963, and briefly as the Administrator of the Government of Canada for one month from March to April 1967 following the death of Governor General of Canada Georges Vanier.

==Biography==
He was born in Quebec City in 1896 to Louis-Alexandre Taschereau and Adine Dionne. He came from a family of politicians and lawyers; his father later became Premier of Quebec and his grandfather, Jean-Thomas Taschereau, was on the Supreme Court of Canada. He studied at Laval University and obtained a B.A. degree in 1916 and LL.L. in 1920.

Following a career as a lawyer, Taschereau entered politics as a Liberal and won a seat in the Quebec National Assembly in 1930. He held his seat of the riding of Bellechasse until retiring in 1936.

===Supreme Court Judge===
On February 9, 1940, he was appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada, filling the vacancy created by the death of his former law partner, Lawrence Cannon.

In 1946, he and fellow Justice Roy Kellock conducted the Royal Commission on Spying Activities in Canada that had been prompted by the Gouzenko Affair.

Taschereau was promoted to Chief Justice in 1963.

Under the Letters Patent, 1947, the Chief Justice of Canada serves as the Administrator of the Government of Canada in the death, absence or incapacity of the Governor General of Canada. Taschereau served as Administrator from the death of Governor General Georges Vanier on March 5, 1967 until April 17, 1967 when the Queen appointed Roland Michener as the new governor general, on the advice of Prime Minister Lester Pearson.

==Personal==

Taschereau was married to Ellen Donohue, daughter of Joseph Timothy Donohue (co-founder of Donohue Inc.) and Émilie Normandin.

===Retirement and honours===
Taschereau remained on the Supreme Court until retiring in 1967.

In 1967 he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada.

Robert Taschereau died in 1970 at the age of 73, and was interred in the family plot at the Cimetière Notre-Dame-de-Belmont in Sainte-Foy, Quebec.

<doc id="531457" wikidata="Q6939061" url="?curid=531457" title="Murrain">
<text>The word &quot;murrain&quot; (like an archaic use of the word &quot;distemper&quot;) is an antiquated term covering various infectious diseases affecting cattle and sheep. The word originates from Middle English &quot;moreine&quot; or &quot;moryne&quot;, in parallel to Late Latin (&quot;plague&quot;), a probable derivative of Latin (&quot;to die&quot;). 

The word &quot;murrain&quot;, much like the word , did not refer to a specific disease but rather served as an umbrella term for what veterinary science now recognizes as a number of different diseases with high morbidity and mortality, such as rinderpest, erysipelas, foot-and-mouth disease, anthrax, and streptococcus infections. Some of these livestock diseases can also affect humans. The term &quot;murrain&quot; also referred to an epidemic of such a disease.

There were major sheep- and cattle-murrains in Europe during the 14th century, which, combined with the Little Ice Age, resulted in the Great Famine of 1315–1317, weakening the population of Europe before the onset of the Black Death in 1348.

==Biblical references==
The term &quot;murrain&quot; is also used in some Bible translations relating to the fifth plague brought upon Egypt.
Exodus 9:3: &quot;Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain.&quot;

&quot;Pestilence&quot;, which is mentioned 47 times in 46 verses of the Bible, can be translated &quot;murrain&quot; by Christian apologists.
[Enhanced Strong&#x27;s Lexicon].
see Psalms 91:3 KJV

The word in Hebrew is דֶּבֶר &quot;dever&quot; (Strong&#x27;s #01698), derived from the primitive root &quot;dabar&quot; in the sense of &quot;to destroy.&quot;

==Superstitions==
In some parts of Scotland, force-fire was believed to cure it. In some remote regions of Cumbria, England, and the Isle of Man, murrain is still used as a term for a curse, specifically one placed upon land or livestock. It is believed that the medieval term has, by a process of syncreticism become synonymous with witchcraft. This usage inspired the ATV television play, &quot;Murrain&quot;, written by Manxman Nigel Kneale, which was broadcast on 27 July 1975 as part of the channel&#x27;s &quot;Against the Crowd&quot; drama strand.

==Distemper among cattle in England, 1745–1757==


In those years, acts of the Parliament of Great Britain were passed to &quot;more effectually to prevent the spreading of distemper which now rages amongst the horned cattle in this kingdom&quot;.

<doc id="531458" wikidata="Q7971453" url="?curid=531458" title="Washburn Observatory">
<text>The Washburn Observatory (obs. code: 753) is an astronomical observatory located at 1401 Observatory Drive on the University of Wisconsin–Madison campus in Madison, Wisconsin, United States. Completed in 1881, it was a major research facility for about 50 years. Today, it is home to the UW-Madison College of Letters and Science Honors Program, while the telescope remains in use by students in introductory astronomy courses and the general public during open houses and viewings.

== History ==
The observatory is named after the former Wisconsin governor, Cadwallader C. Washburn. In 1876, the Wisconsin State Legislature passed &quot;An Act to permanently provide for deficiencies in the University fund income&quot; to which Washburn added a provision that allocated a sum of $3000 USD per year over three years for the establishment of astronomy instruction and a corresponding observatory. This money was not to come from state funds, but was to be raised with property tax.
On September 18, 1877, John Bascom, the president of the University, announced that Washburn would provide an observatory with a telescope that was to be larger than the 15-inch refractor at Harvard. Washburn, along with the Board of Regents, chose the site of the observatory to be removed from the city of Madison with the university campus acting as the divider. The site was about 100 feet above Lake Mendota on the north side of campus and, at the time, was surrounded by a vineyard and orchard. Construction on the observatory was started in May, 1878, and a contract was given to Alvan Clark to build the telescope. It was decided that the telescope would have a diameter of 15.6 inches, which would make it the third largest in the United States.

James C. Watson was appointed the first director of the observatory. He oversaw the completion of the original building, and also provided funding for a students&#x27; observatory, as well as a solar observatory. He died suddenly in 1880, never seeing the completed observatory. The instruments in the solar observatory, meant to be used in locating the hypothetical planet Vulcan, were removed in 1882. He was succeeded by Directors Edward S. Holden (1883-1886) then George C. Comstock (1886-1922).

Joel Stebbins became the Director in 1922, and the observatory became a focus for pioneering work on photoelectric photometry as well as the study of variable stars and the interstellar reddening of starlight. He retired in 1948, being succeeded by Albert Whitford. The observatory was used quite heavily until the new Pine Bluff Observatory was dedicated in 1958. Whitford was instrumental in persuading the faculty to fund this new instrument. He left to become Director of Lick Observatory shortly after it was dedicated. Today Washburn Observatory is home to the University of Wisconsin-Madison College of Letters &amp; Science Honors Program. The telescope, managed by the UW Department of Astronomy, is still used for public viewings and educational events.

<text>Bloomsbury Square is a garden square in Bloomsbury, in the London Borough of Camden, London. Developed in the late 17th century, it was initially known as Southampton Square and was one of the earliest London squares. By the early 19th century, Bedford House along the north of the square had been demolished and replaced with terraced housing designed by James Burton.

== Geography ==
To the north of the square is Great Russell Street and Bedford Place, leading to Russell Square. To the south is Bloomsbury Way. To the west is the British Museum and Holborn is the nearest underground station to the southeast. There are gardens in the centre of the square.

== History ==
The square was developed for the 4th Earl of Southampton in the early 1660s and was initially known as Southampton Square. It was one of the earliest London squares. The Earl&#x27;s own house, then known as Southampton House and later as Bedford House after the square and the rest of the Bloomsbury Estate passed by marriage from the Earls of Southampton to the Dukes of Bedford, occupied the whole of the north side of the square, where Bedford Place is now located. The other sides were lined with typical terraced houses of the time, which were initially occupied by members of the aristocracy and gentry.

On 9 April 1694 Bloomsbury Square was the setting for an infamous duel. The then 23-year-old Scottish economist and financier John Law fought Edward &#x27;Beau&#x27; Wilson, killing him with a single pass and thrust of his sword. Law would be convicted of murder and sentenced to death, but would escape his condemned cell and go on to become the founder of the Mississippi Company and the de facto prime minister of France.

By the early 19th century, Bloomsbury was no longer fashionable with the upper classes. Consequently, the Duke of Bedford of the day moved out of Bedford House, which was demolished and replaced with further terraced houses. In the 19th century the square was occupied mainly by middle class professionals. The writer Isaac D&#x27;Israeli lived at No. 6 from 1817 to 1829 and for part of that time his son, the future Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli lived with him. In the 20th century most of the buildings came to be used as offices.

Bloomsbury Square&#x27;s garden contains a bronze statue by Richard Westmacott of Charles James Fox, who was a Whig associate of the Dukes of Bedford. None of the original 17th-century buildings survive, but there are many handsome 18th- and early 19th-century houses. The Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain was based in an 18th-century building on the southern side of the square partly credited to John Nash. The eastern side of the square is occupied by a large early 20th-century office building called Victoria House, built for, and for many decades occupied by, Liverpool Victoria Friendly Society. The garden is open to the public and was refurbished in 2003.

The garden is Grade II listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

<doc id="531463" wikidata="Q1700500" url="?curid=531463" title="John Hospers">
<text>John Hospers (June 9, 1918 – June 12, 2011) was an American philosopher and political activist. Hospers was interested in Objectivism, and was once a friend of the philosopher Ayn Rand, though she later broke with him. In 1972, Hospers became the first presidential candidate of the Libertarian Party, and was the only minor party candidate to receive an electoral vote in that year&#x27;s U.S. presidential election.

==Background==
John Hospers was born to a Dutch-American family in Pella, Iowa, on June 9, 1918, the son of Dena Helena (Verhey) and John De Gelder Hospers. He graduated from Central College in 1939 before earning an MA in English from the University of Iowa in 1942 and a PhD in philosophy from Columbia University in 1946. He conducted research, wrote, and taught in areas of philosophy, including aesthetics and ethics. He taught philosophy at the University of Minnesota, Brooklyn College, California State College Los Angeles (1966–1968) and at the University of Southern California, where for many years he was chairman of the philosophy department and professor emeritus.

In 2002, an hour-long video about Hospers&#x27; life, work, and philosophy was released by the Liberty Fund of Indianapolis, as part of its &quot;Classics of Liberty&quot; series.

Multiple sources, including the Libertarian Party, have referred to Hospers as the first openly gay person to run for president of the United States. However, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that his family &quot;strenuously denied&quot; that he was gay.

Hospers died in Los Angeles on June 12, 2011, at the age of 93.

==Libertarianism==
===Friendship with Ayn Rand===
During the period he taught philosophy at Brooklyn College, Hospers was very interested in Objectivism. He appeared on radio shows with Ayn Rand, and devoted considerable attention to her ideas in his ethics textbook &quot;Human Conduct&quot;.

According to Rand&#x27;s biographer, Barbara Branden, Hospers met Rand when she addressed the student body at Brooklyn College. They became friends, and had lengthy philosophical conversations. Rand&#x27;s discussions with Hospers contributed to her decision to write non-fiction. Hospers read &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; (1957), which he considered an aesthetic triumph. Although Hospers became convinced of the validity of Rand&#x27;s moral and political views, he disagreed with her about issues of epistemology, the subject of their extensive correspondence. Hospers also disagreed with Rand about free will (with him favoring determinism, while she advocated a libertarian view) and conscription (Hospers supported it, Rand was opposed). Rand broke with Hospers after he, in his position as moderator, critiqued her address, and she felt he had criticized her talk on &quot;Art and Sense of Life&quot; before the American Society of Aesthetics at Harvard.

===1972 presidential candidacy===

In the 1972 U.S. presidential election, Hospers and Tonie Nathan were the first presidential and vice-presidential nominees, respectively, of the newly formed Libertarian Party. The Libertarian Party was poorly organized, and Hospers and Nathan managed to get on the ballot in only two states (Washington and Colorado), receiving 3,674 popular votes.

Hospers and Nathan received one electoral vote from faithless elector Roger MacBride, a Republican from Virginia, resulting in Nathan&#x27;s becoming the first woman and the first Jew to receive an electoral vote in a United States presidential election.

===Later views===
By 1991, Hospers had left the Libertarians for the Republican Party, where he helped establish the Republican Liberty Caucus. He adopted more conventionally conservative views in his later writings: in 1998, he wrote an article rejecting open border immigration, and in a 2007 revision of his book &quot;Libertarianism&quot;, he said he supported the Iraq War.

==Bibliography==
Hospers&#x27; books include:
* &quot;Meaning and Truth in the Arts&quot; (1946)
* &quot;Introductory Readings in Aesthetics&quot; (1969)
* &quot;Artistic Expression&quot; (1971)
* &quot;Libertarianism – A Political Philosophy for Tomorrow&quot; (1971)
* &quot;Understanding the Arts&quot; (1982)
* &quot;Law and the Market&quot; (1985)
* &quot;Human Conduct&quot; (now in its 3rd edition, 1995)
* &quot;An Introduction to Philosophical Analysis&quot; (now in the 4th edition, 1996)

Hospers was editor of three anthologies, and contributed to books edited by others. He wrote more than 100 articles in various scholarly and popular journals.

Hospers was editor of &quot;The Personalist&quot; (1968–1982) and &quot;The Monist&quot; (1982–1992), and was a senior editor at &quot;Liberty&quot; magazine. Additionally Hospers wrote the article &quot;Art and Morality&quot; for the &quot;Journal of Comparative Literature and Aesthetics (JCLA)&quot;, Vol. 1, No. 1, Summer 1978.

<text>The Hartung–Boothroyd Observatory (HBO) is located atop Mount Pleasant near Cornell University outside of Ithaca, New York (US). It is used mainly as a teaching facility for upper-level undergraduate astronomy classes. The observatory is named to recognize funding from M. John Hartung, a 1908 Cornell graduate and later chemical industrialist, and to honor Samuel L. Boothroyd, the founder of Cornell&#x27;s Department of Astronomy. The facility was designed and directed from 1974 to 2012 by James R. Houck.

The primary 0.6m mirror was constructed from a Pyrex 1/8-scale test pouring as part of technology development for the Palomar Observatory 200-inch telescope. The mirror was polished and mounted in a lightweight tube in the late 1930s under Boothroyd&#x27;s direction, but World War II deferred its planned use in a high-altitude observatory. This facility, together with an equatorial fork mount to hold the previously completed telescope, was completed in 1974.

<text>Christie are an English soft rock band that formed at the end of the 1960s. They are best remembered for their UK chart-topping hit single &quot;Yellow River&quot;, released in 1970, which hit number one in 26 countries that year.

==Career==
In addition to Jeff Christie (born Jeffrey Christie, 12 July 1946, Chapel Allerton, Leeds, Yorkshire, England) their vocalist, bassist and songwriter; they initially included guitarist Vic Elmes and drummer Mike Blakley (born Michael Blakley, 12 January 1947, Bromley, Kent, England, brother of Alan Blakley).

Jeff Christie had previously worked with several bands, including The Outer Limits, who released &quot;Just One More Chance&quot; / &quot;Help Me Please&quot; (1967) and &quot;Great Train Robbery&quot; / &quot;Sweet Freedom&quot; (1968).

In 1970, Jeff Christie offered his composition &quot;Yellow River&quot; to The Tremeloes.
They recorded it to release as a single but changed their minds as they were going more progressive as the seventies started. At the same time Tremeloes member Alan Blakley&#x27;s brother Michael had a little group called the Epics and Alan wanted to give his brother a break. They decided to get Jeff Christie to come down from Leeds and let him use the Tremeloes&#x27; backing track. The Epics became Christie with Jeff as the lead vocalist and the result was a UK number one hit in June 1970, and subsequently No. 23 in the US, also accumulating more weeks (23) on the Hot 100 than any other entry on that chart completely inside 1970. It was a worldwide hit and was number one in 26 countries with global sales of over 3 million.

The follow-up single from October 1970, &quot;San Bernadino&quot; (misspelled if referring to, for example, San Bernardino, California), reached UK Number 7 and Number 1 in Germany, but only US No. 100. Both tracks became flash songs on their eponymous debut album of that year, and it stayed on US Billboard 200 chart for ten weeks. But the trio failed to sustain a lasting career, and Blakley was replaced by Paul Fenton (born 4 July 1946, Huddersfield, Yorkshire) just before the release of the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;For All Mankind&quot; (1971).

Lem Lubin (ex-Unit 4 + 2) was added to the line-up after the release of &quot;Iron Horse&quot; (1972), but the title track proved to be the band&#x27;s final hit single. The departure of Fenton and Lubin hastened the demise of the original line-up, but Jeff Christie returned with new members Terry Fogg (drums) (born Terrence George Fogg, 25 September 1945, Chesterfield, Derbyshire), Roger Flavell (bass), and Danny Krieger (guitar). A 1974 single &quot;Alabama&quot; / &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot; failed to resurrect the band&#x27;s fortunes, and new members Tony Ferguson (guitar) and Roger Willis (drums) were brought in to join Christie and Flavell. &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Band&quot;, written by Elmes, was a major hit for Christie in Argentina and Brazil, while the last Christie hit, &quot;Navajo&quot;, was Number 1 in Mexico. In 1982 Vic Elmes enlisted Mick Blakley and Peter Morrison of NYPL, to tour Germany on a package tour. At the end of the tour, the band folded. The band recorded an Elmes song, Deep in the Night, produced by Alan Blakley.

Jeff Christie reformed the band in 1990 with members of UK band Tubeless Hearts, Kev Moore, Simon Kay and Adrian &#x27;Fos&#x27; Foster. Tubeless Hearts tried to represent United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1991 with a Jeff Christie song, &quot;Safe in your Arms&quot;, but were unsuccessful. They continued to tour for a further 16 years all over Europe, Russia and Israel, recording intermittently. Following the release of Jeff Christie&#x27;s &quot;Floored Masters&quot; double album, the 1990 line-up of Christie embarked on a 2009 European Tour. In 2012, a Christie double album, &quot;No Turn Unstoned&quot;, was released, a collection of Christie demos and unreleased songs.

<text>Tavistock Square is a public square in Bloomsbury, in the London Borough of Camden near Euston Station.

==History==
Tavistock Square was built shortly after 1806 by the property developer James Burton and the master builder Thomas Cubitt for Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford, and formed part of the Bedford Estate in London, owned by the Dukes of Bedford. The square takes its name from &quot;Marquess of Tavistock&quot;, a courtesy title given to the eldest sons of the Dukes of Bedford.

In 1920 the Tavistock Clinic was founded in the square, a pioneering psychiatric clinic whose patients included shell-shock victims of the First World War. In 1946 the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations separated from the Tavistock Clinic. The Tavistock Clinic has since moved to Swiss Cottage.

Richard Lydekker, naturalist, geologist and writer of numerous books on natural history, was born at Tavistock Square in 1849.

Tavistock Square was the scene of one of the four suicide bombings on 7 July 2005. The bomb was detonated by 18-year-old Hasib Hussain on a double-decker bus bearing route number 30; it had been diverted from its normal route along Euston Road because of traffic disruption by the other three bombings at tube stations. The bomb exploded immediately outside the British Medical Association building, many of whose staff came out to give what help they could. The explosion killed 13 passengers, plus Hussain himself. Many others were injured. In September 2018, a memorial honouring the victims and the efforts of those who gave assistance was unveiled in Tavistock Square Gardens, replacing a plaque that had been fixed to the railings outside BMA House, opposite to the new site.

==Public art==

The centre-piece of the gardens is a statue of Mahatma Gandhi, sculpted by Fredda Brilliant and installed in 1968. The hollow pedestal was intended, and is used, for people to leave floral tributes to the peace campaigner and nonviolent resister to oppression in South Africa and British rule in India.

A cherry tree was planted in 1967 in memory of the victims of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

A generation later, in 1994, the Conscientious Objectors Commemorative Stone commemorating &quot;men and women conscientious objectors all over the world and in every age&quot; by Hugh Court was unveiled.

These three features have led to the square unofficially being regarded by some as a peace park or garden, and annual ceremonies are held at each of these memorials. 

A bust of the writer Virginia Woolf, cast from a 1931 sculpture by Stephen Tomlin (1901–1937), was unveiled in 2004 at the southwest corner of the square. Woolf lived at 52 Tavistock Square between 1924 and 1939. From there she and her husband Leonard Woolf ran the Hogarth Press, which became a prominent and influential publisher at the forefront of modernist fiction and poetry (publishing T.S. Eliot, E.M. Forster and Katherine Mansfield among others) and translating the works of Sigmund Freud into English.

The square contains a memorial to the surgeon Dame Louisa Aldrich-Blake (1865 –1925), with a bust of Aldrich-Blake by Arthur George Walker on a plinth designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens.

==Buildings==
The following buildings are on Tavistock Square:
* Tavistock House, home of James Burton while he developed the area and then of Charles Dickens, was on the east side of the square. A blue plaque on BMA House commemorates him. It was demolished in 1901.
* &quot;BMA House&quot;, the headquarters of the British Medical Association, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens in 1911 is on the east side (on the site previously occupied by Tavistock House) and is a grade II listed building.
*Connaught Hall, a University of London hall of residence, which was built in the early 19th century, is on the west side of the square and is a grade II listed building.
* Woburn House, on the north side of the square contains the headquarters of Universities UK, the conference of university rectors, and the headquarters of the Medical Schools Council, an organisation which represents the interests and ambitions of UK medical schools.
* The Tavistock Hotel, a branch of Imperial London Hotels, completed in 1951 is on the south side of the square.
*Lynton House and Tavis House, both substantial red-brick office blocks on the east side, were built in the mid-20th century.
*Passfield Hall, a hall of residence for undergraduates of the London School of Economics.

<doc id="531482" wikidata="Q298216" url="?curid=531482" title="Taytu Betul">
<text>Taytu Betul ( &quot;Ṭaytu Bəṭul&quot; ; baptised as Wälättä Mikael; 1851 – 11 February 1918) was Empress of Ethiopia from 1889 to 1913 and the third wife of Emperor Menelik II. An influential figure in the anti-colonial resistance during the late 19th-century Scramble for Africa, she, along with her husband, founded the modern Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa in 1886.

== Early life ==
According to Raymond Jonas, Taytu Betul (or Taitu) was born in Semien, North Gondar, Ethiopian Empire. Scholarly consensus is that she was born at about 1851.

Taytu&#x27;s father, Ras Betul Haile Maryam, was part of the ruling family of Semien that claimed to be descendants of the Solomonic Dynasty through Emperor Susenyos I. Taytu&#x27;s uncle was the Amhara warlord Wube Haile Maryam who governed the Semien and Tigray princedom.

=== Education ===
There are no records indicating that Empress Taytu attended school; however, she was taught to read and write in Amharic and Ge&#x27;ez. This is a rarity, considering that it was unlikely for women to be educated at the time. It is believed that she was taught diplomacy, politics and economics. Additionally, she understood a language once exclusive to the Ethiopian Orthodox liturgy.

=== Hobbies ===
Empress Taytu was known to play the begena, which is a 10-string instrument. Her other activities included playing Senterej, Ethiopian chess, and an interest in writing poetry.

=== Family history ===
Of Lasta, Yejju and Tigray descent, her family is claimed to have a ruling foothold in the Northern region of the country. Such places include: Semien, Begemeder, Lasta, Yejju, Wello and Tigray. Her aristocratic lineage dates back to 1607–32, descending from the daughter of Emperor Susneyos. Her great-grandfather, Ras Gebre of Simien, ruled for 44 years during the period known as the Zemene Mesafint, or the &quot;Era of the Princes&quot;. His fame was acknowledged through two measures. He was responsible for making the communities west of Gondar pay taxes in gold, as well as treating his subjects so well – providing an ample amount of food and drink so that they no longer needed to farm to sustain themselves. Her grandfather, Dejazmach Haile Maryam Gebre, also held a respected title. He governed Simien, where his children Wube, Betul and Merso were born. Additionally, her uncle Degazmach Wube followed in the family&#x27;s footsteps by also acquiring a high position in the region. As the half-brother of Taytu&#x27;s father, Degazmach Wube was responsible for ruling the Tigray province. Taytu had two brothers (Ras Welle Betul &amp; Temru Betul) and two sisters.

=== Personal life ===
In her fourth and final marriage, Taytu Betul married King Menelik of Shewa, who would later become Emperor of Ethiopia.

==Political contributions ==
Taytu is acknowledged to have wielded considerable political power both before and after she and Menelik were crowned Emperor and Empress in 1889. She led the conservative faction at court that resisted the modernists and progressives who wanted to develop Ethiopia along western lines and bring modernity to the country. According to the historians, she was always consulted by the Emperor prior to making important decisions. Thus, Empress Taytu was a key player in the conflict over the Treaty of Wuchale with Italy, which she tore up. Empress Taytu was the first to motivate the hesitant Emperor and other men to stand up against the Italians. Deeply suspicious of European intentions towards Ethiopia, she was a key player in the conflict over the Treaty of Wuchale with Italy, in which the Italian version made Ethiopia an Italian protectorate, while the Amharic version did not do so. The Empress held a hard line against the Italians, and when talks eventually broke down, and Italy invaded the Empire from its Eritrean colony, she marched north with the Emperor and the Imperial Army, commanding a force of cannoneers at the historic Battle of Adwa that resulted in a humiliating defeat for Italy in March 1896. This victory was the most significant of any African army battling European colonialism. Menelik II and Taytu Betul were temporarily in possession of 4,000 prisoners of war. Menelik, who often prevaricated and postponed unpleasant decisions by answering &quot;Yes, tomorrow&quot; (&quot;Ishi, nega&quot;), found it useful to have his wife be in a powerful enough position to say &quot;Absolutely not&quot; (&quot;Imbi&quot;) to people and issues he just did not want to personally offend or refuse.

When Menelik&#x27;s health began to decline around 1906, Taytu began to make decisions on his behalf, angering her rivals for power through her appointment of favorites and relatives to most of the positions of power and influence. As a means to curb her family&#x27;s political influence at court, Menelik selected Sabla Wangel Hailu as the heir-presumptive &quot;Lij&quot; Iyasu&#x27;s wife, as her family had no ties to Taytu&#x27;s. Taytu was widely resented for her alleged Gonderine xenophobia and nepotism, and the nobility of Shoa and Tigray, along with the Wollo relatives of &quot;Lij&quot; Iyasu conspired to remove her from state responsibility. In 1910, she was forced from power, and a regency under Ras Tessema Nadew took over. Instructed to limit herself to the care of her stricken husband, Taytu faded from the political scene. Taytu and Menelik did not have any children. Menelik died in 1913 and was succeeded by his grandson from a daughter of a previous liaison, Lij Iyasu. Taytu was banished to the old Palace at Entoto, next to the St. Mary&#x27;s church she had founded years before, and where her husband had been crowned Emperor.

While some believe Taytu may have played a part in the plot that eventually removed Emperor Iyasu V from the throne in 1916, replacing him with Empress Zauditu, the price for Zauditu&#x27;s elevation was a divorce from Taytu&#x27;s nephew Ras Gugsa Welle, who became governor of Begemder. Zauditu, Menelik II&#x27;s daughter by yet another previous marriage, had always been close to Empress Taytu and invited Taytu to live with her. Although Taytu declined she resumed advising rulers &quot;in a modest way,&quot; to quote Chris Prouty.

== Later years ==
Taytu lived out the next few years at the old palace next to the Entoto Maryam Church overlooking Addis Ababa. She requested permission to go to Gondar in November 1917 to end her days, but was refused; she died three months later. She is buried next to her husband at the Taeka Negest Ba&#x27;eta Le Mariam Monastery in Addis Ababa.

<doc id="531483" wikidata="Q1174641" url="?curid=531483" title="David Koch">
<text>David Hamilton Koch ( ; May 3, 1940 – August 23, 2019) was an American businessman, political activist, philanthropist, and chemical engineer. In 1970, he joined the family business: Koch Industries, the second largest privately held company in the United States. He became president of the subsidiary Koch Engineering in 1979 and became a co-owner of Koch Industries (along with elder brother Charles) in 1983. Koch served as an executive vice president of Koch Industries until he retired due to health issues in 2018.

Koch was a libertarian. He was the 1980 Libertarian candidate for Vice President of the United States and helped finance the campaign. He founded Citizens for a Sound Economy and donated to advocacy groups and political campaigns, most of which were Republican. Koch became a Republican in 1984; in 2012, he spent over $100 million in a failed bid to oppose the re-election of President Barack Obama.

Koch was the fourth-richest person in the United States in 2012 and was the wealthiest resident of New York City in 2013. As of June 2019, Koch was ranked as the 11th-richest person in the world (tied with his brother Charles), with a fortune of $50.5 billion. Koch contributed to the Lincoln Center, Sloan Kettering, NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital, and the Dinosaur Wing at the American Museum of Natural History. The New York State Theater at Lincoln Center, home of the New York City Ballet, was renamed the David H. Koch Theater in 2008 following Koch&#x27;s gift of $100 million for the renovation of the theater.

== Early life and education ==
Koch was born in Wichita, Kansas, the son of Mary Clementine (née Robinson) and Fred Chase Koch, a chemical engineer. David&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Harry Koch, was a Dutch immigrant who founded the &quot;Quanah Tribune-Chief&quot; newspaper and was a founding shareholder of the Quanah, Acme and Pacific Railway. David was the third of four sons, with elder brothers Frederick, Charles, and nineteen-minute-younger twin Bill. His maternal ancestors included William Ingraham Kip, an Episcopal bishop; and Elizabeth Clementine Stedman, a writer.

Koch attended the Deerfield Academy prep school in Massachusetts, graduating in 1959. He attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), earning both a bachelor&#x27;s (1962) and a master&#x27;s degree (1963) in chemical engineering. He was a member of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity. Koch played basketball at MIT, averaging 21 points per game at MIT over three years, a school record. He also held the single-game scoring record of 41 points from 1962 until 2009, when it was eclipsed by Jimmy Bartolotta.

== Role at Koch Industries ==
In 1970, Koch joined Koch Industries under his brother Charles, to work as a technical-services manager. He founded the company&#x27;s New York City office and in 1979 he became the president of his own division, Koch Engineering, renamed Chemical Technology Group. David&#x27;s brothers Frederick and Bill had inherited stock in Koch Industries. In June 1983, after a bitter legal and boardroom battle, the stakes of Frederick and Bill were bought out for $1.1 billion and Charles Koch and David Koch became majority owners in the company. Legal disputes against Charles and David lasted roughly two decades. Frederick and Bill sided with J. Howard Marshall III, J. Howard Marshall II&#x27;s eldest son, against Charles and David at one point, in order to take over the company. In 2001, Bill reached a settlement in a lawsuit where he had charged the company was taking oil from federal and Indian land; that settlement ended all litigation between the brothers. CBS News reported that Koch Industries settled for $25 million.

As of 2010, David Koch owned 42 percent of Koch Industries, as did his brother Charles. He held four U.S. patents. Koch served as an executive vice president of Koch Industries until retiring due to health issues in 2018. His retirement was announced on June 5, 2018.

== Political involvement ==
===Campaigns===

Koch was the Libertarian Party&#x27;s vice-presidential candidate in the 1980 presidential election, sharing the party ticket with presidential candidate Ed Clark. The Clark–Koch ticket proposed to abolish Social Security, the Federal Reserve Board, welfare, minimum-wage laws, corporate taxes, all price supports and subsidies for agriculture and business, and U.S. Federal agencies including the SEC, EPA, ICC, FTC, OSHA, FBI, CIA, and DOE. Their platform proposed privatizing all transportation and inland waterways. The ticket received 921,128 votes, 1% of the total nationwide vote, the Libertarian Party national ticket&#x27;s best showing until 2016 in terms of percentage and its best showing in terms of raw votes until the 2012 presidential election, although that number was surpassed again in 2016. &quot;Compared to what [the Libertarians had] gotten before,&quot; Charles said, &quot;and where we were as a movement or as a political/ideological point of view, that was pretty remarkable, to get 1 percent of the vote.&quot;

After the bid, according to journalist Brian Doherty&#x27;s &quot;Radicals for Capitalism&quot;, Koch viewed politicians as &quot;actors playing out a script&quot;.

Koch credited the 1976 presidential campaign of Roger MacBride as his inspiration for getting involved in politics:

Here was a great guy, advocating all the things I believed in. He wanted less government and taxes, and was talking about repealing all these victimless crime laws that accumulated on the books. I have friends who smoke pot. I know many homosexuals. It&#x27;s ridiculous to treat them as criminals — and here was someone running for president, saying just that.

Koch gave his own vice presidential campaign $100,000 a month after being chosen as Ed Clark&#x27;s running mate. &quot;We&#x27;d like to abolish the Federal Election Commission and all the limits on campaign spending anyway,&quot; Koch said in 1980. When asked why he ran, he replied: &quot;Lord knows I didn&#x27;t need a job, but I believe in what the Libertarians are saying. I suppose if they hadn&#x27;t come along, I could have been a big Republican from Wichita. But hell — &quot;everybody&quot; from Kansas is a Republican.&quot;

In 1984, Koch broke with the Libertarian Party when it supported eliminating all taxes; in a letter to David Bergland, the Libertarian candidate for the 1984 presidential election, Koch referred to Bergland&#x27;s platform as &quot;extreme&quot;, predicting that the country would be thrown into &quot;utter chaos&quot; if it was implemented. Subsequently, Koch shifted the bulk of his financial support to the Republican Party, though he continued to contribute to several Libertarian campaigns in local races. Koch donated to various political campaigns, most of which were Republican. In February 2012, during the Wisconsin gubernatorial recall election, Koch said of Wisconsin governor Scott Walker, &quot;We&#x27;re helping him, as we should. We&#x27;ve gotten pretty good at this over the years. We&#x27;ve spent a lot of money in Wisconsin. We&#x27;re going to spend more,&quot; and said that by &quot;we&quot; he meant Americans for Prosperity.

In 2012, Koch spent over $100 million in a failed bid to oppose the re-election of President Barack Obama.

=== Views ===
Koch supported policies that promoted smaller government and lower taxes. He was against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Koch said he wasn&#x27;t sure if global warming was anthropogenic, and thought a warmer planet would be &quot;good&quot;, with lengthened growing seasons mitigating problems caused by disappearing coastlines and mass migrations. &quot;Earth will be able to support enormously more people, because a far greater land area will be available to produce food&quot;. Koch opposed the Iraq War, saying that the war has &quot;cost a lot of money and it&#x27;s taken so many American lives&quot;, and &quot;I question whether that was the right thing to do. In hindsight that looks like it was not a good policy.&quot; In an impromptu interview with the blog ThinkProgress, he was quoted as saying he would like the new, 2011 Republican Congress to &quot;cut the hell out of spending, balance the budget, reduce regulations, and support business&quot;. Koch considered himself a social liberal who supported women&#x27;s right to choose, gay rights, same-sex marriage and stem-cell research. He opposed the war on drugs.

Koch opposed several of President Barack Obama&#x27;s policies. An article from the &quot;Weekly Standard&quot;, detailing the &quot;left&#x27;s obsession&quot; with the Koch brothers, quotes Koch stating that Obama is &quot;the most radical president we&#x27;ve ever had as a nation ... and has done more damage to the free enterprise system and long-term prosperity than any president we&#x27;ve ever had&quot;. Koch said that Obama&#x27;s father&#x27;s economic socialism, practiced in Kenya, explains why Obama has &quot;sort of antibusiness and anti-free enterprise&quot; influences. Koch said that Obama is &quot;scary&quot;, a &quot;hardcore socialist&quot; who is &quot;marvelous at pretending to be something other than that&quot;. Koch contributed almost entirely to Republican candidates in 2012.

=== Advocacy ===
Koch donated funds to various advocacy groups. In 1984, he founded Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE). He served as its chairman of the board of directors and donated funds to it. Richard H. Fink served as its first president. Koch was the chairman of the board and gave initial funding to the Americans for Prosperity Foundation and to a related advocacy organization, Americans for Prosperity. A Koch Industries spokesperson issued a press release stating &quot;No funding has been provided by Koch companies, the Koch foundations, or Charles Koch or David Koch specifically to support the tea parties.&quot; Koch was the top initial funder of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation at $850,000. Koch said that he sympathized with the Tea Party movement, but denied directly supporting it, having stated that: &quot;I&#x27;ve never been to a tea party event. No one representing the tea party has ever even approached me.&quot;

Koch sat on the board of the libertarian Cato Institute and Reason Foundation and donated to both organizations. The Koch brothers have been involved in blocking regulations and legislation to confront climate change since 1991, when the Cato Institute held the &quot;Global Environmental Crisis: Science or Politics?&quot; According to &quot;NPR&quot;, the Koch brothers gave &quot;over $145 million to climate-change denying think tanks and advocacy groups between 1997 and 2018.&quot;

In August 2010, Jane Mayer wrote an article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; on the political spending of David and Charles Koch. It stated: &quot;As their fortunes grew, Charles and David Koch became the primary underwriters of hard-line libertarian politics in America.&quot; An opinion piece by journalist Yasha Levine in &quot;The New York Observer&quot; said Mayer&#x27;s article had failed to mention that the Kochs&#x27; &quot;free market philanthropy belies the immense profit they have made from corporate welfare&quot;.

In 2011, 2014, and 2015 &quot;Time&quot; magazine included Charles and David Koch among the &quot;Time&quot; 100 of the year, for their involvement in supporting the Tea Party movement and the criticism they received.

==== Prison reform ====
In July 2015, David and Charles Koch were commended by both President Obama and activist Anthony Van Jones for their bipartisan efforts to reform the prison system in the United States. For nearly 10 years, the Kochs advocated for several reforms within the criminal justice system which include reducing recidivism rates, simplifying the employment process for the rehabilitated, and defending private property from government seizures through asset forfeiture. Allying with groups such as the ACLU, the Center for American Progress, Families Against Mandatory Minimums, the Coalition for Public Safety, and the MacArthur Foundation, the Kochs maintained that current prison system unfairly targeted low-income and minority communities at the expense of the public budget.

The Koch brothers&#x27; advocacy has also attracted scrutiny and criticism. Michelle Chen, writing in &quot;The Nation&quot;, and William C. Anderson, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, caution that the Kochs&#x27; efforts reflect broader interests in further privatizing the criminal justice system. In 2015, &quot;The Intercept&quot; reported that the Kochs&#x27; philanthropic efforts exist alongside continued funding of &quot;tough-on-crime&quot; political candidates and committees pushing for harsher sentencing. Writing in &quot;Political Research Associates&quot;, Kay Whitlock argues that the Kochs&#x27; avid support for measures such as mens rea or &quot;criminal intent&quot; reform exemplify &quot;an agenda of deregulation and relief for &#x27;overcriminalized&#x27; corporations and executives&quot; rather than concern for individual rights of the accused.

== Philanthropy ==
Koch established the David H. Koch Charitable Foundation. Beginning in 2006, the &quot;Chronicle of Philanthropy&quot; listed Koch as one of the world&#x27;s top 50 philanthropists. He sat on the Board of Trustees of NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital from 1988 until his death in 2019.

Overall, Koch has donated more than $1.3 billion to philanthropic causes.

=== Arts ===
Koch had a lifelong interest in the arts, which he attributed to his mother&#x27;s role in introducing him to opera and ballet during his childhood. In July 2008, Koch pledged $100 million over 10 years to renovate the New York State Theater in the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts; the Theater is the home of the New York City Ballet. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Koch&#x27;s gift was &quot;transformative, enabling a full-scale renovation of the stage&quot; that included &quot;an enlarged orchestra pit that mechanically rises&quot;. The theater was renamed the David H. Koch Theater. Koch also pledged $10 million to renovate fountains outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He was elected to the Board of Trustees of The Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2008.

Koch was the longest-serving trustee of the American Ballet Theatre, serving on its board for 25 years and contributing more than $6 million to the theater. He was also a member of the Board of Trustees of WGBH-TV.

=== Education ===
From 1982 to 2013, Koch contributed $18.6 million to WGBH Educational Foundation, including $10 million to the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) show &quot;Nova&quot;. Koch was a contributor to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., including a $20 million gift to the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), creating the David H. Koch Dinosaur Wing and a contribution of $15 million to the National Museum of Natural History to create the new &quot;David H. Koch Hall of Human Origins&quot;, which opened on the museum&#x27;s 100th anniversary of its location on the National Mall on March 17, 2010. Koch served on the advisory council for the Smithsonian and the board of the AMNH. He also served on the executive board of the Institute of Human Origins. In 2012, Koch contributed US$35 million to the Smithsonian to build a new dinosaur exhibition hall at the National Museum of Natural History.

Koch was also a benefactor of the Deerfield Academy, his alma mater. The academy&#x27;s natatorium, science center, and field house are named after him. Koch was named the academy&#x27;s first Lifetime Trustee.

=== Medical research ===
Koch said his biggest contributions go toward a &quot;moon shot&quot; campaign to finding the cure for cancer, according to his profile on Forbes. Between 1998 and 2012, Koch contributed at least $395 million to medical research causes and institutions.

Koch has sat on the Board of Trustees of NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital since 1987. In 2007 he donated $15 million to NewYork–Presbyterian. In 2013, he gave $100 million to NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital, the then-largest philanthropic donation in its history, beginning a $2 billion campaign, to conclude in 2019, for a new ambulatory care center and renovation of the infrastructure of the hospital&#x27;s five sites.

Koch was a member of the board of directors of the Prostate Cancer Foundation and contributed $41 million to the foundation, including $5 million to a collaborative project in the field of nanotechnology. An eponym of the David H. Koch Chair of the Prostate Cancer Foundation, the position is held by Dr. Jonathan Simons.

In 2006, Koch gave $20 million to Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore for cancer research. The building he financed was named the David H. Koch Cancer Research Building.

In 2007, he contributed $100 million to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for the construction of a new research and technology facility to serve as the home of the David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. From the time he joined the MIT Corporation in 1988, Koch has given at least $185 million to MIT, and $30 million to the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. The same year, he donated $25 million to the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston to establish the David Koch Center for Applied Research in Genitourinary Cancers.

In 2011 Koch gave $5 million to the House Ear Institute, in Los Angeles, to create a center for hearing restoration, and $25 million to the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City

In 2015, he committed $150 million to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City to build the David H. Koch Center for Cancer Care, which will be housed in a 23-story building in development between East 73rd and 74th Streets overlooking the FDR Drive. The center will combine state-of-the-art cancer treatment in an environment that supports patients, families, and caregivers. The building will include flexible personal and community spaces, educational offerings, and opportunities for physical exercise. Koch also donated $10 million to the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory for biomathematics research.

== Wealth ==
Koch was the fourth-richest person in the United States in 2012 and was the wealthiest resident of New York City in 2013. As of June 2019, Koch was ranked as the 11th-richest person in the world (tied with his brother Charles), with a fortune of $50.5 billion.

== Personal life ==

In February 1991, Koch was seriously injured as a passenger on board USAir Flight 1493 when it collided with another aircraft on a runway at Los Angeles International Airport, killing 35 people. Koch survived and said in an interview in 2014 that it helped change his life and prompted him to become &quot;tremendously philanthropic.&quot;

Following Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis&#x27; death in 1994, Koch purchased her 15-room apartment at 1040 Fifth Avenue. In 1996 he married Julia Flesher. The apartment &quot;wasn&#x27;t roomy enough&quot; after the birth of their third child, so Koch sold it to billionaire Glenn Dubin in 2006 and moved with his family to 740 Park Avenue. They had three children together; David Jr., Mary Julia, and John. Mary Julia is a staff reporter for &quot;The New York Sun&quot;, and was editor-in-chief of &quot;The Harvard Independent&quot;.

===Health and death===
In 1992, Koch was diagnosed with prostate cancer. He underwent radiation, surgery, and hormone therapy, but the cancer repeatedly returned. Koch said he believed his experience with cancer encouraged him to fund medical research.

Koch died at his home in Southampton, New York, on August 23, 2019, at the age of 79. Koch&#x27;s wife, Julia Koch, and their three children inherited a 42% stake in Koch Industries from Koch upon his death.

<text>The First Saturdays Devotion, also called theCommunion of Reparation to the Immaculate Heart of the Blessed Virgin Mary, is a Catholic devotion which, according to Sister Lúcia of Fátima, was requested by the Virgin Mary during the apparitions of Our Lady of Fátima in Fátima, Portugal, on 13 May 1917 and during an apparition in Pontevedra, Spain, on 10 December 1925. The purpose of this devotion is to perform acts of reparation to the Immaculate Heart of Mary and a promise of assistance at the hour of death by Mary was reportedly attached to this devotion during the Pontevedra apparition.

==History==

The pious practice of honoring the Blessed Mother on Saturday is an ancient custom largely attributed to the Benedictine monk Alcuin (735-804), &quot;Minister of Education&quot; at the court of Charlemagne, who composed a Votive Mass formulary for each day of the week. Alcuin assigned two formularies to Saturday in honor of Mary. The practice was quickly adopted by both clergy and laity.

The practice of reparation to the Immaculate Heart of Mary on the First Saturday was initiated in Rovigo, Italy, by Maria Dolores Inglese, a Servite tertiary in 1889. She started among her friends the pious practice of &quot;Communion in Reparation to the Immaculate Heart of Mary&quot;. The practice was endorsed by Bishop Antonio Polin of the Diocese of Adria and was taken up by sodalities throughout Italy and elsewhere. On July 1, 1905, Pope Pius X approved and granted indulgences for the practice of the First Saturdays of twelve consecutive months in honor of the Immaculate Conception. This practice greatly resembled the reported request of the Blessed Virgin Mary at the Pontevedra apparitions.

Inglese wished to establish a religious congregation dedicated to the apostolate of Marian reparation. Bishop Tommaso Pio Boggiani recommended that she join the Servite sisters, known for their devotion to Our Lady of Sorrows. She joined the Servites as Sister Maria Dolores in 1911. She and foundress Mother Mary Elisa Andreoli revised the rule, making propagation of Communion of Reparation on the First Saturday of each month the congregation&#x27;s main apostolate. They also changed the name of the group from &quot;Servants of Mary&quot; to &quot;Servants of Mary of Reparation&quot;. The sisters also published a monthly magazine that helped spread the devotion throughout Europe.

== Fátima ==

At the age of 10, Lúcia dos Santos, one of the three Portuguese seers of the Marian apparitions of Our Lady of Fátima, reported in her 1941 memoir that Mary asked the following during the third apparition in Fátima on 13 July 1917.The war is going to end. But if people do not stop offending God, another, even worse one will begin in the reign of Pius XI. When you shall see a night illuminated by an unknown light know that this is the great sign that God gives you that He is going to punish the world for its many crimes by means of war, hunger, and persecution of the Church and the Holy Father. To prevent it, I shall come to ask for the consecration of Russia to my Immaculate Heart and the Communion of reparation on the first Saturdays.According to Lúcia, this is the first reported request for a First Saturdays Devotion directly from Mary and she was &quot;to return&quot; and ask to establish the devotion. This was part of the message of Our Lady of Fátima and requested in order to prevent the World War II from happening. The purpose of this devotion is to perform acts of reparation for sins committed against the Immaculate Heart of Mary. 

In 1939, she also wrote: “Whether the world has war or peace depends on the practice of this devotion, along with the consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary.”

==Pontevedra==
Four years later, Lúcia dos Santos was admitted at the age of 14 as a boarder to the school of the Sisters of Saint Dorothy in Vilar, near the city of Porto. 

On 24 October 1925, she entered the Institute of the Sisters of Saint Dorothy as a postulant in the convent in Tui, Spain, just across the northern Portuguese border.

According to a document she wrote and as recorded in her book “Fatima in Lucia’s Own Words”, Sister Lúcia later reported that on 10 December 1925, the Virgin Mary appeared to her at the Dorothean convent in Pontevedra, and by her side on a luminous cloud was the Child Jesus. According to Lúcia, Mary requested the institution of the Devotion of the Five First Saturdays in reparation to her Immaculate Heart and attached a personal promise to the devotion:Look, My daughter, at My Heart, surrounded with thorns with which ungrateful men pierce Me at every moment by their blasphemies and ingratitude. You at least try to console Me and announce in My name that I promise to assist at the moment of death, with all the graces necessary for salvation, all those who, on the first Saturday of five consecutive months, shall confess, receive Holy Communion, recite five decades of the Rosary, and keep Me company for fifteen minutes while meditating on the fifteen mysteries of the Rosary, with the intention of making reparation to Me.Devotees of Fátima believe that the First Saturdays help to console the sorrows of God, Jesus, and the Virgin Mary for the sins against her Immaculate Heart.

== Practice ==
The First Saturdays Devotion consists of several practices that are performed on five consecutive first Saturdays of the month, with the intention of making reparation for sins against the Immaculate Heart of Mary.

# Go to Sacramental confession (may be before or after the first Saturday, as long as in a state of grace to receive Communion)
# Receive Holy Communion
# Pray five decades of the Rosary
# Meditate on one or more of the mysteries of the Rosary for 15 minutes (in addition to the recitation of the Rosary)

According to Lúcia dos Santos, this devotion shall be done with the intention of making reparation for sins against the Immaculate Heart of Mary and a promise of assistance at the hour of death and all the graces necessary for salvation was made by Mary during the Pontevedra apparition on 10 December 1925.

<doc id="531488" wikidata="Q1325962" url="?curid=531488" title="Gallatin River">
<text>The Gallatin River is a tributary of the Missouri River, approximately 120 mi (193 km) long, in the U.S. states of Wyoming and Montana. It is one of three rivers, along with the Jefferson and Madison, that converge near Three Forks, Montana, to form the Missouri.

It originates in the northwest corner of Yellowstone National Park in northwestern Wyoming, in the Gallatin Range of the Rocky Mountains. It flows northwest through Gallatin National Forest, past Big Sky, Montana, and joins the Jefferson and Madison approximately 30 mi (48 km) northwest of Bozeman.
U.S. Highway 191 follows the river from the Wyoming border to just outside Bozeman.

The river was named in July 1805 by Meriwether Lewis at Three Forks. The eastern fork of the three, it was named for Albert Gallatin, the U.S. Treasury Secretary from 1801–14. The western fork was named for President Thomas Jefferson and the central fork for Secretary of State James Madison.

The Gallatin River is one of the best whitewater runs in the Yellowstone-Teton Area. In June, when the snowmelt is released from the mountains, the river has a class IV section called the &quot;Mad Mile&quot;. This section is over a mile long and contains continuous stretches of challenging whitewater. Rafting companies offer trips on this river – on the Mad Mile Section as well as other, less challenging sections.

The Gallatin River is an amazingly scenic river – winding through high alpine meadows, dropping into the rocky Gallatin Canyon, and flowing out into the Gallatin Valley. It is an exceptionally popular fly fishing destination for rainbow trout, brown trout and mountain whitefish. Portions of the river are designated as a Blue Ribbon trout stream while the remainder is designated Red Ribbon by the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks Department. The river is closed to fishing from boats from Yellowstone Park to the confluence with the East Gallatin River.

The river is a Class I water from the Taylor Fork to its confluence with the Missouri for the purposes of public recreational access.

== History ==

The history of the canyon mirrors much of the activity during the late 1800 and early 1900s in southwestern Montana. The canyon was first explored by Native American hunters, and later fur-trappers and gold prospectors. There was a significant amount of consideration given to the idea of running the railroad through the canyon to increase travel between Yellowstone National Park and Bozeman, Montana. Logging was conducted in the canyon at the turn of the 20th century, and loggers would ride the logs down river to prevent them from jamming.

Pete Karst moved into the canyon in 1898 to homestead a ranch, and ran everything from an inn for travelers to serving liquor he made on the premise during Prohibition days. His most successful endeavor in the canyon was a bus route he ran in 1924 from Salesville (now Gallatin Gateway) to Yellowstone National Park. &quot;Karst Camp&quot;, as it came to be known, was home to the first tow rope ski hill in Montana, and held annual ski jumping competitions.

<doc id="531490" wikidata="Q548379" url="?curid=531490" title="SWIG">
<text>The Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator (SWIG) is an open-source software tool used to connect computer programs or libraries written in C or C++ with scripting languages such as Lua, Perl, PHP, Python, R, Ruby, Tcl, and other language implementations like C#, Java, JavaScript, Go, D, OCaml, Octave, Scilab and Scheme. Output can also be in the form of XML.

==Function==

The aim is to allow the calling of native functions (that were written in C or C++) by other programming languages, passing complex data types to those functions, keeping memory from being inappropriately freed, inheriting object classes across languages, etc. The programmer writes an interface file containing a list of C/C++ functions to be made visible to an interpreter. SWIG will compile the interface file and generate code in regular C/C++ and the target programming language. SWIG will generate conversion code for functions with simple arguments; conversion code for complex types of arguments must be written by the programmer. The SWIG tool creates source code that provides the glue between C/C++ and the target language. Depending on the language, this glue comes in two forms:
*a shared library that an extant interpreter can link to as some form of extension module, or
*a shared library that can be linked to other programs compiled in the target language (for example, using Java Native Interface (JNI) in Java).
*a shared dynamic library source code that should be compiled and dynamically loaded (e.g. Node.js native extensions)

SWIG is not used for calling interpreted functions by native code; this must be done by the programmer manually.

== Example ==
SWIG wraps simple C declarations by creating an interface that closely matches the way in which the declarations would be used in a C program. For example, consider the following interface file:

%module example

%inline %{
extern double sin(double x);
extern int strcmp(const char *, const char *);
extern int Foo;
#define STATUS 50
#define VERSION &quot;1.1&quot;

In this file, there are two functions and , a global variable , and two constants and . When SWIG creates an extension module, these declarations are accessible as scripting language functions, variables, and constants respectively. In Python:

»&gt; example.sin(3)
0.141120008
»&gt; example.strcmp(&#x27;Dave&#x27;,&#x27;Mike&#x27;)
-1
»&gt; print(example.cvar.Foo)
42
»&gt; print(example.STATUS)
50
»&gt; print(example.VERSION)
1.1
==Purpose==
There are two main reasons to embed a scripting engine in an existing C/C++ program:
*The program can then be customized far faster, via a scripting language instead of C/C++. The scripting engine may even be exposed to the end-user, so that they can automate common tasks by writing scripts.
*Even if the final product is not to contain the scripting engine, it may nevertheless be very useful for writing test scripts.

There are several reasons to create dynamic libraries that can be loaded into extant interpreters, including:
*Provide access to a C/C++ library which has no equivalent in the scripting language.
*Write the whole program in the scripting language first, and after profiling, rewrite performance-critical code in C or C++.

==History==
SWIG is written in C and C++ and has been publicly available since February 1996. The initial author and main developer was David M. Beazley who developed SWIG while working as a graduate student at Los Alamos National Laboratory and the University of Utah and while on the faculty at the University of Chicago. Development is currently supported by an active group of volunteers led by William Fulton. SWIG has been released under a GNU General Public License.

==Google Summer of Code==
SWIG was a successful participant of Google Summer of Code in 2008, 2009, 2012. In 2008, SWIG got four slots. Haoyu Bai spent his summers on SWIG&#x27;s Python 3.0 Backend, Jan Jezabek worked on Support for generating COM wrappers, Cheryl Foil spent her time on Comment &#x27;Translator&#x27; for SWIG, and Maciej Drwal worked on a C backend.
In 2009, SWIG again participated in Google Summer of Code. This time four students participated. Baozeng Ding worked on a Scilab module. Matevz Jekovec spent time on C++0x features. Ashish Sharma spent his summer on an Objective-C module, Miklos Vajna spent his time on PHP directors.

In 2012, SWIG participated in Google Summer of Code. This time four out of five students successfully completed the project. Leif Middelschulte worked on a C target language module. Swati Sharma enhanced the Objective-C module. Neha Narang added the new module on JavaScript. Dmitry Kabak worked on source code documentation and Doxygen comments.

==Alternatives==
For Python, similar functionality is offered by SIP, Pybind11, and Boost&#x27;s Boost.python library.

<doc id="531501" wikidata="Q1401202" url="?curid=531501" title="Negroni">
<text>The negroni is a cocktail, made of equal parts gin, vermouth rosso (red, semi-sweet), and Campari, generally served on the rocks, and commonly garnished with an orange slice or orange peel. It is considered an apéritif.

The drink has been documented in Italy since the late 1940s, and became popular in the 1950s, but the origin is uncertain, and early recipes differ somewhat from the modern standard. The basic recipe – an equal-parts cocktail of these three ingredients – is first recorded in French cocktail books of the late 1920s, alongside many similar drinks; in Italy a long drink of equal parts vermouth and Campari (but no gin), topped with soda and served over ice, has existed since the 1800s under the names Milano–Torino or Americano. There are claims of Italian drinks by the name &quot;Negroni&quot; containing gin from 1919, though these differ significantly from the modern drink; see for details.

==Technique==

The IBA recipe for the negroni specifies that it be built over ice in an old-fashioned or rocks glass and garnished with a slice of orange, similar to an old fashioned or spritz (short, minus the soda).

Common variations include using an orange peel (or lemon peel) in place of an orange slice (especially outside Italy), stirring then pouring over ice, and sometimes stirring and serving straight up.

==History==
The drink&#x27;s origins are not known with certainty, and one must distinguish the modern recipe (an equal-parts cocktail of gin, vermouth rosso, and Campari, served over ice) from the name &quot;negroni&quot;. See surveys and Difford.

To summarize, the documentary evidence is consistent with the drink originating as a short, American-style cocktail in 1920s France, like its well-documented contemporary, the old pal (and similar cocktails such as the boulevardier), and was most popular in the 1930s and early 1940s as a 2:1:1 drink, served up, called the &quot;Campariete&quot;. In the late 1940s the short drink then acquired the name &quot;negroni&quot; from a separate, similar long Italian-style drink of vermouth and soda, with small amounts of Campari and gin, served over ice; or from a variant of the Milano–Torino or Americano, equal parts vermouth and Campari, with a small amount of gin, plus soda, served over ice. By the mid-1950s the preferred name was &quot;negroni&quot; and the preferred ratio was 1:1:1, served over ice but without soda.

===Recipe===
The earliest known attestation of a drink with the same ingredients and proportions (1:1:1) as the modern recipe is from the French cocktail book , where it is referred to as &quot;Campari Mixte&quot;, and the recipe is given as:
:Dans un shaker, avec de la glace en morceaux, un tiers de Campari, un tiers de Gin, un tiers de Vermouth italien, bien mélanger et servir avec un zeste de citron.
::In a shaker, with pieces of ice, a third of Campari, a third of gin, a third of Italian vermouth, mix well and serve with a lemon zest.

This differs from the modern IBA recipe in a few respects: it is shaken, not built; it is presumably served straight up (implied for cocktails), not down on the rocks; and it is garnished with a lemon twist, not an orange slice. All of these make it closer to a standard American-style cocktail than an Italian-style drink.

A similar recipe of 2:1:1 gin, vermouth, and Campari is attested from the Parisian book as the &quot;Camparinete&quot;, where it is credited to Albert of the [Hôtel] Chatam (Chatham hotel), and specifies Cora brand vermouth and a lemon zest. The same book credits Albert of the Chatham bar with the Rose, though that is attested years earlier by another bartender at the same bar, so it is not clear if Albert originated this variant of the drink, or simply represented the bar in this collection.

This drink is listed in numerous American, French, and Spanish cocktail books of the 1930s and 1940s, including (shaken, twist lemon peel over), , and &quot;Trader Vic&#x27;s Bartender&#x27;s Guide&quot; (1947). credits the drink to Albert of Chatam, Paris (presumably from ), and specifies that it be shaken, and served up (in a coupe). In , this 1:1:2 cocktail is referred to as “Negroni-Cocktail”, and is given as:
:Negroni-Cocktail
:¼ de vermut italiano, 2/4 de Campari, ¼ de Gin.
::¼ Italian vermouth, 2/4 Campari, ¼ gin.

Notably, Brucart refers to the same recipe as &quot;Campariete&quot; in 1943 and &quot;Negroni&quot; in 1949, attaching a new name to an existing drink.

There is no known recipe for a &quot;negroni&quot; or an equal-parts drink of gin, vermouth, and Campari in Italian cocktail books before the 1940s. For example, the encyclopedic contains 1,000 recipes, including several with Campari (two versions of the Milano–Torino and a dozen versions of the Americano), but no negroni or gin/vermouth/Campari drink.

The earliest known recipe for a &quot;negroni&quot; in an Italian text is in , where it is given as:
:&quot;Nel bicchiere de acqua:&quot; un pezzo di ghiacco - ⅓ Bitter Campari - ⅓ Vermouth Grassotti rosso - ⅓ Gin - 1 buccia d&#x27;arancia; &quot;servite con del selz.&quot;
::&quot;In a water glass:&quot; one piece of ice - ⅓ Campari Bitters - ⅓ red Grassotti Vermouth - ⅓ Gin - 1 orange peel; &quot;serve with seltzer.&quot;

This differs from the modern recipe in being a long drink, served with seltzer, rather than a short drink; and being garnished with an orange peel, rather than an orange slice. It is similar to the modern drink (and differs from the earlier French recipes) in being built and served with ice, rather than being shaken or stirred and served up.

The same text includes a variant, &quot;Asmara o Negroni&quot; (Asmara or Negroni), referencing the city of Asmara, the (by then former) capital of Italian Eritrea, with recipe closer to a martini, just with Campari as the bitter (and orange twist instead of lemon twist):
:&quot;Nel mixing-glass:&quot; qualche goccia di Bitter Campari - ⅔ Gordon Gin - ⅓ Vermouth Grassotti bianco - buccia d&#x27;arancia; &quot;scuotete bene e servite nel Cocktail-glass n. 8.&quot;
::&quot;In a mixing glass:&quot; a few drops of Campari Bitter - ⅔ Gordon Gin - ⅓ white Grassotti Vermouth - orange peel; &quot;shake well and serve in a n. 8 [number 8] cocktail glass.&quot;

An equal-parts cocktail called &quot;Negroni&quot; is attested in the British text , where the recipe is given as:
:Negroni
::1/3 Dry Gin.
::1/3 Sweet Vermouth.
::1/3 Campari Bitters.
::Stir and Strain.
::Add Twist of Lemon Peel.

This is almost identical to the &quot;Campari Mixte&quot; (1929), except that it is stirred, not shaken. It still differs from the modern negroni in being stirred, not built; implicitly served up, not on the rocks; and garnished with a lemon twist, not an orange slice.

===In popular culture===
The earliest reports in English are from traveler writers to Italy and the Mediterranean, and describe a long drink based on vermouth and soda, with the addition of small amounts of Campari, gin, and sometimes Angostura bitters, similar to a vermouth-based spritz.

One of the earliest reports of a drink by the name &quot;Negroni&quot; came from Orson Welles in correspondence with the &quot;Coshocton Tribune&quot; while working in Rome on &quot;Cagliostro&quot; in 1947, where he described a new drink called the Negroni, &quot;The bitters are excellent for your liver, the gin is bad for you. They balance each other.&quot;

Later, more detailed descriptions are given in Horace Sutton, &quot;Footloose in Italy&quot; (1950), and Rupert Croft-Cooke, &quot;Tangerine House&quot; (1956, p. 108), which gives the description:
:You shake a dash of Angostura over a lump of ice in a large glass, add about a teaspoonful of Campari bitters, a wineglass-full of vermouth, a little gin, a shaving of lemon peel, then fill up with soda water.

===Name===

The name &quot;Negroni&quot; is an Italian surname, and the drink is presumably named after some person of this name. Numerous persons claim to have invented the cocktail or to have had it named after them, though these lack contemporary sources.

The most widely reported account is that it was first mixed in Florence, Italy, in 1919, at Caffè Casoni (now Caffè Giacosa), on Via de&#x27; Tornabuoni, by bartender Fosco Scarselli, for his customer Count Camillo Negroni; see . The commonly-held origin story is that it was concocted by a member of the Negroni family asking the bartender to strengthen the Americano by adding gin, rather than the normal soda water. The bartender also added an orange garnish rather than the typical lemon garnish of the Americano to signify that it was a different drink. Cocktail historian David Wondrich researched Camillo Negroni, whose status as a count is questionable, but whose grandfather, Luigi Negroni, was indeed a count. The year 1919 may be a confusion with the amaro today sold as Old 1919 (Antico Negroni 1919); see below.

An implausible story is that it was invented by Pascal Olivier de Negroni, Count de Negroni in 1857 in Senegal; this has been circulated by his descendants, and is impossible, as Campari did not exist until 1860. A &quot;Corse-Matin&quot; Sunday Edition article from 1980 says he invented the drink around 1914; which is again impossible, as he died in 1913.

An unrelated person, Cavaliere (Knight) Guglielmo Negroni, founded Negroni Distillerie in Treviso, Italy in 1919, and produced a red amaro, now sold as Old 1919 (Antico Negroni 1919). There is no evidence that this is related to the modern Campari-based cocktail, though the prominent &quot;1919&quot; may be why that year is given as the origin of the cocktail.

===Precursors===
Andrew Willett believes that this drink originated in San Francisco, where Campari was first imported to the United States (presumably due to the Italian American population in North Beach, San Francisco), between 1904 (when Campari began to be mass produced) and 1920 (when Prohibition started) as a modification of the martini, replacing orange bitters with Campari. Like the martini, this drink consists of Italian ingredients (vermouth, Campari) mixed with gin in an American-style cocktail. He finds an Italian origin implausible, as at the time the spirits-based cocktails popular in the United States were not made in Italy; they were considered American style, as seen in the American Bar (London, 1893), Harry&#x27;s New York Bar (Paris, 1911), and Harry&#x27;s Bar (Venice, 1931).

==Variations==

<text>HMS &quot;Spartan&quot; was a nuclear-powered fleet submarine of the Royal Navy&#x27;s . &quot;Spartan&quot; was launched on 7 April 1978 by Lady Lygo, wife of Admiral Sir Raymond Lygo. The boat was built by Vickers Limited Shipbuilding Group (now a division of BAE Systems) at Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, England. She was decommissioned in January 2006.

==Operational history==

&quot;Spartan&quot; was ordered to sail south for the Falkland Islands two days before the Argentine invasion of the islands on 30 March 1982. &quot;Spartan&quot; was the first vessel to arrive in the islands and began to enforce a maritime exclusion zone imposed by the British. Shortly after, &quot;Spartan&quot; sighted Argentine merchant shipping mining the harbour at Stanley, but was not ordered to attack. This was partly due to British concerns about escalating the war too early, but also to avoid scaring off more lucrative targets such as the Argentine aircraft carrier . On 1 May, &quot;Spartan&quot; was marking &quot;Veinticinco de Mayo&quot;, from just outside the Argentinian limit, when the submarine was ordered away by the Northwood fleet command in England, rejecting the strong view of the task force commander, Admiral Woodward. He considered, as the highest ranking naval officer in the area, he should control the RN submarines in the area and potentially faced losing the war by the lack of local control in the battle zone In the following days &quot;Veinticinco de Mayo&quot; was therefore able to move, unchecked by the British nuclear submarines, and potentially launch an A-4Q Skyhawk attack from much closer range than possible from Argentinian airfields. Unlike , &quot;Spartan&quot; did not during the Falklands War, though she did provide valuable reconnaissance to the British Task Force on Argentine aircraft movements.

In November 2010, it was reported in Hansard that &quot;Spartan&quot; had run aground off the west coast of Scotland in October 1989.

In 1999, &quot;Spartan&quot; was fitted with Tomahawk cruise missiles.

<doc id="531505" wikidata="Q830900" url="?curid=531505" title="Horseshoe bat">
<text>Horseshoe bats are bats in the family Rhinolophidae. In addition to the single living genus, Rhinolophus, which has about 106 species, the extinct genus &quot;Palaeonycteris&quot; has been recognized. Horseshoe bats are closely related to the Old World leaf-nosed bats, family Hipposideridae, which have sometimes been included in Rhinolophidae. The horseshoe bats are divided into six subgenera and many species groups. The most recent common ancestor of all horseshoe bats lived 34–40 million years ago, though it is unclear where the geographic roots of the family are, and attempts to determine its biogeography have been indecisive. Their taxonomy is complex, as genetic evidence shows the likely existence of many cryptic species, as well as species recognized as distinct that may have little genetic divergence from previously recognized taxa. They are found in the Old World, mostly in tropical or subtropical areas, including Africa, Asia, Europe, and Oceania.

Horseshoe bats are considered small or medium-sized microbats, weighing , with forearm lengths of and combined lengths of head and body of . The fur, long and smooth in most species, can be reddish-brown, blackish, or bright orange-red. They get their common name from their large nose-leafs, which are shaped like horseshoes. The nose-leafs aid in echolocation; horseshoe bats have highly sophisticated echolocation, using constant frequency calls at high-duty cycles to detect prey in areas of high environmental clutters. They hunt insects and spiders, swooping down on prey from a perch, or gleaning from foliage. Little is known about their mating systems, but at least one species is monogamous, while another is polygynous. Gestation is approximately seven weeks and one offspring is produced at a time. A typical lifespan is six or seven years, but one greater horseshoe bat lived more than thirty years.

Horseshoe bats are relevant to humans in some regions as a source of disease, as food, and for traditional medicine. Several species are the natural reservoirs of various SARS-related coronaviruses, and data strongly suggests they are a reservoir of SARS-CoV, though humans may face more exposure risk from intermediate hosts such as masked palm civets.

They are hunted for food in several regions, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, but also Southeast Asia. Some species or their guano are used in traditional medicine in Nepal, India, Vietnam, and Senegal.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
===Taxonomic history===

&quot;Rhinolophus&quot; was first described as a genus in 1799 by French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède. Initially, all extant horseshoe bats were in &quot;Rhinolophus&quot;, as well as the species now in &quot;Hipposideros&quot; (roundleaf bats). At first, &quot;Rhinolophus&quot; was within the family Vespertilionidae. In 1825, British zoologist John Edward Gray subdivided Vespertilionidae into subfamilies, including what he called Rhinolophina. English zoologist Thomas Bell is credited as the first to recognize horseshoe bats as a separate family, using Rhinolophidae in 1836. While Bell is sometimes recognized as the authority for Rhinolophidae, the authority is more often given as Gray, 1825. Horseshoe bats are in the superfamily Rhinolophoidea, along with Craseonycteridae, Hipposideridae Megadermatidae, Rhinonycteridae, and Rhinopomatidae.

Attempts were made to divide &quot;Rhinolophus&quot; into other genera. In 1816, English zoologist William Elford Leach proposed the genus name &quot;Phyllorhina&quot;; Gray proposed &quot;Aquias&quot; in 1847 and &quot;Phyllotis&quot; in 1866; and German naturalist Wilhelm Peters proposed &quot;Coelophyllus&quot; in 1867. In 1876, Irish zoologist George Edward Dobson returned all Asiatic horseshoe bats to &quot;Rhinolophus&quot;, additionally proposing the subfamilies Phyllorhininae (for the hipposiderids) and Rhinolophinae. American zoologist Gerrit Smith Miller Jr. further divided the hipposiderids from the horseshoe bats in 1907, recognizing Hipposideridae as a distinct family. Some authors have considered &quot;Hipposideros&quot; and associated genera as part of Rhinolophidae as recently as the early 2000s, though they are now most often recognized as a separate family. After the split into Rhinolophidae and Hipposideridae, further divisions were proposed for &quot;Rhinolophus&quot;, with &quot;Rhinolphyllotis&quot; in 1934 and &quot;Rhinomegalophus&quot; in 1951, though both additional genera were returned to &quot;Rhinolophus&quot;.
Danish mammalogist Knud Andersen was the first to propose species groups for &quot;Rhinolophus&quot;, doing so in 1905. Species groups are a way of clustering species to reflect evolutionary relationships. He recognized six species groups: &quot;R. simplex&quot; (now &quot;R. megaphyllus&quot;), &quot;R. lepidus&quot;, &quot;R. midas&quot; (now &quot;R. hipposideros&quot;), &quot;R. philippinensis&quot;, &quot;R. macrotis&quot;, and &quot;R. arcuatus&quot;. The species have been frequently rearranged among the groups as new groups are added, new species are described, and relationships among species are revised. Fifteen species groups were given by Csorba and colleagues in 2003. Various subgenera have been proposed as well, with six listed by Csorba &quot;et al&quot;. in 2003: &quot;Aquias&quot;, &quot;Phyllorhina&quot;, &quot;Rhinolophus&quot;, &quot;Indorhinolophus&quot;, &quot;Coelophyllus&quot;, and &quot;Rhinophyllotis&quot;. Informally, the rhinolophids can be split into two major clades: the mostly African clade, and the mostly Oriental clade.

===Evolutionary history===
The most recent common ancestor of &quot;Rhinolophus&quot; lived an estimated 34–40 million years ago, splitting from the hipposiderid lineage during the Eocene. Fossilized horseshoe bats are known from Europe (early to mid-Miocene, early Oligocene), Australia (Miocene), and Africa (Miocene and late Pliocene). The biogeography of horseshoe bats is poorly understood. Various studies have proposed that the family originated in Europe, Asia, or Africa. A 2010 study supported an Asian or Oriental origin of the family, with rapid evolutionary radiations of the African and Oriental clades during the Oligocene. A 2019 study found that &quot;R. xinanzhongguoensis&quot; and &quot;R. nippon&quot;, both Eurasian species, are more closely related to African species than to other Eurasian species, suggesting that rhinolophids may have a complex biogeographical relationship with Asia and the Afrotropics.

A 2016 study using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA placed the horseshoe bats within the Yinpterochiroptera as sister to Hipposideridae.

Rhinolophidae is represented by one extant genus, &quot;Rhinolophus&quot;. Both the family and the genus are confirmed as monophyletic (containing all descendants of a common ancestor). As of 2019, there were 106 described species in &quot;Rhinolophus&quot;, making it the second-most speciose genus of bat after &quot;Myotis&quot;. &quot;Rhinolophus&quot; may be undersampled in the Afrotropical realm, with one genetic study estimating that there could be up to twelve cryptic species in the region. Additionally, some taxa recognized as full species have been found to have little genetic divergence. &quot;Rhinolophus kahuzi&quot; may be a synonym for the Ruwenzori horseshoe bat (&quot;R. ruwenzorii&quot;), and &quot;R. gorongosae&quot; or &quot;R. rhodesiae&quot; may be synonyms of the Bushveld horseshoe bat (&quot;R. simulator&quot;). Additionally, Smithers&#x27;s horseshoe bat (&quot;R. smithersi&quot;), Cohen&#x27;s horseshoe bat (&quot;R. cohenae&quot;), and the Mount Mabu horseshoe bat (&quot;R. mabuensis&quot;) all have little genetic divergence from Hildebrandt&#x27;s horseshoe bat (&quot;R. hildebrandtii&quot;). Recognizing the former three as full species leaves Hildebrandt&#x27;s horseshoe bat paraphyletic.

The second genus in Rhinolophidae is the extinct &quot;Palaeonycteris&quot;, with the type species &quot;Palaeonycteris robustus&quot;. &quot;Palaeonycteris robustus&quot; lived during the Lower Miocene and its fossilized remains were found in Saint-Gérand-le-Puy, France.

==Description==
===Appearance===

Horseshoe bats are considered small or medium microbats. Individuals have a head and body length ranging and have forearm lengths of . One of the smaller species, the lesser horseshoe bat (&quot;R. hipposideros&quot;), weighs , while one of the larger species, the greater horseshoe bat (&quot;R. ferrumequinum&quot;), weighs . Fur color is highly variable among species, ranging from blackish to reddish brown to bright orange-red. The underparts are paler than the back fur. The majority of species have long, soft fur, but the woolly and lesser woolly horseshoe bats (&quot;R. luctus&quot; and &quot;R. beddomei&quot;) are unusual in their very long, woolly fur.

Like most bats, horseshoe bats have two mammary glands on their chests. Adult females additionally have two teat-like projections on their abdomens, called pubic nipples or false nipples, which are not connected to mammary glands. Only a few other bat families have pubic nipples, including Hipposideridae, Craseonycteridae, Megadermatidae, and Rhinopomatidae; they serve as attachment points for their offspring. In a few horseshoe bat species, males have a false nipple in each armpit.

===Head and teeth===

All horseshoe bats have large, leaf-like protuberances on their noses, which are called nose-leafs. The nose-leafs are important in species identification, and are composed of several parts. The front of the nose-leaf resembles and is called a horseshoe, earning them the common name of &quot;horseshoe bats&quot;. The horseshoe is above the upper lip and is thin and flat. The lancet is triangular, pointed, and pocketed, and points up between the bats&#x27; eyes. The sella is a flat, ridge-like structure at the center of the nose. It rises from behind the nostrils and points out perpendicular from the head. Their ears are large and leaf-shaped, nearly as broad as they are long, and lack tragi. The antitragi of the ears are conspicuous. Their eyes are very small. The skull always has a rostral inflation, or bony protrusion on the snout. The typical dental formula of a horseshoe bat is , but the middle lower premolars are often missing, as well as the anterior upper premolars (premolars towards the front of the mouth). The young lose their milk teeth while still in utero, with the teeth resorbed into the body. They are born with the four permanent canine teeth erupted, which enables them to cling to their mothers. This is atypical among bat families, as most newborns have at least some milk teeth at birth, which are quickly replaced by the permanent set.

===Postcrania===
Several bones in its thorax are fused—the presternum, first rib, partial second rib, seventh cervical vertebra, first thoracic vertebra—making a solid ring. This fusion is associated with the ability to echolocate while stationary. Except for the first digit, which has two phalanges, all of their toes have three phalanges. This distinguishes them from hipposiderids, which have two phalanges in all toes. The tail is completely enclosed in the uropatagium (tail membrane), and the trailing edge of the uropatagium has calcars (cartilaginous spurs).

==Biology and ecology==
===Echolocation and hearing===

Horeshoe bats have very small eyes and their field of vision is limited by their large nose-leafs; thus, vision is unlikely to be a very important sense. Instead, they use echolocation to navigate, employing some of the most sophisticated echolocation of any bat group. To echolocate, they produce sound through their nostrils. While some bats use frequency-modulated echolocation, horseshoe bats use constant-frequency echolocation (also known as single-frequency echolocation). They have high duty cycles, meaning that when individuals are calling, they are producing sound more than 30% of the time. The use of high duty, constant-frequency echolocation aids in distinguishing prey items based on size. These echolocation characteristics are typical of bats that search for moving prey items in cluttered environments full of foliage. They echolocate at particularly high frequencies for bats, though not as high as hipposiderids relative to their body sizes, and the majority concentrate most of the echolocation energy into the second harmonic. The king horseshoe bat (&quot;R. rex&quot;) and the large-eared horseshoe bat (&quot;R. philippensis&quot;) are examples of outlier species that concentrate energy into the first harmonic rather than the second. Their highly furrowed nose-leafs likely assist in focusing the emission of sound, reducing the effect of environmental clutter. The nose-leaf in general acts like a parabolic reflector, aiming the produced sound while simultaneously shielding the ear from some of it.

Horseshoe bats have sophisticated senses of hearing due to their well-developed cochlea, and are able to detect Doppler-shifted echoes. This allows them to produce and receive sounds simultaneously. Within horseshoe bats, there is a negative relationship between ear length and echolocation frequency: Species with higher echolocation frequencies tend to have shorter ear lengths. During echolocation, the ears can move independently of each other in a &quot;flickering&quot; motion characteristic of the family, while the head simultaneously moves up and down or side to side.

===Diet and foraging===

Horseshoe bats are insectivorous, though consume other arthropods such as spiders, and employ two main foraging strategies. The first strategy is flying slow and low over the ground, hunting among trees and bushes. Some species who use this strategy are able to hover over prey and glean them from the substrate. The other strategy is known as perch feeding: Individuals roost on feeding perches and wait for prey to fly past, then fly out to capture it. Foraging usually occurs above the ground. While vesper bats may catch prey in their uropatagia and transfer it to their mouths, horseshoe bats do not use their uropatagia to catch prey. At least one species, the greater horseshoe bat, has been documented catching prey in the tip of its wing by bending the phalanges around it, then transferring it to its mouth. While a majority of horseshoe bats are nocturnal and hunt at night, Blyth&#x27;s horseshoe bat (&quot;R. lepidus&quot;) is known to forage during the daytime on Tioman Island. This is hypothesized as a response to a lack of diurnal avian (day-active bird) predators on the island.

They have especially small and rounded wingtips, low wing loading (meaning they have large wings relative to body mass), and high camber. These factors give them increased agility, and they are capable of making quick, tight turns at slow speeds. Relative to all bats, horseshoe bat wingspans are typical for their body sizes, and their aspect ratios, which relate wingspan to wing area, are average or lower than average. Some species, like Rüppell&#x27;s horseshoe bat (&quot;R. fumigatus&quot;), Hildebrandt&#x27;s horseshoe bat, Lander&#x27;s horseshoe bat (&quot;R. landeri&quot;), and Swinny&#x27;s horseshoe bat (&quot;R. swinnyi&quot;), have particularly large total wing area, though most horseshoe bat species have average wing area.

===Reproduction and life cycle===
The mating systems of horseshoe bats are poorly understood. A review in 2000 noted that only about 4% of species had published information about their mating systems; along with the free-tailed bats (Molossidae), they had received the least attention of any bat family relative to their species diversity. At least one species, the greater horseshoe bat, appears to have a polygynous mating system where males attempt to establish and defend territories, attracting multiple females. &quot;Rhinolophus sedulus&quot;, however, is among the few species of bat that are believed to be monogamous (only 17 bat species are recognized as such as of 2000). Some species, particularly temperate species, have an annual breeding season in the fall, while other species mate in the spring. Many horseshoe bat species have the adaptation of delayed fertilization through female sperm storage. This is especially common in temperate species. In hibernating species, the sperm storage timing coincides with hibernation. Other species like Lander&#x27;s horseshoe bat have embryonic diapause, meaning that while fertilization occurs directly following copulation, the zygote does not implant into the uterine wall for an extended period of time. The greater horseshoe bat has the adaptation of delayed embryonic development, meaning that growth of the embryo is conditionally delayed if the female enters torpor. This causes the interval between fertilization and birth to vary between two and three months. Gestation takes approximately seven weeks before a single offspring is born, called a pup. Individuals reach sexual maturity by age two. While lifespans typically do not exceed six or seven years, some individuals may have extraordinarily long lives. A greater horseshoe bat individual was once banded and then rediscovered thirty years later.

===Behavior and social systems===
Various levels of sociality are seen in horseshoe bats. Some species are solitary, with individuals roosting alone, while others are highly colonial, forming aggregations of thousands of individuals. The majority of species are moderately social. In some species, the sexes segregate annually when females form maternity colonies, though the sexes remain together all year in others. Individuals hunt solitarily. Because their hind limbs are poorly developed, they cannot scuttle on flat surfaces nor climb adeptly like other bats.

Horseshoe bats enter torpor to conserve energy. During torpor, their body temperature drops to as low as and their metabolic rates slow. Torpor is employed by horseshoe bats in temperate, sub-tropical, and tropical regions. Torpor has a short duration; when torpor is employed consistently for days, weeks, or months, it is known as hibernation. Hibernation is used by horseshoe bats in temperate regions during the winter months.

===Predators and parasites===
Overall, bats have few natural predators. Horseshoe bat predators include birds in the order Accipitriformes (hawks, eagles, and kites), as well as falcons and owls. Snakes may also prey on some species while they roost in caves, and domestic cats may hunt them as well. A 2019 study near a colony of bats in central Italy found that 30% of examined cat feces contained the remains of greater horseshoe bats.

Horseshoe bats have a variety of internal and external parasites. External parasites (ectoparasites) include mites in the genus &quot;Eyndhovenia&quot;, &quot;bat flies&quot; of the families Streblidae and Nycteribiidae, ticks of the genus &quot;Ixodes&quot;, and fleas of the genus &quot;Rhinolophopsylla&quot;. They are also affected by a variety of internal parasites (endoparasites), including trematodes of the genera &quot;Lecithodendrium&quot;, &quot;Plagiorchis&quot;, &quot;Prosthodendrium&quot;, and cestodes of the genus &quot;Potorolepsis&quot;.

==Range and habitat==
Horseshoe bats have a mostly Paleotropical distribution, though some species are in the southern Palearctic realm. They are found in the Old World, including Africa, Australia, Asia, Europe, and Oceania. The greater horseshoe bat has the greatest geographic range of any horseshoe bat, occurring across Europe, North Africa, Japan, China, and southern Asia. Other species are much more restricted, like the Andaman horseshoe bat (&quot;R. cognatus&quot;), which is only found on the Andaman Islands. They roost in a variety of places, including buildings, caves, tree hollows, and foliage. They occur in both forested and unforested habitat, with the majority of species occurring in tropical or subtropical areas. For the species that hibernate, they select caves with an ambient temperature of approximately .

==Relationship to humans==
===As disease reservoirs===
====Coronaviruses====

Horseshoe bats are of particular interest to public health and zoonosis as a source of coronaviruses.

Following the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak, several animal species were examined as possible natural reservoirs of the causative coronavirus, SARS-CoV. From 2003 to 2018, forty-seven SARS-related coronaviruses were detected in horseshoe bats. In 2019, a wet market in Wuhan, China, was linked to the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. Genetic analyses of SARS-CoV-2 showed that it was highly similar to viruses found in horseshoe bats.

After the SARS outbreak, the least horseshoe bat (&quot;R. pusillus&quot;) was seropositive, the greater horseshoe bat tested positive for the virus only, and the big-eared horseshoe bat (&quot;R. macrotis&quot;), Chinese rufous horseshoe bat (&quot;R. sinicus&quot;), and Pearson&#x27;s horseshoe bat (&quot;R. pearsoni&quot;) were both seropositive &quot;and&quot; tested positive for the virus. The bats&#x27; viruses were highly similar to SARS-CoV, with 88–92% similarity. Intraspecies diversity of SARS-like coronaviruses appears to have arisen in &quot;Rhinolophus sinicus&quot; by homologous recombination. &quot;R. sinicus&quot; likely harbored the direct ancestor of SARS-CoV in humans. Though horseshoe bats appeared to be the natural reservoir of SARS-related coronaviruses, humans likely became sick through contact with infected masked palm civets, which were identified as intermediate hosts of the virus.

During the period from 2003 to 2018, forty-seven SARS-related coronaviruses were detected in bats, forty-five in horseshoe bats. Thirty SARS-related coronaviruses were from Chinese rufous horseshoe bats, nine from greater horseshoe bats, two from big-eared horseshoe bats, two from the least horseshoe bat, and one each from the intermediate horseshoe bat (&quot;R. affinis&quot;), Blasius&#x27;s horseshoe bat (&quot;R. blasii&quot;), Stoliczka&#x27;s trident bat (&quot;Aselliscus stoliczkanus&quot;), and the wrinkle-lipped free-tailed bat (&quot;Chaerephon plicata&quot;).

In the market in Wuhan where the SARS-CoV-2 was detected, 96% had a similarity to a virus isolated from the intermediate horseshoe bat. Research on the evolutionary origins of SARS-CoV-2 indicates that bats were the natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2. It is yet unclear how the virus was transmitted to humans, though an intermediate host may have been involved. It was once believed to be the Sunda pangolin, but a July 2020 publication found no evidence of transmission from pangolins to humans.

====Other viruses====
They are also associated with viruses like orthoreoviruses, flaviviruses, and hantaviruses. They have tested positive for &quot;Mammalian orthoreovirus&quot; (MRV), including a type 1 MRV isolated from the lesser horseshoe bat and a type 2 MRV isolated from the least horseshoe bat. The specific MRVs found in horseshoe bats have not been linked to human infection, though humans can become ill through exposure to other MRVs. The rufous horseshoe bat (&quot;R. rouxii&quot;) has tested seropositive for Kyasanur Forest disease, which is a tick-borne viral hemorrhagic fever known from southern India. Kyasanur Forest disease is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected ticks, and has a mortality rate of 2–10%. Longquan virus, a kind of hantavirus, has been detected in the intermediate horseshoe bat, Chinese rufous horseshoe bat, and the little Japanese horseshoe bat (&quot;R. cornutus&quot;).

===As food and medicine===

Microbats are not hunted nearly as intensely as megabats: only 8% of insectivorous species are hunted for food, compared to half of all megabat species in the Old World tropics. Horseshoe bats are hunted for food, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Species hunted in Africa include the halcyon horseshoe bat (&quot;R. alcyone&quot;), Guinean horseshoe bat (&quot;R. guineensis&quot;), Hill&#x27;s horseshoe bat (&quot;R. hilli&quot;), Hills&#x27; horseshoe bat (&quot;R. hillorum&quot;), Maclaud&#x27;s horseshoe bat (&quot;R. maclaudi&quot;), the Ruwenzori horseshoe bat, the forest horseshoe bat (&quot;R. silvestris&quot;), and the Ziama horseshoe bat (&quot;R. ziama&quot;). In Southeast Asia, Marshall&#x27;s horseshoe bat (&quot;R. marshalli&quot;) is consumed in Myanmar and the large rufous horseshoe bat (&quot;R. rufus&quot;) is consumed in the Philippines.

The Ao Naga people of Northeast India are reported to use the flesh of horseshoe bats to treat asthma. Ecological anthropologist Will Tuladhar-Douglas stated that the Newar people of Nepal &quot;almost certainly&quot; use horseshoe bats, among other species, to prepare &quot;Cikā Lāpa Wasa&quot; (&quot;bat oil&quot;). Dead bats are rolled up and placed in tightly sealed jars of mustard oil; the oil is ready when it gives off a distinct and unpleasant smell. Traditional medicinal uses of the bat oil include removing &quot;earbugs&quot;, reported to be millipedes that crawl into one&#x27;s ears and gnaw at the brain, possibly a traditional explanation of migraines. It is also used as a purported treatment for baldness and partial paralysis. In Senegal, there are anecdotal reports of horseshoe bats being used in potions to treat mental illness; in Vietnam, a pharmaceutical company reported using of horseshoe bat guano each year for medicinal uses.

==Conservation==

As of 2023, the IUCN had evaluated 94 species of horseshoe bat. They have the following IUCN statuses:
*Critically endangered: 1 species (Hill&#x27;s horseshoe bat)
*Endangered: 13 species
*Vulnerable: 5 species
*Near threatened: 9 species
*Least concern: 51 species
*Data deficient: 15 species

Like all cave-roosting bats, cave-roosting horseshoe bats are vulnerable to disturbance of their cave habitats. Disturbance can include mining bat guano, quarrying limestone, and cave tourism.

<text>University College Hospital (UCH) is a teaching hospital in the Fitzrovia area of the London Borough of Camden, England. The hospital, which was founded as the North London Hospital in 1834, is closely associated with University College London (UCL), whose main campus is situated next door. The hospital is part of the University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.

The hospital is on the south side of Euston Road and its tower faces Euston Square tube station on the east side. Warren Street tube station lies immediately west and the major Euston terminus station is beyond 200 metres east, just beyond Euston Square Gardens.

==History==
In 1826, the London University began emphasising the importance of having medical schools attached to hospitals. Before the hospital opened, only Oxford and Cambridge universities offered medical degrees, and as a consequence relatively few doctors actually had degrees. The hospital was founded as the North London Hospital in 1834 in order to provide clinical training for the &quot;medical classes&quot; of the university, after a refusal by the governors of the Middlesex Hospital to allow students access to that hospital&#x27;s wards. It soon became known as University College Hospital.

In 1835, Robert Liston became the first professor of clinical surgery at UCH, 
and the first major operation under ether in Europe was conducted at the hospital by Liston on 21 December 1846. UCH was split from UCL in 1905, and a new hospital building designed by Alfred Waterhouse, known as the Cruciform Building, was opened in 1906 on Gower Street. UCH merged with the National Dental Hospital in 1914, and the Royal Ear Hospital in 1920.

George Orwell married Sonia Brownell in 1949, and later died 21 January 1950, in room 65 of the hospital. The hospital was run by the Camden and Islington Area Health Authority from 1974. In 1994, UCH became part of the University College London Hospitals NHS Trust. The hospital site at the Cruciform Building was closed in 1995, despite strikes and an occupation in 1993. The building was purchased by UCL, for use as the home for the Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research and the teaching facility for UCL bioscience and medical students UCL Medical School.

A new 75,822 m2 hospital, procured under the Private Finance Initiative in 2000, designed by Llewelyn Davies Yeang and built by a joint venture of AMEC and Balfour Beatty at a cost of £422 million, opened in 2005. The sculpture &quot;Monolith and Shadow&quot; made from a large polished piece of Brazilian granite was placed outside the main entrance to the new hospital in 2005.

In October 2006, the hospital was nominated and made the Building Design shortlist for the inaugural Carbuncle Cup, awarded to &quot;the ugliest building in the United Kingdom completed in the last 12 months&quot;, which was ultimately awarded to Drake Circus Shopping Centre in Plymouth. Facilities management services are provided by Interserve.

In November 2008, the £70 million Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Wing was opened, allowing the hospital to offer all women&#x27;s health services in one place (except some breast and gynaecology services).

In 2024, King Charles III became patron of the hospital, a role Queen Elizabeth II had filled until her death in 2022.

==Services==
 the following services were provided at the hospital:

*Accident and emergency
*Cancer care (see UCH Macmillan Cancer Centre)
*Clinical haematology including stem cell transplantation
*Critical care
*Dermatology
*Endocrinology
*General medicine
*General neurology
*General surgery
*Gynaecology
*Ophthalmology
*Orthopaedics
*Paediatrics and adolescents
*Rheumatology

The hospital has 665 in-patient beds, 12 operating theatres and houses the largest single critical care unit in the NHS. The Accident and Emergency department sees approximately 120,000 patients a year. It is a major teaching hospital and a key location for the UCL Medical School. It is also a major centre for medical research and part of both the UCLH/UCL Biomedical Research Centre and the UCL Partners academic health science centre.

The urology department moved to University College Hospital at Westmoreland Street, formerly the Heart Hospital, in 2015.

<text>The Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution, popularly referred to as the &#x27;Evo&#x27;, is a sports sedan and rally car based on the Lancer that was manufactured by Japanese manufacturer Mitsubishi Motors from 1992 until 2016. There have been ten official versions to date, and the designation of each model is most commonly a Roman numeral. All generations use two-litre intercooled turbo inline four-cylinder engines and all-wheel drive systems.

The Lancer was originally intended only for Japanese markets, but demand on the &quot;grey import&quot; market led the Evolution series to be offered through Ralliart dealer networks in the United Kingdom and in various European markets from around 1998. Mitsubishi decided to export the eighth generation Evolution to the United States in 2003 after witnessing the success Subaru had in that market the previous year with the Subaru Impreza WRX.

All domestic-market versions, until the release of the Evolution IX in 2005, were limited by a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement between Japanese car manufacturers to advertise no more than . However, sources say Mitsubishi had already been producing cars with more power but had been underrating the official power outputs in order to comply with the agreement. Therefore, each subsequent version has unofficially evolved above the advertised power figures, with the Japanese-market Evolution IX reaching an alleged output of around . Various special versions available in other markets, particularly the UK, have official power outputs up to .

The tenth and final generation of the Lancer Evolution, the Evolution X, was launched in Japan in 2007, and overseas markets in 2008. The Evolution X was produced for almost 10 years until Mitsubishi retired the Lancer Evolution in April 2016.

== Evolution I==
The first Lancer Evolution used the 2.0 L turbocharged DOHC engine and AWD drivetrain from the original Galant VR-4 in a Lancer chassis, and was sold in GSR and RS models. This engine was also used in the Mitsubishi RVR with the Hyper Sports Gear trim package, and the Mitsubishi Chariot Resort Runner GT. The RS was a stripped-down version that lacked power windows and seats, anti-lock brakes, a rear wiper, and had steel wheels to weigh approximately less than the GSR, ready for racing or tuning. The RS version was released with a mechanical plate type rear limited-slip differential (LSD). The GSR came with all of the conveniences of a typical street car, including a digital screen climate control system. It came with Mitsubishi&#x27;s &quot;4G63&quot; engine producing at 6,000 rpm and at 3,000 rpm. 5,000 of the first generation Evolutions were sold between 1992 and 1993. Top speed was . The GSR version of the Evolution I was the only Evolution Lancer released with a viscous limited-slip rear differential (VLSD). The subsequent Evolution Lancer models all featured rear mechanical plate type LSD&#x27;s.
== Evolution II==
The Evolution II was upgraded in December 1993, and was produced until February 1995. It mainly consisted of handling improvements, including minor wheelbase adjustments, lighter front swaybar that connected via swaybar links to the front struts, bodywork tweaks including a larger spoiler, and tires that were wider. This Evolution also has a fuel tank. Power output was increased to from the same engine and torque was unchanged for both GSR and RS models. Most cars came with 15-inch OZ 5-spoke wheels from the factory, although some RS models sold to privateer racing teams left the factory with steel wheels. 
== Evolution III==
February 1995 saw the arrival of the Evolution III, following a pre-release in 1993 which had several improvements over the previous models. New, more aggressive styling and a new nose moulding improved the air supply to the radiator, intercooler and brakes. New side skirts and rear bumper moldings and a larger rear spoiler were added to reduce lift. The engine was improved and had a higher compression ratio than before, and a new turbocharger compressor (65 mm to 68 mm), which resulted in a power output of at 6,250 rpm, at 3,000 rpm. As per the previous Evolution II, an RS model was available.

== Evolution IV==

The Lancer platform was redesigned in 1996, and along with it, the Evolution. The engine and transaxle were rotated 180° to better balance the weight and eliminate torque steer.

There were two versions available, the RS and GSR. The RS version was produced as a competition car with a limited-slip front differential and a friction-type LSD at the rear. It also came with GLX seats and a choice of either 15-inch or 16-inch OZ lightweight racing wheels. The RS also had wind-up windows, optional air conditioning in some models, and a few extra brace bars to strengthen the chassis, one behind the front grille and another across the boot floor, and an aluminum rear strut tower brace.

The GSR and the RS shared a new twin-scroll turbocharger which helped to improve response and increase power to at 6,500 rpm and torque at 3,000 rpm. Mitsubishi&#x27;s new Active Yaw Control appeared as a factory standard on the GSR model, which used steering, throttle input sensors and &quot;g&quot; sensors to computer-hydraulically control torque split individually to the rear wheels, Mitsubishi has planned to produce the Evolution IVs only 6,000 cars, but it was completely sold out in just three days after its release.

The Evolution IV can be distinguished by its two large fog lights in the front bumper (option on RS version), and the newly designed tail lights on the rear, which became a standard design to Evolution V, which would become yet another trademark of the Evolution series, note the RS has no light mounts on the boot/trunk for further weight saving.

This new generation was slightly heavier than previous Evo&#x27;s—the GSR in particular due to the added technology systems—but to counter this, the car produced even more power—the weight of the RS being and the GSR being (Sunroof model ).

Much of the technical improvements for this generation were also used in the second-generation Mitsubishi RVR originally sold only in Japan but since exported to Australia and New Zealand. The Evolution IV was the last model to be considered &quot;compact&quot; according to Japanese dimension regulations.
*RS – &quot;Rally Sport&quot; – Shortened close-ratio 5-speed transmission, minimal interior, front worm-gear LSD and rear 1.5-way LSD, front end crossbar, 15-inch steel rims, Lancer GLXi Front Seats (non-bucket seats), manual windows and mirrors. (Optional: manual air conditioning, PIAA front fog lights, anti-lock brakes, Lamco-Mitsubishi boost gauge.)
*GSR – &quot;Gran Sport Racing&quot; – 5-speed manual transmission, AYC (Active Yaw Control), anti-lock brakes, black-red Recaro front bucket seats, Driver and Passenger-side Airbag, full auto air conditioner, Single DIN AM/FM/Cassette Stereo player with rear windscreen integrated antenna, PIAA front fog lights, power windows, 16-inch OZ Racing F1 wheels, rear windscreen wiper, optional: sunroof, Lamco-Mitsubishi boost gauge, 5-inch Double DIN TV Tuner/CD Player head unit.

== Evolution V==
Many aspects of the car were changed such as:
*The interior was upgraded in the GSR version with a better class of Recaro seats.
*The body kit had flared arches at the front and rear and a new aluminum rear spoiler replaced the IV FRP version and gave an adjustable angle of attack to alter rear downforce. (In process of doing so, the Evolution V onwards was no longer considered &quot;compact&quot; according to Japanese dimension regulations, as the car was now wider than regulated limit of ).
*The track was widened by , the wheel offset changed from ET45 to ET38 along with the wheel diameter which rose from 16 inches to 17 inches to accommodate Brembo brakes.
*The brake master cylinder bore increased by .
*The engine was strengthened in a few areas and the cam duration was increased. The pistons were lighter with a smaller skirt area. 510-cc injectors were replaced with 560-cc injectors for better engine reliability due to more electrical &quot;headroom&quot; and the ECU was changed to include a flash ROM, allowing more boost pressure to the same TD05-HR turbocharger as the Mitsubishi Evolution IV.

Furthermore, the turbocharger was again improved. Torque was increased to at 3,000 rpm. Power officially stayed the same, at .
* RS – &quot;rally sport&quot; close-ratio 5-speed manual transmission, minimal interior, rally suspension, 1.5-way limited-slip differential, (auto air conditioner, Enkei wheels, Recaro bucket seats, Brembo brakes, power windows are available as an option).
* GSR – 5-speed manual transmission, gauge pack, AYC (Active Yaw Control), anti-lock brakes, driver and passenger-side airbags, Recaro front bucket and rear seats, auto air conditioner, single DIN AM/FM/cassette stereo player, power windows, and Brembo brakes.
== Evolution VI==

The Evolution VI&#x27;s changes mainly focused on cooling and engine durability. It received a larger intercooler, larger oil cooler, and new pistons, along with a titanium-aluminide turbine wheel for the RS model, which was a first in a production car. Output was rated at at 6,500 rpm and maximum torque of at 3,000 rpm.

The Evolution VI received new bodywork yet again, with the most easily noticeable change being within the front bumper where the huge fog lights were reduced in size and moved to the corners for better airflow. A new model was added to the GSR and RS lineup; known as the RS2, it was an RS with a few of the GSR&#x27;s options. Another limited-edition RS was known as the RS Sprint, an RS tuned by Ralliart in the UK to be lighter and more powerful with .

Yet another special edition Evolution VI was released in December 1999: the Tommi Mäkinen Edition, named after Finnish rally driver Tommi Mäkinen who had won Mitsubishi four WRC drivers championships. It featured a different front bumper, Red/Black Recaro seats (with embossed T. Mäkinen logo), 17-inch white Enkei wheels, a leather Momo steering wheel and shift knob, a titanium turbine that spooled up more quickly, front upper strut brace, lowered ride height (with tarmac stages in mind), and a quicker steering ratio. Amongst other colours, the Evo VI came in either red (Tommi Mäkinen Edition only), white, blue, black or silver with optional special decals, replicating Tommi Mäkinen&#x27;s rally car&#x27;s colour scheme. This car is also sometimes referred to as an Evolution 6, Evolution 6.5, or TME for short. 4,092 units were produced in total and exterior styling was similar to that of its predecessor, the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution 5.

===Standard models===
* RS – &quot;rally sport&quot; minimal interior, rally suspension, rear 1.5-way limited-slip differential as opposed to AYC, shortened close-ratio 5-speed manual transmission, optional Enkei wheels, optional Recaro Seats, optional air conditioning, optional Brembo brakes, optional power windows.
* GSR – 5-speed manual transmission, gauge pack, AYC (Active Yaw Control), anti-lock brakes, Recaro front bucket and rear seat, auto air conditioner, double-DIN audio, power windows, and Brembo brakes.

===Tommi Mäkinen Edition models===
* RS – same as standard RS with close-ratio 5-speed transmission, lowered ride height, Tommi Mäkinen Edition front bumper, and titanium turbine (option with standard RS).
* GSR – same as standard GSR with lowered ride height, Tommi Mäkinen Edition front bumper, Red/Black/Green Recaro seats (with embossed T. Mäkinen logo), 17-inch Enkei white wheels and titanium turbine.

== Evolution VII==
In 2001, Mitsubishi was forced by the FIA to run in the WRC using WRC rules for building a car instead of the Group A class rules, and this did not need to follow homologation rules. The Evolution VII was based on the larger Lancer Cedia platform and as a result gained more weight over the Evolution VI, but Mitsubishi made up for this with multiple important chassis tweaks. The biggest change was the addition of an active center differential and a more effective limited-slip differential, while a front helical limited-slip differential was added. Torque was increased again to with engine tweaks that allowed greater airflow, and horsepower officially remained at . For a time, Proton entered a rebadged version called the Proton PERT.

===Evolution VII GT-A===
The introduction of the Evolution VII also marked the first time an automatic drivetrain was included within the model lineup—the GT-A. Nicknamed the &#x27;Grand Touring Automatic&#x27; version of the visually similar VII GSR and the RS2, the GT-A model was only produced in 2002 and had the following distinguishing interior and exterior specification: GT-A-only diamond cut finish alloy wheels, clear rear light lenses and all-in-one style front headlights (later used on the Evolution VIII). The GT-A had the option of either no spoiler, the short spoiler (as per the Lancer Cedia; and later used on the Evolution VIII 260) or the thunder spoiler as used on the standard Evolution VII models. The most distinguishing feature was a smooth bonnet without the NACA duct on it at all and the revised front bumper. Although offering inferior cooling capabilities, the bonnet was designed to give a cleaner line through the air with less air resistance at highway speeds.

Interior could be specified with factory options of a deluxe velour interior, full leather with 4-way Power seats or the Recaro sports seats. The GT-A interior was different in that it had chromed door handles, a different instrument panel (to show the gear selection) and chrome edged bezels around the speedo and tach. The GT-A also had additional sound deadening and privacy glass installed from the factory and the engine manifold and downpipe had been engineered to be quieter.

The 5-speed W5A51 automatic gearbox had what Mitsubishi called &quot;fuzzy logic&quot;, which meant that the car would learn what the driver&#x27;s driving characteristics were like and would adapt the gear change timings and kick down reactions accordingly. The gears could be manually selected as with most Tiptronics via steering wheel + and – buttons (a pair both sides) or via selecting the tiptronic gate with the gear lever. Power was down a little from the standard manual cars with , while Torque was decreased to . The GT-A gearbox did not appear again in the Evolution VIII but has been installed in the estate version of the Evolution IX Wagon. It was replaced by the Twin Clutch SST gearbox since the introduction of Evolution X.

Evolution VII GT-A was launched on January 29, 2002, and it was available at the Galant and Mitsubishi Car Plaza dealers nationwide from February 1 of that same year, at a starting price of ¥3.3 million.

===Standard models===
* RS – &quot;rally sport&quot;, close-ratio 5-speed, minimal interior, rally suspension, LSD, Enkei Wheels, Recaro bucket seat, AYC (Active Yaw Control), Sports ABS (Anti-Lock braking system), Brembo brakes, double-din audio, power window are available as option.
* GSR – 5-speed, gauge pack, AYC (Active Yaw Control), Sports ABS, Recaro front bucket and rear seat, double-din audio, power window, Brembo brakes, Momo sports steering wheel.
* GT-A – Same option with GSR with 5-speed automatic transmission, gauge pack, deluxe velour interior, full leather or the Recaro sports seats, GT-A-only diamond cut finish alloy wheels, clear rear light lenses and all-in-one style front headlights, and short spoiler option.

== Evolution VIII==
The Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VIII appeared in 2003, this time sporting 17-inch grey Enkei wheels, Brembo brakes and Bilstein shocks to handle traction and a 5-speed manual gearbox with (approx. to the wheels). Originally a one-off model, sales were so successful in the U.S. that by 2005 it was available in four trims. The standard GSR model was available in Japan. The RS model was provided with a 5-speed manual gearbox and standard wheels (lacking excess components, such as interior map lights, power windows/doors, and radio). The SSL trim package came with a sunroof, trunk mounted subwoofer, and leather seats. All of these trim levels also included chrome headlight and taillight housings. To round out the lineup, the MR came with a revised front limited-slip differential, aluminum MR shift knob, handbrake with carbon fibre handle, 17-inch BBS wheels, aluminum roof, and a 6-speed manual gearbox. Additionally, the Evolution MR&#x27;s taillights and headlights sported a new black housing.

The Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VIII MR used slick-response Bilstein shocks for improved handling. The aluminium roof panel and other reductions in body weight lowered the centre of gravity to produce more natural roll characteristics. Detail improvements have also been made to Mitsubishi&#x27;s own electronic four-wheel drive, to the ACD 5 + Super AYC 6 traction control, and to the Sports ABS systems. The Lancer Evolution VIII displayed at the 2003 Tokyo Motor Show took the MR designation traditionally reserved for Mitsubishi Motors high-performance models (first used for the Galant GTO). Other parts on the MR include BBS alloy wheels, the aforementioned Bilstein shocks, and an aluminium roof. In the United Kingdom, many special Evolutions were introduced, including the 260, FQ300, FQ320, FQ340, and FQ400 variants. They came with 260, 305, 325, 345, and 405 hp (194, 227, 239, 254 and 302 kW), respectively.

The FQ-400, sold through Ralliart UK, produced at 6,400 rpm and maximum torque of at 5,500 rpm, from its 4G63 inline-four engine, the result of special modifications by United Kingdom tuning firms Rampage Tuning, Owen Developments, and Flow Race Engines. The &quot;FQ&quot; name stands for &quot;F——ing Quick&quot;, although it is not officially recognized by Mitsubishi due to the vulgarity behind the abbreviation. With a curb weight of , it achieves 0– in 3.5 seconds, 0– in 9.1 seconds,  in 12.1 seconds at , and a top speed of while costing £48,000. BBC&#x27;s television series &quot;Top Gear&quot; demonstrated that the stock FQ-400 could keep up with a Lamborghini Murciélago around a test track. The Stig recorded a Top Gear Power Lap Time of 1 minute and 24.8 seconds (damp track), 1.1 seconds slower than the Murciélago&#x27;s time of 1 minute 23.7 seconds (dry track). In a similar test conducted by &quot;Evo&quot; magazine, the Evolution was able to lap the Bedford Autodrome faster than an Audi RS4 and a Porsche 911 Carrera 4S.

The Lancer Evolution VIII was also the first Evolution to be sold in the United States, spurred by the success of the Subaru Impreza WRX which had been released there just the year prior. The Evolution VIII found its true competition in the Subaru Impreza WRX STI model the same year as the Evolution VIII&#x27;s US introduction. With its 2.0 liter, engine, the 2003 Evolution VIII was capable of achieving a 0–100 km/h (62 mph) time of 5.1 seconds. However, the internal components for the American versions were largely stripped-down versions of the specifications for the Japanese Lancer Evolution VIII. No US-spec Evolution model prior to the Evo X has active yaw control, including the 2006 Evolution IX. The American 2003 and 2004 GSRs are without the helical limited-slip front differential and 6-speed manual transmission. The 2004 US spec RS models, however, do have a front helical limited-slip differential. All 2003, 2004 and 2005 RS and GSR models have the Japanese Evolution VII&#x27;s 5-speed transmission. The MR edition was introduced to the US in 2005, with ACD and the only model with a 6-speed manual transmission. The 2005 US spec RS and GSR have the ACD standard, and the front helical limited-slip differential is now standard on all models. The boost, timing, and tuning are also significantly lower than its Japanese counterpart, allowing it to adhere to the strict emissions regulations of the United States. Starting in 2005, the US model Evolutions were also fitted with a 5,500 rpm limit on launching in first gear to protect the drivetrain.

Most Evolution VIIIs have a carbon fiber rear spoiler with matching body-color endplates. Furthermore, the US versions of the Lancer Evolution VIII 2003–2005 were given bulkier rear bumpers than their Japanese counterparts to accommodate US safety laws in the form of the metal rear crash bar. All Evolutions have lightweight aluminum front fenders and hoods.

The basic RS Edition does not come with power windows, locks, or mirrors, an audio system, rear wing, sound deadening material, map lamps or an anti-lock braking system. All Evolution VIII RS models sold in the US are equipped with air conditioning.

The 2005 MR/RS editions came with an aluminum roof.

Additionally, Evolution VIII MR Editions come equipped with a 6-speed manual transmission, Bilstein shocks, optional graphite grey color (unique to the Evolution VIII MR), optional BBS wheels and an optional vortex generator. The MR Edition also received engine updates and reliability changes, the engine updates include larger turbo diameter mouth, updated cam profiles, lighter balance shafts and changed from single wastegate solenoid to dual solenoid. Exterior changes included HID headlights, updated taillights, and MR rear badging. Interior updates included black suede Recaro seats with higher side bolsters, carbon look dash trim, and MR badging on center console. Mechanical changes saw S-AWC rear diff changes, a larger oil cooler core, ion-coated piston rings, reinforced cylinder head and 5-layer head gasket compared to the 3 layer.

According to Mitsubishi Motors of North America (info from evolutionm.net) the total production sales in the U.S. for the Evolution VIII (2003–2005) was 12,846. In 2003, the production sales for the GSR was 7,167 which was the only 2003 model year. In 2004, production sales for the GSR was 1,254 and for the RS was 263 for a total of 1,517 for the 2004 model year. In 2005 production sales for the GSR was 2,880, for the RS was 282, and for the MR was 1000 for a total of 4,162 for the 2005 model year.

== Evolution IX==

Mitsubishi introduced the Lancer Evolution IX in Japan on March 3, 2005, and exhibited the car at the Geneva Motor Show for the European market the same day. The North American markets saw the model exhibited at the New York International Auto Show the following month. The 4G63 Inline-four engine has MIVEC technology (variable valve timing), and a revised turbocharger design boosting official power output at the crankshaft to and torque to .

The USDM Lancer Evolution IX models: standard (Grand Sport Rally or &quot;GSR&quot; in some markets), RS (Rally Sport), SE (Special Edition) and MR (Mitsubishi Racing) varied slightly in their performance capabilities. Subtleties unique to each model accounted for variations in acceleration, handling and top speed. The RS excluded features that came standard on the SE and MR models (stereo system, power windows and locks, rear wiper, rear wing, trunk lining and sound insulation). The result is a weight savings of over . The fuel capacity remains the same as the Evo VIII at .

Although the RS is the lightest of the group, the RS did not manage to outperform the standard IX and the MR around a road course (even if only by fractions of a second). This was purported to be due to the lack of a rear wing on the RS. In a drag race, the three models are all about even. They are all capable of 0- times between 4.2 and 4.5 seconds, and can run  times ranging from 12.6 to 13.3 (12.7–13.0 USA versions) seconds depending on the model/driver. The RS model was produced for rally and racing teams who wanted a platform to build a race car from. It is stripped of all the creature comforts, and other upgrades that drive the price up for features that the race teams would not require.

The IX MR retained the features of the Evolution VIII MR, like Bilstein shocks, a 6-speed manual transmission, a rooftop vortex generator, BBS forged wheels, HID xenon headlights, foglights, accessory gauge package, &quot;zero lift&quot; kit, special badging and an aluminum roof. All models continued to sport Recaro bucket seats, Brembo brakes and Momo steering wheels as well. Additional revisions from 2005 included a closer gear ratio for the 5-speed manual transmission, new lighter Enkei wheels on non-MR models, a redesigned front end with a more efficient air dam (the most noticeable feature are the two small oval ducts to cool the intercooler pipes), and a new rear bumper with a diffuser undersurface to smooth out the airflow coming out of the car for non-US models. HID headlights were no longer standard equipment on the base IX (nor were they standard on the 2005 VIII), and were available only in the SSL package (Sun, Sound, and Leather), SE (Special Edition) and MR trims.

The US versions of the Lancer Evolution IX did not come with the AYC but the ACD was still present. The drivers can select from three different driving modes, &quot;Tarmac&quot;, &quot;Gravel&quot; and &quot;Snow&quot;, and the car&#x27;s computer system relatively promotes the active center differential to change the differential locking. Each setting determines how long the ACD will delay in freeing the center differential after a steering input is made. In addition, it will determine how much locking force the ACD will exhibit on the clutch pack and center differential. When the clutch is not fully engaged, torque split can not be 50/50.

Tarmac is the setting to be used in dry, paved conditions. In this setting, the ACD will almost immediately allow the center differential to go into a free state upon detecting a steering input. Additionally, this mode provides the strongest limited-slip clamping force of the three modes. Although the US versions did not come with the AYC, it did come with a rear 1.5way clutch type LSD (limited-slip differential), which limits the slip from both rear wheels causing less traction loss of the rear wheels. The most common setup is the 1.5 way LSD, locking on throttle and partially locking on braking. In racing, Lancer Evolutions are not equipped with AYC or ACD because it is believed that better lap times are achieved by pure driver skill without any computer based assistance systems.

One of the changes from the previous iteration of the Lancer Evolution, was the change in the engine, the new 4G63 came with MIVEC, Mitsubishi&#x27;s variable valve timing technology, which drastically improves the fuel consumption by changing the valve timing on the intake cam. The MIVEC system is similar to Honda&#x27;s i-VTEC system only that it doesn&#x27;t change valve lift, only intake valve timing.

21
21 trims were available for Japan, Asia and Europe. Although all models used the same engine, the torque differed from one model to another. In Europe, however, the Evolution IX was advertised to have . The GSR produced of torque, while the RS and GT produced .

===Standard models===
* RS – &quot;rally sport&quot;, revised 5-speed, aluminium roof, gauge pack, minimal interior, LSD and a titanium-magnesium turbine, left hand drive option available.
* GT – revised 5-speed, LSD, titanium-magnesium turbine, and Recaro fabric seat, with some of the GSR&#x27;s features (mainly interior pieces).
* GSR – 6-speed, Bilstein monotube shocks, auto-air conditioner, Recaro leather with Alcantara bucket seat, aluminium roof, gauge pack, SAYC (Super Active Yaw Control), and double-din radio (this is roughly equivalent to the USDM MR).

===MR Models (Mitsubishi Racing)===
* MR GSR – same as GSR with BBS 17-inch alloy wheels, Lowered Bilstein suspension, and MR-colored front lip spoiler.
* MR RS – same as RS with MR colored front lip spoiler (auto air-conditioner, Recaro leather with Alcantara (material) bucket seat, double-din radio, Bilstein monotube shocks with lowered suspension, and SAYC (Super Active Yaw Control) are available as an option).
*MR Tuned by Ralliart – Based on Lancer Evolution VI Tommi Mäkinen Edition, The Japanese Lancer Evolution IX was exclusively tuned by Mitsubishi Ralliart; compared to the Evo IX MR GSR except for acarbon fiber front lip Spoiler, Official Ralliart livery, and Ralliart RA04 17-inch black forged aluminum wheels.

In the United Kingdom, the Evolution IX used a different model scheme based on the car&#x27;s horsepower. There were initially three models available: the FQ-300, FQ-320 and FQ-340 each with around , respectively. An FQ-360 model was subsequently released as a successor to the Evolution VIII FQ-400. While the new FQ-360 produced at 6,887 rpm (less horsepower than its predecessor), although it had more torque at at 3,200 rpm. All four models were designed to run on super unleaded petrol only. The MR FQ-360 was also released in limited numbers (only 200) in the last year of production.
* FQ-300, 320, 340 – 6-speed, Bilstein monotube shocks, AYC (Active Yaw Control).
* FQ-360 – 6-speed, Bilstein monotube shocks, AYC (Active Yaw Control), Ralliart Sports Meter Kit, carbon front splitter, Speedline alloy wheels.
* MR FQ-360 – New turbo with titanium aluminium alloy turbo fins, Speedline Turini alloy wheels, Privacy Glass, lowered Eibach coil springs ( at the front/ at the rear), IX MR interior.

Four models were available in the US. All models used the same engine.
* Standard – revised 5-speed, standard model
* RS – ralli sport, revised 5-speed, aluminum roof, gauge pack, minimal interior, also no radio
* SE – Special Edition, aluminum roof/hood, and front fenders, split seven-spoke forged aluminum BBS wheels in &quot;diamond black&quot; finish, HID headlights with integrated fog lights, red-stitched Recaro seats
* MR – 6-speed, Bilstein monotube shocks, split seven-spoke forged aluminum BBS wheels, aluminum roof, hood, and front fenders, gauge pack, HID headlights with integrated fog lights, vortex generator, front brake cooling ducts and custom MR badging.

All of the American models are the same in power, but may differ in performance. The only thing that sets them apart is the Evo RS, which is lighter than the MR and SE models.

To the standard model, the Sun, Sound and Leather package added a power sunroof, HID xenon headlamps with integrated fog lights, a slightly different stereo head unit (with no integral amplifier), slightly upgraded speakers in the front doors and parcel shelf, a 4.1-channel amplifier under the driver&#x27;s seat, a powered, trunk-mounted Infinity subwoofer, black leather seating surfaces, leather-trimmed door panels, slightly revised center armrests in the front and rear, and separate rear side headrests. This model deleted the GSR&#x27;s headliner-mounted sunglass holder to make room for the sunroof.

The Philippines had the Evolution IX until in August 2008, which was offered in two trims, the entry-level RS offering a 5-speed manual transmission, Brembo 17-inch ventilated discs (4-Pot), Brembo 16-inch ventilated drum-in-disc (2-Pot) and almost the same features as to that of the GSR trim in the international version. Some RS models had the SAYC option, while some did not. The MR was the top-of-the-line segment, which offered almost the same features as to that of the MR trim in the international version. All of them are powered by the same 4G63 turbocharged MIVEC Inline-four engine.


=== Evo Wagon ===
Mitsubishi also released an Evolution IX wagon in GT, GT-A models, and MR special versions. Variants came in a 6-speed manual (GT, MR) or a 5-speed automatic (GT-A). The automatic variant uses a non-MIVEC 4G63 sourced from the Evo VIII with a smaller turbo for increased low-down torque. It was only sold in Japan and imported to other countries as grey imports.

VIN Searching on epic-data.com has shown there was a total of 2,924 Lancer Evolution Wagons created. This includes all GT, GT-A &amp; MR versions even though Mitsubishi&#x27;s 2005 Press Release said they intended to make 2,500 Evolution Wagons.

Rarity: Approximately 50% of these cars had the 6-speed manual transmissions combined with the Evo IX MIVEC engine whilst the remaining wagons were GT-A versions.

The most common colours were Silver, Black, Blue, and Grey. White is rare and Red was very rare.

The manual transmission GT Evolution Wagon didn&#x27;t weigh much more than the Evo IX sedan but the additional approx was due to its Steel turret, steel anti-intrusion bars in the doors and the heavier foldable rear seat, along with extra weight in the tailgate and extra side glass. Evo Wagon GT-A are heavier (approx ) due to their automatic transmission and the additional weight described above in the GT wagon. Even though the Evo Wagon was made exclusively for the Japanese market some of these cars have found new homes in Europe, UK, Russia, Asia, Australia, and Canada. Some of these exported wagons have been converted to left-hand-drive vehicles for use in Germany and Russia. Compared to the Evo IX sedan, the Evolution Wagon received a front seat that had lower bolsters for easier entry and exit of the vehicle. These less sporty seats were the OEM standard seats in the Australian-delivered Evo IX sedan.

== Evolution X==
In 2005, Mitsubishi introduced a concept version of the next-gen Evolution at the 39th Tokyo Motor Show named the Concept-X, designed by Omer Halilhodžić at the company&#x27;s European design centre.
Mitsubishi unveiled a second concept car, the Prototype-X, at the 2007 North American International Auto Show (NAIAS).

The Lancer Evolution X sedan features a newly designed 4B11T turbocharged, all-aluminium alloy &quot;GEMA&quot; Inline-four engine. Power and torque depend on the market, but all versions will have at least . (JDM version), the American market version will have slightly more. The UK models were reworked by Mitsubishi UK, in accordance with previous MR Evolutions bearing the FQ badge. Options for the UK Evolutions were expected to be between and .

Two versions of the car are offered in the U.S. The Lancer Evolution MR, with 6-speed &quot;Twin-Clutch Sportronic Shift Transmission&quot; (TC-SST). The other version is the GSR which has a 5-speed manual transmission system. The car also has a new full-time four-wheel-drive system named S-AWC (Super All Wheel Control), an advanced version of Mitsubishi&#x27;s AWC system used in previous generations. The S-AWC uses torque vectoring technology to send different amounts of torque to the rear wheels.

It also features Mitsubishi&#x27;s new 6-speed &quot;SST&quot; dual-clutch automatic transmission with steering-mounted magnesium alloy shift paddles. It has replaced the Tiptronic automatic transmission, hence the SST version replaced the GT-A version (which was used in Evolution VII and Evolution IX Wagon). A five-speed manual gearbox will also be available. The new Lancer Evolution will also incorporate Mitsubishi&#x27;s next-generation &quot;RISE&quot; safety body.

The Evolution X went on sale October 1, 2007 in Japan, New Zealand &amp; some in Australia also the 07 were rare as only these countries had gotten them January 2008 in the US, February in Canada (as the first version of Evolution in Canada) and in March 2008 in the UK. The Twin Clutch SST version was available in Japan from November 2007. Europe will follow with sales in May, GSR and MR version included premium Package. The introduction of the 2010 MR-Touring moved the car even further upscale. Leather and a sunroof became standard while revising the rear spoiler to just a lip spoiler. For the police car, the British Police decided to use these Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution Xs as police cars, and the Royal Malaysia Police (Polis Diraja Malaysia) also use Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X as the Police Highway Eagle (Helang Lebuhraya Polis) patrol team. These patrol car fleet will probably be used by Highway Pursuit / Patrol or VIP Escort.

In 2014, it was revealed that Mitsubishi would discontinue production of the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution after the 2015 model year. The company expressed a desire to refocus its efforts on crossover vehicles and electric vehicles.

==Motorsports==
===Rally===
The Lancer Evolution is unique among its competitors in the World Rally Championship in that it was a homologated Group A car slightly modified to be able to race competitively against the then newly formed World Rally Car (WRC) regulations from the 1997 season. Mitsubishi continued to adhere to Group A regulations until the San Remo Rally in 2001, World Rally Car class cars. Lancer Evolutions were successful in WRC Rallies from 1996 to 1999, mostly in the hands of Finnish driver Tommi Mäkinen, clinching driver&#x27;s titles in four-consecutive seasons from 1996 to 1999 (in Evolutions III, IV, V, and VI), and with the help of teammate Richard Burns in clinching the constructors&#x27; championship for the first, and thus far only time in 1998. The Evolution however was replaced in late 2001 by the firm&#x27;s first World Rally Car, named simply the Lancer Evolution WRC, which was driven by Makinen, Freddy Loix, Alister McRae and François Delecour with relatively limited success, until Mitsubishi took a sabbatical from the championship at the end of 2002. It was succeeded for the 2004 Monte Carlo Rally by the Lancer WRC04. Mitsubishi pulled out of the World Rally Championship after the 2005 season with the Lancer WRC05 still being driven by privateers including Italian former works driver Gigi Galli and the Swede, Daniel Carlsson, in the years following. The Lancer Evolution however still competes in the Group N category.

In some European markets, the Evolution was sold as the Mitsubishi Carisma GT, and indeed to this effect the works WRC team&#x27;s second car in the late 1990s, usually driven by Burns and subsequently Loix, was customarily entered as a &quot;Carisma GT&quot;. Proton Motors of Malaysia raced Evolution III&#x27;s, Evolution V&#x27;s (most notable with Proton 1784 where Malaysian driver Karamjit Singh won the 2002 Production Car WRC) and an Evolution VII as the Proton PERT in various Asia-Pacific Rally Championship and APAC rally series.

===Track racing===
The Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution won the 2009 Australian Manufacturers&#x27; Championship with a trio of Evolution X models.

The Mitsubishi Evo has recently won and made runner-up in the 2011 Australian Manufacturers&#x27; Championship.

Most recently, (2005–2006) the CT9A chassis Evolution has been dominant in Time Attack (time trials) throughout the world. CyberEvo&#x27;s CT9A chassis Lancer Evolution (now retired) previously held the OEM chassis record at Japan&#x27;s Tsukuba Circuit for Time Attack, as well as the Australian record at Eastern Creek Raceway. Sierra Sierra Enterprise&#x27;s CT9A chassis Evolution holds the U.S. Time Attack record. The Tilton Interiors CT9A chassis Lancer Evolution held the time attack record at Sydney Motorsport Park until October 2016 where MCA &quot;Hammerhead&quot; Nissan Silvia reset the record.

The Lancer Evolution VIII was used in Stock Car Brasil from 2005 to 2008, with Cacá Bueno won the series twice from 2006 to 2007.

The car won the 2008 and 2009 WPS Bathurst 12 Hour endurance race.

The Mitsubishi Lancer Evo has also been used by professional drifters in countries like Japan, Italy and Poland, with notable results being obtained by driver Naoto Suenaga of Team Orange.

===Hill climbing===
The Evolution IX won the European Hill Climb Championship 11 times since 2007, with 13 wins also in the FIA International Hill Climb Cup.

==Awards==
The Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution won Consumer Search&#x27;s best Aggressive sports sedan in Best Sports Sedans in June 2006. During 2004–2005 alone it won six major awards, being declared &quot;Sports Car of the Year&quot; in Scotland and France, &quot;&quot;Playboy&quot; Sports Car 2004&quot; in Poland, &quot;Best New Production Car Under €60,000&quot; in Greece, &quot;Sport Compact Car of the Year&quot; in 2004 and 2005 (&quot;Sport Compact Car&quot; magazine) and &quot;2005 All-Star&quot; (&quot;Automobile&quot; magazine) in the United States and &quot;Motor&quot; magazine&#x27;s Best &quot;Bang for Your Bucks&quot; Australia. Also in 2004, the Lancer Evo was presented with the Editors&#x27; Choice Award by &quot;Grassroots Motorsports&quot;. The Lancer Evolution X was named as the &quot;Best Performance Car under $50K&quot; by Canadian TV show &quot;Motoring 2009&quot;, and won the Automobile Journalists Association of Canada&#x27;s 2009 &quot;Best New Technology&quot; award. It was also nominated as one of the top 10 &quot;World Performance Car of the Year&quot;, won the Automotive Excellence Awards&#x27; 2008 &quot;Fun to Drive&quot; category, and took Dave TV&#x27;s &quot;Sports Car of the Year&quot; award in 2008.

<text>Jo Jorgensen (born May 1, 1957) is an American libertarian political activist and academic. Jorgensen was the Libertarian Party&#x27;s nominee for president of the United States in the 2020 election, in which she finished third in the popular vote with about 1.9 million votes, 1.2% of the national total. She was previously the party&#x27;s nominee for vice president in the 1996 election, as Harry Browne&#x27;s running mate. She is a full-time lecturer of psychology at Clemson University.

== Early life and career ==
Jorgensen was born on May 1, 1957, in Libertyville, Illinois, and raised in neighboring Grayslake. She is an alumna of Grayslake Central High School. Her grandparents were Danish immigrants.

Jorgensen received a Bachelor of Science degree in psychology at Baylor University in 1979 and a master&#x27;s degree in business administration at Southern Methodist University in 1980. She began her career at IBM working with computer systems, leaving to become part owner and President of Digitech, Inc. She received a Ph.D. in Industrial and Organizational Psychology from Clemson University in 2002. She has taught full-time at Clemson since 2006.

==Political career ==
=== 1992 U.S. House of Representatives campaign ===
Jorgensen first ran for office in the 1992 United States House of Representatives election. She ran as a Libertarian to represent SC-04, in northwest South Carolina, against incumbent Democrat Liz J. Patterson and Republican challenger Bob Inglis. Jorgensen placed third with 2.2% of the total vote.

=== 1996 vice presidential campaign ===

Before the 1996 United States presidential election, the Libertarian Party nominated Jorgensen for vice president, as Harry Browne&#x27;s running mate. She was nominated on the first ballot with 92% of the vote. She participated in a vice-presidential debate televised nationwide by C-SPAN on October 22, along with Herbert Titus of the Taxpayers Party and Mike Tompkins of the Natural Law Party.

Browne and Jorgensen, who were on the ballot in all 50 states and D.C., received 485,759 votes, finishing in fifth place with 0.5% of the popular vote. This was the Libertarian Party&#x27;s best performance since 1980.

=== 2020 presidential campaign ===
On August 13, 2019, Jorgensen filed with the FEC to run for the Libertarian presidential nomination in the 2020 election. She formally launched her campaign at the November 2, 2019, Libertarian Party of South Carolina convention before participating in the South Carolina Libertarian presidential debate the same day.

In the non-binding Libertarian primaries, Jorgensen was second in the cumulative popular vote, winning two of the 12 primaries.

On May 23, 2020, Jorgensen became the Libertarian presidential nominee, making her the first woman to be the Libertarian nominee and the only female 2020 presidential candidate with ballot access to over 270 electoral votes. Spike Cohen, a mostly unknown figure in mainstream politics, was nominated for vice president. The same day, Jorgensen&#x27;s supporters repurposed Hillary Clinton&#x27;s unofficial 2016 campaign slogan, &quot;I&#x27;m With Her&quot;. The slogan trended on Twitter that night and made national headlines. She registered minimal support in opinion polling.

Jorgensen released a list of potential Supreme Court nominees in September 2020 in response to the vacancy on the Court created by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg&#x27;s death.

Jorgensen received more than 1.8 million votes in the general election, about 1.2% of the national total.

After the election, several media outlets speculated that Jorgensen&#x27;s candidacy resulted in vote splitting significant enough to be decisive in Democrat Joe Biden&#x27;s victory over Republican Donald Trump, pointing to Jorgensen&#x27;s vote share being higher than Biden&#x27;s margin of victory over Trump in multiple battleground states. While many pundits claimed that Trump would have won had she not run, others believed that many Jorgensen voters would have abstained from voting, as opposed to voting for Trump.

== Political positions ==
=== Healthcare and social security ===
Jorgensen supports a free-market healthcare system financed by individual spending accounts that could keep any savings, which she believes would increase healthcare providers&#x27; incentive to compete by meeting consumer demand for low-cost services. She opposes single-payer healthcare, calling it &quot;disastrous&quot;.

Jorgensen supports replacing Social Security with individual retirement accounts. In the final debate of the 2020 primaries, candidate Jacob Hornberger accused Jorgensen of &quot;support[ing] the welfare state through Social Security and Medicare&quot;. In response, she called Social Security a &quot;Ponzi scheme&quot;. She then expressed the desire to allow people to opt out of the program on her first day in office, while emphasizing the constitutional inability of a president to unilaterally end the program without Congress&#x27;s support, as well as the need for the government to fulfill existing Social Security obligations. Under Jorgensen&#x27;s plan, those who opt out would put 6.2% of their payroll taxes in individual retirement accounts and receive prorated Social Security benefits for existing contributions as zero-coupon bonds for retirement.

=== Criminal justice and drug policy ===

Jorgensen opposes federal civil asset forfeiture and qualified immunity. She opposes the war on drugs and supports abolishing drug laws, promising to pardon all nonviolent drug offenders. She has urged the demilitarization of police. Additionally, Jorgensen supports the Second Amendment.

=== Foreign policy and defense ===
Jorgensen opposes embargoes, economic sanctions, and foreign aid; she supports non-interventionism, armed neutrality, and the withdrawal of U.S. troops from abroad.

=== Immigration, economics, and trade ===
Jorgensen calls for deregulation, arguing that it would reduce poverty. She supports cutting government spending to reduce taxes.

Jorgensen supports the freedom of American citizens to travel and trade, calls for the elimination of trade barriers and tariffs, and supports the repeal of quotas on the number of people who can legally enter the United States to work, visit, or reside. In a Libertarian presidential primary debate, Jorgensen said she would immediately stop construction on President Donald Trump&#x27;s border wall. During another primary debate she blamed anti-immigration sentiment on disproportionate media coverage of crimes by immigrants. She argued that immigration helps the economy and that the blending of cultures is beneficial.

=== COVID-19 ===
Jorgensen has characterized the U.S. government&#x27;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic as overly bureaucratic and authoritarian, calling restrictions on individual behavior (such as stay-at-home orders) and corporate bailouts &quot;the biggest assault on our liberties in our lifetime&quot;.

Jorgensen opposes government mask mandates, considering mask-wearing a matter of personal choice. She argues that mask-wearing would be widely adopted without government intervention because market competition would drive businesses to adopt either mask-required or mask-optional policies, allowing consumers the freedom to choose their preferred environment. Jorgensen has invoked the analogy of dollar voting to argue that consumer preferences would shape businesses&#x27; policies on face masks in the absence of a government mandate.

== Personal life ==
Jorgensen is married and has two adult daughters and a grandson. She briefly paused her presidential campaign after her mother&#x27;s death on September 3, 2020.

<doc id="531528" wikidata="Q8062340" url="?curid=531528" title="Yves Prévost">
<text>Yves Prévost (July 11, 1908 – November 27, 1997) was a politician and lawyer in Quebec, Canada.

He was first elected in 1948 for the riding of Montmorency. He served as interim leader of the &quot;Union Nationale&quot; party and leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly of Quebec from September 1960 to January 1961. He became party leader after UN leader and former premier Antonio Barrette lost the 1960 election and resigned his seat and the UN leadership a few months later.

In January 1961, he was replaced as interim UN leader and leader of the Opposition by Antonio Talbot, and he did not run in the 1962 election.

Prior to his provincial political career, Prevost served as mayor of the city of Beauport (now part of Quebec City) from 1948 to 1952 and was worked for the Beauport School Board for nearly 20 years at high-class various positions.

In 1956, he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St. Gregory the Great.

<text>Malibu Creek State Park is a state park of California, United States, preserving the Malibu Creek canyon in the Santa Monica Mountains. The park was established in 1974. Opened to the public in 1976, the park is also a component of Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.

==Geography==
Malibu Creek State Park stretches from below Malibou Lake in the west to Piuma Road in the east. It follows the creek down to the Pacific Ocean and includes the Adamson House and creek&#x27;s mouth in the Malibu Lagoon at the beach. Tapia Park has recently been incorporated as a subunit of the park. The park includes three natural preserves: Liberty Canyon, Udell Gorge, and Kaslow Preserve.

==History==
The land that is now Malibu Creek State Park was inhabited by native Chumash people for millennia. The site of a village called &quot;Talepop&quot; has been uncovered by archaeologists in the northeast corner of the park. The Chumash were most famous for their wood plank canoes, which they used to travel the coastline for hundreds of miles. By the 1860s a few homesteads existed, including the Sepulveda Adobe, which still stands.

In 1900 a group of wealthy Los Angeles businessmen created the Crags Country Club and purchased along Malibu Creek. In 1903 a dam was built nearby, creating a lake that was later purchased by 20th Century Fox and named Century Lake. The three-level, Crags Club Lodge was completed in 1910. Redwood trees were planted near the lake that same year, and today stand as the southernmost specimens in California. Also within park boundaries is the Rindge Dam in Malibu Canyon, built in 1926. The Crags Country Club ceased operations in 1936 and the lodge was torn down in 1955.

The majority of the park&#x27;s lands were donated by entertainer Bob Hope. Other parts of the park, added later, were previously owned by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox for movie ranches. Part of the former 20th Century Fox Ranch had been purchased in 1966 from Ronald Reagan. The Reagan ranch, known as &quot;Yearling Row&quot;, was owned by the future president from 1951 to 1966 (Reagan earlier owned another ranch also called Yearling Row in Northridge, California). It was sold by the Reagans to pay campaign debts from the 1966 California governor&#x27;s campaign. Additional parcels have been connected by the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.

In 2014, adjacent Cameron Nature Preserve in Puerco Canyon was acquired by the Santa Monica Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority. This created a contiguous block of public parkland from this park to Corral Canyon Park and will provide a path for the Coastal Slope Trail. The was purchased from Oscar-winning director James Cameron.

In 2018 substantial portions of the park, including the Reagan ranch and the Fox Ranch location for many films and television shows, were burned and destroyed by the Woolsey Fire.

==Landmarks==

=== King Gillette Ranch ===
Most recently an area was annexed to the park known as the King Gillette Ranch, with a landmark Spanish Colonial Revival style residence and estate buildings designed by renowned architect Wallace Neff in the 1920s for owner King C. Gillette, the early-20th-century inventor and manufacturer of the Gillette disposable razor. It was later used by the Catholic Claretian Order as Claretville in the 1950s–60s, then by several other spiritual groups, and finally by Soka University in the 1990s until the recent purchase for the park. The new visitor center for the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area is located here in the historic Stables compound.

===Sepúlveda Adobe===
The Sepúlveda Adobe, a 19th-century ranch house, was built by the Sepúlveda family of California, a prominent Californio family of Southern California, is located within the park.

== Films shot at the Fox Ranch ==
When owned by 20th Century Fox, the park was known as the Fox Ranch, which was a remote backlot for their movie productions for decades. The park was a key filming location for the film &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; (1970) and the subsequent television series (1972–83). The landscape was particularly seen in the opening credits for the show as helicopters carrying wounded approach the hospital with the recognizable Goat Buttes in the background.
Other television programs that used the park to pass for a post-apocalyptic Earth were &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; and the children&#x27;s program &quot;Ark II&quot;. This was also a location for &quot;Robin Hood: Men in Tights&quot; where the Goat Buttes are seen in the background of the final wedding scene. While the park continues to be used for occasional filming, it has been a location in dozens of films, beginning with a number of Tarzan movies:

* &quot;Tarzan Escapes&quot; (1936), &quot;Tarzan&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (1938), &quot;Tarzan Finds a Son!&quot; (1939)

<text>Countee Cullen (born Countee LeRoy Porter; May 30, 1903 – January 9, 1946) was an American poet, novelist, children&#x27;s writer, and playwright, particularly well known during the Harlem Renaissance.

==Early life==

=== Childhood ===
Countee LeRoy Porter was born on May 30, 1903, to Elizabeth Thomas Lucas. Due to a lack of records of his early childhood, historians have had difficulty identifying his birthplace. Baltimore, Maryland, New York City, and Louisville, Kentucky have been cited as possibilities. Although Cullen claimed to have been born in New York City, he also frequently referred to Louisville, Kentucky, as his birthplace on legal applications. Cullen was brought to Harlem at the age of nine by Amanda Porter, believed to be his paternal grandmother, who cared for him until her death in 1917.

Reverend Frederick A. Cullen, pastor of Salem Methodist Episcopal Church, Harlem&#x27;s largest congregation, and his wife, the former Carolyn Belle Mitchell, adopted the 15-year-old Countee Porter, although the adoption may not have been official. Frederick Cullen was a central figure in Countee&#x27;s life, and acted as his father. The influential minister eventually became president of the Harlem chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).

===DeWitt Clinton High School===
Cullen entered the DeWitt Clinton High School, then located in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen. He excelled academically at the school and started writing poetry. He won a citywide poetry contest. At DeWitt, he was elected into the honor society, was editor of the weekly newspaper, and was elected vice-president of his graduating class. In January 1922, he graduated with honors in Latin, Greek, Mathematics, and French.

===New York University, Harvard University and early publications===
After graduating from high school, he attended New York University (NYU). In 1923, at the Town Hall in New York City, he gave a speech to the League of Youth in which he said, “For we must be one thing or the other, an asset or a liability, the sinew in your wing to help you soar, or the chain to bind you to earth.” The speech was later printed in &quot;The Crisis&quot; (August 1923). Also in 1923, Cullen won second prize in the Witter Bynner National Competitions for Undergraduate Poetry, sponsored by the Poetry Society of America, for his book of poems titled, &quot;The Ballad of the Brown Girl&quot;. Soon after, he was publishing poetry in national periodicals such as &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;The Crisis&quot;, , &quot;The Bookman&quot;, and &quot;Poetry&quot;, earning him a national reputation. The ensuing year, he again placed second in the contest, finally winning first prize in 1925. He competed in a poetry contest sponsored by &quot;Opportunity&quot; and came in second with &quot;To One Who Say Me Nay&quot;, losing to Langston Hughes&#x27;s &quot;The Weary Blues&quot;. Cullen graduated from NYU in 1925 and was one of eleven students selected to Phi Beta Kappa.

That same year, Cullen entered Harvard to pursue a master&#x27;s in English, and published &quot;Color&quot;, his first collection of poems that later became a landmark of the Harlem Renaissance. Written in a careful, traditional style, the work celebrated black beauty and deplored the effects of racism. The volume included &quot;Heritage&quot; and &quot;Incident&quot;, probably his most famous poems. &quot;Yet Do I Marvel&quot;, about racial identity and injustice, showed the literary influence of William Wordsworth and William Blake, but its subject was far from the world of their Romantic sonnets. The poet accepts that there is God, and &quot;God is good, well-meaning, kind&quot;, but he finds a contradiction in his own plight in a racist society: he is black and a poet. In 1926, Cullen graduated with a master&#x27;s degree while also serving as the guest editor of a special &quot;Negro Poets&quot; issue of the poetry magazine, &quot;Palms&quot;. The appointment led to &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; inviting him to edit an anthology of Black poetry in 1927.

== Sexuality ==
American writer Alain Locke helped Cullen come to terms with his sexuality. Locke wanted to introduce a new generation of African-American writers, such as Countee Cullen, to the reading public. Locke also sought to present the authentic natures of sex and sexuality through writing, creating a kind of relationship with those who felt the same. Locke introduced Cullen to gay-affirming material, such as the work of Edward Carpenter, at a time when most gays were in the closet. In March 1923, Cullen wrote to Locke about Carpenter&#x27;s work: &quot;It opened up for me soul windows which had been closed; it threw a noble and evident light on what I had begun to believe, because of what the world believes, ignoble and unnatural&quot;.

Critics and historians have not reached consensus as to Cullen&#x27;s sexuality, partly because Cullen was unsure of this himself. Cullen&#x27;s first marriage, to Yolande Du Bois, experienced difficulties before ending in divorce. He subsequently had relationships with many different men, although each ended poorly. Each relationship had a sense of shame or secrecy, such as his relationship with Edward Atkinson. Cullen later married Ida Robertson while potentially in a relationship with Atkinson. Letters between Cullen and Atkinson suggest a romantic interest, although there is no concrete evidence that they were in a sexual relationship.

== Relationships ==

Cullen married Yolande Du Bois on April 9, 1928. She was the surviving child of W. E. B. Du Bois and his first wife Nina Gomer Du Bois, whose son had died as an infant. The two young people were said to have been introduced by Cullen&#x27;s close friend Harold Jackman. They met in the summer of 1923 when both were in college: she was at Fisk University and he was at NYU. Cullen&#x27;s parents owned a summer home in Pleasantville, New Jersey near the Jersey Shore, and Yolande and her family were likely also vacationing in the area when they first met.

While at Fisk, Yolande had had a romantic relationship with the jazz saxophonist Jimmie Lunceford. However, her father disapproved of Lunceford. The relationship ended after Yolande accepted her father&#x27;s preference of a marriage to Cullen.

The wedding was the social event of the decade among the African-American elite. Cullen, along with W.E.B. Du Bois, planned the details of the wedding with little help from Yolande. Every detail of the wedding, including the rail car used for transportation and Cullen receiving the marriage license four days prior to the wedding day, was considered big news and was reported to the public by the African-American press. His father, Frederick A. Cullen, officiated at the wedding. The church was overcrowded, as 3,000 people came to witness the ceremony.

After the newly wedded couple had a short honeymoon, Cullen traveled to Paris with his guardian/father, Frederick Cullen, and best man Jackman. Yolande soon joined him there, but they had difficulties from the first. A few months after their wedding, Cullen wrote a letter to Yolande confessing his love for men. Yolande told her father and filed for divorce. Her father wrote separately to Cullen, saying that he thought Yolande&#x27;s lack of sexual experience was the reason the marriage did not work out. The couple divorced in 1930 in Paris. The details were negotiated between Cullen and Yolande&#x27;s father, as the wedding details had been.

With the exception of this marriage before a huge congregation, Cullen was a shy person. He was not flamboyant with any of his relationships. It was rumored that Cullen had developed a relationship with Jackman, &quot;the handsomest man in Harlem&quot;, which contributed to Cullen and Yolande&#x27;s divorce. The young, dashing Jackman was a school teacher and, thanks to his handsome visage, a prominent figure among Harlem&#x27;s gay elite. According to Thomas Wirth, author of &quot;Gay Rebel of the Harlem Renaissance, Selections from the Work of Richard Bruce Nugent&quot;, there is no evidence that the men were lovers, despite newspaper stories and gossip suggesting the contrary. Scholars have not reached consensus on Cullen&#x27;s sexuality. He married Ida Mae Roberson in 1940 and lived, apparently happily, with her until his death in 1946. In the early 1940s, they lived on Sugar Hill in West Harlem at the Garrison Apartments. 

Jackman&#x27;s diaries, letters, and outstanding collections of memorabilia are held in depositories across the country, such as the Amistad Research Center at Tulane University in New Orleans and Clark Atlanta University in Atlanta, Georgia. At Cullen&#x27;s death, Jackman requested that his collection in Georgia be renamed, from the Harold Jackman Collection to the Countee Cullen Memorial Collection, in honor of his friend. After Jackman died of cancer in 1961, the collection at Clark Atlanta University was renamed as the Cullen-Jackman Collection to honor them both.

== Harlem Renaissance ==

The Harlem Renaissance movement was centered in the cosmopolitan community of Harlem, in New York City, which had attracted talented migrants from across the country. During the 1920s, a fresh generation of African-American writers emerged, although a few were Harlem-born. Other leading figures included Alain Locke (&quot;The New Negro&quot;, 1925), James Weldon Johnson (&quot;Black Manhattan&quot;, 1930), Claude McKay (&quot;Home to Harlem&quot;, 1928), Langston Hughes (&quot;The Weary Blues&quot;, 1926), Zora Neale Hurston (&quot;Jonah&#x27;s Gourd Vine&quot;, 1934), Wallace Thurman (&quot;Harlem: A Melodrama of Negro Life&quot;, 1929), Jean Toomer (&quot;Cane&quot;, 1923) and Arna Bontemps (&quot;Black Thunder&quot;, 1935). Writers benefited from newly available grants and scholarships, and were supported by such established white writers as Carl Van Vechten.

The Harlem Renaissance was influenced by a movement called &quot;Négritude&quot;, which represents &quot;the discovery of black values and the Negro’s awareness of his situation&quot;. Cullen saw Negritude as an awakening of a race consciousness and black modernism that flowed into Harlem. Cullen&#x27;s poetry &quot;Heritage&quot; and &quot;Dark Tower&quot; reflect ideas of the Negritude movement. These poems examine African roots and intertwine them with a fresh aspect of African-American life.

Cullen&#x27;s work intersects with the Harlem community and such prominent figures of the Renaissance as Duke Ellington and poet and playwright Langston Hughes. Ellington admired Cullen for confronting a history of oppression and shaping a new voice of “great achievement over fearful odds”. Cullen maintained close friendships with two other prominent writers, Hughes and Alain Locke. However, Hughes critiqued Cullen, albeit indirectly, and other Harlem Renaissance writers, for the “desire to run away spiritually from [their] race”. Hughes condemned “the desire to pour racial individuality into the mold of American standardization, and to be as little Negro and as much American as possible.” Though Hughes critiqued Cullen, he still admired his work and noted the significance of his writing.

== Professional career ==
The social, cultural, and artistic explosion known as the Harlem Renaissance was the first time in American history that a large body of literary, art and musical work was contributed by African-American writers and artists. Cullen was at the epicenter of this new-found surge in literature. He considered poetry to be raceless. However, his poem &quot;The Black Christ&quot; took on a racial theme, exploring a black youth convicted of a crime he did not commit. &quot;But shortly after in the early 1930s, his work was almost completely [free] of racial subject matter. His poetry instead focused on idyllic beauty and other classic romantic subjects.&quot;

Cullen worked as assistant editor for &quot;Opportunity&quot; magazine, where his column, &quot;The Dark Tower&quot;, increased his literary reputation. Cullen&#x27;s poetry collections &quot;The Ballad of the Brown Girl&quot; (1927) and &quot;Copper Sun&quot; (1927) explored similar themes as &quot;Color&quot;, but they were not so well received. Cullen&#x27;s Guggenheim Fellowship of 1928 enabled him to study and write abroad.

Between the years 1928 and 1934, Cullen traveled back and forth between France and the United States. By 1929 Cullen had published four volumes of poetry. The title poem of &quot;The Black Christ and Other Poems&quot; (1929) was criticized for its use of Christian religious imagery; Cullen compared the lynching of a black man to the crucifixion of Jesus.

As well as writing books, Cullen promoted the work of other black writers. But by 1930 his reputation as a poet had waned. In 1932, his only novel was published, &quot;One Way to Heaven&quot;, a social comedy of lower-class blacks and the bourgeoisie in New York City.

From 1934 until the end of his life, he taught English, French, and creative writing at Frederick Douglass Junior High School in New York City. During this period, he also wrote two works for young readers: &quot;The Lost Zoo&quot; (1940), poems about the animals who were killed in the Flood, and &quot;My Lives and How I Lost Them&quot;, an autobiography of his cat. Along with Herman W. Porter, Cullen also provided guidance to a young James Baldwin during his time at the school.

In the last years of his life, Cullen wrote mostly for the theatre. He worked with Arna Bontemps to adapt Bontemps&#x27;s 1931 novel &quot;God Sends Sunday&quot; as the musical &quot;St. Louis Woman&quot; (1946, published in 1971). Its score was composed by Harold Arlen and Johnny Mercer, both white. The Broadway musical, set in a poor black neighborhood of St. Louis, Missouri, was criticized by black intellectuals for creating a negative image of black Americans. In another stretch, Cullen translated the Greek tragedy &quot;Medea&quot; by Euripides, which was published in 1935 as &quot;The Medea and Some Poems&quot;, with a collection of sonnets and short lyrics.

Several years later, Cullen died from high blood pressure and uremic poisoning on January 9, 1946, aged 42. He is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.

==Honors==
The Countee Cullen Library, a Harlem branch location of the New York Public Library, was named in his honor. In 2013, he was inducted into the New York Writers Hall of Fame.

In 1949 the anthology radio drama &quot;Destination Freedom&quot;, written by Richard Durham, recapped parts of his life.

== Literary influences ==
Due to Cullen&#x27;s mixed identity, he developed an aesthetic that embraced both black and white cultures. He was a firm believer that poetry surpassed race and that it could be used to bring the races closer together. Although race was a recurring theme in his works, Cullen wanted to be known as a poet not strictly defined by race.

Cullen developed his Eurocentric style of writing from his exposure to Graeco-Roman Classics and English Literature, work he was exposed to while attending universities like New York University and Harvard. In his collection of poems &quot;To the Three for Whom the Book&quot; Cullen uses Greek methodology to explore race and identity and writes about Medusa, Theseus, Phasiphae, and the Minotaur. Although continuing to develop themes of race and identity in his work, Cullen found artistic inspiration in ancient Greek and Roman literature.

Cullen was also influenced by the Romantics and studied subjects of love, romance, and religion. John Keats and Edna St. Vincent Millay both influenced Cullen&#x27;s style of writing. In &quot;Caroling Dusk,&quot; an anthology edited by Cullen, he expands on his belief of using a Eurocentric style of writing. He writes: &quot;As heretical as it may sound, there is the probability that Negro poets, dependent as they are on the English language, may have more to gain from the rich background of English and American poetry than from the nebulous atavistic yearnings towards an African inheritance.&quot; Cullen believed that African-American poets should work within the English conventions of poetry to prove to white Americans that African Americans could participate in these classic traditions. He believed using a more traditional style of writing poetry would allow African Americans to build bridges between the black and white communities.

== Major works ==

=== &quot;Color&quot; ===

&quot;Color&quot; is Countee Cullen&#x27;s first published book and color is &quot;in every sense its prevailing characteristic.&quot; Cullen discusses heavy topics regarding race and the distance of one&#x27;s heritage from their motherland and how it is lost. It has been said that his poems fall into a variety of categories: those that with no mention were made of color. Secondly, the poems that circled around the consciousness of African Americans and how being a &quot;Negro in a day like this&quot; in America is very cruel. Through Cullen&#x27;s writing, readers can view his own subjectivity of his inner workings and how he viewed the Negro soul and mind. He discusses the psychology of African Americans in his writings and gives an extra dimension that forces the reader to see a harsh reality of Americas past time. &quot;Heritage&quot; is one of Countee Cullen&#x27;s best-known poems published in this book. Although it is published in Color, it originally appeared in &quot;The Survey&quot;, March 1, 1925. Count Cullen wrote &quot;Heritage&quot; during a time when African-American artists were dreaming of Africa. During the Harlem Renaissance, Cullen, Hughes, and other poets were using their creative energy trying fuse Africa into the narrative of their African-American lives. In &quot;Heritage&quot;, Cullen grapples with the separation of his African culture and history created by the institution of slavery. To Cullen, Africa was not a place of which he had personal knowledge. It was a place that he knew through someone else&#x27;s description, passed down through generations. Africa was a place of heritage. Throughout the poem, he struggles with the cost of the cultural conversion and religious conversion of his ancestors when they were away &quot;torn from Africa&quot;.

=== &quot;The Black Christ&quot; ===
&quot;The Black Christ&quot; was a collection of poems published at the height of Cullen&#x27;s career in 1929. The poems examine the relationship of faith and justice among African Americans. In some of the poems, Cullen equates the suffering of Christ in his crucifixion and the suffering of African Americans. This collection poems captures Cullen&#x27;s idealistic aesthetic of race pride and religious skepticism. &quot;The Black Christ&quot; also takes a close look at the racial violence in America during the 1920s. By the time Cullen published this book of poetry, the concept of the Black Messiah was prevalent in other African-American writers such as Langston Hughes, Claude Mackay, and Jean Toomer.

=== &quot;Copper Sun&quot; ===
&quot;Copper Sun&quot; is a collection of poetry published in New York in 1927. The collection examines the sense of love, particularly a love or unity between white and black people. In some poems, love is ominous and leads to death. However, in general, the love extends not only to people but to natural elements such as plants, trees, etc. Many of the poems also link the concept of love to a Christian background. Yet, Cullen was also attracted to something both pagan as well as Christian. in one of his poems &quot;One Day We Played a Game&quot;, the theme of love appears. The speaker calls: First love! First love!&#x27; I urged&quot;. (The poem portrays love as necessary to continue in life and that it is basic to life as the corner stone or the fundamental of building home.) Similarly, in &quot;Love&#x27;s Way&quot;, Cullen&#x27;s poem portrays a love that shares and unifies the world. The poem suggests that &quot;love is not demanding, all, itself/ Withholding aught; love&#x27;s is nobler way/ of courtesy&quot; . In the poem, the speaker contends that &quot;Love rehabilitates unto the end.&quot; Love fixes itself, regrows, and heals.

<doc id="531546" wikidata="Q977541" url="?curid=531546" title="NLX (form factor)">
<text>NLX (short for New Low Profile eXtended) was a form factor proposed by Intel and developed jointly with IBM, DEC, and other vendors for low profile, low cost, mass-marketed retail PCs. Release 1.2 was finalized in March 1997 and release 1.8 was finalized in April 1999. NLX was similar in overall design to LPX, including a riser card and a low-profile slimline case. It was modernized and updated to allow support for the latest technologies while keeping costs down and fixing the main problems with LPX. It specified motherboards from to in size.

Officially, the NLX form factor was designed to use ATX power supplies and featured the same soft power function. However, for size reduction, some NLX cases instead used the smaller SFX form factor or proprietary form factors with the same 20-pin connector.

Many slimline systems that were formerly designed to fit the LPX form factor were modified to fit NLX. NLX is a true standard, unlike LPX, making interchangeability of components easier than it was for the older form factor. IBM, Gateway, and NEC produced a fair number of NLX computers in the late 1990s, primarily for Socket 370 (Pentium II-III and Celeron), but NLX never enjoyed the widespread acceptance that LPX had. Most importantly, one of the largest PC manufacturers, Dell decided against using NLX and created their own proprietary motherboards for use in their slimline systems. Although many of these computers and motherboards are still available secondhand, new production has essentially ceased, and in the slimline and small form factor market, NLX has been superseded by the Micro-ATX, FlexATX, and Mini-ITX form factors.

<doc id="531551" wikidata="Q1000033" url="?curid=531551" title="Lanškroun">
<text>Lanškroun (; ) is a town in Ústí nad Orlicí District in the Pardubice Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 9,800 inhabitants. It lies on the border of the historical lands of Bohemia and Moravia. The historic town centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument zone.

==Administrative division==
Lanškroun consists of four municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):

*Lanškroun-Vnitřní Město (488)
*Ostrovské Předměstí (2,670)
*Žichlínské Předměstí (5,437)
*Dolní Třešňovec (875)
==Etymology==
The original historic name of Lanškroun was &quot;Landeskrone&quot;, meaning &quot;Land&#x27;s crown&quot;. It referred to its location on the border of the historical lands of Bohemia and Moravia.

==Geography==
Lanškroun is located about northeast of Ústí nad Orlicí and east of Pardubice. It lies in the Orlické Foothills. The highest point is at above sea level.

The stream Třešňovský potok flows through the town. In the northwestern part of the municipal territory is a set of six fishponds on the stream Ostrovský potok. The largest of them is Dlouhý, used for recreational purposes and water sports. The northernmost ponds (Pšeničkův and Olšový) and the area around the stream Zadní potok before its confluence with the Ostrovský potok is protected as the nature reserve &quot;Landškrounské rybníky&quot; within the Lanškroun Ponds Nature Park. The Moravská Sázava River briefly crosses the territory of Lanškroun in the south, and the Ostrovský potok joins the Moravská Sázava there.

==History==

The first written mention of Lanškroun is from 1285, when it was donated by King Wenceslaus II to Záviš of Falkenstein. Lanškroun was founded during the colonization in the second half of the 13th century under the name &quot;Landeskrone&quot;. It became the economical centre of the large estate of Lanšperk and later of separate Lanškroun estate.

In 1304, Lanškroun property of the Zbraslav Monastery and in 1358, it was acquired by Roman Catholic Diocese of Leitomischl. In 1371, an Augustinian monastery was founded. In 1421, the town was conquered by Jan Žižka. After the Hussite Wars, the estate was acquired by the noble family of Kostka of Postupice. It began to prosper and obtained various privileges. In 1507, it was bought by the Pernštejn family. Then it was shortly held by the Hrzáns of Harasov, and after the Battle of White Mountain, it was bought by the Liechtenstein family.

During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the town was repeatedly burned down and looted by the Swedish army and the catholicization began. After the war, the population was significantly decreased. It was repopulated by German settlers and in 1683, German has become the official language.

During the 18th century, Lanškroun was an average serf town. In 1848, the serfdom was abolished and Lanškroun became a district town. In the 1870s, the industrialization began. The railway was built in 1884–1885.

Until 1918, the town was part of Austria-Hungary as the seat of the district Landskron in Bömen, one of the 94 &quot;Bezirkshauptmannschaften&quot; in Bohemia. After 1919 it became part of Czechoslovakia. In 1938 it was occupied by German troops according to the Munich Agreement. Since 1939 it was administered as part of the Reichsgau Sudetenland.

Shortly after the end of World War II, on 17 May 1945, the event known as the Lanškroun Massacre or Lanškroun Blood Court happened. Czech partisans drove all the Germans into the town square. Several hundred Germans had to stand there with their hands above their heads and 31 of them were sentenced to death by a self-proclaimed people&#x27;s court. It was a retribution for the atrocities against the Czech population during the war, which, according to historians, got out of control.

Until the expulsion of the German speaking population from Lanškroun in 1946, the majority of population of the town had been German. After the expulsion, the town became completely Czech. In 1945, it ceased to be a district town.

==Demographics==
==Economy==
Lanškroun is an industrial town. The most important sectors are the electronics industry, engineering and paper industry. The largest employers are Kyocera AVX Component and Schott CR (both manufacturers of electronic components), and Schaeffler Production CZ (manufacturer of rolling element bearings).

==Transport==
The I/43 road from Brno and Svitavy to the Czech-Polish border in Králíky passes through the town. 

Lanškroun is the terminus and start of the railway line heading from/to Česká Třebová.

==Sights==

Lanškroun is known for its large Renaissance town hall, which is one of the symbols of the town. It was built in 1581–1582. The two original Renaissance portals are preserved.

The original monastery from the 14th century was rebuilt into a Renaissance castle. The reconstruction was completed in 1601. From the 1650s to 1716, it was rebuilt to its current appearance. Today it houses the town museum. The Church of Saint Wenceslaus is adjacent to the castle and stood here before the founding of the monastery. It was first mentioned in 1350 and originally was consecrated to the Virgin Mary. It was reconstructed several times; the tower was added in 1768.

<doc id="531552" wikidata="Q1138034" url="?curid=531552" title="Ground proximity warning system">
<text>A ground proximity warning system (GPWS) is a system designed to alert pilots if their aircraft is in immediate danger of flying into the ground or an obstacle. The United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) defines GPWS as a type of terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS). More advanced systems, introduced in 1996, are known as enhanced ground proximity warning systems (EGPWS), a modern type of TAWS.

==History==
In the late 1960s, a series of controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents took the lives of hundreds of people. A CFIT accident is one where a properly functioning airplane under the control of a fully qualified and certified crew is flown into terrain, water or obstacles with no apparent awareness on the part of the crew.

Beginning in the early 1970s, a number of studies examined the occurrence of CFIT accidents. Findings from these studies indicated that many such accidents could have been avoided if a warning device called a ground proximity warning system (GPWS) had been used. As a result of these studies and recommendations from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), in 1974, the FAA required all large turbine and turbojet airplanes to install TSO-approved GPWS equipment.

The UN International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), recommended the installation of GPWS in 1979.

C. Donald Bateman, a Canadian-born engineer, developed and is credited with the invention of GPWS.

In March 2000, the U.S. FAA amended operating rules to require that all U.S. registered turbine-powered airplanes with six or more passenger seats (exclusive of pilot and copilot seating) be equipped with an FAA-approved TAWS. The mandate affects aircraft manufactured after March 29, 2002.

== Effects and statistics ==
Prior to the development of GPWS, large passenger aircraft were involved in 3.5 fatal CFIT accidents per year, falling to 2 per year in the mid-1970s. A 2006 report stated that from 1974, when the U.S. FAA made it a requirement for large aircraft to carry such equipment, until the time of the report, there had not been a single passenger fatality in a CFIT crash by a large jet in U.S. airspace.

After 1974, there were still some CFIT accidents that GPWS was unable to help prevent, due to the &quot;blind spot&quot; of those early GPWS systems. More advanced systems were developed.

Older TAWS, or deactivation of the EGPWS, or ignoring its warnings when an airport is not in its database, still leave aircraft vulnerable to possible CFIT incidents. In April 2010, a Polish Air Force Tupolev Tu-154M aircraft crashed near Smolensk, Russia, in a possible CFIT accident killing all passengers and crew, including the President of Poland Lech Kaczyński. The aircraft was equipped with TAWS made by Universal Avionics Systems of Tucson. According to the Russian Interstate Aviation Committee, the TAWS was turned on. However, the airport where the aircraft was going to land (Smolensk (XUBS)) is not in the TAWS database. In January 2008 a Polish Air Force Casa C-295M crashed in a CFIT accident near Mirosławiec, Poland, despite being equipped with EGPWS; the EGPWS warning sounds had been disabled, and the pilot-in-command was not properly trained with EGPWS.

== Commercial aircraft ==

The system monitors an aircraft&#x27;s height above ground as determined by a radar altimeter. A computer then keeps track of these readings, calculates trends, and will warn the flight crew with visual and audio messages if the aircraft is in certain defined flying configurations (&quot;modes&quot;).

The modes are:
#Excessive descent rate (&quot;SINK RATE&quot; &quot;PULL UP&quot;)
#Excessive terrain closure rate (&quot;TERRAIN&quot; &quot;PULL UP&quot;)
#Excessive large obstacle closure rate (&quot;OBSTACLE&quot; &quot;PULL UP&quot;)
#Altitude loss after takeoff or with a high power setting (&quot;DON&#x27;T SINK&quot;)
#Unsafe terrain clearance (&quot;TOO LOW – TERRAIN&quot; &quot;TOO LOW – GEAR&quot; &quot;TOO LOW – FLAPS&quot;)
#Excessive deviation below glideslope (&quot;GLIDESLOPE&quot;)
#Excessively steep bank angle (&quot;BANK ANGLE&quot;)
#Windshear protection (&quot;WINDSHEAR&quot;)

The traditional GPWS does have a blind spot. Since it can only gather data from directly below the aircraft, it must predict future terrain features. If there is a dramatic change in terrain, such as a steep slope, GPWS will not detect the aircraft closure rate until it is too late for evasive action.

In the late 1990s, improvements were developed and the system is now named &quot;Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System&quot; (EGPWS/TAWS). The system is combined with a worldwide digital terrain database and relies on Global Positioning System (GPS) technology. On-board computers compare current location with a database of the Earth&#x27;s terrain. The Terrain Display gives pilots a visual orientation to high and low points near the aircraft.

EGPWS software improvements are focused on solving two common problems: no warning at all, and late or improper response.

===No warning===
The primary cause of CFIT occurrences with no GPWS warning is landing short. When the landing gear is down and landing flaps are deployed, the GPWS expects the airplane to land and therefore, issues no warning. However, the GPWS can also malfunction because of a short circuit. On September 26, 1997, Garuda Indonesia Flight 152 crashed into a hilly area, killing all 222 passengers and 12 crew on board. Despite the fact that the plane was nearing terrain, the GPWS did not activate, even though the landing gear and landing flaps were not deployed. EGPWS introduces the Terrain Clearance Floor (TCF) function, which provides GPWS protection even in the landing configuration.

===Late warning or improper response===
The occurrence of a GPWS alert typically happens at a time of high workload and nearly always surprises the flight crew. Almost certainly, the aircraft is not where the pilot thinks it should be, and the response to a GPWS warning can be late in these circumstances. Warning time can also be short if the aircraft is flying into steep terrain since the downward-looking radio altimeter is the primary sensor used for the warning calculation. The EGPWS improves terrain awareness and warning times by introducing the Terrain Display and the Terrain Data Base Look Ahead protection.

== Incidents ==
In commercial and airline operations, there are legally mandated procedures that must be followed should an EGPWS caution or warning occur. Both pilots must respond and act accordingly once the alert has been issued. In Indonesia, the captain of Garuda Indonesia Flight 200 was charged with manslaughter for not adhering to these procedures.

In 2015, Air France Flight 953 (a Boeing 777-200ER aircraft) avoided controlled flight into terrain after the EGPWS detected Mount Cameroon in the aircraft&#x27;s flight path. The pilot flying immediately responded to the initial warning from the EGPWS.

== General aviation ==
TAWS equipment is not required by the U.S. FAA in piston-engined aircraft, but optional equipment categorised as TAWS Type C may be installed. Depending on the type of operation, TAWS is only required to be installed into turbine-powered aircraft with six or more passenger seats.

A smaller and less expensive version of EGPWS was developed by AlliedSignal (now merged with Honeywell) for general aviation and private aircraft.

== Fast military aircraft ==
For fast military aircraft, the high speed and low altitude that may frequently be flown make traditional GPWS systems unsuitable, as the blind spot becomes the critical part. Thus, an enhanced system is required, taking inputs not only from the radar altimeter, but also from inertial navigation system (INS), Global Positioning System (GPS), and flight control system (FCS), using these to accurately predict the flight path of the aircraft up to ahead. Digital maps of terrain and obstacle features are then used to determine whether a collision is likely if the aircraft does not pull up at a given pre-set g-level. If a collision is predicted, a cockpit warning may be provided. This is the type of system deployed on aircraft such as the Eurofighter Typhoon. The U.S. FAA has also conducted a study about adapting 3-D military thrust vectoring to recover civil jetliners from catastrophes.

On May 5, 2016, a military GPWS called Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System (Auto-GCAS) equipped aboard an F-16 was activated after a trainee pilot lost consciousness from excessive G forces during basic fighter manoeuvre training. In an approximately 55 degree nose down attitude at and a speed of , the Auto-GCAS detected that the aircraft was going to strike the terrain and executed an automatic recovery, saving the pilot&#x27;s life.

<text>Æthelbert II (; c. 725–762) was king of Kent. Upon the death of his father Wihtred, the kingdom was ruled by Æthelbert II and his brothers Eadberht I and Alric. Æthelbert seems to have outlived both of his brothers and later reigned jointly with his nephew Eardwulf. He died in 762, according to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; (recorded under 760 due to chronological dislocation). He seems to have left a son, Eadberht II.

He issued a charter before his accession, dated 11 July 724, that was witnessed by his father. As king he issued further charters, confirmed a charter of his brother Eadberht I, and witnessed a charter of his nephew Eardwulf.

During the latter half of Æthelberht II&#x27;s rule, Kent was under the overlordship of Mercia, but Æthelberht II maintained his position as king.

<text>The State University of New York at Plattsburgh (SUNY Plattsburgh) is a public university in Plattsburgh, New York. The university was founded in 1889 and officially opened in 1890. The university is part of the State University of New York (SUNY) system and is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. SUNY Plattsburgh has 5,109 students, of whom 4,680 are undergraduates.

== History ==

=== Founding of the Normal School ===
Former state politician and influential Plattsburgh businessman, Smith M. Weed, endlessly championed the prospect of building a state normal school (a teachers&#x27; college) in the city of Plattsburgh. After multiple proposals to the New York state senate going back as far as 1869, the final bill was formally proposed on January 12, 1888 by George S. Weed, Smith Weed&#x27;s son and then state assemblyman. With the strong backing of Assemblyman General Stephen Misfitted, the Plattsburgh Normal and Training School bill was passed by both houses of the New York State Legislature, and signed into law by Governor David B. Hill in June of 1845. The board of directors adopted official by-laws for Plattsburgh State Normal and Training School on September 2, 1889.

At a meeting held on June 28, 1889, it was decided the new normal school would be on land known as &quot;the former athletic grounds&quot;, bounded on the north by Court Street, on the east by Wells Street, on the south by Freethinker Street, and on the west by Beckman Street. However, these plans were dropped in favor of a larger plot, created by combining land on each side of Court Street west of Beckman Street, so that &quot;Court Street, one of the finest residential streets in the village, leads directly to the main entrance&quot;. This is the same location where Hawkins Hall now stands on the current campus of SUNY Plattsburgh.

The impressive structure, known as &quot;Normal Hall&quot;, was constructed by the Brown Brothers of Mohawk, New York, who were also responsible for the construction of the Clinton County Courthouse Complex in downtown Plattsburgh.

Plattsburgh State Normal and Training School officially opened with its first day of classes on the morning of September 3, 1890. The school&#x27;s first principal was Fox Holden, former Superintendent of the Plattsburgh Union Graded Schools. Holden only served for two years, from 1890 until the first graduating class in 1892, when he resigned.

=== Fire of 1929 ===
On January 26, 1929, a fire that began in the boiler room destroyed the Plattsburgh Normal School. Aided by high winds and the building&#x27;s well-oiled floors, the structure was engulfed in flames within a half-hour and demolished within an hour. Six children who were being given music lessons were safely lowered out the second story window by their teacher Lyndon Street.

With an extensive shuffling of city services, classes resumed the following Wednesday at City Hall in downtown. The longer-term solution was to share facilities with a number of the city&#x27;s K-12 public schools. This half-day schooling arrangement was necessary for the survival of Plattsburgh Normal School but proved to be too disruptive to public school students, and the practice was discontinued in September 1930.

Plans were soon approved for a new structure to replace Normal Hall. Plans were formally approved on October 10. The new building would be in the same location and be twice as large as the old Normal Hall. The new structure was completed in 1932, and in 1955 it was named Hawkins Hall in honor of George K. Hawkins, the principal of Plattsburgh Normal School from 1898 to 1933. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

=== Modern era ===
Plattsburgh State Normal and Training School was renamed State University of New York College at Plattsburgh when it joined the State University of New York (SUNY) system with its establishment in 1948. When the school became part of the SUNY system, it changed from a two-year teacher&#x27;s institution to a four-year, public college.

During the 1960s and 1970s, SUNY Plattsburgh, as well as the whole State University of New York system, underwent rapid growth. Many of the more modern buildings on campus were constructed during this time period, including the Angell College Center, Feinberg Library, and one low-rise and several high-rise dormitories.

In 1976, Playboy Magazine named Plattsburgh as one of the top schools to be at during St. Patrick&#x27;s Day. By 1980, after requests from the Plattsburgh Mayor and Police Chief, President Burke adjusted spring break to always include St. Patrick&#x27;s day, forcing students to disband from the campus during the holiday.

Since 1978, the student population has remained relatively small, ranging between 5,500 and 6,600 matriculated students. Enrollment was the highest in the Fall 1988 semester, with 6,594 students. In fall 2017, enrollment was 5,719 students, the first year of increased enrollments after several years of declining enrollment at the college. The following year, enrollment declined by 15 students, to 5,704. In Fall 2018, the average class size was 22 and the student-faculty ratio was 16:1.

In the 21st century, the campus has seen the completion of two new buildings: the Hudson Hall Annex and Au Sable Hall. The majority of dormitory buildings received renovations during the period as well. The 2010s also saw the renovation of Hawkins Pond, the Podium walkways, and various athletic fields.

In a letter to the campus community on February 13, 2023, President Alexander Enyedi announced that the College would become a university, based on enrollment and graduate programs offered. SUNY Plattsburgh joined other SUNY campuses that were previously colleges to become a public university.

===Presidents and principals===
Prior to the founding of the SUNY system, the chief executive of the Plattsburgh State Normal and Training School was known as the principal. When the SUNY system was founded in 1948 and the Normal School joined and became SUNY Plattsburgh, Charles Ward, who was principal at the time, became the president of the college. Alexander Enyedi is the current president.

== Campus ==

=== Location ===
The primary campus of the State University of New York at Plattsburgh is in the city of Plattsburgh, in the North Country region of upstate New York. The campus is near Lake Champlain and the Adirondack Mountains, in a region known as the Champlain Valley. The closest major city outside of Plattsburgh is Burlington, Vermont, which is less than &quot;as the crow flies,&quot; but takes about an hour to travel to by ferry. The closest major city within New York is Albany (headquarters of the SUNY system), to the south. SUNY Plattsburgh also has a strong connection with Canada due to the Canada–US border being just north and the city of Montreal just over away.

=== Facilities ===
The SUNY Plattsburgh main campus consists of 36 buildings on , in an area just west of the intersection of Broad Street and Rugar Street. The center of campus is Amité Plaza, a large outdoor courtyard surrounded by many of the most essential buildings on campus, including the Angell College Center, the Myers Fine Arts Building, and Feinberg Library. The iconic focal point of Amité Plaza is a massive metal sculpture of two people shaking hands. This sculpture, for which the courtyard was named, was created by renowned sculptor William King. It represents between the United States and Canada.

The most distinctive academic building on campus is Hawkins Hall, located on Beekman Street between Broad Street and Cornelia Street. Hawkins Hall replaced the original Plattsburgh Normal School which burned to the ground at that same location in 1929. The oldest building on campus is Champlain Valley Hall, while Macdonough Hall is the oldest dormitory. Other dorms line Rugar Street, including five 9-story, and one 10-story high-rises. 
Several key athletic facilities are located west of the main campus at the Field House Complex. Among them is the Ronald B. Stafford Ice Arena, the 3,500 seat home to Cardinal Hockey. SUNY Plattsburgh also has remote sites, ranging from Valcour Educational Conference Center in nearby Peru, New York, to a Branch Campus in Queensbury, New York (near Glens Falls). SUNY Plattsburgh owns a campground outdoor education center, Twin Valleys, in Lewis, New York, approximately a 45-minute drive away. Consisting of several cabins with beds, a lake, a low-ropes course, and a dining building, Twin Valleys is used for a variety of events, including RA training, dorm floor trips, and the annual Odyssey experience.

=== Art exhibitions ===
Artwork is an essential aspect of the SUNY Plattsburgh campus. The Plattsburgh State Art Museum is considered a &quot;Museum Without Walls&quot;, comprising over 4,600 historic and contemporary works of art. Two prominent permanent exhibitions are the Rockwell Kent Gallery and Collection and the Nina Winkel Sculpture Court. The Rockwell Kent Gallery and Collection is in the Feinberg Library. It is the largest collection of Rockwell Kent&#x27;s work in the United States. The Nina Winkel Sculpture Court is in the Myers Fine Arts Building. It is the largest display in the country devoted to the art of one woman. Temporary Exhibitions are held at the Burke Gallery, Plattsburgh State Art Museum, including &quot;Views of Lake Champlain&quot; by Canadian artist Samir Sammoun, in cooperation of the State of New York and New York State First Lady Michelle Paige Paterson May–July 2009.

== Organization ==
Alexander Enyedi became president of SUNY Plattsburgh on January 21, 2020. Enyedi is a member of the SUNY Plattsburgh University Council, which serves as an oversight and advisory body to the senior administration within the State University of New York system. In accordance with New York State Education Law, nine of the ten Council members are appointed to seven-year terms by the Governor of New York, with the one student elected to the remaining post for a one-year term.

Team sports with both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams include ice hockey, basketball, soccer, lacrosse, track and field, and cross country. Plattsburgh also has a men&#x27;s baseball team, and women&#x27;s teams in softball, tennis, and volleyball. All Plattsburgh State&#x27;s intercollegiate athletic teams are known as the Cardinals. The mascot is a cardinal named Burghy.

=== Ice hockey ===

Cardinal Hockey is the most notable of Plattsburgh State sports, featuring perennial national powerhouses in both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ice hockey.

The men&#x27;s hockey team has won three NCAA D-III Championships (1987, 1992, and 2001) and 18 SUNYAC Championships. The women&#x27;s hockey team has won seven NCAA D-III Championships (2007, 2008, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2019) and five ECAC Western Division Championships (2006, 2007, 2013, 2014, and 2015). The 2013–2014 Lady Cardinals&#x27; team blew out the Norwich Cadets in the 2014 NCAA Championship in Ronald B. Stafford Ice Arena, 9–2 in front of a crowd of over 1600. They finished their season with an outstanding record, 28–1–1. The Lady Cards also claimed the title of 2013–2014 ECAC West Champions. The previous year (2012–2013) the Lady Cardinals were defeated in the NCAA semifinals, moving on to grasp a third-place title. They ended with a 29–1–0 record, also winning 2012–2013 ECAC West Championships. The 2006–2007 Lady Cardinals&#x27; team that won the National Championship went undefeated (27–0–2); a feat accomplished for just the fourth time in NCAA hockey history (men&#x27;s or women&#x27;s at any level). The Lady Cardinals won NCAA D-III championships in the 2013–2014, 2014–2015, 2015–2016, 2016–2017, and 2018–2019 seasons.

Cardinal hockey players have been named first team All-Americans a total of 19 times. For the men&#x27;s team, Tracey Belanger (1999), Jason Desloover (1998), Steve Moffat (1998), Lenny Pereira (1993, 1994), Joe Ferras (1987), Peter DeArmas (1985), Gaetan D&#x27;Anjou (1982), and Doug Kimura (1980, 1981) have been first team All-Americans. For the women&#x27;s team, Shannon Stewart (2013), Alison Era (2013), Sydney Aveson (2013), Teal Gove (2012), Kara Buehler (2011), Stephanie Moberg (2009), Danielle Blanchard (2007, 2008), Bree Doyle (2006, 2007), Jenn Clarke (2006), Erin O&#x27;Brien (2005), and Elizabeth Gibson (2004) have been first team All-Americans. Blanchard won the Laura Hurd Award as the NCAA Division III Player of the Year in 2008.

==== Plattsburgh-Oswego hockey rivalry ====
In 1990, the Cardinal Hockey Boosters Club began a tradition of fans throwing hundreds of tennis balls onto the ice after the first SUNY Plattsburgh goal was scored against the visiting SUNY Oswego Lakers. There are a number of reasons tennis balls may have been chosen. It is believed that tennis balls were chosen because the Head Coach for Oswego&#x27;s hockey team was also the school&#x27;s tennis coach; because tennis balls matched the bright yellow color of the Lakers&#x27; jerseys; or because the tennis coach from Oswego State had left to work for Plattsburgh. In 1998, Oswego goaltender Carl Antifonario shutout the Cardinals in Plattsburgh, denying fans the opportunity to throw any tennis balls. This accomplishment led to an Oswego counter-tradition of throwing hundreds of bagels (representing a zero; also said to represent &quot;bird food&quot; for Plattsburgh&#x27;s mascot: a Cardinal) on their home ice following the first goal scored against the Cardinals in Oswego. The SUNY Plattsburgh tradition of throwing tennis balls at home games against Oswego lasted for 18 years but, following Oswego&#x27;s lead two years earlier, it was finally ended by school administrators on January 25, 2008.

=== Basketball ===
After an undetermined period without a team, Plattsburgh State officially rejoined intercollegiate men&#x27;s basketball in 1921. Since that time, Cardinals basketball has gone to seven NCAA tournaments (1975, 1995, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010 and 2013), including a Final Four appearance in 1976.

=== Lacrosse ===

The men&#x27;s lacrosse team has only won the SUNYAC championship in 2017. As of 2019, SUNY Plattsburgh became home to its first women&#x27;s lacrosse team. 

=== Cross country/track and field ===
The men&#x27;s cross-country team has qualified for the NCAA Championships on ten separate occasions, most recently in 2008. Their top finish was in 1975, after placing ninth. The women have qualified for six NCAA Championships. The 2007 women&#x27;s were the National Runner-up to Amherst College.

The men&#x27;s track and field team has boasted nineteen NCAA All-American athletes, including two Nationals Champions; Andy Hastings (1986) and Chris Verkey (1998). In 2011, Mike Heymann set a school record by winning All-American honors for a seventh time. The women&#x27;s track and field team has seen ten NCAA All-Americans, including National Champion Kathy Kane (1989).

=== Wrestling ===

The Cardinals sponsored a men&#x27;s wrestling team for eleven seasons, from 1963–64 to 1973–74. They had two winning seasons, 1967 (7-6) coached by Bob Kopinsky, and 1968 (8-6) coached by Don Learman.

== Student life ==

=== Student Association ===
The Student Association, also known as the S.A., is the student-run government body at the college. Their mission is to voice the concerns and interests of the students, as well as provide services, programs, and activities for the college community.

The SUNY Plattsburgh Student Association was founded in 1963 and replaced the former House of Delegates. Then-president of the college, George W. Angell, encouraged student Martin D. Mannix to pitch the idea for a new student run government to the administration and student body. The campus overwhelmingly approved of the changes and Mannix was voted in as the first Student Association President.

=== Honors Student Association ===
The Honors Student Association (HSA) is an independent organization from the college&#x27;s Student Association. Started in 1984, the HSA acts as the student government for the Redcay Honors Center at Plattsburgh. The HSA organizes and coordinates a wide variety of social activities to benefit the honors students, the campus, and the Plattsburgh community. All students in the Honors College are automatically members of the HSA.

=== Campus media ===
&quot;Cardinal Points&quot; is the student-run weekly newspaper. In 2007, the Associated Collegiate Press named &quot;Cardinal Points&quot; as a finalist for the National Scholastic Press Association Pacemaker Award, the highest award given to college media. An October 2015 cover of &quot;Cardinal Points&quot; gained national attention after being accused of depicting a blackface cartoon.

The &quot;Cardinal Yearbook&quot; is published by the Journalism department. Plattsburgh State also has a full color local magazine published annually, once called &quot;All Points North&quot;, renamed &quot;Do North&quot; in 2013. Plattsburgh State Television (PSTV) is the student run television station, and 93.9 WQKE was the student run radio station until its license was cancelled on June 2, 2022. The communications department also runs WARP, a radio station streaming over the cable bulletin board in the Plattsburgh area.

=== Residence Hall Councils ===
Organized by the Office of Campus Housing and Community Living, each residence hall has a residence hall council, each headed by a respective elected president, vice president, secretary, and representatives for each floor. Using a budget provided from the Hall Council Fees portion of tuition, hall council members acting as a small municipal body organize events, parties, barbecues, tournaments, and sometimes competitions or collaborations with other residence halls on campus. The hall council is often responsible for creating and maintaining dorm newsletters as well.

<text>Antonio Talbot (May 29, 1900 – September 25, 1980) was a Canadian politician from Quebec. He once served as interim leader of the Union Nationale.

==Background==

He was born on May 29, 1900, in Saint-Pierre-de-la-Rivière-du-Sud, Quebec, near Montmagny, and was an attorney.

==Member of the legislature==

Talbot won a by-election in 1938 and became the Union Nationale member for the district of Chicoutimi. He was re-elected to seven straight terms in 1939, 1944, 1948, 1952, 1956, 1960 and 1962.

==Cabinet Member==

He was also a Cabinet minister from 1944 to 1960 under former Premiers Maurice Duplessis, Paul Sauve and Antonio Barrette.

==Party Leader==

He replaced Yves Prévost as interim UN leader and leader of the Opposition after the latter had served in those capacities for a few months following the resignation of former Premier Antonio Barrette from the UN leadership.

In September 1961, Daniel Johnson Sr. was elected as the new leader of the Union Nationale, thereby replacing interim party leader Talbot as the leader of the Opposition.

==Retirement==

Talbot resigns his seat to the legislature in 1965. He died on September 25, 1980.

<doc id="531566" wikidata="Q219164" url="?curid=531566" title="Zombie (computing)">
<text>In computing, a zombie is a computer connected to the Internet that has been compromised by a hacker via a computer virus, computer worm, or trojan horse program and can be used to perform malicious tasks under the remote direction of the hacker. Zombie computers often coordinate together in a botnet controlled by the hacker, and are used for activities such as spreading e-mail spam and launching distributed denial-of-service attacks (DDoS attacks) against web servers. Most victims are unaware that their computers have become zombies. The concept is similar to the zombie of Haitian Voodoo folklore, which refers to a corpse resurrected by a sorcerer via magic and enslaved to the sorcerer&#x27;s commands, having no free will of its own. A coordinated DDoS attack by multiple botnet machines also resembles a &quot;zombie horde attack&quot;, as depicted in fictional zombie films.

==Advertising==

Zombie computers have been used extensively to send e-mail spam; as of 2005, an estimated 50–80% of all spam worldwide was sent by zombie computers. This allows spammers to avoid detection and presumably reduces their bandwidth costs, since the owners of zombies pay for their own bandwidth. This spam also greatly increases the spread of Trojan horses, as Trojans are not self-replicating. They rely on the movement of e-mails or spam to grow, whereas worms can spread by other means. For similar reasons, zombies are also used to commit click fraud against sites displaying pay-per-click advertising. Others can host phishing or money mule recruiting websites.

== Distributed denial-of-service attacks ==
Zombies can be used to conduct distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, a term which refers to the orchestrated flooding of target websites by large numbers of computers at once. The large number of Internet users making simultaneous requests of a website&#x27;s server is intended to result in crashing and the prevention of legitimate users from accessing the site. A variant of this type of flooding is known as distributed degradation-of-service. Committed by &quot;pulsing&quot; zombies, distributed degradation-of-service is the moderated and periodical flooding of websites intended to slow down rather than crash a victim site. The effectiveness of this tactic springs from the fact that intense flooding can be quickly detected and remedied, but pulsing zombie attacks and the resulting slow-down in website access can go unnoticed for months and even years. 

The computing facilitated by the Internet of Things (IoT) has been productive for modern-day usage, yet it has played a significant role in the increase in web attacks. The potential of IoT enables every device to communicate efficiently, but this also intensifies the need for policy enforcement regarding security threats. Among these threats, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks are prevalent. Research has been conducted to study the impact of such attacks on IoT networks and to develop compensating provisions for defense. Consultation services specialized in IoT security, such as those offered by IoT consulting firms, play a vital role in devising comprehensive strategies to safeguard IoT ecosystems from cyber threats.

Notable incidents of distributed denial- and degradation-of-service attacks in the past include the attack upon the SPEWS service in 2003, and the one against Blue Frog service in 2006. In 2000, several prominent Web sites (Yahoo, eBay, etc.) were clogged to a standstill by a distributed denial of service attack mounted by &#x27;MafiaBoy&#x27;, a Canadian teenager. 

== Smartphones ==

Beginning in July 2009, similar botnet capabilities have also emerged for the growing smartphone market. Examples include the July 2009 in the &quot;wild&quot; release of the Sexy Space text message worm, the world&#x27;s first botnet capable SMS worm, which targeted the Symbian operating system in Nokia smartphones. Later that month, researcher Charlie Miller revealed a proof of concept text message worm for the iPhone at Black Hat Briefings. Also in July, United Arab Emirates consumers were targeted by the Etisalat BlackBerry spyware program. In the 2010s, the security community is divided as to the real world potential of mobile botnets. But in an August 2009 interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, cyber security consultant Michael Gregg summarized the issue this way: &quot;We are about at the point with [smart]phones that we were with desktops in the &#x27;80s.&quot;

<text>Terrance Casey Brennan is an American comic book writer.

During the 1970s, he wrote for Warren Publishing&#x27;s black-and-white horror-comics anthologies &quot;Creepy&quot; and &quot;Eerie&quot;, and &quot;Vampirella&quot;. He also wrote for DC Comics&#x27; &quot;House of Mystery&quot; and Archie Comics&#x27; &quot;Red Circle Sorcery&quot;.

In the 1980s, Brennan campaigned to have depictions of smoking in comics banned, which led then-Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas to issue a proclamation designating January 1990 as &quot;T. Casey Brennan Month.&quot;

<doc id="531569" wikidata="Q11013002" url="?curid=531569" title="Honorific speech in Japanese">
<text>The Japanese language has a system of honorific speech, referred to as , parts of speech one function of which is to show that the speaker wants to convey respect for either the listener or someone mentioned in the utterance. Their use is widely seen in a variety of business or formal social situations. Honorifics in Japanese can also be used to show unfamiliarity (social distance), or they can be used to show that the speaker is cultured and sophisticated enough to have mastered the ins and outs of the system. Japanese honorific titles, often simply called honorifics, consist of suffixes and prefixes when referring to others in a conversation.

The system is very extensive, having its own special vocabulary and grammatical forms to express various levels of respectful, humble, and polite speech. It closely resembles other honorifics systems found in the East Asian cultural sphere, such as honorifics in Korean.

==Introduction==
Japanese uses honorific constructions to show or emphasize social rank, social intimacy or similarity in rank. The choice of pronoun used, for example, will express the social relationship between the person speaking and the person being referred to, and Japanese often avoids pronouns entirely in favor of more explicit titles or kinship terms.

Honorific speech is often longer, and sometimes much longer, than more direct speech. Some extreme, but not uncommon, examples include the following:

When asking a question: the first is casually between friends, the second is a junior person asking a superior in a formal meeting:
*いていい？
::&quot;Kiite ii?&quot;
:::Ok to ask (a question)?
*かせていただけるとしいのですが。
::&quot;Kikasete-itadakeru to ureshii no desu ga.&quot;
:::I would, however, be delighted if I may be permitted to ask (a question).

When asking for cooperation: the first is usual and polite, the latter is very formal, but often found in writing, especially in posters or flyers.
*ごさい。
::&quot;Go-kyōryoku-kudasai.&quot;
:::Your cooperation, please.
*ごのおいしげます。
::&quot;Go-kyōryoku no hodo o-negai mōshiagemasu.&quot;
:::We respectfully request the favor of a measure of your cooperation.
This latter example includes two honorific prefixes, nominalization of a verb (for formality), a respectful form, and two humble forms.

==Types of honorifics==

Honorifics in Japanese, or , fall under three main categories: , , and , also translated as modest language. Linguistically the first is an addressee honorific, used for someone being talked &quot;to&quot;, and the latter two are referent honorifics, used for someone being talked &quot;about&quot;. Sometimes two more categories are also used, for a total of five categories: and , but more often these are included in the above three: &quot;teichōgo&quot; as a kind of humble language, &quot;bikago&quot; as a kind of polite language. These two other categories use the same forms as the general categories, but are used in different contexts, and therefore are differentiated by some linguists. Each type of speech has its own vocabulary and verb endings.

For example, the standard form of the verb &quot;to do&quot; is . This form is appropriate with family members and close friends. The polite form of , the addressee honorific, is . This form is appropriate in most daily interactions. When showing respect, such as when talking about a customer or a superior, however, the respectful word and its polite form &quot;nasaimasu&quot; are used, and when referring to one&#x27;s own actions or the actions of a group member, the humble word &quot;itasu&quot; and its polite form &quot;itashimasu&quot; are used. These respectful and humble words are referent honorifics, and thus can coexist with addressee honorific &quot;-masu&quot;.

===Polite language===

 is characterized by the use of the sentence ending &quot;desu&quot; (です) and the verb ending &quot;masu&quot; (ます) and the use of prefixes such as &quot;o&quot; (お) and &quot;go&quot; (ご) towards neutral objects. Television presenters invariably use polite language, and it is the form of the language first taught to most non-native learners of Japanese.

Polite language can be used to refer to one&#x27;s own actions or those of other people.

===Respectful language===

 is a special form or alternative word used when talking about superiors and customers. It is not used to talk about oneself. For example, when a Japanese hairdresser or dentist requests their client to take a seat, they say &quot;O-kake ni natte kudasai&quot; (「おけになってください」) to mean &quot;Please sit down&quot;. However, they would use the verb rather than &quot;O-kake ni naru&quot; (「おけになる」) to refer to themselves sitting down. The respectful version of language can only be used to refer to others.

In general, respectful language is directed at those in positions of power; for example, a superior at work, or a customer. It also implies that the speaker is acting in a professional capacity.

It is characterized by lengthy polite expressions. Common verbs may be replaced by more polite alternative verbs, for example, する, &quot;suru&quot; (do) by なさる, &quot;nasaru&quot;, or 話す, &quot;hanasu&quot; (talk) by おっしゃる &quot;ossharu&quot; when the subject is a person of respect. Some of these transformations are many-to-one: く, &quot;iku&quot; (go), る, &quot;kuru&quot; (come), and いる, &quot;iru&quot; (be) all become いらっしゃる, &quot;irassharu&quot;, and べる, &quot;taberu&quot; (eat) and む, &quot;nomu&quot; (drink) both become しがる, &quot;meshiagaru&quot;.

Verbs may also be changed to respectful forms. One respectful form is a modification of the verb with a prefix and a polite suffix. For example, む, &quot;yomu&quot; (read) becomes &quot;o-yomi ni naru&quot;, with the prefix &quot;o-&quot; added to the i-form of the verb, and the verb ending &quot;ni naru&quot;. The verb ending &quot;-(r)areru&quot; can also be used, such as &quot;yomareru&quot;.

Nouns also undergo substitution to express respect. The normal Japanese word for person becomes in respectful language. Thus, a customer would normally be expected to be referred to as a &quot;kata&quot; rather than a &quot;hito&quot;.

===Humble language===

In general, humble language is used when describing one&#x27;s actions or the actions of a person in one&#x27;s in-group to others such as customers in business. Humble language tends to imply that one&#x27;s actions are taking place in order to assist the other person.

 is similar to respectful language, in substituting verbs with other forms. For example: &quot;suru&quot; (do) becomes &quot;itasu&quot;, and &quot;morau&quot; (receive) becomes &quot;itadaku&quot;. These two verbs are also seen in set phrases such as &quot;dō itashimashite&quot; (you&#x27;re welcome) and &quot;itadakimasu&quot; (いただきます—a phrase said before eating or drinking).

Similar to respectful language, verbs can also change their form by adding a prefix and the verb &quot;suru&quot; or &quot;itasu&quot;. For example, &quot;motsu&quot; (carry) becomes &quot;o mochi shimasu&quot;. The use of humble forms may imply doing something for the other person; thus a Japanese person might offer to carry something for someone else by saying &quot;o mochi shimasu&quot;. This type of humble form also appears in the set phrase &quot;o matase shimashita&quot;, &quot;I am sorry to have kept you waiting&quot;, from &quot;mataseru&quot; (make wait) with the addition of &quot;o&quot; and &quot;shimasu&quot;. Similarly, &quot;o negai shimasu&quot;, &quot;please [do this]&quot;, from &quot;negau&quot; (request or hope for), again with the addition of &quot;o&quot; and &quot;shimasu&quot;.

Even more politely, the form &quot;motasete itadaku&quot; literally means &quot;humbly be allowed to carry&quot;. This phrase would be used to express the idea that &quot;I will carry it if you please.&quot;

A distinction may also be made between humble speech where the intent is to raise up the recipient of an action, and where there is no specific recipient of the action, lowering the speaker instead with respect to the listener, as in the common phrase 電車が参ります (&quot;densha ga mairimasu&quot; &quot;a train is arriving&quot;) at rail stations. In the case, the train itself (as an extension of the railway company) is not lowered with respect to a specific recipient of the action of arrival; the humble language is merely a courtesy to the passengers hearing the announcement, whom the company is raising up by lowering itself. Some linguists distinguish this from kenjōgo (whose purpose is to raise up the recipient of a polite action by lowering the speaker), calling it instead teichōgo (丁重語) &quot;courteous language&quot;, and defining it formally as:
:Honorifics by which the Speaker shows consideration to the hearer through all expressions of the subject matter.
This category was first proposed by Hiroshi Miyachi (宮地裕). Teichōgo, as an addressee honorific, is always used with the teineigo (&quot;-masu&quot;) form, the politeness sequence (using &quot;go&quot; as an example) being 行く, 行きます, 参ります (&quot;iku&quot;, &quot;ikimasu&quot;, &quot;mairimasu&quot;).

In humble language, name suffixes are dropped when referring to people from inside one&#x27;s group. Thus, Japanese-speaking company executives would introduce themselves and their team by saying &quot;I am Gushiken, the president, and this is Niwa, the CEO&quot;, dropping the honorific that would otherwise be expected when referring to another person.

Similarly to respectful language, nouns can also change. The word , meaning &quot;person&quot;, becomes . The humble version is used when referring to oneself or members of one&#x27;s group, such as one&#x27;s company; when humble language is split into the dual classification above, this is a kind of teichōgo (丁重語) as a courtesy to the out-group listener.

===Respectful verbs===


:1 The distinction between these three verbs is lost in some respectful forms.
:2 Both are the humble form of ; it can also be used for related verbs like and .

===Word beautification===

Word beautification (, , &quot;beautified speech&quot;, in also sometimes , , &quot;elegant speech&quot;) is the practice of making words more polite or &quot;beautiful&quot;. This form of language is employed by the speaker to add refinement to one&#x27;s manner of speech. Patricia Wetzel has pointed out that many of the Japanese grammarians who write about &quot;beautification&quot; are not talking about a set of specific forms in Japanese, but rather the pragmatic function of much of keigo that helps the person using it sound cultured or sophisticated. One aspect of keigo is adding the prefix or to a word and used in conjunction with the polite form of verbs. In the following example, before and and the polite form of the verb are used to this effect. Generally is used before native Japanese words and is used before Sino-Japanese words, but there are exceptions.
: 
: Tea and rice crackers go well (together), don&#x27;t they? 

In finer classifications, the above example is classified as word beautification—rather than honorific speech—as the speaker is voicing a &quot;general opinion&quot; regarding tea and rice crackers and is not intentionally deferential towards the &quot;listener&quot;. In the following example, the speaker is directly referring to the listener and items received by them and is regarded as honorific language:
: 
: The sweets you gave me were most delectable. 

See the section on honorific prefixes, below, for further discussion.

==Usage==

===Business===

Honorifics are considered extremely important in a business setting. Training in honorifics usually does not take place at school or university, so company trainees are trained in correct use of honorifics to customers and superiors.

===In groups and out groups===
When using polite or respectful forms, the point of view of the speaker is shared by the speaker&#x27;s &quot;in-group&quot; (内 &quot;uchi&quot;), so in-group referents do not take honorifics. For example, members of one&#x27;s own company are referred to with humble forms when speaking with an external person; similarly, family members of the speaker are referred to humbly when speaking to guests. Similarly, the &quot;out-group&quot; (外 &quot;soto&quot;) addressee or referent is always mentioned in the polite style (though not necessarily with honorifics).

Mastery of politeness and honorifics is important for functioning in Japanese society. Not speaking politely enough can be insulting, and speaking too politely can be distancing (and therefore also insulting) or seem sarcastic. Children generally speak using plain informal speech, but they are expected to master politeness and honorifics by the end of their teenage years. Recent trends indicate that the importance of proper politeness is not as high as before, particularly in metropolitan areas. The standards are inconsistently applied towards foreigners, though most textbooks attempt to teach the polite style before considering to teach any of the other styles.

====Intrafamilial address====

Similar to how titles are used instead of personal pronouns when addressing a person of higher status, roles and kinship terms are used in intrafamilial settings where one can refer to other family members by using their role in relation to the speaker instead of a personal pronoun. For example, older relatives cannot be addressed as &quot;anata&quot;, &quot;kimi&quot; or simply by their name alone. Instead, a term denoting their relationship with the speaker or their name suffixed by an appropriate kinship term is used, such as &quot;otōsan&quot; when speaking to one&#x27;s father. Those younger than the speaker can generally be addressed by using personal pronouns or their name. Thus, the choice of whether a family member can be addressed by using a personal pronoun, their name or their role is dependent on the position of the speaker within the family.

===Gender differences===
Depending on the situation, women&#x27;s speech may contain more honorifics than men&#x27;s. In particular, in informal settings, women are more likely to use polite vocabulary and honorific prefixes, such as to mean &quot;eat rice&quot;, whereas men may use less polite vocabulary such as with exactly the same meaning. This is part of a general pattern of speech differences by sex. However, in many settings, such as in customer service, there will be little or no difference between male and female speech.

==Grammatical overview==

Japanese has grammatical functions to express several different pragmatic registers. Not only &quot;politeness&quot; but also &quot;respectfulness&quot;, &quot;humility&quot; and &quot;formality&quot; can be expressed.

===Expressing politeness===

There are three levels of politeness, &quot;plain&quot; or &quot;direct&quot; ( &quot;futsūtai&quot; or 常体 &quot;jōtai&quot;), &quot;polite&quot; or &quot;distal&quot; (敬体 &quot;keitai&quot; or 丁寧 &quot;teinei&quot;), and &quot;formal&quot; (generally, 敬語 &quot;keigo&quot; or 最敬体 &quot;saikeitai&quot;). Formal and polite can be combined. For example, for the sentence &quot;This is a book&quot;,

The informal style is used among friends, the distal or polite style by inferiors when addressing superiors and among strangers or casual acquaintances, and the formal style generally in writing or prepared speeches. The plain formal and informal styles of verbs are nearly identical, with a few grammatical differences, such as the verb &quot;de aru&quot; being used as a formal copula, and the preferential usage of verb stems to connect clauses instead of the &quot;te form&quot;. Formal language in Japanese also uses different vocabulary and structures from informal language.

In some contexts, where both the imperfective (incomplete: present/future) and perfective (complete: past) tenses are acceptable, the perfective is considered more polite. This is only at the completion of an activity; common examples are ありがとうございました &quot;arigatō gozaimashita&quot; &quot;thank you (for a completed favor)&quot;, ご馳走様でした &quot;go-chisō-sama deshita&quot; &quot;it was a feast (for a completed meal)&quot;, 失礼しました &quot;shitsurei shimashita&quot; &quot;I have been rude (when leaving, after a visit)&quot;. For example, when entering someone&#x27;s office, one conventionally says 失礼します &quot;shitsurei shimasu,&quot; as the visit is not complete yet, while when exiting one may say either &quot;shitsurei shimasu&quot; or, more politely, 失礼しました &quot;shitsurei shimashita.&quot; Many phrases cannot be used in the perfective in this way, as the referent is as yet incomplete. For example, the standard greeting お早うございます &quot;ohayō gozaimasu&quot; &quot;Good morning&quot; (lit. &quot;It is early&quot;) cannot be said as ×お早うございました *&quot;ohayō gozaimashita&quot; &quot;It was early&quot;, as it is used only during the morning.

===Expressing respect===

Further to this, there is another factor, respect, which is indicated in yet other ways.
For each politeness level there are two . 
#The form shows respect to the subject of the sentence.
#The form gives respect to the (&quot;direct&quot; or &quot;indirect&quot;) &quot;object&quot; or to the &quot;listener&quot; by a variety of means, the most common being to humble the speaker.
These respectful forms are represented by different verb endings. Since verbs come at the end of the sentence in Japanese, most of the factors of formality, politeness, and respect are expressed at the very end of each sentence.

The &quot;o-machi-suru&quot; humble forms carry an implication that the waiting or other activity is being (humbly) done by the speaker for the benefit of the person being addressed. Thus a &quot;humble&quot; sentence is unlikely to take a third person subject. For example, a sentence like &quot;jon ga sensei o o machi suru&quot; (John waits for the teacher) is unlikely to occur.

==Honorific titles==
Honorific suffixes and prefixes are used when referring to others in a conversation. They reflect not only the level of politeness chosen, but also the relative social rank or the degree of intimacy between people. For example, a person might refer to their classmate or colleague as &quot;Asada-san&quot; (&quot;Mr./Ms. Asada&quot;), but to their little son as &quot;Hideyo-chan&quot; (&quot;li&#x27;l Hideyo&quot;)&quot;.&quot; Referring to somebody without using a honorific is a sign of great informality or intimacy.

The most common honorifics include:
==Requests==

Japanese requests and commands have many set forms depending on who is being addressed by whom. For example, the phrase , can take various forms. At the bottom of the scale comes

:よろしくむ
:&quot;yoroshiku tanomu&quot;

which might be used between male friends. Its more polite variant

:よろしくみます
:&quot;yoroshiku tanomimasu&quot;

might be used towards less familiar people or to superiors.

Going up in politeness, the phrase

:よろしくおいします
:&quot;yoroshiku o-negai shimasu&quot;

means the same thing, but is used in business settings. It is possible to go further, replacing the polite with the humble , to get

:よろしくおいします
:&quot;yoroshiku o-negai itashimasu&quot;.

In extremely formal Japanese, such as that used on New Year&#x27;s greeting cards, this may be replaced with an even more polite expression

:よろしくおいしげます
:&quot;yoroshiku o-negai mōshiagemasu&quot;.

When making requests, at the bottom of the politeness scale comes the plain imperative or , literally &quot;Eat!&quot;, a simple order to be said to an inferior or someone considered to have no choice, such as a prisoner. This form might convey anger. Similarly, the suffix can make an order: , or , &quot;Eat!&quot;. To express anger, the suffix also exists: , an extremely forceful and angry instruction to eat, expressing contempt for the addressee.

Negatives are formed by adding suffix &quot;na&quot;: &quot;taberu na&quot; &quot;do not eat&quot;, &quot;gomi o suteru na&quot;: &quot;do not throw away rubbish&quot;. Similarly, the negative of &quot;da&quot;, &quot;ja nai&quot;, can be used: &quot;taberu n ja nai&quot;.

More polite, but still strict, is the &quot;nasai&quot; suffix, which attaches to the i-form of the verb. This originates in the polite verb &quot;nasaru&quot;. &quot;Tabenasai&quot; thus is an order perhaps given by a parent to a child. This is often colloquially shortened to &quot;na&quot;, hence &quot;tabena&quot;. This form has no grammatical negative.

Requests can also be formed by adding to the &quot;te&quot; form of a verb. The plainest form adds &quot;kure&quot;, an irregular form of the verb &quot;kureru&quot;, to the te form. For example, &quot;tabete kure&quot; or &quot;kutte kure&quot;: &quot;eat it&quot;, less forceful than &quot;tabero&quot;. Negatives are made by using the negative &quot;te&quot; form: &quot;tabenaide kure&quot; or &quot;kuwanaide kure&quot; &quot;don&#x27;t eat it&quot;.

Going up one scale in politeness, the more polite verb &quot;kudasai&quot; is added. For example, &quot;tabete kudasai&quot;. With this polite form, the rough &quot;kū&quot; verb is unlikely to be used. Similarly, &quot;tabenaide kudasai&quot;: &quot;please don&#x27;t eat it&quot;.

A similar entry on the scale of politeness is made by using the imperative form of a polite verb. For example, &quot;meshiagaru&quot;, the polite verb for &quot;to eat&quot;, when turned into &quot;meshiagare&quot;, the imperative, becomes the response to the set phrase &quot;itadakimasu&quot;.

Further, more polite forms are also possible. These involve the &quot;i-form&quot; of the verb rather than the &quot;te form&quot;, and an honorific prefix (see honorific prefixes: verbs, below). Beyond simply increased politeness, this form is more formal, and is used when addressing a group, or as a general instruction, rather than directed at a particular person. For example, &quot;tsukau&quot;, &quot;use&quot;, becomes &quot;o tsukai kudasai&quot;: &quot;please use this&quot;. In the case of phrasal verbs the honorific &quot;o&quot; appears before the entire phrase, not simply the verb, as in , from . Politeness can be carried even further by conjugating kudasaru into its masu form and using the imperative, which becomes &quot;o tsukai kudasaimase.&quot; The most polite form of this would probably be along the lines of &quot;o tsukai ni natte itadakimasen deshou ka.&quot; &quot;You will probably not bestow the favor of honorably using this?&quot; Language like this, however, is rarely used.

Other ways to increase politeness involve indirection of the request: &quot;kore o tsukau you ni o negai shimasu&quot;: &quot;I humbly request that you think about using this&quot;.

==Honorific prefixes==

The &quot;bikago&quot; (beautifying) prefixes &quot;o-&quot; (お〜) and &quot;go-&quot; (ご〜) (both written with the character 御- in kanji) are honorific prefixes which are applied to nouns and in some contexts to verbs. In general, &quot;go-&quot; (the on&#x27;yomi) precedes Sino-Japanese words (that is, words borrowed from Chinese or made from Sino-Japanese elements), while &quot;o-&quot; (the kun&#x27;yomi) precedes native Japanese words. There are many exceptions, however, where the &quot;o-&quot; prefix is used for Sino-Japanese words, including お茶 &quot;o-cha&quot; &quot;tea&quot;, お大事に &quot;o-daiji-ni&quot; &quot;get well&quot;, お電話 &quot;o-denwa&quot; &quot;telephone&quot;, お稽古 &quot;o-keiko&quot; &quot;practice&quot;, お宅 &quot;o-taku&quot; &quot;home/you&quot;, and many others. There is also one common exception for the &quot;go-&quot; prefix, ごゆっくり &quot;go-yukkuri&quot; &quot;slowly&quot;, where the main word is clearly not of Chinese origin.

These prefixes are used for two purposes: to speak respectfully about a stranger or social superior&#x27;s family, belongings, or actions (as part of 尊敬語, sonkeigo); or to speak in a generally refined or polite way (敬語 &quot;keigo&quot; generally, specifically 美化語, &quot;bikago&quot;).

=== Prefix usage ===

Although these honorific prefixes are often translated into English as &quot;honorable&quot; (&quot;o-denwa,&quot; for example, would be given as &quot;the honorable telephone&quot;) this translation is unwieldy and cannot convey the true feeling of their use in Japanese. These prefixes are essentially untranslatable, but their use indicates a polite respect for the item named or the person to or about whom one is speaking. A shorter translation is &quot;dear&quot;—for example, &quot;o-ko-san&quot;, お子さん, translates idiomatically as &quot;your dear child&quot;—and a similar sentiment is expressed in such English expressions as &quot;Would you &quot; care for a spot of&quot; tea?&quot; or &quot;Would you &quot;care for a little&quot; tea?&quot; (as opposed to the plain &quot;Would you &quot;like some&quot; tea?&quot;).

As with honorific word forms and titles, honorific prefixes are used when referring to or speaking with a social superior, or speaking about a superior&#x27;s actions or possessions, but not usually when referring to oneself or one&#x27;s own actions or possessions, or those of one&#x27;s in-group.

For example, when referring to one&#x27;s own order at a restaurant, one would use &quot;chūmon&quot;, but when referring to a customer&#x27;s order, the restaurant staff would use &quot;go-chūmon&quot;. Similarly, &quot;kazoku&quot; means &quot;my family,&quot; while &quot;go-kazoku&quot; means &quot;your family&quot; (or, broadly speaking, someone else&#x27;s family).

There are some words which frequently or always take these prefixes, regardless of who is speaking and to whom; these are often ordinary items which may have particular cultural significance, such as tea (&quot;o-cha&quot;) and rice (&quot;go-han&quot;). The word &quot;meshi&quot;, the Japanese equivalent of Sino-Japanese &quot;go-han&quot;, is considered rough and masculine (男性語). The honorific &quot;o-&quot; is also sometimes attached to of native verbs (hence native &quot;o-&quot;) to refer to a specific item associated with the verb, as in oshibori (お絞り、絞る) &quot;hot towel&quot;, and onigiri/omusubi (お握り、握る and お結び、結ぶ) &quot;rice ball&quot;.

In rare cases, both a base form and honorific are in use with different readings. A notable example is 利益 &quot;ri-eki&quot; &quot;benefit, profit (e.g., business)&quot; and 御利益 &quot;go-ri-yaku&quot; &quot;divine favor, grace&quot;; plain &quot;ri-yaku&quot; is sometimes used, but &quot;go-ri-eki&quot; is generally not. The former, an everyday term, uses the usual kan-on reading, while the later, a specialized religious term, uses the older go-on reading.

Honorific prefixes can be used for other items, possibly for a comic or sarcastic effect (for example, &quot;o-kokakōra&quot;, &quot;honorable Coca-Cola&quot;). Overuse of honorific prefixes may be taken as pretentious or simpering, and, as with other polite speech, they are more used by women than men.

In tea ceremony, common ingredients and equipment always take the honorific &quot;o-&quot; or &quot;go-&quot;, including water (&quot;o-mizu&quot;), hot water (&quot;o-yu&quot;), and tea bowls (&quot;o-chawan&quot;). However, these terms are often heard in daily life as well.

Foreign loanwords (gairaigo, except those that come from Chinese; see above) seldom take honorifics, but when they do &quot;o-&quot; seems to be preferable to &quot;go-&quot;. Examples are &quot;o-bīru&quot; (&quot;bīru&quot;: beer), which can sometimes be heard at restaurants, &quot;o-kādo&quot; (&quot;kādo&quot;: card, as in credit card or point card), which is often heard at supermarkets and department stores, and &quot;o-sōsu&quot; (&quot;sōsu&quot;: sauce).

=== Verbs ===

For verbs, a respectful request—or rather a polite command—addressed to a group may be formed by using 御〜, followed by the &quot;masu&quot;-stem (連用形), followed by . For Chinese verbs (kango + &quot;suru&quot;), the prefix is generally pronounced &quot;go-,&quot; while for native Japanese verbs the prefix is pronounced &quot;o-.&quot; This is generally written in kana. The most commonly heard use is (Chinese verb), which is used pervasively in recorded announcement in Japan (escalators, trains and subways, turning trucks), but other verbs are also used frequently, such as (Japanese verb).

The respectful prefix can also be used in honorific verbs, when speaking about a superior, in which case it is formed by &quot;o-,&quot; followed by the &quot;masu&quot;-stem, followed by (suitably conjugated), as in .

=== Female names ===
&quot;O-&quot; was also commonly used as an honorific prefix to female given names in pre-war Japan, particularly in combination with dropping common suffixes such as -ko (-こ) (-子, literally &quot;child&quot;). For example, would be referred to as , would become , would become , and so on. This was a less polite honorific than &quot;san&quot;. For example, a female servant named &quot;Kikuko&quot; would be referred to as &quot;O-kiku&quot; rather than &quot;Kikuko-san&quot;. This usage has disappeared in current Japanese, and has been replaced by using the diminutive suffix &quot;-chan&quot; instead (compare to male &quot;-kun&quot;), as in &quot;Aki-chan&quot; for &quot;Akiko&quot;.

=== Rare forms ===
There is also a rarer prefix &quot;mi-&quot; (kun&#x27;yomi), which is mostly used in words related to gods and the emperor, such as &quot;mi-koshi&quot; (御輿, &quot;portable shrine&quot; in Shinto) and &quot;mi-na&quot; (御名, &quot;the Holy Name&quot; in Christianity). However, in this context it is often replaced by 神 (&quot;god&quot;, also pronounced &quot;mi-&quot;), and then a further 御 (pronounced お-, &quot;o-&quot;) may be added, as in 御神輿 (&quot;o-mi-koshi&quot;). Sometimes the reading is ambiguous—for example, 御霊屋 &quot;mausoleum&quot; may be pronounced either &quot;mi-tama-ya&quot; or &quot;o-tama-ya&quot;. When pronounced as &quot;mi-,&quot; the prefix is usually written in kanji (unlike &quot;o-&quot; and &quot;go-&quot;, which are very frequently hiragana), but in some case it is written in hiragana, with a notable example being &quot;mi-hotoke&quot; (御仏, &quot;Lord Buddha&quot;) often being written as み仏, partly to avoid confusion with the incorrect reading *&quot;go-butsu&quot;.

The honorific prefix generally does not fall in the middle. In compounds, where the honorific would fall in the middle, the honorific is almost always dropped. For example, お茶／御茶 &quot;o-cha&quot; &quot;tea&quot;, but 麦茶 &quot;mugi-cha&quot; &quot;barley tea&quot;, not ×麦お茶／麦御茶 *&quot;mugi-o-cha&quot;. There are exceptions, however, such as 乾御門 &quot;inui-go-mon&quot; &quot;northwest gate (to imperial palace)&quot;; note that 乾門 &quot;inui-mon&quot; &quot;northwest gate (generally)&quot; is also used. Other notable exceptions include the words 朝ご飯 &quot;asa go-han&quot; &quot;breakfast&quot;, 昼ご飯 &quot;hiru go-han&quot;, &quot;lunch&quot;, and 晩ご飯 &quot;ban go-han&quot; &quot;dinner&quot;.

Rarely, 御 is used instead as an honorific &quot;suffix,&quot; notably in 甥御 &quot;oigo&quot; &quot;your nephew&quot; and 姪御 &quot;meigo&quot; &quot;your niece&quot;.

The character 御 has other readings, notably &quot;on&quot; (kun&#x27;yomi) and &quot;gyo&quot; (on&#x27;yomi), as seen in and , but these are not productive (they are not used to form new words, but only in existing words).

Another prefix, pronounced &quot;o-&quot; （お〜） and potentially confused with 御〜 when written in hiragana, is 阿〜 &quot;o-&quot;, which also has affectionate connotations, but is a separate term and not productive. It was previously used for endearment for women&#x27;s names, and today is most notable in 阿多福／阿亀 (&quot;o-ta-fuku,&quot; &quot;o-kame&quot;, &quot;moon-faced woman, homely woman&quot;), which are frequently written as お多福／お亀, which may be mistaken (partially) for hiragana forms of ×御多福／×御亀. The character 阿 is more frequently pronounced &quot;a,&quot; and used especially in words and names from Sanskrit, such as the &quot;a&quot; in the syllable &quot;aum&quot;, hence unfamiliar in this use, creating the potential for confusion.

In one case, a triple honorific prefix may used, namely in the word &quot;o-mi-o-tsuke,&quot; a polite term for miso soup, which is ordinarily referred to as . This may be spelt in kanji in multiple ways, including , but also as (味 = &quot;mi,&quot; flavor), and the 御御御〜 spelling may be considered ateji, punning on 御 and 味 both having the reading &quot;mi&quot;.

== English analogs ==
While English has different registers, its levels of formality and politeness are not as formalized or as clearly defined as in Japanese. However, they can be instructive in gaining a feel for Japanese speech. English imperatives range from very blunt (&quot;Give me the book&quot;), to very indirect and elaborate (&quot;If it&#x27;s not too much trouble, could you please be so kind as to pass me the book?&quot;—note the use of potential form, as in Japanese).

Similarly, changes in word use can make language more flowery or respectful—rather than &quot;Do you know?&quot;, one might say &quot;Are you familiar with?&quot; or &quot;Are you acquainted with?&quot;, which convey some of the feel of 知る &quot;shiru&quot; versus ご存知だ &quot;go-zonji da&quot;. In English, words of Germanic origin are generally plainer, those from French are generally more flowery (compare &quot;drink&quot; versus &quot;beverage&quot;), and those from Latin are more formal and technical (see Anglish and related articles); similarly in Japanese, words of Japanese origin are plainer, while words of Chinese origin are more formal. These are not hard-and-fast rules, but they give a feel for the gradations.

Humble language is less common in modern English, but is found in some contexts, such as guests saying &quot;I am &quot;honored&quot; to be here,&quot; (rather than &quot;I am &quot;glad&quot; to be here&quot; or &quot;I am &quot;happy&quot; to be here&quot;) and in various valedictions such as &quot;Sincerely&quot;, which were formerly more formal and humble, with such forms as &quot;I am, Sir, your most humble and obedient servant,&quot; and the like.

Some scholars argue that while honorific usage is necessarily affected by culturally specific values systems, the linguistic principles regulating its usage are not necessarily distinct from those of other languages, including honorific-poor languages such as English.

== Manual keigo ==

Some convenience stores and fast-food restaurants teach their young and part-time employees to verbally interact with customers in strictly prescribed ways laid down in instruction manuals. These forms of speech are known as マニュアル敬語 (&quot;manyuaru keigo&quot;, &quot;manual keigo&quot;) or バイト敬語 (&quot;baito keigo&quot;, &quot;part-timer keigo&quot;). Manual keigo includes forms which would be considered incorrect or at least non-standard in terms of traditional usage (keigo and otherwise). A common example is &quot;udon ni narimasu&quot; (literally &quot;[this] becomes udon&quot;, &quot;[this] will be udon&quot;) as a polite form of &quot;udon desu&quot; (&quot;[this] is udon&quot;), instead of the standard &quot;udon de gozaimasu&quot; (&quot;[this] is udon (polite)&quot;)—this manual keigo form is often criticized on the basis that the udon is not &quot;becoming&quot; anything, and therefore &quot;ni naru&quot; is incorrect, both as keigo and more generally.

== Theories ==

=== Universal Politeness Theory ===
One theory to explain the usage of honorific language in Japan as it exists nowadays is the Universal Politeness Theory proposed by Brown and Levinson that argues that every member of society has a &quot;face&quot;. This face is defined as the public image and to protect that face they use a politeness strategy in order to reduce the chance of &quot;losing face&quot;. More specifically, there are two type of faces, a positive and a negative one. The negative face is connected to an individual&#x27;s territory and resources. On the other hand, the positive face is constituted by the desire to be valued within society by its members. The use of honorifics is a negative politeness strategy to protect one&#x27;s face and is calculated with the factors of the social distance between the hearer and the speaker, measure of power that the hearer has over the speaker and the ranking of impositions within a specific culture.

==== Fukada&#x27;s and Asato&#x27;s Arguments for Universal Politeness Theory ====
Fukada and Asato stress the significance of power and distance as two variables that should be considered when evaluating Japanese politeness as Japan is a vertical society. On the basis of this, they utilise honorifics in order to not sound presumptuous or rude which could end up embarrassing themselves, losing face as a result, or threaten the hearer&#x27;s face. A person in higher position asking something of a person with lower status will use strong honorifics as well because of the high rank of imposition. This shows that not just social values determine honorifics. Another factor is also the distance between people in a conversation that can trigger polite language for example in official meetings and such. In conclusion they add that these arguments support the social norm that being reserved and not speaking too much in front of people with higher status is considered a good trait in Japan. It is not just about using honorifics but also the amount the speaker talks to a hearer with a higher position. Just the act of speaking to such a person is an intrinsic face threat to the speaker.

=== Honorifics as Relation-Acknowledging Devices ===
Matsumoto criticised the Universal Politeness Theory and emphasises the sensitivity of the usage of honorifics in Japanese. She defines honorifics as &quot;relation-acknowledging devices&quot; that take the hierarchical position of the participants in a conversation more into account. She argues against honorifics as a strategy to preserve the negative face as the Japanese polite language system places emphasis on showing human relationships rather than minimising imposition (as one of the key factors in the Universal Politeness Theory). Matsumoto compared indirectness in both English and Japanese, concluding that Japanese sentences do not carry the sense of politeness that exists in English with indirectness. However, Fukada and Asato comment that Matsumoto only shows examples which only show the lack of convertibility of English expressions of request into Japanese and do not universally prove that Japanese indirect utterances are not considered polite and do not count as a negative politeness strategy to save face.

=== Volitional Type and Discernment Type of Politeness ===
Ide argues that there are two types of linguistic politeness in Japanese. One is the &quot;volitional type&quot; which is controlled by the speaker&#x27;s intention how polite they want to be in a conversation. The other one is the &quot;discernment type&quot; that is controlled by one&#x27;s assessment of the appropriate level of politeness within certain social norms. The usage of discernment encode the speaker&#x27;s perception of communication in a situation. Factors like status difference of the speaker and hearer, speaker&#x27;s role in the conversation and so on. She criticises that verbal and linguistic forms are treated the same way in the Universal Politeness Theory and that linguistic forms are determined and employed by social norms and not the desire of a speaker to save face. Another reason why these two forms should be differentiated is that verbal strategies are only oriented for the hearer while linguistic forms are used for both the speaker and the hearer. In this theory Fukada and Asato add that while Ide says verbal strategies are used for face-saving purposes of the speaker, it can also save the face of speaker and hearer.

== Anti-honorifics ==
Around 1900, Japanese grammarians characterized honorifics as being part of a wider system 待遇表現 &quot;taigū hyougen&quot;, &quot;expressions indicating the way you treat people,&quot; which included not only polite or respectful language but also disparaging or pejorative terms and verb suffixes. In 1974, Neustupny pointed out that the rougher terms could also be used to convey familiarity or friendship. Toshiki Tsujimura dubbed the pejorative or familiar strata 非敬語 &quot;hikeigo&quot; &quot;anti-honorifics,&quot;. Some Japanese grammarians divide the whole sphere into &quot;plus&quot; (honorific/polite/humble) and &quot;minus&quot; (familiar or pejorative) groupings. The anti-honorific/minus level can involve using different more slangy words, for example, やる &quot;yaru&quot; meaning &quot;do&quot; or &quot;give&quot; in place of the plain level する &quot;suru&quot; for &quot;do,&quot; or あげる &quot;ageru&quot; for &quot;give.&quot; The casual verb &quot;yaru&quot; might be used when giving something to a small child or a dog for instance. 食う &quot;kuu&quot; is a casual word for 食べる &quot;taberu&quot; &quot;eat. Some of these words have a pejorative bite to them, eg. やらかす &quot;yarakasu&quot; for &quot;do,&quot; or こく &quot;koku&quot; for &quot;say.&quot; -やがる &quot;yagaru&quot; is a verb suffix that can turn any verb into a pejorative, eg. しやがる &quot;shiyagaru&quot; &quot;(this guy) up and does (something)&quot; or 来やがる &quot;kiyagaru&quot; &quot;(this dweeb) pops up out of nowhere.&quot; Pronouns also have casual and pejorative levels, eg. the word 君 &quot;kimi&quot; is the plain form for &quot;you.&quot; お前 &quot;omae&quot; is more casual, while 手前 &quot;temae&quot; or 貴様 &quot;kisama&quot; are pejorative. Instead of the plain 彼 &quot;kare&quot; &quot;he&quot; or この人 &quot;kono hito&quot; &quot;this person&quot;, one can say more roughly こいつ &quot;koitsu&quot; &quot;this guy (right here),&quot; そいつ &quot;soitsu&quot; &quot;that guy (over by you)&quot; or あいつ &quot;aitsu&quot; &quot;that guy (far away).&quot;

<doc id="531571" wikidata="Q845668" url="?curid=531571" title="Union of Brest">
<text>The Union of Brest took place in 1595–1596 and represented an agreement by Eastern Orthodox Churches in the Ruthenian portions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth to accept the Pope&#x27;s authority while maintaining Eastern Orthodox liturgical practices, leading to the formation of the Ruthenian Uniate Church, which currently exists as the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and the Belarusian Greek Catholic Church.

== The union ==

=== Background ===
Rome-oriented Christians and their Byzantium-oriented counterparts formally severed connections from 1054. Subsequent attempts to unify Eastern Orthodox believers and the Catholic Churches were made on several occasions, including an instance in 1452 in which the deposed Metropolitan of Kiev, Isidore (in office from 1437 to 1441), endorsed the 1439 Union of Florence and formally promised the unity of the Ruthenian Orthodox Church with Rome.

In 1588–1589, Patriarch of Constantinople Jeremias II traveled across Eastern Europe, particularly the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Tsardom of Russia, where he finally acknowledged the Russian Orthodox Church in Moscow (estranged from Constantinople since the 1440s) and consecrated Patriarch Job of Moscow as the Eastern Orthodox All-Russian Patriarch (a dignity previously held by Isidore from 1437 to 1441). Patriarch Jeremias II deposed the Metropolitan of Kiev, , and with the approval of the King of Poland Sigismund III, consecrated Michael Rohoza as the new Metropolitan of Kiev, Halych, and all Rus&#x27; (Jeremias was notably imprisoned by the Ottomans and by the Muscovites, and was forced to elevate the see of Moscow to a patriarchy.).

=== Negotiations ===
After Patriarch Jeremias II left Muscovy in 1589, four out of nine bishops of the Eastern Orthodox Church in the Ruthenian lands of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth gathered in synod in the city of Brest. They signed a declaration of their readiness to reunite with Rome. The 33 articles of Union were accepted by Pope Sixtus V. At first widely successful, the Union lost some of its initial support within the following several decades, mainly due to its enforcement on the Orthodox parishes, which provoked several massive uprisings.

;List of bishops who did not initially accept the union
* Metropolitan of Kiev and all Rus&#x27;
* Archeparch of Polotsk–Vitebsk
* Bishop of Smolensk
* Bishop of Volodymyr–Brest
* Bishop of Przemyśl-Sambir-Sanok (adopted the union in 1692)

;List of bishops who in 1590 signed the declaration of intent
* Bishop of Luck and Ostrog — Kyrylo Terletskyi (exarch of Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople)
* Bishop of Pinsk and Turow — Leontiy Pelchytskyi
* Bishop of Chelm — Dionisiy Zbyruiskyi
* Bishop of Lviv — Hedeon Balaban

;List of bishops who later joined the agreement
* Bishop of Przemysl — Mykhailo Kopystenskyi
* Archbishop of Polock — Herman Zahorskyj &quot;(acting)&quot;
* Bishop of Volodymyr-Brest — Hypatius Pociej
* Metropolitan of Kiev and all Rus&#x27; — Michael Rohoza

At the request of Prince Konstanty Wasyl Ostrogski, Hypatius Pociej left his post of Greater Castellan of Brześć Litewski and accepted the King&#x27;s appointment to the eparchy of Volodymyr-Brest. Prince Konstanty Wasyl Ostrogski considered that the Metropolitan of Kyiv should reach an agreement with the eastern patriarchs, the Patriarch of Moscow, and Metropolis of Moldavia and Bukovina for joint participation in agreement with the Latin Church.

In 1595, both Hedeon Balaban and Mykhailo Kopystenskyi withdrew their signatures from the agreement. That same year the Archbishop of Polotsk, Nathaniel Sielitskyi, died, and was replaced with Herman Zahorksyi.

=== Proclamation ===
The union was solemnly and publicly proclaimed in the Hall of Constantine in the Vatican. Canon Eustachy Wołłowicz, of Vilnius, read in Ruthenian and in Latin the letter of the Ruthenian episcopate to the Pope, dated 12 June 1595. Cardinal Silvio Antoniani thanked the Ruthenian episcopate in the name of the Pope, and expressed his joy at the happy event. Then Hipacy Pociej, Bishop of Volodymyr, in his own name and that of the Ruthenian episcopate, read in Latin the formula of abjuration of the 1054 Greek Schism, Bishop Cyril Terlecki of Lutsk read it in Ruthenian, and they affixed their signatures. Pope Clement VIII then addressed to them an allocution, expressing his joy and promising the Ruthenians his support. A medal was struck to commemorate the event, with the inscription: &#x27;. On the same day the bull &#x27; was published, announcing to the Roman Catholic world for the first time that Ruthenians were in the unity of the Roman Church. The bull recites the events which led to the union, the arrival of Pociej and Terlecki at Rome, their abjuration, and the concession to the Ruthenians that they should retain their own rite, save for such customs as were opposed to the purity of Catholic doctrine and incompatible with the communion of the Roman Church. On 7 February 1596, Pope Clement VIII addressed to the Ruthenian episcopate the brief &#x27;, enjoining the convocation of a synod in which the Ruthenian bishops were to recite the profession of the Catholic Faith. Various letters were also sent to the Polish king, princes, and magnates, exhorting them to receive the Ruthenians under their protection. Another bull, &#x27;, dated 23 February 1596, defined the rights of the Ruthenian episcopate and their relations in subjection to the Holy See.

=== Terms ===
It was agreed that the formulation &quot;filioque&quot; should not be inserted in Ruthenians&#x27; Nicene Creed, and that the Ruthenians &quot;should remain with that which was handed down to us in the Holy Scriptures, in the Gospel, and in the writings of the holy Greek Doctors, that is, that the Holy Spirit proceeds, not from two sources and not by a double procession, but from one origin, from the Father through the Son.&quot; The bishops asked to be dispensed from the obligation of introducing the Gregorian Calendar, so as to avoid popular discontent and dissensions, and insisted that the king of Poland should grant them, as of right, the dignity of senators.

=== Outcomes ===

The union was strongly supported by the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, Sigismund III Vasa, but opposed by some bishops and prominent nobles of Rus&#x27;, and (perhaps most importantly) by the nascent Cossack movement for Ukrainian self-rule. The result was &quot;Rus&#x27; fighting against Rus&#x27;&quot;, and the splitting of the Church of Rus&#x27; into Greek Catholic and Greek Orthodox jurisdictions. The greatest noble to oppose it was Konstanty Wasyl Ostrogski. In 1620, the Metropolis of Kiev, Galicia and all Ruthenia was erected under the care of the Patriarchate of Constantinople for dissenting Eastern Orthodox faithful. This resulted in parallel successions of metropolitans to the same ecclesiastical title in the territory of the Commonwealth.

<doc id="531575" wikidata="Q7514768" url="?curid=531575" title="Silent synapse">
<text>In neuroscience, a silent synapse is an excitatory glutamatergic synapse whose postsynaptic membrane contains NMDA-type glutamate receptors but no AMPA-type glutamate receptors. These synapses are named &quot;silent&quot; because normal AMPA receptor-mediated signaling is not present, rendering the synapse inactive under typical conditions. Silent synapses are typically considered to be immature glutamatergic synapses. As the brain matures, the relative number of silent synapses decreases. However, recent research on hippocampal silent synapses shows that while they may indeed be a developmental landmark in the formation of a synapse, that synapses can be &quot;silenced&quot; by activity, even once they have acquired AMPA receptors. Thus, silence may be a state that synapses can visit many times during their lifetimes.

== Synaptic transmission ==

Normal transmission across a glutamatergic synapse relies on the neurotransmitter glutamate, the glutamate-specific AMPA receptor (AMPAR), and calcium ions. Calcium ion entry into the presynaptic terminal causes the presynaptic release of glutamate, which diffuses across the synaptic cleft, binding to glutamate receptors on the postsynaptic membrane. There are four subtypes of glutamate receptors: AMPA receptors (AMPARs) (formerly known as quisqualate receptors), NMDA receptors (NMDARs), kainate receptors, and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). Most research has been focused on the AMPARs and the NMDARs. When glutamate binds to AMPARs located on the postsynaptic membrane, they permit a mixed flow of Na+ and K+ to cross the cells membrane, causing a depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane. This localized depolarization is called an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP).

Silent synapses release glutamate as do prototypical glutamatergic synapses, but their postsynaptic membranes contain only NMDA—and possibly mGlu—receptors able to bind glutamate. Though AMPA receptors are not expressed in the postsynaptic membranes of silent synapses, they are stored in vesicles inside the postsynaptic cells, where they cannot detect extracellular glutamate, but can be quickly inserted into the postsynaptic cell membrane in response to a tetanizing stimulus. The NMDAR is functionally similar to AMPAR except for two major differences: NMDARs carry ion currents composed of Na+, K+, but also (unlike most AMPAR) Ca2+; NMDARs also have a site inside their ion channel that binds magnesium ions (Mg2+). This magnesium binding site is located in the pore of the channel, at a place within the electrical field generated by the membrane potential. Normally, current will not flow through the NMDAR channel, even when it has bound glutamate. This is because the ion channel associated with this receptor is plugged by magnesium, acting like a cork in a bottle. However, since the Mg2+ is charged and is bound within the membrane&#x27;s electric field, depolarization of the membrane potential above threshold can dislodge the magnesium, allowing current flow through the NMDAR channel. This gives the NMDAR the property of being voltage-dependent, in that it requires strong postsynaptic depolarization to allow ion flux.

== Characteristics ==

Silent synapses were proposed as an explanation for differences in quantal content of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) mediated by AMPARs and NMDARs in hippocampal neurons. More direct evidence came from experiments where only a few axons were stimulated. 
The stimulation of a silent synapse does not elicit EPSCs when the postsynaptic cell is clamped at -60 mV. Stimulation of a silent synapse &quot;will&quot; elicit EPSCs when the postsynaptic cell is depolarized beyond -40 mV. This is because they lack surface AMPAR to pass current at hyperpolarized potentials, but do possess NMDARs that will pass current at more positive potentials (because of relief of magnesium block). Moreover, the EPSCs elicited with depolarized membrane potentials can be completely blocked by D-APV, a selective NMDAR blocker.

== Activation ==
Silent synapses are activated via the insertion of AMPARs into the postsynaptic membrane, a phenomenon commonly called &quot;AMPA receptor trafficking.&quot;

When glutamate binds to a strongly-depolarized postsynaptic cell (e.g., during Hebbian LTP), Ca2+ quickly enters and binds to calmodulin. Calmodulin activates calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), which — among other things — acts on AMPAR-containing vesicles near the postsynaptic membrane. CaMKII phosphorylates these AMPARs, which serves as a signal to insert them into the postsynaptic membrane. Once AMPARs are inserted, the synapse is no longer silent; activated synapses no longer require simultaneous pre- and postsynaptic activity in order to elicit EPSPs. After initial activation (Early Long Term Potentiation), if the post synaptic neuron continues to be stimulated, it will adjust to become permanently excitable (Late Long Term Potentiation). It does this by changing its level of AMPA Receptor production which are then inserted into the membrane at the synapse.

Evidence suggests that dendrite arborization and synapse maturation 1 (Dasm1), an Ig superfamily member, is involved in the maturation of synapses, essentially &quot;awakening&quot; the silent synapses.

==Competing Hypotheses==
The characterization of silent synapses is an ongoing field of research and there are many things about them that are not yet known. Some of what is currently accepted about the properties of silent synapses may still prove to be incorrect in whole or in part. Some controversies about silent synapses have however, been settled. For example, until recently, there were four competing hypotheses for the mechanisms of synapse silence:

*The &quot;whispering synapse&quot; hypothesis:
**A synapse that releases glutamate more slowly than normal, thus activating only high affinity NMDA receptors, but not low affinity AMPA receptors
*The &quot;low Pr&quot; synapse hypothesis:
**A synapse that is not technically silent, but appears to be so, because it has such a low presynaptic probability of release that it rarely is activated.
*The &quot;glutamate spillover&quot; hypothesis:
**A synapse that does not release its own presynaptic glutamate, but in which the postsynapse detects low concentrations of glutamate &quot;spilling over&quot; from neighboring synapses. Only the high affinity NMDARs, but not the low affinity AMPARs can detect this low level of glutamate
*The &quot;lack of AMPA receptor&quot; hypothesis
**A synapse that lacks postsynaptic AMPA receptors

All four of these hypotheses had their adherents, but the first three were largely ruled out as a mechanism for synapse silence by work published before 2008. However, recent experiments have clearly established that silent synapses can be observed at brainstem synapses bearing postsynaptic AMPA receptors. This study favors the glutamate spillover hypothesis by showing that at silent synapses the glutamate concentration is reduced. At least, this study indicates that the popular hypothesis of the postsynaptic silent synapses does not apply in all systems.

== Integration with other topics ==
The Role of Silent Synapses in Long Term Potentiation

* Many of the mechanisms involved in Long Term Potentiation are similar if not identical to those involved in silent synapse activation. Both processes require the recruitment of AMPA receptors to the synapse.

Neural Development

* During development there are certain critical periods where sensory input is essential for correct development. This is necessary for sensory, motor, and cognitive functions. Activating silent synapses helps build the neural networks needed for this development.

AMPA Receptor Trafficking

* Because silent synapses are activated by the insertion of AMPAR&#x27;s, the trafficking of those receptors is highly applicable. Evidence suggests that the main source of AMPA receptor recruitment in Long Term Potentiation comes from the endocytic/recycling pathway, but there is also evidence that lateral membrane diffusion from extrasynaptic areas could also contribute to AMPAR recruitment.

<text>Gabriel Loubier (born September 27, 1932) was a politician in Quebec, Canada. He served as leader of the &quot;Union Nationale&quot; party from 1971 to 1974, and as Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly of Quebec from 1971 to 1973.

Born in Black Lake, Quebec, Loubier studied law at Laval University, and was admitted to the bar in 1958. He was first elected to the Quebec legislature representing Bellechasse in 1962 and served as Minister of Tourism and Fishing in the cabinets of Daniel Johnson and Jean-Jacques Bertrand from 1966 to 1970 and also as Minister responsible for Youth and Sport from 1968 to 1970. Following the defeat of the Bertrand government in the 1970 provincial election, Loubier was a candidate in the June 1971 Union Nationale leadership convention defeating Marcel Masse on the third ballot to become party leader and leader of the Opposition. From October 25, 1971, to January 14, 1973, the &quot;Union Nationale&quot; temporarily changed its name to &quot;Unité Québec&quot;.

In the 1973 election, the &quot;Union Nationale&quot; was wiped off the electoral map, winning no seats, and Loubier ceased to be leader of the Opposition. He resigned as UN party leader in March 1974.

He served on the board of directors of Megantic Metal and several firms in the steel industry before inheriting control of the family firm, Loubier Metal, from his father in 1985.

<doc id="531587" wikidata="Q83183" url="?curid=531587" title="Depolarization">
<text>In biology, depolarization or hypopolarization is a change within a cell, during which the cell undergoes a shift in electric charge distribution, resulting in less negative charge inside the cell compared to the outside. Depolarization is essential to the function of many cells, communication between cells, and the overall physiology of an organism.

Most cells in higher organisms maintain an internal environment that is negatively charged relative to the cell&#x27;s exterior. This difference in charge is called the cell&#x27;s membrane potential. In the process of depolarization, the negative internal charge of the cell temporarily becomes more positive (less negative). This shift from a negative to a more positive membrane potential occurs during several processes, including an action potential. During an action potential, the depolarization is so large that the potential difference across the cell membrane briefly reverses polarity, with the inside of the cell becoming positively charged.

The change in charge typically occurs due to an influx of sodium ions into a cell, although it can be mediated by an influx of any kind of cation or efflux of any kind of anion. The opposite of a depolarization is called a hyperpolarization.

Usage of the term &quot;depolarization&quot; in biology differs from its use in physics, where it refers to situations in which any form of polarity (&quot;i.e.&quot; the presence of any electrical charge, whether positive or negative) changes to a value of zero.

Depolarization is sometimes referred to as &quot;hypopolarization&quot; (as opposed to hyperpolarization).

==Physiology==

The process of depolarization is entirely dependent upon the intrinsic electrical nature of most cells. When a cell is at rest, the cell maintains what is known as a resting potential. The resting potential generated by nearly all cells results in the interior of the cell having a negative charge compared to the exterior of the cell. To maintain this electrical imbalance, ions are transported across the cell&#x27;s plasma membrane. The transport of the ions across the plasma membrane is accomplished through several different types of transmembrane proteins embedded in the cell&#x27;s plasma membrane that function as pathways for ions both into and out of the cell, such as ion channels, sodium potassium pumps, and voltage-gated ion channels.

===Resting potential===
The resting potential must be established within a cell before the cell can be depolarized. There are many mechanisms by which a cell can establish a resting potential, however there is a typical pattern of generating this resting potential that many cells follow. The generation of a negative resting potential within the cell involves the utilization of ion channels, ion pumps, and voltage-gated ion channels by the cell. However, the process of generating the resting potential within the cell also creates an environment outside the cell that favors depolarization. The sodium potassium pump is largely responsible for the optimization of conditions on both the interior and the exterior of the cell for depolarization.

By pumping three positively charged sodium ions (Na+) out of the cell for every two positively charged potassium ions (K+) pumped into the cell, not only is the resting potential of the cell established, but an unfavorable concentration gradient is created by increasing the concentration of sodium outside the cell and increasing the concentration of potassium within the cell. While there is an excessive amount of potassium in the cell and sodium outside the cell, the generated resting potential maintains the closure of voltage-gated ion channels in the plasma membrane. This not only prevents the diffusion of ions pumped across the membrane but also involves the activity of potassium leak channels, allowing a controlled passive efflux of potassium ions, which contributes to the establishment of the negative resting potential. Additionally, despite the high concentration of positively-charged potassium ions, most cells contain internal components (of negative charge), which accumulate to establish a negative inner charge.

===Depolarization===
After a cell has established a resting potential, that cell has the capacity to undergo depolarization. Depolarization is the process by which the membrane potential becomes less negative, facilitating the generation of an action potential. For this rapid change to take place within the interior of the cell, several events must occur along the plasma membrane of the cell.

While the sodium–potassium pump continues to work, the voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels that had been closed while the cell was at resting potential are opened in response to an initial change in voltage. As a change in the neuronal charge leads to the opening of voltage-gated sodium channels, this results in an influx of sodium ions down their electrochemical gradient. Sodium ions enter the cell, and they contribute a positive charge to the cell interior, causing a change in the membrane potential from negative to positive. The initial sodium ion influx triggers the opening of additional sodium channels (positive-feedback loop), leading to further sodium ion transfer into the cell and sustaining the depolarization process until the positive equilibrium potential is reached.

Sodium channels possess an inherent inactivation mechanism that prompts rapid reclosure, even as the membrane remains depolarized. During this equilibrium, the sodium channels enter an inactivated state, temporarily halting the influx of sodium ions until the membrane potential becomes negatively charged again. Once the cell&#x27;s interior is sufficiently positively charged, depolarization concludes, and the channels close once more.

===Repolarization===

After a cell has been depolarized, it undergoes one final change in internal charge. Following depolarization, the voltage-gated sodium ion channels that had been open while the cell was undergoing depolarization close again. The increased positive charge within the cell now causes the potassium channels to open. Potassium ions (K+) begin to move down the electrochemical gradient (in favor of the concentration gradient and the newly established electrical gradient). As potassium moves out of the cell the potential within the cell decreases and approaches its resting potential once more. The sodium potassium pump works continuously throughout this process.
==Hyperpolarization==

The process of repolarization causes an overshoot in the potential of the cell. Potassium ions continue to move out of the axon so much that the resting potential is exceeded and the new cell potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. The resting potential is ultimately re-established by the closing of all voltage-gated ion channels and the activity of the sodium potassium ion pump.

==Neurons==

Depolarization is essential to the functions of many cells in the human body, which is exemplified by the transmission of stimuli both within a neuron and between two neurons. The reception of stimuli, neural integration of those stimuli, and the neuron&#x27;s response to stimuli all rely upon the ability of neurons to utilize depolarization to transmit stimuli either within a neuron or between neurons.

===Response to stimulus===
Stimuli to neurons can be physical, electrical, or chemical, and can either inhibit or excite the neuron being stimulated. An inhibitory stimulus is transmitted to the dendrite of a neuron, causing hyperpolarization of the neuron. The hyperpolarization following an inhibitory stimulus causes a further decrease in voltage within the neuron below the resting potential. By hyperpolarizing a neuron, an inhibitory stimulus results in a greater negative charge that must be overcome for depolarization to occur.

Excitation stimuli, on the other hand, increase the voltage in the neuron, which leads to a neuron that is easier to depolarize than the same neuron in the resting state. Regardless of it being excitatory or inhibitory, the stimulus travels down the dendrites of a neuron to the cell body for integration.

===Integration of stimuli===

Once the stimuli have reached the cell body, the nerve must integrate the various stimuli before the nerve can respond. The stimuli that have traveled down the dendrites converge at the axon hillock, where they are summed to determine the neuronal response. If the sum of the stimuli reaches a certain voltage, known as the threshold potential, depolarization continues from the axon hillock down the axon.

===Response===

The surge of depolarization traveling from the axon hillock to the axon terminal is known as an action potential. Action potentials reach the axon terminal, where the action potential triggers the release of neurotransmitters from the neuron. The neurotransmitters that are released from the axon continue on to stimulate other cells such as other neurons or muscle cells. After an action potential travels down the axon of a neuron, the resting membrane potential of the axon must be restored before another action potential can travel the axon. This is known as the recovery period of the neuron, during which the neuron cannot transmit another action potential.

===Rod cells of the eye===

The importance and versatility of depolarization within cells can be seen in the relationship between rod cells in the eye and their associated neurons. When rod cells are in the dark, they are depolarized. In the rod cells, this depolarization is maintained by ion channels that remain open due to the higher voltage of the rod cell in the depolarized state. The ion channels allow calcium and sodium to pass freely into the cell, maintaining the depolarized state. Rod cells in the depolarized state constantly release neurotransmitters which in turn stimulate the nerves associated with rod cells. This cycle is broken when rod cells are exposed to light; the absorption of light by the rod cell causes the channels that had facilitated the entry of sodium and calcium into the rod cell to close. When these channels close, the rod cells produce fewer neurotransmitters, which is perceived by the brain as an increase in light. Therefore, in the case of rod cells and their associated neurons, depolarization actually prevents a signal from reaching the brain as opposed to stimulating the transmission of the signal.

==Vascular endothelium==

Endothelium is a thin layer of simple squamous epithelial cells that line the interior of both blood and lymph vessels. The endothelium that lines blood vessels is known as vascular endothelium, which is subject to and must withstand the forces of blood flow and blood pressure from the cardiovascular system. To withstand these cardiovascular forces, endothelial cells must simultaneously have a structure capable of withstanding the forces of circulation while also maintaining a certain level of plasticity in the strength of their structure. This plasticity in the structural strength of the vascular endothelium is essential to overall function of the cardiovascular system. Endothelial cells within blood vessels can alter the strength of their structure to maintain the vascular tone of the blood vessel they line, prevent vascular rigidity, and even help to regulate blood pressure within the cardiovascular system. Endothelial cells accomplish these feats by using depolarization to alter their structural strength. When an endothelial cell undergoes depolarization, the result is a marked decrease in the rigidity and structural strength of the cell by altering the network of fibers that provide these cells with their structural support. Depolarization in vascular endothelium is essential not only to the structural integrity of endothelial cells, but also to the ability of the vascular endothelium to aid in the regulation of vascular tone, prevention of vascular rigidity, and the regulation of blood pressure.

==Heart==
Depolarization occurs in the four chambers of the heart: both atria first, and then both ventricles.
# The sinoatrial (SA) node on the wall of the right atrium initiates depolarization in the right and left atria, causing contraction, which corresponds to the P wave on an electrocardiogram.
# The SA node sends the depolarization wave to the atrioventricular (AV) node which—with about a 100 ms delay to let the atria finish contracting—then causes contraction in both ventricles, seen in the QRS wave. At the same time, the atria re-polarize and relax.
# The ventricles are re-polarized and relaxed at the T wave.
This process continues regularly, unless there is a problem in the heart.

==Depolarization blockers== 
There are drugs, called depolarization blocking agents, that cause prolonged depolarization by opening channels responsible for depolarization and not allowing them to close, preventing repolarization. Examples include the nicotinic agonists, suxamethonium and decamethonium.
