<text>The Midlands is the central part of England, between Northern England to its north, and Southern England to its south and east. The region also shares a border with Wales to the west, while it also shares a coastline at the North Sea. The Midlands correspond to the ceremonial counties of Derbyshire, Herefordshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire, Rutland, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire, West Midlands and Worcestershire.

Officially, the Midlands is a grouping of two statistical regions: the West Midlands and East Midlands. These had a combined population of 10.9 million at the 2021 census, and an area of . Note that the northern part of the modern county of Lincolnshire is officially part of the Yorkshire and the Humber region, and not part of the Midlands.

The modern borders of the Midlands also correspond broadly to the early-medieval kingdom of Mercia. The region became important in the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries, which led to one of its parts being named as the Black Country. Culturally, the Midlands is distinct but contains elements from both Northern and Southern England in the North-South divide. The Midlands&#x27; biggest city, Birmingham, is the second-largest in the United Kingdom. Other important cities include Coventry, Derby, Leicester, Lincoln, Nottingham, Stoke-on-Trent, Wolverhampton, and Worcester.

== Definition and extent ==
There is no single definition for the Midlands. If defined as being made up of the statistical regions of East Midlands and West Midlands, it includes the counties of Derbyshire, Herefordshire, Leicestershire, most of Lincolnshire (with the exception of North and North East Lincolnshire), Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire, Rutland, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire, Worcestershire and the West Midlands metropolitan boroughs.

Other definitions include a slightly larger area and the 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; describes Gloucestershire as &quot;West Midland&quot;, Bedfordshire as &quot;South Midland&quot;, and Huntingdonshire as &quot;East Midland&quot; counties respectively. Cheshire is also occasionally recognised as being in the Midlands, while a lot of what was historically part of southern Mercia (Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire, Huntingdonshire, and Cambridgeshire) is often labelled as &quot;Central England&quot;, typically used interchangeably with &quot;the Midlands&quot;.

Additionally, there are two informal regions known as the South Midlands and North Midlands, which are not NUTS statistical regions of the United Kingdom and their definition varies by using organisation. The former includes the southern parts of the East Midlands and northern parts of Southern England. The latter covers the northern parts of the West and East Midlands, along with some southern parts of Northern England.

== Culture and identity ==
Due to being neither Northern England or Southern England, the Midlands have had cultural elements from both sides in the North–South divide. In a binary choice, the Watford Gap in Northamptonshire is often considered the dividing point between the north and south of England, with most of the Midlands population sitting above this point. It has been suggested that due to being neither North or South, the Midlands have had an &quot;image problem&quot; and lack of &quot;identity&quot;.

Different areas of the Midlands have their own distinctive character, giving rise to many local history and industrial heritage groups. Nottingham played a notable part in the English Civil War, which is commemorated in a number of place names (Parliament Terrace, Parliament Street, Standard Hill). Areas such as Derbyshire&#x27;s Amber Valley and Erewash combine attractive countryside with industrial heritage and are home to historic canals and sites associated with the mining industry. The Black Country, broadly the boroughs of Dudley, Sandwell, Wolverhampton and Walsall, played an important part in the Industrial Revolution.

Various parts of the Midlands, particularly Warwickshire and Leicestershire, are on occasion referred to as the Heart of England, especially in tourist literature given that the geographic centre of England is generally considered to lie within this arc.

=== Symbolism ===
A saltire (diagonal cross) may have been used as a symbol of Mercia as early as the reign of Offa. By the 13th century, the saltire had become the attributed arms of the Kingdom of Mercia. The arms are blazoned &quot;Azure, a saltire Or&quot;, meaning a gold (or yellow) saltire on a blue field. The saltire is used as both a flag and a coat of arms. As a flag, it is flown from Tamworth Castle, the ancient seat of the Mercian kings.

The flag also appears on street signs welcoming people to Tamworth, the &quot;ancient capital of Mercia&quot;. It was also flown outside Birmingham Council House during 2009 while the Staffordshire Hoard was on display in the city before being taken to the British Museum in London. The cross has been incorporated into a number of coats of arms of Midlands towns, including Tamworth, Leek and Blaby. It was recognised as the Mercian flag by the Flag Institute in 2014.

=== Language and dialect ===

Dialect is one of the fields where the Midlands may have mixed influences. A study has shown that some Midlands areas have traditionally had a dialect closer to &quot;northern&quot; but now more influenced by &quot;southern&quot;. West Midlands English and East Midlands English are generalised groups of dialects spoken in the Midlands. The former notably includes the Brummie and Black Country dialects.

William Shakespeare, one of the most famous English poets in history, was from Warwickshire in the Midlands.

=== Food ===
The bakewell tart, Staffordshire oatcake and Melton Mowbray pork pie are among the foods that have originated in the Midlands. The city of Birmingham has also been influential in dishes, notably the local version of Asian balti curry. Worcestershire sauce, as well as Walkers crisps and Cadbury chocolate are some of the most famous names to have come out of the Midlands.

=== Music ===

Numerous famous bands and artists have originated in the Midlands. Birmingham&#x27;s Black Sabbath is considered to be pioneers of heavy metal music, while another band Godflesh have been named pioneers of industrial metal. The city has also been inflential in bhangra music. The city of Coventry gave rise to the ska scene in the 1970s and bands such as The Specials. Discharge of Stoke-on-Trent have been highly influential in the punk music scene. More recently, the duo Sleaford Mods have been known for making use of a strong local East Midland accent.

== Geography and cities ==
=== Geology ===
The area is predominantly low-lying and flat apart from isolated hills such as Turners Hill within the Black Country conurbation at 271 m (889 ft) and the Wrekin just south of Wellington near Telford at 407 m (1,335 ft). Upland areas lie in the west and north of the region with the Shropshire Hills to the west, close to the England–Wales border and the Peak District area of the southern Pennines in the north of the region. The Shropshire Hills reach a height of 540 m (1,771 ft) at Brown Clee Hill and includes the Long Mynd, Clee Hills and Stiperstones ridge. Wenlock Edge, running through the middle of the Shropshire Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), is a long, low ridge, which extends for over . The Peak District reaches heights of between 300 m (1,000 ft) and 600 m (2,000 ft); Kinder Scout is the highest point at 636 m (2,086 ft). Further south, the Welsh border reaches over 700 m (2,000 ft) high, at Twyn Llech (Black Mountain), which at 703 m (2,306 ft) is thus the highest point in Herefordshire.

The Precambrian Malverns are formed of some of the oldest rock in England (dating from the Cryogenian period, at around 680 million years old) and extend for through two West Midlands counties (Worcestershire and Herefordshire) as well as northern Gloucestershire in the southwest. The highest point of the hills is the Worcestershire Beacon at 425 m (1,394 ft) above sea level (OS Grid reference SO768452).

The Cotswolds – designated an AONB in 1966. – extend for over through Oxfordshire, Gloucestershire, Wiltshire, Somerset, Warwickshire, and Worcestershire. They reach a highest point of 330 m (1,082 ft) at Cleeve Hill.

Areas of lower hills, in the range 200 m (600 ft) - 300 m (1000 ft), include Charnwood Forest in Leicestershire, Cannock Chase in Staffordshire, and the Lincolnshire Wolds (100 m (300 ft) - 200 m (600 ft)); the latter having some prominence despite their modest altitude given their location in typically low-lying Lincolnshire near to the east coast.

Lincolnshire is the only coastal county in the Midlands as the region is bordered by Wales to the west. It is also where the Midlands&#x27; lowest points can be found as some places fall below sea level, with the lowest points being near Thorpe Tilney in North Kesteven and Stickford in East Lindsey. 

=== Climate ===
The Midlands has a temperate maritime climate, with cold, cloudy, wet winters and comfortable, mostly dry, mostly sunny summers. The temperature usually ranges from during winter nights to during summer days. Due to its geographical location, which is furthest away from the coast than anywhere else in England, it typically receives mostly light winds, with warm days and cold nights. Sometimes the Midlands can have very cold nights such as a minimum of in Pershore on 20 December 2010. The previous day had a maximum of only , also in Pershore. Hot days are also possible, such as a maximum of in Pershore on 19 July 2006. There can also be very mild winters nights, such as in Bidford-on-Avon when the temperature at 6 pm was as high as on 9 January 2015. At 8 am the following morning the temperature was still at . Both the highest and lowest temperature ever recorded in England were in the Midlands, the former on 19 July 2022 around Coningsby in Lincolnshire where it reached a maximum temperature of , and the latter on 10 January 1982 around Newport in Shropshire where it dropped to a minimum of .
=== Largest settlements and urban areas ===
The table below shows the urban areas in the region with a population of at least 250,000.
== Divisions ==
The West Midlands and East Midlands regions are NUTS 1 statistical regions and were formerly constituencies of the European Parliament. Local government in the Midlands is as follows:
* Boroughs (Metropolitan or Unitary):
** Birmingham (&quot;Metropolitan borough&quot;).
** Coventry (&quot;Metropolitan borough&quot;).
** Derby (&quot;Unitary authority&quot;).
** Dudley (&quot;Metropolitan borough&quot;).
** Leicester (&quot;Unitary authority&quot;).
** Nottingham (&quot;Unitary authority&quot;).
** Sandwell (&quot;Metropolitan borough&quot;).
** Stoke-on-Trent (&quot;Unitary authority&quot;).
** Solihull (&quot;Metropolitan borough&quot;).
** Telford and Wrekin (&quot;Unitary authority&quot;).
** Walsall (&quot;Metropolitan borough&quot;).
** Wolverhampton (&quot;Metropolitan borough&quot;).
* Counties (Non-metropolitan or Unitary): 
** Derbyshire (&quot;Districts: Amber Valley, Bolsover, Chesterfield, Derbyshire Dales, Erewash, High Peak, North East Derbyshire and South Derbyshire&quot;).
** Herefordshire (&quot;Unitary authority&quot;).
** Leicestershire (&quot;Districts: Blaby, Charnwood, Harborough, Hinckley and Bosworth, Melton, North West Leicestershire and Oadby and Wigston&quot;).
** Lincolnshire (&quot;Districts: Boston, East Lindsey, Lincoln, North Kesteven, South Holland, South Kesteven and West Lindsey&quot;).
** North Northamptonshire (&quot;Unitary authority&quot;).
** Nottinghamshire (&quot;Districts: Ashfield, Bassetlaw, Broxtowe, Gedling, Mansfield, Newark and Sherwood and Rushcliffe&quot;).
** Rutland (&quot;Unitary authority&quot;).
** Shropshire (&quot;Unitary authority&quot;).
** Staffordshire (&quot;Districts: Cannock Chase, East Staffordshire, Lichfield, Newcastle-under-Lyme, South Staffordshire, Stafford, Staffordshire Moorlands and Tamworth&quot;).
** Warwickshire (&quot;Districts: North Warwickshire, Nuneaton and Bedworth, Rugby, Stratford-on-Avon and Warwick&quot;).
** West Northamptonshire (&quot;Unitary authority&quot;).
** Worcestershire (&quot;Districts: Bromsgrove, Malvern Hills, Redditch, Worcester, Wychavon and Wyre Forest&quot;).

The unitary authorities of North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire (not shown), while classed as part of the ceremonial county of Lincolnshire, actually come under the Yorkshire and the Humber region and are therefore not in the officially recognised East Midlands region.

The two regions of the Midlands have a combined population of 10,350,697 (2014 mid-year estimate), and an area of .

The largest Midlands conurbation, which includes the cities of Birmingham and Wolverhampton, is roughly covered by the metropolitan county of the West Midlands (which also includes the city of Coventry); with the related City Region extending into neighbouring areas of Shropshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Worcestershire.

=== Historic counties ===
The historic counties ceased to be used for any administrative purpose in 1899. However, they remain important to some people, notably for county cricket.

<text>Ulrich Hans Walter (born February 9, 1954) is a German physicist, engineer and former DFVLR astronaut.

== Education ==
Walter was born in Iserlohn. After finishing secondary school there and two years in the Bundeswehr, he studied physics at the University of Cologne. In 1980, he was awarded a diploma degree, and five years later a doctorate, both in the field of solid-state physics.

After two post-doc positions at the Argonne National Laboratory, Chicago, Illinois, and the University of California at Berkeley, California, he was selected in 1987 to join the German astronaut team. From 1988 to 1990, he completed basic training at the German Aerospace Center, and was then nominated to be in the prime crew for the second German Spacelab mission.

Walter is married, has two children, and lives near Munich, Germany.

== Spaceflight ==
In 1993, he flew on board the Space Shuttle Columbia on mission STS-55 (Spacelab D-2) as a Payload Specialist. He spent 9 days, 23 hours, and 40 minutes in space.

== Career ==
After his spaceflight he worked for another four years at DLR, managing a space imaging database project. When the German astronaut team was merged into a European Space Agency, he did not transfer, but resigned to work at IBM Germany.

In 2003, he became full professor at the Technische Universität München (Munich, Germany), holding the chair of the Institute of Astronautics (space technology) at the University&#x27;s faculty of mechanical engineering. In 2008, he was distinguished as Professor of the Year 2008 in the category &quot;engineering sciences and computer science&quot;.

He serves on the advisory board of Deutsches Museum, on the advisory council of Giordano Bruno Foundation, and he is president of the &quot;Hermann Oberth Space Travel Museum&quot; in Feucht. He is the author of several books, including the illustrated book &quot;In 90 Minuten um die Erde&quot; (&quot;Around the World in 90 Minutes&quot;), and he has published more than 80 articles in various international journals.

<text>In set theory, Kőnig&#x27;s theorem states that if the axiom of choice holds, &quot;I&quot; is a set, formula_1 and formula_2 are cardinal numbers for every &quot;i&quot; in &quot;I&quot;, and formula_3 for every &quot;i&quot; in &quot;I&quot;, then 

formula_4

The sum here is the cardinality of the disjoint union of the sets &quot;mi&quot;, and the product is the cardinality of the Cartesian product. However, without the use of the axiom of choice, the sum and the product cannot be defined as cardinal numbers, and the meaning of the inequality sign would need to be clarified.

Kőnig&#x27;s theorem was introduced by in the slightly weaker form that the sum of a strictly increasing sequence of nonzero cardinal numbers is less than their product.

== Details ==

The precise statement of the result: if &quot;I&quot; is a set, &quot;Ai&quot; and &quot;Bi&quot; are sets for every &quot;i&quot; in &quot;I&quot;, and formula_5 for every &quot;i&quot; in &quot;I&quot;, then 

formula_6

where &lt; means &quot;strictly less than in cardinality&quot;, i.e. there is an injective function from &quot;Ai&quot; to &quot;Bi&quot;, but not one going the other way. The union involved need not be disjoint (a non-disjoint union can&#x27;t be any bigger than the disjoint version, also assuming the axiom of choice). In this formulation, Kőnig&#x27;s theorem is equivalent to the axiom of choice.

(Of course, Kőnig&#x27;s theorem is trivial if the cardinal numbers &quot;mi&quot; and &quot;ni&quot; are finite and the index set &quot;I&quot; is finite. If &quot;I&quot; is empty, then the left sum is the empty sum and therefore 0, while the right product is the empty product and therefore 1.)

Kőnig&#x27;s theorem is remarkable because of the strict inequality in the conclusion. There are many easy rules for the arithmetic of infinite sums and products of cardinals in which one can only conclude a weak inequality ≤, for example: if formula_7 for all &quot;i&quot; in &quot;I&quot;, then one can only conclude

formula_8

since, for example, setting formula_9 and formula_10, where the index set &quot;I&quot; is the natural numbers, yields the sum formula_11 for both sides, and we have an equality.

==Corollaries of Kőnig&#x27;s theorem==
* If formula_12 is a cardinal, then formula_13.
If we take formula_14, and formula_15 for each formula_16 in formula_12, then the left side of the above inequality is just formula_12, while the right side is formula_19, the cardinality of functions from formula_12 to formula_21, that is, the cardinality of the power set of formula_12. Thus, Kőnig&#x27;s theorem gives us an alternate proof of Cantor&#x27;s theorem. (Historically of course Cantor&#x27;s theorem was proved much earlier.)

===Axiom of choice===
One way of stating the axiom of choice is &quot;an arbitrary Cartesian product of non-empty sets is non-empty&quot;. Let &quot;Bi&quot; be a non-empty set for each &quot;i&quot; in &quot;I&quot;. Let &quot;Ai&quot; = {} for each &quot;i&quot; in &quot;I&quot;. Thus by Kőnig&#x27;s theorem, we have:
* If formula_23, then formula_24.
That is, the Cartesian product of the given non-empty sets &quot;Bi&quot; has a larger cardinality than the sum of empty sets. Thus it is non-empty, which is just what the axiom of choice states. Since the axiom of choice follows from Kőnig&#x27;s theorem, we will use the axiom of choice freely and implicitly when discussing consequences of the theorem.

=== Kőnig&#x27;s theorem and cofinality===
Kőnig&#x27;s theorem has also important consequences for cofinality of cardinal numbers.

* If formula_25, then formula_26.

If κ is regular, then this follows from Cantor&#x27;s theorem. If κ is singular, then κ is a limit cardinal. Choose a strictly increasing cf(κ)-sequence of cardinals approaching κ. Let λ be their sum. Each summand is less than κ, so, by Kőnig&#x27;s theorem, λ is less than the product of cf(κ) copies of κ. We finish the proof by showing that λ = κ. Since each summand is a lower bound for λ, λ ≥ κ. For the other inequality, λ ≤ cf(κ)·κ = κ.

According to Easton&#x27;s theorem, the next consequence of Kőnig&#x27;s theorem is the only nontrivial constraint on the continuum function for regular cardinals.
* If formula_27 and formula_28, then formula_29.
Let formula_30. Suppose that, contrary to this corollary, formula_31. Then using the previous corollary, formula_32, a contradiction.

==A proof of Kőnig&#x27;s theorem==
Assuming Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, including especially the axiom of choice, we can prove the theorem. Remember that we are given formula_33, and we want to show formula_34

The axiom of choice implies that the condition &quot;A&quot; &lt; &quot;B&quot; is equivalent to the condition that there is no function from &quot;A&quot; onto &quot;B&quot; and &quot;B&quot; is nonempty.
So we are given that there is no function from &quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot; onto &quot;B&quot;&quot;i&quot;≠{}, and we have to show that any function &quot;f&quot; from the disjoint union of the &quot;A&quot;s to the product of the &quot;B&quot;s is not surjective and that the product is nonempty. That the product is nonempty follows immediately from the axiom of choice and the fact that the factors are nonempty. For each &quot;i&quot; choose a &quot;b&quot;&quot;i&quot; in &quot;B&quot;&quot;i&quot; not in the image of &quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot; under the composition of &quot;f&quot; with the projection to &quot;B&quot;&quot;i&quot;. Then the product of the elements &quot;b&quot;&quot;i&quot; is not in the image of &quot;f&quot;, so &quot;f&quot; does not map the disjoint union of the &quot;A&quot;s onto the product of the &quot;B&quot;s.

<doc id="184088" wikidata="Q6513309" url="?curid=184088" title="Lee College">
<text>Lee College is a public community college in Baytown, Texas. Lee College&#x27;s main campus occupies near downtown Baytown and extension campuses throughout its service area. The school has an enrollment of over 7,773 total students as of Fall 2018. Approximately 83% are part-time students, and about 17% are enrolled full-time. The college offers over 60 academic, technical education, and non-credit continuing education programs.

==History==
In 1934, the Goose Creek Consolidated Independent School District voted unanimously to ask the Texas State Board of Education to approve the establishment of a junior college district. The petition was approved, and the college&#x27;s first students matriculated in September 1934. Lee College is named after Confederate general Robert E. Lee.

At the time of its inception, the college was named Lee Junior College. Classes were held at Robert E. Lee High School in the evenings and during the summer months, after the high school classes were dismissed. Many of the original faculty also taught at Robert E. Lee High School. The inaugural class of Lee College consisted of 177 students, and the first graduation, on May 24, 1935, saw 4 students (all women) receive diplomas.

In 1948, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools granted Lee College accreditation and recommended that the college develop its own campus apart from the local high school. A successful bond election in the following year allowed for the construction of Rundell Hall and the campus gymnasium. The college experienced tremendous growth after classes began in the new buildings in 1951.

By 1965, the college had added the Social Sciences building, the Library, Moler Hall, TV1 and Bonner Hall as well as an addition to the gymnasium. Funding from the 1988 bond issue allowed for the construction of a new science building to replace the antiquated facilities formerly housed in the Math and Administration building. The renovation of the McNulty-Haddick building created additional classroom space for Allied Health and Fine Arts.

In 2000, another successful bond election led to expansion of the campus by more than 33 percent with the addition in 2002 of a new Advanced Technology Center (library). Parking was also expanded and beautification efforts including a central courtyard, covered walks, and landscaping were completed.

In 2003, the Technical-Vocational Building received major renovation, including the construction of a Cisco Academy.

In October 2004, the college completed renovation to the old library into a Student Center with game room, Cyber Café, Bayer Conference Center, Enterprise Gallery, Security office, and student club offices. In December 2004, the college finished renovation to the old gym, which now provides offices, swimming pool, weight room and other facilities.

In 2008, Lee College began construction of its showcase Performing Arts Center, which opened in 2009 and today hosts a variety of campus and community events.

In 2012, a paper by former honor student Celeste Butler earned the school a historical marker dedication.

In 2015, Rundell Hall saw its grand reopening following a $10 million restoration and expansion. Rundell Hall now serves as the administrative center of the Lee College Baytown campus and has a conference center as well as offices and various departments.

In 2013–2014, the Lee College Debate Team won the 2013-2014 International Public Debate Association (IPDA) Community College Championship as well as the 2014 IPDA National Championship Tournament Community College Championship. Lee College Debate, renamed the Mendoza Debate Society at Lee College, repeated as both 2014-2015 IPDA Community College Champions as well as 2015 IPDA National Championship Tournament Community College Champions.

<text>Soest (, as if it were &#x27;Sohst&#x27;; Westphalian: &quot;Saust&quot;) is a city in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is the capital of the Soest district.

==Geography==
Soest is located along the &quot;Hellweg&quot; road, approximately south-west of Lippstadt, roughly east of Dortmund and roughly west of Paderborn.

===Neighbouring places===
*Bad Sassendorf
*Ense
*Lippetal
*Möhnesee
*Werl
*Welver

==Legends==
The Norwegian Þiðrekssaga from the 13th century, a series of tales about the Gothic King Theoderic the Great, identifies Soest (called Susat) as the capital of Attila&#x27;s (?–453) Hunnic Empire. The actual location of Attila&#x27;s capital has not been determined.

==History==
Owing to its fertile soil (predominantly brown silty clay loam), the area around Soest is believed to have been settled well before the village is first mentioned in the &quot;Dagobertsche Schenkung&quot; in 836. Excavations in recent decades have uncovered signs of habitation stretching back more than 4000 years. During the 11th and 12th centuries, Soest grew considerably, making it one of the largest towns in Westphalia with some 10,000 citizens. It was also, until 1609, an important member of the Hanseatic League.

In the geographical work Atar Al-Belad composed by Iranian scholar Mohammad Qazvini (1203-1283), Soest is described for its salt production and referred to as a &quot;Slavic country&quot;: “There is a salty spring, while there is no salt to be found in the surroundings. When people make salt they take water from the spring, filling a kettle and placing it in an oven made from stone, lighting a large fire underneath, turning it into a thick and murky fluid. Then it is left to cool, leaving solid white salt. In this manner, all white salt is produced in the Slavic countries.”

An increasingly confident and powerful Soest liberated itself, between 1444 and 1449, from the Bishop of Cologne, who controlled Westphalia (the so-called Soest Feud). No longer a capital of Westphalia, Soest aligned itself instead with the Duke of Cleves. This proved to be mostly a Pyrrhic victory, however. Though it had shown itself strong enough to defy the powerful Archbishop of Cologne, the town lost much of its trade as a consequence, with a &quot;liberated&quot; Soest surrounded by territories with other allegiances. When the last Duke of Cleves died in 1609, his dukedom was inherited by Brandenburg and, after a short siege, Soest was incorporated into it.

The painter Peter Lely, later to win fame in England, was born in 1618 in Soest to Dutch parents, where his father was an officer serving in the armed forces of Elector Johann Sigismund of Brandenburg.

During and after the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Soest suffered a tremendous loss of both population and influence; at its lowest point, in 1756, having merely 3,600 citizens.

With the creation of the Soest district in 1817, its influence again began to rise. However, the industrialization of the Ruhr area throughout the 19th century did not reach Soest, which remained a small town.

Under the re-drawing of political borders within the Reich by the Nazi Party Soest was placed in Gau Westphalia-South. During World War II, 
the Stalag VI-E prisoner-of-war camp for Polish, French, Belgian and British POWs was operated in the town. Soest was the target of several allied bomber raids targeting the marshalling yard, one of the biggest in the Reich, and the important battery factory Akku Hagen. In early April 1945, Soest suffered from major fighting as Allied forces captured the town. Though retaken by a German counterattack shortly thereafter, destructive front-line combat continued to rage in Soest and its environs at the eastern edge of the Ruhr Pocket until the Allies ultimately gained permanent control.

From 1953 to 1971, a sizable garrison of Canadian soldiers and their families was stationed at Soest (with the Canadian camps located just east of the town in Bad Sassendorf), as well as at Werl and Hemer-Iserlohn and Deilinghofen to the southwest. In addition, an American Nike Battery (66th Battalion) was situated just south of the town, and was subsequently turned over to the German military.

From 1971 to 1993, the former Canadian properties, including the Married Quarters along Hiddingser Weg, south of the B-1, were used and occupied by British military personnel and their families. With the eventual closure of the Belgian and British army facilities, many of these properties were re-purposed for civilian use, abandoned, or demolished. The former Married Quarters area was converted to civilian housing. The former CANEX (the Canadian Army&#x27;s food and clothing store for NATO families) was converted to a NAAFI under the British and finally demolished in 2006.

==Education==
The city is home to a major branch of the South Westphalia University of Applied Sciences (also: Fachhochschule Südwestfalen (FH SWF)) which offers various engineering, and Business Administration programmes.

==Sights==
Soest has a multitude of historical buildings and attractions. The many medieval churches are built from a greenish sandstone unique to this area.

===St. Patroclus===

In 960, Bruno I, Archbishop of Cologne transferred relics of St. Patroclus from Troyes to Soest. From 964 on, they have been housed in what became the provost church &quot;St.-Patrokli-Dom&quot; (St. Patroclus&#x27; &quot;Cathedral&quot;), a particularly fine example of Romanesque architecture.

The cathedral is an example of early medieval Romanesque architecture fashioned from the local greenish sandstone. Its massive squared bell tower or steeple can be seen for many kilometres, rising up out of the city centre of the old town and a landmark of the Soester Boerde.

===Allerheiligenkirmes===
The Allerheiligenkirmes is named for All Saints&#x27; Day as it starts every year at the first Wednesday after All Saints&#x27; and lasts for five days. It is Europe&#x27;s biggest old town fair and was held for the 685th time in 2023.

===Specialties of Soest===
Among the traditional specialities of Soest are Möppken bread and pumpernickel. The Haverland bakery in the city centre, which formerly supplied dark bread to the royal court of Bavaria, has existed since 1570. A more recent speciality is &quot;Bullenauge&quot; (Bull&#x27;s Eye), a mocha liqueur, sold mostly at the Allerheiligenkirmes. Another speciality is the Soester beer, also known as &quot;Zwiebel-Bier&quot; (Onion Beer) as it has been brewed, since 1993, in the Zwiebel (Onion) Inn.

==Coat of arms==
The town&#x27;s coat of arms shows a key, which is the symbol for Saint Peter, the patron saint of Cologne. The key symbol remained unchanged, even after Soest no longer fell within the jurisdiction of Cologne.

<text>The JEDEC (Joint Electron Device Engineering Council) Solid State Technology Association is an independent semiconductor engineering trade organization and standardization body headquartered in the United States.

JEDEC has over 300 members, including some of the world&#x27;s largest computer companies. Its scope and past activities includes standardization of part numbers, defining an electrostatic discharge (ESD) standard, and leadership in the lead-free manufacturing transition.

The origin of JEDEC traces back to 1944, when RMA (subsequently renamed EIA) and NEMA established the Joint Electron Tube Engineering Council (JETEC) to coordinate vacuum tube type numberings.

In 1958, with the advent of semiconductor technology, the joint JETEC-activity of EIA and NEMA was renamed into Joint Electron Device Engineering Council. NEMA discontinued its involvement in 1979. In the fall of 1999, JEDEC became a separate trade association under the current name, but maintained an EIA alliance, until EIA ceased operations in 2011.

==History==
The origin of JEDEC can be traced back to 1944, when the Radio Manufacturers Association (RMA), and the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) established the &quot;Joint Electron Tube Engineering Council&quot; (&quot;JETEC&quot;) to coordinate vacuum tube type numberings. The expansion of the radio industry caused JETEC to expand its scope to include solid-state devices and develop standards for semiconductor devices. Eventually, the joint JETEC activity of EIA and NEMA was renamed into &quot;Joint Electron Device Engineering Council&quot; (&quot;JEDEC&quot;) in 1958. NEMA discontinued its involvement in 1979.

Earlier in the 20th century, the organization was known as JETEC, the Joint Electron Tube Engineering Council, and was responsible for assigning and coordinating RETMA tube designations to electron tubes (also called valves). The type 6L6, still to be found in electric-guitar amplifiers, typically has a type number that was assigned by JETEC.

In the fall of 1999, JEDEC became a separate trade association under the current name, but maintained an EIA alliance.

==Standards policies==
JEDEC has adopted the principle of open standards, which permit any and all interested companies to freely manufacture in compliance with adopted standards. This serves several vital functions for the advancement of electronic technologies. First and foremost, such standards allow for interoperability between different electrical components. JEDEC standards do not protect members from normal patent obligations. The designated representatives of JEDEC member companies are required to disclose patents and patent applications of which they are aware, assuming that this information is not considered proprietary. JEDEC patent policy requires that standards found to contain patented technology, whose owners do not sign a standard JEDEC patent letter, be withdrawn. Thus the penalty for a failure to disclose patents is retraction of the standard. Typically, standards are not adopted to cover technology that are subject to patent protection. In rare circumstances, standards covered by a patent may be adopted, but only on the understanding that the patent owner will not enforce such patent rights or, at a minimum, that the patent owner will provide a reasonable and non-discriminatory license to the patented technology.

==Part numbers==
JEDEC&#x27;s early work began as a part numbering system for devices which became popular in the 1960s. The first semiconductor devices, such as the 1N23 silicon point contact diode, were still designated in the old &quot;RMA tube designation&quot; system, where the &quot;1&quot; stood for &quot;No filament/heater&quot; and the &quot;N&quot; stood for &quot;crystal rectifier&quot;. The first RMA digit thus was re-allocated from &quot;heater power&quot; to &quot;p-n junction count&quot; to form the new EIA/JEDEC &quot;EIA-370&quot; standard; for example, the 1N4001 rectifier diode and 2N2222 transistor part numbers came from &quot;EIA-370&quot;. They are still popular today. In February 1982, JEDEC issued &quot;JESD370B&quot;, superseding the original &quot;EIA-370&quot; and introducing a new letter symbol &quot;C&quot; that denotes the die version, as opposed to &quot;N&quot;, now meaning the packaged version. The Japanese JIS semiconductor designation system employs a similar pattern. JEDEC later developed a numbering system for integrated circuits, but this did not gain acceptance in the semiconductor industry. The European Pro Electron semiconductor numbering system originated in a similar way from the older Mullard–Philips tube designation.

==Test methods and product standards==
This early work was followed by a number of test methods, JESD22, and product standards. For example, the ESD caution symbol, which is the hand with the line drawn through it, was published by JEDEC and is used worldwide. JEDEC also has a dictionary of semiconductor terms. All of JEDEC standards are free on the Web for downloading after a free registration.

JEDEC has issued widely used standards for device interfaces, such as the JEDEC memory standards for computer memory (RAM), including the DDR SDRAM standards.

==Semiconductor package drawings==
JEDEC also developed a number of popular package drawings for semiconductors such as TO-3, TO-5, etc. These are on the web under JEP-95. One hot issue is the development of lead-free packages that do not suffer from the tin whiskers problem that reappeared since the recent ban on lead content. JEDEC is working with iNEMI on a joint interest group on lead-free issues.

==Members==
As of 2023, JEDEC has 365 members in total. Among them are large companies, which include the following:

<text>Soest () is a Kreis (district) in the middle of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Neighbouring districts are Warendorf, Gütersloh, Paderborn, Hochsauerland, Märkischer Kreis, Unna and the independent town of Hamm.

==History==
In medieval times Soest was the biggest town in Westphalia; however, after it liberated itself from the bishops of Cologne in the Soester Fehde in 1449 it slowly lost importance, only to gain it again when in 1816 the new Prussian government created the district. In 1975 the district was merged with the neighbouring district of Lippstadt and parts of the former district of Arnsberg.

==Geography==
Geographically it covers the northern part of the Sauerland hills and the lower land north of it, the &#x27;Hellweg&#x27;. The rather flat land and very fertile loess soil have made it an agricultural area from ancient times. The main rivers through the district are the Ruhr, the Lippe and the Möhne, which is dammed to form the Möhne Reservoir. The highest elevation is in the area of Warstein at 580m, while the lowest is the Lippe valley at 65m.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms show two symbols of the bishops of Cologne, who possessed Soest until 1449. In left half is the key of Saint Peter, the patron of Cologne; in the right is the black cross of Cologne. After the district was merged with Lippstadt the rose, symbol of the Lippe area, was added on top of the cross. This new version of the coat of arms was granted in 1976.

<doc id="184099" wikidata="Q15222032" url="?curid=184099" title="Bias (statistics)">
<text>Statistical bias, in the mathematical field of statistics, is a systematic tendency in which the methods used to gather data and generate statistics present an inaccurate, skewed or biased depiction of reality. Statistical bias exists in numerous stages of the data collection and analysis process, including: the source of the data, the methods used to collect the data, the estimator chosen, and the methods used to analyze the data. Data analysts can take various measures at each stage of the process to reduce the impact of statistical bias in their work. Understanding the source of statistical bias can help to assess whether the observed results are close to actuality. Issues of statistical bias has been argued to be closely linked to issues of statistical validity.

Statistical bias can have significant real world implications as data is used to inform decision making across a wide variety of processes in society. Data is used to inform lawmaking, industry regulation, corporate marketing and distribution tactics, and institutional policies in organizations and workplaces. Therefore, there can be significant implications if statistical bias is not accounted for and controlled. For example, if a pharmaceutical company wishes to explore the effect of a medication on the common cold but the data sample only includes men, any conclusions made from that data will be biased towards how the medication affects men rather than people in general. That means the information would be incomplete and not useful for deciding if the medication is ready for release in the general public. In this scenario, the bias can be addressed by broadening the sample. This sampling error is only one of the ways in which data can be biased. 

Bias can be differentiated from other statistical mistakes such as accuracy (instrument failure/inadequacy), lack of data, or mistakes in transcription (typos). Bias implies that the data selection may have been skewed by the collection criteria. Other forms of human-based bias emerge in data collection as well such as response bias, in which participants give inaccurate responses to a question. Bias does not preclude the existence of any other mistakes. One may have a poorly designed sample, an inaccurate measurement device, and typos in recording data simultaneously. Ideally, all factors are controlled and accounted for.

Also it is useful to recognize that the term “error” specifically refers to the outcome rather than the process (errors of rejection or acceptance of the hypothesis being tested), or from the phenomenon of random errors. The terms &quot;flaw&quot; or &quot;mistake&quot; are recommended to differentiate procedural errors from these specifically defined outcome-based terms.

== Bias of an estimator ==
Statistical bias is a feature of a statistical technique or of its results whereby the expected value of the results differs from the true underlying quantitative parameter being estimated. The bias of an estimator of a parameter should not be confused with its degree of precision, as the degree of precision is a measure of the sampling error. The bias is defined as follows: let formula_1 be a statistic used to estimate a parameter formula_2, and let formula_3 denote the expected value of formula_1. Then,

:formula_5

is called the bias of the statistic formula_1 (with respect to formula_2). If formula_8, then formula_1 is said to be an &quot;unbiased estimator&quot; of formula_2; otherwise, it is said to be a &quot;biased estimator&quot; of formula_2.

The bias of a statistic formula_1 is always relative to the parameter formula_2 it is used to estimate, but the parameter formula_2 is often omitted when it is clear from the context what is being estimated.

==Types==
Statistical bias comes from all stages of data analysis. The following sources of bias will be listed in each stage separately.

===Data selection===

Selection bias involves individuals being more likely to be selected for study than others, biasing the sample. This can also be termed selection effect, sampling bias and &quot;Berksonian bias&quot;.
*Spectrum bias arises from evaluating diagnostic tests on biased patient samples, leading to an overestimate of the sensitivity and specificity of the test. For example, a high prevalence of disease in a study population increases positive predictive values, which will cause a bias between the prediction values and the real ones.
*Observer selection bias occurs when the evidence presented has been pre-filtered by observers, which is so-called anthropic principle. The data collected is not only filtered by the design of experiment, but also by the necessary precondition that there must be someone doing a study. An example is the impact of the Earth in the past. The impact event may cause the extinction of intelligent animals, or there were no intelligent animals at that time. Therefore, some impact events have not been observed, but they may have occurred in the past.
*Volunteer bias occurs when volunteers have intrinsically different characteristics from the target population of the study. Research has shown that volunteers tend to come from families with higher socioeconomic status. Furthermore, another study shows that women are more probable to volunteer for studies than men.
*Funding bias may lead to the selection of outcomes, test samples, or test procedures that favor a study&#x27;s financial sponsor.
*Attrition bias arises due to a loss of participants, e.g., loss of follow up during a study.
*Recall bias arises due to differences in the accuracy or completeness of participant recollections of past events; for example, patients cannot recall how many cigarettes they smoked last week exactly, leading to over-estimation or under-estimation.

===Hypothesis testing===
Type I and type II errors in statistical hypothesis testing leads to wrong results. Type I error happens when the null hypothesis is correct but is rejected. For instance, suppose that the null hypothesis is that if the average driving speed limit ranges from 75 to 85 km/h, it is not considered as speeding. On the other hand, if the average speed is not in that range, it is considered speeding. If someone receives a ticket with an average driving speed of 7 km/h, the decision maker has committed a Type I error. In other words, the average driving speed meets the null hypothesis but is rejected. On the contrary, Type II error happens when the null hypothesis is not correct but is accepted.

Bias in hypothesis testing occurs when the power (the complement of the type II error rate) at some alternative is lower than the supremum of the Type I error rate (which is usually the significance level, formula_15). Equivalently, if no rejection rate at any alternative is lower than the rejection rate at any point in the null hypothesis set, the test is said to be unbiased.

===Estimator selection===

The bias of an estimator is the difference between an estimator&#x27;s expected value and the true value of the parameter being estimated. Although an unbiased estimator is theoretically preferable to a biased estimator, in practice, biased estimators with small biases are frequently used. A biased estimator may be more useful for several reasons. First, an unbiased estimator may not exist without further assumptions. Second, sometimes an unbiased estimator is hard to compute. Third, a biased estimator may have a lower value of mean squared error. 

* A biased estimator is better than any unbiased estimator arising from the Poisson distribution. The value of a biased estimator is always positive and the mean squared error of it is smaller than the unbiased one, which makes the biased estimator be more accurate.

* Omitted-variable bias is the bias that appears in estimates of parameters in regression analysis when the assumed specification omits an independent variable that should be in the model.

===Analysis methods===
* Detection bias occurs when a phenomenon is more likely to be observed for a particular set of study subjects. For instance, the syndemic involving obesity and diabetes may mean doctors are more likely to look for diabetes in obese patients than in thinner patients, leading to an inflation in diabetes among obese patients because of skewed detection efforts.
* In educational measurement, bias is defined as &quot;Systematic errors in test content, test administration, and/or scoring procedures that can cause some test takers to get either lower or higher scores than their true ability would merit.&quot; The source of the bias is irrelevant to the trait the test is intended to measure.
*Observer bias arises when the researcher subconsciously influences the experiment due to cognitive bias where judgment may alter how an experiment is carried out / how results are recorded. 

===Interpretation===
Reporting bias involves a skew in the availability of data, such that observations of a certain kind are more likely to be reported.

== Addressing statistical bias ==
Depending on the type of bias present, researchers and analysts can take different steps to reduce bias on a data set. All types of bias mentioned above have corresponding measures which can be taken to reduce or eliminate their impacts. 

Bias should be accounted for at every step of the data collection process, beginning with clearly defined research parameters and consideration of the team who will be conducting the research. Observer bias may be reduced by implementing a blind or double-blind technique. Avoidance of p-hacking is essential to the process of accurate data collection. One way to check for bias in results after is rerunning analyses with different independent variables to observe whether a given phenomenon still occurs in dependent variables. Careful use of language in reporting can reduce misleading phrases, such as discussion of a result &quot;approaching&quot; statistical significant as compared to actually achieving it.

<text>Singing sand, also called whistling sand, barking sand, booming sand or singing dune, is sand that produces sound. The sound emission may be caused by wind passing over dunes or by walking on the sand.

Certain conditions have to come together to create singing sand:
# The sand grains have to be round and between 0.1 and 0.5 mm in diameter.
# The sand has to contain silica.
# The sand needs to be at a certain humidity.

The most common frequency emitted seems to be close to 450 Hz.

There are various theories about the singing sand mechanism. It has been proposed that the sound frequency is controlled by the shear rate. Others have suggested that the frequency of vibration is related to the thickness of the dry surface layer of sand. The sound waves bounce back and forth between the surface of the dune and the surface of the moist layer, creating a resonance that increases the sound&#x27;s volume. The noise may be generated by friction between the grains or by the compression of air between them.

Other sounds that can be emitted by sand have been described as &quot;roaring&quot; or &quot;booming&quot;.

==In dunes==
Singing sand dunes, an example of the phenomenon of singing sand, produce a sound described as roaring, booming, squeaking, or the &quot;Song of Dunes&quot;. This is a natural sound phenomenon of up to 105 decibels, lasting as long as several minutes, that occurs in about 35 desert locations around the world. The sound is similar to a loud low-pitch rumble. It emanates from crescent-shaped dunes, or barchans. The sound emission accompanies a slumping or avalanching movement of sand, usually triggered by wind passing over the dune or by someone walking near the crest.

Examples of singing sand dunes include California&#x27;s Kelso Dunes and Eureka Dunes; AuTrain Beach in Northern Michigan; sugar sand beaches and Warren Dunes in southwestern Michigan; Sand Mountain in Nevada; the Booming Dunes in the Namib Desert, Africa; Porth Oer (also known as Whistling Sands) near Aberdaron in Wales; Indiana Dunes in Indiana; Barking Sands Beach in Hawaiʻi; Ming Sha Shan in Dunhuang, China; Kotogahama Beach in Odashi, Japan; Singing Beach in Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts; near Mesaieed in Qatar; and Gebel Naqous, near el-Tor, South Sinai, Egypt.

The song &quot;The Singing Sands of Alamosa&quot; on Bing Crosby&#x27;s 1947 album &quot;Drifting and Dreaming&quot; was inspired by the sand dunes near Alamosa, Colorado, now Great Sand Dunes National Park.

==On the beach==
On some beaches around the world, dry sand makes a singing, squeaking, whistling, or screaming sound if a person scuffs or shuffles their feet with sufficient force. The phenomenon is not completely understood scientifically, but it has been found that quartz sand does this if the grains are highly spherical. It is believed by some that the sand grains must be of similar size, so the sand must be well sorted by the actions of wind and waves, and that the grains should be close to spherical and have surfaces free of dust, pollution and organic matter. The &quot;singing&quot; sound is then believed to be produced by shear, as each layer of sand grains slides over the layer beneath it. The similarity in size, the uniformity, and the cleanness means that grains move up and down in unison over the layer of grains below them. Even small amounts of pollution on the sand grains reduce the friction enough to silence the sand.

Others believe that the sound is produced by the friction of grain against grain that have been coated with dried salt, in a way that is analogous to the way that the rosin on the bow produces sounds from a violin string. It has also been speculated that thin layers of gas trapped and released between the grains act as &quot;percussive cushions&quot; capable of vibration, and so produce the tones heard.

Not all sands sing, whistle or bark alike. The sounds heard have a wide frequency range that can be different for each patch of sand. Fine sands, where individual grains are barely visible to the naked eye, produce only a poor, weak sounding bark. Medium-sized grains can emit a range of sounds, from a faint squeak or a high-pitched sound, to the best and loudest barks when scuffed enthusiastically.

Water also influences the effect. Wet sands are usually silent because the grains stick together instead of sliding past each other, but small amounts of water can actually raise the pitch of the sounds produced. The most common part of the beach on which to hear singing sand is the dry upper beach above the normal high tide line, but singing has been reported on the lower beach near the low tide line as well.

Singing sand has been reported on 33 beaches in the British Isles, including in the north of Wales and on the little island of Eigg in the Scottish Hebrides. It has also been reported at a number of beaches along North America&#x27;s Atlantic coast. Singing sands can be found at Souris, on the eastern tip of Prince Edward Island, at the Singing Sands beach in Basin Head Provincial Park; on Singing Beach in Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts, as well as in the fresh waters of Lake Superior and Lake Michigan and in other places.

<text>Grand Manan is a Canadian island in the Bay of Fundy, part of the province of New Brunswick. Grand Manan is also the name of an incorporated village, which includes the main island and numerous nearby islands; White Head Island, small islands near it, and Machias Seal Island are not part of the village.

The point on the mainland closest to the island is near the town of Lubec, Maine, the easternmost point of the continental United States, across the Grand Manan Channel. Grand Manan is 32 kilometres south of Blacks Harbour, New Brunswick.

==Toponymy==
&quot;Manan&quot; is a corruption of &quot;mun-an-ook&quot; or &quot;man-an-ook&quot;, meaning &quot;island place&quot; or &quot;the island&quot;, from the Maliseet-Passamaquoddy-Penobscot First Nations who, according to oral history, used Grand Manan and its surrounding islands as a safe place for the elderly Passamaquoddy during winter months and as a sacred burial place (&quot;ook&quot; means &quot;people of&quot;). In 1606 Samuel de Champlain sheltered on nearby White Head Island and produced a map calling the island &quot;Manthane&quot;, which he later changed to &quot;Menane&quot; or &quot;Menasne&quot;.

==History==


Portuguese explorer João Álvares Fagundes charted the area around 1520, but the island does not appear clearly on a map until 1558, produced by Portuguese cartographer Diogo Homem. French merchant-explorer Étienne Bellenger visited the area in January 1583.

In 1693, the island was granted to Paul D&#x27;Ailleboust, Sieur de Périgny as part of Champlain&#x27;s &quot;New France&quot;. D&#x27;Ailleboust did not take possession of it, and it reverted to the French Crown, in whose possession it remained until 1713, when it was traded to the British in the Treaty of Utrecht.

The first permanent settlement was established in 1784, when Moses Gerrish gathered a group of settlers on an area of Grand Manan he called Ross Island, in honour of settler Thomas Ross. During the American Revolution, just off the island there were many naval battles between American privateers and British shipping.

Because of the Treaty of Paris (1783), the U.S. considered Grand Manan to be its possession due to the island&#x27;s proximity to Maine. Britain obtained title in Jay&#x27;s Treaty of 1794, while surrendering its sovereignty claims over Eastport on Moose, Frederick and Dudley islands in nearby Cobscook Bay.

From 1812 to 1814, the Bay of Fundy was infested with privateers who raided and plundered villages. The ownership of islands in Passamaquoddy Bay was not settled until 1817, when the United States gave up its claim to Grand Manan and the surrounding islands.

By 1832 schools were established by the Episcopalian Church. In 1838, St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church was the victim of an attempted arson, and in 1839 it was destroyed by arson with an effigy holding a paper that showed &quot;hostility toward the Bishop...the rector...and four other persons of this county&quot;; the government offered a reward for information and many accused Wilfred Fisher or those near him as having had a feud with the rector.

While neighbouring islands along the American coast to Boston relied on whaling, Grand Manan had fishing and shipbuilding.

In 1831 the Gannet Rock Lighthouse was built on a rocky islet south of Grand Manan, to protect shipping en route to Saint John, New Brunswick. It is Grand Manan&#x27;s oldest lighthouse.

This period was also marked by a number of shipwrecks off the island&#x27;s rocky, cliff-lined coast. In 1857, the &quot;Lord Ashburton&quot;, was driven into the cliffs at the northern end of the island by hurricane-force winds to great loss of life. Another wreck was the Nova Scotian barque &quot;Walton&quot;, which was bound for Saint John, New Brunswick, from Wales when it wrecked on the White Ledge off Grand Manan on September 14, 1878.

By 1851, the island population numbered almost 1,200 permanent inhabitants, most working in fishing.

By 1884, Grand Manan became the largest supplier of smoked herring in the world. By 1920, it produced one million boxes—or twenty thousand tons—of smoked herring, all caught in its local waters.

By the late Victorian era, Grand Manan had been discovered by a new breed of explorers—the &quot;tourists&quot;—who began visiting the island in steady numbers, weaving themselves into the fabric of its close-knit, isolated society. Pulitzer Prize–winning author Willa Cather loved the island&#x27;s unspoiled solitude, while painters such as Alfred Thompson Bricher and John James Audubon came to Grand Manan and its outlying islands to capture what they believed to be its &quot;unique majesty&quot;, documenting its varied geography and indigenous fauna.

==Geography==
Grand Manan Island is the largest of the Fundy Islands and the primary island in the Grand Manan archipelago. The archipelago incorporates many nearby smaller islands including popular White Head Island, Ross and Cheney Islands, the Wood Islands and dozens of surrounding shoaling rocks.

The Western side of the main island and the smaller islands form numerous passages, coves, and rocky reefs.

Grand Manan is long and has a maximum width of with an area of .

The vast majority of Grand Manan residents live on the eastern side of the island. Due to limited access, cliffs and high winds, the western side of the island is not residentially developed.

===Geology===
The western two-thirds of the island shows thick lava flows (basalt) of Late Triassic age, part of a flood basalt that underlies most of the Bay of Fundy. The Fundy basalts are themselves a small portion of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province which was formed in a volcanic event preceding the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea in the Early Jurassic.

Many minerals have filled the cracks and bubbles left by gases boiling out of the cooling lavas. They include zeolite minerals such as chabazite, mesolite, stilbite, and heulandite, plus attractive quartz-related amethyst, agate, jasper, and many others. Good collecting areas include Seven Days Work, Indian Beach, and Bradford Cove. A few meters of siltstone are exposed under the basalt along the western shoreline, which by analogy with the Blomidon Formation in Nova Scotia must include the Triassic-Jurassic boundary.

Harbours along the eastern shoreline were created by the erosion of complex fault and fold structures in ancient metamorphosed sedimentary and volcanic rock formations. A major north–south fault is exposed at Red Point, and it divides these older eastern rocks from the western basalts. The metamorphic formations are organized into groups called Castalia, Ingalls Head, and Grand Manan, and there are also metamorphosed plutonic masses such as Stanley Brook Granite, Rockweed Pond Gabbro, and Kent Island Granite.

These rocks have recently been dated between 539 and 618 million years old [ref. Black and others, 2007] and are now considered to correlate with the New River and Mascarene terranes of southern New Brunswick, Canada. Although originally they were igneous and sedimentary rocks such as basalt, sandstone, and shale, the eastern formations have been metamorphosed into greenstone, phyllite, argillite, schist, quartzite, and other foliated types. In addition, many folds and faults have bent and broken the formations in rather tortured-looking outcrops. One such fault can be seen at the north end of Pettes Cove, where it separates metabasalt of Swallowtail Head from schist of North Head.

===Climate===
Grand Manan has a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;). The climate in spring, summer and fall is very comfortable but winter has an inconsistent weather pattern with snow, rain, freezing rain and mild weather. Its average of 177 frost-free days is the highest anywhere in the province.

Since 2000, the average annual precipitation has been 859.8 mm with August being the driest month (35 mm) and October (112 mm) the wettest.

The highest temperature ever recorded on Grand Manan was on 26 July 1963. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 10 January 1890.

==Economy==

Grand Manan&#x27;s economy is dependent upon fishing, aquaculture and tourism. Lobster, herring, scallops and crab are most commonly sought among fishermen. Together with ocean salmon farms, dulse, rock weed and clam digging, many residents make their living &quot;on the water.&quot;

Tourism is growing significantly, providing the island with a highly profitable &quot;green&quot; industry. Whale and bird watching, camping and kayaking are popular activities for tourists. Visitors and retirees often purchase real estate and remain on the island through the summer months or reside permanently. Approximately 54% of the island is owned by non-residents. New York architect Michael Zimmer established the Sardine Museum and Herring Hall of Fame.

There are freshwater ponds, lakes and beaches that are prime locations for sunbathing, beachcombing, and picnics. Other interesting finds on Grand Manan are magnetic sand, and &quot;The Hole-In-The Wall&quot; located in Whale Cove in the village of North Head. The Anchorage Provincial Park can be found on the island&#x27;s southeastern coast between the communities of Grand Harbour and Seal Cove.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Grand Manan had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

As of 2016, the racial make-up of the island was 99.17% White; the remainder of the population was mostly Indigenous. Those who were third generation or more made up 89% of the population.

There were 1,045 households, out of which 23% had children under the age of 18 living with them. Of the 700 census families on the island, 71.42% were married couples living together. The average family size was 2.90.

On the island the population is spread out in terms of age, with 25% age 19 or under; 5% from 20 to 24, 27% from 25 to 44, 25.4% from 45 to 64, and 17.1% at 65 years of age or older. The median age was 40.3 years.

The median income for a family was $48,190. Males had a median income of $32,183 versus $23,106 for females. A full 63% of the population 15 years and older had at least a high school certificate or equivalent, with 22% having at least some college, CEGEP, or university training.

==Infrastructure==

===Governance===


The village of Grand Manan includes all of Grand Manan Parish except White Head Island, Machias Seal Island, and some small bodies near them.

The village was formed in 1995 by the amalgamation of the villages of Grand Harbour, North Head, and Seal Cove, along with the local service districts of Castalia, Woodwards Cove, and the parish of Grand Manan.

===Education===

The Anglophone South School District operates the K–12 Grand Manan Community School.

===Health care===

The only medical facility is the Grand Manan Hospital, operated by Horizon Health Network, provides family medicine, emergency medicine and palliative care. The hospital also has an eight-bed inpatient unit. There are onsite diabetes clinics, physiotherapy as well as telemedicine. Diagnostics include x-ray, EKG, and blood and specimen collecting.

===Access and transportation===

Coastal Transport Limited operates the Blacks Harbour to Grand Manan Island Ferry. The crossing is approximately one and one-half hours.

The Grand Manan Island to White Head Island Ferry, serves the 220 residents of White Head Island from Ingalls Head on Grand Manan, with a trip of about half an hour.

Airplane service is available to most destinations in the Maritime region and some destinations in the New England States from the Grand Manan Airport.

New Brunswick Route 776 is the main road on Grand Manan, running on a north–south alignment along the island&#x27;s eastern coast.

<text>Kleve (; traditional ; ; ; ; ; Low Rhenish: &quot;Kleff&quot;) is a town in the Lower Rhine region of northwestern Germany near the Dutch border and the River Rhine. From the 11th century onwards, Cleves was capital of a county and later a duchy. Today, Cleves is the capital of the district of Kleve in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The city is home to one of the campuses of the Rhine-Waal University of Applied Sciences.

== Territory of the municipality ==
In addition to the inner city, the territory of Kleve comprises fourteen villages and populated places:
Bimmen, Brienen, Donsbrüggen, Düffelward, Griethausen, Keeken, Kellen, Materborn, Reichswalde, Rindern, Salmorth, Schenkenschanz, Warbeyen and Wardhausen.

==History==
The name &quot;Kleff&quot; probably derives from Middle Dutch &quot;clef&quot;, &quot;clif&quot; &#x27;cliff, bluff&#x27;, referring to the promontory on which the Schwanenburg castle was constructed. Since the city&#x27;s coat of arms displays three clover leaves (German &quot;Klee&quot;, Low German &quot;Kliev&quot;), the city&#x27;s name is sometimes linked by folk etymology to the clover, but the corresponding Dutch word is &quot;klaver&quot;. 

The Schwanenburg Castle, which was the residence of the Dukes of Cleves, stands on a steep hill. It is located at the northern terminus of the Kermisdahl where it joins with the Spoykanal, which was previously an important transportation link to the Rhine. The old castle has a massive tower, the &quot;Schwanenturm&quot; high, that is associated in legend with the Knight of the Swan, immortalized in Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Lohengrin&quot;.

Medieval Kleve grew together from four parts – the Schwanenburg Castle, the village below the castle, the first city of Kleve on Heideberg Hill, and the &quot;Neustadt&quot; (&quot;New City&quot;), dating from the 14th century. In 1242 Kleve received city rights. The Duchy of Cleves, which roughly covered today&#x27;s districts of Kleve, Wesel and Duisburg, was united with the Duchy of Mark in 1368, was made a duchy itself in 1417, then united with the neighboring duchies of Jülich and Berg in 1521, when John III, Duke of Cleves, married Mary, heiress of Jülich-Berg-Ravenburg.

Kleve&#x27;s most famous native was Anne of Cleves (1515–1557), daughter of John III, Duke of Cleves and (briefly) the fourth wife of Henry VIII of England. Several local businesses are named after her, including the Anne von Kleve Galerie.
The ducal dynasty became extinct in the male line in 1609, leading to a succession crisis in the duchies: the War of the Jülich Succession (1609–1614). After the Thirty Years&#x27; War ended in 1648, the succession dispute was resolved with Cleves passing to the elector of Brandenburg, thus becoming an exclave of the Margraviate of Brandenburg, later Brandenburg-Prussia.

During the Thirty Years&#x27; War the city had been under the control of the Dutch Republic, which in 1647 had given Johann Moritz von Nassau-Siegen administrative control over the city. He approved a renovation of Schwanenburg Castle in the baroque style, constructed a baroque palace, the Prinzenhof, and commissioned the construction of extensive gardens that greatly influenced European landscape design. Significant amounts of his original plan for Kleve were put into effect and have been maintained to the present, a particularly well-loved example of which is the &quot;Forstgarten&quot; (Forest Garden). In 1701, Cleves became part of the Kingdom of Prussia.

During the War of the First Coalition, Cleves was captured by French Revolutionary troops on 19 October 1794. In 1795 it was incorporated into the Roer department, which became part of the Cisrhenian Republic in 1797, which in turn was formally annexed by the French First Republic in 1802, becoming the French First Empire in 1804. Prussia retrieved the city in 1815.
The mineral waters of Kleve and the wooded parkland surrounding it made it a fashionable spa in the 19th century. At this time, Kleve was named &quot;Bad Cleve&quot; (English: Spa of Cleves). It was not until 1935 when the German spelling of its name was officially changed from &quot;Cleve&quot; to &quot;Kleve&quot;.

During World War II Kleve was the site of one of the two radio wave stations that served the Knickebein aircraft navigation system. Luftwaffe bombers used radio beams from Kleve and a second station at Stolberg to navigate to British targets. The Knickebein system was eventually jammed by the British. It was replaced by the higher frequency X-Gerät system, which used transmitter stations located on the channel coast of France.
Kleve was heavily bombed during the Second World War, and over 90% of buildings in the city were severely damaged. During a raid on 7 October 1944 a Halifax bomber crashed into the Schwanenburg Castle. Most of the destruction was the result of a raid late in the war in 1945, conducted at the request of Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks in preparation for Operation Veritable. Horrocks recounted his decision in the 1973 television documentary &quot;The World at War&quot;:
&quot;Then they came to me and they said, &#x27;Do you want the town of Cleves taken out?&#x27; By &#x27;taken out&#x27; they meant the whole of the heavy bombers putting on to Cleves. Now, I knew that Cleves was a very fine old historical German town. Anne of Cleves, one of Henry VIII&#x27;s wives, came from there. I knew that there were a lot of civilians in Cleves, men, women and children. If I said no, they would live. If I said yes, they would die. A terrible decision you’ve got to take. But... everything depended on getting a high piece of ground at Materborn. The German reserves would have to come through Cleves, and we would have to breach the Siegfried Line and get there. And your own lives, your own troops, must come first, so I said yes, I did want it taken out. But when all those bombers went over, the night just before zero hour, to take out Cleves, I felt a murderer. And after the war I had an awful lot of nightmares, but always Cleves.&quot;

Horrocks later said that this had been &quot;the most terrible decision I had ever taken in my life&quot; and that he felt &quot;physically sick&quot; when he saw the bombers overhead.

As a result of the bombing, and subsequent fighting in the town (notably by the 129th Brigade of the 43rd Wessex Division, which entered the town in error on 10 February), relatively little of the pre-1945 city remains. Those structures spared include a number of historic villas built during the heyday of the spa Bad Kleve, located along the B9 near the Tiergarten. Of those buildings destroyed, many were reconstructed, including most of the Schwanenburg and the &quot;Stiftskirche&quot;, the Catholic parish church. Constructed on high ground, many of these landmarks can be seen from the surrounding communities.

Since 1953 there has been a broadcasting facility for FM radio and television from regional broadcaster WDR near Kleve. The current aerial mast was brought into service in 1993. The steel tube mast rises 126.4 metres high and has a diameter of 1.6 metres. It is stabilized by guy wires attached at 57 and 101.6 metres height.

After the Second World War important employers in the area were associated with the West German &quot;Economic Miracle&quot; (&quot;Wirtschaftswunder&quot;), and included the XOX Bisquitfabrik (XOX Biscuit Factory) GmbH and the Van den Berg&#x27;schen Margerinewerke (Van den Berg’s Margarine Factory). Another important employer was the Elefanten-Kinderschuhfabrik (Elephant Children&#x27;s Shoe Factory).

Retail became an increasingly important industry, particularly after the institution of the euro in 2002. Dutch citizens often crossed the open border to patronize Kleves retailers, and much of the euros spent on shopping in Kleve came from the Netherlands. Lower costs of real estate have attracted a wave of Dutch citizens, who purchased houses in the area.

==Demographics==
===Census data===
According to the Statistical Yearbook of Cleves as of 2013, 50,650 people resided in the city. The population density was 517.9 people per square kilometer. 86.7% of the residents had the German citizenship (including residents with dual citizenship) and 10.1% another EU citizenship (5.6% Dutch and 2.9% Polish).
In the city, in 2013, the population was distributed with 19.7% under the age of 21, 25.6% from 21 to 40, 29.7% from 41 to 60, 20.1% from 61 to 80, and 4.9% who were 81 years of age or older. For every 100 females, there were 96.7 males. For every 100 females age 21 and over, there were 93.9 males.

81.3% of the citizens lived in households without children under the age of 18, 9.2% with one child, 6.1% with two children, 1.7% with three children, and 0.1% with four children or more.

===Religion===
Like the rest of the Lower Rhine region, Kleve is a predominantly Roman Catholic city. The city is part of the Diocese of Münster. 61.1% of the residents are Roman Catholics, 14.4% Protestant, and 24.6% &quot;Other&quot;. The largest section of this group are residents without any religious affiliation, but there are also sizeable Russian Orthodox and Muslim communities in Kleve.

The synagogue of Kleve was destroyed during &#x27; and is today commemorated on the &#x27; (Synagogue square) on which the building&#x27;s outline can be seen. The fifty killed Jewish citizens of Cleves are remembered with signs that tell their names, and dates and places of death.

In 1767 the town was at the center of a controversy between prominent European rabbis, known as &quot;The Kleve Divorce&quot;, over the legality of a divorce granted by a groom whose sanity was in doubt.

=== City Council ===
Prior to the Nazi Era, Kleve&#x27;s local politics were dominated by the Catholic Centre Party. This situation continued with the Christian Democratic successor party CDU after the Second World War, in spite of resettled displaced people from eastern Germany, most of them Protestants. Until 2004 the CDU controlled an absolute majority of the city council.

Since the last local elections on 25 May 2020 the following parties are represented in Cleves&#x27; city council. In addition to nationwide parties, &quot;&quot; (Open Cleves) has a number of seats.

The next local elections are scheduled for 2026.

===Mayor===
In 2015, Sonja Northing (no party affiliation) became mayor of Kleve, with 64.5% of the vote. Her candidacy was supported by the SPD and FDP, and opposed by CDU and Green Party candidates. Northing was the first mayor of Cleves since World War I who was not a CDU member. In 2020 Wolfgang Gebing (CDU) was elected mayor.

== Language and dialect ==
The native language of Kleve and much of the Lower Rhine region is a Low Franconian dialect known as Kleverlandish (Dutch: &quot;Kleverlands&quot;, German: &quot;Kleverländisch&quot;), but the official language is Standard High German, which is dominant among the younger generation.

Because of its geographical location at the Dutch-German border, there is a strong overlap in culture and language. One example of this is Govert Flinck (1615–1660), who though born in Kleve established himself as a Dutch artist. On the other hand, the Dutch artist Barend Cornelis Koekkoek (1803–1862) settled in Kleve and became a successful landscape painter. His works are collected by and exhibited in the local museum Haus Koekkoek for his and others&#x27; romantic paintings.

<text>In computational complexity theory, the time hierarchy theorems are important statements about time-bounded computation on Turing machines. Informally, these theorems say that given more time, a Turing machine can solve more problems. For example, there are problems that can be solved with &quot;n&quot;2 time but not &quot;n&quot; time, where &quot;n&quot; is the input length.

The time hierarchy theorem for deterministic multi-tape Turing machines was first proven by Richard E. Stearns and Juris Hartmanis in 1965. It was improved a year later when F. C. Hennie and Richard E. Stearns improved the efficiency of the Universal Turing machine. Consequent to the theorem, for every deterministic time-bounded complexity class, there is a strictly larger time-bounded complexity class, and so the time-bounded hierarchy of complexity classes does not completely collapse. More precisely, the time hierarchy theorem for deterministic Turing machines states that for all time-constructible functions &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;),
:formula_1,
where DTIME(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)) denotes the complexity class of decision problems solvable in time O(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)). The left-hand class involves little o notation, referring to the set of decision problems solvable in asymptotically less than &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) time.

In particular, this shows that formula_2 if and only if formula_3, so we have an infinite time hierarchy.

The time hierarchy theorem for nondeterministic Turing machines was originally proven by Stephen Cook in 1972. It was improved to its current form via a complex proof by Joel Seiferas, Michael Fischer, and Albert Meyer in 1978. Finally in 1983, Stanislav Žák achieved the same result with the simple proof taught today. The time hierarchy theorem for nondeterministic Turing machines states that if &quot;g&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is a time-constructible function, and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;+1) = o(&quot;g&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)), then

:formula_4.

The analogous theorems for space are the space hierarchy theorems. A similar theorem is not known for time-bounded probabilistic complexity classes, unless the class also has one bit of advice.

==Background==
Both theorems use the notion of a time-constructible function. A function formula_5 is time-constructible if there exists a deterministic Turing machine such that for every formula_6, if the machine is started with an input of &quot;n&quot; ones, it will halt after precisely &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) steps. All polynomials with non-negative integer coefficients are time-constructible, as are exponential functions such as 2&quot;n&quot;.

==Proof overview==
We need to prove that some time class TIME(&quot;g&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)) is strictly larger than some time class TIME(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)). We do this by constructing a machine which cannot be in TIME(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)), by diagonalization. We then show that the machine is in TIME(&quot;g&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)), using a simulator machine.

==Deterministic time hierarchy theorem==

===Statement===
Time Hierarchy Theorem. If &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is a time-constructible function, then there exists a decision problem which cannot be solved in worst-case deterministic time &quot;o&quot;(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)) but can be solved in worst-case deterministic time &quot;O&quot;(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)log &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)). Thus
:formula_7

Note 1. &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is at least &quot;n&quot;, since smaller functions are never time-constructible.&lt;br&gt;

Example. There are problems solvable in time &quot;n&quot;log2&quot;n&quot; but not time &quot;n&quot;. This follows by setting formula_8, since &quot;n&quot; is in 
:formula_9

===Proof===
We include here a proof of a weaker result, namely that DTIME(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)) is a strict subset of DTIME(&quot;f&quot;(2&quot;n&quot; + 1)3), as it is simpler but illustrates the proof idea. See the bottom of this section for information on how to extend the proof to &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)log&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;).

To prove this, we first define the language of the encodings of machines and their inputs which cause them to halt within f

: formula_10

Notice here that this is a time-class. It is the set of pairs of machines and inputs to those machines (&quot;M&quot;,&quot;x&quot;) so that the machine &quot;M&quot; accepts within &quot;f&quot;(|&quot;x&quot;|) steps.

Here, &quot;M&quot; is a deterministic Turing machine, and &quot;x&quot; is its input (the initial contents of its tape). [&quot;M&quot;] denotes an input that encodes the Turing machine &quot;M&quot;. Let &quot;m&quot; be the size of the tuple ([&quot;M&quot;], &quot;x&quot;).

We know that we can decide membership of &quot;Hf&quot; by way of a deterministic Turing machine &quot;R&quot;, that simulates &quot;M&quot; for &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) steps by first calculating &quot;f&quot;(|&quot;x&quot;|) and then writing out a row of 0s of that length, and then using this row of 0s as a &quot;clock&quot; or &quot;counter&quot; to simulate &quot;M&quot; for at most that many steps. At each step, the simulating machine needs to look through the definition of &quot;M&quot; to decide what the next action would be. It is safe to say that this takes at most &quot;f&quot;(&quot;m&quot;)3 operations (since it is known that a simulation of a machine of time complexity &quot;T&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) for can be achieved in time formula_11 on a multitape machine, where |&quot;M&quot;| is the length of the encoding of &quot;M&quot;), we have that:

: formula_12

The rest of the proof will show that

: formula_13

so that if we substitute 2&quot;n&quot; + 1 for &quot;m&quot;, we get the desired result. Let us assume that &quot;Hf&quot; is in this time complexity class, and we will reach a contradiction.

If &quot;Hf&quot; is in this time complexity class, then there exists a machine &quot;K&quot; which, given some machine description [&quot;M&quot;] and input &quot;x&quot;, decides whether the tuple ([&quot;M&quot;], &quot;x&quot;) is in &quot;Hf&quot; within

:formula_14

We use this &quot;K&quot; to construct another machine, &quot;N&quot;, which takes a machine description [&quot;M&quot;] and runs &quot;K&quot; on the tuple ([&quot;M&quot;], [&quot;M&quot;]), ie. M is simulated on its own code by &quot;K&quot;, and then &quot;N&quot; accepts if &quot;K&quot; rejects, and rejects if &quot;K&quot; accepts. 
If &quot;n&quot; is the length of the input to &quot;N&quot;, then &quot;m&quot; (the length of the input to &quot;K&quot;) is twice &quot;n&quot; plus some delimiter symbol, so &quot;m&quot; = 2&quot;n&quot; + 1. &quot;N&quot;&#x27;s running time is thus

:formula_15

Now if we feed [&quot;N&quot;] as input into &quot;N&quot; itself (which makes &quot;n&quot; the length of [&quot;N&quot;]) and ask the question whether &quot;N&quot; accepts its own description as input, we get:

* If &quot;N&quot; accepts [&quot;N&quot;] (which we know it does in at most &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) operations since &quot;K&quot; halts on ([&quot;N&quot;], [&quot;N&quot;]) in &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) steps), this means that &quot;K&quot; rejects ([&quot;N&quot;], [&quot;N&quot;]), so ([&quot;N&quot;], [&quot;N&quot;]) is not in &quot;Hf&quot;, and so by the definition of &quot;Hf&quot;, this implies that &quot;N&quot; does not accept [&quot;N&quot;] in &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) steps. Contradiction.

* If &quot;N&quot; rejects [&quot;N&quot;] (which we know it does in at most &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) operations), this means that &quot;K&quot; accepts ([&quot;N&quot;], [&quot;N&quot;]), so ([&quot;N&quot;], [&quot;N&quot;]) is in &quot;Hf&quot;, and thus &quot;N&quot; does accept [&quot;N&quot;] in &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) steps. Contradiction.

We thus conclude that the machine &quot;K&quot; does not exist, and so
: formula_16

===Extension===
The reader may have realised that the proof gives the weaker result because we have chosen a simple Turing machine simulation for which we know that
: formula_17

It is known that a more efficient simulation exists which establishes that
: formula_18.

==Non-deterministic time hierarchy theorem==
If &quot;g&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is a time-constructible function, and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;+1) = o(&quot;g&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)), then there exists a decision problem which cannot be solved in non-deterministic time &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) but can be solved in non-deterministic time &quot;g&quot;(&quot;n&quot;). In other words, the complexity class NTIME(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)) is a strict subset of NTIME(&quot;g&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)).

==Consequences==
The time hierarchy theorems guarantee that the deterministic and non-deterministic versions of the exponential hierarchy are genuine hierarchies: in other words P ⊊ EXPTIME ⊊ 2-EXP ⊊ ... and NP ⊊ NEXPTIME ⊊ 2-NEXP ⊊ ...

For example, formula_19 since formula_20. Indeed, formula_21 from the time hierarchy theorem.

The theorem also guarantees that there are problems in P requiring arbitrarily large exponents to solve; in other words, P does not collapse to DTIME(&quot;n&quot;&quot;k&quot;) for any fixed &quot;k&quot;. For example, there are problems solvable in &quot;n&quot;5000 time but not &quot;n&quot;4999 time. This is one argument against Cobham&#x27;s thesis, the convention that P is a practical class of algorithms. If such a collapse did occur, we could deduce that P ≠ PSPACE, since it is a well-known theorem that DTIME(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)) is strictly contained in DSPACE(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)).

However, the time hierarchy theorems provide no means to relate deterministic and non-deterministic complexity, or time and space complexity, so they cast no light on the great unsolved questions of computational complexity theory: whether P and NP, NP and PSPACE, PSPACE and EXPTIME, or EXPTIME and NEXPTIME are equal or not.

==Sharper hierarchy theorems==
The gap of approximately formula_22 between the lower and upper time bound in the hierarchy theorem can be traced to the efficiency of the device used in the proof, namely a universal program that maintains a step-count. This can be done more efficiently on certain computational models. The sharpest results, presented below, have been proved for:
* The unit-cost random-access machine
* A programming language model whose programs operate on a binary tree that is always accessed via its root. This model, introduced by Neil D. Jones is stronger than a deterministic Turing machine but weaker than a random-access machine.
For these models, the theorem has the following form:
If &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is a time-constructible function, then there exists a decision problem which cannot be solved in worst-case deterministic time &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) but can be solved in worst-case time &quot;af&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) for some constant &quot;a&quot; (dependent on &quot;f&quot;).
Thus, a constant-factor increase in the time bound allows for solving more problems, in contrast with the situation for Turing machines (see Linear speedup theorem). Moreover, Ben-Amram proved that, in the above models, for &quot;f&quot; of polynomial growth rate (but more than linear), it is the case that for all formula_23, there exists a decision problem which cannot be solved in worst-case deterministic time &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) but can be solved in worst-case time formula_24.

<doc id="184121" wikidata="Q16386865" url="?curid=184121" title="The Man from Snowy River (poem)">
<text>&quot;The Man from Snowy River&quot; is a poem by Australian bush poet Banjo Paterson. It was first published in &quot;The Bulletin&quot;, an Australian news magazine, on 26 April 1890, and was published by Angus &amp; Robertson in October 1895, with other poems by Paterson, in &quot;The Man from Snowy River and Other Verses&quot;.

The poem tells the story of a horseback pursuit to recapture the colt of a prizewinning racehorse that escaped from its paddock and is living with the brumbies (wild horses) of the mountain ranges. Eventually the brumbies descend a seemingly impassable steep slope, at which point the assembled riders give up the pursuit, except the young protagonist, who spurs his &quot;pony&quot; (small horse) down the &quot;terrible descent&quot; and catches the mob.

Two characters mentioned in the early part of the poem are featured in previous Paterson poems: &quot;Clancy of the Overflow&quot; and Harrison from &quot;Old Pardon, Son of Reprieve&quot;.

==Setting of the poem==

It is recorded in the selected works of &quot;Banjo&quot; Paterson that the location of the ride fictionalised in the poem was in the region of today&#x27;s Burrinjuck Dam, north-west of Canberra in Australian Capital Territory. Paterson had helped round up brumbies as a child and later owned property in this region.

The Snowy River, from where &quot;the Man&quot; comes, has its headwaters in the Snowy Mountains, the highest section of the Great Dividing Range near the easternmost part of the border between New South Wales and Victoria. The ride does not take place in the Snowy River region because, within the poem, Clancy describes to the other men the country from where &quot;the man from Snowy River&quot; comes.

==&quot;The Man&quot;==
Corryong, a small town on the western side of the range, claims stockman Jack Riley (1841–1914) as the inspiration for the character, and like many other towns in the region uses the image of the character as part of the marketing to tourists. Riley was a hermit stockman employed by John Pierce of Greg Greg Station at Corryong to run cattle at &quot;Tom Groggin&quot; 60 km upriver from Khancoban, New South Wales. Paterson is said (by Corryong legend) to have met Riley on at least two occasions.

The inspiration for &quot;The Man&quot; was claimed by Banjo himself to be not one person but a number of people, one of which was Owen Cummins. Cummins was born to Michael Cummins of Duniry, Ireland - The family emigrated to Melbourne to settle in Dargo. Owen was well known for being a great horseman. He worked around the area before making his way up to Wave Hill, Northern Territory, where a monument has been erected to reflect his role in inspiring the poem. Owen Cummins is also recognised in the Stockmen&#x27;s Hall of Fame in Longreach.

There is a possibility that another exceptional and fearless rider, Charlie McKeahnie, was the inspiration for the poem. In 1885, when McKeahnie was only 17 years of age, he performed a dangerous riding feat in the Snowy River region. Historian Neville Locker supports this theory, adding that a prior poem had been written about McKeahnie by bush poet Barcroft Boake and that the story had been recounted by a Mrs Hassle to a crowd that included Paterson. Locker also offers as evidence a letter by McKeahnie&#x27;s sister that discusses the ride and Paterson&#x27;s hearing of the ride. McKeahnie was killed in a riding accident near Bredbo in 1895 and is buried in the Old Adaminaby cemetery, on the shores of Lake Eucumbene.

Other historians point to the claims of Jim Troy, who died aged 33. Troy was related by marriage to Thomas McNamara, said to be “Clancy”, subject of another famous Paterson poem, Clancy of the Overflow.
“Clancy” also had a second claim to absolute knowledge of the “man” having been included in the Snowy River poem as “no better horseman ever held the reins”.
McNamara gave an interview to the Brisbane Courier-Mail newspaper in 1938 in which he recalled the actual details of that terrific chase in the hills beside Wagga Wagga.

Another possibility is J.R. Battye from Walgett. In a report
 in the papers in 1877, likely to have been seen by Paterson, Battye while Brumby shooting spurs his horse on when it slips its bridle and, powerless over the animal&#x27;s actions trusts it to follow the wild ones, which it does, catching them after several miles through country thickly timbered and full of holes.

==Historical context of the poem==
The poem was written at a time in the 1880s and 1890s when Australia was developing a distinct identity as a nation. Though Australia was still a set of self-governing colonies under the final authority of Britain, and had not yet trod the path of nationhood, there was a distinct feeling that Australians needed to be united and become as one. Australians from all walks of life, be they from the country or the city (see &quot;Clancy of the Overflow&quot;), looked to the bush for their mythology and heroic characters. They saw in the Man from Snowy River a hero whose bravery, adaptability and risk-taking could epitomise a new nation in the south. This new nation emerged as the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901.

<doc id="184136" wikidata="Q134549" url="?curid=184136" title="Ted Kennedy">
<text>Edward Moore Kennedy (February 22, 1932 – August 25, 2009) was an American lawyer and politician from Massachusetts who served as a member of the United States Senate from 1962 to his death in 2009. A member of the Democratic Party and the prominent Kennedy family, he was the second-most senior member of the Senate when he died. He is ranked fifth in U.S. history for length of continuous service as a senator. Kennedy was the younger brother of President John F. Kennedy and U.S. attorney general and U.S. senator Robert F. Kennedy, and the father of U.S. representative Patrick J. Kennedy.

After attending Harvard University and earning his law degree from the University of Virginia, Kennedy began his career as an assistant district attorney in Suffolk County, Massachusetts. He won a November 1962 special election in Massachusetts to fill the vacant seat previously held by his brother John, who had taken office as the U.S. president. He was elected to a full six-year term in 1964 and was re-elected seven more times. The Chappaquiddick incident in 1969 resulted in the death of his automobile passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne. He pleaded guilty to a charge of leaving the scene of an accident and received a two-month suspended sentence. The incident and its aftermath hindered his chances of becoming president. He ran in 1980 in the Democratic primary campaign for the party&#x27;s nomination, but lost to the incumbent president, Jimmy Carter.

Kennedy was known for his oratorical skills. His 1968 eulogy for his brother Robert and his 1980 rallying cry for modern American liberalism were among his best-known speeches. He became recognized as &quot;The Lion of the Senate&quot; through his long tenure and influence. Kennedy and his staff wrote more than 300 bills that were enacted into law. Unabashedly liberal, Kennedy championed an interventionist government that emphasized economic and social justice, but he was also known for working with Republicans to find compromises. Kennedy played a major role in passing many laws, including the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, the National Cancer Act of 1971, the COBRA health insurance provision, the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Ryan White AIDS Care Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the Mental Health Parity Act, the S-CHIP children&#x27;s health program, the No Child Left Behind Act, and the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act. During the 2000s, he led several unsuccessful immigration reform efforts. Over the course of his Senate career, Kennedy made efforts to enact universal health care, which he called the &quot;cause of my life&quot;. By his later years, Kennedy had come to be viewed as a major figure and spokesman for American progressivism.

On August 25, 2009, Kennedy died of a brain tumor (glioblastoma) at his home in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, at the age of 77. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

==Early life==
Kennedy was born on February 22, 1932, at St. Margaret&#x27;s Hospital in the Dorchester section of Boston, Massachusetts. He was the youngest of the nine children of Joseph Patrick Kennedy and Rose Fitzgerald, members of prominent Irish American families in Boston. They constituted one of the wealthiest families in the nation after their marriage. His eight siblings were Joseph Jr., John, Rosemary, Kathleen, Eunice, Patricia, Robert, and Jean. His older brother John asked to be the newborn&#x27;s godfather, a request his parents honored, though they did not agree to his request to name the baby George Washington Kennedy (Ted was born on President George Washington&#x27;s 200th birthday). They named the boy after their father&#x27;s assistant.

As a child, Ted was frequently uprooted by his family&#x27;s moves among Bronxville, New York; Hyannis Port, Massachusetts; Palm Beach, Florida; and the Court of St. James&#x27;s, in London, England. His formal education started at Gibbs School in Kensington, London. He had attended 10 schools by the age of eleven; these disruptions interfered with his academic success. He was an altar boy at the St. Joseph&#x27;s Church and was seven when he received his First Communion from Pope Pius XII in the Vatican. He spent sixth and seventh grades at the Fessenden School, where he was a mediocre student, and eighth grade at Cranwell Preparatory School, both in Massachusetts. He was the youngest child and his parents were affectionate toward him, but they also compared him unfavorably with his older brothers.

Between the ages of eight and sixteen, Ted suffered the traumas of his sister Rosemary&#x27;s failed lobotomy and the deaths of two siblings: Joseph Jr. in an airplane explosion and Kathleen in an airplane crash. Ted&#x27;s affable maternal grandfather, John F. Fitzgerald, was the Mayor of Boston, a U.S. Congressman, and an early political and personal influence. Ted spent his four high-school years at Milton Academy, a preparatory school in Milton, Massachusetts, where he received B and C grades. In 1950, he finished 36th in a graduating class of 56. He did well at football there, playing on the varsity in his last two years; the school&#x27;s headmaster later described his play as &quot;absolutely fearless ... he would have tackled an express train to New York if you asked ... he loved contact sports&quot;. Kennedy also played on the tennis team and was in the drama, debate, and glee clubs.

==College, military service, and law school==
Like his father and brothers before him, Ted graduated from Harvard College. In his spring semester, he was assigned to the athlete-oriented Winthrop House, where his brothers had also lived. He was an offensive and defensive end on the freshman football team; his play was characterized by his large size and fearless style. In his first semester, Kennedy and his classmates arranged to copy answers from another student during the final examination for a science class. At the end of his second semester in May 1951, Kennedy was anxious about maintaining his eligibility for athletics for the next year, and he had a classmate take his place at a Spanish exam. The ruse was discovered and both were expelled for cheating. As was standard for serious disciplinary cases, they were told they could apply for readmission within a year or two if they demonstrated good behavior during that time.

In June 1951, Kennedy enlisted in the United States Army and signed up for an optional four-year term that was shortened to the minimum of two years after his father intervened. Following basic training at Fort Dix in New Jersey, he requested assignment to Fort Holabird in Maryland for Army Intelligence training, but was dropped without explanation after a few weeks. He went to Camp Gordon in Georgia for training in the Military Police Corps. In June 1952, Kennedy was assigned to the honor guard at SHAPE headquarters in Paris, France. His father&#x27;s political connections ensured that he was not deployed to the ongoing Korean War. While stationed in Europe, Kennedy traveled extensively on weekends and climbed the Matterhorn in the Pennine Alps. After 21 months, he was discharged in March 1953 as a private first class.

Kennedy re-entered Harvard in the summer of 1953 and improved his study habits. His brother John was a U.S. Senator and the family was attracting more public attention. Ted joined The Owl final club in 1954 and was also chosen for the Hasty Pudding Club and the Pi Eta fraternity. Kennedy was on athletic probation during his sophomore year, and he returned as a second-string two-way end for the Crimson football team during his junior year. He barely missed earning his varsity letter. Green Bay Packers head coach Lisle Blackbourn asked him about his interest in playing professional football. Kennedy demurred, saying he had plans to attend law school and &quot;go into another contact sport, politics.&quot; In his senior season of 1955, Kennedy started at end for the Harvard football team and worked hard to improve his blocking and tackling to complement his , size. In the season-ending Harvard-Yale game in the snow at the Yale Bowl on November 19 (which Yale won 21–7), Kennedy caught a pass to score Harvard&#x27;s only touchdown; the team finished the season with a 3–4–1 record. Academically, Kennedy received mediocre grades for his first three years, improved to a B average for his senior year, and finished barely in the top half of his class. Kennedy graduated from Harvard at age 24 in 1956 with an AB in history and government.

Due to his low grades, Kennedy was not accepted by Harvard Law School. He instead followed his brother Bobby and enrolled in the University of Virginia School of Law in 1956. That acceptance was controversial among faculty and alumni, who judged Kennedy&#x27;s past cheating episodes to be incompatible with the University of Virginia&#x27;s honor code; it took a full faculty vote to admit him. Kennedy also attended The Hague Academy of International Law during one summer. At Virginia, Kennedy felt that he had to study &quot;four times as hard and four times as long&quot; as other students to keep up. He received mostly C grades and was in the middle of the class ranking, but won the prestigious William Minor Lile Moot Court Competition. He was elected head of the Student Legal Forum and brought many prominent speakers to the campus via his family connections. While there, his questionable automotive practices were curtailed when he was charged with reckless driving and driving without a license. He was officially named as manager of his brother John&#x27;s 1958 Senate re-election campaign; Ted&#x27;s ability to connect with ordinary voters on the street helped bring a record-setting victory margin that gave credibility to John&#x27;s presidential aspirations. Ted graduated from law school in 1959.

==Family and early career==

In October 1957 (early in his second year of law school), Kennedy met Joan Bennett at Manhattanville College; they were introduced after a dedication speech for a gymnasium that his family had donated at the campus. Bennett was a senior at Manhattanville and had worked as a model and won beauty contests, but she was unfamiliar with politics. After the couple became engaged, she grew nervous about marrying someone she did not know that well, but Joe Kennedy insisted that the wedding should proceed. The couple was married by Cardinal Francis Spellman on November 29, 1958, at St. Joseph&#x27;s Church in Bronxville, New York, with the reception being held at the nearby Siwanoy Country Club. Ted and Joan had three children: Kara (1960–2011), Ted Jr. (b. 1961) and Patrick (b. 1967). By the 1970s, the marriage was in trouble due to Ted&#x27;s infidelity and Joan&#x27;s growing alcoholism.

Ted and Joan established Massachusetts residency after buying a townhouse on Charles River Square in Boston, and a home on Squaw Island, Cape Cod. During Ted&#x27;s tenure in the U.S. Senate, the Kennedys lived in a townhouse in Georgetown, Washington, D.C., and later, a 12,500-square-foot house in McLean, Virginia. From 1982 until his death in 2009, the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts became Ted&#x27;s principal residence.

In 1959, Kennedy was admitted to the Massachusetts Bar. In 1960, his brother John announced his candidacy for President of the United States and Ted managed his campaign in the Western states. Ted learned to fly and during the Democratic primary campaign he barnstormed around the western states, meeting with delegates and bonding with them by trying his hand at ski jumping and bronc riding. The seven weeks he spent in Wisconsin helped his brother win the first contested primary of the season there and a similar time spent in Wyoming was rewarded when a unanimous vote from that state&#x27;s delegates put his brother over the top at the 1960 Democratic National Convention.

Following his victory in the presidential election, John resigned from his seat as U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, but Ted was not eligible to fill the vacancy until his thirtieth birthday on February 22, 1962. Ted initially wanted to stay out west rather than run for office right away; he said, &quot;The disadvantage of my position is being constantly compared with two brothers of such superior ability.&quot; Ted&#x27;s brothers were not in favor of his running immediately, but Ted ultimately coveted the Senate seat as an accomplishment to match his brothers, and their father overruled them. John asked Massachusetts Governor Foster Furcolo to name Kennedy family friend Ben Smith as interim senator for John&#x27;s unexpired term, which he did in December 1960. This kept the seat available for Ted.

Meanwhile, Ted started work in February 1961 as an assistant district attorney at the Suffolk County, Massachusetts District Attorney&#x27;s Office (for which he took a nominal $1 salary), where he developed a hard-nosed attitude towards crime. He took many overseas trips, billed as fact-finding tours with the goal of improving his foreign policy credentials. On a nine-nation Latin American trip in 1961, FBI reports from the time showed Kennedy meeting with Lauchlin Currie, an alleged former Soviet spy, together with locals in each country whom the reports deemed left-wingers and Communist sympathizers. Reports from the FBI and other sources had Kennedy renting a brothel and opening up bordellos after hours during the tour. The Latin American trip helped to formulate Kennedy&#x27;s foreign policy views, and in subsequent &quot;Boston Globe&quot; columns he warned that the region might turn to communism if the U.S. did not reach out to it in a more effective way. Kennedy also began speaking to local political organizations.

In the 1962 U.S. Senate special election in Massachusetts, Kennedy initially faced a Democratic Party primary challenge from Edward J. McCormack Jr., the state Attorney General. Kennedy&#x27;s slogan was &quot;He can do more for Massachusetts&quot;, the same one John had used in his first campaign for the seat ten years earlier. McCormack had the support of many liberals and intellectuals, who thought Kennedy inexperienced and knew of his suspension from Harvard, a fact which became public during the race. Kennedy also faced the notion that with one brother President and another U.S. Attorney General, &quot;Don&#x27;t you think that Teddy is one Kennedy too many?&quot; But Kennedy proved to be an effective street-level campaigner. His charm was such that one delegate at the party convention said &quot;He&#x27;s completely unqualified and inexperienced. And I&#x27;m going to be with him&quot;. In a televised debate, McCormack said &quot;The office of United States Senator should be merited, and not inherited&quot;, and said that if his opponent&#x27;s name was Edward Moore, not Edward Moore Kennedy, his candidacy &quot;would be a joke&quot;. Voters thought McCormack was overbearing—a Kennedy supporter said &quot;McCormack was able to make a millionaire an underdog&quot;—and with the family political machine&#x27;s finally getting fully behind him, Kennedy won the September 1962 primary by a two-to-one margin. In the November special election, Kennedy defeated Republican George Cabot Lodge II, product of another noted Massachusetts political family, gaining 55 percent of the vote.

==United States Senator==

===First years, brothers&#x27; assassinations===
Kennedy was sworn into the Senate on November 7, 1962. He maintained a deferential attitude towards the senior Southern members when he first entered the Senate, avoiding publicity and focusing on committee work and local issues. He lacked his brother John&#x27;s sophistication and Robert&#x27;s intense, sometimes grating drive, but was more affable than either. He was favored by Senator James Eastland, chair of the powerful Judiciary Committee. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, despite his feuds with John and Robert, liked Ted and told close aides that he &quot;had the potential to be the best politician in the whole family.&quot;
On November 22, 1963, Kennedy was presiding over the Senate—a task given to junior members—when an aide rushed in to tell him that his brother, President Kennedy, had been shot. His brother Robert soon told him that the President was dead. Ted and his sister Eunice immediately flew to the family home in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, to give the news to their invalid father, who had had a stroke two years earlier.

On June 19, 1964, Kennedy was a passenger in a private Aero Commander 680 airplane that was flying in bad weather from Washington, D.C. to Massachusetts. The plane crashed into an apple orchard in Southampton, Massachusetts, on final approach to the Barnes Municipal Airport in Westfield. The pilot and Edward Moss (one of Kennedy&#x27;s aides) were killed. Kennedy was pulled from the wreckage by fellow Senator Birch Bayh, and spent months in hospital recovering from a severe back injury, a punctured lung, broken ribs and internal bleeding. He suffered chronic back pain for the rest of his life. Kennedy took advantage of his long convalescence to meet with academics and study issues more closely, and the hospital experience triggered his lifelong interest in the provision of health care. His wife Joan did the campaigning for him in the regular 1964 U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts, and he defeated his Republican opponent by a three-to-one margin.

Kennedy was walking with a cane when he returned to the Senate in January 1965. He employed a stronger and more effective legislative staff. He took on President Lyndon B. Johnson and almost succeeded in amending the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to explicitly ban the poll tax at the state and local level (rather than just directing the Attorney General to challenge its constitutionality there), gaining a reputation for legislative skill. He was a leader in pushing through the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which ended a quota system based upon national origin. He also played a role in the creation of the National Teachers Corps.

Kennedy initially said he had &quot;no reservations&quot; about the expanding U.S. role in the Vietnam War and acknowledged that it would be a &quot;long and enduring struggle&quot;. Kennedy held hearings on the plight of refugees in the conflict, which revealed that the U.S. government had no coherent policy for refugees. Kennedy also tried to reform &quot;unfair&quot; and &quot;inequitable&quot; aspects of conscription. By the time of a January 1968 trip to Vietnam, Kennedy was disillusioned by the lack of U.S. progress, and suggested publicly that the U.S. should tell South Vietnam, &quot;Shape up or we&#x27;re going to ship out.&quot;

Ted initially advised his brother Robert against challenging the incumbent President Johnson for the Democratic nomination in the 1968 presidential election. Once Senator Eugene McCarthy&#x27;s strong showing in the New Hampshire primary led to Robert&#x27;s presidential campaign starting in March 1968, Ted recruited political leaders for endorsements to his brother in the western states. Ted was in San Francisco when his brother Robert won the crucial California primary on June 4, 1968, and then after midnight, Robert was shot in Los Angeles and died a day later. Ted Kennedy was devastated by his brother&#x27;s death, as he was closest to Robert among those in the Kennedy family. Kennedy aide Frank Mankiewicz said of seeing Ted at the hospital where Robert lay mortally wounded: &quot;I have never, ever, nor do I expect ever, to see a face more in grief.&quot; At Robert&#x27;s funeral at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Kennedy eulogized his older brother:

At the chaotic August 1968 Democratic National Convention, Mayor of Chicago Richard J. Daley and some other party factions feared that Hubert Humphrey could not unite the party, and so encouraged Ted Kennedy to make himself available for a draft. The 36-year-old Kennedy was seen as the natural heir to his brothers, and &quot;Draft Ted&quot; movements sprang up from various quarters and among delegates. Thinking that he was only being seen as a stand-in for his brother and that he was not ready for the job himself, and getting an uncertain reaction from McCarthy and a negative one from Southern delegates, Kennedy rejected any move to place his name before the convention as a candidate. He also declined consideration for the vice-presidential spot. Senator George McGovern remained the symbolic standard-bearer for Robert&#x27;s delegates instead.

After the deaths of his brothers, Kennedy took on the role of a surrogate father for their children. By some reports, he also negotiated the October 1968 marital contract between Jacqueline Kennedy and Aristotle Onassis.

Following Republican Richard Nixon&#x27;s victory in November, Kennedy was widely assumed to be the front-runner for the 1972 Democratic nomination.
In January 1969, Kennedy defeated Louisiana Senator Russell B. Long by a 31–26 margin to become Senate Majority Whip, the youngest person to attain that position. While this further boosted his presidential image, he appeared conflicted by the inevitability of having to run for the position; &quot;Few who knew him doubted that in one sense he very much wanted to take that path&quot;, &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported, but &quot;he had a fatalistic, almost doomed feeling about the prospect&quot;. The reluctance was in part due to the danger; Kennedy reportedly observed, &quot;I know that I&#x27;m going to get my ass shot off one day, and I don&#x27;t want to.&quot; Indeed, there were regular death threats made against Kennedy for much of the rest of his career.

===Chappaquiddick incident===

On the night of July 18, 1969, Kennedy was at Chappaquiddick Island hosting a party for the Boiler Room Girls, a group of young women who had worked on his brother Robert&#x27;s presidential campaign. Kennedy left the party with one of the women, 28-year-old Mary Jo Kopechne.

Driving a 1967 Oldsmobile Delmont 88, he attempted to cross the Dike Bridge, which did not have a guardrail at that time. Kennedy lost control and crashed in the Poucha Pond inlet, a tidal channel. Kennedy escaped from the overturned vehicle, and, by his description, dove below the surface seven or eight times, vainly attempting to rescue Kopechne. Ultimately, he swam to shore and left the scene, with Kopechne still trapped inside the vehicle. Kennedy did not report the accident to authorities until the next morning, by which time Kopechne&#x27;s body had already been discovered. Kennedy&#x27;s cousin Joe Gargan later said that he and Kennedy&#x27;s friend Paul Markham, both of whom were at the party and came to the scene, had urged Kennedy to report it at the time.

A week after the incident, Kennedy pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an accident and was given a suspended sentence of two months in jail. That night, he gave a national broadcast in which he said, &quot;I regard as indefensible the fact that I did not report the accident to the police immediately,&quot; but he denied driving under the influence of alcohol and also denied any immoral conduct between him and Kopechne. Kennedy asked the Massachusetts electorate whether he should stay in office or resign; after getting a favorable response in messages sent to him, Kennedy announced on July 30 that he would remain in the Senate and run for re-election the next year.

In January 1970, an inquest into Kopechne&#x27;s death was held in Edgartown, Massachusetts. At the request of Kennedy&#x27;s lawyers, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ordered the inquest to be conducted in secret. The presiding judge, James A. Boyle, concluded that some aspects of Kennedy&#x27;s story of that night were not true, and that negligent driving &quot;appears to have contributed&quot; to the death of Kopechne. A grand jury conducted a two-day investigation in April 1970 but issued no indictment, after which Boyle made his inquest report public. Kennedy deemed its conclusions &quot;not justified.&quot; Questions about the incident generated many articles and books during the following years.

===1970s===

At the end of 1968, Kennedy had joined the new Committee for National Health Insurance at the invitation of its founder, United Auto Workers president Walter Reuther. In May 1970, Reuther died and Senator Ralph Yarborough, chairman of the full Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee and its Health subcommittee, lost his primary election, propelling Kennedy into a leadership role on the issue of national health insurance. Kennedy introduced a bipartisan bill in August 1970 for single-payer universal national health insurance with no cost sharing, paid for by payroll taxes and general federal revenue.

Despite the Chappaquiddick controversy of the previous year, Kennedy easily won re-election to the Senate in November 1970 with 62 percent of the vote against underfunded Republican candidate Josiah Spaulding, although he received about 500,000 fewer votes than in 1964.
In January 1971, Kennedy lost his position as Senate Majority Whip to Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, 31–24, probably because of Chappaquiddick. He later told Byrd that the defeat had allowed Kennedy to focus more on issues and committee work, where he could exert influence independently from the Democratic party apparatus. Kennedy began a decade as chairman of the Subcommittee on Health and Scientific Research of the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee.

In February 1971, Nixon proposed health insurance reform—an employer mandate to offer private health insurance if employees volunteered to pay 25 percent of premiums, federalization of Medicaid for the poor with dependent minor children, and support for health maintenance organizations. Hearings on national health insurance were held in 1971, but no bill had the support of House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committee chairmen Representative Wilbur Mills and Senator Russell Long. Kennedy sponsored and helped pass the limited Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973. He also played a leading role, with Senator Jacob Javits, in the creation and passage of the National Cancer Act of 1971.

In October 1971, Kennedy made his first speech about The Troubles in Northern Ireland: he said that &quot;Ulster is becoming Britain&#x27;s Vietnam&quot;, advocating for the withdrawal of British troops from the six northern counties, called for a united Ireland, and declared that Ulster Unionists who could not accept this &quot;should be given a decent opportunity to go back to Britain&quot; (a position he backed away from within a couple of years). Kennedy was sharply criticised by the British and Ulster unionists, and he formed a long political relationship with Social Democratic and Labour Party founder John Hume. In scores of anti-war speeches, Kennedy opposed Nixon&#x27;s policy of Vietnamization, calling it &quot;a policy of violence [that] means more and more war&quot;. In December 1971, Kennedy strongly criticized the Nixon administration&#x27;s support for Pakistan and its ignoring of &quot;the brutal and systematic repression of East Bengal by the Pakistani army&quot;. He traveled to India and wrote a report on the plight of the 10 million Bengali refugees. In February 1972, Kennedy flew to Bangladesh and delivered a speech at the University of Dhaka, where a killing rampage had begun a year earlier.

The Chappaquiddick incident had greatly hindered Kennedy&#x27;s future presidential prospects, and shortly after the incident he declared that he would not be a candidate in the 1972 U.S. presidential election. Nevertheless, polls in 1971 suggested he could win the nomination if he tried, and Kennedy gave some thought to running. In May of that year he decided not to, saying he needed &quot;breathing time&quot; to gain more experience and to take care of the children of his brothers, and that &quot;it feels wrong in my gut.&quot; Nevertheless, in November 1971, a Gallup Poll still had him in first place in the Democratic nomination race with 28 percent. George McGovern was close to clinching the Democratic nomination in June 1972, when various anti-McGovern forces tried to get Kennedy to enter the contest at the last minute, but he declined. At the 1972 Democratic National Convention, McGovern repeatedly tried to recruit Kennedy as his vice presidential running mate, but Kennedy turned him down. When McGovern&#x27;s choice of Thomas Eagleton stepped down soon after the convention, McGovern again tried to get Kennedy to take the nod, again without success. McGovern instead chose Kennedy&#x27;s brother-in-law Sargent Shriver.

In 1973, Kennedy&#x27;s 12-year-old son Edward Kennedy Jr., was diagnosed with bone cancer; his leg was amputated and he underwent a long, difficult, experimental two-year drug treatment. The case brought international attention among doctors and in the media, as did the young Kennedy&#x27;s return to skiing half a year later. Son Patrick was suffering from severe asthma attacks. The pressure of the situation mounted on Joan Kennedy. On several occasions, she entered facilities for treatment of alcoholism and emotional strain, and she was arrested for drunk driving after a traffic accident.

In February 1974, Nixon proposed more comprehensive health insurance reform—an employer mandate to offer private health insurance if employees volunteered to pay 25 percent of premiums, replacement of Medicaid by state-run health insurance plans available to all with income-based premiums and cost sharing, and replacement of Medicare with a new federal program that eliminated the limit on hospital days, added income-based out-of-pocket limits, and added outpatient prescription drug coverage. In April 1974, Kennedy and Mills introduced a bill for near-universal national health insurance with benefits identical to the expanded Nixon plan—but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through payroll taxes—both plans were criticized by labor, consumer, and senior citizen organizations because of their substantial cost sharing. In August 1974, after Nixon&#x27;s resignation and President Ford&#x27;s call for health insurance reform, Mills tried to advance a compromise based on Nixon&#x27;s plan—but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through premiums to private health insurance companies—but gave up when unable to get more than a 13–12 majority of his committee to support his compromise plan.

In the wake of the Watergate scandal, Kennedy pushed campaign finance reform; he was a leading force behind passage of the Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments of 1974, which set contribution limits and established public financing for presidential elections. In April 1974, Kennedy travelled to the Soviet Union, where he met with leader Leonid Brezhnev and advocated a full nuclear test ban as well as relaxed emigration, gave a speech at Moscow State University, met with Soviet dissidents, and secured an exit visa for cellist Mstislav Rostropovich. Kennedy&#x27;s Subcommittee on Refugees and Escapees continued to focus on Vietnam, especially after the Fall of Saigon in 1975.

Kennedy had initially opposed busing schoolchildren across racial lines, but grew to support the practice as it became a focal point of civil rights efforts. After federal judge W. Arthur Garrity ordered the Boston School Committee in 1974 to racially integrate Boston&#x27;s public schools via busing, Kennedy made a surprise appearance at a September 1974 anti-busing rally in City Hall Plaza to express the need for peaceful dialogue and was met with extreme hostility. The predominantly white crowd yelled insults about his children and hurled tomatoes and eggs at him as he retreated into the John F. Kennedy Federal Building and went so far as to break one of its glass walls.

Kennedy was again much talked about as a contender in the 1976 U.S. presidential election, with no strong front-runners among the other possible Democratic candidates. Kennedy&#x27;s concerns about his family were strong, and Chappaquiddick was still in the news, with &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, and &quot;Time&quot; magazine all reassessing the incident and raising doubts about Kennedy&#x27;s version of events. (The &quot;Times&quot; would in 1977 describe Chappaquiddick as Kennedy&#x27;s Watergate.) In September 1974, Kennedy announced that for family reasons he would not run in the 1976 election, declaring that his decision was &quot;firm, final, and unconditional.&quot; Kennedy was up for Senate re-election in 1976. He defeated a primary challenger who was angry at his support for school busing in Boston. Kennedy won the general election with 69 percent of the vote.
The Carter administration years were difficult for Kennedy; he had been the most important Democrat in Washington ever since his brother Robert&#x27;s death, but now Carter was, and Kennedy at first did not have a full committee chairmanship with which to wield influence. Carter in turn sometimes resented Kennedy&#x27;s status as a political celebrity. Despite generally similar ideologies, their priorities were different. Kennedy told reporters that he was content with his congressional role and denied presidential ambitions, but by late 1977 Carter reportedly saw Kennedy as a future challenger to his presidency.

Kennedy and his wife Joan separated in 1977, although they still staged some joint appearances. He held Health and Scientific Research Subcommittee hearings in March 1977 that led to public revelations of extensive scientific misconduct by contract research organizations, including Industrial Bio-Test Laboratories. Kennedy visited China on a goodwill mission in late December 1977, meeting with leader Deng Xiaoping and eventually gaining permission for a number of Mainland Chinese nationals to leave the country; in 1978, he also visited the Soviet Union and Brezhnev and dissidents there again. During the 1970s, Kennedy also showed interest in nuclear disarmament, and as part of his efforts in this field even visited Hiroshima in January 1978 and gave a public speech to that effect at Hiroshima University. He became chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1978, by which time he had amassed a wide-ranging Senate staff of a hundred.

As a candidate, Carter had proposed health care reform that included key features of Kennedy&#x27;s national health insurance bill, but in December 1977, President Carter told Kennedy his bill must preserve a large role for private insurance companies, minimize federal spending (precluding payroll tax financing), and be phased-in to not interfere with Carter&#x27;s paramount domestic policy objective—balancing the federal budget. Kennedy and labor compromised and made the requested changes, but broke with Carter in July 1978 when he would not commit to pursuing a single bill with a fixed schedule for phasing-in comprehensive coverage. Frustrated by Carter&#x27;s budgetary concerns and political caution, in a December 1978 speech on national health insurance at the Democratic midterm convention, Kennedy said regarding liberal goals that &quot;sometimes a party must sail against the wind&quot; and in particular should provide health care as &quot;a basic right for all, not just an expensive privilege for the few.&quot;
In May 1979, Kennedy proposed a new bipartisan universal national health insurance bill—choice of competing federally regulated private health insurance plans with no cost sharing financed by income-based premiums via an employer mandate and individual mandate, replacement of Medicaid by government payment of premiums to private insurers, and enhancement of Medicare by adding prescription drug coverage and eliminating premiums and cost sharing. In June 1979, Carter proposed more limited health insurance reform—an employer mandate to provide catastrophic private health insurance plus coverage without cost sharing for pregnant women and infants, federalization of Medicaid with extension to all of the very poor, and adding catastrophic coverage to Medicare. Neither plan gained any traction in Congress, and the failure to come to agreement represented the final political breach between the two. (Carter wrote in 1982 that Kennedy &quot;ironically&quot; thwarted Carter&#x27;s efforts to provide a comprehensive health-care system for the country. In turn, Kennedy wrote in 2009 that his relationship with Carter was &quot;unhealthy&quot; and that &quot;President Carter was a difficult man to convince – of anything.&quot;)

===1980 presidential campaign===

Kennedy decided to seek the Democratic nomination in the 1980 presidential election by launching an unusual, insurgent campaign against the incumbent Carter. A midsummer 1978 poll showed that Democrats preferred Kennedy over Carter by a 5-to-3 margin. Through summer 1979, as Kennedy deliberated whether to run, Carter was not intimidated despite his 28 percent approval rating, saying publicly: &quot;If Kennedy runs, I&#x27;ll whip his ass.&quot; Carter later asserted that Kennedy&#x27;s constant criticism of his policies was a strong indicator that Kennedy was planning to run for the presidency. Labor unions urged Kennedy to run, as did some Democratic party officials who feared that Carter&#x27;s unpopularity could result in heavy losses in the 1980 congressional elections. Kennedy decided to run in August 1979, when polls showed him with a 2-to-1 advantage over Carter; Carter&#x27;s approval rating slipped to 19 percent. Kennedy formally announced his campaign on November 7, 1979, at Boston&#x27;s Faneuil Hall. He had already received substantial negative press from a rambling response to the question &quot;Why do you want to be President?&quot; during an interview with Roger Mudd of CBS News broadcast a few days earlier. The Iranian hostage crisis, which began on November 4, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, which began on December 27, prompted the electorate to rally around the president and allowed Carter to pursue a Rose Garden strategy of staying at the White House, which kept Kennedy&#x27;s campaign out of the headlines.

Kennedy&#x27;s campaign staff was disorganized and he was initially an ineffective campaigner. There is little evidence that Kennedy truly wanted to be president; to observers such as Ellen Goodman and Anthony Lewis, the Mudd interview confirmed their belief that he did not want the job. The incoherent answer to Mudd was an example of what Walter Mondale, who knew Kennedy well from the Senate, described as his way of avoiding a topic by &quot;using words, but they didn&#x27;t come together somehow&quot;. Chris Whipple of &quot;Life&quot;, who was present for the Mudd interview, wondered if Kennedy&#x27;s answer was &quot;consciously or otherwise, an act of political self-destruction ... The campaign was over. His heart just wasn&#x27;t in it&quot;. The Chappaquiddick incident emerged as a more significant issue than the staff had expected, with several newspaper columnists and editorials criticizing Kennedy&#x27;s answers on the matter. In the January 1980 Iowa caucuses that initiated the primaries season, Carter demolished Kennedy by a 59–31 percent margin. Kennedy&#x27;s fundraising immediately declined and his campaign had to downsize, but he remained defiant, saying &quot;[Now] we&#x27;ll see who is going to whip whose what.&quot; Nevertheless, Kennedy lost three New England contests. Kennedy did form a more coherent message about why he was running, saying at Georgetown University: &quot;I believe we must not permit the dream of social progress to be shattered by those whose premises have failed.&quot; However, concerns over Chappaquiddick and issues related to personal character prevented Kennedy from gaining the support of many people who were disillusioned with Carter. During a St. Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade in Chicago, Kennedy had to wear a bullet-proof vest due to assassination threats, and hecklers yelled &quot;Where&#x27;s Mary Jo?&quot; at him. In the key March 18 primary in Illinois, Kennedy failed to gain the support of Catholic voters, and Carter won 155 of 169 delegates.

With little mathematical hope of winning the nomination and polls showing another likely defeat in the New York primary, Kennedy prepared to withdraw from the race. However, partially due to Jewish voter unhappiness with a U.S. vote at the United Nations against Israeli settlements in the West Bank, Kennedy staged an upset and won the March 25 vote by a 59–41 percent margin. Carter responded with an advertising campaign that attacked Kennedy&#x27;s character in general without explicitly mentioning Chappaquiddick, but Kennedy still managed a narrow win in the April 22 Pennsylvania primary. Carter won 11 of 12 primaries held in May, while on the June 3 Super Tuesday primaries, Kennedy won California, New Jersey, and three smaller states out of eight contests. Overall, Kennedy had won 10 presidential primaries against Carter, who won 24.

Although Carter now had enough delegates to clinch the nomination, Kennedy carried his campaign on to the 1980 Democratic National Convention in August in New York, hoping to pass a rule there that would free delegates from being bound by primary results and open the convention. This move failed on the first night of the convention, and Kennedy withdrew. On the second night, August 12, Kennedy delivered the most famous speech of his career. Drawing on allusions to and quotes of Martin Luther King Jr., Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and Alfred Lord Tennyson to say that American liberalism was not passé, he concluded with the words:

The Madison Square Garden audience reacted with wild applause and demonstrations for half an hour. On the final night, Kennedy arrived late after Carter&#x27;s acceptance speech and while he shook Carter&#x27;s hand, he failed to raise Carter&#x27;s arm in the traditional show of party unity. Carter&#x27;s difficulty in securing the assistance of Kennedy supporters during the election campaign contributed to his November defeat by Ronald Reagan.

===1980s===

The 1980 election saw the Republicans capture not just the presidency but control of the Senate as well, and Kennedy was in the minority party for the first time in his career. Kennedy did not dwell upon his presidential loss, but instead reaffirmed his public commitment to American liberalism. He chose to become the ranking member of the Labor and Public Welfare Committee rather than of the Judiciary Committee, which he would later say was one of the most important decisions of his career. Kennedy became a committed champion of women&#x27;s issues, and established relationships with select Republican senators to block Reagan&#x27;s actions and preserve and improve the Voting Rights Act, funding for AIDS treatment, and equal funding for women&#x27;s sports under Title IX. To combat being in the minority, he worked long hours and devised a series of hearings-like public forums to which he could invite experts and discuss topics important to him. Kennedy could not hope to stop all of Reagan&#x27;s reshapings of government, but was often nearly the sole effective Democrat battling him.

In January 1981, Ted and Joan Kennedy announced they were getting a divorce. The proceedings were generally amicable, and she received a reported $4 million settlement when the divorce was granted in 1982. Later that year, Kennedy created the Friends of Ireland organization with Senator Daniel Moynihan and House Speaker Tip O&#x27;Neill to support initiatives for peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland.

Kennedy easily defeated Republican businessman Ray Shamie to win re-election in 1982. Senate leaders granted him a seat on the Armed Services Committee, while allowing him to keep his other major seats despite the traditional limit of two such seats. Kennedy became very visible in opposing aspects of the foreign policy of the Reagan administration, including U.S. intervention in the Salvadoran Civil War and U.S. support for the Contras in Nicaragua, and in opposing Reagan-supported weapons systems, including the B-1 bomber, the MX missile, and the Strategic Defense Initiative. Kennedy became the Senate&#x27;s leading advocate for a nuclear freeze and was a critic of Reagan&#x27;s confrontational policies toward the Soviet Union.

A 1983 KGB memo indicates that Kennedy engaged in back-channel communication with the Soviet Union. According to a May 14, 1983, memorandum from Chairman of the KGB Viktor Chebrikov to general secretary Yuri Andropov, former U.S. Senator John V. Tunney—a friend of Kennedy&#x27;s—visited Moscow that month and conveyed a message from Kennedy to Andropov. The memo indicates that the stated purpose of the communication was to &quot;&#x27;root out the threat of nuclear war&#x27;, &#x27;improve Soviet-American relations&#x27; and &#x27;define the safety of the world&#x27;&quot;. Kennedy reportedly offered to visit Moscow &quot;&#x27;to arm Soviet officials with explanations regarding problems of nuclear disarmament so they may be better prepared and more convincing during appearances in the USA&#x27;&quot; and to set up U.S. television appearances for Andropov.

Chebrikov also noted &quot;a little-hidden secret that [Kennedy] intended to run for president in 1988 and that the Democratic Party &#x27;may officially turn to him to lead the fight against the Republicans&#x27; in 1984 — turning the proposal from one purely about international cooperation to one tinged with personal political aspiration.&quot; Andropov was unimpressed by Kennedy&#x27;s overtures. After the Chebrikov memo was unearthed, both Tunney and a Kennedy spokesperson denied that it was true. Former Reagan administration negotiator Max Kampelman has asserted that Kennedy did engage in back-channel communications, but added that &quot;&#x27;the senator never acted or received information without informing the appropriate United States agency or official&#x27;&quot;. Kenneth Adelman, a deputy ambassador to the United Nations under Reagan, has asserted that the Reagan administration knew of back-channel communications between various senators and the Soviet Union and were unconcerned about the practice.

Kennedy&#x27;s staff drew up detailed plans for a candidacy in the 1984 presidential election that he considered, but with his family opposed and his realization that the Senate was a fully satisfying career, in late 1982 he decided not to run. Kennedy campaigned hard for Democratic presidential nominee Mondale and defended vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro from criticism over being a pro-choice Catholic, but Reagan was re-elected in a landslide.

Kennedy staged a tiring, dangerous, and high-profile trip to South Africa in January 1985. He defied both the apartheid government&#x27;s wishes and militant leftist AZAPO demonstrators by spending a night in the Soweto home of Bishop Desmond Tutu and also visited Winnie Mandela, wife of imprisoned black leader Nelson Mandela. Upon returning, Kennedy became a leader in the push for economic sanctions against South Africa; collaborating with Senator Lowell Weicker, he secured Senate passage, and the overriding of Reagan&#x27;s veto, of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986. Despite their many political differences, Kennedy and Reagan had a good personal relationship, and with the administration&#x27;s approval Kennedy traveled to the Soviet Union in 1986 to act as a go-between in arms control negotiations with reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. The discussions were productive, and Kennedy also helped gain the release of a number of Soviet Jewish refuseniks, including Anatoly Shcharansky.

Although Kennedy was an accomplished legislator, his personal life was troubled during this time. His weight fluctuated wildly and he drank heavily at times – although not when it would interfere with his Senate duties. Kennedy later acknowledged, &quot;I went through a lot of difficult times over a period in my life where [drinking] may have been somewhat of a factor or force.&quot; He chased women frequently, and also was in a series of more serious romantic relationships but did not want to commit to anything long-term. He often caroused with fellow Senator Chris Dodd; twice in 1985 they were in drunken incidents in Washington restaurants, with one involving a waitress claiming the pair sexually assaulted her. In 1987, Kennedy and a young female lobbyist were surprised in the back room of a restaurant in a state of partial undress. Female Senate staffers from the late 1980s and early 1990s recalled that Kennedy was on an informal list of male Senators who were known for harassing women regularly.
After again considering a candidacy for the 1988 presidential election, in December 1985 Kennedy publicly declined to run. This decision was influenced by his personal difficulties, family concerns, and contentment with remaining in the Senate. He added: &quot;I know this decision means I may never be president. But the pursuit of the presidency is not my life. Public service is.&quot; Kennedy used his legislative skills to achieve passage of the COBRA Act, which extended employer-based health benefits after leaving a job. Following the 1986 congressional elections, the Democrats regained control of the Senate, and Kennedy became chair of the Labor and Public Welfare Committee. By this time, Kennedy had become what colleague and future President Joe Biden termed &quot;the best strategist in the Senate&quot;. Kennedy continued his close working relationship with ranking Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, and they were close allies on many health-related measures.

One of Kennedy&#x27;s biggest battles in the Senate came with Reagan&#x27;s July 1987 nomination of Judge Robert Bork to the U.S. Supreme Court. Kennedy saw a possible Bork appointment as leading to a dismantling of civil rights law that he had helped put into place, and feared Bork&#x27;s originalist judicial philosophy. Kennedy&#x27;s staff had researched Bork&#x27;s writings and record, and within an hour of the nomination – which was initially expected to succeed – Kennedy went on the Senate floor to announce his opposition:

The incendiary rhetoric of what became known as the &quot;Robert Bork&#x27;s America&quot; speech enraged Bork supporters, who considered it slanderous, and worried some Democrats as well. Bork responded, &quot;There was not a line in that speech that was accurate.&quot; In 1988, an analysis published in the &quot;Western Political Quarterly&quot; of &quot;amicus curiae&quot; briefs filed by U.S. Solicitors General during the Warren and Burger Courts found that during Bork&#x27;s tenure in the position during the Nixon and Ford Administrations (1973–1977), Bork took liberal positions in the aggregate as often as Thurgood Marshall did during the Johnson Administration (1965–1967) and more often than Wade H. McCree did during the Carter Administration (1977–1981), in part because Bork filed briefs in favor of the litigates in civil rights cases 75 percent of the time (contradicting a previous review of his civil rights record published in 1983).

However, the Reagan administration was unprepared for the assault, and the speech froze some Democrats from supporting the nomination and gave Kennedy and other Bork opponents time to prepare the case against him. When the September 1987 Judiciary Committee hearings began, Kennedy challenged Bork forcefully on civil rights, privacy, women&#x27;s rights, and other issues. Bork&#x27;s own demeanor hurt him, and the nomination was defeated both in committee and the full Senate. The tone of the Bork battle changed the way Washington worked – with controversial nominees or candidates now experiencing all-out war waged against them – and the ramifications of it are still being felt today.

During the 1988 presidential election, Kennedy supported the eventual Democratic nominee, Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis. In the fall, Dukakis lost to George H. W. Bush, but Kennedy won re-election to the Senate over Republican Joseph D. Malone in the easiest race of his career. Kennedy remained a powerful force in the Senate. In 1988, Kennedy co-sponsored an amendment to the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which prohibits discrimination in the rental, sale, marketing, and financing of the nation&#x27;s housing; the amendment strengthened the ability of the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity to enforce the Act and expanded the protected classes to include disabled persons and families with children. After prolonged negotiations during 1989 with Bush chief of staff John H. Sununu and Attorney General Richard Thornburgh to secure Bush&#x27;s approval, he directed passage of the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Kennedy had personal interest in the bill due to his sister Rosemary&#x27;s condition and his son&#x27;s lost leg, and he considered its enactment one of the most important successes of his career. In the late 1980s Kennedy and Hatch staged a prolonged battle against Senator Jesse Helms to provide funding to combat the AIDS epidemic and provide treatment for low-income people affected; this would culminate in passage of the Ryan White Care Act. In late November 1989, Kennedy traveled to see first-hand the newly fallen Berlin Wall; he spoke at John-F.-Kennedy-Platz, site of the famous &quot;Ich bin ein Berliner&quot; speech in 1963, and said &quot;Emotionally, I just wish my brother could have seen it.&quot;

===Early 1990s===
Kennedy&#x27;s personal life came to dominate his image. In 1989, paparazzi stalked him on a vacation in Europe and photographed him having sex on a motorboat. In February 1990, Michael Kelly published his lengthy profile &quot;Ted Kennedy on the Rocks&quot; in &quot;GQ&quot; magazine. It captured Kennedy as &quot;an aging Irish boyo clutching a bottle and diddling a blonde,&quot; portrayed him as an out-of-control Regency rake, and brought his behavior to the forefront of public attention. Kennedy&#x27;s brother-in-law, Stephen Edward Smith, died from cancer in August 1990; Smith was a close family member and troubleshooter, and his death left Kennedy emotionally bereft. Kennedy pushed on, but even his legislative successes, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which expanded employee rights in discrimination cases, came at the cost of being criticized for compromising with Republicans and Southern Democrats.

On Easter weekend 1991, Kennedy was at a get-together at the family&#x27;s Palm Beach, Florida, estate. After reminiscing about his brother-in-law, Kennedy was restless and maudlin when he left for a late-night visit to a local bar. He got his son Patrick and nephew William Kennedy Smith to accompany him. Patrick and Smith returned with women they met there, Michelle Cassone and Patricia Bowman. Cassone said that Ted Kennedy subsequently walked in on her and Patrick; Ted was dressed only in a nightshirt and had a weird look on his face. Smith and Bowman went out on the beach, where they had sex that he said was consensual but she said was rape. The local police made a delayed investigation; Kennedy sources were soon feeding the press with negative information about Bowman&#x27;s background, and several mainstream newspapers broke an unwritten rule by publishing her name. The case quickly became a media frenzy. While not directly implicated in the case, Kennedy became the frequent butt of jokes on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and other late-night television programs. &quot;Time&quot; magazine said Kennedy was being perceived as a &quot;Palm Beach boozer, lout and tabloid grotesque&quot; while &quot;Newsweek&quot; said Kennedy was &quot;the living symbol of the family flaws&quot;.

Bork and Clarence Thomas were the two most contentious Supreme Court nominations in United States history to that point. When the Thomas hearings began in September 1991, Kennedy pressed Thomas on his unwillingness to express an opinion about &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, but the nomination appeared headed for success. When Anita Hill brought the sexual harassment charges against Thomas the following month, the nomination battle dominated public discourse. Kennedy was hamstrung by his past reputation and the ongoing developments in the William Kennedy Smith case. He said almost nothing until the third day of the Thomas–Hill hearings, and when he did it was criticized by Hill supporters for being too little, too late.

Biographer Adam Clymer rated Kennedy&#x27;s silence during the Thomas hearings as the worst moment of his Senate career. Writer Anna Quindlen said &quot;[Kennedy] let us down because he had to; he was muzzled by the facts of his life&quot;. On the day before the full Senate vote, Kennedy gave an impassioned speech against Thomas, declaring that the treatment of Hill had been &quot;shameful&quot; and that &quot;[t]o give the benefit of the doubt to Judge Thomas is to say that Judge Thomas is more important than the Supreme Court.&quot; He then voted against the nomination. Thomas was confirmed by a 52–48 vote, one of the narrowest margins ever for a successful nomination.

Due to the Palm Beach media attention and the Thomas hearings, Kennedy&#x27;s public image suffered. A Gallup Poll gave Kennedy a 22 percent national approval rating. A &quot;Boston Herald&quot;/WCVB-TV poll found that 62 percent of Massachusetts citizens thought Kennedy should not run for re-election, by a 2-to-1 margin thought Kennedy had misled authorities in the Palm Beach investigation, and had Kennedy losing a hypothetical Senate race to Governor William Weld by 25 points. Meanwhile, at a June 17, 1991, dinner party, Kennedy saw Victoria Anne Reggie, a Washington lawyer, a divorced mother of two, and the daughter of an old Kennedy family ally, Louisiana judge Edmund Reggie. They began dating and by September were in a serious relationship. In a late October speech at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Kennedy sought to begin a political recovery, saying: I am painfully aware that the criticism directed at me in recent months involves far more than disagreements with my positions ... [It] involves the disappointment of friends and many others who rely on me to fight the good fight. To them I say, I recognize my own shortcomings – the faults in the conduct of my private life. I realize that I alone am responsible for them, and I am the one who must confront them. In December 1991, the William Kennedy Smith rape trial was held; it was nationally televised and the most watched until the O. J. Simpson murder case three years later. Kennedy&#x27;s testimony at the trial seemed relaxed, confident, and forthcoming, and helped convince the public that his involvement had been peripheral and unintended. Smith was acquitted.

Kennedy and Reggie continued their relationship, and he was devoted to her two children, Curran and Caroline. They became engaged in March 1992, and were married in a civil ceremony by Judge A. David Mazzone on July 3, 1992, at Kennedy&#x27;s home in McLean, Virginia. She would gain credit for stabilizing his personal life and helping him resume a productive Senate career.

Kennedy had no further presidential ambitions. Despite having initially backed former fellow Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas in the 1992 Democratic presidential primaries, Kennedy formed a good relationship with Democratic President Bill Clinton upon the latter taking office in 1993. Kennedy floor-managed passage of Clinton&#x27;s National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 that created the AmeriCorps program, and despite reservations supported the president on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). On the issue Kennedy cared most about, national health insurance, he supported but was not much involved in formation of the Clinton health care plan, which was run by First Lady Hillary Clinton and others. It failed badly and damaged the prospects for such legislation for years to come. In 1994, Kennedy&#x27;s strong recommendation of his former Judiciary Committee staffer Stephen Breyer played a role in Clinton appointing Breyer to the U.S. Supreme Court. During 1994 Kennedy became the first senator with a home page on the World Wide Web; the product of an effort with the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, it helped counter the image of Kennedy as old and out of touch.

In the 1994 U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts, Kennedy faced his first serious challenger, the young, telegenic, and very well-funded Mitt Romney. Romney ran as a successful entrepreneur and Washington outsider with a strong family image and moderate stands on social issues, while Kennedy was saddled not only with his recent past but the 25th anniversary of Chappaquiddick and his first wife Joan seeking a renegotiated divorce settlement. By mid-September 1994, polls showed the race to be even. Kennedy&#x27;s campaign ran short on money, and belying his image as endlessly wealthy, he was forced to take out a second mortgage on his Virginia home. Kennedy responded with a series of attack ads, which focused both on Romney&#x27;s shifting political views and on the treatment of workers at a paper products plant owned by Romney&#x27;s Bain Capital. Kennedy&#x27;s new wife Vicki proved to be a strong asset in campaigning. Kennedy and Romney held a widely watched late October debate without a clear winner, but by then Kennedy had pulled ahead in polls and stayed ahead afterward. In the November election, despite a very bad outcome for the Democratic Party nationally, Kennedy won re-election by a 58 percent to 41 percent margin, the closest re-election race of his career.

Kennedy&#x27;s mother Rose died in January 1995. From then on, Kennedy intensified the practice of his Catholic faith, often attending Mass several times a week.

===Late 1990s===
Kennedy&#x27;s role as a liberal lion in the Senate came to the fore in 1995, when the Republican Revolution took control and legislation intending to fulfill the Contract with America was coming from Newt Gingrich&#x27;s House of Representatives. Many Democrats in the Senate and the country overall felt depressed but Kennedy rallied forces to combat the Republicans. By the beginning of 1996, the Republicans had overreached; most of the Contract had failed to pass the Senate and the Democrats could once again move forward with legislation, almost all of it coming out of Kennedy&#x27;s staff.
In 1996, Kennedy secured an increase in the minimum wage, which was one of his favorite issues; there would not be another increase for ten years. Following the failure of the Clinton health care plan, Kennedy went against his past strategy and sought incremental measures instead. Kennedy worked with Republican Senator Nancy Kassebaum to create and pass the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act in 1996, which set new marks for portability of insurance and confidentiality of records. The same year, Kennedy&#x27;s Mental Health Parity Act forced insurance companies to treat mental health payments the same as others with respect to limits reached. In 1997, Kennedy was the prime mover behind the State Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program, which used increased tobacco taxes to fund the largest expansion of taxpayer-funded health insurance coverage for children in the U.S. since Medicaid began in the 1960s. Senator Hatch and Hillary Clinton also played major roles in SCHIP passing.

Kennedy was a stalwart backer of President Clinton during the 1998 Lewinsky scandal, often trying to cheer up the president and getting him to add past Kennedy staffer Greg Craig to his defense team, which helped improve the president&#x27;s fortunes. In the trial after the 1999 impeachment of Bill Clinton, Kennedy voted to acquit Clinton on both charges, saying &quot;Republicans in the House of Representatives, in their partisan vendetta against the President, have wielded the impeachment power in precisely the way the framers rejected, recklessly and without regard for the Constitution or the will of the American people.&quot;

On July 16, 1999, Kennedy&#x27;s nephew John F. Kennedy Jr. was killed when his Piper Saratoga aircraft crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. John Jr.&#x27;s wife, Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy, and his sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette, were also killed. Ted was the family patriarch, and he and President Clinton consoled his extended family at the public memorial service. He paraphrased William Butler Yeats by saying of his nephew: &quot;We dared to think, in that other Irish phrase, that this John Kennedy would live to comb gray hair, with his beloved Carolyn by his side. But like his father, he had every gift but length of years.&quot; &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote of the changed role: &quot;It underscored the evolution that surprised so many people who knew the Kennedys: Teddy, the baby of the family, who had grown into a man who could sometimes be dissolute and reckless, had become the steady, indispensable patriarch, the one the family turned to in good times and bad.&quot;

===2000s===

Kennedy had an easy time with his re-election to the Senate in 2000, as Republican lawyer and entrepreneur Jack E. Robinson III was sufficiently damaged by his past personal record that Republican state party officials refused to endorse him. Kennedy got 73 percent of the general election vote, with Robinson splitting the rest with Libertarian Carla Howell. During the long, disputed post-presidential election battle in Florida in 2000, Kennedy supported Vice President Al Gore&#x27;s legal actions. After the bitter contest, many Democrats in Congress did not want to work with incoming President George W. Bush. Kennedy, however, saw Bush as genuinely interested in a major overhaul of education, Bush saw Kennedy as a potential major ally in the Senate, and the two partnered together on the legislation. Kennedy accepted provisions governing mandatory student testing and teacher accountability that other Democrats and the National Education Association did not like, in return for increased funding levels for education. The No Child Left Behind Act was passed by Congress in May and June 2001 and signed into law by Bush in January 2002. Kennedy soon became disenchanted with the implementation of the act, however, saying for 2003 that it was $9 billion short of the $29 billion authorized. Kennedy said, &quot;The tragedy is that these long overdue reforms are finally in place, but the funds are not,&quot; and accused Bush of not living up to his personal word on the matter. Other Democrats concluded that Kennedy&#x27;s penchant for cross-party deals had gotten the better of him. The White House defended its spending levels given the context of two wars going on.

Kennedy was in his Senate offices meeting with First Lady Laura Bush when the September 11, 2001, attacks took place. Two of the airplanes involved had taken off from Boston, and Kennedy telephoned each of the 177 Massachusetts families who had lost members in the attacks. He pushed through legislation that provided healthcare and grief counseling benefits for the families, and recommended the appointment of his former chief of staff Kenneth Feinberg as Special Master of the government&#x27;s September 11th Victim Compensation Fund. Kennedy maintained an ongoing bond with the Massachusetts 9/11 families in subsequent years.
Kennedy was a supporter of the American-led 2001 overthrow of the Taliban government in Afghanistan. However, Kennedy strongly opposed the Iraq War from the start, and was one of 23 senators voting against the Iraq War Resolution in October 2002. As the Iraqi insurgency grew in subsequent years, Kennedy pronounced that the conflict was &quot;Bush&#x27;s Vietnam.&quot; In response to losses of Massachusetts service personnel to roadside bombs, Kennedy became vocal on the issue of Humvee vulnerability, and co-sponsored enacted 2005 legislation that sped up production and Army procurement of up-armored Humvees.

Despite the strained relationship between Kennedy and Bush over No Child Left Behind spending, the two attempted to work together again on extending Medicare to cover prescription drug benefits. Kennedy&#x27;s strategy was again doubted by other Democrats, but he saw the proposed $400 billion program as an opportunity that should not be missed. However, when the final formulation of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act contained provisions to steer seniors towards private plans, Kennedy switched to opposing it. It passed in late 2003, and led Kennedy to again say he had been betrayed by the Bush administration.

In the 2004 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Kennedy campaigned heavily for fellow Massachusetts Senator John Kerry and lent his chief of staff, Mary Beth Cahill, to the Kerry campaign. Kennedy&#x27;s appeal was effective among blue collar and minority voters, and helped Kerry stage a come-from-behind win in the Iowa caucuses that propelled him on to the Democratic nomination.
After Bush won a second term in the 2004 general election, Kennedy continued to oppose him on Iraq and many other issues. However, Kennedy sought to partner with Republicans again on the matter of immigration reform in the context of the ongoing United States immigration debate. Kennedy was chair of the United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security, and Refugees, and in 2005, Kennedy teamed with Republican Senator John McCain on the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act. The &quot;McCain-Kennedy bill&quot; did not reach a Senate vote, but provided a template for further attempts at dealing comprehensively with legalization, guest worker programs, and border enforcement components. Kennedy returned again with the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, which was sponsored by an ideologically diverse, bipartisan group of senators and had strong support from the Bush administration. The bill aroused furious grassroots opposition among talk radio listeners and others as an &quot;amnesty&quot; program, and despite Kennedy&#x27;s last-minute attempts to salvage it, failed a cloture vote in the Senate. Kennedy was philosophical about the defeat, saying that it often took several attempts across multiple Congresses for this type of legislation to build enough momentum for passage.

In 2006, Kennedy released a children&#x27;s book from the view of his dog Splash, &quot;My Senator and Me: A Dog&#x27;s-Eye View of Washington, D.C.&quot; Also in 2006, Kennedy released a political history entitled &quot;America Back on Track&quot;.

In 2006, a Cessna Citation 550 in which Kennedy was flying lost electrical power after being struck by lightning and had to be diverted.

Kennedy again easily won re-election to the Senate in 2006, winning 69 percent of the vote against Republican language school owner Kenneth Chase, who suffered from very poor name recognition.

===Obama, illness===
Kennedy initially stated that he would support John Kerry again if he were to make another bid for president in 2008, but in January 2007, Kerry said he would not make a second attempt for the White House. Kennedy then remained neutral as the 2008 Democratic nomination battle between Senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama intensified, because his friend Chris Dodd was also running for the nomination. The initial caucuses and primaries were split between Clinton and Obama. When Dodd withdrew from the race, Kennedy became dissatisfied with the tone of the Clinton campaign and what he saw as racially tinged remarks by Bill Clinton. Kennedy gave an endorsement to Obama on January 28, 2008, despite appeals by both Clintons not to do so. In a move that was seen as a symbolic passing of the torch, Kennedy said that it was &quot;time again for a new generation of leadership,&quot; and compared Obama&#x27;s ability to inspire with that of his fallen brothers. In return, Kennedy gained a commitment from Obama to make universal health care a top priority of his administration if he were elected. Kennedy&#x27;s endorsement was considered among the most influential that any Democrat could get, and raised the possibility of improving Obama&#x27;s vote-getting among unions, Hispanics, and traditional base Democrats. It dominated the political news, and gave national exposure to a candidate who was still not well known in much of the country, as the Super Tuesday primaries across the nation approached.

On May 17, 2008, Kennedy suffered a seizure, which was followed by a second seizure as he was being rushed from the Kennedy Compound to Cape Cod Hospital and then by helicopter to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Within days, doctors announced that Kennedy had a malignant glioma, a type of brain tumor. The grim diagnosis brought shocked reactions from many senators of both parties and from President Bush.

Doctors initially informed Kennedy that the tumor was inoperable, but Kennedy followed standard procedure and sought other opinions. He decided to follow the most aggressive course of treatment possible. On June 2, 2008, Kennedy underwent brain surgery at Duke University Medical Center in an attempt to remove as much of the tumor as possible. The 3½-hour operation—conducted by Dr. Allan Friedman while Kennedy was conscious to minimize any permanent neurological effects—was deemed successful. Kennedy left the hospital a week later to begin a course of chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Opinions varied regarding Kennedy&#x27;s prognosis: the surgery typically extends survival time for only a few months, but people can sometimes live for years.
The operation and follow-up treatments left Kennedy thinner, prone to additional seizures, weak and short on energy, and hurt his balance.
Kennedy made his first post-illness public appearance on July 9, when he surprised the Senate by showing up to supply the added vote to break a Republican filibuster against a bill to preserve Medicare fees for doctors. In addition, Kennedy was ill from an attack of kidney stones. Against the advice of some associates, he insisted on appearing during the first night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention on August 25, 2008, where a video tribute to him was played. Introduced by his niece Caroline Kennedy, the senator said, &quot;It is so wonderful to be here. Nothing – nothing – is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight.&quot; He then delivered a speech to the delegates (which he had to memorize, as his impaired vision left him unable to read a teleprompter) in which, reminiscent of his speech at the 1980 Democratic National Convention, he said, &quot;this November, the torch will be passed again to a new generation of Americans. So, with Barack Obama and for you and for me, our country will be committed to his cause. The work begins anew. The hope rises again. And the dream lives on.&quot; The dramatic appearance and speech electrified the convention audience, as Kennedy vowed that he would be present to see Obama inaugurated.

On September 26, 2008, Kennedy suffered a mild seizure while at home in Hyannis Port; he immediately went to the hospital, was examined and released later that same day. Doctors believed that a change in his medication triggered the seizure. Kennedy relocated to Florida for the winter; he continued his treatments, did a lot of sailing, and stayed in touch with legislative matters via telephone. In his absence, many senators wore blue &quot;Tedstrong&quot; bracelets.

On January 20, 2009, Kennedy attended Barack Obama&#x27;s presidential inauguration, but then suffered a seizure at the luncheon immediately afterwards. He was taken by ambulance to MedStar Washington Hospital Center. Doctors attributed the episode to &quot;simple fatigue&quot;. He was released from the hospital the following morning, and he returned to his home in Washington, D.C.
When the 111th Congress began, Kennedy dropped his spot on the Senate Judiciary Committee to focus all his attentions on national health care issues, which he regarded as &quot;the cause of my life&quot;. He saw the characteristics of the Obama administration and the Democratic majorities in Congress as representing the third and best great chance for universal health care, following the lost 1971 Nixon and 1993 Clinton opportunities, and as his last big legislative battle. Kennedy made another surprise appearance in the Senate to break a Republican filibuster against the Obama stimulus package. When spring arrived, Kennedy appeared on Capitol Hill more frequently, although staffers often did not announce his attendance at committee meetings until they were sure Kennedy was well enough to appear. On March 4, 2009, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Gordon Brown announced that Kennedy had been granted an honorary knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II for his work in the Northern Ireland peace process, and for his contribution to UK–US relations, although the move caused some controversy in the UK due to his connections with Gerry Adams of the Irish republican political party Sinn Féin. Later in March, a bill reauthorizing and expanding the AmeriCorps program was renamed the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act by Senator Hatch in Kennedy&#x27;s honor. Kennedy threw the ceremonial first pitch at Fenway Park before the Boston Red Sox season opener in April, echoing what his grandfather &quot;Honey Fitz&quot; – a member of the Royal Rooters – had done to open the park in 1912. Even when his illness prevented him from being a major factor in health plan deliberations, his symbolic presence still made him one of the key senators involved.

However, Kennedy&#x27;s tumor had spread by spring 2009 and treatments for it were no longer effective; this information was not disclosed to the public. By June 2009 Kennedy had not cast a Senate vote in three months, and his deteriorating physical health had forced him to retreat to Massachusetts, where he underwent another round of chemotherapy. In his absence, premature release of his health committee&#x27;s expansive plan resulted in a poor public reception. Kennedy&#x27;s friend Chris Dodd had taken over his role on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, but Republican senators and other observers said that the lack of Kennedy&#x27;s physical presence had resulted in less consultation with them and was making successful negotiation more difficult. Democrats also missed Kennedy&#x27;s ability to smooth divisions on the health proposals. Kennedy did cut a television commercial for Dodd, who was struggling early on in his 2010 re-election bid. In July, HBO began showing a documentary tribute to Kennedy&#x27;s life, &quot;Teddy: In His Own Words&quot;. A health care reform bill was voted out of the committee with content Kennedy favored, but still faced a long, difficult process before having a chance at becoming law. At the end of July 2009, Kennedy was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. He could not attend the ceremony to receive this medal, and attended a private service but not the public funeral when his sister Eunice Kennedy Shriver died at age 88 on August 11, 2009. In his final days, Kennedy was in a wheelchair and had difficulty speaking, but consistently stated that &quot;I&#x27;ve had a wonderful life&quot;.

==Death==
Kennedy died of a brain tumor on August 25, 2009, at age 77 at his home in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, two weeks after the death of his sister Eunice Kennedy Shriver. In a statement, Kennedy&#x27;s family thanked &quot;everyone who gave him care and support over this last year, and everyone who stood with him for so many years in his tireless march for progress toward justice&quot;.

===Reaction===
President Obama said that Kennedy&#x27;s death marked the &quot;passing of an extraordinary leader&quot; and that he and First Lady Michelle Obama were &quot;heartbroken&quot;, while Vice President Biden said &quot;today we lost a truly remarkable man,&quot; and that Kennedy &quot;changed the circumstances of tens of millions of Americans&quot;. Mitt Romney, former Massachusetts Governor and Kennedy&#x27;s opponent in the 1994 Senate race, called Kennedy &quot;the kind of man you could like even if he was your adversary&quot; and former First Lady Nancy Reagan said she was &quot;terribly saddened&quot;. She went on, &quot;Given our political differences, people are sometimes surprised how close Ronnie and I have been to the Kennedy family. ... I will miss him.&quot; Senator Robert Byrd, the President pro tempore of the Senate, issued a statement on Kennedy&#x27;s death in which he said &quot;My heart and soul weeps at the loss of my best friend in the Senate, my beloved friend&quot;; Byrd had cried uncontrollably on the Senate floor when Kennedy&#x27;s cancer diagnosis was made public the previous year.

There were also tributes from outside politics. Before a Boston Red Sox game, flags at Fenway Park were flown at half-staff and &quot;Taps&quot; was performed as players stood along the baselines, and the Yankees observed a moment of silence before a game at Yankee Stadium.

===Funeral services===
Kennedy&#x27;s funeral procession traveled from the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis Port to the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, where his corpse lay in repose; over 50,000 members of the public filed by to pay their respects. On Saturday, August 29, a procession traveled from the library to the Our Lady of Perpetual Help Basilica in Boston, for a funeral Mass. Present at the funeral service were President Obama and former presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush (also representing his father, former President George H. W. Bush, who decided not to attend), along with Vice President Biden, three former Vice presidents, 58 senators, 21 former senators, many members of the House of Representatives, and several foreign dignitaries. President Obama delivered the eulogy.

The funeral service also drew attendees from outside politics from Boston, Washington, and across the United States, including journalists Bob Woodward, Tom Brokaw and Gwen Ifill; singers Tony Bennett and Plácido Domingo; cellist Yo-Yo Ma; actors Jack Nicholson, Lauren Bacall, and Brian Stokes Mitchell; presidents and chancellors of Boston-area colleges and universities including Harvard University President Drew G. Faust and University of Massachusetts President Jack M. Wilson; and sports figures including former Boston Celtics basketball player Bill Russell, as well as the top management of the Red Sox.

Kennedy&#x27;s remains were returned to Washington, D.C., and laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery, near the graves of his assassinated brothers. Former Cardinal and Washington, D.C., Archbishop Theodore McCarrick presided over his burial service, which was attended by Biden, Kennedy&#x27;s widow Vicki, and other members of the Kennedy family. Kennedy&#x27;s grave marker is identical to his brother Robert&#x27;s: a white oak cross and a white marble foot marker bearing his name and years of birth and death.

===Aftermath===
&quot;True Compass&quot;, the memoir that Kennedy worked on throughout his illness, was published three weeks after his death. It debuted atop the New York Times Best Seller list and by mid-December 2009 had sold some 400,000 copies.

A special election was scheduled for January 19, 2010, for the U.S. Senate seat from Massachusetts left vacant by Kennedy&#x27;s death. Shortly before his death, Kennedy had written to Democratic Governor of Massachusetts Deval Patrick and the Massachusetts legislature, asking them to change state law to allow an appointee to fill a U.S. Senate vacancy for a term expiring upon the special election. Kennedy had been instrumental in the prior 2004 alteration of this law to prevent Governor Mitt Romney from appointing a Republican senator should John Kerry&#x27;s presidential campaign succeed. The law was amended, and on September 24, 2009, Paul G. Kirk, former Democratic National Committee chairman and former aide to Kennedy, was appointed to occupy the Senate seat until the completion of the special election. Kirk announced that he would not be a candidate in the special election. In that election, Republican State Senator Scott Brown won the seat in a stunning upset, ending Democratic control of it going back to 1953.

Brown&#x27;s victory ended the 60-vote supermajority in the Senate that the Democrats had held since mid-2009. Democrats rallied and passed health care reform legislation; Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was instrumental in doing so, credited Kennedy in her closing remarks on the House floor before the final vote. Kennedy&#x27;s widow Vicki attended the signing of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, at which both she and President Obama wore blue &quot;Tedstrong&quot; bracelets. Congressman Patrick Kennedy brought a copy of a national health insurance bill his father had introduced in 1970 as a gift for the president. He laid a note on his father&#x27;s grave that said, &quot;Dad, the unfinished business is done.&quot; Patrick&#x27;s earlier decision not to seek re-election meant that in January 2011, a 64-year-long period in which a Kennedy held Federal elective office came to an end, but resumed in January 2013 (due to the November 2012 election) with Ted&#x27;s great-nephew, Joseph P. Kennedy III, becoming a member of the House. Democratic control of Kennedy&#x27;s former Senate seat was also regained following Brown&#x27;s 2012 loss to Elizabeth Warren.

==Political positions==

Political scientists gauge ideology in part by comparing the annual ratings by the Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) with the ratings by the American Conservative Union (ACU). Kennedy had a lifetime liberal 90 percent score from the ADA through 2004, while the ACU awarded Kennedy a lifetime conservative rating of 2 percent through 2008. Using another metric, Kennedy had a lifetime average liberal score of 88.7 percent, according to a &quot;National Journal&quot; analysis that places him ideologically as the third-most liberal senator of all those in office in 2009. A 2004 analysis by political scientists Joshua D. Clinton of Princeton University and Simon Jackman and Doug Rivers of Stanford University examined some of the difficulties in making this kind of analysis, and found Kennedy likely to be the 8th-to-15th-most liberal Senator during the 108th Congress. &quot;The Almanac of American Politics&quot; rates congressional votes as liberal or conservative on the political spectrum, in three policy areas: economic, social, and foreign. For 2005–2006, Kennedy&#x27;s average ratings were as follows: the economic rating was 91 percent liberal and 0 percent conservative, the social rating was 89 percent liberal and 5 percent conservative, and the foreign rating was 96 percent liberal and 0 percent conservative.

Various interest groups gave Kennedy scores or grades as to how well his votes aligned with the positions of each group. The American Civil Liberties Union gave him an 84 percent lifetime score as of 2009. During the 1990s and 2000s, NARAL Pro-Choice America and Planned Parenthood typically gave Kennedy ratings of 100 percent, while the National Right to Life Committee typically gave him a rating of less than 10 percent. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence gave Kennedy a lifetime rating of 100 percent through 2002, while the NRA Political Victory Fund gave Kennedy a lifetime grade of &quot;F&quot; (failing) as of 2006.

==Cultural and political image==

When Kennedy died in August 2009, he was the second-most senior member of the Senate (after President pro tempore Robert Byrd of West Virginia) and the third longest-serving senator of all time, behind Byrd and Strom Thurmond of South Carolina. Later that same year, he was passed by Daniel Inouye of Hawaii. Kennedy therefore held the record as the longest-serving Democratic member of Congress to solely serve as a senator until October 2021, when he was surpassed by fellow Democrat Patrick Leahy of Vermont.

During his tenure, Kennedy became one of the most recognizable and influential members of his party and was sometimes called a &quot;Democratic icon&quot; as well as &quot;The Lion of the Senate&quot;. Kennedy and his Senate staff authored around 2,500 bills, of which more than 300 were enacted into law. Kennedy co-sponsored another 550 bills that became law after 1973. Kennedy was known for his effectiveness in dealing with Republican senators and administrations, sometimes to the irritation of other Democrats. During the 101st Congress under President George H. W. Bush, at least half of the successful proposals put forward by the Senate Democratic policy makers came out of Kennedy&#x27;s Labor and Human Resources Committee. During the 2000s, almost every bipartisan bill signed during the George W. Bush administration had significant involvement from Kennedy. A late 2000s survey of Republican senators ranked Kennedy first among Democrats in bipartisanship. Kennedy strongly believed in the principle &quot;never let the perfect be the enemy of the good,&quot; and would agree to pass legislation he viewed as incomplete or imperfect with the goal of improving it down the road. In April 2006, Kennedy was selected by &quot;Time&quot; as one of &quot;America&#x27;s 10 Best Senators&quot;; the magazine noted that he had &quot;amassed a titanic record of legislation affecting the lives of virtually every man, woman and child in the country&quot; and that &quot;by the late 1990s, the liberal icon had become such a prodigious cross-aisle dealer that Republican leaders began pressuring party colleagues not to sponsor bills with him&quot;. In May 2008, soon-to-be Republican presidential nominee John McCain said, &quot;[Kennedy] is a legendary lawmaker and I have the highest respect for him. When we have worked together, he has been a skillful, fair and generous partner.&quot; Republican Governor of California and Kennedy relative Arnold Schwarzenegger described &quot;Uncle Teddy&quot; as &quot;a liberal icon, a warrior for the less fortunate, a fierce advocate for health-care reform, a champion of social justice here and abroad&quot; and &quot;the rock of his family&quot;. At the time of Kennedy&#x27;s death, sociologist and &quot;Nation&quot; board member Norman Birnbaum wrote that Kennedy had come to be viewed as the &quot;voice&quot; and &quot;conscience&quot; of American progressivism.

Despite his bipartisan legislative practices, Kennedy was a polarizing symbol of American liberalism for many years. Republican and conservative groups long viewed Kennedy as a reliable &quot;bogeyman&quot; to mention in fundraising letters, on par with Hillary Clinton and similar to Democratic and liberal appeals mentioning Newt Gingrich. The famous racially motivated &quot;Hands&quot; attack ad used in North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms&#x27;s 1990 re-election campaign against Harvey Gantt accused Gantt of supporting &quot;Ted Kennedy&#x27;s racial quota law&quot;. University of California, San Diego political science professor Gary Jacobson&#x27;s 2006 study of partisan polarization found that in a state-by-state survey of job approval ratings of the state&#x27;s senators, Kennedy had the largest partisan difference of any senator, with a 57 percentage point difference in approval between Massachusetts&#x27;s Democrats and Republicans. The Associated Press wrote that, &quot;Perhaps because it was impossible, Kennedy never tried to shake his image as a liberal titan to admirers and a left-wing caricature to detractors.&quot;

After Robert Kennedy&#x27;s assassination in 1968, Ted was the most prominent living member of the Kennedy family and the last surviving son of Joseph P. Kennedy and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy. John F. Kennedy had said in 1957, &quot;Just as I went into politics because Joe died, if anything happened to me tomorrow, my brother Bobby would run for my seat in the Senate. And if Bobby died, Teddy would take over for him.&quot; However, Ted was never able to carry on the &quot;Camelot&quot; mystique in the same way that both of his fallen brothers had, with much of it disappearing during his failed 1980 presidential bid. His negligence in the death of Mary Jo Kopechne at Chappaquiddick and his well-documented later personal problems further tarnished his image in relation to the Kennedy name, and significantly damaged his chances of ever becoming president. The Associated Press wrote, &quot;Unlike his brothers, Edward M. Kennedy has grown old in public, his victories, defeats and human contradictions played out across the decades in the public glare.&quot; But Kennedy&#x27;s legislative accomplishments remained, and as &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote, &quot;By the early 21st century, the achievements of the younger brother would be enough to rival those of many presidents.&quot; His death prompted the realization that the &quot;Camelot era&quot; was truly over. Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;The New York Times&quot; obituary described him via a character sketch: He was a Rabelaisian figure in the Senate and in life, instantly recognizable by his shock of white hair, his florid, oversize face, his booming Boston brogue, his powerful but pained stride. He was a celebrity, sometimes a self-parody, a hearty friend, an implacable foe, a man of large faith and large flaws, a melancholy character who persevered, drank deeply and sang loudly. He was a Kennedy.

==Awards and honors==

Kennedy&#x27;s honors include an honorary knighthood bestowed by Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, the Order of the Aztec Eagle from Mexico, the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Order of Merit of Chile, and honorary degrees from several institutions including Harvard University.

<doc id="184152" wikidata="Q544942" url="?curid=184152" title="Box Car Racer (album)">
<text>Box Car Racer is the only studio album by American rock band Box Car Racer. Produced by Jerry Finn, the album was released on May 21, 2002, through MCA Records. The band was a side-project of Blink-182 members Tom DeLonge and Travis Barker, with David Kennedy completing the band&#x27;s studio lineup. A bassist and friend of Barker, Anthony Celestino, later joined as the band&#x27;s bassist after DeLonge recorded the bass tracks for the record.

The record is primarily based on DeLonge&#x27;s post-hardcore influences, such as Fugazi and Refused. The recording sessions were particularly difficult for him, as he had recently undergone back surgery. The record is a concept album detailing the end of the world, and features dark, moody tracks mulling over confusion. Blink-182 bassist Mark Hoppus—the only member of that band not involved in the project—felt betrayed over his lack of inclusion, which evolved into tensions between him and DeLonge, which contributed to the band&#x27;s 2005 breakup. Despite this, Hoppus provided guest vocals on the album&#x27;s twelfth track &quot;Elevator&quot;.

&quot;Box Car Racer&quot; peaked at number twelve on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 despite little promotion, and the two singles &quot;I Feel So&quot; and &quot;There Is&quot; charted on &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart, with the former hitting the top 10. The album received positive reviews from music critics, who complimented the darker direction in comparison to DeLonge&#x27;s previous work with Blink. The group toured the album in North America in late 2002 with the Used and H2O, and subsequently dissolved in 2003.

==Background==

Box Car Racer was conceived by Blink-182 guitarist/vocalist Tom DeLonge and formed during a break from touring. The trio&#x27;s European tour in the winter of 2001 was delayed in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, and rescheduled dates in early 2002 were also canceled due to DeLonge&#x27;s back problems, the result of a herniated disc. He began taking painkillers and developed &quot;neurosis-inducing side effects.&quot; DeLonge had felt &quot;bummed out&quot; and creatively stifled while recording the group&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Take Off Your Pants and Jacket&quot;. On the ensuing tour, he and Blink drummer Travis Barker would jam &quot;every day,&quot; and Barker introduced him to post-hardcore music. DeLonge had previously been derisive of any other styles of music, but soon embraced acts like Fugazi, Quicksand, Rocket from the Crypt, and Pitchfork. He began writing heavier-sounding guitar riffs; the first riff he created became part of the song &quot;All Systems Go&quot;. Barker, in his 2015 memoir &quot;Can I Say&quot;, maintains that he asked DeLonge if they should use the riffs for a new Blink album. &quot;I honestly thought that Tom had already had a conversation with [bassist Mark Hoppus] about this. They were so tight—inseparable—I couldn&#x27;t imagine Mark didn&#x27;t know,&quot; Barker writes.

For DeLonge, he had developed an &quot;itch to do something where he didn&#x27;t feel locked in to what Blink was.&quot; According to DeLonge, Box Car Racer was not &quot;meant to be a real band,&quot; but rather &quot;something to do in some spare time that was really only expected to be on the low list of the totem pole of priorities in my life, and just to have an experimental creative outlet.&quot; The project was at first solely acoustic guitar-based; he considered it in its earliest stages to be a &quot;Violent Femmes-esque acoustic record&quot;. The unnamed project went through other names, such as The Kill, and the album was initially titled &quot;Et tu, Brute?&quot;. He eventually settled on the name Box Car Racer, which was actually the name of a band Barker was in just after high school that DeLonge liked. He began writing songs about the end of the world, and connected it thematically with the biblical Book of Revelation and World War II. When reading about the war, DeLonge was &quot;freaked out&quot; to learn that Fat Man, the atomic bomb that was detonated over Nagasaki, was dropped from the B-29 bomber &quot;Bockscar&quot; (commonly misspelled Boxcar).

==Recording and production==

&quot;Box Car Racer&quot; was recorded over six weeks beginning in December 2001, primarily at Signature Sound in San Diego, California. Sessions commenced quickly, with producer Jerry Finn having sent one whole load of equipment to Signature ahead of his arrival. Barker and DeLonge worked out &quot;80 percent&quot; of the completed album in Barker&#x27;s warehouse in Corona, California, two weeks prior to recording. When the musicians entered the studio, little was changed aside from certain lyrics, according to assistant engineer Sam Boukas. Barker completed his drum tracks in one day at two recording facilities in Los Angeles prior to the Signature sessions, with all parts recorded in the first take. DeLonge invited musician David Kennedy, whom he had met in the San Diego music circuit some years prior, to perform lead guitar parts on the album. Roger Joseph Manning Jr. plays keyboards on the record.

The sessions were particularly difficult for DeLonge, who suffered chronic back pain. &quot;When your back is killing you and you have to have surgery and all this stuff, it&#x27;s just kind of hard to keep a focus on the happier times in your life,&quot; he told MTV News. &quot;You end up writing all these songs about feeling sad and confused.&quot; He often could only stand and sing for five minutes at a time before having to lay down again. Journalist Joe Shooman writes that the album followed a DIY spirit, rather than spending &quot;months and months refining and polishing everything for a major label and international pop market.&quot; DeLonge intended to pay for the project himself, but when an A&amp;R representative heard four unfinished songs, MCA—the record label Blink-182 was on—wanted to finance the album. DeLonge&#x27;s manager convinced him it would be a bad idea to pass up someone else paying for its distribution. According to Boukas, an MCA representative dropped in on the sessions and was pleased with what he heard. &quot;When we wrote this album, we didn&#x27;t know if it was going to be on a label or if we were going to put it out ourselves,&quot; Barker said at the time. &quot;Once MCA jumped on board, it was kind of like, &quot;Whatever! That&#x27;s cool. Cheers! Put it out, we don&#x27;t really care!&quot;

The project caused division in Blink-182, mostly between DeLonge and Hoppus. Hoppus was interested in being a part of the record, but DeLonge did not want it to turn into a Blink-182 album. DeLonge contended that the involvement of Barker was to refrain from having to pay a session musician. Regardless, Hoppus felt betrayed and unresolved tension dogged the band until their 2005 breakup. &quot;Nobody talked about it. It was this strange situation that nobody addressed,&quot; DeLonge told &quot;Blender&quot;. Barker felt guilty when he told Hoppus they were going to tour in support of the album: &quot;I felt like I had let him down [...] but he was ultimately more upset at Tom because they had ten years of history together &quot;before&quot; me.&quot; Despite this tension, Hoppus lent vocals to the track &quot;Elevator&quot; and shared early ideas for the next Blink-182 album. In a later Reddit AMA, Hoppus concluded, &quot;The whole situation sucked. But I sang on the track because, at the heart of it, Tom and Travis are my friends. I&#x27;m sure Tom felt the tension and asked me as an offering. I was glad to have done it, and I was glad that he asked.&quot;

==Composition and artwork==

Box Car Racer was inspired by and is partly a tribute to bands DeLonge credited as an influence, such as Quicksand, Fugazi, and Refused. Musically, it is not drastically different than Blink-182, though it puts more emphasis on &quot;slower, heavier rhythms&quot; instead of being fast-paced. Critics primarily labeled the album as pop punk, but with a few other genre categories being ascribed to the album. &quot;PopMatters&quot; described the album as a &quot;hardcore/emo/punk rock album&quot; while also describing it as a pop punk album. &quot;USA Today&quot; labeled the album as power pop. The subject matter found on &quot;Box Car Racer&quot; explores the apocalypse, conspiracy theories, and Freemasonry. The album follows a central storyline, regarding an unnamed boy during the end of the world.

Barker and DeLonge wrote the songs together. DeLonge would decide what key he would sing the song in, and Barker would mostly arrange the song, toying with its structure and tempo/time signature. As for his performance on the album, Barker considered it a &quot;totally different approach to the drums ... there are, like, jazzy bridges. ... It&#x27;s so much more open and roomy.&quot; The album&#x27;s final song, &quot;Instrumental&quot;, was removed on the cassette edition of the album and replaced with an instrumental version of &quot;I Feel So&quot;. The album&#x27;s artwork, described by Shooman, consists of &quot;bleak burgundy brown and black silhouettes plus a graffiti-esque band logo.&quot; The hidden message &quot;LNW 13 01 1&quot; is printed on the CD insert, which are coordinates pointing to Manhattan, New York. Art direction for the album was headed by Tim Stedman, with Stedman and Marcos Orozco designing the package. Keegan Gibbs was responsible for the &quot;Box Car Racer&quot; logo, while Maxx Gramajo created the tag logo artwork. Scott Heisel of Punknews.org considered the album similar to Blink-182, describing it as &quot;Blink 182 in drop D tuning&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Aaron Scott of &quot;Slant&quot; was favorable in his review of &quot;Box Car Racer&quot;, writing, &quot;Neither genre-obsessed nor intent on defying convention, &quot;Box Car Racer&quot; is the perfect union between pop-punk riffs and instrumentation that spans all rock genres from indie to folk. Finally, we have a pop band that is attempting to take advantage of the potential of its instruments.&quot; Adam Dlugacz of PopMatters summarized &quot;Box Car Racer&quot; as &quot;pretty fantastic hardcore/emo/punk rock album. It seems to re-affirm the band&#x27;s roots while proving that they are capable of more than the by-the-numbers approach of Blink. On the other hand, there&#x27;s no reason this couldn&#x27;t have been a Blink-182 album.&quot; Robert Morast from &quot;Argus Leader&quot; felt the same, commenting, &quot;The music is good with brooding melodies that fester inside the soul. But for DeLonge, it just sounds like he&#x27;s lost searching for his other half.&quot;

Edna Gunderson of &quot;USA Today&quot; was positive, commenting, &quot;The music, while upbeat and even giddy, steers away from adolescent pranks and pratfalls, a welcome upgrade. The band creates a fresh breed of post-punk power pop by roughing up bright melodies.&quot; AllMusic&#x27;s Brian O&#x27;Neill gave the album three stars, calling it a &quot;far cry from the party-boy ethos DeLonge is best known for, and he wears the emotional depth well, with songs that are just as hooky as from his bread-winning main squeeze.&quot; A reviewer for &quot;Q&quot; admitted that the musicians &quot;confound expectations with a very good record.&quot; The positive reception of the album was in contrast to the reviews for Blink, which were often negative. &quot;I think it&#x27;s a cop-out for [critics] to like the music I do,&quot; DeLonge told the &quot;Arizona Daily Star&quot;. &quot;Critics can&#x27;t say they like Blink or give us any credit, &#x27;cause we&#x27;re out there goofing around.&quot; Barker was more critical: &quot;I especially don&#x27;t care what the critics say. Most of them are like 50 years old and they&#x27;re not really educated in what kind of music we&#x27;re playing to begin with!&quot; Scott Heisel of Punknews.org denounced the album as &quot;completely and utterly forgettable&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Box Car Racer&quot; was released worldwide on May 21, 2002, by MCA Records. The album debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number 12 on May 30, 2002, selling 65,000 copies in its first week. The numbers were considered surprising given that the album had virtually no promotion. &quot;The overall response to this album has been ridiculous. We didn&#x27;t have much push or anything, we didn&#x27;t do a whole lot of promo before the album came out and it still did really well,&quot; said Barker. As of August 2002, it had sold 244,000 copies in the U.S., according to Nielsen SoundScan. Internationally, the album charted best in Canada, where it peaked at number seven. In 2006, the album was certified gold in Canada for shipments of 50,000 copies.

&quot;I Feel So&quot; was the album&#x27;s first single. The music video for the song, which is mainly performance-based, was co-directed by DeLonge and Nathan &quot;Karma&quot; Cox. The song was the band&#x27;s highest-charting single, peaking at number eight on &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart in June 2002. &quot;There Is&quot; was issued as the album&#x27;s second and final single, and peaked at number 32 on the same chart in November 2002. The music video for that song was inspired by the film &quot;Say Anything...&quot; (1989), and was directed by Alexander Kosta. Both videos, as well as bonus footage, were included on a self-titled DVD, which was released November 2002.

==Touring==

To support the album, the project morphed into a full band, with Barker, DeLonge, and Kennedy. Barker invited his friend Anthony Celestino to play bass. He had initially wanted Alex Barreto, who was in the original Box Car Racer, to be a part of the &quot;second version&quot; of the band, but he could not get in touch with him. They played their first four shows in April 2002. The group commenced a full-scale tour behind the album in October 2002, with 22 North American shows supported by the Used and H2O.

Though DeLonge would joke around at shows, as he was known for doing with Blink-182, the overall mood was much different. &quot;With Blink, I can&#x27;t wait until I get done playing a song so I can say something stupid. With this band I hardly talk at all,&quot; he told &quot;Las Vegas Weekly&quot;. He expounded upon this in another interview: &quot;It&#x27;s a much more powerful, emotional experience than it is with Blink. To play songs and have them showcased to where it represents what this kind of music is all about is a welcome experience. It&#x27;s not about anything but the music itself.&quot;

==Aftermath==
In a 2003 interview with &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, DeLonge claimed the album was only an attempt to &quot;challenge myself to do different shit&quot;: &quot;I did it for myself, whether it sold a million copies or just one, it was for myself.&quot; He clarified the band&#x27;s future succinctly: &quot;There are a lot of emotions between Mark and I and that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s never going to be another Box Car Racer album. It was never meant to be something that would alienate anybody.&quot; The article&#x27;s author, Tom Bryant, describes the album&#x27;s effect on subsequent Blink-182 albums: &quot;It allowed [DeLonge], and therefore the band, to assess whether, approaching or in their 30s, they still really wanted to be writing songs about splitting up from teenage sweethearts or whether it was time to address something a little more serious and a little more important.&quot;

<doc id="184158" wikidata="Q1364697" url="?curid=184158" title="Iris (2001 film)">
<text>Iris is a 2001 biographical drama film about novelist Iris Murdoch and her relationship with her husband John Bayley. Directed by Richard Eyre from a screenplay he co-wrote with Charles Wood, the film is based on Bayley&#x27;s 1999 memoir &quot;Elegy for Iris&quot;. Judi Dench and Jim Broadbent portray Murdoch and Bayley during the later stages of their marriage, while Kate Winslet and Hugh Bonneville appear as the couple in their younger years. The film contrasts the start of their relationship, when Murdoch was an outgoing, dominant individual compared to the timid and scholarly Bayley, and their later life, when Murdoch was suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and tended to by a frustrated Bayley in their North Oxford home in Charlbury Road. The beach scenes were filmed at Southwold in Suffolk, one of Murdoch&#x27;s favourite haunts.

The film had its world premiere in Los Angeles on 14 December 2001, followed by a theatrical release in the United Kingdom on 18 January 2002 and in the United States on 29 March. It grossed $16 million on a $5.5 million budget and received positive reviews, with praise towards the performances. For his role as Bayley, Broadbent won Best Supporting Actor at the 74th Academy Awards, with Dench (Best Actress) and Winslet (Best Supporting Actress) also receiving nominations.

==Plot==
When the young Iris Murdoch meets fellow student John Bayley at Somerville College, Oxford, he is a naive virgin easily flummoxed by her libertine spirit, arch personality, and obvious artistic talent. Decades later, little has changed and the couple keep house, with John doting on his more famous wife. When Iris begins experiencing forgetfulness and dementia, however, the devoted John struggles with hopelessness and frustration. He becomes her carer, as his wife&#x27;s mind deteriorates from the ravages of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

==Cast==
==Reception==
Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 79% of 110 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;A solidly constructed drama, &quot;Iris&quot; is greatly elevated by the strength of its four lead performances.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 76 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

<text>David Royston Bailey (born 2 January 1938) is an English photographer and director, most widely known for his fashion photography and portraiture, and role in shaping the image of the Swinging Sixties. Bailey has also directed several television commercials and documentaries.

== Early life ==
David Royston Bailey was born at Whipps Cross University Hospital, Leytonstone, to Herbert Bailey, a tailor&#x27;s cutter, and his wife Gladys, a machinist. From the age of three he lived in East Ham.

Bailey developed a love of natural history, and this led him into photography. As he had undiagnosed dyslexia, he experienced problems at school. He attended a private school, &quot;Clark&#x27;s College&quot; in Ilford, where he says they taught him less than the more basic council school. As well as dyslexia he also has the motor skill disorder dyspraxia (developmental coordination disorder).

In one school year, he claims he only attended 33 times. He left school on his fifteenth birthday, to become a copy boy at the Fleet Street offices of the &quot;Yorkshire Post&quot;. He raced through a series of dead end jobs, before his call up for national service in 1956, serving with the Royal Air Force in Singapore in 1957. The appropriation of his trumpet forced him to consider other creative outlets, and he bought a Rolleiflex camera.

He was demobbed in August 1958, and determined to pursue a career in photography, he bought a Canon rangefinder camera. Unable to obtain a place at the London College of Printing because of his school record, he became a second assistant to David Ollins, in Charlotte Mews. He earned £3 10s (£3.50) a week, and acted as studio dogsbody. He was delighted to be called to an interview with photographer John French.

==Professional career==

In 1959, Bailey became a photographic assistant at the John French studio, and in May 1960, he was a photographer for John Cole&#x27;s Studio Five, before being contracted as a fashion photographer for British &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine later that year. He also undertook a large amount of freelance work.

Along with Terence Donovan and Brian Duffy, Bailey captured and helped create the &#x27;Swinging London&#x27; of the 1960s: a culture of fashion and celebrity chic. The three photographers socialised with actors, musicians and royalty, and found themselves elevated to celebrity status. Together, they were the first real celebrity photographers, named by Norman Parkinson &quot;the Black Trinity&quot;.

In 1966 Bailey directed the short film &quot;G.G. Passion&quot;.

The film &quot;Blowup&quot; (1966), directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, depicts the life of a London fashion photographer who is played by David Hemmings, whose character was inspired by Bailey. The &quot;Swinging London&quot; scene was aptly reflected in his &quot;Box of Pin-Ups&quot; (1964): a box of poster-prints of 1960s celebrities including Terence Stamp, The Beatles, Mick Jagger, Jean Shrimpton, P. J. Proby, Cecil Beaton, Rudolf Nureyev and East End gangsters, the Kray twins. The &quot;Box&quot; was an unusual and unique commercial release. It reflected the changing status of the photographer that one could sell a collection of prints in this way. Strong objection to the presence of the Krays by fellow photographer, Lord Snowdon, was the major reason no American edition of the &quot;Box&quot; was released, and that a second British edition was not issued. The record sale for a copy of &#x27;Box of Pin-Ups&#x27; is reported as &quot;north of £20,000&quot;.

At &quot;Vogue&quot; Bailey was shooting covers within months, and, at the height of his productivity, he shot 800 pages of &quot;Vogue&quot; editorial in one year. Penelope Tree, a former girlfriend, described him as &quot;the king lion on the Savannah: incredibly attractive, with a dangerous vibe. He was the electricity, the brightest, most powerful, most talented, most energetic force at the magazine&quot;.

American &quot;Vogue&quot;″s creative director Grace Coddington, then a model herself, said &quot;It was the Sixties, it was a raving time, and Bailey was unbelievably good-looking. He was everything that you wanted him to be – like the Beatles but accessible – and when he went on the market everyone went in. We were all killing ourselves to be his model, although he hooked up with Jean Shrimpton pretty quickly&quot;.

Of model Jean Shrimpton, Bailey said: 

Bailey was hired in 1970 by Island Records&#x27; Chris Blackwell to shoot publicity photos of Cat Stevens for his upcoming album &quot;Tea for the Tillerman&quot;. Stevens, who is now known as Yusuf Islam maintains that he disliked having his photo on the cover of his albums, as had previously been the case, although he allowed Bailey&#x27;s photographs to be placed on the inner sleeve of the album. Bailey also photographed album sleeve art for musicians including The Rolling Stones and Marianne Faithfull.

Bailey directed and produced the TV documentaries &quot;Beaton&quot; (1971) on Cecil Beaton, &quot;Visconti&quot; (1972) on Luchino Visconti, and &quot;Warhol&quot; (1973) on Andy Warhol. 

In 1972, rock singer Alice Cooper was photographed by Bailey for &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine, almost naked apart from a snake. Cooper used Bailey the following year to shoot for the group&#x27;s chart topping &quot;Billion Dollar Babies&quot; album. The shoot included a baby wearing shocking eye makeup and, supposedly, one billion dollars in cash requiring the shoot to be under armed guard. In 1976, Bailey published &quot;Ritz Newspaper&quot; together with David Litchfield. In 1985, Bailey was photographing stars at the Live Aid concert at Wembley Stadium. As he recalled later: &quot;The atmosphere on the day was great. At one point I got a tap on my shoulder and spun round. Suddenly there was a big tongue down my throat! It was Freddie Mercury.&quot;

In 1992, Bailey directed the BBC drama &quot;Who Dealt?&quot; starring Juliet Stevenson, story by Ring Lardner. In 1995 he directed and wrote the South Bank Film &quot;The Lady is a Tramp&quot; featuring his wife Catherine Bailey. In 1998 he directed a documentary with Ginger Television Production, &quot;Models Close Up&quot;, commissioned by Channel 4 Television.

In 2012, the BBC made a film of the story of his 1962 New York photoshoot with Jean Shrimpton, entitled &quot;We&#x27;ll Take Manhattan&quot;, starring Aneurin Barnard as Bailey.

In October 2013, Bailey took part in Art Wars at the Saatchi Gallery curated by Ben Moore. The artist was issued with a stormtrooper helmet, which he transformed into a work of art. Proceeds went to the Missing Tom Fund set up by Ben Moore to find his brother Tom who has been missing for over ten years. The work was also shown on the Regents Park platform as part of Art Below Regents Park.

In October 2020 Bailey&#x27;s memoir &quot;Look Again&quot; in co-operation with author James Fox was published by Macmillan Books, a review on his life and work.

== Fashion ==
Bailey began working with fashion brand Jaeger in the late 1950s when Jean Muir landed the role of designer. After working alongside other fashion photographers such as the late Norman Parkinson, Bailey was officially commissioned by &quot;Vogue&quot; in 1962.

His first shoot in New York City was of young model Jean Shrimpton, who wore a range of Jaeger and Susan Small clothing, including a camel suit with a green blouse and a suede coat worn with kitten heels. The shoot was titled &#x27;Young Idea Goes West&#x27;.

After 53 years Bailey returned to Jaeger to shoot their AW15 campaign. As menswear subject; James Penfold modelled tailored tweed blazers and a camel coat. Also on the shoot was model, philanthropist and film director Elisa Sednaoui along with &quot;GQ&quot; magazine&#x27;s most stylish male 2003, Martin Gardner.

==Painting and sculpture==
Bailey paints and sculpts. Some of his sculptures were shown in London in 2010, and paintings and mixed media works were shown in October 2011.

==TV appearances==
In the 1970s Bailey lost some equipment in a robbery and replaced it with the new Olympus OM system 
equipment which was substantially smaller and lighter than contemporary competitors&#x27; equipment. He then appeared in advertising promoting the Olympus OM-1 35 mm single lens reflex camera. He subsequently appeared in a series of UK TV commercials for the Olympus Trip camera.

==Personal life==
Bailey was married in 1960 to Rosemary Bramble. In 1965, he and actress Catherine Deneuve were married. They divorced in 1972. In 1975, Bailey married American fashion model and writer Marie Helvin. Following their divorce, he married model Catherine Dyer in 1986.

Bailey&#x27;s company is in London. His wife and their photographer son, Fenton Fox Bailey, are directors. The family maintains a home on Dartmoor, near Plymouth.

<text>William Lendrum Mitchell (December 29, 1879 – February 19, 1936) was a United States Army officer who had a major role in the creation of the United States Air Force.

Mitchell served in France during World War I and, by the conflict&#x27;s end, commanded all American air combat units in that country. After the war, he was appointed deputy director of the Air Service and began advocating for increased investment in air power, believing that this would prove vital in future wars. He argued particularly for the ability of bombers to sink battleships and organized a series of bombing runs against stationary ships designed to test the idea.

He antagonized many administrative leaders of the Army with his arguments and criticism and in 1925, his temporary appointment as a brigadier general was not renewed, and he reverted to his permanent rank of colonel, due to his insubordination. Later that year, he was court-martialed for insubordination after accusing Army and Navy leaders of an &quot;almost treasonable administration of the national defense&quot; for investing in battleships. He resigned from the service shortly afterwards.

Mitchell received many honors following his death, including a Congressional Gold Medal. He is also the first person for whom an American military aircraft design, the North American B-25 Mitchell, is named. Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, is also named after Mitchell.

==Early life==
Born in Nice, France, to John L. Mitchell, a wealthy Wisconsin senator, and his wife Harriet Danforth (Becker), Mitchell grew up on an estate in North Greenfield, Wisconsin, which is now the Milwaukee suburb of West Allis, Wisconsin. Mitchell&#x27;s father served in the American Civil War as a first lieutenant in the 24th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment along with future general Arthur MacArthur (the father of General Douglas MacArthur). The elder Mitchell served as a United States senator from 1883 to 1889.

His paternal grandfather, Alexander Mitchell, a Scotsman, established what became the Milwaukee Road railroad and the Marine Bank of Wisconsin. Mitchell Park and the shopping precinct of Mitchell Street were named in honor of Alexander. His paternal grandmother, Martha Reed Mitchell, was well known in charity, art and society circles.

Mitchell&#x27;s sister Ruth fought with the Chetniks in Yugoslavia during World War II and later wrote a book about her brother, &quot;My Brother Bill&quot;.

Mitchell was accepted into Columbian University (later renamed George Washington University) in Washington, D.C., but dropped out to join the United States Army during the Spanish-American War, though he eventually graduated from the school. While there he was a member of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. Upon dropping out of Columbian at age 18, he enlisted in the United States Army as a private and was mustered into Company M of the 1st Wisconsin Infantry Regiment on May 14, 1898. Mitchell was immediately assigned and mobilized into Brigadier General Arthur MacArthur&#x27;s command in the Philippines, where MacArthur was placed in charge of the Department of Northern Luzon in the spring of 1899. Mitchell participated in operations against Filipino insurgents in northern and central Luzon at the end of the Spanish-American War and during the Philippine–American War. He quickly gained a commission due to his father&#x27;s influence and joined the U.S. Army Signal Corps.

Following the cessation of hostilities, Mitchell remained in the Army. From 1900 to 1904, Mitchell was posted in the District of Alaska as a lieutenant in the Signal Corps. On May 26, 1900, the United States Congress appropriated $450,000 to establish a communications system connecting the many isolated and widely separated U.S. Army outposts and civilian Gold Rush camps in Alaska by telegraph. Along with Captain George C. Brunnell, Lieutenant Mitchell oversaw the construction of what became known as the Washington-Alaska Military Cable and Telegraph System (WAMCATS). He predicted as early as 1906, while an instructor at the Army&#x27;s Signal School in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, that future conflicts would take place in the air, not on the ground.

In 1908, as a young Signal Corps officer, Mitchell observed Orville Wright&#x27;s flying demonstration at Fort Myer, Virginia. Mitchell took flight lessons at the Curtiss Flying School at Newport News, Virginia.

In March 1912, after assignments in the Philippines that saw him tour battlefields of the Russo-Japanese War and conclude that war with Japan was inevitable one day, Mitchell was one of 21 officers selected to serve on the General Staff—at the time, its youngest member at age 32. He appeared in August 1913 at legislative hearings considering a bill to make Army aviation a branch separate from the Signal Corps and testified against the bill. As the only Signal Corps officer on the General Staff, he was chosen as temporary head of the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps, a predecessor of the present day United States Air Force, in May 1916, when its head was reprimanded and relieved of duty for malfeasance in the section. Mitchell administered the section until the new head, Lieutenant Colonel George O. Squier, arrived from attaché duties in London, England, where World War I was in progress, then became his permanent assistant. In June, he took private flying lessons at the Curtiss Flying School because he was proscribed by law from aviator training by age and rank, at an expense to himself of $1,470 (approximately $33,000 in 2015). In July 1916, he was promoted to major and appointed Chief of the Air Service of the First Army.

==World War I==
When the United States declared war on Germany on April 6, 1917, Mitchell was in Spain &quot;en route&quot; to France as an observer. He arrived in Paris on April 10, and set up an office for the Aviation Section from which he collaborated extensively with British and French air leaders such as General Hugh Trenchard, studying their strategies as well as their aircraft. On April 24, he made the first flight by an American officer over German lines, flying with a French pilot. Before long, Mitchell had gained enough experience to begin preparations for American air operations. Mitchell rapidly earned a reputation as a daring, flamboyant, and tireless leader. In May, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. He was promoted to the temporary rank of colonel on October 10, 1917, to rank from August 5.

In September 1918, he planned and led nearly 1,500 British, French, and Italian aircraft in the air phase of the Battle of Saint-Mihiel, one of the first coordinated air-ground offensives in history. He was elevated to the rank of (temporary) brigadier general on October 14, 1918, and commanded all American air combat units in France. He ended the war as Chief of Air Service and Chief Group of Armies.

Recognized as one of the top American combat airmen of the war alongside aces such as his good friend, Eddie Rickenbacker, he was probably the best-known American in Europe. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the Distinguished Service Medal, the World War I Victory Medal with eight campaign clasps, and several foreign decorations. Despite his superb leadership and his fine combat record, he alienated many of his superiors during and after his 18 months of service in France.

==Post-war advocate of air power==

===Return from Europe===


Mitchell returned to the United States in January 1919; it had been widely expected throughout the Air Service that he would receive the post-war assignment of Director of Air Service. Instead, he returned to find that Maj. Gen. Charles T. Menoher, an artilleryman who had commanded the Rainbow Division in France, had been appointed director on the recommendation of his classmate General John Pershing, to maintain operational control of aviation by the ground forces.

Mitchell received appointment on February 28, 1919, as Director of Military Aeronautics, to head the flying component of the Air Service, but that office was in name only as it was a wartime agency that would expire six months after the signing of a peace treaty. Menoher instituted a reorganization of the Air Service based on the divisional system of the AEF, eliminating the DMA as an organization, and Mitchell was assigned as third assistant executive, in charge of the Training and Operations Group, Office of Director of Air Service (ODAS), in April 1919. He maintained his temporary wartime rank of brigadier general until June 18, 1920, when he was reduced to lieutenant colonel, Signal Corps (Menoher was reduced to brigadier general in the same orders).

When the Army was reorganized by Congress on June 4, 1920, the Air Service was recognized as a combatant arm of the line, third in size behind the Infantry and Artillery. On July 1, 1920, Mitchell was promoted to the Regular Army (i.e., permanent) rank of colonel in the Signal Corps, but also received a recess appointment (as did Menoher) on July 16 to become Assistant Chief of Air Service with the rank of brigadier general. On July 30, 1920, he was transferred and promoted to the permanent rank of colonel, Air Service, with date of rank from July 1, placing him first in seniority among all Air Service branch officers. On March 4, 1921, Mitchell was appointed Assistant Chief of Air Service by new President Warren G. Harding with consent of the Senate. On April 27, Mitchell was reappointed as a brigadier general with date of rank retroactive to July 2, 1920.

Mitchell did not share in the common belief that World War I would be the war to end war. &quot;If a nation ambitious for universal conquest gets off to a flying start in a war of the future&quot;, he said, &quot;it may be able to control the whole world more easily than a nation has controlled a continent in the past.&quot;

He returned from Europe with a fervent belief that within a near future, possibly within ten years, air power would become the predominant force of war, and that it should be united entirely in an independent air force equal to the Army and Navy. He found encouragement in a number of bills before Congress proposing a Department of Aeronautics that included an air force separate from either the Army or Navy, primarily legislation introduced concurrently in August 1919 by Senator Harry New of Indiana and Representative Charles F. Curry of California, influenced by the recommendations of a fact-finding commission sent to Europe under the direction of Assistant Secretary of War Benedict Crowell in early 1919 that contradicted the findings of Army boards and advocated an independent air force.

===Friction with the Navy===
Mitchell believed that the use of floating bases was necessary to defend the nation against naval threats, but the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral William S. Benson, had dissolved Naval Aeronautics as an organization early in 1919, a decision later reversed by Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Franklin D. Roosevelt. However, senior naval aviators feared that land-based aviators in a &quot;unified&quot; independent air force would no more understand the requirements of sea-based aviation than ground forces commanders understood the capabilities and potential of air power, and vigorously resisted any alliance with Mitchell.

The Navy&#x27;s civilian leadership was equally opposed, if for other reasons. On April 3, Mitchell met with Roosevelt and a board of admirals to discuss aviation, and Mitchell urged the development of naval aviation because of the growing obsolescence of the surface fleet. His assurances that the Air Service could develop whatever bomb was needed to sink a battleship, and that a national defense organization of land, sea, and air components was essential and inevitable, were met with cool hostility. Mitchell found his ideas publicly denounced as &quot;pernicious&quot; by Roosevelt. Convinced that within as soon as ten years strategic air bombardment would become a threat to the United States and make the Air Service the nation&#x27;s first line of defense instead of the Navy, he began to set out to prove that aircraft were capable of sinking ships to reinforce his position.

His relations with superiors continued to sour as he began to criticize both the War and Navy departments for being insufficiently farsighted regarding air power. He advocated the development of a number of aircraft innovations, including bomb-sights, sled-runner landing gear for winter operations, engine superchargers, and aerial torpedoes. He ordered the use of aircraft in fighting forest fires and border patrols. He also encouraged the staging of a transcontinental air race, a flight around the perimeter of the United States. He also encouraged Army pilots to break aviation records for speed, endurance and altitude. In short, he encouraged anything that would further develop the use of aircraft, and that would keep aviation in the news.

==Project B: Anti-ship bombing demonstration==
In February 1921, at the urging of Mitchell, who was anxious to test his theories of destruction of ships by aerial bombing, Secretary of War Newton Baker and Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels agreed to a series of joint Army-Navy exercises, known as Project B, to be held that summer in which surplus or captured ships could be used as targets.
Mitchell was concerned that the building of dreadnoughts was taking precious defense dollars away from military aviation. He was convinced that a force of anti-shipping airplanes could defend a coastline with more economy than a combination of coastal guns and naval vessels. A thousand bombers could be built at the same cost as one battleship, and could sink that battleship. Mitchell infuriated the Navy by claiming he could sink ships &quot;under war conditions&quot;, and boasted he could prove it if he were permitted to bomb captured German battleships.

The Navy reluctantly agreed to the demonstration after news leaked of its own tests. To counter Mitchell, the Navy had sunk the old battleship near Tangier Island, Virginia, on November 1, 1920, using its own airplanes. Daniels had hoped to squelch Mitchell by releasing a report on the results written by Captain William D. Leahy stating that, &quot;The entire experiment pointed to the improbability of a modern battleship being either destroyed or completely put out of action by aerial bombs.&quot; When the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; revealed that the Navy&#x27;s &quot;tests&quot; were done with dummy sand bombs and that the ship was actually sunk using high explosives placed on the ship, Congress introduced two resolutions urging new tests and backed the Navy into a corner.

In the arrangements for the new tests, there was to be a news blackout until all data had been analyzed at which point only the official news report would be released; Mitchell felt that the Navy was going to bury the results. The Chief of the Air Corps attempted to have Mitchell dismissed a week before the tests began, reacting to Navy complaints about Mitchell&#x27;s criticisms, but the new Secretary of War John W. Weeks backed down when it became apparent that Mitchell had widespread public and media support.

===1st Provisional Air Brigade===
On May 1, 1921, Mitchell assembled the 1st Provisional Air Brigade, an air and ground crew of 125 aircraft and 1,000 men at Langley Field in Hampton, Virginia, using six squadrons from the Air Service:
* Air Service Field Officers School, Langley Field, Virginia, (SE-5 fighters)
** 50th Squadron (Observation)
** 88th Squadron
* 2nd Bombardment Group (later 2nd Bomb Group), Kelly Field, Texas (SE-5 fighters, Martin NBS-1, Handley-Page O/400, and Caproni CA-5 bombers)
** 49th Squadron (Bombardment)
** 96th Squadron (Bombardment)
* 7th Observation Group (Second Corps Area), (now the 7th Operations Group), Mitchel Field, New York (DH-4 and Douglas O-2 observation planes)
** 1st Squadron (Observation)
** 5th Squadron (Observation)

Mitchell took command on May 27 after testing bombs, fuses, and other equipment at Aberdeen Proving Ground and began training in anti-ship bombing techniques. Alexander Seversky, a veteran Russian pilot who had bombed German ships in the Great War, joined the effort, suggesting the bombers aim &quot;near&quot; the ships so that expanding water pressure from the underwater blasts would stave in and separate hull plates. Further discussion with Captain Alfred Wilkinson Johnson, Commander, Naval Air Force U.S. Atlantic Fleet aboard USS &quot;Shawmut&quot;, confirmed that near-miss bombs would inflict more damage than direct hits; near-misses would cause an underwater concussive effect against the hull.

===Rules of engagement===

The Navy and the Air Service were at cross purposes regarding the tests. Supported by General Pershing, the Navy set rules and conditions that enhanced the survivability of the targets, stating that the purpose of the tests was to determine how much damage ships could withstand. The ships had to be sunk in at least 100 fathoms of water (so as not to become navigational hazards), and the Navy chose an area off the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay rather than either of two possible closer areas, minimizing the effective time the Army&#x27;s bombers would have in the target area. The planes were forbidden from using aerial torpedoes, would be permitted only two hits on the battleship using their heaviest bombs, and would have to stop between hits so that a damage assessment party could go aboard. Smaller ships could not be struck by bombs larger than 600 pounds, and also were subject to the same interruptions in attacks.

Mitchell held to the Navy&#x27;s restrictions for the tests of June 21, July 13, and July 18, and successfully sank the ex-German destroyer &quot;G-102&quot; and the ex-German light cruiser in concert with Navy aircraft. On each of these demonstrations the ships were first attacked by SE-5 fighters strafing and bombing the decks of the ships with 25-pound anti-personnel bombs to simulate suppression of antiaircraft fire, followed by attacks from Martin NBS-1 (Martin MB-2) twin-engine bombers using high explosive demolition bombs. Mitchell observed the attacks from the controls of his DH-4 aircraft, nicknamed &quot;The Osprey&quot;.

===Sinking of the &quot;Ostfriesland&quot;===


On July 20, 1921, the Navy brought out the ex-German World War I battleship, . On the scheduled day, bomb attacks by Navy, Marine Corps, and Army aircraft settled the &quot;Ostfriesland&quot; three feet by the stern with a five-degree list to port. She was taking on water. Further bombing was delayed a day, the Navy claiming due to rough seas that prevented their Board of Observers from going aboard, the Air Service countering that as the Army bombers approached, they were ordered not to attack. Mitchell&#x27;s bombers were forced to circle for 47 minutes, as a result of which they dropped only half their bombs, and none of their large bombs.

On the morning of July 21, in accordance with a strictly orchestrated schedule of attacks, five Martin NBS-1 bombers led by 1st Lt. Clayton Bissell dropped a single bomb each, scoring three direct hits. The Navy stopped further drops, although the Army bombers had nine bombs remaining, to assess damage. By noon, &quot;Ostfriesland&quot; had settled two more feet by the stern and one foot by the bow.

At this point, Capt. Walter R. Lawson&#x27;s flight of bombers, consisting of two Handley-Page O/400 and six Martin NBS-1 bombers loaded with bombs, was dispatched. One Handley Page dropped out for mechanical reasons, but the NBS-1s dropped six bombs in quick succession between 12:18 pm and 12:31 pm. Bomb aiming points were for the water near the ship. Mitchell described Lawson&#x27;s attack, &quot;Four bombs hit in rapid succession, close alongside the Ostfriesland. We could see her rise eight to ten feet between the terrific blows from under water. On the fourth shot, Capt Streett, sitting in the back seat of my plane stood up and waving both arms shouted, &quot;She is gone!&quot; There were no direct hits but at least three of the bombs landed close enough to rip hull plates as well as cause the ship to roll over. The ship sank at 12:40 pm, 22 minutes after the first bomb, with a seventh bomb dropped by the Handley Page on the foam rising up from the sinking ship. Nearby the site, observing, were various foreign and domestic officials aboard the .

Although Mitchell had stressed &quot;war-time conditions&quot;, the tests were under static conditions and the sinking of the &quot;Ostfriesland&quot; was accomplished by violating rules agreed upon by General Pershing that would have allowed Navy engineers to examine the effects of smaller munitions. Navy studies of the wreck of the &quot;Ostfriesland&quot; show she had suffered little topside damage from bombs and was sunk by progressive flooding that might have been stemmed by a fast-acting damage control party on board the vessel. Mitchell used the sinking for his own publicity purposes, though his results were downplayed in public by General of the Armies John J. Pershing who hoped to smooth Army/Navy relations. The efficacy of the tests remains in debate to this day.

Nevertheless, the test was highly influential at the time, causing budgets to be redrawn for further air development and forcing the Navy to look more closely at the possibilities of naval air power.
Despite the advantages enjoyed by the bombers in the artificial exercise, Mitchell&#x27;s report stressed points which would later be highly influential in war:
The fact of battleship sinking was indisputable, and Mitchell repeated the performance twice in tests conducted with like results on the U.S. pre-dreadnought battleships in September 1921, and the and in September 1923. The latter two ships were subjected to teargas attacks and hit with specially designed demolition bombs.

===Aftermath of the bombing tests===

The bombing tests had several immediate and turbulent results. Almost immediately the Navy and President Harding were incensed by an apparent demonstration of naval weakness just after Harding had announced, on July 10, invitations to other naval powers to gather in Washington for a conference on the limitation of naval armaments. Statements asserting the obsolescence of the battleship by disarmament proponents in Congress such as Senator William Borah heightened official anxiety. Both services tried to defuse the results by reports from the Joint Board and General Pershing dismissing Mitchell&#x27;s claims and suppressing his report, but the report was leaked to the press.

In September, General Charles T. Menoher forced a showdown over Mitchell as the bombing tests continued. Menoher confronted Secretary Weeks and demanded that Weeks either relieve Mitchell as Assistant Chief of Air Corps or he would resign. On October 4, Weeks allowed Menoher to resign and return to the ground forces &quot;for personal reasons&quot;. A reciprocal resignation offer from Mitchell was refused.

Major General Mason Patrick was again chosen by Pershing to sort out a mess in the Air Service and became the new chief on October 5. Patrick made it clear to Mitchell that although he would accept Mitchell&#x27;s expertise as counsel, all decisions would be made by Patrick. When Mitchell soon got into a minor but embarrassing protocol rift with Rear Admiral William A. Moffett at the start of the naval arms limitation conference, Patrick assigned him to an inspection tour of Europe with Alfred V. Verville and Lieutenant Clayton Bissell that lasted the duration of the conference over the winter of 1921–22.

==West Virginia==

Mitchell was dispatched by President Harding to West Virginia to stop the warfare that had broken out between the United Mine Workers, Stone Mountain Coal Company, the Baldwin–Felts Detective Agency, and other groups after the Matewan Massacre. Miners outraged by the ambush slaying of Matewan Police Chief Sid Hatfield by agents for the coal company marched on Mingo and Logan County leading to the Battle of Blair Mountain, August 25 to September 2, 1921. On August 26, Mitchell commanded Army bombers from Maryland to Charleston, West Virginia. Mitchell told the press that Army bombers alone could end the &quot;Mingo War&quot; by dropping tear gas on the miners. A private army of 3,000 led by Sheriff Don Chafin and financed by the Coal Operators Association engaged in gun battles and used private planes to drop dynamite charges and World War I surplus gas and explosive bombs against an estimated 13,000 miners. Neither side responded to President Harding&#x27;s August 30 proclamation to cease hostilities. In the last days of the civil disturbance, Mitchell&#x27;s bombers flew several reconnaissance missions but did not engage in combat; one bomber crashed on a return flight, killing three crew members. On September 3, surrounded by 2,000 Army troops, Chafin&#x27;s force dispersed and most miners went home although some surrendered to the Army. Later, Mitchell cited the &quot;Mingo War&quot; as an example of the potential for air power in civil disturbances.

==Promoting air power==
In 1922, while in Europe for General Patrick, Mitchell met the Italian air power theorist Giulio Douhet and soon afterwards an excerpted translation of Douhet&#x27;s &quot;The Command of the Air&quot; began to circulate in the Air Service. In 1924, Gen. Patrick again dispatched him on an inspection tour, this time to Hawaii and Asia, to get him off the front pages. Mitchell came back with a 324-page report that predicted future war with Japan, including the attack on Pearl Harbor. Of note, Mitchell discounted the value of aircraft carriers in an attack on the Hawaiian Islands, believing they were of little practical use because they could not operate effectively on the high seas or deliver &quot;sufficient aircraft in the air at one time to insure a concentrated operation&quot;. Instead, Mitchell believed a surprise attack on the Hawaiian Islands would be conducted by land-based aircraft operating from islands in the Pacific. His report, published in 1925 as the book &quot;Winged Defense&quot;, foretold wider benefits of an investment in air power, believing it to be, at both that time and in the future, &quot;a dominating factor in the world&#x27;s development&quot;, both for national defense and economic benefit. &quot;Winged Defense&quot; sold only 4,500 copies between August 1925 and January 1926, the months surrounding the publicity of the court martial, and so Mitchell did not reach a wide audience.

===Friction and demotion===
Mitchell experienced difficulties within the Army, notably with his superiors when he appeared before the Lampert Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives and sharply castigated Army and Navy leadership. The War Department had endorsed a proposal to establish a &quot;General Headquarters Air Force&quot; as a vehicle for modernization and expansion of the Air Service, to be funded through shared appropriations for aviation with the Navy, but shelved the plan when the Navy refused, incensing Mitchell.

In March 1925, when Mitchell&#x27;s term as Assistant Chief of the Air Service expired, he reverted to his permanent rank of colonel and was transferred to San Antonio, Texas, as air officer to the Eighth Corps Area. Although such demotions were not unusual in demobilizations (Patrick himself had gone from major general to colonel upon returning to the Army Corps of Engineers in 1919), the move was widely seen as punishment and exile, since Mitchell had petitioned to remain as Assistant Chief when his term expired, and his transfer to an assignment with no political influence at a relatively unimportant Army base had been directed by Secretary of War John Weeks.

==Court-martial==

In response to the Navy&#x27;s first helium-filled rigid airship crashing in a storm in September 1925, killing 14 of the crew, and the loss of three seaplanes on a flight from the West Coast to Hawaii, Mitchell issued a statement accusing senior leaders in the Army and Navy of incompetence and &quot;almost treasonable administration of the national defense.&quot; In October 1925, a charge with eight specifications was proffered against Mitchell on the direct order of President Calvin Coolidge, accusing him of violation of the 96th Article of War, an omnibus article that Mitchell&#x27;s chief counsel, Congressman Frank Reid, declared to be unconstitutional as a violation of free speech. The court-martial began in early November and lasted for seven weeks.

The youngest of the 13 judges was Major General Douglas MacArthur, who later described the order to sit on Mitchell&#x27;s court-martial as &quot;one of the most distasteful orders I ever received.&quot; Of the thirteen judges, (Charles Pelot Summerall, William S. Graves, Robert L. Howze, MacArthur, Benjamin A. Poore, Fred W. Sladen, Ewing E. Booth, Albert J. Bowley, George Irwin, Edward K. King, Frank R. McCoy, Edwin B. Winans, and Blanton Winship), none had aviation experience and three (Summerall, who was the president of the court, Sladen, and Bowley) were removed by defense challenges for bias. The case was then presided over by Major General Robert Lee Howze. Among those who testified for Mitchell were Eddie Rickenbacker, Hap Arnold, Carl Spaatz, Ira Eaker, Robert Olds, Thomas George Lanphier Sr. and Fiorello La Guardia. The trial attracted significant interest, and public opinion supported Mitchell. The chief prosecutors were Major Allen W. Gullion, Lieutenant Joseph L. McMullen, and Colonel Sherman Moreland.

Mitchell&#x27;s public assertions about non-aviation officers being ignorant of aviation matters were shown to be based on events he falsely claimed to have witnessed in Hawaii during experiments led by Lesley J. McNair, the Hawaiian Department&#x27;s assistant chief of staff for operations (G-3). During the Army&#x27;s ongoing debate over the best methods for providing coastal defense, which engaged proponents of the Coast Artillery branch and Army Air Service, McNair&#x27;s panel compared the use of coast artillery and aircraft for shore defense. The panel concluded that coastal artillery was sufficient, provided that adequate listening and lighting equipment for detecting and illuminating enemy ships and planes was available, and that bombers were less accurate, but more effective at destroying enemy ships at longer distances from shore, provided they could overcome obstacles including inclement weather. Summerall, the department commander, was so incensed at Mitchell&#x27;s questioning of his and McNair&#x27;s integrity that he attempted to be appointed as president of the court-martial. During Mitchell&#x27;s trial, Major General Robert Courtney Davis, the Army&#x27;s adjutant general, ordered Summerall and McNair to provide testimony. They refuted Mitchell&#x27;s claims that during his time in Hawaii in 1923 the Hawaiian Department had no plan to defend Oahu from Japanese attack. They also demonstrated that Mitchell was incorrect in stating that the Air Service was not treated fairly in the distribution of resources in Hawaii; in fact, Summerall had reallocated funding, equipment and other items from other branches to the Air Service.

The court found the truth or falsity of Mitchell&#x27;s accusations to be immaterial to the charge and on December 17, 1925, found him &quot;guilty of all specifications and of the charge&quot;. The court suspended him from active duty for five years without pay, which President Coolidge later reduced to half-pay. The generals&#x27; ruling in the case wrote, &quot;The Court is thus lenient because of the military record of the Accused during the World War.&quot; MacArthur (who himself in 1951 was removed from duty for similar reasons) later said he had voted to acquit, and Fiorello La Guardia said that MacArthur&#x27;s &quot;not guilty&quot; ballot had been found in the judges&#x27; anteroom. MacArthur felt &quot;that a senior officer should not be silenced for being at variance with his superiors in rank and with accepted doctrine.&quot;

In 1958, Mitchell&#x27;s son from his second marriage, William Mitchell, petitioned the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records to reverse his father&#x27;s conviction. The Board recommended vacating the conviction, but USAF Secretary James H. Douglas Jr. refused on the grounds that while Mitchell&#x27;s airpower views &quot;have been vindicated,&quot; this did not &quot;affect the propriety or impropriety&quot; of Mitchell&#x27;s insubordinate behavior. According to Douglas, by remaining on active duty, Mitchell &quot;was bound to accept the consequences imposed by his service responsibilities.&quot;

==Later life==
Mitchell resigned instead on February 1, 1926, and spent the next decade writing and preaching air power to all who would listen. However, his departure from the service sharply reduced his ability to influence military policy and public opinion.

Mitchell viewed the election of his one-time antagonist Franklin D. Roosevelt as advantageous for air power, and met with him early in 1932 to brief him on his concepts for a unification of the military in a Department of Defense. His ideas intrigued and interested Roosevelt. Mitchell believed he might receive an appointment as Assistant Secretary of War for Air or perhaps even Secretary of War in a Roosevelt administration, but neither prospect materialized.

==Personal life==
Mitchell married his first wife, Caroline Stoddard, on December 2, 1903. They had three children: Harriet, Elizabeth, and John Lendrum III. Although the marriage was initially happy, his behavior became more and more erratic primarily as a result of his heavy drinking. The two had a bitter divorce, rife with accusations on both sides, which was finalized on September 22, 1922. On September 27, after a Milwaukee courtroom trial, the judge decided in Caroline&#x27;s favor. Lawyers for Caroline and biographers reported that the marital problems were caused by Billy Mitchell, who became so erratic that his wife even considered sending him to a psychiatrist. Caroline won custody of the children and alimony including $400.00 a month in child support.

A year later, on October 11, 1923, Mitchell married his second wife, Elizabeth Trumbull Miller. They had two children, Lucy and William Jr. In 1926, Mitchell made his home with his wife Elizabeth at the Boxwood Farm in Middleburg, Virginia, which remained his primary residence until his death.

==Death==
On February 19, 1936, Mitchell died in New York City at Doctors Hospital of a coronary occlusion. He had been admitted to the hospital on January 28. He was 56 years old.

Mitchell was buried at Forest Home Cemetery in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. None of Mitchell&#x27;s children from his first marriage attended the funeral. His widow, Elizabeth, later married Thomas Bolling Byrd, the brother of Virginia governor Harry F. Byrd Sr. and explorer Richard E. Byrd.

Mitchell&#x27;s son, John Lendrum Mitchell III, enlisted in the Army on October 10, 1941. Promoted to first lieutenant in the 4th Armored Division, and stationed at Pine Camp, NY (now Fort Drum), he died from a blood infection on October 27, 1942. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Mitchell&#x27;s first cousin, the Canadian George Croil, went on to secure an autonomous status for the Royal Canadian Air Force and in 1938 became its first Chief of the Air Staff.

==Attempts at posthumous promotion==
In 1940, a bill was introduced in Congress that sought to posthumously promote Mitchell to the rank of major general, but it did not pass. A similar bill was drafted in 1942 to promote Mitchell to brigadier general. According to the Office of Air Force History, &quot;this effort failed to follow the normal process, which called for the War and Navy Departments to submit recommendations to the White House.&quot; Instead, only the Senate participated, and passed a joint resolution. Reportedly, &quot;this approach did require the approval of the House, which was not forthcoming.&quot; As a result, Mitchell did not actually receive a posthumous promotion, although many misunderstood the Senate resolution as authorizing this. Bills were introduced in 1943 to promote Mitchell to brigadier general and also to major general, which did not pass. In 1945, the same legislation was introduced for a promotion to major general, but it also did not pass. Another bill was introduced in 1947 to the same effect which did not pass either.

In 2004, Mitchell&#x27;s posthumous promotion was finally authorized in the FY2005 National Defense Authorization Act. According to the former editor of &quot;Air Force Magazine&quot;, &quot;neither the Pentagon nor the White House took any action as a result of the authorization,&quot; which meant Mitchell was never promoted. That bill was introduced by Rep. Charles Bass (R-N.H.), himself a relative of Mitchell&#x27;s, and whose own father, Rep. Perkins Bass (R-N.H.), had also previously sponsored legislation to posthumously promote Mitchell. Reportedly, the promotion authorization drew on &quot;muted support&quot; from the USAF, which may explain why the bill was not acted on. One author wrote that Mitchell&#x27;s true history was more complicated than the simple narrative that he was a passionate airpower advocate; according to one historian, he was &quot;vain, petulant, racist, overbearing, and egotistical&quot;, which may explain reservations about the many attempts to revise his legacy. An air force officer reflected that if Mitchell&#x27;s promotion were granted, it would be &quot;only a pyrrhic victory&quot;, since it would not &quot;erase the questionable actions that proceeded from his passionate advocacy of airpower&#x27;s independence&quot;.

Mitchell is often referred to as a &quot;brigadier general (temporary)&quot; because of his holding temporary rank during World War I and later after the war, although his permanent grade was colonel both during his temporary service as a general officer as well as at the time he resigned. Congress subsequently passed legislation in 1930 that permitted &quot;all commissioned officers who served in the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and/or Coast Guard of the United States during the World War, and who have been or may be hereafter retired according to law . . . shall . . . be advanced in rank on the retired list to the highest grade held by them during the World War&quot;. However, it appears that since this act required the officer to be formally retired, it did not apply to Mitchell because he had resigned his commission rather than be subject to the pay forfeiture from his court martial conviction. Indeed, none of the Army Registers from 1926 to 1932 list him as retired. However, the 1930 legislation did allow non-retirees to use the wartime titles of ranks they had held honorably, meaning that Mitchell could subsequently call himself a brigadier general without actually being one as a matter of law. This was a curious status that likely applied to very few general officers, since unlike Mitchell, the vast majority were careerists who subsequently were retired by law.

==Congressional Gold Medal==

There has been some confusion regarding Mitchell&#x27;s medal being a Medal of Honor instead of a Congressional Gold Medal, because it was erroneously listed as a Medal of Honor in the Committee on Veterans&#x27; Affairs report of 1979 which is often used as a modern index of Medal of Honor listings. According to the Army&#x27;s Center of Military History, &quot;it seems apparent that the intention was to award the Gold Medal rather than the Medal of Honor,&quot; but the Center included Mitchell&#x27;s award because of the error on the Senate report. The Senate error was a consequence of a drafting mistake when the bill was in committee. The House Committee on Military Affairs confused the Medal of Honor with the Congressional Gold Medal in its first draft of the bill, and then retroactively amended the text to remove &quot;a Medal of Honor&quot; and replace it with &quot;a gold medal,&quot; but neglected to correct the title of the bill. However, the Committee clarified that &quot;the legislation under consideration does not authorize an award of the Congressional Medal of Honor,&quot; which clearly settled the matter. The medal in question is listed as a Congressional Gold Medal in the database of the House of Representatives. In spite of these verifiable facts, the U.S. Air Force still lists Mitchell as a Medal of Honor recipient (and also incorrectly claims that he was posthumously promoted to major general on July 18, 1947), even though he has been removed from the official list published online by the Department of Defense. According to one author, the Air Force&#x27;s continued representation that Mitchell is a Medal of Honor recipient constitutes &quot;misinformation&quot; and is &quot;inexplicable, since Congress lists the award as a Gold Medal, the Air Force formally participated in the Gold Medal&#x27;s design, and the National Museum of the Air Force currently possesses the replica Gold Medal in question.&quot; The National Museum of the Air Force displays Mitchell&#x27;s Gold Medal publicly, with the caption that &quot;This is the Congressional Gold Medal awarded posthumously to Gen. Billy Mitchell in 1946. This medallion, the only one of its kind, was sculpted by Erwin F. Springweiler and struck by the Philadelphia Mint.&quot; Since the medal in question is on public display, it is easily verifiable as not being a Medal of Honor. Several Medal of Honor historians have also published on this subject due to repeated confusion over Mitchell&#x27;s award.

==Military and civilian awards==

===Mitchell&#x27;s military awards===
==Military societies==
General Mitchell belonged to the following military societies and veteran organizations –
* Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States
* Military Order of Foreign Wars
* Military Order of the Carabao
* National Society of the Army of the Philippines (Merged with the Veterans of Foreign Service to form the Veterans of Foreign Wars in 1914.)
* American Legion

==Dates of promotion==
Note – the date listed is the date the promotion was accepted by General Mitchell. The actual date of rank was usually a few days earlier. (Source – Army Register, 1926. p. 423.)

==Posthumous recognition==

Mitchell&#x27;s concept of a battleship&#x27;s vulnerability to air attack under &quot;war-time conditions&quot; was vindicated after his death. Air power was first shown to be decisive against a capital ship in war conditions during the Spanish Civil War: on May 29, 1937, Republican Government bombers attacked and damaged the German heavy cruiser . This new dimension for aerial warfare preceded the attack on Taranto and Pearl Harbor by a good margin.

During World War II, many warships were sunk solely by air attack. The battleships , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , &quot;Marat&quot;, and were all put out of commission or destroyed by aerial attack including bombs, air-dropped torpedoes and missiles fired from aircraft. Some of these ships were destroyed by surprise attacks in harbor, others were sunk at sea after vigorous defense. However, most of the sinkings were carried out by aircraft carrier-based planes, not by land-based bombers as envisioned by Mitchell. The world&#x27;s navies had responded quickly to the &quot;Ostfriesland&quot; lesson.
* 1941: The North American B-25 Mitchell bomber, introduced in 1941, was named for Mitchell. Nearly 10,000 B-25s were produced, including the sixteen bombers which Lt. Colonel Jimmy Doolittle and his raiders used to bomb Tokyo and four other Japanese targets in April 1942.
* 1941: The main airport in Mitchell&#x27;s hometown of Milwaukee was renamed General Mitchell Field in his honor; it is now known as Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport. The airport also houses the Mitchell Gallery of Flight museum
* 1942: President Franklin Roosevelt, in recognizing Mitchell&#x27;s contributions to air power, petitioned the U.S. Congress to posthumously award Mitchell the Congressional Gold Medal, &quot;in recognition of his outstanding pioneer service and foresight in the field of American military aviation.&quot; It was awarded in 1946.
* 1943: Walt Disney produced a film, &quot;Victory Through Air Power&quot;, which opened with a filmed quote from General Mitchell, and is dedicated to him. The movie is based on a book by Major Alexander P. de Seversky, and is an explanation of how long range bombing and concentration of air power could shorten World War II, explaining the logistics and strategies that would give the Allies the upper hand at that time, as the Axis would be unable to develop similar aircraft and strategies due to their own issues. This film was shown to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt at a conference in Quebec, and reportedly made an impact on the planning and production of U.S. war material at the insistence of Roosevelt.
* 1943: The unnamed &quot;General&quot; in the classic World War II movie &quot;A Guy Named Joe&quot; who gives the deceased pilot his new assignment, was &quot;probably modeled after Billy Mitchell.&quot;
* 1944: The United States Navy named a troop transport as the .
* 1951: The Billy Mitchell Drill Team (BMDT) was founded as an Air Force ROTC Drill Team; it is a drill, ceremony and color guard team at the University of Florida.
* 1955: The Air Force Association passed a resolution calling for the voiding of Mitchell&#x27;s court-martial. The Association named their Institute for Airpower Studies for the General; the current Dean of the Mitchell Institute is Lt. Gen. David A. Deptula, USAF (Ret.).
* 1955: The motion picture &quot;The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell&quot;, directed by Otto Preminger and starring Gary Cooper, portrays Mitchell&#x27;s plight in a dramatic light.
* 1966: Mitchell was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame.
* 1968: The United States Board on Geographic Names officially named Mount Billy Mitchell in the Chugach Mountains, near the city of Valdez in Southcentral Alaska. This was in recognition of his central role in overseeing the construction of the Washington-Alaska Military Cable and Telegraph System (WAMCATS) while he was stationed in the District of Alaska from 1900 to 1904.
* 1970: Mitchell was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame.
* 1971: &quot;Pipes and Drums, the Billy Mitchell Scottish&quot;, was created in Milwaukee to honor Mitchell and his ties to Scotland and Milwaukee.
* Billy Mitchell Airport in Cape Hatteras, North Carolina is named for Mitchell.
* Mitchell Hall, the cadet dining facility at the United States Air Force Academy, was dedicated in honor of Mitchell in 1959.
* William (Billy) Mitchell High School in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and Billy Mitchell Elementary School in Lawndale, California, are named after him.
* General Mitchell was honored at his alma mater, the George Washington University in Washington, D.C., with the naming of a large undergraduate residence building, William Mitchell Hall.
* The Civil Air Patrol cadet program includes an award called the General Billy Mitchell Award, signifying the rank of Cadet 2nd Lieutenant, and completion of several tests and essays. There is also a CAP &quot;Billy Mitchell Squadron&quot; in the LA Wing, based at Lakefront airport, New Orleans.
* The U.S. Air Force Pipe Band, which existed as a free-standing unit within the U.S. Air Force Band between 1960 and 1970, wore a tartan created in honor of Billy Mitchell.
* 1998: William Sanders wrote the alternate history story &quot;Billy Mitchell&#x27;s Overt Act&quot;. In the variant history depicted in the story, Mitchell managed to avoid the court-martial, and was still alive as an active service general in 1941. Being stationed in Hawaii, Mitchell correctly guessed the Japanese intentions and launched a preemptive strike on the oncoming Japanese carriers, and at the cost of his own life, several carriers were destroyed and disabled which prevented the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor.
* 1999: General Mitchell&#x27;s portrait was put on a U.S. postage stamp. Although the 55-cent stamp met an airmail rate and portrayed a figure important to the development of aviation, it was not marked or issued as an airmail stamp. It also met the two-ounce first-class rate in effect at the time.
* Mitchell was named as the class exemplar at the United States Air Force Academy for the Class of 2001.
* 2003: The House voted to reauthorize the president to posthumously commission Mitchell as a major general in the Army (2003 HR2755). However, as the bill clearly notes, it did not pass the Senate, and therefore did not become law. 
* 2006: On May 18, the U.S. Air Force unveiled two prototypes for new service dress uniforms, referencing the service&#x27;s heritage. One, modeled on the United States Army Air Service uniform, was designated the &quot;Billy Mitchell heritage coat&quot; (the other was named for Hap Arnold). Ironically, the Air Service (including Mitchell) campaigned persistently against the high-collar blouse, which was the Army&#x27;s regulation uniform coat of the time, because of its chafing effect on pilots&#x27; necks. In 1924, they succeeded and adopted the &quot;turned-down&quot; collar style blouse shown as the &quot;Hap Arnold&quot; uniform.
* 2007: The Air Force established and awarded the first Air Force Combat Action Medal (s), which is based on the insignia painted on Billy Mitchell&#x27;s own aircraft which he flew during World War I.

<text>The Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) is an independent center for theoretical research and intellectual inquiry located in Princeton, New Jersey. It has served as the academic home of internationally preeminent scholars, including Albert Einstein, J. Robert Oppenheimer, Hermann Weyl, John von Neumann, Michael Walzer, Clifford Geertz and Kurt Gödel, many of whom had emigrated from Europe to the United States.

It was founded in 1930 by American educator Abraham Flexner, together with philanthropists Louis Bamberger and Caroline Bamberger Fuld. Despite collaborative ties and neighboring geographic location, the institute, being independent, has &quot;no formal links&quot; with Princeton University. The institute does not charge tuition or fees.

Flexner&#x27;s guiding principle in founding the institute was the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake. The faculty have no classes to teach. There are no degree programs or experimental facilities at the institute. Research is never contracted or directed. It is left to each individual researcher to pursue their own goals. Established during the rise of fascism in Europe, the institute played a key role in the transfer of intellectual capital from Europe to America. It quickly earned its reputation as the pinnacle of academic and scientific life—a reputation it has retained.

The institute consists of four schools: Historical Studies, Mathematics, Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences. The institute also has a program in Systems Biology.

It is supported entirely by endowments, grants, and gifts. It is one of eight American mathematics institutes funded by the National Science Foundation. It is the model for all ten members of the consortium Some Institutes for Advanced Study.

==History==

===Founding===

The institute was founded in 1930 by Abraham Flexner, together with philanthropists Louis Bamberger and Caroline Bamberger Fuld. Flexner was interested in education generally and as early as 1890 he had founded an experimental school which had no formal curriculum, exams, or grades. It was a great success at preparing students for prestigious colleges and this same philosophy would later guide him in the founding of the Institute for Advanced Study. 

Flexner&#x27;s study of medical schools, the 1910 Flexner Report, played a major role in the reform of medical education. Flexner had studied European schools such as Heidelberg University, All Souls College, Oxford, and the –and he wanted to establish a similar advanced research center in the United States.

In his autobiography, Abraham Flexner reports a phone call which he received in the fall of 1929 from representatives of the Bamberger siblings that led to their partnership and the eventual founding of the IAS:

The Bamberger siblings wanted to use the proceeds from the sale of their Bamberger&#x27;s department store in Newark, New Jersey, to fund a dental school as an expression of gratitude to the state of New Jersey. Flexner convinced them to put their money in the service of more abstract research. (There was a brush with near-disaster when the Bambergers pulled their money out of the market just before the Crash of 1929.) The eminent topologist Oswald Veblen at Princeton University, who had long been trying to found a high-level research institute in mathematics, urged Flexner to locate the new institute near Princeton where it would be close to an existing center of learning and a world-class library. In 1932 Veblen resigned from Princeton and became the first professor in the new Institute for Advanced Study. He selected most of the original faculty and also helped the institute acquire land in Princeton for both the original facility and future expansion.

Flexner and Veblen set out to recruit the best mathematicians and physicists they could find. The rise of fascism and the associated anti-semitism forced many prominent mathematicians to flee Europe and some, such as Einstein and Hermann Weyl (whose wife was Jewish), found a home at the new institute. Weyl as a condition of accepting insisted that the institute also appoint the thirty-year-old Austrian-Hungarian polymath John von Neumann. Indeed, the IAS became the key lifeline for scholars fleeing Europe. Einstein was Flexner&#x27;s first coup and shortly after that he was followed by Veblen&#x27;s brilliant student James Alexander and the wunderkind of logic Kurt Gödel. Flexner was fortunate in the luminaries he directly recruited but also in the people that they brought along with them. Thus, by 1934 the fledgeling institute was led by six of the most prominent mathematicians in the world. In 1935 quantum physics pioneer Wolfgang Pauli became a faculty member. With the opening of the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton replaced Göttingen as the leading center for mathematics in the twentieth century.

===Early years===
For the six years from its opening in 1933, until Fuld Hall was finished and opened in 1939, the institute was housed within Princeton University—in Fine Hall, which housed Princeton&#x27;s mathematics department. Princeton University&#x27;s science departments are less than two miles away and informal ties and collaboration between the two institutions occurred from the beginning. This helped start an incorrect impression that it was part of the university, one that has never been completely eradicated.

On June 4, 1930, the Bambergers wrote as follows to the institute&#x27;s trustees:

Bamberger&#x27;s policy did not prevent racial discrimination by Princeton. When African-American mathematician William S. Claytor applied to the IAS in 1937, Princeton University said they &quot;would not permit any colored person to go to the Institute for Advanced Study.&quot; It was not until 1939, when the institute had moved into its own building, that Veblen was able to offer Claytor a position; but this time Claytor turned it down on principle.

Flexner had successfully assembled a faculty of unrivaled prestige in the School of Mathematics which officially opened in 1933. He sought to equal this success in the founding of schools of economics and humanities but this proved to be more difficult. The School of Humanistic Studies and the School of Economics and Politics were established in 1935. All three schools along with the office of the director moved into the newly built Fuld Hall in 1939. (Ultimately the schools of Humanistic Studies and Economics and Politics were merged into the present day School of Historical Studies established in 1949.) In the beginning, the School of Mathematics included physicists as well as mathematicians. A separate School of Natural Sciences was not established until 1966. The School of Social Science was founded in 1973.
==Mission==

In a 1939 essay Flexner emphasized how James Clerk Maxwell, driven only by a desire to know, did abstruse calculations in the field of magnetism and electricity and that these investigations led in a direct line to the entire electrical development of modern times. Citing Maxwell and other theoretical scientists such as Carl Friedrich Gauss, Michael Faraday, Paul Ehrlich and Einstein, Flexner said, &quot;Throughout the whole history of science most of the really great discoveries which have ultimately proved to be beneficial to mankind have been made by men and women who were driven not by the desire to be useful but merely the desire to satisfy their curiosity.&quot;

The &quot;IAS Bluebook&quot; says:

This was the belief to which Flexner clung passionately, and which continues to inspire the institute today.

==Impact==
From the day it opened the IAS had a major impact on mathematics, physics, economic theory, and world affairs. In mathematics forty-two out of sixty-one Fields Medalists have been affiliated with the institute. Thirty-four Nobel Laureates have worked at the IAS. Of the sixteen Abel Prizes awarded since the establishment of that award in 2003, nine were garnered by Institute professors or visiting scholars. Of the fifty-six Cole Prizes awarded since the establishment of that award in 1928, thirty-nine have gone to scholars associated with the IAS at some point in their career. IAS people have won 20 Wolf Prizes in mathematics and physics. 
Its more than 6,000 former members hold positions of intellectual and scientific leadership throughout the academic world.

Pioneering work on the theory of the stored-program computer as laid down by Alan Turing was done at the IAS by John von Neumann, and the IAS machine built in the basement of the Fuld Hall from 1942 to 1951 under von Neumann&#x27;s direction introduced the basic architecture of most modern digital computers. The IAS is the leading center of research in string theory and its generalization M-theory introduced by Edward Witten at the IAS in 1995. The Langlands program, a far-reaching approach which unites parts of geometry, mathematical analysis, and number theory was introduced by Robert Langlands, the mathematician who now occupies Albert Einstein&#x27;s old office at the institute. Langlands was inspired by the work of Hermann Weyl, André Weil, and Harish-Chandra, all scholars with wide-ranging ties to the institute, and the IAS maintains the key repository for the papers of Langlands and the Langlands program. The IAS is a main center of research for homotopy type theory, a modern approach to the foundations of mathematics which is not based on classical set theory. A special year organized by Institute professor Vladimir Voevodsky and others resulted in a benchmark book in the subject which was published by the institute in 2013.

The institute is or has been the academic home of many of the best minds of their generation. Among them are James Waddell Alexander II, Michael Atiyah, Enrico Bombieri, Shiing-Shen Chern, Pierre Deligne, Freeman Dyson, Albert Einstein, Clifford Geertz, Kurt Gödel, Albert Hirschman, George F. Kennan, Tsung-Dao Lee, Avishai Margalit, J. Robert Oppenheimer, Erwin Panofsky, Atle Selberg, John von Neumann, André Weil, Hermann Weyl, Frank Wilczek, Edward Witten, Chen-Ning Yang and Shing-Tung Yau.

==Special Year programs==
Flexner&#x27;s vision of the kind of results that can emerge in an institution devoted to the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake is illustrated by the &quot;Special Year&quot; programs sponsored by the IAS School of Mathematics. For example, in 2012–13 researchers at the IAS school of mathematics held &quot;A Special Year on Univalent Foundations of Mathematics&quot;. Intuitionistic type theory was created by the Swedish logician Per Martin-Löf in 1972 to serve as an alternative to set theory as a foundation for mathematics. The special year brought together researchers in topology, computer science, category theory, and mathematical logic with the goal of formalizing and extending this theory of foundations. The program was organized by Steve Awodey, Thierry Coquand and Vladimir Voevodsky, and resulted in a book being published in homotopy type theory. The authors—more than 30 researchers ultimately contributed to the project—noted the essential contribution of the IAS saying,

One of the researchers, Andrej Bauer said,

The book, informally known as &quot;The HoTT book&quot;, is freely available online.

==School of Social Science==
Founded in 1973, the School of Social Science is devoted to critical approaches to social research, both theoretical and empirical, and featuring multidisciplinary, multi-method and international perspectives. Wendy Brown, Didier Fassin, and Alondra Nelson are professors of the School of Social Science at the Institute. Among past and emeritus faculty professors are Danielle S.

==Criticism==
Richard Feynman argued that the IAS does not offer real activity or challenge:

==Other Institutes for Advanced Study==
The IAS in Princeton is widely recognized as the world&#x27;s first Institute for Advanced Study. Despite later imitators of the institute&#x27;s model, it took years before any similar institutions were founded. The Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford was the first such spinoff in 1954. This was followed by the National Humanities Center founded in North Carolina in 1978. These two institutions eventually became the core of a consortium known as &quot;Some Institutes for Advanced Study (SIAS)&quot;. The SIAS consortium includes the original institute in Princeton and nine other institutes founded explicitly to emulate the model of the original IAS. These ten Institutes for Advanced Study are:

* Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in Stanford, California
* National Humanities Center in North Carolina
* Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study in Cambridge, Massachusetts
* The Institute for Advanced Study in the Humanities (KWI) in Essen, Germany
* Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study in Amsterdam, the Netherlands (until 2016 in Wassenaar)
* Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study in Uppsala, Sweden
* Berlin Institute for Advanced Study in Berlin, Germany
* Israel Institute for Advanced Studies in Jerusalem
* Nantes Institute for Advanced Study Foundation in Nantes, France
* Stellenbosch Institute for Advanced Study in Stellenbosch, South Africa
* Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey
In recent years there have been other institutes loosely based on the Princeton original, in some cases established with help from IAS professors. In 1997 IAS professor Chen-Ning Yang helped the Chinese set up the Institute for Advanced Study at Tsinghua University in Beijing. The Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies in Freiburg, Germany was founded in 2007, with IAS director at the time Peter Goddard giving the inaugural address. Princeton IAS professors André Weil and Armand Borel helped to establish close contacts with the Ramanujan Institute for Advanced Study in Mathematics, founded in 1967 as part of the University of Madras in India.

The prestigious Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques (IHÉS) founded in 1958 just south of Paris is universally acknowledged to be the French counterpart of the IAS in Princeton. Princeton Institute director Robert Oppenheimer had a close relationship with IHÉS founder Léon Motchane and played a major role in helping to get it established. The Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, which focuses on theoretical physics, cosmic physics, and Celtic studies, was also based on the IAS, and was the second such institute when it was founded in 1940.

Neither the Princeton IAS nor SIAS is connected with, and should not be confused with, the &quot;Consortium of Institutes of Advanced Studies&quot; which comprises some twenty research institutes located throughout Great Britain and Ireland. The name Institute for Advanced Study, along with the acronym IAS, is also used by various other independent institutions throughout the world, some having little to do with the Princeton model. See Institute for Advanced Study (disambiguation) for a complete list.

==Directors, faculty and members==
At any given time, the IAS has a faculty consisting of twenty-eight eminent academics who are appointed for life. Although the faculty do not teach classes (because there are none), they often do give lectures at their own initiative and have the title Professor along with the prestige associated with that title. Furthermore, they direct research and serve as the nucleus of a larger and generally younger group of scholars, whom they have the power to select and invite. Each year fellowships are awarded to about 190 visiting members from over 100 universities and research institutions who come to the institute for periods from one term to a few years. Individuals must apply to become members of the institute, and each of the schools has its own application procedures and deadlines.

==Campus, Lands, Olden Farm and Olden Manor==

The IAS owns over 600 acres of land, most of which was acquired between 1936 and 1945. Since 1997 the institute has preserved 589 acres of woods, wetlands, and farmland. By 1936, for total of $290,000, the founding trustees of the IAS had purchased 256 acres, including the two-hundred-acre Olden Farm with Olden Manor, which was the former home of William Olden. Olden Manor, with its extensive gardens, has been, since 1940, the residence of the institute&#x27;s director.

<text>Dark Horse Comics is an American comic book, graphic novel, and manga publisher founded in Milwaukie, Oregon, by Mike Richardson in 1986. The company was created using funds earned from Richardson&#x27;s chain of Portland, Oregon, comic book shops known as Pegasus Books and founded in 1980.

Dark Horse Comics has emerged as the fourth largest comic publishing company in the United States of America. Dividing profits with artists and writers, as well as supporting artistic and creative rights in the comic book industry, Dark Horse Comics has become a strong proponent of publishing licensed material that often does not fit into mainstream media. Several titles include: &quot;Sin City&quot;, &quot;Hellboy&quot;, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, &quot;300&quot;, &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot;, and &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

In December 2021, Swedish gaming company Embracer Group launched its acquisition of Dark Horse Media, Dark Horse Comics&#x27; parent company, and completed the buyout in March 2022.

== Overview ==
Dark Horse has published many licensed comics, including comics based on &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot;, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, &quot;Aliens&quot;, &quot;Predator&quot;, and &quot;Terminator.&quot; Dark Horse Comics holds a notoriety for being the most reputable publisher in regard to allowing creators to retain ownership of their work. Founder Mike Richardson created the company with creator rights in mind because of his frustration with the treatment of artists by comic publishers of the time. They have published several creator owned comics such as Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;Sin City&quot; and &quot;300&quot;, Mike Mignola&#x27;s &quot;Hellboy&quot;, Stan Sakai&#x27;s &quot;Usagi Yojimbo&quot;, and Gerard Way&#x27;s &quot;Umbrella Academy.&quot; With an emphasis on mini and limited series, Dark Horse Comics has given itself immense flexibility in the comic book publishing industry. This model allows the company to pull poorly performing series while also retaining the ability to reprint past works without intense scrutiny.

In 2006, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;Dark Horse pays by the story or the page, and shares profit generated by comic books and related merchandise. That is different from the standard work-for-hire arrangement at DC and Marvel: creators are paid for a specific story and perhaps receive royalties from collected editions, but the bulk of the revenue, and all of the merchandising opportunities, remain with the companies&quot;.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
Mike Richardson was an active follower of the Amateur Press Association (APA), an organization focused on critiquing comics through conventions, fan projects, and newsletters. As a result of his involvement, Richardson became acquainted with Randy Stradley, an early Dark Horse Comics collaborator and editor. The two used their contacts from the APA to recruit artists and writers, many of whom were working for several top comic publishing groups.

=== 1986–2006 ===
Dark Horse was founded in 1986 by Mike Richardson with &quot;Dark Horse Presents No. 1&quot; and featured the first appearance of Paul Chadwick&#x27;s &quot;Concrete&quot; and Chris Warner&#x27;s &quot;Black Cross,&quot; selling approximately 50,000 copies, which was far better than predictions&quot;.&quot; The series has become a platform for new creators to highlight their works. The success of Dark Horse Comics can be attributed to a change in comic book marketing that occurred in the 1980s when comics began to be sold in comic specific stores. After his success, Richardson began buying the rights to several titles including: &quot;Godzilla&quot; in 1987, &quot;Aliens&quot;, &quot;Predator&quot; in 1989, and &quot;Star Wars&quot; in 1991 (owned by Marvel prior to the Dark Horse Comics acquisition). Dark Horse evolved further and began producing toys in 1991. Additionally, in 1992, Richardson formed Dark Horse Entertainment, the company&#x27;s critically acclaimed film and television division.

With the release of the first &quot;Aliens&quot; comic in 1988 and &quot;Predator&quot; in 1988, Dark Horse Comics&#x27; popular characters appeared in their own line of work as well as &quot;Dark Horse Presents&quot; and &quot;Tarzan&quot; and numerous crossovers that included &quot;Superman&quot; and &quot;Batman&quot; of DC Comics, and WildC.A.T.s.

In a 1991 issue of &quot;Dark Horse Presents&quot;, Frank Miller introduced &quot;Sin City&quot;, one of Dark Horse Comics&#x27; most successful titles. In addition to this title, Miller introduced several other limited series set in dystopian societies including &quot;Give Me Liberty&quot; which ran from 1990-1991 and &quot;Hard Boiled.&quot;

&quot;The Mask,&quot; a mini series from Mark Badger, debuted in &quot;Dark Horse Presents 10-20&quot; in 1991 and had a successful film adaptation, starring Jim Carrey, in 1994. However comic sales were not strengthened by the success of the film.

In 1993, Dark Horse established their own limited series superhero realm with the creation of &quot;Comics&#x27; Greatest World&quot;. However comic publishing changed in the 1990s and all Comics&#x27; Greatest World titles were canceled except for &quot;Ghost&quot;. As a result, Dark Horse Comics returned to their smaller scale business model.

Dark Horse Comics created the imprint Legends and as part of their focus on creators, the publisher began working with Mike Mignola. In 1994, Mignola&#x27;s character &quot;Hellboy&quot; first appeared in &quot;Hellboy: Seed of Destruction&quot; the beginning of several limited and mini series with crossovers that included &quot;Batman&quot; of DC Comics.

1994 saw the release of the monthly manga mini series, &quot;Oh My Goddess!&quot;

The licensing to the unpopular limited series, &quot;Tarzan&quot;, was purchased by Dark Horse Comics in 1995 and ended in 1998.

&quot;Ghost&quot;, from &quot;Comics&#x27; Greatest World&quot;, began running as a solo title in 1995, but ended in 1998 and was subsequently launched once more the same year.

Eisner Award winning &quot;Usagi Yojimbo&quot;, written and drawn by third generation Japanese-American artist, Stan Sakai debuted in Dark Horse Comics in 1996 as a monthly issue and ran until 2019.

Dark Horse Comics began translating the manga series from Hiroaki Samura, &quot;Blade of the Immortal&quot;, in 1996 and ending in 2015.

For the first Free Comic Book Day on May 4, 2002, Dark Horse Comics published &quot;Star Wars: Tales – A Jedi&#x27;s Weapon&quot; and has participated in the event every year since.

=== 2006–2021 ===
In 2006, Dark Horse was the third largest comics publisher. Per Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Marvel had 36.9 percent of the market&quot;, DC &quot;had 32.9 percent&quot; and Dark Horse had &quot;5.6 percent&quot;.

In 2007, Dark Horse donated copies of all of its published works to the Portland State University Library, which maintains both a browsing collection of book titles, in addition to a research collection which also includes every &quot;print, poster, statue, figure, and all other products.&quot; As of July 15, 2016, the library has cataloged over 10,000 titles as &quot;the official archive of Dark Horse publications&quot;.

In 2011, &quot;Dark Horse Presents&quot; relaunched including the return of Paul Chadwick&#x27;s &quot;Concrete&quot; and Steve Niles&#x27; &quot;Criminal Macabre&quot;, as well as new talent including Sanford Greene, Carla Speed McNeil, Nate Crosby and others. Starting in 2013, Dark Horse began to reprint E. C. Archives, picking up the project of reprinting classic E. C. Comics from the 1950s where Gladstone left off, using the same size and format as Gladstone, with all stories reprinted in order and in full color.

In early 2017, Dark Horse Comic entered partnership with Crypton Future Media to publish official English-language Hatsune Miku-related manga. In late summer of 2018, a set of comic books for &quot;Mysticons&quot; were released. In 2018, Vanguard Visionary Associates, a Chinese media production company, became a partner of Dark Horse&#x27;s subsidiary Dark Horse Entertainment along with a &quot;major investment stake&quot; in the subsidiary. Both &quot;Forbes&quot; and &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; reported that &quot;the investment stake is rumored to be about $20 million and will give Vanguard a majority interest in Dark House&quot;.

In 2020, Dark Horse announced it was severing ties with writer and editor Scott Allie &quot;after a former Dark Horse employee accused him of sexual harassment and sexual assault across a period lasting more than a decade.&quot; It was reported that in 2015, &quot;after reports of multiple instances of sexual misconduct&quot; by Allie:Dark Horse Comics founder Mike Richardson released a statement to &quot;The Beat&quot;, which in part read, &quot;In this particular case, action was taken immediately, though we did not, and cannot, perform a public flogging, as some might wish.&quot; Although Richardson said action had been taken, Allie continued as an editor for Dark Horse, transitioning from editor-in-chief to the role of executive senior editor in 2015, before departing Dark Horse as a full-time employee in 2017, continuing to work with them [until 2020] in a freelance capacity.

In June 2021, Dark Horse opened a video game and digital division, called Dark Horse Games. The division will be focused on development of AAA video games based on the company&#x27;s IP.

In mid-November 2021, Dark Horse founder and CEO Mike Richardson announced that the company would be publishing a new line of all-ages Star Wars comics and graphic novels in collaboration with Lucasfilm and Disney Publishing Worldwide. Dark Horse had previously held the licensing rights for producing &quot;Star Wars&quot; comics between 1991 and 2015.

=== Acquisition by Embracer Group ===
In December 2021, Bloomberg reported Dark Horse Comics for sale to a Hollywood studio. Companies rumored as potential buyers include Netflix, and The Walt Disney Company but a representative couldn&#x27;t comment. However, later in the month, Embracer Group (a video game holding company) announced that it launched its acquisition of Dark Horse Media, including Dark Horse Comics and Dark Horse Entertainment, and that the company would be the 10th operative division in the company.

Multiple news outlets highlighted that this deal gives Embracer Group access to Dark Horse&#x27;s &quot;300-plus pieces of intellectual property&quot;. This deal also grants Dark Horse access to additional intellectual property maintained by Embracer; &quot;sources close to the publisher say that founder and CEO Mike Richardson maintains creative control over Dark Horse under the terms of the deal, while the company receives a level of financial stability it hasn&#x27;t previously enjoyed as an independent entity, even as it separates from its deal with Chinese pop culture company Vanguard Visionary Associates&quot;. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; commented that for the Embracer Group this deal was &quot;not just an opportunity to expand properties into comics, but other media. Dark Horse&#x27;s ongoing relationship with media companies through current and future adaptations and the Dark Horse Entertainment subsidiary open up the potential for Embracer to push projects outside of the video game arena. Dark Horse isn&#x27;t simply the fourth-largest comic book publisher in the U.S. industry, after all; it&#x27;s also a company with a first-look deal with Netflix, as well as an ongoing relationship with Universal Content Productions.&quot;

Embracer finalized the acquisition of Dark Horse on March 14, 2022.

== Distribution ==
In June 2022, Dark Horse announced a business partnership with Penguin Random House Publishing as the company&#x27;s new primary comic book distributor which was previously held by Diamond Comics Distributors for thirty years. On September 21, 2022, Dark Horse Comics announced the expansion of their business relationship with Penguin Random House. This multi-year distribution deal began in June 2023.

Dark Horse CEO Mike Richardson stated that the company decided to expand their business relationship with the legendary publishing company because they both wanted to improve comic book accessibility worldwide, and address fans concerns over high distribution fees with Diamond Comics, Inc.

==Imprints and studios==
===Comics&#x27; Greatest World/Dark Horse Heroes (1993–1996)===

From 1993 to 1996, Dark Horse published a line of superhero comics under the Comics&#x27; Greatest World imprint, which was later renamed Dark Horse Heroes. After 1996, publication of this line came to a near halt, ceasing production of any books concerning the characters with the publication of the last crossover books involving Ghost, in the early 2000s.

===Legend (1994–1998)===
Legend was a comic book imprint at Dark Horse Comics created in 1994 by Frank Miller and John Byrne as an avenue for creator-owned projects. Its logo was a moai drawn by Mike Mignola. Later on, other creators were asked to join them. The imprint ended in 1998.

Dark Horse, working with Big Tent Entertainment and the NHK broadcasting corporation, brought Domo-kun to the United States with a series of products ranging from Qee figurines to journals and stationery sets.

The imprint name is in reference to Kitchen&#x27;s former publishing company Kitchen Sink Press which ran from 1970 until 1999. Kitchen said of the venture, “John and I have packaged books for a number of first-rank publishers, but we have long discussed the ideal house to enjoy maximum freedom and creativity,” says Kitchen. “In longtime friend and publisher Mike Richardson and Dark Horse Comics, we found just that.” The imprint&#x27;s output is infrequent, publishing 2-3 high-profile projects annually with editorial focus on art books and deluxe format collections. Creators published under the Kitchen Sink line include Will Eisner, Frank Miller, Harvey Kurtzman, Tony DiTerlizzi and collections/anthology titles include work from Jack Davis, Will Elder, Art Spiegelman, S.

<text>The Draize test is an acute toxicity test devised in 1944 by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) toxicologists John H. Draize and Jacob M. Spines. Initially used for testing cosmetics, the procedure involves applying 0.5 mL or 0.5 g of a test substance to the eye or skin of a restrained, conscious animal, and then leaving it for a set amount of time before rinsing it out and recording its effects. The animals are observed for up to 14 days for signs of erythema and edema in the skin test, and redness, swelling, discharge, ulceration, hemorrhaging, cloudiness, or blindness in the tested eye. The test subject is commonly an albino rabbit, though other species are used too, including dogs. The animals are euthanized after testing if the test renders irreversible damage to the eye or skin. Animals may be re-used for testing purposes if the product tested causes no permanent damage. Animals are typically reused after a &quot;wash out&quot; period during which all traces of the tested product are allowed to disperse from the test site.

The tests are controversial. They are viewed as cruel as well as unscientific by critics because of the differences between rabbit and human eyes, and the subjective nature of the visual evaluations. The FDA supports the test, stating that &quot;to date, no single test, or battery of tests, has been accepted by the scientific community as a replacement [for] ... the Draize test&quot;. Because of its controversial nature, the use of the Draize test in the U.S. and Europe has declined in recent years and is sometimes modified so that anaesthetics are administered and lower doses of the test substances used. Chemicals already shown to have adverse effects &quot;in vitro&quot; are not currently used in a Draize test, thereby reducing the number and severity of tests that are carried out.

== Background ==

John Henry Draize (1900–1992) obtained a BSc in chemistry then a PhD in pharmacology, studying hyperthyroidism. He then joined the University of Wyoming and investigated plants poisonous to cattle, other livestock, and people. The U.S. Army recruited Draize in 1935 to investigate the effects of mustard gas and other chemical agents.

In 1938, after a number of reports of coal tar in mascara leading to blindness, the U.S. Congress passed the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, placing cosmetics under regulatory control. The following year Draize joined the FDA, and was soon promoted to head of the Dermal and Ocular Toxicity Branch where he was charged with developing methods for testing the side effects of cosmetic products. This work culminated in a report by Draize, his laboratory assistant, Geoffrey Woodard, and division chief, Herbert Calvery, describing how to assess acute, intermediate, and chronic exposure to cosmetics by applying compounds to the skin, penis, and eyes of rabbits.

Following this report, the techniques were used by the FDA to evaluate the safety of substances such as insecticides and sunscreens and later adopted to screen many other compounds. By Draize&#x27;s retirement in 1963, and despite never having personally attached his name to any technique, irritancy procedures were commonly known as &quot;the Draize test&quot; To distinguish the target organ, the tests are now often referred to as &quot;the Draize eye test&quot; and &quot;the Draize skin test&quot;.

==Reliability==
In 1971, before the implementation in 1981 of the modern Draize protocol, toxicologists Carrol Weil and Robert Scala of Carnegie Mellon University distributed three test substances for comparative analysis to 24 different university and state laboratories. The laboratories returned significantly different evaluations, from non-irritating to severely irritating, for the same substances. A 2004 study by the U.S. Scientific Advisory Committee on Alternative Toxicological Methods analyzed the modern Draize skin test. They found that tests would:
* Misidentify a serious irritant as safe: 0–0.01%
* Misidentify a mild irritant as safe: 3.7–5.5%
* Misidentify a serious irritant as a mild irritant: 10.3–38.7%

==Descriptions of the test==

===Anti-testing===
According to the American National Anti-Vivisection Society, solutions of products are applied directly into the animals&#x27; eyes, which can cause &quot;intense burning, itching and pain&quot;. Clips are placed on the rabbits&#x27; eyelids to hold them open during the test period, which can last several days, during which time the rabbits are placed in restraining stocks. The chemicals often leave the eyes &quot;ulcerated and bleeding&quot;. In the Draize test for skin irritancy, the test substances are applied to skin that is shaved and abraded (several layers of skin are removed with sticky tape), then covered with plastic sheeting.

===Pro-testing===
According to the British Research Defence Society, the Draize eye test is now a &quot;very mild test&quot;, in which small amounts of substances are used and are washed out of the eye at the first sign of irritation. In a letter to &quot;Nature&quot;, written to refute an article saying that the Draize test had not changed much since the 1940s, Andrew Huxley wrote: &quot;A substance expected from its chemical nature to be seriously painful must not be tested in this way; the test is permissible only if the substance has already been shown not to cause pain when applied to skin, and &quot;in vitro&quot; pre-screening tests are recommended, such as a test on an isolated and perfused eye. Permission to carry out the test on several animals is given only if the test has been performed on a single animal and a period of 24 hours has been allowed for injury to become evident.&quot;

==Differences between the rabbit eye and the human eyes==

Kirk Wilhelmus, professor in the Department of Ophthalmology at Baylor College of Medicine, conducted a comprehensive review of the Draize eye test in 2001. He also reported that differences in anatomy and biochemistry between the rabbit and human eye indicate that testing substances on rabbits might not predict the effects on humans. However, he noted &quot;that eyes of rabbits are generally more susceptible to irritating substances than the eyes of humans&quot; making them a conservative model of the human eye. Wilhelmus concluded &quot;The Draize eye test ... has assuredly prevented harm&quot; to humans, but predicts it will be &quot;supplanted as &quot;in vitro&quot; and clinical alternatives emerge for assessing irritancy of the ocular surface&quot;.

== Alternatives ==
Industry and regulatory bodies responsible for public health are actively assessing animal-free tests to reduce the requirement for Draize testing. Before 2009 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) had not validated any alternative methods for testing eye or skin irritation potential. However, since 2000 OECD had validated alternative tests for corrosivity, meaning acids, bases and other corrosive substances are no longer required to be Draize tested on animals. The alternative tests include a human skin equivalent model and the transepicutaneous resistance test (TER). In addition, the use of human corneal cell line (HCE-T cells) is also another good alternative method to test eye irritation on potential chemicals.

In September 2009 the OECD validated two alternatives to the Draize eye test: the bovine cornea opacity test (BCOP) and isolated chicken eye test (ICE). A 1995 study funded by the European Commission and British Home Office evaluated these among nine potential replacements, including the hens&#x27; egg chorioallantoic membrane (HET-CAM) assay and an epithelial model cultivated from human corneal cells, in comparison with Draize test data. The study found that none of the alternative tests, taken alone, proved to be a reliable replacement for the animal test.

Positive results from some of these tests have been accepted by regulatory bodies, such as the British Health and Safety Executive and US Department of Health and Human Services, without testing on live animals, but negative results (no irritation) required further &quot;in vivo&quot; testing. Regulatory bodies have therefore begun to adopt a tiered testing strategy for skin and eye irritation, using alternatives to reduce Draize testing of substances with the most severe effects.

==Regulations==

===UK===
In Britain, the Home Office publishes guideline for eye irritancy tests, with the aim of reducing suffering to the animals. In its 2006 guidelines, it &quot;strongly encourages&quot; &quot;in vitro&quot; screening of all compounds before testing on animals, and mandates the use of validated alternatives when available. It requires that the test solution&#x27;s &quot;physical and chemical properties are not such that a severe adverse reaction could be predicted&quot;; therefore &quot;known corrosive substances or those with a high oxidation or reduction potential must not be tested.&quot;

The test design requires that the substance be tested on one rabbit initially, and the effect of the substance on the skin must be ascertained before it can be introduced into the eye. If a rabbit shows signs of &quot;severe pain&quot; or distress it must be immediately killed, the study terminated and the compound may not be tested on other animals. In tests where severe eye irritancy is considered likely, a washout should closely follow testing in the eye of the first rabbit. In the UK, any departure from these guidelines requires prior approval from the Secretary of State.

<text>Rotten.com was an American photo and video sharing shock site active from 1996 to 2012, known for hosting gruesome and bloody images and videos of gore, death, and decomposition, specialising in graphic, gross deaths and violence. The website, which had the tagline &quot;An archive of disturbing illustration&quot;, was devoted to morbid curiosities, which included photos and videos of violent acts, deformities, autopsy photos and videos, police case photographs and videos of suicides, dead and decomposing corpses, and other deaths, etc, and forensic crime scene videos and images, (of unlawful killings and homicides, including murder, taken as part of criminal investigations), depictions of perverse sex acts, disturbing or misanthropic historical curiosities, and various recorded media of real events, such as shootings, beheadings, suicides, stabbings, mutilations, torture, murders, terrorist attacks (including suicide bombings, terrorist beheadings, and executions), knife attacks, capital punishments (including by beheading and shooting, and executions by shooting and beheading), surgeries, amputations, gang violence (including mafia and cartel-related violence), self-harm, war photos and videos (including crimes during wartime), assassinations, accidents, injuries, CCTV, videos of self-defence, dashcam, assaults (including assaults with deadly weapons), injuries, cadavers, forensic pathology, (including photos and videos), and revenge attacks and killings (including murders, stabbings and shootings caught on cell phones, dashcams, and CCTV). Rotten.com also hosted some video footage of these events, but these were not extremely graphic, as it was not allowed on the site; it was more of a morbid curiosity website with bloody, gory, and shocking images to shock viewers about how brutal the world is, rather than outright horrendous shock. Much of the material depicted was uncensored, graphic, unblurred, uncut, gory, bloody videos and images (the videos were still quite graphic, though not the most, depending on the video, however, the images were more graphic than the videos mostly). Founded in 1996, it was run by a developer known as Soylent Communications. Site updates slowed in 2009, with the final update in February 2012. The website&#x27;s front page was last archived in February 2018.

== History ==
In late 1996, Soylent wrote a program that identified unregistered Internet domain names consisting of one word with a corresponding dictionary entry. &quot;Rotten&quot; was one of the unclaimed words, and Soylent went on to register Rotten.com in the same year. Rotten.com presented itself as a bastion of online free speech, in an era when censorship rules in some countries had begun to restrict internet access.

Rotten.com had a sparse layout; no thumbnail images were present next to links, and the links had one-line descriptions couched in morbid humor, often carrying no hints at their content. Content consisted of user-submitted images, with developers rarely posting content themselves. Though submissions were marked as &quot;real&quot;, often they were misattributed; in one instance, a file submitted as &quot;motorcycle.jpg&quot; was given the description of depicting a motorbike accident, but the developers admitted it was probably an attempted shotgun suicide.

Rotten.com received an alleged image of medical personnel recovering Princess Diana&#x27;s body from a car accident, though this was later confirmed as fake. However, due to wide interest in the crash, the image was posted anyway, resulting in a large traffic spike. The website was also one of the first to publish images of the September 11 jumpers from the Twin Towers, under the title &quot;Swan Dive&quot;.

The site also hosted videos of some these graphic events, including on cell phones, dashcam, forensic and autopsy cameras, CCTV, and film cameras. 

Rotten.com also hosted autopsy videos, and forensic case and crime scene videos taken by coroners and forensic services worldwide, and submitted by users via email, or request developers to post images or videos which were unreleased, which users could not find online and submit via email.

==Legal disputes==
Rotten.com was threatened with many lawsuits over the years, mostly in the form of cease and desist notices. These ranged from serious matters, such as requests to remove pictures of dead relatives from the site, to Burlington Coat Factory asking to take down &#x27;trenchcoat.org&#x27;, a domain bought by Rotten.com as a Trenchcoat Mafia reference, though it simply linked to Burlington Coat Factory&#x27;s webpage.

On June 24, 2005, the US federal government ordered that the &quot;Fuck of the Month&quot; section of the site be removed, along with content from several ancillary sites. In posting the page&#x27;s removal notice, the site&#x27;s moderator criticized supporters of both Alberto Gonzales and the Bush Administration for the enablement of censorship.

== Rotten Library ==
In 2003, The Rotten Library was created as an encyclopedia to supplement the website. The Library contained hundreds of articles under 17 different headings, including culture, art, medicine, crime, travel, and the occult. Articles contained detailed research, timelines, and occasionally included previously unseen images of various well-known events. The headings inside of entries are humorous in nature, with a description of the subject (for example, a medical condition) in an informal and often insulting tone. In the entry dedicated to eating disorders, the heading above the section for bulimia is titled &quot;Betty Bulimia.&quot;

== Merchandise ==
Rotten.com had a store that carried T-shirts, mousemats, stickers, magnets, and bizarre DVDs.

==Ancillary sites==

=== &quot;The Daily Rotten&quot; ===
In late 1999, &quot;The Daily Rotten&quot; was started by Thomas E. Dell, which published news stories on a daily basis, focusing mostly on terrorism, murder, suicide, abuse and excrement. &quot;Daily Rotten&quot;, also known as &quot;Rotten News&quot;, is driven by user submissions, which are edited by a self-described &quot;Rotten Staff Duder&quot;. This also features comments for each one of the articles, posted by the registered members; they usually bring similar histories, gruesome and graphic images of real gore and dead bodies. They refer to themselves as &quot;rotteneers&quot;, a satirical reference to Walt Disney&#x27;s Mouseketeers, and/or &quot;rottentots&quot;.

=== Boners.com ===
Rotten.com launched Boners.com in response to viewers who wanted a daily pictures page alongside the Daily Rotten newsboard. The word &quot;boner&quot; suggests an embarrassing mistake or a male organ in a state of arousal. The images typically consisted of amusing public signs, phallic imagery, and members of the public in embarrassing situations.

=== &quot;The Gaping Maw&quot; ===
In 2000, The Gaping Maw – an editorial/commentary archive – was founded. Most of the articles were written by cartoonist Tristan Farnon under the alias &quot;Spigot&quot; (from &quot;Leisure Town&quot;) or by other webmasters. The pages contained news, satire, and commentary on modern society. Along with the &quot;Rotten Library&quot;, this improved Rotten.com&#x27;s standing in many communities since it introduced a humane and intellectual aspect to the website. On June 22, 2005, &quot;The Gaping Maw&quot; went dark to comply with new government bookkeeping requirements regarding the distribution of pornography, specifically governmental age-verification of models, under . All articles were taken down, and the site&#x27;s title page was replaced with a statement lamenting the passage of the laws, headed by the banner, &quot;CENSORED BY US GOVERNMENT!&quot;. In January 2006, &quot;The Gaping Maw&quot; came back online with some articles heavily edited.

=== Rotten Dead Pool ===
In November 2003, the Rotten Dead Pool was launched. The Dead Pool was a game in which players picked ten people they believed would die over the course of the next 12 months. A point was awarded to a player for each of their correct picks. A pick did not count as correct if the pick was executed or murdered, or died some other way, after the 12 months had passed.

=== NNDB ===
In mid-2002, Rotten.com launched NNDB, an online database. NNDB is a steadily-updated website that contained information about thousands of notable people. The news section ceased updating on January 16, 2016, and the celebrity deaths section last updated on December 31, 2021. The website itself is still live.

=== &quot;Sports Dignity&quot; ===
&quot;Sports Dignity&quot; was a gallery of pictures showing embarrassing or NSFW incidents in sports games and tournaments.

<doc id="184186" wikidata="Q6780687" url="?curid=184186" title="Mary Schmich">
<text>Mary Theresa Schmich ( ; born November 29, 1953) is an American journalist. She was a columnist for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; from 1992 to 2021, winning the Pulitzer Prize in 2012. Her columns were syndicated nationally by Tribune Content Agency. She wrote the comic strip &quot;Brenda Starr, Reporter&quot; for the last 28 of its 60 years and she wrote the 1997 column &quot;Wear Sunscreen&quot;. The line &quot;Do one thing every day that scares you&quot; from the column has frequently been misattributed to Eleanor Roosevelt.

==Biography==
Born in Savannah, Georgia, the oldest of eight children, Schmich spent her childhood in Georgia. She attended high school in Phoenix, Arizona, and earned a B.A. from Pomona College.

After working in college admissions for three years and spending a year and a half in France, Schmich attended journalism school at Stanford. She has worked as a reporter at the Palo Alto &quot;Peninsula Times Tribune&quot;, the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; and since 1985 at the &quot;Tribune&quot;, where she was a national correspondent based in Atlanta for five years. Her column started in 1992 and was interrupted for a year when she attended Harvard on a Nieman Fellowship for journalists.

From 1985 Schmich was the writer of &quot;Brenda Starr, Reporter&quot; until its final appearance in January 2011. The long-lived comic strip, set in Chicago, was created by Dale Messick for the Chicago Tribune Syndicate in 1940. Messick continued to the early 1980s; Schmich was the third and final writer, working with the second and third artists.

She has also worked as a professional barrelhouse and ragtime piano player.

About four times a year for some years, Schmich and fellow &quot;Tribune&quot; metro columnist Eric Zorn wrote a week of columns that consisted of a back-and-forth exchange of letters. Each December since 1999, Schmich and Zorn have hosted the &quot;Songs of Good Cheer&quot; holiday caroling parties at the Old Town School of Folk Music to raise money for the Tribune Holiday Fund charities. On December 18, 2020, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Schmich and Zorn held a virtual streaming event that was livecast over YouTube.

Schmich won the annual Pulitzer Prize for Commentary, recognizing 2011 work with the &quot;Tribune&quot;, citing &quot;her wide range of down-to-earth columns that reflect the character and capture the culture of her famed city.&quot;

== &#x27;Wear Sunscreen&#x27; ==

Schmich&#x27;s June 1, 1997, column began with the injunction to wear sunscreen, and continued with discursive advice for living without regret. In her introduction to the column, she described it as the commencement address she would give if she were asked to give one. The column was circulated around the Internet, with an erroneous claim that it was a commencement address by Kurt Vonnegut, usually at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the misattribution became a news item when Vonnegut was contacted by reporters to comment. He told &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;What she wrote was funny, wise and charming, so I would have been proud had the words been mine.&quot;

In 1998, Schmich published the column as a book, &quot;Wear Sunscreen&quot;. In 1999, Baz Luhrmann released a song called &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Free (To Wear Sunscreen)&quot; in which this column is read word for word as written by Schmich, who gave permission and receives royalties. This song was a number one hit in several countries.

Schmich&#x27;s June 1, 1997, column (as well as the Baz Luhrmann song based on it) includes the sentence &quot;Do one thing every day that scares you.&quot; The statement was Schmich&#x27;s original work, but has frequently been misattributed to Eleanor Roosevelt.

<text>Walter Winchell (April 7, 1897 – February 20, 1972) was a syndicated American newspaper gossip columnist and radio news commentator. Originally a vaudeville performer, Winchell began his newspaper career as a Broadway reporter, critic and columnist for New York tabloids. He rose to national celebrity in the 1930s with Hearst newspaper chain syndication and a popular radio program. He was known for an innovative style of gossipy staccato news briefs, jokes, and Jazz Age slang. Biographer Neal Gabler claimed that his popularity and influence &quot;turned journalism into a form of entertainment&quot;.

He uncovered both hard news and embarrassing stories about famous people by exploiting his exceptionally wide circle of contacts, first in the entertainment world and the Prohibition era underworld, then in law enforcement and politics. He was known for trading gossip, sometimes in return for his silence. His outspoken style made him both feared and admired. Novels and movies were based on his wisecracking gossip columnist persona, as early as the play and film &quot;Blessed Event&quot; in 1932. As World War II approached in the 1930s, he attacked the appeasers of Nazism, then in the 1950s aligned with Joseph McCarthy in his campaign against communists. He damaged the reputation of Josephine Baker as well as others who had earned his enmity.

He returned to television in 1959 as the narrator of the 1930s-set crime drama series &quot;The Untouchables&quot;. Over the years he appeared in more than two dozen films and television productions as an actor, sometimes playing himself.

== Early life==
Winchell was born in New York City, the son of Jennie (Bakst) and Jacob Winchell, a cantor and salesman; they were Russian Jewish immigrants. He left school in the sixth grade and started performing in Gus Edwards&#x27;s vaudeville troupe the Newsboys Sextet, which also featured Eddie Cantor and George Jessel. During this time, Winchell performed as a tapdancer. He served in the U.S. Navy during World War I, reaching the rank of lieutenant commander.

== Professional career == 
Winchell began his career in journalism by posting notes about his acting troupe on backstage bulletin boards. He joined the &quot;Vaudeville News&quot; in 1920, then left the paper for the &quot;Evening Graphic&quot; in 1924, where his column was named &quot;Mainly About Mainstreeters&quot;. He was hired on June 10, 1929, by the &quot;New York Daily Mirror&quot;, where he became the author of the first syndicated gossip column, &quot;On-Broadway&quot;. The column was syndicated by King Features Syndicate.

He made his radio debut over WABC in New York, a CBS affiliate, on May 12, 1930. The show, &quot;Saks on Broadway&quot;, was a 15-minute feature that provided business news about Broadway. He switched to WJZ (later renamed WABC) and the NBC Blue (later ABC Radio) in 1932 for the &quot;Jergens Journal&quot;.

Walter Winchell&#x27;s radio-acting career included an episode of &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot;, when on June 28, 1937 he played the role of newspaper reporter Hildy Johnson in a one-hour adaptation of &quot;The Front Page&quot;.

=== Underworld connections ===

By the 1930s, Winchell was &quot;an intimate friend of Owney Madden, New York&#x27;s no. 1 gang leader of the prohibition era,&quot; but in 1932 his intimacy with criminals caused him to fear he would be murdered. He fled to California and &quot;returned weeks later with a new enthusiasm for law, G-men, Uncle Sam, [and] Old Glory&quot;. His coverage of the Lindbergh kidnapping and subsequent trial received national attention. Within two years, he befriended J. Edgar Hoover. He was responsible for turning Louis &quot;Lepke&quot; Buchalter of Murder, Inc. over to Hoover.

His newspaper column was syndicated in a wide array of newspapers worldwide, and he was read by millions every day from the 1920s until the early 1960s. His Sunday night radio broadcast was heard by another 20 million people from 1930 to the late 1950s. In 1948, Winchell had the top-rated radio show when he surpassed Fred Allen and Jack Benny. One indicator of his popularity was being mentioned in Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart&#x27;s 1937 song &quot;The Lady Is a Tramp&quot;: &quot;I follow Winchell and read every line.&quot;

=== Outspoken views ===
Winchell was one of the first commentators in America to attack Adolf Hitler and American pro-fascist and pro-Nazi organizations such as the German-American Bund, especially its leader Fritz Julius Kuhn. He was a staunch supporter of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal throughout the Depression era, and frequently served as the Roosevelt Administration&#x27;s mouthpiece in favor of interventionism as the European war crisis loomed in the late 1930s. Early on, he denounced American isolationists as appeasing Hitler, and explicitly attacked such prominent isolationists as Charles Lindbergh, whom he dubbed &quot;The Lone Ostrich&quot;, and Gerald L.K. Smith, whom he denounced as &quot;Gerald Lucifer KKKodfish Smith&quot;. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Winchell was also an outspoken supporter of civil rights for African Americans, and frequently attacked the Ku Klux Klan and other racist groups as supporting un-American, pro-German goals.

During World War II, he attacked the National Maritime Union, the labor organization for the civilian United States Merchant Marine, which he said was run by Communists, instancing West Coast labor leader Harry Bridges. In 1948 and 1949, he and influential columnist Drew Pearson attacked Secretary of Defense James Forrestal in columns and radio broadcasts.

Subsequently, Winchell began to denounce Communism as the main threat facing America.

=== Television ===
During the 1950s, Winchell supported Senator Joseph McCarthy&#x27;s quest to identify Communists in the entertainment industry. His weekly radio broadcast was broadcast on ABC television on the same day. His program debuted on TV on October 5, 1952. Sponsored by Gruen Watch Company, it originated from WJZ-TV from 6:45 to 7 p.m. ET. By 1953, his radio and television broadcasts were simulcast until he ended that association because of a dispute with ABC executives in 1955. He starred in &quot;The Walter Winchell File&quot;, a television crime drama series that initially aired from 1957 to 1958, dramatizing cases from the New York City Police Department that were covered in the &quot;New York Daily Mirror&quot;. In 1956, he signed with NBC to host a variety program called &quot;The Walter Winchell Show&quot;, which was canceled after only 13 weeks—a particularly bitter failure in view of the success of his longtime rival Ed Sullivan in a similar format with &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. ABC rehired him in 1959 to narrate &quot;The Untouchables&quot; for four seasons. In 1960, a revival of the 1955 television simulcast of Winchell&#x27;s radio broadcast was canceled after six weeks.

In the early 1960s, a public dispute with Jack Paar effectively ended Winchell&#x27;s career—already in decline due to a shift in power from print to television. Winchell had angered Paar several years earlier when he refused to retract an item alleging that Paar was having marital difficulties. Biographer Neal Gabler described the exchange on Paar&#x27;s show in 1961:

Hostess Elsa Maxwell appeared on the program and began gibing at Walter, accusing him of hypocrisy for waving the flag while never having voted [which, incidentally, wasn&#x27;t true; the show later issued a retraction]. Paar joined in. He said Walter&#x27;s column was &quot;written by a fly&quot; and that his voice was so high because he wears &quot;too-tight underwear&quot; … [H]e also told the story of the mistaken item about his marriage, and cracked that Walter had a &quot;hole in his soul&quot;.

On subsequent programs, Paar called Winchell a &quot;silly old man&quot; and cited other examples of his underhanded tactics. No one had previously criticized Winchell publicly, but by then his influence had eroded to the point that he could not effectively respond. The &quot;New York Daily Mirror&quot;, his flagship newspaper for 34 years, closed in 1963; his readership dropped steadily, and he faded from the public eye.

=== Personal ethics ===
Winchell became known for his attempts to destroy the careers of his political and personal enemies as his own career progressed, especially after World War II. Favorite tactics were allegations of having ties to Communist organizations and accusations of sexual impropriety. He was not above name-calling; for example, he called New York radio host Barry Gray &quot;Borey Pink&quot; and a &quot;disk jerk&quot;. Winchell heard that Marlen Edwin Pew of the trade journal &quot;Editor &amp; Publisher&quot; had criticized him as a bad influence and called him &quot;Marlen Pee-you&quot;.

For most of his career, his contracts with newspaper and radio employers required them to hold him harmless from any damages resulting from lawsuits for slander or libel. He unapologetically published material told to him in confidence by friends; when confronted over such betrayals, he typically responded, &quot;I know—I&#x27;m just a son of a bitch.&quot; By the mid-1950s, he was widely seen as arrogant, cruel, and ruthless.

While on an American tour in 1951, Josephine Baker, who never performed before segregated audiences, criticized the Stork Club&#x27;s unwritten policy of discouraging black patrons, then scolded Winchell, an old ally, for not rising to her defense. Winchell responded swiftly with a series of harsh public rebukes, including accusations of Communist sympathies. He spurned any attempts by friends to mitigate the heated rhetoric. The ensuing publicity resulted in the termination of Baker&#x27;s work visa, forcing her to cancel all her engagements and return to France. It was almost a decade before U.S. officials allowed her back into the country. The adverse publicity of this, and similar incidents, undercut his credibility and power.

In his radio and television broadcasts on April 4, 1954, Winchell helped stoke public fear of the polio vaccine. He said, &quot;Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. America ... and all the ships at sea. Attention everyone. In a few moments I will report on a new polio vaccine claimed to be a polio cure. It may be a killer.&quot; Winchell claimed that the U.S. Public Health Services found live polio viruses in seven of ten vaccine batches it tested, reporting, &quot;It killed several monkeys ... the United States Public Health Service will confirm this in about 10 days.&quot; Jonas Salk, developer of the polio vaccine, immediately responded that the vaccine, which had been recently tested on 7,500 schoolchildren at the University of Pittsburgh, had been triple tested for the absence of live virus by its manufacturers, the National Institutes of Health, and his own research lab, and that similar testing would continue to screen out batches containing live virus.

== Style ==
Many other columnists began to write gossip soon after Winchell&#x27;s initial success, such as Ed Sullivan, who succeeded him at the &quot;New York Evening Graphic&quot;, and Louella Parsons in Los Angeles. He wrote in a style filled with slang and incomplete sentences. Winchell&#x27;s casual writing style famously earned him the ire of mobster Dutch Schultz, who confronted him at New York&#x27;s Cotton Club and publicly lambasted him for using the phrase &quot;pushover&quot; to describe Schultz&#x27;s penchant for blonde women. Winchell&#x27;s best known aphorisms include: &quot;Nothing recedes like success&quot; and &quot;I usually get my stuff from people who promised somebody else that they would keep it a secret&quot;.

Herman Klurfeld, a ghostwriter for Winchell for almost three decades, began writing four newspaper columns per week for Winchell in 1936 and worked for him for 29 years. He also wrote many of the signature one-liners, called &quot;lasties&quot;, that Winchell used at the end of his radio broadcasts. One of Klurfeld&#x27;s quips was &quot;She&#x27;s been on more laps than a napkin&quot;. In 1952, the &quot;New York Post&quot; revealed that Klurfeld was Winchell&#x27;s ghostwriter. Klurfeld later wrote a biography of Winchell, &quot;Winchell, His Life and Times&quot;, the basis for the television film &quot;Winchell&quot; (1998).

Winchell opened his radio broadcasts by pressing randomly on a telegraph key, a sound that created a sense of urgency and importance, and using the catchphrase &quot;Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. America from border to border and coast to coast and all the ships at sea. Let&#x27;s go to press.&quot; He then read each of his stories with a staccato delivery (up to a rate of 197 words per minute, though he claimed a speed of well over 200 words per minute in an interview in 1967), noticeably faster than the typical pace of American speech. His diction can also be heard in his breathless narration of the television series &quot;The Untouchables&quot; (1959–1963), as well as in several Hollywood films.

== Personal life ==
On August 11, 1919, Winchell married Rita Greene, one of his onstage partners. The couple separated a few years later, and he moved in with Elizabeth June Magee, who had already adopted daughter Gloria and given birth to her and Winchell&#x27;s first child Walda in 1927. Winchell divorced Greene in 1928, but never married Magee, although they lived together for the rest of their lives.

Winchell and Magee had three children. Daughter Gloria died of pneumonia at age nine and Walda spent time in psychiatric hospitals. Walter Jr. died by suicide in the family garage on Christmas night of 1968. Having spent the previous two years on welfare, Walter Jr. had last been employed as a dishwasher in Santa Ana, California; for a time, he wrote a column in the &quot;Los Angeles Free Press&quot;, an underground newspaper published from 1964 to 1978.

== Later years ==

In the 1960s, Winchell wrote some columns for the film magazine &quot;Photoplay&quot;. He announced his retirement on February 5, 1969, citing his son&#x27;s suicide as a major reason as well as the delicate health of his companion, June Magee. Exactly one year after his retirement, Magee died at a hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, while undergoing treatment for a heart condition.

Winchell spent his final two years as a recluse at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. He died at age 74 in Los Angeles and is buried at Greenwood/Memory Lawn Mortuary &amp; Cemetery in Phoenix. Larry King, who replaced Winchell at the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;, recalled:

He was so sad. You know what Winchell was doing at the end? Typing out mimeographed sheets with his column, handing them out on the corner. That&#x27;s how sad he got. When he died, only one person came to his funeral: his daughter.
Several of Winchell&#x27;s former co-workers expressed a willingness to go but were turned back by Walda.

=== Filmography ===
== Legacy ==
Even during Winchell&#x27;s lifetime, journalists were critical of his effect on the media. In 1940, St. Clair McKelway, who had earlier written a series of articles about him in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, wrote in &quot;Time&quot;:

the effect of Winchellism on the standards of the press... When Winchell began gossiping in 1924 for the late scatological tabloid &quot;Evening Graphic&quot;, no U.S. paper hawked rumors about the marital relations of public figures until they turned up in divorce courts. For 16 years, gossip columns spread until even the staid &quot;New York Times&quot; whispered that it heard from friends of a son of the President that he was going to be divorced. In its first year, &quot;The Graphic&quot; would have considered this news not fit to print... Gossip-writing is at present like a spirochete in the body of journalism... Newspapers... have never been held in less esteem by their readers or exercised less influence on the political and ethical thought of the times.

Winchell responded, &quot;Oh stop! You talk like a high-school student of journalism.&quot;

Despite the controversy surrounding Winchell, his popularity allowed him to leverage support for causes he valued. In 1946, after the death from cancer of his close friend and fellow writer Damon Runyon, Winchell appealed to his radio audience for contributions to fight the disease. The response led Winchell to establish the Damon Runyon Cancer Memorial Fund, since renamed the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation. He led the charity with the support of celebrities, including Marlene Dietrich, Bob Hope, Milton Berle, Marilyn Monroe, and Joe DiMaggio, until his death from cancer in 1972.

In 1950, Ernest Lehman, a former publicity writer for Irving Hoffman of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, wrote a story for &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; titled &quot;Tell Me About It Tomorrow&quot;. The piece is about a ruthless journalist, J.J. Hunsecker, and is generally thought to be a thinly veiled commentary on the power Winchell wielded at the height of his influence. It was made into the 1957 film &quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot;, with a screenplay by Lehman and Clifford Odets.

Walter Winchell is credited for coining the word &quot;frienemy&quot; in an article published by the &quot;Nevada State Journal&quot; on 19 May 1953.

== Winchellism and Winchellese ==
Winchell&#x27;s colorful and widely imitated language inspired the term &quot;Winchellism.&quot; An etymologist of his day said, &quot;Winchell has achieved the position of dictator of contemporary slang.&quot; His use of slang, innuendo, and invented euphemisms also protected him from libel accusations.

Winchell invented phrases viewed as slightly racy at the time. Some of the expressions for falling in love Winchell used were &quot;pashing it&quot;, &quot;sizzle for&quot;, &quot;that way&quot;, &quot;go for each other&quot;, &quot;garbo-ing it&quot;, &quot;uh-huh&quot;; and in a similar vein, &quot;new Garbo, trouser-crease-eraser&quot;, and &quot;pash&quot;. Some Winchellisms for marriage are &quot;middle-aisle it&quot;, &quot;altar it&quot;, &quot;handcuffed&quot;, &quot;Mendelssohn March&quot;, &quot;Lohengrin it&quot;, and &quot;merged&quot;.

== In popular culture ==

<text>Gallaudet University ( ) is a private federally chartered university in Washington, D.C., for the education of the deaf and hard of hearing. It was founded in 1864 as a grammar school for both deaf and blind children. It was the first school for the advanced education of the deaf and hard of hearing in the world and remains the only higher education institution in which all programs and services are specifically designed to accommodate deaf and hard of hearing students. Hearing students are admitted to the graduate school and a small number are also admitted as undergraduates each year. The university was named after Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, a notable figure in the advancement of deaf education.

Gallaudet University is officially bilingual, with American Sign Language (ASL) and written English used for instruction and by the college community. Although there are no specific ASL proficiency requirements for undergraduate admission, many graduate programs require varying degrees of knowledge of the language as a prerequisite. It is classified among &quot;Doctoral/Professional Universities&quot;.

To ensure that the university&#x27;s leadership team can understand the student population needs, the staff is predominantly deaf. In 2025, the President, the chief of staff and the chief academic, bilingual, communications and undergraduate admissions, financial, legal, and operating officers, the dean of student affairs and the Clerc Center chief academic officer are deaf. In line with the same goal of student representativeness, the majority of executive-level appointees are women.

==History==


===Early history (1856–1900)===

In 1856, philanthropist and former United States postmaster general Amos Kendall became aware of several deaf and blind children in Washington, D.C., who were not receiving proper care. Kendall had the courts declare the children to be his wards and donated of his land to establish housing and a school for them. The school was established in 1857 with considerable efforts being made by several concerned citizens, including Edward Miner Gallaudet, of Washington, D.C. Two houses were used at the school&#x27;s inception, one purchased and one rented.

In 1857, the 34th Congress passed H.R. 806, which chartered the grammar school as the Columbia Institution for the Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind and funded tuition costs for indigent deaf, dumb (mute), or blind children belonging to the District of Columbia. Edward Miner Gallaudet was the first superintendent of the new school.

On November 1, 1858, the First Annual Report was submitted to the Secretary of the Interior.
During the school&#x27;s second full year of operation (1858–1859), 14 deaf students and 7 blind students were in attendance. Superintendent Gallaudet, anticipating the future growth of the school, requested money for more buildings, lamenting the fact that the money was not issued in the year prior, due to federal budget problems. The Second Annual Report was submitted November 5, 1859.

During the third academic year (1859–1860), Kendall beseeched the federal government for funds to relocate the school to more spacious grounds. Gallaudet praised Kendall for donating money needed to construct a new brick building; both existing school buildings were already at capacity. There were 24 deaf students, necessitating a second teacher of the deaf. The teacher of the 6 blind students resigned due to health concerns.

By the start of the 1860–1861 academic year, the Civil War had been in progress for over six months. Gallaudet reported that the students were safe and free from fear. There were 35 deaf students and 6 blind students in attendance during the academic year. An art teacher was hired for the first time.

During 1861–1862, new monies provided for industrial education were used to rent a nearby shop in order to teach cabinet-making to the male students. Plans were underway to construct a new building using $9,000 that Congress appropriated to the school. There were 35 deaf students and 6 blind students. During vacation in August a regiment of Union troops used the brick building for a hospital, and some of the students who stayed over the summer helped with tending to the sick soldiers. One soldier died. For the first time, Gallaudet proposed expanding the school to create a college for deaf students.

Even with new construction completed for the 1862–1863 school year, the school was still at capacity and more money was needed to purchase of adjoining land and then build still more buildings. Gallaudet asked for money to pipe in water from the Anacostia River, as the existing cistern and well were inadequate for the school&#x27;s burgeoning needs.
College-level courses were offered for the first time during the 1863–64 academic year. In early 1864, the 38th Congress authorized the institution to grant and confirm college degrees and an enabling act was signed by President Lincoln on April 8. Today, April 8 is celebrated at Gallaudet as &quot;Charter Day&quot; in commemoration of the official beginning of Gallaudet University. The collegiate department became known as the National College for the Deaf and Dumb from 1864 to 1865 and then would be known as the National Deaf-Mute College until 1894. In recognition of his hard work in helping the institution grow during its formative years, Gallaudet was also promoted from superintendent to president. An elaborate inauguration ceremony of Gallaudet as president was held in June with Laurent Clerc in attendance. of land was purchased with money supplied by the government. He continued to push for funds for expansion and new buildings.

The enrollment numbers increased rapidly during the 1864–1865 academic year. That same year, in early 1865, the 38th Congress removed the provision that the institution was to educate the blind, and renamed it the Columbia Institution for the Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb. (This would be the corporate name for the entire institution, including the collegiate division, until 1911, when the legal name was changed to the Columbia Institution for the Deaf.) Gallaudet asked the government for money to accomplish several projects, including the construction of an ice house and a gas house, sewer lines, and more. Major construction from earlier projects continued on campus. Following Gallaudet&#x27;s proposal a year earlier to discontinue services for the small number of blind students the institution had at the time, explaining that the blind students would be better served at a specialized facility, the blind students were henceforth transferred to the school for the blind in Baltimore, Maryland.

During the 1865–1866 academic year, Gallaudet responded to criticism from supporters of the oral method in Massachusetts, saying that oral instruction is usually of little value to congenitally deaf children. Gallaudet proposed that a representative of the school be sent to Europe to study the methods employed there, in order to determine which types of instructional methods might be added to those methods already being used successfully at the Columbia Institution and other American schools. Combined enrollment of all levels of instruction, including the collegiate level, exceeded 100 for the first time during this year. There were 25 students enrolled in the college, including students from 14 states. Edward Allen Fay joined the faculty as a professor of history, having learned to sign as a child.

In the 1866–1867 academic year, the building for the primary school was extended and sickness was thereby reduced. A mathematics professor was hired for the first time. More money was needed to accommodate additional students expected to swell the ranks of the school.
Gallaudet gave a lengthy account of his travels to Europe in 1867 and was very critical of the extent to which speech is taught to deaf children in European schools for the deaf. Nevertheless, he recommended that a limited amount of speech training be afforded to deaf students in America to those who show they can benefit. His travels took him to: Doncaster, England; Birmingham, England; Manchester, England; Liverpool, England; Glasgow, Scotland; Belfast, Ireland; Dublin, Ireland; Geneva, Switzerland; Nancy, France, Saint-Hippolyte-du-Fort, France; Vienna, Austria; Leipsic, Saxony (Leipzig, Germany); Lubec (Lübeck, Germany); Frankfort On-the-Main (Frankfurt, Germany); Brussels, Belgium; Zürich, Switzerland; Rotterdam, Netherlands; Paris, France; Weissenfels, Prussia (Weißenfels, Germany); Prague, Bohemia; (Prague, Czech Republic); Berlin, Prussia (Berlin, Germany); Milan, Italy; Genoa, Italy; Turin, Italy; Dresden, Saxony (Dresden, Germany); London, England; Edinburgh, Scotland; Bordeaux, France; Marseilles, France; Munich, Bavaria (Munich, Germany); Bruges, Belgium; Saint Petersburg, Russia; Åbo, Finland (Turku, Finland); Stockholm, Sweden; and Copenhagen, Denmark.

The biggest educational conference in the then-history of deaf education was held during the month of May 1868 in Washington, D.C., largely made up of principals of schools for the deaf. Fourteen of the twenty-two schools for the deaf were represented. The chief topic of discussion was the recommendations put forth by Edward Gallaudet regarding adding articulation lessons to schools&#x27; curricula.

In 1868–1869, the first students completed a full course of college studies, all three men graduating with bachelor&#x27;s degrees in June.

The founder of the school, Amos Kendall, died in November 1869. Gallaudet delivered a eulogy at the board meeting in January 1870. The main central building, now called Chapel Hall, was partially completed, with rooms in the basement and on the first floor first being used. Plans were being made to purchase Amos Kendall&#x27;s estate, which adjoined the grounds of the school. Gallaudet cautioned Congress that Kendall&#x27;s heirs had plans to subdivide the property if it was not sold to the Columbia Institution, and hence the land would never again become available for purchase as a whole.

In the 1871–1872 academic year, the diplomas of the graduates that summer were signed by President U.S. Grant, beginning a tradition of all Gallaudet graduates having their diplomas signed by the then-serving US president.

In 1881, Laura Sheridan, a hearing woman, inquired about the school accepting women. She was told that deaf women could not enter the institution at the time. In 1887 Gallaudet agreed to allow women to matriculate for the 1887-1888 and 1888–1889 academic years with the understanding that it would be considered an experiment. Temporary living arrangements were made for the 11 students who initially entered. Five female students remained when the school announced in 1889 that the college would be permanently coeducational, with two graduating. One of the students was Agatha Tiegel in the class of 1893, who later married the well-known deaf architect Olof Hanson.

In 1894, the collegiate division was officially renamed Gallaudet College from the National Deaf-Mute College in honor of Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, President Gallaudet&#x27;s father.

===20th century===

In 1911, Congress amended the charter of the institution, changing the corporate name to Columbia Institution for the Deaf. It would remain the legal name for the institution until 1954, when Congress amended the charter to rename it Gallaudet College, which had been the official name of the collegiate department since 1894.

During his 17 years as Dean of the college in the 1950s and 1960s, George Ernst Detmold was a significant figure in helping the college achieve accreditation. He also led the college in developing new departments, especially drama. He directed Gallaudet theater productions, which eventually led to starting the National Theatre of the Deaf.

In 1965, professors at Gallaudet compiled the first-ever dictionary of ASL signs.

In 1986, Congress again amended the charter of the institution, renaming it Gallaudet University.

===Deaf President Now (1988)===
Student strikes at Gallaudet University starting March 6, 1988, revolutionized the perception and education of Deaf culture. Deaf students were outraged at the selection of another hearing president, Elisabeth Zinser; the university had never selected a deaf person for this position. Alumni, faculty, staff, and students demanded that the next president of the university be deaf. After a week of protest and activism, Zinser resigned and was replaced by I. King Jordan. This movement became known as &quot;Deaf President Now&quot; (DPN).

===Unity for Gallaudet Movement (2006)===


Jordan announced his retirement in September 2005. On May 1, 2006, the university&#x27;s board of trustees announced that Jane Fernandes, the university&#x27;s then-current provost, would be the university&#x27;s next president. This was met with protests from the student body – in person, on campus, and in internet blogs and forums.

Initially, students cited the lack of racial diversity among finalists, Fernandes&#x27;s lack of warmth, and her lack of fluency in American Sign Language.

Jordan publicly accused some critics of rejecting Fernandes because &quot;she is not deaf enough.&quot; He described the protest as &quot;identity politics&quot;, saying, &quot;We are squabbling about what it means to be deaf.&quot;

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Fernandes &quot;would like to see the institution become more inclusive of people who might not have grown up using sign language&quot;, stating that Gallaudet must embrace &quot;all kinds of deaf people&quot;. Those who opposed her said that they feared a &quot;weakening of American Sign Language at an institution that should be its standard-bearer.&quot; Protesters said Fernandes distorted their arguments and that the protest centered on her inability to lead, an unfair selection process and longstanding problems at the school.

In the spring 2006 protest, students blocked entrances to the Gallaudet campus, held rallies, and set up tents near the university&#x27;s main entrance. Fernandes, appointed to serve as president-designate until Jordan retired, said that she would not step down. On May 8, the faculty gave a vote of no confidence for Fernandes.

When the fall 2006 academic year resumed, some students, faculty, staff, and alumni continued their protest, calling for Fernandes to step down and for the presidential search to be done again. On October 11, a group of protesting students shut down the campus. On October 16 at a regularly scheduled meeting, faculty members voted 138 to 24 to block Fernandes from becoming president of Gallaudet University.

Fernandes said, &quot;I really don&#x27;t understand so I have to believe it&#x27;s not about me. ... I believe it&#x27;s about evolution and change and growth in the deaf community.&quot;

On October 29, the university withdrew the appointment of Fernandes. In an opinion piece in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Jordan defended Fernandes&#x27;s remarks and denounced the board&#x27;s decision and the actions of the protesters, saying, &quot;I am convinced that the board made a serious error in acceding to the demands of the protesters by terminating Fernandes&#x27;s presidency before it began.&quot;

On December 10, 2006, the Board of Trustees announced that Robert Davila would serve as interim president for a period of up to two years. He was formally installed on May 9, 2007, during a ceremony that included a speech by D.C. Congressional Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, who spoke positively of the 2006 protest. He stepped down on December 31, 2009.

On June 29, 2007, in the aftermath of the controversy over the university&#x27;s presidency, Gallaudet was temporarily placed on probation by its accreditation organization, the Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. It was also reported that in 2006, the Office of Management and Budget had found that &quot;Gallaudet failed to meet its goals or showed declining performance in key areas, including the number of students who stay in school, graduate and either pursue graduate degrees or find jobs upon graduation.&quot; In January 2007, former president Jordan wrote an editorial on the topic that appeared in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. The Middle States Commission later reaffirmed Gallaudet&#x27;s accreditation on June 27, 2008.

On October 18, 2009, the Board of Trustees announced that Gallaudet&#x27;s tenth president would be Alan Hurwitz. He began his tenure on January 1, 2010, and served until he retired on December 31, 2015, succeeded by Roberta Cordano, the eleventh president.

==Congressional charter==
The university acknowledges that it &quot;is a congressionally created corporation that serves governmental objectives.&quot;
The university and the US Department of Education explain that Gallaudet has been structured by the Federal Government to take the form of a &quot;federally chartered, private, non-profit educational institution.&quot; The federal government plays various roles within the institution:
* Congress incorporated the Columbia Institution in 1857, significantly amended its charter in 1954, and authorized permanent congressional appropriations. In 1986, Congress passed the Education of the Deaf Act and amended it in 1992. These Congressional acts are part of &quot;the supreme law of Gallaudet University.&quot;
* Gallaudet must obtain authorization from the secretary of the US Department of Education in order to sell or transfer title of any of its real property.
* The diplomas of all Gallaudet graduates are signed by the current U.S. president, which dates from President U.S. Grant signing students&#x27; diplomas in 1869.
* Three members of Congress are appointed to the university&#x27;s board of trustees as &quot;Public Members&quot;.
* Gallaudet must provide annual reports to the secretary of education.
* &quot;Gallaudet receives the bulk of its income in the form of an annual appropriation from Congress, and the Department of Education oversees the University&#x27;s appropriation for the Federal government.&quot;
* Gallaudet University (and the National Technical Institute for the Deaf) are authorized to make purchases through the General Services Administration.

Gallaudet&#x27;s Fifty-Fifth Annual Report contains an appendix that includes the text of 99 Federal Acts related to Gallaudet/Columbia which were enacted between 1857 and 1912.

===Presidential visits===
There have been 15 occasions to date in Gallaudet&#x27;s history when a US president has visited either the campus or attended an official function off campus. President Johnson&#x27;s second visit, in 1966, was unannounced and impromptu. President Taft had promised to attend President Percival Hall&#x27;s installation on May 10, 1911, and give an address, but cancelled at the last minute before the ceremony. President Kennedy had planned to attend the centennial celebration at Gallaudet in 1964, but was assassinated.

* President Ulysses S. Grant, 1870 and 1871.
* President Rutherford B. Hayes, 1877, 1878, 1879, and 1880.
* President James A. Garfield, 1881.
* President Chester A. Arthur, 1882.
* President Grover Cleveland, 1885.
* President Benjamin Harrison, 1889 (two visits, May and June).
* President Theodore Roosevelt, 1906.
* President Lyndon Baines Johnson, 1964 and 1966.
* President Bill Clinton, 1994.

==Academics==
Several programs and majors are offered at Gallaudet University. The five most popular majors are business, visual and performing arts, communication studies, physical education, and psychology. Gallaudet University offers thirty graduate programs in ten Departments as well as on-line and on-campus continuing education courses. Over 90 percent of the classes offered at Gallaudet University contain fewer than 20 students. The freshman retention rate at the university is 69–77 percent, the four-year graduation rate is 17–27 percent, and the six-year graduation rate is 43–53 percent (for freshmen entering 2008–2012).

Classes are conducted in ASL with no spoken English, and curriculum materials are designed in both ASL and English. The classrooms are visually-oriented, and are organized around the philosophy of DeafSpace, such as all the desks arranged in a circle so that all students and teachers can see one another for discussions. If a professor needs to get the attention of the classroom, they will flash a light signal.

==Campus==

===Historic designations===
The Gallaudet campus, comprising the Gallaudet College Historic District, has been designated a historic place on several registries and surveys:
* Gallaudet College Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.
* District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites (listings added in 1964 and 1973).
* National Historic Landmarks designation (added 1965).
* Historic American Buildings Survey (added 1933).

===Pre-college education===
The campus is shared with Kendall Demonstration Elementary School, a day school serving deaf and hard of hearing students from birth through grade 8, and the Model Secondary School for the Deaf, a day and residential high school for deaf and hard of hearing students.

Gallaudet also operates a child development center with admissions priority for children of faculty, staff, and students. Separate from the KDES Early Childhood Program, the child development center is inclusive of, but not exclusively for, deaf and hard-of-hearing children.

===Redevelopment of campus (2015–2024)===
In October 2014, the Gallaudet University board of trustees announced a 10-year, $450 million development of its campus along 6th Street NE. The development, which includes both campus property as well as college-owned residential and retail property across the street, will be overseen by JBG Smith.

==Athletics==
Gallaudet athletic teams are the Bison. The university is a member of the Division III level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing as a core member of the United East Conference (formerly known as the North Eastern Athletic Conference (NEAC) until after the 2020–21 academic year) for most its sports since the 2010–11 academic year; in the Eastern Collegiate Football Conference for football; and as Independents for their men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming &amp; diving and track &amp; field teams. The Bison previously competed in the Capital Athletic Conference from 1989–90 to 2009–10.

Their colors are buff and blue, which were chosen after Union soldiers&#x27; uniforms in the Civil War.

Gallaudet competes in 16 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, soccer, swimming and track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor); while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, soccer, softball, swimming, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor) and volleyball. Club sports include cheerleading for both men and women.

===Facilities===
The football and soccer teams play at Hotchkiss Field with the track and field teams using Berg Track located within Hotchkiss Field for track meets. Basketball and volleyball use the GU Field House for home games. Hoy Field is home to the baseball team and the GU Softball Complex hosts the softball team.

===Women&#x27;s basketball===
Gallaudet women&#x27;s basketball made its biggest splash in 1999, with a group of players from the Minnesota State Academy for the Deaf among those leading the way. Ronda Jo Miller, most certainly the greatest women&#x27;s basketball player in the program&#x27;s history, was a three-time Division III All-America selection, as well as one of the top women&#x27;s volleyball players.

Under the leadership of coach Kitty Baldridge, Miller, Touria Ouahid, Ronda Johnson and Jenny Cooper led the Bison to the NCAA Tournament for the second time in three seasons. Receiving one of the lowest seeds as an at-large team into the Division III NCAA Tournament field, which numbered just 48 teams, the Bison traveled to St. Mary&#x27;s College (Md.), the school which had just defeated them in the Capital Athletic Conference tournament, and came away with an 80–73 win. In the second round, Gallaudet faced a team from The College of New Jersey which had received a first-round bye and was highly favored, but Miller poured in 38 points, using a variety of impressive shots. The Bison advanced to the Sweet 16 round of the 1999 tournament before falling to host school Salem State College (Mass.).

Miller finished with 2,656 points scored, 1,545 rebounds and 373 blocked shots, and was called &quot;one of the best basketball players in Division III history&quot; by the NCAA.

Kevin Cook coached the team briefly to success. The team had not won a conference game in five years and even lost a game by 75 points in Cook&#x27;s first year in charge. Cook&#x27;s persistence on defense and discipline turned the program around. Gallaudet began the 2010–11 season on a 20-game winning streak and finished the season 24–4 (20–2 in conference play). Cook was named North Eastern Athletic Conference Coach of the Year, and senior Easter Faafiti was voted NEAC Player of the Year. The 2010–11 season ended in the first round of the Division III NCAA Championships with a loss to Juniata.

After a victory over Penn State-Berks in the 2010–11 season, Penn State guard Corin Bishop &quot;said that she views the Gallaudet team as a great basketball team, not a team of deaf players.&quot; Hayes of Gallaudet later said, &quot;I feel like there are people who stereotype us as deaf players, I&#x27;m just like everyone else who plays basketball&quot;. In an interview with Lydia Lum of &quot;Diverse&quot;, he said, &quot;Because of us, there&#x27;s a growing awareness that there are differences between deaf people, but we&#x27;re all the same.&quot;

===Football===

The football huddle originated at Gallaudet when the team noticed that their opponents were trying to see and read their signs in order to try to guess their plays.

After an undefeated season in 2005, which was achieved after 122 years, head coach Ed Hottle began his campaign to return Gallaudet to the NCAA ranks. With support from the Gallaudet administration, the Bison played their last season of club football in 2006 and played a full NCAA slate of eight games in 2007.

After the 2009 football season, Coach Hottle left to become the first head coach of the first football team at Stevenson University. Offensive Coordinator Chuck Goldstein was tapped to be the interim head coach of the football team. On December 17, 2009, the interim tag was removed and he is now the permanent head coach of the team.

Gallaudet University&#x27;s football team has a longstanding rivalry with Catholic University of America, another school in the Washington, D.C., area. On September 7, 2012, Gallaudet University defeated Catholic University of America for the first time in the 106-year history of the rivalry between the two D.C. schools.

In the fall of 2013, Gallaudet&#x27;s football program began a remarkable run for the Division III playoffs and garnering a considerable amount of publicity, winning the regular season with a 9–1 record, before falling to Hobart College in the first round of the playoffs and ending the season with a 9–2 (.818) overall record.

===Volleyball===
In 2006, the Gallaudet women&#x27;s volleyball team ended their season 30–10 after a history-making run to the Sweet Sixteen in the NCAA Division III tournament. Tamijo Foronda, a senior outside hitter, was named to the AVCA All-American Team.

===Noted athletes===
Notable athletes that have attended the university include:
* Dawn Birley won several national Canadian Taekwondo championships.

==Greek life==
The campus Greek community is relatively small with only three fraternities and three sororities. The three fraternities are Alpha Sigma Pi, Kappa Gamma and Kappa Sigma. The three sororities are Delta Epsilon, Phi Kappa Zeta, and Kappa Theta Phi.

==National Deaf Life Museum==
Gallaudet is home to the National Deaf Life Museum, established in 2007 as the Gallaudet University Museum. The museum focuses on the culture and history of deaf and hard of hearing people in the United States, with special attention given to Gallaudet history and alumni. The museum is located in Chapel Hall, while museum staff are housed in the campus Gate House. Exhibits created by the museum include highlighting notable alumni such as Olof Hanson, Robert Panara, and Andrew Jackson Foster; &quot;Deaf HERstory&quot;, focusing on the lives and activism of deaf women; and &quot;Deaf Difference + Space Survival&quot;, highlighting the story of the &quot;Gallaudet Eleven&quot; who contributed to NASA&#x27;s studies of motion sickness and weightlessness during the Space Race.

==Research==
The Gallaudet Office of Research Support and International Affairs (RSIA) (formerly Gallaudet Research Institute or GRI) is internationally recognized for its leadership in deafness-related research. RSIA researchers gather and analyze data concerning the social, academic, and perceptual characteristics of deaf and hard of hearing populations, primarily to provide information needed by educators in the field. Staff are skilled in various research methodologies including surveys, test norming and assessment, ethnographic studies, clinical studies, and information management. In 2016, RSIA began hosting the Gallaudet Research Expo, to give students, faculty, and staff &quot;the opportunity to share ideas and showcase scholarly pursuits and achievements.&quot; Presentations represent &quot;education, linguistics, STM, neuroscience, interpretation and translation, computer science, audiology, psychology, deaf studies, and other fields that reflect Gallaudet&#x27;s research priorities.&quot; 

Gallaudet University Press publishes two academic journals, &quot;American Annals of the Deaf&quot; (est. 1847) and &quot;Sign Language Studies&quot; (est. 1972). The &quot;Annals&quot; are &quot;the oldest and most widely read English-language journal dealing with deafness and the education of deaf persons.&quot;

The Department of Psychology&#x27;s chapter of Psi Chi publishes the journal &quot;Gallaudet Chronicles of Psychology&quot;. The journal is managed and edited by graduate student members of the chapter. The &quot;Chronicles&quot; are designed to &quot;mimic professional, peer-reviewed journals&quot; and provides graduate students with the opportunity to disseminate their original psychology research. In 2018, the chapter will be publishing the fifth volume of the &quot;Chronicles&quot;.

In the fall of 2010, the university&#x27;s Department of Deaf Studies launched the &quot;Deaf Studies Digital Journal&quot; (&quot;DSDJ&quot;), the first peer-reviewed academic and creative arts journal in American Sign Language and English. The &quot;DSDJ&quot; itself is published in entirely video-based content and is available online. To date, only four issues of &quot;DSDJ&quot; have been released, the most recent being published in 2014.

<doc id="184192" wikidata="Q938876" url="?curid=184192" title="Studebaker">
<text>Studebaker was an American wagon and automobile manufacturer based in South Bend, Indiana, with a building at 1600 Broadway, Times Square, Midtown Manhattan, New York City. Founded in 1852 and incorporated in 1868 as the Studebaker Brothers Manufacturing Company, the firm was originally a coachbuilder, manufacturing wagons, buggies, carriages and harnesses.

Studebaker entered the automotive business in 1902 with electric vehicles and in 1904 with gasoline vehicles, all sold under the name &quot;Studebaker Automobile Company&quot;. Until 1911, its automotive division operated in partnership with the Garford Company of Elyria, Ohio, and after 1909 with the E-M-F Company and with the Flanders Automobile Company. The first gasoline automobiles to be fully manufactured by Studebaker were marketed in August 1912. Over the next 50 years, the company established a reputation for quality, durability and reliability.

After an unsuccessful 1954 merger with Packard (the Studebaker-Packard Corporation) and failure to solve chronic postwar cashflow problems, the &#x27;Studebaker Corporation&#x27; name was restored in 1962, but the South Bend plant ceased automobile production on December 20, 1963, and the last Studebaker automobile rolled off the Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, assembly line on March 17, 1966. Studebaker continued as an independent manufacturer before merging with Wagner Electric in May 1967 and then Worthington Corporation in February 1968 to form Studebaker-Worthington.

== History ==
=== German forebears ===
The ancestors of the Studebaker family descend from Solingen, Germany. They arrived in America at the port of Philadelphia on September 1, 1736, on the ship &quot;Harle&quot;, (see Exhibit B) from Rotterdam, Netherlands, (see Exhibit A, p. 11), original manuscripts now in the Pennsylvania State Library at Harrisburg). This included Peter Studebaker and his wife Anna Margetha Studebaker, Clement Studebaker (Peter&#x27;s brother) and his wife, Anna Catherina Studebaker and Heinrich Studebaker (Peter&#x27;s cousin). (see Exhibit A, p. 11)
In 1918, Albert Russel Erskine, Studebaker Corporation president, wrote the book, &quot;History of the Studebaker Corporation&quot;, including the 1918 annual report, &quot;Written for the information of the 3,000 stockholders of the Studebaker Corporation, the 12,000 dealers in its products living throughout the world, its 15,000 employees and numberless friends.&quot; (see Exhibit A, p. 9) This book was verified by lawyers and accountants and all board members and was a legal document. (see Exhibit A, p. 7) In the same book, Albert Russel Erskin, accurately wrote that Peter Studebaker was the &quot;wagon-maker, which trade later became the foundation of the family fortune and the corporation which now bears his name.&quot; (see Exhibit A, p. 11)

&quot;The tax list of York County, Pennsylvania, in 1798–9 showed among the taxable were Peter Studebaker Sr. and Peter Studebaker Jr. wagon-makers, which trade later became the foundation of the family fortune and the corporation which now bears his name.&quot; (see Exhibit D) &quot;John Studebaker, father of the five brothers [that began the Studebaker Corporation] was the son of Peter Studebaker. (see Exhibit A, p. 13). John Clement Studebaker (son of Clement Studebaker and Sarah Rensel) was born February 8, 1799, Westmorland, PA, and died in 1877 in South Bend, St. Joseph, IN. John Studebaker (1799–1877) moved to Ohio in 1835 with his wife Rebecca (née Mohler) (1802–1887).

=== The five brothers ===


The five sons were, in order of birth: Henry (1826–1895), Clement (1831–1901), John Mohler (1833–1917), Peter Everst (1836–1897) and Jacob Franklin (1844–1887). The boys had five sisters. Photographs of the brothers and their parents are reproduced in the 1918 company history, which was written by Erskine after he became president, in memory of John M., whose portrait appears on the front cover.

=== 18th-century colonial family business ===
In 1740 Peter Studebaker built his home on a property known as “Bakers Lookout”. (The home still stands in Hagerstown, Maryland.) The first Studebaker wagon factory was built in the same year next to the home. On Bakers Lookout Peter, master of the German Cutler Guild, built the first Studebaker home, the first Studebaker wagon factory where he began forging and tempering steel and seasoning wood in the colonies. Peter Studebaker built the first Studebaker mill and a wagon road. Broadfording Wagon Road was built to run through the property. Peter owned property on both sides of the Conococheague Creek, so he built a bridge over the creek in 1747. Peter began the family business on the Bakers Lookout property where he made his home and built the first Studebaker wagon factory. In this factory, Peter manufactured everything, all necessities including products he made in Solingen, Germany, and naturally wagons. Bakers Lookout, the 1740, 100-acre land patent, Hagerstown, Maryland, was the first of many land patents to be acquired by Peter Studebaker. Peter purchased approximately 1500 acres in what is now known state of Maryland. The home still stands today and is proof of the advanced technology of Peter Studebaker. (see Bakers Lookout Peter Studebakers 1740 home website)

In 1747 Peter Studebaker built a road through his owned properties known as Broadfording Wagon Road. The road he built carried heavy traffic to Bakers Lookout&#x27;s wagon and forging services that were instrumental to expand the west. The Maryland Historical Trust WA-I-306 writes 04/03/2001, that this road was &quot;One of Washington County&#x27;s earliest thoroughfares, Broadfording (Wagon) Road was already in existence in 1747.&quot; (see Exhibit I) The wagon transportation industry boomed. On the property, Broadfording Wagon Road built in 1740 by Peter Studebaker, went directly through the property to allow access from the home to the factory and to the mill.

Although Peter Studebaker&#x27;s life in the colonies was short, less than 18 years, the family business flourished through his descendants (see Exhibit M) and apprentices expanded the vast land holdings enlarging the Studebaker family business and its industrious wagon-making region. Peter&#x27;s trade secrets were passed from father to son, generation to generation. The Studebaker family business plan, purchasing, again and again, vast amounts of land, on which they built industrious farms with mills and wagon making facilities and wagon selling facilities, each identical to the Bakers Lookout situation, industrious farms, much acreage, on which one finds the necessary resources, lumber, iron ore, oil shale and land selected with stream, spring, or river to hydropower factories, mills and equipment. Peter&#x27;s technology-enabled expansion of the family business through the famous Conestoga and Prairie Schooner wagon designs. Peter&#x27;s trade was the stepping-stone that expanded the transportation industry. Thomas E. Bonsall, wrote &quot;Much more than the story of a family business; it is also, in microcosm, the story of the industrial development of America.&quot; Peter Studebaker died in the mid-1750s.

==== End of horse-drawn era ====
John M. Studebaker had always viewed the automobile as complementary to the horse-drawn wagon, pointing out that the expense of maintaining a car might be beyond the resources of a small farmer. In 1918, when Erskine&#x27;s history of the firm was published, the annual capacity of the seven Studebaker plants was 100,000 automobiles, 75,000 horse-drawn vehicles, and about $10,000,000 worth of automobile and vehicle spare parts ($ in dollars ). In the preceding seven years, 466,962 horse-drawn vehicles had been sold, as against 277,035 automobiles, but the trend was all too clear. The regular manufacture of horse-drawn vehicles ended when Erskine ordered the removal of the last wagon gear in 1919. To its range of cars, Studebaker would now add a truck line to replace the horse-drawn wagons. Buses, fire engines, and even small rail locomotive-kits were produced using the same powerful six-cylinder engines.

=== Studebaker automobiles 1897–1966 ===
==== In the beginning ====
In 1895, John M. Studebaker&#x27;s son-in-law Fred Fish urged for development of &#x27;a practical horseless carriage&#x27;. When, on Peter Studebaker&#x27;s death, Fish became chairman of the executive committee in 1897, the firm had an engineer working on a motor vehicle. At first, Studebaker opted for electric (battery-powered) over gasoline propulsion. While manufacturing its own Studebaker Electric vehicles from 1902 to 1911, the company entered into body-manufacturing and distribution agreements with two makers of gasoline-powered vehicles, Garford of Elyria, Ohio, and the Everitt-Metzger-Flanders (E-M-F) Company of Detroit and Walkerville, Ontario. Studebaker began making gasoline-engined cars in partnership with Garford in 1904.

==== Studebaker marque established in 1911 ====


In 1910, it was decided to refinance and incorporate as the Studebaker Corporation, which was concluded on February 14, 1911, under New Jersey laws. The company discontinued making electric vehicles that same year. The financing was handled by Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs who provided board representatives including Henry Goldman whose contribution was especially esteemed.

After taking over E-M-F&#x27;s Detroit facilities, Studebaker sought to remedy customer dissatisfaction complaints by paying mechanics to visit each disgruntled owner and replace defective parts in their vehicles, at a total cost of US$1 million ($ in dollars). The worst problem was rear-axle failure. Hendry comments that the frenzied testing resulted in Studebaker&#x27;s aim to design &#x27;for life&#x27;—and the consequent emergence of &quot;a series of really rugged cars... the famous Big Six and Special Six&quot; listed at $2,350 ($ in dollars ). From that time, Studebaker&#x27;s own marque was put on all new automobiles produced at the former E-M-F facilities as an assurance that the vehicles were well built.

In 1913, the company experienced the first major labor strike in the automotive industry, the 1913 Studebaker strike.

==== Engineering advances from WWI ====
The corporation benefited from enormous orders cabled by the British government at the outbreak of World War I. They included 3,000 transport wagons, 20,000 sets of artillery harness, 60,000 artillery saddles, and ambulances, as well as hundreds of cars purchased through the London office. Similar orders were received from the governments of France and Russia.

The 1913 six-cylinder models were the first cars to employ the important advancement of monobloc engine casting which became associated with a production-economy drive in the years of the war. At that time, a 28-year-old university graduate engineer, Fred M. Zeder, was appointed chief engineer. He was the first of a trio of brilliant technicians, with Owen R. Skelton and Carl Breer, who launched the successful 1918 models, and were known as &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;. They left in 1920 to form a consultancy, later to become the nucleus of Chrysler Engineering. The replacement chief engineer was Guy P. Henry, who introduced molybdenum steel, an improved clutch design, and presided over the six-cylinders-only policy favored by new president Albert Russel Erskine, who replaced Fred Fish in July 1915.

==== First auto proving ground ====
In 1925, the corporation&#x27;s most successful distributor and dealer Paul G. Hoffman came to South Bend as vice president in charge of sales. In 1926, Studebaker became the first automobile manufacturer in the United States to open a controlled outdoor proving ground on which, in 1937, would be planted 5,000 pine trees in a pattern that spelled &quot;STUDEBAKER&quot; when viewed from the air. Also in 1926, the last of the Detroit plant was moved to South Bend under the control of Harold S Vance, vice president in charge of production and engineering. That year, a new small car, the Erskine Six was launched in Paris, resulting in 26,000 sales abroad and many more in America. By 1929, the sales list had been expanded to 50 models and business was so good that 90% of earnings were being paid out as dividends to shareholders in a highly competitive environment. However, the end of that year ushered in the Great Depression that resulted in many layoffs and massive national unemployment for several years.

==== Facilities in the 1920s ====

Studebaker&#x27;s total plant area in Indiana was , spread over three locations, with buildings occupying 7.5 million square feet of floor space. Annual production capacity was 180,000 cars, requiring 23,000 employees.

The original South Bend vehicle plant continued to be used for small forgings, springs, and making some body parts. Separate buildings totaling over one million square feet were added in 1922–1923 for the Light, Special, and Big Six models. At any one time, 5,200 bodies were in process. South Bend&#x27;s Plant 2 made chassis for the Light Six and had a foundry of , producing 600 tons of castings daily.

Plant 3 at Detroit made complete chassis for Special and Big Six models in over of floor space and was located between Clark Avenue and Scotten Avenue south of Fort Street. Plant 5 was the service parts store and shipping facility, plus the executive offices of various technical departments. The Detroit facilities were moved to South Bend in 1926, except that the Piquette Avenue Plant (Plant 10) was retained for assembly of the Erskine between 1927 and 1929 and the Rockne (1931–1933).

Plant 7 was at Walkerville, Ontario, Canada, where complete cars were assembled from components that had been shipped from South Bend and Detroit factories or locally made in Canada, and is in close proximity to the current Ford Windsor Engine Factory. Output was designated for the Canadian (left-hand drive) and British Empire (right-hand drive) trade. By locating it there, Studebaker could advertise the cars as &quot;British-built&quot; and qualify for reduced tariffs. This manufacturing facility had been acquired from E-M-F in 1910 (see above). By 1929, it had been the subject of $1.25 million investment and was providing employment that supported 500 families.

==== Impact of the 1930s depression ====

Few industrialists were prepared for the Wall Street Crash of October 1929. Though Studebaker&#x27;s production and sales had been booming, the market collapsed and plans were laid for a new, small, low-cost car—the Rockne. However, times were too bad to sell even inexpensive cars. Within a year, the firm was cutting wages and laying off workers. Company president Albert Russel Erskine maintained faith in the Rockne and rashly had the directors declare huge dividends in 1930 and 1931. He also acquired 95% of the White Motor Company&#x27;s stock at an inflated price and in cash. By 1933, the banks were owed $6 million, ($ in dollars ) though current assets exceeded that figure. On March 18, 1933, Studebaker entered receivership. Erskine was pushed out of the presidency in favor of more cost-conscious managers. Erskine committed suicide on July 1, 1933, leaving successors Harold Vance and Paul Hoffman to deal with the problems.

By December 1933, the company was back in profit with $5.75 million working capital and 224 new Studebaker dealers, while the purchase of White was cancelled. With the substantial aid of Lehman Brothers, full refinancing and reorganization was achieved on March 9, 1935. A new car was put on the drawing boards under chief engineer Delmar &quot;Barney&quot; Roos—the Champion. Its final styling was designed by Virgil Exner and Raymond Loewy. The Champion doubled the company&#x27;s previous-year sales when it was introduced in 1939.

==== World War II ====
From the 1920s to the 1930s, the South Bend company had originated many style and engineering milestones, including the Light Four, Light Six, Special Six, Big Six models, the Dictator, the record-breaking Commander and President, followed by the 1939 Champion. During World War II, Studebaker produced the Studebaker US6 truck in great quantity and the unique M29 Weasel cargo and personnel carrier. Studebaker ranked 28th among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts. An assembly plant in California, Studebaker Pacific Corporation, built engine assemblies and nacelles for B-17s and PV-2 Harpoons. After cessation of hostilities, Studebaker returned to building automobiles.

==== Post-WWII styling ====


Studebaker prepared well in advance for the anticipated postwar market and launched the slogan &quot;First by far with a post-war car&quot;. This advertising premise was substantiated by Virgil Exner&#x27;s designs, notably the 1947 Studebaker Starlight coupé, which introduced innovative styling features that influenced later cars, including the flatback &quot;trunk&quot; instead of the tapered look of the time, and a wrap-around rear window. For 1950 and 1951, the Champion and Commander adopted a polarizing appearance from Exner&#x27;s concepts, and were applied to the 1950 Studebaker Starlight coupe. The new trunk design prompted a running joke that one could not tell if the car was coming or going, and appeared to be influenced by the Lockheed P-38 Lightning, particularly by the shortened fuselage with wrap around canopy. During the war the Studebaker Chippewa Factory was the primary location for aircraft engines used in the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and the marketing department attempted to evoke a reference to their contribution to the war effort.

==== Industry price war brings on crisis ====
Studebaker&#x27;s strong postwar management team including president Paul G Hoffman and Roy Cole (vice president, engineering) had left by 1949 and was replaced by more cautious executives who failed to meet the competitive challenge brought on by Henry Ford II and his Whiz Kids. Massive discounting in a price war between Ford and General Motors, which began with Ford&#x27;s massive increase in production in the spring of 1953—part of Ford&#x27;s postwar expansion program aimed at restoring it to the position of the largest car maker which GM had held since 1931—could not be equaled by the independent carmakers, for whom the only hope was seen as a merger of Studebaker, Packard, Hudson, and Nash into a fourth giant combine after Chrysler. This had been unsuccessfully attempted by George W. Mason. In this scheme, Studebaker had the disadvantage that its South Bend location would make consolidation difficult. Its labor costs were also the highest in the industry.

== Merger with Packard ==
Ballooning labor costs (the company had never had an official United Auto Workers (UAW) strike and Studebaker workers and retirees were among the highest paid in the industry), quality control issues, and the new-car sales war between Ford and General Motors in the early 1950s wrought havoc on Studebaker&#x27;s balance sheet. Professional financial managers stressed short-term earnings rather than long-term vision. Momentum was sufficient to keep going for another 10 years, but stiff competition and price-cutting by the Big Three doomed the enterprise.

From 1950 Studebaker declined rapidly, and by 1954 was losing money. It negotiated a strategic takeover by Packard, a smaller but less financially troubled car manufacturer. However, the cash position was worse than it had led Packard to believe, and by 1956, the company (renamed Studebaker-Packard Corporation and under the guidance of CEO James J. Nance) was nearly bankrupt, though it continued to make and market both Studebaker and Packard cars until 1958. The &quot;Packard&quot; element was retained until 1962, when the name reverted to &quot;Studebaker Corporation&quot;.

== Contract with Curtiss-Wright ==
A three-year management contract was made by CEO Nance with aircraft maker Curtiss-Wright in 1956 with the aim of improving finances due to Studebaker&#x27;s experience building aircraft engines during the war and military grade trucks. C-W&#x27;s president, Roy T. Hurley, attempted to reduce labor costs. Under C-W&#x27;s guidance, Studebaker-Packard also sold the old Detroit Packard plant and returned the then-new Packard plant on Conner Avenue (where Packard production had moved in 1954, at the same time Packard took its body-making operations in house after its longtime body supplier, Briggs Manufacturing Company, was acquired by Chrysler in late 1953) to its lessor, Chrysler. The company became the American importer for Mercedes-Benz, Auto Union, and DKW automobiles and many Studebaker dealers sold those brands, as well. C-W gained the use of idle car plants and tax relief on their aircraft profits while Studebaker-Packard received further working capital to continue car production.

== Last automobiles produced ==
The automobiles that came after the diversification process began, including the redesigned compact Lark (1959) and the Avanti sports car (1962), were based on old chassis and engine designs. The Lark, in particular, was based on existing parts to the degree that it even used the central body section of the company&#x27;s 1953–58 cars, but was a clever enough design to be popular in its first year, selling over 130,000 units and delivering a $28.6 million profit to the automaker ($ in dollars). &quot;S-P rose from 56,920 units in 1958 to 153,844 in 1959.&quot;

However, Lark sales began to drop precipitously after the Big Three manufacturers introduced their own compact models in 1960, and the situation became critical once the so-called &quot;senior compacts&quot; debuted for 1961. The Lark had provided a temporary reprieve, but nothing proved enough to stop the financial bleeding.

A labor strike occurred at the South Bend plant starting on January 1, 1962, and lasting 38 days. The strike came to an end after an agreement was reached between company president Sherwood H. Egbert and Walter P. Reuther, president of the UAW. Despite a sales uptick in 1962, continuing media reports that Studebaker was about to leave the auto business became a self-fulfilling prophecy as buyers shied away from the company&#x27;s products for fear of being stuck with an &quot;orphan&quot;. NBC reporter Chet Huntley made a television program called &quot;Studebaker – Fight for Survival&quot; which aired on May 18, 1962. By 1963, all of the company&#x27;s automobiles and trucks were selling poorly.

== Exit from auto business ==
=== Closure of South Bend plant, 1963 ===
After insufficient initial sales of the 1964 models and the ousting of president Sherwood Egbert, on December 9, 1963, the company announced the closure of the aging South Bend plant. The last Larks and Hawks were assembled on December 20, and the last Avanti was assembled on December 26. To fulfill government contracts, production of military trucks and Zip Vans for the United States Postal Service continued into early 1964. The engine foundry remained open until the union contract expired in May 1964. The supply of engines produced in the first half of 1964 supported Zip Van assembly until the government contract was fulfilled, and automobile production at the Canadian plant until the end of the 1964 model year. The Avanti model name, tooling, and plant space were sold off to Leo Newman and Nate Altman, a longtime South Bend Studebaker-Packard dealership. They revived the car in 1965 under the brand name &quot;Avanti II&quot;. (See &quot;main article&quot; Avanti (car).) They likewise purchased the rights and tooling for Studebaker&#x27;s trucks, along with the company&#x27;s vast stock of parts and accessories. The plant, alongside Studebaker&#x27;s General Products Division, was bought by Kaiser Jeep Corporation who used it to produce military vehicles. That unit formed the nucleus for what would later become AM General Corporation, which today is the world’s largest producer of tactical wheeled vehicles. Nevertheless, as Newman and Altman decided not to progress with any Studebaker truck production, the tooling was then sold off again to Kaiser Jeep in late 1965, which continued producing parts for Studebaker trucks for a few more years. Some &#x27;1965&#x27; model Champ trucks were built in South America using completely knocked-down kits and left-over parts. These models used a different grille from all previous Champ models.

The closure of the South Bend plant hit the community particularly hard, since Studebaker was the largest employer in St. Joseph County, Indiana. Nearly a quarter of the South Bend work force was African-American.

==== Closure of Hamilton plant, 1966 ====
Limited automotive production was consolidated at the company&#x27;s last remaining production facility in Hamilton, Ontario, which had always been profitable and where Studebaker produced cars until March 1966 under the leadership of Gordon Grundy. It was projected that the Canadian operation could break even on production of about 20,000 cars a year, and Studebaker&#x27;s announced goal was 30,000–40,000 1965 models. While 1965 production was just shy of the 20,000 figure, the company&#x27;s directors felt that the small profits were not enough to justify continued investment. Rejecting Grundy&#x27;s request for funds to tool up for 1967 models, Studebaker left the automobile business on March 17, 1966, after an announcement on March 4. A turquoise and white Cruiser sedan was the last of fewer than 9,000 1966 models manufactured (of which 2,045 were built in the 1966 calendar year). In reality, the move to Canada had been a tactic by which production could be slowly wound down and remaining dealer franchise obligations honored. The 1965 and 1966 Studebaker cars used &quot;McKinnon&quot; engines sourced from General Motors Canada Limited, which were based on Chevrolet&#x27;s 230-cubic-inch six-cylinder and 283 cubic-inch V8 engines when Studebaker-built engines were no longer available.

The closure adversely affected not only the plant&#x27;s 700 employees, who had developed a sense of collegiality around group benefits such as employee parties and day trips, but the city of Hamilton as a whole; Studebaker had been Hamilton&#x27;s 10th-largest employer.

==== Potential link with Nissan and Toyota ====
In 1965, Gordon Grundy of Studebaker Canada was sent by Studebaker management to Japan to investigate potential links with Nissan and Toyota, to sell their vehicles badged as Studebakers. While Grundy was negotiating with Nissan to possibly import the Nissan Cedric, the Studebaker board found out about the Toyota Century, which was not introduced until February 1968, and then the attorney representing the board, former United States Vice President Richard Nixon, asked Grundy to contact Toyota, as well. Toyota was insulted at being Studebaker&#x27;s second choice, and when word got out to Nissan that Grundy was also speaking with Toyota executives, Nissan ended negotiations, leaving Grundy empty-handed.

==== Network and other assets ====
Many of Studebaker&#x27;s dealers either closed, took on other automakers&#x27; product lines, or converted to Mercedes-Benz dealerships following the closure of the Canadian plant. Studebaker&#x27;s General Products Division, which built vehicles to fulfill defense contracts, was acquired by Kaiser Industries, which built military and postal vehicles in South Bend. In 1970, American Motors (AMC) purchased the division, which still exists today as AM General.

The grove of 5,000 trees planted on the proving grounds in 1937, spelling out the Studebaker name, still stands and has proven to be a popular topic on such satellite photography sites as Google Earth. The proving grounds were acquired by Bendix in 1966 and Bosch in 1996. After Bosch closed its South Bend operation in 2011, a part of the proving ground was retained and, , has been restored to use under the name &quot;New Carlisle Test Facility&quot;.

For many years a rumor persisted of the existence of a Studebaker graveyard. The rumor was later confirmed to be true when the remains of many prototype automobiles and a few trucks were discovered at a remote, heavily wooded site bounded by the proving grounds&#x27; high-speed oval. Most of the prototypes were left to rot in direct contact with the ground and full exposure to the weather and falling trees. Attempts to remove some of these rusting bodies resulted in the bodies crumbling under their own weight as they were moved, so now they exist only in photographs.

However, there were a few notable exceptions. A few of the prototypes were rescued. The only example of a never-produced 1947 Champion wood-sided station wagon was restored and is on display at the Studebaker National Museum.

Another prototype initially slated for disposal at the proving grounds escaped the fate of the others. In late 1952 Studebaker produced one 1953 Commander convertible as an engineering study to determine if the model could be profitably mass-produced. The car was based on the 1953 2-door hardtop coupe. The car was later modified to 1954-model specifications, and was occasionally driven around South Bend by engineers. Additional structural reinforcements were needed to reduce body flexure. Even though the car was equipped with the 232 cu. in. V-8, the added structural weight increased the car&#x27;s 0-60 mph acceleration time to an unacceptable level. In addition, the company did not have the financial resources to add another body type to the model line. The company&#x27;s leadership mistakenly thought the 2-door sedans, 4-door sedans, and 1954 Conestoga wagon would sell better than the 2-door coupes, so the company&#x27;s resources were focused on production of the sedans and the wagon. When the prototype convertible was no longer needed, engineer E. T. Reynolds ordered the car to be stripped and the body sent to the secret graveyard at the proving grounds. A non-engineering employee requested permission to purchase the complete car, rather than see it rot away with the other prototypes. Chief engineer Gene Hardig discussed the request with E. T. Reynolds. They agreed to let the employee purchase the car on the condition that the employee never sell it. In the 1970s, the car was re-discovered behind a South Bend gas station and no longer owned by the former employee. After eventually passing through several owners, the car is now in a private collection of Studebaker automobiles.

In May 1967, Studebaker and its diversified units were merged with Wagner Electric. In November 1967, Studebaker was merged with the Worthington Corporation to form Studebaker-Worthington. The Studebaker name disappeared from the American business scene in 1979, when McGraw-Edison acquired Studebaker-Worthington, except for the still existing Studebaker Leasing, based in Jericho, NY. McGraw-Edison was itself purchased in 1985 by Cooper Industries, which sold off its auto-parts divisions to Federal-Mogul some years later. As detailed above, some vehicles were assembled from left-over parts and identified as Studebakers by the purchasers of the Avanti brand and surplus material from Studebaker at South Bend.

=== Diversified activities ===
By the early 1960s, Studebaker had begun to diversify away from automobiles. Numerous companies were purchased, bringing Studebaker into such diverse fields as the manufacture of tire studs and missile components.

The company&#x27;s 1963 annual report listed the following divisions:

* Clarke – Floor Machine Division, Muskegon, Michigan
* CTL – Missile/Space Technology Division, Cincinnati, Ohio
* Franklin – Appliance Division, Minneapolis, Minnesota (home office; other locations also in Minnesota, Iowa, and Ontario). Manufactured private label kitchen and laundry appliances for major retailers until it was sold to White Consolidated Industries.
* Gravely Tractor – Tractors Division, Dunbar, West Virginia, and Albany, Georgia
* International – South Bend, Indiana (handled business matters for all divisions doing business overseas)
* Onan – Engine/Generator Division, Minneapolis, Minnesota
* Paxton Automotive – automobile superchargers
* STP – Chemical Compounds Division, Des Plaines, Illinois, and Santa Monica, California. Produced automotive engine additives.
* Schaefer – Commercial Refrigeration Division, Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Aberdeen, Maryland
* Studebaker of Canada – Automotive Manufacturing, Hamilton, Ontario
* SASCO – Studebaker Automotive Sales Corp., South Bend, Indiana.
* Studegrip – Tire Stud Division, South Bend, Indiana, Jefferson, Iowa, and Minneapolis, Minnesota
* Trans International Airlines – founded by Kirk Kerkorian

Having built the Wright R-1820 under license during World War II, Studebaker also attempted to build what would perhaps have been the largest aircraft piston engine ever built. With 24 cylinders in an &quot;H&quot; configuration, a bore of and stroke of , displacement would have been , hence the H-9350 designation. It was not completed.

== Attempts at revival ==

=== Studebaker XUV (2003) ===
In 2003, Avanti Motor Company revealed the Studebaker XUV concept at the Chicago Auto Show. The company was able to use the Studebaker name since it had also purchased the rights to Studebaker Trucks alongside the Avanti tooling back in 1963. The large SUV was built on the chassis of a Ford Super-Duty and was powered by a 310-horsepower Ford V10 engine. Due to its close resemblance to the Hummer H2, General Motors filed a lawsuit against Avanti, claiming the XUV was a blatant copy of the H2. A revised design was shown at the 2004 Chicago Auto Show, although did not make production due to Avanti CEO Michael Kelly&#x27;s arrest in 2006 and subsequent imprisonment.

=== Ric Reed ownership (2012-) ===
In 2001, the rights to the Studebaker name were acquired by Colorado based clothing shop owner Ric Reed, who revealed his plans for the company in 2011. Firstly planned to be used on a retro-modern pickup truck reminiscent of the Champ, Reed later intended to use the brand name on a range of Chinese-made petrol and electric scooters, before progressing onto producing hybrid cars using the Lark, Hawk and president model names. Reportedly, the cars were to use a Hydristor, a hydraulic transistor device originally invented by Tom Kasmer for use in a DeLorean sports car. Despite intentions of restarting production in the United States, the proposal did not come to fruition.

635 S. Lafayette Blvd., South Bend, IN
*manufactured conestoga wagons, horse-drawn carriages, electric cars, automobiles

Clement and Henry Studebaker Jr., became blacksmiths and foundrymen in South Bend, Indiana, in February 1852. They first made metal parts for freight wagons and later expanded into the manufacture of complete wagons. At this time, John M. was making wheelbarrows in Placerville, California. The site of his business is California Historic Landmark #142 at 543 Main St, Placerville.

The first major expansion in Henry and Clem&#x27;s South Bend business came from their being in the right place to meet the needs of the California Gold Rush that began in 1849. From his wheelbarrow enterprise at Placerville, John M. had amassed $8,000 ($ in dollars). In April 1858, he quit and moved out to apply this to financing the vehicle manufacturing of H &amp; C Studebaker, which was already booming because of an order to build wagons for the US Army. In 1857, they had also built their first carriage—&quot;Fancy, hand-worked iron trim, the kind of courting buggy any boy and girl would be proud to be seen in&quot;.

That was when John M. bought out Henry&#x27;s share of the business. Henry was deeply religious and had qualms about building military equipment. The Studebakers were Dunkard Brethren, conservative German Baptists, a religion that viewed war as evil. Longstreet&#x27;s official company history simply says, &quot;Henry was tired of the business. He wanted to farm. The risks of expanding were not for him&quot;. Expansion continued from manufacture of wagons for westward migration, as well as for farming and general transportation. During the height of westward migration and wagon train pioneering, half of the wagons used were Studebakers. They made about a quarter of them, and manufactured the metal fittings for other builders in Missouri for another quarter-century.

The fourth brother, Peter E, was running a successful general store in Goshen, Indiana, which was expanded in 1860 to include a wagon distribution outlet. A major leap forward came from supplying wagons for the Union Army in the Civil War (1861–1865). By 1868, annual sales had reached $350,000 ($ in dollars ). That year, the three older brothers formed the Studebaker Brothers Manufacturing Company—Clem (president), Peter (secretary), and John M. (treasurer). By this time, the factory had a spur line to the Lake Shore railroad and, with the Union Pacific Railroad finished, most wagons were now dispatched by rail and steamship.

===== World&#x27;s largest vehicle house =====
In 1875, the youngest brother, 30-year-old Jacob, was brought into the company to take charge of the carriage factory, making sulkies and five-glass landaus. Following a great fire in 1874, which destroyed two-thirds of the entire works, they had rebuilt in solid brick, covering and were now &quot;The largest vehicle house in the world&quot;. Customers could choose from Studebaker sulkies, broughams, clarences, phaetons, runabouts, victorias, and tandems. For $20,000, a four-in-hand for up to a dozen passengers, with red wheels, gold-plated lamps, and yellow trim, could be had.

In the 1880s, roads started to be surfaced with tar, gravel, and wooden blocks. In 1884, when times were hard, Jacob opened a carriage sales and service operation in a fine new Studebaker Building on Michigan Avenue, Chicago. The two granite columns at the main entrance, in diameter and high, were said to be the largest polished monolithic shafts in the country. Three years later, Jacob died, the first death among the brothers.

In 1889, incoming President Harrison ordered a full set of Studebaker carriages and harnesses for the White House. As the 20th century approached, the South Bend plant &quot;covered nearly with 20 big boilers, 16 dynamos, 16 large stationary engines, 1000 pulleys, 600 wood- and iron-working machines, of belting, dozens of steam pumps, and 500 arc and incandescent lamps making white light over all&quot;. The worldwide economic depression of 1893 caused a dramatic pause in sales and the plant closed down for five weeks, but industrial relations were good and the organized workforce declared faith in their employer. Studebaker would end the nineteenth century as the largest buggy and wagon works in the world, and by 1900, with around 3,000 workers, the plant in South Bend was producing over 100,000 horse-drawn vehicles of all types yearly.

The wagons pulled by the Budweiser Clydesdales are Studebaker wagons modified to carry beer, originally manufactured &quot;circa&quot; 1900.

=== Family association continues ===
The five brothers died between 1887 and 1917 (John Mohler was the last to die). Their sons and sons-in-law remained active in the management, most notably lawyer Fred Fish after his marriage to John M&#x27;s daughter Grace in 1891. &quot;Col. George M Studebaker, Clement Studebaker Jr, J M Studebaker Jr, and [Fred Sr&#x27;s son] Frederick Studebaker Fish served apprenticeships in different departments and rose to important official positions, with membership on the board.&quot; Erskine adds sons-in-law Nelson J Riley, Charles A Carlisle, H D Johnson, and William R Innis.

==== Chippewa Factory ====
701 W Chippewa Ave, South Bend, IN

Due to the war effort, and the capacity of the Downtown Facility was dedicated to Studebaker US6 truck and M29 Weasel production, the Chippewa Factory was built south of the city to initially manufacture Wright R-2600 Twin Cyclone aircraft engines to be installed in the North American B-25 Mitchell. Construction began January 1941 and completed in June 1942. Due to logistics challenges, the initial order was cancelled, and Studebaker was asked to build Wright R-1820 Cyclone aircraft engines instead. Retooling of the factory commenced and by January 1944 was the exclusive location of the Wright R-1820 installed in the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress.

After the war ended, the factory was idled until the Korean War began, and the M35 series 2½-ton 6×6 cargo truck resumed in 1950, and the M54 5-ton 6x6 truck was also manufactured at this location. Ownership of the factory changed hands a few times, but the M35 and M54 stayed in production until they were replaced by the FMTV in 1989.

=== Chicago, Illinois ===
5555 S. Archer Ave, Chicago, IL

During World War II, the plant produced aircraft engines for the B-17 Flying Fortress starting in January 1944 until the August 9, 1945, announcement for the building sale. Studebaker built 63,789 engines at the plant and each had nearly 8,000 finished parts. The aircraft were equipped with engines known as the Studebaker-built R-1820. The plant&#x27;s main building, just west of Midway Airport, contained 782,988 square feet and sat on a 50-acre site. Although, engine items were fabricated and produced in the Chicago plant, they were sent to South Bend, Indiana for final assembly. The plant was acquired by Western Electric to produce telephones that were already in backlog orders because of their war efforts.

==== E-M-F and Flanders ====
Studebaker&#x27;s agreement with the E-M-F Company, made in September 1908, was a different relationship, one John Studebaker had hoped would give Studebaker a quality product without the entanglements found in the Garford relationship, but this was not to be. Under the terms of the agreement, E-M-F would manufacture vehicles and Studebaker would distribute them exclusively through its wagon dealers.

The E-M-F gasoline-powered cars proved disastrously unreliable, causing wags to say that E-M-F stood for &quot;Every Morning Fix-it&quot;, &quot;Easy Mark&#x27;s Favorite&quot;, and the like. Compounding the problems was the infighting between E-M-F&#x27;s principal partners, Everitt, Flanders, and Metzger. Eventually in mid-1909, Everitt and Metzger left to start a new enterprise. Flanders also quit and joined them in 1912, but the Metzger Motor Car Co could not be saved from failure by renaming it the Flanders Automobile Company.

Studebaker&#x27;s president, Fred Fish, had purchased one-third of the E-M-F stock in 1908 and followed up by acquiring all the remainder from J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. in 1910 and buying E-M-F&#x27;s manufacturing plants at Walkerville, Ontario, Canada, and across the river in Detroit. The former Ford Piquette Avenue Plant, located across Brush Street from the old E-M-F plant in the Milwaukee Junction area of Detroit, was purchased from Ford in January 1911 to become Studebaker Plant 10, used for assembly work until 1933.

E-M-F was bought out by Studebaker, which formed Studebaker Canada. This was followed by rebadging E-M-F&#x27;s products: the E-M-F as the Studebaker 30, the Flanders as the Studebaker 20 Sales of these rebadged models continued through the end of 1912.

==== Garford ====
Under the agreement with Studebaker, Garford would receive completed chassis and drivetrains from Ohio and then mate them with Studebaker-built bodies, which were sold under the Studebaker-Garford brand name at premium prices. Prices listed for the Model G were $3,700 to $5,000 based on the body style used, equal to ($ in dollars) to ($ in dollars ). Eventually, vehicles with Garford-built engines began to carry the Studebaker name. Garford also built cars under its own name, and by 1907, attempted to increase production at the expense of Studebaker. Once the Studebakers discovered this, John Mohler Studebaker enforced a primacy clause, forcing Garford back on to the scheduled production quotas. The decision to drop the Garford name was made and the final product rolled off the assembly line by 1911, leaving Garford alone until it was acquired by John North Willys in 1913.

=== Vernon, California ===

4530 Loma Vista Ave, Vernon, CA
*Manufactured automobiles

In 1938, the company built an assembly location at 4530 Loma Vista Avenue in Vernon, California, which remained in production until 1956. At one time, the facility was averaging 65 cars a day assembled from knock-down kits shipped by rail from the factory in South Bend, Indiana. The factory manufactured the Champion, the Land Cruiser, and the Starlight. During the war, the factory was in close proximity to Douglas Aircraft and Lockheed Aircraft and built engine assemblies and nacelles for B-17s and PV-2 Harpoons.

=== Hamilton, Ontario, Canada ===
391 Victoria Ave N, Hamilton, ON L8L 5G7
*Manufactured automobiles

On August 18, 1948, surrounded by more than 400 employees and a battery of reporters, the first vehicle, a blue Champion four-door sedan, rolled off of the Studebaker assembly line in Hamilton, Ontario. The company was located in the former Otis-Fenson military weapons factory off Burlington Street on Victoria Avenue North, which was built in 1941. Having previously operated its British Empire export assembly plant at Walkerville, Ontario, Studebaker settled on Hamilton as a postwar Canadian manufacturing site because of the city&#x27;s proximity to the Canadian steel industry.

Studebaker manufactured cars in Hamilton from 1948 to 1966. After the South Bend plant shut, Hamilton was Studebaker&#x27;s sole factory. Studebaker briefly manufactured cars in Windsor, Ontario, from 1912 to 1936.

=== Melbourne, Victoria, Australia ===
Studebakers were assembled in Melbourne in right-hand drive configuration from CKD kits manufactured at Hamilton, Ontario, Canada beginning in 1960. The first location was the Canada Cycle and Car Company in the neighborhood of Tottenham, which assembled Studebaker Lark sedans and station wagons, the Studebaker Champ pickup truck and the Studebaker Silver Hawk. In 1964, after the South Bend, Indiana factory closed, Australian assembly was handed off to Continental &amp; General&#x27;s factory in West Heidelberg until 1968 when the last car was built. When the factory ceased operations Renault products were brought in to replace them. Previously, Studebakers were exported to Australia fully assembled beginning in 1948 in limited numbers.

Studebaker had a long history of selling products in Australia, starting in the 1880s when horse-drawn wagons and carts were imported from the South Bend, Indiana factory, and as the company transitioned to automobiles, they were also brought in.

== Legacy ==
While Studebaker closed fully its automotive sector in 1969, the company still left a big legacy behind it among classic car enthusiasts. The Studebaker US6 truck was the basis for the legendary GAZ-51 Soviet truck that was produced in the Soviet Union until 1975, nearly a decade after Studebaker had closed, and proceeded to form the basis for all GAZ trucks later, such as the GAZ-53, GAZ-3307 and 3309 and the GAZon Next.

The designers of the 1993 Dodge Ram stated that the Studebaker E series pickup was their main inspiration for the design.

Spectra Merchandising International, Inc. produces a number of &quot;retro&quot; styled audio equipment under the brand name &quot;Studebaker.&quot;

<text>Greensboro College is a private college in Greensboro, North Carolina. It is affiliated with the United Methodist Church and was founded in 1838 by Rev. Peter Doub. The college enrolls students from 32 states, the District of Columbia, and 29 countries.

==History==

The first college to open its doors within the town of Greensboro was the woman&#x27;s college, &quot;Greensboro Female College&quot;. The school occupied a campus near the heart of the city within what would become the College Hill Historic District. It was organized in 1833 for local children. It was the intent of the Rev. Peter Doub that the institution grow to serve women.

Through the Methodist Church, a charter was secured in 1838, an event which makes the college one of the oldest institutions of higher education for women in the United States. The cornerstone of the first building was laid in 1843, and in 1846 the institution opened its doors to students. Young women came from many southern states to become the first classes of the new president, the Rev. Solomon Lea, and his faculty.

In 1912, the school changed its name for the first time, becoming the &quot;Greensboro College for Women&quot;. The following year, the newly-renamed college granted its first bachelors degrees.

Not long after, in 1919, the school shortened its title to its current moniker, Greensboro College. The college would not become coeducational, however, until 1954. In 1968, Greensboro formed a consortium of local colleges—the Greensboro Tri-College Consortium—with Guilford College and Bennett College. Other later partnerships would be added with Elon College and Salem College.

==Campus==

Located in the College Hill Historic District of Greensboro, North Carolina, the college&#x27;s properties include several buildings of interest. Most are red-brick buildings built in a neoclassical revival or colonial styles. However, the most historic buildings are located around the campus quadrangle.

The oldest building and the administrative center of Greensboro College is the Main Building, housing the offices of the president, senior administrative officers, and important departments. The building also hosts the Brock Historical Museum, which displays artifacts relating to the history of the college as well as its relationship with the United Methodist Church.
The Finch Memorial Chapel was built in 1954 and is the worshiping heart of the college community. It is named after Hannah Brown Finch, an 1885 graduate and wife of Thomas J. Finch, the latter of whom was involved with Thomasville Furniture Industries and politics. Chapel services are held every Thursday.

The J.A. Jones Library is the bibliographic heart of the college community. Named after James Addison Jones, it houses the college&#x27;s library collections. The building is also home to the Levy-Loewenstein Holocaust Collection, the First Citizens Bank Global Communications Center, and the Sternberger Cultural Center, the latter of which includes a 100-seat lecture hall.

The Cowan Humanities Building houses the offices of the Art and English/Communications departments, as well as a large lecture hall and several art galleries, including the Anne Rudd Gaylon Gallery, the Irene Cullis Gallery, and the LIFT Gallery. The building is also home to Middle College.

The Odell Memorial Building houses the offices of the performing arts departments, such as Theater and Music, and the 787-seat Huggins Performance Center. The building was built in 1922, but renovated in 1997 after a substantial donation from business leader Kenneth Lenon Huggins. The performance center is named after Huggins&#x27; wife, Gail.

Proctor Hall houses the offices of most academic departments while also containing classrooms and seminar rooms of various sizes. It consists of two buildings, an east and a west building. Proctor Hall – East houses science laboratories and the offices of the Biology, Chemistry, Business, and Accounting Departments. Proctor Hall – West is where offices of other departments, such as the humanities and social sciences, are located. The Hall, first built in 1950, was named after Fred and Myrtle Proctor. The Proctors donated the funds necessary to renovate and update the halls in 1998.

==Academics==

Academic programs are organized across five different schools, the School of Arts, the School of Business, the School of Humanities, the School of Science and Mathematics, and the School of Social Sciences and Education. Greensboro College offers four undergraduate degrees – Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Business Administration, Bachelor of Music, and Bachelor of Science – across 42 undergraduate majors and 26 minors. The academic calendar consists of two semesters and a summer-school session. Full-time undergraduates must carry a minimum academic load of 12 credit hours per semester.

Additionally, the college offers five Master of Arts degrees, four in education and one in theology, ethics, and culture.

===Honors program and academic honor societies===

The George Center for Honors Studies welcomes accepted students whose high school GPA is at least 3.65 and whose SAT score is at least 1240 or ACT Composite score is at least 26. They are interviewed prior to being determined for suitability for the program. Honors students must complete a thesis to graduate. The student committee of the program also organizes extracurricular activities and outings for Honors students. The Honors Program is housed in the Honors House, just north of the Cowan Humanities Building.

Greensboro College also has local chapters of the following national honor societies:
* Alpha Chi, a national honor society recognizing superior academic achievement
* Alpha Kappa Delta, national sociology honor society
* Beta Beta Beta, national biology honor society
* Delta Mu Delta, international business honor society
* Kappa Delta Pi, international education honor society
* Phi Alpha Theta, national history honor society

==Athletics==

The Pride&#x27;s athletic program competes in the NCAA&#x27;s Division III and the USA South Athletic Conference. It offers 19 intercollegiate sports. Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, football, golf, lacrosse, soccer, swimming, wrestling and tennis. Women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, triathlon, and volleyball.

The men&#x27;s golf team has twice won the Division III national championship, in 2000 and 2011. The women&#x27;s basketball team won the USA South Conference championship, earning an NCAA Division III tournament bid in 2023. 

The men&#x27;s soccer team was NCAA Division III runner-up in 1989 when they lost 2–0 to Elizabethtown College. In 1998, the men&#x27;s soccer team lost in double overtime to Ohio Wesleyan in the NCAA Division III championship game. Women&#x27;s soccer saw one of their own players, Mercedes Bauzá, chosen to play for the Puerto Rico women&#x27;s national football team in 2018.

As of the beginning of the 2011–2012 school year, 77 Pride student-athletes had been named All-Americans and 26 had been named Academic All-Americans.

==Middle College==
Greensboro College Middle College (GMC) is a high school program on the campus of Greensboro College located in Greensboro, North Carolina. It schools the 11th and 12th grades, and allows students to finish their high school career while earning college credit.

<doc id="184194" wikidata="Q173417" url="?curid=184194" title="Joseph Pulitzer">
<text>Joseph Pulitzer ( ; born Pulitzer József, ; April 10, 1847 – October 29, 1911) was a Hungarian-American politician and newspaper publisher of the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; and the &quot;New York World&quot;. He became a leading national figure in the Democratic Party and was served one term representing New York&#x27;s 9th congressional district.

In the 1890s, the fierce competition between his &quot;World&quot; and William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s &quot;New York Journal&quot; caused both to develop the techniques of yellow journalism, which won over readers with sensationalism, sex, crime, and graphic horrors. The wide appeal reached a million copies a day and opened the way to mass-circulation newspapers that depended on advertising revenue, rather than cover price or political party subsidies. Such newspapers appealed to readers with multiple forms of news, gossip, entertainment, and advertising.

Pulitzer&#x27;s name is best known for the Pulitzer Prizes established in 1917 as a result of the specified endowment in his will to Columbia University. The prizes are given annually to recognize and reward excellence in American journalism, photography, literature, history, poetry, music, and drama. Pulitzer also funded the Columbia School of Journalism with his philanthropic bequest; it opened in 1912.

== Early life ==
He was born as Pulitzer József (name order by Hungarian custom) in Makó, about 200 km southeast of Budapest, the son of Elize (Berger) and Fülöp Pulitzer (born Politzer). The Pulitzers were among several Jewish families living in the area and had established a reputation as merchants and shopkeepers. Joseph&#x27;s father was a respected businessman, regarded as the second of the &quot;foremost merchants&quot; of Makó. Their ancestors emigrated from Police () in Moravia to Hungary at the end of the 18th century.

In 1853, Fülöp Pulitzer was rich enough to retire. He moved his family to Pest, where he had the children educated by private tutors, and taught French and German. In 1858, after Fülöp&#x27;s death, his business went bankrupt, and the family became impoverished. Joseph attempted to enlist in various European armies for work before emigrating to the United States.

=== American Civil War service ===

Pulitzer tried to join the military but was rejected by the Austrian Army. He then tried to join the French Foreign Legion to fight in Mexico but was similarly rejected, and then the British Army and was again rejected. He was finally recruited in Hamburg, Germany, to fight for the Union in the American Civil War in August 1864. Pulitzer could not speak English when he arrived in Boston Harbor in 1864 at the age of 17, his passage having been paid by Massachusetts military recruiters. Learning that the recruiters were pocketing the lion&#x27;s share of his enlistment bounty, Pulitzer left the Deer Island recruiting station and made his way to New York.

He was paid $200 to enlist in the Lincoln Cavalry on September 30, 1864. He was a part of Sheridan&#x27;s troopers, in the 1st New York Cavalry Regiment in Company L, joining the regiment in Virginia in November 1864, and fighting in the Appomattox Campaign, before being mustered out on June 5, 1865. Although he spoke German, Hungarian, and French, Pulitzer learned little English until after the war, as his regiment was composed mostly of German immigrants.

== Early career in St. Louis ==
After the war, Pulitzer returned to New York City, where he stayed briefly. He moved to New Bedford, Massachusetts, for the whaling industry, but found it was too boring for him. He returned to New York with little money. Flat broke, he slept in wagons on cobblestone side streets. He decided to travel by &quot;side-door Pullman&quot; (a freight boxcar) to St. Louis, Missouri. He sold his one possession, a white handkerchief, for 75 cents.

When Pulitzer arrived at the city, he recalled, &quot;The lights of St. Louis looked like a promised land to me.&quot; In the city, his German was as useful as it was in Munich because of the large ethnic German population, due to strong immigration since the revolutions of 1848. In the &quot;Westliche Post&quot;, he saw an ad for a mule hostler at Benton Barracks. The next day he walked four miles and got the job, but held it for only two days. He quit due to the poor food and the whims of the mules, stating &quot;The man who has not cared for sixteen mules does not know what work and troubles are.&quot; Pulitzer had difficulty holding jobs; he was too scrawny for heavy labor and likely too proud and temperamental to take orders.

He worked as a waiter at &quot;Tony Faust,&quot; a famous restaurant on Fifth Street. It was frequented by members of the St. Louis Philosophical Society, including Thomas Davidson, the German Henry C. Brockmeyer; and William Torrey Harris. Pulitzer studied Brockmeyer, who was famous for translating Hegel, and he &quot;would hang on Brockmeyer&#x27;s thunderous words, even as he served them pretzels and beer.&quot; He was fired after a tray slipped from his hand and a patron was soaked in beer.

Pulitzer spent his free time at the St. Louis Mercantile Library on the corner of Fifth and Locust, studying English and reading voraciously. He made a lifelong friend there in the librarian Udo Brachvogel. He often played in the library&#x27;s chess room, where Carl Schurz noticed his aggressive style. Pulitzer greatly admired the German-born Schurz, an emblem of the success attainable by a foreign-born citizen through his own energies and skills. In 1868, Pulitzer was admitted to the bar, but his broken English and odd appearance kept clients away. He struggled with the execution of minor papers and the collecting of debts. That year, when the &quot;Westliche Post&quot; needed a reporter, he was offered the job.

Soon after, he and several dozen men each paid a fast-talking promoter five dollars, after being promised good-paying jobs on a Louisiana sugar plantation. They boarded a steamboat, which took them downriver 30 miles south of the city, where the crew forced them off. When the boat churned away, the men concluded the promised plantation jobs had been a ruse. They walked back to the city, where Pulitzer wrote an account of the fraud and was pleased when it was accepted by the &quot;Westliche Post&quot;, edited by Emil Preetorius and Carl Schurz, evidently his first published news story.

On March 6, 1867, Pulitzer became a naturalized American citizen.

== Entry to journalism and politics ==
In the &quot;Westliche Post&quot; building, Pulitzer made the acquaintance of attorneys William Patrick and Charles Phillip Johnson and surgeon Joseph Nash McDowell. Patrick and Johnson referred to Pulitzer as &quot;Shakespeare&quot; because of his extraordinary profile. They helped him secure a job with the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. His work was to record the railroad land deeds in the twelve counties in southwest Missouri where the railroad planned to build a line. When he was done, the lawyers gave him desk space and allowed him to study law in their library to prepare for the bar.

Pulitzer displayed a flair for reporting. He would work 16 hours a dayfrom 10 am to 2 am. He was nicknamed &quot;Joey the German&quot; or &quot;Joey the Jew&quot;. He joined the Philosophical Society and frequented a German bookstore where many intellectuals hung out. Among his new group of friends were Joseph Keppler and Thomas Davidson.

=== Missouri State Representative ===
Pulitzer joined Schurz&#x27;s Republican Party. On December 14, 1869, Pulitzer attended the Republican meeting at the St. Louis Turnhalle on Tenth Street, where party leaders needed a candidate to fill a vacancy in the state legislature. After their first choice refused, they settled on Pulitzer, nominating him unanimously, forgetting he was only 22, three years under the required age. However, his chief Democratic opponent was possibly ineligible because he had served in the Confederate army. Pulitzer had energy. He organized street meetings, called personally on the voters, and exhibited such sincerity along with his oddities that he had pumped a half-amused excitement into a campaign that was normally lethargic. He won 209–147.

His age was not made an issue and he was seated as a state representative in Jefferson City at the session beginning January 5, 1870. During his time in Jefferson City, Pulitzer voted in favor of the adoption of the Fifteenth Amendment and led a crusade to reform the corrupt St. Louis County Court.

His fight against the court angered Captain Edward Augustine, Superintendent of Registration for St. Louis County. Their rivalry became so heated that on the night of January 27, Augustine confronted Pulitzer at Schmidt&#x27;s Hotel and called him a &quot;damned liar.&quot; Pulitzer left the building, returned to his room, and retrieved a four-barreled pistol. He returned to the parlor and approached Augustine, renewing the argument. When Augustine advanced on Pulitzer, the young Representative aimed his pistol at the Captain&#x27;s midriff. Augustine tackled Pulitzer, and the gun fired two shots, tearing through Augustine&#x27;s knee and the hotel floor. Pulitzer suffered a head wound. Contemporary accounts conflict on whether Augustine was also armed.

While in Jefferson City, Pulitzer also moved up one notch in the administration at the &quot;Westliche Post&quot;. He eventually became its managing editor, and obtained a proprietary interest.

=== Break from the Republican Party and Schurz ===

On August 31, 1870, Schurz (now a U.S. Senator), Pulitzer, and other reformist anti-Grant Republicans bolted from the state convention at the Capitol and nominated a competing Liberal Republican ticket for Missouri, led by the former Senator Benjamin Gratz Brown. Brown was successful in the November election over the mainline Republican ticket, presenting a serious threat to President Grant&#x27;s re-election chances. On January 19, 1872, Brown appointed Pulitzer to the St. Louis Board of Police Commissioners.

In May 1872, Pulitzer was a delegate to the Cincinnati convention of the Liberal Republican Party, which nominated &quot;New York Tribune&quot; editor Horace Greeley for the presidency with Gratz Brown as his running mate. Pulitzer and Schurz were expected to boost Governor Brown for the presidential nomination, but Schurz preferred the more idealistic Charles Francis Adams Sr. A loyal Brown man alerted the Governor of this betrayal, and Governor Brown and his cousin Francis Preston Blair sped to Cincinnati to rally their supporters to Greeley.

While in Cincinnati, he met fellow reformist newspapermen Samuel Bowles, Murat Halstead, Horace White, and Alexander McClure. He also met Greeley&#x27;s assistant and campaign manager Whitelaw Reid, who would become Pulitzer&#x27;s journalistic adversary. However, Greeley&#x27;s campaign was ultimately a disaster, and the new party collapsed, leaving Schurz and Pulitzer politically homeless.

In 1874, Pulitzer promoted a reform movement christened the People&#x27;s Party, which united the Grange with dissident Republicans. However, Pulitzer was disappointed with the party&#x27;s tepid stances on the issues and mediocre ticket, led by gentleman farmer William Gentry. He returned to St. Louis and endorsed the Democratic ticket. Pulitzer&#x27;s own views were in line with Democratic orthodoxy on low tariffs, and limited federal powers; his prior opposition to the Democrats was out of disgust for slavery and the Confederate rebellion. Pulitzer campaigned for the Democratic ticket throughout the state and published a damaging rumor (leaked by future Senator George Vest) that Gentry had sold a slave.

He also served as a delegate to the 1874 Missouri Constitutional Convention representing St. Louis, arguing successfully for true home rule for the city.

In 1876, Pulitzer, by now completely disillusioned with the corruption of the Republicans and their nomination of Rutherford B. Hayes, gave nearly 70 speeches in favor of Democratic candidate Samuel J. Tilden throughout the country; Schurz, who saw Hayes as a reformer with integrity, returned to the Republican fold. In his speeches, Pulitzer denounced Schurz and urged reconciliation between North and South. While on his speaking tour, Pulitzer also wrote dispatches to the &quot;New York Sun&quot; on behalf of the Samuel Tilden 1876 presidential campaign. After Tilden&#x27;s narrow defeat under dubious circumstances, Pulitzer became disillusioned with his candidate&#x27;s indecision and timid response; he would oppose Tilden&#x27;s 1880 run for the Democratic nomination. Pulitzer returned to St. Louis to practice law and search for future opportunities in news.

== &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; ==
On his thirtieth birthday, Pulitzer&#x27;s home at the old Southern Hotel burned to the ground, likely destroying most of his personal belongings and papers.

On December 9, 1878, Pulitzer bought the moribund &quot;St. Louis Dispatch&quot; and merged it with John Dillon&#x27;s &quot;St. Louis Post&quot;, forming the &quot;St. Louis Post and Dispatch&quot; (soon renamed the &quot;Post-Dispatch&quot;) on December 12. With his own paper, Pulitzer developed his role as a champion of the common man, featuring exposés and a hard-hitting populist approach. The paper was considered a leader in the field of sensational journalism.

The circulation of the &quot;Post-Dispatch&quot; steadily rose during Pulitzer&#x27;s early tenure (aided by the collapse of the city&#x27;s other daily English-language paper, the &quot;Star&quot;). At the time of merger, the Post and Dispatch had a combined circulation of under 4,000. By the end of 1879, circulation was up to 4,984 and Pulitzer doubled the size of the paper to eight pages. By the end of 1880, circulation was up to 8,740. Circulation rose dramatically to 12,000 by March 1881 and to 22,300 by September 1882. Pulitzer bought two new presses and increased staff pay to the highest in the city, though he also crushed an attempt to unionize.

=== Political activism ===
Pulitzer&#x27;s primary political rival at this time was Bourbon Democrat William Hyde, publisher of the (misleadingly named) &quot;Missouri Republican&quot;. Pulitzer&#x27;s much smaller paper won a series of early political skirmishes over Hyde. First, George Vest was elected to the Senate in 1879 with Pulitzer&#x27;s backing over Bourbon Samuel Glover. Next, Pulitzer secured election for an anti-Tilden delegation (including himself) to the 1880 Democratic National Convention, over Hyde&#x27;s objection. Though Pulitzer could not convince Horatio Seymour, his preferred candidate, to run, the Democrats did not renominate Tilden. In March 1882, the two men even came to physical blows on Olive Street but were separated by a crowd before either was injured.

In 1880, Pulitzer made a second run for public office, this time for United States Representative from Missouri&#x27;s second district. However, he was resoundingly defeated for the Democratic nomination (tantamount to victory in heavily Democratic St. Louis) by Bourbon Thomas Allen, 4,254 to 709.

=== Killing of Alonzo Slayback ===

When Thomas Allen died during his first term, Pulitzer&#x27;s &quot;Post-Dispatch&quot; strongly opposed the &quot;Republican&quot; endorsed candidate, James Broadhead, an attorney working for the railroad magnate Jay Gould. The election became heated, and &quot;Post-Dispatch&quot; managing editor John Cockerill called Broadhead&#x27;s law partner Alonzo Slayback a &quot;coward.&quot; Slayback entered the &quot;Post-Dispatch&quot; offices on October 13, armed with a gun, and threatened Cockerill; Cockerill shot him dead. The story became a national sensation and turned many conservative Democrats vehemently against Pulitzer and the &quot;Post-Dispatch&quot;. After a grand jury inquest, Cockerill was never put on trial. Pulitzer replaced him with John Dillon, former owner of the &quot;Post&quot; and unlike Pulitzer and Cockerill, a well-respected, conservative native of the city. However, the incident permanently damaged Pulitzer&#x27;s reputation in the city, and he began to seek opportunities elsewhere.

== &quot;New York World&quot; ==

In April 1883, the Pulitzer family traveled to New York, ostensibly to start a European vacation, but actually so that Joseph could make an offer to Jay Gould for ownership of the morning &quot;New York World&quot;. Gould had acquired the newspaper as a throw-in in one of his railroad deals, and it had been losing about $40,000 a year, possibly because of the stigma the unpopular Gould&#x27;s ownership brought. In return for the paper, Gould asked Pulitzer for a sum well over a half-million dollars, as well as the retention of the World&#x27;s staff and building. After some frustration at this demand and disagreement with his brother Albert, Pulitzer was prepared to give up. At the urging of his wife Kate, however, he returned to negotiations with Gould. They agreed to a sale for $346,000 with Pulitzer retaining full freedom in the selection of staff.

The Pulitzers moved to New York full time, leasing a home in Gramercy Park. The World immediately gained 6,000 readers in its first two weeks under Pulitzer and had more than doubled its circulation to 39,000 within three months.

As he had in St. Louis, Pulitzer emphasized sensational stories: human-interest, crime, disasters, and scandal. Under Pulitzer&#x27;s leadership, circulation grew from 15,000 to 600,000, making the &quot;World&quot; the largest newspaper in the country. Pulitzer emphasized broad appeal through short, provocative headlines and sentences; the World&#x27;s self-described style was &quot;brief, breezy and briggity.&quot; His &quot;World&quot; featured illustrations, advertising, and a culture of consumption for working men. Crusades for reform and entertainment news were two main staples for the &quot;World&quot;. Pulitzer explained that: The American people want something terse, forcible, picturesque, striking, something that will arrest their attention, enlist their sympathy, arouse their indignation, stimulate their imagination, convince their reason, [and] awaken their conscience.

In 1887, he recruited the famous investigative journalist Nellie Bly.

Pulitzer also constructed the New York World Building, designed by George B. Post and completed in 1890. Pulitzer dictated several aspects of the design, including the building&#x27;s triple-height main entrance arch, dome, and rounded corner at Park Row and Frankfort Street.

In 1895, the &quot;World&quot; introduced the immensely popular &quot;The Yellow Kid&quot; comic by Richard F. Outcault, one of the first strips to be featured in the newly launched Sunday color supplement shortly after.

After the &quot;World&quot; exposed an illegal payment of $40,000,000 by the United States to the French Panama Canal Company in 1909, Pulitzer was indicted for libeling Theodore Roosevelt and J. P. Morgan. The courts dismissed the indictments.

Newspaper writer and editor of &quot;The San Francisco Call, &quot;John McNaught went to New York to work under Pulitzer as his personal secretary from 1907 to 1912. When McNaught left &quot;The Evening World,&quot; he became editor of the &quot;New York World,&quot; through 1915.

=== Early political activism ===
When Pulitzer purchased the &quot;World&quot;, New York City, though overwhelmingly Democratic, did not have a major Democratic newspaper. The &quot;Tribune&quot; (under Whitelaw Reid) and &quot;Times&quot; were ardently Republican and the &quot;Sun&quot; (under Charles Dana) and &quot;Herald&quot; were independent. In the first issue under his ownership, Pulitzer announced the paper would be &quot;dedicated to the cause of the people rather than that of purse-potentates.&quot;

In 1884, he joined the Manhattan Club, a group of wealthy Democrats including Tilden, Abram Hewitt, and William C. Whitney. Through the &quot;World&quot;, he supported the campaign of New York Governor Grover Cleveland for president. Pulitzer&#x27;s campaign for Cleveland and against Republican James G. Blaine may have been pivotal in securing the presidency for Cleveland, who won New York&#x27;s decisive votes by just 0.1%. The campaign also boosted the &quot;World&quot; circulation dramatically; by Election Day, it averaged about 110,000 copies per day and its Election Day special ran 223,680 copies.

Pulitzer also attacked young Republican Assemblyman Theodore Roosevelt as a &quot;reform fraud,&quot; beginning a long and heated rivalry with the future President.

=== United States House of Representatives ===
In 1884, Pulitzer was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from New York&#x27;s ninth district as a Democrat and entered office on March 4, 1885.

Though inundated with office seekers hoping for appointment by President-elect Cleveland, Pulitzer recommended only the appointments of Charles Gibson for Minister to Berlin and Pallen as consul general in London. But Pulitzer did not secure a meeting with the President-elect, and neither man was appointed.

During his term in office, Pulitzer led a crusade to place the newly gifted Statue of Liberty in New York City. He was a member of the Committee on Commerce.

During his time in Washington, Pulitzer lived at the luxurious hotel run by John Chamberlin at the corner of 15th and I streets, N.W. However, Pulitzer soon determined that his position at the &quot;World&quot; was both more powerful and more enjoyable than Congress. He began to spend less and less time in Washington, and ultimately resigned on April 10, 1886, after little over a year in office.

=== Rivalry with William Randolph Hearst ===
In 1895, William Randolph Hearst purchased the rival &quot;New York Journal&quot;, which at one time had been owned by Pulitzer&#x27;s brother, Albert. Hearst had once been a great admirer of Pulitzer&#x27;s &quot;World&quot;. The two embarked on a circulation war. This competition with Hearst, particularly the coverage before and during the Spanish–American War, linked Pulitzer&#x27;s name with yellow journalism.

Pulitzer and Hearst were also the cause of the newsboys&#x27; strike of 1899, a youth-led campaign to force change in the way that Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s newspapers compensated their child newspaper hawkers.

=== Other rivals ===
Charles A. Dana, the editor of the rival &quot;New York Sun&quot; and personal enemy of Grover Cleveland, became estranged from Pulitzer during the 1884 campaign. Dana&#x27;s &quot;Sun&quot; endorsed Greenback nominee Benjamin Butler, a major blow in swing state New York. He attacked Pulitzer in print, often calling him &quot;Judas Pulitzer.&quot; After Cleveland&#x27;s victory, the &quot;Sun&quot;″s circulation had been halved and the &quot;World&quot; replaced it as the largest Democratic paper in the country.

Leander Richardson, a former employee who left the &quot;World&quot; to run &quot;The Journalist,&quot; was even more directly antisemitic, referring to his former boss only as &quot;Jewseph Pulitzer.&quot;

Whitelaw Reid frequently sparred with Pulitzer, both in person and in their respective papers.

== Declining health and resignation ==
Pulitzer&#x27;s health problems (blindness, depression, and acute noise sensitivity) caused a rapid deterioration, and he had to withdraw from the daily management of the newspaper. He continued to manage the paper from his New York mansion, his winter retreat at the Jekyll Island Club on Jekyll Island, Georgia, and his summer vacation retreat in Bar Harbor, Maine.

After he hired Frank I. Cobb (1869–1923) in 1904 as the editor of the New York &quot;World&quot;, the younger man resisted Pulitzer&#x27;s attempts to &quot;run the office&quot; from his home. Time after time, they battled each other, often with heated language.

When Pulitzer&#x27;s son Ralph took over administrative responsibility in 1907, Pulitzer wrote a carefully worded resignation. It was printed in every New York paper except the &quot;World&quot;. Pulitzer was insulted but slowly began to respect Cobb&#x27;s editorials and independent spirit. Their exchanges, commentaries, and messages increased. The good rapport between the two was based largely on Cobb&#x27;s flexibility. In May 1908, Cobb and Pulitzer met to outline plans for a consistent editorial policy but it wavered on occasion.

Pulitzer&#x27;s demands for editorials on contemporary breaking news led to overwork by Cobb. Pulitzer sent him on a six-week tour of Europe to restore his spirit. Cobb continued the editorial policies he had shared with Pulitzer until Cobb died of cancer in 1923.

In a company meeting, Professor Thomas Davidson said, &quot;I cannot understand why it is, Mr. Pulitzer, that you always speak so kindly of reporters and so severely of all editors.&quot; &quot;Well&quot;, Pulitzer replied, &quot;I suppose it is because every reporter is a hope, and every editor is a disappointment.&quot; This phrase became an epigram of journalism.

== Marriage and family ==
In 1878 at the age of 31, Pulitzer married Katherine &quot;Kate&quot; Davis (1853–1927), a woman of high social standing from Georgetown, District of Columbia. She was five years younger than Pulitzer, from an Episcopal family, and rumored to be a distant relative of Jefferson Davis. They married in an Episcopal ceremony at the Church of the Epiphany in Washington, D.C. He did not reveal his Jewish heritage to Katherine or her family until after their marriage, to her shock.

Of seven children, five lived to adulthood: Ralph, Joseph Jr. (father of Joseph Pulitzer III), Constance Helen (1888–1938), who married William Gray Elmslie, D.D. Edith (1886–1975), who married William Scoville Moore, and Herbert, eventually his brother Ralph&#x27;s partner at the &quot;Post&quot;. Their daughter, Katherine Ethel Pulitzer, died of pneumonia in May 1884 at age 2. On December 31, 1897, their oldest daughter, Lucille Irma Pulitzer, died at the age of 17 from typhoid fever. An Irish immigrant named Mary Boyle largely raised the children while their parents were busy.

Pulitzer&#x27;s grandson Herbert Pulitzer Jr. was married to the American fashion designer and socialite Lilly Pulitzer.

Following a fire at his former residence, Pulitzer commissioned Stanford White to design a limestone-clad Venetian palazzo at 11 East 73rd Street on the Upper East Side; it was completed in 1903. Pulitzer&#x27;s thoughtful seated portrait by John Singer Sargent is at the Columbia School of Journalism that he endowed.

The family continued to be involved in the operation of the &quot;Post-Dispatch&quot; and other newspapers under the Pulitzer Publishing Company until selling them to Lee Enterprises in 2005. The Pulitzer group also comprised television stations, which would ironically be sold to Hearst Communications, owned by the descendants of William Randolph Hearst.

== Death ==
For six months during 1908, Pulitzer was attended to by his personal physician C. Louis Leipoldt aboard his yacht &quot;Liberty&quot;. While traveling to his winter home at the Jekyll Island Club on Jekyll Island, Georgia, in 1911, Pulitzer had his yacht stop in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina. On October 29, 1911, Pulitzer listened to his German secretary read aloud about King Louis XI of France. As the secretary neared the end, Pulitzer said in German: &quot;Leise, ganz leise&quot; (English: &quot;Softly, quite softly&quot;), and died. His body was returned to New York for funerary services and interred in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx.

== Legacy ==

=== Journalism schools ===
In 1892, Pulitzer offered Columbia University&#x27;s president, Seth Low, money to set up the world&#x27;s first school of journalism. The university initially turned down the money. In 1902, Columbia&#x27;s new president Nicholas Murray Butler was more receptive to the plan for a school and journalism prizes, but it would not be until after Pulitzer&#x27;s death that this dream would be fulfilled.

Pulitzer left the university $2,000,000 in his will. In 1912, the school founded the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. This followed the Missouri School of Journalism, founded at the University of Missouri with Pulitzer&#x27;s urging. Both schools remain among the most prestigious in the world.

=== Pulitzer Prize ===
In 1917, Columbia organized the awards of the first Pulitzer Prizes in journalism. The awards have been expanded to recognize achievements in literature, poetry, history, music, and drama.

<doc id="184196" wikidata="Q6189797" url="?curid=184196" title="Jewish Council for Public Affairs">
<text>The Jewish Council for Public Affairs (JCPA) is an American Jewish nonprofit organization that advocates for progressive and liberal policies. Founded in 1944 as the umbrella organization for local Jewish advocacy arms known as community relations councils, for almost 80 years it represented approximately 125 local Jewish federations and community relations councils and was the coordinating body for 15 national Jewish organizations.

In 2022, JCPA split from the Jewish Federations of North America and became independent.

==History==
The JCPA was founded as the National Community Relations Advisory Council in 1944 by the Council of Jewish Federations to represent local Jewish advocacy arms known as community relations councils. In the 1960s, it was renamed the National Jewish Community Relations Advisory Council (NJCRAC). The group adopted the JCPA name in 1997. Arnold Aronson was program director from 1945 to 1976. David L. Bernstein served as president and chief executive officer since January 2016.

The National Community Relations Advisory Council opposed the Rosenberg Committee, believing them to be a Communist group. The council issued a statement that the Rosenberg Committee&#x27;s accusation that the Rosenberg trial was motivated by antisemitism was causing public panic within the Jewish community.

The council, along with the American Jewish Congress, the Anti-Defamation League, the American Jewish Committee, and other Jewish groups and community leaders asked Nelson Mandela to clarify his pro-Palestinian views during his 1990 visit to New York City. During a meeting in Geneva with Jewish-American communal leaders that included the JPCA, Mandela apologized for offending the Jewish-American establishment, expressed appreciation for South African Jews who opposed apartheid, praised certain Israeli leaders, and agreed that the State of Israel had a right to exist. Following Mandela&#x27;s death, Rabbi Steve Gutow, President of the JCPA praised him as &quot;came to embody courage in the face of severe injustice.&quot;

In 2021, the DC chapter of the Sunrise Movement called for the removal of the JCPA, the National Council of Jewish Women, and the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism from a voting rights coalition due to their Israeli ties and support for Zionism. Sunrise DC apologized after Jewish organizations condemned the chapter for antisemitism.

As national Jewish advocacy organizations such as the Jewish Federations of North America and the American Jewish Committee focused more of their political work on supporting work, the JCPA&#x27;s influence within the Jewish establishment waned. After JCPA signed an open letter in the &quot;New York Times&quot; in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, conservative donors within the federation system boiled over.

===Break with Jewish Federations===
In December 2022, the JCPA announced that it would end its role speaking on behalf of 125 Jewish community relations councils, almost all part of local Jewish federations, and 16 national Jewish organizations. As a result, JCPA broke with the Jewish Federations of North America and would lose funding from the dues-paying local federations.

JCPA hoped that changes would enable it to be part of progressive coalitions and strengthen Jewish support for progressive policies. As part of the transition, activist Amy Spitalnick, who led a successful lawsuit against the organizers of the Unite the Right rally, was hired as CEO in May 2023.

==Activities==
The JCPA works on shaping consensus on public issues, developing strategic responses, and working with the media, elected officials, coalition partners, and others through public relations, advocacy, and lobbying. The JCPA also helps the 125 Jewish community relations councils organize events and advocacy around the country, promoting interfaith and community partnerships.

International issues that the JCPA is concerned with include Israel–United States relations, global antisemitism, the United Nations, the well-being of Jews in endangered areas, genocide, and human rights. Domestic issues that the JCPA is concerned with include anti-Semitism, social justice, poverty, education, public health, the environment, immigration, individual rights, and religious liberties including the preservation of the separation of church and state.

It has been active in supporting rights of Israeli Arabs and has fought for equality in Israel.

==Policy==
The JCPA supports a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, stating on their website that their organization supports &quot;Israel as the Jewish homeland and works to deter efforts to undermine the Jewish people’s right to self-determination.&quot; The JCPA&#x27;s Israel Action Center was created in 2010 to combat BDS movement activities in the United States, accusing the movement of &quot;bias against Israel&quot;. David Bohm, the board&#x27;s chair, has said the JCPA has an unclear position on working with progressive anti-Zionist groups, saying that many anti-Zionist sentiments are antisemitic, but the organization might be willing to participate in coalitions with anti-Zionist groups.

==Initiatives==
Shocked by the atrocities in Darfur, the JCPA helped found the Save Darfur Coalition in 2004. It continues to organize the Jewish community in support of continued US action to bring peace to Sudan, supporting the creation of South Sudan and working with the White House and Congress to ensure humanitarian assistance.

In September 2007, the JCPA launched an anti-poverty program &quot;There shall be no needy among you.&quot; The effort seeks to raise awareness and action to combat hunger, homelessness and other vestiges of poverty in America. The JCPA has led multiple Food Stamp Challenges, organizing Members of Congress, clergy, and others to live for one week on the average food stamp allotment of $31.50. Starting in 2008, the JCPA and have sponsored an annual Hunger Seder Mobilization, tying the Passover message of freedom to the ongoing struggles with hunger in America. The mobilization begins each year with a National Hunger Seder in the US Capitol where Members of Congress and national faith and anti-hunger advocates read from a specially prepared haggadah. Hunger Seders have been held in over 30 states across the country.

Along with Catholic Charities USA and the National Council of Churches, the JCPA has been a cosponsor of the annual Fighting Poverty with Faith mobilization since 2008. Fighting Poverty with Faith mobilizes community&#x27;s to hold events aimed at making ending poverty a national priority with a different theme each year. Past themes have included &quot;Good Jobs, Green Jobs,&quot; poverty, hunger, and affordable housing.

The JCPA is also actively involved in environmentalism and climate change issues though its program the Coalition on the Environment and Jewish Life (COEJL), an affiliate of the National Religious Partnership on the Environment.

In partnership with the Jewish Federations of North America, the JCPA created the Israel Action Network in 2010 to help communities counter the delegitimization of Israel. The IAN was created to educate, organize and mobilize the organized North American Jewish community to develop strategic approaches to attacks on Israel and use partnerships to promote peace and security for two states for two peoples.

Other national campaigns of the JCPA have included the Vote On Guns campaign to end gun violence following the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and the 2013 &quot;Immigration Nation&quot; campaign in support of comprehensive immigration reform.

<text>The Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations (CoP; commonly Presidents&#x27; Conference) is the umbrella organization for the American Jewish community. Comprising 53 national Jewish organizations across the political spectrum, it was founded in 1955 to develop a consensus voice among Jewish organizations, especially to the U.S. government.

Along with the Jewish Federations of North America, Hillel International, and the Anti-Defamation League, the CoP is considered to represent mainstream Jewry in the United States. Since the 1970s, the CoP&#x27;s chairperson is the American Jewish community&#x27;s de facto spokesperson on international affairs.

==Mission==
The Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations (CoP) is the American Jewish community&#x27;s unofficial umbrella organization. Its purpose is to provide consensus on issues, generally to the Executive Branch of the United States federal government. As of the 21st century, the Conference represents the American Jewish community not only to the U.S. government, but to Israel and other countries.

Along with the Jewish Federations of North America, Hillel International, the Anti-Defamation League, CoP is considered to represent mainstream Jewry in the United States. The CoP&#x27;s chairperson is the American Jewish community&#x27;s de facto spokesperson on international affairs, especially on matters related to Israel, based on the CoP&#x27;s ability to develop consensus among the largest Jewish organizations and speak on behalf of the majority of affiliated American Jews.

==History==
===Formation===
The Conference of Presidents was formed when Jewish groups felt a need to respond to the perceived tilt of the Eisenhower administration away from Israel. In 1954, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Henry Byroade attempted to intimidate Israel, B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith president Philip Klutznick invited the leaders of 16 American Jewish organizations to meet in New York City as the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. In March 1955, the conference had 20 members and met in Washington, D.C. to discuss the Middle East. The 1955 conference was the first public forum that enabled the American government to hear the opinions of the largest representative body of American Jews after World War II. At the forum, the Conference of Presidents declared its goals as three-fold: 1) the defense of American and the welfare of its people, 2) the spread of freedom and attainment of peace throughout the world, and 3) the attainment of peace, development, and security for the people of Israel in their ancestral homeland.

In the early years, the Conference of Presidents, like other coordinating agencies such as the Council of Jewish Federations, the Jewish Welfare Board, and the Synagogue Council of America, operated mainly as coordinating bodies with no powers of coercion over their constituent members. However, these groups were able to forge unprecedented levels of cooperation largely because there was a strong consensus about the Jewish communal agenda.

===Growth===
By the 1970s, the Conference of Presidents and AIPAC assumed overall responsibility for Israel-related lobbying within the Jewish communal landscape. The Conference of Presidents was responsible for speaking to the Executive Branch of the U.S. government, while AIPAC dealt mainly with the legislative branch.

For its first 30 years, the organization was headed by Yehuda Hellman. After Hellman&#x27;s death in 1986, Malcolm Hoenlein became chairman. Hoenlein took a much stronger role in shaping US policy, especially within the executive branch. By 1990, the group grew to 48 members and 8 official observers. By then, its mission was to &quot;strengthen the US-Israel alliance and protect and enhance the security and dignity of Jews abroad.&quot;

In December 2008, the conference presented Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and his government as a whole, with its inaugural &quot;International Leadership Award&quot; for his support for Israel. Malcolm Hoenlein, the executive vice-chairman of the conference, stated that the award was given to express the group&#x27;s appreciation for Canada&#x27;s &quot;courageous stands&quot; to boycott the Durban II anti-racism conference. He also praised Canada&#x27;s &quot;support for Israel and [its] efforts at the U.N. against incitement and ... the delegitimization [of Israel], where they have taken a role in the forefront.&quot;

On February 12, 2009, a CoP delegation met with Pope Benedict XVI at the Vatican to re-assert the importance of Jewish–Catholic relations in the wake of the controversy over controversial comments by Society of St. Pius X bishop Richard Williamson.

===2020s===
On August 4, 2019, William Daroff was announced as CEO, succeeding Hoenlein after 33 years in the role. Daroff was previously a senior official at the Jewish Federations of North America. The Conference of Presidents co-organized the March for Israel on November 14, 2023. Daroff claimed that more than 290,000 people attended the rally, making it &quot;the largest pro-Israel gathering in US history&quot;.

Progressive Jewish groups have floated leaving the Conference, particularly after the Conference declined to extend membership to liberal group J Street in 2014. In 2023, progressive group The Workers Circle withdrew from the Conference over what The Workers Circle claimed as policy differences. CoP CEO William Daroff stated that The Workers Circle owed $15,000 in membership fees and had not raised any concerns prior to its announcement. Other left-leaning Jewish groups expressed that they would remain in the Conference.

As of 2022, the CoP comprised 53 American Jewish groups from across the political spectrum. According to CEO William Daroff, the CoP represents the views of liberal groups critical of Israel like J Street, but explicitly anti-Zionist groups like Jewish Voice for Peace and IfNotNow were &quot;beyond the pale.&quot; The CoP pulled out of meetings with the Biden Administration in 2024 over the inclusion of a group closely associated with IfNotNow.

Citing the CoP as a model, the Conference of Presidents of Christian Organizations in Support of Israel launched in September 2024.

<doc id="184204" wikidata="Q2340324" url="?curid=184204" title="Xander Harris">
<text>Alexander Lavelle Harris is a fictional character created for the action-horror/fantasy television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (1997–2003). He was developed by Joss Whedon and portrayed throughout the television series by Nicholas Brendon and in two episodes by his twin brother, Kelly Donovan. He was conceived as an everyman and a male character for series heroine Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) to interact with, and to provide comic relief in the series. Xander is one of several friends of Buffy who assist her in saving the world against numerous supernatural events that plague Sunnydale, California, a town built over a doorway to hell.

Xander is based in part on Whedon himself, particularly in his high school years; as such, he is often the most geeky as well as witty and verbose of &quot;Buffy&quot;&#x27;s characters. The character&#x27;s overriding arc through the series has been his struggle towards maturity and earning the respect of others. In the canonical comic book continuation of the series, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight&quot; (2007–2011), Xander comes to achieve these goals in becoming the tactical leader of a global army of Vampire Slayers alongside Buffy.

Academic attention to the character has frequently come in the form of gender studies or with a focus on social class, reflecting Xander&#x27;s working class home life and his fears of inadequacy. However, Xander&#x27;s unique position as both outside and within the main group enhances his insight into the other characters, especially as the series continues; in &quot;Season Eight&quot;, he is Buffy&#x27;s unofficial &quot;Watcher&quot;, who watches over her and has a clear perspective. Critics have noted that although Xander frequently exhibits a struggle of masculinity, his storylines often focus on his romantic conquests. Following his unreciprocated love for Buffy, these include the tumultuous relationship with rich girl Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter), brief fling with his best friend Willow (Alyson Hannigan) and his long-term relationship with ex-demon Anya (Emma Caulfield). 
In &quot;Season Eight&quot;, the character&#x27;s older-brother relationship with Buffy&#x27;s little sister Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) also develops along romantic lines, too late for Buffy to realize her compatibility with Xander.

The character of Xander Harris also appears in numerous items in the series Expanded Universe, such as comic books, tie-in novels and video games.

==Appearances==

===Television===

Xander Harris is introduced in season 1&#x27;s (1997) two-part premiere &quot;Welcome to the Hellmouth&quot;/&quot;The Harvest&quot;. Xander meets Buffy Summers (Gellar), the Slayer, on her first day at Sunnydale High, as well as her Watcher Rupert Giles (Anthony Head). While in the library, he secretly listens in on a and conversation between Buffy and Giles in which she identifies herself as the Slayer. After his friend Jesse (Eric Balfour) is made a vampire, Xander accidentally kills him, resulting in him resenting vampires. Xander and his best friend Willow (Hannigan) become Buffy&#x27;s reliable sidekicks. He pines for Buffy&#x27;s romantic affection, oblivious to Willow&#x27;s affections for him, and distrusts Buffy&#x27;s boyfriend, the ensouled vampire Angel (David Boreanaz). In the season finale, &quot;Prophecy Girl&quot;, Xander saves Buffy&#x27;s life by administering CPR after she is drowned by the Master (Mark Metcalf).

In season 2 (1997–1998), Xander begins a turbulent and ambiguous relationship with popular girl Cordelia Chase (Carpenter) after they are thrown together in several life-or-death situations. He tells Willow that she is his best friend but that he has no romantic feelings for her, to Willow&#x27;s dismay. Xander is briefly turned into a soldier in the episode &quot;Halloween&quot;, and retains extensive military knowledge and training thereafter; in &quot;Innocence&quot;, this knowledge proves essential to helping Buffy defeat a demon known as The Judge who had been believed practically invincible. In times, Xander gradually honed his fighting capabilities after a chain of events against supernatural and human threats. When Cordelia decides she needs to break up to preserve her social status, Xander coerces witch Amy Madison (Elizabeth Anne Allen) to cast a love spell, which misfires; Cordelia is unaffected but, seeing how much Xander loves her, reunites with him in defiance of her former friends, in &quot;Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered&quot;. The episode &quot;Go Fish&quot; focuses on Xander, after he joins the swim team to investigate the disappearances of Sunnydale High swimmers. In the season finale &quot;Becoming, Part Two&quot;, Xander decides not to tell Buffy about Willow&#x27;s plan to re-ensoul Angel—who has lost his soul, reverted to his vampire persona Angelus, and is going to bring about the apocalypse— so that she will not hesitate to kill him in order to save the world. Buffy is surprised and grief-stricken when Angel regains his soul moments before she must kill him.

Season 3 (1998–1999) begins with Xander and his friends slaying demons since Buffy ran away to Los Angeles. Some time after Buffy&#x27;s return, Xander sees Angel and Buffy together and rushes to tell Giles of Angel&#x27;s return in &quot;Revelations&quot;. Xander and the others confront Buffy, angry that she concealed Angel&#x27;s return. While still angry, Xander tells Faith that Angel is alive. When Faith decides to slay Angel, Xander is eager to join her. When Cordelia catches Xander kissing Willow in &quot;Lovers Walk&quot;, she dumps him. They ultimately part as friends, although only after an extended period of mutual antagonism. &quot;The Zeppo&quot; is a comedic episode focusing on Xander: the episode begins with Cordelia mocking him as a &quot;loser&quot;, which upsets him. A solo adventure begins when the rest of the Scoobies insist he stay away from the dangerous fight with the Sisterhood of Jhe; he borrows his uncle&#x27;s classic car, loses his virginity to mentally unstable rogue Slayer Faith (Eliza Dushku), and single-handedly stops a band of zombies from destroying Sunnydale High School. His calm handling of the incident significantly enhances his self-confidence and, when again mocked by Cordelia, is unperturbed. Xander takes Anya (Caulfield), formerly vengeance demon Anyanka, to his prom in &quot;The Prom&quot;, and his retained military training proves useful in defeating the evil Mayor (Harry Groener) in season finale &quot;Graduation Day&quot;.

In season 4 (1999–2000), Xander&#x27;s feelings of inferiority and isolation increase, as he has not enrolled in college with his friends. Outside the core group, Xander strengthens his relationship with Anya and the two eventually fall in love. In the season 4 climax &quot;Primeval&quot;, Xander becomes the &quot;Heart&quot; in the spell, which conjoins him with Buffy, Willow and Giles to defeat Adam (George Hertzberg), a part-demon, part-human cyborg monster. Finale episode &quot;Restless&quot; delves into the characters&#x27; psyches through dream sequences; Xander&#x27;s dream involves his erotic attraction to Buffy&#x27;s mom (Kristine Sutherland), Willow and her girlfriend Tara (Amber Benson), his fear of his abusive father, and features a re-enactment of 1979 film &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;.

In season 5 (2000–2001), Xander matures. He becomes a carpenter and construction worker, and moves into his own apartment with Anya. He comes under the thrall of Dracula in premiere episode &quot;Buffy vs. Dracula&quot;, becoming his Renfield. The episode &quot;The Replacement&quot; focuses on the two aspects of Xander: the emotionally sensible, driven man, and the comedic buffoon. Xander-centric episode &quot;Triangle&quot; sees him defend Willow and Anya equally from Anya&#x27;s ex-boyfriend Olaf the Troll (Abraham Benrubi) when ordered to choose between them. In the season finale, he asks Anya to marry him, and in the final battle he uses a wrecking ball to assist Buffy in defeating the season&#x27;s villain, hell-goddess Glory (Clare Kramer).

In season 6 (2001–2002), Xander and his friends resurrect Buffy, who had sacrificed herself to close the portal between dimensions opened by Glory. This has consequences; Buffy sinks into depression. Xander&#x27;s doubts about his future with Anya are expressed when he summons the all-singing demon Sweet (Hinton Battle), in the musical episode &quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot;. A demon exploits these fears in &quot;Hell&#x27;s Bells&quot;; Xander leaves Anya heartbroken at the altar, and she resumes working as a vengeance demon. In the season finale, when a grief-stricken Willow tries to end the world, only Xander&#x27;s compassion and love for her is able to stop that apocalypse. 

In season 7 (2002–2003), when Buffy&#x27;s little sister Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) mistakenly believes herself to be a Potential Slayer, Xander empathizes with her disappointment over not being the one in the spotlight, in &quot;Potential&quot;. Season 7 episode &quot;Conversations with Dead People&quot; is the only &quot;Buffy&quot; episode in which Xander does not appear. In the episode &quot;Dirty Girls&quot;, Xander&#x27;s left eye is gouged out by the evil preacher Caleb (Nathan Fillion), and he begins wearing an eyepatch. Though he and Anya get back together, in the series finale, &quot;Chosen&quot;, Anya is killed by a Bringer&#x27;s sword. Andrew (Tom Lenk), the only witness to her death, tells him Anya died saving his life. Xander responds, &quot;That&#x27;s my girl. Always doing the stupid thing.&quot;

Though Brendon does not portray Xander again subsequent to &quot;Chosen&quot;, the &quot;Angel&quot; episode &quot;Damage&quot; (2004) mentions that Xander is in Africa, recruiting newly activated Slayers for Buffy&#x27;s team. Between 2001 and 2004, Joss Whedon and Jeph Loeb developed a 4-minute pilot episode for &quot;Buffy the Animated Series&quot;, which was set during the show&#x27;s first season. Had the series been picked up by a network, it would have featured Xander (voiced by Nicholas Brendon) in more adventures set during &quot;Buffy&quot;&#x27;s first season. Following a 2008 leak of the pilot to YouTube, Loeb expressed some hope that the series may be resurrected in some form.

===Literature===
Concurrent with the television series, Xander appears in canonical tie-ins to the television series. Xander appears in most &quot;Buffy&quot; comics and novels (those set within Buffy&#x27;s Sunnydale years), and is the featured character of several. &quot;The Xander Years, Vol 1.&quot; and &quot;Vol. 2&quot; for instance are each novelization of three key Xander episodes from the show&#x27;s first three seasons, spanning &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Pet&quot; to &quot;The Zeppo&quot;.

The 2004 comic &quot;Antique&quot; depicts Xander resuming his position as Dracula&#x27;s loyal manservant at the vampire&#x27;s Translyvanian castle for several months, before Buffy and two new Slayers rescue Xander. Subsequently, the character appears three years later in the &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight&quot; series of comic books. Xander appears from the premiere issue, &quot;The Long Way Home&quot; (2007) by Joss Whedon. In &quot;Season Eight&quot;, Xander leads the Slayers and operates their central command in Scotland; Buffy describes him as her unwilling &quot;Watcher&quot;. Xander invites comparison to Marvel Comics&#x27; character Nick Fury. Xander&#x27;s new relationship with Slayer Renée is cut short when she is killed in &quot;Wolves at the Gate&quot; (2008) by Drew Goddard. Goddard&#x27;s story is also a continuation to &quot;Antique&quot;; Xander ends his friendship with Dracula. In Jane Espenson&#x27;s &quot;Retreat&quot; story arc (2009), as Buffy begins to realize she has developed a romantic attraction to Xander, she discovers his newfound romantic relationship with Dawn; Xander had previously been her confidante throughout &quot;Season Eight&quot;. Buffy tries to explain her feelings to Xander in Joss Whedon&#x27;s &quot;Turbulence&quot; (2010), though he dismisses these feelings as her need for stability; Xander admits to Buffy, that he truly loves Dawn. In its final arc, &quot;Last Gleaming&quot; (2011), Xander witnesses a possessed Angel kill Giles in the ruins of Sunnydale, as well as Buffy&#x27;s destruction of the source of all magic. Subsequently, he and Dawn settle down and move to San Francisco, where they allow Buffy to stay with them while she waitresses and hunts vampires by night.

In the follow-up comic book, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine&quot; (2011–14), Buffy has moved out of Xander and Dawn&#x27;s home, and they have less contact with her than before. Following the events of &quot;Season Eight&quot;, Xander struggles to control his anger. In &quot;Welcome to the Team&quot; (2012–13), Dawn falls ill and begins to die as a result of magic&#x27;s absence. What&#x27;s more, the world, including Xander and Buffy, is slowly forgetting she ever existed. In &quot;The Watcher&quot; (2013), the season&#x27;s villains, mystical &#x27;Siphon&#x27; Severin and rogue Slayer Simone persuade Xander to assist them in their plot to turn back time and avert Twilight. In the final arc, &quot;The Core,&quot; Xander supplies them with information from an ancient tome on vampires Buffy owns. Acting on the same information, Buffy and Willow decide that the Deeper Well in England—a prison for ancient demons—may contain enough magic to save Dawn, and Xander travels with them. While entering the Well, Xander confesses his betrayal to Buffy and informs her of Severin&#x27;s plan to use the magic in the Well to turn back time, which could destroy the universe. He stands beside Buffy when they discover Simone&#x27;s ulterior motive for entering the Well; she has allowed herself to be sired by the very demon which created the first vampire, transforming herself into a powerful vampire/Slayer hybrid. During battle in the Well Severin dies as he explodes with power. The energy is absorbed by the new Seed of Wonder Willow had created, restoring magic to the world. Buffy dusts Simone and Willow returns everyone to San Francisco and saves Dawn with magic and Buffy&#x27;s blood. Xander thinks Dawn feels different and is guiltily convinced she somehow knows about his betrayal, despite Buffy forgiving him and telling him he is being too hard on himself.

In &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten&quot; (2014–16), Xander has more of a starring role, and the first arc, &quot;New Rules,&quot; is co-written by his former portrayer, Nicholas Brendon. Following &quot;Season Nine&quot;, Xander and Dawn&#x27;s relationship is strained. Xander, wracked with guilt, is convinced something is odd about her, and has begun talking to possibly hallucinated visions of his ex-girlfriend Anya. He does not know, as Dawn later confesses to Buffy, that she is experiencing intense emotional anguish from reliving her entire life at the moment Willow brought her back. When Dracula rolls in to town to help the Slayer combat the threat of new, more powerful vampires with powers like his, Xander slips back into the manservant role and confesses to Dawn that he knows she does not really love him, which Dawn tearfully admits is true. After Xander is freed from Dracula&#x27;s influence Dawn admits the truth of her emotional state to him and they agree to end their relationship. However, Xander pledges he will get Dawn to fall in love with him once again.

===Video games===
Xander appears in video games based on &quot;Buffy&quot;. Brendon lent his voice for Xander in the 2002 &quot;Buffy&quot; game for Xbox and the multi-console 2003 video game &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Chaos Bleeds&quot;, in which Xander is a playable character. In the 2002 game, Xander is not a playable character, but Buffy can acquire weapons from him over the course of the game. &quot;Chaos Bleeds&quot; is set in season 5 of the television series; in Xander&#x27;s levels, he is sent to an alternate universe. After the level at Sunnydale High, he has to do battle with an alternate universe Anyanka, the level&#x27;s boss; a magical tophat that releases rabbits evens their playing field slightly. Following the level at the zoo featured in &quot;The Pack&quot;, Buffy battles against an evil alternate reality version of Giles, styled &quot;Ripper&quot;. &quot;Chaos Bleeds&quot; prompted prequel comic books published by Dark Horse and a novelisation, which treats it as a &quot;lost&quot; episode of season 5.

==Casting==

Nicholas Brendon&#x27;s twin brother Kelly Donovan would often stunt double for Xander in the series, most notably in the episode &quot;The Replacement&quot;, where dual Xanders appear on-screen at the same time. They both use stage names; their surname is Shultz; as children, they were inseparable.
Before landing the role of Xander, Brendon had hit &quot;rock bottom&quot;: his girlfriend had left him, he was working as a waiter and could barely afford his rent, and had almost given up on getting good work. After buying the wrong kind of Pop Tarts for his co-workers, his boss fired him and told him &quot;You should be acting.&quot; Brendon was attracted to the pilot script for &quot;Buffy&quot; because of how much he had hated high school. Brendon recognised that Xander was based on Joss Whedon when he had attended high school, accounting for why Xander &quot;gets all the good lines&quot;. Brendon did not get much acting work after &quot;Buffy&quot; finished, and went into an alcoholism rehabilitation centre in 2004. As of 2007, as Niki Stafford notes in her &quot;Unofficial Guide&quot;, the actor has had comparatively more work since with stage productions.

For the season 5 episode &quot;The Replacement&quot;, where a demon splits Xander into two people along the lines of his immature and his more adult characteristics, Donovan is cast to play the &quot;other&quot; Xander in scenes where both appear onscreen together. Both actors found playing the character together to be a fun experience.

==Analysis==

One academic analysis of the series finds that Xander has much in common with the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; character Ron Weasley. The writer cites his proximity to the main character, his comparative working class status to best friend Willow (as with Weasley and Hermione), his status as an object of mockery in school. For both Xander and Ron, their comparative lack of special gifts &quot;accentuates the loyalty and bravery... [each] offers as a friend&quot; given that the characters often place themselves in mortal danger. Cordelia&#x27;s statement to Xander in &quot;The Zeppo,&quot; which compares him to &quot;Superman&quot; character Jimmy Olsen, is noted as another example qualifying Xander&#x27;s everyman status.

Though Xander is often &quot;the heart&quot; of the Scooby Gang, in &quot;The Zeppo&quot; he is excluded from their battle against a hydra-like demon. Through the use of jump cuts between melodramatic scenes with Buffy, and for instance, informant Willy the Barkeeper (Saverio Guerra) to Xander and a gang of zombies in a drunken car journey, Xander is used as a vehicle to point out the ways in which &quot;Buffy&quot; ordinarily avoids being &quot;over the top&quot; by integrating Xander (as the show&#x27;s source of humour) into the main narrative rather than separating the two. His loss of his virginity to Faith, for example, is musically cued as an anti-romantic parallel to the swelling, symphonic romance scene that Xander oversees between Buffy and Angel; on his departure from the carnal bed, the music is re-cued. The episode depicts Xander single-handedly saving the school, and potentially the world (given the Hellmouth beneath it) from an explosion in simultaneity against glimpses of the other Scoobies&#x27; struggles with the hydra demon. As the episode draws to a climax, the two settings begin to erode into one, as the demon breaks through walls in the basement and enters into the episode&#x27;s Xander scenes. Stevenson notes that it is fitting for the character to have his most heroic moment in the school basement, given that in season 4 he will be reduced to living in his parents&#x27;; Xander&#x27;s fears in &quot;Restless&quot; explore his feeling of being &quot;trapped&quot; in that basement. Wilcox argues that the basement is a representation of the subconscious, and that young carefree zombie Jack O&#x27;Toole (Channon Roe) represents Xander&#x27;s id, his inner desires. The episode brings to light how the basis for heroism rests in the subconscious, and also how as the two battles increasingly merge, his friends cannot hope to save the world and save others unless Xander&#x27;s battle with the Self is also won. In his confrontation with Jack, just as in his confrontation with Dark Willow in season 6&#x27;s &quot;Grave&quot;, Xander saves the world through his words. As the &quot;warrior of words&quot;, Wilcox feels that this makes Xander the character who most clearly represents series creator Joss Whedon.

Throughout the series, Xander&#x27;s family are seen to be highly dysfunctional and composed of alcoholics. In &quot;Homecoming&quot;, he admits to swallowing his pride to borrow a tuxedo from his cousin Rigby, from a wealthier branch of the family, who, as Xander puts it &quot;shun us... as they should&quot;. Xander relates in &quot;Amends&quot; that he sleeps outside at Christmas to avoid the family quarrels. This leads him to seek a surrogate family in his friendships with Buffy, Willow and Giles. Xander lacks Giles&#x27;s and Willow&#x27;s academic intelligence, and Buffy&#x27;s physical prowess. Cordelia is initially ashamed to be Xander&#x27;s girlfriend. Throughout the series, Xander struggles to contribute meaningfully to the group dynamic. His dissatisfaction reaches a nadir in season 4: Xander&#x27;s physical dislocation from his friends, who are now in college, leads to a profound sense of being useless. In &quot;Restless&quot;, his menial jobs and degrading habitat rise to the surface of his dream narrative. Before falling asleep, he begins to watch &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; with Willow, Buffy and Giles, who comments, &quot;Oh, I&#x27;m beginning to understand this now. It&#x27;s all about the journey, isn&#x27;t it.&quot; Xander&#x27;s dream, in turn, is one of intense self-exploration. In his dream, Xander goes to use the bathroom, and is emasculated and infantilized by Buffy asking him if he needs any help: this scene shows Xander&#x27;s &quot;sense of insecurity and powerlessness&quot;. Nevertheless, he becomes lost and finds himself in his parents&#x27; basement. From there, he finds himself in his ice cream truck, where Anya asks if he knows what he is doing, underlining the aimlessness of his journey; he is in the basement once again. When suddenly he is in the army and Principal Snyder (as a character in &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;) asks where he comes from, he says, &quot;The basement, mostly.&quot; He fears that his military interrogator is correct in saying that he is &quot;the whipping boy&quot; and &quot;set on a sacrificial stone&quot;. (This position of being less &quot;chosen&quot; for social inclusion and great things than his peers makes him uniquely able to comfort Dawn in season 7&#x27;s &quot;Potential&quot;.)

Although &quot;The Replacement&quot; sets up its narrative as an evil twin television narrative trope, its catch is that &quot;both&quot; Xanders are in fact the real Xander. In this episode, Xander uncovers that he has the power within himself to be the adult, suave and confident man whom he had spent the episode envying. &quot;The dual Xanders&quot;, Stephens argues, &quot;represents the duality in all of us.&quot; The episode demonstrates that Xander is not defined by his weaker personality traits but by the core personality that is a merger of his stronger and weaker traits. Xander&#x27;s costume choices in various Halloween episodes show the audience his desire for macho credence: he comes, variously, as a cowboy, a soldier and as James Bond. As a soldier, he was in fact magically turned into his costume, and got to retain his macho status along with the useful military knowledge. Following this incident, his choice of costume represents explicitly whom he would like to actually become. Various episodes highlight Xander&#x27;s intense bravery; for example, he faces down evil Angelus (Boreanaz) at Buffy&#x27;s hospital door in the episode &quot;Killed by Death&quot;, and he offers his life in place of Willow&#x27;s in &quot;Inca Mummy Girl&quot;. When Buffy prepares to face Angelus in the season 2 finale, he arrives with a rock in hand saying &quot;Cavalry&#x27;s here. Cavalry&#x27;s a frightened guy with a rock, but it&#x27;s here.&quot; Stephens argues that this makes up the essence of Xander&#x27;s character; though powerless, he is always both loyal and brave. As his relationship with Dawn in &quot;Potential&quot; and his support of Buffy show, Xander finds that his real calling seems to be in his role as the &quot;eternal supporter&quot;. One journalist describes the character as a modern-day Greek Chorus, always an outsider looking in, and a version of Joss Whedon himself. One author writes that the focus of Xander&#x27;s character development has always been his quest for maturity.

While their characters were an item, Brendon was close friends with Charisma Carpenter, who portrays Cordelia. When they broke up on the show, and Cordelia transitioned to the spin-off &quot;Angel&quot;, he commented that they had hardly spoken due to being in different scenes all the time. This felt like a real-life breakup in many ways. When Xander got to become serious with Anya in season 5, the actor commented that it was nice to see Xander mature after four years of playing the &quot;nerd&quot;. Lorna Jowett feels that Xander&#x27;s romances throughout the season almost seem to &quot;make up&quot; for the character&#x27;s shortcomings, which Stafford attributes to Xander&#x27;s origin as Whedon&#x27;s author surrogate in the show. Anya comments that Xander is &quot;a Viking in the sack&quot; in &quot;The Yoko Factor&quot;, indicating not just masculinity but also virility. Within the show, gay character Larry mistakes Xander for being gay, and Xander&#x27;s unguarded comments towards Spike have led some fans who write fan fiction to depict Xander as being gay. Jowett attributes this to Xander&#x27;s internal struggles (which concern a crisis of masculinity and his role amongst his friends) do not contain a readily accessible solution for viewers to hold onto. She argues that some fans see this as a &quot;stumbling block&quot;, perhaps unconsciously, to recognising the character&#x27;s masculinity and at a wider level, in constructing a notion of contemporary masculinity.

In the DVD commentary for the episode &quot;Dirty Girls&quot;, writer Drew Goddard mentions there was talk of killing off Xander towards the end of season 7 and having the First Evil assume Xander&#x27;s appearance when conversing with Buffy for the remainder of the season. This was ultimately rejected since Xander was thought to be too important to the series, and his death occurring so late in the season would leave little time to deal with it correctly, and that throughout the series&#x27; run, Xander was the one character who never wavered, and to punish that characteristic with death would send a message the staff was not trying to convey. Instead of killing Xander, he was blinded in one eye.

==Reception==
For his role as Xander, Brendon was nominated for Saturn Award in 1998 and 1999 for Best Genre TV Actor and in 2000 for the Supporting Actor. At least one later critique of Xander&#x27;s character regarded him less sympathetically as a &quot;Nice Guy™&quot;.

===Impact===
&quot;The Zeppo&quot; in season 3 was a Xander-centric episode, which only featured the other characters in humorous aside glimpses of their struggle to save the world. This episode has proved very influential on later television writers. In his &quot;Production Notes: Doodles in the Margins of Time&quot; in 2007, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; executive producer Russell T Davies cites &quot;The Zeppo&quot; along with &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Lower Decks&quot; as an influence on his 2006 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;Love &amp; Monsters&quot;. The episode provided a television format that came to be known as the &quot;Doctor-lite episode&quot;, an annual tradition for &quot;Doctor Who&quot; from 2006 to 2008, often featuring a significant guest star carrying the bulk of the acting responsibilities as &quot;Doctor Who&quot; has a much smaller cast than &quot;Buffy&quot;.

<doc id="184211" wikidata="Q2608698" url="?curid=184211" title="Children of the Mind">
<text>Children of the Mind (1996) is a novel by American author Orson Scott Card, the fourth in his successful &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; series of science fiction novels that focus on the character Ender Wiggin. This book was originally the second half of &quot;Xenocide&quot;, before it was split into two novels.

==Plot summary==

At the start of &quot;Children of the Mind&quot;, Jane, the evolved computer intelligence, is using her newly discovered abilities to take the races of buggers, humans and &quot;pequeninos&quot; outside the universe and back instantaneously. She uses these powers to move them to distant habitable planets for colonization. She is losing her memory and concentration as the vast computer network connected to the ansible is being shut down. If she is to survive, she must find a way to transfer her &quot;aiúa&quot; (or soul) to a human body.

Peter Wiggin and Si Wang-Mu travel to the worlds of Divine Wind and Pacifica to persuade the Japanese-led swing group of the Starways Congress to revoke their order to destroy Lusitania. By tracing the decision-making trail backwards, they are able to show a philosopher his influence on the Starways Congress. After several complications, the philosopher persuades the Tsutsumi clan to exert their influence with the Necessarian faction in the Starways Congress to stop the Lusitania fleet. The admiral at the head of the Lusitania fleet, however, disobeys the Congress&#x27;s order and does what he believes Ender Wiggin, the perpetrator of the first Xenocide, would have done and fires a missile containing the Molecular Disruption Device (MDD).

Upon Ender Wiggin&#x27;s death, Jane guides his &quot;aiúa&quot; to Peter&#x27;s body, while she is granted possession of Young Val&#x27;s body, and thus is not destroyed when the ansible shuts down. She is then able to continue transporting starships instantaneously by borrowing the vast mental capacity of the simple-minded Pequenino mother-trees. She transports a ship with Peter and Wang-Mu around the missile, then transports the missile and them to inside of the Lusitania fleet, where it is then disarmed and disabled. Peter and Wang-Mu&#x27;s efforts finally come to fruition, and the destruction of Lusitania is averted.

Jane falls in love with Miro, and Peter with Wang-mu. Both couples are married under one of the mother-trees of the pequeninos on the same day as Ender&#x27;s funeral.

<text>Lambert Adolphe Jacques Quetelet FRSF or FRSE (; 22 February 1796 – 17 February 1874) was a Belgian-French astronomer, mathematician, statistician and sociologist who founded and directed the Brussels Observatory and was influential in introducing statistical methods to the social sciences. His name is sometimes spelled with an accent as &quot;Quételet&quot;.

He also founded the science of anthropometry and developed the body mass index (BMI) scale, originally called the Quetelet Index. His work on measuring human characteristic to determine the ideal &quot;l&#x27;homme moyen&quot; (&quot;the average man&quot;), played a key role in the origins of eugenics.

== Biography ==
Adolphe was born in Ghent (which, at the time was a part of the new French Republic). He was the son of François-Augustin-Jacques-Henri Quetelet, a Frenchman and Anne Françoise Vandervelde, a Flemish woman. His father was born at Ham, Picardy, and being of a somewhat adventurous spirit, he crossed the English Channel and became both a British citizen and the secretary of a Scottish nobleman. In that capacity, he traveled with his employer on the Continent, particularly spending time in Italy. At about 31, he settled in Ghent and was employed by the city, where Adolphe was born, the fifth of nine children, several of whom died in childhood.

Francois died when Adolphe was only seven years old. Adolphe studied at the Ghent Lycée, where he afterwards started teaching mathematics in 1815 at the age of 19. In 1819, he moved to the Athenaeum in Brussels and in the same year he completed his dissertation (&quot;De quibusdam locis geometricis, necnon de curva focal – Of some new properties of the focal distance and some other curves&quot;).

Quetelet received a doctorate in mathematics in 1819 from the University of Ghent. Shortly thereafter, the young man set out to convince government officials and private donors to build an astronomical observatory in Brussels; he succeeded in 1828.
He became a member of the Royal Academy in 1820. He lectured at the museum for sciences and letters and at the Belgian Military School. In 1825, he became a correspondent of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands, in 1827 he became a member. In 1839, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society. From 1841 to 1851, he was a supernumerary associate in the institute, and when it became Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences he became foreign member. In 1850, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

Quetelet also founded several statistical journals and societies, and was especially interested in creating international cooperation among statisticians. He encouraged the creation of a statistical section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BA), which later became the Royal Statistical Society, of which he became the first overseas member. In 1853 he chaired both the International Maritime Conference and the first International Statistical Congress. He was a founding member of the first &quot;Société des douze&quot;.

In 1855, Quetelet developed apoplexy, which diminished but did not end his scientific activity.

He died in Brussels on 17 February 1874, and is buried in the Brussels Cemetery.

In 1825, he married Cécile-Virginie Curtet.

== Work ==

His scientific research encompassed a wide range of different scientific disciplines: meteorology, astronomy, mathematics, statistics, demography, sociology, criminology and history of science. He made significant contributions to scientific development, but he also wrote several monographs directed to the general public. He founded the Royal Observatory of Belgium, founded or co-founded several national and international statistical societies and scientific journals, and presided over the first series of the International Statistical Congresses. Quetelet was a liberal and an anticlerical, but not an atheist or materialist nor a socialist.

===Social physics===
The new science of probability and statistics was mainly used in astronomy at the time, where it was essential to account for measurement errors around means. This was done using the method of least squares. Quetelet was among the first to apply statistics to social science, planning what he called &quot;social physics&quot;. He was keenly aware of the overwhelming complexity of social phenomena, and the many variables that needed measurement. His goal was to understand the statistical laws underlying such phenomena as crime rates, marriage rates or suicide rates. He wanted to explain the values of these variables by other social factors. These ideas were rather controversial among other scientists at the time who held that it contradicted the concept of freedom of choice.

His most influential book was &quot;Sur l&#x27;homme et le développement de ses facultés, ou Essai de physique sociale&quot;, published in 1835 (In English translation, it is titled &quot;Treatise on Man&quot;, but a literal translation would be &quot;On Man and the Development of his Faculties, or Essay on Social Physics&quot;). In it, he outlines the project of a social physics and describes his concept of the &quot;average man&quot; (&quot;l&#x27;homme moyen&quot;) who is characterized by the mean values of measured variables that follow a normal distribution. He collected data about many such variables. Quetelet wrote about these values as &quot;ideals&quot; with deviations from them as being less than or more than ideal. He saw the average body as an ideal beauty and something to be desired and his work was influential on Francis Galton who coined the term &quot;eugenics&quot;.

Quetelet&#x27;s student Pierre François Verhulst developed the logistic function in the 1830s as a model of population growth; see for details.

When Auguste Comte discovered that Quetelet had appropriated the term &#x27;social physics&#x27;, which Comte had originally introduced, Comte found it necessary to invent the term &#x27;sociologie&#x27; (sociology) because he disagreed with Quetelet&#x27;s notion that a theory of society could be derived from a collection of statistics.

Adolphe Quetelet also had a significant influence on Florence Nightingale who shared with him a religious view of statistics which saw understanding statistics as revealing the work of God in addition to statistics being a force of good administration. Nightingale met Quetelet in person at the 1860 International Statistical Congress in London, and they corresponded for years afterwards.

===Criminology===
Quetelet was an influential figure in criminology. Along with Andre-Michel Guerry, he helped to establish the cartographic school and positivist schools of criminology which made extensive use of statistical techniques. Through statistical analysis, Quetelet gained insight into the relationships between crime and other social factors. Among his findings were strong relationships between age and crime, as well as gender and crime. Other influential factors he found included climate, poverty, education, and alcohol consumption, with his research findings published in &quot;Of the Development of the Propensity to Crime&quot;.

===Anthropometry===

In his 1835 text on social physics, he presented his theory of human variance around the average, showing human traits were distributed according to a normal curve. The existence of such variation provided the basis for later writers, including Darwin, to argue that natural populations contained sufficient variability for artificial or natural selection to operate.

In terms of influence over later public health agendas, one of Quetelet&#x27;s lasting legacies was the establishment of a simple measure for classifying people&#x27;s weight relative to an ideal for their height. His proposal, the body mass index (or Quetelet index), has endured with minor variations to the present day. Anthropometric data is used in modern applications and referenced in the development of every consumer-based product.

==Awards and honours==
Quetelet was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1839.

The asteroid 1239 Queteleta is named after him. The title of Quetelet professor at Columbia University is awarded in his name.

<text>Otto of Lippe was a son of Bernhard II, Lord of Lippe. He was bishop of Utrecht as Otto II from 1216 to 1227. Several of his brothers also held high ecclesiastical offices in the Rhineland. He likely participated in the foundation of the Teutonic Order.

During the Fifth Crusade, Otto visited Palestine.

In 1227, Otto was joined by his former enemy, count Floris IV, Count of Holland, to suppress a rebellion by the people of Drenthe, led by Rudolph van Coevorden. He died in the Battle of Ane (a town close to Hardenberg) on 28 July 1227.
