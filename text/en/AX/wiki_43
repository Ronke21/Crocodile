<text>The is a group of Japanese dialects in the Kansai region (Kinki region) of Japan. In Japanese, is the common name and it is called in technical terms. The dialects of Kyoto and Osaka are known as , and were particularly referred to as such in the Edo period. The Kansai dialect is typified by the speech of Osaka, the major city of Kansai, which is referred to specifically as . It is characterized as being both more melodic and harsher by speakers of the standard language.

== Background ==
Since Osaka is the largest city in the region and its speakers received the most media exposure over the last century, non-Kansai-dialect speakers tend to associate the dialect of Osaka with the entire Kansai region. However, technically, Kansai dialect is not a single dialect but a group of related dialects in the region. Each major city and prefecture has a particular dialect, and residents take some pride in their particular dialectal variations.

The common Kansai dialect is spoken in Keihanshin (the metropolitan areas of the cities of Kyoto, Osaka and Kobe) and its surroundings, a radius of about around the Osaka-Kyoto area (see regional differences). This article mainly discusses variations in Keihanshin during the 20th and 21st centuries.

Even in the Kansai region, away from Keihanshin and its surrounding areas, there are dialects that differ from the characteristics generally considered to be Kansai dialect-like. Tajima and Tango (except Maizuru) dialects in northwest Kansai are too different to be regarded as Kansai dialects and are thus usually included in the Chūgoku dialect. Dialects spoken in Southeastern Kii Peninsula including Totsukawa and Owase are also far different from other Kansai dialects, and considered a language island.

The Shikoku dialect and the Hokuriku dialect share many similarities with the Kansai dialects, but are classified separately.

== History ==

The Kansai dialect has over a thousand years of history. When Kinai cities such as Heijō-kyō (Nara) and Heian-kyō (Kyoto) were Imperial capitals, the Kinai dialect, the ancestor of the Kansai dialect, was the &quot;de facto&quot; standard Japanese. It had an influence on all of the nation including the Edo dialect, the predecessor of modern Tokyo dialect. The literature style developed by the intelligentsia in Heian-kyō became the model of Classical Japanese language.

When the political and military center of Japan was moved to Edo under the Tokugawa Shogunate and the Kantō region grew in prominence, the Edo dialect took the place of the Kansai dialect. With the Meiji Restoration and the transfer of the imperial capital from Kyoto to Tokyo, the Kansai dialect became fixed in position as a provincial dialect. See also Early Modern Japanese.

As the Tokyo dialect was adopted with the advent of a national education/media standard in Japan, some features and intraregional differences of the Kansai dialect have diminished and changed. However, Kansai is the second most populated urban region in Japan after Kantō, with a population of about 20 million, so Kansai dialect is still the most widely spoken, known and influential non-standard Japanese dialect. The Kansai dialect&#x27;s idioms are sometimes introduced into other dialects and even standard Japanese. Many Kansai people are attached to their own speech and have strong regional rivalry against Tokyo.

Since the Taishō period, the form of Japanese comedy has been developed in Osaka, and a large number of Osaka-based comedians have appeared in Japanese media with Osaka dialect, such as Yoshimoto Kogyo. Because of such associations, Kansai speakers are often viewed as being more &quot;funny&quot; or &quot;talkative&quot; than typical speakers of other dialects. Tokyo people even occasionally imitate the Kansai dialect to provoke laughter or inject humor.

== Phonology ==

In phonetic terms, Kansai dialect is characterized by strong vowels and contrasted with Tokyo dialect, characterized by its strong consonants, but the basis of the phonemes is similar. The specific phonetic differences between Kansai and Tokyo are as follows:

=== Vowels ===

* is nearer to than to .
*In Standard, vowel reduction frequently occurs, but it is rare in Kansai. For example, the polite copula is pronounced nearly as in standard Japanese, but Kansai speakers tend to pronounce it distinctly as or even .
*In some registers, such as informal Tokyo speech, hiatuses often fuse into , as in and instead of &quot;yummy&quot; and &quot;great&quot;, but are usually pronounced distinctly in Kansai dialect. In Wakayama, is also pronounced distinctly; it usually fuses into in standard Japanese and almost all other dialects.
*A recurring tendency to lengthen vowels at the end of monomoraic nouns. Common examples are for &quot;tree&quot;, for &quot;mosquito&quot; and for &quot;eye&quot;.
*Contrarily, long vowels in Standard inflections are sometimes shortened. This is particularly noticeable in the volitional conjugation of verbs. For instance, meaning &quot;shall we go?&quot; is shortened in Kansai to . The common phrase of agreement, meaning &quot;that&#x27;s it&quot;, is replaced or even in Kansai.
*When vowels and semivowel follow , they sometimes palatalize with or . For example, &quot;I love you&quot; becomes , 日曜日 &quot;Sunday&quot; becomes にっちょうび and 賑やか &quot;lively, busy&quot; becomes にんぎゃか .

=== Consonants ===

*The syllable ひ is nearer to than to .
*The &quot;yotsugana&quot; are two distinct syllables, as they are in Tokyo, but Kansai speakers tend to pronounce じ and ず as and in place of Standard and .
*Intervocalic is pronounced either or in free variation, but is declining now.
*In a provocative speech, becomes , similar to the Tokyo Shitamachi dialect.
*The use of in place of . Some debuccalization of is apparent in most Kansai speakers, but it seems to have progressed more in morphological suffixes and inflections than in core vocabulary. This process has produced はん for さん &quot;-san&quot; &quot;Mr., Ms.&quot;, まへん for ません (formal negative form), and まひょ for ましょう (formal volitional form), ひちや for 質屋 &quot;pawnshop&quot;, among other examples.
*The change of and in some words such as さぶい for 寒い &quot;cold&quot;.
*Especially in the rural areas, are sometimes harmonized or metathesized. For example, でんでん for 全然 &quot;never, not at all&quot;, かだら or からら for 体 &quot;body&quot;. A play on words around these sound changes goes as follows: 淀川の水飲んれ腹らら下りや for 淀川の水飲んで腹だだ下りや &quot;I drank water of Yodo River and have the trots&quot;.
*The + vowel in the verb conjugations is sometimes changed to as well as colloquial Tokyo speech. For example, 何してるねん？ &quot;What are you doing?&quot; often changes 何してんねん？ in fluent Kansai speech.

=== Pitch accent ===
The pitch accent in Kansai dialect is very different from the standard Tokyo accent, so non-Kansai Japanese can recognize Kansai people easily from that alone. The Kansai pitch accent is called the Kyoto-Osaka type accent (京阪式アクセント, &quot;Keihan-shiki akusento&quot;) in technical terms. It is used in most of Kansai, Shikoku and parts of western Chūbu region. The Tokyo accent distinguishes words only by downstep, but the Kansai accent distinguishes words also by initial tones, so Kansai dialect has more pitch patterns than standard Japanese. In the Tokyo accent, the pitch between first and second morae usually changes, but in the Kansai accent, it does not always.

Below is a list of simplified Kansai accent patterns. H represents a high pitch and L represents a low pitch.
# or 
#* The high pitch appears on the first mora and the others are low: H-L, H-L-L, H-L-L-L, etc.
#* The high pitch continues for the set mora and the rest are low: H-H-L, H-H-L-L, H-H-H-L, &quot;etc.&quot;
#* The high pitch continues to the last: H-H, H-H-H, H-H-H-H, &quot;etc.&quot;
# or 
#* The pitch rises drastically the middle set mora and falls again: L-H-L, L-H-L-L, L-L-H-L, &quot;etc.&quot;
#* The pitch rises drastically the last mora: L-L-H, L-L-L-H, L-L-L-L-H, &quot;etc.&quot;
#** If high-initial accent words or particles attach to the end of the word, all morae are low: L-L-L(-H), L-L-L-L(-H), L-L-L-L-L(-H)
#* With two-mora words, there are two accent patterns. Both of these tend to be realized in recent years as L-H, L-H(-L).
#** The second mora rises and falls quickly. If words or particles attach to the end of the word, the fall is sometimes not realized: L-HL, L-HL(-L) or L-H(-L)
#** The second mora does not fall. If high-initial words or particles attach to the end of the word, both morae are low: L-H, L-L(-H)

== Grammar ==

Many words and grammar structures in Kansai dialect are contractions of their classical Japanese equivalents (it is unusual to contract words in such a way in standard Japanese). For example, &quot;chigau&quot; (to be different or wrong) becomes &quot;chau&quot;, &quot;yoku&quot; (well) becomes &quot;yō&quot;, and &quot;omoshiroi&quot; (interesting or funny) becomes &quot;omoroi&quot;. These contractions follow similar inflection rules as their standard forms, so &quot;chau&quot; is politely said &quot;chaimasu&quot; in the same way as &quot;chigau&quot; is inflected to &quot;chigaimasu&quot;.

=== Verbs ===
Kansai dialect also has two types of regular verb, 五段 &quot;godan verbs&quot; (&quot;-u&quot; verbs) and 一段 &quot;ichidan verbs&quot; (&quot;-ru&quot; verbs), and two irregular verbs, 来る (&quot;to come&quot;) and する (&quot;to do&quot;), but some conjugations are different from standard Japanese.

The geminated consonants found in godan verbs of standard Japanese verbal inflections are usually replaced with long vowels (often shortened in 3 morae verbs) in Kansai dialect (See also Onbin, u-onbin). Thus, for the verb 言う (&quot;to say&quot;), the past tense in standard Japanese 言った (&quot;said&quot;) becomes 言うた in Kansai dialect. This particular verb is emblematic of a native Kansai speaker, as most will unconsciously say 言うて instead of 言って or even if well-practiced at speaking in standard Japanese. Other examples of geminate replacement are 笑った (&quot;laughed&quot;) becoming 笑うた or わろた and 貰った (&quot;received&quot;) becoming 貰うた , もろた or even もうた .

An auxiliary verb] -てしまう (to finish something or to do something in unintentional or unfortunate circumstances) is contracted to -ちまう or -ちゃう in colloquial Tokyo speech but to -てまう in Kansai speech. Thus, しちまう , or しちゃう , becomes してまう . Furthermore, as the verb しまう is affected by the same sound changes as in other 五段 godan verbs, the past tense of this form is rendered as -てもうた or -てもた rather than -ちまった or -ちゃった : 忘れちまった or 忘れちゃった (&quot;I forgot [it]&quot;) in Tokyo is 忘れてもうた or 忘れてもた in Kansai.

The long vowel of the volitional form is often shortened; for example, 使おう (the volitional form of &quot;tsukau&quot;) becomes 使お , 食べよう (the volitional form of 食べる ) becomes 食べよ . The irregular verb する has special volitional form しょ（う） instead of しよう . The volitional form of another irregular verb 来る is 来よう as well as the standard Japanese, but when 来る is used as an auxiliary verb -てくる , -てこよう is sometimes replaced with -てこ（う） in Kansai.

The causative verb ending is usually replaced with in Kansai dialect; for example, させる (causative form of ) changes さす , 言わせる (causative form of 言う ) changes 言わす . Its -te form and perfective form change to and ; they also appear in transitive ichidan verbs such as 見せる (&quot;to show&quot;), e.g. 見して for 見せて .

The potential verb endings for 五段 godan and -られる for 一段 ichidan, recently often shortened -れる (ra-nuki kotoba), are common between the standard Japanese and Kansai dialect. For making their negative forms, it is only to replace -ない with -ん or -へん (See Negative). However, mainly in Osaka, potential negative form of 五段 godan verbs is often replaced with such as 行かれへん instead of 行けない and 行けへん &quot;can&#x27;t go&quot;. This is because overlaps with Osakan negative conjugation. In western Japanese including Kansai dialect, a combination of an adverb よう and -ん negative form is used as a negative form of the personal impossibility such as よう言わん &quot;I can&#x27;t say anything (in disgust or diffidence)&quot;.

==== Existence verbs ====
In Standard Japanese, the verb &quot;iru&quot; is used for reference to the existence of an animate object, and &quot;iru&quot; is replaced with &quot;oru&quot; in humble language and some written language. In western Japanese, &quot;oru&quot; is used not only in humble language but also in all other situations instead of &quot;iru&quot;.

Kansai dialect belongs to western Japanese, but いる and its variation, いてる (mainly Osaka), are used in Osaka, Kyoto, Shiga and so on. People in these areas, especially Kyoto women, tend to consider おる an outspoken or contempt word. They usually use it for mates, inferiors and animals; avoid using for elders (exception: respectful expression &quot;orareru&quot; and humble expression &quot;orimasu&quot;). In other areas such as Hyogo and Mie, いる is hardly used and おる does not have the negative usage. In parts of Wakayama, いる is replaced with ある , which is used for inanimate objects in most other dialects.

The verb おる is also used as a suffix and usually pronounced in that case. In Osaka, Kyoto, Shiga, northern Nara and parts of Mie, mainly in masculine speech, -よる shows annoying or contempt feelings for a third party, usually milder than -やがる . In Hyogo, southern Nara and parts of Wakayama, -よる is used for progressive aspect (See Aspect).

==== Negative ====
In informal speech, the negative verb ending, which is -ない in standard Japanese, is expressed with -ん or -へん , as in 行かん and 行かへん &quot;not going&quot;, which is 行かない in standard Japanese. -ん is a transformation of the classical Japanese negative form -ぬ and is also used for some idioms in standard Japanese. -へん is the result of contraction and phonological change of はせん , the emphatic form of . -やへん , a transitional form between はせん and へん , is sometimes still used for 一段 ichidan verbs. The godan verbs conjugation before &quot;-hen&quot; has two varieties: the more common conjugation is like 行かへん , but &quot;-ehen&quot; like 行けへん is also used in Osaka. When the vowel before -へん is , -へん often changes to -ひん , especially in Kyoto. The past negative form is -んかった and , a mixture of -ん or -へん and the standard past negative form -なかった . In traditional Kansai dialect, -なんだ and -へなんだ is used in the past negative form.

* 五段 godan verbs: 使う (&quot;to use&quot;) becomes 使わん and 使わへん , 使えへん 
* 上一段 kami-ichidan verbs: 起きる (&quot;to wake up&quot;) becomes 起きん and 起きやへん , 起きへん , 起きひん 
** one mora verbs: 見る (&quot;to see&quot;) becomes 見ん and 見やへん , 見えへん , 見いひん 
* 下一段 shimo-ichidan verbs: 食べる (&quot;to eat&quot;) becomes 食べん and 食べやへん , 食べへん 
** one mora verbs: 寝る (&quot;to sleep&quot;) becomes 寝ん and 寝やへん , 寝えへん 
* s-irregular verb: する becomes せん and しやへん , せえへん , しいひん 
* k-irregular verb: 来る becomes 来ん and きやへん , けえへん , きいひん 
** 来おへん , a mixture けえへん with standard 来ない , is also used lately by young people, especially in Kobe.

Generally speaking, -へん is used in almost negative sentences and -ん is used in strong negative sentences and idiomatic expressions. For example, -んといて or -んとって instead of standard -ないで means &quot;please do not to do&quot;; -んでもええ instead of standard -なくてもいい means &quot;need not do&quot;;-んと（あかん） instead of standard -なくちゃ（いけない） or -なければならない means &quot;must do&quot;. The last expression can be replaced by -な（あかん） or -んならん .

==== Imperative ====
Kansai dialect has two imperative forms. One is the normal imperative form, inherited from Late Middle Japanese. The -ろ form for ichidan verbs in standard Japanese is much rarer and replaced by or in Kansai. The normal imperative form is often followed by よ or や . The other is a soft and somewhat feminine form which uses the (ます stem), an abbreviation of + . The end of the soft imperative form is often elongated and is generally followed by や or な . In Kyoto, women often add よし to the soft imperative form.

* godan verbs: 使う becomes 使え in the normal form, 使い（い） in the soft one.
* 上一段 kami-ichidan verbs: 起きる becomes 起きい (L-H-L) in the normal form, 起き（い） (L-L-H) in the soft one.
* 下一段 shimo-ichidan verbs: 食べる becomes 食べえ (L-H-L) in the normal form, 食べ（え） (L-L-H) in the soft one.
* s-irregular verb: する becomes せえ in the normal form, し（い） in the soft one.
* k-irregular verb: 来る becomes こい in the normal form, き（い） in the soft one.

In the negative imperative mood, Kansai dialect also has the somewhat soft form which uses the &quot;ren&#x27;yōkei&quot; + な , an abbreviation of the &quot;ren&#x27;yōkei&quot; + なさるな . な sometimes changes to なや or ないな . This soft negative imperative form is the same as the soft imperative and な , Kansai speakers can recognize the difference by accent, but Tokyo speakers are sometimes confused by a command &quot;not to do&quot; something, which they interpret as an order to &quot;do&quot; it. Accent on the soft imperative form is flat, and the accent on the soft negative imperative form has a downstep before &quot;na&quot;.

* 五段 godan verbs: 使う becomes 使うな in the normal form, 使いな in the soft one.
* 上一段 kami-ichidan verbs: 起きる becomes 起きるな in the normal form, 起きな in the soft one.
* 下一段 shimo-ichidan verbs: 食べる becomes 食べるな in the normal form, 食べな in the soft one.
* s-irregular verb: する becomes するな or すな in the normal form, しな in the soft one.
* k-irregular verb: 来る becomes 来るな in the normal form, きな in the soft one.

=== Adjectives ===
The stem of adjective forms in Kansai dialect is generally the same as in standard Japanese, except for regional vocabulary differences. The same process that reduced the Classical Japanese terminal and attributive endings (し and き , respectively) to has reduced also the ren&#x27;yōkei ending く to , yielding such forms as 早う (contraction of 早う ) for 早く (&quot;quickly&quot;). Dropping the consonant from the final mora in all forms of adjective endings has been a frequent occurrence in Japanese over the centuries (and is the origin of such forms as ありがとう and おめでとう ), but the Kantō speech preserved く while reducing し and き to , thus accounting for the discrepancy in the standard language (see also Onbin)

The ending can be dropped and the last vowel of the adjective&#x27;s stem can be stretched out for a second mora, sometimes with a tonal change for emphasis. By this process, &quot;omoroi&quot; &quot;interesting, funny&quot; becomes &quot;omorō&quot; and &quot;atsui&quot; &quot;hot&quot; becomes &quot;atsū&quot; or &quot;attsū&quot;. This use of the adjective&#x27;s stem, often as an exclamation, is seen in classical literature and many dialects of modern Japanese, but is more often used in modern Kansai dialect.

There is not a special conjugated form for presumptive of adjectives in Kansai dialect, it is just addition of やろ to the plain form. For example, 安かろう (the presumptive form of 安い &quot;cheap&quot;) is hardly used and is usually replaced with the plain form + やろ likes 安いやろ . Polite suffixes です/だす/どす and ます are also added やろ for presumptive form instead of でしょう in standard Japanese. For example, 今日は晴れでしょう (&quot;It may be fine weather today&quot;) is replaced with 今日は晴れですやろ .

=== Copulae ===

The standard Japanese copula &quot;da&quot; is replaced by the Kansai dialect copula &quot;ya&quot;. The inflected forms maintain this difference, resulting in &quot;yaro&quot; for &quot;darō&quot; (presumptive), &quot;yatta&quot; for &quot;datta&quot; (past); &quot;darō&quot; is often considered to be a masculine expression, but &quot;yaro&quot; is used by both men and women. The negative copula &quot;de wa nai&quot; or &quot;ja nai&quot; is replaced by &quot;ya nai&quot; or &quot;ya arahen/arehen&quot; in Kansai dialect. &quot;Ya&quot; originated from &quot;ja&quot; (a variation of &quot;dearu&quot;) in late Edo period and is still commonly used in other parts of western Japan like Hiroshima, and is also used stereotypically by old men in fiction.

&quot;Ya&quot; and &quot;ja&quot; are used only informally, analogically to the standard &quot;da&quot;, while the standard &quot;desu&quot; is by and large used for the polite (teineigo) copula. For polite speech, -&quot;masu&quot;, &quot;desu&quot; and &quot;gozaimasu&quot; are used in Kansai as well as in Tokyo, but traditional Kansai dialect has its own polite forms. &quot;Desu&quot; is replaced by &quot;dasu&quot; in Osaka and &quot;dosu&quot; in Kyoto. There is another unique polite form &quot;omasu&quot; and it is often replaced by &quot;osu&quot; in Kyoto. The usage of &quot;omasu/osu&quot; is same as &quot;gozaimasu&quot;, the polite form of the verb &quot;aru&quot; and also be used for polite form of adjectives, but it is more informal than &quot;gozaimasu&quot;. In Osaka, &quot;dasu&quot; and &quot;omasu&quot; are sometimes shortened to &quot;da&quot; and &quot;oma&quot;. &quot;Omasu&quot; and &quot;osu&quot; have their negative forms &quot;omahen&quot; and &quot;ohen&quot;.

When some sentence-final particles and a presumptive inflection &quot;yaro&quot; follow -&quot;su&quot; ending polite forms, &quot;su&quot; is often combined especially in Osaka. Today, this feature is usually considered to be dated or exaggerated Kansai dialect.
* -n&#x27;na (-su + na), emphasis. e.g. &quot;Bochi-bochi den&#x27;na.&quot; (&quot;So-so, you know.&quot;)
* -n&#x27;nen (-su + nen), emphasis. e.g. &quot;Chaiman&#x27;nen.&quot; (&quot;It is wrong&quot;)
* -ngana (-su + gana), emphasis. e.g. &quot;Yoroshū tanomimangana.&quot; (&quot;Nice to meet you&quot;)
* -kka (-su + ka), question. e.g. &quot;Mōkarimakka?&quot; (&quot;How&#x27;s business?&quot;)
* -n&#x27;no (-su + no), question. e.g. &quot;Nani yūteman&#x27;no?&quot; (&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;)
* -sse (-su + e, a variety of yo), explain, advise. e.g. &quot;Ee toko oshiemasse!&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;ll show you a nice place!&quot;)
* -ssharo (-su + yaro), surmise, make sure. e.g. &quot;Kyō wa hare dessharo.&quot; (&quot;It may be fine weather today&quot;)

=== Aspect ===
In common Kansai dialect, there are two forms for the continuous and progressive aspects -&quot;teru&quot; and -&quot;toru&quot;; the former is a shortened form of -&quot;te iru&quot; just as does standard Japanese, the latter is a shortened form of -&quot;te oru&quot; which is common to other western Japanese. The proper use between -&quot;teru&quot; and -&quot;toru&quot; is same as &quot;iru&quot; and &quot;oru&quot;.

In the expression to the condition of inanimate objects, -&quot;taru&quot; or -&quot;taaru&quot; form, a shortened form of -&quot;te aru&quot;. In standard Japanese, -&quot;te aru&quot; is only used with transitive verbs, but Kansai -&quot;taru&quot; or -&quot;taaru&quot; is also used with intransitive verbs. One should note that -&quot;te yaru&quot;, &quot;to do for someone,&quot; is also contracted to -&quot;taru&quot; (-&quot;charu&quot; in Senshu and Wakayama), so as not to confuse the two.

Other Western Japanese as Chūgoku and Shikoku dialects has the discrimination of grammatical aspect, -&quot;yoru&quot; in progressive and -&quot;toru&quot; in perfect. In Kansai, some dialects of southern Hyogo and Kii Peninsula have these discrimination, too. In parts of Wakayama, -&quot;yoru&quot; and -&quot;toru&quot; are replaced with -&quot;yaru&quot; and -&quot;taaru/chaaru&quot;.

=== Politeness ===
Historically, extensive use of keigo (honorific speech) was a feature of the Kansai dialect, especially in Kyōto, while the Kantō dialect, from which standard Japanese developed, formerly lacked it. Keigo in standard Japanese was originally borrowed from the medieval Kansai dialect. However, keigo is no longer considered a feature of the dialect since Standard Japanese now also has it. Even today, keigo is used more often in Kansai than in the other dialects except for the standard Japanese, to which people switch in formal situations.

In modern Kansai dialect, -&quot;haru&quot; (sometimes -&quot;yaharu&quot; except &quot;godan&quot; verbs, mainly Kyōto) is used for showing reasonable respect without formality especially in Kyōto. The conjugation before -&quot;haru&quot; has two varieties between Kyōto and Ōsaka (see the table below). In Southern Hyōgo, including Kōbe, &quot;-te ya&quot; is used instead of -&quot;haru&quot;. In formal speech, -&quot;naharu&quot; and -&quot;haru&quot; connect with -&quot;masu&quot; and -&quot;te ya&quot; changes -&quot;te desu&quot;.

-&quot;Haru&quot; was originally a shortened form of -&quot;naharu&quot;, a transformation of -&quot;nasaru&quot;. -&quot;Naharu&quot; has been dying out due to the spread of -&quot;haru&quot; but its imperative form -&quot;nahare&quot; (mainly Ōsaka) or -&quot;nahai&quot; (mainly Kyōto, also -&quot;nai&quot;) and negative imperative form -&quot;nasan&#x27;na&quot; or -&quot;nahan&#x27;na&quot; has comparatively survived because -&quot;haru&quot; lacks an imperative form. In more honorific speech, &quot;o- yasu&quot;, a transformation of &quot;o- asobasu&quot;, is used especially in Kyōto and its original form is same to its imperative form, showing polite invitation or order. &quot;Oide yasu&quot; and &quot;okoshi yasu&quot; (more respectful), meaning &quot;welcome&quot;, are the common phrases of sightseeing areas in Kyōto. -&quot;Te okun nahare&quot; (also -&quot;tokun nahare&quot;, -&quot;toku nahare&quot;) and -&quot;te okure yasu&quot; (also -&quot;tokure yasu&quot;, -&quot;tokuryasu&quot;) are used instead of -&quot;te kudasai&quot; in standard Japanese.

=== Particles ===
There is some difference in the particles between Kansai dialect and standard Japanese. In colloquial Kansai dialect, are often left out especially the accusative case &quot;o&quot; and the quotation particles &quot;to&quot; and &quot;te&quot; (equivalent to &quot;tte&quot; in standard). The ellipsis of &quot;to&quot; and &quot;te&quot; happens only before two verbs: &quot;yū&quot; (to say) and &quot;omou&quot; (to think). For example, &quot;Tanaka-san to yū hito&quot; (&quot;a man called Mr. Tanaka&quot;) can change to &quot;Tanaka-san yū hito&quot;. And &quot;to yū&quot; is sometimes contracted to &quot;chū&quot; or &quot;tchū&quot; instead of &quot;te&quot;, &quot;tsū&quot; or &quot;ttsū&quot; in Tokyo. For example, &quot;nanto yū koto da!&quot; or &quot;nante kotta!&quot; (&quot;My goodness!&quot;) becomes &quot;nanchū kotcha!&quot; in Kansai.

The &quot;na&quot; or &quot;naa&quot; is used very often in Kansai dialect instead of &quot;ne&quot; or &quot;nee&quot; in standard Japanese. In standard Japanese, &quot;naa&quot; is considered rough masculine style in some context, but in Kansai dialect &quot;naa&quot; is used by both men and women in many familiar situations. It is not only used as an interjectory particle (as emphasis for the imperative form, expression and admiration, and address to listeners, for example), and the meaning varies depending on context and voice intonation, so much so that &quot;naa&quot; has been called the world&#x27;s third most difficult word to translate. Besides &quot;naa&quot; and &quot;nee&quot;, &quot;noo&quot; is also used in some areas, but &quot;noo&quot; is usually considered too harsh a masculine particle in modern Keihanshin.

&quot;Kara&quot; and &quot;node&quot;, the meaning &quot;because,&quot; are replaced by &quot;sakai&quot; or &quot;yotte&quot;; &quot;ni&quot; is sometimes added to the end of both, and &quot;sakai&quot; changes to &quot;sake&quot; in some areas. &quot;Sakai&quot; was so famous as the characteristic particle of Kansai dialect that a special saying was made out of it: &quot;. However, in recent years, the standard &quot;kara&quot; and &quot;node&quot; have become dominant.

&quot;Kate&quot; or &quot;katte&quot; is also characteristic particle of Kansai dialect, transformation of &quot;ka tote&quot;. &quot;Kate&quot; has two usages. When &quot;kate&quot; is used with conjugative words, mainly in the past form and the negative form, it is the equivalent of the English &quot;even if&quot; or &quot;even though&quot;, such as &quot;Kaze hiita kate, watashi wa ryokō e iku&quot; (&quot;Even if [I] catch a cold, I will go on the trip&quot;). When &quot;kate&quot; is used with nouns, it means something like &quot;even&quot;, &quot;too,&quot; or &quot;either&quot;, such as &quot;Ore kate shiran&quot; (&quot;I don&#x27;t know, either&quot;), and is similar to the particle &quot;mo&quot; and &quot;datte&quot;.

The used in Kansai differ widely from those used in Tokyo. The most prominent to Tokyo speakers is the heavy use of &quot;wa&quot; by men. In standard Japanese, it is used exclusively by women and so is said to sound softer. In western Japanese including Kansai dialect, however, it is used equally by both men and women in many different levels of conversation. It is noted that the feminine usage of &quot;wa&quot; in Tokyo is pronounced with a rising intonation and the Kansai usage of &quot;wa&quot; is pronounced with a falling intonation.

Another difference in sentence final particles that strikes the ear of the Tokyo speaker is the &quot;nen&quot; particle such as &quot;nande ya nen!&quot;, &quot;you gotta be kidding!&quot; or &quot;why/what the hell?!&quot;, a stereotype tsukkomi phrase in the manzai. It comes from &quot;no ya&quot; (particle &quot;no&quot; + copula &quot;ya&quot;, also &quot;n ya&quot;) and much the same as the standard Japanese &quot;no da&quot; (also &quot;n da&quot;). &quot;Nen&quot; has some variation, such as &quot;neya&quot; (intermediate form between &quot;no ya&quot; and &quot;nen&quot;), &quot;ne&quot; (shortened form), and &quot;nya&quot; (softer form of &quot;neya&quot;). When a copula precedes these particles, &quot;da&quot; + &quot;no da&quot; changes to &quot;na no da&quot; (&quot;na n da&quot;) and &quot;ya&quot; + &quot;no ya&quot; changes to &quot;na no ya&quot; (&quot;na n ya&quot;), but &quot;ya&quot; + &quot;nen&quot; does not change to &quot;na nen&quot;. &quot;No da&quot; is never used with polite form, but &quot;no ya&quot; and &quot;nen&quot; can be used with formal form such as &quot;nande desu nen&quot;, a formal form of &quot;nande ya nen&quot;. In past tense, &quot;nen&quot; changes to &quot;-ten&quot;; for example, &quot;I love you&quot; would be &quot;suki ya nen&quot; or &quot;sukkya nen&quot;, and &quot;I loved you&quot; would be &quot;suki yatten.&quot;

In the interrogative sentence, the use of &quot;nen&quot; and &quot;no ya&quot; is restricted to emphatic questions and involves interrogative words. For simple questions, &quot;(no) ka&quot; is usually used and &quot;ka&quot; is often omitted as well as standard Japanese, but &quot;no&quot; is often changed &quot;n&quot; or &quot;non&quot; (somewhat feminine) in Kansai dialect. In standard Japanese, &quot;kai&quot; is generally used as a masculine variation of &quot;ka&quot;, but in Kansai dialect, &quot;kai&quot; is used as an emotional question and is mainly used for rhetorical question rather than simple question and is often used in the forms as &quot;kaina&quot; (softer) and &quot;kaiya&quot; (harsher). When &quot;kai&quot; follows the negative verb ending -&quot;n&quot;, it means strong imperative sentence. In some areas such as Kawachi and Banshu, &quot;ke&quot; is used instead of &quot;ka&quot;, but it is considered a harsh masculine particle in common Kansai dialect.

The emphatic particle &quot;ze&quot;, heard often from Tokyo men, is rarely heard in Kansai. Instead, the particle &quot;de&quot; is used, arising from the replacement of &quot;z&quot; with &quot;d&quot; in words. However, despite the similarity with &quot;ze&quot;, the Kansai &quot;de&quot; does not carry nearly as heavy or rude a connotation, as it is influenced by the lesser stress on formality and distance in Kansai. In Kyoto, especially feminine speech, &quot;de&quot; is sometimes replaced with &quot;e&quot;. The particle &quot;zo&quot; is also replaced to &quot;do&quot; by some Kansai speakers, but &quot;do&quot; carries a rude masculine impression unlike &quot;de&quot;.

The emphasis or tag question particle &quot;jan ka&quot; in the casual speech of Kanto changes to &quot;yan ka&quot; in Kansai. &quot;Yan ka&quot; has some variations, such as a masculine variation &quot;yan ke&quot; (in some areas, but &quot;yan ke&quot; is also used by women) and a shortened variation &quot;yan&quot;, just like &quot;jan&quot; in Kanto. &quot;Jan ka&quot; and &quot;jan&quot; are used only in informal speech, but &quot;yan ka&quot; and &quot;yan&quot; can be used with formal forms like &quot;sugoi desu yan!&quot; (&quot;It is great!&quot;). Youngsters often use &quot;yan naa&quot;, the combination of &quot;yan&quot; and &quot;naa&quot; for tag question.

== Vocabulary ==

In some cases, Kansai dialect uses entirely different words. The verb &quot;hokasu&quot; corresponds to standard Japanese &quot;suteru&quot; &quot;to throw away&quot;, and &quot;metcha&quot; corresponds to the standard Japanese slang &quot;chō&quot; &quot;very&quot;. &quot;Chō,&quot; in Kansai dialect, means &quot;a little&quot; and is a contracted form of &quot;chotto.&quot; Thus the phrase &quot;chō matte&quot; &quot;wait a minute&quot; by a Kansai person sounds strange to a Tokyo person.

Some Japanese words gain entirely different meanings or are used in different ways when used in Kansai dialect. One such usage is of the word &quot;naosu&quot; (usually used to mean &quot;correct&quot; or &quot;repair&quot; in the standard language) in the sense of &quot;put away&quot; or &quot;put back.&quot; For example, &quot;kono jitensha naoshite&quot; means &quot;please put back this bicycle&quot; in Kansai, but many standard speakers are bewildered since in standard Japanese it would mean &quot;please repair this bicycle&quot;.

Another widely recognized Kansai-specific usage is of &quot;aho&quot;. Basically equivalent to the standard &quot;baka&quot; &quot;idiot, fool&quot;, &quot;aho&quot; is both a term of reproach and a term of endearment to the Kansai speaker, somewhat like English &quot;twit&quot; or &quot;silly&quot;. &quot;Baka&quot;, which is used as &quot;idiot&quot; in most regions, becomes &quot;complete moron&quot; and a stronger insult than &quot;aho&quot;. Where a Tokyo citizen would almost certainly object to being called &quot;baka&quot;, being called &quot;aho&quot; by a Kansai person is not necessarily much of an insult. Being called &quot;baka&quot; by a Kansai speaker is however a much more severe criticism than it would be by a Tokyo speaker. Most Kansai speakers cannot stand being called &quot;baka&quot; but don&#x27;t mind being called &quot;aho&quot;.

=== Well-known words ===
Here are some words and phrases famous as part of the Kansai dialect:

=== Pronouns and honorifics ===

Standard first-person pronouns such as &quot;watashi&quot;, &quot;boku&quot; and &quot;ore&quot; are also generally used in Kansai, but there are some local pronoun words. &quot;Watashi&quot; has many variations: &quot;watai&quot;, &quot;wate&quot; (both gender), &quot;ate&quot; (somewhat feminine), and &quot;wai&quot; (masculine, casual). These variations are now archaic, but are still widely used in fictitious creations to represent stereotypical Kansai speakers especially &quot;wate&quot; and &quot;wai&quot;. Elderly Kansai men frequently use &quot;washi&quot; as well as other western Japan. &quot;Uchi&quot; is famous for the typical feminine first-person pronoun of Kansai dialect and it is still popular among Kansai girls.

In Kansai, &quot;omae&quot; and &quot;anta&quot; are often used for the informal second-person pronoun. &quot;Anata&quot; is hardly used. Traditional local second-person pronouns include &quot;omahan&quot; (&quot;omae&quot; + &quot;-han&quot;), &quot;anta-han&quot; and &quot;ansan&quot; (both are &quot;anta&quot; + &quot;-san&quot;, but &quot;anta-han&quot; is more polite). An archaic first-person pronoun, &quot;ware&quot;, is used as a hostile and impolite second-person pronoun in Kansai. &quot;Jibun&quot; () is a Japanese word meaning &quot;oneself&quot; and sometimes &quot;I&quot;, but it has an additional usage in Kansai as a casual second-person pronoun.

In traditional Kansai dialect, the honorific suffix &quot;-san&quot; is sometimes pronounced -&quot;han&quot; when -&quot;san&quot; follows &quot;a&quot;, &quot;e&quot; and &quot;o&quot;; for example, &quot;okaasan&quot; (&quot;mother&quot;) becomes &quot;okaahan&quot;, and &quot;Satō-san&quot; (&quot;Mr. Satō&quot;) becomes &quot;Satō-han&quot;. It is also the characteristic of Kansai usage of honorific suffixes that they can be used for some familiar inanimate objects as well, especially in Kyoto. In standard Japanese, the usage is usually considered childish, but in Kansai, &quot;o-imo-san&quot;, &quot;o-mame-san&quot; and &quot;ame-chan&quot; are often heard not only in children&#x27;s speech but also in adults&#x27; speech. The suffix &quot;-san&quot; is also added to some familiar greeting phrases; for example, &quot;ohayō-san&quot; (&quot;good morning&quot;) and &quot;omedetō-san&quot; (&quot;congratulations&quot;).

== Regional differences ==

=== Osaka ===
Osaka-ben (大阪弁) is often identified with Kansai dialect by most Japanese, but some of the terms considered to be characteristic of Kansai dialect are actually restricted to Osaka and its environs. Perhaps the most famous is the term &quot;mōkarimakka?&quot;, roughly translated as &quot;how is business?&quot;, and derived from the verb &quot;mōkaru&quot; (儲かる), &quot;to be profitable, to yield a profit&quot;. This is supposedly said as a greeting from one Osakan to another, and the appropriate answer is another Osaka phrase, &quot;maa, bochi bochi denna&quot; &quot;well, so-so, y&#x27;know&quot;.

The idea behind &quot;mōkarimakka&quot; is that Osaka was historically the center of the merchant culture. The phrase developed among low-class shopkeepers and can be used today to greet a business proprietor in a friendly and familiar way but is not a universal greeting. The latter phrase is also specific to Osaka, in particular the term &quot;bochi bochi&quot; (L-L-H-L). This means essentially &quot;so-so&quot;: getting better little by little or not getting any worse. Unlike &quot;mōkarimakka&quot;, &quot;bochi bochi&quot; is used in many situations to indicate gradual improvement or lack of negative change. Also, &quot;bochi bochi&quot; (H-L-L-L) can be used in place of the standard Japanese &quot;soro soro&quot;, for instance &quot;bochi bochi iko ka&quot; &quot;it is about time to be going&quot;.

In the Edo period, Senba-kotoba (船場言葉), a social dialect of the wealthy merchants in the central business district of Osaka, was considered the standard Osaka-ben. It was characterized by the polite speech based on Kyoto-ben and the subtle differences depending on the business type, class, post etc. It was handed down in Meiji, Taishō and Shōwa periods with some changes, but after the Pacific War, Senba-kotoba became nearly an obsolete dialect due to the modernization of business practices. Senba-kotoba was famous for a polite copula &quot;gowasu&quot; or &quot;goasu&quot; instead of common Osakan copula &quot;omasu&quot; and characteristic forms for shopkeeper family mentioned below.





Southern branches of Osaka-ben, such as Senshū-ben (泉州弁) and Kawachi-ben (河内弁), are famous for their harsh locution, characterized by trilled &quot;r&quot;, the question particle &quot;ke&quot;, and the second person &quot;ware&quot;. The farther south in Osaka one goes, the cruder the language is considered to be, with the local Senshū-ben of Kishiwada said to represent the peak of harshness.

=== Kyoto ===

Kyōto-ben (京都弁) or Kyō-kotoba (京言葉) is characterized by development of politeness and indirectness expressions. Kyoto-ben is often regarded as elegant and feminine dialect because of its characters and the image of Gion&#x27;s &quot;geisha&quot; (&quot;geiko-han&quot; and &quot;maiko-han&quot; in Kyoto-ben), the most conspicuous speakers of traditional Kyoto-ben. Kyoto-ben is divided into the court dialect called &quot;Gosho kotoba&quot; (御所言葉) and the citizens dialect called &quot;Machikata kotoba&quot; (町方言葉). The former was spoken by court noble before moving the Emperor to Tokyo, and some phrases inherit at a few monzeki. The latter has subtle difference at each social class such as old merchant families at Nakagyo, craftsmen at Nishijin and geiko at Hanamachi (Gion, Miyagawa-chō etc.)

Kyoto-ben was the &quot;de facto&quot; standard Japanese from 794 until the 18th century and some Kyoto people are still proud of their accent; they get angry when Tokyo people treat Kyoto-ben as a provincial accent. However, traditional Kyoto-ben is gradually declining except in the world of &quot;geisha&quot;, which prizes the inheritance of traditional Kyoto customs. For example, a famous Kyoto copula &quot;dosu&quot;, instead of standard &quot;desu&quot;, is used by a few elders and &quot;geisha&quot; now.

The verb inflection &quot;-haru&quot; is an essential part of casual speech in modern Kyoto. In Osaka and its environs, &quot;-haru&quot; has a certain level of politeness above the base (informal) form of the verb, putting it somewhere between the informal and the more polite &quot;-masu&quot; conjugations. However, in Kyoto, its position is much closer to the informal than it is to the polite mood, owing to its widespread use. Kyoto people, especially elderly women, often use -&quot;haru&quot; for their family and even for animals and weather.

Tango-ben (丹後弁) spoken in northernmost Kyoto Prefecture, is too different to be regarded as Kansai dialect and usually included in Chūgoku dialect. For example, the copula &quot;da&quot;, the Tokyo-type accent, the honorific verb ending -&quot;naru&quot; instead of -&quot;haru&quot; and the peculiarly diphthong such as for &quot;akai&quot; &quot;red&quot;.

=== Hyogo ===

Hyōgo Prefecture is the largest prefecture in Kansai, and there are some different dialects in the prefecture. As mentioned above, Tajima-ben (但馬弁) spoken in northern Hyōgo, former Tajima Province, is included in Chūgoku dialect as well as Tango-ben. Ancient vowel sequence /au/ changed in many Japanese dialects, but in Tajima, Tottori and Izumo dialects, /au/ changed . Accordingly, Kansai word &quot;ahō&quot; &quot;idiot&quot; is pronounced &quot;ahaa&quot; in Tajima-ben.

The dialect spoken in southwestern Hyōgo, former Harima Province alias Banshū, is called Banshū-ben. As well as Chūgoku dialect, it has the discrimination of aspect, &quot;-yoru&quot; in progressive and &quot;-toru&quot; in perfect. Banshū-ben is notable for transformation of &quot;-yoru&quot; and &quot;-toru&quot; into &quot;-yō&quot; and &quot;-tō&quot;, sometimes &quot;-yon&quot; and &quot;-ton&quot;. Another feature is the honorific copula &quot;-te ya&quot;, common in Tanba, Maizuru and San&#x27;yō dialects. In addition, Banshū-ben is famous for an emphatic final particle &quot;doi&quot; or &quot;doiya&quot; and a question particle &quot;ke&quot; or &quot;ko&quot;, but they often sound violent to other Kansai speakers, as well as Kawachi-ben. Kōbe-ben (神戸弁) spoken in Kobe, the largest city of Hyogo, is the intermediate dialect between Banshū-ben and Osaka-ben and is well known for conjugating &quot;-yō&quot; and &quot;-tō&quot; as well as Banshū-ben.

Awaji-ben (淡路弁) spoken in Awaji Island, is different from Banshū/Kōbe-ben and mixed with dialects of Osaka, Wakayama and Tokushima Prefectures due to the intersecting location of sea routes in the Seto Inland Sea and the Tokushima Domain rule in Edo period.

=== Mie ===
The dialect in Mie Prefecture, sometimes called Mie-ben (三重弁), is made up of Ise-ben (伊勢弁) spoken in mid-northern Mie, Shima-ben (志摩弁) spoken in southeastern Mie and Iga-ben (伊賀弁) spoken in western Mie. Ise-ben is famous for a sentence final particle &quot;ni&quot; as well as &quot;de&quot;. Shima-ben is close to Ise-ben, but its vocabulary includes many archaic words. Iga-ben has a unique request expression &quot;-te daako&quot; instead of standard &quot;-te kudasai&quot;.

They use the normal Kansai accent and basic grammar, but some of the vocabulary is common to the Nagoya dialect. For example, instead of -&quot;te haru&quot; (respectful suffix), they have the Nagoya-style -&quot;te mieru&quot;. Conjunctive particles &quot;de&quot; and &quot;monde&quot; &quot;because&quot; is widely used instead of &quot;sakai&quot; and &quot;yotte&quot;. The similarity to Nagoya-ben becomes more pronounced in the northernmost parts of the prefecture; the dialect of Nagashima and Kisosaki, for instance, could be considered far closer to Nagoya-ben than to Ise-ben.

In and around Ise city, some variations on typical Kansai vocabulary can be found, mostly used by older residents. For instance, the typical expression &quot;ōkini&quot; is sometimes pronounced &quot;ōkina&quot; in Ise. Near the Isuzu River and Naikū shrine, some old men use the first-person pronoun &quot;otai&quot;.

=== Wakayama ===
Kishū-ben (紀州弁) or Wakayama-ben (和歌山弁), the dialect in old province Kii Province, present-day Wakayama Prefecture and southern parts of Mie Prefecture, is fairly different from common Kansai dialect and comprises many regional variants. It is famous for heavy confusion of &quot;z&quot; and &quot;d&quot;, especially on the southern coast. The ichidan verb negative form &quot;-n&quot; often changes &quot;-ran&quot; in Wakayama such as &quot;taberan&quot; instead of &quot;taben&quot; (&quot;not eat&quot;); &quot;-hen&quot; also changes &quot;-yan&quot; in Wakayama, Mie and Nara such as &quot;tabeyan&quot; instead of &quot;tabehen&quot;. Wakayama-ben has specific perticles. &quot;Yō&quot; is often used as sentence final particle. &quot;Ra&quot; follows the volitional conjugation of verbs as &quot;iko ra yō!&quot; (&quot;Let&#x27;s go!&quot;). &quot;Noshi&quot; is used as soft sentence final particle. &quot;Yashite&quot; is used as tag question. Local words are &quot;akana&quot; instead of &quot;akan&quot;, &quot;omoshai&quot; instead of &quot;omoroi&quot;, &quot;aga&quot; &quot;oneself&quot;, &quot;teki&quot; &quot;you&quot;, &quot;tsuremote&quot; &quot;together&quot; and so on. Wakayama people hardly ever use keigo, which is rather unusual for dialects in Kansai.

=== Shiga ===
Shiga Prefecture is the eastern neighbor of Kyoto, so its dialect, sometimes called Shiga-ben (滋賀弁) or Ōmi-ben (近江弁) or Gōshū-ben (江州弁), is similar in many ways to Kyoto-ben. For example, Shiga people also frequently use &quot;-haru&quot;, though some people tend to pronounce &quot;-aru&quot; and &quot;-te yaaru&quot; instead of &quot;-haru&quot; and &quot;-te yaharu&quot;. Some elderly Shiga people also use &quot;-raru&quot; as a casual honorific form. The demonstrative pronoun &quot;so-&quot; often changes to &quot;ho-&quot;; for example, &quot;so ya&quot; becomes &quot;ho ya&quot; and &quot;sore&quot; (that) becomes &quot;hore&quot;. In Nagahama, people use the friendly-sounding auxiliary verb &quot;-ansu&quot; and &quot;-te yansu&quot;. Nagahama and Hikone dialects has a unique final particle &quot;hon&quot; as well as &quot;de&quot;.

=== Nara ===
The dialect in Nara Prefecture is divided into northern including Nara city and southern including Totsukawa. The northern dialect, sometimes called Nara-ben (奈良弁) or Yamato-ben (大和弁), has a few particularities such as an interjectory particle &quot;mii&quot; as well as &quot;naa&quot;, but the similarity with Osaka-ben increases year by year because of the economic dependency to Osaka. On the other hand, southern Nara prefecture is a language island because of its geographic isolation with mountains. The southern dialect uses Tokyo type accent, has the discrimination of grammatical aspect, and does not show a tendency to lengthen vowels at the end of monomoraic nouns.

<doc id="180074" wikidata="Q431640" url="?curid=180074" title="Teppanyaki">
<text>, often called in the United States and Canada, is a post-World War II style of Japanese cuisine that uses an iron griddle to cook food. The word &quot;teppanyaki&quot; is derived from &quot;teppan&quot; (), the metal plate on which it is cooked, and &quot;yaki&quot; (), which means grilled, broiled, or pan-fried. In Japan, teppanyaki refers to dishes cooked using a teppan, including steak, shrimp, &quot;okonomiyaki&quot;, &quot;yakisoba,&quot; and &quot;monjayaki&quot;.

Teppan are typically propane-heated, flat-surfaced, and are widely used to cook food in front of guests at restaurants. They are commonly confused with the &quot;hibachi&quot; barbecue grill, which is called shichirin in Japanese, and has a charcoal or gas flame and is made with an open grate design. With a solid griddle-type cook surface, the &quot;teppan&quot; is capable of cooking small or semisolid ingredients such as rice, egg and finely chopped vegetables.

==Origin==
The originator of the &quot;teppanyaki&quot;-style steakhouse is believed to be Shigeji Fujioka of the Japanese restaurant chain Misono. The restaurant claims to be the first to introduce the concept of cooking Western-influenced food on a &quot;teppan&quot; in Japan, in 1945. They soon found the cuisine was less popular with the Japanese than it was with foreigners, who enjoyed both watching the skilled maneuvers of the chefs preparing the food and the cuisine itself, which is somewhat more familiar than more traditional Japanese dishes. As the restaurants became more popular with tourists, the chain increased the performance aspect of the chef&#x27;s preparation, such as stacking onion slices to produce a flaming onion volcano.

Another piece of equipment in the same family is a flattop grill, consisting of a flat piece of steel over circular burners and typically smaller and round, like a Mongolian barbecue.

==Ingredients==
Typical ingredients used for Western-style &quot;teppanyaki&quot; are beef, shrimp, scallops, lobster, chicken and assorted vegetables. Soybean oil is typically used to cook the ingredients.

Japanese-style &quot;teppanyaki&quot; may also use noodles (&quot;yakisoba&quot;) or cabbage with sliced meat or seafood (&quot;okonomiyaki&quot;), which are cooked using vegetable oil, animal fat, or a mixture. In Japan, many &quot;teppanyaki&quot; restaurants feature Kobe beef or Wagyu beef.

Side dishes of mung bean sprouts, zucchini (courgettes) (though this is not a popular vegetable in Japan and rarely found in that market), garlic chips (crisps), or fried rice usually accompany the meal. Some restaurants provide sauces in which to dip the food. In Japan, only soy sauce is typically offered.

==In the United States==

In the United States, &quot;teppanyaki&quot; (more commonly known as &quot;hibachi&quot;) was made famous by the Benihana restaurant chain, which opened its first restaurant in New York City in 1964. Benihana and other chains of &quot;teppanyaki&quot; restaurants continue to place an emphasis on the chef performing a show for the diners and continuing to introduce new variations and tricks. The chef might juggle utensils, flip a shrimp tail into their shirt pocket, catch an egg in their hat, toss an egg up in the air and split it with a spatula, or flip flattened shrimp pieces into diners&#x27; mouths.

<text>is a ball-shaped Japanese snack made of a wheat flour-based batter and cooked in a special molded pan. It is typically filled with minced or diced octopus (&quot;tako&quot;), tempura scraps (&quot;tenkasu&quot;), pickled ginger (&quot;beni shoga&quot;), and green onion (&quot;negi&quot;). The balls are brushed with takoyaki sauce (similar to Worcestershire sauce) and mayonnaise, and then sprinkled with green laver (&quot;aonori&quot;) and shavings of dried bonito (&quot;katsuobushi&quot;).

&quot;Yaki&quot; comes from , which is one of the cooking methods in Japanese cuisine, meaning &#x27;to grill&#x27;, and can be found in the names of other dishes in Japanese cuisine such as &quot;okonomiyaki&quot; and &quot;ikayaki&quot; (other famous Osakan dishes). Typically, it is eaten as a snack or between meals, but in some areas it is served as a side dish with rice. It is an example of ( in the Kansai dialect), or flour-based Japanese cuisine.

Takoyaki was first popularized in Osaka, where a street vendor named Tomekichi Endo is credited with its invention in 1935. In the early 20th century, in Osaka, there were snacks called and that contained pieces of beef, konjac or other ingredients. Meanwhile, in Akashi in Hyōgo Prefecture, there was a snack made of an egg-rich batter and octopus, later named . Endo combined them and began selling it under the name takoyaki. It spread throughout Osaka, with various stalls making improvements, and after the Pacific War, the style of eating takoyaki with sauce and mayonnaise was established. Endo&#x27;s takoyaki shop, named &quot;Aizuya&quot; after his hometown, still exists today and serves the original takoyaki without sauce or mayonnaise.

Takoyaki was initially popular in the Kansai region, and later spread to the Kantō region and other areas of Japan. Takoyaki is associated with &quot;yatai&quot; street food stalls, and there are many well-established takoyaki specialty restaurants, particularly in the Kansai region. Takoyaki is now sold at commercial outlets, such as supermarkets and 24-hour convenience stores.

It is also very popular in Taiwanese cuisine due to the historical influence of Japanese culture. In recent years, takoyaki can be eaten with various toppings and fillings (such as cheese or bacon) as its cultural span has evolved in western parts of the world. The food, known as &quot;octopus balls&quot;, quickly became popular throughout Japan.

==Takoyaki pan==
A or—much more rarely—takoyaki is typically a griddle made of cast iron with molds, similar to a traditional Yorkshire pudding tray. The heavy iron evenly heats the takoyaki, which are turned with a pick during the heating process to pull the uncooked batter to the base of the rounded cavity. Commercial gas-fueled takoyaki cookers are used at Japanese festivals or by street vendors. For home use, electric versions resemble a hotplate; stovetop versions are also available, and many incorporate a non-stick coating to facilitate turning.

==In popular culture==
Takoyaki is the favorite food of Taruruto, the title character of the 1988 manga series &quot;Magical Taruruto&quot;. The food plays a major role in several episodes of the anime and a single tie-in film, and also serves as the many collectibles and potential platforms in several tie-in video games.

A children&#x27;s book named &quot;Takoyaki Mantoman&quot;, published in the 1990s and later adapted into an anime television series produced by Studio Pierrot that aired from April 1998 to September 1999, focuses on a group of takoyaki fighting crime.

In the &quot;Animal Crossing&quot; series of video games, there is a villager named Zucker, based on takoyaki. He is an octopus with a round head resembling takoyaki, he generally wears a yukata, and his home is inspired by a traditional Japanese summer festival.

<text>Karl Guthe Jansky (October 22, 1905 – February 14, 1950) was an American physicist and radio engineer who in April 1933 first announced his discovery of radio waves emanating from the Milky Way in the constellation Sagittarius. He is considered one of the founding figures of radio astronomy.

== Early life ==

Karl Guthe Jansky was born 1905 in what was then the Territory of Oklahoma where his father, Cyril M. Jansky, was dean of the college of engineering at the University of Oklahoma at Norman. Cyril M. Jansky, born in Wisconsin of Czech immigrants, had started teaching at the age of sixteen. He was a teacher throughout his active life, retiring as professor of electrical engineering at the University of Wisconsin. He was an engineer with a strong interest in physics, a trait passed on to his sons. Karl Jansky was named after Dr. Karl Eugen Guthe, a professor of physics at the University of Michigan who had been an important mentor to Cyril M. Jansky.

Karl Jansky&#x27;s mother, born Nellie Moreau, was of French and English descent. Karl&#x27;s brother Cyril Jansky Jr., who was ten years older, helped build some of the earliest radio transmitters in the country, including 9XM in Wisconsin (now WHA of Wisconsin Public Radio) and 9XI in Minnesota (now KUOM).

Karl Jansky attended college at the University of Wisconsin, where he received his BS in physics in 1927. He stayed an extra year at Madison, completing all the graduate course work for a master&#x27;s degree in physics except for the thesis. In July 1928 at age 22, he was able to join the Bell Telephone Laboratories, and because of a kidney condition he had since college (which eventually led to his early death), he was sent to the healthier environs of the field station in Holmdel, New Jersey. Bell Labs wanted to investigate atmospheric and ionospheric properties using &quot;short waves&quot; (wavelengths of about 10–20 meters) for use in trans-Atlantic radio telephone service. As a radio engineer, Jansky was assigned the job of investigating sources of static that might interfere with radio voice transmissions.

== Radio astronomy ==
At Bell Telephone Laboratories, Jansky built a directional antenna designed to receive radio waves at a frequency of 20.5 MHz (wavelength about 14.6 meters). It had a diameter of approximately 100 ft. (30 meters) and stood 20 ft. (6 meters) tall. It was mounted on top of a turntable on a set of four Ford Model-T wheels, which allowed it to be rotated in the azimuthal direction, earning it the nickname &quot;Jansky&#x27;s merry-go-round&quot; (the cost of which was later estimated to be less than $1000). By rotating the antenna, the direction of a received signal could be pinpointed. The intensity of the signal was recorded by an analog pen-and-paper recording system housed in a small shed to the side of the antenna.

After recording signals from all directions for several months, Jansky eventually categorized them into three types of static: nearby thunderstorms, distant thunderstorms, and a faint static or &quot;hiss&quot; of unknown origin. He spent over a year investigating the source of the third type of static. The location of maximum intensity rose and fell once a day, leading Jansky to surmise initially that he was detecting radiation from the Sun.

After a few months of following the signal, however, the point of maximum static moved away from the position of the Sun. Jansky also determined that the signal repeated on a cycle of 23 hours and 56 minutes. Jansky discussed the puzzling phenomena with his friend the astrophysicist Albert Melvin Skellett, who pointed out that the observed time between the signal peaks was the exact length of a sidereal day; the time it took for &quot;fixed&quot; astronomical objects, such as a star, to pass in front of the antenna every time the Earth rotated. By comparing his observations with optical astronomical maps, Jansky concluded that the radiation was coming from the Milky Way and was strongest (7:10 p.m. on September 16, 1932) in the direction of the center of the galaxy, in the constellation of Sagittarius.

Jansky announced his discovery at a meeting in Washington D.C. in April 1933 to a small audience who could not comprehend its significance. His discovery was widely publicized, appearing in the &quot;New York Times&quot; of May 5, 1933, and he was interviewed on a special NBC program on &quot;Radio sounds from among the stars&quot;. In October 1933, his discovery was published in a journal article entitled &quot;Electrical disturbances apparently of extraterrestrial origin&quot; in the &quot;Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers&quot;.

If the radio sources were from the stars, the Sun should also be producing radio noise, but Jansky found that it did not. In the early 1930s, the Sun was at an inactive phase in its sunspot cycle. In 1935 Jansky made the suggestion that the strange radio signals were produced from interstellar gas, in particular, by &quot;thermal agitation of charged particles.&quot; Jansky accomplished these investigations while still in his twenties with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in physics.

Jansky wanted to further investigate the Milky Way radio waves after 1935 (he called the radiation &quot;Star Noise&quot; in the thesis he submitted to earn his 1936 University of Wisconsin Masters degree), but he found little support from either astronomers, for whom it was completely foreign, or Bell Labs, which could not justify, during the Great Depression, the cost of research on a phenomenon that did not significantly affect trans-Atlantic communications systems.

== Follow-up ==
Several scientists were interested in Jansky&#x27;s discovery, but radio astronomy remained a dormant field for several years, due in part to Jansky&#x27;s lack of formal training as an astronomer. His discovery had come in the midst of the Great Depression, and observatories were wary of taking on any new and potentially risky projects.

Two men who learned of Jansky&#x27;s 1933 discovery were of great influence on the later development of the new study of radio astronomy: one was Grote Reber, a radio engineer who singlehandedly built a radio telescope in his Illinois back yard in 1937 and did the first systematic survey of astronomical radio waves. The second was John D. Kraus, who, after World War II, started a radio observatory at Ohio State University and wrote a textbook on radio astronomy, long considered a standard by radio astronomers.

== Death and legacy ==


Jansky was a resident of Little Silver, New Jersey, and died at age 44 in a Red Bank, New Jersey, hospital (now called Riverview Medical Center) due to a heart condition.

In honor of Jansky, the unit used by radio astronomers for the spectral irradiance of radio sources is the jansky (1 Jy = 10−26 W⋅m−2⋅Hz−1). The crater Jansky on the Moon is also named after him. The National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) postdoctoral fellowship program is named after Karl Jansky. NRAO awards the Jansky Prize annually in Jansky&#x27;s honor. On March 31, 2012, the NRAO renamed the Very Large Array (VLA) radio telescope in Magdalena, New Mexico, as the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array in honor of Jansky&#x27;s contribution to radio astronomy.

A full-scale replica of Jansky&#x27;s original rotating telescope is located on the grounds of the Green Bank Observatory (, formerly an NRAO site) in Green Bank, West Virginia, near a reconstructed version of Grote Reber&#x27;s 9-meter dish.

In 1998, the original site of Jansky&#x27;s antenna at what is now the Bell Labs Holmdel Complex at 101 Crawfords Corner Road, Holmdel, New Jersey, was determined by Tony Tyson and Robert Wilson of Lucent Technologies (the successor of Bell Telephone Laboratories) and a monument and a plaque were placed there to honor the achievement. The monument is a stylized sculpture of the antenna and is oriented as Jansky&#x27;s antenna was at 7:10 p.m. on September 16, 1932, at a moment of maximum signal caused by alignment with the center of our galaxy in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius.

&quot;Jansky noise&quot; is named after Jansky, and refers to high frequency static disturbances of cosmic origin, cosmic noise.

Asteroid 1932 Jansky is named after him, as is the lunar crater Jansky.

<text>The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) is the organisation that represents the interests of the recording industry worldwide. It is a non-profit members&#x27; organisation registered in Switzerland and founded in Italy in 1933 by Francesco Braga. It operates a secretariat based in London, with regional offices in Brussels, Hong Kong, Miami, Abu Dhabi, Singapore and Nairobi.

==Function==
IFPI&#x27;s mission is to promote the value of recorded music, campaign for record producer rights, and expand the commercial uses of recorded music. Its services to members include a legal policy programme, litigation, content protection, sales reporting for the recorded music market, insight and analysis and work in the areas of performance rights, technology and trade.

==Structure==
IFPI is governed by its Main Board, a group including representatives from across the organisation&#x27;s members (including major and independent record labels), representatives from certain IFPI National Groups and the organisation&#x27;s CEO. There are also two regional boards (the IFPI Asia/Pacific Regional Board and IFPI Latin America Regional Board) which oversee regional matters.

In April 2024 IFPI announced that Victoria Oakley had been appointed as CEO, joining the organisation in June 2024. The previous CEO, Frances Moore, stepped down in December 2023. She had been appointed the chief executive with a term effective from 1 July 2010. She had replaced John Kennedy, who had headed the organisation since 2005 and was also one of the co-producers of Live Aid and Live8. Moore was awarded an MBE in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours List in 2021 for her services to the music industry.

==Scope of influence==
IFPI represents the recording industry worldwide; there are some 8,000 members across IFPI and its global network, operating in over 70 markets and some 70 local industry associations, affiliated music licensing companies and IFPI offices. According to its criteria, IFPI membership is open to &quot;a legal entity or person which is either a producer of phonograms or music videos, copies of which are made available to the public in reasonable quantities&quot;, though the organisation does not define &quot;reasonable quantities&quot;.

National groups and affiliate bodies include SNEP in France; BVMI in Germany; RIAJ in Japan; BPI in the UK; RIAA in the US; ARIA in Australia; Music Canada; AMPROFON in Mexico; Recorded Music New Zealand; Promusicae in Spain; FIMI in Italy and others. Record labels can be members of both their local industry body and IFPI.

==History==
Members of the international phonographic industry formed IFPI at the industry&#x27;s first international congress in Rome, Italy, held from 10 to 14 November 1933. IFPI described its mission as representing &quot;the interests of the recording industry worldwide in all fora&quot; by promoting legislation and copyrights and &quot;to protect the largely British-based recording industry&quot; by promoting a global performance right in gramophone sound recordings.

===Phonogram copyrights established===
The IFPI lobbied at the Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations of 1961, which established an international standard for the protection of sound recordings, live performances and broadcasts. This convention was opposed by trade groups representing authors and composers, who were concerned that establishing such &quot;neighbouring rights&quot; would undermine their own control over how their works were used and would result in prohibitively expensive licensing. Pressure from United States–based broadcasters who did not want to license the records they broadcast, among other factors, kept the United States from signing the convention; the United States would not recognise a separate sound recording copyright until 1971.

===Phonogram copy protection efforts===
In an effort to combat copyright violation, in 1971, the IFPI advocated for the Convention for the Protection of Producers of Phonograms Against Unauthorized Duplication of Their Phonograms (the Geneva Phonograms Convention), which 72 countries signed.

In 1986, the ISO established the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) standard, ISO 3901. In 1989, the IFPI was designated the registration authority for ISRC codes. ISRC codes &quot;enable the use of copyright protected recordings and works to be controlled; facilitate the distribution and collection of royalties (performances, private copying); and assist in the fight against piracy&quot;.

To further combat infringement of recorded works, the IFPI and the compact disc manufacturing industry introduced Source Identification (SID) codes in 1994. The SID codes are markings on optical discs such as compact discs (CD) and digital versatile discs (DVD) that identify the manufacturer, equipment, and master discs used to create each disc. There are two codes: the SID mastering code and the SID mould code. The SID mastering code identifies the manufacturing facility used to produce a master from which moulds are produced. The SID mould code identifies the plant where the disc was moulded (replicated). Since not all optical disc manufacturing facilities have the ability to both produce master discs and replicate discs, the SID mastering code and SID mould code on a given optical disc may or may not represent the same manufacturing facility.

SID codes follow a standard format consisting of the letters &quot;IFPI&quot; followed by four or five hexadecimal digits. A number prefaced with &quot;L&quot; is a &quot;mastering code&quot;, a serial number taken from a pool assigned by Philips to the manufacturer. The mastering code identifies the Laser Beam Recorder (LBR) signal processor or mould that produced a particular stamper or a glass master disc from which moulds are produced. Non-&quot;L&quot; numbers are &quot;mould codes&quot;, which identify the manufacturer that replicated the disc. Phillips assigns the first 2 or 3 digits of the mould code and the remaining digits are a serial number assigned by that plant to its moulds.

===Pirate Bay incidents===
In mid-October 2007, after IFPI let the ifpi.com domain registration lapse, ownership of the ifpi.com domain was transferred to The Pirate Bay, a group which claimed it received the domain from an anonymous donor. The group set up a Website under the domain titled &quot;International Federation of Pirates Interests&quot;, a replacement backronym for IFPI. Ownership of the domain was returned to IFPI in late November, when a WIPO arbitration panel concluded that &quot;the Disputed Domain Name is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark in which the [IFPI] has rights&quot; and that the Pirate Bay&#x27;s representative &quot;registered and [was] using the Disputed Domain Name in bad faith&quot; and failed to adequately rebut IFPI&#x27;s contention that he &quot;has no rights or a legitimate interest in the Disputed Domain Name&quot;. The organisation&#x27;s website www.ifpi.org was unaffected during the dispute.

==Certifications and awards==
IFPI publishes six annual top-ten charts: the IPFI Global Recording Artist Chart, IFPI Global Single Chart, IFPI Global Album Chart, IFPI Global Album Sales Chart, the IFPI Global Vinyl Album Chart and (from 2023) the IFPI Global Streaming Album Chart.

Launched in January 2014, the IFPI Global Recording Artist Chart (sometimes called just the IFPI Global Artist Chart) was the first global chart to accurately capture the popularity of artists across streaming channels, alongside digital and physical album and singles sales. The independently verified chart includes sales of albums across digital, CD and vinyl formats; singles, both downloaded and physical; and streams across the calendar year. The chart includes all the music of each artist featured, not just one track or album. It uses album equivalent units to combine measurements of downloads, physical sales and streams.

The Top 10 Global Artist Chart is published each year, with the number-one artist being presented with a physical award, as the Global Recording Artist of the Year. The winners have been: One Direction in 2013, Taylor Swift in 2014, Adele in 2015, Drake in 2016, Ed Sheeran in 2017, Drake in 2018, Taylor Swift in 2019, BTS in 2020 and 2021, and Taylor Swift in 2022, 2023 and 2024.

IFPI also publishes a list of the top 10 best-performing global singles and albums each year. The most recent winners, for 2023, were Miley Cyrus&#x27; &quot;Flowers&quot; and Seventeen&#x27;s &quot;FML&quot; respectively. In March 2022 IFPI launched the first Global Vinyl Album Chart (most recently topped by Taylor Swift&#x27;s &#x27;1989 (Taylor&#x27;s Version)&#x27;, announced in March 2024) and in March 2023 they introduced the IFPI Global Streaming Album Chart; Morgan Wallen&#x27;s &#x27;One Thing At A Time&#x27; most recently took the top spot in that chart. The latest IFPI Global Album Sales Chart saw Seventeen at No. 1 with &#x27;FML&#x27;, with the K-Pop band having also reached No. 1 on the overall Global Album Chart for 2023 with the same album.

Formerly, IFPI ran certifications called the IFPI Platinum Europe Awards and the IFPI Middle East Awards. The IFPI Platinum Europe Awards were founded in 1996. They are awarded for actual retail sales (as opposed to shipments) of one million albums, in one of the following countries: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and United Kingdom. The IFPI Middle East Awards were established in October 2009. They were awarded for sales in either Lebanon or the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, namely Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. In the Gulf Cooperation Council, gold certification was awarded for sales of 3,000 units and platinum for sales of 6,000 units. In Lebanon, gold certification was awarded for sales of 1,000 units and platinum for sales of 2,000 units.

<doc id="180090" wikidata="Q1434381" url="?curid=180090" title="Jansky">
<text>The jansky (symbol Jy, plural &quot;janskys&quot;) is a non-SI unit of spectral flux density, or spectral irradiance, used especially in radio astronomy. It is equivalent to 10−26 watts per square metre per hertz.

The &quot;spectral flux density&quot; or &quot;monochromatic flux&quot;, , of a source is the integral of the spectral radiance, , over the source solid angle:
formula_1

The unit is named after pioneering US radio astronomer Karl Guthe Jansky and is defined as
{\cdot}\mathrm{Hz^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt; (SI)
| 2 = formula_2 (CGS).
Since the jansky is obtained by integrating over the whole source solid angle, it is most simply used to describe point sources; for example, the Third Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources (3C) reports results in janskys.
* For extended sources, the surface brightness is often described with units of janskys per solid angle; for example, far-infrared (FIR) maps from the IRAS satellite are in megajanskys per steradian (MJy⋅sr−1).
* Although extended sources at all wavelengths can be reported with these units, for radio-frequency maps, extended sources have traditionally been described in terms of a brightness temperature; for example the Haslam et al. 408 MHz all-sky continuum survey is reported in terms of a brightness temperature in kelvin.

== Unit conversions ==
Jansky units are not a standard SI unit, so it may be necessary to convert the measurements made in the unit to the SI equivalent in terms of watts per square metre per hertz (W·m−2·Hz−1). However, other unit conversions are possible with respect to measuring this unit.

=== AB magnitude ===
The flux density in janskys can be converted to a magnitude basis, for suitable assumptions about the spectrum. For instance, converting an AB magnitude to a flux density in microjanskys is straightforward:
formula_3

=== dBW·m−2·Hz−1 ===

The linear flux density in janskys can be converted to a decibel basis, suitable for use in fields of telecommunication and radio engineering.

1 jansky is equal to −260 dBW·m−2·Hz−1, or −230 dBm·m−2·Hz−1:
formula_4

=== Temperature units ===

The spectral radiance in janskys per steradian can be converted to a brightness temperature, useful in radio and microwave astronomy. 

Starting with Planck&#x27;s law, we see
formula_5
This can be solved for temperature, giving
formula_6
In the low-frequency, high-temperature regime, when formula_7, we can use the asymptotic expression:
formula_8

A less accurate form is
formula_9
which can be derived from the Rayleigh–Jeans law
formula_10

== Usage ==
The flux to which the jansky refers can be in any form of radiant energy.

It was created for and is still most frequently used in reference to electromagnetic energy, especially in the context of radio astronomy.

The brightest astronomical radio sources have flux densities of the order of 1–100 janskys. For example, the Third Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources lists some 300 to 400 radio sources in the Northern Hemisphere brighter than 9 Jy at 159 MHz. This range makes the jansky a suitable unit for radio astronomy.

Gravitational waves also carry energy, so their flux density can also be expressed in terms of janskys. Typical signals on Earth are expected to be 1020 Jy or more. However, because of the poor coupling of gravitational waves to matter, such signals are difficult to detect.

When measuring broadband continuum emissions, where the energy is roughly evenly distributed across the detector bandwidth, the detected signal will increase in proportion to the bandwidth of the detector (as opposed to signals with bandwidth narrower than the detector bandpass). To calculate the flux density in janskys, the total power detected (in watts) is divided by the receiver collecting area (in square meters), and then divided by the detector bandwidth (in hertz). The flux density of astronomical sources is many orders of magnitude below 1 W·m−2·Hz−1, so the result is multiplied by 1026 to get a more appropriate unit for natural astrophysical phenomena.

The millijansky, mJy, was sometimes referred to as a milli-flux unit (mfu) in older astronomical literature.

<doc id="180091" wikidata="Q190996" url="?curid=180091" title="Pediment">
<text>Pediments are a form of gable in classical architecture, usually of a triangular shape. Pediments are placed above the horizontal structure of the cornice (an elaborated lintel), or entablature if supported by columns. In ancient architecture, a wide and low triangular pediment (the side angles 12.5° to 16°) typically formed the top element of the portico of a Greek temple, a style continued in Roman temples. But large pediments were rare on other types of building before Renaissance architecture. For symmetric designs, it provides a center point and is often used to add grandness to entrances.
The cornice continues round the top of the pediment, as well as below it; the rising sides are often called the &quot;raking cornice&quot;. The tympanum is the triangular area within the pediment, which is often decorated with a pedimental sculpture which may be freestanding or a relief sculpture. The tympanum may hold an inscription, or in modern times, a clock face.

The main variant shapes are the &quot;segmental&quot;, &quot;curved&quot;, or &quot;arch&quot; pediment, where the straight line triangle of the cornice is replaced by a curve making a segment of a circle, the broken pediment where the cornice has a gap at the apex, and the open pediment, with a gap in the cornice along the base. Both triangular and segmental pediments can have &quot;broken&quot; and &quot;open&quot; forms. 

Pediments are found in ancient Greek architecture as early as 580 BC, in the archaic Temple of Artemis, Corfu, which was probably one of the first. Pediments return in Renaissance architecture and are then much used in later styles such as Baroque, Neoclassical, and Beaux-Arts architecture, which favoured the segmental variant. 

==Variant forms==

A variant is the &quot;segmental&quot; or &quot;arch&quot; pediment, where the normal angular slopes of the cornice are replaced by one in the form of a segment of a circle, in the manner of a depressed arch. Both traditional and segmental pediments have &quot;broken&quot; and &quot;open&quot; forms. In the broken pediment the raking cornice is left open at the apex. The open pediment is open along the base, with a gap in the cornice for part or all of the space under the pediment. 

All these forms were used in Hellenistic architecture, especially in Alexandria and the Middle East. The so-called &quot;Treasury&quot; or Al-Khazneh, a 1st-century rock-cut tomb in Petra, Jordan, is a famously extreme example, with not merely the pediment, but the whole entablature, very &quot;broken&quot; and retreating into the cliff face. Broken pediments where the gap is extremely wide in this way are often called &quot;half-pediments&quot;.

They were adopted in Mannerist architecture, and applied to furniture designed by Thomas Chippendale. Another variant is the swan&#x27;s neck pediment, a broken pediment with two S-shaped profiles resembling a swan&#x27;s neck, typically volutes; this is mostly found in furniture rather than buildings. It was popular in American doorways from the 1760s onwards. Very often there is a vase-like ornament in the middle, between the volutes. Non-triangular variations of pediments are often found over doors, windows, niches, and porches.

== History ==

===Classical===
The pediment is found in classical Greek temples, Etruscan, Roman, Renaissance, Baroque, Rococo, Neoclassical, and Beaux-Arts architecture. Greek temples, normally rectangular in plan, generally had a pediment at each end, but Roman temples, and subsequent revivals, often had only one, in both cases across the whole width of the main front or facade. The rear of the typical Roman temple was a blank wall, usually without columns, but often a full pediment above. This effectively divorced the pediment from the columns beneath it in the original temple front ensemble, and thereafter it was no longer considered necessary for a pediment to be above columns. 

The most famous example of the Greek scheme is the Parthenon, with two tympanums filled with large groups of sculpted figures. An extreme but very influential example of the Roman style is the Pantheon, Rome, where a portico with pediment fronts a circular temple.
In ancient Rome, the Renaissance, and later architectural revivals, small pediments are a non-structural element over windows, doors, and aediculae, protecting windows and openings from rain, as well as being decorative. From the 5th century pediments also might appear on tombs and later non-architectural objects such as sarcophagi.

In the Hellenistic period pediments became used for a wider range of buildings, and treated much more freely, especially outside Greece itself. Broken and open pediments are used in a way that is often described as &quot;baroque&quot;. The large 2nd-century Market Gate of Miletus, now reconstructed in the Pergamon Museum in Berlin, has a pediment that retreats in the centre, so appears both broken and open, a feature also seen at the Al-Khazneh (so-called &quot;Treasury&quot;) tomb at Petra in modern Jordan. The broken pediments on each of the four sides of the Arch of Septimius Severus at Leptis Magna in Libya are very small elements, raking at an extremely steep angle, but not extending beyond the entablature for the columns below. There are two faces to each pediment, both carved, with one lying parallel to the wall of the monument, and the other at right angles to that.

The Arch of Augustus in Rimini, Italy (27 BC), an early imperial monument, suggests that at this stage provincial Roman architects were not well practiced in the classical vocabulary; the base of the pediment ends close to, but not over, the capitals of the columns. Here the whole temple front is decoration applied to a very solid wall, but the lack of respect for the conventions of Greek trabeated architecture remains rather disconcerting. 

Conventional Roman pediments have a slightly steeper pitch than classical Greek ones, perhaps because they ended tiled roofs that received heavier rainfall.

===Medieval===
In Carolingian and Romanesque architecture pediments tended towards the equilateral triangle, and the enclosing cornice has little emphasis; they are often merely gable ends with some ornament. In Gothic architecture pediments with a much more acute angle at the top were used, especially over doorways and windows, but while the rising sides of the cornice is elaborate, the horizontal bottom element was typically not very distinct. Often there is a pointed arch underneath, and no bottom element at all. &quot;Pediment&quot; is typically not used for these; they are often called a &quot;canopy&quot;. From the Renaissance onwards, some pediments no longer fitted the steeply pitched roofs and became freestanding, sometimes sloping in the opposite direction to the roof behind.

===Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo=== 

When classical-style low triangular pediments returned in Italian Renaissance architecture, they were initially mostly used to top a relatively flat facade, with engaged elements rather than freestanding porticos supported by columns. Leon Battista Alberti used them in this way in his churches: the Tempio Malatestiano (1450s, incomplete), Santa Maria Novella (to 1470), San Sebastiano in Mantua (unfinished by the 1470s), Sant&#x27;Andrea, Mantua (begun 1472), and Pienza Cathedral ), where the design was probably his. Here the cornice comes out and then retreats back, forming the top of pilasters with no capitals, a very unclassical note, which was to become much used. 

In most of these, Alberti followed classical precedent by having the pediment occupy the whole width of the facade, or at least that part that projects outwards. Santa Maria Novella and Sant&#x27;Agostino, Rome (1483, by Giacomo di Pietrasanta, perhaps designed by Alberti) were early examples of what was to become a very common scheme, where the pediment at the top of the facade was much less wide, forming a third zone above a middle zone that transitioned the width from that of the bottom. The giant curving volute or scroll used at the sides of the middle zone at Sant&#x27;Agostino was to be a very common feature over the next two centuries. As in Gothic architecture, this often reflected the shapes of the roofs behind, where the nave was higher than the side-aisles. 

Sant&#x27;Agostino also has a low, squashed down pediment at the top of the full-width section. This theme was developed by Andrea Palladio in the next century. The main facade of his San Giorgio Maggiore in Venice (begun 1566) has &quot;two interpenetrating temple fronts&quot;, a wider one being overlaid with a narrower and higher one, respectively following the roof lines of the aisles and nave. Several of Palladio&#x27;s villas also introduced the pediment to country house architecture, which was to be become extremely common in English Palladian architecture. In cities, Palladio reserved the temple front for churches, but in the Baroque, and especially outside Italy, this distinction was abandoned.

The first use of pediments over windows in the Renaissance was on the Palazzo Bartolini Salimbeni in Florence, completed in 1523 by Baccio d&#x27;Agnolo. Vasari says the innovation caused ridicule initially, but later came to be admired and widely adopted. Baccio was accused of turning a &quot;palazzo&quot; into a church. Three windows on each of three storeys (and the door) alternate regular and segmental pediments; there is no pediment at the top of the facade, just a large cornice, as was usual. 
In St Peter&#x27;s Basilica there is a conventional pediment over the main entrance, but the complicated facade stretches beyond it to both sides and above, and though large in absolute terms it makes a relatively small impression. Many later buildings used a temple front with pediment as a highlight of a much wider building. The St Peter&#x27;s facade also has many small pedimented windows and aedicular niches, using a mixture of segmental, broken, and open pediments.

Variations using multiple pediments became very popular in Baroque architecture, and the central vertical line of church facades often ascended through several pediments of different sizes and shapes, in Rome five at the Church of the Gesù (Giacomo della Porta 1584) and six at Santi Vincenzo e Anastasio a Trevi (Martino Longhi the Younger, 1646), the top three folding into each other, using the same base line. This facade has been described as &quot;a veritable symphony in repetitious pedimentry, bringing together a superimposed array of broken pediments, open pediments and arched pediments&quot;. The Gesù is the home church of the Jesuit order, who favoured this style, which was first seen in many cities around Europe in a new main Jesuit church.

===From 1750 to Art Deco===

Pediments became extremely common on the main facades of English country houses, and many across northern Europe; these might be placed over a porch with columns, or simply decorations to an essentially flat facade. In England, if there was any sculpture within the tympanum, it was often restricted to a coat of arms. 

Neoclassical architecture returned to &quot;purer&quot; classical models mostly using conventional triangular pediments, often over a portico with columns. Large schemes of pedimental sculpture were used where the budget allowed. In 19th-century styles, freer treatments returned, and large segmental pediments were especially popular in eclectic styles such as Beaux-Arts architecture, often overwhelmed by sculpture within, above, and to the sides. 

Large pediments with columns, often called the &quot;temple front&quot;, became widely used for important public buildings such as stock exchanges, reserve banks, law courts, legislatures, and museums, where an impression of solidity, reliability, and respectability was desired.

===Postmodern reinterpretations===
Postmodernism, a movement that questioned Modernism (the status quo after WW2), promoted the inclusion of elements of historic styles in new designs. An early text questioning Modernism was by architect Robert Venturi, &quot;Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture&quot; (1966), in which he recommended a revival of the &#x27;presence of the past&#x27; in architectural design. He tried to include in his own buildings qualities that he described as &#x27;inclusion, inconsistency, compromise, accommodation, adaptation, superadjacency, equivalence, multiple focus, juxtaposition, or good and bad space.&#x27; 

Venturi encouraged &#x27;quotation&#x27;, which means reusing elements of the past in new designs. Part manifesto, part architectural scrapbook accumulated over the previous decade, the book represented the vision for a new generation of architects and designers who had grown up with Modernism but who felt increasingly constrained by its perceived rigidities. Multiple Postmodern architects and designers put simplified reinterpretations of the pediment found in Classical decoration at the top of their creations. As with other elements and ornaments taken from styles of the pre-Modern past, they were in most cases highly simplified. Especially when it comes to office architecture, Postmodernism was only skin deep; the underlying structure was usually very similar, if not identical, to that of Modernist buildings.

In 1984 Philip Johnson designed what is now called 550 Madison Avenue in New York City (formerly known as the Sony Tower, Sony Plaza, and AT&amp;T Building), a famous work of Post-Modern architecture, where a broken pediment at the top of a typical skyscraper wittily evokes a Thomas Chippendale-style tallboy at a massive scale. Marco Polo House in London (1989, now demolished) was similar.

<text>Hammerwood Park is a country house in Hammerwood, near East Grinstead, in East Sussex, England. It is a Grade I listed building. One of the first houses in England to be built in the Greek Revival architectural style, it was built in 1792 as the first independent work of Benjamin Henry Latrobe. Described by Nikolaus Pevsner as a &#x27;demonstration of primeval force&#x27;, the house was owned by Led Zeppelin from 1973 until 1982.

==History==

===The site before 1792===
The land previously comprised part of a previous estate known as The Bower, probably named after a family called Atte Boure, who are listed as paying tax to Edward I in the 1290s, a substantial landholding which included parts of the parishes of East Grinstead and Hartfield. Sometime during the 1500s the owners, the Botting family, founded an iron forge to the east of the ponds in the valley to the south of the current house (coordinates: ). The forge may have been in existence in 1558, when Hugh Botting left &quot;two tons of yron&quot; in his will; it was working in 1653 but ruined by 1664. The dam has been recorded as long.

In 1693, a part of the woodland adjoining the Ashdown Forest was felled to clear the grounds of the former house on the present site. The estate, which is thought to have been part of a medieval deer park, later passed to other families and in 1766 the owner paid window tax on forty-one windows, making the Bower the fifth largest out of the 150 taxable residences in East Grinstead. It seems likely that the present Bower House, a Tudor farmhouse in the village of Hammerwood, is of no direct relation. There existed a previous building on the site of what was to become Hammerwood Lodge; foundations and walls in the west of the central block of the current house have been dated to pre-1792, and it would seem likely that this was the principal dwelling of the Bower.

===1790s: design and construction===

In late 1791 or early 1792, John Sperling (1763–1851) is recorded by Christian Ignatius Latrobe as visiting architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe, his brother, in London. Sperling, who already had a country seat at Dynes Hall, a 17th-century country house and 500-acre estate in Great Maplestead, Essex, came from a wealthy family which had made its fortune in the London fur trade after emigrating from Sweden. Only a year older than Latrobe, who was at that time a pupil of S. P. Cockerell, he commissioned Latrobe to design and build a new country house and hunting lodge, in the Germanic tradition of the &quot;Jagdschloss&quot;, on the site of the Bower. Sperling chose to name the new house Hammerwood Lodge at this point, probably as a romantic reference to the hammer used in the furnace of the iron forge which had existed in the area since the Middle Ages. Latrobe is thought to have supervised the construction from the autumn of 1792 onwards, its proximity to Ashdown House, his second commission (near Forest Row) allowing for the sharing of craftsmen and suppliers of building materials – and for Latrobe to supervise both coincidentally.

Trinder describes the design as comprising &quot;a large, Palladian central block (&quot;corps de logis&quot;) accentuated by a giant order of shallow pilasters flanked by low arcaded wings terminated in tetrastyle porticoes, while an asymmetric service wing stretches toward the northeast, hidden behind the bulk of the house.&quot; Coadeware plaques of scenes derived from the Borghese Vase adorn both porticos, and the influence of the temples at Paestum, which Latrobe may have witnessed on during prior visit to Naples, and Delos has been noted by scholars. Nikolaus Pevsner also observed that the columns were &quot;patently inspired by the then very recent work of such men as Ledoux and Brongniart&quot;.

In 1795, due to problems in obtaining payment for another project, Latrobe was faced with severe financial problems. When his wife, Lydia Sellon, having died in childbirth in November 1793, he is thought to have suffered a breakdown. Declared bankrupt and unable to pay some of his workmen, he emigrated to America on 25 November 1795. There is some doubt over whether Hammerwood was finished by this point; it is possible that the Sperlings supervised its completion in Latrobe&#x27;s absence. However, the failure of a large investment in a Dublin distillery led the Sperlings to lose £70,000 (equivalent to approximately £5.9 million in 2021 pounds); the artist and diarist Joseph Farington reported that they and their partners &#x27;overbuilt themselves at a vast expense&#x27;. Between 1798 and 1800, Sperling was compelled to give up both Hammerwood and his London home and to move back to his Dynes Hall estate.

===1800–1921: Victorian estate===
In 1801, Hammerwood was purchased by Magens Dorrien Magens (), a London merchant banker who served as a Tory MP for Carmarthen (for just six months in 1796; he was unseated after his opponent lodged a successful election petition) and later for Ludgershall, in Wiltshire, from 1804 to 1812. Upon his death in 1849 he left Hammerwood to his son, John Dorrien Magens, who as chairman of the board of the East Grinstead Railway Company (EGR) was responsible for the connection of East Grinstead to the railway system at Three Bridges in 1855. It would seem likely that extensions to the house, specifically to the north-east service wing, took place under the ownership of the Dorrien Magens family, and census records from the 1840s indicate at least ten indoor staff during the period.

John Dorrien Magens sold Hammerwood to Oswald Augustus Smith (1826–1902; of Smith&#x27;s Bank, later part of NatWest) in June 1864 for £37,250 (equating to approximately £3.3 million in 2021 pounds), of which £10,000 was for the timber. In 1865, the Smiths contracted S. S. Teulon with the intention of remodelling the house to their taste. Amongst other more subtle changes to the building, this included raising the attic over the central block to create a low third floor, whilst preserving Latrobe&#x27;s façade. Work began on 8 May 1865; scholars Snadon and Fazio comment that &quot;Teulon integrated his additions so carefully with the existing fabric that it is difficult at first glance to discern them&quot;.

Whilst maintaining the 2,000-acre estate of parkland, arable farmland and woods, Oswald Augustus also installed a gas system for the lighting of the house, and fully insulated the newly raised roof. Initially paying for a Chapel of Ease for the three local parishes of East Grinstead, Forest Row and Hartfield, in 1873, he provided for a village school for 100 children; in 1875 for the Vicarage; in 1880 for St Stephen&#x27;s Church, Hammerwood, to the design of E. P. Loftus Brock, at the cost of £7,431, the first vicar being Rev. Clement Colby Woodland of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge; in 1892 for the rebuilding of St Peter&#x27;s Church, Holtye in memory of his late wife (Rose Sophia Vansittart, 1832–1892); in 1893 for the rebuilding of the Countess of Thanet&#x27;s Almshouses on Holtye Common, and at the end of the 19th century for a new building for the Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead. Additionally, much of the village of Hammerwood which exists today (the population of which reached a peak of 438 in 1891), and some of the houses to the east of the village of Ashurst Wood, were built during Smith&#x27;s tenure as tied cottages for estate workers.

The Rev. George Ferris Whidborne (1845–1910) purchased Hammerwood from Oswald Augustus shortly before the latter&#x27;s death. Impressed by the unusual and abundant wildlife, he moved his family from Dorset; the Whidbornes would live at Hammerwood from 1901 to 1921. His eldest son was killed in the First World War; all three were at different times awarded the MC.

In 1919, the prep school in Tunbridge Wells which the Whidborne children had attended burned down; St Andrew&#x27;s moved to Hammerwood whilst new premises were found in Forest Row. Old boys remembered playing cricket against Ashdown House, by now a prep school, on the lawn at Hammerwood. However, in 1918 death duties had compelled Margaret Whidborne to sell 843 acres of the estate (almost half of the land). Three years later a further 1,300 acres of farms were sold, the house disposed of and the contents auctioned. Two floors of servants&#x27; quarters on the north-east service wing which had been added during the 19th century were demolished and, left with 320 acres of adjoining park and woodland, the name of the estate was changed to Hammerwood Park; its place as a focal point of local life began to decline.

===1921–1982: decline and dereliction===

In 1921, the remains of the estate – comprising the house and 329 acres of land – were taken up by Lt. Col. Stephen Hungerford Pollen CMG (1868–1935) after a career in the British Army, having been ADC to Lords Lansdowne and Elgin (respective Viceroys of India), winning medals for service in that country and South Africa, and serving in the Tirah Expedition in 1897. His family were the first residents to enjoy an electricity supply and water from the mains.

There remained a full complement of eleven or twelve – by differing accounts – indoor staff for the duration of the Pollens&#x27; time at Hammerwood, and he contributed the land, and a quarter of the building costs, for the building of the Hammerwood and Holtye Hall. It is a strange coincidence that one of Lt. Col. Pollen&#x27;s ancestors, Richard Pollen, brother of Sir John Pollen, Bt., married the daughter of S. P. Cockerell, the architect under whom Latrobe studied. After the death of Lt. Col. Pollen in 1935, the Kirwan Taylor family bought Hammerwood; they were the owners when the Second World War broke out. Like many large houses, it was requisitioned for use by the armed forces, becoming home to 200 soldiers, including the cricketer Denis Compton, and a contingent from the Canadian Army. No. 660 Squadron RAF operated from an airstrip to the north of the park from November 1943, and the SOE flew Westland Lysanders from the same strip for a time.
After the war, John Chattell (1931–2021) bought the estate, dividing the house into eleven apartments. However, dry and wet rot became increasingly problematic and the house uninhabitable; its listed building description, written after a visit in November 1953, already noted that it was &#x27;empty and boarded up&#x27;, and placed it at Grade II status; it was later upgraded to Grade I. In 1973, rock band Led Zeppelin bought Hammerwood at auction, intending to turn it into a recording studio and flats. Although the house did make an appearance at the beginning of the film &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot;, their plans did not progress. Amid significant vandalism, three tonnes of lead were removed from the roof, compromising it in fourteen locations and allowing thousands of gallons of water to flow into the structure. The progression of the rot accelerated, leading the house to become increasingly structurally unsafe. Hammerwood was boarded up in 1976, and put on sale in 1978.

===1982–present: restoration===
Having been for sale for four years, the house was advertised in &quot;Country Life&quot; in June 1982, by this time in a very poor condition and including only 30 acres of overgrown gardens. In July 1982, it was purchased by David Pinnegar, with the intention of restoring and opening it to visitors. Although there was some bemusement at his age, the house opened to the public in April 1983. The restoration, much of which was undertaken by volunteers, won the Anne de Amodio award from the International Burgen Institute (now part of Europa Nostra) in 1984, and a silver medal from the Société d&#x27;Encouragement au Progrès in Paris in 1987. In his &quot;England&#x27;s Thousand Best Houses&quot; (2003), Simon Jenkins would describe Mr Pinnegar as &#x27;one of those eccentrics without whom half the houses in England would have vanished&#x27;.

In 1984, the house was given a rare copy of the Parthenon Frieze made by D. Brucciani &amp; Co., which is displayed in the old kitchens, now known as the Elgin Room. The Great Storm of 1987 caused considerable damage, with No. 656 Squadron AAC assisting in a delivery of new roof lead in 1988 using a Westland Lynx, in an operation covered by Blue Peter. Except for a modest contribution by English Heritage and the Department of the Environment, private ownership restricted access to heritage grants; the restoration was instead funded almost entirely from visitors, costing more than £140,000 between 1982 and 1989, making it the largest private restoration project in Europe at the time. Works continued into the new millennium and a programme of rolling restoration is ongoing.

==Hammerwood today==
The house and gardens have been open to the public since 1983. Guided tours focus upon the historical context of the house, the ancient mythological and religious origins of the Greek Revival, connections with Freemasonry, the Agricultural Revolution, the Picturesque movement, and issues of interpretation of the Borghese Vase, scenes from which are transcribed in Coade stone plaques in the porticos, and the Parthenon Frieze. An extensive musical instrument collection is used for an annual programme of concerts, and the keyboards are tuned to an unequal temperament, upon which composers of the Classical and Romantic eras relied.

The estate is used regularly as a film location for TV, feature films, fashion and photography. Films have included the 2007 horror movie &quot;Knife Edge&quot;, the 2010 film &quot;London Boulevard&quot; starring Colin Farrell and Keira Knightley, and work by Led Zeppelin, The Darkness, Victoria Beckham, Melanie C, and Cheryl Cole. It served as the setting for the 1998 narcotics documentary &quot;Sacred Weeds&quot;.

Hammerwood has also been used for fashion shoots and photography for Prada, John Lewis catalogues, Tim Walker for &quot;Vogue&quot; and editorials for other magazines (including, amongst others, &quot;Country Life&quot;). It served as the location for Beyoncé’s September 2018 Vogue cover shoot.

==Park and gardens==

Hammerwood is sited on a south-facing hill, commanding extensive views from the south-west to the south-east; its own southern façade looking across the valley to a stream where the iron forge which gave the estate its name once sat. A serpentine lake, artificially dammed from this steam apparently as part of the Sperlings&#x27; landscaping (not shown on a Gardner and Gream map of 1795 but visible on the OS drawing of 1808) sits at the bottom of the valley with open parkland on either side; views of distant hills continue for two or three miles beyond. Scholars Fazio and Snadon note Latrobe&#x27;s 1794 reference to a &#x27;very intimate&#x27; acquaintance with Humphry Repton (1752–1818), the English landscape designer, and suggest that many features of the Hammerwood landscape, including unobstructed views to the south which extend far further than the 1792 boundaries of the estate, align with Repton&#x27;s ideas. The influence of Capability Brown has also been noted, and ring counts of oaks felled by the Great Storm of 1987 dated them to 1793 and 1796, suggesting that landscaping and replanting did indeed take place.

Additional formal terraces and informal ornamental gardens were made up in the 19th and 20th centuries, initially replacing the former sweep of parkland up to the frontage of the house shown on maps up to 1841. Oswald Augustus Smith (who purchased Hammerwood in 1864) was probably responsible for laying out the ornamental gardens to the east of the house. As the cousin of Augustus Smith (the founder of Tresco Abbey Gardens in the Isles of Scilly, where rhododendrons feature in the planting) he introduced them to Hammerwood and they remain today. The Smiths also planted the gardens with specimen trees and made up gravel paths through the bushes, shrubberies and woodland to the east (these are shown on the OS map of 1873). In 1927, a Yew Garden was introduced below the south terrace; it has been restored and is now a registered helicopter landing site. Until the mid-20th century, the parkland on the valley slopes to the south of the lakes was mainly wooded; it is now under arable cultivation, for which it was largely cleared of trees in the 1950s. A few scattered trees remain from the extensive pattern shown established on the map of 1808.

During the period of dereliction much of the garden (including kitchen gardens and greenhouses to the north) became severely overgrown, and the parkland was used as grazing land (with the Library employed as a grain store). Much of the ornamental garden to the south and east has been restored and replanted, with work done by volunteers from the National Trust Activities Group (NTAG) and the London Wildlife Trust (and, in the replanting of trees, by the Stanley Smith Horticultural Trust, the Men of the Trees, the Countryside Commission and the South East Electricity Board after the Great Storm of 1987). Forming part of the High Weald AONB since October 1983, the parkland and gardens were given Grade II listed status in 1987.

==Entrances and approaches==
As part of the landscaping undertaken by Sperling and Latrobe in the 1790s, a long, winding drive extending from Ashurst Wood which approached the house from the south was laid. In his study of Hammerwood, Trinder suggests that from the perspective created by this approach the pilasters on the central block create an optical illusion which leads the house to look larger than it is due to the inclusion of temple fronts on the wings. He describes the joint endeavours of Sperling and Latrobe as &quot;a collective ego trip on a small budget ... the house, although of modest size for the time, is designed to look huge.&quot; From the mid-19th century (probably coincidental with John Dorrien-Magens&#x27; development of the railway from East Grinstead), the southerly approach became less oft-used as the route from the railway town became more practical via the East Grinstead–Tunbridge Wells road (which was to become the B2110, and then the A264) and the lane thence through the village of Hammerwood.

The southerly approach fell almost entirely out of use as the house became derelict, and some of it was given over to farmland in the 20th century; more recently the drive has been obstructed by hedges along its length. The former entrance lodge, known as Dog Gate Lodge (coordinates: ), survives, together with the bridge (at the site of the earlier iron forge) which carried the drive over the feeder channel for the ornamental lake at the foot of the valley. The road leading east out of Ashurst Wood (now a dead end) is still called Hammerwood Road. There were also two secondary entrance drives to the house, from the north-west and north-east, now disused but shown on the tithe map of 1841.

<text>Bonanza is an American Western television series that ran on NBC from September 12, 1959, to January 16, 1973. Lasting 14 seasons and 432 episodes, &quot;Bonanza&quot; is NBC&#x27;s longest-running Western, the second-longest-running Western series on American network television (behind CBS&#x27;s &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;), and one of the longest-running, live-action American series. The show continues to air in syndication. The show is set in the 1860s and centers on the wealthy Cartwright family, who live in the vicinity of Virginia City, Nevada, bordering Lake Tahoe. The series initially starred Lorne Greene, Pernell Roberts, Dan Blocker and Michael Landon and later featured (at various times) Guy Williams, David Canary, Mitch Vogel and Tim Matheson. The show is known for presenting pressing moral dilemmas.

The title &quot;Bonanza&quot; is a term used by miners in regard to a large vein or deposit of silver ore, from Spanish &quot;bonanza&quot; (rich ore body) and commonly refers to the 1859 revelation of the Comstock Lode of rich silver ore mines under the town of Virginia City, not far from the fictional Ponderosa Ranch that the Cartwright family operated. The show&#x27;s theme song, also titled &quot;Bonanza&quot;, became a hit song. Only instrumental renditions, without Ray Evans&#x27;s lyrics, were used during the series&#x27;s long run.

In 2002, &quot;Bonanza&quot; was ranked No. 43 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time, and in 2013 &quot;TV Guide&quot; included it in its list of The 60 Greatest Dramas of All Time. The time period for the television series is roughly between 1861 (Season 1) and 1867 (Season 13) during and shortly after the American Civil War, coinciding with the period Nevada Territory became a U.S. state.

During the summer of 1972, NBC aired reruns of episodes from the 1967–1970 period in prime time on Tuesday evening under the title Ponderosa.

== Premise ==

The show chronicles the weekly adventures of the Cartwright family, headed by the thrice-widowed patriarch Ben Cartwright (Lorne Greene). He had three sons, each by a different wife: the eldest was the urbane architect Adam Cartwright (Pernell Roberts), who built the ranch house; the second was the warm and lovable giant Eric &quot;Hoss&quot; Cartwright (Dan Blocker); and the youngest was the hotheaded and impetuous Joseph, or &quot;Little Joe&quot; (Michael Landon). Through exposition and flashback episodes, the viewer learns that each wife was accorded a different ancestry: English, Swedish, and French Creole, respectively. The family&#x27;s cook was Chinese immigrant Hop Sing (Victor Sen Yung).

The family lived on a thousand-square-mile (2,600 km2) ranch called the Ponderosa on the eastern shore of Lake Tahoe in Nevada opposite California on the edge of the Sierra Nevada range. The vast size of the Cartwrights&#x27; land was quietly revised to &quot;half a million acres&quot; (2,000 km2) in Lorne Greene&#x27;s 1964 song, &quot;Saga of the Ponderosa&quot;. The ranch name refers to the &quot;Pinus ponderosa&quot; (ponderosa pine), common in the West. The nearest town to the Ponderosa was Virginia City, where the Cartwrights would go to converse with Sheriff Roy Coffee (played by veteran actor Ray Teal), or his deputy Clem Foster (Bing Russell).

&quot;Bonanza&quot; was considered an atypical Western for its time, as the core of the storylines dealt less about the range but more with Ben and his three dissimilar sons, how they cared for one another, their neighbors and just causes.

&quot;You always saw stories about family on comedies or on an anthology, but &quot;Bonanza&quot; was the first series that was week-to-week about a family and the troubles it went through. &quot;Bonanza&quot; was a period drama that attempted to confront contemporary social issues. That was very difficult to do on television. Most shows that tried to do it failed because the sponsors didn&#x27;t like it, and the networks were nervous about getting letters,&quot; explains Stephen Battaglio, a senior editor for &quot;TV Guide&quot; magazine.

== Cast ==

Though not familiar stars in 1959, the cast quickly became favorites of the first television generation. The order of billing at the beginning of the broadcast appeared to be shuffled randomly each week, with no relation whatsoever to the current episode featured that week.

== Episodes ==


== Background and production ==
=== Set and filming ===
The opening scene for the first season was shot at Lake Hemet, a reservoir in the San Jacinto Mountains, Riverside County, California, and later moved to Lake Tahoe. After moving to Lake Tahoe, the opening sequence with theme music was filmed on the east side of Lake Tahoe in Bourne&#x27;s meadow near Round Hill, Nevada. During the first season extra horses were rented from the Idyllwild Stables in Idyllwild, also in the San Jacinto Mountains. The first Virginia City set was used on the show until 1970 and was located on a backlot at Paramount and featured in episodes of &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot;, &quot;Mannix&quot; and &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;. In the 1970 premiere episode of the 12th season titled &quot;The Night Virginia City Died&quot;, Deputy Clem Foster&#x27;s pyromaniac fiancée levels the town in a series of fires (reflecting a real 1875 fire that destroyed three-quarters of Virginia City). This allowed for a switch to the less expensive Warner studios from September 1970 through January 1973. The script was initially written for the departing David Canary&#x27;s Candy, but was rewritten for actors Ray Teal (Sheriff Roy Coffee) and Bing Russell (Deputy Clem Foster), who rarely appeared together on the show.

The program&#x27;s Nevada set, the Ponderosa Ranch house, was recreated in Incline Village, Nevada, in 1967, and remained a tourist attraction until its sale thirty-seven years later in September 2004.

The series was also partially filmed in Wildwood Regional Park in Thousand Oaks, California.

=== Costumes ===

From the third season on, the Cartwrights and nearly every other recurring character on the show wore the same clothing in almost every episode. The reason for this is twofold: it made duplication of wardrobe easier for stunt doubles (Hal Burton, Bob Miles, Bill Clark, Lyle Heisler, Ray Mazy) and it cut the cost of refilming action shots (such as riding clips in-between scenes), as previously shot stock footage could be reused. Below is a survey of costumes employed:

* Ben Cartwright: Sandy shirt, tawny leather vest, gray pants, cream-colored hat, occasional green scarf.
* Adam Cartwright: Black shirt, black or midnight blue pants, black hat. Elegant city wear. Cream-colored trail coat.
* Hoss Cartwright: White shirt, brown suede vest, brown pants, large beige flat-brimmed, ten-gallon hat.
* Little Joe Cartwright: Beige, light gray shirt, kelly-green jacket, tan pants, beige hat. Black leather gloves from 10th season on. In season 14, he and Greene occasionally wore different shirts and slacks, as the footage of them and the late Dan Blocker together could no longer be reused.
* Candy Canaday: Crimson shirt, black pants, black leather vest, black hat, grey/ pale purple scarf.

It was not unusual for Little Joe Cartwright and Candy Canaday to appear shirtless in various scenes involving manual labor.

The horse saddles used by the Bonanza cast were made by the Bona Allen Company of Buford, Georgia.

=== Hair styles ===
In 1968, Blocker began wearing a toupee on the series, as he was approaching age 40 and his hair loss was becoming more evident. He joined the ranks of his fellow co-stars Roberts and Greene, both of whom had begun the series with hairpieces. (Greene wore his modest frontal piece in private life too, whereas Roberts preferred not wearing his, even to rehearsals/blocking.) Landon was the only original cast member who was wig-free throughout the series, as even Sen Yung wore an attached rattail- queue.

=== Music ===
&quot;Bonanza&quot; features a memorable theme song by Jay Livingston and Ray Evans that was orchestrated by David Rose and arranged by Billy May for the television series. Members of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time.

The &quot;Bonanza&quot; theme song opens with a blazing Ponderosa map and saddlebound Cartwrights. The melodic intro, emulating galloping horses, is one of the most recognized television scores. Variations of the theme were used for 12 seasons on the series. Although there were two official sets of lyrics (some country-western singers, avoiding royalties, substituted the copyright renditions with their own words), the series simply used an instrumental theme. Three of the cast members bellowed out the original lyrics, unaccompanied, at the close of the pilot (Pernell Roberts, the sole professional singer of the quartet, abstained and untethered the horse reins). Before the pilot aired (on September 12, 1959), the song sequence, deemed too campy, was edited out of the scene and instead the Cartwrights headed back to the ranch whooping and howling. In a 1964 song, the Livingston-Evans lyrics were revised by Lorne Greene with a more familial emphasis, &quot;on this land we put our brand, Cartwright is the name, fortune smiled the day we filed the Ponderosa claim&quot; (&quot;Bonanza&quot;, Bear Family Boxed set, Disc #2). In 1968, a slightly revamped horn and percussion-heavy arrangement of the original score introduced the series, which was used until 1970. A new theme song, called &quot;The Big Bonanza&quot; was written in 1970 by episode scorer David Rose, and was used from 1970 to 1972. Action-shot pictorials of the cast replaced the galloping trio with the order of the actors rotating from episode to episode, resulting in Blocker or Landon often getting top billing over Greene. Finally, a faster rendition of the original music returned for the 14th and final season, along with action shots of the cast (sans Dan Blocker, who had died by this point).

=== Cancellation ===

In the fall of 1972, NBC moved &quot;Bonanza&quot; to Tuesday nights—where reruns from the 1967–1970 period had been broadcast the previous summer under the title &quot;The Ponderosa&quot;—opposite the &quot;All in the Family&quot; spinoff show, &quot;Maude&quot;, which was a virtual death sentence for the program. The scheduling change, as well as Dan Blocker&#x27;s death in May 1972, resulted in plunging ratings for the show. David Canary returned to his former role of Candy (to offset Hoss&#x27; absence), and a new character named Griff King (played by Tim Matheson) was added in an attempt to lure younger viewers. Griff, in prison for nearly killing his abusive stepfather, was paroled into Ben&#x27;s custody and given a job as a ranch hand. Several episodes were built around his character, one that Matheson never had a chance to fully develop before the show was abruptly cancelled in November 1972 (with the final episode airing January 16, 1973). Many fans, as well as both Landon and Greene, felt that the character of Hoss was essential, as he was a nurturing, empathetic soul who rounded out the all-male cast.

For 14 years, &quot;Bonanza&quot; was the premier Western on American television. Reruns of the series have aired on several cable networks such as TV Land, INSP, Family Channel, the Hallmark Channel and Great American Faith &amp; Living.

== Themes ==
Episodes ranged from high drama to broad comedy and addressed issues such as the environment, substance abuse, domestic violence, anti-war sentiment, and illegitimate births. The series sought to illustrate the cruelty of bigotry against Asians, African Americans, Native Americans, Jews, Mormons, the disabled, and little people.

&quot;Bonanza&quot; is uniquely known for having addressed racism, not typically covered on American television during the time period, from a compassionate, humanitarian point-of-view.

Bigotry, including antisemitism, was the subject of the episode &quot;Look to the Stars&quot;. A bigoted school teacher Mr. Norton (oblivious to his prejudice) routinely expels minority students. When he expels the brilliant Jewish student Albert Michelson, a scientific genius whose experiments on the streets of Virginia City often cause commotion, Ben Cartwright steps in and confronts Norton on his bigotry. Ashamed, the schoolteacher vows to reform. A coda to the episode reveals that Michelson went on to win the Nobel Prize for Physics.

In the episode &quot;Enter Thomas Bowers&quot;, the Cartwright family helps the opera singer Thomas Bowers, an African-American freedman, after he encounters prejudice while in Virginia City to perform. Bowers winds up arrested as a fugitive slave. At the beginning of the episode, Adam is shown to be outraged at the Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot; decision (placing the time as 1857), which he discusses with his father. According to David Dortort, sponsor General Motors was anxious about the episode. As producer, Dortort ensured that the episode re-aired during the summer rerun seasons, though two TV stations in the South refused to air it.

In the episode &quot;The Wish&quot;, directed by Michael Landon, Hoss protects an African-American former slave&#x27;s family when confronted with racism after the American Civil War. In &quot;The Fear Merchants&quot;, discrimination against Chinese immigrants who attempt to assimilate in American society is addressed. &quot;The Lonely Man&quot; presents the controversial interracial marriage between the Cartwrights&#x27; longtime Chinese chef (Hop Sing) and a white woman (Missy).

=== Broadcast history and ratings ===

Initially, &quot;Bonanza&quot; aired on Saturdays at 7:30 p.m. Eastern, opposite &quot;Dick Clark&#x27;s Saturday Night Beech-Nut Show&quot; and &quot;John Gunther&#x27;s High Road&quot; on ABC, and &quot;Perry Mason&quot; on CBS. &quot;Bonanza&quot;″s initial ratings were respectable, often coming in behind Mason but ahead of the ABC lineup. Ironically, executives considered canceling the show before its premiere because of its high cost. NBC kept it because &quot;Bonanza&quot; was one of the first series to be filmed and broadcast in color, including scenes of picturesque Lake Tahoe, Nevada. NBC&#x27;s corporate parent, Radio Corporation of America (RCA), used the show to spur sales of RCA-manufactured color television sets (RCA was also the primary sponsor of the series during its first two seasons).

For Season 3, NBC moved &quot;Bonanza&quot; to Sundays at 9:00 pm Eastern with new sponsor Chevrolet (replacing &quot;The Dinah Shore Chevy Show&quot;). The new time slot caused &quot;Bonanza&quot; to soar in the ratings, and it eventually reached number one by 1964, an honor it would keep until 1967. By 1970, &quot;Bonanza&quot; was the first series to appear in the Top Five list for nine consecutive seasons (a record that would stand for many years) and thus established itself as the most consistent strong-performing hit television series of the 1960s. &quot;Bonanza&quot; remained high on the Nielsen ratings until 1971, when it finally fell out of the Top Ten.

During the summer of 1972, NBC broadcast reruns of episodes of the show from the 1967–1970 era on Tuesdays at 7:30 p.m. under the title &quot;Ponderosa&quot; while also rerunning more recent episodes on Sunday evenings in the show″s normal time slot as &quot;Bonanza&quot;. In the fall of 1972, off-network episodes were released in broadcast syndication to local stations by NBC under the &quot;Ponderosa&quot; name. After the series was canceled in 1973, the syndicated reruns reverted to the &quot;Bonanza&quot; name.

=== Home media ===

A handful of early episodes have fallen into the public domain. These episodes have been released by several companies in different configurations, with substandard picture and sound quality, edited, and by legal necessity with the copyright-protected Evans–Livingston theme song replaced with generic western music.

In 1973, NBC sold its NBC Films syndication division, and with it the rights to the series, along with the rest of its pre-1973 library, to National Telefilm Associates, which changed its name to Republic Pictures in 1984. Republic would become part of the Spelling Entertainment organization in 1994 through Worldvision Enterprises. Select episodes (&quot;The Best of Bonanza&quot;) were officially released in North America in 2003 on DVD through then-Republic video licensee Artisan Entertainment (which was later purchased by Lionsgate Home Entertainment). Republic (through CBS Media Ventures, which holds the television side of Republic&#x27;s holdings) still retains the syndication distribution rights to the series. CBS Home Entertainment (under Paramount Home Media Distribution) is the official home video rights distributor at present.

Starting in September 2009, CBS Home Entertainment (distributed by Paramount) has to date released the first eleven seasons on DVD in Region 1. All episodes have been digitally remastered from original 35 mm film elements to yield the best picture and sound quality possible with current technology. CBSHE has released each season in two-volume sets (available together and separately). On May 23, 2023, the remaining seasons 12, 13 and 14 were released on DVD, as well as a box set of the complete series containing all 431 episodes on 112 DVDs.

In Region 2, &quot;AL!VE AG&quot; released the first seven seasons on DVD in Germany between 2008 and 2010. These releases are now out of print as AL!VE has lost the rights. In 2011, StudioCanal acquired the rights to the series and have begun re-releasing it on DVD, and all seasons have now been released but have not been remastered.

Episodes of the series have also been officially released as part-works on DVD in France and the United Kingdom.

&quot;Bonanza&quot; &quot;the official first season&quot; was released in Scandinavia during 2010. The first season is released in 4 volumes. The first two volumes were released on October 20, 2010, and the second two volumes on April 27, 2011.



== Other media information ==
=== Television movies ===

&quot;Bonanza&quot; was revived for a series of three made-for-television movies featuring the Cartwrights&#x27; children: &quot;&quot; (1988), &quot;Bonanza: The Return&quot; (1993) and &quot;Bonanza: Under Attack&quot; (1995). Michael Landon Jr. played Little Joe&#x27;s son Benji while Gillian Greene, Lorne Greene&#x27;s daughter, played a love interest. In the second movie, airing on NBC, a one-hour retrospective was done to introduce the drama. It was hosted by both Michael Landon Jr. and Dirk Blocker, who looks and sounds almost exactly like his father, Dan Blocker, albeit without his father&#x27;s towering height. According to the magazine &quot;TV Guide&quot;, producer David Dortort told Blocker he was too old to play the Hoss scion, but gave him the role of an unrelated newspaper reporter. Clips of the younger Blocker&#x27;s appearance and voice were heavily used in advertisements promoting the &quot;second generation&quot; theme, perhaps misleading audiences to believe that Blocker was playing Hoss&#x27; heir. Hoss&#x27; son Josh was born out of wedlock, as it is explained that Hoss drowned without knowing his fiancėe was pregnant. Such a storyline might have been problematic in the original series. (&quot;The Big Valley&quot;, however, had a major character in Heath, who was presented as illegitimate.) The &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; movies of the early 1990s employed a similar theme when Marshal Matt Dillon learned he had sired Michael Learned&#x27;s character&#x27;s daughter in a short-lived romance. The initial story was first introduced in 1973, when depiction of fornication courted protests, so CBS insisted their hero Matt have the encounter when he had amnesia. As was the style of television Westerns, gunfights played a major role in the movies which featured notoriously inaccurate shooting as well as unlimited ammunition.

=== Prequel ===

In 2001, there was an attempt to revive the &quot;Bonanza&quot; concept with a prequel, &quot;Ponderosa&quot;—not to be confused with the 1972 summer reruns under the same title—with a pilot directed by Simon Wincer and filmed in Australia. Covering the time when the Cartwrights first arrived at the Ponderosa, when Adam and Hoss were teenagers and Joe a little boy, the series lasted 20 episodes and featured less gunfire and brawling than the original. &quot;Bonanza&quot; creator David Dortort approved PAX TV (now Ion TV)&#x27;s decision to hire Beth Sullivan, formerly of &quot;Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman&quot;, which some believe gave the series more depth as well as a softer edge. The Hop Sing character is depicted not only as a cook but also a family counselor and herbal healer. The series takes place in Nevada Territory in 1849, which is actually an anachronism. The Nevada Territory did not split from the Utah Territory until 1861, meaning that until at least the 5th season (the episode &quot;Enter Thomas Bowers&quot; establishes that year as 1857), &quot;Bonanza&quot; is also set in what in real life would have been Utah Territory.

=== &quot;Bonanza&quot; merchandise ===

&quot;Bonanza&quot; has had a highly profitable merchandising history. Currently, Bonanza Ventures, Inc. grants merchandising and licensing rights worldwide. The original series has spawned several successful novelty western/folk albums from 1962 to 1965 including &quot;Bonanza, Christmas on the Ponderosa&quot; which charted at #35 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Christmas Record album chart; three dozen Dell and Gold Key comic books from 1962 through 1970; a short-lived comic book adaptation by Dutch comics artist Hans G. Kresse between 1965 and 1966, Jim Beam Whiskey Ponderosa Ranch decanters 1964–1966; a series of &quot;Big-Little&quot; books from 1966 to 1969; Revel Bonanza model character sets from 1966 to 1968; a chain of Bonanza and Ponderosa steakhouses from 1963–present; the Lake Tahoe-based &quot;Ponderosa&quot; theme park from 1967 to 2004; a line of American Character action figures in 1966–1967; Aladdin lunch buckets and thermos bottles in 1966–1968; View Master slide sets in 1964, 1971; Ponderosa tin cups from 1967 to 2004; a series of Hamilton collector plates in 1989–1990; and most recently, Breyer Fiftieth Anniversary Ponderosa Stable sets, with horses and Cartwright figures in 2009–2011.

<doc id="180094" wikidata="Q240463" url="?curid=180094" title="Surat Thani province">
<text>Surat Thani (, ), often shortened to Surat, is the largest of the southern provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;) of Thailand. It lies on the western shore of the Gulf of Thailand. Surat Thani means &#x27;city of good people&#x27;, a title given to the city by King Vajiravudh (Rama VI); Surat Thani is therefore the sole province in Southern Thailand for which the native name is in the Central Thai language.

==Geography==
Surat Thani Province, located in Thailand, is bordered by the provinces of Chumphon to the north, Nakhon Si Thammarat to the east, Krabi to the south, Phang Nga to the southwest, and Ranong to the northwest.

The geographic landscape of Surat Thani is diverse. The central region of the province is dominated by the coastal plain of the Tapi River, characterized by a mix of grassland, rubber trees, palm oil trees, and coconut plantations. To the west lie the limestone mountains of the Phuket range, largely enveloped in forest, home to the renowned Khao Sok National Park. The eastern part of the province sees the commencement of the Nakhon Si Thammarat (or Bantat) mountain range, a portion of which is preserved within Tai Rom Yen National Park. The total forest area in Surat Thani is approximately , accounting for 28.8 percent of the province&#x27;s area.

Several islands in the Gulf of Thailand are part of Surat Thani, including popular tourist destinations such as Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao, as well as the Ko Ang Thong Marine National Park.

The province is also defined by its main waterways, the Tapi River and the Phum Duang River, which converge near the town of Tha Kham before emptying into Bandon Bay. The delta formed by these rivers, known locally as &quot;Nai Bang&quot; (ในบาง), is situated directly north of Surat Thani city. This delta features a network of channels interspersed with small islands, predominantly covered by mangroves and orchards.

===National parks===
There are a total of eight national parks, six of which are in region 4 (Surat Thani) and Hat Khanom–Mu Ko Thale Tai and Namtok Si Khit are in region 5 (Nakhon Si Thammarat) of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas. 
* Khao Sok National Park, 
* Kaeng Krung National Park, 
* Tai Rom Yen National Park, 
* Khlong Phanom National Park, 
* Hat Khanom–Mu Ko Thale Tai National Park, 
* Namtok Si Khit National Park, 
* Mu Ko Ang Thong National Park, 
* Than Sadet–Ko Pha-ngan National Park, 

===Wildlife sanctuaries===
There are two wildlife sanctuaries, along with five other wildlife sanctuaries, make up region 4 (Surat Thani) of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas. 
* Khlong Saeng Wildlife Sanctuary, 
* Khlong Yan Wildlife Sanctuary, 

==History==
The region of Surat Thani has a long history of human habitation, dating back to prehistoric times. It was initially inhabited by indigenous Semang and Malayan tribes. In the 3rd century, the area came under the influence of the Srivijaya kingdom, a powerful entity that controlled much of the Malay Peninsula until the 13th century. The city of Chaiya, located in modern-day Surat Thani, is home to several archaeological ruins from the Srivijaya period, indicating its historical significance. There is a belief among some Thai historians that Chaiya may have served as a regional, or possibly even the primary capital of the Srivijaya kingdom, although this assertion remains a subject of scholarly debate. Another notable settlement from this era was Wiang Sa, which also played a significant role during the time of Srivijaya&#x27;s dominance.
Following the decline of the Srivijaya kingdom, the region was partitioned into the cities (&quot;mueang&quot;) of Chaiya, Thatong (present-day Kanchanadit), and Khirirat Nikhom. Chaiya was governed directly from the Thai capital, whereas Thatong and Khirirat Nikhom came under the jurisdiction of the Nakhon Si Thammarat Kingdom. In 1899, these cities were amalgamated to form a single province named Chaiya. 

In 1915, significant administrative changes occurred. The capital city of the Monthon Chumphon was relocated the city from Chaiya to Bandon. During a visit by King Vajiravudh (Rama VI) on 29 July 1915, Bandon was renamed &quot;Surat Thani&quot;, a change possibly inspired by the major port city of Surat in Gujarat, India. Concurrently, the Monthon was also renamed Surat. In 1926, this Monthon was abolished and integrated into Monthon Nakhon Si Thammarat. Following the dissolution of the monthon system in 1933, Surat Thani was established as a first-level administrative division, gaining the status of a province. 

The administrative headquarters of Surat Thani Province were originally housed in a building located in Tha Kham, within the Phunphin District. Before World War II, the administrative center was relocated to the city of Surat Thani, situated along the Tapi River. This river shares its name with the Tapi River in Surat, located in the southern region of Gujarat, India. 

During the Japanese invasion of Thailand on 8 December 1941, the administrative building in Surat Thani was destroyed amidst the conflict that engulfed the city. The building was eventually reconstructed in 1954. However, on 19 March 1982, the building was targeted in a bombing by communist insurgents, resulting in its destruction and the tragic loss of five lives. 

Following this incident, a new provincial administration building was constructed at a different location, south of the city center. The site of the former provincial hall has since been repurposed and now hosts the city pillar shrine (&quot;Lak Mueang&quot;). This third and current administrative building continues to serve as the provincial government&#x27;s headquarters.

==Symbols==
The provincial seal of Surat Thani prominently features the pagoda of Wat Phra Borommathat Chaiya, a historic structure believed to have been constructed approximately 1,200 years ago. The design of the provincial flag incorporates the image of this pagoda, set against a background divided horizontally with orange on the top half and yellow on the bottom.

Surat Thani&#x27;s provincial flower is the bua phut (&quot;Rafflesia kerrii&quot;), noted for being a parasitic plant that produces some of the largest flowers among all plant species. The provincial tree is identified as the ton kiam (&quot;Cotylelobium melanoxylon&quot;). The Rafflesia flower, can be found in Khao Sok National Park in Surat Thani. Asian green arowana (&quot;Scleropages formosus&quot;) is the provincial aqualtic life because the Cheow Lan Lake in the Rajjaprabha Dam, part of Khao Sok National Park, is the last natural habitat in Thailand for this endangerous living fossil freshwater fish. In addition, this species of fish was first bred in Thailand in 1988 by the Department of Fisheries. The hatchlings were from parents collected from the wild from nearby Khlong Saeng and Khlong Yan Wildlife Sanctuaries. 

The slogan of the province is &quot;เมืองร้อยเกาะ เงาะอร่อย หอยใหญ่ ไข่แดง แหล่งธรรมะ&quot; (&quot;Mueang roi ko, ngo aroi, hoi yai, khai daeng, laeng thamma&quot;), which translates to &quot;city of 100 islands, delicious rambutan, big shells, red eggs, the center of Buddhism&quot;. This slogan reflects several unique aspects of the province: its numerous islands, the local specialty of tasty &quot;rambutan&quot; fruits, the abundance of large shellfish, notably oysters, and the cultural significance of salted duck eggs known locally as &quot;red eggs&quot;. The reference to the &quot;center of Buddhism&quot; highlights important religious sites within the province, including Wat Phra Borommathat Chaiya and Suan Mokkhaphalaram.

==Administrative divisions==
===Provincial government===
The province is divided into 19 districts (&quot;amphoes&quot;), which are further divided into 131 subdistricts (&quot;tambons&quot;) and 1,028 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).

===Local government===
As of 26 November 2019 there are: one Surat Thani Provincial Administration Organisation (&quot;&quot;) and 40 municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. Surat Thani and Ko Samui have city (&quot;thesaban nakhon&quot;) status. Tha Kham, Na San and Don Sak have town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status. Further 35 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;). The non-municipal areas are administered by 97 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations - SAO (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).

==Economy==
According to the 2008 census, Surat Thani Province recorded a Gross Provincial Product (GPP) of 132,637.3 million baht (approximately US$4,019.31 million). The GPP per capita was reported to be 134,427 baht (around US$4,073.54). This marked an increase from the 2007 census, where the GPP was 122,398 million baht (US$3,599.94 million) and the GPP per capita was 125,651 baht (US$3,695.62). These figures indicate a GPP growth rate of 8.37 percent and a per capita growth rate of 6.98 percent.

Agriculture plays a significant role in Surat Thani&#x27;s economy. The province is noted for its production of coconuts and rambutan. In the case of coconuts, they are often harvested by specially trained monkeys, predominantly pig-tailed macaques (&quot;Macaca nemestrina&quot;). The most renowned training center for these monkeys was established by the late Somporn Saekhow. Rambutan cultivation in Surat Thani traces its roots back to 1926, initiated by Chinese Malay Mr. K. Vong in the Ban Na San District. The province celebrates its rambutan production with an annual fair held in early August, featuring a parade of elaborately decorated floats on the Tapi River. Additionally, rubber tree plantations are widespread throughout Surat Thani, contributing to its agricultural output.

Surat Thani Province is renowned for its unique local products, notably the hand-woven silk cloth originating from the coastal village of Phum Riang in the Chaiya District. This district is also celebrated for producing red eggs, a regional delicacy. For this specialty, ducks are fed a diet of crabs and fish, and their eggs are subsequently preserved in a mixture of soil and salt, lending them a distinctive flavor and color.

Tourism plays a pivotal role in the economy of Surat Thani. In 2018, the province generated a significant revenue of 64 billion baht from tourism activities. This figure represented 63 percent of the total tourism income for Surat Thani, with a substantial portion attributable to its island destinations. These include popular tourist spots such as Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan, Ko Tao, and Mu Ko Ang Thong National Park, which are major contributors to the province&#x27;s tourism sector. 

==Human achievement index 2022==

Since 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the Human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.


==National parks==
* Mu Ko Ang Thong National Park is a marine national park in the Gulf of Thailand. It covers 42 islands and a total area of 102 km2, of which about 50 km2 are land and the rest is water. The park was established on 12 November 1980. The northern tip of Ko Phaluai is also part of the marine park. There is a ranger station, bungalows, a shop, and a restaurant at Ao Phi Beach on Ko Wua Talap.
* Khao Sok National Park is the largest area of virgin forest in southern Thailand and is a remnant of rain forest which is older and more diverse than the Amazon rainforest.

<doc id="180095" wikidata="Q1513688" url="?curid=180095" title="Greek Revival architecture">
<text>Greek Revival architecture was a style that began in the middle of the 18th century but which particularly flourished in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, predominantly in northern Europe, the United States, and Canada, and Greece following that nation&#x27;s independence in 1821. It revived many aspects of the forms and styles of ancient Greek architecture, including the Greek temple. A product of Hellenism, Greek Revival architecture is looked upon as the last phase in the development of Neoclassical architecture, which was drawn from Roman architecture. The term was first used by Charles Robert Cockerell in a lecture he gave as an architecture professor at the Royal Academy of Arts in London in 1842.

With newfound access to Greece and Turkey, or initially to the books produced by the few who had visited the sites, archaeologist–architects of the period studied the Doric and Ionic orders. Despite its universality rooted in ancient Greece, the Greek Revival idiom was considered an expression of local nationalism and civic virtue in each country that adopted it, and freedom from the lax detail and frivolity that then characterized the architecture of France and Italy, two countries where the style never really took architecturally. Greek Revival architecture was embraced in Great Britain, Germany, and the United States, where the idiom was regarded as being free from ecclesiastical and aristocratic associations and was appealed to each country&#x27;s emerging embrace of classical liberalism. 

The taste for all things Greek in furniture and interior design, sometimes called Neo-Grec, reached its peak in the beginning of the 19th century when the designs of Thomas Hope influenced a number of decorative styles known variously as Neoclassical, Empire, Russian Empire, and Regency architecture in Great Britain. Greek Revival architecture took a different course in a number of countries, lasting until the 1860s and the American Civil War and later in Scotland.

Modern-day architects are recreating this design by building houses similar to the Greek Revival. These houses are characterized by their symmetrical and balanced proportions, typically featuring a bold, pedimented portico with arched openings. The symmetrical façade is divided into two equal halves.

==General characteristics==
Much Greek Revival architecture used the Greek Doric order in the earlier version found in buildings leading up to the Parthenon in Athens. This contrasted significantly with later Greek Hellenistic architecture and Roman architecture. Greek Doric columns are typically rather thick, often tapering towards the top, always fluted, and have complicated rules for the entablature above the columns. Additionally, the columns go straight down to the floor (stylobate) with no distinct base - this last aspect was often skipped by architects who followed the other Greek conventions, for example in the Brandenburg Gate.

The understanding of actual Greek architecture was based on ruined buildings, and awareness of the full range of ornamentation, and colour, on ancient Greek temples emerged over the period. Architects were aware of the large pedimental sculptures and metope reliefs, and copied these expensive elements when funds allowed, but far less often had the full range of antefixes and akroterions.

Greek temples normally had no windows except perhaps in the roof, posing a problem for modern buildings for most purposes, which was generally brushed aside. Many buildings that needed to fulfill modern functions concentrated on having an impressive temple-style front, giving the other faces of the building a more practical design up to the cornice.

==Europe==
===Germany and France===

In Germany, Greek Revival architecture is predominantly found in two centres, Berlin and Munich. In both locales, Doric was the court style rather than a popular movement and was heavily patronised by Frederick William II of Prussia and Ludwig I of Bavaria as the expression of their desires for their respective seats to become the capital of Germany. The earliest Greek building was the Brandenburg Gate (1788–91) by Carl Gotthard Langhans, who modelled it loosely on the Propylaea in Athens. Ten years after the death of Frederick the Great, the initiated a competition for a monument to the King that would promote &quot;morality and patriotism.&quot;

Friedrich Gilly&#x27;s unexecuted design for a temple raised above the Leipziger Platz caught the tenor of high idealism that the Germans sought in Greek architecture and was enormously influential on Karl Friedrich Schinkel and Leo von Klenze. Schinkel was in a position to stamp his mark on Berlin after the catastrophe of the French occupation ended in 1813; his work on what is now the Altes Museum, Konzerthaus Berlin, and the Neue Wache transformed that city. Similarly, in Munich von Klenze&#x27;s Glyptothek and Walhalla memorial were the fulfilment of Gilly&#x27;s vision of an orderly and moral German world. The purity and seriousness of the style was intended as an assertion of German national values and partly intended as a deliberate riposte to France, where it never really caught on.

By comparison, Greek Revival architecture in France was never popular with either the state or the public. What little there is started with Charles de Wailly&#x27;s crypt in Saint-Leu-Saint-Gilles de Paris (1773–80), and Claude Nicolas Ledoux&#x27;s Barriere des Bonshommes (1785–89). First-hand evidence of Greek architecture was of very little importance to the French, due to the influence of Marc-Antoine Laugier&#x27;s doctrines that sought to discern the principles of the Greeks instead of their mere practices. It would take until Henri Labrouste&#x27;s Neo-Grec of the Second Empire for Greek Revival architecture to flower briefly in France.

===Great Britain===

Following the travels to Greece, Nicholas Revett, a Suffolk architect, and the better remembered James &quot;Athenian&quot; Stuart in the early 1750s, intellectual curiosity quickly led to a desire among the elite to emulate the style. Stuart was commissioned after his return from Greece by George Lyttelton to produce the first Greek building in England, the garden temple at Hagley Hall (1758–59). A number of British architects in the second half of the century took up the expressive challenge of the Doric from their aristocratic patrons, including Benjamin Henry Latrobe (notably at Hammerwood Park and Ashdown House) and Sir John Soane, but it remained the private enthusiasm of connoisseurs up to the first decade of the 19th century.

An early example of Greek Doric architecture married with a more Palladian interior, is the façade of the Revett-designed rural church of Ayot St Lawrence in Hertfordshire, commissioned in 1775 by Sir Lyonel Lyde, 1st Baronet of the eponymous manor. The Doric columns of this church, with their &quot;pie-crust crimped&quot; details, are taken from drawings that Revett made of the Temple of Apollo on the Cycladic island of Delos, in the collection of books that he (and Stuart in some cases) produced, largely funded by special subscription by the Society of Dilettanti. See more in Terry Friedman&#x27;s book &quot;The Georgian Parish Church&quot;, Spire Books, 2004.

Seen in its wider social context, Greek Revival architecture sounded a new note of sobriety and restraint in public buildings in Britain around 1800 as an assertion of nationalism attendant on the Act of Union, the Napoleonic Wars, and the clamour for political reform. William Wilkins&#x27;s winning design for the public competition for Downing College, Cambridge announced the Greek style was to become a dominant idiom in architecture, especially for public buildings of this sort. Wilkins and Robert Smirke went on to build some of the most important buildings of the era, including the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden (1808–1809), the General Post Office (1824–1829) and the British Museum (1823–1848), the Wilkins Building of University College London (1826–1830), and the National Gallery (1832–1838).

One of the greatest British proponents of the style was Decimus Burton.

In London, twenty three Greek Revival Commissioners&#x27; churches were built between 1817 and 1829, the most notable being St.Pancras church by William and Henry William Inwood. In Scotland the style was avidly adopted by William Henry Playfair, Thomas Hamilton and Charles Robert Cockerell, who severally and jointly contributed to the massive expansion of Edinburgh&#x27;s New Town, including the Calton Hill development and the Moray Estate. Such was the popularity of the Doric in Edinburgh that the city now enjoys a striking visual uniformity, and as such is sometimes whimsically referred to as &quot;the Athens of the North&quot;.

Within Regency architecture the style already competed with Gothic Revival and the continuation of the less stringent Palladian and Neoclassical styles of Georgian architecture, the other two remaining more common for houses, both in towns and English country houses. If it is tempting to see the Greek Revival as the expression of Regency authoritarianism, then the changing conditions of life in Britain made Doric the loser of the Battle of the Styles, dramatically symbolized by the selection of Charles Barry&#x27;s Gothic design for the Palace of Westminster in 1836. Nevertheless, Greek continued to be in favour in Scotland well into the 1870s in the singular figure of Alexander Thomson, known as Greek Thomson.

===Greece===

Following the Greek War of Independence, Romantic Nationalist ideology encouraged the use of historically Greek architectural styles in place of Ottoman or pan-European ones. Classical architecture was used for secular public buildings, while Byzantine architecture was preferred for churches.

Examples of Greek Revival architecture in Greece include the Old Royal Palace (now the home of the Parliament of Greece), the Academy and University of Athens, the Zappeion, and the National Library of Greece. The most prominent architects in this style were northern Europeans such as Christian and Theophil Hansen and Ernst Ziller and German-trained Greeks such as Stamatios Kleanthis and Panagis Kalkos.
Despite the prestige of ancient Greece among Europe&#x27;s educated elite, most people had minimal direct knowledge of the ancient Greek civilization before the middle of the 18th century. The monuments of Greek antiquity were known chiefly from Pausanias and other literary sources. Visiting Ottoman Greece was difficult and dangerous business prior to the period of stagnation beginning with the Great Turkish War. Few tourists visited Athens during the first half of the 18th century, and none made any significant study of the architectural ruins.

It was not until the expedition to Greece funded by the Society of Dilettanti of 1751 by James &quot;Athenian&quot; Stuart and Nicholas Revett that serious archaeological inquiry began in earnest. Stuart and Revett&#x27;s findings, published in 1762 (first volume) as &quot;The Antiquities of Athens&quot;, along with Julien-David Le Roy&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1758) were the first accurate surveys of ancient Greek architecture.

The rediscovery of the three relatively easily accessible Greek temples at Paestum in Southern Italy created huge interest throughout Europe, and prints by Giovanni Battista Piranesi and others were widely circulated. The Napoleonic Wars denied access to France and Italy to traditional Grand Tourists, especially from Britain. Aided by close diplomatic relations between Britain and the Porte, British travellers, artists and architects went to Greece and Turkey in ever larger numbers to study ancient Greek monuments and excavate or collect antiquities. The Greek War of Independence ended in 1832; Lord Byron&#x27;s participation and death during this had brought it additional prominence.

===Russia===

The style was attractive in Russia because they shared the Eastern Orthodox faith with the Greeks. The historic centre of Saint Petersburg was rebuilt by Alexander I of Russia, with many buildings giving the Greek Revival a Russian debut. The Saint Petersburg Bourse on Vasilievsky Island has a temple front with 44 Doric columns. Giacomo Quarenghi&#x27;s design for the Saint Petersburg Manege &quot;mimics a 5th-century BC Athenian temple with a portico of eight Doric columns bearing a pediment and bas reliefs&quot;.

Leo von Klenze&#x27;s expansion of the palace that is now the Hermitage Museum is another example of the style.

===Turkey===

During the late period of the Ottoman Empire, Greek Revival architecture had its examples in the empire. The prominent examples are Istanbul Archaeology Museums (1891)

===Rest of Europe===

The style was generally popular in northern Europe, and not in the south (except for Greece itself), at least during the main period. Examples can be found in Poland, Lithuania, and Finland, where the assembly of Greek buildings in Helsinki city centre is particularly notable. At the cultural edges of Europe, in the Swedish region of western Finland, Greek Revival motifs might be grafted on a purely Baroque design, as in the design for Oravais Church by Jacob Rijf, 1792. A Greek Doric order, rendered in the anomalous form of pilasters, contrasts with the hipped roof and boldly scaled cupola and lantern, of wholly traditional Baroque inspiration.

In Austria, one of the best examples of this style is the Parliament Building designed by Theophil Hansen.

==North America==
===Canada===
In Canada, Montreal architect John Ostell designed a number of prominent Greek Revival buildings, including the first building on the McGill University campus and Montreal&#x27;s original Custom House, now part of the Pointe-à-Callière Museum. The Toronto Street Post Office, completed in 1853, is another Canadian example.

===United States===


While some 18th-century Americans had feared Greek democracy, sometimes called mobocracy, the appeal of ancient Greece rose in the 19th century along with the growing acceptance of democracy. This made Greek architecture suddenly more attractive in both the North and the South, for differing ideological purposes: for the North, Greek architecture symbolized the freedom of the Greeks; in the South it symbolized the cultural glories enabled by a slave society. Thomas Jefferson owned a copy of the first volume of &quot;The Antiquities of Athens&quot;. He never practiced in the style, but he played an important role in introducing Greek Revival architecture to the United States.

In 1803, Jefferson appointed Benjamin Henry Latrobe as surveyor of public building, and Latrobe designed a number of important public buildings in Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia, including work on the United States Capitol and the Bank of Pennsylvania.

Latrobe&#x27;s design for the U.S. Capitol was an imaginative interpretation of the classical orders not constrained by historical precedent, incorporating American motifs such as corncobs and tobacco leaves. This idiosyncratic approach became typical of the American attitude to Greek detailing. His overall plan for the Capitol did not survive, though many of his interiors did. He also did notable work on the Supreme Court chamber interior in the Capitol (1806–1807), and his masterpiece was the Basilica of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary in Baltimore (1805–1821).

Latrobe claimed, &quot;I am a bigoted Greek in the condemnation of the Roman architecture&quot;, but he did not rigidly impose Greek forms. &quot;Our religion,&quot; he said, &quot;requires a church wholly different from the temple, our legislative assemblies and our courts of justice, buildings of entirely different principles from their basilicas; and our amusements could not possibly be performed in their theatres or amphitheatres.&quot; His circle of junior colleagues became an informal school of Greek revivalists, and his influence shaped the next generation of American architects.

Greek revival architecture in the United States also included attention to interior decoration. The role of American women was critical for introducing a wholistic style of Greek-inspired design to American interiors. Innovations such as the Greek-inspired &quot;sofa&quot; and the &quot;klismos chair&quot; allowed both American women and men to pose as Greeks in their homes, and also in the numerous portraits of the period that show them lounging in Greek-inspired furniture.

The second phase in American Greek Revival saw the pupils of Latrobe create a monumental national style under the patronage of banker and philhellene Nicholas Biddle, including such works as the Second Bank of the United States by William Strickland (1824), Biddle&#x27;s home &quot;Andalusia&quot; by Thomas U. Walter (1835–1836), and Girard College, also by Walter (1833–1847). New York saw the construction (1833) of the row of Greek temples at Sailors&#x27; Snug Harbor on Staten Island. These had varied functions within a home for retired sailors.

From 1820 to 1850, the Greek Revival style dominated the United States, such as the Benjamin F. Clough House in Waltham, Massachusetts. It could also be found as far west as Springfield, Illinois. Examples of vernacular Greek Revival continued to be built even farther west, such as in Charles City, Iowa.

This style was very popular in the south of the US, where the Palladian colonnade was already popular in façades, and many mansions and houses were built for the merchants and rich plantation owners; Millford Plantation is regarded as one of the finest Greek Revival residential examples in the country.

Other notable American architects to use Greek Revival designs included Latrobe&#x27;s student Robert Mills, who designed the Monumental Church and the Washington Monument, as well as George Hadfield and Gabriel Manigault.

At the same time, the popular appetite for the Greek was sustained by architectural pattern books, the most important of which was Asher Benjamin&#x27;s &quot;The Practical House Carpenter&quot; (1830). This guide helped create the proliferation of Greek homes seen especially in northern New York State and in Connecticut&#x27;s former Western Reserve in northeastern Ohio.

==Polychromy==
The discovery that the Greeks had painted their temples influenced the later development of the style. The archaeological dig at Aegina and Bassae in 1811–1812 by Cockerell, Otto Magnus von Stackelberg, and Carl Haller von Hallerstein had disinterred painted fragments of masonry daubed with impermanent colours. This revelation was a direct contradiction of Johann Joachim Winckelmann&#x27;s notion of the Greek temple as timeless, fixed, and pure in its whiteness.

In 1823, Samuel Angell discovered the coloured metopes of Temple C at Selinunte, Sicily and published them in 1826. The French architect Jacques Ignace Hittorff witnessed the exhibition of Angell&#x27;s find and endeavoured to excavate Temple B at Selinus. His imaginative reconstructions of this temple were exhibited in Rome and Paris in 1824 and he went on to publish these as &#x27; (1830) and later in &#x27; (1851). The controversy was to inspire von Klenze&#x27;s &quot;Aegina&quot; room at the Munich Glyptothek of 1830, the first of his many speculative reconstructions of Greek colour.

Hittorff lectured in Paris in 1829–1830 that Greek temples had originally been painted ochre yellow, with the moulding and sculptural details in red, blue, green and gold. While this may or may not have been the case with older wooden or plain stone temples, it was definitely not the case with the more luxurious marble temples, where colour was used sparingly to accentuate architectural highlights.

Henri Labrouste also proposed a reconstruction of the temples at Paestum to the in 1829, decked out in startling colour, inverting the accepted chronology of the three Doric temples, thereby implying that the development of the Greek orders did not increase in formal complexity over time, i.e., the evolution from Doric to Corinthian was not inexorable. Both events were to cause a minor scandal. The emerging understanding that Greek art was subject to changing forces of environment and culture was a direct assault on the architectural rationalism of the day.

<text>Tim Hortons Inc., known colloquially as Tim&#x27;s, Timmies, or Timmy&#x27;s, is a Canadian multinational coffeehouse and restaurant chain with headquarters in Toronto; it serves coffee, donuts, sandwiches, breakfast egg muffins and other fast-food items. It is Canada&#x27;s largest quick-service restaurant chain, with 5,701 restaurants in 13 countries, as of .

The company was founded in 1964 in Hamilton, Ontario by Canadian ice hockey player Tim Horton (1930–1974) and Jim Charade (1934–2009), after an initial venture in hamburger restaurants. In 1967, Horton partnered with investor Ron Joyce, who assumed control over operations after Horton died in 1974. Joyce expanded the chain into a multi-billion dollar franchise. Charade left the organization in 1966 and briefly returned in 1970 and 1993 through 1996. The Wendy&#x27;s Company merged with Tim Hortons in 1995 and operated it under their flagship subsidiary until 2006. 

On August 26, 2014, Burger King agreed to merge with Tim Hortons for US$11.4 billion. The two chains became subsidiaries of Toronto-based holding company Restaurant Brands International on December 15, 2014.

==History==
===1964–1989: Tim Horton and Ron Joyce===
 
The business was founded by Tim Horton, who played in the National Hockey League from 1949 until his death in an auto crash in 1974. The first Tim Horton restaurant was in North Bay, Ontario, and sold hamburgers. The chain&#x27;s first donut store opened on May 17, 1964, in Hamilton, Ontario under the name Tim Horton Donuts. The name was later abbreviated to &quot;Tim Horton&#x27;s&quot; and then changed to &quot;Tim Hortons&quot; without the possessive apostrophe.

Soon after Horton opened the store, he met Ron Joyce, a former police constable in Hamilton. In 1965, Joyce took over the fledgling Tim Horton Donut Shop at 65 Ottawa Street North. By 1967, after opening two additional stores, the two became full partners. Upon Horton&#x27;s death in 1974, Joyce bought out the Horton family&#x27;s shares for $1 million and took over as sole owner of the existing chain of 40 stores, quickly and aggressively expanding the chain in both geography and product selection. The 500th store opened in 1991.

Joyce&#x27;s aggressive expansion of the business resulted in major changes to the Canadian coffee and donut restaurant market. Many independent donut shops and small chains were driven out of business, while Canada&#x27;s per-capita ratio of donut shops surpassed that of all other countries.

The Horton and Joyce partnership carried on, with the marriage of Joyce&#x27;s son, Ron Joyce Jr., and Horton&#x27;s eldest daughter, Jeri-Lynn Horton-Joyce, who were joint owners of Tim Hortons franchises in Cobourg, Ontario until 2023 when the couple retired after 37 years.

===1990–2002: Name change and growth===

The company had originally been incorporated as Tim Donut Limited. By the 1990s, the company name had changed to The TDL Group Ltd. This was an effort by the company to diversify the business, removing the primary emphasis on donuts, and continuing the expansion of the menu options as consumer tastes broadened.

Some older locations retain signage with the company&#x27;s name, including a possessive apostrophe, despite the fact that the official styling of the company&#x27;s name has been Tim Hortons without an apostrophe for at least a decade. The company had removed the apostrophe after signs using the apostrophe was interpreted by some to be breaking the language sign laws of the province of Quebec in 1993. The removal of the apostrophe allowed the company to have one common sign image across Canada.

Although a number of Quebec locations have bilingual menu boards, the decision to have both Canadian official languages represented is left to the discretion of individual franchise owners. Some Quebec locations have French-only menu boards. It is the strong recommendation to all the Quebec restaurants from the TDL Group Corporation that they post menu boards in both English and French in accordance with the standards being enforced by the &quot;Office québécois de la langue française&quot;.

====Merger with Wendy&#x27;s====

In 1992, the owner of all Tim Hortons and Wendy&#x27;s restaurants in Prince Edward Island, Daniel P. Murphy, decided to open new franchise outlets for both brands in the same building in the town of Montague. Murphy invited Joyce and Wendy&#x27;s chairman Dave Thomas to the grand opening of the &quot;combo store,&quot; where the two executives met for the first time. Murphy&#x27;s success with combining coffee and donuts with Wendy&#x27;s fast food led to the August 8, 1995, acquisition of and merger with TDL Group by Wendy&#x27;s International, Inc., an American company, which lasted until 2009.

The sale was widely commented on in the media. In 1995, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; had a column reflecting on Tim Hortons &quot;selling out&quot; to Wendy&#x27;s with &quot;the spectacle of another great Canadian icon...gone to Yankee burgerfat&quot;.

===2002–2006: Regaining independence===
Tim Hortons franchises spread rapidly and eventually overtook McDonald&#x27;s as Canada&#x27;s largest food service operator. The company opened twice as many Canadian outlets as McDonald&#x27;s by 2005, and system-wide sales also surpassed those of McDonald&#x27;s Canadian operations as of 2002. The chain accounted for 22.6% of all fast-food industry revenues in Canada in 2005.

Under pressure from major investors Peter May and Nelson Peltz, in late 2005, Wendy&#x27;s announced it would sell between 15% and 18% of the Tim Hortons operations in an initial public offering, which was completed on March 24, 2006, and subsequently said it would spin-off to shareholders its remaining interest by the end of 2006. Wendy&#x27;s cited increased competition between the two chains and Tim Hortons&#x27; increasing self-sufficiency as reasons for its decision, but the company had been under shareholder pressure to make such a move because of the strength and profitability of the Tim Hortons brand.

Shares of the company began trading on March 24, 2006, with an initial public offering of per share, raising over $700 million in the first day of trading. On September 24, Wendy&#x27;s spun off the rest of its shares in Tim Hortons by distributing the remaining 82% to its shareholders. On the same day, Tim Hortons was added to Canada&#x27;s benchmark stock-market indicator, the S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index, and to the S&amp;P/TSX 60.

As of March 2006, Tim Hortons commanded 76% of the Canadian market for baked goods (based on the number of customers served) and held 62% of the Canadian coffee market (compared to Starbucks, in the number two position, at 7%).

===2007–2013: Repatriation===
On June 29, 2009, Tim Hortons Inc. announced that, pending shareholder approval, the chain&#x27;s operations would be reorganized under a new publicly traded company, also named &quot;Tim Hortons Incorporated&quot;, incorporated under the &quot;Canada Business Corporations Act&quot;. The change was being made primarily for tax purposes. On September 28, 2009, Tim Hortons Inc. announced it had completed the reorganization of its corporate structure to become a Canadian public company.
In November 2010, Tim Hortons extended Interac debit payment system acceptance to most of its stores. The company previously began accepting Interac in its stores in Western Canada in 2003 and, later, MasterCard and MasterCard PayPass across most of its stores in 2007. The company often indicated the delay of broader or wider electronic payment acceptance was to &quot;ensure speed of service.&quot; In 2012, Tim Hortons began accepting Visa cards, and in 2013, began accepting American Express cards.

In late 2013, Tim Hortons had &quot;4,350 cafes across the world, out of which 3,500 are in Canada, 817 in the U.S. and 33 in the GCC. The Toronto Stock Exchange listed company recorded revenues of $794 million and net profit of $111 million in the September quarter.&quot;

===2014: Merger with Burger King===
On August 24, 2014, American fast-food chain Burger King announced that it was in negotiations to merge with Tim Hortons Inc; the proposed $18 billion mergers would involve a tax inversion into Canada, with a new holding company majority-owned by 3G Capital, and the remaining shares in the company held by current Burger King and Tim Hortons shareholders. A Tim Hortons representative stated that the proposed merger would allow Tim Hortons to leverage Burger King&#x27;s resources for international growth; the two chains would retain separate operations post-merger. News of the proposal caused Tim Hortons&#x27; shares to increase in value by 28 percent.

On August 25, 2014, Burger King officially confirmed its intent to acquire Tim Hortons Inc. in a deal totaling (US$11.4 billion). 3G Capital offered to purchase the company at $65.50 per share, with existing shareholders receiving $65.50 in cash and 0.8025 shares in the new holding company: per-share—all-cash ($88.50) and all-shares (3.0879) options were also made available. The agreement planned to result in 3G Capital (which held a 71% majority stake in Burger King) holding a 51% majority stake in the new company, Tim Hortons&#x27; existing shareholders owning 22%, and Burger King&#x27;s owning 27% with the new entity based in Oakville and listed on both the TSX and New York Stock Exchange. Per the agreement, Burger King CEO Daniel Schwartz became CEO of the company, with existing Tim Hortons CEO Marc Caira becoming vice-chairman and director; Burger King still operated out of its existing headquarters in Miami. It was announced the deal would form the third-largest fast-food restaurant company in the world. On October 28, 2014, the deal was approved by the Competition Bureau of Canada, but had yet to be approved by Industry Canada. The Bureau ruled that the deal was &quot;unlikely to result in a substantial lessening or prevention of competition.&quot;

Former CEO Marc Caira reassured the integrity of Tim Hortons following the purchase, stating that the acquisition would &quot;enable us to move more quickly and efficiently to bring Tim Hortons iconic Canadian brand to a new global customer base.&quot; On October 30, 2014, various media covered a Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives study which suggested that Burger King&#x27;s proposed takeover of Tim Hortons is &quot;likely to have overwhelmingly negative consequences for Canadians.&quot; This study analyzed Burger King&#x27;s private equity owner, 3G Capital, and past takeovers of Burger King, Heinz, and Anheuser-Busch, and declared that &quot;it has a 30-year history of aggressive cost cutting, which could hurt Tim Hortons employees, small-businesspeople, Canadian taxpayers, and consumers.&quot;

The deal was approved by Minister of Industry James Moore (of the governing Conservative Party of Canada) on December 4, 2014: The two companies agreed to Moore&#x27;s conditions, requiring that the Burger King and Tim Hortons chains retain separate operations and not combine locations, maintain &quot;significant employment levels&quot; at the Oakville headquarters, and ensure that Canadians make up at least 50% of Tim Hortons&#x27; board of directors. Tim Hortons shareholders approved the merger on December 9, 2014; the two chains merged under the new parent company Restaurant Brands International (RBI), which began trading on December 15, 2014. According to CBC News, &quot;how the government will enforce [Moore&#x27;s] conditions is unclear.&quot;

=== 2015–present ===

In May 2015, the company announced the closure of its U.S. headquarters in Dublin, Ohio; in March 2015, it had 127 employees. In August 2016, Tim Hortons again changed presidents. In September 2016, Tim Hortons announced it would be expanding into the United Kingdom, with an unannounced number of locations to be built.
Revenue in 2015 for Restaurant Brands International was US$4.0522 billion with a rise to $4.15 billion in 2016. Tim Hortons had 683 U.S. locations by the end of 2016, and total annual revenue of US$3.00 billion.

In April 2018, Tim Hortons announced that they would be moving their head office along with its 400 employees to the Exchange Tower in downtown Toronto.

In May 2018, the Reputation Institute reported that Tim Hortons had fallen from 13th to 67th in its study of Canada&#x27;s most reputable companies, as &quot;one of the largest moves down of all 250 companies it analyzed this year&#x27;&quot; and that the brand was &quot;still considered to have a &#x27;strong reputation.&#x27;&quot;

In October 2018, Tim Hortons began to install self-serve kiosks at some locations in Ontario. In February 2019, Tim Hortons began to spread the installation of the self-serve kiosks across Canada.

==Locations==

On December 31, 2018, Tim Hortons had 4,846 restaurants in 14 countries, including 3,802 in Canada, 807 in the United States, 60 in Mexico, 29 in the Middle East, and 25 in the UK. , Tim Hortons has 5,702 restaurants.
Tim Hortons had a presence on a number of military bases, including Kandahar in Afghanistan, although this latter outlet was principally intended for Canadian Armed Forces and allied military personnel. Three more outlets were in military bases at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, Fort Knox, Kentucky, and Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia. The latest location is at Camp Adazi in Latvia.

===North America===
Tim Hortons originally was concentrated in Ontario and Atlantic Canada. However, the chain has expanded its presence into Quebec and western Canada. Its location in Iqaluit, Nunavut, was the northernmost store as of 2010. Its location in Pond Inlet, Nunavut is the northernmost store as of .

TDL Group recorded $1.48 billion in sales in 2005. Tim Hortons also operates locations on Canadian and American university campuses, including Brock University, Durham College, Georgian College, Algonquin College, Canisius College, York University, Toronto Metropolitan University, University at Buffalo, SUNY Plattsburgh, University of British Columbia, Memorial University of Newfoundland, University of Western Ontario, and Simon Fraser University.

In March 2010, Tim Hortons announced further expansion on both sides of the Canada–US border to be completed by 2013. The plan called for 600 new stores in Canada (primarily in Quebec and Western Canada but also including smaller communities) and 300 new stores in the U.S. (primarily in its existing markets of Michigan, New York, and Ohio). It also called for expansion into such non-standard store locations as hospitals, universities, and airports, as well as extending its co-branding initiative with U.S. ice cream chain Cold Stone Creamery, which began in 2009, to cover 60 Canadian stores and 25 to 35 new and existing U.S. stores. It also included testing a new café/bake shop concept in at least 10 existing U.S. locations, including &quot;enhanced finishes, fixtures, and seating areas&quot; as well as an expansion of menu offerings.

In 2010, Tim Hortons opened what were then its northernmost locations: three kiosks at NorthMart stores in Iqaluit, Nunavut. This expanded Tim Hortons&#x27; presence in every province and territory of Canada. According to Nick Javor, senior vice-president of corporate affairs at Tim Hortons, &quot;You could say it&#x27;s overdue. If we can be in Kandahar, why can&#x27;t we be in Iqaluit?&quot;

In December 2011, Tim Hortons opened its 4,000th restaurant. In 2012, Tim Hortons Inc. recorded its total revenues at $3.12 billion (CDN).

====United States====
Initially, the U.S. stores were the result of natural expansion in Canada–U.S. border areas (e.g., stores in Maine and the Buffalo, New York area where Horton played from 1972 to 1974 as a member of the Buffalo Sabres). The first United States locations were opened in Deerfield Beach, Florida and Pompano Beach, Florida in 1981, but they proved unsuccessful and were closed.

In 1984, the chain returned to the U.S. with a location in Tonawanda, New York. Starting in the mid-1990s, however, the chain began expanding in the U.S. by acquiring former locations from fast-food chains. In 1996 and 1997, thirty-seven former Rax locations in Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia were bought by Wendy&#x27;s International Inc.; 30 of these were converted to Tim Hortons, while the others became Wendy&#x27;s franchise locations. Thirty-five closed Hardee&#x27;s stores in the Detroit area were also purchased with the intention of being converted. By 2004, the chain had also acquired 42 Bess Eaton coffee and donut restaurants in southern New England. Several combination Wendy&#x27;s/Tim Hortons units were opened in the US; both in the &quot;traditional&quot; markets of Maine and Buffalo, where there were well over 180 locations as of 2011, and in the markets entered through acquisition.

In October 2008, Tim Hortons announced a plan to add 82 locations in Tops Markets stores in the United States.

On July 13, 2009, Tim Hortons opened stores in New York City at former Dunkin&#x27; Donuts locations operated by the Riese Organization. One of the stores is at Madison Square Garden, where Horton played as a member of the New York Rangers from 1969 to 1971. In November 2010, Tim Hortons announced it was closing 36 stores in the northeastern United States due to high competition with New England–based Dunkin&#x27; Donuts and Au Bon Pain. The stores, which made less than half the average company per-store sales, were concentrated heavily in the areas around Providence, Rhode Island and Hartford, Connecticut, the former of which also has a concentration of stores from the locally competing Honey Dew Donuts chain, with some 150 outlets in Rhode Island and Southeastern Massachusetts. In the announcement, the chain stated that it will concentrate its efforts on its core markets such as western Canada. In the same statement, the company announced the sale of its portion of distribution company Maidstone Bakeries to Tim Hortons&#x27; European partners. It will use the generated by the sale for a stock buyback.

In 2010, Tim Hortons opened two kiosks at Consol Energy Center (now known as PPG Paints Arena) in Pittsburgh, partly as a test to eventual expansion into Pittsburgh (their closest locations at that point were in the Wheeling, West Virginia/Steubenville, Ohio area) as well as Pittsburgh Penguins star Sidney Crosby having a longtime sponsorship with the chain as well. In addition, Horton played for the Maple Leafs American Hockey League affiliate, the Pittsburgh Hornets, earlier in his career as well as the Penguins for one season in 1971 to 1972. Aramark, which operated the kiosks, closed them in 2012, however Tim Hortons proceeded to open full-service locations in Pittsburgh and surrounding areas in July 2012. At the time of the entry into Pittsburgh, of the four NHL cities Horton played in (Buffalo, New York City, Toronto, and Pittsburgh), Pittsburgh was the only one without a Tim Hortons location, and was also where Horton met his future wife, Lori.

In 2011, Tim Hortons aggressively expanded into the Grand Rapids, Michigan region.

In 2012, Tim Hortons began advertising in the Youngstown, Ohio, area in anticipation of an eventual expansion into the Mahoning Valley. The closest location at the time was in Calcutta, Ohio, about 50 miles south of Youngstown. The chain entered the area in July 2012 with the opening of a location in Hermitage, Pennsylvania. This location has since closed, but Tim Hortons would return to the market in the spring of 2019 with the opening of two locations, one in Youngstown and one in Girard, Ohio, though both would suddenly close within weeks of each other by the end of the year.

As of 2012, the company had expanded across the U.S. states of Connecticut, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and West Virginia.

On January 7, 2014, Tim Hortons opened a kiosk in what&#x27;s now the Desert Diamond Arena (where the former Arizona Coyotes of the NHL used to play) in Glendale, Arizona. On March 5, 2014, The Arizona Coyotes announced that as of March 10, 2014, the Tim Hortons stand would be open to the public from 9:00 to 15:00, seven days a week. This location is the first Tim Hortons in Arizona. A flagship Tim Hortons location within the Buffalo area opened across from the KeyBank Center (then First Niagara Center) at the LECOM Harborcenter complex on October 29, 2014.

In 2016, Tim Hortons expanded to Minnesota with a store inside Mall of America. However, this location is closed. In 2017, the chain announced an expansion to Northeast Ohio with 105 stores to come to the greater Cleveland area. The first of these opened in the Ellet neighborhood of Akron in July 2019.

In 2020, Tim Hortons partnered with Bolla Market to open &quot;15 to 20 over the next 12 to 18 months&quot; across Long Island. The stores are located inside gas stations.

In 2022, Tim Hortons announced a planned expansion into Georgia and Texas. Over the next five years, it plans to open over 20 new stores in the Atlanta and Columbus, Georgia, areas plus greater Houston, Texas, and Nashville, Tennessee.

==== Cayman Islands ====
On April 4, 2023, Tim Hortons announced a new location in Prospect, Grand Cayman. This will be the first Tim Hortons in the Caribbean. The location is first of many planned in the Cayman Islands. The menu will have all the original items, as well as freshly sliced deli sandwiches. The store opened on October 12, 2024.

===Asia===

Tim Hortons reportedly had plans by 2013 to enter the large Indian market, which the company denied. In an effort to expand the company following its 2014 merger with Burger King into Restaurant Brands International, Tim Hortons began expansion in Asia in 2017 citing the increasing demand for coffee in large populations. The first Southeast Asian branch was opened in the Philippines on February 28, 2017, at Uptown Mall in Bonifacio Global City, Taguig. Siera Bearchell, Miss Universe Canada 2016, was present for the ribbon-cutting ceremony. , there are 52 locations operating in the Philippines.

Through franchise partnership with Dubai-based Apparel Group, Tim Hortons entered the United Arab Emirates in 2011 with locations in Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Fujairah. The first opening took place in September 2011. As of December 2013, Tim Hortons has nineteen stores in the United Arab Emirates, two in Oman and two in Saudi Arabia. They plan to open up to one hundred and twenty stores over the next five years in the Persian Gulf area, with a focus on Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates. Kuwait has Tim Hortons at The Gate Mall in Egaila, at Promenade Mall in Hawalli, and at The Avenues Mall at Al Rai.

===Europe===
====United Kingdom and Ireland====
Tim Hortons&#x27; products have been available in Ireland and the United Kingdom at some Spar convenience stores since 2006 and Tesco supermarkets. Tim Hortons&#x27; other international expansions include a small outlet at the Dublin Zoo. Tim Hortons coffee and donuts were being sold at small self-service counters in 50 Spar stores in the UK and Ireland as of April 30, 2007.

In 2016, Tim Hortons announced that they would be opening stores in the United Kingdom starting in 2017. Glasgow saw the first UK store open its doors on June 2, 2017, with a further store opening in Bishopbriggs in November 2017. In November 2017, two stores in Cardiff opened, as well as a store opening in Dunfermline. In December 2017, two further stores were opened in Trafford in the towns of Sale and Altrincham.

By January this had increased to 73 locations, with at least a further three locations in development.
In March 2023 they opened a branch in Westwood Cross in Thanet, Kent.

Ireland&#x27;s first Tim Hortons was opened in Limerick, in 2022.

====Spain====

In December 2017, Tim Hortons opened two stores in the centre of Madrid and later opened another in the city of Pozuelo de Alarcón in the Community of Madrid. The menu also includes typical Spanish drinks apart from the typical drinks of a Tim Hortons.

====Andorra====
Despite the fact that the Principality of Andorra is a sovereign country, the Tim Hortons shop in El Pas de la Casa, Andorra, is listed on the Spanish Tim Hortons website.

==Menu==
Tim Hortons&#x27; first stores offered only two products – coffee and donuts. Aside from its coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and donuts, the menu now contains a number of other baked goods, such as bagels – of which the brand sells one out of every two in the Canadian food service industry. Nutritional information on most menu items is made available by the company in a two-page brochure and online. The brochure does not list ingredient information.
Most of the time Tim Hortons&#x27; menu contains many of the same items across different locations. However, the pricing may vary since it is a franchise so the cost of each item may be slightly different depending on the owner of the location, as well as the province in which the franchise operates.

===Coffee and beverages===

Tim Hortons sells coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and soft drinks. In the mid-1990s the chain moved into specialty and premium items such as flavoured cappuccino, iced cappuccino, and iced coffee.

Despite an expansion in their food offerings around 2009, the brand remained heavily dependent on coffee sales. In 2009, it was reported that 60% of their sales occur in the morning, and of that more than 50% is coffee. The coffee served is a blend of 100% arabica beans. The &quot;original blend&quot; is a medium, balanced roast that is the most popular served coffee in Canada. The chain has an &quot;always fresh&quot; policy where coffee is served within 20 minutes of brewing.

In November 2011, the company announced that they would be adding espresso machines in 1,000 of their locations, later that month. On April 16, 2012, the brand launched frozen lemonade, in two flavours: original and raspberry. On August 15, 2014, the company added a dark roast coffee blend as an alternative.

===Food items===
The menu contains a number of other baked goods, such as donut holes (branded as Timbits), muffins, croissants, tea biscuits, cookies, rolls, danishes, and bagels. The dutchie is a Canadian donut popularized by the Tim Hortons chain.

Since the mid-1990s, the chain has moved into other areas beyond donut and coffee, including specialty items such as New York-style cheesecake, as well as a selection of food items for lunch that include soups, chili, and submarine sandwiches. In the autumn of 2006, the chain released out a breakfast sandwich, consisting of either a biscuit, English muffin, or bagel sandwiched with an egg patty, processed cheese slice, and ham, bacon, or sausage. In October 2007, they launched a chicken fajita wrap, which contained spiced chicken and sautéed vegetables. This was discontinued and replaced a year later with the barbecue and ranch chicken wrap snackers. In December 2007, they introduced hash browns and the &quot;Bagel B.E.L.T.&quot;, a breakfast sandwich of bacon, egg, lettuce, and tomato on a bagel. In February 2009, they announced co-branding with American ice cream parlour Cold Stone Creamery. The deal called for each chain to convert 50 stores into dual-operation franchises, for a total of 100 stores. The idea was successfully tested at two stores in Rhode Island. Despite this expansion, the brand remained heavily dependent on coffee sales. In February 2014, Tim Hortons announced that the dutchie timbit was discontinued due to low popularity.

Despite being offered at other major Canadian restaurant chains, poutine (largely seen as Canada&#x27;s signature dish), had never been a regular menu item at Tim Hortons. In June 2018, Tim Hortons introduced a limited time poutine across Canada, using seasoned potato wedges instead of the typical French fries. The poutine received mixed responses on social media.

In Canada, the company began to offer hamburgers on the lunch menu in 2017. In an attempt to attract customers with a healthier option, Tim Hortons offered a hamburger filled with the &quot;Beyond Meat&quot; meatless option. The offering of hamburgers was risky for the company in their attempt to compete with the popular, large hamburger chains such as McDonald&#x27;s. Wendy&#x27;s and Burger King in Canada. Ironically, Burger King had acquired Tim Hortons in 2014 and was running it as a separate subsidiary and had supply chain mechanisms already in place to supply Tim Hortons with hamburger items. However, after only a brief period, consumers did not respond well to Tim Hortons offering of hamburgers or the &quot;Beyond Meat&quot; variety. With poor national sales, subsequently in 2019, hamburgers were removed from the menus at the Canadian Tim Horton&#x27;s stores.

On May 15, 2023, Tim Hortons introduced two new lunch and dinner menu items in Canada: the BBQ Crispy Chicken Loaded Bowl and the BBQ Crispy Chicken Loaded Wrap. Both items are made with a crispy chicken breast coated in a bold and smoky barbecue glaze, and are then mixed with grains, lettuce, freshly diced tomatoes and cucumbers, and a &quot;savoury, creamy&quot; barbecue sauce.

On April 17, 2024, Tim Hortons introduced flatbread pizzas to expand on their lunch/dinner menu. The pizzas are available in four flavours: bacon everything, chicken parmesan, pepperoni, and simply cheese. The fifth flavour Spicy Rosé was introduced in October 2024.

====Baking methods and lawsuit====
Coupled with the expansion and the expanded menu came the outsourcing of baked goods. Donuts, which used to be made at night to be ready for the morning rush, are now parbaked – partly cooked and then frozen and delivered to every restaurant in Canada from Brantford, Ontario. Each restaurant bakes and finishes the product throughout the day. , many of the various muffin batters were being revoked, as frozen, pre-made and pre-wrapped muffins were being introduced at Tim Hortons locations.

Tim Hortons&#x27; switch to the parbaking system disappointed some customers, who noted that it contradicts the chain&#x27;s &quot;always fresh&quot; slogan. David Swick reported in the &quot;Halifax Daily News&quot; on September 19, 2003, that Tim Hortons outlets in Atlantic Canada would no longer serve fresh donuts, but rather donuts that had been remotely factory-fried and then frozen and shipped. In 2008, two franchisees initiated a class-action lawsuit against the parent company for the switch to parbaking, &quot;claiming breach of contract, breach of duty of fair dealing, negligent misrepresentation, and unjust enrichment&quot;. The lawsuit cited that parbaking tripled the franchisee&#x27;s fixed cost to produce a donut (from 6 cents per donut to 18 cents), required the purchase of new freezers and microwaves, and reduced profitability for the franchises while increasing profits for the parent company. Franchise owners are required to purchase food products from the Brantford-based parbaking company owned by IAWS Group PLC, and had originally been told the price of each donut would be 11 or 12 cents (and each Timbit 4.6 cents). The case was dismissed in February 2012.

A 2009 &quot;New York Times&quot; article contrasted the baked from scratch at stores&#x27; approach of Krispy Kreme and some Dunkin&#x27; Donuts locations compared to the &quot;flash frozen&quot; and shipped Tim Hortons method. The &quot;Times&quot; article also noted an apparent scarcity of donut specialties such as the dutchie at newly opened Tim Hortons stores in New York City. Noting that &quot;American visitors tend to flock to the sweets,&quot; including the &quot;raisin-studded Dutchie&quot;, the &quot;Times&quot; found redemption among Canadians that the brand was once again a Canada-based company while contrasting the way politicians in the U.S. &quot;woo&quot; soccer moms while in Canada they &quot;go after Tim Hortons voters&quot;.

==Marketing==

Tim Hortons&#x27; advertising slogans have included &quot;You&#x27;ve Always Got Time for Tim Hortons&quot; and starting in the mid-2000s, &quot;Always Fresh. Always Tim Hortons.&quot;

&quot;Canadian Business&quot; named Tim Hortons as the best-managed brand in Canada in 2004 and 2005.

From 2005 to 2023, Tim Hortons was the title sponsor of the Brier, the annual Canadian men&#x27;s curling championships, along with the Canadian Ringette Championships.

Shortly before December 2007, Tim Hortons gift certificates were discontinued and replaced with the Quickpay Tim Card.

In September 2006, Tim Hortons courted controversy by mandating that employees were not to wear red as part of the Red Fridays campaign by families of the military to show support for Canadian troops. Within a few hours, Tim Hortons partially reversed its position and has allowed staff in Ontario stores to wear red ribbons or pins to show support for the wear red on Fridays campaign.

In June 2009, Tim Hortons USA created Twitter and Facebook pages to drive online traffic. After Tim Hortons had agreed to provide 250 cups of free coffee in 2009 for a &quot;Marriage and Family Day&quot; hosted by the National Organization for Marriage, the company removed its sponsorship after it was revealed that the NOM was an organization that campaigns against gay marriage. The company stated the sponsorship was a violation of the company&#x27;s policy not to sponsor events &quot;representing religious groups, political affiliates or lobby groups.&quot;
On July 12, 2013, it was announced that Tim Hortons had acquired the naming rights to the stadium being built in Hamilton, Ontario. In 2014, Tim Hortons Field became the home stadium of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats.

In June 2015, Tim Hortons pulled a four-week advertising campaign by energy company Enbridge from its in-store &quot;Tims TV&quot; service after three weeks following a petition by the advocacy group, SumOfUs. Despite the ads being part of a general &quot;Life Takes Energy&quot; campaign introduced by Enbridge the previous year, the group argued that Tim Hortons&#x27; airing of the ads implied an endorsement of controversial projects under development by Enbridge, such as the Northern Gateway pipeline, going on to say that &quot;Enbridge&#x27;s ad campaign uses attractive actors, cute kids and high production values to hide the real truth—its tar sands project will put ecosystems, salmon and wildlife in danger, create virtually no local jobs, and accelerate climate change.&quot; The decision to pull the ads, however, resulted in a boycott of Tim Hortons led by Wildrose Party leader Brian Jean, who felt that the decision was an attack on Alberta&#x27;s oil industry because Enbridge is one of the province&#x27;s top-employing companies.

In November 2021, the chain began a promotion with Toronto singer Justin Bieber, which included the release of limited edition &quot;Tim Biebs&quot; Timbits and accompanying merchandise.

Tim Hortons is also the primary sponsor of Forge FC a Canadian professional soccer club based in Hamilton, Ontario. The sponsorship aligns with Tim Hortons&#x27; commitment to supporting Canadian sports, particularly soccer, which has seen increasing popularity in the country

As part of the brand&#x27;s 60th anniversary celebrations in 2024, a musical titled &quot;The Last Timbit&quot; was produced at the Elgin and Winter Garden Theatres in Toronto.

===Canadian cultural fixture===

Tim Hortons is popularly known as &quot;Timmies&quot; or &quot;Timmy&#x27;s&quot;. The ubiquity of Tim Hortons, through the wide expansion of its outlets, makes it a prominent feature of Canadian life; Canadians eat more donuts per capita and have more donut outlets per capita than any other nation. Tim Hortons&#x27; prevalence in the coffee and donut market has led to its branding as a Canadian cultural icon. The media routinely refer to its iconic status, despite this being a relatively recent development; there were only a few outlets before the chain&#x27;s expansion in the late 1990s and 2000s. A series of Tim&#x27;s television commercials promotes this idea by showing vignettes of Canadians abroad and their homesickness for Tim Hortons. Canadian author Pierre Berton once wrote: &quot;In so many ways the story of Tim Hortons is the essential Canadian story. It is a story of success and tragedy, of big dreams and small towns, of old-fashioned values and tough-fisted business, of hard work and of hockey.&quot; Commentator Rex Murphy posited that the reason Tim Hortons &quot;transmuted into a hallowed piece of Canadiana&quot; was perhaps consumers&#x27; &quot;reverse-preference&quot; against the sudden penetration of Starbucks in the 1990s.

Other commentators have bemoaned the rise of Tim Hortons as a national symbol. Rudyard Griffiths, director of The Dominion Institute, wrote in the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; in July 2006 that the ascension of the chain to the status of a cultural icon was a &quot;worrying sign&quot; for Canadian nationalism, adding, &quot;Surely Canada can come up with a better moniker than the Timbit Nation.&quot;

The recognition of Tim Hortons as a Canadian icon has permeated into American culture as the result of product placement efforts in conjunction with a marketing agency. In the American situational comedy &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;, while standing in a Tim Hortons &quot;just around the corner from the Hockey Hall of Fame&quot;, Robin, played by Canadian actress Cobie Smulders, called the location the &quot;most Canadian place in the universe&quot;. The chain has embraced this comment as an unofficial slogan and has used it in promotional advertisements to emphasize its fixture in modern Canadian culture. The chain has been featured in the TV series &quot;Homeland&quot;. Another TV show that has Tim Hortons products making an appearance is &quot;The Last Ship&quot;.

Stan Mikita&#x27;s Donuts from the movie &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; is supposed to be a parody of Tim Hortons.

Kahala, the parent company of Cold Stone Creamery, announced in February 2009 that it had reached an agreement with Tim Hortons to open up to 100 co-branded stores in the United States after successfully testing two locations in Rhode Island. The most notable co-branded store opened in August 2009 when Tim Hortons moved into three Cold Stone Creamery locations in New York City, including its flagship Times Square location.

In June 2009, Cold Stone Creamery started testing the Canadian market by opening its six co-branded locations with Tim Hortons in Ontario, and began expanding its test markets in Canada, including Alberta, Nova Scotia, Ontario, New Brunswick, and British Columbia, and in the summer of 2010, Cold Stone Creamery moved into six Tim Hortons locations in Quebec and one in each of Charlottetown, and Summerside, PEI. However, in February 2014, Tim Hortons chief executive Marc Caira announced that they will be pulling Cold Stone Creamery from all its Canadian restaurants, although Tim Hortons would maintain its locations in the United States.

====Military partnerships====

Tim Hortons has outlets on at least seven Canadian Forces Bases. TDL Group announced in March 2006, in response to a request by Chief of the Defence Staff, General Rick Hillier, its commitment to open a franchised location at the Canadian Forces operations base in Kandahar, Afghanistan. The new Kandahar location opened on July 1, 2006, in a trailer on the military base. The 41 staff members of the Kandahar outlet have been drawn from the Canadian Forces Personnel Support Agency who received training on such matters as how to handle a potential nuclear weapons or biological weapons attack before working at the military base. The Canadian Federal government subsidized the operation of the Kandahar outlet in the order of CAD$4–5 million per year. The Kandahar Tim Hortons closed on November 29, 2011, after serving four million cups of coffee and three million donuts over five years.

The first Tim Hortons outlet at a U.S. military base was opened in 2009 at Fort Knox. The following year, a second Tim Hortons outlet was opened at Naval Station Norfolk. , Tim Hortons has five outlets open on four U.S. military bases. Besides the first two, they are also at Naval Air Station Oceana and two locations at the Aberdeen Proving Ground.

===Roll Up the Rim to Win campaign===

Each February, Tim Hortons holds a marketing campaign titled &quot;Roll Up the Rim to Win&quot;. As of 2007, over 31 million prizes were distributed each year, including cars, televisions, and store products. Customers determine if they have won prizes by unrolling the rim on their paper cups when they have finished their drink, revealing the result underneath. Prizes are not distributed randomly country-wide; each of the company&#x27;s distribution regions has distinct prize-winning odds. The idea for the campaign began in 1985 when Roger Wilson of one of Tim Hortons&#x27; supplier of cups, Lily Cup company, approached Tim Hortons with a new idea to increase their sales. Wilson explained his company had created a new cup design that allowed a message to be printed under the rim; the cup type cost no more than the current one and could enable a promotion or contest. Recognizing the opportunity to promote coffee in the normally weak sales period in the spring, the Roll Up the Rim to Win campaign was first held in 1986 when the biggest prize was a snack box of Timbits. In 2008, over 88% of major prizes were redeemed.

The contest is popular enough that Paul Kind invented the Rimroller (as seen on &quot;Dragons&#x27; Den&quot;), a device for rolling up the rim mechanically.

In honour of Canada&#x27;s sesquicentennial, a special edition of the Roll Up the Rim promotion was held in July 2017, with prizes including an &quot;Ultimate Canadian Vacation&quot; valued at $10,000.

The contest has seen several controversies including the theft of unrolled cups. In March 2006, two families were fighting over a Toyota RAV4 SUV prize of value when their daughters found a winning &quot;roll up the rim&quot; coffee cup in a garbage bin of an elementary school in Saint-Jérôme, Quebec. The younger girl had found a cup in the garbage bin and could not roll up the rim, so she requested the help of an older girl. Once the winning cup was revealed, the older girl&#x27;s family stated that they deserved the prize. Tim Hortons originally stated that they would not intervene in the dispute. A further complication arose when Quebec lawyer Claude Archambault requested a DNA test be done on the cup. He claimed that his unnamed client had thrown out the cup and was the rightful recipient of the prize. On April 19, 2006, Tim Hortons announced that they had decided to award the prize to the younger girl who had initially found the cup. The company has also faced concerns over the amount of additional litter generated by the promotion.

In 2018, Tim Hortons began to add digital components to the promotion, via the &quot;Scroll Up the Rim&quot; feature (which gave players a chance at food prizes) on the chain&#x27;s mobile app. In 2020, as part of environmental initiatives and to promote the chain&#x27;s new Tims Rewards loyalty program, Tim Hortons announced that it would only distribute Roll Up the Rim cups during the first two weeks of the campaign. Each eligible purchase by a Tims Rewards member during the first half of the promotion was to earn two electronic entries, and one electronic entry in the second two weeks, redeemable via the Tims Rewards mobile app. Any purchase using a reusable cup was to award three entries.

On March 7, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Tim Hortons announced that it had cancelled the distribution of physical cups for the promotion due to concerns that the virus could be spread by returned cups, and that the promotion would be conducted solely via the app. The chain had also joined others in temporarily prohibiting the use of reusable cups for similar reasons. The changes from 2020 remained in use for 2021, with the promotion therefore being renamed to &quot;Roll Up to Win&quot;. In addition, Tim Hortons announced that every electronic entry would be guaranteed to win Tims Rewards points at a minimum.

==Community involvement==

Tim Hortons sponsor community outreach programs including Free Skating, Free Swimming, Earn-a-Bike Program, Remembrance Day, Food Drives, the Smile Cookie program (not to be confused with the similar Smiley Cookie sold at regional chain Eat&#x27;n Park), Enactus, as well as a community clean-up project.

The store promotes itself through the Tim Horton Children&#x27;s Foundation. Founded by Ron Joyce, the foundation sponsors thousands of underprivileged children from Canada and the United States to go to one of six high-class summer camps in Parry Sound, Ontario; Tatamagouche, Nova Scotia; Kananaskis Country, Alberta; Quyon, Quebec; Campbellsville, Kentucky; St. George, Ontario; and most recently Whiteshell Provincial Park, Manitoba.

The foundation&#x27;s highest-profile fundraiser is Camp Day, held annually on the Wednesday of the first full week in June. All proceeds from coffee sales at most Tim Hortons locations, as well as proceeds from related activities held that day, are donated to the foundation. Small stores in Esso Service Stations do not donate coffee proceeds on Camp Day.

Joyce&#x27;s work with the Tim Horton Children&#x27;s Foundation earned him the Gary Wright Humanitarian Award in 1991, presented periodically in recognition of contributions to the betterment of community life throughout Canada. In recognition primarily for his work with the Foundation, he received an appointment to the Order of Canada, with the official presentation taking place on October 21, 1992, in Ottawa.
Tim Hortons became a sponsor of Hockey Canada in December 2019, including the presenting sponsor of the Centennial Cup, the national junior &quot;A&quot; ice hockey championship and one of the major sponsors of Canada&#x27;s national ice hockey teams.

==Controversies==
===Great White North Franchisee Association===
The Great White North Franchisee Association, formed in 2017, represented Tim Hortons franchises involved in a series of ongoing disputes with the head office of Tim Hortons due to frustrations with Restaurant Brands International (the parent company of Tim Hortons and Burger King). GWNFA has filed class-action lawsuits against the Restaurant Brands International over the handling of the Ontario minimum wage hike (see below), inflated head office pricing, and misuse of their advertising funds.

===Ontario minimum wage===
Tim Hortons became the subject of controversy after the raise of the minimum wage in Ontario from $11.60 to $14.00 an hour which was made effective January 2018. The minimum wage increase was strongly criticized by the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, Restaurants Canada, and the Canadian Franchise Association. Restaurant Brands International did not help franchisees offset the wage hike, refusing to reduce the supply costs that it charged Tim Hortons franchisees, nor did it permit franchisees to raise menu prices in order to offset the wage hikes (in contrast to McDonald&#x27;s, Cara Foods and Starbucks who did allow menu price increases in Ontario to cope with the wage increases). Tim Hortons franchisees, many of them small business owners who employed an average of 35 staff (the wage hike would cost the franchisee $7,000 per employee a year), responded by cutting employee benefits such as paid breaks and contributions to health plans. In one case, owners posted a memo encouraging employees to contact the Ontario Premier, Kathleen Wynne, and indicate that they &quot;will not vote Liberal in the coming Ontario election in June 2018.&quot; Wynne responded by saying &quot;I&#x27;m happy to talk to any business owner about the minimum wage but taking it out on employees is not fair and not acceptable.&quot; Around 50 demonstrations were held across Canada, including 38 in Ontario, in response to the benefit cuts. The minimum wage controversy hurt the chain&#x27;s reputation; usually placing in the top 10 of the Leger research poll for the top 10 companies or brands in Canada, Tim Hortons dropped from 4th place in 2017 to 50th in 2018.

===Plastics pollution===

Named as one of the top five plastic polluters in Canada in 2018 and 2019; in 2019, Tim Hortons accounted for about 11% of branded plastic waste collected by Greenpeace Canada from rivers and beaches.

In late 2018 and early 2019, Tim Hortons was subject to controversy over their usage of plastic cups. An online Change.org petition asking the company to switch from plastic cups to &quot;a fully recyclable and compostable alternative&quot; gained over 171,000 signatures. The cups were not compostable, due to their plastic lining, and are often very difficult to recycle. As of February 2019, Tim Hortons had not responded to the petition&#x27;s requests.

Tim Hortons coffee cups are collected for recycling in British Columbia and the City of Toronto announced in 2024 that it is piloting recycling coffee cups.

In early 2020, it gave away reusable cups for its &quot;Roll Up the Rim to Win&quot; promotion to eliminate single-use plastic in its establishments. The effort was criticized as greenwashing through a limited-time promotion.

In April 2024, Tim Hortons announced it was testing plastic-free and recyclable hot beverage lids in select Tims restaurants in Ottawa for up to 6 weeks using an improved version of a similar fibre lid that was trialed in Vancouver in early 2023 and helped reduce the use of more than 3.3 million plastic lids. Another similar test was conducted in Prince Edward Island earlier this year.

===Sick-leave during COVID-19 pandemic===
In March 2020, Tim Hortons met criticism for not offering sick-leave concessions to employees during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada.

===App privacy violation===
On June 1, 2022, the federal privacy commissioner, with officials in Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta, announced the results of its investigation, that Tim Hortons violated privacy laws by tracking people who used its app, gathering their location data hundreds of times a day – even when the app was not in use. A way of restitution, Tim Hortons offered eligible app users a free coffee and a baked good.

<text>A string orchestra is an orchestra consisting solely of a string section made up of the bowed strings used in Western Classical music. The instruments of such an orchestra are most often the following: the violin, which is divided into first and second violin players (each usually playing different parts), the viola, the cello, and usually, but not always, the double bass.

String orchestras can be of chamber orchestra size ranging from between 12 (4 first violins, 3 second violins, 2 violas, 2 cellos and 1 bass = 12) and 21 musicians (6 first violins, 5 second violins, 4 violas, 4 cellos and 2 double basses= 21) sometimes performing without a conductor. It could also consist of the entire string section of a large symphony orchestra which could have 60 musicians (16 first violins, 14 second violins, 12 violas, 10 cellos and 8 double basses = 60; &quot;Gurre-Lieder&quot; calls for 84: 20.20.16.16.12).

==Repertoire==

The repertoire includes several works by Mozart (including &quot;Eine kleine Nachtmusik&quot;), William Boyce (his eight symphonies are for strings only), and Haydn which dispense with the baroque basso continuo. Some of these works are problematic when it comes to deciding whether they are for orchestra or string quartet. Particularly in Haydn&#x27;s early works it is argued that the inversions of harmony from the occasional crossings of the bass and viola line imply a double bass; the question is not settled, however.

Important 20th century works have been written for string orchestra by Bartók (Divertimento for String Orchestra), Stravinsky (&quot;Apollo&quot;), Witold Lutosławski (&quot;Musique funèbre&quot;), Benjamin Britten (&quot;Simple Symphony&quot; and &quot;Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge&quot;), Charles Wuorinen (&quot;Grand Bamboula&quot;), and Malcolm Williamson (Symphony No. 7). Sir Michael Tippett wrote a &quot;Concerto for Double String Orchestra&quot; and Ralph Vaughan Williams wrote a &quot;Partita for Double String Orchestra&quot;. Composers who have written a Serenade for string orchestra include Tchaikovsky, Dvořák, Suk and Elgar. Mendelssohn, in his youth, also wrote thirteen symphonies for string orchestra.
Sometimes works originally written for string quartet, quintet, sextet etc. are arranged for string orchestra. Samuel Barber&#x27;s &quot;Adagio for Strings&quot;, Alban Berg&#x27;s 3 Pieces from his &quot;Lyric Suite&quot;, Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s string sextet &quot;Verklärte Nacht&quot; and String Quartet No. 2, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky&#x27;s sextet &quot;Souvenir de Florence&quot;, John Corigliano&#x27;s Second String Quartet and Jean Sibelius&#x27;s &quot;Andante festivo&quot; are examples. An optional timpani part is also added in the Sibelius piece. The work &quot;Shaker Loops&quot; written in 1978 for septet then arranged in 1983 for string orchestra by the American composer John Adams has become a popular addition to the repertoire in recent times. Graham Waterhouse composed several works for string orchestra (&quot;Sinfonietta&quot;), also in combination with contrasting sounds as Great Highland bagpipe (&quot;Chieftain&#x27;s Salute&quot;).

<doc id="180108" wikidata="Q1089174" url="?curid=180108" title="The Huckleberry Hound Show">
<text>The Huckleberry Hound Show is an American animated television series produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions, and the second series produced by the studio following &quot;The Ruff and Reddy Show&quot;. The show first aired in syndication on September 29, 1958, and was sponsored by Kellogg&#x27;s. Three segments were included in the program: one featuring the title character, Huckleberry Hound, another with Pixie and Dixie and Mr. Jinks, which starred two mice who in each short found a new way to outwit the cat Mr. Jinks, and a third starring Yogi Bear and his friend Boo-Boo. The series last aired on December 1, 1961.

The &quot;Yogi Bear&quot; segment of the show became extremely popular, and as a result, it spawned its own series in 1961. A segment featuring Hokey Wolf and Ding-A-Ling was added, replacing &quot;Yogi&quot; during the 1960-61 season. The show contributed to making Hanna-Barbera a household name, and is often credited with legitimizing the concept of animation produced specifically for television. In 1960, it became the first animated program to be honored with an Emmy Award.

==Background/production==

===Conception and development===
Joseph Barbera went to Chicago to pitch the program to Kellogg&#x27;s executives through their ad agency, Leo Burnett. &quot;I had never sold a show before because I didn&#x27;t have to. If we got an idea, we just made it, for over twenty years. All of a sudden, I&#x27;m a salesman, and I&#x27;m in a room with forty-five people staring at me, and I&#x27;m pushing Huckleberry Hound and Yogi Bear and &#x27;the Meeces&#x27;, and they bought it.&quot;

Barbera once recalled about Daws Butler&#x27;s voice acting versatility:
===Format===
The series featured three seven-minute cartoons, animated specifically for television. The first always starred Huckleberry, the next two featured other characters. Each of three cartoons were in between the wraparound segments, which originally set in the circus tent where Huck acts like a showman in the late 1950s.

===Distribution===
The show was originally intended to be part of a line-up of kid programmes sponsored by Kellogg and broadcast on ABC-TV, joining &quot;Woody Woodpecker&quot;, &quot;Superman&quot; and &quot;Wild Bill Hickok&quot; in an early evening, weekday line-up. However, Kellogg&#x27;s agency, Leo Burnett, decided instead to syndicate the show and buy air time on individual stations. The show was originally distributed by Screen Gems (the television division at the time of Columbia Pictures) which held a part-ownership of Hanna-Barbera at the time, over 150 stations. In April 1967, Screen Gems announced the show had been released from advertiser control, and would be made available to stations on a syndicated basis with available bridges to create 92 half-hour shows.

The distribution was later passed to Worldvision Enterprises, after it became a sister company to Hanna-Barbera. It was later distributed by Turner Program Services, after Turner&#x27;s purchase of Hanna-Barbera; current distributor Warner Bros. Television picked up ownership of the show following the 1996 acquisition of Turner by parent company, Time Warner.

===Original syndication===
The show was not broadcast on the same day of the week, or the same time, in every city; airing depended on the deal for time that the Leo Burnett Agency brokered with individual stations. However, the first time the Huck series appeared on television was on Monday, September 29, 1958; it was first seen at 6 p.m. on WOOD-TV in Grand Rapids, Michigan, which also served Battle Creek, home of Kellogg cereals. A few other stations airing it that day were WLWI in Indianapolis (at 6:30 p.m.) and WTAE in Pittsburgh (at 7:30 p.m.). The show debuted on other days that same week in other cities; Huck originally aired in Los Angeles on Tuesdays on KNXT, Chicago on Wednesdays on WGN-TV, and New York City on Thursdays on WPIX. The show first aired in Canada on Thursday, October 2, 1958, at 7 p.m. on CKLW-TV in Windsor, Ontario. The show first aired in Australia on Monday, February 16, 1959, on the National Television Network (now the Nine Network), and the show first aired in the United Kingdom on Friday, July 3, 1959, on ITV.

==Plot and characters==
Each of the three segments featured one or two main characters acting as a duo, and numerous one-off or supporting characters.

===Huckleberry Hound===

Huck&#x27;s voice was Butler&#x27;s impression of a family friend. He used it in earlier work, such as Reddy in &quot;The Ruff and Reddy Show&quot;, Smedley the Dog in the &quot;Chilly Willy&quot; cartoons, and earlier characters in the MGM cartoon library. Butler&#x27;s son Charles confirmed that the voice was based on the neighbor of his wife, Myrtis; Butler would speak with said neighbor when visiting North Carolina.

===Pixie &amp; Dixie and Mr. Jinks===

Pixie (voiced by Don Messick) and Dixie (voiced by Daws Butler) are two mice who every day end up being chased by a cat named Mr. Jinks (voiced by Daws Butler).

===Yogi Bear===

Yogi Bear (voiced by Daws Butler impersonating Art Carney&#x27;s Ed Norton character from &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;) and his friend Boo Boo Bear (voiced by Don Messick) live in Jellystone Park and occasionally try to steal picnic baskets while evading Ranger Smith (also voiced by Don Messick).

===Hokey Wolf===

Hokey Wolf (voiced by Daws Butler impersonating Phil Silvers) is a con-artist wolf who is always trying to cheat his way to the simple life (much like other Hanna-Barbera characters, Top Cat and Yogi Bear). He is accompanied in this by his diminutive, bowler hat-wearing sidekick Ding-A-Ling Wolf (voiced by Doug Young impersonating Buddy Hackett).

==Episodes==

==Legacy==
In the film &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; (1961), Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn) briefly dons a mask of Huckleberry. The name for Rock et Belles Oreilles, a Québécois comedy group popular during the 1980s, was a pun on the name of Huckleberry Hound (&quot;Roquet Belles Oreilles&quot; in French). Australian prison slang vernacular includes &quot;huckleberry hound&quot;, a term originated in the 1960s, meaning &quot;a punishment cell, solitary confinement.&quot; In January 2009, IGN named &quot;The Huckleberry Hound Show&quot; as the 63rd best in its &quot;Top 100 Animated TV Shows&quot;.
In 1960s Hungary, the series - there called &quot;Foxi Maxi&quot; - gained an instant following, also among adults. The reason for this was the fact that legendary scriptwriter József Romhányi had penned dialog with his trademark puns and humor, and some of the most popular actors of the day had supplied the voices. Romhányi and some of the same actors later worked on the Hungarian version of &quot;The Flintstones&quot;.

==Media information==

===Home media===
On , Warner Home Video (via Hanna-Barbera Cartoons and Warner Bros. Family Entertainment) released &quot;The Huckleberry Hound Show – Volume 1&quot; for the Hanna-Barbera Classics Collection, featuring the complete first season of 26 episodes (66 segments) from the series on DVD, all presented remastered and restored. However, the episodes in the Volume 1 DVD set were the edited versions, instead of the uncut and unedited, original network broadcast versions due to expensive licensing issues.

===Licensing===
The characters from &quot;The Huckleberry Hound Show&quot; spawned various product, publishing, and other licensing deals. Columbia Pictures/Screen Gems&#x27; record arm, Colpix, released the first Huckleberry Hound album in October 1958, with stuffed animals and games also hawked in record stores.

No later than 1961, the characters began appearing &quot;in person&quot; at events across America. Hanna-Barbera commissioned costumed characters of Huckleberry Hound, Yogi Bear, and Quick Draw McGraw, which appeared at events like the Florida State Fair.

Hanna-Barbera owner Taft Broadcasting started opening theme parks in 1972, beginning with Kings Island. These parks included areas themed to the company&#x27;s cartoons, and included walk-around characters of Huckleberry Hound, Yogi Bear, and others. The characters were also featured on rides, including carousels. Licensed &quot;Huckleberry&quot; products included an Aladdin-brand Thermos.

Books based on the show include:
* &quot;Huckleberry Hound Christmas&quot;, P. Scherr, Golden Press, 25 cents.
* &quot;Huckleberry Hound: The Case of the Friendly Monster&quot;, Ottenheimer Publishers, 1978, 96 pages.

<doc id="180109" wikidata="Q3829820" url="?curid=180109" title="Copyright law of the European Union">
<text>Copyright law within the European Union is largely harmonized, although differences between member states exist. The body of law was implemented in the EU through a number of directives, which the member states need to enact into their national law. The main copyright directives are the Copyright Term Directive 2006, the Information Society Directive and the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market. Copyright in the Union is furthermore dependent on international conventions to which the European Union or their member states are part of, such as TRIPS Agreement or the Berne Convention.

== History ==
Attempts to harmonise copyright law in Europe (and beyond) can be dated to the signature of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works on 9 September 1886: all European Union Member States are parties of the Berne Convention, and compliance with its dispositions is now obligatory before accession. The first major step taken by the European Economic Community to harmonise copyright laws came with the decision to apply common standard for the copyright protection of computer programs, enacted in the Computer Programs Directive in 1991. A common term of copyright protection, 70 years from the death of the author, was established in 1993 as the Copyright Duration Directive.

The implementation of directives on copyright has been rather more controversial than for many other subjects, as can be seen by the six judgments for non-transposition of the Information Society Directive. Traditionally, copyright laws vary considerably between member states, particularly between civil law and common law jurisdictions. Changes in copyright law have also become linked to protests against the World Trade Organization and globalisation in general.

== Sources of law ==

The first decisions of the European Court of Justice covering copyright were made under the non-discrimination provision of Article 6 EC (formerly Art. 7), and under the provisions of Article 36 which allows for restrictions on trade between Member States if justified by the protection of industrial and commercial property (including copyright). The directives were made under the internal market provisions of the treaties, notably Article 95 EC (formerly Art. 100a)

== Protected rights ==
The following rights are protected by European Union law:
*&quot;right of reproduction&quot; for authors, performers, producers of phonograms and films and broadcasting organisations
*&quot;right of communication to the public&quot; for authors, performers, producers of phonograms and films and broadcasting organisations
*&quot;right of distribution&quot; for authors and for performers, producers of phonograms and films and broadcasting organisations
*&quot;right of fixation&quot; for performers and broadcasting organisations
*&quot;right of rental and/or lending&quot; for authors, performers, producers of phonograms and films, with an associated &quot;right of equitable remuneration for lending and/or rental&quot; for authors and performers
*&quot;right of broadcasting&quot; for performers, producers of phonograms and broadcasting organisations
*&quot;right of communication to the public by satellite and cable&quot; for authors, performers, producers of phonograms and broadcasting organisations
*&quot;right of computer program reproduction, distribution and rental for authors&quot;

Moral rights are usually considered to be a matter for the national laws of the Member States, although some countries classify some of the above rights, especially the right of communication to the public, among the moral rights of the author rather than under his rights of exploitation.

=== Duration of protection ===
The rights of authors are protected within their lifetime and for 70 years after their death; this includes the resale rights of artists. For films and other audiovisual works, the 70-year period applies from the last death among the following people, whether or not they are considered to be authors of the work by the national law of the Member State: the principal director (who is always considered to be an author of the audiovisual work), the author of the screenplay, the author of the dialogue and the composer of music specifically created for use in the cinematographic or audiovisual work.

The rights of performers last for 50 years from the distribution or communication of the performance, or for 50 years from the performance itself if it had never been communicated to the public during this period. The rights of phonogram producers last for 50 years after publication of the phonogram, or for 50 years after its communication to the public if it had never been published during that period, or for 50 years after its creation if it had never been communicated to the public. The rights of film producers last for 50 years after the communication of the film to the public, or for 50 years after its creation if it had never been communicated to the public during that period. The rights of broadcasting organisations last for 50 years after the first transmission of a broadcast. The European Commission proposed this be extended to 95 years and following this suggestion the European Parliament passed legislation to increase the term to 70 years.

Where a work enjoyed a longer period of protection under national law on 1 July 1995, its period of protection is not shortened. Otherwise, these terms of protection apply to all works which were protected in a Member State of the European Economic Area on 1 July 1995. This provision had the effect of restoring the copyrights in certain works which had entered the public domain in countries with shorter copyright terms. The EU Information Society Directive modified the term of protection of phonograms, calculating from the date of publication instead of from an earlier date of communication to the public, but did not restore the protection of phonograms which had entered the public domain under the former rules. All periods of protection run until 31 December of the year in which they expire.

=== Resale right ===
The Resale Rights Directive created a right for the creators of works of art to participate in the proceeds of the resale of their work. This right, which is sometime known by its French name &quot;droit de suite&quot;, is personal to the artist and can only be transferred by inheritance. It is calculated as a proportion of the resale price (net of tax), which varies between 4 and 5 percent for the portion of the resale price up to EUR 50,000 and 0.25% for the portion of the resale price above EUR 500,000. The total royalty is limited at EUR 12,500, equivalent to a resale price of EUR 2,000,000. Member States may choose to exempt sales of less than EUR 3000 from royalty. Works of art which are covered by this resale right are &quot;works of graphic or plastic art such as pictures, collages, paintings, drawings, engravings, prints, lithographs, sculptures, tapestries, ceramics, glassware and photographs, provided they are made by the artist herself or himself or are copies which have been made in limited numbers by the artist or under his or her authority.&quot;

=== Database rights ===
The Database Directive created a &quot;sui generis&quot; protection for databases which do not meet the criterion of originality for copyright protection. It is specifically intended to protect &quot;the investment of considerable human, technical and financial resources&quot; in creating databases (para. 7 of the preamble), whereas the copyright laws of many Member States specifically exclude effort and labour from the criteria for copyright protection. To qualify, the database must show &quot;qualitatively and/or quantitatively a substantial investment in either the obtaining, verification or presentation of the contents&quot;. Their creators have the right &quot;to prevent extraction and/or re-utilization of the whole or of a substantial part, evaluated qualitatively and/or quantitatively, of the contents of that database.&quot; This is taken to include the repeated extraction of insubstantial parts of the contents if this conflicts with the normal exploitation of the database or unreasonably prejudices the legitimate interests of the creator of the database.

Member States may limit this right in the following cases:

*extraction for private use from a non-electronic database;
*extraction for the purposes of teaching or research, to the extent justified by the non-commercial purpose;
*extraction and/or reutilisation for the purposes of public security or an administrative or judicial procedure.

Database rights last for fifteen years from:

*the &quot;completion&quot; of the database, that is to say the point at which the criterion of substantial investment is fulfilled, or from
*the date at which the database is made available to the public, whichever is the later. The protection period runs until 31 December of the year in which it expires. If there is a &quot;substantial change&quot; in the database which would be qualified as a &quot;substantial new investment&quot;, a new protection period is granted for the resulting database.

== Limitations ==
Temporary copying which is the result of the transmission of a work or of its legal use is not covered by the exclusive right of reproduction.

Member states can implement other limitations from the list in Information Society Directive Article 5, or retain limitations which were already in force on 22 June 2001. Permitted limitations are:

*art. 5.2(a) paper reproductions by photocopying or similar methods, except of sheet music, if there is compensation for rightsholders;
*art. 5.2(b) reproductions made for private and non-commercial use if there is compensation for rightholders;
*art. 5.2(c) reproductions by public libraries, educational institutions or archives for non-commercial use;
*art. 5.2(d) preservation of recordings of broadcasts in official archives;
*art. 5.2(e) reproductions of broadcasts by social, non-commercial institutions such as hospitals and prisons, if there is compensation to rightholders;
*art. 5.3(a) use for illustration for teaching or scientific research, to the extent justified by the non-commercial purpose;
*art. 5.3(b) uses directly related to a disability, to the extent justified by the disability;
*art. 5.3(c) press reviews and news reporting;
*art. 5.3(d) quotations for the purposes of criticism or review;
*art. 5.3(e) uses for the purposes of public security or in administrative, parliamentary or judicial proceedings;
*art. 5.3(f) uses of political speeches and extracts of public lectures, to the extent justified by public information;
*art. 5.3(g) uses during religious or official celebrations;
*art. 5.3(h) uses of works, such as architecture or sculpture, which are located permanently in public places;
*art. 5.3(i) incidental inclusion in another work;
*art. 5.3(j) use for the advertisement of the public exhibition or sale of art;
*art. 5.3(k) caricature, parody or pastiche;
*art. 5.3(l) use in connection with the demonstration or repair of equipment;
*art. 5.3(m) use of a protected work (e.g., plans) for the reconstruction of a building;
*art. 5.3(n) communication of works to the public within the premises of public libraries, educational institutions, museums or archives.

No new limitations may come into force after 22 June 2001 except those in the permitted limitations given in the Information Society Directive. Limitations may only be applied in balance with the Berne three-step test that asks the exceptions be &quot;certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work or other subject-matter and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the rightholder&quot;. However it was agreed at the time of drafting the WIPO Copyright and Performances and Phonograms Treaties that this wording &quot;neither reduces nor extends the scope of applicability of the limitations and exceptions permitted by the Berne Convention.&quot;

This explicit list of exceptions stands in contrast to the open-ended Fair Use doctrine employed by the United States, and the European Union has typically been staunchly against considering frameworks resembling Fair Use. The use of short snippets of news articles in aggregation sites like Google News, covered by fair use in the United States, has been the subject of dispute between Google and European governments, following the passage of ancillary copyright for press publishers in Germany and the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market EU-wide.

== Protection of rights ==
The Enforcement Directive covers the remedies that are available in the civil courts and harmonises the rules on standing, evidence, interlocutory measures, seizure and injunctions, damages and costs and judicial publication. Germany recognises the so-called &quot;&quot; whereby the burden of proof is on the alleged infringer in an infringement lawsuit.

== Collection monopolies ==
Copyright collecting societies in the European Union usually hold monopolies in their respective national markets. Some countries create a statutory monopoly, while others recognise effective monopolies through regulations. In Austria, the Society of Authors, Composers and Publishers (&quot;&quot;, AKM) has a statutory monopoly. German law recognizes GEMA as an effective monopoly, and consequently the burden of proof is on the accused infringer that a work is not managed by GEMA.

<text>Atanasio &quot;Tony&quot; Pérez Rigal (born May 14, 1942) is a Cuban-American former professional baseball player, coach and manager. He played in Major League Baseball as a first baseman and third baseman from through , most notably as a member of the Cincinnati Reds dynasty that won four National League pennants and two World Series championships between 1970 and 1976. He also played for the Montreal Expos, Boston Red Sox and the Philadelphia Phillies.

A seven-time All-Star, Pérez averaged more than 100 runs batted in per season from 1970 to 1976 for the powerful Cincinnati team that became known as the Big Red Machine for their dominance of the National League in the mid-1970s. Variously nicknamed &quot;Big Dog&quot;, &quot;Big Doggie&quot;, and &quot;Doggie&quot;, he was one of the most popular players in Reds history.

After his playing career, Pérez became a coach and later managed the Reds and the Florida Marlins. From 1993 through the 2017 season, he was Special Assistant to the General Manager with the Marlins. In 2000, Pérez was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Pérez was born in Ciego de Ávila, Cuba in 1942, the son of José Manuel and Teodora (Rígal) Pérez. Tony and his parents and siblings all lived in a two-bedroom row house owned by the sugar mill where Tony&#x27;s father, and eventually Tony, worked. Tony later played shortstop for the Mill&#x27;s baseball team, Central Violeta.

He was signed to a pro contract in 1960 at age 17 by Cincinnati Reds scout Tony Pacheco while playing on the Camagüey sugar factory team. He was assigned to the instructional team of the Reds&#x27; AAA affiliate Havana Sugar Kings. His &quot;bonus&quot; for signing with the Reds was the $2.50 cost of a visa and a plane ticket to Miami, Florida.

==Career==

===Early days===
Pérez arrived in Florida in the spring of 1960 and participated in the Reds&#x27; spring training in Tampa. He played his first minor league game for the Reds&#x27; Class D affiliate in Geneva, New York at age 17 on May 1, 1960, in the season-opener for the New York–Pennsylvania League team. Starting at second base, his first professional hit was a triple as he went 1–5 in a 6–5, 13-inning loss to the Auburn Yankees. He went hitless in the next game (the Redlegs&#x27; home opener) in a 17–16 Redlegs win, and in the next game he got the team&#x27;s only hit (a single) in a 5–0 loss. On June 25 he was placed on the disabled list. That same day, he was replaced on the active roster by just-signed 19-year-old Pete Rose, who was inserted into the starting lineup at second base. Upon Pérez&#x27;s return, Rose remained at second base and Pérez played third base. Another of his teammates was Martín Dihigo Jr., son of Baseball Hall of Fame member and Negro leagues great and Cuban native Martín Dihigo. Pérez hit .279 with 6 home runs in 104 games.

In 1961 he again played for Geneva and set several team batting records, batting .348 with 27 home runs in 121 games. In 1962 he was promoted to the Class B Rocky Mount Leafs in the Carolina League. He reported two weeks late, as he had trouble getting out of his homeland of Cuba. In 100 games, he hit .292 with 18 home runs and 74 RBI, making the all-star team as a third baseman, but his season was cut short after those 100 games due to a broken ankle. In 1963 he was promoted to the Macon Peaches of the Class AA South Atlantic League, where in 69 games as a third baseman he hit .309 with 11 home runs and 48 RBIs before being promoted that same year to the Class AAA San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League. For San Diego that year, in 8 games he hit .379 with 1 home run and 5 RBI.

Playing for the Padres in 1964, Pérez, now playing first base, was named Most Valuable Player in the Pacific Coast League. Pérez hit .309 with 34 home runs and 107 RBI. He was called up to the Reds and played his first two games in a doubleheader on July 26, 1964, at Cincinnati&#x27;s Crosley Field. In his debut he started at first base, and in his first at-bat he drew a walk against left-handed pitcher Joe Gibbon. He went 0–2 against Gibbon and Don Schwall in a 7–2 Reds win, then went 0–4 against pitcher Bob Veale in a 5–1 Pirates win.

The following day he started at first base and batted fifth against the Braves at Milwaukee County Stadium. In an 11–2 Reds win, he got his first hit, a second-inning double off Denny Lemaster, and then scored his first run on a Johnny Edwards double. In the seventh inning he got his first RBI, a single off Lemaster to score Frank Robinson.

From 1964 through 1966, he platooned at first base, primarily with Deron Johnson and Gordy Coleman. His first career home run, a grand slam, came in the Reds&#x27; second game of 1965, at home in Crosley Field against Milwaukee – and again against Denny Lemaster. The grand slam came with 2 outs and scored Vada Pinson, Frank Robinson, and Deron Johnson.

Pérez became the Reds&#x27; starter at third base in 1967 and was selected to his first All-Star team in . The game, played on July 11, 1967, at Anaheim Stadium, went into 15 innings, the longest All-Star Game in history (since equaled by the 2008 game). Pérez&#x27;s home run off future fellow Hall of Famer Catfish Hunter propelled the National League to a 2–1 victory. He was subsequently voted the game&#x27;s Most Valuable Player.

In , Pérez hit the first home run in Pittsburgh&#x27;s Three Rivers Stadium. The 1970 campaign was his finest year, statistically: in addition to his 129 RBIs, Pérez hit .317, slugged 40 home runs and scored 107 runs. He came in third in the Most Valuable Player voting behind Billy Williams and Reds&#x27; teammate and winner Johnny Bench.

Pérez also played winter ball for 10 seasons between 1964–65 and 1982–83 in the Puerto Rico Baseball League for the Santurce Crabbers (Cangrejeros de Santurce). He won the batting title and was named league MVP in 1966–67.

===Big Red Machine===

After platooning and playing first base in the early part of his career (1964–66) with the Cincinnati Reds, he became a perennial all-star starting at third base from 1967 to 1971. From 1972 onward he starred at first base. Pérez was one of the premier RBI men of his generation, driving in 100 or more runs seven times in his 23-year-long career. In an 11-year stretch from 1967 to 1977, Pérez drove in 90 or more runs each year, with a high of 129 RBIs in 1970. During the decade of the 1970s, Pérez was second among all major-leaguers in RBI, with 954, behind only his teammate Johnny Bench.

Beginning in , the Reds went to the World Series four times in seven years, winning back-to-back world championships in and , with Pérez starting at first base. Following the Reds sweep of the Phillies in the League Championship Series and New York Yankees in the 1976 World Series (the only time a team has ever swept the postseason since the League Championship Series was introduced in 1969), Pérez was traded to the Montreal Expos with Will McEnaney for Woodie Fryman and Dale Murray. After his trade, the &quot;Big Red Machine&quot;—considered one of baseball&#x27;s all-time greatest teams—sputtered and never again got into the Series, reaching the playoffs but one more time in . Sparky Anderson, the Reds manager during the championships of the 1970s, has stated in many interviews since that Pérez was the leader, and heart and soul of those teams.

After three seasons in Montreal (in which he hit 46 home runs with 242 RBIs and a .281 batting average), for the season, Pérez signed as a free agent with the Boston Red Sox. In his first season with the Red Sox, he finished in the top 10 in the American League in home runs (25), RBIs (105) and intentional walks (11), and won the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award.

===Cincinnati reunion===
For the season, Pérez reunited with &quot;Big Red Machine&quot; teammates Pete Rose and Joe Morgan on the Philadelphia Phillies. Still a feared hitter based on his reputation, Pérez was a reserve player for their Phillies during their run to the World Series that year, and batted .242 in his five World Series appearances. Following the season, he returned to the Cincinnati Reds as a free agent, where he remained until his retirement following the season.

In 1984, at age 42, he became the oldest player to hit a walk-off pinch-hit home run (off the Pirates&#x27; Don Robinson). On May 13, 1985, batting against Philadelphia Phillies&#x27; reliever Dave Rucker, he became the oldest player (44) to hit a grand slam, breaking a 70-year-old record held by Honus Wagner. The new record stood until Julio Franco broke it at age 46 in 2004. Pérez was named National League Player of the Week during the final week of his career at age 44, when he went 8-for-19 with a home run, three doubles, and 6 runs batted in.

His final career hit and RBI came on October 4, 1986, at Riverfront Stadium when he hit a solo home run off San Diego Padres pitcher Ed Whitson in a 10–7 Reds win. The following day was the Reds&#x27; last game of the year and the final game of his career. In his final at-bat, he flied out against Andy Hawkins in a 2–1 Padres&#x27; win.

===Managerial career===

After serving one season as a coach for the Reds, Perez was hired as manager for the 1993 season. The Reds started slowly with a 12-18 record, but quickly went on a seven-game winning streak before going on a seven-game West Coast road trip. Before a game against the San Francisco Giants, Reds beat writer Hal McCoy approached Perez with an idea to bat catcher Joe Oliver in the game instead of backup catcher Dan Wilson, since Oliver hit Giants starting pitcher Bud Black well. Perez took McCoy&#x27;s suggestion and the Reds won the game, the only win they would have on the trip. McCoy wrote about his meeting in his column shortly thereafter. Reds general manager Jim Bowden read the column and was angry that Perez allowed McCoy to influence a managerial decision and fired Perez with the team having a 20-24 record.

Shortly after being fired by the Reds, Perez was hired by the Florida Marlins as special assistant to the general manager and later special assistant to the team president. In 2001, he replaced John Boles as manager of the Marlins after a 22-26 start and managed the team to the end of the season, going 54-60. Perez remained with the Marlins&#x27; organization until 2017.

===Legacy===
Pérez was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1998. On May 27, 2000, in an on-field pre-game ceremony at Cinergy Field with family and former teammates and managers, the Reds retired his number, 24.

In , Pérez was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, garnering 385 votes on 499 ballots for a total of 77.15%, just over the three-quarters minimum required for induction. He was inducted in July 2000 along with Sparky Anderson, Carlton Fisk, Bid McPhee and Turkey Stearnes. In his induction speech, he said, &quot;I doubt that a king at his coronation feels better than me today.&quot; Each year since his induction, he has attended the weekend ceremonies, including riding in the annual parade and playing in the annual golf outing and old-timers&#x27; baseball game.

Pérez was inducted into the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame in 2001 at a pre-game ceremony held at the San Francisco Giants&#x27; Pacific Bell Park. That same year he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the 2001 All-Star Game at Safeco Field in Seattle. He had played at the Kingdome in Seattle during the 1979 All-Star Game. Pérez in 1998 was inducted into the Caribbean Baseball Hall of Fame, which honors those that have made significant achievements in the Caribbean Series. He was one of 24 inaugural inductees into the Latino Baseball Hall of Fame in 2010. He was inducted in 2010 to the Cuban Sports Hall of Fame.

In 2011, with Pérez and his sons in attendance at opening ceremonies of the Museo del Deporte de Puerto Rico in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, his adopted homeland, presented him with a surprise honor. He was proclaimed an official &quot;native son&quot; of Puerto Rico &quot;for his dedication to the commonwealth as a family and community member, and for his impressive baseball accolades while representing the island.&quot; Also present were fellow Hall of Famers Orlando Cepeda and Roberto Alomar, as well as Vera Zabala, the widow of Roberto Clemente.

On August 10, 2014, at the annual Reds Hall of Fame Induction Gala, former Reds teammates Johnny Bench and Joe Morgan along with Pérez himself announced that the Reds would erect a statue of Pérez outside Great American Ball Park.

On August 21–22, 2015, the Cincinnati Reds held Tony Pérez Weekend during a series with the Arizona Diamondbacks. At least 12 players of the Big Red Machine were part of a post-game ceremony that Friday&#x27;s night. On Saturday, a bronze statue of Pérez was unveiled near the entrance to Great American Ball Park. Fans attending the game received replica statues, and there was a pre-game ceremony honoring Pérez, followed by him throwing the ceremonial first pitch.

Tommy John thought Pérez was one of the toughest hitters he ever had to face due to his ability to hit to right-center field with power. &quot;He waited on the ball well and I couldn&#x27;t throw hard enough to get it by him inside,&quot; John recollected.

===Managerial record===
==Personal life==

While playing winter ball in Puerto Rico in 1964, Pérez met Juana (&quot;Pituka&quot;) de la Cantera, daughter of Pablo de la Cantera and Edilia Cortina. Also of Cuban descent, she grew up in Puerto Rico. Four months after meeting, the couple married in early 1965. They both became American citizens on October 18, 1971 in Cincinnati. They have two sons, both born in Cincinnati, Victor Pérez (May 11, 1966) and Eduardo Pérez (September 11, 1969).

Victor played one season in the Reds&#x27; minor league system in 1990. He attended and graduated from Xavier University in Cincinnati with a Bachelor of Applied Science degree in Finance and Computer Science. He later moved to New York City, where he worked in real estate and in telecommunications. He also attended acting school there and became a professional actor, first in New York City, and then for several years in London.

Eduardo was an All-American third baseman at Florida State University and played in the College World Series. He was drafted in the first round (17th overall pick) by the California Angels. He played Major League Baseball for 13 seasons. After retiring as a player, he served as an ESPN commentator for five years. In 2009, he managed Leones de Ponce to the Puerto Rican League championship, and in 2011 and 2012 he was hitting coach for the Miami Marlins. He was bench coach of the Houston Astros for the 2013 season. In 2016, Eduardo joined SiriusXM&#x27;s MLB Network Radio hosting The Leadoff Spot with Steve Phillips. He is married to Mirba (Rivera) and they have two daughters, Andreanna and Juliana.

In November 1972, Pérez was granted a 20-day visa to return to Cuba for the first time since a 1963 trip; however, the visa did not permit his wife and children to go, according to &quot;Latino Baseball Legends: An Encyclopedia&quot; by Lew Freedman. He took 17 suitcases of gifts, clothes, and medical supplies and reunited with his family in Central Violeta, Cuba—a 400-mile train ride from Havana.

Tony&#x27;s father, Jose Manuel – with whom Tony worked alongside as a teenager at the Camagüey sugar factory, hauling and stamping the company&#x27;s name on the bags – died in 1979 at age 84 (some sources list his year of death as 1977). Tony has stated that, during his playing career, his family in Cuba would listen to the Voice of America, which would give daily updates on Cuban players playing in the majors.

Tony&#x27;s mother, Teodora (&quot;Tita&quot;), was 88 when Tony called her with the news in 2000 that he had been elected to the Hall of Fame. Tony was able to make a return visit to Cuba in 2002, only this time with his sons. Teodora died in 2008. Tony&#x27;s oldest sister died in 1997. In 2000, for a luncheon honoring Tony, the Marlins arranged to surprise him by helping his two living sisters, Argelia and Gloria, secure visas and come to Miami from their homes in Central Violeta, Camagüey, Cuba.

Pérez has cited Cuban-born Minnie Miñoso as his boyhood idol. Pérez advocated for many years in articles, speeches, and discussions to get Minoso elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame.

A 326-page biography, &quot;Tony Pérez: From Cuba to Cooperstown&quot;, written by John Erardi, was published on April 2, 2018.

<doc id="180112" wikidata="Q2164080" url="?curid=180112" title="Tiger Army">
<text>Tiger Army is an American psychobilly band based in Los Angeles, California. The group was formed in 1996 in Berkeley, California, and its only constant member is singer, guitarist, and lead songwriter Nick 13. The band has released six studio albums and four EPs.

== History ==
Tiger Army played their first show at the famous 924 Gilman Street venue in Berkeley, California, on March 29, 1996. The band&#x27;s sound drew from early punk, rock n&#x27; roll and rockabilly, as well as dark English pop. Their first official release was a self-titled vinyl record EP, now referred to as the &quot;Temptation EP&quot;. The record was released by Chapter 11 Records. This EP caught the attention of Tim Armstrong of Rancid; he was also co-owner of Hellcat Records. Armstrong signed the band.

Tiger Army recorded their first full-length, the self-titled &quot;Tiger Army&quot;, in January 1999. It was released that October. Stand-up bassist Joel Day left Tiger Army before the band was signed, so the Quakes stand-up bassist Rob Peltier was hired to play on the album. Drummer Adam Carson of AFI, who had been helping out the band live, played on the record, as well. The band then embarked on a California mini-tour promoting the album in 1999. In 2000, Nick 13 asked former AFI bassist Geoff Kresge, one of his former bandmates from Influence 13, to join Tiger Army. Ex-Samhain drummer London May came on board as well.

&quot;Tiger Army II: Power of Moonlite&quot; followed in 2001. Fred Hell replaced London May shortly after the recording. The band toured with TSOL, The Damned, Dropkick Murphys and others in support of the record and went to Europe and Japan for the first time on the album as well. The band&#x27;s friend and drum tech, Mike Fasano, played on the next Tiger Army album, &quot;Tiger Army III: Ghost Tigers Rise,&quot; when Hell was unable to record or tour behind the album after being shot 4 times in a home invasion robbery. Nick 13 announced a new lineup for Tiger Army, featuring drummer James Meza and stand-up bassist, Jeff Roffredo, formerly of Los Angeles psychobilly bands Cosmic Voodoo, Calavera, and The Rezurex in 2004. This lineup supported Social Distortion on an extensive US tour.

In the spring of 2005, the band headlined a string of five sold-out shows at the Hollywood House Of Blues. The following year, the band sold out four nights at the Anaheim House of Blues. They also hit the road with Morrissey and AFI, performing several headlining tours around the world.

Tiger Army made major festival appearances across the US and Europe in support of their fourth album, titled &quot;Music from Regions Beyond&quot;. The album was released on June 5, 2007 and was produced by Jerry Finn. &quot;Forever Fades Away&quot; went to No. 1 on Los Angeles rock station KROQ FM, which Tiger Army performed on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; and at radio festivals like &quot;BFD&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the album &quot;one of the year&#x27;s best punk albums&quot;.

Geoff Kresge returned to Tiger Army in early 2008 and joined Nick 13 and drummer James Meza on tours of the U.S., Canada, Australia, Japan and Europe. The band launched a multi-night festival, Octoberflame, in Southern California in 2008, concluding two years of touring behind &quot;Music from Regions Beyond&quot;. Nick launched a solo project focused on Americana/country music in 2009, making his first live solo appearance at the Stagecoach Festival in 2010 in Indio, California. Tiger Army continued to appear at Octoberflame each year, as well as in cities like Las Vegas, San Diego, Tempe, Costa Mesa and the MusInk Festival. On June 7, 2011, Nick 13 released his solo album on Sugar Hill Records. Tiger Army has been less active while 13 has built his solo career in the Americana world.

Tiger Army played their largest standalone headlining show to date at the Orange County Fair in 2011. In March/April 2012, the band performed two shows in Southern California and one in Las Vegas dubbed &quot;Spring Forward.&quot; Octoberflame V followed with six shows in five cities. In December 2012, Tiger Army announced &quot;Spring Forward 2013,&quot; which took place in March 2013 in San Diego, Ventura, CA and Las Vegas. The band played a radio show in Arizona around the same time.

Octoberflame VI took place in October 25 and 26, 2013 at City National Grove of Anaheim. The two back-to-back shows were advertised as Tiger Army&#x27;s last shows of 2013. The Octoberflame events have become known for varied set lists that explore deep cuts and cover songs, special guests and diverse support acts running the gamut of rock, alt-rock, punk, hardcore, psychobilly, industrial, rockabilly and more.

In February 2014, Geoff Kresge announced he would be leaving Tiger Army via a lengthy statement on his Facebook page.

In June 2014, Nick 13 announced that writing for a new Tiger Army album was underway via the band&#x27;s Facebook page. After announcing that live performances including the annual Octoberflame dates would be on hold for 2014 to focus on preparing for the album, the return of Octoberflame (VII) for 2015 was announced in June, with tickets sold out by early July. Beginning with the 2015 Octoberflame shows, which showcased material from the &quot;Ghost Tigers Rise&quot; album, drummer Mike Fasano rejoined the band on a full-time basis. Tiger Army released their fifth studio album, &quot;V •••–&quot;, on May 20, 2016, on Luna Tone Records/Rise Records.

On June 22, 2018, the band released a three-song EP, &quot;Dark Paradise&quot;, which featured covers of Lana Del Rey&#x27;s &quot;Dark Paradise&quot; and the Chantays&#x27; instrumental &quot;Pipeline.&quot;

Tiger Army&#x27;s sixth full-length studio album, &quot;Retrofuture&quot;, was released on September 13, 2019, on Luna Tone Records/Rise Records. The following month, the band played two sold-out shows at the Wiltern in Los Angeles for Octoberflame X; supporting acts included Brian Fallon (formerly of the Gaslight Anthem), the Delta Bombers, Wayne Hancock, and 8 Kalacas.

<text>Charles Frederick William Chilton MBE (15 June 1917 – 2 January 2013) was a British presenter, writer and producer who worked on BBC Radio. He created the 1950s radio serials &quot;Riders of the Range&quot; and &quot;Journey into Space&quot;, and also inspired the stage show and film &quot;Oh, What a Lovely War!&quot;.

==Early life==

Born in Bloomsbury in London, England, he never knew his father – who was killed during the First World War – and when he was six his mother died as a result of having a botched abortion, with the result that Chilton was brought up by his grandmother. He was educated at St. Pancras Church of England School.

Chilton left school at the age of 14, and after a brief apprenticeship making electric signs, he joined the BBC as a messenger boy. A year later he became an assistant in their gramophone library. He had a passion for jazz music, and in 1937 formed the BBC Boys&#x27; Jazz band.

==Career==

His first role as a producer was for &quot;I Hear America Singing&quot;, after which he moved to the BBC variety department. He then presented his own show between 11pm and midnight called &quot;Swing Time&quot;, and a weekly jazz programme called &quot;Radio Rhythm Club&quot;. Next came five years&#x27; war service with the RAF, after which he was sent to Ceylon to run the forces radio station with broadcaster David Jacobs, later to participate in Chilton&#x27;s radio series &quot;Journey into Space&quot;.

Back in the BBC he wrote and produced programmes for, among others, Roy Plomley, Michael Bentine and Stéphane Grappelli. In 1947 he married Penelope (née Colbeck (born 1921)), who was a secretary at the corporation. He was then sent to the United States to research, write and produce a number of series based on American western history. One of these, &quot;Riders of the Range&quot;, lasted for five years until 1953. During its run, &quot;Riders of the Range&quot; attracted audiences of around 10 million. Chilton wrote a comic-strip version of the series drawn by for the &quot;Eagle&quot; which outlasted the radio version, and wrote another western series, &quot;Flying Cloud&quot;, for the &quot;Eagle&quot;&#x27;s sister comic &quot;Girl&quot;. Chilton was also briefly a producer on the comedy series &quot;The Goon Show&quot;.

Major international recognition came with his science-fiction trilogy &quot;Journey into Space&quot;, which he wrote and produced between 1953 and 1958. His interest in space and space travel also led him to join the British Astronomical Association and the British Interplanetary Society.

He was presented with an MBE in 1972.

He spent his last years acting as a tour guide for the Original London Walks company.

==Legacy==

In January 2014, BBC Radio 4 Extra broadcast a selection of programmes to celebrate the life and work of Charles Chilton. This included &quot;The Long, Long Trail&quot;, telling the story of the First World War through the songs sung by soldiers, broadcast for the first time since its original transmission on the BBC Home Service in 1961.

On 4 January 2014, in conjunction with BBC Radio 4 Extra, BBC Radio 4 broadcast &quot;Archive on 4: The Long, Long Trail&quot;. Roy Hudd told the story of Chilton&#x27;s ground-breaking 1961 musical documentary. Interviewees included satirist Ian Hislop, Chilton&#x27;s widow Penelope and their children Mary (born 1951) and David Chilton (born 1952) and the producer was Amber Barnfather. In a five-star review, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; said &quot;Chilton ... merits this tribute – as does the British soldier&#x27;s stoic humour that so movingly illumines the four-year hell.&quot; &quot;Archive on 4: The Long, Long Trail&quot; won a Silver Radio Award in the New York Festivals International Radio Program Awards 2014.

<text>A medication (also called medicament, medicine, pharmaceutical drug, medicinal product, medicinal drug or simply drug) is a drug used to diagnose, cure, treat, or prevent disease. Drug therapy (pharmacotherapy) is an important part of the medical field and relies on the science of pharmacology for continual advancement and on pharmacy for appropriate management.

Drugs are classified in many ways. One of the key divisions is by level of control, which distinguishes prescription drugs (those that a pharmacist dispenses only on the medical prescription) from over-the-counter drugs (those that consumers can order for themselves). Medicines may be classified by mode of action, route of administration, biological system affected, or therapeutic effects. The World Health Organization keeps a list of essential medicines.

Drug discovery and drug development are complex and expensive endeavors undertaken by pharmaceutical companies, academic scientists, and governments. As a result of this complex path from discovery to commercialization, partnering has become a standard practice for advancing drug candidates through development pipelines. Governments generally regulate what drugs can be marketed, how drugs are marketed, and in some jurisdictions, drug pricing. Controversies have arisen over drug pricing and disposal of used medications.

==Definition==
Medication is a medicine or a chemical compound used to treat or cure illness. According to &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, medication is &quot;a substance used in treating a disease or relieving pain&quot;.

As defined by the National Cancer Institute, dosage forms of medication can include tablets, capsules, liquids, creams, and patches. Medications can be administered in different ways, such as by mouth, by infusion into a vein, or by drops put into the ear or eye. A medication that does not contain an active ingredient and is used in research studies is called a placebo.

In Europe, the term is &quot;medicinal product&quot;, and it is defined by EU law as:

* &quot;Any substance or combination of substances presented as having properties for treating or preventing disease in human beings; or&quot;
* &quot;Any substance or combination of substances which may be used in or administered to human beings either with a view to restoring, correcting, or modifying physiological functions by exerting a pharmacological, immunological or metabolic action or to making a medical diagnosis.&quot;

In the US, a &quot;drug&quot; is:
* A substance (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.
* A substance intended for use as a component of a medicine but not a device or a component, part, or accessory of a device.
* A substance intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease.
* A substance recognized by an official pharmacopeia or formulary.
* Biological products are included within this definition and are generally covered by the same laws and regulations, but differences exist regarding their manufacturing processes (chemical process versus biological process).

==Usage==
Drug use among elderly Americans has been studied; in a group of 2,377 people with an average age of 71 surveyed between 2005 and 2006, 84% took at least one prescription drug, 44% took at least one over-the-counter (OTC) drug, and 52% took at least one dietary supplement; in a group of 2245 elderly Americans (average age of 71) surveyed over the period 2010 – 2011, those percentages were 88%, 38%, and 64%.

== Classification ==
One of the key classifications is between traditional small molecule drugs; usually derived from chemical synthesis and biological medical products; which include recombinant proteins, vaccines, blood products used therapeutically (such as IVIG), gene therapy, and cell therapy (for instance, stem cell therapies).

Pharmaceuticals or drugs or medicines are classified into various other groups besides their origin on the basis of pharmacological properties like mode of action and their pharmacological action or activity, such as by chemical properties, mode or route of administration, biological system affected, or therapeutic effects. An elaborate and widely used classification system is the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System (ATC system). The World Health Organization keeps a list of essential medicines.

A sampling of classes of medicine includes:
# Antipyretics: reducing fever (pyrexia/pyresis)
# Analgesics: reducing pain (painkillers)
# Antimalarial drugs: treating malaria
# Antibiotics: inhibiting germ growth
# Antiseptics: prevention of germ growth near burns, cuts,and wounds
# Mood stabilizers: lithium and valproate
# Hormone replacements: Premarin
# Oral contraceptives: Enovid, &quot;biphasic&quot; pill, and &quot;triphasic&quot; pill
# Stimulants: methylphenidate, amphetamine
# Tranquilizers: meprobamate, chlorpromazine, reserpine, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, and alprazolam
# Statins: lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin
Pharmaceuticals may also be described as &quot;specialty&quot;, independent of other classifications, which is an ill-defined class of drugs that might be difficult to administer, require special handling during administration, require patient monitoring during and immediately after administration, have particular regulatory requirements restricting their use, and are generally expensive relative to other drugs.

== Administration == 

A single drug may contain single or multiple active ingredients.

The administration is the process by which a patient takes medicine. There are three major categories of drug administration: enteral (via the human gastrointestinal tract), injection into the body, and by other routes (dermal, nasal, ophthalmic, otologic, and urogenital).

Oral administration, the most common form of enteral administration, can be performed using various dosage forms including tablets or capsules and liquid such as syrup or suspension. Other ways to take the medication include buccally (placed inside the cheek), sublingually (placed underneath the tongue), eye and ear drops (dropped into the eye or ear), and transdermally (applied to the skin). 

They can be administered in one dose, as a bolus. Administration frequencies are often abbreviated from Latin, such as &quot;every 8 hours&quot; reading Q8H from &quot;Quaque VIII Hora&quot;. The drug frequencies are often expressed as the number of times a drug is used per day (e.g., four times a day). It may include event-related information (e.g., 1 hour before meals, in the morning, at bedtime), or complimentary to an interval, although equivalent expressions may have different implications (e.g., every 8 hours versus 3 times a day).

==Drug discovery==

In the fields of medicine, biotechnology, and pharmacology, drug discovery is the process by which new drugs are discovered.

Historically, drugs were discovered by identifying the active ingredient from traditional remedies or by serendipitous discovery. Later chemical libraries of synthetic small molecules, natural products, or extracts were screened in intact cells or whole organisms to identify substances that have a desirable therapeutic effect in a process known as classical pharmacology. Since sequencing of the human genome which allowed rapid cloning and synthesis of large quantities of purified proteins, it has become common practice to use high throughput screening of large compound libraries against isolated biological targets which are hypothesized to be disease-modifying in a process known as reverse pharmacology. Hits from these screens are then tested in cells and then in animals for efficacy. Even more recently, scientists have been able to understand the shape of biological molecules at the atomic level and to use that knowledge to design (see drug design) drug candidates.

Modern drug discovery involves the identification of screening hits, medicinal chemistry, and optimization of those hits to increase the affinity, selectivity (to reduce the potential of side effects), efficacy/potency, metabolic stability (to increase the half-life), and oral bioavailability. Once a compound that fulfills all of these requirements has been identified, it will begin the process of drug development prior to clinical trials. One or more of these steps may, but not necessarily, involve computer-aided drug design.

Despite advances in technology and understanding of biological systems, drug discovery is still a lengthy, &quot;expensive, difficult, and inefficient process&quot; with a low rate of new therapeutic discovery. In 2010, the research and development cost of each new molecular entity (NME) was approximately US$1.8 billion. Drug discovery is done by pharmaceutical companies, sometimes with research assistance from universities. The &quot;final product&quot; of drug discovery is a patent on the potential drug. The drug requires very expensive Phase I, II, and III clinical trials, and most of them fail. Small companies have a critical role, often then selling the rights to larger companies that have the resources to run the clinical trials.

Drug discovery is different from Drug Development. Drug Discovery is often considered the process of identifying new medicine. At the same time, Drug development is delivering a new drug molecule into clinical practice. In its broad definition, this encompasses all steps from the basic research process of finding a suitable molecular target to supporting the drug&#x27;s commercial launch.

== Development ==
Drug development is the process of bringing a new drug to the market once a lead compound has been identified through the process of drug discovery. It includes pre-clinical research (microorganisms/animals) and clinical trials (on humans) and may include the step of obtaining regulatory approval to market the drug.

Drug Development Process

Discovery: The Drug Development process starts with Discovery, a process of identifying a new medicine.

Development: Chemicals extracted from natural products are used to make pills, capsules, or syrups for oral use. Injections for direct infusion into the blood drops for eyes or ears.

Preclinical research: Drugs go under laboratory or animal testing, to ensure that they can be used on Humans.

Clinical testing: The drug is used on people to confirm that it is safe to use.

FDA Review: drug is sent to FDA before launching the drug into the market.

FDA post-Market Review: The drug is reviewed and monitored by FDA for the safety once it is available to the public.

==Regulation==
The regulation of drugs varies by jurisdiction. In some countries, such as the United States, they are regulated at the national level by a single agency. In other jurisdictions, they are regulated at the state level, or at both state and national levels by various bodies, as is the case in Australia. The role of therapeutic goods regulation is designed mainly to protect the health and safety of the population. Regulation is aimed at ensuring the safety, quality, and efficacy of the therapeutic goods which are covered under the scope of the regulation. In most jurisdictions, therapeutic goods must be registered before they are allowed to be marketed. There is usually some degree of restriction on the availability of certain therapeutic goods depending on their risk to consumers.

Depending upon the jurisdiction, drugs may be divided into over-the-counter drugs (OTC) which may be available without special restrictions, and prescription drugs, which must be prescribed by a licensed medical practitioner in accordance with medical guidelines due to the risk of adverse effects and contraindications. The precise distinction between OTC and prescription depends on the legal jurisdiction. A third category, &quot;behind-the-counter&quot; drugs, is implemented in some jurisdictions. These do not require a prescription, but must be kept in the dispensary, not visible to the public, and be sold only by a pharmacist or pharmacy technician. Doctors may also prescribe prescription drugs for off-label use – purposes which the drugs were not originally approved for by the regulatory agency. The Classification of Pharmaco-Therapeutic Referrals helps guide the referral process between pharmacists and doctors.

The International Narcotics Control Board of the United Nations imposes a world law of prohibition of certain drugs. They publish a lengthy list of chemicals and plants whose trade and consumption (where applicable) are forbidden. OTC drugs are sold without restriction as they are considered safe enough that most people will not hurt themselves accidentally by taking it as instructed. Many countries, such as the United Kingdom have a third category of &quot;pharmacy medicines&quot;, which can be sold only in registered pharmacies by or under the supervision of a pharmacist.

Medical errors include over-prescription and polypharmacy, mis-prescription, contraindication and lack of detail in dosage and administration instructions. In 2000 the definition of a prescription error was studied using a Delphi method conference; the conference was motivated by ambiguity in what a prescription error is and a need to use a uniform definition in studies.

==Drug pricing==

In many jurisdictions, drug prices are regulated.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme is intended to ensure that the National Health Service is able to purchase drugs at reasonable prices. The prices are negotiated between the Department of Health, acting with the authority of Northern Ireland and the UK Government, and the representatives of the Pharmaceutical industry brands, the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI). For 2017 this payment percentage set by the PPRS will be 4,75%.

===Canada===
In Canada, the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board examines drug pricing and determines if a price is excessive or not. In these circumstances, drug manufacturers must submit a proposed price to the appropriate regulatory agency. Furthermore, &quot;the International Therapeutic Class Comparison Test is responsible for comparing the National Average Transaction Price of the patented drug product under review&quot; different countries that the prices are being compared to are the following: France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States

===Brazil===
In Brazil, the prices are regulated through legislation under the name of &quot;Medicamento Genérico&quot; (generic drugs) since 1999.

=== India ===
In India, drug prices are regulated by the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority.

===United States===

In the United States, drug costs are partially unregulated, but instead are the result of negotiations between drug companies and insurance companies.

High prices have been attributed to monopolies given to manufacturers by the government. New drug development costs continue to rise as well. Despite the enormous advances in science and technology, the number of new blockbuster drugs approved by the government per billion dollars spent has halved every 9 years since 1950.

==Blockbuster drug== 

A blockbuster drug is a drug that generates more than $1 billion in revenue for a pharmaceutical company in a single year. Cimetidine was the first drug ever to reach more than $1 billion a year in sales, thus making it the first blockbuster drug.

== History ==
===Prescription drug history===

Antibiotics first arrived on the medical scene in 1932 thanks to Gerhard Domagk; and were coined the &quot;wonder drugs&quot;. The introduction of the sulfa drugs led to the mortality rate from pneumonia in the U.S. to drop from 0.2% each year to 0.05% (, as much) by 1939. Antibiotics inhibit the growth or the metabolic activities of bacteria and other microorganisms by a chemical substance of microbial origin. Penicillin, introduced a few years later, provided a broader spectrum of activity compared to sulfa drugs and reduced side effects. Streptomycin, found in 1942, proved to be the first drug effective against the cause of tuberculosis and also came to be the best known of a long series of important antibiotics. A second generation of antibiotics was introduced in the 1940s: aureomycin and chloramphenicol. Aureomycin was the best known of the second generation.

Lithium was discovered in the 19th century for nervous disorders and its possible mood-stabilizing or prophylactic effect; it was cheap and easily produced. As lithium fell out of favor in France, valpromide came into play. This antibiotic was the origin of the drug that eventually created the mood stabilizer category. Valpromide had distinct psychotrophic effects that were of benefit in both the treatment of acute manic states and in the maintenance treatment of manic depression illness. Psychotropics can either be sedative or stimulant; sedatives aim at damping down the extremes of behavior. Stimulants aim at restoring normality by increasing tone. Soon arose the notion of a tranquilizer which was quite different from any sedative or stimulant. The term tranquilizer took over the notions of sedatives and became the dominant term in the West through the 1980s. In Japan, during this time, the term tranquilizer produced the notion of a psyche-stabilizer and the term mood stabilizer vanished.

Premarin (conjugated estrogens, introduced in 1942) and Prempro (a combination estrogen-progestin pill, introduced in 1995) dominated the hormone replacement therapy (HRT) during the 1990s. HRT is not a life-saving drug, nor does it cure any disease. HRT has been prescribed to improve one&#x27;s quality of life. Doctors prescribe estrogen for their older female patients both to treat short-term menopausal symptoms and to prevent long-term diseases. In the 1960s and early 1970s, more and more physicians began to prescribe estrogen for their female patients. Between 1991 and 1999, Premarin was listed as the most popular prescription and best-selling drug in America.

The first oral contraceptive, Enovid, was approved by FDA in 1960. Oral contraceptives inhibit ovulation and so prevent conception. Enovid was known to be much more effective than alternatives including the condom and the diaphragm. As early as 1960, oral contraceptives were available in several different strengths by every manufacturer. In the 1980s and 1990s, an increasing number of options arose including, most recently, a new delivery system for the oral contraceptive via a transdermal patch. In 1982, a new version of &quot;the pill&quot; was introduced, known as the biphasic pill. By 1985, a new triphasic pill was approved. Physicians began to think of &quot;the pill&quot; as an excellent means of birth control for young women.

Stimulants such as Ritalin (methylphenidate) came to be pervasive tools for behavior management and modification in young children. Ritalin was first marketed in 1955 for narcolepsy; its potential users were middle-aged and the elderly. It was not until some time in the 1980s along with hyperactivity in children that Ritalin came onto the market. Medical use of methylphenidate is predominantly for symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Consumption of methylphenidate in the U.S. out-paced all other countries between 1991 and 1999. Significant growth in consumption was also evident in Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and Norway. Currently, 85% of the world&#x27;s methylphenidate is consumed in America.

The first minor tranquilizer was meprobamate. Only fourteen months after it was made available, meprobamate had become the country&#x27;s largest-selling prescription drug. By 1957, meprobamate had become the fastest-growing drug in history. The popularity of meprobamate paved the way for Librium and Valium, two minor tranquilizers that belonged to a new chemical class of drugs called the benzodiazepines. These were drugs that worked chiefly as anti-anxiety agents and muscle relaxants. The first benzodiazepine was Librium. Three months after it was approved, Librium had become the most prescribed tranquilizer in the nation. Three years later, Valium hit the shelves and was ten times more effective as a muscle relaxant and anti-convulsant. Valium was the most versatile of the minor tranquilizers. Later came the widespread adoption of major tranquilizers such as chlorpromazine and the drug reserpine. In 1970, sales began to decline for Valium and Librium, but sales of new and improved tranquilizers, such as Xanax, introduced in 1981 for the newly created diagnosis of panic disorder, soared.

Mevacor (lovastatin) is the first and most influential statin in the American market. The 1991 launch of Pravachol (pravastatin), the second available in the United States, and the release of Zocor (simvastatin) made Mevacor no longer the only statin on the market.
In 1998, Viagra was released as a treatment for erectile dysfunction.

===Ancient pharmacology===
Using plants and plant substances to treat all kinds of diseases and medical conditions is believed to date back to prehistoric medicine.

The Kahun Gynaecological Papyrus, the oldest known medical text of any kind, dates to about 1800 BC and represents the first documented use of any kind of drug. It and other medical papyri describe Ancient Egyptian medical practices, such as using honey to treat infections and the legs of bee-eaters to treat neck pains.

Ancient Babylonian medicine demonstrated the use of medication in the first half of the 2nd millennium BC. Medicinal creams and pills were employed as treatments.

On the Indian subcontinent, the Atharvaveda, a sacred text of Hinduism whose core dates from the second millennium BC, although the hymns recorded in it are believed to be older, is the first Indic text dealing with medicine. It describes plant-based drugs to counter diseases. The earliest foundations of ayurveda were built on a synthesis of selected ancient herbal practices, together with a massive addition of theoretical conceptualizations, new nosologies and new therapies dating from about 400 BC onwards. The student of Āyurveda was expected to know ten arts that were indispensable in the preparation and application of his medicines: distillation, operative skills, cooking, horticulture, metallurgy, sugar manufacture, pharmacy, analysis and separation of minerals, compounding of metals, and preparation of alkalis.

The Hippocratic Oath for physicians, attributed to fifth century BC Greece, refers to the existence of &quot;deadly drugs&quot;, and ancient Greek physicians imported drugs from Egypt and elsewhere. The pharmacopoeia , written between 50 and 70 CE by the Greek physician Pedanius Dioscorides, was widely read for more than 1,500 years.

===Medieval pharmacology===
Al-Kindi&#x27;s ninth century AD book, &quot;De Gradibus&quot; and Ibn Sina (Avicenna)&#x27;s &quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot;, covers a range of drugs known to the practice of medicine in the medieval Islamic world.

Medieval medicine of Western Europe saw advances in surgery compared to previously, but few truly effective drugs existed, beyond opium (found in such extremely popular drugs as the &quot;Great Rest&quot; of the Antidotarium Nicolai at the time) and quinine. Folklore cures and potentially poisonous metal-based compounds were popular treatments. Theodoric Borgognoni, (1205–1296), one of the most significant surgeons of the medieval period, responsible for introducing and promoting important surgical advances including basic antiseptic practice and the use of anaesthetics. Garcia de Orta described some herbal treatments that were used.

===Modern pharmacology===
For most of the 19th century, drugs were not highly effective, leading Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. to famously comment in 1842 that &quot;if all medicines in the world were thrown into the sea, it would be all the better for mankind and all the worse for the fishes&quot;.

During the First World War, Alexis Carrel and Henry Dakin developed the Carrel-Dakin method of treating wounds with an irrigation, Dakin&#x27;s solution, a germicide which helped prevent gangrene.

In the inter-war period, the first anti-bacterial agents such as the sulpha antibiotics were developed. The Second World War saw the introduction of widespread and effective antimicrobial therapy with the development and mass production of penicillin antibiotics, made possible by the pressures of the war and the collaboration of British scientists with the American pharmaceutical industry.

Medicines commonly used by the late 1920s included aspirin, codeine, and morphine for pain; digitalis, nitroglycerin, and quinine for heart disorders, and insulin for diabetes. Other drugs included antitoxins, a few biological vaccines, and a few synthetic drugs. In the 1930s, antibiotics emerged: first sulfa drugs, then penicillin and other antibiotics. Drugs increasingly became &quot;the center of medical practice&quot;. In the 1950s, other drugs emerged including corticosteroids for inflammation, rauvolfia alkaloids as tranquilizers and antihypertensives, antihistamines for nasal allergies, xanthines for asthma, and typical antipsychotics for psychosis. As of 2007, thousands of approved drugs have been developed. Increasingly, biotechnology is used to discover biopharmaceuticals. Recently, multi-disciplinary approaches have yielded a wealth of new data on the development of novel antibiotics and antibacterials and on the use of biological agents for antibacterial therapy.

In the 1950s, new psychiatric drugs, notably the antipsychotic chlorpromazine, were designed in laboratories and slowly came into preferred use. Although often accepted as an advance in some ways, there was some opposition, due to serious adverse effects such as tardive dyskinesia. Patients often opposed psychiatry and refused or stopped taking the drugs when not subject to psychiatric control.

Governments have been heavily involved in the regulation of drug development and drug sales. In the U.S., the Elixir Sulfanilamide disaster led to the establishment of the Food and Drug Administration, and the 1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act required manufacturers to file new drugs with the FDA. The 1951 Humphrey-Durham Amendment required certain drugs to be sold by prescription. In 1962, a subsequent amendment required new drugs to be tested for efficacy and safety in clinical trials.

Until the 1970s, drug prices were not a major concern for doctors and patients. As more drugs became prescribed for chronic illnesses, however, costs became burdensome, and by the 1970s nearly every U.S. state required or encouraged the substitution of generic drugs for higher-priced brand names. This also led to the 2006 U.S. law, Medicare Part D, which offers Medicare coverage for drugs.

As of 2008, the United States is the leader in medical research, including pharmaceutical development. U.S. drug prices are among the highest in the world, and drug innovation is correspondingly high. In 2000, U.S.-based firms developed 29 of the 75 top-selling drugs; firms from the second-largest market, Japan, developed eight, and the United Kingdom contributed 10. France, which imposes price controls, developed three. Throughout the 1990s, outcomes were similar.

==Controversies==

Controversies concerning pharmaceutical drugs include patient access to drugs under development and not yet approved, pricing, and environmental issues.

===Access to unapproved drugs===

Governments worldwide have created provisions for granting access to drugs prior to approval for patients who have exhausted all alternative treatment options and do not match clinical trial entry criteria. Often grouped under the labels of compassionate use, expanded access, or named patient supply, these programs are governed by rules which vary by country defining access criteria, data collection, promotion, and control of drug distribution.

Within the United States, pre-approval demand is generally met through treatment IND (investigational new drug) applications (INDs), or single-patient INDs. These mechanisms, which fall under the label of expanded access programs, provide access to drugs for groups of patients or individuals residing in the US. Outside the US, Named Patient Programs provide controlled, pre-approval access to drugs in response to requests by physicians on behalf of specific, or &quot;named&quot;, patients before those medicines are licensed in the patient&#x27;s home country. Through these programs, patients are able to access drugs in late-stage clinical trials or approved in other countries for a genuine, unmet medical need, before those drugs have been licensed in the patient&#x27;s home country.

Patients who have not been able to get access to drugs in development have organized and advocated for greater access. In the United States, ACT UP formed in the 1980s, and eventually formed its Treatment Action Group in part to pressure the US government to put more resources into discovering treatments for AIDS and then to speed release of drugs that were under development.

The Abigail Alliance was established in November 2001 by Frank Burroughs in memory of his daughter, Abigail. The Alliance seeks broader availability of investigational drugs on behalf of terminally ill patients.

In 2013, BioMarin Pharmaceutical was at the center of a high-profile debate regarding expanded access of cancer patients to experimental drugs.

===Access to medicines and drug pricing===
Essential medicines, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), are &quot;those drugs that satisfy the health care needs of the majority of the population; they should therefore be available at all times in adequate amounts and in appropriate dosage forms, at a price the community can afford.&quot; Recent studies have found that most of the medicines on the WHO essential medicines list, outside of the field of HIV drugs, are not patented in the developing world, and that lack of widespread access to these medicines arise from issues fundamental to economic development – lack of infrastructure and poverty. Médecins Sans Frontières also runs a Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines campaign, which includes advocacy for greater resources to be devoted to currently untreatable diseases that primarily occur in the developing world. The Access to Medicine Index tracks how well pharmaceutical companies make their products available in the developing world.

World Trade Organization negotiations in the 1990s, including the TRIPS Agreement and the Doha Declaration, have centered on issues at the intersection of international trade in pharmaceuticals and intellectual property rights, with developed world nations seeking strong intellectual property rights to protect investments made to develop new drugs, and developing world nations seeking to promote their generic pharmaceuticals industries and their ability to make medicine available to their people via compulsory licenses.

Some have raised ethical objections specifically with respect to pharmaceutical patents and the high prices for drugs that they enable their proprietors to charge, which poor people around the world, cannot afford. Critics also question the rationale that exclusive patent rights and the resulting high prices are required for pharmaceutical companies to recoup the large investments needed for research and development. One study concluded that marketing expenditures for new drugs often doubled the amount that was allocated for research and development. Other critics claim that patent settlements would be costly for consumers, the health care system, and state and federal governments because it would result in delaying access to lower cost generic medicines.

Novartis fought a protracted battle with the government of India over the patenting of its drug, Gleevec, in India, which ended up in a Supreme Court in a case known as Novartis v. Union of India &amp; Others. The Supreme Court ruled narrowly against Novartis, but opponents of patenting drugs claimed it as a major victory.

===Environmental issues===
Pharmaceutical medications are commonly described as &quot;ubiquitous&quot; in nearly every type of environmental medium (i.e. lakes, rivers, streams, estuaries, seawater, and soil) worldwide. Their chemical components are typically present at relatively low concentrations in the ng/L to μg/L ranges. The primary avenue for medications reaching the environment are through the effluent of wastewater treatment plants, both from industrial plants during production, and from municipal plants after consumption. Agricultural pollution is another significant source derived from the prevalence of antibiotic use in livestock.

Scientists generally divide environmental impacts of a chemical into three primary categories: persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity. Since medications are inherently bio-active, most are naturally degradable in the environment, however they are classified as &quot;pseudopersistent&quot; because they are constantly being replenished from their sources. These Environmentally Persistent Pharmaceutical Pollutants (EPPPs) rarely reach toxic concentrations in the environment, however they have been known to bioaccumulate in some species. Their effects have been observed to compound gradually across food webs, rather than becoming acute, leading to their classification by the US Geological Survey as &quot;Ecological Disrupting Compounds.&quot;

<text>August Friedrich Ferdinand von Kotzebue (, ; – ) was a German playwright, who had also worked as a Russian diplomat.

In 1817, one of Kotzebue&#x27;s books was burned during the Wartburg festival. He was murdered in 1819 by Karl Ludwig Sand, a militant member of the &quot;Burschenschaften&quot;. This murder gave Metternich the pretext to issue the Carlsbad Decrees of 1819, which dissolved the &quot;Burschenschaften&quot;, cracked down on the liberal press, and seriously restricted academic freedom in the states of the German Confederation.

==Life==
Kotzebue was born on May 3, 1761 in Weimar, Saxe-Weimar, to the respected merchant Kotzebue family and was educated at Wilhelm-Ernst-Gymnasium in Weimar, where his uncle, the writer and critic Johann Karl August Musäus was among his teachers. In 1776 the young Kotzebue acted alongside Goethe in the latter&#x27;s play &quot;Die Geschwister&quot; when it premiered in Weimar. In 1777, aged sixteen, he enrolled at the University of Jena to study legal science. He continued his studies at the University of Duisburg, graduating in 1780, and practiced initially as a lawyer in Weimar.

Through his association with Graf Goertz, Prussian ambassador at the Russian court, Kotzebue became secretary to the Governor General of Saint Petersburg. In 1783 he was appointed assessor to the high court of appeals in Reval, where he married the daughter of a Russian lieutenant general. He was ennobled in 1785 and became president of the &quot;Magistrat&quot; of the Governorate of Estonia, a province of the Russian Empire.

In Reval his first literary works were favourably received. His novels &quot;Die Leiden der Ortenbergischen Familie&quot; (&quot;The Sorrows of the Ortenberg Family&quot;) (1785) and &quot;Geschichte meines Vaters&quot; (&quot;History of my Father&quot;) (1788) met with appreciation; even more so did his plays &quot;Adelheid von Wulfingen&quot; (1789), &quot;Menschenhass und Reue&quot; (&quot;Misanthropy and Repentance&quot;) (1790) and &quot;Die Indianer in England&quot; (&quot;The Indians in England&quot;) (1790).

The good reputation of these works was, however, almost destroyed by a controversial dramatic satire, &quot;Doktor Bahrdt mit der eisernen Stirn&quot; (&quot;Doctor Bahrdt with the Iron Brow&quot;), which appeared in 1790 with the name of Knigge on the title page. Written in response to contention between Johann Georg Ritter von Zimmermann and leaders of Berlin&#x27;s party of the Enlightenment, it linked each of Zimmermann&#x27;s opponents to a particular sexual perversion. Kotzebue denied authorship, even when the police began to investigate the matter. This alienated both Zimmermann and Knigge, formerly his allies, and also gained Kotzebue a reputation for dishonesty and lasciviousness that he would never shake off.

After the death of his first wife in 1790, Kotzebue retired from the Russian service and lived for a time in Paris and Mainz. In 1795 he settled on an estate which he had acquired near Reval and devoted himself to writing. In the space of only a few years, he published six volumes of miscellaneous sketches and stories (&quot;Die jüngsten Kinder meiner Laune&quot;, 1793–1796) and more than twenty plays, many of which were translated into several European languages.

In 1798 he was appointed dramatist to the court theatre in Vienna, but differences with the actors soon obliged him to resign. He then returned to his native town, but as he was not on good terms with the powerful Goethe and had openly attacked the romantic style for which Goethe was known, his position in Weimar was uncomfortable.

In April 1800 he decided to return to Saint Petersburg, but on his journey there he was arrested at the border on suspicion of being a Jacobin and was escorted to Tobolsk in Siberia. On June 11, 1800, he was sent from Tobolsk to Kurgan, where he arrived 6 days later. However, he had written a comedy which flattered the vanity of Emperor Paul I of Russia; he was soon brought back, presented with an estate in Vooru from the crown lands of Livonia, have received rank of court councillor, and appointed director of the German theatre in Saint Petersburg. On July 7, 1800, he left Kurgan. Kotzebue wrote about this period in his life in the autobiographical &quot;Das merkwürdigste Jahr meines Lebens&quot; (&quot;The strangest Year of my Life&quot;).

Kotzebue returned to Germany in 1801, after the assassination of the Emperor Paul I. Failing to establish himself in Weimar&#x27;s literary circles, he moved to Berlin, where he edited &quot;Der Freimutige&quot; in collaboration with Garlieb Merkel from 1803 to 1807. In 1803 he began his &quot;Almanach dramatischer Spiele&quot; (&quot;Almanac of the Dramatic Arts&quot;), which was published posthumously in 1820.

In 1806, after Napoleon&#x27;s victory in the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, Kotzebue fled to Russia and, in the safety of his estate in Jerlep, Estonia, wrote many satirical articles against Napoleon Bonaparte, published in his journals &quot;Die Biene&quot; (&quot;The Bee&quot;) and &quot;Die Grille&quot; (&quot;The Cricket&quot;).

He started working for the department of foreign affairs in Saint Petersburg in 1816 and was sent to Germany as consul general for Russia a year later. Some suspected him of being a spy, and this view persisted for a long time, but in modern times it has been shown to be unfounded: he reported only on matters that were already public knowledge. Nevertheless, it is fair to say he was Russia&#x27;s advocate in Germany.

==Assassination==

In a weekly journal (&quot;Literarisches Wochenblatt&quot;) which he published in Weimar, he scoffed at the pretensions of those Germans who demanded free institutions, and soon became detested by nationalist liberals. One of them, Karl Ludwig Sand, a theology student, plotted to kill him. On 23 March 1819, soon after Kotzebue had moved with his family to Mannheim, Sand attacked Kotzebue at his house. According to Alexandre Dumas, père, when one of Kotzebue&#x27;s children appeared and started to cry, Sand became overwrought and stabbed himself.

Sand was arrested and carefully nursed back to health. At his trial, he protested that Kotzebue was an enemy of the German people, but he was convicted of the murder and executed later that year.

The assassination of Kotzebue provided Prince Metternich with arguments to convince the Confederation to enact the Carlsbad Decrees, imposing greater restrictions on universities and the press. After the death of Kotzebue, Ernst Ackermann remained as the sole editor of the &quot;Literarisches Wochenblatt&quot;.

==Work==
Though he was unfavourably reviewed by critics many of whom saw his work as immoral Kotzebue was one of the most popular writers of his time. In his essay &quot;Why Do I Have So Many Enemies?&quot;, he blamed jealousy of his fame. He was politically conservative and cosmopolitan in outlook and spoke out against the antisemitism of student nationalists. 

He was approached in 1812 by Beethoven, who suggested that Kotzebue write the libretto for an opera about Attila, which was never written. Beethoven did, however, produce incidental music for two of Kotzebue&#x27;s plays, &quot;The Ruins of Athens&quot; (Beethoven&#x27;s opus 113) and &quot;King Stephen&quot; (opus 117).

Besides his plays, Kotzebue wrote several historical works: his &quot;History of the German Empires&quot; was burned by nationalist students at the 1817 Wartburg Festival (which Sand attended).

Still read are his autobiographical writings, &quot;Meine Flucht nach Paris im Winter 1790&quot; (1791), &quot;Über meinen Aufenthalt in Wien&quot; (1799), &quot;Das merkwürdigste Jahr meines Lebens&quot; (1801), &quot;Erinnerungen aus Paris&quot; (1804), and &quot;Erinnerungen von meiner Reise aus Liefland nach Rom und Neapel&quot; (1805).

As a dramatist he was extremely prolific: his plays numbered over 200 and were highly popular, not only in Germany but throughout Europe. His success, however, was seen as due less to any conspicuous literary or poetic ability than to his great facility in the invention of effective situations. He is at his best in comedies such as &quot;Der Wildfang&quot;, &quot;Die beiden Klingsberg&quot; and &quot;Die deutschen Kleinstädter&quot;, which contain cameos of German life. These plays held the stage in Germany long after the once-famous &quot;Menschenhass und Reue&quot; (&quot;Misanthropy and Repentance&quot;, but known in England as &quot;The Stranger&quot;), &quot;Graf Benjowsky&quot;, and ambitious exotic tragedies like &quot;Die Sonnenjungfrau&quot; and &quot;Die Spanier in Peru&quot; (which Sheridan adapted as &quot;Pizarro&quot;) were forgotten.

Theatre historians usually consider the runaway success of &quot;The Stranger&quot;, the English version of &quot;Menschenhass und Reue&quot;, in both England (where it opened in 1798) and the United States as one of the harbingers of the emerging popularity of theatrical melodrama, which dominated European and American stages for the first seventy-five years of the nineteenth century.

Two collections of Kotzebue&#x27;s dramas were published during his lifetime: &quot;Schauspiele&quot; (5 vols., 1797); &quot;Neue Schauspiele&quot; (23 vols., 1798–1820). His &quot;Sämtliche dramatische Werke&quot; appeared in 44 volumes in 1827–1829, and again, under the title &quot;Theater&quot;, in 40 volumes in 1840–1841. A selection of his plays in 10 volumes appeared in Leipzig in 1867–1868. See Heinrich Doring, &quot;A. von Kotzebues Leben&quot; (1830); W. von Kotzebue, &quot;A. von Kotzebue&quot; (1881); Ch. Rabany, &quot;Kotzebue, sa vie et son temps&quot; (1893); W. Sellier, &quot;Kotzebue in England&quot; (1901).

==Legacy==

Kotzebue was the father of 18 children, among them Karl von Kotzebue (diplomat), Moritz von Kotzebue, Paul Demetrius Kotzebue, Alexander Kotzebue and the explorer Otto von Kotzebue.

Kotzebue Street in Kalamaja, Tallinn, Estonia, is named after him and other family members who lived on the street, especially his son Otto.

&quot;Rejected Addresses&quot; (1812) by Robert and Horace Smith, contains a &quot;travestie&quot; parody of &quot;The Stranger&quot;.

Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Turkish March&quot;, originally written as part of the incidental music to von Kotzebue&#x27;s &quot;The Ruins of Athens&quot;, became one of this composer&#x27;s most well-known pieces.

Jane Austen saw a Kotzebue play, &quot;The Birthday&quot;, at Bath in 1799. In her novel &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; she used a version of another of his plays, &quot;Das Kind der Liebe&quot;, adapted by Elizabeth Inchbald as &quot;Lover&#x27;s Vows&quot; (1798).

<text>Whittaker Chambers (born Jay Vivian Chambers; April 1, 1901 – July 9, 1961) was an American writer and intelligence agent. After early years as a Communist Party member (1925) and Soviet spy (1932–1938), he defected from the Soviet underground in 1938. He then worked for &quot;Time&quot; magazine (1939–1948) before his testimony about the Ware Group and the participation of Alger Hiss saw Chambers sued for libel in 1948 (which led to charges of perjury for Hiss) in a case referred to as &quot;the trial of the century&quot;, all described in his 1952 memoir &quot;Witness&quot;. Afterwards, he worked as a senior editor at &quot;National Review&quot; (1957–1959). US President Ronald Reagan awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously in 1984.

==Background==

Chambers was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and spent his infancy in Brooklyn. His family moved to Lynbrook, Long Island, New York State, in 1904, where he grew up and attended school. His parents were Jay Chambers and Laha Whittaker. He described his childhood as troubled because of his parents&#x27; separation and their need to care for their mentally-ill grandmother. His father was an artist and member of the Decorative Designers; his mother was last a social worker. Chambers&#x27;s brother, Richard Godfrey Chambers committed suicide shortly after he had withdrawn from college at age 22. Chambers cited his brother&#x27;s fate as one of many reasons that he was then drawn to communism. As he wrote, it &quot;offered me what nothing else in the dying world had power to offer at the same intensity, faith and a vision, something for which to live and something for which to die.&quot;

===Education===
After graduating from South Side High School in neighboring Rockville Centre in 1919, Chambers worked itinerantly in Washington and New Orleans, briefly attended Williams College and then enrolled as a day student at Columbia College of Columbia University. At Columbia, his undergraduate peers included Meyer Schapiro, Frank S. Hogan, Herbert Solow, Louis Zukofsky, Arthur F. Burns, Clifton Fadiman, Elliott V. Bell, John Gassner, Lionel Trilling (who later fictionalized him as a main character in his novel &quot;The Middle of the Journey&quot;), Guy Endore, and City College student poet Henry Zolinsky. In the intellectual environment of Columbia, he gained friends and respect. His professors and fellow students found him a talented writer and believed he might become a major poet or novelist.

In his sophomore year, Chambers joined the Boar&#x27;s Head Society and wrote a play called &quot;A Play for Puppets&quot; for Columbia&#x27;s literary magazine &quot;The Morningside&quot;, which he edited. The work was deemed blasphemous by many students and administrators, and the controversy spread to New York City newspapers. Later, the play would be used against Chambers during his testimony against Hiss. Disheartened over the controversy, Chambers left Columbia in 1925. From Columbia, Chambers also knew Isaiah Oggins, who had gone into the Soviet underground a few years earlier; Chambers&#x27;s wife, Esther Shemitz Chambers, knew Oggins&#x27;s wife, Nerma Berman Oggins, from the Rand School of Social Science, the International Ladies&#x27; Garment Workers&#x27; Union, and &quot;The World Tomorrow&quot;.

===Communism espionage===
In 1924, Chambers read Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s &quot;Soviets at Work&quot; and was deeply affected by it. He now saw the dysfunctional nature of his family, he would write, as &quot;in miniature the whole crisis of the middle class&quot;, a malaise from which communism promised liberation. Chambers&#x27;s biographer Sam Tanenhaus wrote that Lenin&#x27;s authoritarianism was &quot;precisely what attracts Chambers. ... He had at last found his church.&quot; Chambers became a Marxist and, in 1925, joined the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA), then known as the Workers Party of America.

==Career==

===Communist===
Chambers wrote and edited for the magazine &quot;New Masses&quot; and was an editor for the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; newspaper from 1927 to 1929.

Combining his literary talents with his devotion to communism, Chambers wrote four short stories for &quot;New Masses&quot; in 1931 about proletarian hardship and revolt, including &quot;Can You Make Out Their Voices?&quot;, which was considered by critics as one of the best pieces of fiction of American communism. Hallie Flanagan co-adapted and produced it as a play entitled &quot;Can You Hear Their Voices?&quot; (see Bibliography of Whittaker Chambers), staged across America and in many other countries. Chambers also worked as a translator, his works including the English version of Felix Salten&#x27;s 1923 novel &quot;Bambi, a Life in the Woods&quot;.

===Soviet underground===

====Ware group====

Chambers was recruited to join the &quot;communist underground&quot; and began his career as a spy, working for a GRU (Main Intelligence Directorate) spy ring headed by Alexander Ulanovsky, also known as Ulrich. Later, his main handler was Josef Peters, who was replaced by CPUSA General Secretary Earl Browder with Rudy Baker. Chambers claimed that Peters introduced him to Harold Ware (although he later denied Peters had ever been introduced to Ware, and also testified to HUAC that he, Chambers, never knew Ware). Chambers claimed that Ware was head of a communist underground cell in Washington that reportedly included the following:

Apart from Marion Bachrach, these individuals were all members of Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal administration. Chambers worked in Washington as an organizer in communists in the city and as a courier between New York and Washington for stolen documents, which were delivered to Boris Bykov, the GRU station chief.

====Other covert sources====
Using the codename &quot;Karl&quot; or &quot;Carl&quot;, Chambers served during the mid-1930s as a courier between various covert sources and Soviet intelligence. In addition to the Ware group mentioned above, other sources that Chambers alleged to have dealt with included the following:
===Defection===

Chambers carried on his espionage activities from 1932 until 1937 or 1938 even while his faith in communism was waning. He became increasingly disturbed by Joseph Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge, which began in 1936. He was also fearful for his own life since he had noted the murder in Switzerland of Ignace Reiss, a high-ranking Soviet spy who had broken with Stalin, and the disappearance of Chambers&#x27;s friend and fellow spy Juliet Stuart Poyntz in the United States. Poyntz had vanished in 1937, shortly after she had visited Moscow and returned disillusioned with the communist cause because of the Stalinist Purges.

Chambers ignored several orders that he travel to Moscow since he worried that he might be &quot;purged&quot;. He also started concealing some of the documents he collected from his sources. He planned to use them, along with several rolls of microfilm photographs of documents, as a &quot;life preserver&quot; to prevent the Soviets from killing him and his family.

In 1938, Chambers broke with communism and took his family into hiding. He stored the &quot;life preserver&quot; at the home of his wife&#x27;s sister, whose son Nathan Levine was Chambers&#x27;s lawyer. Initially, he had no plans to give information on his espionage activities to the U.S. government. His espionage contacts were his friends, and he had no desire to inform on them.

In his examination of Chambers&#x27;s conversion from the left to the right, author Daniel Oppenheimer noted that Chambers substituted his passion for communism with a passion for God and saw the world in black-and-white terms both before and after his defection. In his autobiography, Chambers presented his devotion to communism as a reason for living, but after his defection, he saw his actions as being part of an &quot;absolute evil&quot;.

===Berle meeting===
The August 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact drove Chambers to take action against the Soviet Union. In September 1939, at the urging of the anticommunist Russian-born journalist Isaac Don Levine, Chambers and Levine met with Assistant Secretary of State Adolf A. Berle. Levine had introduced Chambers to Walter Krivitsky, who was already informing American and British authorities about Soviet agents who held posts in both governments. Krivitsky told Chambers that it was their duty to inform. Chambers agreed to reveal what he knew on the condition of immunity from prosecution. 

During the meeting at Berle&#x27;s home, Woodley Mansion, in Washington, Chambers named several current and former government employees as spies or communist sympathizers. Many names mentioned held relatively minor posts or were already under suspicion. Some names were more significant and surprising: Alger Hiss, his brother Donald Hiss, and Laurence Duggan, who were all respected, mid-level officials in the State Department, and Lauchlin Currie, a special assistant to Franklin Roosevelt. Another person named Vincent Reno had worked on a top-secret bombsight project at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds.

Berle found Chambers&#x27;s information tentative, unclear, and uncorroborated. He took the information to the White House, but President Franklin Roosevelt dismissed it. Berle made little if any objection, but he kept his notes, which were later used as evidence during Hiss&#x27;s perjury trials.

Berle notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation of Chambers&#x27;s information in March 1940. In February 1941, Krivitsky was found dead in his hotel room. Police ruled the death a suicide, but it was widely speculated that Krivitsky had been killed by Soviet intelligence. Worried that the Soviets might try to kill Chambers too, Berle again told the FBI about his interview with Chambers. The FBI interviewed Chambers in May 1942 and June 1945 but took no immediate action in line with the political orientation of the United States, which viewed the potential threat from the Soviet Union as minor compared to that of Nazi Germany. Only in November 1945, when Elizabeth Bentley defected and corroborated much of Chambers&#x27;s story, would the FBI begin to take Chambers seriously.

===&quot;Time&quot;===
During the Berle meeting, Chambers had come out of hiding after a year and joined the staff of &quot;Time&quot; (April 1939). He landed a cover story within a month on James Joyce&#x27;s latest book, &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;. He started at the back of the magazine, reviewing books and film with James Agee and then Calvin Fixx. When Fixx suffered a heart attack in October 1942, Wilder Hobson succeeded him as Chambers&#x27;s assistant editor in Arts &amp; Entertainment. Other writers working for Chambers in that section included novelist Nigel Dennis, future &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; editor Harvey Breit, and poets Howard Moss and Weldon Kees.

A struggle had arisen between those, like Theodore H. White and Richard Lauterbach, who raised criticism of what they saw as the elitism, corruption and ineptitude of Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s regime in China and advocated greater co-operation with Mao&#x27;s Red Army in the struggle against Japanese imperialism, and Chambers and others like Willi Schlamm who adhered to a perspective that was staunchly pro-Chiang, anticommunist, and both later joined the founding editorial board of William F. Buckley, Jr.&#x27;s &quot;National Review&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; founder Henry Luce, who grew up in China and was a personal friend of Chiang and his wife, Soong Mei-ling, came down squarely on the side of Chambers to the point that White complained that his stories were being censored and even suppressed in their entirety, and he left &quot;Time&quot; shortly after the war as a result.

In 1940, William Saroyan lists Fixx among &quot;contributing editors&quot; at &quot;Time&quot; in Saroyan&#x27;s play, &quot;Love&#x27;s Old Sweet Song&quot;. Luce promoted him senior editor in either summer 1942 (Weinstein) or September 1943 (Tanenhaus) and became a member of &quot;Time&quot; &quot;Senior Group&quot;, which determined editorial policy, in December 1943.

Chambers, close colleagues, and many staff members in the 1930s helped elevate &quot;Time&quot; and have been called &quot;interstitial intellectuals&quot; by the historian Robert Vanderlan. His colleague John Hersey described them as follows:

&quot;Time&quot; was in an interesting phase; an editor named Tom Matthews had gathered a brilliant group of writers, including James Agee, Robert Fitzgerald, Whittaker Chambers, Robert Cantwell, Louis Kronenberger, and Calvin Fixx. ... They were dazzling. &quot;Time&quot; style was still very hokey—&quot;backward ran sentences till reeled the mind&quot;—but I could tell, even as a neophyte, who had written each of the pieces in the magazine, because each of these writers had such a distinctive voice.

By early 1948, Chambers had become one of the best known writer-editors at &quot;Time&quot;. First had come his scathing commentary &quot;The Ghosts on the Roof&quot; (March 5, 1945) on the Yalta Conference in which Hiss partook. Subsequent cover-story essays profiled Marian Anderson, Arnold J. Toynbee, Rebecca West and Reinhold Niebuhr. The cover story on Marian Anderson (&quot;Religion: In Egypt Land&quot;, December 30, 1946) proved so popular that the magazine broke its rule of non-attribution in response to readers&#x27; letters:

Most Time cover stories are written and edited by the regular staffs of the section in which they appear. Certain cover stories, that present special difficulties or call for a special literary skill, are written by Senior Editor Whittaker Chambers.

In a 1945 letter to &quot;Time&quot; colleague Charles Wertenbaker, Time-Life deputy editorial director John Shaw Billings said of Chambers, &quot;Whit puts on the best show in words of any writer we&#x27;ve ever had ... a superb technician, particularly skilled in the mosaic art of putting a &quot;Time&quot; section together.&quot; Chambers was at the height of his career when the Hiss case broke later that year.

===Hiss case===

On August 3, 1948, Chambers was called to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), where he gave the names of individuals he said were part of the underground &quot;Ware group&quot; in the late 1930s, including Alger Hiss. He once again named Hiss as a member of the Communist Party but did not yet make any accusations of espionage. In subsequent sessions, Hiss testified and initially denied that he knew anyone by the name of Chambers, but on seeing him in person and after it became clear that Chambers knew details about Hiss&#x27;s life, Hiss said that he had known Chambers under the name &quot;George Crosley&quot;. 

Hiss denied that he had ever been a communist. Since Chambers still presented no evidence, the committee had initially been inclined to take the word of Hiss on the matter. However, a committee member, Richard Nixon, received secret information from the FBI that had led him to pursue the issue. When it issued its report, HUAC described Hiss&#x27;s testimony as &quot;vague and evasive&quot;.

Biographer Timothy Naftali describes the trial as &quot;a battle between two queers&quot;, an allusion to the fact that both parties were supposedly homosexual. Additionally, Hiss&#x27;s stepson, Timothy Hobson, alleged that Chambers&#x27;s accusation was borne out of unrequited romantic feelings for Hiss.

====&quot;Red Herring&quot;====
The country quickly became divided over Hiss and Chambers. President Harry S. Truman, not pleased with the allegation that the man who had presided over the United Nations Charter Conference was a communist, dismissed the case as a &quot;red herring&quot;.
In the atmosphere of increasing anticommunism that would later be termed McCarthyism, many conservatives viewed the Hiss case as emblematic of what they saw as Democrats&#x27; laxity towards the danger of communist infiltration and influence in the State Department. Many liberals, in turn, saw the Hiss case as part of the desperation of the Republican Party to regain the office of president since it had been out of power for 16 years. Truman also issued Executive Order 9835, which initiated a program of loyalty reviews for federal employees in 1947.

====&quot;Pumpkin Papers&quot;====
Hiss filed a $75,000 libel suit against Chambers on October 8, 1948. Under pressure from Hiss&#x27;s lawyers, Chambers finally retrieved his envelope of evidence and presented it to the HUAC after it had subpoenaed them. It contained four notes in Hiss&#x27;s handwriting, 65 typewritten copies of State Department documents and five strips of microfilm, some of which contained photographs of State Department documents. The press came to call these the &quot;Pumpkin Papers&quot; since Chambers had briefly hidden the microfilm in a hollowed-out pumpkin. The documents indicated that Hiss knew Chambers long after mid-1936, when Hiss said he had last seen &quot;Crosley&quot;, and also that Hiss had engaged in espionage with Chambers. Chambers explained his delay in producing the evidence as an effort to spare an old friend from more trouble than necessary. Until October 1948, Chambers had repeatedly stated that Hiss had not engaged in espionage, even when Chambers testified under oath. Chambers was forced to testify at the Hiss trials that he had committed perjury several times, which reduced his credibility in the eyes of his critics.

The five rolls of 35 mm film known as the &quot;pumpkin papers&quot; were thought until late 1974 to be locked in HUAC files. The independent researcher Stephen W. Salant, an economist at the University of Michigan, sued the U.S. Justice Department in 1975 when his request for access to them under the Freedom of Information Act was denied. On July 31, 1975, as a result of this lawsuit and follow-on suits filed by Peter Irons and by Alger Hiss and William Reuben, the Justice Department released copies of the &quot;pumpkin papers&quot; that had been used to implicate Hiss. One roll of film turned out to be totally blank because of overexposure, two others are faintly-legible copies of nonclassified Navy Department documents relating to such subjects as life rafts and fire extinguishers, and the remaining two are photographs of the State Department documents introduced by the prosecution at the two Hiss trials, relating to US-German relations in the late 1930s.

That story, however, as reported by &quot;The New York Times&quot; in the 1970s, contains only a partial truth. The blank roll had been mentioned by Chambers in his autobiography, &quot;Witness&quot;. However, in addition to innocuous farm reports, the documents on the other pumpkin patch microfilms also included &quot;confidential memos sent from overseas embassies to diplomatic staff in Washington, D.C.&quot; Worse, those memos had originally been transmitted in code, which, thanks to their presumable possession of both coded originals and the translations (claimed by Chambers, to be forwarded by Hiss), the Soviets now could easily understand.

In taped recordings of President Nixon on July 1, 1971, he admitted that he had not checked the Pumpkin Papers prior to their use and he felt that the Justice Department was out to exonerate Hiss and a federal grand jury would indict Nixon&#x27;s ally Chambers for perjury. The FBI continued investigating Hiss&#x27;s innocence into 1953.

====Perjury====

Hiss was indicted for two counts of perjury relating to testimony he had given before a federal grand jury the previous December. He had denied giving any documents to Chambers and testified that he had not seen Chambers after mid-1936.

Hiss was tried twice for perjury. The first trial, in June 1949, ended with the jury deadlocked 8–4 for conviction. In addition to Chambers&#x27;s testimony, a government expert testified that other papers typed on a typewriter belonging to the Hiss family matched the secret papers produced by Chambers. An impressive array of character witnesses appeared on behalf of Hiss: two Supreme Court justices, Felix Frankfurter and Stanley Reed, the former Democratic presidential nominee John W. Davis, and the future Democratic presidential nominee Adlai Stevenson. Chambers, on the other hand, was attacked by Hiss&#x27;s attorneys as &quot;an enemy of the Republic, a blasphemer of Christ, a disbeliever in God, with no respect for matrimony or motherhood&quot;. In the second trial, Hiss&#x27;s defense produced a psychiatrist who characterized Chambers as a &quot;psychopathic personality&quot; and &quot;a pathological liar&quot;.

The second trial ended in January 1950 with Hiss being found guilty on both counts of perjury. He was sentenced to five years in prison.

Chambers had resigned from &quot;Time&quot; in December 1948. After the Hiss case, he wrote a few articles for &quot;Fortune&quot;, &quot;Life&quot;, and &quot;Look&quot; magazines.

In 1951, during the HUAC hearings, William Spiegel of Baltimore identified a photo of &quot;Carl Schroeder&quot; as Chambers while Spiegel was describing his involvement with David Zimmerman, a spy in Chambers&#x27;s network.

====&quot;Witness&quot;====
In 1952, Chambers&#x27;s book &quot;Witness&quot; was published to widespread acclaim. It was a combination of autobiography and a warning about the dangers of communism. Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. called it &quot;a powerful book&quot;. Ronald Reagan credited the book as the inspiration behind his conversion from a New Deal Democrat to a conservative Republican. &quot;Witness&quot; was a bestseller for more than a year and helped to pay off Chambers&#x27;s legal debts, but bills lingered (&quot;as Odysseus was beset by a ghost&quot;).

According to the commentator George Will in 2017:
&quot;Witness&quot; became a canonical text of conservatism. Unfortunately, it injected conservatism with a sour, whiney, complaining, crybaby populism. It is the screechy and dominant tone of the loutish faux conservatism that today is erasing [William F.] Buckley&#x27;s legacy of infectious cheerfulness and unapologetic embrace of high culture. Chambers wallowed in cloying sentimentality and curdled resentment about &quot;the plain men and women&quot;—&quot;my people, humble people, strong in common sense, in common goodness&quot;—enduring the &quot;musk of snobbism&quot; emanating from the &quot;socially formidable circles&quot; of the &quot;nicest people&quot; produced by &quot;certain collegiate eyries&quot;.
===&quot;National Review&quot;===
In 1955, William F. Buckley Jr. started the magazine &quot;National Review&quot;, and Chambers worked there as senior editor, publishing articles there for a little over a year and a half (October 1957 – June 1959). The most widely cited article to date is a scathing review, &quot;Big Sister is Watching You&quot;, of Ayn Rand&#x27;s &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;.

In 1959, Chambers resigned from &quot;National Review&quot;, although he continued correspondence with Buckley despite having suffered a series of heart attacks. In one letter, he noted, &quot;I am a man of the Right because I mean to uphold capitalism in its American version. But I claim that capitalism is not, and by its essential nature cannot conceivably be, conservative.&quot;

In that same year, Chambers and his wife embarked on a visit to Europe, the highlight of which was a meeting with Arthur Koestler and Margarete Buber-Neumann at Koestler&#x27;s home in Austria. That fall, he recommenced studies at Western Maryland College (now McDaniel College) in Westminster, Maryland.

==Personal life and death==
In 1930 or 1931, Chambers married the artist Esther Shemitz (1900–1986). Shemitz, who had studied at the Art Students League and integrated herself into New York City&#x27;s intellectual circles, met Chambers at the 1926 textile strike at Passaic, New Jersey. They then underwent a courtship that faced resistance from her mentor comrade Grace Hutchins. In the 1920s, she worked for &quot;The World Tomorrow&quot;, a pacifist magazine.

The couple had two children, Ellen and John, during the 1930s. While some Communist leadership expected professional revolutionists to go childless, the couple refused, a choice Chambers cited as part of his gradual disillusionment with communism. His daughter Ellen died in 2017.

In 1978, Allen Weinstein&#x27;s &quot;Perjury&quot; revealed that the FBI has a copy of a letter in which Chambers described homosexual liaisons during the 1930s. The letter copy states that Chambers gave up the practices in 1938 when he left the underground, which he attributed to his newfound Christianity. The letter has remained controversial from many perspectives.

Chambers&#x27;s conversion to Christianity was expressed by his baptism and confirmation in the Episcopal Church, but more permanently in his and his family&#x27;s request for membership in the Pipe Creek Friends Meetinghouse of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) near their farm in Maryland on August 17, 1943. They remained a part of this meeting until long after his death. In 1952 Chambers wrote a memoir, &quot;Witness&quot;, that was serialized in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;. Historian H. Larry Ingle argues that &quot;Witness&quot; is a &quot;twentieth-century addition to the classic Quaker journals&quot;, and that &quot;it is impossible to understand him without taking his religious convictions into consideration&quot;.

Chambers died of a heart attack on July 9, 1961, at his farm in Westminster, Maryland. He had had angina since the age of 38 and had had several heart attacks previously.

==Legacy==
In 2011, author Elena Maria Vidal interviewed David Chambers about his grandfather&#x27;s legacy. Versions of the interview were published in the &quot;National Observer&quot; and &quot;The American Conservative&quot;.

===Presidential Medal of Freedom (1984)===

In 1984, President Ronald Reagan posthumously awarded Chambers the Presidential Medal of Freedom, for his contribution to &quot;the century&#x27;s epic struggle between freedom and totalitarianism&quot;. In 1988, Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel granted national landmark status to the Pipe Creek Farm. In 2001, members of the George W. Bush administration held a private ceremony to commemorate the hundredth anniversary of Chambers&#x27;s birth. Speakers included William F. Buckley, Jr.

===Shortlived &quot;Whittaker Chambers Award&quot; (2017–2019)===
In January 2017, the National Review Institute (NRI) inaugurated a &quot;Whittaker Chambers Award&quot; for its 2017 Ideas Summit.

Recipients:
* Daniel Hannan: On March 16, 2017, the first recipient was Daniel Hannan MEP, dubbed &quot;the man who brought you Brexit&quot; by &quot;The Guardian&quot;. 
* Mark Janus: In February 2019, NRI announced its second biennial winner of the award, Mark Janus. Supporters say Janus champions free speech; detractors say he seeks to erode public unions by enabling free rides.

In March 2019, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported strong opposition from the family of Whittaker Chambers. It quoted from a family statement: &quot;All of us agree: the efforts of the two awardees run counter to the instincts and experience of Whittaker Chambers. All of us agree: their efforts have not matched his.&quot; Chambers&#x27;s son said that the two awardees &quot;are way, way off the target of the man whose name goes along with the award&quot;. One grandchild said, &quot;I almost thought, well, &#x27;Gosh, did the &quot;National Review&quot; guys read his book?&#x27;&quot; Regarding the award to Daniel Hannan, another grandchild said, &quot;My grandfather would have been horrified&quot; by a Brexiteer who sought to divide the West (the European Union), as if it were a favor to the &quot;very Stalin-like&quot; Vladimir Putin. Regarding the anti-union Mark Janus, the family noted that Chambers&#x27;s wife, Esther Shemitz, had been a member of the International Ladies&#x27; Garment Workers&#x27; Union and that other family members were active in unions, including Chambers himself in the Newspaper Guild.

In response, &quot;National Review&quot; conceded, &quot;We don&#x27;t own the Chambers name&quot;. While it refused the family&#x27;s request to withdraw the two awards, it did agree to discontinue it. It also agreed to publish the Chambers family&#x27;s statement on its website the weekend after the award. After &quot;National Review&quot; did not publish on time as promised, the family published themselves (&quot;Withdraw Whittaker&quot;). Christopher Buckley, author and son of William F. Buckley Jr., supported the Chambers family with a similar story about the William F. Buckley Jr. Award for Media Excellence: when Media Research Center awarded Sean Hannity, Buckley objected, the center rescinded the award, and stopped making the award altogether.

===Proposed Whittaker Chambers monument (2020)===
In September 2020, two senators from Carroll County to the Maryland General Assembly, Justin Ready and Michael Hough, announced their intention, reported in the &quot;Carroll County Times&quot; to recommend a &quot;Whittaker Chambers Memorial&quot; for a &quot;National Garden of American Heroes, following an executive order by Donald J. Trump to create an Interagency Task Force for Building and Rebuilding Monuments to American Heroes to establish that garden. Two members of the Whittaker Chambers family also wrote the &quot;Carroll County Times&quot; to oppose the senators&#x27; intention: 

==Works==
In 1928, Chambers translated &quot;Bambi, a Life in the Woods&quot;, by Felix Salten, into English.

Chambers&#x27;s book &quot;Witness&quot; is on the reading lists of The Heritage Foundation, The Leadership Institute, and the Russell Kirk Center for Cultural Renewal. He is regularly cited by conservative writers such as Heritage&#x27;s president Edwin Feulner and George H. Nash.

&quot;Cold Friday&quot;, Chambers&#x27;s second memoir, was published posthumously in 1964 with the help of Duncan Norton-Taylor, &amp; widow, Esther Shemitz Chambers. The book predicted that the fall of communism would start in the satellite states surrounding the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe. A collection of his correspondence with William F. Buckley, Jr., &quot;Odyssey of a Friend&quot;, was published in 1968; a collection of his journalism—including several of his &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;National Review&quot; writings, was published in 1989 as &quot;Ghosts on the Roof: Selected Journalism of Whittaker Chambers&quot;.

<text>A Philosophical Investigation is a 1992 techno-thriller by Philip Kerr.

==Plot summary==
In a near-future, a British neuroscientist named Professor Burgess Phelan has discovered a portion of the brain, the VMN, that is typically twice the size in men as it is in women. In certain men, however (approximately 1 in 100,000), it is the same size as a woman&#x27;s, and that abnormality is an exceptionally accurate indicator of violent sociopathy. Professor Phelan developed an imaging device called L.O.M.B.R.O.S.O. (Localisation of Modullar Brain Resonations Obliging Social Orthopraxy) used to help diagnose men with the VMN deficiency.

In the interests of public safety, the Lombroso institute is set up to test all the men in Britain. Males are enticed with ad campaigns to submit for testing; those who are VMN-negative are given confidential treatment, including counselling and drugs, and assigned a code name out of the Penguin book of Great Thinkers (&quot;e.g.&quot;, Shakespeare, Plato, etc.). The police aren&#x27;t given the names of the VMN-negative, but they are allowed to confirm whether or not a particular person is in the Lombroso Institutes system as VMN-negative.

&quot;Wittgenstein&quot; is the code name of a VMN-negative who, until he was made aware of his status, was living a well-adjusted, if solitary, life, venting his sociopathic tendencies harmlessly through virtual reality entertainment systems. Upon discovering his pathology, though, he undertakes a public service of his own: after hacking into the Lombroso Institute&#x27;s systems and obtaining a list of all VMN-negative men in Britain, he undertakes to kill them all.

The narrative unfolds from a dual perspective: Wittgenstein&#x27;s, and the female police lieutenant, Isadora &quot;Jake&quot; Jakowicz, assigned to catch him. Wittgenstein&#x27;s portion is told from the first person as a diary of his assassinations and subsequent downfall; the detective&#x27;s portion is told in a more traditional third-person perspective.

==Themes==
In the novel&#x27;s setting, the national government was elected partly on a platform of &quot;retributive justice&quot;, rather than rehabilitative, and &quot;punitive coma&quot; has replaced the death penalty (and, to a lesser extent, incarceration) as punishment for extreme crimes. In its favour, punitive coma is safely reversed, should someone later prove innocent; as well, prison costs have plunged since the inmates are sentenced to years of sleep rather than restraint, and require much less guarding and care. Opponents of punitive coma (of whom Jake is one) argue that the state is now stealing years from people&#x27;s lives, and giving the guilty no opportunity to rehabilitate themselves; thus, punitive coma is inhumane. This position is defeated, however, by proponents who observe that any long-term space travel will necessarily involve long-term medically induced comas of the same kind, so the process itself is not inhumane; furthermore, criminals are not subject to the dangerous criminal environment of prison, so punitive coma may be considered a more, rather than less, humane punishment.

A portion of the narrative involves the use of a Cambridge philosophy professor to engage Wittgenstein in a debate on the morality of his actions. Since the killer comes to see his whole act through the lens of the real Wittgenstein&#x27;s philosophy (including his mid-career reversal following Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus), it&#x27;s hoped that he will be amenable to philosophical persuasion. However, as Wittgenstein&#x27;s killings continue, the government presses the Cambridge don to talk Wittgenstein into committing suicide, a position with which the philosopher agrees, much to Jake&#x27;s dismay.

<doc id="180149" wikidata="Q186506" url="?curid=180149" title="Mezzo-soprano">
<text>A mezzo-soprano (, ), or mezzo ( ), is a type of classical female singing voice whose vocal range lies between the soprano and the contralto voice types. The mezzo-soprano&#x27;s vocal range usually extends from the A below middle C to the A two octaves above (i.e. A3–A5 in scientific pitch notation, where middle C = C4; 220–880 Hz). In the lower and upper extremes, some mezzo-sopranos may extend down to the F below middle C (F3, 175 Hz) and as high as &quot;high C&quot; (C6, 1047 Hz).
The mezzo-soprano voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, lyric, and dramatic.

== History ==
While mezzo-sopranos typically sing secondary roles in operas, notable exceptions include the title role in Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot;, Angelina (Cinderella) in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;La Cenerentola&quot;, and Rosina in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Barber of Seville&quot; (all of which are also sung by sopranos and contraltos). Many 19th-century French-language operas give the leading female role to mezzos, including &quot;Béatrice et Bénédict&quot;, &quot;La damnation de Faust&quot;, &quot;Don Quichotte&quot;, &quot;La favorite&quot;, &quot;Dom Sébastien&quot;, &quot;Charles VI&quot;, &quot;Mignon&quot;, &quot;Samson et Dalila&quot;, &quot;Les Troyens&quot;, and &quot;Werther&quot;, as well as &quot;Carmen&quot;.

Typical roles for mezzo-sopranos include the stereotypical triad associated with contraltos of &quot;witches, bitches, and britches&quot;: witches, nurses, and wise women, such as Azucena in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Il trovatore&quot;; villains and seductresses such as Amneris in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot;; and &quot;breeches roles&quot; or &quot;trouser roles&quot; (male characters played by female singers) such as Cherubino in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot;. Mezzo-sopranos are well represented in baroque music, early music, and baroque opera. Some roles designated for lighter soubrette sopranos are sung by mezzo-sopranos, who often provide a fuller, more dramatic quality. Such roles include Despina in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; and Zerlina in his &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;. Mezzos sometimes play dramatic soprano roles such as Santuzza in Mascagni&#x27;s &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot;, Lady Macbeth in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;, and Kundry in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Parsifal&quot;.

== Vocal range ==
The vocal range of the mezzo-sopranos lies between the soprano and the contralto voice types. Mezzo-sopranos generally have a heavier, darker tone than sopranos. The mezzo-soprano voice resonates in a higher range than that of a contralto. The terms &quot;Dugazon&quot; and &quot;Galli-Marié&quot; are sometimes used to refer to light mezzo-sopranos, after the names of famous singers. Usually men singing within the female range are called countertenors since there is a lighter more breathy tonal (falsetto) quality difference. In current operatic practice, female singers with very low tessituras are often included among mezzo-sopranos, because singers in both ranges are able to cover the other, and true operatic contraltos are very rare.

==Subtypes and roles in opera==
Within the mezzo-soprano voice type category are three generally recognized subcategories: coloratura mezzo-soprano, lyric mezzo-soprano, and dramatic mezzo-soprano.

=== Coloratura ===
A coloratura mezzo-soprano has a warm lower register and an agile high register. The roles they sing often demand not only the use of the lower register but also leaps into the upper tessitura with highly ornamented, rapid passages. They have a range from approximately the G below middle C (G3, 196 Hz) to the B two octaves above middle C (B5, 988 Hz). Some coloratura mezzo-sopranos can sing up to high C (C6, 1047 Hz) or high D (D6, 1175 Hz), but this is very rare.
What distinguishes these voices from being called sopranos is their extension into the lower register and warmer vocal quality. Although coloratura mezzo-sopranos have impressive and at times thrilling high notes, they are most comfortable singing in the middle of their range, rather than the top.

Many of the hero roles in the operas of Handel and Monteverdi, originally sung by male castrati, can be successfully sung today by coloratura mezzo-sopranos. Rossini demanded similar qualities for his comic heroines, and Vivaldi wrote roles frequently for this voice as well. Coloratura mezzo-sopranos also often sing lyric-mezzo-soprano roles or soubrette roles.

=== Lyric ===
The lyric mezzo-soprano has a range from approximately the G note below middle C (G3, 196 Hz) to the A two octaves above middle C (A5, 880 Hz). This voice has a very smooth, sensitive and at times lachrymose quality. Lyric mezzo-sopranos do not have the vocal agility of the coloratura mezzo-soprano or the size of the dramatic mezzo-soprano. The lyric mezzo-soprano is ideal for most trouser roles.

=== Dramatic ===
A dramatic mezzo-soprano has a strong medium register, a warm high register and a voice that is broader and more powerful than the lyric and coloratura mezzo-sopranos. This voice has less vocal facility than the coloratura mezzo-soprano. The range of the dramatic mezzo-soprano is from approximately the F below middle C (F3, 175 Hz) to the G two octaves above middle C (G5, 784 Hz). The dramatic mezzo-soprano can sing over an orchestra and chorus with ease and was often used in the 19th century opera, to portray older women, mothers, witches and evil characters. Verdi wrote many roles for this voice in the Italian repertoire and there are also a few good roles in the French Literature. The majority of these roles, however, are within the German Romantic repertoire of composers like Wagner and Richard Strauss. Like coloratura mezzos, dramatic mezzos are also often cast in lyric mezzo-soprano roles.

Dramatic mezzo-soprano roles in operas (*&quot;denotes a lead role&quot;):
=== Gilbert and Sullivan and operetta ===
All of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s Savoy operas have at least one mezzo-soprano character. Notable operetta roles are:
* The Lady Angela, &quot;Patience&quot; (Gilbert and Sullivan)
* Cousin Hebe, &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; (Gilbert and Sullivan)
* Edith, &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; (Gilbert and Sullivan)
* Iolanthe, &quot;Iolanthe&quot; (Gilbert and Sullivan)
* Mad Margaret, &quot;Ruddigore&quot; (Gilbert and Sullivan)
* Melissa, &quot;Princess Ida&quot; (Gilbert and Sullivan)

<doc id="180150" wikidata="Q816759" url="?curid=180150" title="Beta blocker">
<text>Beta blockers, also spelled β-blockers, are a class of medications that are predominantly used to manage abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmia), and to protect the heart from a second heart attack after a first heart attack (secondary prevention). They are also widely used to treat high blood pressure, although they are no longer the first choice for initial treatment of most people.

Beta blockers are competitive antagonists that block the receptor sites for the endogenous catecholamines epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) on adrenergic beta receptors, of the sympathetic nervous system, which mediates the fight-or-flight response. 

Beta-adrenergic receptors are found on cells of the heart muscles, smooth muscles, airways, arteries, kidneys, and other tissues that are part of the sympathetic nervous system and lead to stress responses, especially when they are stimulated by epinephrine (adrenaline). Beta blockers interfere with the binding to the receptor of epinephrine and other stress hormones and thereby weaken the effects of stress hormones.

Some beta blockers block activation of all types of β-adrenergic receptors and others are selective for one of the three known types of beta receptors, designated β1, β2 and β3 receptors. β1-adrenergic receptors are located mainly in the heart and in the kidneys. β2-adrenergic receptors are located mainly in the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, liver, uterus, vascular smooth muscle, and skeletal muscle. β3-adrenergic receptors are located in fat cells.

In 1964, James Black synthesized the first clinically significant beta blockers—propranolol and pronethalol; it revolutionized the medical management of angina pectoris and is considered by many to be one of the most important contributions to clinical medicine and pharmacology of the 20th century.

For the treatment of primary hypertension (high blood pressure), meta-analyses of studies which mostly used atenolol have shown that although beta blockers are more effective than placebo in preventing stroke and total cardiovascular events, they are not as effective as diuretics, medications inhibiting the renin–angiotensin system (e.g., ACE inhibitors), or calcium channel blockers.

== Medical uses ==

Beta blockers are utilized in the treatment of various conditions related to the heart and vascular system, as well as several other medical conditions. Common heart-related conditions for which beta blockers are well-established include angina pectoris, acute coronary syndromes, hypertension, and arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation and heart failure. They are also used in the management of other heart diseases, such as hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, mitral valve stenosis or prolapse, and dissecting aneurysm. Additionally, beta blockers find applications in vascular surgery, the treatment of anxiety states, cases of thyrotoxicosis, glaucoma, migraines, and esophageal varices.

=== Congestive heart failure ===
Although beta blockers were once contraindicated in congestive heart failure, as they have the potential to worsen the condition due to their effect of decreasing cardiac contractility, studies in the late 1990s showed their efficacy at reducing morbidity and mortality. Bisoprolol, carvedilol, and sustained-release metoprolol are specifically indicated as adjuncts to standard ACE inhibitor and diuretic therapy in congestive heart failure, although at doses typically much lower than those indicated for other conditions. Beta blockers are only indicated in cases of compensated, stable congestive heart failure; in cases of acute decompensated heart failure, beta blockers will cause a further decrease in ejection fraction, worsening the patient&#x27;s current symptoms.

Beta blockers are known primarily for their reductive effect on heart rate, although this is not the only mechanism of action of importance in congestive heart failure. Beta blockers, in addition to their sympatholytic β1 activity in the heart, influence the renin–angiotensin system at the kidneys. Beta blockers cause a decrease in renin secretion, which in turn reduces the heart oxygen demand by lowering the extracellular volume and increasing the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Heart failure characteristically involves increased catecholamine activity on the heart, which is responsible for several deleterious effects, including increased oxygen demand, propagation of inflammatory mediators, and abnormal cardiac tissue remodeling, all of which decrease the efficiency of cardiac contraction and contribute to the low ejection fraction. Beta blockers counter this inappropriately high sympathetic activity, eventually leading to an improved ejection fraction, despite an initial reduction in ejection fraction.

Trials have shown beta blockers reduce the absolute risk of death by 4.5% over a 13-month period. In addition to reducing the risk of mortality, the numbers of hospital visits and hospitalizations were also reduced in the trials. A 2020 Cochrane review found minimal evidence to support the use of beta blockers in congestive heart failure in children, however did identify that from the data available, that they may be of benefit.

Therapeutic administration of beta blockers for congestive heart failure ought to begin at very low doses ( of target) with a gradual escalation of the dose. The heart of the patient must adjust to decreasing stimulation by catecholamines and find a new equilibrium at a lower adrenergic drive.

==== Acute myocardial infarction ====

Beta blockers are indicated for the treatment of acute myocardial infarctions. During a myocardial infarction, systemic stress causes an increase in circulating catecholamines. This results an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, therefore increasing myocardial oxygen demand. Beta blockers competitively inhibit catecholamines acting on the β1-adrenergic receptors, thus reducing these detrimental effects and resulting in reduced myocardial oxygen consumption and demand.

A 2019 Cochrane review compared beta blockers with placebo or no intervention, it found that beta blockers probably reduced the short-term risk of reinfarction and the long-term risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality. The review identified that beta blockers likely had little to no impact on short-term all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality.

=== Hypertension ===
Beta blockers are widely used for the treatment of hypertension.

A 2014 Cochrane review found that in individuals with mild-to-moderate hypertension, non-selective beta blockers led to a reduction of -10/-7mmHg (systolic/diastolic) without increased rates of adverse events. At higher doses, it was found to increase the rate of adverse effects such as a reduction in heart rate, without a corresponding reduction in blood pressure.

A 2017 Cochrane review on the use of beta blockers in hypertension found a modest reduction in cardiovascular disease but little to no change in mortality It suggested that the effects of beta blockers are inferior to other anti-hypertensive medications.

=== Anxiety ===
Officially, beta blockers are not approved for anxiolytic use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. However, many controlled trials in the past 25 years indicate beta blockers are effective in anxiety disorders, though the mechanism of action is not known. The physiological symptoms of the fight-or-flight response (pounding heart, cold/clammy hands, increased respiration, sweating, etc.) are significantly reduced, thus enabling anxious individuals to concentrate on the task at hand.

Musicians, public speakers, actors, and professional dancers have been known to use beta blockers to avoid performance anxiety, stage fright, and tremor during both auditions and public performances. The application to stage fright was first recognized in &quot;The Lancet&quot; in 1976, and by 1987, a survey conducted by the International Conference of Symphony Orchestra Musicians, representing the 51 largest orchestras in the United States, revealed 27% of its musicians had used beta blockers and 70% obtained them from friends, not physicians. Beta blockers are inexpensive, said to be relatively safe, and on one hand, seem to improve musicians&#x27; performances on a technical level, while some, such as Barry Green, the author of &quot;The Inner Game of Music&quot; and Don Greene, a former Olympic diving coach who teaches Juilliard students to overcome their stage fright naturally, say the performances may be perceived as &quot;soulless and inauthentic&quot;.

=== Surgery ===
Low certainty evidence indicates that the use of beta blockers around the time of cardiac surgery may decrease the risk of heart dysrhythmias and atrial fibrillation. Starting them around the time of other types of surgery, however, may worsen outcomes. For non-cardiac surgery, the use of beta blockers to prevent adverse effects may reduce the risk of atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarctions (very low certainty evidence), however, there is moderate certainty evidence that this approach may increase the risk of hypotension. Low-certainty evidence suggests that beta blockers used perioperatively in non-cardiac surgeries may increase the risk of bradycardia.

=== Other ===
A 2014 Cochrane review investigated the use of beta blockers in the maintenance of chronic type B thoracic aortic aneurysm in comparison to other anti hypertensive medications. The review found no suitable evidence to support the current guidelines recommending its use.

A 2017 Cochrane review on the use of beta blockers to prevent aortic dissections in people with Marfan syndrome was unable to draw definitive conclusions due to lack of evidence.

Adrenergic antagonists are mostly used for cardiovascular disease. The adrenergic antagonists are widely used for lowering blood pressure and relieving hypertension. These antagonists have a been proven to relieve the pain caused by myocardial infarction, and also the infarction size, which correlates with heart rate.

There are few non-cardiovascular uses for adrenergic antagonists. Alpha-adrenergic antagonists are also used for treatment of ureteric stones, pain and panic disorders, withdrawal, and anesthesia.

Beta blockers are used to treat acute cardiovascular toxicity (e.g. in overdose) caused by sympathomimetics, for instance caused by amphetamine, methamphetamine, cocaine, ephedrine, and other drugs. Combined α1 and beta blockers like labetalol and carvedilol may be more favorable for such purposes due to the possibility of &quot;unopposed α-stimulation&quot; with selective beta blockers.

== Performance-enhancing use ==
Because they promote lower heart rates and reduce tremors, beta blockers have been used in professional sports where high accuracy is required, including archery, shooting, golf and snooker. Beta blockers are banned in some sports by the International Olympic Committee. In the 2008 Summer Olympics, 50-metre pistol silver medalist and 10-metre air pistol bronze medalist Kim Jong-su tested positive for propranolol and was stripped of his medals.

For similar reasons, beta blockers have also been used by surgeons.Classical musicians have commonly used beta blockers since the 1970s to reduce stage fright.

== Adverse effects ==
Adverse drug reactions associated with the use of beta blockers include: nausea, diarrhea, bronchospasm, dyspnea, cold extremities, exacerbation of Raynaud&#x27;s syndrome, bradycardia, hypotension, heart failure, heart block, fatigue, dizziness, alopecia (hair loss), abnormal vision, hallucinations, insomnia, nightmares, sexual dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, alteration of glucose and lipid metabolism. Mixed α1/β-antagonist therapy is also commonly associated with orthostatic hypotension.
Carvedilol therapy is commonly associated with edema.
Due to the high penetration across the blood–brain barrier, lipophilic beta blockers, such as propranolol and metoprolol, are more likely than other less lipophilic beta blockers to cause sleep disturbances, such as insomnia, vivid dreams and nightmares.

Adverse effects associated with β2-adrenergic receptor antagonist activity (bronchospasm, peripheral vasoconstriction, alteration of glucose and lipid metabolism) are less common with β1-selective (often termed &quot;cardioselective&quot;) agents, but receptor selectivity diminishes at higher doses. Beta blockade, especially of the beta-1 receptor at the macula densa, inhibits renin release, thus decreasing the release of aldosterone. This causes hyponatremia and hyperkalemia.

Hypoglycemia can occur with beta blockade because β2-adrenoceptors normally stimulate glycogen breakdown (glycogenolysis) in the liver and pancreatic release of the hormone glucagon, which work together to increase plasma glucose. Therefore, blocking β2-adrenoceptors lowers plasma glucose. β1-blockers have fewer metabolic side effects in diabetic patients; however, the fast heart rate that serves as a warning sign for insulin-induced low blood sugar may be masked, resulting in hypoglycemia unawareness. This is termed beta blocker-induced hypoglycemia unawareness. Therefore, beta blockers are to be used cautiously in diabetics.

A 2007 study revealed diuretics and beta blockers used for hypertension increase a patient&#x27;s risk of developing diabetes mellitus, while ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists (angiotensin receptor blockers) actually decrease the risk of diabetes. Clinical guidelines in Great Britain, but not in the United States, call for avoiding diuretics and beta blockers as first-line treatment of hypertension due to the risk of diabetes.

Beta blockers must not be used in the treatment of selective alpha-adrenergic agonist overdose. The blockade of only beta receptors increases blood pressure, reduces coronary blood flow, left ventricular function, and cardiac output and tissue perfusion by means of leaving the alpha-adrenergic system stimulation unopposed. Beta blockers with lipophilic properties and CNS penetration such as metoprolol and labetalol may be useful for treating CNS and cardiovascular toxicity from a methamphetamine overdose. The mixed alpha- and beta blocker labetalol is especially useful for treatment of concomitant tachycardia and hypertension induced by methamphetamine. The phenomenon of &quot;unopposed alpha stimulation&quot; has not been reported with the use of beta blockers for treatment of methamphetamine toxicity. Other appropriate antihypertensive drugs to administer during hypertensive crisis resulting from stimulant overdose are vasodilators such as nitroglycerin, diuretics such as furosemide, and alpha blockers such as phentolamine.

=== Contraindications and cautions ===

Absolute contraindications:
* Bradycardia
* Hypotension
* Hypersensitivity to beta blockers
* Cardiogenic shock
* Second or third degree AV block

Relative contraindications, or contraindications specific to certain beta-blockers:
* Long QT syndrome: sotalol is contraindicated
* History of torsades de pointes: sotalol is contraindicated

Cautions:
* Abrupt discontinuations
* Acute bronchospasm
* Acute heart failure
* Asthma: see below
* Bronchitis
* Cerebrovascular disease
* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
* Emphysema
* Kidney failure
* Hepatic disease
* Myopathy
* Pheochromocytoma
* Psoriasis
* Raynaud phenomenon
* Stroke
* Vasospastic angina
* Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome

==== Asthma ====
The 2007 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) asthma guidelines recommend against the use of non-selective beta blockers in asthmatics, while allowing for the use of cardio selective beta blockers.

Cardio selective beta blocker (β1 blockers) can be prescribed at the least possible dose to those with mild to moderate respiratory symptoms. β2-agonists can somewhat mitigate β-blocker-induced bronchospasm where it exerts greater efficacy on reversing &quot;selective&quot; β-blocker-induced bronchospasm than the &quot;nonselective&quot; β-blocker-induced worsening asthma and/or COPD.

==== Diabetes mellitus ====
Epinephrine signals early warning of the upcoming hypoglycemia.

Beta blockers&#x27; inhibition on epinephrine&#x27;s effect can somewhat exacerbate hypoglycemia by interfering with glycogenolysis and mask signs of hypoglycemia such as tachycardia, palpitations, diaphoresis, and tremors. Diligent blood glucose level monitoring is necessary for a patient with diabetes mellitus on beta blockers.

==== Hyperthyroidism ====
Abrupt withdrawal can result in a thyroid storm.

==== Bradycardia or AV block ====
Unless a pacemaker is present, beta blockers can severely depress conduction in the AV node, resulting in a reduction of heart rate and cardiac output. One should be very cautious with the use of beta blockers in tachycardia patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome, as it can result in life-threatening arrhythmia in certain patients. By slowing the conduction through the AV node, preferential conduction through the accessory pathway is favored. If the patient happens to develop atrial flutter, this could lead to a 1:1 conduction with very fast ventricular rate, or worse, ventricular fibrillation in the case of atrial fibrillation.

=== Toxicity ===
Glucagon, used in the treatment of overdose, increases the strength of heart contractions, increases intracellular cAMP, and decreases renal vascular resistance. It is, therefore, useful in patients with beta blocker cardiotoxicity. Cardiac pacing is usually reserved for patients unresponsive to pharmacological therapy.

People experiencing bronchospasm due to the β2 receptor-blocking effects of nonselective beta blockers may be treated with anticholinergic drugs, such as ipratropium, which are safer than beta agonists in patients with cardiovascular disease. Other antidotes for beta blocker poisoning are salbutamol and isoprenaline.

== Pharmacology ==

=== Intrinsic sympathomimetic activity ===
Also referred to as intrinsic sympathomimetic effect, this term is used particularly with beta blockers that can show both agonism and antagonism at a given beta receptor, depending on the concentration of the agent (beta blocker) and the concentration of the antagonized agent (usually an endogenous compound, such as norepinephrine). See partial agonist for a more general description.

Some beta blockers (e.g. oxprenolol, pindolol, penbutolol, labetalol and acebutolol) exhibit intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). These agents are capable of exerting low-level agonist activity at the β-adrenergic receptor while simultaneously acting as a receptor site antagonist. These agents, therefore, may be useful in individuals exhibiting excessive bradycardia with sustained beta blocker therapy.

Agents with ISA should not be used for patients with any kind of angina as it can aggravate or after myocardial infarctions. They may also be less effective than other beta blockers in the management of angina and tachyarrhythmia.

=== β-Adrenergic receptor antagonism ===

Stimulation of β1 receptors by epinephrine and norepinephrine induces a positive chronotropic and inotropic effect on the heart and increases cardiac conduction velocity and automaticity. Stimulation of β1 receptors on the kidney causes renin release. Stimulation of β2 receptors induces smooth muscle relaxation, induces tremor in skeletal muscle, and increases glycogenolysis in the liver and skeletal muscle. Stimulation of β3 receptors induces lipolysis.

Beta blockers inhibit these normal epinephrine- and norepinephrine-mediated sympathetic actions, but have minimal effect on resting subjects.
That is, they reduce the effect of excitement or physical exertion on heart rate and force of contraction, and also tremor, and breakdown of glycogen. Beta blockers can have a constricting effect on the bronchi of the lungs, possibly worsening or causing asthma symptoms.

Since β2 adrenergic receptors can cause vascular smooth muscle dilation, beta blockers may cause some vasoconstriction. However, this effect tends to be small because the activity of β2 receptors is overshadowed by the more dominant vasoconstricting α1 receptors. By far the greatest effect of beta blockers remains in the heart. Newer, third-generation beta blockers can cause vasodilation through blockade of alpha-adrenergic receptors.

Accordingly, nonselective beta blockers are expected to have antihypertensive effects. The primary antihypertensive mechanism of beta blockers is unclear, but may involve reduction in cardiac output (due to negative chronotropic and inotropic effects). It may also be due to reduction in renin release from the kidneys, and a central nervous system effect to reduce sympathetic activity (for those beta blockers that do cross the blood–brain barrier, e.g. propranolol).

Antianginal effects result from negative chronotropic and inotropic effects, which decrease cardiac workload and oxygen demand. Negative chronotropic properties of beta blockers allow the lifesaving property of heart rate control. Beta blockers are readily titrated to optimal rate control in many pathologic states.

The antiarrhythmic effects of beta blockers arise from sympathetic nervous system blockade—resulting in depression of sinus node function and atrioventricular node conduction, and prolonged atrial refractory periods. Sotalol, in particular, has additional antiarrhythmic properties and prolongs action potential duration through potassium channel blockade.

Blockade of the sympathetic nervous system on renin release leads to reduced aldosterone via the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, with a resultant decrease in blood pressure due to decreased sodium and water retention.

=== α1-Adrenergic receptor antagonism ===
Some beta blockers (e.g., labetalol and carvedilol) exhibit mixed antagonism of both β- and α1-adrenergic receptors, which provides additional arteriolar vasodilating action.

=== Blood–brain barrier permeability ===
Beta blockers vary in their lipophilicity (fat solubility) and in turn in their ability to cross the blood–brain barrier and exert effects in the central nervous system. Beta blockers with greater blood–brain barrier permeability can have both neuropsychiatric therapeutic benefits and side effects, as well as adverse cognitive effects. Central nervous system-related side effects and risks of beta blockers may include fatigue, depression, sleep disorders (namely insomnia) and nightmares, visual hallucinations, delirium, psychosis, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and falling. Conversely, central nervous system-related benefits of beta blockers may include prevention and treatment of migraine, essential tremor, akathisia, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, aggression, and obsessive–compulsive disorder.

Most beta blockers are lipophilic and can cross into the brain, but there are a number of exceptions. Highly lipophilic beta blockers include penbutolol, pindolol, propranolol, and timolol, moderately lipophilic beta blockers include acebutolol, betaxolol, bisoprolol, carvedilol, metoprolol, and nebivolol, and low lipophilicity or hydrophilic beta blockers include atenolol, carteolol, esmolol, labetalol, nadolol, and sotalol. It is thought that highly lipophilic beta blockers are able to readily cross into the brain, moderately lipophilic beta blockers are able to cross to a lesser degree, and low lipophilicity or hydrophilic beta blockers are minimally able to cross. More lipophilic beta-blockers are known to suppress melatonin release by 50-80%. The preceding beta blockers also vary in their intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and β1-adrenergic receptor selectivity (or cardioselectivity), resulting in further differences in pharmacological profiles and suitability in different contexts between them.

== Agents ==
=== Nonselective agents ===
Nonselective beta blockers display both β1 and β2 antagonism.

=== β1-selective agents ===
β1-selective beta blockers are also known as cardioselective beta blockers. Pharmacologically, the beta-blockade of the β1 receptors in the heart will act on cAMP. The function of cAMP as a second messenger in the cardiac cell is that it phosphorylates the LTCC and the ryanodine receptor to increase intracellular calcium levels and cause contraction. Beta-blockade of the β1 receptor will inhibit cAMP from phosphorylating, and it will decrease the ionotrophic and chronotropic effect. Note that drugs may be cardioselective, or act on β1 receptors in the heart only, but still have intrinsic sympathomimetic activity.
* Acebutolol (has intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, ISA)
* Atenolol
* Betaxolol
* Bisoprolol
* Celiprolol (has intrinsic sympathomimetic activity)
* Metoprolol
* Nebivolol
* Esmolol
Nebivolol and bisoprolol are the most β1 cardioselective beta blockers.

=== β2-selective agents ===
* Butaxamine
* ICI-118,551

=== β3-selective agents ===
* SR 59230A

=== β1 selective antagonist and β3 agonist agents ===
* Nebivolol

== Comparative information ==

=== Pharmacological differences ===
* Agents with intrinsic sympathomimetic action (ISA)
** Acebutolol, pindolol, labetalol, mepindolol, oxprenolol, celiprolol, penbutolol
* Agents organized by lipid solubility (lipophilicity)
** High lipophilicity: propranolol, labetalol
** Intermediate lipophilicity: metoprolol, bisoprolol, carvedilol, acebutolol, timolol, pindolol
** Low lipophilicity (also known as hydrophilic beta blockers): atenolol, nadolol, and sotalol
* Agents with membrane stabilizing effect
** Carvedilol, propranolol &gt; oxprenolol &gt; labetalol, metoprolol, timolol

=== Indication differences ===
* Agents specifically labeled for cardiac arrhythmia
** Esmolol, sotalol, landiolol (Japan)
* Agents specifically labeled for congestive heart failure
** Bisoprolol, carvedilol, sustained-release metoprolol
* Agents specifically labeled for glaucoma
** Betaxolol, carteolol, levobunolol, timolol, metipranolol
* Agents specifically labeled for myocardial infarction
** Atenolol, metoprolol (immediate release), propranolol (immediate release), timolol, carvedilol (after left ventricular dysfunction), bisoprolol (preventive treatment before and primary treatment after heart attacks)
* Agents specifically labeled for migraine prophylaxis
** Timolol, propranolol

Propranolol is the only agent indicated for the control of tremor, portal hypertension, and esophageal variceal bleeding, and used in conjunction with α-blocker therapy in phaeochromocytoma.

== Other effects ==

Beta blockers, due to their antagonism at beta-1 adrenergic receptors, inhibit both the synthesis of new melatonin and its secretion by the pineal gland. The neuropsychiatric side effects of some beta blockers (e.g. sleep disruption, insomnia) may be due to this effect.

Some pre-clinical and clinical research suggests that some beta blockers may be beneficial for cancer treatment. However, other studies do not show a correlation between cancer survival and beta blocker usage. Also, a 2017 meta-analysis failed to show any benefit for the use of beta blockers in breast cancer.

Beta blockers have also been used for the treatment of schizoid personality disorder. However, there is limited evidence supporting the efficacy of supplemental beta blocker use in addition to antipsychotic drugs for treating schizophrenia.

Contrast agents are not contraindicated in those receiving beta blockers.

<text>&quot;Silent Snow, Secret Snow&quot; (1932) is Conrad Aiken&#x27;s best-known short story, often included in anthologies of classic American horror and fantasy short fiction. It was first published in the Autumn 1932 issue of the &quot;Virginia Quarterly Review&quot;. It later appeared in &quot;The Collected Stories of Conrad Aiken&quot; in 1934, and since then has been widely anthologized.

==Plot==
The story tells of a 12-year-old boy named Paul Hasleman, who finds it increasingly difficult to pay attention to his classwork while growing more distant from his family. He is, instead, becoming more and more entranced by daydreaming about snow. This began when he was lying in bed one morning, awaiting the approach of the postman. Unable to hear the expected footfalls, the boy imagines that they have been muffled by newly fallen snow, and is surprised when he looks out the window and discovers that there is no snow on the ground.

Paul&#x27;s increasing distance and indifference to the world around him alarms his parents. He has to struggle to get dressed and converse with others, because of the allure of his daydream about snow. His parents eventually call in a physician, who makes a house call to examine Paul. After revealing that he likes to think about snow, Paul tears himself away from the meeting with the physician and retreats to his room. When his mother pursues him, he tells her &quot;Go away ... I hate you!&quot;, and is lost in the dreamworld of the snow.

==Interpretations==
The story tells of a normal boy&#x27;s descent into a dream world of snow that he finds preferable to the dirty and mundane world. The story can also be thought of as a Symbolist rejection of reality. The progressive withdrawal from reality and social relationships, as well as preoccupation with idiosyncratically meaningful ideas could be interpreted as characteristic of schizophrenia.

==Adaptations==
In 1964 a 17-minute short film based on the story was produced by Gene Kearney.

It was dramatized as an episode of Rod Serling&#x27;s &quot;Night Gallery&quot;, also directed by Kearney, starring Radames Pera and narrated by Orson Welles. The original broadcast date was October 20, 1971.

The story was the inspiration for an instrumental song of the same name by guitarist Jim Matheos on his first solo album, &quot;First Impressions&quot;.

The story inspired the song &quot;Silent Snow&quot; by musician Scott Appel on his album &quot;Nine of Swords&quot;.

The story inspired the song &quot;KEROSENE&quot; by musician OF SAINT.

<doc id="180152" wikidata="Q5535197" url="?curid=180152" title="Geography of Missouri">
<text>Missouri, a state near the geographical center of the United States, has three distinct physiographic divisions:

* a north-western upland plain or prairie region part of the Interior Plains&#x27; Central Lowland (areas Osage Plain 12f and Dissected Till Plains 12e) known as the northern plains
* a lowland in the extreme southeast bootheel region of Missouri, part of the Atlantic Plain known as the Mississippi Alluvial Plain (areas 3e) or the Mississippi embayment
* the Missouri portion of the Ozark Plateau (areas 14a and 14b) which lies between the Mississippi Alluvial Plain and the Central lowland.
The boundary between the northern plains and the Ozark region follows the 
Missouri River from its mouth at St. Louis to Columbia. This also corresponds to the southernmost extent of glaciation during the Pre-Illinoian Stage which destroyed the remnant plateau to the north but left the ancient landforms to the south unaltered. The Ozark boundary runs southwestward from there towards Joplin at the southeast corner of Kansas. The boundary between the Ozark and lowland regions runs southwest from Cape Girardeau on the Mississippi River to the Arkansas border just southwest of Poplar Bluff. Missouri borders eight other US States, more than any other state except Tennessee, which also borders eight states.

==Regions==

=== Northern Plains ===
The Dissected Till Plains portion of the northern plains region lies in the portion of the state north of the Missouri River, while the Osage plains portion extends into the southwestern portion of the state bordering the Ozark Plateau. Thus the northern plains covers an area slightly more than a third of the state. This region is a beautiful, rolling country, with a great abundance of streams.

It is more hilly and broken in its western half than in its eastern half. The elevation in the extreme northwestern Missouri is about . and in the extreme northeastern portion about ., while the rim of the region to the southeast, along the border of the Ozark region, has an elevation of about . The valleys for the larger streams are about 250 to deep and sometimes 8 to wide with the country bordering them being the most broken of the region.

The smaller streams have so eroded the whole face of the country that little of the original surface plain is to be seen. The Mississippi River runs along the length of Missouri&#x27;s eastern side and is skirted throughout by topographic relief of 400 to . elevation.

=== Ozark Plateau ===
The Ozark region is essentially a low dome, with local faulting and minor undulations, dominated by a ridge or, more exactly, a relatively even belt of highland that runs from near the Mississippi river about Ste. Genevieve to McDonald County on the Arkansas border. High rocky bluffs rise precipitously on the Mississippi, sometimes to a height of or so above the water, from the mouth of the Meramec River to Ste. Genevieve. These mark where that river cuts the Ozark ridge. Across the Mississippi River, this ridge is continued by the Shawnee Hills in Illinois. 

The elevations of the crests in Missouri vary from 1,100 to . This second physiographic region comprises somewhat less than two-thirds of the area of the state. The Burlington escarpment of Mississippian rocks, which in places is as much as 250 to in height, runs along the western edge of the Ordovician formations and divides the region into an eastern and a western area, known respectively to physiographers as the Salem Plateau and the Springfield Plateau. Headward erosion by the south flowing tributaries to the White River in northern Arkansas has created a southern escarpment to both the Springfield and Salem plateaus that runs from McDonald through Barry, Stone, Christian, Douglas, and Howell counties. To the south of this escarpment lies some of the more rugged and highly dissected parts of the Missouri Ozarks. The famed Shepherd of the Hills region near Branson lies within this rugged area. To the east of the West Plains plain lies the dissected valleys of the Eleven Point River and the Current River.

Superficially, each is a simple rolling plateau, much broken by erosion (though considerable undissected areas drained by underground channels remain), especially in the east, and dotted with hills. Some of these are residual outliers of the eroded Mississippian limestones to the west, and others are the summits of a Precambrian topography above and around which sedimentary formations were deposited and then eroded. There is no arrangement in chains, but only scattered rounded peaks and short ridges, with winding valleys about them.

The two highest points in the state are Taum Sauk Mountain at in the St. Francois Mountains in Iron County and Lead Hill just east of the community of Cedar Gap at in the southwestern corner of Wright County. 
Few localities have an elevation exceeding . Rather broad, smooth valleys, well degraded hills with rounded summits, and despite the escarpments generally smooth contours and sky-lines, characterize the bulk of the Ozark region.

=== Mississippi Alluvial Plain ===
The third region, the lowlands of the south-east and part of the Mississippi Alluvial Plain, has an area of some . It is an undulating country, for the most part well drained, but swampy in its lowest portions. The Mississippi is skirted with lagoons, lakes and morasses from Ste. Genevieve to the Arkansas border, and in places is confined by levees. These lowlands are the northernmost extent of the Mississippi embayment. The area is within the New Madrid Seismic Zone and includes the epicenter location of the 1811–12 New Madrid earthquakes at New Madrid, Missouri.

==Climate==

Missouri generally has a humid continental climate with cool, sometimes cold, winters and hot, humid, and wet summers. In the southern part of the state, particularly in the Bootheel, the climate becomes humid subtropical. Located in the interior United States, Missouri often experiences extreme temperatures. Without high mountains or oceans nearby to moderate temperature, its climate is alternately influenced by air from the cold Arctic and the hot and humid Gulf of Mexico. Missouri&#x27;s highest recorded temperature is at Warsaw and Union on July 14, 1954, while the lowest recorded temperature is also at Warsaw on February 13, 1905.

Located in Tornado Alley, Missouri also receives extreme weather in the form of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. On May 22, 2011, a massive EF-5 tornado killed 158 people and destroyed roughly one-third of the city of Joplin. The tornado caused an estimated $1–3 billion in damages and injured more than a thousand people as it tore through the urban area. It was the first EF5 to hit the state since 1957 and the deadliest in the U.S. since 1947, making it the seventh deadliest tornado in American history and 27th deadliest in the world. St. Louis and its suburbs also have a history of experiencing particularly severe tornadoes, the most recent one of note being an EF4 that damaged Lambert-St. Louis International Airport on April 22, 2011. One of the worst tornadoes in American history struck St. Louis on May 27, 1896, killing at least 255 people and causing $10 million in damage (equivalent to $3.9 billion in 2009 or $ in today&#x27;s dollars).


== Drainage ==

The drainage of the state is wholly into the Mississippi River, directly or indirectly, and to a large extent into either that river or the Missouri River within the borders of the state. The latter stream, crossing the state and cutting the eastern and western borders at or near St Louis and Kansas City respectively, has a length within Missouri of . The areas drained into the Mississippi outside the state through the St. Francis, White and other minor streams are relatively small. The larger streams of the Ozark dome are of decided interest to the physiographer. Those of the White system have open trough valleys bordered by hills in their upper courses and canyons in their lower courses.

Both the Ozark region and the northern plain region are divided by minor escarpments into ten or twelve sub-regions. There are remarkable differences in the drainage areas of their two sides, with interesting illustrations of shifting water-partings; and the White, Gasconade, Osage and other rivers are remarkable for upland meanders, lying, not on flood-plains, but around the spurs of a highland country. These incised meanders have been interpreted to have formed by downward erosion after uplift of an older peneplain surface.

Many streams in Missouri are called &quot;rivers&quot; though they are small enough perhaps to be called &quot;creeks&quot;. This is due to a direct translation of the French word &quot;rivière&quot; which implies a stream size smaller than the French word &quot;fleuve&quot;, meaning &quot;a river that flows to the sea&quot;. An example of this is &quot;Loutre River&quot;, from &quot;Rivière Loutre&quot;, or &quot;Otter Stream&quot;.

== Caves ==
The Ozarks region has a well-developed karst topography with numerous areas of sinkholes, stream capture, and cavern development.

Caves, within areas of limestone and dolomite bedrock, occur in great numbers in and near the Ozark Mountain region in the southwestern part of Missouri. More than a hundred have been discovered in Stone County alone, and there are many in Christian, Greene and McDonald counties.

Marvel Cave is located a short distance southeast of the center of Stone county. The entrance originally was through a large sink-hole at the top of Roark Mountain, though now an easier entrance has been made. Marvel Cave has a large hall-like room about long and about wide with bluish-grey limestone walls, and a vaulted roof, rising from 100 to . Due to its acoustic properties the room has been named the &quot;Auditorium&quot;. At one end is a large stalagmite formation about in height and about in girth, called the &quot;White Throne&quot;.

Exploration of Jacobs Cavern, near Pineville, McDonald county, revealed human and animal skeletons along with crude implements. Crystal Cave, near Joplin, Jasper county, has its entire surface lined with calcite crystals and scalenohedron formations, from 1 to in length.

Other caves include Friede&#x27;s Cave, about six miles (10 km) northeast of Rolla, Phelps County and Mark Twain Cave (in Marion County, about one mile (1.6 km) south of Hannibal), which has a deep pool containing many eyeless fish.

<doc id="180153" wikidata="Q2476957" url="?curid=180153" title="ITV Granada">
<text>ITV Granada, formerly known as Granada Television, is the ITV franchisee for the North West of England and Isle of Man. From 1956 to 1968 it broadcast to both the north west and Yorkshire on weekdays only, as ABC Weekend Television was its weekend counterpart. Granada&#x27;s parent company Granada plc later bought several other regional ITV stations and, in 2004, merged with Carlton Communications to form ITV plc.

Granada Television was particularly noted by critics for the distinctive northern and &quot;social realism&quot; character of many of its network programmes, as well as the high quality of its drama and documentaries. In its prime as an independent franchisee, prior to its parent company merging with Carlton Communications to form ITV plc, it was the largest Independent Television producer in the UK, accounting for 25% of the total broadcasting output of the ITV network.

Granada Television was founded by Sidney Bernstein at Granada Studios on Quay Street in Manchester and is the only surviving franchisee of the original four Independent Television Authority franchisees from 1954. It covers Cheshire, Greater Manchester, Lancashire, Merseyside, and parts of Derbyshire, Staffordshire, Cumbria, and North Yorkshire. In 2009, the Isle of Man was transferred to Granada from ITV Border.

Broadcasting by Granada Television began on 3 May 1956 under the North of England weekday franchise, the fifth franchise to go to air. It was marked by a distinctive northern identity and used a stylised letter &quot;G&quot; logo forming an arrow pointing north, often with the tagline &quot;Granada: from the North&quot;. Granada plc merged with Carlton Communications to form ITV plc in 2004 after a duopoly had developed over the previous decade. The Granada name, as with those of the other former regional licence holders, is only referenced onscreen during regional news bulletins and the weeknight regional news magazine; ITV Broadcasting Limited operates the service with national ITV branding and continuity.

The North West region is regarded as ITV&#x27;s most successful franchise. Nine Granada programmes were listed in the BFI TV 100 in 2000. Some of its most notable programmes include &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, &quot;Seven Up!&quot;, &quot;The Royle Family&quot;, &quot;The Jewel in the Crown&quot;, &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot;, &quot;World in Action&quot;, &quot;University Challenge&quot;, &quot;Stars in Their Eyes&quot; and &quot;The Krypton Factor&quot;. Notable employees have included Paul Greengrass, Michael Apted, Mike Newell, Jeremy Isaacs, Andy Harries, Russell T Davies, Leslie Woodhead, Tony Wilson, Roland Joffe, Brian Cosgrove, Mark Hall, Brian Trueman, Michael Parkinson, Derek Granger and Gordon McDougall.

==History==
===Origins===

Granada originated as Granada Theatres Ltd, which owned cinemas in the south of England. It was founded in Dover in 1930 by Sidney Bernstein and his brother Cecil; it was named after the Spanish city of Granada, which Sidney had visited on a holiday. The company was incorporated as Granada Ltd in 1934 and listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1935; Granada Theatres Ltd became a subsidiary of the new company.

In the 1950s, the Bernsteins became involved in commercial television, a competitor to the cinema chains, through the launch of ITV. Bernstein bid for the North of England franchise, which he believed would not affect the company&#x27;s largely southern-based cinema chain. In 1954, the Independent Television Authority (ITA) awarded Granada the North of England contract for Monday to Friday, with ABC Weekend TV serving the same area on weekends. The companies used the ITA&#x27;s Winter Hill and Emley Moor transmitters, covering Lancashire and the West and East Ridings of Yorkshire, including the major conurbations around Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Bradford, Sheffield, York and Doncaster.

Bernstein selected a base from Leeds and Manchester. Granada executive Victor Peers believed Manchester was the preferred choice even before executives toured the region to find a suitable site. Granada Studios, designed by architect Ralph Tubbs, was built on a site on Quay Street in Manchester city centre belonging to Manchester City Council, which the company bought for £82,000.

The opening night featured &quot;Meet The People&quot; hosted by Quentin Reynolds and comedian Arthur Askey. Reynolds became inebriated before the broadcast and had to sober up.

Granada Television was broadcast by the ITA on VHF Channel 9 (405 lines, monochrome) from the Winter Hill transmitter starting on 3 May 1956, and from 3 November 1956 on VHF channel 10 (405 lines, monochrome) from the Emley Moor transmitter. The weekend programme service was provided by ABC Television covering both the North and Midlands regions. Following the 1968 franchise awards, Granada Television provided the programme service from Winter Hill for all seven days of the week but lost the seven-day service from Emley Moor to Yorkshire Television. With the national launch of the UHF 625 line colour television service for both BBC1 and ITV on 15 November 1969, the ITA commenced broadcasts of Granada Television on UHF channel 59 from Winter Hill, with high power relays subsequently put into service at Pendle Forest (channel 25 on 2 August 1971, the first UHF relay service to be operated by the ITA), Lancaster (channel 24 on 26 June 1972), Storeton (channel 25 in September 1979), and Saddleworth (channel 49 on 28 June 1984).

===Early years===
Most ITV franchisees viewed their territories as stopgaps before winning a coveted London franchise. In contrast, Granada determined to develop a strong northern identity – northern voices, northern programmes, northern idents with phrases such as &quot;Granada from the north&quot;, &quot;From the north — Granada&quot; and &quot;Granadaland&quot;. Bernstein refused to employ anyone not prepared to live in or travel to Manchester and Jeremy Isaacs called him a &quot;genial tyrant&quot; as a result.

Bernstein decided to build new studios rather than hiring space or converting old buildings, an approach favoured by the other ITV companies and by the BBC at its original Manchester studios. The investment in new studios in 1954 contributed to Granada struggling financially, and the company was close to insolvency by late 1956. All four ITA franchisees were expected to make losses in the first few years of operation, but Granada&#x27;s was a significant sum of £175,000 (nearly £3.5m in 2011). When it first became profitable, it had the lowest profits of the quartet.

Granada sought the help of Associated-Rediffusion, the London weekday station, which agreed to underwrite Granada&#x27;s debts in exchange for a percentage of its profits, without the consent of the ITA, who would have blocked it. Granada accepted the deal, but the popularity of ITV increased and profitability followed. Analysts questioned how Associated-Rediffusion, ABC and ATV were making annual profits of up to £2.7m by 1959 and yet Granada&#x27;s profits were under £1m. With the increase in income, Granada tried to renegotiate the contract; Associated-Rediffusion refused, souring relations for many years. The deal was worth over £8m to Rediffusion. By the early 1960s Granada was established and its soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot; quickly became popular, as did inexpensive game shows such as &quot;Criss Cross Quiz&quot; and &quot;University Challenge&quot;.

===Franchise changes===
In the 1968 franchise round, Granada&#x27;s contract was changed from weekdays across the northern England region to the whole week in the North West from Winter Hill transmitting station. Yorkshire was defined as a separate region and the contract awarded to Yorkshire Television, broadcasting from Emley Moor transmitting station; its transmissions could be received in parts of North Lincolnshire. Bernstein was angered by the decision to split &quot;Granadaland&quot;, and claimed he would appeal to the United Nations. Granada Television was received in what is now Greater Manchester, Lancashire, Merseyside and Cheshire, the south of what is now Cumbria (then Lancashire, and smaller parts of Westmorland and Yorkshire) around Barrow-in-Furness, the High Peak district of Derbyshire (Glossop, Buxton), the Staffordshire Moorlands district of Staffordshire (Biddulph and Leek) and the Isle of Man. Parts of North Wales can receive only the Winter Hill transmissions (i.e. Granada) rather than HTV.

Granada retained its franchise in the 1980 franchise review, and invested in multimillion-pound dramatic serial productions such as &quot;The Jewel in the Crown&quot; and &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot;. By the late 1990s the UK commercial broadcasters were considered too small to compete in the global market, and the ITV franchises began to consolidate with the aim of creating a single company with a larger budget.

The Broadcasting Act of 1990 instigated the 1991 franchise auction round, in which companies had to bid for the regions. Mersey Television, a company producing the Channel 4 soap opera &quot;Brookside&quot;, bid £35m compared to Granada&#x27;s £9m but Granada won as Mersey&#x27;s package did not meet the &#x27;quality threshold&#x27; applied by the Independent Television Commission. This requirement disadvantaged companies with no previous franchise experience. Granada owned popular television series such as &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, which it threatened to sell to satellite TV if the franchise was lost. The government responded by relaxing the regulatory regime, so that ITV contractors could take over other companies, and Granada bought several companies. Some at the company considered ITV could survive only as a single merged entity to have sufficient resources to produce big-budget programmes, a concern that increased when BSkyB began to take ITV&#x27;s viewing share, leading to less advertising revenue, the source of ITV&#x27;s income.

David Plowright, who had worked at Granada since 1957, resigned in 1992, citing the arrival of Gerry Robinson, who had tightened departmental budgets with an uncompromising business approach. Plowright had been the company&#x27;s driving force, producing programmes such as &quot;World in Action&quot; and &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, and promoting the Granada Studios Tour. His departure angered well-known media-industry figures; John Cleese sent Robinson a fax using &quot;vitriolic language&quot; that called him an &quot;upstart caterer&quot; (a reference to his past employment). John Birt, Harold Pinter and Alan Bennett all supported Plowright for his quality programming.

===Takeover bids===
The so-called &quot;Big Five&quot; ITV franchisees, Thames, LWT, Central, Granada, and Yorkshire were expected to take over the ten smaller franchises. Granada wanted to consolidate with Yorkshire and Tyne Tees to &quot;counter the potential dominance of the south east&quot;, and the prospect of being taken over by Thames. Granada made a hostile bid for LWT in December 1993, but LWT believed Granada had &quot;little to offer&quot; despite having three times the market capitalisation; Granada, however, completed the take-over in 1994. Granada continued to expand by acquiring Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television for £652m in 1997 and bought UNM&#x27;s television assets for £1.75 billion in 2000 – by which it acquired Anglia and Meridian and some divisions of HTV – the remaining divisions passing to rival company Carlton due to competition laws. A year later, it acquired Border from Capital Radio Group.

By 2002, Granada had established an effective duopoly of ITV with Carlton Television, owning all the ITV companies in England and Wales. The remaining franchises in Scotland, (Scottish and Grampian), UTV in Northern Ireland, and Channel in the Channel Islands, remained independent.

Granada was in a poor financial state and closed the Granada Studios Tour in 2001, citing decreasing visitor figures. The real reason was the decision to increase production of episodes for &quot;Coronation Street&quot; to five per week. Without access to that set, the highlight of the tour, the Granada Studios Tour venture was no longer viable. The company also closed Granada Film. The emergence of digital television cut ITV&#x27;s viewing share, decreasing advertising revenue, which was already suffering from competition with the internet. The failure of ITV Digital cost Granada and Carlton losses estimated at over £1 billion reducing the company&#x27;s value from 2001 to 2003.

===ITV Granada and the unification of ITV===
On 28 October 2002, in a network-wide relaunch, Granada was rebranded as ITV1 Granada. The Granada name was shown before regional programmes, but this has ceased; its name has all but disappeared from screens, as have all other ITV regional identities. Since rebranding, all continuity announcements are made from London. The Granada logo appeared at the end of its own programmes until 31 October 2004.

Granada was permitted by the government to merge with Carlton on 2 February 2004 to form ITV plc. The move was a takeover by Granada, whose market capitalisation was double that of Carlton, at nearly £2 billion. Granada owned 68% of the shares and Carlton 32%; chairman designate Michael Green was ousted by shareholders and the majority of new board members originated from Granada. Carlton employees were subsumed in Granada operations or made redundant, with three out of four new departments led by Granada staff.

From 1 November 2004, Granada productions were credited &quot;Granada Manchester&quot;, the brand of the unified in-house production arm but on 21 September 2005, it was announced that Granada&#x27;s name would no longer appear at the end of programmes. The in-house production arm was renamed ITV Productions. The change on 16 January 2006 coincided with a relaunch of ITV&#x27;s on-screen graphics. Granada&#x27;s name and logo were still used at the end of programmes made for other networks, such as &quot;University Challenge&quot; for BBC Two, and old programmes shown on BSkyB channels Sky One, and the former Sky Two (now Sky Replay) and Sky Three (now Sky Mix), until 2009.

On 13 November 2006, Granada lost its on-air identity when regional programming voiced ITV1 or ITV1 Granada over a generic ident. Local news coverage was branded &quot;Granada News&quot; except for the main 18.00 &quot;Granada Reports&quot; bulletin. &quot;Granada Reports&quot;″ main rival is BBC North West Tonight, broadcast to roughly the same region. In 2009, ITV removed the Granada brand from all departments including its international production arm, Granada America which became ITV Studios America. End credits on programmes made at The Manchester Studios were credited to ITV Studios.

===Present===
ITV made cutbacks, dropping 600 jobs in 2009, which effectively closed the Yorkshire Television Leeds Studios; more redundancies were made in London, leaving Granada relatively unscathed. In the 2009 ITV regional news cutbacks, Granada was one of three regions unaffected by changes, except for extending its coverage area to include the Isle of Man, which had previously been served by ITV Border.

ITV is obliged by UK communications regulator Ofcom to produce 50% of its programmes outside London, something it failed to achieve in 2007 and 2008. With this obligation, retaining Manchester as the northern hub, and an £80m move to MediaCityUK on 25 March 2013, ITV appears to be committed to the Granada region for the foreseeable future.

==Studios==

In the eighteen months between the award of the franchise and the start of transmission, Granada built a brand new studio complex on Quay Street. The site was reportedly previously a cemetery for pauper&#x27;s graves, where 22,000 people were buried. An article in &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper and an episode of the TV series &quot;Most Haunted&quot; seem to be the only sources for this claim in 2009. Twelve maps from between 1772 and 1960 show no evidence of a cemetery and buildings are shown on the bull china site from 1807. Part of the Manchester and Salford Junction Canal, which linked the River Irwell to the Rochdale Canal from 1839 to 1922, ran in a tunnel underneath the site. The studios pre-dated BBC Television Centre by four years and were the first purpose-built television studios in the United Kingdom.

Bernstein exaggerated the scale of the studios, to make Granada appear a rival to the BBC, and gave the studios only even numbers so that it appeared there were twelve despite there only being six. The studios were operated by 3sixtymedia, ITV Studios&#x27; joint-venture company with BBC Resources Ltd from 2000. The studios later hosted shows displaced by the proposed closure of the Yorkshire Television studios in Leeds in 2009, including Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Countdown.&quot;

In September 2010, the noted 1950s red landmark &quot;Granada TV&quot; sign on the roof and entrance of Granada Studios on Quay Street was removed for safety reasons after maintenance found it was badly corroded. The Museum of Science and Industry (MOSI) now owns the sign, deeming it important to Manchester&#x27;s cultural heritage.

===Relocation===
After the ITV merger in 2004, the possibility of selling the Quay Street site was considered, with staff, studios and offices moved into the adjacent bonded warehouse building. ITV anticipated the BBC would buy the land but the BBC opted to move to the Peel Group&#x27;s MediaCityUK development in Salford Quays. ITV considered relocating to Trafford Wharf across the Manchester Ship Canal from the BBC at MediaCityUK. Discussions continued for several years and an agreement in principle was reached in 2008. In March 2009, in the recession, Granada announced it would remain at Quay Street, but after a change of management, talks resumed in January 2010. Two years later, on 16 December 2010, Granada announced it would move to the Orange Building in MediaCityUK alongside the University of Salford. It planned to build a studio to produce &quot;Coronation Street&quot; on the opposite bank of the ship canal on Trafford Wharf. Planning permission was granted, and building work began on 6 September 2011 with the goal of completion in 2012. ITV Granada moved to MediaCityUK on 25 March 2013.

==Identity==
Throughout its history, Granada Television used the logo of an arrow pointing northwards in idents, often accompanied by the tagline &quot;from the North&quot;. Sidney Bernstein wanted to present a northern identity.
Granada Television was considered &quot;bolder&quot;, &quot;&quot; and more &quot;Socialist&quot; in its identity than the other more &quot;sedate&quot; and &quot;Conservative&quot; ITV franchisees and the BBC, and placed great emphasis displaying the northern style which distinguished it from them. Bernstein believed the north had &quot;untapped creative energy&quot; that needed cultivation.

Granada was one of the few regions that did not play the national anthem at closedown.

In 1958, two years after its launch, Granada Television&#x27;s northern style was apparent. Kenneth Clark, of the ITA, which let the franchise, remarked: &quot;We did not quite foresee how much Granada Television would develop a character which distinguishes it most markedly from the other programmes companies and from the BBC.&quot; Peter Salmon, of the BBC said: &quot;Granada Television made TV programmes in the north west; for northerners, reflecting northern culture and attitudes.&quot;

===Idents===


From its launch in 1956 until 1968, when an ident featuring the word &quot;GRANADA&quot; between two horizontal lines was introduced, the channel used captions and animations featuring a thin arrow pointing upwards and Granada, in a stylised font, in boxes. The arrow pointed at the &quot;n&quot; in Granada, pointing north and sometimes animated revealing the slogan &quot;From the North&quot;, before the Granada name.

After the use of the word &quot;GRANADA&quot; between two horizontal lines was phased out in the first half of 1969, the famous pointed &quot;G&quot; logo, incorporating the upward/Northward facing arrow used previously into a letter &quot;G&quot; was introduced. This was to be the corporate logo for the Granada Group as a whole (also seen as the logo for Granada&#x27;s TV rentals firm), so it was introduced to their ITV franchise as a matter of course rather than the ITV franchise choosing to adopt the new branding. This logo was originally white on a grey background (although occasionally seen as black on a white background) but after the introduction of colour, grey was replaced with blue (after a short period of using white symbol/yellow lettering/purple background), with the GRANADA name in white and the G symbol in yellow.

A colour emblem was used from the 1970s until it was replaced by a series of idents to celebrate Granada Television&#x27;s 30th anniversary on 3 May 1986, when it was a computer-animated pointed &quot;G&quot; against a graded background and a cake covered in candles in the pointed G shape. On 1 September 1986, Granada Television reverted to using a caption featuring a gold or chrome 3D pointed &quot;G&quot; on a graded blue background. Granada Television used in-vision continuity featuring northern personalities giving messages. It was common for the logo to be seen for a few seconds after the continuity before the programme, and continuity was rarely given over the symbol.

On 1 September 1989, Granada Television launched a look featuring a translucent pointed G, which rotated into place in time to the music against a natural scene. When the first ITV generic look was launched, Granada Television refused to adopt it, because the Granada Television logo was incorrectly inserted into the &quot;V&quot; segment of the logo, with the line connecting the &quot;G&quot; and the arrow not being added entirely. The company used a version with its translucent logo shown at the beginning, before continuing with the generic ident and ending with the generic ITV logo.

On 4 June 1990, Granada Television, in the run-up to the 1990 franchise round, relaunched its on-screen branding to a blue stripe descending from the top of the screen, containing the pointed &quot;G&quot;, against a plain white background accompanied by the same music as previously. Variations were seen from which the stripe formed from a falling feather or was backlit. On 2 May 1992, the stripe descended to reveal a rainbow of colours before becoming the usual blue and this ident stays on screen until 1 January 1995.

On 3 January 1994, Granada Television introduced a series of films featuring flags with its logo against various scenes in the region, accompanied by the slogan &#x27;Setting the Standard&#x27;. These introduced local programming, &quot;Granada Reports&quot;, or promotions.

On 2 January 1995, the stripe theme was modified; the pointed &quot;G&quot; was larger on the blue stripe against a computer generated multicoloured background and the &quot;G&quot; was created by filming a large perspex &quot;G&quot; with motion control photography. This ident was used, from a variety of angles, until 7 November 1999, by which point additional idents based on surreal surroundings, such as a fish blowing a bubble with a G inside, which floated to the surface, or a camera zoom into the eye of a housewife to reveal the G in her eye, were introduced on 2 September 1996.

All of the idents were replaced on 8 November 1999 when Granada Television took the generic hearts idents. Granada Television kept the pointed G logo, made slightly thinner and placed in a box at the top of the screen. The dual branding of Granada Television and ITV lasted until 28 October 2002, when regional identities were dropped in favour of the new ITV1 channel brand. The celebrities ident package featured plain ITV1 idents for all national programmes, and Granada Television placed under the ITV1 logo for regional programmes. This practice continued until 16 January 2006, when no name was used, and Granada Productions was replaced with ITV Productions on programme end boards. The Granada Television logo continued on end boards until this date. The Granada name was used on announcements before local programming over a generic ITV1 ident until all non-news regional programming was scrapped.

On 14 January 2013, ITV1 reverted to its original name of ITV, along with all other ITV plc-owned franchises.

During the early days, the pointed G logo was used on two other subsidiary businesses. Firstly came the Red Arrow Television Rental chain. During the days when many families preferred to rent their TV sets to offset poor reliability and changing fashions, and due to the high price of television receivers, this company fared well alongside the established &quot;heavy hitters&quot; such as Radio Rentals. The company&#x27;s opening promotion was to give every new customer a small, Hiawatha-style figurine to stand on top of their new TV set. Upon its success, the name was later changed to Granada TV Rental. Based on the results of this company, Granada Television dipped its toes into the office furniture rental business, and carpet sales and fitting for larger business customers, with Black Arrow. This business was less successful.

==Programmes==

In 1958, Granada Television broadcast coverage of the 1958 Rochdale by-election, the first election to be covered on television in Britain. Granada&#x27;s coverage was broad in scope, and it also broadcast two candidate debates. Over 50 years later, Granada Studios hosted the first General Election debate among the leaders of the three main political parties.

Granada&#x27;s boldness was seen in ambitious documentaries such as &quot;Seven Up!&quot;, which premiered in 1964. The programme was a social experiment which followed the lives of 14 British children aged seven. It tracked their lives at seven-year intervals to discover whether their hopes and aspirations had been achieved. The documentary was voted the greatest ever by esteemed filmmakers and its latest installment, &quot;63 Up&quot;, premiered in 2019. &quot;Seven Up&quot; was part of the &quot;World in Action&quot; documentary series between 1963 and 1998, which won awards but was controversial. It garnered a reputation for hard-hitting investigative journalism and its producer Gus Macdonald commented that the programme was &quot;born brash&quot;. Paul Greengrass said that David Plowright told him, &quot;don&#x27;t forget, your job&#x27;s to make trouble.&quot; &quot;World in Action&quot; demonstrated hard-hitting investigative journalism and explored issues such as police corruption at the Metropolitan Police in 1985 and the Royal Family&#x27;s tax loophole in 1991. The programme led a campaign to prove the innocence of the Birmingham Six in 1985 when researcher Chris Mullin questioned the convictions; by 1991 the men had been released from prison.

The classic northern working-class soap opera, &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, began a thirteen-week, twice weekly regional run of half-hour episodes on 9 December 1960. It is still produced at the rate of three one-hour peak-time episodes a week after over sixty years, and is the longest-running television soap opera in the world. Such set-pieces as &quot;Siege Week&quot; and &quot;the 2010 Tram Crash&quot; were filmed at the studio. The company also produced gritty drama series such as &quot;A Family at War&quot; (1970–72), set during the Second World War.

Granada produced &quot;The Stars Look Down&quot; (1975), &quot;Laurence Olivier Presents&quot; (1976–78), &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; (1981), the multi-award-winning &quot;Disappearing World&quot; series (between 1969 and 1993) and, from 1984, &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; and &quot;The Jewel in the Crown&quot; for an international audience. These shows were sold overseas by &quot;Granada Television International&quot;.

Another flagship programme, the long-running quiz show, &quot;University Challenge&quot; was originally aired between 1962 and 1987. It was revived by the BBC in 1994 but still produced by Granada. The company produced &quot;The Krypton Factor&quot; between 1977 and 1995 (revived by ITV in 2009). One of Granada&#x27;s longest-running programmes, &quot;What The Papers Say&quot;, was broadcast by Granada in 1956, was taken over by the BBC in the early 1990s, and later by Channel 4. The programme introduced the idea of discussing what the newspapers were reporting, continued by &quot;Sunday Supplement&quot; and &quot;The Wright Stuff&quot;. In the 1970s, Granada produced situation comedies, often based around life in the north-west, including &quot;Nearest and Dearest&quot;, &quot;The Lovers&quot; and &quot;The Cuckoo Waltz,&quot; followed by &quot;The Brothers McGregor&quot; and &quot;Watching&quot; in the 1980s.

Granada drew on 1970s pop music with shows such as &quot;Lift Off with Ayshea&quot; and the Bay City Rollers show, &quot;Shang-a-lang&quot;. Granada&#x27;s &quot;So It Goes&quot; was presented by Tony Wilson and showcased the punk phenomenon, bringing the Sex Pistols and the Clash to TV screens. The station also produced &quot;Marc&quot;, presented by glam rock star Marc Bolan. The show was in production when Bolan was killed in a car accident in 1977. Granada produced &quot;Allsorts&quot; from 1989 to 1995 for CITV, featuring Wayne Jackman, Andrew Wightman (who later produced Granada&#x27;s talent show &quot;Stars in Their Eyes&quot;), Virginia Radcliffe, Jane Cox and Julie Westwood.

Granada Studios produced &quot;The Weekenders&quot; (1992), a surreal comedy episode featuring Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer.

==Significant broadcasters==
Denis Forman, chairman 1974-87, and David Plowright, chairman 1987–92, were the executives who led Granada Television during its most successful years. Forman and Plowright have been described as embodying the Granada outlook, which was &quot;non-conformist, alternative, non-London&quot;.

Granada Television introduced many broadcasters to British television, and a number of its directors, producers and writers went on to create their own production companies. Some have been recognised for their achievements in British television with honours such as knighthoods, while others achieved senior posts such as Director-General of the BBC. Jeremy Isaacs developed a significant portion of Granada&#x27;s factual programming, and the company produced a generation of major British TV &quot;players&quot; including John Birt, later Director-General of the BBC, and Gus Macdonald, his fellow &quot;World in Action&quot; producer. Many began work as researchers on &quot;World in Action&quot;.

==Other ventures==

===Granada Studios Tour===

The Granada Studios Tour opened in 1988 as an entertainment park on the Granada Studios Quay Street back lot, themed around television productions. The park featured a replica set of 10 Downing Street, and visitors were shown how television is produced. The main feature was the set of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;

===G-Wizz===

Several of Granada&#x27;s programmes administered their websites using G-Wizz, including &quot;This Morning&quot;, &quot;Coronation Street&quot; and &quot;Emmerdale&quot;. Its Flash-heavy pages were mostly unusable by subscribers, who were then still largely modem-based, and take-up was low. Less than a year after it opened, Granada closed G-Wizz in March 2001, after it had cost the company £9 million. It combined the remainder of its online presence with fellow ITV company Carlton to launch itv.com.

===Granada Sky Broadcasting===

In 1996 Granada joined BSkyB to form a joint venture, Granada Sky Broadcasting (GSB) providing content and new channels to the satellite platform. Granada launched a range of television channels broadcasting the Granada archive on the Sky satellite television platform and other digital platforms such as ITV Digital which closed in 2002 due to administration, NTL and Telewest (which merged to form Virgin Media).
GSB operated as a joint venture until 2004 when ITV was formed. Consequently, ITV purchased BSkyB&#x27;s 10% stake in the venture and launched ITV3, which replaced Granada Plus. GSB was renamed the &quot;ITV digital channels Ltd&quot; to reflect ITV plc control.

===ONdigital===
From 1997 until 2002 Granada and Carlton invested, and lost, over £1 billion with a joint venture into ONdigital, a pay-TV, digital terrestrial broadcaster. ONdigital was rebranded ITV Digital in summer 2001, but opposed by SMG plc, UTV, and Channel Television, who felt it would damage the ITV brand. ONdigital was expected to create a new revenue stream and be floated as a separate company but by March 1999 the service only had 110,000 subscribers, well below the 2 million Granada aimed for. Granada and Carlton persevered by rebranding the service ITV Digital but this too was not successful. Competition from Sky Digital launched in 1998 was too great and ITV Digital ceased broadcasting on 1 May 2002. This led to sweeping cuts in the organisation, including cutting budgets for flagship drama serials and productions and loss of jobs at the Manchester headquarters.

===Additional channels===

====Granada Plus====
Granada Plus was a general entertainment channel, a 50–50 joint venture between Granada Television and British Sky Broadcasting, aimed at older audiences using archive material. The channel, launched on 1 October 1996 as Granada Plus, was later known as G Plus and finally Plus. It broadcast until 1 November 2004, when ITV bought BSkyB&#x27;s stake in GSB, and closed the channel, replacing it with ITV3, and taking Plus&#x27; low EPG position on Sky Digital.

====Men &amp; Motors====
Men &amp; Motors was a male-orientated channel which launched on the same day as Granada Plus, sharing transponder space with Plus and broadcasting for three hours a day in the late evening. In 2004 it became a full-time channel, broadcasting motors programming during the day and adult programming in the late evening although the adult programming was dropped when the channel went free-to-air in 2005. It lasted longest of all the channels, and ran until 2010, when it was closed to make way for ITV HD. Most of its programmes were transferred to ITV4.

====Granada Breeze====
Originally Granada Good Life, Granada Breeze was another GSB venture which also launched on 1 October 1996. It was a lifestyle channel aimed at women viewers and showed programmes on, cookery, health and US daytime television such as &quot;Judge Joe Brown&quot;. It provided programmes split into themed sections called Granada Talk Television, Granada Food and Wine, Granada Health and Beauty, Granada Television High Street and Granada Home and Garden. Most shows were presented from a large conservatory studio outside the Coronation Street studio which was later used for daytime ITV Play programming. Granada Breeze was scaled down in July 2001 before ceasing operation in March 2002 due to poor viewing figures.

====Others====
Wellbeing was a joint venture with Boots, modelled on Granada Breeze, and was broadcast from The Leeds Studios, although Granada made some programmes, closed in 2003.

Granada Talk TV focused on chat shows and closed after less than a year on air.

Shop!, launched in 1998, was a partnership between Granada and Littlewoods. However, its closure was announced in 2002.

==Reception==

===Awards and accolades===
Granada Television had a reputation for strong production values. In 1999, Granada Television made eight of ITV&#x27;s top-rated programmes and 30% of the UK&#x27;s top-rated programmes came from its studios and in 2005 supplied 63% of ITV original production.
It was the only ITA broadcaster created in 1954 that survived into the 21st century, and it flourished until it emerged as the dominant player in the ITV network by 2000.

In the nineteen BAFTA Awards for the Best Drama series awarded since 1992, Granada Television has won five in total, &quot;Cracker&quot; twice in 1994 and 1995, &quot;Cold Feet&quot; in 2002 and &quot;The Street&quot; in 2007 and 2008 – more than any other production company.

&quot;Coronation Street&quot; became the longest running serial soap in 2010 when it celebrated its 50th anniversary, and the &quot;Seven Up&quot; documentary series was voted the greatest documentary in a Channel 4 programme by film makers.

====Criticisms of perceived Manchester-centric bias====
In three franchise rounds (1967, 1980, and 1991) three groups (Palatine Television, Merseyvision, and Mersey Television, wherein the latter two were unconnected) each made audacious bids to rid Granada (and in 1967, ABC) of its franchise, but were unsuccessful, given that Granada was well respected (second only to the BBC). The opponents claimed to the regulatory bodies that existed at the time (the ITA in 1967, the IBA in 1981, and the ITC in 1991) in these successive franchise rounds that Granada was too Manchester-centric at the expense of the Liverpool area and need to cater for the whole of north west England. They were supported by the fact that Granada Television was frequently referred to as &quot;Granada Manchester&quot; instead of &quot;Granada North West&quot;, as most productions were made in Manchester and in 2005 Granada and Manchester City Council held a celebration recognising Granada&#x27;s 50th anniversary, cementing this perception further. In 1993, Brian Sedgemore MP complained that promises Granada made during the 1991 franchise round to open offices in Chester, Lancaster and Blackburn were not fulfilled, but David Liddiment at Granada did not believe this assertion to be true.

Granada had increased investment in Liverpool moving its regional news service to the Albert Dock complex in 1986, before moving back to Quay Street sometime in the early 2000s.

The daytime show &quot;This Morning&quot; broadcast from Liverpool&#x27;s Albert Dock for many years before it moved to the London Studios in 1996, as it was difficult to get celebrity guests to travel from London to Liverpool.

====Criticisms and controversies over &quot;World in Action&quot; and &quot;Tonight&quot;====
Granada&#x27;s bold, hard-hitting television and documentaries resulted in a number of legal cases. David Plowright told junior researcher Paul Greengrass that Granada&#x27;s role was to &quot;make trouble&quot;. &quot;World in Action&quot; was hard-hitting but resulted in expensive libel trials when false accusations were made in the 1990s.

In 1998 Granada paid £2 million, in two cases, to three Metropolitan Police officers who were wrongly accused of covering up a murder and Marks and Spencer for alleging M&amp;S knew one of its suppliers was using child labour. &quot;World in Action&quot; was axed in 1998 and replaced by the &quot;Tonight&quot; programme in 1999. &quot;Tonight&quot; was also criticised, but this time for dumbing down, as it was markedly less hard-hitting.

Nevertheless, &quot;Tonight&quot; had occasionally stirred controversy like its predecessor. An example is the 2003 documentary &quot;Living with Michael Jackson&quot; (a &quot;Tonight&quot; special). Its airing resulted in the threat of legal action by Michael Jackson. The documentary gained an audience of fifteen million in the United Kingdom, and newspapers depicted Jackson in a negative light following the documentary. Jackson did not, ultimately, bring any case to court.

<doc id="180155" wikidata="Q642550" url="?curid=180155" title="Heinkel He 100">
<text>The Heinkel He 100 was a German pre-World War II fighter aircraft design from Heinkel. Although it proved to be one of the fastest fighter aircraft in the world at the time of its development, the design was not ordered into series production. Approximately 19 prototypes and pre-production examples were built. None are known to have survived the war.

The reason for the He 100 failing to reach production status is mostly unknown. Officially, the Luftwaffe rejected the He 100 to concentrate single-seat fighter development on the Messerschmitt Bf 109. Following the adoption of the Bf 109 and Messerschmitt Bf 110 as the Luftwaffe&#x27;s standard fighter types, the Ministry of Aviation (the Reichsluftfahrtministerium or RLM) announced a &quot;rationalization&quot; policy that placed fighter development at Messerschmitt and bomber development at Heinkel.

Because there are no surviving examples, and since many factory documents - including all blueprints for the He 100 - were destroyed during a bombing raid, there is limited specific information about the design and its unique systems.

==Development==
Following the selection by the RLM of the Bf 109 as its next single-seat fighter over the He 112, Ernst Heinkel became interested in a new fighter that would surpass the performance of the Bf 109 as much as the Bf 109 had surpassed that of the biplanes it replaced. Other German designers had similar ambitions, including Kurt Tank at Focke-Wulf. There was never an official project on the part of the RLM, but Rudolf Lucht felt that new designs were important enough to fund the projects from both companies to provide &quot;super-pursuit&quot; designs for evaluation. This would result in the single-engined He 100 fighter, and the promising twin-engine Fw 187 &quot;Falke&quot; &quot;Zerstörer&quot;-style heavy fighter, both reaching the flight stage of development.
Walter Günter, one half of the famous Günter brothers, looked at the existing He 112, which had already been heavily revised into the He 112B version, and decided it had reached the end of its development and started a completely new design, &quot;Projekt&quot; 1035. Learning from past mistakes on the 112 project, the design was to be as easy to build as possible yet was a design goal. To ease production, the new design had considerably fewer parts than the 112 and those that remained contained fewer compound curves. In comparison, the 112 had 2,885 parts and 26,864 rivets, while the P.1035 was made of 969 unique parts with 11,543 rivets. The new straight-edged wing was a source of much of the savings; after building the first wings, Otto Butter reported that the reduction in complexity and rivet count (along with the Butter brothers&#x27; own explosive rivet system) saved an astonishing 1,150 man hours per wing.

The super-pursuit type was not a secret, but Ernst Heinkel preferred to work in private and publicly display his products only after they were developed sufficiently to make a stunning first impression. As an example of this, the mock-up for the extremely modern-looking He 100 was the subject of company Memo No.3657 on 31 January that stated: &quot;The mock-up is to be completed by us ... as of the beginning of May ... and be ready to present to the RLM ... and prior to that no one at the RLM is to know of the existence of the mock-up.&quot;

Walter Günter was killed in a car accident on 25 May 1937, and design work was taken over by his twin brother Siegfried, who finished the final draft of the design later that year. Heinrich Hertel, a specialist in aircraft structures, also played a prominent role in the design. At the end of October the design was submitted to the RLM, complete with details on prototypes, delivery dates and prices for three aircraft delivered to the Rechlin test center.

The He 100 should have been designated He 113, but since the number &quot;13&quot; was unlucky, it was not used. It is reported that Ernst Heinkel lobbied for this &quot;round&quot; number in the hope that it would improve the design&#x27;s chances for production.

===Design===

In order to get the promised performance the design included a number of drag-reducing features. The landing gear (including the tailwheel) was retractable and completely enclosed in flight.

There was also a serious shortage of advanced aero engines in Germany during the late 1930s. The He 100 used the same Daimler-Benz DB 601 engine as the Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Bf 110, and there was insufficient capacity to support another aircraft using the same engine. The only available alternative engine was the Junkers Jumo 211, and Heinkel was encouraged to consider its use in the He 100. However, the early Jumo 211 then available did not use a pressurized cooling system, and it was therefore not suitable for the He 100&#x27;s evaporative cooling system. Furthermore, a Jumo 211-powered He 100 would not have been able to outperform the contemporary DB 601-powered Bf 109 because the supercharger on the early Jumo 211 was not fully shrouded. In order to reduce weight and frontal area, the engine was mounted directly to the forward fuselage, which was strengthened and literally tailored to the DB 601, as opposed to conventional mounting on engine bearers. The cowling was very tight-fitting, and as a result the aircraft has something of a slab-sided appearance.

In order to provide as much power as possible from the DB 601, exhaust ejectors were used to provide a small amount of additional thrust. The supercharger inlet was moved from the normal position on the side of the cowling to a location in the leading edge of the left wing. Although cleaner-looking, the long, curved induction pipe most probably negated any benefit.

=== Engine coolant and oil cooling systems ===

For the rest of the designed performance increase with the DB 601 powerplant, Walter turned to the experimental method of evaporative cooling. Heinkel and the Günter brothers were avid proponents of the technology, and had previously used it on the He 119, with promising results. Evaporative or &quot;steam&quot; cooling promised a completely drag-free cooling system and reduced weight. No detailed plans of the installation survive. The earlier prototypes varied, but they were all eventually modified to something close to the final standard before they were exported to the Soviet Union.

===World speed record===
One aspect of the original &quot;Projekt&quot; 1035 was intended to capture the absolute speed record. The third and eighth prototypes were specially modified for speed, with unique outer wing panels of reduced span. The third prototype crashed during testing. The record flight was made using a special version of the DB 601 engine that produced and had a service life of just 30 minutes. Prior to setting this absolute speed record over a short, measured course, Ernst Udet flew the second prototype to a closed course record of on 5 June 1938. Udet&#x27;s record was apparently set using a standard DB 601a engine.

However, although the Me 209 V1 (known erroneously as the &quot;Me 109R&quot;, ignoring the July 1938-dated change in prefixes) officially won over the He 100 and held the world speed record for piston engined aircraft for roughly 30 years, some historians such as Erwin Hood, state that the Me 209 V1&#x27;s flight was 450 meters above sea level due to the topography of where its flight was held (at Augsburg) compared to that the He 100 V8&#x27;s location of 50 meters above sea level (in Mecklenburg), thus their speed comparisons are not valid as the higher an aircraft goes, the lower the density of the atmosphere is, thus there is less drag. Hood then asserts that, based on his own calculations, if the He 100 V8 had flown at the same altitude of the Me 209 V1, it would have obtained a speed of 757 km/h.

=== Designation debate ===
There is a debate regarding the correct designation of the He 100 aircraft actually built. Green (1970) cited &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; variants, and that later He 100 prototypes and all pre-production He 100s were called &quot;He 100D-0&quot; and &quot;He 100D-1&quot; production runs. However, Heinkel documents indicate that the pre-production were only designated He 100A-0, and that all of the He 100s built were essentially the same, with even the prototypes later updated to the production standard before they were exported to the Soviet Union. Thus, supposed &quot;He 100B&quot;, &quot;He 100C&quot;, and &quot;He 100D&quot; designations are fictitious postwar inventions.

===Prototypes===
The first prototype He 100 V1 flew on 22 January 1938, only a week after its promised delivery date. The aircraft proved to be outstandingly fast. However, it continued to share a number of problems with the earlier He 112, notably a lack of directional stability. In addition, the Luftwaffe test pilots disliked the high wing loading, which resulted in landing speeds so great that they often had to use brakes right up to the last of the runway. The ground crews also disliked the design, complaining about the tight cowling which made servicing the engine difficult. But the big problem turned out to be the cooling system, largely to no one&#x27;s surprise. After a series of test flights V1 was sent to Rechlin in March.

The second prototype He 100 V2 addressed the stability problems by changing the vertical stabilizer from a triangular form to a larger and more rectangular form. The oil-cooling system continued to be problematic, so it was removed and replaced with a small semi retractable radiator below the wing. It also received the still-experimental DB 601M engine which the aircraft was originally designed for. The M version was modified to run on &quot;C3&quot; fuel at 100 octane, which would allow it to run at higher power ratings in the future.

V2 was completed in March, but instead of moving to Rechlin it was kept at the factory for an attempt on the 100 km (62 mi) closed circuit speed record. A course was marked out on the Baltic coast between Wustrow and Müritz, 50 km (30 mi) apart, and the attempt was to be made at the aircraft&#x27;s best altitude of . After some time cleaning out the bugs the record attempt was set to be flown by Captain Herting, who had previously flown the aircraft several times.

At this point Ernst Udet showed up and asked to fly V2, after pointing out he had flown the V1 at Rechlin. He took over from Herting and flew the V2 to a new world closed-circuit record on 5 June 1938, at . Several of the cooling pumps failed on this flight as well, but Udet wasn&#x27;t sure what the lights meant and simply ignored them.

The record was heavily publicized, but in the press the aircraft was referred to as the &quot;He 112U&quot;. Apparently, the &quot;U&quot; stood for &quot;Udet&quot;. At the time the 112 was still in production and looking for customers, so this was one way to boost sales of the older design. V2 was then moved to Rechlin for continued testing. Later in October, the aircraft was damaged on landing when the tail wheel didn&#x27;t extend, and it is unclear if the damage was repaired.

The V3 prototype received the clipped racing wings, which reduced span and area from and , to and . The canopy was replaced with a much smaller and more rounded version, and all of the bumps and joints were puttied over and sanded down. The aircraft was equipped with the 601M and flown at the factory.

In August, the DB 601R engine arrived from Daimler-Benz and was installed. This version increased the maximum rpm from 2,200 to 3,000, and added methyl alcohol to the fuel mixture to improve cooling in the supercharger and thus increase boost. As a result, the output was boosted to , although it required constant maintenance and the fuel had to be drained completely after every flight. The aircraft was then moved to Warnemünde for the record attempt in September.

On one of the pre-record test flights by the Heinkel chief pilot, Gerhard Nitschke, the main gear failed to extend and ended up stuck half open. Since the aircraft could not be safely landed it was decided to have Nitschke bail out and let the aircraft crash in a safe spot on the airfield. Gerhard was injured when he hit the tail on the way out, and made no further record attempts.

V4 was to have been the only &quot;production&quot; prototype and was referred to as the &quot;100B&quot; model (V1 through V3 being &quot;A&quot; models). It was completed in the summer and delivered to Rechlin, so it wasn&#x27;t available for modification into racing trim when V3 crashed. Although the aircraft was unarmed it was otherwise a service model with the 601M, and in testing over the summer it proved to be considerably faster than the Bf 109. At sea level, the aircraft could reach , faster than the Bf 109E&#x27;s speed at its best altitude. At , it improved to , topping out at at before falling again to at . The aircraft had flown a number of times before its landing gear collapsed while standing on the pad on 22 October. The aircraft was later rebuilt and was flying by March 1939.

Although V4 was to have been the last of the prototypes in the original plans, production was allowed to continue with a new series of six aircraft. One of the airframes was selected to replace V3, and as luck would have it V8 was at the &quot;right point&quot; in its construction and was completed out of turn. It first flew on 1 December but this was with a standard DB 601Aa engine. The 601R was then put in the aircraft on 8 January 1939, and moved to a new course at Oranienberg. After several shakedown flights, Hans Dieterle flew to a new record on 30 March 1939, at . Once again the aircraft was referred to as the He 112U in the press. It is unclear what happened to V8 in the end; it may have been used for crash testing.

V5 was completed like V4, and first flew on 16 November. It was later used in a film about V8&#x27;s record attempt, in order to protect the record breaking aircraft. At this point, a number of changes were made to the design resulting in the &quot;100C&quot; model, and with the exception of V8 the rest of the prototypes were all delivered as the C standard.

V6 was first flown in February 1939, and after some test flights at the factory it was flown to Rechlin on 25 April. There it spent most of its time as an engine testbed. On 9 June, the gear failed inflight, but the pilot managed to land the aircraft with little damage, and it was returned to flying condition in six days.

V7 was completed on 24 May with a change to the oil cooling system. It was the first to be delivered with armament, consisting of two MG FF cannon in the wings and four MG 17 machine guns arranged around the engine cowling. This made the He 100 the most heavily armed fighter of its day. V7 was then flown to Rechlin where the armament was removed and the aircraft was used for a series of high speed test flights.

V9 was also completed and armed, but was used solely for crash testing and was &quot;tested to destruction&quot;. V10 was originally to suffer a similar fate, but instead ended up being given the racing wings and canopy of the V8 and displayed in the German Museum in Munich as the record-setting &quot;He 112U&quot;. It was later destroyed in a bombing attack.

Overheating problems and general failures with the cooling system motors continued to be a problem. Throughout the testing period, failures of the pumps ended flights early, although some of the test pilots simply started ignoring them. In March, Kleinemeyer wrote a memo to Ernst Heinkel about the continuing problems, stating that Schwärzler had asked to be put on the problem.

Another problem that was never cured during the prototype stage was a rash of landing gear problems. Although the wide-set gear should have eliminated the collapse of landing gears that plagued the Bf 109, especially in the difficult take-offs and landings, the He 100&#x27;s landing gear was not built to withstand heavy use, and as a result they were no improvement over the Bf 109. V2, 3, 4 and 6 were all damaged to various degrees due to various gear failures, a full half of the prototypes.

==Operational history==
===He 100 D-0===
Throughout the prototype period, the various models were given series designations (as noted above), and presented to the RLM as the basis for series production. The Luftwaffe never took Heinkel up on their offer although the company decided to build a total of 25 of the aircraft one way or the other, so with 10 down, there were another 15 of the latest model to go. In keeping with general practice, any series production is started with a limited run of &quot;zero series&quot;, resulting in the He 100 D-0.

The D-0 was similar to the earlier C models, with a few notable changes. Primary among these was a larger vertical tail in order to finally solve the stability issues. In addition, the cockpit and canopy were slightly redesigned, with the pilot sitting high in a large canopy with excellent vision in all directions. The armament was reduced from the C model to one MG FF/M in the engine V firing through the propeller spinner, and two 7.92 mm (.30-caliber) MG 17s in the wings close to the fuselage.

The three D-0 aircraft were completed by the summer of 1939 and stayed at the Heinkel Marienehe plant for testing. They were later sold to the Japanese Imperial Navy to serve as pattern aircraft for a production line, and were shipped there in 1940. They received the designation AXHe1.

===He 100 D-1===
The final evolution of the short He 100 history is the D-1 model. As the name suggests, the design was supposed to be very similar to the pre-production D-0s, the main planned change being to enlarge the horizontal stabilizer. The big change was the abandonment of the surface cooling system, which proved to be too complex and failure-prone. A larger version of the retractable radiator was installed, and this appeared to cure the problems. The radiator was inserted in a &quot;plug&quot; below the cockpit, widening the wings slightly.

The aircraft failed match its design speed of once it was equipped with weapons, the larger canopy and the radiator, it was still capable of speeds in the range. A low drag airframe is good for speed and range and the He 100 had a combat range of compared to for the Bf 109. While not in the same league as the later escort fighters, this was at the time a superb range, which suggests that a production Heinkel 100 might have offset the need for the Bf 110.

By this point, the war was under way, and as the Luftwaffe would not purchase the aircraft in its current form, the production line was shut down. There were allegations that politics played a role in killing the He 100. The remaining 12 He 100 D-1 fighters were used to form Heinkel&#x27;s Marienehe factory defense unit, flown by factory test pilots. They replaced the earlier He 112s that were used for the same purpose and the 112s were sold. Early in the war, there were no bombers venturing that far into Germany and it appears that the unit never saw action. The fate of the D-1s remains unknown. The aircraft were also used for a propaganda spoof, as the supposed Heinkel He 113.

===Foreign use===
When the war opened in 1939 Heinkel was allowed to look for foreign licensees for the design. Japanese and Soviet delegations visited the Marienehe factory on 30 October 1939 and were both impressed by the design. The Soviets were particularly interested in the surface cooling system, having built the experimental Ilyushin I-21 with evaporative cooling and to gain experience with it they purchased the six surviving prototypes (V1, V2, V4, V5, V6 and V7). After arriving in the USSR they were passed onto the TsAGI institute for study.

The Japanese were also looking for new designs, notably those using inline engines, where they had little experience and purchased the three D-0s for 1.2 million RM, as well as a license for production and a set of jigs for another 1.6 million RM. The three D-0s arrived in Japan in May 1940 and were re-assembled at Kasumigaura. They were then delivered to the Japanese Naval Air Force where they were renamed AXHe1, for &quot;Experimental Heinkel Fighter&quot;. When referring to the German design, the aircraft is called both the He 100 and He 113, with at least one set of plans bearing the latter name.

The prototypes were accompanied by Heinkel test pilot Gerhard Nitschke, who worked with Lieutenant Mitsugi Kofukuda during the testing and evaluation. The Navy was so impressed by tests that they planned to put the aircraft into production as soon as possible, as their land-based interceptor. (Unlike every other armed forces organization in the world, the Japanese Army and Navy both fielded complete land-based air forces.) Hitachi won the contract for the aircraft and started construction of a factory in Chiba for its production. With the European war on, the jigs and plans never arrived.

==Further developments==
In late 1944, the RLM went to manufacturers for a new high-altitude fighter with excellent performance; the Ta 152H (an inline engined version of the Focke-Wulf Fw 190) was in limited production but Heinkel was contracted to design an aircraft and Siegfried Günter was placed in charge of the new Projekt 1076. The new design was similar to the He 100 but many detail changes resulted in an aircraft that looked all new. It sported a new and longer wing for high-altitude work, which lost the inverted gull wing bend and was swept forward slightly at 8°. Flaps or ailerons spanned the entire trailing edge of the wing giving it a rather modern appearance. The cockpit was pressurized for high-altitude flying and covered with a small bubble canopy that was hinged to the side instead of sliding to the rear. Other changes that seem odd in retrospect is that the gear now retracted outward like the original Bf 109 and the surface cooling system was re-introduced. Planned armament was one MK 103 cannon firing through the propeller hub and two wing mounted 30mm MK 108 cannons.

Three engine types were planned, the DB 603M with , the DB 603N with or the Jumo 213E, designed from the start to have the same fluid service locations as the DB 603, with . The 603M and 213E both supplied using MW-50 water injection. Performance with the 603N was projected to be , in the same class as the Messerschmitt Me 262 pioneering jet fighter then entering service testing, which would have stood as a record for many years, even against specialist racing machines. Performance would still be excellent even with the far more likely -output and above class aviation piston engines, which eventually proved to be a severe technological barrier for the German aero-engine industry during the war years. The 603M was projected to give it the high speed of .

These figures are somewhat suspect and are likely to be optimistic guesses that could not have been realised, something Heinkel was famous for. Propellers lose efficiency as they approach the speed of sound and eventually they no longer provide an increase in thrust for an increase in engine power. The only remaining gain of thrust would come from the piston engine exhausts. The advanced contra-rotating &quot;Vereinigte Deutsche Metallwerke&quot; (VDM)-origin propeller design is unlikely to have been able to counteract this problem. The design apparently received low priority and it was not complete by the end of the war. Siegfried Günter later provided detailed drawings and plans for the Americans in mid-1945.

==Legacy==

In 1939, it was reputedly one of the world&#x27;s most advanced fighter designs, even faster than the later Fw 190, with performance unrivalled until the introduction of the Vought F4U Corsair in 1943, with the similarly-powered Republic XP-47J hitting 505 mph (813 km/h) in early August 1944. Nevertheless, the aircraft was not ordered into production. The reason why the He 100 was not put into service seems to vary depending on the person telling the story, and picking any one version results in a firestorm of protest.

Some say it was politics that killed the He 100. However, this seems to stem primarily from Heinkel&#x27;s own telling of the story, which in turn seems to be based on some general malaise over the He 112 debacle. The fact is that Heinkel was well respected within the establishment, regardless of Messerschmitt&#x27;s success with the Bf 109 and Bf 110, and this argument seems particularly weak.

Others blame the bizarre production line philosophy of the RLM, which valued huge numbers of single designs over a mix of different aircraft. This too seems somewhat suspect, considering that the Fw 190 was purchased shortly after this story ends.

For these reasons, it seems safe to accept the RLM version of the story largely at face value; that the production problems with the DB series of engines were so acute that all other designs based on the engine were canceled. At the time the DB 601 engines were being used in both the Bf 109 and Bf 110 aircraft, and Daimler could not keep up with those demands alone. The RLM eventually forbade anyone but Messerschmitt from receiving any DB 601s, leading to the shelving of many designs from a number of vendors. Furthermore, the Bf 109 and Bf 110 were perceived as superior to their likely opponents, which made the requirement for an even more powerful aircraft less imperative.

The only option open to Heinkel was a switch to another engine, and the RLM expressed some interest in purchasing such a version of the He 100. At the time the only other useful inline engine was the Junkers Jumo 211, and even that was in short supply. However, the design of the He 100 made adaptation to the 211 difficult; both the cooling system and the engine mounts were designed for the 601, and a switch to the 211 would have required a redesign. Heinkel felt that it was not worth the effort, considering that the aircraft would end up with inferior performance, and so the He 100 production ends on that sour note. For this reason, more than any other, the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 became the next great aircraft of the Luftwaffe, as it was based around the otherwise unused Bramo 139 (and later BMW 801) radial engine. Although production of these engines was only starting, the lines for the airframes and aircraft could be geared up in parallel without interrupting production of any existing design, which was exactly what happened.

==Aircraft on display==
A full scale mockup of a He 100D-1 is on display at the Planes of Fame Air Museum in Chino, California. No original He 100 airframes are known to exist.

<text>The IAR 80 was a Romanian World War II low-wing monoplane, all-metal monocoque fighter and ground-attack aircraft. When it first flew, in 1939, it was comparable to contemporary designs being deployed by the airforces of the most advanced military powers such as the Hawker Hurricane and Bf 109E. Production problems and lack of available armament delayed entry of the IAR 80 into service until 1941. It remained in frontline use until the end of the war.

==Development==

In order to ensure that the Royal Romanian Air Force (&quot;ARR&quot;) could continue to be supplied with aircraft in time of war, the government subsidized the creation of three major aircraft manufacturers in the 1920s and 1930s. The first was Societatea Pentru Exploatări Tehnice (SET) which was formed in Bucharest in 1923. Next came Industria Aeronautică Română (IAR) which set up shop in Brașov in 1925. Finally there was Întreprinderea de Construcții Aeronautice Românești (ICAR), which was founded in Bucharest in 1932.

In 1930 the Romanian government issued specifications for a new fighter. Although the government was not anticipating bids from its own aircraft industry, IAR produced several prototypes in response to the tender.

The contract was eventually won by the Polish PZL P.11. The ARR purchased 50 of a modified version called the P.11b, all of which were delivered in 1934. A second contest was also fought between the newer IAR 14 and PZL P.24 designs, and once again the PZL design won a contract for another 50 aircraft.

Although IAR&#x27;s own designs had not entered production, they nevertheless won the contracts to build PZL fighters and Gnome-Rhône 14K engines under license. As a result of these and other licence contracts the company had enough money to fund a design studio even if its designs never went into production.

Despite losing to PZL, an IAR design team led by Ion Grosu continued work on fighter designs. He was convinced that the low-wing design of the IAR 24 represented a better design than the PZL gull-wing design, which was often referred to as the &quot;Polish wing&quot;. Once again the team studied the new PZL fighter looking to incorporate its best features into a new aircraft, and the result was the IAR 80.

==Design==
* Description: Low-wing monoplane fighter with conventional control surface layout.
* Fuselage: The fuselage was circular in cross-section, turning to egg-shaped behind the cockpit where it incorporated a ridge-back. The rear fuselage layout, and the engine cowling were based on the Polish PZL P.24.
* Wings: The wings were tapered with rounded tips, the trailing edge angled very slightly forwards. Small flaps ran from the fuselage to a point about 1/3 along the span, where the ailerons started and extended out to the rounded wingtips.
* Other details: A bubble canopy was fitted, sliding to the rear to open, providing excellent visibility except over the nose due to its rearward position. A conventional tailwheel landing gear was used, with the main gear wide-set and retracting inward, with a non-retractable tail skid.

The semi-monocoque tail was copied directly from the PZL P.24. The fuselage from the engine back to the cockpit was new, consisting of a welded steel tube frame covered with duralumin sheeting. The wings were mounted low and were of the same design as those used on the early IAR 24, which had competed with the PZL P.24.

According to an urban legend, the wing profile was copied from the Italian Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 bomber, in service with the ARR at the time, as the design team lacked the time for wing section studies. As a result, the profile was less favorable for higher speeds, but gave the aircraft more maneuverability. This is false as the contract for the SM.79B licence was signed on October 1, 1938, roughly one year after the I.A.R. 80 prototype was completed.

The cockpit&#x27;s interior, instruments, and gunsight were imported from foreign suppliers. This effort to aggregate a fighter from various sources was a result of the last-minute demands for a frontline fighter. The initial IAR 80s were fitted with iron sights. Starting with the 21st aircraft, these were replaced by Goerz GM2 reflector sights which were manufactured under license by &quot;Întreprinderea Optică Română&quot; as the &quot;Telereflex&quot; gunsights.

A Luftwaffe major who tested it in March 1941 had this to say about the IAR 80:

===Prototypes===
Work began on the IAR 80 prototype in late 1937, originally with an open cockpit and the IAR K14 IIIc32 engine which was a licensed Gnome-Rhône 14K II Mistral Major. The prototype was completed slowly, and first took to the air in April 1939. Test flights of the prototype were impressive; the aircraft could reach at , service ceiling of with the ability to climb to in 6 minutes, which was respectable at the time, though not up to the contemporary Supermarine Spitfire or Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters. In comparison the PZL P.24E was almost 450 kg lighter, yet over 80 km/h slower with the same engine. The IAR 80 also proved to be enjoyable to fly and was maneuverable.

A number of minor problems turned up during the prototype phase, and were dealt with over the next year. To improve power the design was updated to mount the newer IAR K14 IIIc36. However this engine was slightly heavier than the IIIc32, which required the rear fuselage to be stretched to move the center of gravity back into the proper position. The extra space in the fuselage allowed the fuel tanks to be increased in volume to . The wing was also enlarged and the tail was revised to eliminate the bracing struts.

A side effect of this extreme rearward position was that the pilot had even worse forward visibility while taxiing than most other taildraggers. To address this somewhat, the pilot&#x27;s seat was raised slightly and a bubble canopy was added.

The updated prototype was tested competitively against the Heinkel He 112, which had arrived in Romania as the start of a potentially large order. Although the He 112 was more heavily armed with two machine guns and two 20 mm cannon, the IAR 80 proved to be a better design and the ARR ordered 100 IAR 80s in December 1939 while only 30 He 112s were accepted. The government in Bucharest ordered another 100 IAR 80s in August 1940. Further orders for batches of 50 IAR 80s followed on 5 September 1941 and 11 April 1942, then another 100 on 28 May 1942, to be followed by 35 of the IAR 81C development in February 1943, with a further 15 in January 1944.

=== IAR 80 ===
Production of the IAR 80 started immediately, although the armament proved to be a serious problem. The prototype had mounted only two Belgian-made Fabrique Nationale 7.92 mm machine guns, a licensed modification of the Browning .30 cal. This armament was not heavy enough against modern aircraft, and the production model was expected to mount six. The German invasion of Belgium in 1940 suspended the supply from FN, and there was no suitable replacement. The first aircraft began production in January 1940, and by 10 July the first IAR 80 took flight, followed by the 2nd on 19 July. The first five aircraft were ready to be delivered in November, with the first batch of 20 being delivered by the middle of February 1941. By April, all 50 initially ordered IAR 80s were delivered. The armament supply remained inadequate so production models only carried four guns.

The initial batch of fighters was well received by the Romanian pilots, but they found the aircraft underpowered and lacking firepower. In order to address this, the aircraft mounted the IAR K14 IVc32 engine in the 21st through 50th examples, but the firepower concern could not be resolved at the time.

=== IAR 80A ===
By April 1941 Romania was firmly in the German sphere of influence, and as a result the Germans released more FN guns for its use. These were quickly installed, and the resulting 80A model finally mounted the original complement of six guns. Armored glass in the windscreen, seat-back armor, and a new gun sight were also added at the same time, along with the newer IAR K14 IVc32 1000A engine. The extra engine power proved to be more than the fuselage structure was designed to handle, and it had to be reinforced with a duralumin &quot;belt&quot; just behind the cockpit in the first 95 A series aircraft built before the fuselage could be modified.

Although the IAR 80A had a more powerful engine, the added weight of the guns, ammunition and armor plating reduced the top speed slightly to . Nevertheless the new model was clearly an advancement, and the A model replaced the earlier one on the assembly line starting with the 51st airframe. Eight of these had been completed in time for the invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941.

FN guns remained in short supply, so throughout late 1941 and early 1942, guns were stripped from PZLs and observation aircraft for use in the IAR 80s.

=== IAR 80B ===
Combat over the Soviet Union proved that even six of the FN guns still lacked punch, and once again firepower was increased, with 13.2 mm FN machine guns taken from Romanian SM.79s were installed in the IAR 80 in a new lengthened wing. The result was the IAR 80B, which also introduced new radios, an area where the aircraft had previously been weak.

A total of 55 of the new design were completed, including 20 airframes which were originally intended to be IAR 81As. These last 20 were thus able to carry a bomb or a drop tank under each wing. The entire series were delivered between June and September 1942.

==== IAR 81A ====
As the fighter model was converting from the A to B series with the addition of the 13.2 mm guns, likewise the 81 model was upgraded in the same fashion, creating the IAR 81A. The only distinguishing feature between the 80B and the 81A was the 81&#x27;s centerline bomb rack, and both were built on the same assembly line. The first order for 81As was cancelled and the airframes were instead delivered to fighter units as 80Bs. Efforts to obtain the Ju 87 dragged on, so a second batch of IAR 81As was ordered in May 1943 to replace losses. Once again fate intervened, and the Germans released the Ju 87 for delivery before the batch could be completed. Like the first batch, these 10 airframes were delivered as fighters.

=== IAR 80C ===
The supply of the 13.2 mm guns was clearly limited, and in a further attempt to increase the firepower of the design the Romanians signed a deal with Ikaria in Germany for a supply of 20 mm MG FF/M cannon. These were a licensed version of the Swiss Oerlikon FF, which had been in use in various German aircraft. The new gun also required a redesign of the wing. Initially 60 IAR 81Bs were intended to be dive bombers, but these were delivered without the centerline bomb rack as fighters and designated IAR 80C. After the first 10 were completed, self-sealing tanks were added along with improved seat-back armor. The first 10 were delivered in December 1942 and the entire order was completed by April 1943.

=== IAR 81 ===
The ARR had intended to replace its light strike and dive bomber aircraft for some time when the war opened in 1941. The first role was to be filled by the IAR 37 (and later 38 and 39 models) but the plan was to fill the second role with the Junkers Ju 87. Once again the Germans deferred and the ARR was left searching for a design. The modification of the existing IAR 80 as a dive bomber was seen as a reasonable option, easier than designing an entirely new aircraft; as well as having obvious production benefits.

The result was the IAR 81, a minor change to the IAR 80A models that were then in production, adding a hinged bomb cradle under the centerline to throw a bomb clear of the propeller (many dive bombers used a similar system). Delivery consisted of a shallow dive from about with the speed around . Pilots disliked the aircraft, as the drag from the bomb cradle significantly hampered performance.

Fifty were ordered in mid-1941 but after 40 had been delivered, bomb racks were added under each wing. The wing racks could also mount 100L drop tanks, allowing the 81 to be used as long-range fighters.

=== IAR 81C ===
The final stage in the IAR 80&#x27;s wartime history was the 81C. This version changed the guns once again, this time to the Mauser MG 151/20 which was replacing the MG FF/M in German service and had just been released for Romanian use. The order for the 81C was placed in May 1942, predating the second order of the 81As.

The first order for 100 airframes was delivered, like all of the prior updates to the 81 series, with the centreline bomb rack removed to be used as fighters. An additional order for 35 was placed in February 1943, and then another 15 in January 1944. These aircraft were primarily to replace losses in earlier models, while production of the Bf 109G ramped up.

=== IAR 80M ===
By 1944 the ARR fighter units included examples of 80A, B and C models, as well as 81, 81Cs. In order to up-gun the earlier fighters as well as simplify logistics and maintenance, an upgrade program was started in mid-1944 to bring all existing airframes to the 81C armament suite of two MG 151/20s and two FN 7.92s. The resulting A and B models of the 80 and 81s would become the 80M and 81M respectively, although at this point there were no dive bombers in use. It is unclear how many conversions were completed.

=== IAR 80DC ===
IAR 80s remained in service until 1949, when they were replaced by La-9s and Il-10s. Those airframes with the lowest hours were modified by removing a fuel tank in front of the cockpit and adding a second seat, resulting in a trainer designated the IAR 80DC. These were used for only a short time before being replaced by Yak-11s and Yak-18s in late 1952.

==Further development==

IAR realized that the Mistral Major was at the limits of its development potential even by the middle of 1941, when the 1000A model reached the same ultimate output as the original Gnome-Rhône engines. An ongoing program to fit the IAR 80 with a more powerful engine had been in the works for most of the design&#x27;s lifetime, but this proved to be a fruitless endeavor.

The most obvious choice for a new engine would have been the BMW 801 used in the Focke-Wulf Fw 190. This engine produced a full more power, and although it was heavier, it was of roughly the same size as the IAR K14. IAR engineers estimated that a BMW powered IAR 80 would have a maximum speed of at least . But the Germans were unable to supply the engine as every example coming off the line was needed for installation in a German airframe. Licensed production was likewise out of the question, the engine production was in the midst of being ramped and the demand was so great that not even one set of jigs could be spared.

In the spring of 1941, IAR 80 no. 13 was fitted with a Daimler-Benz DB 601Aa engine borrowed from a Bf 109E. A flight test was carried out on 21 April 1941, but due to the strong vibrations, the pilot barely managed to bring it to the ground. Development was abandoned after this test flight, and was never flown again. Other tests were carried out with a Daimler-Benz DB 605A fitted to IAR 81C no. 326 in the summer of 1943. According to the test reports, the aircraft&#x27;s performance was greatly improved, however due to difficulties in producing the engine and the Germans not having engines for sale, the project did not materialize.

== Operational history ==

When Operation Barbarossa started, the IAR 80 equipped Esc. 41, 59 and 60 of &quot;Grupul 8 Vânătoare&quot; (8th Fighter Group), part of the &quot;Gruparea Aerienă de Luptă&quot; (GAL), that were tasked to support the Romanian 3rd and 4th Armies deployed at the southern flank of the Eastern Front.
&quot;8th Group&quot; was the only unit assigned a pure fighter role, while 5th and 7th Groups, equipped with German aircraft (Heinkel He 112s and Messerschmitt Bf 109s) were employed primarily as fighter-bombers and bomber escorts.

On 22 June 1941, during the first day of the offensive, the IAR 80 patrols had their baptism of fire, achieving a single aerial victory (claimed by &quot;Sublocotenent aviator&quot; Ioan Mihăilescu of &quot;Esc 60 Vânătoare&quot;, a future ace) during four separate air combats. However, at least four IARs force landed with battle damage, while another two suffered engine trouble. By the end of 1941, 20 IAR 80/81s had been lost in combat or accidents. During 1942 the Romanian aviation industry reached its highest output so that the Royal Romanian Air Force could be re-equipped as follows: Esc. 47, 48 and 52 (&quot;Grupul 9 Vânătoare&quot;), Esc. 43, 44 and 50 (&quot;Grupul 3 Vânătoare&quot;) and Esc. 41, 42 and 60 (&quot;Grupul 8 Vânătoare&quot;) received the new IAR 80A. &quot;Esc. 53&quot; also replaced its Hurricanes with the IAR 80A, while &quot;Grupul 6 Bopi&quot; (&quot;Bombardament în Picaj&quot; - Dive Bombing) re-equipped with the IAR 81.

In June 1942, the operational IAR fighter forces on the eastern front, combined into the &quot;Flotilla 2 Vânătoare&quot; consisted of &quot;Grupul 8 Vânătoare&quot;, commanded by Cdr. Lt Col E. Pîrvulescu, and included &quot;Escadrila 41&quot;, &quot;Escadrila 42&quot; and &quot;Escadrila 60&quot; with 12 IAR 80As each. During the Battle of Stalingrad, on 12 September, the 8th Fighter Group&#x27;s IAR 80Bs (along with the 7th Fighter Group&#x27;s Bf 109s) claimed to have shot down seven Yaks but they lost two IARs.
&quot;Grupul 8&quot; moved at the end of September, to Karpovka, joining &quot;Grupul 7&quot;, equipped with Bf 109s. On 12 and 13 December, &quot;Grupul 6&quot; used its IAR 81s to support the German counterattack by the Panzergruppe Hoth of the Heeresgruppe Don, from Kotelnikovo towards Stalingrad. 

In the summer of 1943 the ARR&#x27;s IAR 80s were transferred to Romania for air defense duties, where they were used in combat against the United States Air Force. USAAF attacks were directed at the oil refineries installation around Ploiești, in particular. On 1 August 1943 the IAR 80 faced the Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bomber for the first time. There were 178 B-24s from 9th USAAF, part of Operation Tidal Wave. The IAR 80Bs of &quot;Escadrila 61&quot; and 62 of &quot;Grupul 6 Vânătoare&quot;, as well as IAR 80Cs from the newly formed &quot;Escadrila 45&quot; of &quot;Grupul 4 Vânătoare&quot;, together with the Bf 109Gs from Esc. 53 and Bf 110s from the Romanian night fighter squadron, dived on the low-flying, four-engined bombers, belonging to five USAAF bomber groups (the 44th, 93rd, 98th, 376th and 389th). The Americans lost – in combat or on the way back – 51 bombers. Only 89 reached their bases, of which only 31 were serviceable for a mission the next day. The Romanian pilots claimed 25 certain and probable victories for just two losses, one IAR 80B and one Bf 110C. According to Romanian statistics, IARs and Messerschmitts were confirmed as having shot down ten B-24s, with two probables.

On 21 April 1944, IAR 81Cs of the 1st, 2nd, and 6th Fighter Groups took off to intercept B-17 and B-24 bombers which were targeting the Bucharest marshalling yard. While attacking the bombers, the Romanian fighters were engaged at high altitude by the escorting P-51 Mustangs of the 31st Fighter Group. In the aftermath of the air battle, the ARR lost 14 IAR 80s and 11 pilots were killed, while the Americans reported 10 aircraft lost.
On 10 June 1944, IAR 80s took part in a major air battle when the USAAF attacked Ploiești with 38 P-38 Lightnings of the 82nd Fighter Group carrying one bomb each, escorted by 39 Lightnings of the 1st and 82 FGs. The IAR 81Cs from &quot;Grupul&quot; 6, as well as the German fighters from I./JG 53 and 2./JG 77, intercepted the large American formation. Romanian pilot Dan Vizanty, commander of &quot;Grupul&quot; 6, recalled later: 

The USAAF lost 22 P-38s on that day, of which 9 were shot down by the IARs. The Romanians claimed 24 victories, suffering three losses. The Americans claimed 11 victories.

The American account of this battle conflicts significantly with the Romanian one. Fighter pilot Herbert &quot;Stub&quot; Hatch, who took part in the dogfight, wrote that his flight of 16 P-38s, the 71st Fighter Squadron, was challenged by a large formation of Romanian IAR 81C fighters that he misidentified as Focke-Wulf Fw 190s. According to Hatch, the fight took place at and below in a narrow valley. Hatch saw two IAR 81Cs hit the ground after taking fire from his guns, and his fellow pilots confirmed three more kills from his guns. Three of his victories were confirmed by gun camera, while the other two by his wingman, making Hatch an ace in a day. However, the outnumbered 71st Fighter Squadron lost nine aircraft. The Americans never again repeated the P-38 dive-bombing mission profile over Romania. But during 1944 USAAF aircraft appeared over Romania in more significant numbers. Many air combats occurred and by the time of their last encounter with the USAAF on 3 July 1944, pilots of &quot;Grupul 6 vânătoare&quot; had submitted 87 confirmed and ten unconfirmed claims. Casualties among the Romanian fighter pilots quickly mounted too. The three IAR 80/81 groups (the 1st, 2nd and 6th) in a period of less than four months – known as the &quot;American Campaign&quot; – had at least 32 IAR pilots killed in action, including 11 aces. These losses exceeded the number of casualties suffered in the previous two and a half years of fighting against the Soviets. Because of heavy losses, all IAR 80/81 units were withdrawn from combat against Americans in July 1944 and IAR pilots started to convert to the more modern Bf 109G-6s.

==Surviving aircraft==
After the Soviet occupation of Romania, all remaining IAR 80s were replaced with Soviet designs and scrapped. No complete original examples are known to survive. A static replica of the IAR 80 rebuilt post war after the fall of Communism and painted in its 1941–1944 original colors was shown at the Mihail Kogălniceanu airshow, near Constanța. The IAR 80 replica can be seen at the Romanian National Military Museum in Bucharest. Another IAR 80 static replica can be found at the National Aviation Museum at the defunct Pipera Airport in Bucharest, which was rebuilt from IAR 80DC two-seat trainer parts. As of 2017 few attempts have been initiated to produce an airworthy accurate replica of the IAR 80 based on existing factory documentation and recovered components. A flying IAR 80 is still to be seen. Since 2020, the Fly Again volunteer association is currently developing an airworthy replica of the IAR 80 which will be named IAR 80FA (Fly Again) and will carry the board number 451, where the original production left off.

==In fiction==
The IAR 80 appears in the historical fiction book &quot;Eighty Flights of a Not-So-Much-Of-A-Fighter-Pilot&quot; by Cătălin Pogaci.

<doc id="180160" wikidata="Q1708125" url="?curid=180160" title="Abortion in the Republic of Ireland">
<text>Public opinion on abortion has changed dramatically in Ireland. Abortion in Ireland is regulated by the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018. Abortion is permitted in Ireland during the first twelve weeks of pregnancy, and later in cases where the pregnant woman&#x27;s life or health is at risk, or in the cases of a fatal fetal abnormality. Abortion services commenced on 1 January 2019, following its legalisation by the aforementioned Act, which became law on 20 December 2018. Previously, the 8th Constitutional Amendment had given the life of the unborn fetus the same value as that of its mother, but the 36th constitutional amendment, approved by referendum in May 2018, replaced this with a clause permitting the Oireachtas (parliament) to legislate for the termination of pregnancies.

Abortion had been prohibited in Ireland by the UK Offences against the Person Act 1861. The Eighth Amendment was added to the Constitution by referendum in 1983, after concerns that laws prohibiting abortion could be found to be unconstitutional based on a right to privacy. In 1992, the Supreme Court held in the X Case that a thirteen-year-old girl who had become pregnant as a result of rape could be permitted to obtain an abortion in the state because there was a risk to her life from suicide. There were unsuccessful constitutional referendums in 1992 and 2002 that aimed to preclude such grounds for abortion in future cases. Between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2018, abortion in Ireland was regulated by the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013, under which abortion was illegal unless it occurred as the result of a medical intervention performed to save the life of the woman.

In 2012, Irish abortion law received worldwide attention on the death of Savita Halappanavar, who had been denied an abortion while suffering a septic miscarriage. This increased calls to repeal the Eighth Amendment. The constitutional and legislative provisions were discussed at a Citizens&#x27; Assembly in 2016–17, and at an Oireachtas committee in 2017, both of which recommended substantial reform and framed the debate of the referendum in May 2018.

==Current law==
===Constitutional provisions===

The current provision dates from the Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland, passed by referendum on 25 May 2018. For the previous constitutional provisions from 1983 to 2018, see the historical sections below.

===Legislation===

The Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 allows for a termination:
* under section 9, where there is a serious risk to the life of, or of serious harm to the health of, a pregnant woman, after examination by two medical practitioners;
* under section 10, in cases of emergency, where there is an immediate serious risk to the life of, or of serious harm to the health of a pregnant woman, after an examination by one medical practitioner;
* under section 11, where two medical practitioners are of the opinion formed in good faith that there is present a condition affecting the foetus that is likely to lead to the death of the foetus either before, or within 28 days of, birth; and
* under section 12, where there has been a certification that the pregnancy has not exceeded 12 weeks, and after a period of three days after this certification.

On commencement of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act, the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 was repealed. Sections 7 and 8 of the 2013 Act provide for legal termination of pregnancies in cases of a risk of loss of life from physical illness, whereas section 9 provides for legal termination of pregnancies in cases of a risk of loss of life from suicide. Sections 58 and 59 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 were repealed, and effectively superseded by the offence defined in section 22 of intentionally destroying unborn human life, punishable by fourteen years&#x27; imprisonment.

==Irish abortions==
===Legal abortions in Ireland===
Every year, the government publishes the number of notifications received of terminations performed under legislation. Those between 2014 and 2018 took place under the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013, with those taking place under the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 being published from 2019:

*The government received just 4,577 notifications for abortions performed under the 2018 Act, but acknowledged that &quot;the number of terminations of pregnancy notified to the Minister is substantially lower than the number of terminations carried out in 2021.&quot; The Department of Health estimated that 6,700 abortions under the 2018 Act were obtained in 2021, according reimbursements paid by the HSE. The disparity was blamed on Covid-19 and the HSE cyber attack.

===Abortion pills===
Between 2010 and 2012, 1,642 women ordered abortion pills over the Internet from Women on Web, and had an abortion at home, in Ireland. The pills were illegal in Ireland, and Customs occasionally seized shipments.

===Travelling for an abortion===
Estimates as to the number of Irish women seeking abortions in Britain vary. Since the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment (Travel) in 1992, the right to travel for an abortion has had constitutional protection. In 2016, 3,265 Irish women were recorded as having had abortions in Great Britain. In some cases, women travelling do so with the assistance of the Abortion Support Network.

In 1980, Marian Finucane won the Prix Italia for a documentary on abortion; she interviewed a woman who was about to have an abortion, had travelled with her to England, been with her in the hospital and talked to her afterwards. In 2001, an estimated 7,000 women travelled abroad to obtain an abortion. Statistics showed that 4,149 Irish women had abortions in Britain in 2011. A study published in &quot;Social &amp; Legal Studies&quot; found that in 2014 a total of 5,521 women gave Irish addresses to English and Welsh clinics that provided abortion services. In years leading up to 2018, some Irish women had abortions in the Netherlands.

The issue of travelling to the UK for an abortion was relevant for many Irish abortion cases, such as the X Case in 1992, C Case in 1997 and the case of Miss D in 2007, as well as in the cases of fatal foetal abnormalities. In response to the UNHRC decision in &quot;Mellet v Ireland&quot; (2016), the government gave Amanda Mellet €30,000 compensation, partially for being forced to travel.

==History of abortion in Ireland==
===Offences against the Person Act 1861===
Under sections 58 and 59 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861, as amended by the Statute Law Revision Act 1892 and Statute Law Revision (No. 2) Act 1893, procuring a miscarriage was a criminal offence subject to penal servitude for life.
These provisions enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom remained in force in Irish law until they were repealed by the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013.

===Early twentieth century===

Fears were expressed by politicians in 1929 of an increase in criminal abortions and infanticide following the passing of the Criminal Law Amendment Act which prohibited all appliances and substances for contraception; no exceptions whatsoever were made. Over 100 Irish women were dying annually from unsafe backstreet abortions in the 1930s.

The English case of &quot;R v. Bourne&quot; (1938), which allowed the distress of a pregnant girl as a defence in a prosecution against a doctor for the termination of a pregnancy, led to an increase in abortion in Britain, and thereafter, of Irish women travelling to obtain abortions. There were no prosecutions in Ireland for illegal abortions between 1938 and 1942 but as a result of travel restrictions imposed during the war years, there were 25 cases prosecuted between 1942 and 1946. During the late 1930s and early 1940s, up to 400 terminations (both legal and illegal) were performed daily in England and Wales, and given the high emigration rates it is likely that there was widespread knowledge of the possibility of obtaining backstreet abortions in England by Irish people. &quot;The Bell&quot; magazine in 1941 said that some young women from well-off backgrounds were &quot;hustled off, normally to London, Paris, Biarritz, comes back without the baby and nobody is any the wiser&quot; After the war the level of prosecutions decreased, though this only relates to abortions that went wrong or were found out. Those found guilty were dealt with severely by the courts, receiving long sentences of penal servitude, with one chemist with an extensive abortion practice in Merrion Square, Dublin in 1944 receiving a 15-year sentence that was reduced to 7 years on appeal. The Garda Commissioner&#x27;s first annual report on crime published in 1947 made reference to the number of abortions that were performed illegally. In the 1950s novels, autobiographies and works of non-fiction (including medical texts) that promoted or even described abortion were banned. There were extremely few prosecutions for performing illegal abortion between 1952 and 1963, but one of Ireland&#x27;s best-known abortion providers, Mamie Cadden, was sentenced to death by hanging in 1957 – this was later commuted to life imprisonment – when one of her patients died.

The Abortion Act 1967 in Great Britain made access to the treatment easier for Irish women and the instance of infanticide, which was prevalent, began to decline sharply. In 1974 Noël Browne became the first member of the Oireachtas to propose the provision of therapeutic abortion services during a contribution to a Seanad debate. In 1981 future President of Ireland, Mary McAleese, chaired a meeting at Liberty Hall that advocated a woman&#x27;s right to choose. She later claimed that she misunderstood the nature of the meeting. McAleese had previously said that &quot;I would see the failure to provide abortion as a human rights issue&quot;, but also that she did not feel &quot;that the way to cope with it is through introducing abortion legislation&quot; into Ireland. A number of controversies have arisen following deaths of pregnant women who were prevented from receiving medical care because of their pregnancy, such as Sheila Hodgers in 1983. Sheila Hodgers was a woman from Dundalk, County Louth, who in 1983 died of multiple cancers two days after giving birth to her third child, who died at birth. It is alleged that she was denied treatments for her cancer while pregnant because the hospital did not wish to harm the foetus because of its Catholic ethos.

===Eighth Amendment===
The Pro-Life Amendment Campaign was founded in 1981 to campaign against the possibility of a judicial ruling in Ireland that would allow abortion. Prior to the 1981 general election, PLAC lobbied the major Irish political parties – Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party – to urge the introduction of a Bill to allow the amendment to the constitution to prevent the Supreme Court interpreting the constitution as giving a right to abortion. The leaders of the three parties – respectively Charles Haughey, Garret FitzGerald and Frank Cluskey – agreed although there was little consultation with any of their parties&#x27; ordinary members. All three parties were in government over the following eighteen months but it was only in late 1982, just before the collapse of a Fianna Fáil minority government, that a proposed wording for the amendment was proposed. After the election, on the advice of Attorney General Peter Sutherland, the new government of Fine Gael and Labour proposed an alternative wording but there was not a majority in the Dáil for it, and the wording proposed by Fianna Fáil was accepted. This inserted the following subsection into the Constitution:
The Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland was put to a referendum on 7 September 1983 and was approved with 66.9% of the vote.

Protests took place in Ireland in the years leading up to 2018 to remove the eighth amendment. The government set an indicative timescale of early summer 2018 for a referendum on the section of the state&#x27;s constitution that ensures tight legal restrictions on terminations.

===Abortion information===
In the 1980s the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children challenged distribution of information relating to abortion services in Britain under the provisions of Article 40.3.3°. In proceedings which they initiated, which were later converted into the name of the Attorney General, &quot;AG (SPUC) v Open Door Counselling Ltd. and Dublin Wellwoman Centre Ltd.&quot; (1988), the High Court granted an injunction restraining two counselling agencies from assisting women to travel abroad to obtain abortions or informing them of the methods of communications with such clinics. &quot;SPUC v Grogan&quot; and &quot;SPUC v Coogan&quot; targeted students&#x27; unions, seeking to prohibit them from distributing information on abortion available in the UK.

In response to the success of this litigation, and prompted by the controversy on the X Case, a referendum was held in November 1992 on the Fourteenth Amendment, which passed. The Fourteenth Amendment specified that the prohibition of abortion would not limit the right to distribute information about abortion services in foreign countries. This was governed by the Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State For Termination of Pregnancies) Act 1995. This was referred to the Supreme Court by President Mary Robinson and found to be constitutional. This Act was repealed on the commencement of the 2018 Act.

===X Case and 1992 referendums===
In 1992, in the X Case, the Attorney General sought an injunction to prevent a thirteen-year-old girl who had been the victim of rape from obtaining an abortion in England, which was granted in the High Court by Justice Declan Costello. On appeal to the Supreme Court, this decision was reversed, on the grounds that the girl was suicidal, and that, therefore, it was permissible to intervene to save her life.

In November 1992, the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill was proposed, which would have removed a risk of self-destruction as grounds for an abortion, but was defeated in a referendum.

The Thirteenth Amendment was passed in November 1992 in response to the injunction sought by the Attorney General, ensuring that the protection of the unborn in the constitution could not be used to prohibit travel from the state to another state for an abortion.

The Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments together added the following paragraphs to Article 40.3.3°:
===C Case===
In August 1997 a 13-year-old girl was raped, and became pregnant. She was suicidal due to the pregnancy, and the High Court ruled in the C Case that the Eastern Health Board could arrange for her to travel to Britain for an abortion against the wishes of her parents.

The woman at the centre of the case has occasionally spoken about her experiences, but has not revealed her identity.

===2002 referendum===
In 1999, as part of constitutional review, the Ahern government produced a 179-page green paper summarising the then-current Irish abortion law and held an All-party Oireactas Committee on the Constitution. It held oral submissions in 2000, producing a &quot;Fifth Progress Report: Abortion&quot; in November 2000. Following this, a referendum was held on the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the Constitution Bill, which would have introduced legislation into the constitution to permit abortion in cases of a threat to the life of a woman, but not in cases where there was a risk of suicide. This proposal was narrowly defeated (50.4% – 49.6%).

===&quot;A, B and C v Ireland&quot;===
In 2005, two Irish women and a Lithuanian woman who had previously travelled to England for abortion brought suit in the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) asserting that restrictive and unclear Irish laws violate several provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The case, &quot;A, B and C v Ireland&quot;, was heard before the Grand Chamber of the Court on 9 December 2009 and was decided on 16 December 2010. The court ruled that the first two women&#x27;s rights were not violated by being forced to travel because Irish law was &quot;legitimately trying to protect public morals&quot;. The ECtHR also ruled that Irish law struck a fair balance between the women&#x27;s rights to respect of their private lives and the rights of the unborn, although it found that Ireland had violated the ECHR by failing to provide an accessible and effective procedure by which a woman can have established whether she qualifies for a legal abortion under current Irish law. This pertained to the case of the woman who identified as C. Since she did not receive accurate information about the risks of pregnancy associated with her prognosis, she believed that she did not qualify for legal abortion in Ireland and was forced to travel to England for the procedure. In this case, the court relied on doctrine that would deny the direct challenge to Ireland&#x27;s criminal law and this led to the reasoning that abortion is a moral issue. With the complex, lengthy and sensitive debate surrounding the issue, the Court made its ruling that state authorities were better suited than an international judge to balance the competing views and rights in abortion regulation. The Court&#x27;s decision is binding on Ireland and all of the member states of the Council of Europe.

A government-appointed Expert Group on Abortion released its findings on 13 November 2012, the day before news of the death of Savita Halappanavar broke, saying that Ireland was obliged to implement the court&#x27;s decision and recommending legislative and statutory reform. This led to the enactment of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act the following year.

===Death of Savita Halappanavar===
The death of Savita Halappanavar led to protests in 2012 calling for changes to Ireland&#x27;s abortion laws and a highly public investigation by the Health Service Executive. After a miscarriage had been diagnosed, she was denied an abortion because the foetus&#x27;s heart was still beating. She developed sepsis and died. The HSE enquiry found that her death was a result of inadequate assessment and monitoring and a failure to adhere to established clinical guidelines, and made several recommendations, including legislative and constitutional change.

===Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013===
The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 was proposed by Minister for Health James Reilly on behalf of the Fine Gael–Labour Party government. It passed the Dáil by 127 votes to 31. Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Sinn Féin had a party whip in favour of the legislation, and among those who opposed it were Fine Gael TDs Lucinda Creighton, Terence Flanagan, Peter Mathews, Billy Timmins, and Brian Walsh, and Sinn Féin TD Peadar Tóibín. Brian Walsh and Peadar Tóibín were both returned to the party whip within the same Dáil term.

Sections 7 and 8 provided for legal termination of pregnancies in cases of a risk of loss of life from physical illness, whereas section 9 provided for legal termination of pregnancies in cases of a risk of loss of life from suicide. Sections 58 and 59 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 were repealed, and effectively superseded by the offence defined in section 22:
Prior to this law, there was no standard to what conditions and situations would be considered to qualify for legal abortion in Ireland. This Act included a provision that allowed abortion only if there was a real and substantial risk to life, specifically pertaining to the life and health of the mother. Within this provision, the women seeking to qualify for legal abortion were examined by an obstetrician and a relevant specialist to decide if she qualified. In a case of a mother feeling suicidal or threatening to commit suicide, she was examined by three specialists and the agreement of their decision was required for her to obtain a legal abortion. If certification for a legal abortion was refused, a woman could appeal the decision and have her situation and conditions reviewed again.

President Michael D. Higgins convened the Council of State to consider the constitutionality of the Bill and a possible reference under Article 26 of the Constitution to the Supreme Court. The President decided against such a reference and signed the legislation into law on 30 July 2013.

In 2014, Ms Y, a young, suicidal refugee woman, was denied an abortion under the act. She went on hunger strike. The baby was eventually delivered by Caesarean section.

===Cases of fatal foetal abnormality===
In 2002, a woman pregnant with a foetus with fatal foetal abnormalities travelled to the UK for a termination. Her letter in &quot;The Irish Times&quot; was credited with playing a part in the defeat of the Twenty-fifth Amendment referendum. She later took a case against Ireland in the European Court of Human Rights, &quot;D v Ireland&quot;, which was ruled inadmissible. The State argued that the Constitution of Ireland might allow termination in cases of fatal foetal abnormalities. After the death of Savita Halappanavar, she gave up anonymity and spoke out.
In May 2007 a 17-year-old girl, known as &quot;Miss D&quot;, who was pregnant with a foetus suffering from anencephaly (the absence of a major portion of the brain, skull, and scalp; blind, deaf, unconscious, and unable to feel pain, a disorder which is invariably fatal), was prevented from travelling to Britain by the Health Service Executive. The High Court ruled on 9 May 2007 that she could not lawfully be prevented from travelling even though she was a ward of the state.

Amanda Mellet became pregnant in 2011; however, the foetus was suffering from Edwards syndrome, a fatal condition. She was unable to have an abortion in Ireland and had to travel to the UK. In 2016, she took a case to the United Nations Human Rights Committee, and in &quot;Mellet v Ireland&quot; it found that Ireland&#x27;s abortion law violated the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and called for the law&#x27;s reform. The Irish government paid her €30,000 in compensation.

In a case in 2010, the government of Ireland denied Siobhán Whelan an abortion despite being diagnosed with fatal foetal syndrome; she had to travel from Ireland to the UK to terminate her pregnancy. In June 2017, the United Nations Human Rights Committee ruled that Ireland&#x27;s abortion law violated Whelan&#x27;s human rights along with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, subjecting Whelan to a cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment, and called for legalisation of and access to safe abortions. The ruling was praised by the Center for Reproductive Rights.

Abortion is currently permitted under the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 where two medical practitioners are of the opinion formed in good faith that there is present a condition affecting the foetus that is likely to lead to the death of the foetus either before, or within 28 days of, birth.

===Repeal of the Eighth Amendment===
On 25 May 2018, the Irish people voted by 66.4% to 33.6% in a referendum to repeal the Eighth Amendment. They approved the Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018 to delete the current provisions of Article 40.3.3° and replace it with the following:
The government also outlined policies which would govern legislation to replace the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013.

A Citizens&#x27; Assembly had been established by the government in 2016 to consider a number of issues. After five meetings on the Eighth Amendment, it voted to amend the constitution to allow the Oireachtas to legislate for abortion. It also voted on the provisions it would support in this legislation. The Report of the Assembly was sent to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution. The Committee delivered its report in December 2017, and the report was debated in both Houses of the Oireachtas in January 2018.

The result of the referendum came after extensive social media campaigning coordinated the civil society organisation, Together For Yes. The influence of using social media as a voice of change reminded voters of how &#x27;local&#x27; the abortion issue was in Ireland, allowing women the right to be heard openly on national media. Another strength of the &#x27;feminist campaign&#x27; was the positioning of women from the private to the public sphere. By using social media to bring stories into the public, emotions were mobilised as a form of &#x27;political resistance&#x27; to shed light on the potential damage a &#x27;No&#x27; vote could cause.

Ultimately, 39 of the 40 constituencies voted in favour of repealing the Eight Amendment. The national result was:
A second draft of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill was published by the Department of Health in July 2018.

=== Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 ===
The Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 defines the circumstances and processes within which abortion is legally performed in Ireland. It was signed by the President of Ireland on 20 December 2018, after being approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas, legalising abortion in Ireland. Abortion services commenced on 1 January 2019. This Act permits terminations to be carried out up to 12 weeks of pregnancy; or where there is a risk to the life, or of serious harm to the health, of the pregnant woman; or where there is a risk to the life, or of serious harm to the health, of the pregnant woman in an emergency; or where there is a condition present which is likely to lead to the death of the foetus either before or within 28 days of birth.

=== Mistaken cases of fatal foetal conditions ===
In March 2019, a woman in Dublin was told her baby was likely to have Edwards syndrome, considered a fatal foetal condition, following a positive non-invasive prenatal test (NIPT) and a positive chorionic villus sampling (CVS) diagnostic test, the mother opted for an amniocentesis, which did not show Edwards syndrome. She went on to give birth to a healthy baby without the condition.

In 2019, a woman attending the National Maternity Hospital was also given a diagnosis of Edwards syndrome. An abortion was carried out after 15 weeks. Following the abortion, genetic tests proved negative for Edwards syndrome, leaving the parents devastated and demanding an external investigation, which the hospital agreed to.

=== Pilots pressured into having abortions ===
According to the Irish Air Line Pilots&#x27; Association (IALPA), some female pilots of Irish registered airlines are under pressure to have an abortion if they become pregnant. The issue was highlighted as many Irish-registered airlines use pilots hired under self-employed contracts. Such pilots, as they are deemed to be self-employed, can lose out on work and pay if they become pregnant as they are not entitled to maternity leave.

=== GP abortion services ===
On 6 January 2019, it was reported that 200 GPs had registered to provide abortion services in Ireland. By the end of 2019, less than 15% of the GPs in Ireland had signed up to provide abortion services.

==Referendums==

;Note:
== Public opinion ==

Several polls have been taken on the subject:
* A 1997 &quot;Irish Times&quot;/MRBI poll found that 18% believed that abortion should never be permitted, 77% believed that it should be allowed in certain circumstances (this was broken down into: 35% that one should be allowed in the event that the woman&#x27;s life is threatened; 14% if her health is at risk; 28% that &quot;an abortion should be provided to those who need it&quot;) and 5% were undecided.
* A September 2004 Royal College of Surgeons survey for the Crisis Pregnancy Agency found that, in the under-45 age groups, 51% supported abortion on-demand, with 39% favouring the right to abortion in limited circumstances. Only 8% felt that abortion should not be permitted in any circumstances.
* A September 2005 &quot;Irish Examiner&quot;/Lansdowne poll found that 36% believe abortion should be legalised while 47% do not.
* A June 2007 TNS/MRBI poll found that 43% supported legal abortion if a woman believed it was in her best interest while 51% remained opposed. 82% favoured legalisation for cases when the woman&#x27;s life is in danger, 75% when the foetus cannot survive outside the womb, and 73% when the pregnancy has resulted from sexual abuse.
* A January 2010 &quot;Irish Examiner&quot;/RED C online poll found that 60% of 18- to 35-year-olds believe abortion should be legalised, and that 10% of this age group had been in a relationship where an abortion took place. The same survey also showed that 75% of women believed the morning-after pill should be an over-the-counter (OTC) drug, as opposed to a prescription drug.
* A September 2012 &quot;Sunday Times&quot;/Behaviour and Attitudes poll of 923 people showed that 80% of voters would support a change to the law to allow abortion where the life of the woman was at risk, with 16% opposed and 4% undecided.
*A November 2012 &quot;Sunday Business Post&quot;/RED C poll of 1,003 adults showed that 85% of voters would like the government to &quot;Legislate for the X Case, which means allowing abortion where the mother&#x27;s life is threatened, including by suicide&quot;, with 10% opposed and 5% undecided. The same poll also found that 82% of voters supported &quot;A constitutional amendment to extend the right to abortion to all cases where the health of the mother is seriously threatened and also in cases of rape&quot;, and 36% of voters supported &quot;A constitutional amendment to allow for legal abortion in any case where a woman requests it&quot;. In addition, 63% of voters also supported &quot;A constitutional amendment to limit the X Case, by excluding a threat of suicide as a grounds for abortion, but still allowing abortion, where the mother&#x27;s life is threatened outside of suicide&quot;.
*A January 2013 &quot;Paddy Power&quot;/RED C poll of 1,002 adults found that 29% of voters believed that there should be a constitutional amendment to allow abortion &quot;in any case where the woman requests it&quot;. 35% supported legislating for the X Case allowing for abortions where the life of the mother is at risk, including from suicide. 26% supported legislating for the X Case but excluding suicide and 8% believed no legislation at all was necessary.
*A January 2013 &quot;Sunday Times&quot;/Behaviour and Attitudes poll of 916 voters found that 87% would support legislation to provide abortion where the woman&#x27;s life was in danger for reasons other than threat of suicide, 80% would support legislation to provide abortion where there was a foetal abnormality meaning the baby could not survive outside of the womb, 74% would support legislation to provide abortion where the pregnancy was a result of rape, and 59% would support legislation to provide abortion where the woman displayed suicidal feelings. Overall, 92% supported allowing abortion in one of these four circumstances, while 51% supported allowing abortion in all four circumstances.
* A February 2013 &quot;Irish Times&quot;/Ipsos MRBI poll of 1,000 voters in face-to-face interviews in all constituencies found that 84% felt that abortion should be allowed when the woman&#x27;s life is at risk, 79% felt that abortion should be allowed whenever the foetus cannot survive outside the womb, 78% felt that abortion should be allowed in cases of rape or incest, 71% felt that abortion should be allowed where the woman is suicidal as a result of the pregnancy (the X Case result), 70% felt that abortion should be allowed when the woman&#x27;s health is at risk, and 37% felt that abortion should be provided when a woman deems it to be in her best interest.
* A June 2013 &quot;Irish Times&quot;/Ipsos MRBI poll of 1,000 voters in face-to-face interviews in all constituencies found that 75% were in favour of the government&#x27;s proposed legislation (the &quot;Protection of Life during Pregnancy Bill 2013&quot;), with 14% opposed and 11% choosing &quot;Don&#x27;t know&quot;. Furthermore, 89% felt that abortion should be allowed when the woman&#x27;s life is at risk, 83% felt that abortion should be allowed whenever the foetus cannot survive outside the womb, 81% felt that abortion should be allowed in cases of rape or abuse, 78% felt that abortion should be allowed when the woman&#x27;s health is at risk, 52% felt that abortion should be allowed where the woman is suicidal as a result of the pregnancy, and 39% felt that abortion should be provided when a woman deems it to be in her best interest.
* A September 2014 &quot;Sunday Independent&quot;/Millward Brown poll found that 56% of voters were in favour of holding a referendum to repeal the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution, with 19% against and 25% undecided. In addition, 60% of voters were in favour of allowing abortion where there is a threat of the woman&#x27;s suicide, 69% when the pregnancy arose as the result of rape, 72% when there is a risk to the woman&#x27;s life (other than suicide) and 68% where there is a threat to the woman&#x27;s long-term health. When it comes to allowing abortion &quot;for other reasons&quot;, 34% are in favour, 38% opposed and 20% saying &quot;it depends&quot;.
* A January 2016 Newstalk/RED C poll found that 78% of voters were in favour of allowing abortion in cases when the pregnancy arose as the result of rape or incest, 76% when there is a fatal foetal abnormality, 61% when there is a significant foetal disability or non-fatal foetal abnormality, 59% when the pregnant woman has suicidal feelings as a result of the pregnancy and 41% in any circumstances felt necessary by the pregnant woman. However, when asked if the Eighth Amendment should be removed from the constitution, only 48% said it should and 41% were opposed to removing it.
* An October 2016 &quot;Irish Times&quot;/Ipsos MRBI poll found that, regarding the Eighth Amendment, 18% said it should not be repealed; 55% said it should be repealed to allow for limited access to abortion in the cases of rape and fatal foetal abnormality; 19% said it should be repealed to allow for abortion in all cases requested, and 8% had no opinion. Support for a more liberal regime was strongest in Dublin and among younger people.
* An April 2017 Claire Byrne Live/Amárach Research Panel poll asked 1,000 adults &quot;Do you agree with the Citizens&#x27; Assembly that abortion, with no restrictions as to reasons, should be made available in Ireland?&quot; 50% said yes, 33% said no and 17% said that they didn&#x27;t know.
* A May 2017 poll conducted by Ipsos MRBI found 76% of those asked were in favor of allowing abortion in cases of rape.

<doc id="180162" wikidata="Q3041327" url="?curid=180162" title="Religion and abortion">
<text>Numerous religious traditions have taken a stance on abortion but few are absolute. These stances span a broad spectrum, based on numerous teachings, deities, or religious print, and some of those views are highlighted below.

People of all faiths and religions use reproductive health care services. Abortion is perceived as murder by many religious conservatives.&lt;ref name=10.1177/0959353516685345&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-abortion advocates believe that legalized abortion is a threat to social, moral, and religious values. Religious people who advocate abortion rights generally believe that life starts later in the pregnancy, for instance at quickening, after the first trimester.

The religious influence over the population of the country tends to be one of the massive determining factors on the legality of abortion.

==Baháʼí Faith==
Abortion, merely for the purpose of eliminating an unwanted child, is strongly deprecated in the Baháʼí Faith, although medical reasons may warrant it. Among the possible reasons for terminating a pregnancy are rape, incest, lack of viability of the fetus, and health of the mother. Though Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Bahá’í Faith, considered the intentional termination of a pregnancy as the ending of a life, there are no specific teachings in the Bahá’í sacred texts addressing it; the Universal House of Justice has thus concluded that it is not quite the same as murder and therefore within the purview of the Universal House of Justice to legislate on it, at a future date, if it so decides. At present, Baháʼís are encouraged to decide based on their own conscience in light of general guidance found in Baháʼí writings and medical advice.

==Buddhism==

There is no single Buddhist view concerning abortion. Some traditional sources, including some Buddhist monastic codes, hold that life begins at conception, and that abortion, which would then involve the deliberate destruction of life, should be rejected. Complicating the issue is the Buddhist belief that &quot;life is a continuum with no discernible starting point&quot;. Among Buddhists, there is no official or preferred viewpoint regarding abortion.

The Dalai Lama has said that abortion is &quot;negative&quot;, but there are exceptions. He said, &quot;I think abortion should be approved or disapproved according to each circumstance.&quot;

Inducing or otherwise causing an abortion is regarded as a serious matter in the monastic rules followed by both Theravada and Vajrayana monks; monks and nuns must be expelled for assisting a woman in procuring an abortion. Traditional sources do not recognize a distinction between early- and late-term abortion, but in Sri Lanka and Thailand the &quot;moral stigma&quot; associated with an abortion grows with the development of the foetus. While traditional sources do not seem to be aware of the possibility of abortion as relevant to the health of the mother, modern Buddhist teachers from many traditions – and abortion laws in many Buddhist countries – recognize a threat to the life or physical health of the mother as an acceptable justification for abortion as a practical matter, though it may still be seen as a deed with negative moral or karmic consequences.

== Christianity ==

There is scholarly disagreement on how early Christians felt about abortion and whether explicit prohibitions of abortion exist in either the Old Testament or New Testament books of the Christian Bible. Abortion is not specifically mentioned anywhere in the Bible, nor is there any specific commandment against it. Some scholars have concluded that early Christians took a nuanced stance on what is now called abortion and that at different times, and in separate places, early Christians have taken different stances. Other scholars have concluded that early Christians considered abortion a sin at all stages; although there is disagreement over their thoughts on what type of sin it was, and how grave a sin it was held to be, it was seen as at least as grave as sexual immorality. Some early Christians believed that the embryo did not have a soul from conception, and consequently, opinion was divided as to whether or not early abortion was murder or ethically equivalent to murder.

Early church councils punished women for abortions that were combined with other sexual crimes, as well as makers of abortifacient drugs, but, like some early Church Fathers such as Basil of Caesarea, did not make a distinction between &quot;formed&quot; and &quot;unformed&quot; foetuses. While Gregory of Nyssa and Maximus the Confessor held that human life already began at conception, Augustine of Hippo affirmed Aristotle&#x27;s concepts of ensoulment occurring some time after conception, after which point abortion was to be considered a homicide, while still maintaining the condemnation of abortion at any time from conception onward. Aquinas reiterated Aristotle&#x27;s views of successive souls: vegetative, animal, and rational. This would be the Catholic Church&#x27;s position until 1869, when the limitation of automatic excommunication to abortion of a &quot;formed&quot; foetus was removed, a change that has been interpreted as an implicit declaration that conception was the moment of ensoulment. Most early penitentials imposed equal penances for abortion whether early-term or late-term, but later penitentials in the Middle Ages normally distinguished between the two, imposing heavier penances for late-term abortions and a less severe penance was imposed for the sin of abortion &quot;before [the foetus] has life&quot;.

Contemporary Christian denominations have nuanced positions, thoughts, and teachings about abortion, especially in extenuating circumstances. The Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodoxy, and most Evangelical Protestants oppose deliberate abortion as immoral while allowing what is sometimes called indirect abortion, namely, an action that does not seek the death of the foetus as an end or a means, but that is followed by the death as a side effect. Evangelical Protestants have some of the most opposed views on the topic of abortion, especially compared to those of traditional religions. More specifically, the religious philosophy of both the Catholic Church and many Evangelical Christians denominations is that life begins at conception, and both groups have strong moral prohibitions against abortion, equating it to murder. These two denominations are the primary participators in interest advocacy groups and are strongly associated with anti-abortion activities. This group behavior can include lobbying, activism, protesting, as well as education and campaign contributions. However, states with a higher percentage of Catholics or a higher percentage of the population classified as fundamentalist or conservative Protestant are not more likely to have abortion restrictions in their state legislature. States or countries with a higher Catholic or Evangelical Christian presence than other denominations have more resources and votes in favor of restrictive abortion laws as well as influence over legislators&#x27; perception on the issue of abortion. 

Some mainline Protestant denominations such as the Methodist Church, Episcopal Church (United States), United Church of Christ, Presbyterian Church (USA), and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America, among others, are more permissive of abortion. More generally, some Christian denominations can be considered anti-abortion, while others may favor abortion rights. Additionally, there are sizable minorities in some denominations that disagree with their denomination&#x27;s stance on abortion. A national sample of American abortion patients found that the majority identified as Protestant.

The more religiously devote and those with more religious engagement tend to hold stronger opinions overall, especially on the abortion debate in regard to religions take on abortion&#x27;s morality. An individual&#x27;s religious conservatism has a higher likelihood to oppose abortion. However, members of a denomination can have deviating opinions from vocal religious leaders&#x27; beliefs.

==Hinduism==

Most classical Hindu texts strongly condemn abortion, although the Sushruta Samhita recommends it if the fetus is defective. The British Broadcasting Corporation writes, &quot;When considering abortion, the Hindu way is to choose the action that will do least harm to all involved: the mother and father, the foetus and society.&quot; The BBC goes on to state, &quot;In practice, however, abortion is practiced in India, because the religious ban on abortion is sometimes overruled by the cultural preference for sons. This can lead to abortion to prevent the birth of girl babies, which is called &#x27;female foeticide&#x27;.&quot; Hindu scholars and women&#x27;s rights advocates have supported bans on sex-selective abortions. Some Hindus support abortion in cases where the mother&#x27;s life is at imminent risk or when the foetus has a life-threatening developmental anomaly.

Some Hindu theologians and Brahma Kumaris believe personhood begins at three months and develops through to five months of gestation, possibly implying permitting abortion up to the third month and considering any abortion past the third month to be destruction of the soul&#x27;s current incarnate body.

==Islam==

The Quran and Hadith describe God&#x27;s creation of man in the womb and condemn infanticide. A verse in the Quran refers to pregnant women who abort their pregnancies upon the day of judgment. Each of the four Sunni Islam schools of thought—Hanafi, Shafi‘i, Hanbali and Maliki— have their own reservations on if and when abortions are permissible in Islam. The Maliki madhhab holds &quot;that the fetus is ensouled at the moment of conception&quot; and thus &quot;most Malikis do not permit abortion at any point, seeing God&#x27;s hand as actively forming the fetus at every stage of development.&quot; On the other hand, some Hanafi scholars believe that abortion before the hundred twenty day period is over is permitted, though some Hanafi scholars teach that an abortion within 120 days is &quot;makruh&quot; (disapproved, i.e. discouraged). The other Islamic schools of thought agree abortion is recommended when the mother&#x27;s life is in danger, because the mother&#x27;s life is paramount. 

Muslim scholars differ as to when fetus is given a soul: some say 40 days after conception, while others say 120 days. Nevertheless Muslim scholars also assert an embryo&#x27;s right to be respected starting at conception, even if it is not yet regarded as human life. Before 120 days some scholars permit abortion in cases of &quot;great&quot; fetal deformity. Mauritania prohibits abortion under any circumstance. In Shia Islam, abortion is &quot;forbidden after implantation of the fertilised ovum.&quot; The leader of the Iranian Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Khomeini declared that shari&#x27;a forbids abortion 
without any reason &quot;even at the earliest possible stage&quot;. Iranian Ayatollah Ali Khamenei permitted abortion at 10 weeks in cases of thalassemia. Abortion before 120 days was allowed in cases of rape during the Bosnian war.

After 120 days the fetus is believed to be human life, yet it is still permissible to abort it to save the life of the mother. This is because a fetus will die anyway if the mother dies, and the mother is part of a family and she has responsibilities.

== Judaism ==

Orthodox Jewish teaching allows abortion if necessary to safeguard the life of the pregnant woman. While the Reform, Reconstructionist, and Conservative movements openly advocate for the right to a safe and accessible abortion, the Orthodox movement is less unified on the issue. Many Orthodox Jews oppose abortion, except when it is necessary to save a woman&#x27;s life (or, according to some, the woman&#x27;s health).

In Judaism, views on abortion draw primarily upon the legal and ethical teachings of the Hebrew Bible, the Talmud, the case-by-case decisions of responsa, and other rabbinic literature. Generally speaking, Orthodox Jews oppose abortion after the 40th day, with health-related exceptions, and reform Jews tend to allow greater latitude for abortion. There are rulings that often appear conflicting on the matter. The Talmud states that a foetus is not legally a person until it is delivered. The Torah contains the law that, &quot;When men fight, and one of them pushes a pregnant woman, and a miscarriage results, but no other misfortune, the one responsible shall be fined...but if other misfortune ensues, the penalty shall be life (nefesh) for life (nefesh).&quot; (). That is, causing a woman to miscarry is a crime, but not a capital crime, because the fetus is not considered a person.

Jeremiah 1:5 states that, &quot;Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you, before you were born, I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.&quot; For some, this verse, while talking specifically about Jeremiah, is an indication that God is aware of the identity of &quot;developing unborn human beings even before they enter the womb&quot;, or that for everyone, God has a plan that abortion might be seen as frustrating. Others say that this interpretation is incorrect, and that the verse is not related to personhood or abortion, as Jeremiah is asserting his prophetic status as distinct and special.

The Hebrew Bible has a few references to abortion; Exodus 21:22-25 addresses miscarriage by way of another&#x27;s actions, which it describes as a non-capital offense punishable through a fine. The Book of Numbers in the Hebrew Bible describes the Ordeal of the bitter water (&quot;sotah&quot;) to be administered by a priest to a wife whose husband thinks she was unfaithful. Some scholars interpret the text as involving an abortifacient potion or otherwise that induces a miscarriage if the woman is pregnant with another man&#x27;s child. Rabbinical scholar Arnold Ehrlich interprets the ordeal such that it ends either harmlessly if the woman is faithful, or with an induced abortion: &quot;the embryo falls&quot;.

==Sikhism==
The Sikh Sikh Rehat Maryada (code of conduct) does not deal directly with abortion. However, it does explicitly prohibit the practice of &#x27;kuri-mar&#x27;, a Punjabi term which literally means &quot;girl killing&quot; but also encompasses female foeticide.

The Guru Granth Sahib (primary scripture and source of Sikh religious guidance for Sikhs), does not provide any specific dictate on abortion. Many Sikhs will therefore interpret certain parts of texts and make a personal decision when confronted with a clearly abnormal fetus.

However, while there is no explicit prohibition in the Guru Granth Sahib or the Sikh Rehat Maryada, abortion is generally viewed by some Sikhs as forbidden because it is said to interfere with the creative work of God. Despite this theoretical viewpoint, abortion is not uncommon among the Sikh community in India, and there is growing concern that female foetuses are being aborted because of the cultural preference for sons.

==Unitarian Universalism==
The Unitarian Universalist Church strongly supports abortion rights. In 1978, the Unitarian Universalist Association passed a resolution that declared, &quot;...[the] right to choice on contraception and abortion are important aspects of the right of privacy, respect for human life, and freedom of conscience of women and their families&quot;. The Association had released earlier statements in 1963 and 1968 favoring the reform of restrictive abortion laws.

<doc id="180164" wikidata="Q2145610" url="?curid=180164" title="Snipe hunt">
<text>A snipe hunt is a type of practical joke or fool&#x27;s errand, in existence in North America as early as the 1840s, in which an unsuspecting newcomer is duped into trying to catch an elusive, nonexistent animal called a &quot;snipe&quot;. Although snipe are an actual family of birds, a &quot;snipe hunt&quot; is a quest for a creature whose description varies.

The target of the prank is led to an outdoor spot and given instructions for catching the snipe; these often include waiting in the dark and holding an empty bag or making noises to attract the creature. The others involved in the prank then leave the newcomer alone in the woods to discover the joke. As an American rite of passage, snipe hunting is often associated with summer camps and groups such as the Boy Scouts. In France, a similar joke is called &quot;hunting the dahut&quot;.

== In North America ==
Although snipe are a real family of birds, the &quot;snipe hunt&quot; is a practical joke, often associated with summer camps and other types of outdoor camping, in which the victim is tricked into engaging in a hunt for an imaginary creature.

Snipe hunters are typically led to an outdoor spot at night and given a bag or pillowcase along with instructions that can include either waiting quietly or making odd noises to attract the creatures. The other group members leave, promising to chase the snipe toward the newcomer; instead, they return home or to camp, leaving the victim of the prank alone in the dark to discover that they have been duped and left &quot;holding the bag&quot;.

The snipe hunt is a kind of fool&#x27;s errand or , meaning a fruitless errand or expedition, attested as early as the 1840s in the United States. It was the most common hazing ritual for boys in American summer camps during the early 20th century, and is a rite of passage often associated with groups such as the Boy Scouts. In camp life and children&#x27;s folklore, the snipe hunt provides an opportunity to make fun of newcomers while also accepting them into the group.

Setting the stage for the prank is often done with imaginative descriptions of the snipe, similar to tall tales. For instance, the snipe is said to resemble a cross between a jackrabbit and a squirrel; a squirrel-like bird with one red and one green eye; a small, black, furry bird-like animal that only comes out during a full moon, and so on. According to &quot;American Folklore: An Encyclopedia&quot;:

In another variation, a bag supposedly containing a captured snipe is theatrically brought to the campsite after a group hunt; the snipe quickly &quot;escapes&quot; unseen when the bag is opened.

== Variations ==

A similar practical joke in France is known as &quot;hunting the dahut&quot;. While the description of the prey differs from the North American snipe hunt, the nature of the joke is the same.

In Spain, a similar joke is called (&#x27;hunting gamusinos&#x27;). The is an imaginary animal with no defined description.

<text>Keisha Castle-Hughes (born 24 March 1990) is a New Zealand actress. She made her acting debut in the drama film &quot;Whale Rider&quot; (2002), for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress, making her the second-youngest nominee in such category. Her subsequent films include the biblical drama film &quot;The Nativity Story&quot; (2006) and the teen film &quot;Hey, Hey, It&#x27;s Esther Blueburger&quot; (2008).

==Early life==
Castle-Hughes was born in 1990 in Donnybrook, Western Australia to a Māori mother, Desrae Hughes, of Ngāti Porou, Tainui, and Ngāpuhi descent, and Tim Castle, an Anglo-Australian father. Her family moved to Auckland, New Zealand when she was four years old. She attained citizenship in 2001. Castle-Hughes attended Penrose High School and graduated from Senior College of New Zealand in Auckland.

==Career==
In 2002, Castle-Hughes made her debut in the film &quot;Whale Rider&quot;, in which she played the main role of Paikea Apirana (Pai). She had no previous acting experience and went directly from her Auckland school classroom to the film set when the shoot began in New Zealand in late 2001. Castle-Hughes received widespread critical acclaim for her performance, and in 2004 she received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress at the 76th Academy Awards. Although she did not win the Best Actress award (it went to Charlize Theron for &quot;Monster&quot;), at age 13 she became the youngest person nominated in this category at the time and the second Indigenous actress, after Merle Oberon and Jocelyne LaGarde, to be nominated for an Oscar.

She soon followed the role by appearing in Prince&#x27;s controversial &quot;Cinnamon Girl&quot; music video and with a shoot in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine. In 2004, Castle-Hughes was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

In 2005, Castle-Hughes had a small part as Queen Apailana in &quot;Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith&quot;. In 2006, she portrayed the starring role of the Virgin Mary in &quot;The Nativity Story&quot;. &quot;New York Times&quot; critic, A. O. Scott, said that she &quot;seemed entirely unfazed by the demands of playing Mary. She had the poise and intelligence to play the character not as an icon of maternity, but rather as a headstrong, thoughtful adolescent transformed by an unimaginable responsibility.&quot; The Christian-themed film earned only $8 million during its opening week, but its box office surged during the week of Christmas.

In 2008, Castle-Hughes appeared in the Australian comedy-drama film &quot;Hey, Hey, It&#x27;s Esther Blueburger&quot;, which was filmed in late 2006.

Castle-Hughes reunited with New Zealand director Niki Caro for the film adaption of &quot;The Vintner&#x27;s Luck&quot;, which had its international premiere in September 2009.

Castle-Hughes starred in the Japanese horror film &quot;Vampire&quot;, and she also played a recurring role as Axl&#x27;s flatmate in &quot;The Almighty Johnsons&quot; which premiered in 2011. In 2011 Castle-Hughes also played a minor part in the film &quot;Red Dog&quot; as Rosa the veterinary assistant and wife of Vanno.

In 2014, Castle-Hughes had a guest role in the American television series &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; in which she played Joan.

In 2015, she joined the cast of the HBO TV series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; in Season 5 as Obara Sand. She pursued a role on the show in part because she is a fan of the books. Castle-Hughes found out that she had won the role the night the Season 4 episode &quot;The Mountain and the Viper&quot; aired, in which her on-screen father&#x27;s death was shown. She described having a very intense emotional reaction to the scene, because of the connection between the characters on the show.

Beginning in 2020, Castle-Hughes has played Hana Gibson, an FBI analyst, on CBS&#x27;s &quot;&quot;.

In a return to the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, Castle-Hughes voiced Dr. Emerie Karr, an Imperial scientist at the Mount Tantiss facility and female clone of Jango Fett, in Seasons 2 and 3 of &quot;Star Wars: The Bad Batch&quot;.

==Activism==
Castle-Hughes campaigned for Greenpeace as part of the SignOn.org.nz climate campaign in 2009. New Zealand Prime Minister John Key initially admonished her to &quot;stick to acting&quot;, but offered a week later to discuss the issues with her over tea after she maintained she knew more about them than he gave her credit for.

==Personal life==
In October 2006, when she was 16, it was announced that Castle-Hughes and boyfriend Bradley Hull were expecting a child together. Their daughter was born in 2007. Castle-Hughes and Hull broke up in 2010 after seven years together.

In 2012, Castle-Hughes began dating Jonathan Morrison. After six weeks together, the couple became engaged in August 2012. Their wedding took place on Valentine&#x27;s Day 2013. They were divorced in December 2016.

In early 2014, Castle-Hughes revealed that she has bipolar disorder, in the wake of television personality Charlotte Dawson&#x27;s suicide.

In early 2021, she married Donny Grahamer in New York City. A month later she announced that she was pregnant with her second child, a daughter born in June.
