<text>The NLUUG (formerly known as The Netherlands Local Unix User Group) is an association of professional UNIX and Linux users in the Netherlands. The group aims to increase and extend the awareness and use of Open Standards (including UNIX) and similar open systems and Open Source software.

The NLUUG also maintains one of the largest FTP mirrors in the world, and is the prime FTP site for several packages including VIM.

==Activities==
Typically, the NLUUG organises two large conferences every year. Topics over the last years include:
* IP Communication
* Languages and Tools
* E-mail and Beyond
* Visualization in Software Engineering
* Open Source in Business
* Security
* Web Applications

==History==
The NLUUG was founded in 1983, but the initial members were active together a long time before that.

The NLUUG founded the first Internet provider in the Netherlands, NLnet. NLnet at the time only was serving businesses, which is why XS4All usually claims to be the first Internet provider (for consumers).

Other claims to fame are the founding of the SANE Conferences organization and the fact that the NLUUG was the first organisation to have Linus Torvalds be a speaker on a conference outside Finland.

==NLUUG Awards==
The NLUUG sometime gives awards to people who have been helping the cause of Open Systems and Open Standards. Over the years, awards have been given to amongst others Piet Beertema, Guido van Rossum, Wietse Venema, Bram Moolenaar, Andy Tanenbaum, Wytze van der Raay, Teus Hagen, Olaf Kolkman and Bert Hubert.

<text>Arlon (; ; ; ) is a city and municipality of Wallonia, and the capital of the province of Luxembourg in the Ardennes, Belgium. With a population of just over 28,000, it is the smallest provincial capital in Belgium. 
Arlon is also the capital of its cultural region: the Arelerland (Land of Arlon in Luxembourgish).

The municipality consists of the following sub-municipalities: Arlon proper, Autelbas, Bonnert, Guirsch, Heinsch, and Toernich. Other population centers include: Autelhaut, Clairefontaine, Fouches, Frassem, Freylange, Hachy, Heckbous, Rosenberg, Sampont, Schoppach, Sesselich, Seymerich, Stehnen, Sterpenich, Stockem, Udange, Viville, Waltzing, Weyler, and Wolberg.

==History==

===Origins===
Before the Roman conquests of Gaul, the territory of Arlon and a vast area to the southeast were settled by the Treveri, a Celtic tribe. The local population adapted relatively easily to Roman culture. The number and quality of sculpted stones and monuments that have been unearthed in the area demonstrate that the &quot;vicus&quot; of &quot;Orolaunum&quot; quickly became a commercial and administrative centre of Roman civilization. The Germanic invasions of the 3rd century destroyed most of these early advances, despite the defensive walls that had been built on the Knipchen hill to protect the &quot;vicus&quot;.

===Middle Ages===
During most of the Middle Ages, the population still used the earlier buildings such as the &quot;thermae&quot;. In 1060, Waleran I of Limburg, Count of Arlon, built a castle on the Knipchen hill in the centre of the town.

A dynasty of counts of Arlon began with Waleran I, Duke of Limburg. On the death of Duke Waleran III in 1226, Arlon passed to his son from the second marriage, Henry V the Fair, Count of Luxembourg, and became part of the county of Luxembourg. Thus, in the Tournament of Chauvency, his son Henry the Lion bore the title of Marquis of Arlon.

In the 13th century, the only women&#x27;s Cistercian abbey known to date was built in Clairefontaine.

===15th–18th centuries===

The Duchy of Luxembourg itself, of which Arlon was dependent, became part of the Burgundian Netherlands under Philip the Good in 1441. After Charles V&#x27;s abdication of his empire to his son Philip II of Spain in 1556, a troubled period started for the whole region with continuous wars involving France, Spain and the Southern Netherlands. In 1558, nearly half of the city, including its castle, was destroyed by the French troops of Francis, Duke of Guise.

In the 17th century, Capuchin friars built a convent on the ruins of the castle and the French strengthened the defensive walls according to Vauban&#x27;s designs. An accidental fire destroyed a large part of the city again in 1785.

On 9 June 1793 the French Revolutionary troops opposed the Austrians just outside Arlon. The French emerged victorious and took over the city from Austrian rule. They expelled the Capuchin friars and used their convent as a hospital.

===19th and 20th centuries===
In June 1815, after the defeat of Napoleon in the Battle of Waterloo, Arlon went back to government of the Grand Duchy. By the Treaty of London in 1839, the Grand Duchy became fully sovereign and in turn geographically larger western part of the duchy, i.e. the province de Luxembourg including Arlon city was given to newly created Kingdom of Belgium.

Arlon was one of the first victims of the German invasion in 1914 as 121 inhabitants were executed on 26 August, on the orders of Colonel Richard Karl von Tessmar.

Its territory was again among the first to be invaded at the onset of World War II. Allies moved into Belgium on 10 May 1940 and Arlon was defended by French troops, but they were not able to stop the German invasion.

===Arlon today===
Being situated very close to the border with the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Arlon has continued to expand with new residential areas and commercial development zones, and many people cross the border everyday to work in the Grand Duchy. All international express trains make a stop in Arlon, as it is the last station on the main Brussels—Luxembourg City railway line.

<text>Aubange (; ; ; ) is a municipality and city of Wallonia located in the province of Luxembourg, Belgium.

On 1 January 2012 the municipality, which covers 45.6 km2, had 16,042 inhabitants, giving a population density of 330.9 inhabitants per km2. It is the third municipality of the Province of Luxembourg regarding the number of inhabitants but it is also among the smallest ones in terms of area.

The municipality is French-speaking but most of which falls within the Luxembourgish-speaking Arelerland, adjoins the tripoint where the borders of Belgium, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, and France meet.

The municipality consists of the following districts: Athus, Aubange, Halanzy, and Rachecourt.

== History ==

The district of Aubange was a municipality itself before the reorganization of the Belgian municipalities in 1977. Even though the new municipality took the name &quot;Aubange&quot;, the biggest place is Athus and it is where most of the services and official buildings are, like the townhall, the police station, the fire station, the post office, etc.

== Geography ==
Aubange is located in the Lorraine region in the south of Belgium just next to France and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.

=== Subdivisions ===

The municipality consists of the following sub-municipalities: Aubange proper, Athus, Halanzy, and Rachecourt.

Other population centers include: Aix-sur-Cloie, Battincourt, and Guerlange.

== Population ==
The following graph represents the growing of the population in the municipality since 1990. The village of Aubange itself contains about 4,000 inhabitants.

== Economy ==

For a long time, Aubange has been linked with siderurgy. There were two big factories in Athus and in Halanzy and also a mine. But because of the concurrence of the foreign markets (especially the ones from Asia and Africa), siderurgy as not profitable anymore and all the factories closed one after another in the whole area.

Now the politics have tried to found new ways to develop the economy. One of the most well-known activities is the Railway Containers Terminal of Athus which deals with thousands of containers each year from the big harbors of the North Sea like Antwerp and Rotterdam to the inland of France, Germany or Luxembourg.

== Transports ==

Aubange has a short highway: the A28/E411 with two exits: 4 Aubange and 3 Athus. The A28 continues north as the N81 towards Arlon and eventually Brussels. Going south it ends at the French border and continues in France as the N52 towards Longwy and Thionville. Besides the highway, Aubange is also crossed by the major N88 road from the Luxembourg border near Pétange, via Athus, Aubange proper and Halanzy towards Virton and Florenville.

<text>Martelange (; ; ; ) is a municipality of Wallonia located in the province of Luxembourg, Belgium.

On 1 January 2007 the municipality, which covers 29.67 km2, had 1,584 inhabitants, giving a population density of 53.4 inhabitants per km2. Besides Martelange itself, the municipality includes the villages of Grumelange and Radelange.

For some , the N4 Brussels to Arlon road, which passes through the village, forms the border with the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Because fuel, tobacco, and alcohol taxes are lower in Luxembourg than in Belgium, the eastern, Luxembourgish side of this stretch of road has become lined with numerous petrol stations and liquor stores.

==History==
Between 1830 and 1947, the town was a major slate quarrying centre, though the industry has now completely disappeared.

On August 21, 1967, a French tanker lorry containing 45 000 litres of Liquefied petroleum gas suffered from failing brakes while driving downhill. It exploded in the middle of the village, killing 22 people and injuring 54. Dozens of houses were completely destroyed.

<text>International Child Care Fund Holland (ICCF Holland) is a small non-governmental organization that supports a project in Kibaale, a small town in the south of Uganda. The project aims at helping AIDS victims.

==Organization==
In this poor area of Africa, many adults are infected with HIV. When they die, the children are left behind. At the project they receive the support they need. Education is provided at the school (nursery, primary, secondary, vocational). A clinic provides the only affordable medical help in the area.

Stichting ICCF Holland is registered in Venlo, the Netherlands. All the work is done by volunteers, which makes it possible to send 99% of the donated money to the project. Donors may sponsor a child or make a one-time donation.

Bram Moolenaar, author of the text editor Vim, founded ICCF Holland and served as its treasurer until his death in 2023. Vim is free software, released under a charityware license that encourage users to contribute to ICCF and help children in Uganda. A message to this effect appears every time Vim is started without a file.

<doc id="176186" wikidata="Q34021" url="?curid=176186" title="Bastogne">
<text>Bastogne (; ; ; ) is a city and municipality of Wallonia located in the province of Luxembourg in the Ardennes, Belgium. 

The municipality consists of the following districts: Bastogne, Longvilly, Noville, Villers-la-Bonne-Eau, and Wardin. The town is situated on a ridge in the Ardennes at an elevation of .

On 2 December 2024, it merged with Bertogne into a new municipality.

==History==
At the time of the Roman conquest the region of Bastogne was inhabited by the Treveri, a tribe of Gauls. A form of the name Bastogne was first mentioned only much later, in 634, when the local lord ceded these territories to the St Maximin&#x27;s Abbey, near Trier. A century later, the Bastogne area went to the nearby Prüm Abbey. The town of Bastogne and its marketplace are again mentioned in an 887 document. By the 13th century, Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor and count of Luxemburg, was minting coins in Bastogne. In 1332, John the Blind, his son, granted the city its charter and had it encircled by defensive walls, part of which, the current &quot;Porte de Trèves&quot;, still exists. In 1451, the lands of the county of Luxemburg were absorbed into the Duchy of Burgundy and as a result, Bastogne became part of the lands of the Spanish Crown when the Burgundian heir Charles became king of Spain in 1516.

The city&#x27;s walls were quite effective at protecting it during the troubled times that followed. The city&#x27;s economy actually flourished thanks to the renown of its agricultural and cattle fairs. In 1602, the walls successfully repelled an attack by forces of the Dutch Republic. In 1688, they were dismantled by order of King Louis XIV when the town was occupied by French forces during the Nine Years War.

The 19th century and Belgium&#x27;s independence were favourable to Bastogne, as its forest products and cattle fairs became better known abroad. Several railway lines were built to link it to the neighbouring towns. This all came to an end with the German occupation during World War I.

===World War II===

Liberated by the Allies on 10 September 1944, Bastogne was attacked by German forces a few months later. Hitler&#x27;s plan was to regain control of the Ardennes, splitting British from American forces, then advance to and reoccupy the strategic port of Antwerp and cut off the key Allied supply line. The Battle of the Bulge began on 16 December, when German artillery, taking advantage of cold and fog, attacked the American divisions deployed sparsely around Bastogne. A few days later, Brigadier General Anthony McAuliffe and the 101st Airborne Division along with elements of the 10th Armored Division and the 82nd Airborne Division, arrived to counter-attack but, after heavy fighting, became encircled within the town. On 22 December, German emissaries asked for the American surrender; McAuliffe answered tersely, “Nuts!” The next day the skies cleared, allowing Allied air forces to retaliate and to drop much-needed food, medicine, and weapons to ground forces. On 26 December, the Third U.S. Army, under the command of General George S. Patton, arrived and broke the siege. The official end of the Battle of Bastogne occurred three weeks later, when all fighting in the area ceased.

Bastogne is the terminus of the Liberty Road, the commemorative way that marks the path of liberating Allied forces, and of the Third Army that subsequently relieved Bastogne.

== Geography ==
Bastogne is located in the Belgian Ardennes, in the east of the province of Luxembourg. The city is away from the Luxembourg border. Its altitude is high on the ridge line separating the catchment areas of the Rhine and Meuse. It is the 9th largest municipality in Belgium and the third largest in the province (after Libramont-Chevigny and Léglise). In terms of population, it is the 4th largest municipality in the province after Arlon, Marche-en-Famenne and Aubange.

The 50th degree of north latitude crosses the city.

The municipality of Bastogne comprises five sections (Bastogne proper, Longvilly, Noville, Villers-la-Bonne-Eau, and Wardin) which were separate municipalities before the 1977 merger of municipalities. Each contains a number of villages.

* Bastogne: Bizory, Chifontaine, Hemroulle, Isle-la-Hesse, Isle-le-Pré, Savy, Senonchamps ;
* Longvilly: Al-Hez, Arloncourt, Bourcy, Horritine, Michamps, Moinet, Oubourcy ;
* Noville: Cobru, Fagnoux, Foy, Hardigny, Luzery, Rachamps, Recogne, Vaux, Wicourt ;
* Villers-la-Bonne-Eau: Livarchamps, Losange, Lutrebois, Lutremange, Remoifosse ;
* Wardin: Benonchamps, Bras, Harzy, Mageret, Marenwez, Marvie, Mont, Neffe.

== Climate ==
Bastogne has an oceanic climate similar to the remainder of Belgium, but with more continental influences due to it being inland and elevated in comparison to lowland areas nearer the Atlantic. In spite of this the winters are heavily moderated for its latitude and although snowfall and frosts are common, means remain just above freezing.

==Sights==


*The 101st Airborne Museum includes dioramas and more about the experiences of soldiers and civilians during the siege of the city during World War II. 
*The Bastogne Barracks museum is free and operated by the Belgian Army. It is located in the barracks used as the headquarters of the U.S. 101st Airborne during the Siege of Bastogne. It features an extensive collection of restored tanks and military vehicles as well as a guided tour of the underground barracks and artifacts from U.S., German and British forces. The base (&quot;caserne&quot;) is about 5 blocks from the Place de St. Pierre. The museum includes the basement office where General McAuliffe issued the famous &quot;Nuts!&quot; response to the German demand for surrender. Other rooms display artillery, small arms, radio and medical equipment. Belgian Army specialists guide visitors through the base. 
*The Bastogne War Museum has many war artifacts and videos recreating the experience of the Battle of the Bulge for visitors.
*The &quot;Porte de Trèves&quot;, part of the defensive walls that had been erected in the 14th century by John the Blind, can still be seen.
*The Romanesque tower of St Pierre church and its baptismal fonts also date from the Middle Ages.
*The Mardasson Memorial, was erected near Bastogne in 1950 to honor the memory of American soldiers wounded or killed during the Battle of the Bulge.
*Monuments to Brigadier General McAuliffe, General Patton and others can be found around town.
*Recogne German war cemetery, 6 km to the North. Contains the graves of 6,807 German soldiers.

==Folklore==

The key character of all legends about Bastogne is the so-called &quot;piche-cacaye&quot;. This is pronounced &quot;pish-cackay&quot;.

==Transportation==

Bastogne originally had an NMBS/SNCB railway line connecting it to Libramont and to Gouvy. Passenger trains to Gouvy stopped in 1984 and in the 1990s the line to Libramont was taken out of service. The two station buildings in Bastogne remain, but are now used for other purposes. Part of the rail line has been converted into a cycle path. 

The city has two bus stations: Bastogne Nord and Bastogne Sud, supporting a rural shuttle from Bastogne Nord to Libramont stopping only at Bastogne Sud.

==Sports==

*Bastogne is the halfway point of the Liège–Bastogne–Liège classic bicycle race, one of the oldest and most prestigious one-day events in the professional road cycling calendar, dating back to the late 19th century.
*The &quot;Circuit des Ardennes&quot;, which today refers to a bicycle race, used to refer to a car race near Bastogne. The race used attracted famous enthusiasts, such as German Emperor William II. It was moved to Francorchamps around World War I, where it lives on as the Belgian Grand Prix.

==History==

Houffalize was a strategic location during the Battle of the Bulge of World War II. Specifically, Generals Montgomery and Patton met up here, Montgomery coming from the north and Patton from the south, in their counter-attack against the German forces remaining in the area. The town was flattened on the night of 5–6 January 1945 by ninety RAF Lancasters of Bomber Command to block the key crossroads for German supply columns and the escape route for German forces. Patton wrote a poem in his diary about the bombing.

==International relations==
===Twin towns - Sister cities===
Houffalize is a founding member of the Douzelage, a unique town twinning association of 24 towns across the European Union. This active town twinning began in 1991 and there are regular events, such as a produce market from each of the other countries and festivals. Discussions regarding membership are also in hand with three further towns (Agros in Cyprus, Škofja Loka in Slovenia, and Tryavna in Bulgaria).

<text>Vielsalm (; ) is a municipality of Wallonia located in the province of Luxembourg, Belgium. The town is part of the Arrondissement of Bastogne. It is the place of origin of the House of Salm.

On 1 January 2018 the municipality had 7,821 inhabitants. The total area is 139.76 km2, giving a population density of 56 inhabitants per km2.

==Etymology==

The village, like Salmchâteau, takes its name from the River Salm. The region is also called the Val de Salm, and Salm region. The word &quot;Salm&quot; comes from the Celtic &quot;salwa&quot;, meaning &quot;black&quot; or &quot;blurred&quot;. Vielsalm means literally &quot;Old Salm&quot; because, at some point, the Lord moved his castle which became the new town centre.

A different popular etymology says Salm and Vielsalm are taken from the German &quot;Salm&quot;, meaning &quot;salmon&quot;. The arms of the ancient house of Salm and those of the town are based on this interpretation.

==Geography==

Vielsalm is located in the Ardennes mountain range and the highest point within the municipal boundary is the Baraque de Fraiture, high and is the highest peak of the Benelux. The town is surrounded by forests and farmland. In the centre is a large lake.

The municipality consists of the following districts: Bihain, Grand-Halleux, Petit-Thier, and Vielsalm. Other population centers include Commanster, Fraiture, Farnières, Hébronval, Ottré, Provedroux, Jubiéval, Regné, Rencheux, Ville-du-Bois, Petit-Halleux and Salmchâteau.

The town is situated between two main motorways, the E25 (N30) from Liège to Bastogne and the E42 (N62) at St. Vith which leads to Bitburg just across the border in Germany.

==History==

The modern municipality is the product of the merger of the former municipalities of Vielsalm, Grand Halleux, Petit Thier and Bihain along with some parts of Lierneux, Beho Arbrefontaine.

There is evidence of habitation from neolithic times in the form of stone polishers. There is a Celtic enclosure and traces of gold mining. There are some evidence of a Middle Age castle near the church in Vielsalm, and the remains of a 14th-century castle near Salmchâteau consisting of two towers with a narrow entrance.

In World War II, the 75th Infantry Division of the U.S. Army, 575th Signal Co., maintained its command post in the town from January 19–22, 1945, as it counterattacked against the German Army.

==Economy==

The city has significant mining operations of slate, and a local whetstone, called &quot;coticule&quot;. The extracted coticule in Vielsalm owes its very fine abrasive properties to spessartine, which is a particular variety of garnet. The coticule is a metamorphic microcristalin schist, very fine grained, 35 to 40% of it small crystals of spessartine, of about 5 to 20 μm in diameter. These quarries, which are now almost exhausted, have been operating since the beginning of the 16th century to make razor stones prized for their longevity. The town currently has an industrial zone in Burtonville, in which are located small and medium-sized enterprises.

==Culture==

There is an annual &quot;Fête de la Myrtille&quot;, or &quot;Feast of the Blueberries&quot;, which started on July 21, 1951. The local Traders Association wanted a way to attract visitors to stop in the town. So they had local people in traditional costume invite visitors stop and handed them a small dish of local fruit including blueberries. The parade features, amongst others, local folklore such as &quot;Les Macralles&quot;, or witches in Walloon.

==Sights==

* Parish Church Saint-Gengoux
* Chapel of Our Lady of Luxembourg
* The &quot;Petit Croix&quot;
* Maison Lambert
* Ancient Maison Ruth
* Villa des Effats
* Town hall

==Governance==

The municipality is operated in a two-tier system. Daily administration, by way implementing council resolutions, is the duty of the College of Aldermen, led by a mayor, acting as an executive body. The aldermen are elected for six years by the council from among its members, their number varying from two to ten according to population of the municipality (e.g. in 2012 there were the college mayor, four aldermen and the president of the Council of Social Action). The council is directly elected by the people to determine tax collection and expenditure, decide education issues, maintenance of the buildings, roads and green areas etc. The exact number depends upon the population of the municipality.

==Education==

There are seven schools in the municipality covering pre-school, primary and secondary education in the town. They are the École communale de Goronne, École communale primaire d&#x27;Hébronval, École communale de Petit-Thier, École communale primaire de Regné, École communale maternelle de Regné, École communale de Rencheux, École communale de Salmchâteau and École communale primaire de Ville-du-Bois. There are also three Nursery and Primary, as well as one Secondary, schools that are designated as free.

==Notable residents==
* Nicholas, Count of Salm, (1459-1530), German military commander
* Olivier Werner (born April 16, 1985), football player of RAEC Mons

==Twinning==

Vielsalm is twinned with:

* Bruyères, a town in the Vosges of Lorraine.

<text>In software development, Make is a command-line interface software tool that performs actions ordered by configured dependencies as defined in a configuration file called a &quot;makefile&quot;. It is commonly used for build automation to build executable code (such as a program or library) from source code. But, not limited to building, Make can perform any operation available via the operating system shell.

Make is widely used, especially in Unix and Unix-like operating systems, even though many competing technologies and tools are available, including similar tools that perform actions based on dependencies, some compilers and interactively via an integrated development environment.

In addition to referring to the original Unix tool, Make is also a technology since multiple tools have been implemented with roughly the same functionality including similar makefile syntax and semantics.

==Origin== 

Stuart Feldman created Make while at Bell Labs. An early version was completed in April 1976. Feldman received the 2003 ACM Software System Award for authoring Make. 

Feldman describes the inspiration to write Make as arising from a coworker&#x27;s frustration with the available tooling of the time:

Before Make, building on Unix mostly consisted of shell scripts written for each program&#x27;s codebase. Make&#x27;s dependency ordering and out-of-date checking makes the build process more robust and more efficient. The makefile allowed for better organization of build logic and often fewer build files.

Make is widely used in part due to its early inclusion in Unix, starting with PWB/UNIX 1.0, which featured a variety of software development tools.

==Variants==

Make has been implemented numerous times, generally using the same makefile format and providing the same features, but some providing enhancements from the original. Examples:

* Sun DevPro Make appeared in 1986 with SunOS-3.2. With SunOS-3.2. It was delivered as an optional program; with SunOS-4.0, SunPro Make was made the default Make program. In December 2006, Sun DevPro Make was made open source as part of the efforts to open-source Solaris.
* dmake or Distributed Make that came with Sun Solaris Studio as its default Make, but not the default one on the Solaris Operating System (SunOS). It was originally required to build OpenOffice, but in 2009 the build system was rewritten to use GNU Make. While Apache OpenOffice still contains a mixture of both build systems, the much more actively developed LibreOffice only uses the modernized &quot;gbuild&quot; now.
* BSD Make (&quot;pmake&quot;, &quot;bmake&quot; or &quot;fmake&quot;), which is derived from Adam de Boor&#x27;s work on a version of Make capable of building targets in parallel, and survives with varying degrees of modification in FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD. Distinctively, it has conditionals and iterative loops which are applied at the parsing stage and may be used to conditionally and programmatically construct the makefile, including generation of targets at runtime.
* GNU Make (short &quot;gmake&quot;) is the standard implementation of Make for Linux and macOS. It provides several extensions over the original Make, such as conditionals. It also provides many built-in functions which can be used to eliminate the need for shell-scripting in the makefile rules as well as to manipulate the variables set and used in the makefile. For example, the &quot;foreach&quot; function can be used to iterate over a list of values, such as the names of files in a given directory. GNU Make is required for building many software systems, including GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) (since version 3.4), the Linux kernel, Apache OpenOffice, LibreOffice, and Mozilla Firefox.
* Rocky Bernstein&#x27;s Remake is a fork of GNU Make and provides several extensions over GNU Make, such as better location and error-location reporting, execution tracing, execution profiling, and it contains a debugger.
* Glenn Fowler&#x27;s &quot;nmake&quot; (unrelated to the same-named Microsoft variant) is incompatible with the UNIX variant, but provides features which, according to some, reduce the size of makefiles by a factor of 10.
* Microsoft &quot;nmake&quot; is normally installed with Visual Studio. It supports preprocessor directives such as includes and conditional expressions which use variables set on the command-line or within the makefiles. Inference rules differ from Make; for example they can include search paths. 
*Embarcadero make has a command-line option that &quot;Causes MAKE to mimic Microsoft&#x27;s NMAKE.&quot;.
*Qt Project&#x27;s &quot;Jom&quot; tool is a clone of nmake.
* &quot;Mk&quot; replaced Make in Research Unix, starting from version 9. A redesign of the original tool by Bell Labs programmer Andrew G. Hume, it features a different syntax. Mk became the standard build tool in Plan 9, Bell Labs&#x27; intended successor to Unix.
* &quot;Kati&quot; is Google&#x27;s replacement of GNU Make, as of 2020 used in Android OS builds. It translates the makefile into ninja for faster incremental builds (similar to the cmake metatool).
* Snakemake is a Python-driven implementation for compiling and running bioinformatics workflows.

POSIX includes standardization of the basic features and operation of the Make utility, and is implemented with varying degrees of compatibility with Unix-based versions of Make. In general, simple makefiles may be used between various versions of Make with reasonable success. GNU Make, Makepp and some versions of BSD Make default to looking first for files named &quot;GNUmakefile&quot;, &quot;Makeppfile&quot; and &quot;BSDmakefile&quot; respectively, which allows one to put makefiles which use implementation-defined behavior in separate locations.

==Use==

In general, based on a makefile, Make updates target files from source files if any source file has a newer timestamp than the target file or the target file does not exist. For example, this could include compiling C files () into object files, then linking the object files into an executable program. Or this could include compiling TypeScript files () to JavaScript for use in a browser. Other examples include: convert a source image file to another format, copy a file to a content management system, and send e-mail about build status.

A makefile defines targets where each is either a file to generate or is a user-defined concept, called a &quot;phony&quot; target.

Make updates the targets passed as arguments:
make [-f makefile] [options] [targets]
If no target is specified, Make updates the first target in the makefile which is often a phony target to perform the most commonly used action.

Make skips build actions if the target file timestamp is after that of the source files. Doing so optimizes the build process by skipping actions when the target file is up-to-date, but sometimes updates are skipped erroneously due to file timestamp issues including restoring an older version of a source file, or when a network filesystem is a source of files and its clock or time zone is not synchronized with the machine running Make. Also, if a source file&#x27;s timestamp is in the future, make repeatedly triggers unnecessary actions, causing longer build time.

When Make starts, it uses the makefile specified on the command-line or if not specified, then uses the one found by via specific search rules. Generally, Make defaults to using the file in the working directory named . GNU Make searches for the first file matching: , , or .

Make processes the options of the command-line based on the loaded makefile.

==Makefile==

The makefile language is partially declarative programming where end conditions are described but the order in which actions are to be taken is not. This type of programming can be confusing to programmers used to imperative programming.

Makefiles can contain the following constructs:

* &quot;Explicit rule&quot;: defines when and how to update a target, listing &quot;prerequisites&quot; (dependent targets) and commands that define the update action, called the &quot;recipe&quot; 
* &quot;Implicit rule&quot;: defines when and how to remake a class of files based on their names, including how a target depends on a file with a name similar to the target and an update recipe
* &quot;Variable definition&quot;: associates a text value with a name that can be substituted into later text
* &quot;Directive&quot;: instruction to do something special such as include another makefile
* &quot;Comment&quot;: line starting with 

===Rules===

Each rule begins with a &quot;dependency line&quot; which consists of the rule&#x27;s target name followed by a colon (:), and optionally a list of targets (also known as prerequisites) on which the rule&#x27;s target depends.

 target [target ...]: [component ...]
 [command 1]
 .
 [command n]

Usually a rule has a single target, rather than multiple.

A dependency line may be followed by a recipe: a series of TAB indented command lines that define how to generate the target from the components (i.e. source files). If any prerequisite has a more recent timestamp than the target file or the target does not exist as a file, the recipe is performed.

The first command may appear on the same line after the prerequisites, separated by a semicolon,

targets: prerequisites ; command

for example,

hello: ; @echo &quot;hello&quot;
Each command line must begin with a tab character. Even though a space is also whitespace, Make requires tab. Since this often leads to confusion and mistakes, this aspect of makefile syntax is subject to criticism. Eric S. Raymond describes it as &quot;one of the worst design botches in the history of Unix&quot; and &quot;The Unix-Haters Handbook&quot; said &quot;using tabs as part of the syntax is like one of those pungee [sic] stick traps in &quot;The Green Berets&quot;&quot;. Feldman explains the choice as caused by a workaround for an early implementation difficulty, and preserved by a desire for backward compatibility with the very first users:

GNU Make since version 3.82 allows the choice of any symbol (one character) as the recipe prefix using the .RECIPEPREFIX special variable:

.RECIPEPREFIX := :
all:
:@echo &quot;recipe prefix symbol is set to &#x27;$(.RECIPEPREFIX)&#x27;&quot;
Each command is executed in a separate shell. Since operating systems use different shells, this can lead to unportable makefiles. For example, GNU Make (all POSIX Makes) executes commands with /bin/sh by default, where Unix commands like cp are normally used. In contrast, Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;nmake&quot; executes commands with cmd.exe where batch commands like copy are available but not necessarily cp.

Since a recipe is optional, the dependency line can consist solely of components that refer to other targets:

realclean: clean distclean
The following example rule is evaluated when Make updates target file.txt via . If file.html is newer than file.txt or file.txt does not exist, then the command is run to generate file.txt from file.html.
file.txt: file.html
 lynx -dump file.html &gt; file.txt
A command can have one or more of the following prefixes (after the tab):
* minus (-) specifies to ignore an error from the command
* at (@) specifies to &quot;not&quot; output the command before it is executed
* plus (+) specifies to execute the command even if Make is invoked in &quot;do not execute&quot; mode

Ignoring errors and silencing echo can alternatively be obtained via the special targets and .

Microsoft&#x27;s NMAKE has predefined rules that can be omitted from these makefiles, e.g. .

===Macros===

A makefile can define and use macros. Macros are usually referred to as &quot;variables&quot; when they hold simple string definitions, like . Macros in makefiles may be overridden in the command-line arguments passed to the Make utility. Environment variables are also available as macros.

For example, the macro is frequently used in makefiles to refer to the location of a C compiler. If used consistently throughout the makefile, then the compiler used can be changed by changing the value of the macro rather than changing each rule command that invokes the compiler.

Macros are commonly named in all-caps:
MACRO = definition
A macro value can consist of other macro values. The value of macro is expanded on each use lazily.

A macro is used by expanding either via $&quot;NAME&quot; or $(&quot;NAME&quot;). The latter is safer since omitting the parentheses leads to Make interpreting the next letter after the as the entire variable name. An equivalent form uses curly braces rather than parentheses, i.e. , which is the style used in BSD.
NEW_MACRO = $(MACRO)-$(MACRO2)
Macros can be composed of shell commands by using the command substitution operator codice_1.
YYYYMMDD != date
The command-line syntax for overriding a macro is:
make MACRO=&quot;value&quot; [MACRO=&quot;value&quot; ...] TARGET [TARGET ...]
Makefiles can access predefined &quot;internal macros&quot;, with and being common.
target: component1 component2
 # echo components YOUNGER than TARGET
 echo $? 
 # echo TARGET name
 echo $@ 
A common syntax when defining macros, which works on BSD and GNU Make, is to use , , and instead of the equal sign ().

===Suffix rules===

Suffix rules have &quot;targets&quot; with names in the form and are used to launch actions based on file extension. In the command lines of suffix rules, POSIX specifies that the internal macro refers to the first prerequisite and refers to the target. In this example, which converts any HTML file into text, the shell redirection token is part of the command line, whereas is a macro referring to the HTML file:
.SUFFIXES: .txt .html

# From .html to .txt
.html.txt:
 lynx -dump $&lt; &gt; $@
When called from the command line, the example above expands:
$ make -n file.txt
lynx -dump file.html &gt; file.txt
===Pattern rules ===

Suffix rules cannot have any prerequisites of their own. If they have any, they are treated as normal files with unusual names, not as suffix rules. GNU Make supports suffix rules for compatibility with old makefiles but otherwise encourages usage of &quot;pattern rules&quot;.

A pattern rule looks like an ordinary rule, except that its target contains exactly one character within the string. The target is considered a pattern for matching file names: the can match any substring of zero or more characters, while other characters match only themselves. The prerequisites likewise use to show how their names relate to the target name.

The example above of a suffix rule would look like the following pattern rule:

# From %.html to %.txt
%.txt : %.html 
 lynx -dump $&lt; &gt; $@
===Comment===

Single-line comments are started with the hash symbol (#).

===Directive===

A directive specifies special behavior such as including another makefile.

===Line continuation===

Line continuation is indicated with a backslash character at the end of a line.

 target: component \
 component
 command ; \
 command | \
 piped-command

==Examples==

The following commands are in the context of the makefile that follows.
make # updates first target, &#x27;all&#x27;
make help # updates target &#x27;help&#x27; to list targets
make dist # updates target &#x27;dist&#x27; to build for distribution

PACKAGE = package
VERSION = ` date &quot;+%Y.%m%d%&quot; `
RELEASE_DIR = ..
RELEASE_FILE = $(PACKAGE)-$(VERSION)

# Default target
# note: variable LOGNAME comes from the environment
all:
 echo &quot;Hello $(LOGNAME), nothing to do by default&quot;
 echo &quot;Try &#x27;make help&#x27;&quot;

# Display targets by searching this file
help:
 egrep &quot;^# target:&quot; [Mm]akefile

# Make a release
dist:
 tar -cf $(RELEASE_DIR)/$(RELEASE_FILE) &amp;&amp; \
 gzip -9 $(RELEASE_DIR)/$(RELEASE_FILE).tar
Below is a simple makefile that by default (the &quot;all&quot; rule is listed first) compiles a source file called &quot;helloworld.c&quot; using the system&#x27;s C compiler and also provides a &quot;clean&quot; target to remove the generated files if the user desires to start over. The and are two of the so-called internal macros (also known as automatic variables) and stand for the target name and &quot;implicit&quot; source, respectively. In the example below, expands to a space delimited list of the prerequisites. There are a number of other internal macros.
CFLAGS ?= -g

all: helloworld

helloworld: helloworld.o
 $(CC) $(LDFLAGS) -o $@ $^

helloworld.o: helloworld.c
 $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c -o $@ $&lt;

clean:
 $(RM) helloworld helloworld.o
Many systems come with predefined Make rules and macros to specify common tasks such as compilation based on file suffix. This lets users omit the actual (often unportable) instructions of how to generate the target from the source(s). On such a system the makefile above could be modified as follows:
all: helloworld

helloworld: helloworld.o
 $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) -o $@ $^

clean:
 $(RM) helloworld helloworld.o

# suffix rule
.c.o:
 $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $&lt;

.SUFFIXES: .c


That &quot;helloworld.o&quot; depends on &quot;helloworld.c&quot; is now automatically handled by Make. In such a simple example as the one illustrated here this hardly matters, but the real power of suffix rules becomes evident when the number of source files in a software project starts to grow. One only has to write a rule for the linking step and declare the object files as prerequisites. Make will then implicitly determine how to make all the object files and look for changes in all the source files.

Simple suffix rules work well as long as the source files do not depend on each other and on other files such as header files. Another route to simplify the build process is to use so-called pattern matching rules that can be combined with compiler-assisted dependency generation. As a final example requiring the gcc compiler and GNU Make, here is a generic makefile that compiles all C files in a folder to the corresponding object files and then links them to the final executable. Before compilation takes place, dependencies are gathered in makefile-friendly format into a hidden file &quot;.depend&quot; that is then included to the makefile. Portable programs ought to avoid constructs used below.
# Generic GNUMakefile

# snippet to fail if not GNU
ifneq (,)
This makefile requires GNU Make.
endif

PROGRAM = foo
C_FILES := $(wildcard *.c)
OBJS := $(patsubst %.c, %.o, $(C_FILES))
CC = cc
CFLAGS = -Wall -pedantic
LDFLAGS =
LDLIBS = -lm

all: $(PROGRAM)

$(PROGRAM): .depend $(OBJS)
 $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(OBJS) $(LDFLAGS) -o $(PROGRAM) $(LDLIBS)

depend: .depend

.depend: cmd = gcc -MM -MF depend $(var); cat depend » .depend;
.depend:
 @echo &quot;Generating dependencies...&quot;
 @$(foreach var, $(C_FILES), $(cmd))
 @rm -f depend

-include .depend

# These are the pattern matching rules. In addition to the automatic
# variables used here, the variable $* that matches whatever % stands for
# can be useful in special cases.
%.o: %.c
 $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $&lt; -o $@

%: %.o
 $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $&lt;

clean:
 rm -f .depend $(OBJS)

.PHONY: clean depend

== Dependency tracking ==
Makefile consist of dependencies and a forgotten or an extra one may not be immediately obvious to the user and may result in subtle bugs in the generated software that are hard to catch. Various approaches may be used to avoid this problem and keep dependencies in source and makefiles in sync. One approach is by using compiler to keep track of dependencies changes .e.g GCC can statically analyze the source code and produce rules for the given file automatically by using switch. The other approach would be makefiles or third-party tools that would generate makefiles with dependencies (e.g. Automake toolchain by the GNU Project, can do so automatically). 

Another approach is to use meta-build tools like CMake, Meson etc.

<text>Durbuy (; ) is a city and municipality of Wallonia located in the province of Luxembourg, Belgium. 

The total area is 156.61 km2, consisting of the following districts: Barvaux, Bende, Bomal, Borlon, Durbuy, Grandhan, Heyd, Izier, Septon, Tohogne, Villers-Sainte-Gertrude, and Wéris. 

On 1 January 2018 the municipality had 11,374 inhabitants with the most populous town of the municipality being Barvaux. Durbuy, for commercial reasons, often calls itself the world&#x27;s smallest city, although Belgium&#x27;s official smallest city, since 2006, is Mesen.

== History ==
In medieval times, Durbuy was an important centre of commerce and industry. In 1331, the town was elevated to the rank of city by John I, Count of Luxemburg, and King of Bohemia.

In 1628 Anthonie II Schetz obtains the Seigneurie of Durbuy, by permission of Felipe IV of Spain. One of the people connected to the city was the son of Lancelot II: Charles Hubert Augustin Schetz, (1662-1726), Count of Durbuy. In 1756 the descendants of the House of Schetz obtain the Castle. Since then the House of Ursel resides in the Castle. The current castle was built in 1880.

The Ourthe river flows through the municipality.

Tourism and recreation are its main activities nowadays. Durbuy is often represented, by itself and by tourism promoters, as &#x27;the smallest city of the world&#x27;.

<doc id="176198" wikidata="Q160709" url="?curid=176198" title="Hotton">
<text>Hotton (; ) is a municipality of Wallonia located in the province of Luxembourg, Belgium. 
The municipality lies 12 kilometers from Marche-en-Famenne in the Ardennes and has more than 5,400 inhabitants. The river Ourthe crosses Hotton.

The municipality consists of the following districts: Hampteau, Hotton, Marenne and Fronville. There are also several hamlets: Bourdon, Deulin, Ménil-Favay, Monville, Monteuville, Melreux, Ny and Werpin.

The municipality lies in the Arrondissement of Marche-en-Famenne. In the west it borders the province of Namur.

==History==
The first history of Hotton dates from Roman times, when Hotton was an oppidum. Multiple Roman excavations have been found at Ti-Château, a strengthened Roman encampment. The village of Hotton was first mentioned in medieval documents as &quot;Hottine&quot; in 1187. Hotton was part of the medieval county of La Roche till the 16th century, when it was taken over by the lords of Montaigu. In 1791, Hotton became a free village.

In the afternoon of 11 May 1940, Hotton was captured and occupied by the 5th Panzer Division during the Battle of Belgium. Allied forces tried in vain to blow up the steel bridge over the Ourthe in an attempt to slow down German forces. Hotton played an important role during the Battle of the Bulge, as German troops (116th Panzer Division &quot;Der Windhund&quot; and the 560th Volksgrenadier Division) reached here the most western point of their advance, being stopped by the American 84th Infantry Division &quot;Railsplitters&quot;.

The current municipality was founded in 1977, when the municipalities of Hampteau, Fronville and Marenne were added to the municipality of Hotton.

The Hotton War Cemetery is home to British World War II war dead.

==Tourism==
Hotton is a very popular place with tourists and is known for its speleothem caves, known as the Caves of Hotton. A small Commonwealth war cemetery with 660 graves is also situated just outside Hotton, Hotton War Cemetery. Other tourist attractions are Deulin Castle, the Virgin of Werpin, the Faber Mill, St. Peter&#x27;s Church, Melreux and Riveo Centre.

The well-known annual hot air balloon festival &quot;Hottolfiades&quot; is held in August. The annual fair (also held in August) claims to be the largest fair of the arrondissement.

==Politics==

Former mayor Phillipe Courard (MAYEUR), who was mayor between 1995 and 2012, was beaten at the 2012 Belgian local elections after being mayor for seventeen years. He was replaced by Jacques Chaplier of the Entente Communale (E.C.).

<doc id="176199" wikidata="Q159974" url="?curid=176199" title="La Roche-en-Ardenne">
<text>La Roche-en-Ardenne (; ) is a city and municipality of Wallonia located in the province of Luxembourg and the arrondissement of Marche-en-Famenne, Belgium. Lying beside a bend in the River Ourthe, the small town of La Roche-en-Ardenne is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the Ardennes. Its name is derived from its position on a rock commanding the river.

On 1 January 2007 the municipality, which covers 147.52 km2, had 4,348 inhabitants, giving a population density of 29.5 inhabitants per km2.

The municipality consists of the following districts: Beausaint, Halleux, Hives, La Roche-en-Ardenne, Ortho, and Samrée. Other population centres include Bérismenil, Buisson, Cielle, Floumont, Herlinval, Hubermont, Lavaux, Maboge, Mierchamps, Mousny, Nisramont, Ronchampays, Ronchamps, Roupage, Thimont, Vecmont, and Warempage.

==Geography==
La Roche-en-Ardenne is located between the E25 Liège-Luxembourg and the N4 motorways. More than half of the municipal area (about ) is covered in forests and is arable land, and only has been built on. The division between deciduous and coniferous forests is more or less equal.

==History==
La Roche is believed to have first been settled in the Neolithic era. There is a Celtic archaeological site dating between 850 and 520 BC. The Romans built a fort there following their conquest of Gaul and the Ardennes.

The town&#x27;s medieval castle was in use between the 9th and 18th centuries. It provided protection to the many barges that plied their trade along the local river systems. It may have been the site of a sporting lodge of Pippin, and certainly the counts of La Roche held it in fief from his descendants, the Carolingian rulers. In the 12th century they sold it to the counts of Luxembourg.

In 1331, permission to build city walls was given by John the Blind, King of Bohemia and Poland and a Count of Luxembourg.

In World War II, the town was occupied by both German and Allied forces, suffering severe damage. Freed by Americans in September 1944, the town was recaptured by the Germans in December, during the Battle of the Bulge. The subsequent Allied bombing raids resulted in the town being reoccupied by Americans once more in January 1945, but left much of it destroyed and 116 residents dead. An American Sherman M4A1 tank and a British Achilles SP 17pdr are displayed as monuments to the town&#x27;s liberation. In town also is a memorial to the 82nd Armored Reconnaissance Battalion.

In 1976 there was a merger of administrative districts in the area that resulted in the municipality of La Roche-en-Ardennes. Beausaint, Halleux, Hives, Ortho and Samrée were joined by Cielle detached from Marcourt, now within the municipality of Rendeux.

==Economy==
Hiking, kayaking, and mountain biking are among the outdoor pursuits available here. The municipality&#x27;s other main economic activity is agriculture. A business park was established on the plateau Vecmont to diversify the local economy.

The ceramic stoneware of La Roche (cobalt blue pottery, glazed with salt) is a local tradition known, initiated in 1836 by Henry Hoffman, a native of Ransbach in the Duchy of Nassau. The production was revived in 1878 by the family Kalb and continued until 2009 by several successors. A permanent exhibition on this tradition.

==Governance==
Like other Belgian Municipalities, the town is governed by a Communal College, whose membership is determined by the size of the population. In 2012, that was the Mayor, Town Clerk and 3 Alderman. An elected City Council determined what local taxes are spent and on what. As of 2012, this had a membership of 9 councillors.

==Sights==
There are three main archaeological sites: 
* Le Cheslé de Bérismenil, a Celtic refuge
* le Cheslin d&#x27;Ortho, a Roman refuge
* La Roche-en-Ardenne Castle

There is the Parc à Gibier, a small wild game park on the top of the plateau above the town.

<text>Marche-en-Famenne (; ; literally &quot;Marche in Famenne&quot;) is a city and municipality of Wallonia located in the Belgian province of Luxembourg.

The municipality consists of the following districts: Aye, Hargimont, Humain, Marche-en-Famenne, On, Roy, and Waha.

Other population centres include Grimbiémont, Hollogne, Lignières, Marloie, and Verdenne.

==History==

===Middle Ages===
In the early Middle Ages, Marche was just a little hamlet on the Marchette brook, one of the dependencies of the nearby Abbey of Stavelot. In the 12th century, this territory was made part of the County of La Roche. It was ideally located, on the main road between Namur and Luxembourg City, and quickly evolved into a town, which obtained its charter in the 13th century. At the end of the century, in true medieval fashion, it acquired a complete system of defensive walls, with two gates, a series of watchtowers, and a keep. The market place and religious organizations, such as the Carmes convent founded in 1473, could thrive inside the closed city.

===After 1500===
When in 1555 Philip II of Spain, son of Charles V, inherited his father&#x27;s empire, the freedoms of Spain&#x27;s Seventeen Provinces to the north were reduced considerably, giving rise to the Eighty Years&#x27; War. In the aftermath of the Pacification of Ghent, Don John of Austria, Philip II&#x27;s half brother, granted the Perpetual Edict, which was signed in the city in February 1577. The edict allowed for the departure of the Spanish troops and recognized most of the city&#x27;s freedoms, with the notable exception of religion. The war started again and Don John died a year later near Namur.

The castle and defensive walls were dismantled at the end of the 17th century on the orders of Louis XIV. A century later, the French Revolutionary troops entered the city and closed the convent. Fighting occurred in and around Marche in December 1944 as part of the Battle of the Bulge, the last major German offensive in West during World War II. Today, with its schools, light industries, military complex, and tourist attractions, Marche is a vibrant regional centre.

==Sights==

*The city centre includes a few interesting buildings, such as the St Remacle church and the old Carmes convent.
*The city is the home of several museums, including a lace museum, which is housed in one of the last remnants of the city&#x27;s medieval walls and commemorates the hundreds of lace workers that lived in the Marche area in the 18th century.
*The Famenne museum gives a good overview of the region&#x27;s art and history.

==Festivities==
*The &quot;Grosse Biesse&quot; (&quot;Great Beast&quot;) carnival takes place every year in February. It features the beast, as well as the city&#x27;s mascot &quot;Gugusse&quot;, traditional giants, and several other groups of joyful characters.
*A folkloric group called &quot;La Plovinette&quot; (&quot;Fine Drizzle&quot;) specializes in traditional Walloon dancing.

<text>Gary P. Nolan (born 1954 in Cleveland, Ohio) is an American talk radio host and a former candidate for the Libertarian Party nomination for President of the United States.

From 1994 to 1998, Nolan hosted &quot;USA Radio Daily&quot; on the USA Radio Network. From 1998 to 2002, he hosted &quot;Nolan at Night&quot; on 65 U.S. affiliates of the Radio America Network. He also served as the volunteer President of the conservative group CapitolWatch from 1997 through 1999. Nolan currently serves as Chairman of the Board of Directors for DownsizeDC.org.

At the end of 2002, he resigned from Nolan at Night to seek the Libertarian nomination for president, facing fellow candidates Michael Badnarik and Aaron Russo. Nolan had to resign from his radio show due to a law that prohibits candidates for office making an income while discussing their political views. Nolan pledged to run a practical campaign of reaching out to moderate voters and Republicans dissatisfied with the George W. Bush presidency, particularly in his home swing state of Ohio. Nolan ran as an opponent of the United States Patriot Act, the income tax and foreign military bases, calling for bringing home American troops.

For most of the campaign, Nolan led the field of candidates in primaries and state conventions. He held a 22 point lead in his home state of Ohio. In a closely contested race, Nolan placed third and was eliminated following the second ballot (in contested results) at the May, 2004 Libertarian National Convention. Nolan then encouraged his delegates to support Badnarik, who won the nomination on the next ballot.

Gary Nolan hosted a radio show called &quot;The Drive with Gary Nolan&quot; in the afternoons on Columbia, Missouri, talk radio station KSSZ &quot;The Eagle 93.9&quot;. In February 2010 he began hosting WXTL&#x27;s &quot;Big Talker&quot; 105.9 in Syracuse, New York, between 4 and 7pm. Nolan left WXTL in April 2011 to return to KSSZ &quot;The Eagle 93.9&quot; to begin a nationally syndicated program.

<text>Bouillon (; ) is a city and municipality of Wallonia located in the province of Luxembourg in the Ardennes, Belgium. 

The municipality, which covers 149.09 km2, had 5,477 inhabitants, giving a population density of 36.7 inhabitants per km2.

The municipality consists of the following districts: Bellevaux, Bouillon, Corbion, Dohan, Les Hayons, Noirefontaine, Poupehan, Rochehaut, Sensenruth, Ucimont, and Vivy.

== History ==

In the Middle Ages Bouillon was a lordship within the Duchy of Lower Lorraine and the principal seat of the Ardennes-Bouillon dynasty in the 10th and 11th century. In the 11th century they dominated the area, and held the ducal title along with many other titles in the region. Bouillon was the location of the ducal mint and the dominant urban concentration in the dukes&#x27; possession.
There is a common misconception that Bouillon was a county. While the lords of Bouillon often were counts and dukes, Bouillon itself was not a county. The fortification of Bouillon Castle was, along with the County of Verdun, the core of the possessions of the Ardennes-Bouillon dynasty, and their combined territory was a complex mixture of fiefs, allodial land and other hereditary rights throughout the area. An example of the latter is the Advocacy of the monastery of Saint-Hubert en Ardennes, which was granted to Godfrey II by the prince-bishop of Liège.

The most famous of the Lords of Bouillon was Godfrey of Bouillon, a leader of the First Crusade and the first ruler of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. He sold the Bouillon estate to the Prince-Bishopric of Liège. The prince-bishops started to call themselves dukes of Bouillon, and the town emerged as the capital of a sovereign duchy by 1678, when it was captured from the prince-bishopric by the French army and given to the La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne family. The duchy was prized for its strategic location as &quot;the key to the Ardennes&quot; (as Vauban called it) and hence to France itself. It remained a quasi-independent protectorate, like Orange and Monaco, until 1795, when the Republican Army annexed it to France.

After the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte, the city was given to the Netherlands in the 1815 Treaty of Paris. It has been part of Belgium since the Revolution of 1830.

==History==

===Early history===
A Neolithic megalith dating from about 2000 BC and a Celtic necropolis dating from between the 5th and 2nd centuries BC have been found in this area, attesting to early human activity. Gallo-Roman sepultures and a small Roman villa were found here as well, showing the presence around the 2nd century AD of a minor agricultural domain. The region was used in Carolingian times mostly as a hunting area and population remained sparse throughout the Middle Ages. A document dating from 1100 shows that one of the many tiny hamlets in the area, Semel, was donated to the Abbey of Amdain (currently Saint-Hubert). In 1239, that same hamlet was mentioned as being part of the lordship of Neufchâteau, at the time when it was now given to the Orval Abbey. Like many of its neighbours, the lordship of Neufchâteau was part of the Duchy of Luxembourg.

===17th century until now===
An important document for the history of the Neufchâteau region is a 1609 painting entitled &quot;LA TERRE ET PREVOSTEE DE NEVFCHASTEAV AVECQZ SES DESPENDENCES&quot;, now kept in the Arlon archives. The painting shows the town of Neufchâteau within its protective walls, at the foot of its castle, surrounded by a number of villages and hamlets. In the mid-17th century, the plague and Louis XIV’s wars decimated the area. After the French Revolution and until 1815, Neufchâteau became the chief town of the old French &quot;département&quot; of Forêts. During World War I, its governor, Count Hans von Blumenthal, was one of a small number of German military officials who struck up a rapport with the local population, chiefly through his interest in hunting. Fighting in the area, however, was heavy, as more than 200 soldiers lost their lives in the first month of the war.

The cell biologist and Nobel Prizewinner Albert Claude was born in Longlier, close to Neufchâteau, in 1899.

==Coat of arms==
The French blazon reads: &quot;D’azur à trois poissons d’argent posés en fasce et surmontés d’une couronne d’or.&quot;

The municipality&#x27;s arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Azure three fish fesswise in pale argent and in chief a crown Or.

==History of counts of Chiny==

The first dynasty ruled from 980 to 1384.

From 980, Arnoul of Burgundy-Granson, became the first Count of Chiny. By his marriage to Mathilde, daughter of Ricuin, Duke of Mosellane and Count of Ardennes, he acquired the dowry of his wife, a land of forests rich with game, crossed by a capricious river, the Semois. His son Othon of Warcq, left his small fortress on the Meuse to site the Château de Chiny on a rocky spur overlooking the river. In the eleventh century, the Château was a formidable barrier in the region. The area that was ruled by the count was huge: 246 towns, 57 castles, 1412 villages.

The fourth Count, Louis II, loved hunting parties and held them in his huge game park starting in 1040. It was then that the legend relates that a young lord named Thibault, a descendant of the Counts of Champagne, secretly left his father&#x27;s house to offer his services in the Ardennes forest near Chiny, where he established a hermitage and found a source of holy springs. Louis II built a large shrine to the spring&#x27;s healing powers. The shrine became famous, with many pilgrims who came to implore the grace of Saint-Thibault. Later, monks from Calabria, Italy, founded a Monastery nearby at Orval.

Arnoul, a successor, regularly confronted Count Godfrey of Bouillon, leader of the first Crusade and nephew of Queen Mathilde. They eventually became friends and Arnoul entrusted Godfrey both his sons, Otto and Louis, to take part in the first Crusade. Returning from the Crusade, Otto, was in turn count of Chiny, but he found Orval falling in ruins. The Calabrian monks left in 1108, and the Cistercians revived Orval.

Louis IV was the last count of the first dynasty. Having no son, he prepared Jeanne, his eldest daughter, as his successor. Louis IV marked his reign by the first postage stamp in the county.

In marrying Jeanne, Arnulf of Looz became the first Count of the second dynasty. He was notable as the builder of the fortress of Montmedy. Their son, Louis V held a tournament of chivalry in 1285 that was regarded as the finest in the Middle Ages, at the village de Chauvency-le-Château. Over 500 knights of Europe attended this tournament and were memorialized in song by the bard Jacques Bretel. Louis V enjoyed great notoriety as a result. He died in 1299. His heart, per his last wishes, was embalmed and buried in a lead box in front of the altar at Saint-Thibault, in the village of Suxy.

Thereafter, the Counts struggled to maintain their territory as wars and battles ensued. They were by turn, the vassals of the Count of Bar and John the Blind, King of Bohemia and Count of Luxembourg, all claiming the same lands. Seven Counts were named in less than thirty years. The father of Arnould Rumigny, last count of Chiny died of pneumonia a few months before the birth of his son. His young widow died in childbirth, and the son, Arnould, sold his lands rather than allow his malevolent uncle&#x27;s offspring to inherit. On 13 June 1364, the lands of Chiny were sold to Wenceslas, Duke of Luxembourg.

Later, in the 15th century, the Count de Faing was created and his Château was erected, which was later reconstructed and stands today.

On the same day, at Rossignol, one of the great disasters of the Battle of the Borders took place during the fighting at Rossignol: the 3rd French colonial infantry division, an elite corps made up mostly of volunteers who had already seen fire, was surrounded and annihilated by the XI and XII Infantry Divisions of the German VI Silesian Corps. Ernest Psichari, killed in this battle, rests in the military cemetery of Rossignol3. Despite their victory, the Germans, exhausted by this battle slowing them down in their advance towards Paris, attacked the population. They deported 120 inhabitants of Rossignol and neighboring villages and shot them in Arlon on August 26, 1914, at the current Place des Fusillés, named after them in their memory.

<text>Virton (; Gaumais: &quot;Viertån&quot;; ) is a city and municipality of Wallonia located in the province of Luxembourg, Belgium. It is also the administrative centre of the district (&quot;arrondissement&quot;) of the same name, as well as the principal town of the small region of Belgian Lorraine known as the Gaume, famous for its microclimate.

The municipality consists of the following districts: Bleid, Ethe, Latour, Ruette, Saint-Mard, and Virton. Other population centers include: Chenois, Gomery, Grandcourt, and Saint-Remy.

==History==

===Antiquity and Middle Ages===
Several archeological finds indicate that the area was already inhabited before the Romans built villas there and named the town &quot;Vertunum&quot;. In the early 5th century, the Romans had to flee the Germanic invasions. Their settlement was destroyed and rebuilt by the Franks somewhat north of its original site.

Virton was mentioned for the first time in Pope Lucius III&#x27;s bull of 1183 as a fiefdom of the House of Chiny. As overlords of Virton, the Counts of Chiny could levy taxes (the &quot;tonlieu&quot;) on the various goods sold at the local market, which is attested as early as 1270. In 1441, the Duchy of Luxembourg was sold to Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy. From that date, Virton, like many other Walloon cities, became embroiled in more than two centuries of wars between France, Spain, and the Netherlands, with all the fighting, famine, epidemics (including plague), and economic disasters that ensued. The city fared better under the rule of Maria Theresa of Austria in the 18th century, thanks in part to the development of Lorraine&#x27;s steel industry.

===Modern times===
The French Revolution shattered those advances. Virton had to wait until the departure of Napoleon in 1815 to see prosperous times again. Virton enthusiastically participated in the Belgian Revolution and even in the French Revolution of 1848. On August 22, 1914, at the onset of World War I, hundreds of inhabitants were summarily executed by the invading German army, while mass deportations occurred during World War II. Virton is now the centre of commerce and tourism for the Gaume region.

The town became an icon in Israeli sports history after Maccabi Tel Aviv defeated CSKA Moscow 91:79 in a European Basketball Champions&#x27; Cup game on 17 February 1977, in the town&#x27;s sports arena. CSKA hosted the game in Virton due to lack of diplomatic relations between the USSR and Israel at the time. The victory is widely considered as pivotal in Maccabi&#x27;s history, thus making the town&#x27;s name widely known among Israeli sports fans.

==Canadian friendship==
Virton, Florenville, and many other neighbouring villages were the homes of many Canadian families whose fathers/husbands were stationed nearby at RCAF Station No. 1 (F) Wing, in Marville, France. Prior to moving the base to Lahr, Germany, there were ceremonies in these towns and in Longuyon, France (Permanent Married Quarters), where the Canadians left three small &#x27;thunderbird&#x27; totem poles. These totems are still there and were rededicated in September 2005 on the 50th anniversary of the opening of the base.

<doc id="176232" wikidata="Q223237" url="?curid=176232" title="SEPECAT Jaguar">
<text>The SEPECAT Jaguar is a British-French supersonic jet attack aircraft originally used by the British Royal Air Force and the French Air Force in the close air support and nuclear strike role. As of 2025, the Jaguar remains in service with the Indian Air Force.

Originally conceived in the 1960s as a jet trainer with a light ground attack capability, the requirement for the aircraft soon changed to include supersonic performance, reconnaissance and tactical nuclear strike roles. A carrier-based variant was also planned for French Navy service, but this was cancelled in favour of the cheaper, fully French-built Dassault-Breguet Super Étendard. The aircraft were manufactured by SEPECAT (&quot;Société Européenne de Production de l&#x27;avion Ecole de Combat et d&#x27;Appui Tactique&quot;), a joint venture between Breguet and the British Aircraft Corporation, one of the first major joint British-French military aircraft programmes.

The Jaguar was exported to India, Oman, Ecuador and Nigeria. The aircraft was used in numerous conflicts and military operations in Mauritania, Chad, Iraq, Bosnia, and Pakistan, as well as providing a ready nuclear delivery platform for the United Kingdom, France, and India throughout the latter half of the Cold War and beyond. In the Gulf War, the Jaguar was praised for its reliability and was a valuable coalition resource. The aircraft served with the French Air Force as the main strike/attack aircraft until 1 July 2005, and with the Royal Air Force until the end of April 2007. Its role was replaced by the Eurofighter Typhoon in the RAF and the Dassault Rafale in the French Air Force.

==Development==
===Background===

The Jaguar programme began in the early 1960s, in response to a British requirement (Air Staff Target 362) for an advanced supersonic jet trainer to replace the Folland Gnat T1 and Hawker Hunter T7, and a French requirement (the &quot;École de Combat et d&#x27;Appui Tactique&quot;, ECAT &quot;tactical combat support trainer&quot;) for a cheap, subsonic dual role trainer and light attack aircraft to replace the Fouga Magister, Lockheed T-33 and Dassault Mystère IV. In both countries several companies tendered designs: BAC, Hunting, Hawker Siddeley and Folland in Britain; Breguet, Potez, Sud-Aviation, Nord, and Dassault from France. A Memorandum of Understanding was signed in May 1965 for the two countries to develop two aircraft, a trainer based on the ECAT, and the larger AFVG (British-French Variable Geometry).

Cross-channel negotiations led to the formation of SEPECAT (&quot;Société Européenne de Production de l&#x27;Avion d&#x27;École de Combat et d&#x27;Appui Tactique&quot; – the &quot;European company for the production of a combat trainer and tactical support aircraft&quot;) in 1966 as a joint venture between Breguet and the British Aircraft Corporation to produce the airframe. Though based in part on the Breguet Br.121, using the same basic configuration and an innovative French-designed landing gear, the Jaguar was built incorporating major elements of design from BAC, notably the wing and high lift devices.

Production of components would be split between Breguet and BAC, and the aircraft themselves would be assembled on two production lines; one in the UK and one in France, To avoid any duplication of work, each aircraft component had only one source. The British light strike/tactical support versions were the most demanding design, requiring supersonic performance, superior avionics, a cutting edge nav/attack system of more accuracy and complexity than the French version, moving map display, laser range-finder and marked-target seeker (LRMTS). As a result, the initial Br.121 design needed a thinner wing, redesigned fuselage, a higher rear cockpit, and after-burning engines. The British design departed from the French sub-sonic Breguet 121 to such a degree that it was effectively a new design.

A separate partnership was formed between Rolls-Royce and Turbomeca to develop the Adour afterburning turbofan engine. The Br.121 was proposed with Turbomeca&#x27;s Tourmalet engine for ECAT but Breguet preferred the RR RB.172 and their joint venture would use elements of both. The new engine, which would be used for the AFVG as well, would be built in Derby and Tarnos.

Previous collaborative efforts between Britain and France had been complicated – the AFVG programme ended in cancellation, and controversy surrounded the development of the supersonic airliner Concorde. Whilst the technical collaboration between BAC and Breguet went well, when Dassault took over Breguet in 1971 it encouraged acceptance of its own designs, such as the Super Étendard naval attack aircraft and the Mirage F1, for which it would receive more profit, over the British-French Jaguar.

The initial plan was for Britain to buy 150 Jaguar &quot;B&quot; trainers, with its strike requirements being met by the advanced BAC-Dassault AFVG aircraft, with France to buy 75 &quot;E&quot; trainers (&quot;école&quot;) and 75 &quot;A&quot; single-seat strike attack aircraft (&quot;appui&quot;). Dassault favoured its own Mirage G aircraft above the collaborative AFVG, and in June 1967, France cancelled the AFVG on cost grounds. This left a gap in the RAF&#x27;s planned strike capabilities for the 1970s; at the same time as France&#x27;s cancellation of the AFVG, Germany was expressing a serious interest in the Jaguar, and thus the design became more oriented towards the low-level strike role.

With the cancellation of both the BAC TSR-2 tactical strike aircraft and Hawker Siddeley P.1154 supersonic V/STOL fighter, the RAF were looking increasingly hard at their future light strike needs and realizing that they now needed more than just advanced trainers with some secondary counter insurgency capability. At this point, the RAF&#x27;s proposed strike fleet was to be the American General Dynamics F-111s plus the AFVG for lighter strike purposes. There was concern that both F-111 and AFVG were high risk projects and with the French already planning on a strike role for the Jaguar, there was an opportunity to introduce a credible backup plan for the RAF&#x27;s future strike needs – the Jaguar. As a result, by October 1970, the RAF&#x27;s requirements had changed to 165 single-seat strike aircraft and 35 trainers.

The Jaguar was to replace the McDonnell Douglas Phantom FGR2 in the close air support, tactical reconnaissance and tactical strike roles, freeing the Phantom to be used for air defence. Both the French and British trainer requirements had developed significantly, and were eventually fulfilled instead by the Alpha Jet and Hawker Siddeley Hawk respectively. The French, meanwhile, had chosen the Jaguar to replace the &quot;Aeronavale&quot;&#x27;s Dassault Étendard IV, and increased their order to include an initial 40 of a carrier-capable maritime version of the Jaguar, the Jaguar M. From these apparently disparate aims would come a single and entirely different aircraft: relatively high-tech, supersonic, and optimised for ground-attack in a high-threat environment.

===Prototypes===
The first of eight prototypes flew on 8 September 1968, a two-seat design fitted with the first production model Adour engine. This aircraft went supersonic on its third flight but was lost on landing on 26 March 1970 following an engine fire. The second prototype flew in February 1969; a total of three prototypes flew at the Paris Air Show that year. The first French &quot;A&quot; prototype flew in March 1969. In October a British &quot;S&quot; conducted its first flight.
A Jaguar M prototype flew in November 1969. This had a strengthened airframe, an arrestor hook and different undercarriage: twin nosewheel and single mainwheels. After testing in France it went to RAE at Thurleigh for carrier landing trials from their land based catapult, after which, in July 1970, it underwent a series of shipboard trials from the French carrier &quot;Clemenceau&quot;. From these trials there were doubts about the throttle response in case of an aborted landing. The shipboard testing also revealed problems with the aircraft&#x27;s handling when flying on one engine, although planned engine improvements were to have rectified these problems. The &quot;M&quot; was considered a suitable replacement for the Etendard IV but the &quot;Aeronavale&quot; would only be able to afford 60 instead of 100 aircraft.

In 1971, Dassault proposed the Super Étendard, claiming that it was a simpler and cheaper development of the existing Étendard IV, and in 1973, the French Navy ordered it instead of the Jaguar. However, rising costs meant that only 71 of the planned 100 Super Étendards were purchased. The M was cancelled by the French government in 1973.

==Design==
===Overview===

The Jaguar is an orthodox single-seat, swept-wing, twin-engine monoplane design, with tall tricycle-type retractable landing gear. In its original configuration, it had a maximum take-off weight in the 15 tonne class; with a combat radius on internal fuel of , giving the Jaguar a greater operational range than competitor aircraft such as the Mikoyan MiG-27. The aircraft had hardpoints fitted for an external weapons load of up to 10,000 lb (4,500 kg). Typical weapons fitted included the Matra LR.F2 rocket pod, BAP 100-mm bombs, Martel AS.37 anti-radar missiles, AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles, and Rockeye cluster bombs. The RAF&#x27;s Jaguars gained several new weapons during the Gulf War, including CRV7 high-velocity rockets and American CBU-87 cluster bombs. Finally, the Jaguar was equipped with either a pair of 30 mm autocannon - the French DEFA cannon, or British ADEN cannon.

The Jaguar International had the unusual option of overwing pylons, used for short-range air-to-air missiles, such as the Matra R550 Magic or the Sidewinder. This option freed up the under-wing pylons for other weapons and stores. RAF Jaguars gained overwing pylons in the buildup to Operation Granby in 1990, but French Jaguars were not modified.

===Engine===

The SEPECAT Jaguar is powered by the Rolls-Royce Turbomeca Adour turbofan engine, which was developed in parallel with, and primarily for the Jaguar. A separate partnership was formed between Rolls-Royce and Turbomeca to develop the Adour, a two-shaft turbofan engine with afterburner. Twin engines were selected for survivability. Ease of maintenance was major consideration, an engine change being possible within 30 minutes. For the Jaguars it needed a low bypass capable of high thrust for take off, supersonic flight and low level &quot;dashes&quot;.

When the first prototype Jaguar flew on 8 September 1968, it was also the first flight for the engine. In its initial development the Adour engine had complications with the stability of the afterburner system, and shipboard testing showed slow throttle response times, problematic in the situation of an aborted landing; engine improvements rectified these problems prior to the Jaguar coming into service. In French service, the Jaguars were introduced using the original Mk.101 engine. RAF Jaguars entered service using the Mk.102 engine, mainly featuring better afterburner-throttle control over the Mk.101. The RAF later had its Jaguars re-engined around 1981 with the improved Adour Mk.104, and again in 1999 with the Mk.106, each providing greater performance.

The Adour was developed into both afterburning and non-afterburning models; the Hawk, which had beaten the Jaguar to fulfill the Air Staff Target 362 trainer requirement, also used the non-afterburning Adour engine. Other applications include the McDonnell Douglas T-45 Goshawk, the Mitsubishi T-2, and derived Mitsubishi F-1.

===Avionics===

From the outset the Jaguar was equipped with a navigation and attack system. While A versions had a reliable double gyroscopic system and a Doppler radar derived from the Mirage IIIE, the GR1s had a totally new digital system with an inertial navigation system and a heads-up display, plus a Laser Ranging and Marked Targeting System (LRMTS) in the nose. These systems were a step above the current technology of the time, but reliability was quite low.

There were many more systems added with the time, like the Atlis II in the French aircraft, and, in 1994–95, some GR1s had laser-designator systems fitted. Missiles like AS-30 and the anti-ship Sea Eagle were added. Some IAF aircraft had the Agave radar system, purposely for maritime strike. India later developed the DARIN system in its Jaguar fleet, with a modern 1553 databus.

Although in operational theatres such as the Gulf War the Jaguar proved to be mechanically more reliable than the Panavia Tornado, the aircraft&#x27;s avionics were a hindrance to conducting missions. Owing to the Jaguar A&#x27;s shortcomings in navigation and target acquisition, French Jaguars had to be escorted by Mirage F1CR reconnaissance aircraft to act as guides. The Jaguar provided a valuable component of the campaign, the RAF detachment of 12 Jaguars flew 612 combat sorties, with no aircraft lost.

Significant changes were made both during and shortly after the war. Owing to obsolete navigational systems being unable to provide the accuracy required, both French and British Jaguars were quickly modified with Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, a recent technology at the time. Prior to Operation Deliberate Force, the 1995 NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a dozen Jaguars were upgraded with the capability to carry the TIALD laser designator pod and redesignated &quot;Jaguar GR1B&quot; or &quot;T2B&quot; respectively. Shortly afterwards, the RAF upgraded its Jaguar fleet to a common standard, incorporating TIALD and the ability to use new reconnaissance pods. The interim GR3 (&quot;Jaguar 96&quot;) upgrade added a new HUD, a new hand controller and stick top, integrated GPS and TERPROM Terrain Referenced Navigation. The further upgraded &quot;Jaguar GR3A&quot; introduced the new EO GP1 (JRP) digital reconnaissance pod, a helmet-mounted sight, improved cockpit displays, a datalink, and improved night vision goggles compatibility.

A single Jaguar was converted into the Jaguar Active Control Technology (ACT) with fly-by-wire controls and aerodynamic alterations to the airframe; the aerodynamic instability improved manoeuvrability and the test data was used in the development of the Eurofighter.

==Operational history==
===France===
The French Air Force took delivery of the first production Jaguar in 1973, one of an eventual 160 single-seat Jaguar As. For type conversion training, France also took 40 of the two-seat &quot;Jaguar E&quot;. While the Jaguar was capable of carrying a single AN-52 nuclear bomb, the French government did not assign any Jaguars for use in the &quot;Force de frappe&quot;, France&#x27;s strategic nuclear deterrent. Nuclear armed Jaguars were instead assigned the &quot;Pre-Strategic&quot; role, to clear a path for the Strategic strike force. The AN-52 nuclear bomb was retired from service in September 1991, when the formerly nuclear-armed squadrons of Escadre de Chasse 7 then concentrated on conventional attack. French Jaguars also performed in the role of electronic counter measures (ECM) aircraft, bearing the Martel anti-radiation missile, capable of staying airborne to suppress enemy defences for long periods of time through mid air refuelling.

In French service, the Jaguar was frequently deployed in defence of national interests in Africa during the 1970s, a policy sometimes referred to as &quot;Jaguar diplomacy&quot; (&quot;la diplomatie du Jaguar&quot;). Jaguars made their combat debut against Polisario Front forces in Mauritania in December 1977, as part of Opération Lamantin. In August 1978 a conventionally armed rapid reaction squadron was established, intended to deploy in support of French forces and interests anywhere in the world.

France had been involved in the conflict in Chad for many years, and 2,000 men of the &quot;Force d&#x27;Intervention&quot; along with helicopters and Jaguars were deployed to defend central Chad in 1978; further forces arrived later as part of Opération Tacaud. The Jaguars were engaged in May and June 1978, contributing significantly in halting an offensive by Goukouni Oueddei&#x27;s FROLINAT forces, who were routed. One aircraft was shot down, but the pilot was recovered by helicopter.

In support of the further military action in the region, known as Operation Manta, Jaguars were deployed to Bangui, Central African Republic, in 1983, before being rebased inside Chad at N&#x27;Djamena International Airport. On 25 January 1984, Jaguars attacked a rebel column that was withdrawing after raiding the town of Zigey. One aircraft was shot down and the pilot, Captain Michel Croci, was killed. The &quot;Manta&quot; forces were withdrawn in 1984, as part of a de-escalation agreement, whereby both Libyan and French forces were to be withdrawn from Chad. The Libyans did not respect the agreement, and Jaguars returned to Chad in 1986, as part of Operation Epervier, this time with a more forceful role. On 16 February 1986, 11 Jaguars, escorted by Mirage F1 fighters and supported by Boeing C-135F tankers and Breguet Atlantic aircraft, launched a raid on the airfield at Wadi Doum, which the Libyans had constructed in Northern Chad, using BAP-100 anti-runway bombs. In response to Libyan incursions, another strike was carried out on 7 January 1987, when a Jaguar destroyed a Libyan radar with a Martel missile. The Jaguars stationed at Ndjamena were a target for Libyan sabotage owing to their effectiveness against enemy forces, but the attempts were unsuccessful.

====Persian Gulf War====
France committed military assets to the Gulf War coalition; in October 1990, eight Jaguar A aircraft and several Mirage F1CR reconnaissance aircraft were sent to the Middle East. The Mirages, which had more advanced avionics, acted as guides for the Jaguars. Because their obsolete navigational systems were unable to provide the accuracy required, both French and British Jaguars were quickly modified with GPS receivers; RAF Tornados also had to be modified, but to a lesser extent. The French Jaguar force in Saudi Arabia grew to a maximum of 28 aircraft and carried out 615 combat sorties, during which one Jaguar was damaged by an Iraqi surface-to-air missile. Typical targets were Iraqi armoured units, Scud missile sites, and naval vessels.

On 17 January 1991, 12 French Jaguars bombed Ahmad al-Jaber Air Base, Kuwait; three were damaged in the attack but all returned to base. On 26 January, RAF Jaguars and Tornados raided several Silkworm missile batteries in Kuwait to encourage the perception of an imminent amphibious invasion to liberate the country. On the 30th, two RAF Jaguars destroyed a &quot;Polnochny&quot;-class landing ship with rockets and cannon. The Iraqi Republican Guard, entrenched on the Kuwait-Saudi border, were subjected to a continuous intensive bombing campaign for weeks to demoralise them, allied Jaguars forming a portion of the delivering aircraft. The Jaguars also performed valuable reconnaissance of the combat area for Coalition forces. Both nations&#x27; Jaguars were withdrawn from the region in March 1991, at the end of Desert Storm.

====Subsequent operations====
In Operation Deliberate Force in 1995, six Jaguars based in Italy conducted 63 strike missions. The last Jaguars in French service were retired in 2005, being replaced in the ground attack roles by the Dassault Rafale.

===United Kingdom===
The RAF accepted delivery of the first of 165 single seat Jaguar GR1s (the service designation of the Jaguar S) with No 54 (F) squadron in 1974. These were supplemented by 35 two seat trainers, the Jaguar T2 (previously &quot;Jaguar B&quot;). The Jaguar S and B had a more comprehensive nav/attack system than the A and E models used by the French Air Force, consisting of a Ferranti/Marconi Navigation and Weapon Aiming Sub System (NAVWASS) and a Plessey 10 Way Weapon Control System. RAF Jaguars were used for rapid deployment and regional reinforcement, and others flew in the tactical nuclear strike role, carrying the WE.177 bomb.

Beginning in 1975 with 6 Squadron, followed by 54 Squadron based at RAF Coltishall, and a &#x27;Shadow squadron&#x27;, 226 OCU based at RAF Lossiemouth, Jaguar squadrons were declared operational to SACEUR with the WE.177. 14 Squadron and 17 Squadron based at RAF Bruggen followed by 1977. 20 Squadron and 31 Squadron also based at RAF Bruggen brought the RAF Jaguar force to its peak strength of six squadrons plus the OCU, each of twelve aircraft equipped with eight WE.177s. Two further squadrons, 2 Squadron and 41 Squadron based at RAF Laarbruch and RAF Coltishall respectively, were primarily tasked with tactical reconnaissance. From 1975 the OCU&#x27;s wartime role was as an operational squadron in the front line assigned to SACEUR with 12 Jaguar aircraft, eight WE.177 nuclear bombs, and a variety of conventional weapons.

In April 1975, a single Jaguar was used to test the aircraft&#x27;s rough airstrip capacity, by landing and taking off multiple times from the M55 motorway, the final test flight was conducted with a full weapons load; the ability was never used in service but was considered useful as improvised runways might be the only runways left available in a large scale European conflict. In a high intensity European war, the role of the Jaguar was to support land forces on the continent in resisting a Soviet assault on Western Europe, striking targets beyond the forward edge of the battlefield should a conflict escalate. The apparent mismatch between aircraft numbers and nuclear bombs was a consequence of RAF staff planners concluding that there would be one third attrition of Jaguars in an early conventional phase, leaving the survivors numerically strong enough to deliver the allocated stockpile of 56 nuclear bombs.

From December 1983, 75 Jaguar GR1s and 14 T2s were updated to the GR1A and T2A standards with FIN1064 navigation and attack systems replacing the original NAVWASS. At about the same time, most were also re-engined with Adour 104 engines and were fitted with the ability to carry Sidewinder air to air missiles or AN-ALQ-101(V)-10 electronic countermeasures pods under the wings.

The RAF Jaguar force was altered in late 1984, when 17 Squadron, 20 Squadron and 31 Squadron exchanged their Jaguars for Tornado GR1s, although their assignment to SACEUR and their wartime role remained unchanged. The two other RAF Germany units, 14 Squadron and 2 Squadron, followed suit in 1985 and 1989 respectively, which left the operational Jaguar force concentrated in 6, 41 and 54 Squadrons at RAF Coltishall.

====1990 Gulf War====
Following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, on 9 August 1990 the British government assigned an initial 12 Jaguar GR1A and 12 Tornado F3 aircraft to the Middle East in Operation Granby, these aircraft operated from bases in Oman and Bahrain. On 23 August 1990, a squadron of Tornado GR1 interdictors were dispatched to the region as well, but the Tornado GR1 was difficult to keep operational in the high temperatures. Blackburn Buccaneers were dispatched in January 1991 to act as laser designators for the ground strike aircraft. The RAF&#x27;s Jaguars gained several new weapons during the Persian Gulf War, including CRV7 high-velocity rockets and American CBU-87 cluster bombs which were used because the RAF&#x27;s existing BL755 bombs were designed for low-level release, and therefore unsuitable for higher-altitude operations common over the Persian Gulf. The RAF&#x27;s detachment of 12 Jaguars flew 612 combat sorties, with no aircraft being lost. &quot;XZ364&quot; &quot;Sadman&quot; flew 47 missions; the highest number of missions of any aircraft.

====Subsequent upgrades====
In 1994, in order to meet an urgent need to increase the number of aircraft able to designate targets for laser-guided bombs, 10 GR1As and two T2As were upgraded with the capability to carry the TIALD laser designator pod and redesignated as &quot;Jaguar GR1B&quot; and &quot;T2B&quot; respectively. TIALD equipped Jaguar GR1Bs were deployed to Italy in August to take part in Operation Deliberate Force against Bosnian Serb forces, being used to designate targets for RAF Harriers. During the Bosnian operations, a Jaguar of 41 Squadron carried out the first RAF bombing raid in Europe since the end of the Second World War fifty years before.
Following the success of the GR1B/T2B upgrade, the RAF launched a plan to upgrade its Jaguar fleet to a common standard, incorporating improvements introduced to some aircraft during the Gulf War, together with adding the ability to use TIALD and new reconnaissance pods. The upgrade came in two parts; the interim GR3 (&quot;Jaguar 96&quot;) upgrade added a new HUD, a new hand controller and stick top, integrated GPS and TERPROM Terrain Referenced Navigation. It was delivered in two standards, for recce and TIALD. The further upgraded &quot;Jaguar GR3A&quot; (also known as &quot;Jaguar 97&quot;) introduced fleet-wide compatibility with TIALD and the new EO GP1 (JRP) digital reconnaissance pod, a helmet mounted sight, improved cockpit displays, a datalink, and improved night vision goggles compatibility. All GR3As were subsequently re-engined with the new Adour 106 turbofan. The RAF&#x27;s Jaguar 97s were intended to be wired for the carriage of ASRAAMs on the overwing launchers, but clearance of this weapon was never completed because of funding cuts.

The Jaguars did not see service in the 2003 Iraq War; they had been planned to operate from bases in Turkey, to the north of Iraq, but Turkey refused access to its airbases and the northern attack was cancelled.

Demands by the UK Treasury to cut the defence budget led to Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon detailing plans on 21 July 2004 to withdraw the Jaguar by 2007. An expected out of service date of October 2007 was brought forward at just five days notice to 30 April 2007. On 20 December 2007, a Jaguar operated by QinetiQ undertook the last British military Jaguar flight.

Following their retirement from flying service, many Jaguars continued to serve as ground instructional airframes, most notably at RAF Cosford, used in the training of RAF fitters.

===India===
India had been approached as a possible customer for the Jaguar as early as 1968, but had declined, partly on the grounds that it was not yet clear if the French and British would themselves accept the aircraft into service. India already had its Marut fighter-bomber, and tried to upgrade it with new engines, until the new project collapsed. A decade later IAF became the largest single export customer, with a $1 billion order for the aircraft in 1978, the Jaguar being chosen ahead of the Dassault Mirage F1 and the Saab Viggen after a long and difficult evaluation process. The order involved 40 Jaguars built in Europe at Warton, and 120 licence-built aircraft from Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) under the local name &quot;Shamsher&quot; (&quot;Sword of Justice&quot;).

As an interim measure, 18 RAF Jaguars were loaned to the IAF with the first two loaned aircraft operational with Western Air Command on 27 July 1979. The second batch of aircraft for the IAF were 40 Jaguar Internationals built at Warton, the first aircraft being delivered in March 1981. The third batch was the assembly of another 45 aircraft by HAL of kits shipped from the United Kingdom, the first kit being shipped to India in May 1981. In the following phases more aircraft were built in India with less European content. A total of 80 aircraft were built by HAL.

Indian Jaguars were quite different from the RAF ones. The Adour Mk 811 engines were soon adopted in the HAL production line (the previous Jaguars made in UK had the earlier Mk 804), giving 8,400 lbf each. There were R-550 Magic 1 or 2 in rails over the wings. But more importantly, the NAWASS, even if very modern in conception, was replaced because it was found quite unreliable. The RAF was already upgrading the system with the modern Ferranti Type 1024 INS, but India was offered the 1024E export, less powerful version. So IAF instead pursued the development of new nav-attack system, called DARIN, that combined several technologies from France, UK and other sources. This system was more reliable and more precise than the older NAWASS and all the IAF Jaguars had it as standard. The Jaguar was found to be a long-range, fast, stable and effective strike aircraft in IAF service. Another important upgrade was the Maritime Strike version, fitted with a radar (the French Agave) and powerful British anti-ship missiles, produced in a very limited number (12). The only real issue with Jaguar is the lack of power at altitude, especially with heavy ordnance on board.

Indian Jaguars were used to carry out reconnaissance missions in support of the Indian Peace Keeping Force in Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1990. They later played an active role in the 1999 Kargil War with Pakistan, dropping both unguided and laser-guided bombs, the IAF defining its role as a &quot;deep penetrating strike aircraft&quot;. The Jaguar is also used in small numbers for the anti-ship role, equipped with the Sea Eagle missile. The Jaguar remains an important element of the Indian military as, along with the Mirage 2000, the Jaguar has been described as one of the few aircraft capable of performing the nuclear strike role with reasonable chances of success. It has been alleged that the Indian military decided against developing the Jaguar into an active nuclear platform because of its lack of ground clearance for deploying India&#x27;s gravity-dropped nuclear bombs.

As the aircraft aged, the avionics were viewed as lacking suitable components for the ground attack mission, such as terrain-following radar, GPS navigation or modern night-flight systems; consequently, several upgrades were carried out in the mid-1990s, including the addition of the Litening targeting pod. India placed an order for 17 additional upgraded Jaguar aircraft from Hindustan Aeronautics in 1999 and a further 20 in 2001–2002. The IAF plans to upgrade up to 125 Jaguars starting in 2013 by upgrading the avionics (including multi mode radar, auto-pilot and other changes) as part of the DARIN III programme and is considering fitting more powerful engines, Honeywell F125IN, to improve performance, particularly at medium altitudes.
The latest upgrade program DARIN III (Display Attack Ranging Inertial Navigation) has also been approved. In addition to new avionics and equipment installed as part of DARIN II upgrade, DARIN III featured modified avionics architecture, new cockpit with dual SMD, solid state flight data recorder and solid state video recording system, auto pilot system, integration of new multi-mode radar on Jaguar IS (currently only Jaguar IM are fitted with radars). Major structural modification was carried out on the air frame to accommodate the radar. Initial Jaguars delivered to the IAF were powered by two Adour 804E; further deliveries were powered by Adour Mk811. All the current IAF Jaguars are powered by Adour Mk811. DARIN III upgrade will cause additional weight problems due to addition of new avionics and radar, resulting in it becoming underpowered. Later IAF took decisions not to upgrade the engines due to budget problems. As part of technology transfer agreement with Israeli Aerospace Industries (IAI) for 54 EL/M-2052 AESA radar to be manufactured by HAL Avionics Division, the first production version will be ready by March 2021 to be fitted on Jaguar IS as part of DARIN III UPG standard.

In 2018, India cannibalised 31 airframes purchased from France, 2 airframes from UK and Oman each, few engines and several hundred types of critically needed spares for optimum squadron serviceability.

Indian Air Force plans to retire the oldest batch of 60 aircraft from 2028 to 2031 and replace them with modern 4.5 generation aircraft like HAL Tejas Mk1A. IAF will upgrade the rest of the Jaguars to DARIN III configuration, EL/M-2052 AESA radar and ASRAAM air-to-air missile integration. As of 2024, 60 aircraft (more than half of the Jaguar fleet) is being upgraded to DARIN III standards.

===Other operators===

In 1969, while still in the prototype stage of development, formal approaches had been made to Switzerland, India, Japan, Australia, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany, promoting the aircraft for sale. Japan began negotiations towards licensed production of the Jaguar, but these plans failed in part because of the high royalty payments sought by SEPECAT. A proposal for Turkey to construct Jaguars under licence also did not come to fruition. Kuwait initially ordered 50 Jaguars and 16 Mirage 5s, but instead chose F1s. Pakistan approached SEPECAT after the US refused to sell its aircraft of choice, the LTV A-7 Corsair II, due to an arms embargo; Pakistan eventually opted for Mirage 5s.

Jaguars were successfully sold to a number of overseas countries, India being the largest operator. The &quot;Jaguar International&quot; was an export version which was sold to Ecuador, Nigeria and Oman. The Ecuadorian Air Force, the only Latin American export customer, purchased 10 single- and 2 two-seat variants, officially designated &quot;Jaguars ES&quot; and &quot;EB&quot;, respectively. The first of twelve aircraft arrived in January 1977. They were used mainly for ground attack roles and occasionally for air superiority duties during the Cenepa War with Peru in 1995, but the main part of the fleet was held in reserve in case of a wider conflict with the Peruvians. Nigeria ordered 13 single-seat &quot;SN&quot; and 5 two-seat &quot;BN&quot; variants; SEPECAT delivered the first of these in May 1984. A subsequent order for an 18-aircraft second batch was cancelled. Some of those in service were withdrawn from operations on the grounds of economy, with the remaining aircraft put up for re-sale. The Royal Air Force of Oman ordered 10 single-seat and 2 two-seat variants, designated &quot;Jaguars OS&quot; and &quot;OB&quot;, respectively; the first was delivered in March 1977. A second identical 12-aircraft order was placed in the mid-1980s; these were joined by two secondhand Indian and RAF examples. The last of the Omani aircraft were retired on 6 August 2014.

<text>Farrah are a British indie rock band. They have released four studio albums since 2001 and toured internationally since their formation.

==History==
After releasing their debut single &quot;Terry&quot; on the indie Noisebox Records label in the UK they were signed to The Police manager Miles Copeland III&#x27;s Ark 21 Records for the release of their debut album, &quot;Moustache&quot;. The album was released in the UK, US, Europe and Japan and saw the band tour the world extensively to support it. When Ark21 shut down operation in the UK, their second album &quot;Me Too&quot;, was released on various independent labels throughout the world.

Farrah have maintained their independent status ever since. Recording at their own South London recording studio, producing their own videos and managing their online presence.

In late 2006, Farrah completed their third album, &quot;Cut Out and Keep&quot;. It was released in 2007 in the UK, Spain and Japan and accompanied by a world tour.

In early 2007, Farrah began working with the Japanese pop rock artist Kaela Kimura. They composed two songs for her, and she covered their song, &quot;No Reason Why&quot;. One of Japan&#x27;s leading rock bands, Asian Kung-Fu Generation invited Farrah to appear at the Nano-Mugen Festival on two occasions.

In 2009, they released their self-titled fourth album in Japan with former Cotton Mather drummer Dana Myzer in its lineup. The album, with a slightly different track listing, was released in the rest of the world in May 2010.

Farrah&#x27;s cover of Europe&#x27;s &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; was included on Engine Room Recordings 2011 compilation album, &quot;Guilt by Association Vol. 3&quot;.

Farrah co-founder Andrew Campbell also owns and runs the indie record label Lojinx.

==Jez Ashurst==
The lead singer of Farrah, Jez Ashurst, is also a producer and songwriter. In 2015 he worked with Shane Filan from Irish pop band Westlife for two tracks on the &quot;Right Here&quot; album, where it charted No. 1 in Irish Albums Chart.

Jez Ashurst has also written songs recorded by Gabrielle Aplin, Boyzone, Will Young, the Click Five, Natalie Bassingthwaighte, Brian McFadden, Hanson, Little Mix and Cliff Richard. He has also written with Maisie Peters and Tom Walker

<text>Claude Servais Mathias Pouillet (16 February 1790 – 14 June 1868) was a French physicist and a professor of physics at the Sorbonne and member of the French Academy of Sciences (elected 1837).

== Biography ==
He studied sciences at the École normale supérieure (Paris), and from 1829 to 1849 was associated with the Conservatoire national des arts et métiers, first as a professor, and beginning in 1832, an administrator. After the death of Pierre Louis Dulong in 1838, he attained the chair of physics at the Faculty of Sciences. For a brief period of time, he was chair of physics at the École Polytechnique (1831), where he was succeeded by César Despretz in 1831 and Gabriel Lamé in 1832.

In 1852, he was compulsorily retired from the Faculty of Sciences because he refused to swear an oath of allegiance to the imperial government that took power in late 1851.

== Scientific research ==
The Pouillet effect was named after the phenomenon that he published in 1822 on the heat produced by the wetting of dry sand.

He developed a pyrheliometer and made, between 1837 and 1838, the first quantitative measurements of the solar constant. His estimate was 1228 W/m2, very close to the current estimate of 1367 W/m2. Using the Dulong-Petit law inappropriately, he estimated the temperature of the Sun&#x27;s surface to be around 1800 °C. This value was corrected in 1879 to 5430 °C by Jožef Stefan (1835–1893).

He published works on optics, electricity, magnetism, meteorology, photography and photometry. In the field of optics he conducted investigations of diffraction phenomena. In his studies of electricity, he designed sine and tangent galvanometers. Pouillet developed and corrected Joseph Fourier&#x27;s work on the surface temperature of the earth, developing the first real mathematical treatment of the greenhouse effect. He speculated that water vapour and carbon dioxide might trap infrared radiation in the atmosphere, warming the earth enough to support plant and animal life.

His acclaimed textbook on physics and meteorology, &quot;Éléments de physique expérimentale et de météorologie&quot;, was published in four parts. Also, it was translated into German by Johann Heinrich Jakob Müller, and published with the title, &quot;Lehrbuch der Physik und Meteorologie&quot;.

Svante Arrhenius (1896) cited a great deal of Pouillet&#x27;s work.

<doc id="176237" wikidata="Q6984069" url="?curid=176237" title="Neal Boortz">
<text>Neal A Boortz Jr. (born April 6, 1945) is an American author, former attorney, and former libertarian radio host. His nationally syndicated talk show, &quot;The Neal Boortz Show&quot;, which ended in 2013, was carried throughout the United States. The content of the show included politics, current events, social issues, and topics of interest, which Boortz discussed with callers, correspondents, and guests. Boortz touched on many controversial topics.

Boortz&#x27;s first involvement with radio was in the 1960s, while he was a student at Texas A&amp;M University, working as a local on-air personality at WTAW. After moving to Georgia, he became an avid listener of Atlanta&#x27;s first talk radio station. Boortz became a regular caller to the morning talk show. When the show&#x27;s host died, it created a job opening, which Boortz actively pursued. He was initially hired on a two-week &quot;trial run&quot;, and later offered the permanent position. Boortz attended law school, earning a law degree in 1977. For some years he worked as both an attorney and as a talk show host. He eventually closed his law practice after 17 years to concentrate on his work in radio.

Boortz has received many industry accolades. He was named as one of the &quot;25 Most Important Radio Talk Show Hosts in America&quot; by &quot;Talkers&quot; magazine, and one of &quot;Georgia&#x27;s 100 Most Influential People&quot; by &quot;Georgia Trend&quot;. In 2009, Boortz was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame.

Boortz&#x27;s first book was &quot;The Commencement Speech You Need To Hear&quot; in 1997, followed by &quot;The Terrible Truth About Liberals&quot;, in 1998. In 2005, he co-wrote &quot;The FairTax Book&quot; with Congressman John Linder, proposing to implement a variant of a national retail sales tax in lieu of other federal taxes. Boortz&#x27;s involvement with the FairTax is covered in the documentary film &quot;An Inconvenient Tax&quot;.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===
Boortz was born in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, his mother&#x27;s home. His father was a Marine Corps pilot, who served in World War II, the Korean War and Vietnam War. Describing himself as a &quot;military brat&quot;, Boortz lived in many locations throughout the country (including the small community of Thrall, Texas). He spent his first two years of high school at Tustin Union High School in Tustin, California. The family then moved to Florida. Boortz graduated from Pensacola High School, in 1963. He attended Texas A&amp;M University, but did not graduate. Boortz later attended John Marshall Law School, in Atlanta, Georgia, graduating in 1977 and passing the Georgia bar.

== Careers ==
===Law school and radio===
Boortz began his radio career in College Station, Texas in the 1960s at WTAW, under the name of Randy Neal, while attending Texas A&amp;M University. In 1967, after leaving Texas, Boortz moved to Atlanta and landed a sales job. For two years he worked at Rich&#x27;s Department Store, where he sold jewelry and carpeting. He later recollected that one of his customers was Martin Luther King Jr. During that time, Boortz was an avid listener of AM 680 WRNG (now WCNN). The station called itself &quot;Ring Radio,&quot; as in the ring of a telephone. It was Atlanta&#x27;s first talk radio station. Boortz listened to morning talk show host, Herb Elfman, and soon became a devotee. &quot;Boortz bombarded Elfman with calls, reading him little scripts he&#x27;d scribbled.&quot;

While watching the news one evening, he heard that Elfman had committed suicide. The next morning, Boortz showed up at the front door of WRNG and announced that he was ready to take Elfman&#x27;s place. Even though the management told him that &quot;they were going to search for a &#x27;qualified&#x27; host to take his place,&quot; Boortz was offered the role of temporary two-week replacement. In the interim, the evening host was moved to mornings and Boortz hosted the evening time slot. Two weeks later, Boortz was moved to the morning show, embarking on an Atlanta talk radio career that spanned more than forty years. Boortz honed his skills at the tiny 1,000-watt station, and even wrote a few speeches for then Georgia Governor Lester Maddox. He continued working at the station until 1974, when WRNG &quot;dumped him.&quot; He was offered a job at radio station WGY in Schenectady, New York, but turned the offer down to return to Atlanta and enroll in law school.
In 1974, Boortz enrolled in then-unaccredited John Marshall Law School (Atlanta) going to class in his spare time, while he and his wife Donna worked full-time loading mail trucks. Boortz credits his wife with providing &quot;the money to keep me in law school.&quot; After graduating from law school in 1977, Boortz practiced law in a solo law firm from 1977 through 1993. During that period, he divided his time between his law practice and work in radio. One of Boortz&#x27;s clients was boxer Evander Holyfield. Holyfield later sued Boortz and other members of his management team in the aftermath of a failed Subaru car dealership investment. Boortz told Atlanta Magazine &quot;It had nothing to do with representing him as a boxer. It was settled and disappeared.&quot; Some time later, in a heated on-air exchange between Atlanta mayor Bill Campbell and Boortz, Campbell remarked on the Holyfield relationship: &quot;Campbell (sarcastically): By the way, Neal, Evander Holyfield sends his regards ... We talked a little about how good he&#x27;s doing now and the fact he&#x27;s getting ready to open up his 57,000 square-foot, $20 million home. How he&#x27;s fighting for $35 million a fight. I was sorta thinking about when you were representing him. He was living in an apartment over on Lenox Road. He was fighting for about $20,000 a fight. It&#x27;s sort of interesting how your great legal skills have transferred into financial well-being for Evander . ... &quot; Boortz responded by calling mayor Campbell an &quot;unethical son of a bitch.&quot; Boortz later remarked &quot;It&#x27;s the only time I&#x27;ve ever been on the air that I lost control.&quot; In 1993, Boortz closed his law practice and devoted his full-time to his radio career.

=== Full-time radio career ===
While in law school, Boortz returned to work at WRNG. In 1983 he moved to the larger news-talk radio station WGST. He later recounted how he would often go into work at his law office at 5 a.m., work there for several hours, then go to WGST, and finally back to the law office until 11:00 p.m. In 1992, Boortz asked WGST for a raise; a salary equal to his combined income as an attorney and a radio host. When WGST refused, Boortz left. He got his raise when he signed an exclusive contract with AM 750 WSB to host a weekday radio show. Shortly after that, he closed his law office. In 1995, Talkers Magazine named Boortz one of the &quot;25 Most Important Radio Talk Show Hosts in America&quot;. That same year, &quot;Georgia Trend&quot; magazine added Boortz to its list of the &quot;100 Most Powerful &amp; Influential People in Georgia&quot;
In 1999, his show became nationally syndicated through WSB&#x27;s owner Cox Radio. The show continued to be based in Atlanta. &quot;The Neal Boortz Show&quot; featured Boortz, producers Belinda Skelton and Royal Marshall, interviews, and callers. On the air and on his website, Boortz admonished his listeners to take no heed nor place any credence in anything he said, presenting himself as merely an &quot;entertainer.&quot; As an entertainer, Boortz was a 2002 NAB Marconi Radio Awards finalist and Radio &amp; Records NewsTalk Personality of the Year for 2002.

In 2007, Boortz and his radio show were awarded &quot;Best Radio On-Air Personality&quot; and &quot;Best Radio Program, Any Type&quot; by The Georgia Association of Broadcasters. He was also a recipient of the Georgia Radio Hall of Fame 2007 Career Achievement Award. The &quot;Neal Boortz Show&quot; originated from the nation&#x27;s ninth largest radio market and was ranked the sixth overall most listened to radio program in the country. In 2008, Boortz was a finalist for the National Association of Broadcasters &quot;Marconi Award&quot; as the nation&#x27;s best syndicated radio personality. (The award went to Glenn Beck).

Boortz was inducted in the National Radio Hall of Fame in 2009.

Boortz retired from full-time radio work in 2013.
=== Author ===

Boortz&#x27;s first foray into authorship was in 1997 with &quot;The Commencement Speech You Need To Hear&quot;, in which he delivers his opinions on various topics in the form of a commencement speech he would give to new college graduates, if ever invited to do so. His second book, entitled &quot;The Terrible Truth About Liberals&quot;, was published in 1998, and contains reprinted material from his first book, along with a significant amount of new material.

His third book (co-authored by Georgia Congressman John Linder) entitled &quot;The FairTax Book&quot;, explains the proposal to implement a national retail sales tax in lieu of the federal income taxes, payroll taxes, estate tax, etc. The hardcover version held the #1 non-fiction spot on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list for the last two weeks of August 2005 and remained in the top ten for seven weeks. The paperback released in May 2006 contains additional information, an afterword and several revisions of misstatements made in the hardcover edition. It also spent several weeks on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list. Boortz claims to have donated 100% of his royalties from the FairTax book to charity and has commented on his radio show that he has not made one cent from the book. As of July 2006, Boortz claims his charitable donations from book proceeds exceed one hundred thousand US dollars. 

His fourth book entitled &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Gotta Say It&quot; was released on February 20, 2007, and debuted at #2 spot on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list, second only to Barack Obama&#x27;s &quot;Audacity of Hope&quot;. He occasionally writes columns on the Internet news/commentary site &quot;Townhall.com&quot; and other online magazines.

His 2008 book is titled &quot;&quot;. This book attempts to answer the critics of the Fair Tax proposal and claims to correct some of its myths and misrepresentations. It achieved #4 on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for the week of March 2, 2008 for paperback nonfiction.

After Boortz retired from talk radio in January 21, 2013, &quot;Maybe I Should Just Shut Up and Go Away!&quot; was published in hardcover by Carpenter&#x27;s Son Publishing in Franklin Tennessee.

===Retirement===
After Boortz retired from full-time radio work in 2013, he hosted commentaries for WSB for six more years, until they were discontinued by station. 

In January 2022, Boortz returned to radio part-time on WFOM (1230 AM, &quot;Xtra 106.3&quot; FM) in Atlanta, Georgia. Boortz pre-records &quot;The Boortz Report&quot;, a commentary that is aired several times each weekday, and appears on the station at least once a week for live segments with the local morning hosts.

== Political beliefs ==

Boortz is a self-described libertarian. He advocates a complete overhaul of the U.S. tax system and the release of all non-violent drug offenders who are currently in prison. He has supported Republican candidates and Republican tax policy, though he occasionally clashes with Republicans on social issues. Others describe his political views as being more in line with &quot;republitarian&quot; philosophy that embraces incrementalism domestically, and a generally interventionist foreign policy based on self-interest, national defense and the expansion of freedom. Boortz disagrees with the Libertarian Party platform on several key issues including his firm support of the war in Iraq, incremental tax reform, and his opposition to the unrestricted immigration policy advocated by the Libertarian Party.

Boortz criticizes the major parties saying &quot;I believe that the principal difference between the Democrats and the Republicans is that the Democrats just want to grow our Imperial Federal Government a bit faster than the Republicans do.&quot; He sides with liberals on some social issues such as abortion, same-sex marriage, and civil liberties. He agrees with fiscal conservatives in advocating less government spending and decreasing corporate regulation. He is an advocate for freedom of speech. In line with the traditional views of the Libertarian Party, Boortz supports eliminating the War on Drugs, and emphasizing personal responsibility. He has repeatedly stated his belief that global climate change is not man-made. His stances on many of these issues make him popular among conservative Republicans, who, due to their larger numbers in comparison to Libertarians, make up the majority of his listeners and callers.

Boortz&#x27;s post-9/11 platforms include support for the US-led War on Terror, a more aggressive foreign policy, and the USA Patriot Act. He is also strongly in favor of a crackdown on illegal immigration, including harsh penalties for businesses who employ persons here illegally. These views occasionally put him in conflict with the Libertarian Party. Justin Raimondo of Antiwar.com has called Boortz a &quot;statist, not a libertarian&quot; and a &quot;liberventionist&quot; and has urged the Libertarian Party to &quot;Boot Boortz&quot;.

Prior to the 2006 midterm elections, Boortz opined that perhaps it would be a good thing to have the Republicans lose power in Congress, forcing them to wake up and stop taking their base for granted. Boortz told one disgruntled caller:
I am happy about it [the defeat]. It&#x27;s the only way to get these Republicans to wake themselves up and say, &#x27;You have abandoned what you were put in office for.&#x27;

Boortz creates controversy among conservatives for his support of abortion rights (on which Boortz does not allow calls), for his refusal to condemn homosexuality or gay marriage, and for his negative comments regarding Baptists and the biblical story of creation. Although he calls himself a Christian, he keeps his religious views private. He has also caused a stir among some Southerners, by coining the term &quot;Flaggots&quot; during his frequent jabs at them and at Confederate issues (such as governmental support of the Confederate flag).

== &quot;The Neal Boortz Show&quot; ==
&quot;The Neal Boortz Show&quot; was a nationally syndicated talk show, which ended in January 2013. It aired live from 8:30am to noon, weekdays.

Boortz marketed his talk radio show as &quot;insensitivity training&quot;, creating controversy which increased ratings. His stated &quot;beliefs&quot; included a claim that ADD and ADHD are &quot;medical frauds&quot; and a scam that teachers, parents, and drug companies use. His attempts at controversy included referring to homeless people as &quot;urban outdoorsmen&quot; on air, and called public education &quot;taxpayer-funded child abuse&quot;. Specific targets of criticism included Christian conservatives, Hillary Clinton, Ted Kennedy, Max Cleland, and Cynthia McKinney. He also expressed a negative opinion about the lack of Muslim outrage for the actions of Muslim terrorists and the riots that erupted in response to the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy. Islamic extremism was a favorite topic.

Some of his remarks caused controversy. After the Virginia Tech shootings, Boortz criticized the media, saying, &quot;When the history of this event is written, we will have 25 students standing meekly waiting for this guy to execute them.&quot; When public outrage resulted from his comments, members of the Virginia Legislature tried to have Boortz&#x27;s show removed from local radio stations. In March 2008, Boortz attracted controversy by playing an audiotape of a nine-year-old where he repeatedly ridiculed the child&#x27;s speech, leading to an unsuccessful FCC petition to deny Boortz&#x27;s employer the right to purchase five local radio stations.

On June 4, 2012, Boortz announced that he would retire from radio by the end of the year. His last live show aired on January 18, 2013. Boortz&#x27;s regular fill-in host, Herman Cain, replaced him on January 21, 2013, in what amounted to a swap of seats, as Boortz became Cain&#x27;s fill-in host. Boortz hosted commentaries for WSB for six more years, until they were discontinued by station.

<doc id="176239" wikidata="Q456471" url="?curid=176239" title="Riesling">
<text>Riesling ( , ) is a white grape variety that originated in the Rhine region. Riesling is an aromatic grape variety displaying flowery, almost perfumed, aromas as well as high acidity. It is used to make dry, semi-sweet, sweet, and sparkling white wines. Riesling wines are usually varietally pure and are seldom oaked. , Riesling was estimated to be the world&#x27;s 20th most grown variety at (with an increasing trend), but in terms of importance for quality wines, it is usually included in the &quot;top three&quot; white wine varieties together with Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc. Riesling is a variety that is highly &quot;&quot;terroir&quot;-expressive&quot;, meaning that the character of Riesling wines is greatly influenced by the wine&#x27;s place of origin.

In cool climates (such as many German wine regions), Riesling wines tend to exhibit apple and tree fruit notes with noticeable levels of acidity that are sometimes balanced with residual sugar. A late-ripening variety that can develop more citrus and peach notes is grown in warmer climates (such as Alsace and parts of Austria). In Australia, Riesling is often noted for a characteristic lime note that tends to emerge in examples from the Clare Valley and Eden Valley in South Australia. Riesling&#x27;s naturally high acidity and pronounced fruit flavors give wines made from the grape exceptional aging potential, with well-made examples from favorable vintages often developing smokey, honey notes, and aged German Rieslings, in particular, taking on a &quot;petrol&quot; character, as a result of the development of the compound TDN.

In 2015, Riesling was the most grown variety in Germany with 23.0% and , and in the French region of Alsace with 21.9% and . In Germany, the variety is particularly widely planted in the Mosel, Rheingau, Nahe and Pfalz wine regions. There are also significant plantings of Riesling in Austria, Slovenia, Serbia, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Luxembourg, northern Italy, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa, China, Crimea, and the United States (Washington, California, Michigan, and New York).

==History==

Riesling has a long history, and there are several written references to the variety dating from the 15th century, although with varying orthography. The earliest of these references dates from March 13, 1435, when the storage inventory of Count John IV of Katzenelnbogen in Rüsselsheim (close to the Rheingau) lists &quot;22 ß umb seczreben Rießlingen in die wingarten&quot; (&quot;22 shillings for Riesling vine cuttings for the vineyard&quot;). The spelling &quot;Rießlingen&quot; is repeated in many other documents of the time. The modern spelling &quot;Riesling&quot; was first documented in 1552 when it was mentioned in Hieronymus Bock&#x27;s Latin herbal.

A map of Kintzheim in Alsace from 1348 contains the text &quot;zu dem Russelinge&quot;, but it is not certain that this reference is to the grape variety. However, in 1477, Riesling was documented in Alsace under the spelling &quot;Rissling&quot;. In Wachau in Austria, there is a small stream and a small vineyard both called &quot;Ritzling&quot;, which are claimed locally to have given Riesling its name. However, there seems to be no documentary evidence to back this up, so this claim is not widely believed to be correct.

===Parentage===
Earlier, Riesling was sometimes claimed to have originated from wild vines of the Rhine region, without much support to back up that claim. More recently, DNA fingerprinting by Ferdinand Regner indicated that one parent of Riesling is Gouais blanc, known to the Germans as &quot;Weißer Heunisch&quot;, a variety that, while rare today, was widely grown by the French and German peasantry of the Middle Ages. The other parent is a cross between a wild vine and Traminer. It is presumed that the Riesling was born somewhere in the valley of the Rhine, since both Heunisch and Traminer have a long documented history in Germany, but with parents from either side of the Adriatic the cross could have happened anywhere on the way.

It has also been suggested, but not proved, that the red-skinned version of Riesling is the forerunner of the common, &quot;white&quot; Riesling. The genetic differences between white and red Riesling are minuscule, as is also the case between Pinot noir and Pinot gris.

==Longevity==

Riesling wines are often consumed when young, when they make a fruity and aromatic wine that may have aromas of green or other apples, grapefruit, peach, gooseberry, honey, rose blossom or cut green grass, and usually a crisp taste due to the high acidity. However, Riesling&#x27;s naturally high acidity and range of flavours make it suitable for extended aging. International wine expert Michael Broadbent rates aged German Rieslings, some hundreds of years old, highly. Sweet Riesling wines, such as German Trockenbeerenauslese, are especially suited for cellaring since the high sugar content provides for additional preservation. However, high-quality dry or off-dry Riesling wine is also known not just to have survived but also to have been enjoyable at an age exceeding 100 years.

The Ratskeller (council wine cellar) of the townhall of Bremen, Germany, stores 650+ German wines, including Riesling-based wines, often in barrel and back to the 1653 vintage.

More common aging periods for Riesling wines would be 5–15 years for dry, 10–20 years for semi-sweet and 10–30+ for sweet versions.

=== Petroleum notes in aged Riesling wines ===
On release, certain Riesling wines reveal a striking petrol note (&quot;goût de pétrole&quot; in French) that is sometimes described with comparisons to kerosene, lubricant, or rubber. While an integral part of the aroma profile of mature Riesling and sought after by many experienced drinkers, it may be off-putting to those unaccustomed to it, and those who primarily seek young and fruity aromas in their wine. The negative attitude to petrol aromas in young Riesling, and the preference for fruitier young wines of this variety, seem more common in Germany than in Alsace or on the export market, and some German producers, especially the volume-oriented ones, have even gone so far as to consider the petrol notes a defect which they try to avoid, even at the cost of producing wines that are less suited to extended cellar aging. In that vein, the German Wine Institute has gone so far as to omit the mentioning of &quot;petrol&quot; as a possible aroma on their German-language Wine Aroma Wheel, which is supposed to be specially adapted to German wines, and despite the fact that professor Ann C. Noble had included petrol in her original version of the wheel.

The petrol note is considered to be caused by the compound 1,1,6-trimethyl-1,2-dihydronaphthalene (TDN), which during the aging process is created from carotenoid precursors by acid hydrolysis. The initial concentration of precursors in the wine determines the wine&#x27;s potential to develop TDN and petrol notes over time. From what is known of the production of carotenoids in grapes, factors that are likely to increase the TDN potential are:
* Ripe grapes, i.e., low yields and late harvest
* High sun exposure
* Water stress, which is most likely in regions which do not practice irrigation, and there primarily in certain dry vineyard sites in hot and dry years
* High acid content
These factors are usually also considered to contribute to high-quality Riesling wines, so the petrol note is in fact more likely to develop in top wines than in simpler wines made from high-yielding vineyards, especially those from the New World, where irrigation is common.

==Noble rot==
The most expensive wines made from Riesling are late harvest dessert wines (often amongst the most expensive in the world), produced by letting the grapes hang on the vines well past normal picking time. Through evaporation caused by the fungus &quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot; (&quot;noble rot&quot;) or by freezing and pressing (as is the case for ice wine - in German, Eiswein), water is removed and the resulting ultra concentrated juice is used to make the sweet wines. These wines are felt to offer richer layers on the palate, and have more sugar (in extreme cases hundreds of grams per litre), more acid (to give balance to the sugar), more flavour, and more complexity. These elements combine to make wines that are amongst the most long lived of all white wines. The beneficial use of &quot;noble rot&quot; in Riesling grapes was discovered in the late 18th century at Schloss Johannisberg. Permission from the Abbey of Fulda (which owned the vineyard) to start picking Riesling grapes arrived too late and the grapes had begun to rot; yet it turned out that the wine made from them was still of excellent quality.

Noble rot is employed in many viticultural areas, including the Clare, Barossa, and Eden Valleys in South Australia, and in the southern growing region of Tasmania, though none are as renowned as those from Germany.

==Production regions==

Riesling is considered one of the grape varieties that best expresses the terroir of the place where it is grown. It is particularly well suited for slate and sandy clay soil.

===Germany===
Today Riesling is Germany&#x27;s leading grape variety, known for its characteristic “transparency” in flavour and presentation of &quot;terroir&quot;, and its balance between fruit and mineral flavours. In Germany, Riesling normally ripens between late September and late November, and late harvest Riesling can be picked as late as January.

Two common characteristics of German Riesling are that they are rarely blended with other varieties and usually never exposed to oak flavour (despite some vintners fermenting in &quot;traditionel&quot; old oak barrels already leached). To this last item there is an exception with some winters in the wine regions of Palatinate (Pfalz) and Baden using new oak aging. The warmer temperatures in those regions produce heavier wines with a higher alcohol content that can better contend with the new oak. While clearer in individual flavours when it is young, a German Riesling will harmonize more as it ages, particularly around ten years of age.

In Germany, sugar levels at time of harvest are an important consideration in the wine&#x27;s production with prädikat levels measuring the sweetness of the wine. Equally important to winegrowers is the balance of acidity between the green tasting malic acid and the more citrus tasting tartaric acid. In cool years, some growers will wait until November to harvest in expectation of having a higher level of ripeness and subsequent tartaric acid.

Before technology in wineries could stabilize temperatures, the low temperatures in winter of the northern German regions would halt fermentation and leave the resulting wines with natural sugars and a low alcohol content. According to local tradition, in the Mosel region the wine would then be bottled in tall, tapered, and green hock bottles. Similar bottles, although brown, are used for Riesling produced in the Rhine region.

Riesling is also the preferred grape in production of Deutscher Sekt, German sparkling wine.

Riesling wines from Germany cover a vast array of tastes from sweet to off-dry &quot;halbtrocken&quot; to dry &quot;trocken&quot;. Late harvest Rieslings can ripen to become very sweet dessert wines of the beerenauslese (BA) and trockenbeerenauslese (TBA) class.

===France===

Riesling is on record as being planted in the Alsace region by 1477 when its quality was praised by the Duke of Lorraine. Today over a fifth of Alsace&#x27;s vineyards are covered with Riesling vines, mostly in the Haut-Rhin district, with the varietal being very different from neighboring German Riesling. This is partly from difference in the soil with the clay Alsatian soil being more dominately calcareous than the slate composition of Rheingau. The other differences come in wine making styles, with the Alsatian preferring more French-oriented methods that produce wines of higher alcohol content (normally around 12%) and more roundness due to longer time spent in neutral oak barrels or steel tanks. In contrast to German wine laws, Alsatian rieslings can be chaptalized, a process in which the alcoholic content is increased through the addition of sugar to the must.
In contrast to other Alsatian wines, Rieslings d&#x27;Alsace are usually not meant to be drunk young, but many are still best in the first years. Rieslings d&#x27;Alsace tend to be mostly very dry with a cleansing acidity. They are thick-bodied wines that coat the palate. These wines age exceptionally well with a quality vintage aging up to 20 years. This is beneficial since the flavours in an Alsace wine will often open up after three years, developing softer and fruitier flavours. Riesling is very suitable for the late harvest &quot;Vendange Tardive&quot; and the botrytized &quot;Sélection de Grains Nobles&quot;, with good acidity keeping up the sweetness of the wine.

In addition to Muscat, Gewürztraminer and Pinot gris, Riesling is one of the acceptable varieties whose planting is allowed in &quot;Alsace grand cru&quot; sites.

===Australia and New Zealand===

In 1838 William Macarthur planted Riesling vines near Penrith in New South Wales. Riesling was the most planted white grape in Australia until the early 1990s when Chardonnay greatly increased in popularity. Riesling still flourishes in the Great Southern of Western Australia (in particular Mt Barker, Frankland River and Porongurup), and in South Australia in the Clare Valley, and particularly in the areas of Watervale and around Polish Hill River, and the cooler Eden Valley and High Eden. The warmer Australian climate produces thicker skinned grapes, sometimes seven times the thickness of German grown grapes. The grapes ripen in free draining soil composed of red soil over limestone and shale, producing a lean wine that, as it matures, produces toasty, honeycomb and lime aromas and flavors. It is common for Australian Rieslings to be fermented at low temperatures in stainless steel tanks with no oxidation of the wine, followed by earlier bottling.

Australian Rieslings are noted for their oily texture and citrus fruit flavors in their youth and a smooth balance of freshness and acid as they age. The botrytized Rieslings have immense levels of flavor concentrations that have been favorably compared to lemon marmalade.

Riesling was first planted in New Zealand in the 1970s and has flourished in the relatively cool climate of the Marlborough area and for late harvests in the Nelson region. In comparison to Australian Riesling, New Zealand produces lighter and more delicate wines that range from sweet to dry. Central Otago, the home of cool climate wines, has recently emerged as another area producing terroir driven Rieslings.

Riesling is the second leading white grape varietal after the indigenous Grüner Veltliner. Austrian Riesling is generally thick bodied, coating the palate and producing a strong clarity of flavour coupled with a mouthwatering aroma. A particular Austrian Riesling trademark is a long finish that includes hints of white pepper. It flourishes in the cool climate and free-draining granite and mica soil of the Wachau region where Austrian wine laws allow for irrigation. With levels normally around 13% it has a relatively high alcohol content for Riesling and is generally at its peak after 5 years. Austrian Riesling is not known for its sweetness and is mostly dry with very few grapes affected by botrytis.

===United States===

In the late nineteenth century, German immigrants brought with them Riesling vines, borrowing the name of Schloss Johannisberg to mark the plants&#x27; origin. &quot;Johannisberg Riesling&quot; became a semi-generic name for Riesling until an agreement between the U.S. and EU prohibited its use in 2006. New York, particularly in the Finger Lakes region, was one of the earliest U.S. producers of Riesling. Plantings started to appear in California by 1857 and followed in Washington State in 1871.

New York Riesling generally has a characteristic effervescent light body with a similarly light, mellow flavor. The wine can be dynamic though rarely robust, and ranges from dry to sweet. New York is also a notable producer of Riesling-based ice wine, although a large majority of New York Ice Wine is made from Vidal blanc and Vignoles.

In California, Riesling lags far behind Chardonnay in popularity and is not as commonly planted. A notable exception is the growing development of high quality Late Harvest dessert wines. So far, the Late Harvest wines most successfully produced are in the Anderson and Alexander Valleys where the weather is more likely to encourage the needed botrytis to develop. The Riesling that does come out of California tends to be softer, fuller, and having more diverse flavours than a &quot;typical&quot; German Riesling.

In the Pacific Northwest, there is a stark contrast in Riesling production. Although Oregon was once viewed as a promising destination for the grape, Burgundy-style wines came to dominate, while in Washington, large producers such as Chateau Ste. Michelle spearheaded Riesling&#x27;s growth. Chateau Ste. Michille championed German styles and partnered with well-known German firm Dr. Ernest Loosen to create specialty wines such as the Eroica brand. With annual productions of over 2,000,000 cases a year, Chateau Ste. Michelle is the worldwide leader in the production of Riesling wines by volume. In 2007 Pacific Rim Winemakers, another Pacific Northwest winery and owned by Randall Grahm of Bonny Doon, has built the first wine facility in Red Mountain AVA dedicated completely to Riesling production. Riesling from this area ranges from dry to sweet, and has a crisp lightness that bodes well for easy drinking. Often there will be an easily detectable peach and mineral complex

In Michigan, whose Old Mission Peninsula and Leelanau Peninsula AVAs (near Traverse City) are known for their ice wine, Riesling is a fairly common variety, in part on account of its suitability for that purpose.

Riesling is grown in other regions as well, including colder parts of relatively warm states such as Oklahoma (where it has even been made into an eiswein) and Texas.

Riesling is also grown throughout all the regions in Ohio and is produced and sold at award-winning wineries across the state.

===Canada===
In Ontario, Riesling is commonly used for icewine, where the wine is noted for its breadth and complexity. Niagara is a major producer of ice wine in general, putting it neck-and-neck with Germany. Late Harvest wines and some sparkling wines are produced with Riesling in Niagara but it is table wines from dry to off-dry that hold the largest share of production. The climate of the region is typically quite warm in the summertime, which adds a layer of richness in the wines. The founder of St. Urbanshoff in the Mosel, Herman Weiss, was an early pioneer in Niagara&#x27;s modern viticulture, selling his strain of Mosel clone Riesling to many producers in west Niagara (these vines are well over 20 years old now). This clone and Niagara&#x27;s summer heat make for uniquely bright wines and often show up in interesting dry styled versions. Many producers and wine critics will argue that Niagara&#x27;s best offerings come from the Niagara Escarpment region, which encompasses the Short Hills Bench, 20 Mile Bench, and Beamsville Bench.

In British Columbia, Riesling is commonly grown for use in icewine, table wine, and sekt-style sparkling wines, a notable example of which is Cipes Brut.

In Nova Scotia, particularly in the Annapolis Valley region, Riesling is showing significant promise, being shaped by the warm summer days with cool nights and the extension of the growing season that is being observed. The Maritime climate combined with glacial soils contribute to the interesting expressions that are showing.

===Other regions===
Riesling is also widely grown in Luxembourg (where it represents some 12% of the vineyard), Hungary, Italy, particularly Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Croatia, South Africa, Chile and Central Europe, particularly Romania and Moldova, Serbia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.

==Production==

In wine making, the delicate nature of the Riesling grape requires special handling during harvesting to avoid crushing or bruising the skin. Without this care, the broken skins could leak tannin into the juice, giving a markedly coarse taste and throwing off balance the Riesling&#x27;s range of flavors and aromas.

A wine that is best at its &quot;freshest&quot; states, the grapes and juice may be chilled often throughout the vinification process. Once, right after picking to preserve the grapes&#x27; more delicate flavours. Second, after it has been processed through a bladder press and right before fermentation. During fermentation, the wine is cooled in temperature controlled stainless steel fermentation tanks kept between . This differs from red wines that normally ferment at 

Unlike Chardonnay, most Riesling do not undergo malolactic fermentation. This helps preserve the tart, acidic characteristic of the wine that gives Riesling its &quot;thirst-quenching&quot; quality. (Producers of Sauvignon blanc and Pinot grigio often avoid malolactic fermentation for the same reason.) Riesling is often put through a process of cold stabilization, where the wine is stored just above its freezing point. The wine is kept at this temperature until much of the tartaric acid has crystallized and precipitated out of the wine. This helps prevent crystallization of the acid (often called &quot;wine diamonds&quot;) in the bottle. After this, the wine is normally filtered again to remove any remaining yeast or impurities.

In viticulture, the two main components in growing Riesling grapes are to keep it &quot;Long &amp; Low&quot; meaning that the ideal situation for Riesling is a climate that allows for a long, slow ripening and proper pruning to keep the yield low and the flavor concentrated.

==With food==
Riesling is a versatile wine for pairing with food, because of its balance of sugar and acidity. It can be paired with white fish or pork, and is one of the few wines that can stand up to the stronger flavours and spices of Thai and Chinese cuisine. A Riesling&#x27;s typical aromas are of flowers, tropical fruits, and mineral stone (such as slate or quartz), although, with time, the wine acquires a petrol note as mentioned above.

Riesling is almost never fermented or aged in new oak (although large old oak barrels are often used to store and stabilize Riesling-based wines in Germany and Alsace). This means that Riesling tends to be lighter weight and therefore suitable to a wider range of foods. The sharp acidity/sweetness in Rieslings can serve as a good balance to foods that have a high salt content. In Germany, cabbage is sometimes cooked with riesling to reduce the vegetable&#x27;s smell.

As with other white wines, dry Riesling is generally served at a cool . Sweeter Rieslings are often served warmer.

==Clones==
There exists a large number of commercial clones of Riesling, with slightly different properties. In Germany, approximately 60 clones are allowed, and the most famous of these have been propagated from vines in the vineyards of Schloss Johannisberg. Most other countries have sourced their Riesling clones directly from Germany, but they are sometimes propagated under different designations.

==Red Riesling==
A very rare version of Riesling that has recently received more attention is Red Riesling (&quot;Roter Riesling&quot;). As the name suggests, this is a red-skinned clone of Riesling (a skin color commonly found for, e.g., Gewürztraminer), but not a dark-skinned clone, i.e., it is still a white wine grape. It is considered a mutation of White Riesling, but some experts have suggested the opposite relationship, i.e., that Red Riesling could be the forerunner of White Riesling. Small amounts of Red Riesling are grown in Germany and Austria. In 2006, the Rheingau winery Fritz Allendorf planted what has been claimed to be the first commercial amounts of Red Riesling. To confuse matters, &quot;Red Riesling&quot; has also been used as a synonym for red-skinned Traminer grapes (such as the Savagnin rose of Klevener de Heiligenstein) and the obscure variety Hanns, which is a seed plant of Roter Veltliner. Roter Riesling has nothing to do with Schwarzriesling.

==Crosses==
In the late 19th century, German horticulturalists devoted many efforts to develop new Riesling hybrids that would create a more flexible, less temperamental grape that could still retain some of the elegant characteristics of Riesling. The most notable is the Müller-Thurgau developed in the Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute in 1882, which is a cross of Riesling and Madeleine Royale (although long believed to be Riesling x Silvaner). Other Riesling/Silvaner crosses include the Palatinate regional favorite Scheurebe and Rieslaner. Kerner, a cross between Riesling and the red wine grape Trollinger is a high-quality cross that has recently eclipsed Riesling in plantings.

The VIVC lists the following crosses with Riesling as the first parent:

Alb de Yaloven, Arnsburger, Augustriesling, Beutelriesling, Bouquetriesling, Dalkauer, Edelmuskat, Ehrenfelser, Feinriesling, Floricica, Frühriesling, Geisenheim 195, Geisenheim 643-10, Geisenheim 643-20, Geisenheim 649, Johanniter, Kocsis Zsuzsa, Manzoni bianco, Marienriesling, Müller Thurgau, Multaner, Muscat de la Republique, Naumburg 231-52, Oraniensteiner, Osiris, Osteiner, Quanyu B, Rabaner, Rieslina, Riesling Magaracha, Romeo, Weinsberg S186, Weinsberg S195

==Naming==

Many grapes that incorporate the name Riesling are not true Riesling. For example:

* Welschriesling is an unrelated variety, which is common in Austria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, and Romania, and that may also be labelled as Riesling Italico, Welsch Rizling, Olasz Rizling or Laski Rizling.
* Schwarzriesling (Black Riesling) is the German name for Pinot Meunier, a grape used in Champagne, but which is also grown in Southern Germany.
* Cape Riesling is the South African name for the French grape Crouchen.
* Gray Riesling is actually Trousseau gris, a white mutant of the Bastardo port wine grape.
* White Riesling is the &#x27;real&#x27; Riesling, which is also called Johannisberg Riesling (named after the famed Schloss Johannisberg) and Rhine Riesling (= Riesling Renano in Italy, occasionally Rheinriesling in Austria).

<text>Peter Leon Lehmann AM, (18 August 1930 – 28 June 2013) was an Australian wine producer based in the Barossa Valley.

==Biography==
Lehmann was born in Angaston, South Australia in Barossa Valley on 18 August 1930.

His father was Lutheran Pastor Franz Julius Lehmann, and son may have joined father in the ministry but for Franz&#x27; sudden death in 1945, aged 55. Peter soon dropped out of school &quot;ostensibly to be some support to my recently widowed mother,&quot; he says.

In 1947, he started work at the Yalumba winery under Rudi Kronberger. From 1960 to 1980 he was Winemaker/Manager at Saltram Wines. He parted company with Saltram to become the Chairman of Peter Lehmann Wines, a role later filled by his son Doug.

Peter Lehmann has been described as one of Australia&#x27;s most respected and innovative wine makers. His success in winning international trophies has been noted by the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation.

===Family===
Lehmann&#x27;s eldest son Doug Lehmann was also a noted winemaker who worked for the family company. He died in June 2014.

==Peter Lehmann Wines==
Founded in 1979, Peter Lehmann Wines produces around 600,000 cases annually, with distribution to Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States and many other countries. It is located in the Barossa Valley, approximately 70 kilometres north of Adelaide in South Australia.

In 1977, Saltram instructed then winemaker/manager Peter Lehmann to buy less grapes from their Barossa growers. Since Peter had given the growers his word to buy the grapes, he refused. After months of negotiations with Dalgety plc, which owned Saltram, he was allowed to start an outside company called Masterson Barossa Vineyards in order to buy and process the grapes. Tyre retailer MS Mcleod gave financial backing to the venture. The inspiration of the name came from the legendary gambler Sky Masterson (see Guys and Dolls), because starting the company was such a gamble, and in keeping with the theme the queen of clubs was chosen as the logo for the company.

In 1979 Saltram was sold to Canadian multinational spirit producer Seagram which informed Peter that he could no longer make wine on the side, so he quit his job at Saltram and worked fully for Masterson. In 1982 the company was renamed Peter Lehmann Wines.

In 1992 MS Mcleod decided to divest themselves of their investment in the company, and with no local buyer in the offing and the company again facing closure or a fire sale to a multinational, a public float was devised. While the core shareholding was intended to be taken up by the growers themselves and by staff, it was feared that the capital raised would be insufficient and so a share and option package was offered publicly. In the end the float was oversubscribed and the new company performed strongly.

In late 2003 &#x27;PLW&#x27; became the subject of a heated bidding war between UK-based Allied Domecq and Swiss based Hess Group. Allied Domecq had acquired 14.5% of Peter Lehmann Wines when it first submitted a takeover bid on 22 September. Peter Lehmann and the board of directors countered by recommending sale to the Hess Group instead. Hess matched the Allied Domecq offer, adding a special dividend to the deal, and purchased the company for a market valuation of $103 million USD.

By 2016, Peter Lehmann Wines was owned by Casella Family Brands.

The Barossa Valley Way is the main road through the valley, connecting the main towns on the valley floor of Nuriootpa, Tanunda, Rowland Flat and Lyndoch. The Barossa Trail walking and cycling path is long, and passes the main towns, starting from near Gawler on the Adelaide Plains, to Angaston to the east of the valley.

==History==

The traditional owners of the land including the Barossa Valley are the Peramangk people, who comprise a number of family groups. Evidence of their thousands of years of occupation can be seen all around the area, in the form of artefacts, scar trees and shelter paintings.
The Barossa Valley derives its name from the Barossa Range, which was named by Colonel William Light in 1837. Light chose the name in memory of the British victory over the French in the &quot;Battle of &quot;Barrosa&quot;&quot;, in which he fought in 1811. The name &quot;Barossa&quot; was registered in error, due to a clerical error in transcribing the name &quot;Barrosa&quot;. The area is approximately .

The three major towns of the Barossa have distinctive characteristics. Tanunda is generally recognised as the most German of the three, with traditions dating back to the 1840s when the first German settlers arrived in the area. Since many of the German settlers came from Prussian Silesia, they called the Barossa &quot;Neu-Schlesien&quot;, or &quot;New Silesia&quot;. 

The German influence survives to this day (&quot;see Barossa German&quot;). Angaston, in contrast, is considered the English town as it was settled predominantly by Cornish miners and others from Britain. The third, and largest town, Nuriootpa, was influenced by both German and British settlers, and today is the commercial hub of the Barossa and it is where most of the larger stores are located.

In February 2011, South Australian Premier, Mike Rann, announced that special legislation would be introduced to protect the unique heritage of the Barossa Valley and of McLaren Vale. He said: &quot;Barossa and McLaren Vale food and wine are key icons of South Australia. We must never allow the Barossa or McLaren Vale to become suburbs of Adelaide.&quot; &quot;The Character Preservation (Barossa Valley) Act 2012&quot; was subsequently passed by the South Australian Parliament.

==People==
In 2021, 25,066 people lived in the Barossa Valley. Most inhabitants live in Tanunda, Nuriootpa, Angaston, Williamstown and Lyndoch, each having over 1,000 people. The remaining population lives in the countryside, or a few smaller towns such as Moculta and Springton. All of these towns are part of the Barossa local government. The townships of Greenock, population 1087, Seppeltsfield, population 138, and Maranaga, population 104, are located on the western ridge of the valley in Light Regional Council. Many facilities not available in these towns are usually supplemented in nearby Gawler. In recent years, increased development in the area has seen opposition from the local communities.

===Religion===
The region has a strong German Lutheran history, and many residents identify themselves as Lutherans. Some towns have more than one Lutheran church. Tanunda, for example, has Langmeil, St. Paul&#x27;s, Tabor and St. Johns. Nuriootpa has St. Petri and Holy Trinity. Angaston has Zion and Salem (Penrice).

Each major town has a Lutheran primary school. Tanunda has Tanunda Lutheran School, Nuriootpa has Redeemer, and Angaston has Good Shepherd. St. Jakobi, the Lutheran primary school at Lyndoch, hosts the Barossa Airshow annually as its fundraiser.

===Population===

Major Town Populations:
As a rural region, there is also significant population outside of the town centres (not shown here).

==Railway==
The Barossa Valley railway line runs through several townships in the valley. The line opened in 1911 and was last used in June 2014. It has since been closed.

==Wine industry==

The wine industry plays a major role in the Barossa, being the main source of employment for many residents. The many hectares of vineyards are the most distinctive feature of the area, especially when viewed from the Mengler Hill lookout, positioned on the Barossa Range which forms much of the eastern side of the valley. The success of the wine industry has historically been celebrated every two years with a week-long Barossa Valley Vintage Festival. The festival draws visitors from all over the world, and has entertainment for all tastes including a huge street parade, concerts and gourmet dining.

The Barossa Valley is primarily known for its red wine, in particular Shiraz. Normally, large proportions of Barossa Shiraz are used in Penfolds Grange, Australia&#x27;s most famous wine. Other main grape varieties grown in the region include: Riesling; Semillon; Grenache and Cabernet Sauvignon. Fortified wines have been traditionally produced in the region as well.

Marananga is home to the only sub-regional wine competition in Australia, hosted by the Gnadenfrei Lutheran church community since 2004 and focussed solely on benchmarking wines produced on the Western Ridge of the valley.

The Barossa Valley is a rich source of some of the oldest Shiraz vines in the world. Shiraz vines planted as early as 1847 by Johann Frederick August Fiedler on Lot 1, Hundred of Moorooroo (the township of Tanunda) are still in commercial production today by Turkey Flat Vineyards.

==Food production==
Although it is overshadowed by the wine industry, significant food production occurs in the Barossa Valley, including:
* Bakeries that produce traditional German breads and pastries
* Butchers who produce meat and smallgoods in the German style
* Artisan cheesemakers
* Maggie Beer is a renowned cook, food author, restaurateur and food manufacturer. Her Farm Shop sells a range of condiments under her name. She is co-presenter of ABC Television&#x27;s programme &quot;The Cook and the Chef&quot;.

The Barossa Valley holds a weekly Farmers&#x27; Market, supplying local produce which is sold directly by the producer.

==Festivals==

===Barossa Vintage Festival===
The week-long Barossa Vintage Festival is held biennially, in odd-numbered years. The festival runs for around a week in autumn, and traditionally marks and celebrates the completion of the year&#x27;s vintage season, at the end of March and beginning of April. A variety of wine-themed events are held during the festival, including wine tastings and competitions, musical events, food events with local produce, balls and parades.

The Barossa Vintage Festival was first held in 1947, to celebrate the end of the grape harvest, and the end of hostilities in World War II, and has run continually since. It is Australia&#x27;s oldest and longest-running wine festival.

===Barossa Gourmet Weekend===
The Barossa Gourmet Weekend is a three-day food, wine and art celebration held in the third weekend of August every year. Local wineries and venues host individual events throughout the Barossa, offering food, wine, music, arts and hospitality.

<doc id="176244" wikidata="Q185969" url="?curid=176244" title="Geoid">
<text>The geoid ( ) is the shape that the ocean surface would take under the influence of the gravity of Earth, including gravitational attraction and Earth&#x27;s rotation, if other influences such as winds and tides were absent. This surface is extended through the continents (such as might be approximated with very narrow hypothetical canals). According to Carl Friedrich Gauss, who first described it, it is the &quot;mathematical figure of the Earth&quot;, a smooth but irregular surface whose shape results from the uneven distribution of mass within and on the surface of Earth. It can be known only through extensive gravitational measurements and calculations. Despite being an important concept for almost 200 years in the history of geodesy and geophysics, it has been defined to high precision only since advances in satellite geodesy in the late 20th century.

The geoid is often expressed as a geoid undulation or geoidal height above a given reference ellipsoid, which is a slightly flattened sphere whose equatorial bulge is caused by the planet&#x27;s rotation. Generally the geoidal height rises where the Earth&#x27;s material is locally more dense and exerts greater gravitational force than the surrounding areas. The geoid in turn serves as a reference coordinate surface for various vertical coordinates, such as orthometric heights, geopotential heights, and dynamic heights (see Geodesy#Heights).

All points on a geoid surface have the same geopotential (the sum of gravitational potential energy and centrifugal potential energy). At this surface, apart from temporary tidal fluctuations, the force of gravity acts everywhere perpendicular to the geoid, meaning that plumb lines point perpendicular and bubble levels are parallel to the geoid. 
Being an equigeopotential means the geoid corresponds to the free surface of water at rest (if only the Earth&#x27;s gravity and rotational acceleration were at work); this is also a sufficient condition for a ball to remain at rest instead of rolling over the geoid.
Earth&#x27;s gravity acceleration (the vertical derivative of geopotential) is thus non-uniform over the geoid.


==Description==
The geoid surface is irregular, unlike the reference ellipsoid (which is a mathematical idealized representation of the physical Earth as an ellipsoid), but is considerably smoother than Earth&#x27;s physical surface. Although the &quot;ground&quot; of the Earth has excursions on the order of +8,800 m (Mount Everest) and −11,000 m (Marianas Trench), the geoid&#x27;s deviation from an ellipsoid ranges from +85 m (Iceland) to −106 m (southern India), less than 200 m total.

If the ocean were of constant density and undisturbed by tides, currents or weather, its surface would resemble the geoid. The permanent deviation between the geoid and mean sea level is called ocean surface topography. If the continental land masses were crisscrossed by a series of tunnels or canals, the sea level in those canals would also very nearly coincide with the geoid. Geodesists are able to derive the heights of continental points above the geoid by spirit leveling.

Being an equipotential surface, the geoid is, by definition, a surface upon which the force of gravity is perpendicular everywhere, apart from temporary tidal fluctuations. This means that when traveling by ship, one does not notice the undulation of the geoid; neglecting tides, the local vertical (plumb line) is always perpendicular to the geoid and the local horizon tangential to it. Likewise, spirit levels will always be parallel to the geoid.

===Simplified example===

Earth&#x27;s gravitational field is not uniform. An oblate spheroid is typically used as the idealized Earth, but even if the Earth were spherical and did not rotate, the strength of gravity would not be the same everywhere because density varies throughout the planet. This is due to magma distributions, the density and weight of different geological compositions in the Earth&#x27;s crust, mountain ranges, deep sea trenches, crust compaction due to glaciers, and so on.

If that sphere were then covered in water, the water would not be the same height everywhere. Instead, the water level would be higher or lower with respect to Earth&#x27;s center, depending on the integral of the strength of gravity from the center of the Earth to that location. The geoid level coincides with where the water would be. Generally the geoid rises where the Earth&#x27;s material is locally more dense, exerts greater gravitational force, and pulls more water from the surrounding area.

==Formulation==
The geoid undulation (also known as geoid height or geoid anomaly), &quot;N&quot;, is the height of the geoid relative to a given ellipsoid of reference. 
formula_1
The undulation is not standardized, as different countries use different mean sea levels as reference, but most commonly refers to the EGM96 geoid.

In maps and common use, the height over the mean sea level (such as orthometric height, &quot;H&quot;) is used to indicate the height of elevations while the ellipsoidal height, &quot;h&quot;, results from the GPS system and similar GNSS:
formula_2
(An analogous relationship exists between normal heights and the &quot;quasigeoid&quot;, which disregards local density variations.)
In practice, many handheld GPS receivers interpolate &quot;N&quot; in a pre-computed &quot;geoid map&quot; (a lookup table).

So a GPS receiver on a ship may, during the course of a long voyage, indicate height variations, even though the ship will always be at sea level (neglecting the effects of tides). That is because GPS satellites, orbiting about the center of gravity of the Earth, can measure heights only relative to a geocentric reference ellipsoid. To obtain one&#x27;s orthometric height, a raw GPS reading must be corrected. Conversely, height determined by spirit leveling from a tide gauge, as in traditional land surveying, is closer to orthometric height. Modern GPS receivers have a grid implemented in their software by which they obtain, from the current position, the height of the geoid (e.g., the EGM96 geoid) over the World Geodetic System (WGS) ellipsoid. They are then able to correct the height above the WGS ellipsoid to the height above the EGM96 geoid. When height is not zero on a ship, the discrepancy is due to other factors such as ocean tides, atmospheric pressure (meteorological effects), local sea surface topography, and measurement uncertainties.

==Determination==
The undulation of the geoid &quot;N&quot; is closely related to the disturbing potential &quot;T&quot; according to Bruns&#x27; formula (named after Heinrich Bruns):
:formula_3
where formula_4 is the force of normal gravity, computed from the normal field potential formula_5.

Another way of determining &quot;N&quot; is using values of &quot;gravity anomaly&quot; formula_6, differences between true and normal reference gravity, as per (or Stokes&#x27; integral), published in 1849 by George Gabriel Stokes:

:formula_7

The integral kernel &quot;S&quot;, called &quot;Stokes function&quot;, was derived by Stokes in closed analytical form.
Note that determining formula_8 anywhere on Earth by this formula requires formula_6 to be known &quot;everywhere on Earth&quot;, including oceans, polar areas, and deserts. For terrestrial gravimetric measurements this is a near-impossibility, in spite of close international co-operation within the International Association of Geodesy (IAG), e.g., through the International Gravity Bureau (BGI, Bureau Gravimétrique International).

Another approach for geoid determination is to &quot;combine&quot; multiple information sources: not just terrestrial gravimetry, but also satellite geodetic data on the figure of the Earth, from analysis of satellite orbital perturbations, and lately from satellite gravity missions such as GOCE and GRACE. In such combination solutions, the low-resolution part of the geoid solution is provided by the satellite data, while a &#x27;tuned&#x27; version of the above Stokes equation is used to calculate the high-resolution part, from terrestrial gravimetric data from a neighbourhood of the evaluation point only.

Calculating the undulation is mathematically challenging.
The precise geoid solution by Petr Vaníček and co-workers improved on the Stokesian approach to geoid computation. Their solution enables millimetre-to-centimetre accuracy in geoid computation, an order-of-magnitude improvement from previous classical solutions.

Geoid undulations display uncertainties which can be estimated by using several methods, e.g., least-squares collocation (LSC), fuzzy logic, artificial neural networks, radial basis functions (RBF), and geostatistical techniques. Geostatistical approach has been defined as the most-improved technique in prediction of geoid undulation.

==Relationship to mass density==

Variations in the height of the geoidal surface are related to anomalous density distributions within the Earth. Geoid measures thus help understanding the internal structure of the planet. Synthetic calculations show that the geoidal signature of a thickened crust (for example, in orogenic belts produced by continental collision) is positive, opposite to what should be expected if the thickening affects the entire lithosphere. Mantle convection also changes the shape of the geoid over time.

The surface of the geoid is higher than the reference ellipsoid wherever there is a positive gravity anomaly or negative disturbing potential (mass excess) and lower than the reference ellipsoid wherever there is a negative gravity anomaly or positive disturbing potential (mass deficit).

This relationship can be understood by recalling that gravity potential is defined so that it has negative values and is inversely proportional to distance from the body.
So, while a mass excess will strengthen the gravity acceleration, it will decrease the gravity potential. As a consequence, the geoid&#x27;s defining equipotential surface will be found displaced away from the mass excess.
Analogously, a mass deficit will weaken the gravity pull but will increase the geopotential at a given distance, causing the geoid to move towards the mass deficit.

The presence of a localized inclusion in the background medium will rotate the gravity acceleration vectors slightly towards or away from a denser or lighter body, respectively, causing a bump or dimple in the equipotential surface.

The largest absolute deviation can be found in the Indian Ocean Geoid Low, 106 meters below the average sea level.
Another large feature is the North Atlantic Geoid High (or North Atlantic Geoid Swell), caused in part by the weight of ice cover over North America and northern Europe in the Late Cenozoic Ice Age.

==Temporal change==

Recent satellite missions, such as the Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) and 
GRACE, have enabled the study of time-variable geoid signals. The first products based on GOCE satellite data became available online in June 2010, through the European Space Agency. ESA launched the satellite in March 2009 on a mission to map Earth&#x27;s gravity with unprecedented accuracy and spatial resolution. On 31 March 2011, a new geoid model was unveiled at the Fourth International GOCE User Workshop hosted at the Technical University of Munich, Germany. Studies using the time-variable geoid computed from GRACE data have provided information on global hydrologic cycles, mass balances of ice sheets, and postglacial rebound. From postglacial rebound measurements, time-variable GRACE data can be used to deduce the viscosity of Earth&#x27;s mantle.

==Spherical harmonics representation==
Spherical harmonics are often used to approximate the shape of the geoid. The current best such set of spherical harmonic coefficients is EGM2020 (Earth Gravitational Model 2020), determined in an international collaborative project led by the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (now the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, or NGA). The mathematical description of the non-rotating part of the potential function in this model is:

formula_10

where formula_11 and formula_12 are &quot;geocentric&quot; (spherical) latitude and longitude respectively, formula_13 are the fully normalized associated Legendre polynomials of degree formula_14 and order formula_15, and formula_16 and formula_17 are the numerical coefficients of the model based on measured data. The above equation describes the Earth&#x27;s gravitational potential formula_18, not the geoid itself, at location formula_19 the co-ordinate formula_20 being the &quot;geocentric radius&quot;, i.e., distance from the Earth&#x27;s centre. The geoid is a particular equipotential surface, and is somewhat involved to compute. The gradient of this potential also provides a model of the gravitational acceleration. The most commonly used EGM96 contains a full set of coefficients to degree and order 360 (i.e., formula_21), describing details in the global geoid as small as 55 km (or 110 km, depending on the definition of resolution). The number of coefficients, formula_16 and formula_17, can be determined by first observing in the equation for formula_18 that for a specific value of formula_25 there are two coefficients for every value of formula_26 except for formula_27. There is only one coefficient when formula_27 since formula_29. There are thus formula_30 coefficients for every value of formula_25. Using these facts and the formula, formula_32, it follows that the total number of coefficients is given by

formula_33 using the EGM96 value of formula_21.

For many applications, the complete series is unnecessarily complex and is truncated after a few (perhaps several dozen) terms.

Still, even higher resolution models have been developed. Many of the authors of EGM96 have published EGM2008. It incorporates much of the new satellite gravity data (e.g., the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment), and supports up to degree and order 2160 (1/6 of a degree, requiring over 4 million coefficients), with additional coefficients extending to degree 2190 and order 2159. EGM2020 is the international follow-up that was originally scheduled for 2020 (still unreleased in 2024), containing the same number of harmonics generated with better data.

<text>Algherese or Alguerese (autonym: ) is the variety of Catalan spoken in the city of Alghero ( in Catalan), in the northwest of Sardinia, Italy.

The dialect has its roots in 1372, when Catalan-speaking colonists were allowed to repopulate Alghero and expel the native population, after several revolts. Catalan was replaced as the official language by Spanish, then by Italian in the mid-18th century. Today the language has semi-official recognition alongside Italian.

Studies give an approximate number of 20,000 to 30,000 native speakers of the language worldwide. In communities where Algherese is spoken, Italian and Logudorese Sardinian are often used as well.

== History ==
Algherese is a regional dialect spoken by anywhere from 20,000 to 30,000 individuals, most of whom reside in the town of Alghero, located in the northwest of Sardinia. The language, though distinct, is initially derived from, and thus considered a variant of, the Catalan language. The origins of the language can be traced back to 1372, when Catalan invaders repopulated the city of Alghero after exiling the indigenous populations in Sardinia. Despite the city&#x27;s increasing Italianisation, the use of this Catalan dialect remained widespread until at least the 1970s.

===Present status===
As a result of the city&#x27;s extensive Italianisation, Italian is now the predominant language in Alghero, being estimated by a 2004 survey to be first language of close to 60% of those surveyed. The use of the dialect in schools and media, to name a few, remains sparse. Teaching of the dialect in school is also rare. However, in an attempt to reverse the trend, the Regional Council of Sardinia officially recognised &quot;Algherese Catalan&quot; as a separate language in 1997, in order to promote its use and circulation. According to the 2004 survey, Algherese was used by approximately 14% of the population for daily interactions. The dialect is mostly a local language, often used to supplement Italian and/or Sardinian in relatively small circles.

The following figures were obtained from the &quot;Enquesta d&#x27;usos lingüístics a l&#x27;Alguer&quot; (&quot;Survey of linguistic usage in Alghero&quot;, EULAL) of 2004 and the &quot;Els usos lingüístics a l&#x27;Alguer&quot; of 2015 (EULA 2015), both of which were studies conducted in the town of Alghero about the general use of Algherese in several media.

===Official recognition===
In 1999, Catalan and Sardinian were among the twelve minority languages officially recognised as Italy&#x27;s &quot;historical linguistic minorities&quot; by the Italian State under Law No. 482/1999. Prior to this, the Regional Council of Sardinia had passed the Regional Law No. 26 of 15 October 1997 which, aside from promoting the equality in dignity of the Sardinian language with the Italian language throughout the island, provided that the other languages of smaller scope be afforded the same treatment as the aforementioned languages, among which Catalan is cited, in the city of Alghero. The city council, for its part, promulgated its protection and standardisation in its city statute.

==Phonology==
;Vowels

:Notes:
:* The close-mid and mid-close vowels and merge into mid vowels ( and , here transcribed without diacritics) in Modern Alguerese.
:* Coalescing of unstressed vowels , () and to [ ~ ] (transcribed as ) unlike the rest of Eastern Catalan, which uses or even (transcribed as ): &quot;aura&quot; (&#x27;aura&#x27;) (Eastern Standard), (Algherese).
:* Unstressed () reduces to like most Eastern Catalan dialects.

;Consonants

:Notes:
:* Algherese preserves as a distinct phoneme from , like Balearic and most of Valencian: &quot;viu&quot; (&#x27;he/she lives&#x27;) (Algherese).
:* Mutation of intervocalic and to : &quot;Barceloneta&quot; (Eastern Standard), (Algherese) &#x27;Barcelonette&#x27;; and &quot;vila&quot; (&#x27;town&#x27;) and &quot;vida&quot; (&#x27;life&#x27;) are homophones in Algherese .
:* Mutation of syllable final (or ) to lateral , and the possible resulting group + consonant is further simplified to : &quot;forn&quot; (Eastern Standard), (Algherese) &#x27;oven&#x27;.
:* Depalatalisation of syllable final sonorants: lateral to , nasal to : ball&quot; (Eastern Standard), (Algherese) &#x27;dance&#x27;; &quot;any (Eastern Standard), (Algherese) &#x27;year&#x27;.

== Morphology ==
*The simple past is replaced by the present perfect (present of &quot;haver&quot; &quot;to have&quot; + past participle), possibly by Italian influence.
*The imperfect past preserves etymological -v- in all conjugations: 1st -&quot;ava&quot;, 2nd -&quot;iva&quot;, 3rd -&quot;iva&quot; unlike modern Eastern and Western Standard Catalan, which use 1st -&quot;ava&quot;, 2nd -&quot;ia&quot;, 3rd -&quot;ia&quot;, a feature shared with the Ribagorçan dialect.
*Large-scale lexical borrowing and calques from Sardinian, Spanish and Italian: nearly half of the vocabulary is not from Catalan.

== Differences from Standard Catalan ==
The Algherese variant is Eastern Catalan, but it has many differences from Central Catalan, with some of the most obvious ones as follows:

=== Vocabulary ===


The following abbreviations are used: m. (masculine), f. (feminine), pl. (plural), f. pl. (feminine plural), inf. (informal), f. (formal).
The following phrases were gathered from a Catalan translation set, but the common phrases in Algherese are similar:

== Literature ==

The &quot;Premi Rafael Sari&quot;, organised by the &quot;Obra Cultural de l&#x27;Alguer&quot;, is a series of prizes awarded in September each year to the best literary works of poetry and prose written in Algherese Catalan.

Notable poets include Rafael Sari, Pasquale Scanu and Maria Chessa Lai. There is also a long tradition of writing and performing songs in Algherese Catalan and the &quot;Premi Pino Piras&quot; is awarded for new songs written in the language. Notable singer-songwriters include Pino Piras and Franca Masu.

In 2015 Carla Valentino published an Algherese translation of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s &quot;The Little Prince&quot;.

<text>The Shenandoah Valley () is a geographic valley and cultural region of western Virginia and the eastern panhandle of West Virginia in the United States. The Valley is bounded to the east by the Blue Ridge Mountains, to the west by the eastern front of the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians (excluding Massanutten Mountain), to the north by the Potomac River, to the south by the James River, and to the Southwest by the New River Valley. The cultural region covers a larger area that includes all of the Valley plus the Virginia Highlands to the west and the Roanoke Valley to the south. It is physiographically located within the Ridge and Valley Province and is a portion of the Great Appalachian Valley.

==Geography==
Named for the river that stretches much of its length, the Shenandoah Valley encompasses eight counties in Virginia and two counties in West Virginia:
*Augusta County, Virginia
*Clarke County, Virginia
*Frederick County, Virginia
*Page County, Virginia
*Rockbridge County, Virginia
*Rockingham County, Virginia
*Shenandoah County, Virginia
*Warren County, Virginia
*Berkeley County, West Virginia
*Jefferson County, West Virginia

The antebellum composition included four additional counties that are now in West Virginia as well as four additional Virginia counties:
*Morgan County, West Virginia
*Hampshire County, West Virginia
*Hardy County, West Virginia
*Pendleton County, West Virginia
*Botetourt County, Virginia
*Alleghany County, Virginia
*Bath County, Virginia
*Highland County, Virginia

The cultural region includes five more counties in Virginia:
*Highland County
*Bath County
*Alleghany County
*Botetourt County
*Roanoke County

Between the Roanoke Valley in the south and Harpers Ferry in the north, where the Shenandoah River joins the Potomac, the Valley cultural region contains 10 independent cities:
*Winchester
*Harrisonburg
*Waynesboro
*Staunton
*Lexington
*Buena Vista
*Covington
*Roanoke
*Salem

The central section of the Shenandoah Valley is split in half by the Massanutten Mountain range, with the smaller associated Page Valley lying to its east and Fort Valley within the mountain range.

===Notable caves===
The Shenandoah Valley contains a number of geologically and historically significant limestone caves:
*Skyline Caverns
*Luray Caverns, designated a National Natural Landmark in 1974
*Shenandoah Caverns
*Endless Caverns
*Grand Caverns, designated a National Natural Landmark in 1973
*Dixie Caverns

==Etymology==
The word &quot;Shenandoah&quot; is of unknown Native American origin. It has been described as being derived from the Anglicization of Native American terms, resulting in words such as Gerando, Gerundo, Genantua, Shendo and Sherando. The meaning of these words is of some question. &quot;Schin-han-dowi&quot;, the &quot;River Through the Spruces&quot;; &quot;On-an-da-goa&quot;, the &quot;River of High Mountains&quot; or &quot;Silver-Water&quot;; and an Iroquois word for &quot;Big Meadow&quot;, have all been proposed by Native American etymologists. The most popular, romanticized belief is that the name comes from a Native American expression for &quot;Beautiful Daughter of the Stars&quot;.

Another legend relates that the name is derived from the name of the Iroquoian chief &quot;Sherando&quot; (Sherando was also the name of his people), who fought against the Algonquian Chief &quot;Opechancanough&quot;, ruler of the Powhatan Confederacy (1618–1644). Opechancanough liked the interior country so much that he sent his son &quot;Sheewa-a-nee&quot; from the Tidewater with a large party to colonize the valley. Sheewa-a-nee drove Sherando back to his former territory near the Great Lakes. According to this account, descendants of Sheewanee&#x27;s party became the Shawnee. According to tradition, another branch of Iroquoians, the &quot;Senedo&quot;, lived in present-day Shenandoah County. They were exterminated by &quot;Southern Indians&quot; (Catawba or Cherokee) before the arrival of white settlers.

Another story dates to the American Revolutionary War. Throughout the war, Chief Skenandoa of the Oneida, an Iroquois nation based in New York, persuaded many of the tribe to side with the colonials against the British. Four Iroquois nations became British allies and caused many fatalities and damage in the frontier settlements west of Albany. Skenandoa led 250 warriors against the British and Iroquois allies. According to Oneida oral tradition, during the harsh winter of 1777–1778 at Valley Forge, where the colonials suffered, Chief Skenando provided aid to the soldiers. The Oneida delivered bushels of dry corn to the troops to help them survive. Polly Cooper, an Oneida woman, stayed some time with the troops to teach them how to cook the corn properly and care for the sick. General Washington gave her a shawl in thanks, which is displayed at &quot;Shako:wi,&quot; the museum of the Oneida Nation near Syracuse, New York. Many Oneida believe that after the war, George Washington named the Shenandoah River and valley after his ally.

==History==
===First European explorers===
Despite the valley&#x27;s potential for productive farmland, colonial settlement from the east was long delayed by the barrier of the Blue Ridge Mountains. These were crossed by explorers John Lederer at Manassas Gap in 1671, Batts and Fallam the same year, and Cadwallader Jones in 1682. The Swiss Franz Ludwig Michel and Christoph von Graffenried explored and mapped the Valley in 1706 and 1712, respectively. Von Graffenried reported that the Indians of &quot;Senantona&quot; (Shenandoah) had been alarmed by news of the recent Tuscarora War in North Carolina.

===18th century===
Governor Alexander Spotswood&#x27;s legendary Knights of the Golden Horseshoe Expedition of 1716 crossed the Blue Ridge at Swift Run Gap and reached the river at Elkton, Virginia. Settlers did not immediately follow, but someone who heard the reports and later became the first permanent settler in the Valley was Adam Miller (Mueller), who in 1727 staked out claims on the south fork of the Shenandoah River, near the line that now divides Rockingham County from Page County.

The Great Wagon Road (later called the Valley Pike or Valley Turnpike) began as the Great Warriors Trail or Indian Road, a Native road through common hunting grounds shared by several tribes settled around the periphery, which included Iroquoian, Siouan and Algonquian-language family tribes. Known native settlements within the Valley were few but included the Shawnee occupying the region around Winchester, and Tuscarora around what is now Martinsburg, West Virginia. In the late 1720s and 1730s, Quakers and Mennonites began to move in from Pennsylvania. They were tolerated by the natives, while &quot;Long Knives&quot; (English settlers from coastal Virginia colony) were less welcomed. During these same decades, the valley route continued to be used by war parties of Seneca (Iroquois) and Lenape &quot;en route&quot; from New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey to attack the distant Catawba in the Carolinas, with whom they were at war. The Catawba in turn pursued the war parties northward, often overtaking them by the time they reached the Potomac. Several fierce battles were fought among the warring nations in the Valley region, as attested by the earliest European-American settlers.

Later colonists called this route the Great Wagon Road; it became the major thoroughfare for immigrants&#x27; moving by wagons from Pennsylvania and northern Virginia into the backcountry of the South. The Valley Turnpike Company improved the road by paving it with macadam prior to the Civil War and set up toll gates to collect fees to pay for the improvements. After the advent of motor vehicles, the road was refined and paved appropriately for their use. In the 20th century, the road was acquired by the Commonwealth of Virginia, which incorporated it into the state highway system as U.S. Route 11. For much of its length, the newer Interstate 81, constructed in the 1960s, parallels the old Valley Pike.

Along with the first German settlers, known as &quot;Shenandoah Deitsch&quot;, many Scotch-Irish immigrants came south in the 1730s from Pennsylvania into the valley, via the Potomac River. The Scotch-Irish comprised the largest group of non-English immigrants from the British Isles before the Revolutionary War, and most migrated into the backcountry of the South. This was in contrast to the chiefly English immigrants who had settled the Virginia Tidewater and Carolina Piedmont regions.

Along with the Ulster Scots many Irishmen arrived in the Shenandoah valley, usually after their indentured service was up. These Irishmen usually had converted to Protestantism or kept their faith secret. In the 18th-century Thirteen Colonies and the independent United States, while interethnic marriage among Catholics remained a dominant pattern, Catholic-Protestant intermarriage became more common (notably in the Shenandoah Valley where intermarriage among Ulster Protestants and the significant minority of Irish Catholics in particular was not uncommon or stigmatized), and while fewer Catholic parents required that their children be disinherited in their wills if they renounced Catholicism, it remained more common among Catholic parents to do so if their children renounced their parents&#x27; faith than it was in the rest of the U.S. population.

Governor Spotswood had arranged the Treaty of Albany with the Iroquois (Six Nations) in 1721, whereby they had agreed not to come east of the Blue Ridge in their raiding parties on tribes farther to the South. In 1736, the Iroquois began to object, claiming that they still legally owned the land to the west of the Blue Ridge; this led to a skirmish with Valley settlers in 1743. The Iroquois were on the verge of declaring war on the Virginia Colony as a result, when Governor Gooch paid them the sum of 100 pounds sterling for any settled land in the Valley that was claimed by them. The following year at the Treaty of Lancaster, the Iroquois sold all their remaining claim to the Valley for 200 pounds in gold.

The few Shawnees who still resided in the Valley abruptly headed westward in 1754, having been approached the year before by emissaries from their kindred beyond the Alleghenies.

===19th century===
The Shenandoah Valley was known as the breadbasket of the Confederacy during the Civil War and was seen as a backdoor for Confederate raids on Maryland, Washington, and Pennsylvania. Because of its strategic importance it was the scene of three major campaigns. The first was the Valley Campaign of 1862, in which Confederate General Stonewall Jackson defended the Valley against three numerically superior Union armies. The final two were the Valley Campaigns of 1864. First, in the summer of 1864, Confederate General Jubal Early cleared the Valley of its Union occupiers and then proceeded to raid Maryland, Pennsylvania, and D.C. Then during the autumn, Union General Philip Sheridan was sent to drive Early from the Valley and once-and-for-all deny its use to the Confederates through the use of scorched-earth tactics. The Valley, especially in the lower northern section, was also the scene of bitter partisan fighting as the region&#x27;s inhabitants were deeply divided over loyalties, and Confederate partisan John Mosby and his Rangers frequently operated in the area.

===20th century===
A series of newspaper mergers, ending in 1914, established the Daily News-Record of Harrisonburg as the daily newspaper of the Shenandoah Valley.

In the late 20th century, the Valley&#x27;s vineyards began to reach maturity. They constituted the new industry of the Shenandoah Valley American Viticultural Area.

===21st century===
In 2018, a series of strikes and protests were held in Dayton&#x27;s Cargill plant.

==Transportation==
Transportation in the Shenandoah Valley consists mainly of road and rail and contains several metropolitan area transit authorities. The main north-south road transportation is Interstate 81, which parallels the old Valley Turnpike (U.S. Route 11) and the ancient Great Path of the Native Americans through its course in the valley. In the lower (northern) valley, on the eastern side, U.S. Route 340 also runs north-south, starting from Waynesboro in the south, running through the Page Valley to Front Royal, and on to Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, where it exits the valley into Maryland. Major east-west roads cross the valley as well, providing access to the Piedmont and the Allegheny Mountains. Starting from the north, these routes include U.S. Route 50, U.S. Route 522, Interstate 66, U.S. Route 33, U.S. Route 250, Interstate 64, and U.S. Route 60.

CSX Transportation operates several rail lines through the valley, including the old Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, Virginia Central Railroad. Norfolk Southern operates the old Manassas Gap Railroad and the Norfolk and Western and Chesapeake Western. There are also more modern lines that run the length of the valley parallel to the Valley Pike and U.S. 340. The rail lines are primarily used for freight transportation, though Maryland Area Rail Commuter (MARC) trains utilize the old B&amp;O line from stations in Martinsburg, Duffields, and Harper&#x27;s Ferry to Washington Union Station in Washington, D.C., and vice versa. Amtrak utilizes Harpers Ferry and Martinsburg as well along the &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; route. Amtrak also runs the &quot;Cardinal&quot; through the valley along the old Virginia Central. 

Several localities in the valley operate public transportation systems, including Front Royal Area Transit (FRAT), which provides weekday transit for the town of Front Royal; Page County Transit, providing weekday transit for the town of Luray and weekday service between Luray and Front Royal; and Winchester Transit, which provides weekday transit for the city of Winchester. In addition, Shenandoah Valley Commuter Bus Service offers weekday commuter bus service from the northern Shenandoah Valley, including Shenandoah County and Warren County, to Northern Virginia (Arlington County and Fairfax County) and Washington. Origination points in Shenandoah County include Woodstock. Origination points in Warren County include Front Royal and Linden.

==In popular culture==
The Shenandoah Valley serves as the setting for the 1965 film &quot;Shenandoah&quot; and its 1974 musical adaptation. Both stories follow the Anderson family during the Civil War. An associated song by James Stewart titled &quot;The Legend of Shenandoah&quot; was a very minor hit in 1965, reaching #133 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Bubbling Under the Hot 100 chart. One of the most famous cultural references to the area does not mention the valley itself: West Virginia&#x27;s state song, &quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot; by John Denver, contains the words &quot;Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River&quot; in the first verse.

<text>A gender-specific job title is a name of a job that also specifies or implies the gender of the person performing that job. For example, in English, the job titles &quot;stewardess&quot; and &quot;seamstress&quot; imply that the person is female, whilst the corresponding job titles &quot;steward&quot; and &quot;seamster&quot; imply that the person is male. A gender-neutral job title, on the other hand, is one that does not specify or imply gender, such as &quot;firefighter&quot; or &quot;lawyer&quot;. In some cases, it may be debatable whether a title is gender-specific; for example, &quot;chairman&quot; appears to denote a male (because of the ending &quot;-man&quot;), but the title is also applied sometimes to women.

Proponents of gender-neutral language generally advocate the use of gender-neutral job titles, particularly in contexts where the gender of the person in question is not known or not specified. For example, they prefer &quot;flight attendant&quot; to &quot;stewardess&quot; or &quot;steward&quot;, and &quot;police officer&quot; to &quot;policeman&quot; or &quot;policewoman&quot;. In some cases this may involve deprecating the use of certain specifically female titles (such as &quot;authoress&quot;), thus encouraging the use of the corresponding unmarked form (such as &quot;author&quot;) as a fully gender-neutral title.

The above applies to gender neutrality in English and in some other languages without grammatical gender (where grammatical gender is a feature of a language&#x27;s grammar that requires every noun to be placed in one of several classes, often including feminine and masculine). In languages with grammatical gender, the situation is altered by the fact that nouns for people are often constrained to be inherently masculine or feminine, and the production of truly gender-neutral titles may not be possible. In such cases, proponents of gender-neutral language may instead focus on ensuring that feminine and masculine words exist for every job, and that they are treated with equal status.

==Examples==
The suffix &quot;-man&quot; had the meanings &quot;person&quot; and &quot;adult male&quot; in Old English (see &quot;man&quot;), but, even when used as a gender-neutral term to include women, it was understood to still mainly refer to males. Around the 20th century, the gender-neutral use of &quot;man&quot; and -&quot;man&quot; declined. Thus job titles that include this suffix, such as &quot;fireman&quot;, &quot;salesman&quot; and &quot;alderman&quot;, generally imply that the holder is male. While some of these job titles have feminine variants (e.g. &quot;alderwoman&quot;), others do not, because traditionally the positions in question were not occupied by women. For most such titles, gender-neutral equivalents now also exist, such as &quot;police officer&quot;, &quot;salesperson&quot; or &quot;sales representative&quot; (for &quot;salesman&quot; or &quot;saleswoman&quot;), etc. However, some proposed gender-neutral terms have not attained such common usage (as with &quot;fisher&quot; as an alternative to &quot;fisherman&quot;). Military ranks with the suffix &quot;-man&quot; normally remain unchanged when applied to women: for example, a woman serving in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers might be known as Craftsman Atkins.

Examining the &quot;Time&quot; magazine corpus (texts from the 1920s to the 2000s), researcher Maria Bovin found:
In the case of &quot;chairman&quot;, gender-neutral alternatives (such as &quot;chair&quot; and &quot;chairperson&quot;) exist, although in some contexts the word &quot;chairman&quot; is used even where it denotes (or could denote) a woman. For details, see &quot;Chairman&quot;.

Feminine terms such as &quot;actress&quot;, &quot;usherette&quot; and &quot;comedienne&quot; are marked with respect to the masculine (&quot;actor&quot;, &quot;usher&quot;, &quot;comedian&quot;) both formally (i.e. something is added to the masculine form) and in the sense that only the masculine form can be used generically to describe a mixed-gender group of people. This means that the &quot;masculine&quot; form can in fact serve as a gender-neutral term (a solution often favored by proponents of gender-neutral language, who thus tend to deprecate or restrict usage of the specifically feminine forms). Some such feminine forms, such as &quot;poetess&quot; and &quot;authoress&quot;, are now rarely used. Others, such as &quot;actress&quot;, remain common, although increasing numbers of women are calling themselves &quot;actors&quot; rather than &quot;actresses&quot;. The Screen Actors Guild annually gives out awards for &quot;Best Male Actor&quot; and &quot;Best Female Actor&quot;.

The term &quot;waiter&quot; appears to retain masculine specificity (with &quot;waitress&quot; as the corresponding feminine term). Other gender-neutral terms have therefore been proposed, such as &quot;server&quot; (alternatives include &quot;waitron&quot;, &quot;waitstaff&quot; or &quot;waitperson&quot;), though these are rarely used outside North America.

The term &quot;midwife&quot; looks superficially to be feminine (since it ends with &quot;-wife&quot;), but it is used for either gender. The term comes from an Old English term meaning &quot;with the woman&quot;.

In an examination of &quot;business-related titles&quot; such as businessman and business people, &quot;overall usage of these terms seems to have decreased since the 1960s&quot; when examining &quot;Time&quot; magazine: When &quot;looking specifically at the difference between the gender-marked titles and the gender-neutral ones, businessperson(s) and businesspeople, there has been an increase usage of the neutral businesspeople (if all spelling variations are included). Yet, this is not a large increase, and as it is used to refer to a group of people rather than an individual, its relevance may be questionable. Noticeable is the fact that businessperson is remarkably infrequent, and only appears in three decades. The term businesswoman may be increasing again between the 1980s and the 2000s, after a lower usage in the preceding fifty years. It has its highest frequency of usage in the 1920s.&quot;

Origin of the word &quot;master&quot; are late Old English: &quot;a man having control or authority; a teacher or tutor&quot;, from Latin &quot;magister&quot; (n.), a contrastive adjective (&quot;he who is greater&quot;) meaning &quot;chief, head, director, teacher&quot;, and the source of Old French &quot;maistre&quot;, French &quot;maître&quot;, Spanish and Italian &quot;maestro&quot;, Portuguese &quot;mestre&quot;, Dutch &quot;meester&quot;, German &quot;Meister&quot;.

&quot;Garner&#x27;s Usage Tip of the Day&quot; states, in regards to &quot;layman; layperson; lay person&quot;, that Layman&#x27; is the most common among these terms and is commonly regarded as unexceptionable — in reference to members of both sexes, of course.&quot;

==Evolution over time==
The case for switching to gender-neutral job titles usually makes an ideological argument, that gender-specific job titles at some level promote sexism in the workplace. For example, fire chiefs have argued that when the public uses the term &quot;fireman&quot; instead of &quot;firefighter&quot;, it reinforces the popular image that firefighting is only a job for men, and thus makes it difficult for them to recruit women. Studies found that people assume maleness when they read job titles with &quot;-man&quot;, and they found that women were less likely to apply to jobs that used &quot;-man&quot; in their application or that used gender-coded words such as &quot;dominate&quot; or &quot;aggressive.&quot;

During the 19th century, attempts to overlay Latin grammar rules onto English required the use of feminine endings in nouns ending with -ess. This produced words like &quot;doctress&quot; and &quot;professoress&quot; and even &quot;lawyeress&quot;, all of which have fallen out of use; though &quot;waitress&quot;, &quot;stewardess&quot;, and &quot;actress&quot; are in modern use.

Use of the term &quot;chairman&quot; remains widespread in predominantly male sectors of society, but &quot;chairperson&quot; or &quot;chair&quot; is now widespread in society in general, at least in the US, Canada and increasingly in the UK. For example, the boards of most Fortune 500 companies in the United States are presided over by a &quot;chairman&quot; and also the overwhelming majority of the (FTSE 100) companies in the United Kingdom have a &quot;chairman&quot;, while committees in the United States House of Representatives are presided over by a &quot;chair&quot;, as of 2009. Since most of these are, however, men, a more correct description of the current language situation needs to consider use in organisations whose chairperson is a woman. Less than half of the members of the &quot;American Heritage Dictionary&quot;&#x27;s usage panel accept the use of the word &quot;chairman&quot; in describing a woman.

Some usage guides, such as &quot;The Cambridge Guide to English Usage&quot;, advocate gender-neutral language in circumstances where all sexes are meant to be included. For instance, a business might advertise that it is looking for a new &quot;chair&quot; or &quot;chairperson&quot; rather than &quot;chairman&quot;. Gender-neutral language discourages &quot;chairman&quot;, on the grounds that some readers would assume women and those of other genders are implicitly excluded from responding to an advertisement using this word.

&quot;Feminist Philosophy of Language&quot;, a guide on sexism in language and feminist language reform, also discourages the usage of &quot;man&quot; and &quot;-man&quot; as gender-neutral because it has male bias and erases women under a masculine word. They also discourage titles like &quot;lady doctor&quot; because it makes men the default and implies that the ability and competence of workers, in this case a doctor, are dependent on their sex.

The United States military has also examined traditional job titles, in line with the 2016 decision to allow women to serve in all combat jobs.

==Generally accepted writing conventions==
Proponents of gender-neutral job titles believe that such titles should be used, especially when referring to hypothetical persons. For example, &quot;firefighter&quot; instead of &quot;fireman&quot;; &quot;mail carrier&quot;, &quot;letter carrier&quot;, or &quot;post worker&quot; rather than &quot;mailman&quot;; &quot;flight attendant&quot; instead of &quot;steward&quot; or &quot;stewardess&quot;; &quot;bartender&quot; instead of &quot;barman&quot; or &quot;barmaid&quot;. In the rare case where no useful gender-neutral alternative is available, they believe both male and female terms should be used.

Proponents of gender-neutral language advocate the use of a neuter form when/where appropriate. For example, a company may seek to fill a vacancy and hire a new &quot;chairperson&quot;. Since a gendered individual doesn&#x27;t currently hold the position, its title reverts to a neuter form. Once that position is filled, many advocates believe gender can be attached to the title as appropriate (chair&quot;man&quot; or chair&quot;woman&quot;).

Sometimes this formulation can lead to inconsistent gender-specific usage, in which women become &quot;chairpersons&quot; but men remain &quot;chairmen&quot;. Some women opt to use the word &quot;chairman&quot; in preference to &quot;chairwoman&quot;, subject to the style &quot;Madam&quot; or &quot;Mister&quot; prefixing the title, which they perceive to be gender-neutral by itself. Particularly in academia, the word Chair is often used to designate the person chosen to oversee the agenda at meetings of an organized group.

The principle of gender-neutral language dictates that job titles that add suffixes to make them feminine should be avoided. For example, &quot;usher&quot;, not &quot;usherette&quot;; &quot;comedian&quot;, not &quot;comedienne&quot;. Some of these are almost entirely obsolete now, such as sculptress, authoress, poetess, and aviatrix. If gender is relevant, the words &quot;woman&quot; or &quot;female&quot; should be used instead of &quot;lady&quot; (&quot;my grandmother was the first female doctor in the province&quot;), except if the masculine is &quot;lord&quot; (as in &quot;landlady&quot;). In the case of landlord or landlady, it may be preferable to find an equivalent title with the same meaning, such as proprietor or lessor. However, when a woman is in the office of &quot;the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod&quot;, it is changed to &quot;the Lady Usher of the Black Rod&quot; or simply &quot;Usher of the Black Rod&quot;, as in Canada.

Advisors on non-sexist usage deprecate terms such as &quot;male nurse&quot;, &quot;female doctor&quot;, &quot;male model&quot;, or &quot;female judge&quot; because such terms are often used when the gender and sex is irrelevant. These advisors say that the statement of exception reinforces harmful assumptions about the gender of people in those professions.

==Languages other than English==

When words have a grammatical gender associated with them, in many languages, they may impose morphological requirements to maintain sentence agreement. That is, there is a non-political content to the word changes, or inflection. Nevertheless, gender-identification word endings are sometimes dropped, something that happened often in the former East Germany, for example. Sometimes an entirely new or etymologically unrelated word is coined. For example, when men in France wanted to become midwives, which up until then was an exclusively female occupation, they chose not to adapt the existing term (&#x27;wise woman&#x27;), and instead coined .

In German, feminine job titles are usually created by adding -&quot;in&quot; to the grammatically masculine word in question. For example, the general grammatically masculine term for train driver is (singular or plural). This yields the feminine form (plural: ). One convention in German for gender-neutral language is adding a gender star, e.g. &quot;&quot;, which is used to refer to train drivers of all genders. For job listings, if the generic masculine form is used, the Gesellschaft für deutsche Sprache recommends adding an explanatory note &quot;(männlich/weiblich/divers)&quot; or &quot;(m/w/d)&quot;, indicating the role is open to persons of all genders. 

In contrast, the German military does not have separate gendered ranks. Even though the grammatically female form of &quot;Arzt&quot; is &quot;Ärztin&quot;, the correct form of address for a female medical officer is &quot;&quot;Frau Stabsarzt&quot; and not &quot;Frau Stabsärztin&quot;&quot;.

<text>Kenilworth ( ) is a market town and civil parish in the Warwick District of Warwickshire, England, south-west of Coventry and north of Warwick. The town lies on Finham Brook, a tributary of the River Sowe, which joins the River Avon north-east of the town. At the 2021 Census, its population was 22,538. The town is home to the ruins of Kenilworth Castle and Kenilworth Abbey.

==History==
===Medieval and Tudor===
A settlement existed at Kenilworth by the time of the 1086 Domesday Book, which records it as &quot;Chinewrde&quot;.

Geoffrey de Clinton (died 1134) initiated the building of an Augustinian priory in 1122, which coincided with his initiation of Kenilworth Castle. The priory was raised to the rank of an abbey in 1450 and suppressed with the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 1530s. Thereafter, the abbey grounds next to the castle were made common land in exchange for what Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester used to enlarge the castle. Only a few walls and a storage barn of the original abbey survive.
During the Middle Ages, Kenilworth played a significant role in the history of England: Between June and December 1266, as part of the Second Barons&#x27; War, Kenilworth Castle underwent a six-month siege, when baronial forces allied to Simon de Montfort, were besieged in the castle by the Royalist forces led by Prince Edward, this is thought to be the longest siege in Medieval English history. Despite numerous efforts at taking the castle, its defences proved impregnable. Whilst the siege was ongoing King Henry III held a Parliament at Kenilworth in August that year, which resulted in the Dictum of Kenilworth; a conciliatory document which set out peace terms to end the conflict between the barons and the monarchy. The barons initially refused to accept, but hunger and disease eventually forced them to surrender, and accept the terms of the Dictum.

During the Wars of the Roses in the 15th century, Kenilworth Castle served as an important Lancastrian base in the Midlands: The Lancastrian King Henry VI and his wife, Margaret of Anjou spent much time here.
Elizabeth I visited Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester at Kenilworth Castle several times, the last in 1575. Dudley entertained the Queen with pageants and banquets costing some £1,000 per day that surpassed anything seen in England before. These included fireworks.

Near the castle there is a group of thatched cottages called &#x27;Little Virginia&#x27;: According to local legend they gained this name because the first potatoes brought to England by Sir Walter Raleigh from the New World were planted and grown here in the 16th century. Modern historians however consider this unlikely, and have suggested that the name may have originated from early colonists to America returning to England from Virginia.

===17th and 18th centuries===
During the English Civil War, Kenilworth Castle, was occupied by Parliamentarians, after the Royalist garrison was withdrawn. After the end of the war, the castle&#x27;s defences were slighted on the orders of Parliament in 1649, after which the castle became a ruin.

In 1778 Kenilworth windmill was built. In 1884, it was converted into a water tower, by the addition of a large water tank on the top of the tower in the place of the sails. It continued to be the town&#x27;s main water supply until 1939, and finally became disused in 1960. It is still a local landmark, but is now a private home.

===19th century to present===
With the demise of the defensive role of the castle, Kenilworth had ceased to be a place of national significance, but Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s 1821 novel &quot;Kenilworth&quot; brought it back to public attention, and helped establish the ruins of the castle as a major tourist attraction.

In the early 19th century Kenilworth was known for its horn comb making industry, which peaked in the 1830s.

Kenilworth was revolutionised by the arrival of the railway to the town in 1844, when the London and Birmingham Railway opened the Coventry to Leamington Line, including Kenilworth railway station. The station was rebuilt in 1884 and a new link line was opened between Kenilworth and to bypass . This closed to all traffic on 3 March 1969. The railway station was located to the south of the Finham Brook valley, and this caused the focus of settlement at Kenilworth to move south, away from the castle, and nearer to the railway station. Industrialists from Birmingham and Coventry arrived, developing the area around the town&#x27;s railway station with residential and commercial buildings. In the 19th century Kenilworth had some fine large mansions with landscaped gardens; these were demolished after the First World War and Second World War to make way for housing developments. The railway also brought a number of new industries to Kenilworth, such as tanning, brick making, and chemicals, and also caused substantial growth in Kenilworth&#x27;s market gardening, which became known for producing crops such as tomatoes and strawberries.
The town&#x27;s growth occasioned the addition of a second Church of England parish church, St John&#x27;s, which is on Warwick Road in Knights Meadow. It was designed by Ewan Christian and built in 1851–1852 as a Gothic Revival building with a south-west bell tower and broach spire. By the 1870s Kenilworth&#x27;s population had exceeded 4,000.
In 1869, local whitesmith and engineer Edward Langley Fardon demonstrated the first bicycle with wire-spoked wheels and rubber tyres, riding from Warwick Road to Leek Wootton.

During The Blitz in World War II on the night of 21 November 1940, a German aircraft dropped two parachute mines on Kenilworth; the large explosions in the Abbey End area demolished a number of buildings, killing 25 people, and injuring 70 more. The bomb damaged area of the town was redeveloped in the 1960s.

In May 1961, the Kenilworth Society was formed over concerns about protecting a group of 17th-century listed cottages adjacent to Finham Brook in Bridge Street. The Society sets out to promote awareness of Kenilworth&#x27;s character and encourage its preservation.

British Rail withdrew passenger services from the Coventry to Leamington Line and closed Kenilworth Station in January 1965 in line with &quot;The Reshaping of British Railways&quot; report. In May 1977, British Rail reinstated passenger services, but did not reopen Kenilworth station, which became derelict and was eventually demolished. In 2011 Warwick Council granted John Laing plc planning permission to build a new station, It finally reopened in 2018.

In the early 1980s, the town&#x27;s name was used by one of the first generation of computer retailers, a company called Kenilworth Computers based near the Clock Tower, for its repackaging of the Nascom microcomputer, with the selling point that it was robust enough to be used by agriculture.

Kenilworth was struck by an F0/T1 tornado on 23 November 1981, as part of the record-breaking nationwide outbreak on that day.

==Geography==

Kenilworth has several suburbs, including Borrowell, Castle Green, Crackley, Ladyes Hill, Mill End, Park Hill, St Johns, Whitemoor and Windy Arbour. The town has good transport links to Coventry, Warwick, Leamington Spa and Birmingham.

==Amenities==

The principal shopping area of Kenilworth is around Warwick Street, Abbey End and Talisman Square, a 1960s shopping precinct. In 2008, the Square was modernised and partly redeveloped to include a new Waitrose supermarket. Kenilworth has been a Fairtrade Town since 2007. The town&#x27;s public library underwent a renovation in 2021. &quot;The Cross&quot;, a local pub-restaurant, received a Michelin star in 2015.

Near the centre of Kenilworth is Abbey Fields, a public park which covers within the valley of Finham Brook. Abbey Fields contains the ruins of the historic Kenilworth Abbey as well as St Nicholas Church. It contains public amenities such as a swimming pool, a lake, a children&#x27;s play area and heritage trails. There are several further public open spaces in Kenilworth, including Kenilworth Common, an area of historic common land covering . Parliament Piece, a field and nature reserve covering , was where, according to legend, King Henry III held a Parliament in 1266. Knowle Hill Nature Reserve, managed by the Warwickshire Wildlife Trust, is found near the Common and covers .

==Landmarks==
In the centre of Kenilworth stands a Kugel ball water feature, called the Millennium Globe.

Kenilworth&#x27;s clock tower (pictured at top of article) is an important local landmark. It was first built in 1906–1907 by a notable local benefactor, George Marshall Turner, as a memorial for his late wife. It stands in a roundabout in the town centre. The top part of the tower was severely damaged in 1940 by World War II bombing and had to be pulled down, it was fully restored in the 1970s. The clock tower is locally listed as a heritage asset by Warwick District Council.

==Governance==

There are three tiers of local government covering Kenilworth, at parish (town), district and county level: Kenilworth Town Council, Warwick District Council and Warwickshire County Council. The town council is based at Jubilee House on Smalley Place in the town centre.

Kenilworth gained a local board of health in 1877, which was converted into an Urban District Council in 1894. Under local government reforms in 1974 Kenilworth Urban District was merged into the new Warwick District along with Warwick and Leamington Spa. The former urban district of Kenilworth was then reconstituted as a successor parish with a Town (parish) Council.

Since 2010, Kenilworth has been part of the Parliamentary constituency of Kenilworth and Southam; prior to that it was part of Rugby and Kenilworth.

==Transport==

Kenilworth railway station is situated on the Coventry to Leamington Spa line. The original station was closed in 1965 and later demolished; in April 2018, a new station was opened. West Midlands Trains operates services to , and .

==Sport==

*Kenilworth Town FC, located in Gypsy Lane in the south of the town, played in the Midland Combination until June 2011, when it resigned, preferring to spend money on ground improvements rather than fielding a team. It re-entered the English football pyramid in the 2013–14 season and was placed in the Midland Football League Division 3, the 12th highest tier in the English league system. The stay, however, was brief; the first team again resigned shortly afterwards. The Gypsy Lane ground was purchased in 2018 by Coventry Plumbing F.C., which demolished the clubhouse and built a new one, before starting the 2019–20 season there.
*Kenilworth Wardens FC is based at Kenilworth Wardens, a Community Amateur Sports Club in Glasshouse Lane to the east of the town.
*Kenilworth RFC is the town&#x27;s rugby union club. It fields three senior sides and hosts a large minis, juniors and colts section. The ground is also located in Glasshouse Lane.
*Kenilworth Tennis, Squash and Croquet Club, in Crackley Lane, has nine tennis courts, five squash and racketball courts and two croquet lawns.
*Kenilworth has two cricket clubs: Kenilworth Wardens in Glasshouse Lane fields five senior teams and a juniors section starting from seven years old; Kenilworth Cricket Club fields three senior teams and plays at the Warwick Road ground.

=== Two Castles Run ===
The Two Castles Run began in 1983 as a fun run between Warwick Castle and Kenilworth Castle. It has grown into an English Athletics-licensed run with 3,000 entrants in 2010. In 2010 and 2011 it held the Warwickshire Amateur Athletic Association 10 Kilometre Championship. In 2012 all 4,000 places were sold within 25 hours. The race is organised each June by Kenilworth Rotary Club in conjunction with the Leamington Cycling and Athletic Club.

==Arts==

===Theatres===
The Talisman Theatre and Arts Centre, founded as Talisman Players in 1942, moved to its current 156-seat premises in Barrow Road in 1969. It won twelve NODA awards between 2004 and 2018.

The Talisman produces around 9 main stage shows a year including performances from the Talisman Youth Theatre. Since 2022, The Talisman Theatre has been presenting Fringe nights at the Holiday Inn, Kenilworth. The Talisman Theatre also operates a monthly cinema night showing recent films.

Work started in 2022 on a two-phase development of the Talisman Theatre.

The Priory Theatre, founded in 1932 as the Kenilworth Players, uses the former Unitarian/Christadelphian chapel, a Gothic Revival building dating from 1816, which was converted into a 119-seat theatre building in 1945–1946. It was gutted by fire in 1976, but restored and reopened in September 1978.

===Kenilworth Arts Festival===
The first Kenilworth Festival was held in 1935. After a 70-year interval, it was revived locally in 2005. Between 2005 and 2015, events were held almost every year, with varying success. The company became a social enterprise in 2010. In 2015–16, a new team oversaw a change in direction, with a new name, branding and mission statement, as &#x27;Kenilworth Arts Festival&#x27;.

Kenilworth Arts Festival took place again on 19–28 September 2019.

<doc id="176263" wikidata="Q2374330" url="?curid=176263" title="Battle of Atlanta">
<text>The Battle of Atlanta took place during the Atlanta Campaign of the American Civil War on July 22, 1864, just southeast of Atlanta, Georgia. Continuing their summer campaign to seize the important rail and supply hub of Atlanta, Union forces commanded by William Tecumseh Sherman overwhelmed and defeated Confederate forces defending the city under John Bell Hood. Union Major General James B. McPherson was killed during the battle, the second-highest-ranking Union officer killed in action during the war. Despite the implication of finality in its name, the battle occurred midway through the Atlanta campaign, and the city did not fall until September 2, 1864, after a Union siege and various attempts to seize railroads and supply lines leading to Atlanta. After taking the city, Sherman&#x27;s troops headed south-southeastward toward Milledgeville, the state capital, and on to Savannah with the March to the Sea.

The fall of Atlanta was especially noteworthy for its political ramifications. In the 1864 election, former Union General George B. McClellan, a Democrat, ran against President Lincoln, although he repudiated his own party&#x27;s platform, calling for an armistice with the Confederacy. The capture of Atlanta and Hood&#x27;s burning of military facilities as he evacuated were extensively covered by Northern newspapers, significantly boosting Northern morale, and Lincoln was re-elected by a significant margin.

==Background==
===Objectives and preparations ===

War weariness was growing in the North and President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s prospects for re-election were diminishing as a result, when on March 9, 1864, Lincoln commissioned Ulysses S. Grant as the only Union Army lieutenant general, then the highest grade in the United States Army. On March 10, Lincoln gave Grant command of all the armies of the United States. On March 12, Grant&#x27;s appointment as general-in-chief was publicly announced. Major General William T. Sherman was assigned to command the Military Division of the Mississippi, including the Department of the Ohio, Department of the Cumberland, Department of the Tennessee and the Department of Arkansas. Sherman took command on March 18. The assignment made Sherman commander of the Union armies in the Western theater of the war.

Grant devised a strategy for Union victory through simultaneous campaigns against several Confederate armies. Grant wanted to prevent Confederate armies from reinforcing each other in turn and to fatally weaken the entire Confederate Army. Sherman would lead one of two key campaigns. The objective of Sherman&#x27;s campaign was to defeat and disperse the Confederate Army of Tennessee under the command of General Joseph E. Johnston, to capture the vital railway center of Atlanta, Georgia, to destroy or damage Confederate war resources as much as possible and to split the Confederacy again as had been done at Vicksburg, Mississippi, and Port Hudson, Louisiana, in July 1863.

On May 4, 1864, Sherman was ready to move his armies from Chattanooga, Tennessee, toward Ringgold, Georgia, with an estimated strength of 112,000 troops. Johnston had between 60,000 and 70,000 effective troops. Johnston had taken advantage of the terrain of woods, hills and rivers in northern Georgia by entrenching his army at Dalton, Georgia, about one-quarter of the way between Chattanooga and Atlanta. Historian Allan Nevins wrote that Sherman&#x27;s numerical advantage did not make Johnston&#x27;s position hopeless in view of his fortified line of defenses in the rough, confusing, mountainous, wooded country of northwestern Georgia which had poor roads and three difficult rivers to cross. Because Sherman had to keep his Western and Atlantic Railroad supply line open, he could break away from it only for short periods of time.

=== Prelude ===

During the months leading up to the battle, Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston had repeatedly retreated from Sherman&#x27;s superior force. All along the Western and Atlantic Railroad line, from Chattanooga, Tennessee, to Marietta, Georgia, a pattern was played and replayed: Johnston took up a defensive position, Sherman marched to outflank the Confederate defenses, and Johnston retreated again. After Johnston&#x27;s withdrawal following the Battle of Resaca, the two armies clashed again at the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain, but the Confederate senior leadership in Richmond was unhappy with Johnston&#x27;s perceived reluctance to fight the Union army, even though he had little chance of winning. Thus, on July 17, as he was preparing for the Battle of Peachtree Creek, Johnston was relieved of his command and replaced by Lieutenant General John Bell Hood. The dismissal and replacement of Johnston remains one of the most controversial decisions of the Civil War. Hood, who was fond of taking risks, lashed out at Sherman&#x27;s army at Peachtree Creek, but the attack failed, with more than 2500 Confederate casualties.

Hood needed to defend the city of Atlanta, which was an important rail hub and industrial center for the Confederacy, but his army was small in comparison to the armies that Sherman commanded. He decided to withdraw, classically threatening Sherman&#x27;s supply lines in his army&#x27;s rear. Hood hoped his aggressiveness and the size of his still formidable force on-the-move would entice the Union troops to come forward against him, if only to protect their rear supply lines. The Union did not do so. McPherson&#x27;s army closed in upon Decatur, Georgia, to the east side of Atlanta.

==Opposing forces==

Sherman&#x27;s forces in the Atlanta campaign included three armies: the Army of the Tennessee under Major General James B. McPherson (until he was killed at the Battle of Atlanta); the Army of the Cumberland under Major General George H. Thomas and the small Army of the Ohio (including only the XXIII Corps and a few small units) under Major General John M. Schofield. After McPherson&#x27;s death, the Army of the Tennessee was commanded at the Battle of Atlanta by Major General John A. Logan The Army of the Tennessee comprised the XV Corps initially under the command of Logan, then under the command of Brigadier General Morgan L. Smith; the XVI Corps under the command of Major General Grenville M. Dodge, and the XVII Corps under the command of Major General Frank P. Blair Jr.

The Confederate Army of Tennessee was commanded by General Joseph E. Johnston until July 17, 1864, when he was replaced by Lieutenant General John Bell Hood. At the start of the campaign, the Army of Tennessee comprised three infantry corps under the command Lieutenant Generals William J. Hardee, Leonidas Polk and John Bell Hood, and a cavalry corps under Major General Joseph Wheeler. After Polk was killed on June 14, he was replaced in corps command by Major General William Wing Loring temporarily and on July 7 by Lieutenant General Alexander P. Stewart.

Many, but not all, of the units of both armies fought in the Battle of Atlanta and related action at Decatur on July 22, 1864.

==Battle==
Hood ordered Lieutenant General William J. Hardee&#x27;s corps on a march around the Union left flank, had Major General Joseph Wheeler&#x27;s cavalry march near Sherman&#x27;s supply line, and had Major General Benjamin Cheatham&#x27;s corps attack the Union front. However, it took longer than expected for Hardee to get his men into position. Confederate Major General William H. T. Walker was killed—shot from his horse by a Union sharpshooter as he scouted the front to prepare his forces for the beginning of the battle. During the time that Hardee&#x27;s corps was deploying for an attack, McPherson had correctly deduced a possible threat to his left flank. He sent XVI Corps, his reserve, to help strengthen the position. Hardee&#x27;s men met this other force, and the battle began. About this time, McPherson rode to the front with two aides to determine the situation and redeploy some regiments as gunfire continued to build to the south of his line. While on this reconnaissance, McPherson was shot and killed by Confederate infantry unexpectedly moving forward. When the Confederates called on him to halt, he turned his horse and tried to escape after refusing a demand to surrender.

Although the initial Confederate attack was repulsed, the Union left flank began to retreat under heavy pressure. Initially, Hardee&#x27;s column took the Flat Shoals Road toward McPherson&#x27;s position. Union troops under Brigadier General Mortimer D. Leggett, commanding the 3rd Division of the XVII Corps moved back from the road and swung to a more east- west position to fill a gap between Blair&#x27;s corp and Dodge&#x27;s corp and defend Bald Hill. The main lines of battle now formed an &quot;L&quot; shape, with Hardee&#x27;s attack forming the lower part of the &quot;L,&quot; and Cheatham&#x27;s attack on the Union front as the vertical member of the &quot;L&quot;. Hood intended to attack the Union troops from both east and west. The fighting centered on a hill east of the city known as Bald Hill. The Federals had arrived two days earlier, and began to shell the city proper, killing several civilians. A savage struggle, sometimes hand-to-hand, developed around the hill, lasting until just after dark. The Federals held the hill while the Confederates retired to a point just south of there.

Meanwhile, two miles to the north, Cheatham&#x27;s troops had broken through the Union lines at the Georgia railroad. In response, twenty artillery pieces were positioned on a small knoll near Sherman&#x27;s headquarters and shelled the Confederates, while Logan&#x27;s XV Corps regrouped and repulsed the Southern troops.

In a separate action near Decatur, Colonel John W. Sprague, in command of the 2nd Brigade, 4th Division of the XVI Corps, was attacked by Wheeler&#x27;s cavalry. Wheeler had taken the Fayetteville Road and moved into the town of Decatur. Union troops fell back from the town while successfully protecting the ordnance and supply trains of the XV, XVI, XVII, and XX corps. Sprague received some reinforcements but Wheeler withdrew due to being recalled by Hardee three times in quick succession at about 5:00 p.m. to help in Hardee&#x27;s attack on Bald Hill. Sprague was later awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions.

The Union had suffered over 3,700 casualties, including Major General McPherson, while the Confederate casualties numbered about 5,500. This was a heavy loss for the already reduced Confederate Army, but they still held the city.

==Aftermath==

Sherman settled into a siege of Atlanta, shelling the city and sending raids west and south of the city to cut off the supply lines from Macon, Georgia. Both of Sherman&#x27;s cavalry raids including McCook&#x27;s raid and Stoneman&#x27;s Raid 
were defeated by Confederate cavalry collectively under General Wheeler. Although the raids partially achieved their objective of cutting railroad tracks and destroying supply wagons, they were soon after repaired and supplies continued to move to the city of Atlanta. Following the failure to break the Confederates&#x27; hold on the city, Sherman began to employ a new strategy. He swung his entire army in a broad flanking maneuver to the west. Finally, on August 31, at Jonesborough, Georgia, Sherman&#x27;s army captured the railroad track from Macon, pushing the Confederates to Lovejoy&#x27;s Station. With his supply lines fully severed, Hood pulled his troops out of Atlanta the next day, September 1, destroying supply depots as he left to prevent them from falling into Union hands. He also set fire to eighty-one loaded ammunition cars, which led to a conflagration watched by hundreds.

On September 2, Mayor James Calhoun, along with a committee of Union-leaning citizens including William Markham, Jonathan Norcross, and Edward Rawson, met a captain on the staff of Major General Henry W. Slocum, and surrendered the city, asking for &quot;protection to non-combatants and private property&quot;. Sherman, who was in Jonesboro at the time of surrender, sent a telegram to Washington on September 3, reading, &quot;Atlanta is ours, and fairly won&quot;.

Within a week of the fall of Atlanta, Sherman had ordered all non-military personnel out of Atlanta. Reportedly he remembered the cities of Memphis and Vicksburg which became a burden immediately after victory, so he told the civilians specifically to go north or go south. A truce of sorts was quickly established at a town nearby called Rough And Ready with General Hood, where Union and Confederate prisoners were in small numbers exchanged and civilians wishing to go south could get help to that end. After the battle, Sherman established his headquarters in Atlanta on September 7. He stayed until November 15 when the Army of the Tennessee, then commanded by Major General Oliver O. Howard and consisting of two corps and the newly formed Army of Georgia, commanded by Major General Henry W. Slocum, also with two corps, departed for Savannah on the campaign known as &quot;Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea&quot;.

Despite the damage caused by the war, Atlanta recovered from its downfall relatively quickly; as one observer noted as early as November 1865, &quot;A new city is springing up with marvelous rapidity&quot;.

==Political ramifications==
The fall of Atlanta and the success of the overall Atlanta Campaign were extensively covered by Northern newspapers, and were a boon to Northern morale and to President Lincoln&#x27;s political standing. In the 1864 election, Democratic challenger George B. McClellan ran against Lincoln. McClellan ran a conflicted campaign: McClellan was a Unionist who advocated continuing the war until the defeat of the Confederacy, but the Democratic platform included calls for negotiations with the Confederacy on the subject of a potential truce. The capture of Atlanta and Hood&#x27;s burning of military facilities as he evacuated showed that a successful conclusion of the war was in sight, weakening support for a truce. As a result, Lincoln was re-elected by a wide margin, with 212 out of 233 electoral votes.

==Legacy==
In 1880, Atlanta ranked among the fifty largest cities in the United States. The battlefield is now urban, residential, and commercial land, with many markers memorializing notable events of the battle, including McPherson&#x27;s place of death. The marker was erected in 1956 by the Georgia Historical Commission. To commemorate the 140th anniversary of the battle, in 2004, two new markers were erected in the Inman Park neighborhood. The Atlanta Cyclorama building, built in 1921 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is located in Grant Park and formerly contained a panoramic painting of the battle. In 2014, the City of Atlanta sold the Battle of Atlanta Cyclorama to Atlanta History Center. Atlanta History Center constructed new, purpose-built building at their Buckhead Campus to house the art piece. The painting itself underwent an extensive restoration to reverse changes made to the original painting in the 1890s. The Cyclorama and accompanying exhibition (Cyclorama: The Big Picture) opened at Atlanta History Center on February 22, 2019.

One notable establishment destroyed by Union soldiers was the Potter (or Ponder) House, built in 1857, and owned by Ephraim G. Ponder, a holder of 65 slaves before the war. In the battle, it was used by Confederate sharpshooters until Union artillery inflicted heavy damage. It was never rebuilt. One of Ponder&#x27;s slaves, Festus Flipper, was the father of Henry Ossian Flipper, who later became the first African American cadet to graduate from the United States Military Academy at West Point.

<doc id="176266" wikidata="Q7448027" url="?curid=176266" title="Electric unicycle">
<text>An electric unicycle (often initialized as EUC or acronymized yuke or Uni) is a self-balancing personal transporter with a single wheel. The rider controls speed by leaning forwards or backwards, and steers by twisting or tilting the unit side to side. The self-balancing mechanism uses accelerometers and gyroscopes. Most manufacturers of EUCs are based out of China, including Segway, Inmotion, Kingsong, Begode, and Leaperkim.

== Operation ==

Similar to hoverboards, Onewheels, and Segways, electric unicycles are self-balancing in a forward and backward direction, with side-to-side (lateral) stability being provided by human steering motions that tilt or twist the unit, similar to Bicycle and motorcycle dynamics. The control of a unicycle can be considered to be similar to an inverted pendulum. Many electric unicycles have suspension, either operated by air or springs.

Electric unicycles come in varying speeds, battery capacities, and motor wattages. Low-end models may have speeds up to 15 mph and ranges of 10–15 miles, while advanced models being introduced in 2024 can reach 60 mph and over 100 miles per charge.

== History ==
===Early experimentation===

A hand-power monowheel was patented in 1869 by Richard C. Hemming with a pedal-power unit patented in 1885. Various motorized monowheels were developed and demonstrated during the 1930s without commercial success and Charles F Taylor was granted a patent for a &quot;vehicle having a single supporting and driving wheel&quot; in 1964 after some 25 years of experimentation. In 1977 Charles Gabriel presented an electric unicycle that resembles the design of today&#x27;s devices.

===Commercialisation===
In 2003, Bombardier announced a conceptual design for such a device used as a sport vehicle, the Embrio. In September 2004 Trevor Blackwell demonstrated a functional self-balancing unicycle, using a control-mechanism similar to that used by the Segway PT and published the designs as the Eunicycle. This approach was further refined by a group of engineering students at the University of Adelaide who developed The Micycle, which incorporated a hub-motor, a Lithium-Ion Battery and a novel steering mechanism where the wheel pivoted independent of the main chassis.
Early units had a seat, which limited how much the unit could be tilted, but this was resolved with the transition to seatless units that could be tilted much more. In March 2010 Shane Chen of Inventist filed a patent application for a seatless electric unicycle (associated with the &quot;Solowheel&quot; product launched in February 2011), which uses flat pedals to stand on and leg contact surfaces to allow for stable, precise control in lieu of a seat. In Oct 2010 Focus Designs published a video of an electric unicycle with hub motor and a seat.
Late in 2015, the Ford Motor Company patented a &quot;self-propelled unicycle engageable with vehicle&quot;, intended for last-mile commuters. Segway launched their Ninebot One S1 model in November 2017.
By the turn of the decade, several Chinese manufacturers dominate the market and continue to release EUC models with higher top speeds (above 75 km/h or 46 mph), and longer range batteries.

Popularity came around the same time as Begode (formerly known as Gotway) released their M super line. This evolved into the MSX &amp; MSP models and eventually into the RS model. Around this time Veteran stepped on to the scene for the first time with their road wheel the Sherman. In 2020, suspension EUCs were revealed by Inmotion, Kingsong and Gotway. After suspension, companies began to work on higher speeds and motor voltages.

<text>Fraserburgh (; ), locally known as the Broch, is a town in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, with a population recorded in the 2011 Census as 13,100. It lies in Buchan in the northeastern corner of the county, about north of Aberdeen and north of Peterhead. It is the biggest shellfish port in Scotland and one of the largest in Europe, landing over in 2016. Fraserburgh is also a major port for white and pelagic fish.

==History==

===16th and 17th century: Origins===
The town takes its name from the Fraser family, who bought the lands of Philorth in 1504 and brought about major improvements in the area over the next century.

By 1570, the Fraser family had built Fraserburgh Castle at Kinnaird Head and within a year a church was built for the area. Sir Alexander Fraser built a port in the town in 1579, obtained a charter establishing it as a burgh of barony in 1588 and secured the right to change the name from Faithlie to Fraserburgh in 1592.

A grant from the Parliament of Scotland in 1595 allowed Sir Alexander Fraser to erect the town&#x27;s first college building, and in 1597 the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland recommended the Rev. Charles Ferme, then minister at the Old Parish, to be its first and only principal.

In 1601, Fraserburgh became a burgh of regality. The college, however, closed only a decade or so after Ferme&#x27;s arrest on the orders of James VI for taking part in the 1605 General Assembly of Aberdeen, being used again only for a short time in 1647 when King&#x27;s College, Aberdeen temporarily relocated owing to an outbreak of plague. A plaque commemorating the university&#x27;s existence may be seen at the Fraserburgh Heritage Centre.

===18th and 19th century: further growth and development===
During the 18th and 19th centuries the population of Fraserburgh was growing with peaks due to seasonal employment. From a population of an estimated 1682 in 1755, a population of about 2,000 was recorded in 1780, of whom 1,000 resided in the town proper. There were a further 200 people in the village of Broadsea.

In 1787, Fraserburgh Castle was converted to Kinnaird Head Lighthouse, Scotland&#x27;s first mainland lighthouse and the first in Scotland to be lit by the Commissioners of Northern Lights.

In the 1790s, Rev. Alexander Simpson of the Fraserburgh Old Parish Church described the harbour as &quot;small but good&quot;, writing that it had the capability to take vessels with &quot;200 tons burden&quot;. The Reverend noted that shipbuilding had become the main industry in the town, especially after 1784, and that the locals were making donations and seeking government assistance to have the harbour enlarged.

In 1803, the original 1571 church building was replaced and enlarged, to a design by Alexander Morrice, to seat 1,000 people. The Auld Kirk was to be the standing authority in the town up until the 1840s. This period also saw the extension of the harbour, with a northern pier of being built between 1807–1812 and, in 1818, a southern pier being built following an Act of Parliament.

Fraserburgh&#x27;s population boomed in the early 19th century, from 2271 in 1811 to 2954 by 1831. This was primarily put down to the growth in herring fishing, which intensified in 1815. The herring season also brought with it an additional 1,200 people working in the Parish. Contemporary accounts mention the increase in general wealth brought by this increased trade spurring a change in &quot;dress and diet&quot; as well as a &quot;considerable&quot; amount of new houses being built in the town.

No less than £30,000 was spent developing the harbour between 1807 and 1840 by which time the harbour held eight vessels of and 220 boats of the herring fishery.

Fraserburgh Town House, which was designed by Thomas Mackenzie of Matthews and MacKenzie, was completed in 1855.

===Lifeboat service===

The town has had a local lifeboat on service since 1806 which was run privately by the local Harbour Board until the first RNLI operated station opened in 1858. This was the first official RNLI station opened in Scotland.

Throughout the 20th century, Fraserburgh suffered three lifeboat disasters. First, in 1919, the &#x27;Lady Rothes&#x27; capsized while assisting HM drifter &quot;Eminent&quot;. Coxswain Andrew Noble and Acting Second Coxswain Andrew Faquhar drowned. Second, on 9 February 1953, six crew members lost their lives when the lifeboat capsized while escorting fishing vessels to the harbour. On this occasion Coxswain Andrew Ritchie, Mechanic George Duthie, Bowman Charles Tait, Assistant Mechanic James Noble and Crew Members John Crawford and John Buchan all lost their lives - the only survivor was Charles Tait. Lastly, on 21 January 1970 while on service to the Danish fishing vessel &quot;Opal&quot;, the lifeboat &quot;The Duchess of Kent&quot; capsized with the loss of five of her crew of six. Those killed were Coxswain John Stephen, Mechanic Frederick Kirkness and crew members William Hadden, James R.S. Buchan and James Buchan.
In 2009, a local campaign was started to raise £40,000 to erect an official monument to the 14 men who lost their lives whilst serving on the Fraserburgh Lifeboat. The target was successfully achieved and the monument unveiled by Flora Fraser, 21st Lady Saltoun in August 2010.

===Railways===
Fraserburgh railway station opened in 1865 and closed to passengers in 1965. The railway line was built by the Formartine and Buchan Railway Company, which became part of the Great North of Scotland Railway. Trains operated to Aberdeen via Maud and Dyce, as well as a short branch line to St Combs via Cairnbulg.

In 1923, the GNSR was incorporated into the London and North Eastern Railway, which was in turn nationalised on 1 January 1948. Passenger services on the Buchan lines were withdrawn in 1965 as part of the Beeching cuts, although freight trains continued to operate Fraserburgh until 1979. The track was subsequently lifted.

Following the opening of the Borders Railway in September 2015, Fraserburgh became the most distant town in UK from the rail network, leading to calls for the lifted track to be reinstated. The nearest operating station is currently Inverurie, away.

==Climate==
Fraserburgh has a marine climate heavily influenced by its proximity to the sea. As such, summer highs and winter lows are heavily moderated, with mild winter temperatures for a location so far north.

There is approximately of precipitation per annum.

Fraserburgh is also notable for having the highest ever recorded wind speed in the UK at a low altitude. The gust was recorded on 13 February 1989 at Kinnaird Head Lighthouse. The corresponding hourly mean speed was .

==Demographics==
The 2011 census recorded 13,180 residents making Fraserburgh the third largest settlement in Aberdeenshire after Peterhead and Inverurie. Since the accession of Poland and other eastern European countries to the European Union in 2004, there has been an influx of EU citizens to the town, with 5% of residents now speaking Polish as their first language, and a further 6% speaking other languages.

Some 10% of residents stated the Scots language to be their primary language used at home, whilst 63.1% reported being able to speak it.

<text>Microsoft Outlook is a personal information manager software system from Microsoft, available as a part of the Microsoft 365 software suites. Primarily popular as an email client for businesses, Outlook also includes functions such as calendaring, task managing, contact managing, note-taking, journal logging, web browsing, and RSS news aggregation.

Individuals can use Outlook as a stand-alone application; organizations can deploy it as multi-user software (through Microsoft Exchange Server or SharePoint) for shared functions such as mailboxes, calendars, folders, data aggregation (i.e., SharePoint lists), and as appointment scheduling apps.

Other than the paid software on Windows and Mac desktops that this article talks about, the Outlook name also covers several other current software:

* Outlook on the web, formerly &quot;Outlook Web App&quot;, a web version of Microsoft Outlook, included in Microsoft 365, Exchange Server, and Exchange Online 
* Outlook for Windows, a new, free Outlook application that is preloaded with Windows 11 from 2024
* Outlook Mobile, a mobile app version of Outlook
* Outlook.com, formerly &quot;Hotmail&quot;, a free personal email service offered by Microsoft alongside a webmail client 

== Versions ==
Outlook has replaced Microsoft&#x27;s previous scheduling and email clients, Schedule+ and Exchange Client.

&quot;Outlook 98&quot; and &quot;Outlook 2000&quot; offer two configurations:
*Internet Mail Only (aka IMO mode): A lighter application mode with specific emphasis on POP3 and IMAP accounts, including a lightweight Fax application.
*Corporate Work group (aka CW mode): A full MAPI client with specific emphasis on Microsoft Exchange accounts.

Perpetual versions of Microsoft Outlook include:

=== Microsoft Outlook ===

Microsoft Outlook is an email and personal information manager software primarily used in professional settings. As part of the Microsoft Office suite, it offers email management, contact storage, calendar scheduling, and task tracking. Outlook can function independently or as part of a larger Microsoft ecosystem, including integration with SharePoint for file sharing. While it stores email data locally for offline access, newer versions restrict link opening to Microsoft&#x27;s own browsers.

Privacy is severely degraded in latest versions, as new Outlook sends passwords, mails and other data to Microsoft.

=== Macintosh ===

Microsoft made several versions of Outlook for older Mac computers, but only for email accounts on specific company servers (Exchange). It wasn&#x27;t part of the regular Microsoft Office package for Mac.

Microsoft Entourage was Microsoft&#x27;s email app for Mac. It was similar to Outlook but didn&#x27;t work well with Exchange email at first. Over time, it got better at handling Exchange, but it was always a different program than Outlook.
Entourage was replaced by Outlook for Mac 2011, which features greater compatibility and parity with Outlook for Windows than Entourage offered. It is the first native version of Outlook for MacOS.

Outlook 2011 initially supported Mac OS X&#x27;s Sync Services only for contacts, not events, tasks or notes. It also does not have a Project Manager equivalent to that in Entourage. With Service Pack 1 (v 14.1.0), published on April 12, 2011, Outlook can now sync calendar, notes and tasks with Exchange 2007 and Exchange 2010.

On October 31, 2014, Microsoft released Outlook for Mac (v15.3 build 141024) with Office 365 (a software as a service licensing program that makes Office programs available as soon as they are developed). Outlook for Mac 15.3 improves upon its predecessors with:
* Better performance and reliability as a result of a new threading model and database improvements.
* A new modern user interface with improved scrolling and agility when switching between Ribbon tabs.
* Online archive support for searching Exchange (online or on-premises) archived mail.
* Master Category List support and enhancements delivering access to category lists (name and color) and sync between Mac, Microsoft Windows and OWA clients.
* Office 365 push email support for real-time email delivery.
* Faster first-run and email download experience with improved Exchange Web Services syncing.
The &quot;New Outlook for Mac&quot; client, included with version 16.42 and above, became available for &quot;Early Insider&quot; testers in the fall of 2019, with a public &quot;Insider&quot; debut in October 2020. It requires macOS 10.14 or greater and introduces a redesigned interface with significantly changed internals, including native search within the client that no longer depends on macOS Spotlight. Some Outlook features are still missing from the New Outlook client as it continues in development.

To date, the Macintosh client has never had the capability of syncing Contact Groups/Personal Distribution Lists from Exchange, Microsoft 365 or Outlook.com accounts, something that the Windows and web clients have always supported. A UserVoice post created in December 2019 suggesting that the missing functionality be added has shown a &quot;Planned&quot; tag since October 2020.

In March 2023, Microsoft announced that Outlook for Mac will be available for free. This means that users no longer need a Microsoft 365 subscription or an Office licence to use the program.

=== Phones and tablets ===
First released in April 2014 by the venture capital-backed startup Acompli, the company was acquired by Microsoft in December 2014. On January 29, 2015, Acompli was re-branded as Outlook Mobile—sharing its name with the Microsoft Outlook desktop personal information manager and Outlook.com email service. In January 2015, Microsoft released Outlook for phones and for tablets (v1.3 build) with Office 365. This was the first Outlook for these platforms with email, calendar, and contacts.

On February 4, 2015, Microsoft acquired Sunrise Calendar; on September 13, 2016, Sunrise ceased to operate, and an update was released to Outlook Mobile that contained enhancements to its calendar functions.

Similar to its desktop counterpart, Outlook mobile offers an aggregation of attachments and files stored on cloud storage platforms; a &quot;focused inbox&quot; highlights messages from frequent contacts, and calendar events, files, and locations can be embedded in messages without switching apps. The app supports a number of email platforms and services, including Outlook.com, Microsoft Exchange and Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) among others.

Outlook mobile is designed to consolidate functionality that would normally be found in separate apps on mobile devices, similar to personal information managers on personal computers. It is designed around four &quot;hubs&quot; for different tasks, including &quot;Mail&quot;, &quot;Calendar,&quot; &quot;Files&quot; and &quot;People&quot;. The &quot;People&quot; hub lists frequently and recently used contacts and aggregates recent communications with them, and the &quot;Files&quot; hub aggregates recent attachments from messages, and can also integrate with other online storage services such as Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive. To facilitate indexing of content for search and other features, emails and other information are stored on external servers.

Outlook mobile supports a large number of different e-mail services and platforms, including Exchange, iCloud, Gmail, Google Workspace (formerly G Suite), Outlook.com, and Yahoo! Mail. The app supports multiple email accounts at once.

Emails are divided into two inboxes: the &quot;Focused&quot; inbox displays messages of high importance, and those from frequent contacts. All other messages are displayed within an &quot;Other&quot; section. Files, locations, and calendar events can be embedded into email messages. Swiping gestures can be used for deleting messages.

Like the desktop Outlook, Outlook mobile allows users to see appointment details, respond to Exchange meeting invites, and schedule meetings. It also incorporates the three-day view and &quot;Interesting Calendars&quot; features from Sunrise.

Files in the Files tab are not stored offline; they require Internet access to view.

==== Security ====

Outlook mobile temporarily stores and indexes user data (including email, attachments, calendar information, and contacts), along with login credentials, in a &quot;secure&quot; form on Microsoft Azure servers located in the United States. On Exchange accounts, these servers identify as a single Exchange ActiveSync user in order to fetch e-mail. Additionally, the app does not support mobile device management, nor allows administrators to control how third-party cloud storage services are used with the app to interact with their users. Concerns surrounding these security issues have prompted some firms, including the European Parliament, to block the app on their Exchange servers. Microsoft maintains a separate, pre-existing Outlook Web Access app for Android and iOS.

==== Outlook Groups ====
Outlook Groups was a mobile application for Windows Phone, Windows 10 Mobile, Android and iOS that could be used with an Office 365 domain Microsoft Account, e.g. a work or school account. It is designed to take existing email threads and turn them into a group-style conversation. The app lets users create groups, mention their contacts, share Office documents via OneDrive and work on them together, and participate in an email conversation. The app also allows the finding and joining of other Outlook Groups. It was tested internally at Microsoft and launched September 18, 2015, for Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows 10 Mobile users.

After its initial launch on Microsoft&#x27;s own platforms they launched the application for Android and iOS on September 23, 2015.

Outlook Groups was updated on September 30, 2015, that introduced a deep linking feature as well as fixing a bug that blocked the &quot;send&quot; button from working. In March 2016 Microsoft added the ability to attach multiple images, and the most recently used document to group messages as well as the option to delete conversations within the application programme.

Outlook Groups was retired by Microsoft on May 1, 2018. The functionality was replaced by adding the &quot;Groups node&quot; to the folder list within the Outlook mobile app.

== Internet standards compliance ==

=== HTML rendering ===
Outlook 2007 was the first Outlook to switch from Internet Explorer rendering engine to Microsoft Word 2007&#x27;s. This meant that HTML and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) items not handled by Word were no longer supported. On the other hand, HTML messages composed in Word look as they appeared to the author. This affects publishing newsletters and reports, because they frequently use intricate HTML and CSS to form their layout. For example, forms can no longer be embedded in an Outlook email.

=== Support of CSS properties and HTML attributes ===
Outlook for Windows has very limited CSS support compared to various other e-mail clients. Neither CSS1 (1996) nor CSS2 (1998) specifications are fully implemented and many CSS properties can only to be used with certain HTML elements for the desired effect. Some HTML attributes help achieve proper rendering of e-mails in Outlook, but most of these attributes are already deprecated in the HTML 4.0 specifications (1997). In order to achieve the best compatibility with Outlook, most HTML e-mails are created using multiple boxed tables, as the table element and its sub-elements support the width and height property in Outlook. No improvements have been made towards a more standards-compliant email client since the release of Outlook 2007.

=== Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format ===

Outlook and Exchange Server internally handle messages, appointments, and items as objects in a data model which is derived from the old proprietary Microsoft Mail system, the Rich Text Format from Microsoft Word and the complex OLE general data model. When these programs interface with other protocols such as the various Internet and X.400 protocols, they try to map this internal model onto those protocols in a way that can be reversed if the ultimate recipient is also running Outlook or Exchange.

This focus on the possibility that emails and other items will ultimately be converted back to Microsoft Mail format is so extreme that if Outlook/Exchange cannot figure out a way to encode the complete data in the standard format, it simply encodes the entire message/item in a proprietary binary format called Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format (TNEF) and sends this as an attached file (usually named &quot;winmail.dat&quot;) to an otherwise incomplete rendering of the mail/item. If the recipient is Outlook/Exchange it can simply discard the incomplete outer message and use the encapsulated data directly, but if the recipient is any other program, the message received will be incomplete because the data in the TNEF attachment will be of little use without the Microsoft software for which it was created. As a workaround, numerous tools for partially decoding TNEF files exist.

=== Calendar compatibility ===
Outlook does not fully support data and syncing specifications for calendaring and contacts, such as iCalendar, CalDAV, SyncML, and vCard 3.0. Outlook 2007 claims to be fully iCalendar compliant; however, it does not support all core objects, such as VTODO or VJOURNAL. Also, Outlook supports vCard 2.1 and does not support multiple contacts in the vCard format as a single file. Outlook has also been criticized for having proprietary &quot;Outlook extensions&quot; to these Internet standards.

=== .msg format ===

Outlook (both the web version and recent non-web versions) promotes the usage of a proprietary codice_1 format to save individual emails, instead of the standard .eml format. Messages use by default when saved to disk or forwarded as attachments. Compatibility with past or future Outlook versions is not documented nor guaranteed; the format saw over 10 versions released since version 1 in 2008.

The standard format replicates the format of emails as used for transmission and is therefore compatible with any email client which uses the normal protocols. Standard-compliant email clients, like Mozilla Thunderbird, use additional headers to store software-specific information related e.g. to the local storage of the email, while keeping the file plain-text, so that it can be read in any text editor and searched or indexed like any document by any other software.

== Security concerns ==
As part of its Trustworthy Computing initiative, Microsoft took corrective steps to fix Outlook&#x27;s reputation in Office Outlook 2003. Among the most publicized security features are that Office Outlook 2003 does not automatically load images in HTML emails or permit opening executable attachments by default, and includes a built-in Junk Mail filter. Service Pack 2 has augmented these features and adds an anti-phishing filter.

== Outlook add-ins ==
Outlook add-ins are small additional programs for the Microsoft Outlook application, mainly purposed to add new functional capabilities into Outlook and automate various routine operations. The term also refers to programs where the main function is to work on Outlook files, such as synchronization or backup utilities. Outlook add-ins may be developed in Microsoft Visual Studio or third-party tools such as Add-in Express. Outlook add-ins are not supported in Outlook Web App.

From Outlook 97 on, Exchange Client Extensions are supported in Outlook. Outlook 2000 and later support specific COM components called Outlook Add-Ins. The exact supported features (such as .NET components) for later generations were extended with each release.

=== SalesforceIQ Inbox for Outlook ===
In March 2016, Salesforce announced that its relationship intelligence platform, SalesforceIQ, would be able to seamlessly integrate with Outlook. SalesforceIQ works from inside the Outlook inbox providing data from CRM, email, and customer social profiles. It also provides recommendations within the inbox on various aspects like appointment scheduling, contacts, responses, etc.

=== Hotmail Connector ===

&quot;Microsoft Outlook Hotmail Connector&quot; (formerly &quot;Microsoft Office Outlook Connector&quot;), is a discontinued and defunct free add-in for Microsoft Outlook 2003, 2007 and 2010, intended to integrate Outlook.com (formerly Hotmail) into Microsoft Outlook. It uses DeltaSync, a proprietary Microsoft communications protocol that was formerly used by Hotmail.

In version 12, access to tasks and notes and online synchronization with MSN Calendar is only available to MSN subscribers of paid premium accounts. Version 12.1, released in December 2008 as an optional upgrade, uses Windows Live Calendar instead of the former MSN Calendar. This meant that calendar features became free for all users, except for task synchronization which became unavailable. In April 2008, version 12.1 became a required upgrade to continue using the service as part of a migration from MSN Calendar to Windows Live Calendar.

Microsoft Outlook 2013 and its newer versions have intrinsic support for accessing Outlook.com and its calendar over the Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) protocol, while older versions of Microsoft Outlook can read and synchronize Outlook.com emails over the IMAP protocol.

=== Social Connector ===
&quot;Outlook Social Connector&quot; was a free add-in for Microsoft Outlook 2003 and 2007 by Microsoft that allowed integration of social networks such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Windows Live Messenger into Microsoft Outlook. It was first introduced on November 18, 2009. Starting with Microsoft Office 2010, Outlook Social Connector is an integral part of Outlook.

=== CardDAV and CalDAV Connector ===
Since Microsoft Outlook does not support CalDAV and CardDAV protocol along the way, various third-party software vendors developed Outlook add-ins to enable users synchronizing with CalDAV and CardDAV servers. CalConnect has a list of software that enable users to synchronize their calendars with CalDAV servers/contacts with CardDAV servers.

== Importing from other email clients ==
Traditionally, Outlook supported importing messages from Outlook Express and Lotus Notes. In addition, Microsoft Outlook supports POP3 and IMAP protocols, enabling users to import emails from servers that support these protocols. Microsoft Hotmail Connector add-in (described above) helps importing emails from Hotmail accounts. Outlook 2013 later integrated the functionality of this add-in and added the ability to import email (as well as a calendar) through Exchange ActiveSync protocol.

There are some ways to get the emails from Thunderbird; the first is to use a tool that can convert a Thunderbird folder to a format that can be imported from Outlook Express. This method must be processed folder by folder. The other method is to use some free tools that keep the original folder structure. If Exchange is available, an easier method is to connect the old mail client (Thunderbird) to Exchange using IMAP, and upload the original mail from the client to the Exchange account.

== New Outlook for Windows ==

In May 2022, Microsoft announced a preview release of new Outlook for Windows, available initially to Office Insiders. The new version of Outlook is a progressive web app based on Outlook.com and offers several new features.

The new Outlook for Windows preview later became available to all existing Outlook for Windows users and also users of the free Mail and Calendar app, which was retired in favor of the new app on December 31, 2024.

The new Outlook has been criticized for having worse performance compared to the previous native versions as well as lack of offline support and missing a unified inbox. Privacy concerns have also been raised around the decision to synchronise non-Microsoft email accounts with the Microsoft cloud, rather than downloading emails to the local device as previous versions have done.

<text>Outlook Express, formerly known as Microsoft Internet Mail and News, is a discontinued email and news client included with Internet Explorer versions 3.0 through 6.0. As such, it was bundled with several versions of Microsoft Windows, from Windows 98 to Windows Server 2003, and was available for Windows 3.x, Windows NT 3.51, Windows 95, Mac System 7, Mac OS 8, and Mac OS 9. In Windows Vista, Outlook Express was superseded by Windows Mail.

Outlook Express is a different application from Microsoft Outlook. The two programs do not share a common codebase, but they do share a common architectural philosophy. The similar names lead many people to conclude incorrectly that Outlook Express is a stripped-down version of Microsoft Outlook. Outlook Express uses the Windows Address Book to store contact information and integrates tightly with it.

==History==

Version 1.0 was released as &quot;Microsoft Internet Mail and News&quot; in 1996 following the Internet Explorer 3 release. This add-on precedes the &quot;Internet Mail&quot; profile for Microsoft Exchange 4.0 bundled in Windows 95. Version 2.0 was released at the end of 1996. Internet Mail and News handled only plain text and rich text (RTF) email, lacking HTML email.

In 1997 the program was changed and renamed to &quot;Outlook Express&quot; and bundled with Internet Explorer 4. The Windows executable file for Outlook Express, &quot;msimn.exe&quot;, is a holdover from the Internet Mail and News era. Like Internet Explorer, Outlook Express 4 can run on Mac System 7, OS 8, and OS 9.

Internet Explorer 5 required Outlook Express 5 to save Web Archive files (see MHTML).

Outlook Express 6 is the last version of the software with Outlook branding. It has a similar layout to Outlook Express 5. It was included with Windows XP.

== Supported file formats ==

* .DBX - Outlook Express Email Folder
*.EMAIL - Outlook Express Email Message
* .EML - E-Mail Message
* .IDX - Outlook Express Mailbox Index File
* .MBX - Outlook Express Mailbox
* .MIM - Multi-Purpose Internet Mail Message File
* .MIME - Multi-Purpose Internet Mail Extension
* .MS-TNEF - MS Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format
* .NCH - Outlook Express Folder File
* .ODS - Outlook Express 5 Mailbox (not to be confused with OpenDocument spreadsheet file)
* .OEB - Outlook Express Backup Wizard File
* .PAB - Personal Address Book
* .PST - Outlook Personal Information Store File
* .SIG - Signature File
* .VCF - vCard File
* .WAB - Windows Address Book

== Versions for Windows ==

* Microsoft Internet Mail and News 1.0 was released in 1996 with Internet Explorer 3.
* Microsoft Internet Mail and News 2.0 was released later in 1996.
* Outlook Express 4.0, which was included in Windows 98 (June 1998) and integrated with Internet Explorer 4, stored messages in *.mbx files (similar to the Mbox format used in Unix-based systems).
* Outlook Express 5.0, which was included in Windows 98 Second Edition (SE) (June 1999) and integrated with Internet Explorer 5, switched to *.dbx files, with a separate file for each mailbox folder.
* Outlook Express 5.01 was included in Windows 2000 (February 2000) and integrated with Internet Explorer 5.01.
* Outlook Express 5.5 was included in Windows Me (June 2000) and integrated with Internet Explorer 5.5.
* Outlook Express 6.0 was included in Windows XP (October 2001) and integrated with Internet Explorer 6.

==Versions for Mac==

* Outlook Express 4.0 was included in Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition.
* Outlook Express 5.01 was integrated with Internet Explorer 5.
* Outlook Express 5.01 was bundled with Internet Explorer 5.01.
* Outlook Express 5.5 was bundled with Internet Explorer 5.5.

==Replacements==

Builds of &quot;Outlook Express 7&quot; appeared in early builds of Windows Vista when in development as &quot;Longhorn&quot;. It relied on WinFS for the management and storage of contacts and other data.

The final version of Vista included a successor to Outlook Express known as Windows Mail (Vista).

==Criticism==

===Email standards===
Beginning with the text-based Unix Mail command, email traditionally used the inline or bottom posting styles when replying to messages. Outlook Express, as well as Lotus Notes and Microsoft Outlook, top-post (show replies newest to oldest) by default.

Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Exchange use a proprietary email attachment format called Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format (TNEF) to handle formatting and other features specific to Outlook such as meeting requests. Outlook Express and other email clients are unable to read this format. This can be confusing to Outlook Express users (as well as those who use other email clients) who receive attachments sent from Outlook.

===Database corruption===
Outlook Express has been prone to a number of problems which can corrupt its files database, especially when the database increases in size due to an increasing number of stored emails and during database compaction. This has led to a thriving market for software that can back up, restore and recover corrupted files. An open-source project called UnDBX was also created, which seems to be successful in recovering corrupt databases. Microsoft has also released documentation which may be able to correct some non-severe problems and restore access to email messages, without resorting to third-party solutions.

===Security issues===
Outlook Express was one of the earlier email clients to support HTML email and scripts. As a result, emails were commonly infected with viruses. Previously, another security flaw was that a script could automatically be opened as an attachment. Another bug was in Outlook Express&#x27;s attachment handling that allowed an executable to appear to be a harmless attachment such as a graphics file. Opening or previewing the email could cause code to run without the user&#x27;s knowledge or consent. Outlook Express uses Internet Explorer to render HTML email. Internet Explorer has been subjected to many security vulnerabilities and concerns.

With Outlook Express SP2 (part of Windows XP SP2), Microsoft has tried to correct the security holes. Outlook Express now blocks images inside emails by default. It uses only the restricted security zone for HTML email, which disables scripts and imposes restrictions on what web content can be rendered. It also warns when opening potentially malicious attachments.

===Handling of PGP/MIME signed messages===
Outlook Express does not correctly handle MIME, and will not display the body of signed messages inline. Users get a filled email and one attachment (one of the message text and one of the signature) and therefore need to open an attachment to see the email. If the email has been forwarded several times, users need to open attached email messages one inside the other multiple times to reach the parent email message. This bug has still not been rectified. The proper behavior is described in RFC 1847.
When replying or forwarding a message to a user who has a digital signature, Outlook Express gives an error and does not allow the user to continue if there is no digital signature installed for the sender.

===Extensibility===
Outlook Express does not have a documented object model like Microsoft Outlook. Programmatic access to, or control of Outlook Express for custom messaging applications or plugins is not officially documented or supported by Microsoft. codice_1 and codice_2 interfaces were documented in 2003, but they are only related to the storage.

Some companies have managed to create their plugins hacking the interface using Windows hooks. A significant one was the PGP plugin because it was the only example of a working plugin whose source code was available (licensed under GPL). By 2003, some companies provided commercial solutions to develop add-ins.

===Office 2007 spell checker incompatibility===
Outlook Express did not have a dedicated spell checker. It used the spell checkers from Microsoft Office if Office was also installed. However, the Office 2007 spell checkers, except for the French spell checker, were incompatible with Outlook Express. Microsoft acknowledged this problem, but did not provide any sort of remedy. There were third party files that fixed the issue, but Microsoft never took action.

===Glitches and other unusual aspects===
Cancelling sending an email while it is being sent would not effectively prevent it from being sent. Similarly, when importing codice_3 files, cancelling the import while it was in progress merely canceled the import of the current folder and the import resumed with the next folder. Furthermore, Outlook Express only supported .dbx files that were smaller than 2 GB, and had performance problems when dealing with files approaching that limit.

<text>Nore og Uvdal is a municipality in Buskerud county, Norway. It is part of the traditional region of Numedal. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Rødberg.

The area of &quot;Nore&quot; was separated from the municipality of Rollag in 1858. The municipality of Nore was divided into two municipalities on 1 January 1901: Nore and Uvdal. These two municipalities were merged back together on 1 January 1962, and the new municipality was called &quot;Nore og Uvdal&quot;.

==General information==

===Name===
The municipalities of Nore and Uvdal were joined together in 1962 into &quot;Nore og Uvdal&quot;.

The Old Norse form of Nore was &quot;Nórar&quot;. The name is the plural form of &quot;nór&quot; which means &quot;narrow sound or strait&quot;. The name originally belonged to the vicarage (and church site) at Norefjorden.

The Old Norse form of Uvdal was &quot;Uppdalr&quot;. The first element is &quot;upp&quot; meaning &quot;upper&quot; or &quot;high&quot; and the last element is &quot;dalr&quot; which means &quot;valley&quot; or &quot;dale&quot;. The name originally belonged to the vicarage and old church site. Prior to 1933, the name was spelled &quot;Opdal&quot;.

===Coat-of-arms===
The coat-of-arms is from modern times. It was granted on 26 March 1982. The arms are divided diagonally with the colors green on yellow above the line and yellow on green below. The economy of the municipality is based on agriculture and forestry. Hence the upper half of the arms shows a barn for the storage of grains and the lower half a watermill wheel which was used to saw trees.

<doc id="176289" wikidata="Q333479" url="?curid=176289" title="Mad Jack Fuller">
<text>John Fuller (20 February 1757 – 11 April 1834), better known as &quot;Mad Jack&quot; Fuller (although he himself preferred to be called &quot;Honest John&quot; Fuller), was Squire of the hamlet of Brightling, in Sussex, and politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1780 and 1812. He was a builder of follies, philanthropist, patron of the arts and sciences, and slave owner and a supporter of slavery. He purchased and commissioned many paintings from J. M. W. Turner. He was sponsor and mentor to Michael Faraday.

== Early life ==
Fuller was born on 20 February 1757 in North Stoneham, Hampshire. He was christened in the village of Waldron, near Heathfield in Sussex, in the south of England. His parents were the Reverend Henry Fuller (15 January 1713 – 23 July 1761) and his wife (also his cousin) Frances, &quot;née&quot; Fuller (1725 – 14 February 1778).

He lost his father in 1761, when he was four. At the age of ten, in 1767, he began his education at Eton College, a famous public school in Berkshire.

On 7 May 1777, Jack Fuller&#x27;s uncle Rose Fuller, MP died, leaving Jack his Sussex estates and Jamaican plantations. Jack Fuller thus took possession of the Rose Hill estate (now Brightling Park) at Brightling, Sussex at the age of 20.

== Political career ==
In 1779, John &quot;Mad Jack&quot; Fuller, at the age of 22, was captain of a light infantry company in the Sussex Militia. In 1796, Fuller was appointed High Sheriff of Sussex, for a period of one year, and in 1798, he became a captain in the Sussex Gentlemen and Yeomanry Cavalry.

In 1780, at the age of 23, Jack Fuller was elected to Parliament. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Southampton from 1780 to 1784, and for Sussex from 1801 to 1812.

Fuller was a noted drunk. On 27 February 1810 he was involved in an incident with the Speaker in Parliament, which led to him being seized by the Serjeant-at-Arms and to public disgrace. At that time he was serving on a committee that was enquiring into the reasons behind the disastrous Walcheren Expedition the previous year.

Fuller owned two Jamaican plantations- along with the slaves who worked them- which he had inherited from his uncle, Rose Fuller. In one debate he claimed that West Indian slaves lived in better conditions than many people in England.

On 17 July 1781, Fuller&#x27;s sister Elizabeth married Sir John Palmer Acland, a grandson of Sir Hugh Acland MP, in St. Marylebone in London.

In 1790, at the age of 33, he proposed marriage to Susannah Arabella Thrale, daughter of Henry Thrale and Hester Thrale but was rebuffed. He never married, and is not known to have had any children.

In 1811, a pyramid-shaped building, often referred to as &quot;The Pyramid&quot;, was erected in the churchyard of the Church of St. Thomas à Becket in Brightling as a future mausoleum for Jack Fuller.

Fuller retired from politics in 1812, not standing for re-election in the General Election of that year.

== Later life ==

Fuller was a supporter and sponsor of the Royal Institution in London. He acted as mentor and supporter of the young Michael Faraday. In 1818 he loaned the Institution £1000 (about £100,000 in today&#x27;s value) and later wrote off this debt.

In 1828 he established the Fuller medal of the Royal Institution and in early 1833 he founded the Fullerian Professorship of Chemistry to which Michael Faraday was appointed as the first professor. Later he also endowed the institution with the Fullerian Professorship of Physiology. In contemporary times, use of the Fullerian title has been discontinued, and the two chairs will no longer be filled.

In 1818, Fuller built the Observatory at Brightling which had been designed by Robert Smirke, and in 1822, he endowed Eastbourne in Sussex with its first lifeboat. Unsubstantiated sources claim that in 1828, he financed the building of the Belle Tout Lighthouse, on the cliff at Beachy Head, near Eastbourne. The first Belle Tout lighthouse was a temporary wooden structure that started service on 1 October 1828. The construction of the permanent granite lighthouse began in 1829 and it became operational on 11 October 1834. On Thursday, 18 September 1828, Jack Fuller bought Bodiam Castle for 3000 guineas at auction to save it from destruction.

On the afternoon of Friday 11 April 1834, Fuller died at his home, 36 Devonshire Place, London. He was buried under the Pyramid in Brightling churchyard. Local legend for many years told that he was buried in his pyramid seated at a table with a cooked chicken and a bottle of his favourite claret, although on excavation this turned out not to be true but is still told locally. The main beneficiaries of his will were his nephew, Peregrine Palmer Fuller Palmer Acland (1789–1871) and General Sir Augustus Elliot Fuller (1777–1857) who was John Fuller&#x27;s first cousin once removed.

Fuller is still fondly remembered locally in Sussex as a good kindly man, who during times of great hardship gave employment to many local men to build a wall around his estate in Brightling.

<text>A personal information manager (often referred to as a PIM tool or, more simply, a PIM) is a type of application software that functions as a personal organizer. The acronym PIM is now, more commonly, used in reference to personal information management as a field of study. As an information management tool, a PIM tool&#x27;s purpose is to facilitate the recording, tracking, and management of certain types of &quot;personal information&quot;.

==Scope==
Personal information can include any of the following:
* Address books
* Alerts
* A digital calendar with calendar dates, such as:
** Anniversaries
** s 
** Birthdays
** Events
** Meetings
* Education records
* Email addresses
* Fax communications
* Itineraries
* Instant message archives
* Legal documents
* Lists (such as reading lists, task lists)
* Medical information, such as healthcare provider contact information, medical history, prescriptions
* Passwords and login credentials
* Personal file collections (digital and physical): documents, music, photos, videos and similar
* Personal diary/journal/memos/notes
* Project management features
* Recipes
* Reference materials (including scientific references, websites of interest)
* RSS/Atom feeds
* Reminders
* Voicemail communications

==Synchronization ==
Some PIM/PDM software products are capable of synchronizing data over a computer network, including mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). This feature typically stores the personal data on cloud drives allowing for continuous concurrent data updates/access, on the user&#x27;s computers, including desktop computers, laptop computers, and mobile devices, such a personal digital assistants or smartphones.)

==History==
Prior to the introduction of the term &quot;Personal digital assistant&quot; (&quot;PDA&quot;) by Apple in 1992, handheld personal organizers such as the Psion Organiser and the Sharp Wizard were also referred to as &quot;PIMs&quot;.

The time management and communications functions of PIMs largely migrated from PDAs to smartphones, with Apple, RIM (Research In Motion, now BlackBerry), and others all manufacturing smartphones that offer most of the functions of earlier PDAs.

<doc id="176294" wikidata="Q1500894" url="?curid=176294" title="Solemn League and Covenant">
<text>The Solemn League and Covenant was an agreement between the Scottish Covenanters and the leaders of the English Parliamentarians in 1643 during the First English Civil War, a theatre of conflict in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. On 17 August 1643, the Church of Scotland (the Kirk) accepted it and on 25 September 1643 so did the English Parliament and the Westminster Assembly.

==English Parliament (First Civil War)==
At the time, the Protestant leaders of the English Parliament were in conflict with King Charles I. Fearing Irish Catholic troops could join the Royalist army, Parliament requested the aid of the Scots. The Presbyterian Covenanters promised their aid, on condition that the Scottish system of church government was adopted in England. This was acceptable to the majority of the English Long Parliament, as many MPs were Presbyterians, while others preferred allying with the Scots rather than losing the Civil War.
After some haggling a document called &quot;&quot; was drawn up. This was in effect a treaty between the English parliament and its Scottish counterpart for the preservation of the reformed religion in Scotland, the reformation of religion in England and Ireland &quot;according to the word of God and the example of the best reformed churches&quot;, and the &quot;extirpation of popery [and] prelacy&quot;. It did not explicitly mention Presbyterianism, and included some ambiguous formulations which left the door open to the English Independents, another strong faction on the English Parliamentary side, particularly in the parliamentary armies. It was subscribed to by many in England, Scotland, and Ireland, approved by the English Long Parliament, and, with some slight modifications, by the Westminster Assembly of Divines.

However, not all those on the English Parliamentarian side were happy with this arrangement and some, like John Lilburne, chose to leave the parliamentary armies rather than take the oath prescribed in the Act enforcing the &quot;Solemn League and Covenant&quot;.

The agreement meant that the Covenanters sent another army south to England to fight on the Parliamentarian side in the First English Civil War. When the Scots army entered England by invitation of the English Parliament in January 1644 the Parliamentary Committee of Safety was replaced by an ad hoc committee representative of both kingdoms which, by parliamentary ordinance of 16 February, was formally constituted the Committee of Both Kingdoms. Its object was the management of peace overtures to, or making war on, King Charles I. The Scots withdrew from the committee after the end of the First Civil War, although it continued to sit and from then on was known as the Derby House Committee (as it sat in Derby House in London).

==Engagement and Charles I (Second Civil War)==
After the Royalists had lost the First Civil War, Charles I was able to enter into an &quot;Engagement&quot; with the majority of the Covenanters in which they agreed to support him in the Second English Civil War against their mutual enemy the English Independents, in return for Charles imposing Presbyterianism for three years on England. In 1648 the Royalists and the Covenanters were defeated at the Battle of Preston, and Charles was executed in January 1649.

==Charles II (Third Civil War)==

After the Kirk Party seized power from the unsuccessful and therefore discredited Engagers, the new Scottish Covenanter government persuaded the exiled Charles II to agree to the terms of the &quot;Solemn League and Covenant&quot; in the Treaty of Breda (1650). However, the defeat of the Royalist and Scottish army at the Battle of Worcester in 1651 ended the relevance of the &quot;Solemn League and Covenant&quot; as the power of the Presbyterians was broken on both sides of the border.

==Restoration and the Sedition Act==
After the Restoration the English Parliament passed the Sedition Act 1661, which declared that the &quot;Solemn League and Covenant&quot; was unlawful, was to be abjured by all persons holding public offices, and was to be burnt by the common hangman.

<text>The White Mountains are a mountain range covering about a quarter of the state of New Hampshire and a small portion of western Maine in the United States. They are a subrange of the northern Appalachian Mountains and the most rugged mountains in New England. Several of the higher peaks contain an Alpine tundra. The range is heavily visited due to its proximity to Boston, New York City, and Montreal.

Most of the area is public land, including the White Mountain National Forest and a number of state parks. Its most famous mountain is Mount Washington, which is the highest peak in the Northeastern U.S. and for 76 years held the record for fastest surface wind gust in the world ( in 1934). Mount Washington is part of a line of summits, the Presidential Range, that are named after U.S. presidents and other prominent Americans.

The White Mountains also include the Franconia Range, Sandwich Range, Carter-Moriah Range and Kinsman Range in New Hampshire, and the Mahoosuc Range straddling the border between it and Maine. In all, there are 48 peaks within New Hampshire as well as one (Old Speck Mountain) in Maine over , known as the four-thousand footers.

The Whites are known for a system of alpine huts for hikers operated by the Appalachian Mountain Club. The Appalachian Trail crosses the area from southwest to northeast.

==Etymology==
It is not clear where the name &quot;White Mountains&quot; came from. There is no record of what Native Americans called the range, although pre-Colonial names for many individual peaks are known. The name and similar ones such as &quot;White Hills&quot; or &quot;Wine Hills&quot; are found in literature from Colonial times. According to tradition, the mountains were first sighted from shipboard off the coast near the Piscataqua estuary. The highest peaks would often be snow-capped, appearing white. An alternate theory is that the mica-laden granite of the summits looked white to observers.

==Geology and physiography==
The White Mountains are a physiographic section of the larger New England province, which in turn is part of the larger Appalachian Highlands physiographic division.

The magma intrusions forming the White Mountains today were created 124 to 100 million years ago as the North American Plate moved westward over the New England hotspot.

Widespread evidence of glaciation may be seen in the U-shaped form of various notches, or mountain passes. Glacial cirques form the heads of Tuckerman Ravine on Mt. Washington and King Ravine on Mt. Adams. Glacial striations are visible at numerous locations, including on the exposed rocks at the summit of Pine Mountain in Gorham.

The Red Hill Syenite, a rock unit of the White Mountains, found in central New Hampshire, is of interest to researchers due to the fact that it contains feldspathoids as well as quartz-bearing rocks.

==Attractions==
The White Mountain National Forest, formed in 1911 after passage of the Weeks Act, includes most of the mountain range and now covers in New Hampshire and western Maine. The Mount Washington Auto Road and Mount Washington Cog Railway ascend the range&#x27;s highest peak, which hosts a visitor center and weather observatory. Heavily visited Arethusa Falls, the second tallest waterfall in New Hampshire, lies on a southwest flank of Crawford Notch. The Old Man of the Mountain, a rock formation on Cannon Mountain that resembled the craggy profile of a man&#x27;s face, was a White Mountain landmark until it fell in May 2003. It remains the state symbol of New Hampshire. The range also includes a natural feature dubbed &quot;The Basin&quot;, consisting of a granite bowl, in diameter, fed by a waterfall, worn smooth by the Pemigewasset River. The areas around The Basin are popular spots for swimming in the cold water.

The range is crossed north–south by U.S. Route 3 and Interstate 93 through Franconia Notch and New Hampshire Route 16 through Pinkham Notch, and east–west by the Kancamagus Highway (part of New Hampshire Route 112) through Kancamagus Pass and U.S. Route 302 through Crawford Notch. Many of these highways are designated as scenic routes.

Several amusement parks lie in or near the White Mountains, including Story Land, Santa&#x27;s Village, Whale&#x27;s Tale Water Park and Clark&#x27;s Trading Post. The White Mountains region is also home to numerous hiking attractions through the various river gorges, ravines, and caves in the area. The Flume Gorge, Lost River Reservation and Polar Caves Park all provide moderate hikes that one can complete in a few hours. Skiing is a popular attraction in the area. Cannon Mountain Ski Area, Loon Mountain Ski Resort, Attitash Mountain Resort, Wildcat Mountain Ski Area, Bretton Woods Mountain Resort, and Waterville Valley Resort are all popular winter ski resorts, and many of them provide year-round outdoor activities such as bridle paths, hiking trails, alpine slides, and the like. The Mount Washington Hotel located in Bretton Woods was the site of the Bretton Woods Conference following World War II, and today remains one of the few early twentieth century grand hotels still in use. An estimated six million visitors visit the region yearly.

==Mapping==

Some of the earliest maps of the White Mountains were produced as tourist maps and not topographical maps. One of the first two tourist maps of the mountains was that produced by Franklin Leavitt, a self-taught artist born near Lancaster, New Hampshire in 1824. Leavitt&#x27;s hand-drawn map, today in the collection of Harvard University, is largely folk art, but does convey some of the region&#x27;s features. Leavitt drew several versions of his map, beginning in 1852. The fourth version, printed in 1871, was printed at Boston and carried a retail price of one dollar. Other early maps of the region were drawn by H. Conant and by Harvard astronomer George Phillips Bond, who published the first topographical map of the region in 1853.

==Art==

The White Mountains drew hundreds of painters during the 19th century. This group of artists is sometimes referred to as belonging to the &quot;White Mountain school&quot; of art. Others dispute the notion that these painters were a &quot;school&quot;, since they did not all paint in the same style as, for example, those artists of the Hudson River School.

==In literature and drama==

Nathaniel Hawthorne chose the White Mountains as the setting for his short story &quot;The Great Carbuncle&quot;. Other White Mountain tales by Hawthorne include &quot;The Ambitious Guest&quot;, &quot;Sketches from Memory&quot; and &quot;The Great Stone Face&quot;. The White Mountain region also figures prominently in the writings of Louisa May Alcott, including the novel &quot;Eight Cousins&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Rose in Bloom&quot;.

<text>Zenobi was a video game company that was known for its interactive fiction. The company was started by John Wilson in 1986 and continued in various forms until 2013. The company produced and published adventure games for the ZX Spectrum (along with the Atari ST) range of home computers, operating as a commercial entity from 1986 to 1997, selling the titles by mail-order. Zenobi&#x27;s titles included adaptations of &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot;, &quot;Bored of the Rings&quot;, &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; and &quot;Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot;. Emulator images were also available for PC and Amiga users. In its later years Zenobi concentrated on emulator users and produced numerous compilation CDs and DVDs.

On September 1, 2018, after a thirty-year hiatus, a Zenobi adventure game written by John Wilson, &quot;Ramsbottom Smith and the Quest For the Yellow Spheroid&quot;, was released for the ZX Spectrum.

John Wilson produced games for various platforms under the moniker Pension Productions until his death in 2021.

<doc id="176301" wikidata="Q6955475" url="?curid=176301" title="NTL Incorporated">
<text>NTL Incorporated, branded as ntl:, was a United States-listed British company founded in 1992, which provided cable television, cable internet and fixed-line cable telephone services. While NTL had its headquarters in New York City, the company&#x27;s activities focused heavily on the United Kingdom, with operational headquarters in Hook, Hampshire.

NTL became the dominant cable operator in the United Kingdom, controlling more than 90% of the market. In 2005 residential services generated 78% of NTL&#x27;s revenue, and business services 22%.

In March 2006, NTL merged with fellow cable telecom company Telewest, and created &#x27;NTL:Telewest&#x27;, which then also merged with Virgin Mobile UK and Virgin.net in June 2006, creating the UK&#x27;s first &quot;quadruple play&quot; telecom provider, offering television, internet, landline phone and mobile phone services. In February 2007, NTL:Telewest was rebranded as Virgin Media.

== History ==
=== 1992–2006 ===

Barclay Knapp and George Blumenthal, the founders of American cellular network company Cellular Communications, Inc. (sold to Airtouch in 1996), established International CableTel in 1993 to take advantage of the deregulation of the UK cable market. Initially, Cabletel acquired local cable franchises covering Guildford and parts of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. In 1996 CableTel acquired National Transcommunications Limited (NTL), the privatised UK Independent Broadcasting Authority transmission-network. In May 1998 CableTel adopted &quot;NTL&quot; as its new name.

The company spent heavily: both on expanding its network and on acquiring rivals (in 1999, it acquired Cambridge Cable, one of the earliest digital networks, that had been installed across the university city ten years earlier). In July 1999, NTL purchased the consumer assets of Cable &amp; Wireless plc for nearly £8.2 billion, integrating the telephone, internet and television operations of Cable &amp; Wireless into its own ever-expanding operation. 

Devalued and struggling with debts of around $18bn, NTL had to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy-protection in May 2002 in order to organise a refinancing deal. The company did not emerge from protection until January 2003, having converted around $11bn of debt into shares – technically, this amounted to the largest debt default in US corporate history. The company reduced its debt to $6.4bn. A re-organisation split NTL itself into NTL Inc. (covering the UK and Irish markets) and NTL Europe Inc. (for the French, Swiss and German parts of the corporation). New executives replaced the NTL president, CEO and co-founder Barclay Knapp, as well as Stephen Carter, the MD and COO.

After exiting from Chapter 11 protection NTL produced an operating profit. In 2004, it announced plans to split the broadcasting division off from the main company. In December 2004, NTL sold its broadcast-unit to a consortium led by Macquarie Communications Infrastructure Group (MCG) for £1.27 billion. Macquarie renamed the division &quot;Arqiva&quot; in May 2005. This sale allowed NTL to focus on its &quot;core businesses&quot; of providing communications packages and cable services.

In late 2004, NTL purchased the remaining shares of the Internet service provider (ISP) virgin.net, originally a joint venture between NTL and Richard Branson&#x27;s Virgin Group.

By 2005, its UK network consisted of a 7,800 km fibre backbone with the potential to reach 8.4 million residential homes and around 610,000 businesses. In January of that year, NTL started rolling out video on demand. With content selected by NTL, this service covered genres including music videos, children&#x27;s programming and adult entertainment, as an extension to the basic &#x27;pay per view&#x27; services the company offered for film and sport content. The new service allowed customers to rewind, fast forward and pause content.

Despite NTL Ireland turning a profit, in May 2005, NTL sold their Dublin, Galway, and Waterford cable business (which they had acquired in 1999 for €825 million from the Irish government) to UGC Europe for €325 million – this after having spent in excess of €100 million on network infrastructure, resulting in a loss of €500 million, more than 50% of the purchase price. Liberty Global continued to use the NTL brand in Ireland, but was eventually merged with Chorus Communications and rebranded as UPC Ireland in May 2010.

By July 2005, NTL had cut its debt to £1.445 billion with an operating cashflow of £178 million. The company had 3.2 million customers buying at least one service from them, with the 1.4 million subscribers to broadband services making NTL the market leader in this field.

=== Telewest ===

=== NTL/Telewest merger ===

From late 2003 discussions commenced on a merger between Telewest and NTL. Thanks to their geographically different areas, NTL and Telewest had co-operated previously, as in re-directing potential customers living outside their respective areas. On 3 October 2005, NTL announced a USD$6 billion purchase of Telewest, forming one of the largest media companies in the UK. The merger agreement as structured would have left NTL having to negotiate with BBC Worldwide, the BBC&#x27;s commercial arm, due to a change-of-ownership clause written into the agreement for UKTV, a joint venture with Telewest&#x27;s Flextech content division. To prevent this, Telewest instead acquired NTL.

The parties completed the merger on 3 March 2006, making the merged company the UK&#x27;s largest cable-provider, with more than 90% of the market. Once merged, the combined company renamed itself to ntl:Telewest, with ex-NTL shareholders controlling 75% of the stock and ex-Telewest shareholders 25%. Nine of the eleven directors of the new board came from NTL and two from Telewest.

=== Virgin Mobile merger ===

In December 2005 NTL and Virgin Mobile announced that talks had taken place regarding a merger.

Virgin Mobile&#x27;s independent directors rejected the original bid of £817 million ($1.4 billion), taking the view that NTL&#x27;s bid &quot;undervalued the business&quot;. Sir Richard Branson reportedly expressed confidence that a re-structured deal could go ahead, and in January 2006 NTL increased its offer to £961m (372p per share). On 4 April 2006, NTL Incorporated announced a £962.4m recommended offer for Virgin Mobile. According to reports, Branson accepted a mix of shares and cash, making him a 10.7% shareholder of the combined company.

The takeover, which was completed on 4 July 2006, created the UK&#x27;s first &#x27;quadruple play&#x27; media company, bringing together television, Internet broadband, mobile-phone and fixed-line phone services. The deal included a 30-year exclusive branding agreement that saw NTL adopt the Virgin name across its consumer operations as it merged operations with its current Telewest brand. As a result, on 8 November 2006, NTL announced it would change its name to Virgin Media plc.

=== Proposed ITV merger ===

In November 2006, NTL announced that it had approached commercial television broadcaster ITV about a proposed merger. BSkyB effectively blocked the merger on 12 November 2006, when it controversially bought a 17.9% stake in ITV plc, a move that attracted anger from NTL shareholder Richard Branson and an investigation from media and telecoms regulator Ofcom. On 6 December 2006, NTL announced that it had complained to the Office of Fair Trading about BSkyB&#x27;s move, and that it would withdraw its attempt to buy ITV plc, stating that it did not believe that it could currently make a deal on favourable terms.

== Services ==

=== Internet ===

NTL offered broadband Internet access connections through cable. The service operates through SACMs (Stand-alone cable modems) and set-top boxes (STBs).

In NTL areas customers could also access a 512 kbit/s download-speed; and both NTL and Telewest offer dial-up Internet services on a pay-as-you-go basis, or at a fixed monthly fee of £14.99 for unlimited usage.

The broadband services did not have a bandwidth-cap or a fair-usage policy; this means that customers have unlimited usage and need pay no extra charges related to the amount of data downloaded. However NTL has admitted introducing traffic shaping.

NTL started trialling 20 Mbit/s, and temporarily upgraded some 10 Mbit/s subscribers to this speed in October 2006. Furthermore, NTL started conducting trials of a 100 Mbit broadband service on its cable network.

After trials in the Guildford area from mid-1999, NTL launched its original broadband services at the same time that NTL acquired the Cable business of Cable and Wireless (early 2000). In the &quot;original NTL&quot; (also known as &quot;Langley&quot;) areas, NTL has always supplied broadband services via DOCSIS cable-modems. In these areas the digital television set-top boxes used an incompatible standard, DAVIC.

Initially, NTL decided to terminate service to approximately 90,000 ex-Cable and Wireless subscribers on short notice. This threatened to leave customers stranded and without access to their email or websites and was due to NTL&#x27;s lack of infrastructure capability in some areas. Before termination of services, Boltblue struck a deal with NTL and Cable and Wireless Communications to save 90,000
 and later an additional 210,000 customers. The roll-out of broadband services in the ex-Cable and Wireless franchises started in mid 2001.

NTL provided ex-Cable and Wireless subscribers with broadband through the set-top box (STB) also used for digital television services, adopting the rationale that subscribers could self-install. Initially, NTL supplied a &quot;Self Install Kit&quot; consisting of connecting cable, adapters and an install CD. Following demonstrated problems, NTL gradually introduced cable modems and phased out the self-install approach. The Pace STBs proved highly problematic, exhibiting two major flaws.

Firstly, large numbers of connections (for example, those with peer-to-peer (P2P) software) would cause the connection to slow down and eventually freeze the modem part of the STB (also required for interactive TV services, which suffered a similar effect when downloading). Customers in these circumstances had to re-boot the STB.

Secondly, the single processor and sharing the internal modem between television and broadband services made the television part of the box slow and unresponsive, for example making it extremely difficult to change channel using the remote. This became particularly evident when using the lower &quot;Tiers of Service&quot; such the 128 kbit/s downstream 64 kbit/s upstream, as the digital television set-top box without broadband service actually enjoyed a 256 kbit/s upstream.

Although capable of higher speeds (up to 4 Mbit/s), NTL did not make speeds higher than 1 Mbit/s available due to degradation of the DTV service.

NTL eventually replaced the Pace set-top boxes with Samsung models that used a dual-processor architecture, overcoming the shortcomings of the Pace, and capable of much better downstream performance. However, with the advent of higher &quot;Tiers of Service&quot; of 10 Mbit/s downstream and higher, plus the reducing cost of NTL&#x27;s cable modems (supplied by Ambit Broadband) NTL now supplies all subscribers with cable modems.

The NTL network runs through transparent proxy servers. Up to 15 server addresses host each area. These transparent proxy servers also override the user&#x27;s hosts file and prevent manual DNS updates. This makes it easier for NTL to provide a more reliable connection as well as being able to monitor traffic requirements in each area. This also causes many problems for websites which record IP addresses to ban and/or track users. This means that if a website bans one offender, it bans everyone in the same area. Also, many on-line games automatically ban IP addresses with multiple usernames associated with them. Small-scale games do not cause too many problems, but when friends attempt to spread the game around, the system prevents everyone (including the original player) from using the game.
On the other hand, advanced users can easily create a large number of illegitimate accounts on the aforementioned websites, allowing one user both to prevent all other users on the NTL network using the game, as well as to become untraceable.

NTL has used MAC addresses to track and register customers to the NTL internet service. As NTL had not supported the use of routers, or Xbox on the minority Set Top Box based Broadband Internet service, users had to use a clone MAC address feature to connect to the Internet when using an STB. This has become a common problem for people wishing to connect their Xbox to the existing internet connection through a router or PC connected to their STB, if they fail to use the official registration process. (These comments do not apply to the majority (&gt;90%) use of cable modems).

=== Television ===

The digital television service, which launched in 2000, offered a number of products including true video on demand, a PVR, and HDTV. On 1 September 2006, NTL introduced the FreeTV digital package to its telephone subscribers free of charge. However, value-pack customers lost their value-pack discounts if they integrated the FreeTV deal into their existing packages.

==== PVR and high definition services ====
NTL launched TV Drive, its high-definition television (HDTV) and personal video recorder (PVR) service in Glasgow and Teesside on 16 November 2006. The service relied on the service of the same name offered in NTL&#x27;s Telewest areas, and used a new PVR set-top-box, with three tuners and a 160GB hard disk for up to 80 hours&#x27; recording. The presence of three tuners meant that the TV Drive could record two channels at the same time while the user was watching a third.

==== Video on demand ====

NTL started to roll out its Video on Demand (VoD) service branded &quot;NTL On Demand&quot;, using the Teleport system on Telewest&#x27;s network. In contrast to Sky which, due to technical limitations, could only provide near-VOD services, NTL On Demand provided a true VoD system. The service allowed customers of NTL digital television to download programmes as and when they wanted to watch them from servers at the customer&#x27;s local head-end. As the broadcaster automatically stored content on NTL&#x27;s servers, it removed the need to pre-record many programmes. Users could search through a large library of programmes and watch them when they wanted to as part of their subscription. This library included a free 7-day watch-again feature for TV programmes produced by the BBC, Channel 4 and Flextech. NTL also offered other television shows, films (service branded FilmFlex), and music videos, mostly for an additional fee. The VoD service also provided HD content that would work in conjunction with the TV Drive PVR.

==== Fixed-line telephone ====
NTL also provided telephone services to its customers, as the second-largest fixed-line telephony provider in the UK, behind BT, who until 1984 held the monopoly on fixed-line telephony services in the UK. In 2003, revenue from mobile lines became greater than the fixed-line telephone revenue.

==== Premium TV ====

Premium TV was a subsidiary of NTL. It purchased stakes in Rangers F.C., Celtic F.C., Aston Villa F.C., Middlesbrough F.C., Newcastle United F.C. and Leicester City F.C. The investments included interest free loans to the clubs to act as their exclusive agent for the sale of media sponsorship, advertising and publishing rights across all media platforms, including ownership of the clubs live television and radio rights.

Premium TV operated and fully funded Boro TV for Middlesbrough F.C. from February 1998. Boro TV Extra was added in August 2001, taking advantage of the relaxation in the TV rights regulations. Both channels were closed in July 2005 after NTL withdrew funding.

In March 2000, news broke that NTL would spend more than £200 million ($316 million at the time) for a decade-long deal to own exclusive worldwide television and internet streaming rights to the events at the &quot;Super 12&quot; group of horseracing courses. This involved deals with BBC, Channel 4, and NTL&#x27;s own Premium TV networks.

On 14 June 2000, NTL won the rights to show 40 live Premier League matches on a pay-per-view basis for three years, beginning at the start of the 2001–02 season. NTL would pay approximately £109 million per annum for the rights. NTL pulled out of the deal on 18 October 2000, claiming that it was &quot;unable to agree final terms&quot;. The failure to complete the deal, led to a lack of confidence in their proposed 2005 joint bid with ITV plc.

On 19 June 2000, NTL entered into a joint venture with The Football League to set up an internet portal for all 72 clubs. Under the terms of the deal, NTL would pay rights fees of up to £65 million over five years, with all participating clubs sharing in the profits of the joint venture, with a variable term in the region of 20 years. Premium TV was eventually able to set up 78 football club websites after adding its partially owned clubs. The deal had with The Football League had to be renegotiated in September 2002 after NTL could no longer afford to pay its instalments. The League clubs would now receive £5m and an 80-per-cent share of all future revenue earned by the venture until the total amount reaches the original figure of £35m.

NTL, through Premium TV, launched the ITN News Channel, a joint venture with ITN, on 1 August 2000. In June 2002, Carlton Television and Granada Television – the predecessors of ITV plc – bought out ITN&#x27;s 65-per-cent stake. This led to a rebrand as the ITV News Channel in September 2002. In April 2004 the newly created ITV plc bought NTL&#x27;s remaining 35-per-cent stake to assume full control of the channel.

Premium TV also oversaw NTL&#x27;s 49-per-cent share in pay-per-view movie service Front Row, in joint venture with Telewest and NTL&#x27;s 48.1-per-cent stake in interactive television technology and games firm, Two Way TV.

Premium TV also operated Lions TV between June and August 2001, covering 2001 British Lions tour to Australia. The channel showcased eight, one hour &#x27;behind the scenes&#x27; programmes to be made by Premium TV.

Premium TV also provided the funds to create programming specifically for the UK feed (British Eurosport) of the pan-European channel Eurosport. It did not have a stake in the sports channel, but got a share of revenue.

Premium TV planned to launch a live sports channel in September 2001 called British Sport, which would have combined archive footage from the BBC with live coverage of rugby union, basketball and ice hockey. Premium TV dropped its plans after realising it could not compete with other sports broadcasters, such as ITV and BSkyB. Instead Premium TV chose to launch a channel with the working title of Classic Sport, offering classic BBC sports footage from the &quot;Grandstand&quot; archives, the channel never materialised. The Ice Hockey Superleague issued a high court writ claiming damages of up to £10m from the company, after its £1m-a-year TV deal was cancelled at short notice. The Superleague settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.

Premium TV was spun-out of NTL&#x27;s UK cable operations and into NTL Europe Inc. in 2002, as part of a rescue plan devised by Barclay Knapp. Premium TV was placed under the control of the crisis and turnaround advisory group, Quest Turnaround Advisors. Quest negotiated commercial contracts with joint venture partners to eliminate £43 million of parent company guarantees and generated $10 million cash through restructuring. At the same time, Quest doubled paid subscribers to 75,000, cut staff by 50-per-cent, and broke even within 15 months of taking control. The business was then sold for $54 million to Access Industries, who merged it with Inform Group in 2007 to create Perform.

== Broadcasting ==
In February 2001, NTL and Vivendi Universal launched The Studio, a 50:50 joint venture film channel which was carried by cable networks in the UK and Ireland. It closed in January 2003.

<text>The Mayflower Compact, originally titled Agreement Between the Settlers of New Plymouth, was the first governing document of Plymouth Colony. It was written by the men aboard the &quot;Mayflower,&quot; consisting of Separatist Puritans, adventurers, and tradesmen. Although the agreement contained a pledge of loyalty to the King, the Puritans and other Protestant Separatists were dissatisfied with the state of the Church of England, the limited extent of the English Reformation and reluctance of King James I of England to enforce further reform.

The Mayflower Compact was signed aboard ship on , 1620. Signing the covenant were 41 of the ship&#x27;s 101 passengers; the &quot;Mayflower&quot; was anchored in Provincetown Harbor within the hook at the northern tip of Cape Cod.

==History==
The Pilgrims had originally hoped to reach America in early October using two ships, but delays and complications meant they could use only one, the &quot;Mayflower&quot;. Their intended destination had been the Colony of Virginia, with the journey financed by the Company of Merchant Adventurers of London. Storms forced them to anchor at the hook of Cape Cod in Massachusetts, however, as it was unwise to continue with provisions running short. This inspired some of the non-Puritan passengers (whom the Puritans referred to as &quot;Strangers&quot;) to proclaim that they &quot;would use their own liberty; for none had power to command them&quot; since they would not be settling in the agreed-upon Virginia territory. To prevent this, the Pilgrims determined to establish their own government, while still affirming their allegiance to the Crown of England. Thus, the Mayflower Compact was based simultaneously upon a majoritarian model and the settlers&#x27; allegiance to the king. It was in essence a social contract in which the settlers consented to follow the community&#x27;s rules and regulations for the sake of order and survival.

Similar arguments had been unsuccessfully made by the shipwrecked passengers of the &quot;Sea Venture&quot;, a similar, earlier group bound for the Colony of Virginia, and specifically by one Stephen Hopkins, who had, as a result, been convicted of mutiny and sentenced to death, but pardoned, and is thought to be the Stephen Hopkins aboard the &quot;Mayflower&quot; and among the Compact signatories.

The Pilgrims had lived for some years in Leiden, a city in the Dutch Republic. Historian Nathaniel Philbrick states, &quot;Just as a spiritual covenant had marked the beginning of their congregation in Leiden, a civil covenant would provide the basis for a secular government in America.&quot;

== Text ==
The original document has been lost, but three versions exist from the 17th century: printed in &quot;Mourt&#x27;s Relation&quot; (1622), which was reprinted in &quot;Purchas his Pilgrimes&quot; (1625); hand-written by William Bradford in his journal &quot;Of Plimoth Plantation&quot; (1646); and printed by Bradford&#x27;s nephew Nathaniel Morton in &quot;New-Englands Memorial&quot; (1669). The three versions differ slightly in wording and significantly in spelling, capitalization, and punctuation. William Bradford wrote the first part of &quot;Mourt&#x27;s Relation&quot;, including its version of the compact, so he wrote two of the three versions. The wording of those two versions is quite similar, unlike that of Morton. Bradford&#x27;s handwritten manuscript is kept in a vault at the State Library of Massachusetts.

The text as presented in modern sources is as follows:
The document was signed on .

== Signers ==


A list of 41 male passengers who signed the document was supplied by Bradford&#x27;s nephew Nathaniel Morton in his 1669 &quot;New England&#x27;s Memorial&quot;. Thomas Prince first numbered the names in his 1736 &quot;A Chronological History of New-England in the form of Annals&quot;. The original document has been lost, so Morton is the sole source for the signers. He probably had access to the original document, but he could not have known the actual order in which it was signed simply by inspecting it. Morton&#x27;s arrangement of names might not have been the arrangement on the original document, and the names on the original may not have been arranged in any orderly fashion. Prince&#x27;s numbers are based solely on Morton, as he himself stated.

Morton&#x27;s list of names was unnumbered and untitled in all six editions (1669–1855), although their order changed with successive editions. In his original 1669 edition, the names were placed on two successive pages forming six short columns, three per page. In subsequent editions, these six short columns were combined into three long columns on a single page in two different ways, producing two different orders in unnumbered lists of signers. The second (1721) and third (1772) editions changed the order of the first edition by combining the first and fourth columns into the first long column, and similarly for the other columns. The fifth (1826) and sixth (1855) editions returned the names to their original first edition order by combining the first and second short columns into the first long column, and similarly for the other columns. Prince numbered the names in their original 1669 Morton order. He added titles (Mr. or Capt.) to 11 names that were given those titles by William Bradford in the list of passengers at the end of his manuscript.

The following list of signers is organized into the six short columns of Morton (1669) with the numbers and titles of Prince. The names are given their modern spelling according to Morison. Use the numbers for the order used by genealogists and half of unnumbered lists (Samuel Fuller will be the eighth name), but merge the half columns vertically into full columns for the order used by the other half of unnumbered lists (John Turner will be the eighth name).

== Legacy ==
On November 23, 1920, at a commemoration ceremony for the 300th anniversary of the &quot;Mayflower&quot; landing, then Massachusetts governor Calvin Coolidge, who became the 30th U.S. President a few years later, said the following about the Mayflower Compact:

<text>In chemistry, an enantiomer ( ), also known as an optical isomer, antipode, or optical antipode, is one of a pair of molecular entities which are mirror images of each other and non-superposable. 

Enantiomer molecules are like right and left hands: one cannot be superposed onto the other without first being converted to its mirror image. It is solely a relationship of chirality and the permanent three-dimensional relationships among molecules or other chemical structures: no amount of re-orientiation of a molecule as a whole or conformational change converts one chemical into its enantiomer. Chemical structures with chirality rotate plane-polarized light. A mixture of equal amounts of each enantiomer, a &quot;racemic mixture&quot; or a &quot;racemate&quot;, does not rotate light.

Stereoisomers include both enantiomers and diastereomers. Diastereomers, like enantiomers, share the same molecular formula and are also nonsuperposable onto each other; however, they are not mirror images of each other.

==Naming conventions==
There are three common naming conventions for specifying one of the two enantiomers (the absolute configuration) of a given chiral molecule: the R/S system is based on the geometry of the molecule; the (+)- and (−)- system (also written using the obsolete equivalents &quot;d&quot;- and &quot;l&quot;-) is based on its optical rotation properties; and the / system is based on the molecule&#x27;s relationship to enantiomers of glyceraldehyde.

The R/S system is based on the molecule&#x27;s geometry with respect to a chiral center. The R/S system is assigned to a molecule based on the priority rules assigned by Cahn–Ingold–Prelog priority rules, in which the group or atom with the largest atomic number is assigned the highest priority and the group or atom with the smallest atomic number is assigned the lowest priority.

The (+) or (−) symbol is used to specify a molecule&#x27;s optical rotation — the direction in which the polarization of light rotates as it passes through a solution containing the molecule. When a molecule is denoted dextrorotatory, it rotates the plane of polarized light clockwise and can also be denoted as (+). When it is denoted as levorotatory, it rotates the plane of polarized light counterclockwise and can also be denoted as (−). 

The Latin words for &quot;left&quot; are &quot;laevus&quot; and &quot;sinister&quot;, and the word for &quot;right&quot; is &quot;dexter&quot; (or &quot;rectus&quot; in the sense of correct or virtuous). The English word &quot;right&quot; is a cognate of &quot;rectus&quot;. This is the origin of the D/L and R/S notations, and the employment of prefixes &quot;levo-&quot; and &quot;dextro-&quot; in common names.

The prefix &quot;ar-&quot;, from the Latin &quot;recto&quot; (right), is applied to the right-handed version; &quot;es-&quot;, from the Latin &quot;sinister&quot; (left), to the left-handed molecule. Example: ketamine, arketamine, esketamine.

== Chirality centers ==

The asymmetric atom is called a chirality center, a type of stereocenter. A chirality center is also called a &quot;chiral center&quot; or an &quot;asymmetric center&quot;. Some sources use the terms &quot;stereocenter&quot;, &quot;stereogenic center&quot;, &quot;stereogenic atom&quot; or &quot;stereogen&quot; to refer exclusively to a chirality center, while others use the terms more broadly to refer also to centers that result in diastereomers (stereoisomers that are not enantiomers).

Compounds that contain exactly one (or any odd number) of asymmetric atoms are always chiral. However, compounds that contain an even number of asymmetric atoms sometimes lack chirality because they are arranged in mirror-symmetric pairs, and are known as &quot;meso&quot; compounds. For instance, &quot;meso&quot; tartaric acid (shown on the right) has two asymmetric carbon atoms, but it does not exhibit enantiomerism because there is a mirror symmetry plane. Conversely, there exist forms of chirality that do not require asymmetric atoms, such as axial, planar, and helical chirality.

Even though a chiral molecule lacks reflection (Cs) and rotoreflection symmetries (S2&quot;n&quot;), it can have other molecular symmetries, and its symmetry is described by one of the chiral point groups: C&quot;n&quot;, D&quot;n&quot;, T, O, or I. For example, hydrogen peroxide is chiral and has C2 (two-fold rotational) symmetry. A common chiral case is the point group C1, meaning no symmetries, which is the case for lactic acid.
== Examples ==
An example of such an enantiomer is the sedative thalidomide, which was sold in a number of countries around the world from 1957 until 1961. It was withdrawn from the market when it was found to cause birth defects. One enantiomer caused the desirable sedative effects, while the other, unavoidably present in equal quantities, caused birth defects.

The herbicide mecoprop is a racemic mixture, with the (&quot;R&quot;)-(+)-enantiomer (&quot;Mecoprop-P&quot;, &quot;Duplosan KV&quot;) possessing the herbicidal activity.

Another example is the antidepressant drugs escitalopram and citalopram. Citalopram is a racemate [1:1 mixture of (&quot;S&quot;)-citalopram and (&quot;R&quot;)-citalopram]; escitalopram [(&quot;S&quot;)-citalopram] is a pure enantiomer. The dosages for escitalopram are typically 1/2 of those for citalopram. Here, (S)-citalopram is called a chiral switch of Citalopram.

== Chiral drugs ==

Enantiopure compounds consist of only one of the two enantiomers. Enantiopurity is of practical importance since such compositions have improved therapeutic efficacy. The switch from a racemic drug to an enantiopure drug is called a chiral switch. In many cases, the enantiomers have distinct effects. One case is that of Propoxyphene. The enantiomeric pair of propoxyphene is separately sold by Eli Lilly and company. One of the partners is dextropropoxyphene, an analgesic agent (Darvon) and the other is called levopropoxyphene, an effective antitussive (Novrad).  It is interesting to note that the trade names of the drugs, DARVON and NOVRAD, also reflect the chemical mirror-image relationship. In other cases, there may be no clinical benefit to the patient. In some jurisdictions, single-enantiomer drugs are separately patentable from the racemic mixture. It is possible that only one of the enantiomers is active. Or, it may be that both are active, in which case separating the mixture has no objective benefits, but extends the drug&#x27;s patentability.

==Enantioselective preparations==

In the absence of an effective enantiomeric environment (precursor, chiral catalyst, or kinetic resolution), separation of a racemic mixture into its enantiomeric components is impossible, although certain racemic mixtures spontaneously crystallize in the form of a &quot;racemic conglomerate&quot;, in which crystals of the enantiomers are physically segregated and may be separated mechanically. However, most racemates form crystals containing both enantiomers in a 1:1 ratio.

In his pioneering work, Louis Pasteur was able to isolate the isomers of sodium ammonium tartrate because the individual enantiomers crystallize separately from solution. To be sure, equal amounts of the enantiomorphic crystals are produced, but the two kinds of crystals can be separated with tweezers. This behavior is unusual. A less common method is by enantiomer self-disproportionation.

The second strategy is asymmetric synthesis: the use of various techniques to prepare the desired compound in high enantiomeric excess. Techniques encompassed include the use of chiral starting materials (chiral pool synthesis), the use of chiral auxiliaries and chiral catalysts, and the application of asymmetric induction. The use of enzymes (biocatalysis) may also produce the desired compound.

A third strategy is Enantioconvergent synthesis, the synthesis of one enantiomer from a racemic precursor, utilizing both enantiomers. By making use of a chiral catalyist, both enantiomers of the reactant result in a single enantiomer of product.

Enantiomers may not be isolable if there is an accessible pathway for racemization (interconversion between enantiomorphs to yield a racemic mixture) at a given temperature and timescale. For example, amines with three distinct substituents are chiral, but with few exceptions (e.g. substituted &quot;N&quot;-chloroaziridines), they rapidly undergo &quot;umbrella inversion&quot; at room temperature, leading to racemization. If the racemization is fast enough, the molecule can often be treated as an achiral, averaged structure.

==Parity violation==
For all intents and purposes, each enantiomer in a pair has the same energy. However, theoretical physics predicts that due to parity violation of the weak nuclear force (the only force in nature that can &quot;tell left from right&quot;), there is actually a &quot;minute&quot; difference in energy between enantiomers (on the order of 10−12 eV or 10−10 kJ/mol or less) due to the weak neutral current mechanism. This difference in energy is far smaller than energy changes caused by even small changes in molecular conformation, and far too small to measure by current technology, and is therefore chemically inconsequential. In the sense used by particle physicists, the &quot;true&quot; enantiomer of a molecule, which has exactly the same mass-energy content as the original molecule, is a mirror-image that is also &quot;built from antimatter&quot; (antiprotons, antineutrons, and positrons). Throughout this article, &quot;enantiomer&quot; is used only in the chemical sense of compounds of ordinary matter that are not superposable on their mirror image.

==&quot;Quasi&quot;-enantiomers==
&quot;Quasi&quot;-enantiomers are molecular species that are not strictly enantiomers, but behave as if they are. In &quot;quasi&quot;-enantiomers majority of the molecule is reflected; however, an atom or group within the molecule is changed to a similar atom or group. &quot;Quasi&quot;-enantiomers can also be defined as molecules that have the potential to become enantiomers if an atom or group in the molecule is replaced. An example of &quot;quasi&quot;-enantiomers would (&quot;S&quot;)-bromobutane and (&quot;R&quot;)-iodobutane. Under normal conditions the enantiomers for (&quot;S&quot;)-bromobutane and (&quot;R&quot;)-iodobutane would (&quot;R)-&quot;bromobutane and (&quot;S&quot;)-iodobutane respectively. &quot;Quasi&quot;-enantiomers would also produce quasi-racemates, which are similar to normal racemates (see Racemic mixture) in that they form an equal mixture of &quot;quasi&quot;-enantiomers.

Though not considered actual enantiomers, the naming convention for &quot;quasi-enantiomers also&quot; follows the same trend as enantiomers when looking at (&quot;R&quot;) and (&quot;S&quot;) configurations - which are considered from a geometrical basis (see Cahn–Ingold–Prelog priority rules).

&quot;Quasi&quot;-enantiomers have applications in parallel kinetic resolution.

<text>West Norwood is a largely residential area of south London within the London Borough of Lambeth, located 5.4 miles (8.7 km) south south-east of Charing Cross. The centre of West Norwood sits in a bowl surrounded by hillsides on its east, west and south sides. From many parts of the area, distant views can be seen, of places such as the City of London, Canary Wharf and Crystal Palace.

West Norwood includes some or all of three wards of the London Borough of Lambeth – Gipsy Hill, Knights Hill and West Dulwich. On Lambeth Council, Gipsy Hill and West Dulwich are represented by two councillors each, whilst Knights Hill is represented by three councillors.

== History ==

&quot;Norwood&quot; recalls the &quot;Great North Wood&quot;, a name that was formerly used for the hilly and wooded area to the north of Croydon. Before 1885 West Norwood station and the surrounding area was known as &quot;Lower Norwood&quot;, reflecting its being at a lower altitude than Upper Norwood.

John Rocque&#x27;s 1745 map of London and the surrounding area includes the Horns Tavern at Knight&#x27;s Hill, opposite what is now the main entrance to West Norwood station, with a largely undeveloped valley stretching to &#x27;Island Green&#x27; in the north, approximately where Herne Hill railway station stands now. The enclosure map of 50 years later shows that little of the original woodland remained by then, other than a few coppices.

The future development of West Norwood was assisted by the Lambeth Manor Inclosure Act 1806 (46 Geo. 3. c. lvii). Much of the land covered by this act was owned either by the Archbishop of Canterbury or by Lord Thurlow, who died in the same year.

Most of the current main roads were either ancient or laid out in accordance with the provisions of the enclosure award. The River Effra ran alongside the current Elder Road, in a northerly direction, and was prone to flooding.

The area was over a mile from the nearest parish church (at St Leonard, Streatham), so St. Luke&#x27;s was provided under the Waterloo church scheme and completed in 1825. The houses in the parish at that period consisted largely of substantial villas along the main roads and more humble cottages mainly situated between Knights Hill and the High Street. The South Metropolitan Cemetery was laid out in 1837 to provide burial facilities largely for the population of crowded areas that were closer to the centre of London.

The railway line from London to the Crystal Palace was opened in 1856 with a station at Lower Norwood (since renamed West Norwood). These improved communications heralded major changes. Many of the larger houses and gardens were demolished and replaced with predominantly more modest housing over the next four decades.

Norwood High Street contained the earliest group of shops in the area but never developed into a major shopping centre, as the main shopping parades were built during the decades around 1900 along Norwood Road between York Hill and West Norwood station. Horse-drawn trams shuttled passengers along this road from the terminus in front of St Luke&#x27;s Church towards the middle of London.

Extensive anecdotal and other historical material from the 19th and early 20th centuries has been written up by Mr J. B. Wilson, a local undertaker.

The two world wars witnessed fatalities and bomb damage to many buildings in the area, with York Hill and the areas around the railway suffering particularly badly. Chatsworth Baptist church had to be rebuilt after a direct hit. Many of the post-war estates were built on bomb sites or replaced areas which had experienced damage.

An Art Deco cinema, named The Regal, was built at 304 Norwood Road in the late 1920s. It was designed by architect F. Edward Jones (who also designed Madame Tussaud&#x27;s) and opened on 16 January 1930. The cinema sat 2,010 and was equipped with a Christie Manual organ. The cinema closed on 8 February 1964 with a double screening of Peter Sellers&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;m Alright Jack&quot; and &quot;Two Way Stretch&quot;. Following its closure, the building became a Top Rank Bingo Club a few months later and remained open until 1978. The building was demolished in November 1981 and a B&amp;Q store can be seen today on the site.

After the Second World War, a considerable amount of council housing was constructed in West Norwood. The York Hill, Fern Lodge, Portobello and Holderness Estates arose during the late 1940s and the 1950s on the sites of houses with large gardens that had been destroyed by bombing or were simply demolished. Later houses and flats, such as in the Dunbar Street area, took the place of Victorian dwellings that were cleared away as slums or, alternatively, to achieve a higher density of development. The Woodvale Estate in Elder Road was erected on the site of the &quot;Lambeth New Schools&quot;, which had been part of the local Workhouse and that had been renamed as &quot;Wood Vale&quot; before demolition.

Parts of West Norwood have been declared conservation areas including the area around the cemetery, Lancaster Avenue and Rosendale Road. Local landmarks such as St Luke&#x27;s Church, the late Victorian fire station (now the South London Theatre) on Norwood High Street, by the architect Robert Pearsall., The early 20th-century former fire station at Norwood Road and the original public library at Knights Hill are Grade II listed buildings.

===Knights Hill===
Confusingly, there are two areas called Knight&#x27;s Hill nearby; the names of both areas have similar origins, both belonging to Thomas Knyght in 1545, and in the south was known as Knight&#x27;s Hill Common while the hill to the north was known as Knight&#x27;s Hill Farm.
* The better-known area is the residential area and electoral ward to the south west by the road called Knights Hill.
The southern Knight&#x27;s Hill Common originally formed part of Lambeth Manor and contained land called Julian&#x27;s, which is remembered through the street name of St Julian&#x27;s Farm Road.
The hill formed the nucleus of the vast estate in Lambeth and Streatham that Lord Thurlow acquired during the 18th Century,
* The second Knight&#x27;s Hill is above the Tulse Hill railway tunnel, near West Dulwich railway station – which was originally called Lower Knights Hill station. It includes the hilly land between the western end of Thurlow Park Road (South Circular), Peabody Hill and Lovelace Road, and is now partly used by Rosendale Allotments in SE21. The green area is still marked as Knight&#x27;s Hill on large scale maps but is normally not marked as such on modern street maps in order to avoid confusion. Originally, the northern Knight&#x27;s Hill farm was part of the Manor of Levehurst, and later of the Manor of Leigham Court and the parish of Streatham.

=== The Jewish Orphanage ===
The main building of the Norwood Home for Jewish Children (&quot;The Jewish Orphanage&quot;) was completed in 1862. It was a three-storey edifice, with the appearance of a Jacobean palace This structure was demolished in 1963, after the children had moved in groups to live in nine houses supervised by house parents in a less institutional environment, meeting for communal activities at a new synagogue built on the original site. In the 1970s, the charity moved out of the area and the main site was sold to Lambeth Council, which developed much of it for a housing estate, keeping only a small area beside the railway line as open space and converting the synagogue into a community facility known as the Norwood Hall. Some of this open space is now occupied by the West Norwood Health and Leisure Centre but the site of Norwood Hall has been landscaped. An account of a boy&#x27;s experiences of living at the Orphanage between 1928 and 1933 can be found online.

Of the original buildings only the porter&#x27;s lodge off Knights Hill now remains, its curving Dutch-gables, red brick with black diaperwork and mullioned windows echoing the design of the main 3-storey institution. The Arnold &amp; Jane Gabriel Home was built on the Wolfington Road frontage of the orphanage in 1910; it was converted into Julians primary school in 2012, which now features a colourful modern extension to the original building.

The charity that operated the orphanage in West Norwood retains an echo of its previous location in its current name Norwood.

==Transport==
The area is well served by public transport with these National Rail stations at each end of the main shopping area in Norwood Road, providing the services shown to central London and beyond: 
* West Norwood – services to Victoria, Clapham Junction and London Bridge.
* Tulse Hill – services to London Bridge, London Blackfriars, City Thameslink, Farringdon, Luton Airport, Kings Cross, St Pancras and St Albans.
Trains also run from both these stations to a variety of destinations further south of the centre of London.

Other nearby railway stations are:
* Gipsy Hill
* Herne Hill
* West Dulwich

The tube stations closest to West Norwood are at Brixton and Balham, both of which can be reached by bus and, in the case of Balham, also by train.

Eight daytime bus routes and two night-time routes serve the area. West Norwood bus garage is located at Ernest Avenue.

The South Circular (A205) passes close by at Tulse Hill and Streatham High Road (A23) is about one mile to the west of the centre of West Norwood.

==Education==
The primary and secondary schools listed below are in West Norwood.

===Primary===
* Crown Lane primary school, Crown Lane, SW16 3HX
* Elm Wood Primary School, Carnac Street, SE27 9RR

There are a large number of other publicly funded and also private schools within a short distance of West Norwood.

==Landmarks==
These include:
* South London Theatre Centre. This building was constructed in 1881 as West Norwood&#x27;s first fire station and has a prominent watch tower. It was subsequently used as a church hall by St Luke&#x27;s church before its present use commenced. In August 2014 the theatre was awarded a grant of £1.6m by the Heritage Lottery Fund to enable restoration work, which was completed in April 2018.
* West Norwood Health and Leisure Centre, a £14.2M million health and leisure centre opened in 2014. 
* St Luke&#x27;s Church. One of four Lambeth Waterloo churches, the others are St Matthew, St Mark, and St John. Architect Francis Octavius Bedford designed this church and St John&#x27;s in a similar neoclassical style. St Luke&#x27;s was built between 1822 and 1825, and was reordered by G E Street in 1870–1872. Unusually for a church it is oriented north–south instead of east–west. This is due to a requirement when Lambeth Manor was enclosed that no building in the area that included the site should be erected within 100 feet of an existing building without the permission of the owner of the other building. An objection from the owner of the Horn&#x27;s Tavern meant St Luke&#x27;s had to be built in a north–south orientation to avoid falling within 100 feet of the tavern. The lower part of the churchyard at St Luke&#x27;s has been laid out as gardens and are used as one of the venues of the West Norwood Feast.
* West Norwood Library &amp; Nettlefold Hall, Norwood High Street. Princess Margaret opened the building in April 1969. The complex is now the West Norwood Picturehouse and library.
* West Norwood Cemetery, one of London&#x27;s Magnificent Seven Victorian burial places, with 66 listed structures, many in the Gothic style. Opened 1837.
* The Old Library. In 2004 this has been a cafe and venue for local meetings, activities, exhibitions and events. The building opened on 21 July 1888 as the first public library in Lambeth and was designed by Sidney Smith, architect of Tate Britain and several other Lambeth libraries, using red brick, terracotta and Ham Hill stone, with a balcony above the entrance loggia. It was commissioned by Sir Henry Tate on land donated by Frederick Nettlefold: both of these local philanthropists are buried in West Norwood Cemetery.
* Mrs Woodford Fawcett Fountain – on a traffic island in front of St Luke&#x27;s Church, where Norwood Road splits into Norwood High Street and Knights Hill. Mrs Fawcett was a local temperance campaigner and is buried in West Norwood Cemetery whose entrance faces the fountain.

==Churches==
During recent years, the number and variety of churches has increased, reflecting the diverse origins of many new residents. The following congregations meet in buildings that are readily identified as places of worship:
* All Nations Christian Centre, 15 York Hill, SE27 0BU

<text>Åfjord is a municipality in Trøndelag county, Norway. It is part of the Fosen region. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Årnes. Other villages in the municipality include Revsnes, Roan, Bessaker, Harsvika, and By. Åfjord is located on the northwestern side of the Fosen peninsula, northwest of the city of Trondheim.

The municipality is the 74th largest by area out of the 357 municipalities in Norway. Åfjord is the 197th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 4,339. The municipality&#x27;s population density is and its population has increased by 2.6% over the previous 10-year period.

==General information==

The municipality of &quot;Aafjord&quot; was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). On 26 March 1870, a royal resolution moved a small, unpopulated part to Aafjord Municipality to the neighboring Bjugn Municipality. On 1 January 1896, the southwestern coastal area of Aafjord Municipality (population: 1,529) was separated to form the new Jøssund Municipality. This left Aafjord Municipality with 2,419 residents. On the same date, the name of &quot;Aafjord Municipality&quot; was changed to just &quot;Aa Municipality&quot;. The spelling was later changed to &quot;Å Municipality&quot;. On 13 July 1934, the name of the municipality was changed from &quot;Å&quot; to &quot;Åfjord Municipality&quot;. After that, the administrative centre in the municipality was referred to as &quot;Å&quot; or &quot;Å i Åfjord&quot;.

During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the neighboring Stoksund Municipality (population: 2,643) and Åfjord Municipality (population: 1,515) were merged to form a new, larger Åfjord Municipality. On 1 November 1980, the postal service changed the name of the municipal center from &quot;Å i Åfjord&quot; to &quot;Årnes&quot;.

On 1 January 2018, the municipality switched from the old Sør-Trøndelag county to the new Trøndelag county.

On 1 January 2020, the neighboring Roan Municipality was merged into Åfjord Municipality. The new municipality adopted the coat of arms of the old Roan Municipality.

===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old &quot;Aa&quot; farm () since the first Åfjord Church was built there. The local fjord (Åfjorden) is also named after this farm. The first element of the current name is the plural form of which means &quot;river&quot;, probably since there are two rivers, the Norddalselva and Stordalselva, that run together just south of the farm. The last element of the current name is which means &quot;fjord&quot;.

The spelling of the name has varied over the years. Historically, the name of the municipality was spelled &quot;Aafjorden&quot;. On 23 March 1895, a royal resolution approved the division of the municipality effective 1 January 1896. On that date, the southwestern part became the new Jøssund Municipality and the remaining portion of Aafjorden Municipality would be renamed &quot;Aa&quot; (leaving off the &quot;fjord&quot; part of the old name). On 21 December 1917, a royal resolution enacted the 1917 Norwegian language reforms. Prior to this change, the name was spelled &quot;Aa&quot; with the digraph &quot;Aa&quot;, and after this reform, the name was spelled &quot;Å&quot;, simply using the letter Å instead. On 13 July 1934, a royal resolution changed the spelling of the name of the municipality to &quot;Åfjord&quot;.

===Coat of arms===
The current coat of arms was approved for use starting on 1 January 2020 after a municipal merger with Åfjord Municipality and Roan Municipality. These arms had previously been used by Roan from 1987 until 2020. The official blazon is &quot;Azure, three terns volant argent&quot; (). This means the arms have a blue field (background) and the charge is a group of three flying terns. The bird design has a tincture of argent which means it is commonly colored white, but if it is made out of metal, then silver is used. Terns, a very watchful and energetic bird, are intended to symbolize the local inhabitants and the coast with the vast bird life in the area. The arms were initially designed by Solfrid Krogfjord with the final design by Einar H. Skjervold. The municipal flag has the same design as the coat of arms. 

The previous coat of arms was granted on 18 April 1997 until 1 January 2020 when the municipality was enlarged and the arms were changed. The official blazon is &quot;Azure, two boats argent issuant from sinister&quot; (). This means the arms have a blue field (background) and the charge is two boats coming out of the right side of the shield. The boats have a tincture of argent which means they are commonly colored white, but if the arms are made out of metal, then silver is used. The arms show two stems of a boat to represent the special boats that are built in the municipality. These boats had a long, shallow keel and straight masts. The arms were designed by Einar H. Skjervold. The municipal flag had the same design as the coat of arms.

===Churches===
The Church of Norway has three parishes () within Åfjord Municipality. It is part of the Fosen prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Nidaros.

==History==

There are archeological findings on many sites across the municipality. At Dragseid. archaeologists have located grave mounds. It is said that the wooden boats were dragged over the thin Dragseid peninsula to shorten the journey and to avoid risking them in bad weather. Up to the Middle Ages the Fosen peninsula was included as a part of the district of Nordmøre, immediately to the south.

Prior to 1950, there were no roads leading into and out of the municipality. In 1950, the road to the neighboring Bjugn Municipality to the south was finally finished. In 1955, the road to Stoksund Municipality in the northern part of the municipality was finished.

An old type of wooden boat, the Åfjord boat, comes from this area. The boat is a direct descendant form the old Norse Viking boats. It is still being produced, although in very small numbers. The boat is rounded at both ends. It is known to be a good coastal sailer. Different sizes exist. From the small &quot;faering&quot; to the largest of them all, the &quot;fembøring&quot;.

==Government==
Åfjord Municipality is responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, welfare and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads and utilities. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor is indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council.

There is an increasing amount of weekend houses and recreational cabins in the area. Åfjord has two big islands; Stokkøya (380 inhabitants) and Linesøya (80 inhabitants). Stokkøya is connected with the mainland through a bridge Stokkøy Bridge. The Linesøy Bridge connects the islands of Stokkøya and Linesøya.

<text>Metathesis ( ; from Greek , from &quot;to put in a different order&quot;; Latin: &quot;transpositio&quot;) is the transposition of sounds or syllables in a word or of words in a sentence. Most commonly, it refers to the interchange of two or more contiguous segments or syllables, known as adjacent metathesis or local metathesis:

* &quot;anemone &gt; &quot;**anenome (onset consonants of adjacent syllables)
* &quot;cavalry&quot; &gt; &quot;**calvary&quot; (codas of adjacent syllables)

Metathesis may also involve interchanging non-contiguous sounds, known as nonadjacent metathesis, long-distance metathesis, or hyperthesis, as shown in these examples of metathesis sound change from Latin to Spanish:

* Latin &gt; Spanish &quot;word&quot;
* Latin &gt; Spanish &quot;miracle&quot;
* Latin &gt; Spanish &quot;danger, peril&quot;
* Latin &gt; Spanish &quot;crocodile&quot; 
Many languages have words that show this phenomenon, and some even use it as a regular part of their grammar, such as Hebrew and Fur. The process of metathesis has altered the shape of many familiar words in English as well.

The original form before metathesis may be deduced from older forms of words in the language&#x27;s lexicon or, if no forms are preserved, from phonological reconstruction. In some cases it is not possible to settle with certainty on the original version.

==Rhetorical metathesis==
Dionysius of Halicarnassus was a historian and scholar in rhetoric living in 1st century BC Greece. He analysed classical texts and applied several revisions to make them sound more eloquent. One of the methods he used was re-writing documents on a mainly grammatical level: changing word and sentence orders would make texts more fluent and &quot;natural&quot;, he suggested. He called this way of re-writing &quot;metathesis&quot;.

==Examples==
===American Sign Language===
In ASL, several signs which have a pre-specified initial and final location in reference to the body of the person signing (such as the signs RESTAURANT, PARENT, or TWINS) can have the order of these two locations reversed in contexts which seem to be purely phonological. While not possible with all signs, this does happen with quite a few. For example, the sign DEAF, prototypically made with the &quot;1&quot; handshape making contact first with the cheek and then moving to contact the jaw (as in the sentence FATHER DEAF), can have these locations reversed if the preceding sign, when part of the same constituent, has a final location more proximal to the jaw (as in the sentence MOTHER DEAF). Both forms of the sign DEAF are acceptable to native signers. A proposed prerequisite for metathesis to apply in ASL is that both signs must be within the same region on the body. Constraints on the applications of metathesis in ASL has led to discussions that the phonology breaks down the body into regions distinct from settings.

===Amharic===
Amharic has a few minor patterns of metathesis, as shown by Wolf Leslau. For example, &quot;matches&quot; is sometimes pronounced as , &quot;nanny&quot; is sometimes pronounced as . The word &quot;Monday&quot; is , which is the base for &quot;Tuesday&quot; , which is often metathesized as . All of these examples show a pair of consonants reversed so that the stop begins the next syllable.

===Azerbaijani===
Metathesis among neighbouring consonants happens very commonly in Azerbaijani:
* &gt; &quot;bridge&quot;
* &gt; &quot;leaf&quot;
* &gt; &quot;soil&quot;
* &gt; &quot;smoke&quot;

===Danish===
Some common nonstandard pronunciations of Danish words employ metathesis:

* &gt; &quot;pictures&quot;
* &gt; &quot;through&quot;

But metathesis has also historically changed some words:

* &gt; &quot; (Christian) cross&quot;

===Egyptian Arabic===
A common example of metathesis in Egyptian Arabic is when the order of the word&#x27;s root consonants has changed.

* Classical Arabic &gt; Egyptian Arabic &quot;gōz&quot; &quot;husband&quot;
* Classical Arabic &gt; &quot;ma‘la’a&quot; &quot;spoon&quot;
* Persian &quot;zanjabil&quot; &gt; Egyptian Arabic &quot;ganzabīl&quot; ~ &quot;zanzabīl&quot; &quot;ginger&quot;

The following examples of metathesis have been identified in Egyptian Arabic texts, but are not necessarily more common than their etymological spellings:

* &gt; &quot;God curse!&quot;
* &gt; &quot;theatre troupe&quot;
* &gt; &quot;philosophy&quot;
The following loanwords are also sometimes found with metathesis:
* &gt; &quot;monologue&quot;
* &gt; &quot;hospital&quot;
* &gt; &quot;penalty&quot; (in football)
The likely cause for metathesis in the word &quot;hospital&quot; is that the result resembles a common word pattern familiar to Arabic speakers (namely a Form X verbal noun).

Perhaps the clearest example of metathesis in Egyptian Arabic is the modern name of the city of Alexandria: ()&quot;Iskandariya&quot; (). In addition to the metathesis of &quot;x&quot; /ks/ to /sk/, the initial &quot;Al&quot; of &quot;Alexandria&quot; has been reanalyzed as the Arabic definite article.

===English===
Metathesis is responsible for some common speech errors, such as children acquiring &quot;spaghetti&quot; as &quot;pasketti&quot;. The word &quot;ask&quot; has the nonstandard variant &quot;ax&quot; pronounced ; the spelling &quot;ask&quot; is found in Shakespeare and in the King James Bible and &quot;ax&quot; in Chaucer, Caxton, and the Coverdale Bible. The word &quot;ask&quot; derives from Proto-Germanic &quot;*aiskōną&quot;.

Some other frequent English pronunciations that display metathesis are:

* &quot;nuclear&quot; &gt; &quot;nucular&quot; (re-analysed as &quot;nuke&quot; + &quot;&quot; suffix in &quot;molecular, binocular&quot;)
* prescription&quot; &gt; perscription&quot; 
* &quot;introduce&quot; &gt; &quot;interduce&quot; 
* &quot;asterisk &gt; &quot;asterix 
* &quot;comfortable&quot; &gt; &quot;comfturble&quot; 
* &quot;cavalry&quot; &gt; &quot;calvary&quot; 
* &quot;iron&quot; &gt; &quot;iorn&quot; 
* &quot;foliage&quot; &gt; &quot;foilage&quot; 
* &quot;aforementioned&quot; &gt; &quot;afrementioned&quot; 
* &quot;pretty&quot; &gt; &quot;purty&quot; 
* &quot;jewelry&quot; &gt; &quot;jewlery&quot; 
* &quot;animal&quot; &gt; &quot;aminal&quot; 

The process has shaped many English words historically. &quot;Bird&quot; and &quot;horse&quot; came from Old English and ; and were also written and .

The Old English &quot;bright&quot; underwent metathesis to , which became Modern English .

The Old English &quot;three&quot; formed &quot;thrid&quot; and &quot;þrēotene&quot; &quot;thriteen&quot;. These underwent metathesis to forms which became Modern English and .

The Old English verb &quot;to work&quot; had the passive participle &quot;worked&quot;. This underwent metathesis to , which became Modern English .

The Old English &quot;hole&quot; underwent metathesis to &quot;þryl&quot;. This gave rise to a verb &quot;pierce&quot;, which became Modern English , and formed the compound &quot;nose-hole&quot; which became Modern English (May have occurred in the early Middle English Period: &quot;nosþyrlu&quot; ( 1050); &quot;nos-thirlys&quot; ( 1500). In 1565 &quot;nosthrille&quot; appears; &quot;thirl&quot;/&quot;thurl&quot; survived even longer, until 1878).

Metathesis is also a common feature of the West Country dialects.

===Kurdish===
In the Kurdish language, there are many examples of metathesis, as both forms are used until now, the pre-inverted form and the post-inverted form (depending on the regions).

Example:(Befr-Berf)this word means snow. The formula (Berf) was used in Afrin and many Kurdish regions in Syria, and the formula (Befr) was used in many Kurdish regions of Turkey.

===Finnish===
In western dialects of Finnish, historical stem-final /h/ has been subject to metathesis (it is lost in standard Finnish). That leads to variant word forms:

* &quot;stallion&quot; (standard * &gt; )
* &quot;smoke&quot; (standard * &gt; )
* &quot;lie&quot; (standard * &gt; )
* &quot;boat&quot; (standard * &gt; )

Some words have been standardized in the metathetized form:

* * &gt; &quot;sorrow&quot;
* * &gt; &quot;family&quot;
* * &gt; &quot;hero&quot;
* * &gt; &quot;untrue&quot;

Sporadic examples include the word &quot;green&quot;, which derives from older , and the vernacular change of the word &quot;jovial&quot; to (also a separate word meaning &quot;bristly&quot;).

===French===
Etymological metathesis occurs in the following French words:

* from popular Latin &quot;berbex&quot; meaning &quot;sheep&quot; (early 12th century).
* from popular Latin &quot;formaticus&quot;, meaning &quot;formed in a mold&quot; (1135).
* (1654) from French &quot;mousquitte&quot; (1603) by metathesis. From Spanish &quot;mosquito&quot; (&quot;little fly&quot;).

Deliberate metathesis also occurs extensively in the informal French pattern of speech called &quot;verlan&quot; (itself an example: &lt; , meaning &quot;the reverse&quot; or &quot;the inverse&quot;). In verlan new words are created from existing words by reversing the order of syllables. Verlanization is applied mostly to two-syllable words and the new words that are created are typically considerably less formal than the originals, and/or take on a slightly different meaning. The process often involves considerably more changes than simple metathesis of two phonemes but this forms the basis for verlan as a linguistic phenomenon. Some of these words have become part of standard French.

A few well known examples are:
* &#x27; &gt; &#x27;
* &#x27; &gt; &#x27;

Some Verlan words are metathesized more than once:

===Greek===
In Greek, the present stem often consists of the root with a suffix of &quot;y&quot; (˰ in Greek). If the root ends in the vowel &quot;a&quot; or &quot;o&quot;, and the consonant &quot;n&quot; or &quot;r&quot;, the &quot;y&quot; exchanges position with the consonant and is written &quot;i&quot;:

* &quot;*cháryō&quot; &gt; &quot;chaírō&quot; &quot;I am glad&quot; — &quot;echárē&quot; &quot;he was glad&quot;
* &quot;*phányō&quot; &gt; &quot;phaínō&quot; &quot;I reveal&quot; — &quot;ephánē&quot; &quot;he appeared&quot;

For metathesis of vowel length, which occurs frequently in Attic and Ionic Greek, see quantitative metathesis.

===Hebrew===
In Hebrew the verb conjugation (&quot;binyan&quot;) &quot;hitpaēl&quot; () undergoes metathesis if the first consonant of the root is an alveolar or postalveolar fricative. Namely, the pattern &quot;hiṯ1a22ē3&quot; (where the numbers signify the root consonants) becomes &quot;hi1ta22ē3&quot;. Examples:

* No metathesis: root &quot;lbš&quot; = &quot;hitlabbēš&quot; (&quot;he got dressed&quot;).
* Voiceless alveolar fricative: root &quot;skl&quot; = &quot;histakkēl&quot; (&quot;he looked [at something]&quot;).
* Voiceless postalveolar fricative: root &quot;šdl&quot; = &quot;hištaddēl&quot; (&quot;he made an effort&quot;).
* Voiced alveolar fricative: root &quot;zqn&quot; = &quot;hizdaqqēn&quot; (&quot;he grew old&quot;); with assimilation of the T of the conjugation.
* Voiceless alveolar affricate: root &quot;t͡slm&quot; = &quot;hit͡stallēm&quot; (&quot;he had a photograph of him taken&quot;); with assimilation (no longer audible) of the T of the conjugation.

Hebrew also features isolated historical examples of metathesis. For example, the words &quot;keves&quot; and &quot;kesev&quot; (meaning &quot;lamb&quot;) both appear in the Torah.

=== Hindustani ===
Like many other natural languages Urdu and Hindi also have metathesis like in this diachronic example:

Sanskrit () &quot;janma&quot; &gt; Urdu and Hindi &quot;janam&quot; &quot;Birth&quot;

More examples
* Portuguese became Urdu () and Hindi (&quot;girjā&quot;), meaning &quot;church&quot;

===Hungarian===
In case of a narrow range of Hungarian nouns, metathesis of a h sound and a liquid consonant occurs in nominative case, but the original form is preserved in accusative and other suffixed forms:

* &quot;chalice&quot;, but (accusative), (possessive), (plural)
* &quot;burden&quot;, but (acc.), (poss.), (pl.)
* &quot;flake&quot;, but (acc.), (poss.), (pl.)

The other instances are [intestinal] villus/fluff/fuzz/nap vs. &quot;bolyhok&quot;, vs. &quot;molyhos&quot; down/pubescence [on plants], and the obsolete animal&#x27;s fetus (cf. &quot;vemhes&quot; &quot;pregnant [animal]&quot;). The first of them is often used in the regular form ().

===Japanese===
* for (), meaning &quot;atmosphere&quot; or &quot;mood&quot;
* Small children commonly refer to &quot;kusuri&quot; &quot;medicine&quot; as &quot;sukuri&quot;.
* &quot;arata&quot;- &quot;new&quot; contrasts with &quot;atarashii&quot; &quot;new&quot;.

The following are examples of argot used in the entertainment industry.

* for (), the former meaning &quot;content [of news article]&quot;, &quot;food ingredient&quot;, &quot;material (for joke or artwork)&quot;, the latter &quot;seed&quot;, &quot;species&quot;,&quot;source&quot;
* for 
* The word for &quot;sorry&quot;, &quot;gomen&quot;, is sometimes inverted to &quot;mengo&quot; (backslang).

===Lakota===
* The words and are dialectal variants of the same word, meaning &quot;abalone&quot; or &quot;porcelain&quot;.
* The word , meaning &quot;rib,&quot; has its origins in &quot;side of the body&quot; and &quot;bone&quot;, but is more commonly metathesized as .

===Malay (including Malaysian and Indonesian variants)===

Metathesis from earlier protoform, though not so prevalent in Malay, can still be seen, as in the following:

: Proto-Malayo-Polynesian: &quot;*uʀsa&quot; &gt; &quot;deer&quot;
: Proto-Malayo-Polynesian: &quot;*qudip&quot; &gt; &quot;alive&quot;
: Proto-Malayo-Polynesian: &quot;*dilaq&quot; &gt; &quot;tongue&quot;
: Proto-Malayo-Polynesian: &quot;*laqia&quot; &gt; &quot;ginger&quot;&quot;

Loanwords can also be products of metathesis. The word &quot;tembikai&quot; &quot;watermelon&quot; is a metathesis of &quot;mendikai&quot; borrowed from .

===Navajo===
In Navajo, verbs have (often multiple) morphemes prefixed onto the verb stem. These prefixes are added to the verb stem in a set order in a prefix positional template. Although prefixes are generally found in a specific position, some prefixes change order by the process of metathesis.

For example, prefix (3i object pronoun) usually occurs before , as in

: &quot;I&#x27;m starting to drive some kind of wheeled vehicle along&quot; [ &lt; + + + + ].

However, when occurs with the prefixes and , the metathesizes with , leading to an order of + + , as in

: &quot;I&#x27;m in the act of driving some vehicle [into something] and getting stuck&quot; [ &lt; &lt; + + + + + ]

instead of the expected * () ( is reduced to ).

===Prakrit===
Prakrit lost many of its consonant clusters from Sanskrit to aspirates due to metathesis. Clusters with /h/ also became reversed.
* Sanskrit: → &quot;hahta&quot; &gt; &quot;hatha&quot; → &quot;hand&quot;
* Sanskrit: &gt; &quot;sign&quot;
* Sanskrit: &gt; &quot;Brahmin&quot;

===Proto-Indo-European===
Metathesis has been used to explain the development of thorn clusters in Proto-Indo-European (PIE). It is hypothesised in the non-Anatolian and non-Tocharian branch, a coronal followed by a dorsal *TK first assimilated to *TsK, and thereafter underwent metathesis to *KTs, so *TK &gt; *TsK &gt; *KTs.

: PIE &quot;&quot; &quot;bear&quot; (cf. Hittite &#x27;) &gt; &#x27; &gt; &quot;&quot; (cf. Sanskrit , Ancient Greek )
: PIE &quot;&quot; &quot;earth&quot; (cf. Hittite &#x27;) → zero-grade &#x27; &gt; &#x27; &gt; &#x27; (cf. Sanskrit , Ancient Greek )

===Punjabi===
Punjabi sometimes corrupts loanwords via metathesis:
* Arabic: &gt; &quot;matlab &gt; &quot;matbal&quot; &quot;meaning&quot;

Some dialectal words in Punjabi also form due to metathesis, such as in Malwai:
* &gt; &quot;thauḍā&quot;, realised as &quot;your&quot;
* &gt; &quot;thaunū̃&quot;, realised as &quot;thonū̃&quot; &quot;to ye&quot;

===Romanian===
Similar to the French &quot;verlan&quot; is the Totoiana, a speech form spoken in the village of Totoi in Romania. It consists in the inversion of syllables of Romanian words in a way that results unintelligible for other Romanian speakers. Its origins or original purpose are unknown. Its current use is recreative.

===Rotuman===
The Rotuman language of Rotuman Island (a part of Fiji) uses metathesis as a part of normal grammatical structure by inverting the ultimate vowel with the immediately preceding consonant.

===Slavic languages===
Metathesis of liquid consonants is an important historical change during the development of the Slavic languages: a syllable-final liquid (*&quot;r&quot; or *&quot;l&quot;), always preceded by a short vowel (*&quot;e&quot; or *&quot;o&quot;), metathesized to become syllable-initial. However, the exact outcome of the change varies across the different Slavic languages.

A number of Proto-Indo-European roots indicate metathesis in Slavic forms when compared with other Indo-European languages:

Metathesis also occurred sporadically in individual Slavic languages:

* Ukrainian (&quot;vedmíd&quot;) &lt; Proto-Slavic 

* Slovak , Ukrainian (&quot;imlá&quot;) &lt; Proto-Slavic 

* Serbo-Croatian &lt; &lt; Proto-Slavic 

===Scots Gaelic===
Dùn Breatann, the Gaelic name for Dumbarton meaning &#x27;Fort of the Britons&#x27; sees &#x27;Breatann&#x27; morphing into &#x27;-barton&#x27; in English.

===Spanish===
Old Spanish showed occasional metathesis when phonemes not conforming to the usual euphonic constraints were joined. This happened, for example, when a clitic pronoun was attached to a verb ending: it is attested that forms like &quot;leave [plural] him&quot; were often metathesized to (the phoneme cluster does not occur elsewhere in Spanish). The Spanish name for Algeria (&quot;Argelia&quot;) is likely a metathesis of the Arabic name for the territory ().

Lunfardo, an argot of Spanish from Buenos Aires, is fond of vesre, metathesis of syllables. The word itself is an example:

* &#x27; &gt; &#x27; &quot;back, backwards&quot;

Gacería, an argot of Castile, incorporates metathesized words:

Some frequently heard pronunciations in Spanish display metathesis:
* &gt; 

=== Straits Salish languages ===
In the Salishan languages Northern Straits and Klallam, metathesis is used as a grammatical device to indicate &quot;actual&quot; aspect. The actual aspect is most often translated into English as a &quot;be ... -ing&quot; progressive. The actual aspect is derived from the &quot;nonactual&quot; verb form by a CV → VC metathetic process (i.e., consonant metathesizes with vowel).
Examples from the Saanich (SENĆOŦEN) dialect of Northern Straits:

See Montler (1986, 1989,2015) and Thompson &amp; Thompson (1969) for more information.

=== Swahili ===
In Swahili, some foreign words can undergo metathesis during their importation. For instance, &quot;American&quot; becomes &quot;mmarekani&quot;.

===Telugu===
From a comparative study of Dravidian vocabularies, one can observe that the retroflex consonants () and the liquids of the alveolar series () do not occur initially in common Dravidian etyma, but Telugu has words with these consonants at the initial position. It was shown that the etyma underwent a metathesis in Telugu, when the root word originally consisted of an initial vowel followed by one of the above consonants. When this pattern is followed by a consonantal derivative, metathesis has occurred in the phonemes of the root-syllable with the doubling of the suffix consonant (if it had been single); when a vowel derivative follows, metathesis has occurred in the phonemes of the root syllable attended by a contraction of the vowels of root and (derivative) suffix syllables. These statements and the resulting sequences of vowel contraction may be summed up as follows:

Type 1: V1C1-C² &gt; C1V1-C²C²

Type 2: V1C1-V²- &gt; C1V1-

Examples:

* &quot;lē&quot; = &quot;lēta&quot; &quot;young, tender&quot; &lt; *eɭa
* &quot;rē&quot; = &quot;rēyi&quot; &quot;night&quot; &lt; *ira
* &quot;rōlu&quot; &quot;mortar&quot; &lt; oral &lt; *ural

===Turkish===
Two types of metathesis are observed in Turkish. The examples given are from Anatolian Turkish, though the closely related Azerbaijani language is better known for its metathesis:

* Close type:
** = &quot;bridge&quot;
** = &quot;ground&quot;
** = &quot;hedgehog&quot;
** = &quot;match&quot;
** = &quot;neighbour&quot;
** = &quot;nobody&quot;
** = &quot;flag&quot;
** = &quot;sour&quot;
** = &quot;alone&quot;
* Distant type:
** = &quot;&quot; &quot;bulgur&quot;
** = &quot;loan&quot;
** = &quot;&quot; &quot;curse&quot;

==In popular culture==
* Metathesis is described by the character Data in the episode &quot;Hollow Pursuits&quot; in the television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; after Captain Picard accidentally addresses Lieutenant Barclay as &quot;Mr. Broccoli&quot;.

<text>An evoked potential or evoked response is an electrical potential in a specific pattern recorded from a specific part of the nervous system, especially the brain, of a human or other animals following presentation of a stimulus such as a light flash or a pure tone. Different types of potentials result from stimuli of different modalities and types.
Evoked potential is distinct from spontaneous potentials as detected by electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), or other electrophysiologic recording method. Such potentials are useful for electrodiagnosis and monitoring that include detections of disease and drug-related sensory dysfunction and intraoperative monitoring of sensory pathway integrity.

Evoked potential amplitudes tend to be low, ranging from less than a microvolt to several microvolts, compared to tens of microvolts for EEG, millivolts for EMG, and often close to 20 millivolts for ECG. To resolve these low-amplitude potentials against the background of ongoing EEG, ECG, EMG, and other biological signals and ambient noise, signal averaging is usually required. The signal is time-locked to the stimulus and most of the noise occurs randomly, allowing the noise to be averaged out with averaging of repeated responses.

Signals can be recorded from cerebral cortex, brain stem, spinal cord, peripheral nerves and muscles. Usually the term &quot;evoked potential&quot; is reserved for responses involving either recording from, or stimulation of, central nervous system structures. Thus evoked compound motor action potentials (CMAP) or sensory nerve action potentials (SNAP) as used in nerve conduction studies (NCS) are generally not thought of as evoked potentials, though they do meet the above definition.

Evoked potential is different from event-related potential (ERP), although the terms are sometimes used synonymously, because ERP has higher latency, and is associated with higher cognitive processing. Evoked potentials are mainly classified by the type of stimulus: somatosensory, auditory, visual. But they could also be classified according to stimulus frequency, wave latencies, potential origin, location, and derivation.

==Steady-state evoked potential==
An evoked potential is the electrical response of the brain to a sensory stimulus. Regan constructed an analogue Fourier series analyzer to record harmonics of the evoked potential of flickering (sinusoidally modulated) light. Rather than integrating the sine and cosine products, Regan fed the signals to a two-pen recorder via lowpass filters. This allowed him to demonstrate that the brain attained a steady-state regime in which the amplitude and phase of the harmonics (frequency components) of the response were approximately constant over time. By analogy with the steady-state response of a resonant circuit that follows the initial transient response he defined an idealized steady-state evoked potential (SSEP) as a form of response to repetitive sensory stimulation in which the constituent frequency components of the response remain constant with time in both amplitude and phase. Although this definition implies a series of identical temporal waveforms, it is more helpful to define the SSEP in terms of the frequency components that are an alternative description of the time-domain waveform, because different frequency components can have quite different properties. For example, the properties of the high-frequency flicker SSEP (whose peak amplitude is near 40–50 Hz) correspond to the properties of the subsequently discovered magnocellular neurons in the retina of the macaque monkey, while the properties of the medium-frequency flicker SSEP ( whose amplitude peak is near 15–20 Hz) correspond to the properties of parvocellular neurons. Since a SSEP can be completely described in terms of the amplitude and phase of each frequency component it can be quantified more unequivocally than an averaged transient evoked potential.

It is sometimes said that SSEPs are elicited only by stimuli of high repetition frequency, but this is not generally correct. In principle, a sinusoidally modulated stimulus can elicit a SSEP even when its repetition frequency is low. Because of the high-frequency rolloff of the SSEP, high frequency stimulation can produce a near-sinusoidal SSEP waveform, but this is not germane to the definition of a SSEP.
By using zoom-FFT to record SSEPs at the theoretical limit of spectral resolution ΔF (where ΔF in Hz is the reciprocal of the recording duration in seconds) Regan and Regan discovered that the amplitude and phase variability of the SSEP can be sufficiently small that the bandwidth of the SSEP&#x27;s constituent frequency components can be at the theoretical limit of spectral resolution up to at least a 500-second recording duration (0.002 Hz in this case).
Repetitive sensory stimulation elicits a steady-state magnetic brain response that can be analysed in the same way as the SSEP.

===The &quot;simultaneous stimulation&quot; technique===
This technique allows several (e.g., four) SSEPs to be recorded simultaneously from any given location on the scalp. Different sites of stimulation or different stimuli can be tagged with slightly different frequencies that are virtually identical to the brain, but easily separated by Fourier series analyzers. For example, when two unpatterned lights are modulated at slightly different frequencies (F1 and F2) and superimposed, multiple nonlinear cross-modulation components of frequency (mF1 ± nF2) are created in the SSEP, where m and n are integers. These components allow nonlinear processing in the brain to be investigated. By frequency-tagging two superimposed gratings, spatial frequency and orientation tuning properties of the brain mechanisms that process spatial form can be isolated and studied. Stimuli of different sensory modalities can also be tagged. For example, a visual stimulus was flickered at Fv Hz and a simultaneously presented auditory tone was amplitude modulated at Fa Hz. The existence of a (2Fv + 2Fa) component in the evoked magnetic brain response demonstrated an audio-visual convergence area in the human brain, and the distribution of this response over the head allowed this brain area to be localized. More recently, frequency tagging has been extended from studies of sensory processing to studies of selective attention and of consciousness.

===The &quot;sweep&quot; technique===
The sweep technique is a hybrid frequency domain/time domain technique. A plot of, for example, response amplitude versus the check size of a stimulus checkerboard pattern plot can be obtained in 10 seconds, far faster than when time-domain averaging is used to record an evoked potential for each of several check sizes.
In the original demonstration of the technique the sine and cosine products were fed through lowpass filters (as when recording a SSEP ) while viewing a pattern of fine checks whose black and white squares exchanged place six times per second. Then the size of the squares was progressively increased so as to give a plot of evoked potential amplitude versus check size (hence &quot;sweep&quot;). Subsequent authors have implemented the sweep technique by using computer software to increment the spatial frequency of a grating in a series of small steps and to compute a time-domain average for each discrete spatial frequency.
A single sweep may be adequate or it may be necessary to average the graphs obtained in several sweeps with the averager triggered by the sweep cycle. Averaging 16 sweeps can improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the graph by a factor of four.
The sweep technique has proved useful in measuring rapidly adapting visual processes and also for recording from babies, where recording duration is necessarily short. Norcia and Tyler have used the technique to document the development of visual acuity and contrast sensitivity through the first years of life. They have emphasized that, in diagnosing abnormal visual development, the more precise the developmental norms, the more sharply can the abnormal be distinguished from the normal, and to that end have documented normal visual development in a large group of infants. For many years the sweep technique has been used in paediatric ophthalmology (electrodiagnosis) clinics worldwide.

===Evoked potential feedback===
This technique allows the SSEP to directly control the stimulus that elicits the SSEP without the conscious intervention of the experimental subject. For example, the running average of the SSEP can be arranged to increase the luminance of a checkerboard stimulus if the amplitude of the SSEP falls below some predetermined value, and to decrease luminance if it rises above this value. The amplitude of the SSEP then hovers about this predetermined value. Now the wavelength (colour) of the stimulus is progressively changed. The resulting plot of stimulus luminance versus wavelength is a plot of the spectral sensitivity of the visual system.

== Sensory evoked potentials ==
Sensory evoked potentials (SEP) are recorded from the central nervous system following stimulation of sense organs, for example, visual evoked potentials elicited by a flashing light or changing pattern on a monitor, auditory evoked potentials by a click or tone stimulus presented through earphones), or tactile or somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) elicited by tactile or electrical stimulation of a sensory or mixed nerve in the periphery. Sensory evoked potentials have been widely used in clinical diagnostic medicine since the 1970s, and also in intraoperative neurophysiology monitoring (IONM), also known as surgical neurophysiology.

There are three kinds of evoked potentials in widespread clinical use: auditory evoked potentials, usually recorded from the scalp but originating at brainstem level; visual evoked potentials, and somatosensory evoked potentials, which are elicited by electrical stimulation of peripheral nerve. Examples of SEP usage include:
* SSEP can be used to locate lesions such as peripheral nerve or spinal cord.
* VEP and BAEP can supplement neuroimaging as part of workups to diagnose diseases such as multiple sclerosis.
* Short latency EPs such as SSEP, VEP, and BAEP can be used to indicate prognosis for traumatic and anoxic brain injury. Early after anoxic brain injury, no response indicates mortality accurately. In traumatic brain injury, abnormal responses indicates failure to recover from coma. In both types of injury, normal responses may indicate good outcome. Moreover, recovery in responses often indicates clinical recovery.

Long and Allen were the first investigators to report the abnormal brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) in an alcoholic woman who recovered from acquired central hypoventilation syndrome. These investigators hypothesized that their patient&#x27;s brainstem was poisoned, but not destroyed, by her chronic alcoholism.

===Visual evoked potential===
Visual evoked potential (VEP) is an evoked potential elicited by presenting light flash or pattern stimulus which can be used to confirm damage to visual pathway
including retina, optic nerve, optic chiasm, optic radiations, and occipital cortex.
One application is in measuring infant&#x27;s visual acuity. Electrodes are placed on infant&#x27;s head over visual cortex and a gray field is presented alternately with a checkerboard or grating pattern. If the checker&#x27;s boxes or stripes are large enough to be detected, VEP is generated; otherwise, none is generated. It&#x27;s an objective way to measure infant&#x27;s visual acuity.

VEP can be sensitive to visual dysfunctions that may not be found with just physical examinations or MRI, even if it cannot indicate etiologies.
VEP may be abnormal in optic neuritis, optic neuropathy, demyelinating disease, multiple sclerosis, Friedreich’s ataxia, vitamin B12 deficiency, neurosyphilis, migraine, ischemic disease, tumor compressing the optic nerve, ocular hypertension, glaucoma, diabetes, toxic amblyopia, aluminum neurotoxicity, manganese intoxication, retrobulbar neuritis, and brain injury.
It can be used to examine infant&#x27;s visual impairment for abnormal visual pathways which may be due to delayed maturation.

The P100 component of VEP response, which is the positive peak with the delay about 100 ms, has a major clinical importance. The visual pathway dysfunction anterior to the optic chiasm maybe where VEPs are most useful. For example, patients with acute severe optic neuritis often lose the P100 response or have highly attenuated responses. Clinical recovery and visual improvement come with P100 restoration but with an abnormal increased latency that continues indefinitely, and hence, it maybe useful as an indicator of previous or subclinical optic neuritis.

In 1934, Adrian and Matthew noticed potential changes of the occipital EEG can be observed under stimulation of light. Ciganek developed the first nomenclature for occipital EEG components in 1961. During that same year, Hirsch and colleagues recorded a visual evoked potential (VEP) on the occipital lobe (externally and internally), and they discovered amplitudes recorded along the calcarine fissure were the largest. In 1965, Spehlmann used a checkerboard stimulation to describe human VEPs. An attempt to localize structures in the primary visual pathway was completed by Szikla and colleagues. Halliday and colleagues completed the first clinical investigations using VEP by recording delayed VEPs in a patient with retrobulbar neuritis in 1972. A wide variety of extensive research to improve procedures and theories has been conducted from the 1970s to today and the method has also been described in animals.

====VEP Stimuli====

The diffuse-light flash stimulus is rarely used nowadays due to the high variability within and across subjects. However, it is beneficial to use this type of stimulus when testing infants, animals or individuals with poor visual acuity. The checkerboard and grating patterns use light and dark squares and stripes, respectively. These squares and stripes are equal in size and are presented, one image at a time, via a computer screen.

====VEP Electrode Placement====

Electrode placement is extremely important to elicit a good VEP response free of artifact. In a typical (one channel) setup, one electrode is placed 2.5 cm above the inion and a reference electrode is placed at Fz. For a more detailed response, two additional electrodes can be placed 2.5  cm to the right and left of Oz.

====VEP Waves====

The VEP nomenclature is determined by using capital letters stating whether the peak is positive (P) or negative (N) followed by a number which indicates the average peak latency for that particular wave. For example, P100 is a wave with a positive peak at approximately 100 ms following stimulus onset. The average amplitude for VEP waves usually falls between 5 and 20 microvolts.

Normal values are depending on used stimulation hardware (flash stimulus vs. cathode-ray tube or liquid crystal display, checkerboard field size, etc.).

====Types of VEP====

Some specific VEPs are:
* Monocular pattern reversal (most common)
* Sweep visual evoked potential
* Binocular visual evoked potential
* Chromatic visual evoked potential
* Hemi-field visual evoked potential
* Flash visual evoked potential
* LED Goggle visual evoked potential
* Motion visual evoked potential
* Multifocal visual evoked potential
* Multi-channel visual evoked potential
* Multi-frequency visual evoked potential
* Stereo-elicited visual evoked potential
* Steady state visually evoked potential

===Auditory evoked potential===
Auditory evoked potentials (AEP) can be used to trace the signal generated by a sound through the ascending auditory pathway. The evoked potential is generated in the cochlea, goes through the cochlear nerve, through the cochlear nucleus, superior olivary complex, lateral lemniscus, to the inferior colliculus in the midbrain, on to the medial geniculate body, and finally to the cortex.

Auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) are a subclass of event-related potentials (ERPs). ERPs are brain responses that are time-locked to some &quot;event&quot;, such as a sensory stimulus, a mental event (such as recognition of a target stimulus), or the omission of a stimulus. For AEPs, the &quot;event&quot; is a sound. AEPs (and ERPs) are very small electrical voltage potentials originating from the brain recorded from the scalp in response to an auditory stimulus, such as different tones, speech sounds, etc.

Brainstem auditory evoked potentials are small AEPs that are recorded in response to an auditory stimulus from electrodes placed on the scalp.

AEPs serve for assessment of the functioning of the auditory system and neuroplasticity.
They can be used to diagnose learning disabilities in children, aiding in the development of tailored educational programs for those with hearing and or cognition problems.

===Somatosensory evoked potential===

Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) are EP recorded from the brain or spinal cord when stimulating peripheral nerve repeatedly. SSEPs are used in neuromonitoring to assess the function of a patient&#x27;s spinal cord during surgery. They are recorded by stimulating peripheral nerves, most commonly the tibial nerve, median nerve or ulnar nerve, typically with an electrical stimulus. The response is then recorded from the patient&#x27;s scalp.

Although stimuli such as touch, vibration, and pain can be used for SSEP, electrical stimuli are most common because of ease and reliability.
SSEP can be used for prognosis in patients with severe traumatic head injury.
Because SSEP with latency less than 50 ms is relatively independent of consciousness, if used early in comatose patient, it can predict outcome reliably and efficiently.
For example, comatose patients with no responses bilaterally has 95% chance of not recovering from coma.
But care should be taken analyzing the result. For example, increased sedation and other CNS injuries such as the spinal cord can affect SEP.

Because of the low amplitude of the signal once it reaches the patient&#x27;s scalp and the relatively high amount of electrical noise caused by background EEG, scalp muscle EMG or electrical devices in the room, the signal must be averaged. The use of averaging improves the signal-to-noise ratio. Typically, in the operating room, over 100 and up to 1,000 averages must be used to adequately resolve the evoked potential.

The two most looked at aspects of an SSEP are the amplitude and latency of the peaks. The most predominant peaks have been studied and named in labs. Each peak is given a letter and a number in its name. For example, N20 refers to a negative peak (N) at 20ms. This peak is recorded from the cortex when the median nerve is stimulated. It most likely corresponds to the signal reaching the somatosensory cortex. When used in intraoperative monitoring, the latency and amplitude of the peak relative to the patient&#x27;s post-intubation baseline is a crucial piece of information. Dramatic increases in latency or decreases in amplitude are indicators of neurological dysfunction.

During surgery, the large amounts of anesthetic gases used can affect the amplitude and latencies of SSEPs. Any of the halogenated agents or nitrous oxide will increase latencies and decrease amplitudes of responses, sometimes to the point where a response can no longer be detected. For this reason, an anesthetic utilizing less halogenated agent and more intravenous hypnotic and narcotic is typically used.

====Clinical Uses====

SEP findings do not by themselves lead to a specific diagnosis, and organic diseases cannot necessarily be excluded with normal SEP findings. Findings must be interpreted in the context of the patient’s clinical presentation. Evaluating the peripheral responses with SEPs could contribute to the diagnosis of peripheral nerve damage.

Furthermore, SEPs could be abnormal in different pathologies such as multiple sclerosis (MS), hereditary spinocerebellar degenerations, hereditary spastic paraplegia, AIDS and vitamin B12 or vitamin E deficiency. In patients with MS, evoked potential findings often complement findings on MRI.

In the acute stage after a traumatic spinal injury or brain trauma, the absence of SEP responses do not correlate with prognosis. However, an early return to normal or preserved cortical responses in the subacute stage correlate with a positive outcome.

SEPs can be helpful to evaluate subcortical and cortical function in comatose patients and are less sensitive to sedative drugs than EEG. SEP´s and BAEP´s together are the best tools to assist in the confirmation of brain death in comatose patients

====Clinical consideration in children====

As in the adult, SEP findings in combination with the clinical assessment and EEG findings can contribute to the determination of prognosis in comatose children. In high risk newborns, tracking SEP findings over time can be helpful for outcome prognostication. Several neurodegenerative disorders have abnormal findings in spinal and cortical SEP components. Moreover, compressive lesions on the spine (e.g. Arnold-Chiari malformation or mucopolysaccharidosis) are associated with abnormal SEPs, which may precede abnormalities on MRI.

====Laser evoked potential====

Conventional SSEPs monitor the functioning of the part of the somatosensory system involved in sensations such as touch and vibration. The part of the somatosensory system that transmits pain and temperature signals is monitored using laser evoked potentials (LEP). LEPs are evoked by applying finely focused, rapidly rising heat to bare skin using a laser. In the central nervous system they can detect damage to the spinothalamic tract, lateral brain stem, and fibers carrying pain and temperature signals from the thalamus to the cortex. In the peripheral nervous system pain and heat signals are carried along thin (C and A delta) fibers to the spinal cord, and LEPs can be used to determine whether a neuropathy is located in these small fibers as opposed to larger (touch, vibration) fibers.

== Motor evoked potentials ==
Motor evoked potentials (MEP) are recorded from muscles following direct stimulation of exposed motor cortex, or transcranial stimulation of motor cortex, either magnetic or electrical. Transcranial magnetic MEP (TCmMEP) potentially offer clinical diagnostic applications. Transcranial electrical MEP (TCeMEP) has been in widespread use for several years for intraoperative monitoring of pyramidal tract functional integrity.

During the 1990s, there were attempts to monitor &quot;motor evoked potentials&quot;, including &quot;neurogenic motor evoked potentials&quot; recorded from peripheral nerves, following direct electrical stimulation of the spinal cord. It has become clear that these &quot;motor&quot; potentials were almost entirely elicited by antidromic stimulation of sensory tracts—even when the recording was from muscles (antidromic sensory tract stimulation triggers myogenic responses through synapses at the root entry level). TCMEP, whether electrical or magnetic, is the most practical way to ensure pure motor responses, since stimulation of sensory cortex cannot result in descending impulses beyond the first synapse (synapses cannot be backfired).

TMS-induced MEPs have been used in many experiments in cognitive neuroscience. Because MEP amplitude is correlated with motor excitability, they offer a quantitative way to test the role of various types of intervention on the motor system (pharmacological, behavioral, lesion, etc.). TMS-induced MEPs may thus serve as an index of covert motor preparation or facilitation, e.g., induced by the mirror neuron system when seeing someone&#x27;s else actions. In addition, MEPs are used as a reference to adjust the intensity of stimulation that needs to be delivered by TMS when targeting cortical regions whose response might not be as easily measurable, e.g., in the context of TMS-based therapy.

== Intraoperative monitoring ==
Somatosensory evoked potentials provide monitoring for the dorsal columns of the spinal cord. Sensory evoked potentials may also be used during surgeries which place brain structures at risk. They are effectively used to determine cortical ischemia during carotid endarterectomy surgeries and for mapping the sensory areas of the brain during brain surgery.

Electrical stimulation of the scalp can produce an electric current within the brain that activates the motor pathways of the pyramidal tracts. This technique is known as transcranial electrical motor potential (TcMEP) monitoring. This technique effectively evaluates the motor pathways in the central nervous system during surgeries which place these structures at risk. These motor pathways, including the lateral corticospinal tract, are located in the lateral and ventral funiculi of the spinal cord. Since the ventral and dorsal spinal cord have separate blood supply with very limited collateral flow, an anterior cord syndrome (paralysis or paresis with some preserved sensory function) is a possible surgical sequela, so it is important to have monitoring specific to the motor tracts as well as dorsal column monitoring.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation versus electrical stimulation is generally regarded as unsuitable for intraoperative monitoring because it is more sensitive to anesthesia. Electrical stimulation is too painful for clinical use in awake patients. The two modalities are thus complementary, electrical stimulation being the choice for intraoperative monitoring, and magnetic for clinical applications.
