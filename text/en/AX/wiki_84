<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 1970 was the 15th edition of the annual Eurovision Song Contest and took place in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster (NOS), the contest was held at the on 21 March 1970, and was hosted by Dutch television presenter Willy Dobbe.

Twelve countries participated in the contest this year. This was the lowest number of participants since the edition. The reason was that , , , , and all boycotted the 1970 edition, officially because they felt that the contest marginalised smaller countries and was no longer good television entertainment, though it is rumoured that this was also in protest of the four-way tie result that had occurred in 1969.

The winner of the competition was with the song &quot;All Kinds of Everything&quot;, performed by Dana, and written by Derry Lindsay and Jackie Smith. This was Ireland&#x27;s first of their eventual record seven victories in the contest. The finished in second place for the seventh time, while ended up in third placethe best result for the country at the time. This was also the only time that received &quot;nul points&quot;.

== Location ==

Due to there being four winners in the , a question was raised as to which nation would host the 1970 contest. With having hosted in 1969 and the in , only and the were in consideration. A draw of ballots between these two countries resulted in the Netherlands being chosen as the host country.

The , venue of the 1970 contest, is a semi-permanent exhibit at the Ferdinand Bolstraat to Amsterdam and was opened on 31 October 1922. This building was replaced in 1961 by the current RAI building on Europe&#x27;s Square. The current congress and event center on Europe Square, was designed by Alexander Bodon and opened on 2 February 1961.

== Participating countries ==

 (who had not taken part in 1969), , , , and boycotted this contest as they were not pleased with the result of 1969 and the voting structure.

For the first time, no lead artists from previous contests returned. However, María Jesús Aguirre and Mercedes Valimaña, members of , who provided backing vocals for , returned as backing singers for Spain.

== Format ==
Following the confirmation of the twelve competing countries, the draw to determine the running order of the contest was held on 15 January 1970.

The Dutch producers were forced to pad out the show as only 12 nations decided to make the trip to Amsterdam. The result was a format that has endured almost to the present day. An extended opening sequence (filmed in Amsterdam) set the scene, while every entry was introduced by a short video &#x27;postcard&#x27; featuring each of the participating artists, ostensibly in their own nation. However, the &#x27;postcards&#x27; for Switzerland, Luxembourg, and Monaco were all filmed on location in Paris (as was the French postcard). The long introduction film (over four minutes long) was followed by what probably is one of the shortest ever introductions by any presenter. Willy Dobbe only welcomed the viewers in English, French, and Dutch, finishing her introduction after only 24 seconds. On-screen captions introduced each entry, with the song titles listed all in lowercase and the names of the artist and composers/authors all in capitals.

The set design was devised by Roland de Groot; a simple design was composed of a number of curved horizontal bars and silver baubles which could be moved in a variety of different ways.

To avoid an incident like in 1969, a tie-breaking rule was created. It stated that, if two or more songs gained the same number of votes and were tied for first place, each song would have to be performed again. After which each national jury (other than the juries of the countries concerned) would have a show of hands of which they thought was the best. If the countries tied again, then they would share first place.

== Contest overview ==
Ireland won the contest with &quot;All Kinds of Everything&quot;, penned by Derry Lindsay and Jackie Smith, and sung by another unknown, Dana, an 18-year-old schoolgirl from Derry, Northern Ireland. As the contest was held in the Netherlands this year, and the country was one of the four winners in 1969, Dana received her awards from the Dutch winner Lenny Kuhr.

=== Spokespersons ===
Each participating broadcaster appointed a spokesperson who was responsible for announcing the votes for their respective country via telephone. Known spokespersons at the 1970 contest are listed below.

* John Skehan
* Ramón Rivera
* Colin Ward-Lewis

== Detailed voting results ==

== Broadcasts ==

Each participating broadcaster was required to relay the contest via its networks. Non-participating EBU member broadcasters were also able to relay the contest as &quot;passive participants&quot;. Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their television viewers.

In addition to the participating countries, the contest was reported to have been broadcast by EBU member broadcasters in Greece, Iceland, Israel, and Tunisia; in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and the Soviet Union via Intervision; and in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile. An estimated global audience of 400 million viewers was reported to have watched the contest. It was also known to broadcast on radio in countries including Ireland, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Known details on the broadcasts in each country, including the specific broadcasting stations and commentators are shown in the tables below.

<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 1971 was the 16th edition of the annual Eurovision Song Contest. It took place in Dublin, Ireland, following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;All Kinds of Everything&quot; by Dana. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster (RTÉ), the contest was held at the Gaiety Theatre on 3 April 1971, and was hosted by Irish television presenter Bernadette Ní Ghallchóir.

Eighteen countries participated in the contest, equalling the record of the and editions. returned after their two-year absence, while , , , and all returned after having boycotted the competition the previous year. On the other hand, competed for the first time.

The winner was with the song &quot;&quot;, performed by Séverine, written by Yves Dessca, and composed by Jean-Pierre Bourtayre. This was Monaco&#x27;s first and only victory in the contest. This was also the only time in the contest&#x27;s history, where the second and third-placed entrants were also awarded.

== Location ==

The contest was held at the Gaiety Theatre in Dublin, the capital and most populous city of Ireland. This was the first time that the contest was held in Ireland. The Gaiety Theatre was selected as the venue for the 1971 contest as it was celebrating 100 years since its establishment in 1871.

== Participating countries ==

 made their début in this year&#x27;s contest, while , , , , and all returned after a brief absence. This brought the total number of countries to eighteen.

Two of the performing artists had previously competed as lead artists representing the same country in past editions: Jacques Raymond had represented and Katja Ebstein had represented . In addition, María Jesús Aguirre and Mercedes Valimaña, who provided backing vocals for and , and Cristina Fernández who did so in 1970, returned as backing singers for Spain as .

== Format ==
For the first time, each participating broadcaster was required to televise all the songs in &quot;previews&quot; prior to the live final. Belgium&#x27;s preview video featured Nicole and Hugo performing the song &quot;&quot;, but Nicole was struck with a sudden illness days before the contest final, with Jacques Raymond and Lily Castel stepping in at short notice to perform the entry in their place. Reports suggested that Castel had not even had enough time to buy a suitable dress for the show.

The BBC were worried about the possible audience reaction to the British song due to the hostilities raging in Northern Ireland. They specifically selected a singer from Northern Ireland, Clodagh Rodgers, who was popular in both the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, to ease any ill-feeling from the Dublin audience. However, Rodgers still received death threats from the IRA for representing the United Kingdom.

Groups of up to six people were allowed to perform for the first time, with the rule in previous contests of performing either solo or as a duet abolished.

In between each song, a film depicting the tourist highlights of each nation was shown, using stock footage provided by the participant tourism bureaus, accompanied by a piece of organ music chosen to complement the country.

This is the only time in the contest&#x27;s history where the second and third placing entrants were also awarded.

== Contest overview ==

== Detailed voting results ==
A new voting system was introduced in this year&#x27;s contest: each participating broadcaster appointed two jury members, one aged over 25 and the other under 25 (with at least ten years&#x27; difference between their ages), with both awarding each country (except their own) a score of between one and five points.

While this meant that no entry could score fewer than 34 points (and in the event all eighteen scored at least 52), it had one major problem: some jury members tended to award only one or two points. Whether this was done to increase their respective countries&#x27; chances of winning is not known for sure, but this shortcoming was nonetheless plain. However, the system remained in place for the and .

=== 10 points ===
Below is a summary of all perfect 10 scores that were given during the voting.

== Broadcasts ==

Each participating broadcaster was required to relay the contest via its networks. Non-participating EBU member broadcasters were also able to relay the contest as &quot;passive participants&quot;. Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their television viewers. In addition to the participating countries, the contest was also reportedly broadcast in Greece, Iceland, Morocco, and Tunisia; in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, and Romania via Intervision; and in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Ethiopia, Hong Kong, Jamaica, Kenya, Mauritania, Mauritius, Sierra Leone, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Uganda, and the United States. Germany, Ireland, Portugal and Turkey have been reported to broadcast on radio. At least 500 million viewers were reported to see the contest.

<text>The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) is a committee of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and an advisory body of the Internet Society (ISOC). Its responsibilities include architectural oversight of IETF activities, Internet Standards Process oversight and appeal, and the appointment of the Request for Comments (RFC) Editor. The IAB is also responsible for the management of the IETF protocol parameter registries.

== History ==
The body which eventually became the IAB was originally the Internet Configuration Control Board (ICCB). It was created by Vint Cerf in 1979 while he was working at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) of the United States Department of Defense. In 1983, the ICCB was reorganized by Barry Leiner, Cerf&#x27;s successor at DARPA, around a series of task forces considering different technical aspects of internetting. The re-organized group was named the Internet Activities Board (IAB).

The IAB set for itself seven principal foci for the period of 1989 to 1990. These were namely:

*Operational Stability
*User Services
*OSI Coexistence
*Testbed Facilities
*Security
*Getting Big
*Getting Fast

It finally became the &quot;Internet Architecture Board&quot;, under ISOC, in January 1992, as part of the Internet&#x27;s transition from a U.S.-government entity to an international, public entity.

== Responsibilities ==
The IAB is responsible for:

*Providing architectural oversight of Internet protocols and procedures
*Liaising with other organizations on behalf of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
*Reviewing appeals of the Internet standards process
*Managing Internet standards documents (the RFC series) and protocol parameter value assignment
*Confirming the Chair of the IETF and the IETF Area Directors
*Selecting the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) Chair
*Acting as a source of advice and guidance to the Internet Society.

In its work, the IAB strives to:

*Ensure that the Internet is a trusted medium of communication that provides a solid technical foundation for privacy and security, especially in light of pervasive surveillance,
*Establish the technical direction for an Internet that will enable billions more people to connect, support the vision for an Internet of things, and allow mobile networks to flourish, while keeping the core capabilities that have been a foundation of the Internet&#x27;s success, and
*Promote the technical evolution of an open Internet without special controls, especially those that hinder trust in the network.

==RFC1087 – Ethics and the Internet and a rise to modernity==
The IAB takes a formal stance on what constitutes proper use of the Internet in their 1989 memo, RFC 1087: “Ethics and the Internet.” They introduce their contemporary version of the Internet, which at the time was in its nascent stages, serving primarily as a tool for communication of research in the scientific community, and identify the use of this internet as a “privilege.”

The IAB then proclaims as unethical any activity which:
* seeks to gain unauthorized access to the resources of the Internet,
* disrupts the intended use of the Internet,
* wastes resources (people, capacity, computer) through such actions,
* destroys the integrity of computer-based information
* compromises the privacy of users.
This memo was written at a time during which the Internet existed in the general research milieu, but since that time the Internet has evolved greatly and expanded its user base. The IAB has accordingly taken new stances on ethical and secure Internet use, such as in RFC 8890, where the IAB identifies protecting end users as the first priority in their maintenance of the Internet.

As such, though their core principles are the same, the IAB&#x27;s priority for protection has shifted from the technical and scientific community to the community of day-to-day users. In another memo RFC7624, the IAB takes a firm stance against pervasive mass surveillance through the use of the Internet on the part of national intelligence agencies, saying that it is necessary that the Internet technical community, including itself, “address the vulnerabilities exploited [by mass surveillance campaigns]...to ensure that the Internet can be trusted by [its] users.”

==RFC 2850 - Charter of the Internet Architecture Board==
RFC 2850 establishes the structure and purpose of the IAB. The RFC specifies the following:
* IAB membership: the IAB has 13 members, 1 being the chair of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). These members are appointed to 2-year terms.
* The Role of the IAB: The IAB serves to provide Architectural Oversight for Internet procedures, and to provide oversight in the process of creating Internet standards, including appeals. Furthermore, the IAB acts as a liaison to the Internet Society (ISOC) to advise regarding architectural and technical issues.
* IAB Organization: The 13 members of the IAB choose 1 member to serve as the chair of the IAB for a 1-year term. There is no limit to the number of terms that the chair can serve. The executive director of the IAB is chosen by the chair. The IAB also has the power to designate the chair of the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) for a 2-year term.
* Decision-making: in most situations, the IAB aims to come to unanimous decisions on matters. When this is not possible, the IAB must come to a consensus of at least 7 members before taking action.
* Openness and confidentiality: The IAB makes all meetings open to the public by making it available online, and also publishes RFCs regularly to make its conclusions generally available. In some situations, however, confidential information is excluded for privacy reasons.

==RFC 2026 - The Internet Standards Process==
The Internet Standards process is an activity of the Internet Society that is organized and managed on behalf of the Internet community by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG). The Internet Standards Process is concerned with all protocols, procedures, and conventions that are used in or by the Internet. The process of creating an Internet Standard is straightforward: a specification undergoes a period of development and several iterations of review by the Internet community and revision based upon experience, is adopted as a Standard by the appropriate body (either the IAB or the IESG), and is published. Each distinct version of an Internet standards-related specification is published as part of the &quot;Request for Comments&quot; (RFC) document series. This archival series is the official publication channel for Internet standards documents and other publications of the IESG, IAB, and Internet community. The complete Internet Standards Process is itself specified by an RFC, namely RFC 2026.

==RFC 8980 - Workshop on Design Expectations vs. Deployment Reality in Protocol Development ==
The RFC 8980 workshop was held in February 2021, where the IAB discussed several topics around security protocols, including:

*Email standards, which presumed many providers running in a largely uncoordinated fashion but have seen both significant market consolidation and a need for coordination to defend against spam and other attacks. The coordination and centralized defense mechanisms scale better for large entities; these have fueled additional consolidation.
*The Domain Name System (DNS), which presumed deep hierarchies but has often been deployed in large, flat zones, leading to the nameservers for those zones becoming critical infrastructure. Future developments in DNS may see concentration through the use of globally available common resolver services, which evolve rapidly and can offer better security. Paradoxically, the concentration of these queries into a few services creates new security and privacy concerns.
*The Web, which is built on a fundamentally decentralized design but is now often delivered with the aid of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). Their services provide scaling, distribution, and prevention of denial of service in ways that new entrants and smaller systems operators would find difficult to replicate. While truly small services and truly large services may each operate using only their own infrastructure, many others are left with the only practical choice being the use of a globally available commercial service.

The workshop resulted in the following recommendations by the IAB:
* Develop and document a modern threat model.
* Continue discussion of consolidation/centralization issues.
* Document architectural principles, e.g., (re)application of the end-to-end principle.

<text>The Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) is an organization, overseen by the Internet Architecture Board, that focuses on longer-term research issues related to the Internet. A parallel organization, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), focuses on the shorter term issues of engineering and standards making. 

The IRTF promotes research of importance to the evolution of the Internet by creating focused, long-term research groups working on topics related to Internet protocols, applications, architecture and technology. Unlike the IETF, the task force does not set standards and there is no explicit outcome expected of IRTF research groups.

== Organization ==

The IRTF is composed of a number of focused and long-term research groups. These groups work on topics related to Internet protocols, applications, architecture and technology. Research groups have the stable long-term membership needed to promote the development of research collaboration and teamwork in exploring research issues. Participation is by individual contributors, rather than by representatives of organizations. The list of current groups can be found on the IRTF&#x27;s homepage.

== Operations ==

The IRTF is managed by the IRTF chair in consultation with the Internet Research Steering Group (IRSG). The IRSG membership includes the IRTF chair, the chairs of the various Research Groups and other individuals (&quot;members at large&quot;) from the research community selected by the IRTF chair. The chair of the IRTF is appointed by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) for a two-year term.

These individuals have chaired the IRTF:

* David D. Clark, 1989–1992
* Jon Postel, 1992–1995
* Abel Weinrib, 1995–1999
* Erik Huizer, 1999–2001
* Vern Paxson, 2001–2005
* Aaron Falk, 2005–2011
* Lars Eggert, 2011–2017
* Allison Mankin, 2017–2019
* Colin Perkins, 2019–Present

The IRTF chair is responsible for ensuring that research groups produce coherent, coordinated, architecturally consistent and timely output as a contribution to the overall evolution of the Internet architecture. In addition to the detailed tasks related to research groups outlined below, the IRTF chair may also from time to time arrange for topical workshops attended by the IRSG and perhaps other experts in the field.

The RFC Editor publishes documents from the IRTF and its research groups on the IRTF stream.

===IRSG===
The IRTF is managed by the IRTF chair in consultation with the Internet Research Steering Group (IRSG). The IRSG membership includes the IRTF chair, the chairs of the various IRTF research groups and other individuals (&quot;members at large&quot;) from the research or IETF communities. IRSG members at large are chosen by the IRTF chair in consultation with the rest of the IRSG and on approval by the Internet Architecture Board.

In addition to managing the research groups, the IRSG may from time to time hold topical workshops focusing on research areas of importance to the evolution of the Internet, or more general workshops to, for example, discuss research priorities from an Internet perspective.

The IRSG also reviews and approves documents published as part of the IRTF document stream.

<doc id="184823" wikidata="Q3163276" url="?curid=184823" title="Jay Ward">
<text>Joseph Ward Cohen Jr. (September 20, 1920 – October 12, 1989), also known as Jay Ward, was an American creator and producer of animated TV cartoon shows. He produced animated series based on such characters as Crusader Rabbit, Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle, Dudley Do-Right, Mr. Peabody, Hoppity Hooper, George of the Jungle, Tom Slick, and Super Chicken. His own company, Jay Ward Productions, designed the trademark characters for the Cap&#x27;n Crunch, Quisp, and Quake breakfast cereals and it made TV commercials for those products. Ward produced the non-animated series &quot;Fractured Flickers&quot; (1963) that featured comedic redubbing of silent films.

==Early life==
Jay Ward was born Joseph Ward Cohen Jr., the son of Joseph Ward Cohen (1890–1967) and Mercedes Juanita (née Troplong) Ward (1892–1972). He was raised in Berkeley, California, attending Frances E. Willard Intermediate School as &quot;J. Ward&quot;.

He obtained his undergraduate degree at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1947, he obtained his MBA from Harvard Business School.

==Early career==
In 1947, the first day that Ward opened his first real estate office at the corner of Ashby and Claremont, a runaway truck crashed through the building and pinned Ward. While recuperating, Ward decided to animate cartoons, but kept his real estate business, later moving it to Domingo Avenue and then Tunnel Road, where it stayed, in Berkeley, even after Ward moved to Los Angeles. He later received incorrect medical treatment while hyperventilating in an airplane. He then developed agoraphobia.

==Animation career==
Ward moved into the young mass medium of television with the help of his childhood friend, the animator Alex Anderson. Taking the character Crusader Rabbit to NBC-TV and the pioneering distributor of TV-programs, Jerry Fairbanks, they put together a pilot film, &quot;The Comic Strips of Television&quot;, featuring Crusader Rabbit, Hamhock Bones, a parody of Sherlock Holmes, and Dudley Do-Right, a bumbling Canadian Mountie.

NBC-TV and Fairbanks were both unimpressed with all but Crusader Rabbit. The animated series &quot;Crusader Rabbit&quot; premiered in 1948 and continued its initial run through 1952. Adopting a serialized, mock-melodrama format, it followed the adventures of Crusader and his dimwitted sidekick Rags the Tiger. It was, in form and content, much like the series that would later gain Ward enduring fame, &quot;Rocky and His Friends&quot;.

===Rocky and Bullwinkle===
Ward and Anderson lost the rights to the Crusader Rabbit character in a legal fight with businessman Shull Bonsall, who had taken over the assets of the bankrupt Jerry Fairbanks company, and a new color Crusader Rabbit series under a different producer premiered in 1956. Ward then pursued an unsold series idea, &quot;The Frostbite Falls Revue&quot;. Taking place in a TV studio in the North Woods, the proposed series featured a cast of eccentrics such as newsman Oski Bear and two minor characters named Rocky the Flying Squirrel and Bullwinkle J. Moose, described in the script treatment as a &quot;French-Canadian moose.&quot;

&quot;Rocky and His Friends&quot; premiered in the late-afternoon, after &quot;American Bandstand&quot;. on ABC in 1959, moving to prime-time on NBC as &quot;The Bullwinkle Show&quot; in 1961, the series contained a mix of sophisticated and low-brow humor. Thanks to animators from United Productions of America, Ward&#x27;s genial partner Bill Scott (who contributed to the scripts and voiced Bullwinkle and other characters) and their writers, including Chris Hayward, and Allan Burns, puns were used often and shamelessly. In a &quot;Fractured Fairy Tales&quot; featuring Little Jack Horner, upon pulling out the plum, Jack announced, &quot;Lord, what foods these morsels be!&quot; Self-referential humor was another trademark: in one episode, the breathless announcer (William Conrad) gave away the villain&#x27;s plans, prompting the villain to grab the announcer from offscreen, bind and gag him, and deposit him visibly within the scene. The show skewered popular culture, taking on such subjects as advertising, college sports, the Cold War, and TV itself. The hapless duo from Frostbite Falls, Minnesota, blundered into unlikely adventures much as Crusader and Rags had before them, pursued by &quot;no-goodnik&quot; spies Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale, perennially under orders to &quot;keel moose and squirrel&quot;.

In a running-joke tribute to Ward, many of his cartoon characters had the middle initial &quot;J.&quot; The cartoonist Matt Groening later gave the middle initial &quot;J.&quot; to many of his characters as a tribute to Jay Ward.

Ward fought many heated battles over content with the network and sponsor. The &quot;Kirward Derby&quot;, a bowler hat that made everyone stupid and Bullwinkle a genius, was named (as a spoonerism) for Durward Kirby, sidekick of the 1950s and 1960s TV host Garry Moore and the co-host of Allen Funt&#x27;s &quot;Candid Camera&quot;. When Kirby threatened to sue, Ward quipped, &quot;Please do! We need the publicity!&quot;

An eccentric and proud of it, Ward was known for pulling an unusual publicity stunt that coincided with a national crisis. Ward leased an island on the Canadian border in Minnesota near his home and dubbed it &quot;Moosylvania,&quot; based upon the home of his Bullwinkle TV character. He and publicist Howard Brandy crossed the country in a van, gathering signatures on a petition for statehood for Moosylvania. They then visited Washington, D.C., and attempted to gain an audience with President John F. Kennedy. Unfortunately, they arrived at the White House the morning the Cuban Missile Crisis was breaking, and were ordered at gunpoint to drive off.

==Personal life and death ==

Ward married Ramona &quot;Billie&quot; Ward in 1943; the couple had three children: Ron, Carey, and Tiffany.

Ward died of renal cancer in West Hollywood on October 12, 1989, and is buried in Glendale&#x27;s Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery.

==Legacy==
The offices of Jay Ward Productions were located across the street from the Chateau Marmont on the Sunset Strip. In 2007, the building could be identified by a statue of Bullwinkle and Rocky, located in front. In 2013, the statue was reported by the Los Angeles NBC affiliate KNBC to have been removed from its location by DreamWorks Animation, which previously owned the licensing rights to the Jay Ward catalogue. DreamWorks Animation had stated that they intended to restore the statue as soon as repairs were completed on it; however, as of May 2014, the statue&#x27;s whereabouts and status were unknown. It had been speculated that DreamWorks intended to relocate the statue to its own headquarters. In late 2014 (ran until 4 January 2015) the statue was temporarily housed at the Paley Center for Media, in Beverly Hills, California, in conjunction with &quot;The Jay Ward Legacy Exhibit&quot;. The Jay Ward family gifted the refurbished statue to the City of West Hollywood as part of its Urban Art collection. On Feb 28th, 2020, the Bullwinkle statue finally received its permanent home when it was installed on the island at Sunset Blvd. and Holloway Drive, right across from where Tower Records and Spago had been.

Following Ward&#x27;s death, Alexander Anderson Jr., who had created the initial conceptions of the characters Dudley Do-Right, Bullwinkle and Rocky, but had not received public recognition, learned the characters had been copyrighted in Ward&#x27;s name alone. He sued Ward&#x27;s heirs to reclaim credit as a creator, and in either 1993 or 1996 (sources differ), Anderson received a financial settlement and a court order acknowledging him as the &quot;creator of the first version of the characters of Rocky, Bullwinkle, and Dudley.&quot;

On June 21, 2000, Ward was recognized with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7080 Hollywood Boulevard for his contribution to the television industry, as part of the publicity for the live-action and animation film &quot;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot;.

Until it closed in July 2004, the Dudley Do-Right Emporium, which sold souvenirs based on Ward&#x27;s characters and was largely staffed by Ward and his family, operated on Sunset Boulevard.

<text>The common blackbird (Turdus merula) is a species of true thrush. It is also called the Eurasian blackbird (especially in North America, to distinguish it from the unrelated New World blackbirds), or simply the blackbird where this does not lead to confusion with a local species. It breeds in Europe, western Asia, and North Africa, and has been introduced to Australia and New Zealand. It has a number of subspecies across its large range; a few former Asian subspecies are now widely treated as separate species. Depending on latitude, the common blackbird may be resident, partially migratory, or fully migratory.

The adult male of the common blackbird (&quot;Turdus merula merula&quot;, the nominate subspecies), which is found throughout most of Europe, is all black except for a yellow eye-ring and bill and has a rich, melodious song; the adult female and juvenile have mainly dark brown plumage. This species breeds in woods and gardens, building a neat, cup-shaped nest, bound together with mud. It is omnivorous, eating a wide range of insects, earthworms, berries, and fruits.

Both sexes are territorial on the breeding grounds, with distinctive threat displays, but are more gregarious during migration and in wintering areas. Pairs stay in their territory throughout the year where the climate is sufficiently temperate. This common and conspicuous species has given rise to a number of literary and cultural references, frequently related to its song.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The common blackbird was described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; as &quot;Turdus merula&quot; (characterised as &quot;T. ater, rostro palpebrisque fulvis&quot;). The binomial name derives from two Latin words, , &quot;thrush&quot;, and , &quot;blackbird&quot;, the latter giving rise to its French name, , and its Scots name, &quot;merl&quot;.

About 65 species of medium to large thrushes are in the genus &quot;Turdus&quot;, characterised by rounded heads, longish, pointed wings, and usually melodious songs. Although two European thrushes, the song thrush and mistle thrush, are early offshoots from the Eurasian lineage of &quot;Turdus&quot; thrushes after they spread north from Africa, the blackbird is descended from ancestors that had colonised the Canary Islands from Africa and subsequently reached Europe from there. It is close in evolutionary terms to the island thrush (&quot;T. poliocephalus&quot;) of Southeast Asia and islands in the southwest Pacific, which probably diverged from &quot;T. merula&quot; stock fairly recently.

It may not immediately be clear why the name &quot;blackbird&quot;, first recorded in 1486, was applied to this species, but not to one of the various other common black English birds, such as the carrion crow, raven, rook, or jackdaw. However, in Old English, and in modern English up to about the 18th century, &quot;bird&quot; was used only for smaller or young birds, and larger ones such as crows were called &quot;fowl&quot;. At that time, the blackbird was therefore the only widespread and conspicuous &quot;black bird&quot; in the British Isles. Until about the 17th century, another name for the species was &quot;ouzel&quot;, &quot;ousel&quot; or &quot;wosel&quot; (from Old English , cf. German ). Another variant occurs in Act 3 of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, where Bottom refers to &quot;The Woosell cocke, so blacke of hew, With Orenge-tawny bill&quot;. The ouzel usage survived later in poetry, and still occurs as the name of the closely related ring ouzel (&quot;Turdus torquatus&quot;), and in water ouzel, an alternative name for the unrelated but superficially similar white-throated dipper (&quot;Cinclus cinclus&quot;).

Five related Asian &quot;Turdus&quot; thrushes—the white-collared blackbird (&quot;T. albocinctus&quot;), the grey-winged blackbird (&quot;T. boulboul&quot;), the Indian blackbird (&quot;T. simillimus&quot;), the Tibetan blackbird (&quot;T. maximus&quot;), and the Chinese blackbird (&quot;T. mandarinus&quot;)—are also named blackbirds; the latter three species were formerly treated as conspecific with the common blackbird. In addition, the Somali thrush (&quot;T. (olivaceus) ludoviciae&quot;) is alternatively known as the Somali blackbird.

The icterid family of the New World is sometimes called the blackbird family because of some species&#x27; superficial resemblance to the common blackbird and other Old World thrushes, but they are not evolutionarily close, being related to the New World warblers and tanagers. The term is often limited to smaller species with mostly or entirely black plumage, at least in the breeding male, notably the cowbirds, the grackles, and for around 20 species with &quot;blackbird&quot; in the name, such as the red-winged blackbird and the melodious blackbird.

===Subspecies===
As would be expected for a widespread passerine bird species, several geographical subspecies are recognised. The treatment of subspecies in this article follows Clement et al. (2000).
* &quot;T. m. merula&quot;, the nominate subspecies, breeds commonly throughout much of Europe from Iceland, the Faroes and the British Isles east to the Ural Mountains and north to about 70 N, where it is fairly scarce. A small population breeds in the Nile Valley. Birds from the north of the range winter throughout Europe and around the Mediterranean, including Cyprus and North Africa. The introduced birds in Australia and New Zealand are of the nominate race.
* &quot;T. m. azorensis&quot; is a small race which breeds in the Azores. The male is darker and glossier than &quot;merula&quot;.
* &quot;T. m. cabrerae&quot;, named for Ángel Cabrera, the Spanish zoologist, resembles &quot;azorensis&quot; and breeds in Madeira and the western Canary Islands.
* &quot;T. m. mauritanicus&quot;, another small dark subspecies with a glossy black male plumage, breeds in central and northern Morocco, coastal Algeria and northern Tunisia.
* &quot;T m. aterrimus&quot; breeds in Hungary, south and east to southern Greece, Crete, northern Turkey and northern Iran. It winters in southern Turkey, northern Egypt, Iraq and southern Iran. It is smaller than &quot;merula&quot; with a duller male and paler female plumage.
* &quot;T. m. syriacus&quot; breeds on the Mediterranean coast of southern Turkey south to Jordan, Israel and the northern Sinai. It is mostly resident, but part of the population moves southwest or west to winter in the Jordan Valley and in the Nile Delta of northern Egypt south to about Cairo. Both sexes of this subspecies are darker and greyer than the equivalent &quot;merula&quot; plumages.
* &quot;T. m. intermedius&quot; is an Asian race breeding from Central Russia to Tajikistan, western and northeastern Afghanistan, and eastern China. Many birds are resident, but some are altitudinal migrants and occur in southern Afghanistan and southern Iraq in winter. This is a large subspecies, with a sooty-black male and a blackish-brown female.

The Central Asian subspecies, the relatively large &quot;intermedius&quot;, also differs in structure and voice, and may represent a distinct species. Alternatively, it has been suggested that it should be considered a subspecies of &quot;T. maximus&quot;, but it differs in structure, voice and the appearance of the eye-ring.

===Similar species===
In Europe, the common blackbird can be confused with the paler-winged first-winter ring ouzel (&quot;Turdus torquatus&quot;) or the superficially similar common starling (&quot;Sturnus vulgaris&quot;). A number of similar &quot;Turdus&quot; thrushes exist far outside the range of the common blackbird, for example the South American Chiguanco thrush (&quot;Turdus chiguanco&quot;). The Indian blackbird (&quot;Turdus simillimus&quot;), the Tibetan blackbird (&quot;Turdus maximus&quot;), and the Chinese blackbird (&quot;Turdus mandarinus&quot;) were formerly treated as subspecies of the common blackbird.

==Description==
The common blackbird of the nominate subspecies &quot;T. m. merula&quot; is in length, has a long tail, and weighs . The adult male has glossy black plumage, blackish-brown legs, a yellow eye-ring and an orange-yellow bill. The bill darkens somewhat in winter. The adult female is sooty-brown with a dull yellowish-brownish bill, a brownish-white throat and some weak mottling on the breast. The juvenile is similar to the female, but has pale spots on the upperparts, and the very young juvenile also has a speckled breast. Young birds vary in the shade of brown, with darker birds presumably males. The first year male resembles the adult male, but has a dark bill and weaker eye ring, and its folded wing is brown, rather than black like the body plumage.

==Distribution and habitat==
The common blackbird breeds in temperate Eurasia, North Africa, the Canary Islands, and South Asia. It has been introduced to Australia and New Zealand. Populations are sedentary in the south and west of the range, although northern birds migrate south as far as northern Africa and tropical Asia in winter. Urban males are more likely to overwinter in cooler climes than rural males, an adaptation made feasible by the warmer microclimate and relatively abundant food that allow the birds to establish territories and start reproducing earlier in the year. Recoveries of blackbirds ringed on the Isle of May show that these birds commonly migrate from southern Norway (or from as far north as Trondheim) to Scotland, and some onwards to Ireland. Scottish-ringed birds have also been recovered in England, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Sweden. Female blackbirds in Scotland and the north of England migrate more (to Ireland) in winter than do the males.

Common over most of its range in woodland, the common blackbird has a preference for deciduous trees with dense undergrowth. However, gardens provide the best breeding habitat with up to 7.3 pairs per hectare (nearly three pairs per acre), with woodland typically holding about a tenth of that density, and open and very built-up habitats even less. They are often replaced by the related ring ouzel in areas of higher altitude. The common blackbird also lives in parks, gardens and hedgerows.

The common blackbird occurs at elevations of up to in Europe, in North Africa, and at in peninsular India and Sri Lanka, but the large Himalayan subspecies range much higher, with &quot;T. m. maximus&quot; breeding at and remaining above even in winter.

This widespread species has occurred as a vagrant in many locations in Eurasia outside its normal range, but records from North America are normally considered to involve escapees, including, for example, the 1971 bird in Quebec. However, a 1994 record from Bonavista, Newfoundland, has been accepted as a genuine wild bird, and the species is therefore on the North American list.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The male common blackbird defends its breeding territory, chasing away other males or utilising a &quot;bow and run&quot; threat display. This consists of a short run, the head first being raised and then bowed with the tail dipped simultaneously. If a fight between male blackbirds does occur, it is usually short and the intruder is soon chased away. The female blackbird is also aggressive in the spring when it competes with other females for a good nesting territory, and although fights are less frequent, they tend to be more violent.

The bill&#x27;s appearance is important in the interactions of the common blackbird. The territory-holding male responds more aggressively towards models with orange bills than to those with yellow bills, and reacts least to the brown bill colour typical of the first-year male. The female is, however, relatively indifferent to bill colour, but responds instead to shinier bills.

As long as winter food is available, both the male and female will remain in the territory throughout the year, although occupying different areas. Migrants are more gregarious, travelling in small flocks and feeding in loose groups in the wintering grounds. The flight of migrating birds comprises bursts of rapid wing beats interspersed with level or diving movement, and differs from both the normal fast agile flight of this species and the more dipping action of larger thrushes.

===Breeding===
The male common blackbird attracts the female with a courtship display which consists of oblique runs combined with head-bowing movements, an open beak, and a &quot;strangled&quot; low song. The female remains motionless until she raises her head and tail to permit copulation. This species is monogamous, and the established pair will usually stay together as long as they both survive. Pair separation rates of up to 20% have been noted following poor breeding. Although the species is socially monogamous, there have been studies showing as much as 17% extra-pair paternity.

The nominate &quot;T. merula&quot; may commence breeding in March, but eastern and Indian races are a month or more later, and the introduced New Zealand birds start nesting in August (late winter). The breeding pair prospect for a suitable nest site in a creeper or bush, favouring evergreen or thorny species such as ivy, holly, hawthorn, honeysuckle or pyracantha. Sometimes the birds will nest in sheds or outbuildings where a ledge or cavity is used. The cup-shaped nest is made with grasses, leaves and other vegetation, bound together with mud. It is built by the female alone. She lays three to five (usually four) bluish-green eggs marked with reddish-brown blotches, heaviest at the larger end; the eggs of nominate &quot;T. merula&quot; are in size and weigh , of which 6% is shell. Eggs of birds of the southern Indian races are paler than those from the northern subcontinent and Europe.

The female incubates for 12–14 days before the altricial chicks are hatched naked and blind. Fledging takes another 10–19 (average 13.6) days, with both parents feeding the young and removing faecal sacs. The nest is often ill-concealed compared with those of other species, and many breeding attempts fail due to predation. The young are fed by the parents for up to three weeks after leaving the nest, and will follow the adults begging for food. If the female starts another nest, the male alone will feed the fledged young. Second broods are common, with the female reusing the same nest if the brood was successful, and three broods may be raised in the south of the common blackbird&#x27;s range.

A common blackbird has an average life expectancy of 2.4 years, and, based on data from bird ringing, the oldest recorded age is 21 years and 10 months.

===Songs and calls===
In its native Northern Hemisphere range, the first-year male common blackbird of the nominate race may start singing as early as late January in fine weather in order to establish a territory, followed in late March by the adult male. The male&#x27;s song is a varied and melodious low-pitched fluted warble, given from trees, rooftops or other elevated perches mainly in the period from March to June, sometimes into the beginning of July. It has a number of other calls, including an aggressive &quot;seee&quot;, a &quot;pook-pook-pook&quot; alarm for terrestrial predators like cats, and various &quot;chink&quot; and &quot;chook, chook&quot; vocalisations. The territorial male invariably gives &quot;chink-chink&quot; calls in the evening in an attempt (usually unsuccessful) to deter other blackbirds from roosting in its territory overnight. During the northern winter, blackbirds can be heard quietly singing to themselves, so much so that September and October are the only months in which the song cannot be heard. Like other passerine birds, it has a thin high &quot;seee&quot; alarm call for threats from birds of prey since the sound is rapidly attenuated in vegetation, making the source difficult to locate.

The nominate subspecies &quot;T. m. merula&quot; is known to mimic sounds in the local environment, including the songs of other birds, as well as human sounds and technology such as whistling and car alarms.

===Feeding===

The common blackbird is omnivorous, eating a wide range of insects, earthworms, seeds and berries. It feeds mainly on the ground, running and hopping with a start-stop-start progress. It pulls earthworms from the soil, usually finding them by sight, but sometimes by hearing, and roots through leaf litter for other invertebrates. Small amphibians, lizards and (on rare occasions) small mammals are occasionally hunted. This species will also perch in bushes to take berries and collect caterpillars and other active insects. Animal prey predominates, and is particularly important during the breeding season, with windfall apples and berries taken more in the autumn and winter. The nature of the fruit taken depends on what is locally available, and frequently includes exotics in gardens.

===Natural threats===

Near human habitation the main predator of the common blackbird is the domestic cat, with newly fledged young especially vulnerable. Foxes and predatory birds, such as the sparrowhawk and other accipiters, also take this species when the opportunity arises. However, there is little direct evidence to show that either predation of the adult blackbirds or loss of the eggs and chicks to corvids, such as the European magpie or Eurasian jay, decrease population numbers.

This species is occasionally a host of parasitic cuckoos, such as the common cuckoo (&quot;Cuculus canorus&quot;), but this is minimal because the common blackbird recognizes the adult of the parasitic species and its non-mimetic eggs. In the UK, only three nests of 59,770 examined (0.005%) contained cuckoo eggs. The introduced &quot;merula&quot; blackbird in New Zealand, where the cuckoo does not occur, has, over the past 130 years, lost the ability to recognize the adult common cuckoo but still rejects non-mimetic eggs.

As with other passerine birds, parasites are common. Intestinal parasites were found in 88% of common blackbirds, most frequently &quot;Isospora&quot; and &quot;Capillaria&quot; species. and more than 80% had haematozoan parasites (&quot;Leucocytozoon&quot;, &quot;Plasmodium&quot;, &quot;Haemoproteus&quot; and &quot;Trypanosoma&quot; species).

Common blackbirds spend much of their time looking for food on the ground where they can become infested with ticks, which are external parasites that most commonly attach to the head of a blackbird. In France, 74% of rural blackbirds were found to be infested with &quot;Ixodes&quot; ticks, whereas, only 2% of blackbirds living in urban habitats were infested. This is partly because it is more difficult for ticks to find another host on lawns and gardens in urban areas than in uncultivated rural areas, and partly because ticks are likely to be commoner in rural areas, where a variety of tick hosts, such as foxes, deer and boar, are more numerous. Although ixodid ticks can transmit pathogenic viruses and bacteria, and are known to transmit &quot;Borrelia&quot; bacteria to birds, there is no evidence that this affects the fitness of blackbirds except when they are exhausted and run down after migration.

The common blackbird is one of a number of species which has unihemispheric slow-wave sleep. One hemisphere of the brain is effectively asleep, while a low-voltage EEG, characteristic of wakefulness, is present in the other. The benefit of this is that the bird can rest in areas of high predation or during long migratory flights, but still retain a degree of alertness.

==Status and conservation==
The common blackbird has an extensive range, estimated at , and a large population, including an estimated 79 to 160 million individuals in Europe alone. The species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as least concern. In the western Palearctic, populations are generally stable or increasing, but there have been local declines, especially on farmland, which may be due to agricultural policies that encouraged farmers to remove hedgerows (which provide nesting places), and to drain damp grassland and increase the use of pesticides, both of which could have reduced the availability of invertebrate food.

The common blackbird was introduced to Australia by a bird dealer visiting Melbourne in early 1857, and its range has expanded from its initial foothold in Melbourne and Adelaide to include all of southeastern Australia, including Tasmania and the Bass Strait islands. The introduced population in Australia is considered a pest because it damages a variety of soft fruits in orchards, parks and gardens, including berries, cherries, stone fruit and grapes. It is thought to spread weeds, such as blackberry, and may compete with native birds for food and nesting sites.

The introduced common blackbird is, together with the native silvereye (&quot;Zosterops lateralis&quot;), the most widely distributed avian seed disperser in New Zealand. Introduced there along with the song thrush (&quot;Turdus philomelos&quot;) in 1862, it has spread throughout the country up to an elevation of , as well as outlying islands such as the Campbell and Kermadecs. It eats a wide range of native and exotic fruit, and makes a major contribution to the development of communities of naturalised woody weeds. These communities provide fruit more suited to non-endemic native birds and naturalised birds than to endemic birds.

The numbers of blackbirds in Europe have been significantly reduced by the Usutu virus which is spread by mosquitoes. This was detected in Italy in 1996 and has since spread to other countries including Germany and the UK.


==In popular culture==

The common blackbird was seen as a sacred though destructive bird in Classical Greek folklore, and was said to die if it consumed pomegranates. Like many other small birds, it has in the past been trapped in rural areas at its night roosts as an easily available addition to the diet, and in medieval times the practice of placing live birds under a pie crust just before serving may have been the origin of the familiar nursery rhyme:

Sing a song of sixpence,
A pocket full of rye;
Four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie!
When the pie was opened the birds began to sing,
Oh, wasn&#x27;t that a dainty dish to set before the king?

The common blackbird&#x27;s melodious, distinctive song is mentioned in the poem &quot;Adlestrop&quot; by Edward Thomas;
And for that minute a blackbird sang
Close by, and round him, mistier, 
Farther and farther, all the birds 
Of Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire.

In the English Christmas carol &quot;The Twelve Days of Christmas&quot;, the line commonly sung today as &quot;four calling birds&quot; is believed to have originally been written in the 18th century as &quot;four colly birds&quot;, an archaism meaning &quot;black as coal&quot; that was a popular English nickname for the common blackbird.

The common blackbird, unlike many black creatures, is not normally seen as a symbol of bad luck, but R. S. Thomas wrote that there is &quot;a suggestion of dark Places about it&quot;, and it symbolised resignation in the 17th century tragic play &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot;; an alternate connotation is vigilance, the bird&#x27;s clear cry warning of danger.

The common blackbird is the national bird of Sweden, which has a breeding population of 1–2 million pairs, and was featured on a 30 öre Christmas postage stamp in 1970; it has also featured on a number of other stamps issued by European and Asian countries, including a 1966 4d British stamp and a 1998 Irish 30p stamp. This bird—arguably—also gives rise to the Serbian name for Kosovo (and Metohija), which is the possessive adjectival form of Serbian (&quot;blackbird&quot;) as in Kosovo Polje (&quot;Blackbird Field&quot;).

French composer Olivier Messiaen transcribed the songs of male blackbirds; these melodies have commonly appeared throughout his œuvre. The most notable instance of this is the 1952 chamber miniature &quot;Le merle noir&quot;, a piece for flute and piano.

A common blackbird can be heard singing on the Beatles song &quot;Blackbird&quot; as a symbol of the civil rights movement.

<text>The swim bladder, gas bladder, fish maw, or air bladder is an internal gas-filled organ in bony fish (but not cartilaginous fish) that functions to modulate buoyancy, and thus allowing the fish to stay at desired water depth without having to maintain lift via swimming, which expends more energy. Also, the dorsal position of the swim bladder means that the expansion of the bladder moves the center of mass downwards, allowing it to act as a stabilizing agent in some species. Additionally, the swim bladder functions as a resonating chamber, to produce or receive sound.

The swim bladder is evolutionarily homologous to the lungs of tetrapods and lungfish, and some ray-finned fish such as bowfins have also evolved similar respiratory functions in their swim bladders. Charles Darwin remarked upon this in &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, and reasoned that the lung in air-breathing vertebrates had derived from a more primitive swim bladder as a specialized form of enteral respiration.

In the embryonic stages, some species, such as redlip blenny, have lost the swim bladder again, mostly bottom dwellers like the weather fish. Other fish — like the opah and the pomfret — use their pectoral fins to swim and balance the weight of the head to keep a horizontal position. The normally bottom-dwelling sea robin can use their pectoral fins to produce lift while swimming like cartilaginous fish do.

The gas/tissue interface at the swim bladder produces a strong reflection of sound, which is used by sonar equipment to find fish.

Cartilaginous fish, such as sharks and rays, do not have swim bladders. Some of them can control their depth only by swimming (using dynamic lift); others store up lipids with density less than that of seawater to produce a neutral or near-neutral buoyancy, which cannot be readily changed with depth.

==Structure and function==

The swim bladder normally consists of two gas-filled sacs located in the dorsal portion of the fish, although in a few primitive species, there is only a single sac. It has flexible walls that contract or expand according to the ambient pressure. The walls of the bladder contain very few blood vessels and are lined with guanine crystals, which make them impermeable to gases. By adjusting the gas pressurising organ using the gas gland or oval window, the fish can obtain neutral buoyancy and ascend and descend to a large range of depths. Due to the dorsal position it gives the fish lateral stability.

In physostomous swim bladders, a connection is retained between the swim bladder and the gut, the pneumatic duct, allowing the fish to fill up the swim bladder by &quot;gulping&quot; air. Excess gas can be removed in a similar manner.

In more derived varieties of fish (the physoclisti), the connection to the digestive tract is lost. In early life stages, these fish must rise to the surface to fill up their swim bladders; in later stages, the pneumatic duct disappears, and the gas gland has to introduce gas (usually oxygen) to the bladder to increase its volume and thus increase buoyancy. This process begins with the acidification of the blood in the &quot;rete mirabile&quot; when the gas gland excretes lactic acid and produces carbon dioxide, the latter of which acidifies the blood via the bicarbonate buffer system. The resulting acidity causes the hemoglobin of the blood to lose its oxygen (Root effect) which then diffuses partly into the swim bladder. Before returning to the body, the blood re-enters the &quot;rete mirabile&quot;, and as a result, virtually all the excess carbon dioxide and oxygen produced in the gas gland diffuses back to the arteries supplying the gas gland via a countercurrent multiplication loop. Thus a very high gas pressure of oxygen can be obtained, which can even account for the presence of gas in the swim bladders of deep sea fish like the eel, requiring a pressure of hundreds of bars. Elsewhere, at a similar structure known as the &#x27;oval window&#x27;, the bladder is in contact with blood and the oxygen can diffuse back out again. Together with oxygen, other gases are salted out in the swim bladder which accounts for the high pressures of other gases as well.

The combination of gases in the bladder varies. In shallow water fish, the ratios closely approximate that of the atmosphere, while deep sea fish tend to have higher percentages of oxygen. For instance, the eel &quot;Synaphobranchus&quot; has been observed to have 75.1% oxygen, 20.5% nitrogen, 3.1% carbon dioxide, and 0.4% argon in its swim bladder.

Physoclist swim bladders have one important disadvantage: they prohibit fast rising, as the bladder would burst. Physostomes can &quot;burp&quot; out gas, though this complicates the process of re-submergence.

The swim bladder in some species, mainly fresh water fishes (common carp, catfish, bowfin) is interconnected with the inner ear of the fish. They are connected by four bones called the Weberian ossicles from the Weberian apparatus. These bones can carry the vibrations to the saccule and the lagena. They are suited for detecting sound and vibrations due to its low density in comparison to the density of the fish&#x27;s body tissues. This increases the ability of sound detection. The swim bladder can radiate the pressure of sound which help increase its sensitivity and expand its hearing. In some deep sea fishes like the &quot;Antimora&quot;, the swim bladder maybe also connected to the macula of saccule in order for the inner ear to receive a sensation from the sound pressure.
In red-bellied piranha, the swim bladder may play an important role in sound production as a resonator. The sounds created by piranhas are generated through rapid contractions of the sonic muscles and is associated with the swim bladder.

Teleosts are thought to lack a sense of absolute hydrostatic pressure, which could be used to determine absolute depth. However, it has been suggested that teleosts may be able to determine their depth by sensing the rate of change of swim-bladder volume.

==Evolution==


Swim bladders are evolutionarily closely related (i.e., homologous) to lungs. The first lungs originated in the last common ancestor of the Actinopterygii (ray-finned fish) and Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fish and the tetrapods) as expansions of the upper digestive tract which allowed them to gulp air under oxygen-poor conditions. In the Actinopteri (ray-finned fish minus the bichirs) the lungs evolved into a swim bladder (secondary absent in some lineages), which unlike lungs that bud ventrally, buds dorsally from the anterior foregut. Coelacanths have a &quot;fatty organ&quot; that have sometimes been referred to as a swim bladder, but is structurally different and have a separate evolutionary history.

In 1997, Farmer proposed that lungs evolved to supply the heart with oxygen. In fish, blood circulates from the gills to the skeletal muscle, and only then to the heart. During intense exercise, the oxygen in the blood gets used by the skeletal muscle before the blood reaches the heart. Primitive lungs gave an advantage by supplying the heart with oxygenated blood via the cardiac shunt. This theory is robustly supported by the fossil record, the ecology of extant air-breathing fishes, and the physiology of extant fishes. In embryonal development, both lung and swim bladder originate as an outpocketing from the gut; in the case of swim bladders, this connection to the gut continues to exist as the pneumatic duct in the more &quot;primitive&quot; ray-finned fish, and is lost in some of the more derived teleost orders. There are no animals which have both lungs and a swim bladder.

As an adaptation to migrations between the surface and deeper waters, some fish have evolved a swim bladder where the gas is replaced with low-density wax esters as a way to cope with Boyle&#x27;s law.

The cartilaginous fish (e.g., sharks and rays) split from the other fishes about 420 million years ago, and lack both lungs and swim bladders, suggesting that these structures evolved after that split. Correspondingly, these fish also have both heterocercal and stiff, wing-like pectoral fins which provide the necessary lift needed due to the lack of swim bladders. Teleost fish with swim bladders have neutral buoyancy, and have no need for this lift.

==Sonar reflectivity==
The swim bladder of a fish can strongly reflect sound of an appropriate frequency. Strong reflection happens if the frequency is tuned to the volume resonance of the swim bladder. This can be calculated by knowing a number of properties of the fish, notably the volume of the swim bladder, although the well-accepted method for doing so requires correction factors for gas-bearing zooplankton where the radius of the swim bladder is less than about 5 cm. This is important, since sonar scattering is used to estimate the biomass of commercially- and environmentally-important fish species.

==Deep scattering layer==


Sonar operators, using the newly developed sonar technology during World War II, were puzzled by what appeared to be a false sea floor 300–500 metres deep at day, and less deep at night. This turned out to be due to millions of marine organisms, most particularly small mesopelagic fish, with swimbladders that reflected the sonar. These organisms migrate up into shallower water at dusk to feed on plankton. The layer is deeper when the moon is out, and can become shallower when clouds obscure the moon.

Most mesopelagic fish make daily vertical migrations, moving at night into the epipelagic zone, often following similar migrations of zooplankton, and returning to the depths for safety during the day. These vertical migrations often occur over large vertical distances, and are undertaken with the assistance of a swim bladder. The swim bladder is inflated when the fish wants to move up, and, given the high pressures in the mesopelagic zone, this requires significant energy. As the fish ascends, the pressure in the swimbladder must adjust to prevent it from bursting. When the fish wants to return to the depths, the swimbladder is deflated. Some mesopelagic fishes make daily migrations through the thermocline, where the temperature changes between , thus displaying considerable tolerance for temperature change.

Sampling via deep trawling indicates that lanternfish account for as much as 65% of all deep sea fish biomass. Indeed, lanternfish are among the most widely distributed, populous, and diverse of all vertebrates, playing an important ecological role as prey for larger organisms. The estimated global biomass of lanternfish is 550–660 million tonnes, several times the annual world fisheries catch. Lanternfish also account for much of the biomass responsible for the deep scattering layer of the world&#x27;s oceans. Sonar reflects off the millions of lanternfish swim bladders, giving the appearance of a false bottom.

==Human uses==
In the East Asian culinary sphere, the swim bladders of certain large fishes are considered a food delicacy. In Chinese cuisine, they are known as &quot;fish maw&quot;, 花膠/鱼鳔, and are served in soups or stews.

The vanity price of a vanishing kind of maw is behind the imminent extinction of the vaquita, the world&#x27;s smallest porpoise species. Found only in Mexico&#x27;s Gulf of California, the once numerous vaquita are now critically endangered. Vaquita die in gillnets set to catch totoaba (the world&#x27;s largest drum fish). Totoaba are being hunted to extinction for its maw, which can sell for as much $10,000 per kilogram.

Swim bladders are also used in the food industry as a source of collagen. They can be made into a strong, water-resistant glue, or used to make isinglass for the clarification of beer. In earlier times, they were used to make condoms.

==Swim bladder disease==
Swim bladder disease is a common ailment in aquarium fish. A fish with swim bladder disorder can float nose down tail up, or can float to the top or sink to the bottom of the aquarium.

==Risk of injury==

Many anthropogenic activities, such as pile driving or even seismic waves, can create high-intensity sound waves that cause internal injury to fish that possess a gas bladder. 
Physoclisti can not expel air quickly enough from the gas bladder, the organ most susceptible to sonic damage, thus making it difficult for them to escape major injury. Physostomes, on the other hand, &quot;can&quot; release air from their gas bladder expeditiously enough to protect it; nevertheless, they can not relieve pressure in their other vital organs, and are therefore also vulnerable to injury. Some of the commonly seen injuries include ruptured gas bladder and renal Haemorrhage. These mostly affect the overall health of the fish but not their mortality rate. Investigators employed the High-Intensity-Controlled Impedance-Fluid-Filled (HICI-FT), a stainless-steel wave tube with an electromagnetic shaker. It simulates high-energy sound waves in aquatic far-field, plane-wave acoustic conditions.

==Similar structures in other organisms==
Siphonophores have a special swim bladder that allows the jellyfish-like colonies to float along the surface of the water while their tentacles trail below. This organ is unrelated to the one in fish.

<text>The song thrush (Turdus philomelos) is a thrush that breeds across the West Palearctic. It has brown upper-parts and black-spotted cream or buff underparts and has four recognised subspecies. Its distinctive song, which has repeated musical phrases, has frequently been referred to in poetry.

The song thrush breeds in forests, gardens and parks, and is partially migratory with many birds wintering in southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East; it has also been introduced into New Zealand and Australia. Although it is not threatened globally, there have been serious population declines in parts of Europe, possibly due to changes in farming practices.

The song thrush builds a neat mud-lined cup nest in a bush or tree and lays four to five dark-spotted blue eggs. It is omnivorous and has the habit of using a favourite stone as an &quot;anvil&quot; on which to break open the shells of snails. Like other perching birds (passerines), it is affected by external and internal parasites and is vulnerable to predation by cats and birds of prey.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
===Name===
The song thrush was described by German ornithologist Christian Ludwig Brehm in 1831, and still bears its original scientific name, &quot;Turdus philomelos&quot;. The generic name, &quot;Turdus&quot;, is the Latin for &quot;thrush&quot;, and the specific epithet refers to a character in Greek mythology, Philomela, who had her tongue cut out, but was changed into a singing bird. Her name is derived from the Ancient Greek &quot;Φιλο&quot; &quot;philo-&quot; (&quot;loving&quot;), and &quot;μέλος&quot; &quot;melos&quot; (&quot;song&quot;). The dialect names &quot;throstle&quot; and &quot;mavis&quot; both mean &quot;thrush&quot;, being related to the German &quot;drossel&quot; and French &quot;mauvis&quot; respectively. &quot;Throstle&quot; dates back to at least the fourteenth century and was used by Chaucer in the &quot;Parliament of Fowls&quot;. Mavis is derived via Middle English &quot;mavys&quot; and Old French &quot;mauvis&quot; from Middle Breton &quot;milhuyt&quot; meaning &quot;thrush&quot;. Mavis (Μαβής) can also mean &quot;purple&quot; in Greek.

===Classification===

A molecular study indicated that the song thrush&#x27;s closest relatives are the similarly plumaged mistle thrush (&quot;T. viscivorus&quot;) and Chinese thrush (&quot;T. mupinensis&quot;); these three species are early offshoots from the Eurasian lineage of &quot;Turdus&quot; thrushes after they spread north from Africa. They are less closely related to other European thrush species such as the blackbird (&quot;T. merula&quot;) which are descended from ancestors that had colonised the Canary islands from Africa and subsequently reached Europe from there.

The song thrush has four subspecies, with the nominate subspecies, &quot;T. p. philomelos&quot;, covering the majority of the species&#x27; range. &quot;T. p. hebridensis&quot;, described by British ornithologist William Eagle Clarke in 1913, is a mainly sedentary (non-migratory) form found in the Outer Hebrides and Isle of Skye in Scotland, and western Ireland. It is the darkest subspecies, with a dark brown back, greyish rump, pale buff background colour to the underparts and grey-tinged flanks.

&quot;T. p. clarkei&quot;, described by German zoologist Ernst Hartert in 1909, and named after William Eagle Clarke, breeds in the rest of Great Britain and Ireland and on mainland Europe in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and possibly somewhat further east. It has brown upperparts which are warmer in tone than those of the nominate form, an olive-tinged rump and rich yellow background colour to the underparts. It is a partial migrant with some birds wintering in southern France and Iberia. This form intergrades with the nominate subspecies in central Europe, and with &quot;T. p. hebridensis&quot; in the Inner Hebrides and western Scotland, and in these areas birds show intermediate characteristics. Finally, &quot;T. p. nataliae&quot;, described by the Russian Sergei Buturlin in 1929, occurs in the east of the range in Siberia east of the Ural Mountains.

==Description==
The song thrush (as represented by the nominate subspecies &quot;T. p. philomelos&quot;) is in length and weighs . The sexes are similar, with plain brown backs and neatly black-spotted cream or yellow-buff underparts, becoming paler on the belly. The underwing is warm yellow, the bill is yellowish and the legs and feet are pink. The upperparts of this species become colder in tone from west to east across the breeding range from Sweden to Siberia. The juvenile resembles the adult, but has buff or orange streaks on the back and wing coverts.

The most similar European thrush species is the redwing (&quot;T. iliacus&quot;), but that bird has a strong white supercilium, red flanks, and shows a red underwing in flight. The mistle thrush (&quot;T. viscivorus&quot;) is much larger and has white tail corners, and the Chinese thrush (&quot;T. mupinensis&quot;), although much more similar in plumage, has black face markings and does not overlap in range.

The song thrush has a short, sharp &quot;tsip&quot; call, replaced on migration by a thin high &quot;seep&quot;, similar to the redwing&#x27;s call but shorter. The alarm call is a &quot;chook-chook&quot; becoming shorter and more strident with increasing danger. The male&#x27;s song, given from trees, rooftops or other elevated perches, is a loud clear run of musical phrases, repeated two to four times, &quot;filip filip filip codidio codidio quitquiquit tittit tittit tereret tereret tereret&quot;, and interspersed with grating notes and mimicry. It is given mainly from February to June by the Outer Hebridean race, but from November to July by the more widespread subspecies. For its weight, this species has one of the loudest bird calls.

An individual male may have a repertoire of more than 100 phrases, many copied from its parents and neighbouring birds. Mimicry may include the imitation of man-made items like telephones, and the song thrush will also repeat the calls of captive birds, including exotics such as the white-faced whistling duck.

==Distribution and habitat==

The song thrush breeds in most of Europe (although not in the greater part of Iberia, lowland Italy or southern Greece), and across Ukraine and Russia almost to Lake Baikal. It reaches to 75°N in Norway, but only to about 60°N in Siberia. Birds from Scandinavia, Eastern Europe and Russia winter around the Mediterranean, North Africa and the Middle East, but only some of the birds in the milder west of the breeding range leave their breeding areas.

In Great Britain song thrushes are commonly found where there are trees and bushes. Such areas include parks, gardens, coniferous and deciduous woodland and hedgerows.

Birds of the subspecies &quot;T. p. clarkei&quot; were introduced to New Zealand and Australia by acclimatisation societies between 1860 and 1880, apparently for purely sentimental reasons. In New Zealand, where it was introduced on both the main islands, the song thrush quickly established itself and spread to surrounding islands such as the Kermadecs, Chatham and Auckland Islands. Although it is common and widespread in New Zealand, in Australia only a small population survives around Melbourne. In New Zealand, there appears to be a limited detrimental effect on some invertebrates due to predation by introduced bird species, and the song thrush also damages commercial fruit crops in that country. As an introduced species it has no legal protection in New Zealand, and can be killed at any time.

The song thrush typically nests in forest with good undergrowth and nearby more open areas, and in western Europe also uses gardens and parks. It breeds up to the tree-line, reaching in Switzerland. The island subspecies &quot;T. p. hebridensis&quot; breeds in more open country, including heathland, and in the east of the song thrush&#x27;s Eurasian range, the nominate subspecies is restricted to the edge of the dense conifer forests.

In intensively farmed areas where agricultural practices appear to have made cropped land unsuitable, gardens are an important breeding habitat. In one English study, only 3.5% of territories were found in farmland, whereas gardens held 71.5% of the territories, despite that habitat making up only 2% of the total area. The remaining nests were in woodlands (1% of total area).

The winter habitat is similar to that used for breeding, except that high ground and other exposed localities are avoided; however, the island subspecies &quot;T. p. hebridensis&quot; will frequent the seashore in winter.

==Behaviour and ecology==

The song thrush is not usually gregarious, although several birds may roost together in winter or be loosely associated in suitable feeding habitats, perhaps with other thrushes such as the blackbird, fieldfare, redwing and dark-throated thrush. Unlike the more nomadic fieldfare and redwing, the song thrush tends to return regularly to the same wintering areas.

This is a monogamous territorial species, and in areas where it is fully migratory, the male re-establishes its breeding territory and starts singing as soon as he returns. In the milder areas where some birds stay year round, the resident male remains in his breeding territory, singing intermittently, but the female may establish a separate individual wintering range until pair formation begins in the early spring.

During migration, the song thrush travels mainly at night with a strong and direct flight action. It flies in loose flocks which cross the sea on a broad front rather than concentrating at short crossings (as occurs in the migration of large soaring birds), and calls frequently to maintain contact. Migration may start as early as late August in the most easterly and northerly parts of the range, but the majority of birds, with shorter distances to cover, head south from September to mid-December. However, hard weather may force further movement. Return migration varies between mid-February around the Mediterranean to May in northern Sweden and central Siberia. Vagrants have been recorded in Greenland, various Atlantic islands, and West Africa.

===Breeding and survival===

The female song thrush builds a neat cup-shaped nest lined with mud and dry grass in a bush, tree or creeper, or, in the case of the Hebridean subspecies, on the ground. She lays four or five bright glossy blue eggs which are lightly spotted with black or purple; they are typically size and weigh , of which 6% is shell. The female incubates the eggs alone for 10–17 days, and after hatching a similar time elapses until the young fledge. Two or three broods in a year is normal, although only one may be raised in the north of the range. On average, 54.6% of British juveniles survive the first year of life, and the adult annual survival rate is 62.2%. The typical lifespan is three years, but the maximum recorded age is 10 years 8 months.
The song thrush is occasionally a host of parasitic cuckoos, such as the common cuckoo, but this is very rare because the thrush recognizes the cuckoo&#x27;s non-mimetic eggs. However, the song thrush does not demonstrate the same aggression toward the adult cuckoo that is shown by the blackbird. The introduced birds in New Zealand, where the cuckoo does not occur, have, over the past 130 years, retained the ability to recognise and reject non-mimetic eggs.

Adult birds may be killed by cats, little owls and sparrowhawks, and eggs and nestlings are taken by magpies, jays, and, where present, grey squirrels. As with other passerine birds, parasites are common, and include endoparasites, such as the nematode &quot;Splendidofilaria (Avifilaria) mavis&quot; whose specific name &quot;mavis&quot; derives from this thrush. A Russian study of blood parasites showed that all the fieldfares, redwings and song thrushes sampled carried haematozoans, particularly &quot;Haemoproteus&quot; and &quot;Trypanosoma&quot;. &quot;Ixodes&quot; ticks are also common, and can carry pathogens, including tick-borne encephalitis in forested areas of central and eastern Europe and Russia, and, more widely, &quot;Borrelia&quot; bacteria. Some species of &quot;Borrelia&quot; cause Lyme disease, and ground-feeding birds like the song thrush may act as a reservoir for the disease.

===Feeding===
The song thrush is omnivorous, eating a wide range of invertebrates, especially earthworms and snails, as well as soft fruit and berries. Like its relative, the blackbird, the song thrush finds animal prey by sight, has a run-and-stop hunting technique on open ground, and will rummage through leaf-litter seeking potential food items.

Land snails are an especially important food item when drought or hard weather makes it hard to find other food. The thrush often uses a favorite stone as an &quot;anvil&quot; on which to break the shell of the snail before extracting the soft body and invariably wiping it on the ground before consumption. Young birds initially flick objects and attempt to play with them until they learn to use anvils as tools to smash snails. The nestlings are mainly fed on animal food such as worms, slugs, snails and insect larvae.

The grove snail (&quot;Cepaea nemoralis&quot;) is regularly eaten by the song thrush, and its polymorphic shell patterns have been suggested as evolutionary responses to reduce predation; however, song thrushes may not be the only selective force involved.

==Status and conservation==

The song thrush has an extensive range, estimated at , and a large population, with an estimated 40 to 71 million individuals in Europe alone.

In the western Palaearctic, there is evidence of population decline, but at a level below the threshold required for global conservation concern (i.e., a reduction in numbers of more than 30% in ten years or three generations) and the IUCN Red List categorises this species as of &quot;Least Concern&quot;. In Great Britain and the Netherlands, there has been a more than 50% decline in population, and the song thrush is included in regional Red Lists. The decreases are greatest in farmlands (73% since the mid-1970s) and believed to be due to changes in agricultural practices in recent decades. The precise reasons for the decline are not known but may be related to the loss of hedgerows, a move to sowing crops in autumn rather than spring, and possibly the increased use of pesticides. These changes may have reduced the availability of food and of nest sites. In gardens, the use of poison bait to control slugs and snails may pose a threat. In urban areas, some thrushes are killed while using the hard surface of roads to smash snails.

==Relationship with humans==

The song thrush&#x27;s characteristic song, with melodic phrases repeated twice or more, is described by the nineteenth-century British poet Robert Browning in his poem &quot;Home Thoughts, from Abroad&quot;:

That&#x27;s the wise thrush; he sings each song twice over,
Lest you should think he never could recapture
The first fine careless rapture!

The song also inspired the nineteenth-century British writer Thomas Hardy, who spoke in &quot;Darkling Thrush&quot; of the bird&#x27;s &quot;full-hearted song evensong/Of joy illimited&quot;, but twentieth-century British poet Ted Hughes in &quot;Thrushes&quot; concentrated on its hunting prowess: &quot;Nothing but bounce and/stab/and a ravening second&quot;. Nineteenth-century Welsh poet Edward Thomas wrote 15 poems concerning blackbirds or thrushes, including &quot;The Thrush&quot;:

I hear the thrush, and I see
Him alone at the end of the lane
Near the bare poplar&#x27;s tip,
Singing continuously.

In &quot;The Tables Turned&quot;, Romantic poet William Wordsworth references the song thrush, writing

Hark, how blithe the throstle sings
And he is no mean preacher
Come forth into the light of things
Let Nature be your teacher
The song thrush is the emblem of West Bromwich Albion Football Club, chosen because the public house in which the team used to change kept a pet thrush in a cage. It also gave rise to Albion&#x27;s early nickname, &quot;The Throstles&quot;. A few English pubs and hotels share the name &quot;Throstles Nest&quot;.

===As food===
Thrushes have been trapped for food from as far back as 12,000 years ago and an early reference is found in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;: &quot;Then, as doves or thrushes beating their spread wings against some snare rigged up in thickets—flying in for a cosy nest but a grisly bed receives them.&quot; Hunting continues today around the Mediterranean, but is not believed to be a major factor in this species&#x27; decline in parts of its range.

In Spain, this species is normally caught as it migrates through the country, often using birdlime which, although banned by the European Union, is still tolerated and permitted in the Valencian Community. In 2003 and 2004 the EU tried, but failed, to stop this practice in the Valencian region.

===As pets===
Up to at least the nineteenth century the song thrush was kept as a cage bird because of its melodious voice. As with hunting, there is little evidence that the taking of wild birds for aviculture has had a significant effect on wild populations.

<text>Edward Everett Horton Jr. (March 18, 1886 – September 29, 1970) was an American character actor. He had a long career in film, theater, radio, television, and voice work for animated cartoons.

==Early life==
Horton was born March 18, 1886, on Long Island to Edward Everett Horton, a typesetter / compositor in the press room for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and his wife, Isabella S. (née Diack) Horton. His father was of English and German ancestry, and his mother was born in Matanzas Province, Cuba, to George and Mary (née Orr) Diack, natives of Scotland. He first attended the old Boys&#x27; High School in Brooklyn. The family then moved to Baltimore, Maryland and he went to The Baltimore City College. He attended in 1902-1904 and later was inducted into the school&#x27;s alumni/faculty Hall of Fame in 1959.

He was a student at Oberlin College where he majored in German. He was asked to leave after he climbed to the top of a building and, after a crowd gathered, threw off a dummy, making them think he had jumped. Returning to New York City, he attended the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn for one year, until the school discontinued its arts courses; he moved to Columbia University, &quot;until I got fouled up with &quot;The Varsity Show of 1909&quot;. This was the first time I had really ever been on the stage ... After that, to put it gently, Columbia and I came to an amicable parting of the ways. They were just as glad to see me go as I was to get out.&quot; That concluded Horton&#x27;s collegiate period.

==Stage and film career==

Horton had begun his stage career at age 20 in 1906, singing and dancing and playing small parts in productions during his brief college experiences, then vaudeville and Broadway productions. His father persuaded him to adopt his full name professionally. &quot;Originally, I went under the name of just Edward Horton. My father said, &#x27;I think you&#x27;re making a mistake, Edward. Anybody could be Edward Horton, but nobody else could be Edward Everett Horton.&#x27; I said, &#x27;I think I like that.&#x27;&quot;

In 1919, he moved to Los Angeles, where he got his start at the Hollywood Community Theater, founded and managed by Neely Dickson. He began acting in Hollywood films of the growing film community in southern California. His first starring role was in the silent film comedy &quot;Too Much Business&quot; (1922), and he portrayed the lead role of an idealistic young classical music composer in the comedy &quot;Beggar on Horseback&quot; (1925). In 1927–29, he starred in eight two-reel silent comedies produced by Harold Lloyd for Paramount Pictures release. He made the transition to sound films with Educational Pictures in 1929, in a series of sound-comedy playlets. As a stage-trained performer, he found more film work easily and appeared in several Warner Bros. movies, including &quot;The Terror&quot; (1928) and &quot;Sonny Boy&quot; (1929).

Horton soon cultivated his own special variation of the double take (an actor&#x27;s reaction to something, followed by a delayed, more extreme reaction). In Horton&#x27;s version, he smiled ingratiatingly and nodded in agreement with what just happened; then, when realization set in, his facial features collapsed entirely into a sober, troubled mask.

As Horton became known for his performances in movies, he continued to work on the legitimate stage, which he preferred. He appeared with Gavin Gordon in a 1931 production of &quot;Private Lives&quot; by Noël Coward.

Horton starred in many comedy features in the 1930s, usually playing a mousy fellow who put up with domestic or professional problems to a certain point and then finally asserted himself for a happy ending. He is best remembered, however, for his work in supporting roles. These include &quot;The Front Page&quot; (1931), &quot;Trouble in Paradise&quot; (1932), &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1933), &quot;The Gay Divorcee&quot; (1934, the first of several Astaire/Rogers films in which Horton appeared), &quot;Top Hat&quot; (1935), &quot;Biography of a Bachelor Girl&quot; (1935), &quot;Danger - Love at Work&quot; (1937), &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; (1937), &quot;Holiday&quot; (1938), &quot;Here Comes Mr. Jordan&quot; (1941), &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot; (1944), &quot;Pocketful of Miracles&quot; (1961), &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963), and &quot;Sex and the Single Girl&quot; (1964). His last role was in the comedy film &quot;Cold Turkey&quot; (1971), in which his character communicated only through facial expressions.

Horton continued to appear in stage productions, often in summer stock. His performance in the play &quot;Springtime for Henry&quot; became a perennial in summer theaters.

Horton was so prolific he sometimes found himself committed to two projects at the same time. One project would be in progress while the second project suddenly came up sooner than expected, forcing Horton to make other arrangements. In 1953, Horton announced on the ABC-TV game show &quot;The Name&#x27;s the Same&quot; that his next picture would be one of the &quot;Ma and Pa Kettle&quot; comedies. A scheduling conflict compelled Horton to bow out, and his role in &quot;Ma and Pa Kettle at Home&quot; was played by Alan Mowbray.

In 1960, Horton was approached by his former director Frank Capra to work in the new film &quot;Pocketful of Miracles&quot;. Horton wanted to rejoin Capra, but had a commitment to finish a stage run of the play &quot;Once Upon a Mattress&quot;; the show wouldn&#x27;t be closing for another two weeks. Horton phoned Buster Keaton, who had played the same role in an earlier production, and asked if Keaton could replace him. Keaton finished the play&#x27;s run, and Horton made the Capra film.

In late 1963 Edward Everett Horton joined the national touring company of the Broadway hit &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot;, alongside co-stars Jerry Lester, Arnold Stang, and Erik Rhodes. The show ran eleven months.

==Radio and television==
From 1945 to 1947, Horton hosted radio&#x27;s &quot;Kraft Music Hall&quot;. An early television appearance came in the play &quot;Sham&quot;, shown on &quot;The Chevrolet Tele-Theatre&quot; on December 13, 1948. During the 1950s, Horton worked primarily in television. One of his best-remembered appearances is in an episode of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, broadcast in 1952, in which he is cast against type as a frisky, amorous suitor. In 1960, he guest-starred on &quot;The Real McCoys&quot; as J. Luther Medwick, grandfather of the boyfriend of series character Hassie McCoy (Lydia Reed). In the story, Medwick clashes with the equally outspoken Grandpa Amos McCoy (played by Walter Brennan).

He remains, however, best known to younger Saturday-morning-television viewers of the &quot;baby boomers&quot; generation (born after World War II era, 1946-1964) as the venerable narrator of &quot;Fractured Fairy Tales&quot; segments with the retelling of earlier famous fairy tales and legends from previous centuries on &quot;The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show&quot; animation / cartoon program (1959–1961), an American animated / cartoon television series that originally aired from November 19, 1959, to June 27, 1964.

In 1962, he portrayed the character Uncle Ned in three episodes of &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;. In 1965, he guest-starred in an episode of &quot;The Cara Williams Show&quot;. He also played occasionally in two memorable TV shows from the 1960s as the medicine man, &quot;Roaring Chicken&quot; of the neighboring non-hostile peace-loving but cowardly Hekawi Indian tribe, decked out in beaded / fringed deerskin native Indian garb, in &quot;F Troop&quot; (1965-1967). This spoof Western / U.S. Cavalry comedy series set after the American Civil War era also starring troopers Forrest Tucker, Ken Berry and Larry Storch at fictional Fort Courage. He echoed this funny Indian role, portraying a &quot;Chief Screaming Chicken&quot;, on the 1966-1968 TV show version of &quot;Batman&quot; two years later, as a pawn to another guest villain portrayed by Vincent Price&#x27;s &quot;Egghead&quot;.

==Personal life==
Horton never discussed his private life publicly, but in 1968 he granted an interview to writers Bernard Rosenberg and Harry Silverstein in which he reviewed his life and career, punctuated by self-effacing remarks (&quot;Nobody&#x27;s older than I am. Oh, a few people are, but they are not in circulation&quot;). Published in 1970, the interview only skims through his personal relationships. Horton recalled that, rather than dating or nightclubbing, he would invite his female co-stars to attend parties he was throwing. &quot;I never married. However, I have not given up hope. This is Leap Year [1968], you know.&quot;

==Death and legacy==
Horton died of cancer on September 29, 1970, at age 84 in the Encino area of Los Angeles, and his remains were interred in the Whispering Pines section of Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery.

At the time of his death, Horton had lived on the property at 5521 Amestoy Avenue for 45 years, since purchasing the four-acre estate in 1925 which he named Belleigh Acres. The land contained Horton&#x27;s own house and several adjacent houses for his brother and sister, and their respective families. F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote The Last Tycoon while living in one of the estate&#x27;s guest houses in 1938.

In the 1950s, the state forced Horton to sell a portion of his property for construction of the Ventura Freeway. The construction left a short stump of Amestoy Avenue south of Burbank Boulevard, and shortly after his death the City of Los Angeles renamed that portion of the avenue Edward Everett Horton Lane in his honor.

British radio DJ and comedian Kenny Everett adopted the last name of Everett in honor of Horton, who was a childhood hero of his.

For his contribution to the Hollywood motion picture industry, Horton has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6427 Hollywood Boulevard.

<doc id="184836" wikidata="Q26641" url="?curid=184836" title="Ring ouzel">
<text>The ring ouzel (Turdus torquatus) is a mainly European member of the thrush family Turdidae. It is a medium-sized thrush, in length and weighing . The male is predominantly black with a conspicuous white crescent across its breast. Females are browner and duller than males, and young birds may lack the pale chest markings altogether. In all but the northernmost part of its range, this is a high-altitude species, with three races breeding in mountains from Ireland east to Iran. It breeds in open mountain areas with some trees or shrubs, the latter often including heather, conifers, beech, hairy alpenrose or juniper. It is a migratory bird, leaving the breeding areas to winter in southern Europe, North Africa and Turkey, typically in mountains with juniper bushes. The typical clutch is 3–6 brown-flecked pale blue or greenish-blue eggs. They are incubated almost entirely by the female, with hatching normally occurring after 13 days. The altricial, downy chicks fledge in another 14 days and are dependent on their parents for about 12 days after fledging.

The ring ouzel is omnivorous, eating invertebrates, particularly insects and earthworms, some small vertebrates, and a wide range of fruit. Most animal prey is caught on the ground. During spring migration and the breeding season, invertebrates dominate the adult&#x27;s diet and are also fed to the chicks. Later in the year, fruit becomes more important, particularly the common juniper.

With an extensive range and a large population, the ring ouzel is evaluated as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). There are signs of decline in several countries; suspected causes including climate change, human disturbance, hunting and outdoor leisure activities. Loss of junipers may also be a factor in some areas. Natural hazards include predation by mammalian carnivores and birds of prey, and locally there may also be competition from other large thrushes such as the common blackbird, mistle thrush and fieldfare.

==Etymology==
&quot;Ouzel&quot; is an old name for the common blackbird, the word being cognate with the German . &quot;Ouzel&quot; may also be applied to a group of superficially similar but more distantly related birds, the dippers, the European representative of which is sometimes known as the water ouzel. &quot;Ring Ouzel&quot; was first used by John Ray in his 1674 &quot;Collection of English Words not Generally Used&quot; and became established with his 1678 book &quot;The Ornithology of Francis Willughby of Middleton in the County of Warwick&quot;. As with the English term, the scientific name also refers to the male&#x27;s prominent white neck crescent, being derived from the Latin words , &quot;thrush&quot;, and , &quot;collared&quot;. Old and local names for the ring ouzel include &quot;fell blackbird&quot;, &quot;hill blackbird&quot;, &quot;moor blackbird&quot;, &quot;rock ouzel&quot; and &quot;mountain blackbird&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The ring ouzel was first described by Carl Linnaeus under its current scientific name in his 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He noted earlier descriptions by Francis Willughby and Eleazar Albin, both of whom gave it the name &quot;Merula torquata&quot;.

There are about 85 species of medium to large thrushes in the genus &quot;Turdus&quot;. They are characterised by rounded heads, medium or longish pointed wings, and usually melodious songs.

A 2020 study of the genetics of &quot;Turdus&quot; suggested that the genus arose about 9.37 million years ago (Mya), expanding out of Africa around 7.2 Mya, and diverging into Palearctic and Oriental groups about 5.7 Mya. Further radiation from Africa to the Americas followed at about 5.3 Mya. Details of the study suggest that the ring ouzel, a member of the Eurasian group, may be more closely related to Naumann&#x27;s and dusky thrushes than to the superficially more similar common blackbird.

===Subspecies===
The ring ouzel has three recognised subspecies: The northern ring ouzel, &quot;Turdus torquatus torquatus&quot; Linnaeus (1758) is the nominate subspecies (the subspecies that repeats the name of the species). It breeds across western and northern Europe from Ireland through Scandinavia to northwest Russia and winters in southern Europe and northwest Africa. The Alpine ring ouzel, &quot;T. t. alpestris&quot; Brehm, C L (1831) breeds in mountain ranges from Iberia through southern and central Europe to the Balkans, Greece and western Turkey, and also in North Africa. It winters in North Africa, southern Europe and southern Turkey. The Caucasian ring ouzel, &quot;T. t. amicorum&quot; Hartert E (1923) breeds in central and eastern Turkey east to Turkmenistan, and winters mainly in Iran and parts of Iraq. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA samples from across Europe suggests that this species had a much broader distribution after the Last Glacial Period that ended about 11,700 years ago than it does now.

==Description==
The ring ouzel is in length and weighs . The plumage of the male of the nominate race is entirely black except for a conspicuous white crescent on the breast, narrow greyish scaling on the upperparts and belly and pale edges to the wing feathers. The bill is yellow and the legs are greyish brown. The female resembles the male but is browner and with a duller breast band. Juveniles are like the female, but with a faint or non-existent breast crescent.

The pale breast marking makes adults of this species unmistakeable; first-winter males also sometimes show a pale crescent. Other young ouzels can be confused with the common blackbird, but always show a paler wing panel than that species.

Males of &quot;T. t. alpestris&quot; have broader white scalloping (repeated small curves) on their underparts than &quot;T. t. torquatus&quot;, giving a distinctly scaly appearance below. The wing panel is also paler than in the nominate subspecies. Females are much as the nominate race, but with broad white fringes on the chin and throat. Males of &quot;T. t. amicorum&quot; have the largest and whitest breast band of the three subspecies, and the broader white edges and tips of the wing feathers form a distinctive whitish panel in the wing. Females have narrow white fringes on their underparts. Adult ring ouzels undergo a complete moult after breeding from late June to early September, before their autumn migration. Juveniles have a partial moult between July and September, replacing their head, body and wing covert feathers.

===Voice===
The male ring ouzel sings from a low perch or occasionally in flight. The song consists of a repetition of 2–4 plaintive fluty notes, &quot;, , &quot; with pauses between repeats. The call is a loud &#x27;, becoming harsher if the bird is alarmed. The contact call is a soft &#x27; in flight. Males sing most frequently at dawn and sunset.

==Distribution and habitat==
The ring ouzel breeds discontinuously across western and northern Europe from north-west Ireland through Scandinavia to northwest Russia, and in mountains across central southern Europe from the Pyrenees through the Alps, the Balkans, Greece and Turkey east to Turkmenistan. In 2014, breeding was recorded on the Timan Ridge, Arkhangelsk Oblast, about further east than previously known breeding sites in north Russia.

The species is migratory, birds leaving the breeding areas in September and October. Birds of the nominate subspecies winter in southern Spain and northwest Africa. Central European populations of &quot;T. t. alpestris&quot; move to higher elevations initially before moving south or southwest through the Swiss Alps; some two weeks later migrants of the nominate form pass through the same area to winter in the south of the breeding range or around the Mediterranean. Eastern &quot;alpestris&quot; ouzels migrate through the Balkans and Turkey. &quot;T. t. amoricus&quot; moves south to Egypt and neighbouring areas. The return migration is mainly in March and April, the males arriving some days before the females. Northern breeders arrive later, and in the mountains, some birds may ascend in stages as the snow melts. Many birds stop off at traditional well-grazed grassland locations in both spring and autumn.

The ring ouzel is extinct in Latvia and occurs only on migration in Denmark. It is a passage migrant in Syria and a vagrant to Iceland, Jordan, the Arabian Peninsula, Sudan, Kazakhstan, Mauritania, Svalbard and Jan Mayen. In the Atlantic, it is a regular winter visitor to the Canary Islands but a rarity in the Azores and Madeira.

In middle latitudes, the ring ouzel is a bird of continental mountains, but in the north of its range, it is found in coastal uplands. It can cope with wind and rain but avoids ice and snow. Nominate &quot;T. t. torquatus&quot; is usually found on open moorland with a few stunted trees above , and reaching in Scotland and northern Europe. In Switzerland, ring ouzels breed on rugged upland slopes with heather, conifers, beech or hairy alpenrose at , although in Turkey birds are found from sea level to . In Armenia and the Caucasus, it occupies similar steep habitat with conifer stands, rhododendron thickets, and juniper scrub and shrub, from sea level to .

In northwest Africa ring ouzels winter in juniper forest at , often near rivers or ponds. On migration, ouzels may occur on coastal grassland and steep hillsides with short, unsown wild grass and sparse scrub.

==Behaviour==
The ring ouzel is territorial and normally seen alone or in pairs, although loose flocks may form on migration. When not breeding, several birds may be loosely associated in good feeding areas, such as a fruiting tree, often with other thrushes such as song thrushes or redwings. The ouzel&#x27;s flight is direct, and birds often perch on rocks or heather clumps.

===Breeding===
Ring ouzels nest from mid-April to mid-July in the Alps and the British Isles, and from May to August in Scandinavia. Territories may be strung out along streams, apart and the ranges may overlap, but this species does not form breeding colonies. The nest, built by the female, is a cup of leaves, dry grass and other plant material consolidated with mud. In the west of the range nests are almost always built on the ground, but &quot;T. t. alpestris&quot; may also nest in a small tree or scrub at an average height of .

The clutch is 3–6 pale blue or greenish-blue eggs flecked with reddish-brown. The eggs are in size and weigh of which 6% is shell. Incubation is almost always by the female, hatching typically occurring after 13 days. The altricial, downy chicks fledge in another 14 days. The young are dependent on their parents for about 12 days after fledging.

Adults breed after their first year and their average lifespan is two years, although nine years has been recorded. There may be two broods, especially in the south of the range, although triple-brooding is rare. This species is philopatric, returning to the same area to breed each year. Around 36% of juveniles survive their first year, while the annual survival rate for adults is 47% for males and 37% for females. The main causes of death in northwest Europe are predation (9%), accidental human-related incidents (10%), and hunting, mainly in France (77%).

===Diet===
The ring ouzel is omnivorous, eating a wide range of insects, earthworms, small amphibians and reptiles and fruit. Most animal prey is caught on the ground.

During spring migration and the breeding season, invertebrates dominate the diet, and include earthworms, beetles flies, ants, spiders and snails. Later in the year, fruit becomes more important, including bramble, strawberry, cherry, hawthorn, rowan and juniper. Where it is available common juniper makes up more than 90% of the ring ouzel&#x27;s winter diet, with arthropods constituting most of the rest. As a result, the ring ouzel is an important vector for dispersing the juniper&#x27;s seeds, and is key to the dispersal of the endemic Canary Islands juniper.

The young are mainly fed invertebrates, caterpillars and earthworms being major items where available. Although birds migrating in autumn use similar habitat to that used in spring, seasonal berries make up most of their diet, particularly elderberries, haws and, where available, juniper berries.

==Predators and parasites==
Predators of the ring ouzel include the tawny owl, long-eared owl, common buzzard, common kestrel and Eurasian sparrowhawk, least weasel and stoat. Most deaths are of young juveniles, and birds hatched early in the season are more likely to survive than later broods. A Scottish study showed that raptors were responsible for 59% of deaths and mammals for 27%. In Romania, eggs were taken by red squirrels and spotted nutcrackers. As with other &quot;Turdus&quot; thrushes, the ring ouzel is rarely a host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite. If the thrush&#x27;s nest cup is too deep for the cuckoo to evict the host&#x27;s chicks, the young cuckoo cannot successfully compete for food with the fast-growing host species&#x27; chicks, and if the cuckoo does manage to expel its nest-mates, the parents are reluctant to feed it; either way, the young cuckoo will starve.

A study in the Carpathian Mountains found that a significant proportion of ring ouzels carried trombiculid mites, commonly known as chiggers. These mites commonly infect ground-feeding birds, and heavy infestations can cause birds to lose condition and stop feeding. The hard-bodied tick &quot;Ixodes festai&quot; commonly parasitises thrushes, including the ring ouzel. There is a record of this species carrying a &quot;Haemoproteus &quot; blood parasite.

==Status and conservation==
The ring ouzel has an extensive range, estimated at , and a large population, estimated at 600,000–2 million individuals in Europe (which comprises 95% of the breeding range). The species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criteria of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as least concern. The breeding population in Europe was estimated to be 299,000–598,000 pairs in 2019.

There are signs of decline in several countries. Its decline
in Ireland in recent years has been striking, with regular breeding now confined to two counties. Suspected causes include climate change, human disturbance, hunting and outdoor leisure activities. Loss of junipers may be a factor in southern Spain and north-west Africa, as may upland forestation in the UK. There may also be competition from larger thrushes like the common blackbird, mistle thrush and fieldfare. A Scottish study suggested that sites at higher altitudes and with a good cover of heather were less likely to have been deserted by breeding ring ouzels than lower or more open locations.

In the Alps, the density of breeding pairs can reach but is generally much lower with in Haute-Savoie, in the Jura Mountains, and in more open habitats in Britain.

<text>An agape feast, or lovefeast, is a term used for various communal meals shared among Christians. The name comes from the Greek word (), which implies divine love. 

Agape meals originated in the early Church and were a time of fellowship for believers. The Eucharist was a part of the lovefeast in the earliest times, although at some point (probably between the latter part of the 1st century AD and 250 AD), the two became separate. Thus, in modern revivals of this tradition, terms such as &quot;Lovefeast&quot; refer to meals distinct from the Eucharist. Such lovefeasts, celebrated within the Eastern Orthodox tradition and also in pietistic traditions, seek to strengthen fraternal bonds between parishioners.

The practice of sharing an agape meal is mentioned in of the Christian Bible and has been said to be a &quot;common meal of the early church&quot;. References to communal meals are found in and in Saint Ignatius of Antioch&#x27;s Letter to the Smyrnaeans, where the term &quot;agape&quot; is used, and in a letter from Pliny the Younger to Trajan, (ca. 111 AD) in which he reported that the Christians, after having met &quot;on a stated day&quot; in the early morning to &quot;address a form of prayer to Christ, as to a divinity&quot;, would &quot;reassemble, to eat in common a harmless meal&quot; later in the day. Similar communal meals are also mentioned in the Coptic tradition–often identified as the Apostolic tradition attributed to Hippolytus of Rome, who does not use the term &quot;agape–&quot;and in works of Tertullian, who does. The connection between such substantial meals and the Eucharist had virtually ceased by the time of Cyprian (who died 258 AD), when the Eucharist was celebrated with fasting in the morning and the agape in the evening. The Synod of Gangra in 340 AD makes mention of lovefeasts in relation to a heretic who had barred his followers from attending them.

Although still mentioned in the Quinisext Council of 692 AD, the agape feast fell into disuse soon after, except among the churches in Ethiopia and India. At the end of the 18th century, the Carmelite friar Paolino da San Bartolomeo reported that the ancient Saint Thomas Christians of India still celebrated the &quot;lovefeast&quot;, using their typical dish called appam. In addition, Radical Pietist groups originating in the eighteenth century, such as the Schwarzenau Brethren and the Moravian Church, celebrate the lovefeast. Methodist churches also continue the practice.

Similar practices have been revived or created more recently among other groups, including Anglicans, as well as the American house church movement. The lovefeast has often been used in ecumenical settings, such as between Methodists and Anglicans.

==History==
===Early Christianity===
The earliest reference to a meal of the type referred to as &quot;agape&quot; is in Paul the Apostle&#x27;s First Epistle to the Corinthians, although the term can only be inferred vaguely from its prominence in 1 Cor 13. Many New Testament scholars hold that the Christians of Corinth met in the evening and had a common meal including sacramental action over bread and wine. indicates that the rite was associated with participation in a meal of a more general character. It apparently involved a full meal, with the participants bringing their own food but eating in a common room. Perhaps predictably enough, it could at times deteriorate into merely an occasion for eating and drinking, or for ostentatious displays by the wealthier members of the community, as happened in Corinth, drawing the criticisms of Paul: 

&quot;I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it. No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God&#x27;s approval. When you come together, it is not the Lord&#x27;s Supper you eat, for as you eat, each of you goes ahead without waiting for anybody else. One remains hungry, another gets drunk. Don&#x27;t you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing?&quot;

The term &quot;agape&quot; (ἀγάπη) is also used in reference to meals in and in a few manuscripts of .

Soon after the year 100 AD, Ignatius of Antioch refers to the agape feast. In Letter 97 to Trajan in 112 AD, Pliny the Younger mentions that Christians are known to assemble for a common meal which may be the agape meal: The rescheduling of the agape meal was triggered by Corinthian selfishness and gluttony. Tertullian too seems to write of these meals, though what he describes is not quite clear.

Clement of Alexandria (c. 150–211/216 AD) distinguished so-called agape meals of luxurious character from the &quot;agape&quot; (love) &quot;which the food that comes from Christ shows that we ought to partake of&quot;. Accusations of gross indecency were sometimes made against the more indulgent banquets. Referring to Clement of Alexandria&#x27;s &quot;Stromata&quot; (III, 2), Philip Schaff commented: &quot;The early disappearance of the Christian &quot;agapæ&quot; may probably be attributed to the terrible abuse of the word here referred to, by the licentious Carpocratians. The genuine &quot;agapæ&quot; were of apostolic origin (2 Pet. ii. 13; Jude 12), but were often abused by hypocrites, even under the apostolic eye (1 Corinthians 11:21). In the Gallican Church, a survival or relic of these feasts of charity is seen in the &quot;pain béni&quot;; and, in the Eastern Orthodox Church in the (&quot;antidoron&quot;) or &quot;eulogiæ&quot;, also known as &quot;prosphora&quot; distributed to non-communicants at the close of the Divine Liturgy (Eucharist), from the loaf out of which the Lamb (Host) and other portions have been cut during the Liturgy of Preparation.&quot;

Augustine of Hippo also objected to meals in his native North Africa, typically in funerary or commemorative settings, in which some indulged to the point of drunkenness, and he distinguished them from proper celebration of the Eucharist: &quot;Let us take the body of Christ in communion with those with whom we are forbidden to eat even the bread which sustains our bodies.&quot; He reports that even before the time of his stay in Milan, the custom had already been forbidden there.

Canons 27 and 28 of the Council of Laodicea (364) restricted the abuses of taking home part of the provisions and of holding the meals in churches. The Third Council of Carthage (393) and the Second Council of Orléans (541) reiterated the prohibition of feasting in churches, and the Trullan Council of 692 decreed that honey and milk were not to be offered on the altar (Canon 57), and that those who held love feasts in churches should be excommunicated (Canon 74).

The ancient Saint Thomas Christians of India continued to celebrate their agapa feasts, using their typical dish called appam.

===Medieval Georgia===
In the medieval Georgian Orthodox Church, the term &quot;agapi&quot; referred to a commemorative meal or distribution of victuals, offered to clergymen, the poor, or passers-by, accompanying the funeral service on the anniversary of the deceased. The permanent celebration of these meals was assured by legacies and foundations.

===Reformation===
After the Protestant Reformation there was a move amongst some groups of Christians to try to return to the practices of the New Testament Church. One such group was the Schwarzenau Brethren (1708) who counted a Love Feast consisting of feet washing, the agape meal, and the Eucharist among their &quot;outward yet sacred&quot; ordinances. Another was the Moravians led by Count Zinzendorf who adopted a form consisting of the sharing of a simple meal, and then testimonies or a devotional address were given and letters from missionaries read.

John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, travelled to America in the company of Moravians and greatly admired their faith and practice. After his conversion in 1738 he introduced the Love Feast to what became known as the Methodist movement. Due to the lack of ordained ministers within Methodism, the Love Feast took on a life of its own, as there were very few opportunities to take Holy Communion. As such, the Primitive Methodists celebrated the Love Feast, before it lessened in the nineteenth century as the revival cooled.

==Practice by denomination==
=== Oriental Orthodox ===
At least some of the Oriental Orthodox churches continue the tradition of this meal, including the Saint Thomas Christians of India. Their Lovefeasts are attended by individuals who travel great distances for it, and are presided over by a priest. They are often held when a new priest is ordained, and those in attendance bring gifts for him. The Ethiopian Orthodox Church has also continued to celebrate the agape feast, which is held every Saturday, and many Coptic Orthodox churches celebrate it as well.

=== Brethren ===
The Schwarzenau Brethren groups (the largest being the Church of the Brethren) regularly practice agape feasts (called &quot;Love Feasts&quot;), which include feetwashing, a supper, and communion, with hymns and brief scriptural meditations interspersed throughout the worship service.

Groups that descend from the Schwarzenau Brethren such as the Church of the Brethren, Brethren Church, Old German Baptist Brethren, and Dunkard Brethren regularly practice a Lovefeast based on New Testament descriptions of the Last Supper of Christ. The Grace Brethren, an offshoot of the Schwarzenau Brethren, also practices the lovefeast. The Brethren combine the Agape meal (often consisting of lamb or beef and a bowl of soup) with a service of feetwashing before the meal and communion afterward. The term &quot;Lovefeast&quot; in this case generally refers to all three ordinances, not just the meal. Influenced by German Radical Pietists during the early eighteenth century, the Lovefeast was instituted among Brethren before Moravians adopted the practice.

===Moravian ===

The lovefeast of the Moravian Church is based on the Agape feast and the meals of the early churches described in the Bible in the Acts of the Apostles, which were partaken in unity and love. Traditionally for European, Canadian, and American lovefeasts, a sweetened bun and coffee (sweetened milky tea in Germany, the Netherlands, and England) is served to the congregation in the pews by &quot;dieners&quot; (from the German for &#x27;servers&#x27;); before partaking, a simple table grace is said. The foods and drinks consumed by the congregation may vary according what is available. Services in some Colonial-era lovefeasts, for example, used plain bread and water.

The Moravian lovefeast also concentrates on the singing of hymns and listening to music, which may come from the organ or choir. The songs and hymns chosen usually describe love and harmony. The congregation can talk quietly with their fellow brothers and sisters in Christ about their spiritual walk with God. Christmas Eve lovefeasts can become particularly spectacular in the congregation&#x27;s choice of music and instrumentation. Many churches have trombone choirs or church bands play before a lovefeast as a call to service.

A Moravian congregation may hold a lovefeast on any special occasion, such as the date their church was founded, but there are certain established dates that Lovefeasts are regularly observed. Some of these notable dates include New Year&#x27;s Eve (on which the Watchnight service is observed), Good Friday, the Festival of 13 August (the 1727 date on which the Moravian Church was renewed), and Christmas Eve, where each member of the congregation receives a lighted candle at the end of the service in addition to the bun and coffee.

=== Methodist ===

Methodists also practice lovefeasts, often quarterly, as well as on the evenings of major feast days. They are also held during camp meetings. In Methodist theology, lovefeasts are a &quot;means of grace&quot; and &quot;converting ordinance&quot; that John Wesley believed to be an apostolic institution. One account from July 1776 expounded on attendees&#x27; experiences of new birth and entire sanctification at a lovefeast:
The liturgy for a &quot;lovefeast&quot; traditionally includes the following elements:
In certain Methodist connexions, such as the Missionary Methodist Church and the New Congregational Methodist Church, footwashing is practiced too.

In the Wesleyan Methodist Church, lovefeasts consisted of bread and water that filled the loving-cup. These lovefeasts were said to &quot;promote piety, mutual affection and zeal&quot;. Unlike the Eucharist in the Methodist tradition, lovefeasts are traditionally fenced, being only for members of Methodist churches, though non-members are permitted to attend once. Several Methodist hymns were written for this Christian ritual, including Charles Wesley&#x27;s &quot;The Love-Feast&quot;, penned in 1740:
The Christian liturgical books of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, Christian Methodist Episcopal Church, and United Methodist Church all have services for the Lovefeast.

Congregations of the Primitive Methodist Church hold Lovefeasts in the form of large potluck-style meals among members of their congregations.

¶108 of the &quot;Discipline&quot; of the Evangelical Wesleyan Church states that &quot;A Love feast shall be held on each circuit at least once in three months. It shall ordinarily consist of bread-breaking, praise, and testimony.&quot;

¶244 of the &quot;Discipline&quot; of the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection stipulates that one of the duties of pastors is &quot;to hold love-feasts&quot;.

=== Eastern Orthodox ===
A number of Eastern Orthodox Christian parishes will have an agape meal (Turkish: &quot;sevgi ziyafeti&quot;), commonly known as coffee hour (Spanish: &quot;café comunitario&quot;), on Sundays and feast days following the Divine Liturgy, and especially at the conclusion of the Paschal Vigil.

=== Roman Catholic ===
The agape is a common feature used by the Catholic Neocatechumenal Way in which members of the Way participate in a light feast after the celebration of the Eucharist on certain occasions. Otherwise, there is a strong tradition of love-feasts only occasionally called &quot;agape&quot; and with a lot of local specifics: Big festivals, like a parish&#x27;s patron saint or Corpus Christi, are usually celebrated with a parish festival with a lot of food and drink. Otherwise, while Americans have a &quot;coffee and doughnuts&quot; tradition after the Sunday Mass, and while the early-morning Rorate Mass is usually followed by a communal breakfast, most parishes restrict themselves to attend, as a group, a local restaurant, café or pub. A holy hour, for instance, is usually followed by a &quot;happy hour&quot;. (This is also where the German Frühschoppen tradition comes from.) Probably the principal way to celebrate the love-feast (usually without doing so intentionally) is the festive Sunday family dinner.

=== Adventist ===
The Creation Seventh Day Adventists partake of an agape feast as a part of their New Moon observances, taking the form of a formal, all-natural meal held after the communion supper.

<text>Triggerfish are about 40 species of often brightly colored marine ray-finned fishes belonging to the family Balistidae. Often marked by lines and spots, they inhabit tropical and subtropical oceans throughout the world, with the greatest species richness in the Indo-Pacific. Most are found in relatively shallow, coastal habitats, especially at coral reefs, but a few, such as the oceanic triggerfish (&quot;Canthidermis maculata&quot;), are pelagic. While several species from this family are popular in the marine aquarium trade, they are often notoriously ill-tempered.

==Taxonomy==
The triggerfish family, Balistidae. was first proposed in 1810 by the French polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque. The closest relatives to the triggerfishes are the filefishses belonging to the family Monacanthidae and these two families are sometimes classified together in the suborder Balistoidei, for example in the 5th edition of &quot;Fishes of the World&quot;. Other authorities. however, also include the families Aracanidae and Ostraciidae within the suborder Balistoidei.

==Etymology==
Triggerfish have both a common name and a scientific name that refers to the first spine of the dorsal fin being locked in place by the erection of the shorter second trigger spine, and unlocked by depressing the second spine. In the scientific name of the type genus &quot;Balistes&quot; this is taken directly from the Italian &quot;pesca ballista&quot;, the &quot;crossbow fish&quot;. &quot;Ballista&quot; originally being a machine for throwing arrows.

==Anatomy and appearance==
The largest member of the family, the stone triggerfish (&quot;Pseudobalistes naufragium&quot;) reaches , but most species have a maximum length between . Triggerfish appear to have grown to even larger sizes in the geologic past, with the extinct fossil species &quot;Balistes crassidens&quot; and &quot;Balistes vegai&quot;, both from the Miocene of the Caribbean, potentially reaching up to , making them the largest triggerfishes known to have ever existed.

Triggerfish have an oval-shaped, highly compressed body. The head is large, terminating in a small but strong-jawed mouth with teeth adapted for crushing shells. The eyes are small, set far back from the mouth, at the top of the head. The anterior dorsal fin is reduced to a set of three spines. The first spine is stout and by far the longest. All three are normally retracted into a groove. Characteristic of the order Tetraodontiformes, the anal and posterior dorsal fins are capable of undulating from side to side to provide slow movement and comprise their primary mode of propulsion. The sickle-shaped caudal fin is used only to escape predators.

The two pelvic fins are overlaid by skin for most of their length and fused to form a single spine, terminated by very short rays, their only external evidence. Gill plates (opercula), although present, are also not visible, overlaid by the tough skin, covered with rough, rhomboid scales that form a stout armor on their bodies. The only gill opening is a vertical slit, directly above the pectoral fins. This peculiar covering of the gill plates is shared with other members of the Tetradontae. Each jaw contains a row of four teeth on either side, while the upper jaw contains an additional set of six plate-like pharyngeal teeth.

As a protection against predators, triggerfish can erect the first two dorsal spines: The first (anterior) spine is locked in place by erection of the short second spine, and can be unlocked only by depressing the second, &quot;trigger&quot; spine, hence the family name &quot;triggerfish&quot;.

With the exception of a few species from the genus &quot;Xanthichthys&quot;, the sexes of all species in this family are similar in appearance.

==Genera and species==
The following fossil genera are also known:

* †&quot;Balistomorphus&quot; - Early Oligocene of Switzerland
* †&quot;Gornylistes&quot; - Middle Eocene (Bartonian) of the North Caucasus, Russia
* †&quot;Oligobalistes&quot; - Early Oligocene of the North Caucasus, Russia

==Behavior==
The anatomy of the triggerfish reflects its typical diet of slow-moving, bottom dwelling crustaceans, mollusks, sea urchins and other echinoderms, generally creatures with protective shells and spines. Many will also take small fishes and some, notably the members of the genus &quot;Melichthys&quot;, feed on algae. A few, for example the redtoothed triggerfish (&quot;Odonus niger&quot;), mainly feed on plankton. They are known to exhibit a high level of intelligence for a fish, and have the ability to learn from previous experiences.

Some triggerfish species can be quite aggressive when guarding their eggs. Both the Picasso (&quot;Rhinecanthus aculeatus&quot;) and titan triggerfish (&quot;Balistoides viridescens&quot;) viciously defend their nests against intruders, including scuba divers and snorkelers. Their territory extends in a cone from the nest toward the surface, so swimming upwards can put a diver further into the fishes&#x27; territory; a horizontal swim away from the nest site is best when confronted by an angry triggerfish. Unlike the relatively small Picasso triggerfish, the titan triggerfish poses a serious threat to inattentive divers due to its large size and powerful teeth.

===Male territoriality===

Triggerfish males migrate to their traditional spawning sites prior to mating and establish territories. Some male species (i.e.&quot; Balistes carolinensis&quot; and &quot;Pseudobalistes flavimarginatus&quot;) build hollow nests within their territories. Triggerfish males are fierce in guarding their territories as having a territory is essential for reproduction. A male&#x27;s territory is used for spawning and parental care. Most male territories are located over a sandy sea bottom or on a rocky reef. A single territory usually includes more than one female, and the male mates with all of the females residing in or visiting his territory (polygyny). In Hachijojima, Izu Islands, Japan, one male crosshatch triggerfish (&quot;Xanthichthys mento&quot;) has up to three females in his territory at the same time, and mates with them in pairs. Each male red-toothed triggerfish (&quot;Odonus niger&quot;) mates with more than 10 females in his territory on the same day. Yellow margin triggerfish (&quot;Pseudobalistes flavimarginatus&quot;) also exhibit polygyny.

===Spawning and biparental care===
Triggerfish spawning is timed in relation to lunar cycles, tides, and time of changeover of tides. In relation to lunar cycles, eggs are observed 2–6 days before the full moon and 3–5 days before the new moon. In relation to tides, spawning happens 1–5 days before the spring tide. In relation to timing of tides, eggs are observed on days when high tides take place around sunset.

Male and female triggerfish perform certain prespawning behaviors: blowing and touching. A male and female blow water on the sandy bottom (usually in the same spot at the same time) and set up their egg site. They touch their abdomens on the bottom as if they are spawning. During actual spawning, eggs are laid on the sandy sea bottom (triggerfish are demersal spawners despite their large size). Eggs are scattered and attached to sand particles. Triggerfish eggs are usually very small (diameter of 0.5–0.6 mm) and are easily spread by waves. After spawning, both the male and female participate in caring for the fertilized eggs (biparental egg care). A female triggerfish stays near the spawning ground, around 5 m off the bottom, and guards the eggs within her territory against intruders. Some common intruders include &quot;Parupeneus multifasciatus, Zanclus cornutus, Prionurus scalprum&quot;, and conspecifics. Besides guarding, females roll, fan, and blow water on eggs to provide oxygen to the embryos, thereby inducing hatching. This behavior of female triggerfish is called &quot;tending&quot;, and males rarely perform this behavior. A male triggerfish stays farther above the eggs and guards all the females and eggs in his territory. Males exhibit aggressive behaviors against conspecific males near the boundaries of their territories.

===Mating systems===

In crosshatch triggerfish (&quot;Xanthichthys mento&quot;) and yellow margin triggerfish (&quot;Pseudobalistes flavimarginatus&quot;), eggs are spawned in the morning and they hatch after the sunset on the same day. After hatching of embryos, the female crosshatch triggerfish leaves the male&#x27;s territory. This mating system is an example of male-territory-visiting polygamy. Triggerfishes exhibit other types of mating systems, as well, such as a nonterritorial-female (NTF) polygyny and territorial-female (TF) polygyny. In NTF polygyny, nonterritorial females stay in the male&#x27;s territory and reproduce. In TF polygyny, a female owns territory within a male&#x27;s territory and will spawn in her territory.

==Life history==
Triggerfish lay their demersal eggs in a small hole dug in the sea bottom. Off Florida, juveniles of some species of triggerfishes are found in floating &quot;Sargassum&quot;, where they feed on the small shrimp, crabs, and mollusks found there.

==Edibility==
Some species of triggerfish, such as the titan triggerfish, may be ciguatoxic and should be avoided. Others, however, such as the grey triggerfish (&quot;Balistes capriscus&quot;), are edible.

<doc id="184843" wikidata="Q643236" url="?curid=184843" title="Henry VI, Part 1">
<text>Henry VI, Part 1, often referred to as 1 Henry VI, is a history play by William Shakespeare—possibly in collaboration with Thomas Nashe and others—believed to have been written in 1591. It is set during the lifetime of King Henry VI of England.

&quot;Henry VI, Part 1&quot; deals with the loss of England&#x27;s French territories and the political machinations leading up to the Wars of the Roses, as the English political system is torn apart by personal squabbles and petty jealousy. &quot;Henry VI, Part 2&quot; deals with the King&#x27;s inability to quell the bickering of his nobles and the inevitability of armed conflict and &quot;Henry VI, Part 3&quot; deals with the horrors of that conflict.

Although the &quot;Henry VI&quot; trilogy may not have been written in chronological order, the three plays are often grouped together with &quot;Richard III&quot; to form a tetralogy covering the entire Wars of the Roses saga, from the death of Henry V in 1422 to the rise to power of Henry VII in 1485. It was the success of this sequence of plays that firmly established Shakespeare&#x27;s reputation as a playwright.

Some regard &quot;Henry VI, Part 1&quot; as the weakest of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. Along with &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;, it is generally considered one of the strongest candidates for evidence that Shakespeare collaborated with other dramatists early in his career.

==Synopsis==

The play begins with the funeral of Henry V, who has died unexpectedly in his prime. As his brothers, the Dukes of Bedford and Gloucester, and his uncle, the Duke of Exeter, lament his passing and express doubt as to whether his son (the as yet uncrowned heir apparent Henry VI) is capable of running the country in such tumultuous times, word arrives of military setbacks in France. A rebellion, led by the Dauphin Charles, is gaining momentum, and several major towns have already been lost. Additionally, Lord Talbot, Constable of France, has been captured. Realising a critical time is at hand, Bedford immediately prepares himself to head to France and take command of the army, Gloucester remains in charge in England, and Exeter sets out to prepare young Henry for his forthcoming coronation.

Meanwhile, in Orléans, the English army is laying siege to Charles&#x27; forces. Inside the city, the Bastard of Orléans approaches Charles and tells him of a young woman who claims to have seen visions and knows how to defeat the English. Charles summons the woman, Joan la Pucelle (i.e. Joan of Arc). To test her resolve, he challenges her to single combat. Upon her victory, he immediately places her in command of the army. Outside the city, the newly arrived Bedford negotiates the release of Talbot, but immediately, Joan launches an attack. The French forces win, forcing the English back, but Talbot and Bedford engineer a sneak attack on the city, and gain a foothold within the walls, causing the French leaders to flee.

Back in England, a petty quarrel between Richard Plantagenet and the Duke of Somerset has expanded to involve the whole court. Richard and Somerset ask their fellow nobles to pledge allegiance to one of them, and as such the lords select either red or white roses to indicate the side they are on. Richard then goes to see his uncle, Edmund Mortimer, imprisoned in the Tower of London. Mortimer tells Richard the history of their family&#x27;s conflict with the king&#x27;s family—how they helped Henry Bolingbroke seize power from Richard II, but were then shoved into the background; and how Henry V had Richard&#x27;s father (Richard of Conisburgh) executed and his family stripped of all its lands and monies. Mortimer also tells Richard that he himself is the rightful heir to the throne, and that when he dies, Richard will be the true heir, not Henry. Amazed at these revelations, Richard determines to attain his birthright, and vows to have his family&#x27;s dukedom restored. After Mortimer dies, Richard presents his petition to the recently crowned Henry, who agrees to reinstate the Plantagenet&#x27;s title, making Richard 3rd Duke of York. Henry then leaves for France, accompanied by Gloucester, Exeter, Winchester, Richard and Somerset.

In France, within a matter of hours, the French retake and then lose the city of Rouen. After the battle, Bedford dies, and Talbot assumes direct command of the army. The Dauphin is horrified at the loss of Rouen, but Joan tells him not to worry. She then persuades the powerful Duke of Burgundy, who had been fighting for the English, to switch sides, and join the French. Meanwhile, Henry arrives in Paris and upon learning of Burgundy&#x27;s betrayal, he sends Talbot to speak with him. Henry then pleads for Richard and Somerset to put aside their conflict, and, unaware of the implications of his actions, he chooses a red rose, symbolically aligning himself with Somerset and alienating Richard. Prior to returning to England, in an effort to secure peace between Somerset and Richard, Henry places Richard in command of the infantry and Somerset in command of the cavalry. Meanwhile, Talbot approaches Bordeaux, but the French army swings around and traps him. Talbot sends word for reinforcements, but the conflict between Richard and Somerset leads them to second guess one another, and neither of them send any, both blaming the other for the mix-up. The English army is subsequently destroyed, and both Talbot and his son are killed.

After the battle, Joan&#x27;s visions desert her, and she is captured by Richard and burned at the stake. At the same time, urged on by Pope Eugenius IV and the Holy Roman Emperor, Sigismund, Henry sues for peace. The French listen to the English terms, under which Charles is to be a viceroy to Henry and reluctantly agree, but only with the intention of breaking their oath at a later date and expelling the English from France. Meanwhile, the Earl of Suffolk has captured a young French princess, Margaret of Anjou, whom he intends to marry to Henry in order that he can dominate the king through her. Travelling back to England, he attempts to persuade Henry to marry Margaret. Gloucester advises Henry against the marriage, as Margaret&#x27;s family is not rich and the marriage would not be advantageous to his position as king. But Henry is taken in by Suffolk&#x27;s description of Margaret&#x27;s beauty, and he agrees to the proposal. Suffolk then heads back to France to bring Margaret to England as Gloucester worryingly ponders what the future may hold.

==Sources==

Shakespeare&#x27;s primary source for &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; was Edward Hall&#x27;s &quot;The Union of the Two Noble and Illustre Families of Lancaster and York&quot; (1548). Also, as with most of Shakespeare&#x27;s chronicle histories, Raphael Holinshed&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles of England, Scotland and Ireland&quot; (1577; 2nd edition 1587) was also consulted. Holinshed based much of his Wars of the Roses information in the &quot;Chronicles&quot; on Hall&#x27;s information in &quot;Union of the Two Noble and Illustre Families&quot;, even to the point of reproducing large portions of it verbatim. However, there are enough differences between Hall and Holinshed to establish that Shakespeare must have consulted both of them.

For example, Shakespeare must have used Hall for the scene where Gloucester is attempting to gain access to the Tower, and Woodville tells him that the order not to admit anyone came from Winchester. Dismayed, Gloucester refers to Winchester as &quot;that haughty prelate,/Whom Henry, our late sovereign, ne&#x27;re could brook&quot; (1.3.23–24). Only in Hall is there any indication that Henry V had a problem with Winchester. In Holinshed, there is nothing to suggest any disagreement or conflict between them. Another example of Shakespeare&#x27;s use of Hall is found when Sir Thomas Gargrave is injured by the artillery strike at Orléans (1.5). In the play, he dies immediately, and the rest of the scene focuses on the death of the more senior soldier Salisbury. Likewise, in Hall, Gargrave dies immediately after the attack. In Holinshed, however, Gargrave takes two days to die (as he did in reality). The semi-comic scene where the French leaders are forced to flee Orléans half-dressed (dramatised in 2.1) also seems based on an incident reported only in Hall. When discussing the English retaking of Le Mans in 1428, Hall writes, &quot;The French, suddenly taken, were so amazed in so much that some of them, being not out of their beds, got up in their shirts.&quot; Another incident involving Gloucester and Winchester is also unique to Hall. During their debate in Act 3, Scene 1, Gloucester accuses Winchester of attempting to have him assassinated on London Bridge. Hall mentions this assassination attempt, explaining that it was supposed to have taken place at the Southwark end of the bridge in an effort to prevent Gloucester from joining Henry V in Eltham Palace. In Holinshed however, there is no reference to any such incident. Another incident possibly taken from Hall is found in Act 3, Scene 2, where Joan and the French soldiers disguise themselves as peasants and sneak into Rouen. This is not an historical event, and it is not recorded in either Hall or Holinshed. However, a very similar such incident &quot;is&quot; recorded in Hall, where he reports of the capture of Cornhill Castle in Cornhill-on-Tweed by the English in 1441.
On the other hand, some aspects of the play are unique to Holinshed. For example, in the opening scene, as word arrives in England of the rebellion in France, Exeter says to his fellow peers, &quot;Remember, Lords, your oaths to Henry sworn:/Either to quell the Dauphin utterly,/Or bring him in obedience to your yoke&quot; (1.1.162–164). Only in Holinshed is it reported that on his deathbed, Henry V elicited vows from Bedford, Gloucester and Exeter that they would never willingly surrender France, and would never allow the Dauphin to become king. Another piece of information unique to Holinshed is seen when Charles compares Joan to the Old Testament prophetess Deborah (1.2.105). According to Judges 4 and 5, Deborah masterminded Barak&#x27;s surprise victory against the Canaanite army led by Sisera, which had suppressed the Israelites for over twenty years. No such comparison is found in Hall. Another piece of information unique to Holinshed occurs when the Master Gunner mentions that the English have taken control of some of the suburbs of Orléans (1.4.2). Holinshed reports that the English captured several of the suburbs on the other side of the Loire, something not found in Hall.

==Date and text==

===Date===
The most important evidence for dating &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; is the &quot;Diary of Philip Henslowe&quot;, which records a performance of a play by Lord Strange&#x27;s Men called &quot;Harey Vj&quot; (i.e. &quot;Henry VI&quot;) on 3 March 1592 at the Rose Theatre in Southwark. Henslowe refers to the play as &quot;ne&quot; (which most critics take to mean &quot;new&quot;, although it could be an abbreviation for the Newington Butts theatre, which Henslow may have owned) and mentions that it had fifteen performances and earned £3.16s.8d, meaning it was extremely successful. &quot;Harey Vj&quot; is usually accepted as being &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; for a couple of reasons. Firstly, it is unlikely to have been either &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; or &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, as they were published in 1594 and 1595, respectively, with the titles under which they would have originally been performed, so as to ensure higher sales. As neither of them appear under the title &quot;Harey Vj&quot;, the play seen by Henslowe is unlikely to be either of them. Additionally, as Gary Taylor points out, Henslowe tended to identify sequels, but not first parts, to which he referred by the general title. As such, &quot;&quot;Harey Vj&quot; could not be a &quot;Part Two&quot; or &quot;Part Three&quot; but could easily be a &quot;Part One&quot;.&quot; The only other option is that &quot;Harey Vj&quot; is a now lost play.

That &quot;Harey Vj&quot; is &quot;not&quot; a lost play, however, seems to be confirmed by a reference in Thomas Nashe&#x27;s &quot;Piers Penniless his Supplication to the Devil&quot; (entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register on 8 August 1592), which supports the theory that &quot;Harey Vj&quot; is &quot;1 Henry VI&quot;. Nashe praises a play that features Lord Talbot: &quot;How would it have joyed brave Talbot (the terror of the French), to think that after he had lain two hundred years in his tomb, he should triumph again on the stage, and have his bones new embalmed with the tears of ten thousand spectators (at least), who in the tragedian that represents his person imagine they behold him fresh bleeding.&quot; It is thought that Nashe is here referring to &quot;Harey Vj&quot;, i.e. &quot;1 Henry VI&quot;, as there is no other candidate for a play featuring Talbot from this time period (although again, there is the slight possibility that both Henslowe &quot;and&quot; Nashe are referring to a now lost play).

If Nashe&#x27;s comment is accepted as evidence that the play seen by Henslowe was &quot;1 Henry VI&quot;, to have been on stage as a new play in March 1592, it must have been written in 1591.

There is a separate question concerning the date of composition, however. Due to the publication in March 1594 of a quarto version of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; (under the title &quot;The First part of the Contention betwixt the two famous Houses of Yorke and Lancaster, with the death of the good Duke Humphrey: And the banishment and death of the Duke of Suffolke, and the Tragicall end of the proud Cardinal of Winchester, with the notable Rebellion of Jack Cade: and the Duke of Yorke&#x27;s first claim unto the crowne&quot;) and an octavo version of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; in 1595 (under the title &quot;The True Tragedie of Richard Duke of Yorke, and the death of good King Henrie the Sixt, with the Whole Contention betweene the two Houses, Lancaster and Yorke&quot;), neither of which refer to &quot;1 Henry VI&quot;, some critics have argued that &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; and &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; were written prior to &quot;1 Henry VI&quot;. This theory was first suggested by E.K. Chambers in 1923 and revised by John Dover Wilson in 1952. The theory is that &quot;The Contention&quot; and &quot;True Tragedy&quot; were originally conceived as a two-part play, and due to their success, a prequel was created. Obviously, the title of &quot;The Contention&quot;, where it is referred to as &quot;The First Part&quot; is a large part of this theory, but various critics have offered further pieces of evidence to suggest &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; was not the first play written in the trilogy. R.B. McKerrow, for example, argues that &quot;if &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; was originally written to continue the first part, it seems utterly incomprehensible that it should contain no allusion to the prowess of Talbot.&quot; McKerrow also comments on the lack of reference to the symbolic use of roses in &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;, whereas in &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; and &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, they are mentioned numerous times. McKerrow concludes that this suggests &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; was written closer to &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, and as we know &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; was definitely a sequel, it means that &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; must have been written last, i.e., Shakespeare only conceived of the use of the roses while writing &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; and then incorporated the idea into his prequel. Eliot Slater comes to the same conclusion in his statistical examination of the vocabulary of all three &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays, where he argues that &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; was written either immediately before or immediately after &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, hence it must have been written last. Likewise, Gary Taylor, in his analysis of the authorship of &quot;1 Henry VI&quot;, argues that the many discrepancies between &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; and &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; (such as the lack of reference to Talbot) coupled with similarities in the vocabulary, phraseology, and tropes of &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; and &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, suggest &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; was probably written last.

One argument against this theory is that &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; is the weakest of the trilogy, and therefore, logic would suggest it was written first. This argument suggests that Shakespeare could only have created such a weak play if it was his first attempt to turn his chronicle sources into drama. In essence, he was unsure of his way, and as such, &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; was a trial-run of sorts, making way for the more accomplished &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; and &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;. Emrys Jones is one notable critic who supports this view. The standard rebuke to this theory, and the one used by Dover Wilson in 1952, is that &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; is significantly weaker than the other two plays not because it was written first but because it was co-authored and may have been Shakespeare&#x27;s first attempt to collaborate with other writers. As such, all of the play&#x27;s problems can be attributed to its co-authors rather than Shakespeare himself, who may have had a relatively limited hand in its composition. In this sense, the fact that &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; is the weakest of the trilogy has nothing to do with &quot;when&quot; it may have been written, but instead concerns only &quot;how&quot; it was written.

As this implies, there is no critical consensus on this issue. Samuel Johnson, writing in his 1765 edition of &quot;The Plays of William Shakespeare&quot;, pre-empted the debate and argued that the plays were written in sequence: &quot;It is apparent that [&quot;2 Henry VI&quot;] begins where the former ends, and continues the series of transactions, of which it presupposes the first part already written. This is a sufficient proof that the second and third parts were not written without dependence on the first.&quot; Numerous more recent scholars continue to uphold Johnson&#x27;s argument. E. M. W. Tillyard, for example, writing in 1944, believes the plays were written in order, as does Andrew S. Cairncross in his editions of all three plays for the 2nd series of the &quot;Arden Shakespeare&quot; (1957, 1962 and 1964). E.A.J. Honigmann also agrees, in his &quot;early start&quot; theory of 1982 (which argues that Shakespeare&#x27;s first play was &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;, which Honigmann posits was written in 1586). Likewise, Michael Hattaway, in both his 1990 &quot;New Cambridge Shakespeare&quot; edition of &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; and his 1991 edition of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;, argues that the evidence suggests &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; was written first. In his 2001 introduction to &quot;Henry VI: Critical Essays&quot;, Thomas A. Pendleton makes a similar argument, as does Roger Warren in his 2003 edition of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; for the &quot;Oxford Shakespeare&quot;.

On the other hand, Edward Burns, in his 2000 &quot;Arden Shakespeare&quot; 3rd series edition of &quot;1 Henry VI&quot;, and Ronald Knowles, in his 1999 &quot;Arden Shakespeare&quot; 3rd series edition of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;, make the case that &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; probably preceded &quot;1 Henry VI&quot;. Similarly, Randall Martin, in his 2001 &quot;Oxford Shakespeare&quot; edition of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, argues that &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; was almost certainly written last. In his 2003 &quot;Oxford&quot; edition of &quot;1 Henry VI&quot;, Michael Taylor agrees with Martin. Additionally, it is worth noting that in the &quot;Oxford Shakespeare: Complete Works&quot; of 1986 and the 2nd edition of 2005, and in the &quot;Norton Shakespeare&quot; of 1997 and again in 2008, both &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; and &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; precede &quot;1 Henry VI&quot;.

Ultimately, the question of the order of composition remains unanswered, and the only thing that critics &quot;can&quot; agree on is that all three plays (in whatever order) were written by early 1592 at the latest.

===Text===
The text of the play was not published until the 1623 &quot;First Folio&quot;, under the title &quot;The first part of Henry the Sixt&quot;.

When it came to be called &quot;Part 1&quot; is unclear, although most critics tend to assume it was the invention of the &quot;First Folio&quot; editors, John Heminges and Henry Condell, as there are no references to the play under the title &quot;Part 1&quot;, or any derivative thereof, prior to 1623.

==Analysis and criticism==

===Critical history===
Some critics argue that the &quot;Henry VI&quot; trilogy were the first plays based on recent English history, and, as such, they deserve an elevated position in the canon and a more central role in Shakespearean criticism. According to F. P. Wilson, for example, &quot;There is no certain evidence that any dramatist before the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 dared to put upon the public stage a play based upon English history [...] so far as we know, Shakespeare was the first.&quot; However, not all critics agree with Wilson here. For example, Michael Taylor argues that there were at least thirty-nine history plays prior to 1592, including the two-part Christopher Marlowe play &quot;Tamburlaine&quot; (1587), Thomas Lodge&#x27;s &quot;The Wounds of Civil War&quot; (1588), the anonymous &quot;The Troublesome Reign of King John&quot; (1588), &quot;Edmund Ironside&quot; (1590 – also anonymous), Robert Green&#x27;s &quot;Selimus&quot; (1591) and another anonymous play, &quot;The True Tragedy of Richard III&quot; (1591). Paola Pugliatti however argues that the case may be somewhere between Wilson and Taylor&#x27;s argument: &quot;Shakespeare may not have been the first to bring English history before the audience of a public playhouse, but he was certainly the first to treat it in the manner of a mature historian rather than in the manner of a worshipper of historical, political and religious myth.&quot;

Another issue often discussed amongst critics is the quality of the play. Along with &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; has traditionally been seen as one of Shakespeare&#x27;s weakest works, with critics often citing the amount of violence as indicative of Shakespeare&#x27;s artistic immaturity and inability to handle his chronicle sources, especially when compared to the more nuanced and far less violent second historical tetralogy (&quot;Richard II&quot;, &quot;1 Henry IV&quot;, &quot;2 Henry IV&quot; and &quot;Henry V&quot;). For example, critics such as E. M. W. Tillyard, Irving Ribner and A. P. Rossiter have all claimed that the play violates neoclassical precepts of drama, which dictate that violence and battle should never be shown mimetically on stage, but should always be reported diegetically in dialogue. This view was based on traditional notions of the distinction between high and low art, a distinction based partly upon Philip Sidney&#x27;s &quot;An Apology for Poetry&quot; (1579). Based on the work of Horace, Sidney criticised Thomas Norton and Thomas Sackville&#x27;s &quot;Gorboduc&quot; (1561) for showing too many battles and being too violent when it would have been more artistic to verbally represent such scenes. The belief was that any play that &quot;showed&quot; violence was crude, appealing only to the ignorant masses, and was therefore low art. On the other hand, any play that elevated itself above such direct representation of violence and instead relied on the writer&#x27;s ability to verbalise and his skill for diegesis, was considered artistically superior and, therefore, high art. Writing in 1605, Ben Jonson commented in &quot;The Masque of Blackness&quot; that showing battles on stage was only &quot;for the vulgar, who are better delighted with that which pleaseth the eye, than contenteth the ear.&quot; Based upon these theories, &quot;1 Henry VI&quot;, with its numerous on-stage skirmishes and multiple scenes of violence and murder, was considered a coarse play with little to recommend it to the intelligentsia.

On the other hand, however, writers like Thomas Heywood and Thomas Nashe praised battle scenes in general as often being intrinsic to the play and not simply vulgar distractions for the illiterate. In &quot;Piers Penniless&quot; (1592), Nashe praised the didactic element of drama that depicted battle and martial action, arguing that such plays were a good way of teaching both history and military tactics to the masses; in such plays &quot;our forefather&#x27;s valiant acts (that have lain long buried in rusty brass and worm-eaten books) are revived.&quot; Nashe also argued that plays that depict glorious national causes from the past rekindle a patriotic fervour that has been lost in &quot;the puerility of an insipid present,&quot; and that such plays &quot;provide a rare exercise of virtue in reproof to these degenerate effeminate days of ours.&quot; Similarly, in &quot;An Apology for Actors&quot; (1612), Heywood writes, &quot;So bewitching a thing is lively and well-spirited action, that it hath power to new mould the hearts of the spectators, and fashion them to the shape of any noble and notable attempt.&quot; More recently, Michael Goldman has argued that battle scenes are vital to the overall movement and purpose of the play; &quot;the sweep of athletic bodies across the stage is used not only to provide an exciting spectacle but to focus and clarify, to render dramatic, the entire unwieldy chronicle.&quot;

Questions of originality and quality, however, are not the only critical disagreement &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; has provoked. Numerous other issues divide critics, not the least of which concerns the authorship of the play.

====Attribution studies====
A number of Shakespeare&#x27;s early plays have been examined for signs of co-authorship (&quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, &quot;The Contention&quot; [i.e., &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;], and &quot;True Tragedy&quot; [i.e., &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;], for example), but, along with &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;, &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; stands as the most likely to have been a collaboration between Shakespeare and at least one other dramatist whose identity remains unknown. Thomas Nashe, Robert Greene, George Peele, Christopher Marlowe and Thomas Kyd are common proposals.

The belief that Shakespeare may have written very little of &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; first came from Edmond Malone in his 1790 edition of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, which included &quot;A Dissertation on the Three Parts of King Henry VI&quot;, in which he argued that the large number of classical allusions in the play was more characteristic of Nashe, Peele, or Greene than of early Shakespeare. Malone also argued that the language itself indicated someone other than Shakespeare. This view was dominant until 1929, when Peter Alexander challenged it. Since then, scholars have remained divided on the issue. In 1944, E. M. W. Tillyard argued that Shakespeare most likely wrote the entire play; in 1952, John Dover Wilson claimed Shakespeare wrote little of it.

In perhaps the most exhaustive analysis of the debate, the 1995 article, &quot;Shakespeare and Others: The Authorship of &quot;Henry the Sixth, Part One&quot;&quot;, Gary Taylor suggests that approximately 18.7% of the play (3,846 out of 20,515 words) was written by Shakespeare. Taylor argues that Nashe almost certainly wrote all of Act 1, but he attributes to Shakespeare 2.4, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4., 4.5, 4.6, and 4.7 through line 32. Taylor also suggests that the Temple Garden scene (2.4), in which the rival factions identify themselves through the selection of red and white roses, may have been a later addition. Scenes 4.5 to 4.7 include a series of rhyming couplets between Talbot and his son (4.5.15–4.7.50), which, while unusual to modern ears, apparently had &quot;an electric effect upon early audiences.&quot; Traditionally, these lines have often been pinpointed as one of the most obviously non-Shakespearean sections of the play. Roger Warren, for instance, argues that these scenes are written in a language &quot;so banal they &quot;must&quot; be non-Shakespearean.&quot;

Other than Taylor, however, several other critics also disagree with Warren&#x27;s assessment of the quality of the language, arguing that the passages are more complex and accomplished than has hitherto been allowed for. Michael Taylor, for example, argues that &quot;the rhyming dialogue between the Talbots – often stichomythic – shapes a kind of noble flyting match, a competition as to who can out-&quot;oblige&quot; the other.&quot; Similarly, Alexander Leggatt argues that the passages are a perfect blend of form and content: &quot;The relentless click-click of the rhymes reinforces the point that for John Talbot, all arguments are arguments for death; as every other line ending is countered by a rhyme, so every argument Talbot gives John to flee becomes an argument for staying.&quot; Taylor and Leggatt are here arguing that the passages are more accomplished than most critics tend to give them credit for, thus offering a counter-argument to the theory that they are so poorly written, they could not possibly be by Shakespeare. In this sense, his failure to use couplets elsewhere in a tragic passage can thus be attributed to an aesthetic choice on his part, rather than offered as evidence of co-authorship.

Other scenes in the play have also been identified as offering possible evidence of co-authorship. For example, the opening lines of Act 1, Scene 2 have been argued to show clear evidence of Nashe&#x27;s hand. The scene begins with Charles proclaiming, &quot;Mars his true moving – even as in the heavens/So in the earth – to this day is not known&quot; (I.ii.1–2). Some critics believe that this statement is paraphrased in Nashe&#x27;s later pamphlet &quot;Have with You to Saffron-Walden&quot; (1596), which contains the line, &quot;You are as ignorant as the astronomers are in the true movings of Mars, which to this day, they never could attain to.&quot; The problem with this theory however, as Michael Hattaway has pointed out, is that there is no reason as to why Nashe could not simply be paraphrasing a play he had no involvement in—a common practice in Elizabethan literature. Shakespeare and Marlowe, for example, often paraphrased each other&#x27;s plays.

Nasheeb Sheehan offers more evidence, again suggestive of Nashe, when Alençon compares the English to &quot;Samsons and Goliases&quot; (I.ii.33). The word &#x27;Golias&#x27;, Sheehan argues, is unusual insofar as all bibles in Shakespeare&#x27;s day spelt the name &#x27;Goliath&#x27;; it was only in much older editions of the Bible that it was spelt &#x27;Golias&#x27;. Sheehan concludes that the use of the arcane spelling is more indicative of Nashe, who was prone to using older spellings of certain words, than Shakespeare, who was less likely to do so.

However, evidence of Shakespeare&#x27;s authorship has also been found within the play. For example, Samuel Johnson argued that the play was more competently written than &quot;King John&quot;, &quot;Richard II&quot;, &quot;1 Henry IV&quot;, &quot;2 Henry IV&quot; and &quot;Henry V&quot;, and, therefore, not attributing it to Shakespeare based on quality made little sense. A similar point is made by Lawrence V. Ryan, who suggests that the play fits so well into Shakespeare&#x27;s overall style, with an intricate integration of form and content, that it was most likely written by him alone.

Another aspect of the debate is the actual likelihood of Shakespeare collaborating at all. Some critics, such as Hattaway and Cairncross, argue that it is unlikely that a young, up-and-coming dramatist trying to make a name for himself would have collaborated with other authors so early in his career. On the other hand, Michael Taylor suggests &quot;it is not difficult to construct an imaginary scenario that has a harassed author calling on friends and colleagues to help him construct an unexpectedly commissioned piece in a hurry.&quot;

Another argument that challenges the co-authorship idea is that the basic theory of co-authorship was originally hypothesized in the 18th and 19th centuries due to a distaste for the treatment of Joan. Critics were uncomfortable attributing such a harsh depiction to Shakespeare, so they embraced the co-authorship theory to &quot;clear his name&quot;, suggesting that he could not have been responsible for the merciless characterization. Harvard University English literature professor Herschel Baker noted in his introduction to &quot;Henry VI&quot; for &quot;The Riverside Shakespeare&quot; (1974; p. 587) how appalled William Warburton was by the depiction of Joan, and that Edmond Malone sought in &quot;Dissertation on the Three Parts of Henry VI&quot; (1787) to prove Shakespeare had no hand its authorship.

As with the question of the order in which the trilogy was written, twentieth century editors and scholars remain staunchly divided on the question of authorship. Edward Burns, for example, in his 2000 edition of the play for the &quot;Arden Shakespeare&quot; 3rd series, suggests that it is highly unlikely that Shakespeare wrote alone, and, throughout his introduction and commentary, he refers to the writer not as Shakespeare but as &#x27;the dramatists&#x27;. He also suggests that the play should be more properly called &quot;Harry VI, by Shakespeare, Nashe and others&quot;. Burns&#x27; predecessor however, Andrew S. Cairncross, editor of the play for the &quot;Arden Shakespeare&quot; 2nd series in 1962, ascribes the entire play to Shakespeare, as does Lawrence V. Ryan in his 1967 &quot;Signet Classic Shakespeare&quot; edition, and Michael Hattaway in his &quot;New Cambridge Shakespeare&quot; edition of 1990. In his 1952 edition of the play, Dover Wilson, on the other hand, argued that the play was almost entirely written by others, and that Shakespeare actually had little to do with its composition. Speaking during a 1952 radio presentation of &quot;The Contention&quot; and &quot;True Tragedy,&quot; which he produced, Dover Wilson argued that he had not included &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; because it is a &quot;patchwork in which Shakespeare collaborated with inferior dramatists.&quot;

On the other hand, Michael Taylor believes that Shakespeare almost certainly wrote the entire play, as does J. J. M. Tobin, who, in his essay in &quot;Henry VI: Critical Essays&quot; (2001), argues the similarities to Nashe do not reveal the hand of Nashe at work in the composition of the play, but instead reveal Shakespeare imitating Nashe. More recently, in 2005, Paul J. Vincent has re-examined the question in light of recent research into the Elizabethan theatre, concluding that &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; is Shakespeare&#x27;s partial revision of a play by Nashe (Act 1) and an unknown playwright (Acts 2–5) and that it was the original, non-Shakespearean, play that was first performed on 3 March 1592. Shakespeare&#x27;s work in the play, which was most likely composed in 1594, can be found in Act 2 (scene 4) and Act 4 (scenes 2–5 and the first 32 lines of scene 7). In 2007, Vincent&#x27;s authorship findings, especially with regard to Nashe&#x27;s authorship of Act 1, were supported overall by Brian Vickers, who agrees with the theory of co-authorship and differs only slightly over the extent of Shakespeare&#x27;s contribution to the play.

In 2016, Oxford University Press announced that it would credit Christopher Marlowe as co-author alongside Shakespeare for all three &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays in its &quot;New Oxford Shakespeare&quot; series. In the &quot;New Oxford Shakespeare,&quot; &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; was specifically credited as being written by &quot;Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Nashe, and Anonymous, adapted by William Shakespeare&quot;. In opposition, Brian Vickers and Darren Freebury-Jones have argued in favor of Thomas Kyd as Nashe&#x27;s co-author.

===Language===
The very functioning of language itself is literally a theme in the play, with particular emphasis placed on its ability to represent by means of signs (semiosis), the power of language to sway, the aggressive potential of language, the failure of language to adequately describe reality and the manipulation of language so as to hide the truth.

The persuasive power of language is first alluded to by Charles, who tells Joan after she has assured him she can end the siege of Orléans, &quot;Thou hast astonished me with thy high terms&quot; (1.2.93). This sense is repeated when the Countess of Auvergne is wondering about Talbot and says to her servant, &quot;Great is the rumour of this dreadful knight,/And his achievements of no less account./Fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears,/To give their censure of these rare reports&quot; (2.3.7–10). Like Charles, Auvergne has been astonished with the &#x27;high terms&#x27; bestowed on Talbot, and now she wishes to see if the report and the reality conflate. Later in the play, the persuasive power of language becomes important for Joan, as she uses it as a subterfuge to sneak into Rouen, telling her men, &quot;Be wary how you place your words;/Talk like the vulgar sort of market men/That come to gather money for their corn&quot; (3.2.3.5). Later, she uses language to persuade Burgundy to join with the Dauphin against the English. As Burgundy realises he is succumbing to her rhetoric, he muses to himself, &quot;Either she hath bewitched me with her words,/Or nature makes me suddenly relent&quot; (3.3.58–59). Here, language is shown to be so powerful as to act on Burgundy the same way Nature itself would act, to the point where he is unsure if he has been persuaded by a natural occurrence or by Joan&#x27;s words. Language is thus presented as capable of transforming ideology. As Joan finishes her speech, Burgundy again attests to the power of her language, &quot;I am vanquish&#x27;d. These haughty words of hers/Have battered me like roaring canon-shot,/And made me almost yield upon my knees&quot; (3.3.78–80). Later, something similar happens with Henry, who agrees to marry Margaret merely because of Suffolk&#x27;s description of her. In a line that echoes Burgundy&#x27;s, Henry queries what it is that has prompted him to agree to Suffolk&#x27;s suggestion: &quot;Whether it be through force of your report,/My noble lord of Suffolk, or for that/My tender youth was never yet attaint/With any passion of inflaming love, I cannot tell&quot; (5.6.79–83). Here, again, the power of language is shown to be so strong as to be confused with a natural phenomenon.
Language can also be employed aggressively. For example, after the death of Salisbury, when Talbot first hears about Joan, he contemptuously refers to her and Charles as &quot;Puzel or pussel, dolphin or dogfish&quot; (1.5.85). In French, &#x27;puzel&#x27; means slut, and &#x27;pussel&#x27; is a variation of &#x27;pucelle&#x27; (meaning virgin), but with an added negative connotation. These two words, &#x27;puzel&#x27; and &#x27;pussel&#x27;, are both puns on Joan&#x27;s name (Pucelle), thus showing Talbot&#x27;s utter contempt for her. Similarly, the use of the word &#x27;dolphin&#x27; to describe the Dauphin carries negative and mocking connotations, as does the use of the word &#x27;dogfish&#x27;, a member of the shark family considered dishonourable scavengers, preying on anything and anyone. Again, Talbot is showing his contempt for Charles&#x27; position by exposing it to mockery with some simple word play. Other examples of words employed aggressively are seen when the English reclaim Orléans, and a soldier chases the half-dressed French leaders from the city, declaring &quot;The cry of &#x27;Talbot&#x27; serves me for a sword,/For I have loaden me with many spoils,/Using no other weapon but his name&quot; (2.1.81–83). A similar notion is found when the Countess of Auvergne meets Talbot, and muses, &quot;Is this the Talbot so much feared abroad/That with his name the mothers still their babes&quot; (2.3.15–16). Here words (specifically Talbot&#x27;s name) literally become weapons, and are used directly to strike fear into the enemy.

However although words are occasionally shown to be powerful and deeply persuasive, they also often fail in their signifying role, exposed as incapable of adequately representing reality. This idea is introduced by Gloucester at Henry V&#x27;s funeral, where he laments that words cannot encompass the life of such a great king: &quot;What should I say? His deeds exceed all speech&quot; (1.1.15). Later, when Gloucester and Winchester confront one another outside the Tower of London, Gloucester champions the power of real action over the power of threatening words: &quot;I will not answer thee with words but blows&quot; (1.3.69). Similarly, after the French capture Rouen and refuse to meet the English army in the battlefield, Bedford asserts, &quot;O let no words, but deeds, revenge this treason&quot; (3.2.48). Another example of the failure of language is found when Suffolk finds himself lost for words whilst attempting to woo Margaret: &quot;Fain would I woo her, yet I dare not speak./I&#x27;ll call for pen and ink and write my mind./Fie, de la Pole, disable not thyself!/Hast not a tongue?&quot; (5.4.21–24). Later, Joan&#x27;s words, so successful during the play in convincing others to support her, explicitly fail to save her life, as she is told by Warwick, &quot;Strumpet, thy words condemn thy brat and thee./Use no entreaty, for it is in vain&quot; (5.5.84–85).

Language as a system is also shown to be open to manipulation. Words can be employed for deceptive purposes, as the representative function of language gives way to deceit. For example, shortly after Charles has accepted Joan as his new commander, Alençon calls into question her sincerity, thus suggesting a possible discrepancy between her words and her actions; &quot;These women are shrewd tempters with their tongues&quot; (1.2.123). Another example occurs when Henry forces Winchester and Gloucester to put aside their animosity and shake hands. Their public words here stand in diametric opposition to their private intentions;
&quot;WINCHESTER&quot;
Well, Duke of Gloucester, I will yield to thee
Love for thy love, and hand for hand I give.

&quot;He takes Gloucester&#x27;s hand&quot;

&quot;GLOUCESTER&quot;
(&quot;aside&quot;) Ay, but I fear me with a hollow heart.
(&quot;to others&quot;) See here, my friends and loving countrymen,
This token serveth for a flag of truce
Betwixt ourselves and all our followers.
So help me God as I dissemble not.

&quot;WINCHESTER&quot;
So help me God. (&quot;aside&quot;) As I intend it not.
:::::::(3.1.136–143)

Act 2, Scene 4 is perhaps the most important scene in the play in terms of language, as it is in this scene where Richard introduces the notion of what he calls &quot;dumb significants,&quot; something that carries resonance throughout the trilogy. During his debate with Somerset, Richard points out to the lords who are unwilling to openly support either of them, &quot;Since you are tongue tied and loath to speak,/In dumb significants proclaim your thoughts.&quot;(ll.25–26) The dumb significants he refers to are roses—a red rose to join Somerset, a white rose to join Richard. As such, the roses essentially function as symbols, replacing the very need for language. Once all the lords select their roses, these symbolize the houses they represent. Henry chooses a red rose—totally unaware of the implications of his actions, as he does not understand the power the &quot;dumb significants&quot; have.

He places his trust in a more literal type of language, and thus selects a rose in what he thinks is a meaningless gesture—but that does in fact have profound implications. Henry&#x27;s mistake results directly from his failure to grasp the importance of silent actions and symbolic decisions; &quot;a gesture—especially such an ill-considered one—is worth and makes worthless, a thousand pretty words.&quot;

===Themes===

====Death of chivalry====
A fundamental theme in the play is the death of chivalry, &quot;the decline of England&#x27;s empire over France and the accompanying decay of the ideas of feudalism that had sustained the order of the realm.&quot; This is specifically manifested in the character of Talbot, the symbol of a dying breed of men honourably and selflessly devoted to the good of England, whose methods and style of leadership represent the last dying remnants of a now outmoded, feudal gallantry. As such, Michael Taylor refers to him as &quot;the representative of a chivalry that was fast decaying,&quot; whilst Michael Hattaway sees him as &quot;a figure for the nostalgia that suffuses the play, a dream of simple chivalric &quot;virtus&quot; like that enacted every year at Elizabeth&#x27;s Accession Day tilts, a dream of true empire. He is designed to appeal to a popular audience, and his death scene where he calls for troops who do not appear is yet another demonstration of the destructiveness of aristocratic factionalism.&quot;

One of the clearest examples of Talbot&#x27;s adherence to the codes of chivalry is seen in his response to Fastolf&#x27;s desertion from the battlefield. As far as Talbot is concerned, Fastolf&#x27;s actions reveal him as a dishonourable coward who places self-preservation above self-sacrifice, and thus he represents everything wrong with the modern knight. This is in direct contrast to the chivalry that Talbot represents, a chivalry he remembers fondly from days gone by:

&quot;TALBOT&quot;
I vowed, base knight, when I did meet thee next,
To tear the garter from thy craven&#x27;s leg,
Which I have done because unworthily
Thou wast install&#x27;d in that high degree. – 
Pardon me, princely Henry, and the rest.
This dastard, at the Battle of Patay,
When but in all I was six thousand strong,
And that the French were almost ten to one,
Before we met, or that a stroke was given,
Like to a trusty squire did run away;
In which assault we lost twelve hundred men.
Myself and divers gentlemen beside
Were there surprised and taken prisoners.
Then judge, great lords, if I have done amiss,
Or whether that such cowards ought to wear
This ornament of knighthood: yea or no?

&quot;GLOUCESTER&quot;
To say the truth, this fact was infamous
And ill beseeming any common man,
Much more a knight, a captain, and a leader.

&quot;TALBOT&quot;
When first this order was ordained, my lords,
Knights of the garter were of noble birth,
Valiant and virtuous, full of haughty courage,
Such as were grown to credit by the wars;
Not fearing death nor shrinking for distress,
But always resolute in most extremes.
He then that is not furnished in this sort
Doth but usurp the sacred name of knight,
Profaning this most honourable order,
And should – if I were worthy to be judge – 
Be quite degraded, like a hedge-born swain
That doth presume to boast of gentle blood.
:::::::(4.1.14–44)
Talbot&#x27;s description of Fastolf&#x27;s actions stands in direct contrast to the image of an ideal knight, and as such, the ideal and the reality serve to highlight one another, and thus reveal the discrepancy between them.

Similarly, just as Talbot uses knights to represent an ideal past, by remembering how they used to be chivalric, so too does Gloucester in relation to Henry V, who he also sees as representing a glorious and honourable past:
England ne&#x27;re had a king until his time.
Virtue he had, deserving to command;
His brandished sword did bind men with his beams,
His arms spread wider than a dragon&#x27;s wings,
His sparkling eyes, replete with wrathful fire,
More dazzled and drove back his enemies
Than midday sun fierce bent against their faces.
:::::::(1.1.8–14)
Henry V has this function throughout much of the play; &quot;he is presented not as a man but as a rhetorical construct fashioned out of hyperbole, as a heroic image or heraldic icon.&quot; He is seen as a representative of a celebrated past that can never be recaptured: &quot;There is in the play a dominant, nostalgic, celebratory reminiscence of Henry V who lives on in the immortality of preternatural legend.&quot;
The play, however, does not simply depict the fall of one order; it also depicts the rise of another; &quot;How the nation might have remained true to itself is signified by the words and deeds of Talbot. What she is in danger of becoming is signified by the shortcomings of the French, failings that crop up increasingly amongst Englishman [...] also manifest are an English decline towards French effeminacy and the beginnings of reliance upon fraud and cunning rather than manly courage and straightforward manly virtue.&quot; If the old mode of honourable conduct is specifically represented by Talbot and Henry V, the new mode of duplicity and Machiavellianism is represented by Joan, who employs a type of warfare with which Talbot is simply unable to cope. This is seen most clearly when she sneaks into Rouen and subsequently refuses to face Talbot in a battle. Talbot finds this kind of behaviour incomprehensible and utterly dishonourable. As such, he finds himself fighting an enemy who uses tactics he is incapable of understanding; with the French using what he sees as unconventional methods, he proves unable to adapt. This represents one of the ironies in the play&#x27;s depiction of chivalry; it is the very resoluteness of Talbot&#x27;s honour and integrity, his insistence in preserving an old code abandoned by all others, which ultimately defeats him; his inability to adjust means he becomes unable to function in the newly established &#x27;dishonourable&#x27; context. As such, the play is not entirely nostalgic about chivalry; &quot;so often the tenets of chivalry are mocked by word and action. The play is full of moments of punctured aristocratic hauteur.&quot;

Talbot&#x27;s mode of chivalry is replaced by politicians concerned only with themselves and their own advancement: Winchester, Somerset, Suffolk, even Richard. As Jane Howell, director of the &quot;BBC Shakespeare&quot; adaptation argues, &quot;what I was concerned about in the first play [...] was that for a long time, the code of the people had been chivalry. But with the death of Talbot, one starts to see a demise of chivalry.&quot; Narcissistic political infighting has supplanted self-sacrificing patriotism and chivalry: &quot;the play charts the disastrous breakdown of civility among the English nobility.&quot; Nobles concerned with personal power above all else have replaced knights concerned only with the empire. As such, by the end of the play, both Talbot and his son lay dead, as does the notion of English chivalry. In this sense then, the play &quot;depicts the deaths of the titanic survivors of an &quot;ancien régime&quot;.&quot;

====Patriotism====

Hand-in-hand with the examination of chivalry with which the play engages is an examination of patriotism. Indeed, some critics argue that patriotism provided the impetus for the play in the first place. England defeated the Spanish Armada in 1588, leading to a short-lived period of international confidence and patriotic pride—but by 1590, the national mood was one of despondency, and as such, &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; may have been commissioned to help dispel this mood: &quot;The patriotic emotions to which this play shamelessly appeals resonate at an especially fragile time politically speaking. Frightening memories of the 1588 Spanish Armada, or of the Babington Plot of 1586, which led to the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots; concerns over a noticeably declining and still unmarried Queen Elizabeth; worries over Catholic recusancy; fear of military involvement in Europe, and, just as disquietingly, in Ireland, combine to make a patriotic response a matter of some urgency. [The play] is a bracing attempt to stiffen the sinews of the English in a time of danger and deceit.&quot;

Evidence of this is seen throughout. For example, the English seem vastly outnumbered in every battle, yet they never give up, and often they prove victorious. Indeed, even when they do lose, the suggestion is often made that it was because of treachery, as only by duplicitous means could their hardiness be overcome. For example, during the Battle of Patay (where Talbot is captured), the messenger reports,
The tenth of August last, this dreadful lord [i.e. Talbot],
Retiring from the siege of Orléans,
Having full scarce six thousand in his troop,
By three-and-twenty thousand of the French
Was round encompass&#x27;d and set upon:
No leisure had he to enrank his men.
He wanted pikes to set before his archers;
Instead whereof sharp stakes plucked out of hedges
They pitch&#x27;d in the ground confusedly
To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.
More than three hours the fight continu&#x27;d,
Where valiant Talbot, above human thought,
Enacted wonders with his sword and lance.
Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;
Here, there, and everywhere, enraged he slew.
The French exclaimed the devil was in arms:
All the whole army stood agazed on him.
His soldiers, spying his undaunted spirit,
&#x27;À Talbot! À Talbot!&#x27; cried out amain,
And rushed into the bowels of the battle.
Here had the conquest fully been sealed up
If Sir John Fastolf had not played the coward.
He, being in the vanguard placed behind,
With purpose to relieve and follow them,
Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke.
Hence flew the general wrack and massacre;
Enclos&#x27;d were they with their enemies.
A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin&#x27;s grace,
Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back – 
Whom all France, with their chief assembled strength,
Durst not presume to look once in the face.
:::::::(1.1.108–140)
Here Fastolf&#x27;s betrayal is the direct cause of the English defeat, not the fact that they were outnumbered ten-to-one, that they were hit by a surprise attack or that they were surrounded. This notion is returned to several times, with the implication each time that only treachery can account for an English defeat. For example, upon hearing of the first loss of towns in France, Exeter immediately asks, &quot;How were they lost? What treachery was used?&quot; (1.1.68). Upon losing Rouen, Talbot exclaims, &quot;France, thou shalt rue this treason with thy tears/If Talbot but survive thy treachery&quot; (3.2.35–36). Later, when thinking back on the French campaign, Richard asks Henry, &quot;Have we not lost most part of all the towns/By treason, falsehood and by treachery&quot; (5.5.108–109).
However, if the English are of the mind that they can only be defeated by treachery and betrayal, the play also presents the French as somewhat in awe of them, bearing a begrudging respect for them, and fearing their strength in battle. As such, whilst the English attribute every defeat to treachery, the French opinion of the English seems to imply that perhaps this is indeed the only way to beat them. For example, during the siege of Orléans:
&quot;ALENÇON&quot;
Froissart, a countryman of ours, records
England all Olivers and Rolands bred
During the time Edward the Third did reign.
More truly now may this be verified,
For none but Samsons and Goliases
It sendeth forth to skirmish. One to ten?
Lean raw-boned rascals – who would e&#x27;er suppose
They had such courage and audacity.

&quot;CHARLES&quot;
Let&#x27;s leave this town, for they are hare-brained slaves,
And hunger will enforce them to be more eager.
Of old I know them; rather with their teeth
The walls they&#x27;ll tear down than forsake the siege.

&quot;REIGNIER&quot;
I think by some odd gimmers or device
Their arms are set, like clocks, still to strike on,
Else n&#x27;er could they hold out as they do.
:::::::(1.2.29-44)
As such, the play presents, to a certain extent, the English image of themselves as somewhat in line with the French image of them, with both stressing resoluteness and steadfastness.

Another component of the patriotic sentiment is the religious note the play often strikes. On the whole, everything Catholic is represented as bad, everything Protestant is represented as good: &quot;The play&#x27;s popularity [in 1592] has to be seen against the backdrop of an extraordinary efflorescence of interest in political history in the last two decades of the sixteenth century fed by self-conscious patriotic Protestantism&#x27;s fascination with its own biography in history. It is not for nothing that &quot;Part One&quot; is persistently anti-Catholic in a number of ways despite the fact that in the fifteenth century the entire population of England was nominally Catholic (though not, of course, in 1592). The French are presented as decadently Catholic, the English (with the exception of the Bishop of Winchester) as attractively Protestant.&quot; Talbot himself is an element of this, insofar as his &quot;rhetoric is correspondingly Protestant. His biblical references are all from the Old Testament (a source less fully used by Catholics) and speak of stoicism and individual faith.&quot; Henry V is also cited as an example of Protestant purity: &quot;He was a king blest of the King of Kings./Unto the French the dreadful judgement day/So dreadful will not be as was his sight./The battles of the Lords of Hosts he fought&quot; (1.1.28–31). &quot;King of kings&quot; is a phrase used in 1 Timothy, 6:15. &quot;Lords of Hosts&quot; is used throughout the Old Testament, and to say Henry fought for the Lord of Hosts is to compare him to the warrior king, David, who also fought for the Lords of Hosts in 1 Samuel, 25:28.

However, despite the obvious celebratory patriotic tone and sense of Protestant/English religio-political identity, as with the lamentation for the death of chivalry, the play is somewhat ambiguous in its overall depiction of patriotism. Ultimately, the play depicts how the English &quot;lost&quot; France, a seemingly strange subject matter if Shakespeare was attempting to instil a sense of national pride in the people. This is rendered even more so when one considers that Shakespeare could have written about how England won France in the first place: &quot;The popularity of &quot;Armada rhetoric&quot; during the time of &quot;1 Henry VI&quot;&#x27;s composition would have seemed to ask for a play about Henry V, not one which begins with his death and proceeds to dramatise English loses.&quot; In this sense then, the depiction of patriotism, although undoubtedly strong, is not without ambiguity; the very story told by the play renders any patriotic sentiment found within to be something of a hollow victory.

====Saintly vs. demonic====

Demons, spirits, witches, saints and God are all mentioned on numerous occasions within the play, often relating directly to Joan, who is presented as &quot;a fascinating mixture of saint, witch, naïve girl, clever woman, audacious warrior and sensual tart.&quot; The English continually refer to her as a witch and a whore, the French as a saint and a saviour, and the play itself seems to waver between these two poles: &quot;Joan first appears in a state of beatitude, patient, serene, the &quot;Divinest creature&quot; of Charles&#x27; adoration, the object of the Virgin Mary&#x27;s miraculous intercession, chosen by her to rescue France, and so made beautiful, courageous and wise [...] on the other hand, and virtually at the same time, she&#x27;s clearly an early combination of the demonic, the Machiavellian, and the Marlovian.&quot;

Joan is introduced into the play by the Bastard, who, even before anyone has seen or met her, says, &quot;A holy maid hither with me I bring&quot; (1.2.51). Later, after Joan has helped the French lift the siege of Orléans, Charles declares, &quot;No longer on Saint Denis will we cry, but Joan la Pucelle shall be France&#x27;s saint&quot; (1.7.28–30). Similarly, when Joan reveals her plan to turn Burgundy against the English, Alençon declares, &quot;We&#x27;ll set thy statue in some holy place/And have thee reverenced like a blessed saint&quot; (3.3.14–15).

On the other hand, however, the English see her as a demon. Prior to her combat with Talbot, he exclaims, &quot;Devil or devil&#x27;s dam, I&#x27;ll conjure thee./Blood will I draw on thee – thou art a witch –/And straightway give thy soul to him thou serv&#x27;st&quot; (1.6.5–7). Then, after the fight, he says, &quot;My thoughts are whirl&#x27;d like a potter&#x27;s wheel./I know not where I am nor what I do./A witch, by fear, not force, like Hannibal,/Drives back our troops and conquers as she lists&quot; (1.6.19–22). Upon arriving in France, Bedford condemns Charles for aligning himself with Joan: &quot;How much he wrongs his fame,/Despairing of his own arms&#x27; fortitude,/To join with witches and the help of hell&quot; (2.1.16–18). Talbot responds to this with, &quot;Well, let them practice and converse with spirits./God is our fortress&quot; (2.1.25–26). Later, Talbot refers to her as &quot;Pucelle, that witch, that damn&#x27;d sorceress&quot; (3.2.37) and &quot;Foul fiend of France, and hag of all despite&quot; (3.2.51), declaring &quot;I speak not to that railing Hecate&quot; (3.2.64). Prior to executing her, York also calls her a &quot;Fell banning hag&quot; (5.2.42).

Joan herself addresses this issue as she is about to be executed:
First let me tell you whom you have condemned:
Not me begotten of a shepherd swain,
But issued from the progeny of kings;
Virtuous and holy, chosen from above
By inspiration of celestial grace
To work exceeding miracles on earth.
I never had to do with wicked spirits;
But you, that are polluted with your lusts,
Stained with the guiltless blood of innocents,
Corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices –
Because you want the grace that others have,
You judge it straight a thing impossible
To compass wonders but by help of devils.
No, misconceiv&#x27;d, Joan of Arc hath been
A virgin from her tender infancy,
Chaste and immaculate in very thought,
Whose maiden blood, thus rigorously effused,
Will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven.
::::::: (5.5.36–53)
Having failed in her efforts to convince the English she is a holy virgin, and that killing her will invoke the wrath of heaven, she alters her story and claims she is pregnant, hoping they will spare her for the sake of the child. She then lists off various French nobles who could be her child&#x27;s father in an effort to find one who the English respect. In this sense then, Joan leaves the play as neither saintly nor demonic, but as a frightened woman pleading fruitlessly for her life.

An important question in any examination of Joan is the question of whether or not she is a unified, stable character who vacillates from saintly to demonic, or a poorly constructed character, now one thing, now the other. According to Edward Burns, &quot;Joan cannot be read as a substantive realist character, a unified subject with a coherent singly identity.&quot;

Michael Hattaway offers an alternate, sympathetic view of Joan that argues that the character&#x27;s movement from saintly to demonic is justified within the text: &quot;Joan is the play&#x27;s tragic figure, comparable with Faulconbridge in &quot;King John&quot;. She turns to witchcraft only in despair; it cannot be taken as an unequivocal manifestation of diabolic power.&quot;

Another theory is that Joan is actually a comic figure, and the huge alterations in her character are supposed to evoke laughter. Michael Taylor, for example, argues, &quot;A fiendish provenance replaces a divine one in [Act 5, Scene 3], a scene that reduces Joan to a comic, bathetic dependency on shifty representatives of the underworld.&quot; In line with this thinking, it is worth pointing out that in the 1981 &quot;BBC Television Shakespeare&quot; adaptation, Joan, and the French in general, are treated predominantly as comic figures. Joan (Brenda Blethyn), Alençon (Michael Byrne), the Bastard (Brian Protheroe), Reignier (David Daker) and Charles (Ian Saynor) are treated as buffoons for the most part, and there is no indication of any malevolence (significantly, when Joan&#x27;s fiends abandon her, we never see them, we simply see her talking to empty air). Examples of the comic treatment of the characters are found during the battle of Orléans, where Joan is ludicrously depicted as defending the city from the entire English army single-handed, whilst Talbot stands by incredulously watching his soldiers flee one after another. Another example appears in Act 2, Scene 1, as the five of them blame one another for the breach in the watch at Orléans that allowed the English back into the city. Their role as comic figures is also shown in Act 3, Scene 2. After Joan has entered Rouen and the others stand outside waiting for her signal. Charles is shown sneaking through a field holding a helmet with a large plume up in front of his face in an effort to hide.

The notion of demonic agency and saintly power, however, is not confined to Joan. For example, in the opening conversation of the play, speculating as to how Talbot could have been taken prisoner, Exeter exclaims &quot;shall we think the subtle-witted French/Conjurers and sorcerers, that, afraid of him,/By magic verse have contrived his end&quot; (1.1.25–27). Later, discussing the French capture of Orléans, Talbot claims it was &quot;contrived by art and baleful sorcery&quot; (2.1.15). Indeed, the French make similar claims about the English. During the Battle of Patay for example, according to the messenger, &quot;The French exclaimed the devil was in arms&quot; (1.1.125). Later, as the English attack Orléans,
&quot;BASTARD&quot;
I think this Talbot be a fiend of hell.
&quot;REIGNIER&quot;
If not of hell, the heavens sure favour him.
:::::::(2.1.47–48)
Here, much as the English had done when they were being defeated by Joan, the French attribute diabolic power to their vanquishers. Unlike the English however, the French acknowledge that Talbot must be either a demon or a saint. As far as the English are concerned, Joan is demonic, it is not open to question.

==Performance==

After the original 1592 performances, the complete text of &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; seems to have been rarely acted. The first definite performance after Shakespeare&#x27;s day was on 13 March 1738 at Covent Garden, in what seems to have been a stand-alone performance, as there is no record of a performance of either &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; or &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;. The next certain performance in England did not occur until 1906, when F.R. Benson presented the play at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in a production of Shakespeare&#x27;s two tetralogies, performed over eight nights. As far as can be ascertained, this was not only the first performance of the octology, but was also the first definite performance of both the tetralogy and the trilogy. Benson himself played Henry and his wife, Constance Benson, played Margaret.

In 1953, Douglas Seale directed a production of &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre, following successful productions of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; in 1951 and &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; in 1952. All three plays starred Paul Daneman as Henry and Rosalind Boxall as Margaret, with &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; featuring Derek Godfrey as Talbot and Judi Dench as Joan.

A 1977 production at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre made much of its unedited status. Terry Hands presented all three &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays with Alan Howard as Henry and Helen Mirren as Margaret. Though the production had only moderate box office success, critics lauded it for Alan Howard&#x27;s unique portrayal of Henry. Howard adopted historical details concerning the real Henry&#x27;s madness into his performance, presenting the character as constantly on the brink of a mental and emotional breakdown. Possibly as a reaction to a recent adaptation of the trilogy under the general title &quot;Wars of the Roses&quot;, which was strongly political – Hands attempted to ensure his own production was entirely apolitical. &quot;&quot;Wars of the Roses&quot; was a study in power politics: its central image was the conference table, and Warwick, the scheming king-maker, was the central figure. But that&#x27;s not Shakespeare. Shakespeare goes far beyond politics. Politics is a very shallow science.&quot; Aside from Howard and Mirren, the production starred David Swift as Talbot and Charlotte Cornwell as Joan.

Under the direction of Michael Boyd the play was presented at the Swan Theatre in Stratford in 2000, with David Oyelowo as Henry and Keith Bartlett as Talbot. Both Margaret and Joan were played by Fiona Bell (as Joan is burned, Bell symbolically rose from the ashes as Margaret). The play was presented with the five other history plays to form a complete eight-part history cycle under the general title &quot;This England: The Histories&quot; (the first time the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) had ever attempted to stage the eight plays as one sequence). &quot;This England: The Histories&quot; was revived in 2006, as part of the &quot;Complete Works&quot; festival at the Courtyard Theatre, with the &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays again directed by Boyd, and starring Chuk Iwuji as Henry and Keith Bartlett reprising his role as Talbot. Katy Stephens played both Margaret and Joan. When the &quot;Complete Works&quot; wrapped in March 2007, the history plays remained on stage, under the shorter title &quot;The Histories&quot;, as part of a two-year thirty-four actor ensemble production. &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; was performed under the title &quot;Henry VI, Part 1: The War Against France&quot;. At the end of the two-year programme, the entire octology was performed over a four-day period under the title &quot;The Glorious Moment&quot;; &quot;Richard II&quot; was staged on a Thursday evening, followed by the two &quot;Henry IV&quot; plays on Friday afternoon and evening, the three &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays on Saturday (two afternoon performances and one evening performance), and &quot;Richard III&quot; on Sunday evening.

Boyd&#x27;s production garnered much attention at the time because of his interpolations and additions to the text. Most notably, Boyd introduced a new character into the trilogy. Called The Keeper, the character never speaks, but upon the death of each major character, the Keeper (played by Edward Clayton in 2000, and by Anthony Bunsee in 2006/2007), wearing all red, would walk onto stage and approach the body. The actor playing the body would then stand up and allow himself to be led off-stage by the figure. The production was also particularly noted for its realistic violence. According to Robert Gore-Langton of the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, in his review of the original 2000 production, &quot;blood from a severed arm sprayed over my lap. A human liver slopped to the floor by my feet. An eyeball scudded past, then a tongue.&quot;

In 2012, the trilogy was staged at Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe as part of the Globe to Globe Festival, with each play performed by a different Balkans based company and offered as a commentary on the recent history of violence in that region. &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; was staged by National Theatre Belgrade, directed by Nikita Milivojević, and starring Hadzi Nenad Maricic as Henry, Nebojša Kundačina as Talbot and Jelena Djulvezan as Joan. In 2013, Nick Bagnall directed another production of the trilogy at the Globe. All three plays were performed each day, beginning at midday, under the overall title &quot;Henry VI: Three Plays&quot;. &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; was performed under the title &quot;Henry VI: Harry the Sixth&quot;. Each of the plays was edited down to two hours, and the entire trilogy was performed with a cast of fourteen actors. On several specific dates, the plays were performed at the actual locations where some of the original events took place and streamed live to the theatre; &quot;battlefield productions&quot; were staged at Towton (Battle of Towton from &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;), Tewkesbury (Battle of Tewkesbury from &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;), St Albans Cathedral (First Battle of St Albans from &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; and Second Battle of St Albans from &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;), and Monken Hadley Common (Battle of Barnet from &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;). The production starred Graham Butler as Henry, Mary Doherty as Margaret, Andrew Sheridan as Talbot and Beatriz Romilly as Joan.

Apart from the 1738 performance at Covent Garden (about which nothing is known), there is no evidence of &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; having ever been performed as a stand-alone play, unlike both &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; (which was initially staged as a single play by Douglas Seale in 1951) and &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; (which was staged as a single play by Katie Mitchell in 1994).

Outside the UK, the first major American performance was in 1935 at the Pasadena Playhouse in California, directed by Gilmore Brown, as part of a production of all ten Shakespearean histories (the two tetralogies, preceded by &quot;King John&quot; and proceeded by &quot;Henry VIII&quot;).

In Europe, unedited stagings of the play took place at the Weimar Court Theatre in 1857. Directed by Franz von Dingelstedt, it was performed as the sixth part of the octology, with all eight plays staged over a ten-day period. A major production was staged at the Burgtheater in Vienna in 1873, with a celebrated performance from Friedrich Mitterwurzer as Winchester. Jocza Savits directed a production of the tetralogy at the Munich Court Theatre in 1889 and again in 1906. In 1927, Saladin Schmitt presented the unedited octology at the Municipal Theatre in Bochum. Denis Llorca staged the tetralogy as one twelve-hour piece in Carcassonne in 1978 and in Créteil in 1979.

==Adaptations==

===Theatrical===
Evidence for the first adaptation of &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; is not found until 1817, when Edmund Kean appeared in J.H. Merivale&#x27;s &quot;Richard Duke of York; or the Contention of York and Lancaster&quot; at Drury Lane, which used material from all three &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays, but removed everything not directly related to York; the play ended with his death, which occurs in Act 1, Scene 4 of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;. Material used from &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; includes the Temple Garden scene, the Mortimer scene and the introduction of Margaret.

Following Merivale&#x27;s example, Robert Atkins adapted all three plays into a single piece for a performance at The Old Vic in 1923 as part of the celebrations for the tercentenary of the &quot;First Folio&quot;. Guy Martineau played Henry, Esther Whitehouse played Margaret, Ernest Meads played Talbot and Jane Bacon played Joan.
The success of the 1951–53 Douglas Seale stand-alone productions of each of the individual plays in Birmingham prompted him to present the three plays together at the Old Vic in 1957 under the general title &quot;The Wars of the Roses&quot;. Barry Jackson adapted the text, altering the trilogy into a two-part play. &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; and &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; were combined (with almost all of &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; eliminated) and &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; was edited. Seale again directed, with Paul Daneman again appearing as Henry, alongside Barbara Jefford as Margaret. The roles of both Talbot and Joan were removed, and &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; was reduced to three scenes – the funeral of Henry V, the Temple Garden scene and the introduction of Margaret.

The production usually credited with establishing the reputation of the play in the modern theatre is John Barton and Peter Hall&#x27;s 1963/1964 RSC production of the tetralogy, adapted into a three-part series, under the general title &quot;The Wars of the Roses&quot;, at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre. The first play (entitled simply &quot;Henry VI&quot;) featured a much shortened version of &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; and half of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; (up to the death of Beaufort). The second play (entitled &quot;Edward IV&quot;) featured the second half of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; and a shortened version of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, which was followed by a shortened version of &quot;Richard III&quot; as the third play. In all, 1,450 lines written by Barton were added to 6,000 lines of original Shakespearean material, with a total of 12,350 lines removed. The production starred David Warner as Henry, Peggy Ashcroft as Margaret, Derek Smith (later replaced by Clive Swift) as Talbot and Janet Suzman as Joan. Barton and Hall were both especially concerned that the plays reflect the contemporary political environment, with the civil chaos and breakdown of society depicted in the plays mirrored in the contemporary &quot;milieu&quot;, by events such as the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961, the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 and the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963. Hall allowed these events to reflect themselves in the production, arguing that &quot;we live among war, race riots, revolutions, assassinations, and the imminent threat of extinction. The theatre is, therefore, examining fundamentals in staging the &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays.&quot; They were also influenced by politically focused literary theory of the time; both had attended the 1956 London visit of Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s Berliner Ensemble, both were subscribers to Antonin Artaud&#x27;s theory of &quot;Theatre of Cruelty&quot;, and Hall had read an English translation of Jan Kott&#x27;s influential &quot;Shakespeare Our Contemporary&quot; in 1964 prior to its publication in Britain. Both Barton and Hall were also supporters of E. M. W. Tillyard&#x27;s 1944 book &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s History Plays&quot;, which was still a hugely influential text in Shakespearian scholarship, especially in terms of its argument that Shakespeare in the tetralogy was advancing the Tudor myth.

Another major adaptation was staged in 1987 by the English Shakespeare Company, under the direction of Michael Bogdanov. This touring production opened at the Old Vic, and subsequently toured for two years, performing at, amongst other places, the Panasonic Globe Theatre in Tokyo, Japan (as the inaugural play of the arena), the Festival dei Due Mondi in Spoleto, Italy and at the Adelaide Festival in Australia. Following the structure established by Barton and Hall, Bogdanov combined a heavily edited &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; and the first half of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; into one play (&quot;Henry VI&quot;), and the second half of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; and &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; into another (&quot;Edward IV&quot;), and followed them with an edited &quot;Richard III&quot;. Also like Barton and Hall, Bogdanov concentrated on political issues, although he made them far more overt than had his predecessors. For example, played by June Watson, Margaret was closely modelled after the British Prime Minister at the time, Margaret Thatcher, even to the point of having similar clothes and hair. Likewise, Paul Brennan&#x27;s Henry was closely modelled after King Edward VIII, prior to his abdication. Bogdanov also employed frequent anachronisms and contemporary visual registers (such as modern dress), in an effort to show the relevance of the politics to the contemporary period. The production was noted for its pessimism as regards British politics, with some critics feeling the political resonances were too heavy handed. However, the series was a huge box office success. Alongside Watson and Brennan, the play starred Michael Fenner as Talbot and Mary Rutherford as Joan.

Another adaptation of the tetralogy by the Royal Shakespeare Company followed in 1988, performed at the Barbican. Adapted by Charles Wood and directed by Adrian Noble, the Barton/Hall structure was again followed, reducing the trilogy to two plays by dividing &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; in the middle. The resulting trilogy was entitled &quot;The Plantagenets&quot;, with the individual plays entitled &quot;Henry VI&quot;, &quot;The Rise of Edward IV&quot; and &quot;Richard III, His Death&quot;. Starring Ralph Fiennes as Henry, Penny Downie as Margaret, Mark Hadfield as Talbot and Julia Ford as Joan, the production was extremely successful with both audiences and critics.

Michael Bogdanov and the English Shakespeare Company presented a different adaptation at the Swansea Grand Theatre in 1991, using the same cast as on the touring production. All eight plays from the history cycle were presented over a seven night period, with each play receiving one performance only, and with only twenty-eight actors portraying the nearly five hundred roles. Whilst the other five plays in the cycle were unadapted, the &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays were combined into two, using the Barton/Hall structure, with the first named &quot;The House of Lancaster&quot; and the second, &quot;The House of York&quot;.

In 2000, Edward Hall presented the trilogy as a two-part series at the Watermill Theatre in Newbury. Hall followed the Jackson/Seale structure, combining &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; and &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; into one play that all but eliminated &quot;1 Henry VI&quot;, and following this with an edited version of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;. This production was noted for how it handled the violence of the play. The set was designed to look like an abattoir, but rather than attempt to present the violence realistically (as most productions do), Hall went in the other direction, presenting the violence symbolically. Whenever a character was decapitated or killed, a red cabbage was sliced up whilst the actor mimed the death beside it.

In 2001, Tom Markus directed an adaptation of the tetralogy at the Colorado Shakespeare Festival. Condensing all fours plays into one, Markus named the play &quot;Queen Margaret&quot;, doing much the same with the character of Margaret as Merivale had done with York. Margaret was played by Gloria Biegler, Henry by Richard Haratine, York by Lars Tatom and Gloucester by Charles Wilcox. The only scene from &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; was the meeting between Margaret and Suffolk.
Another unusual 2001 adaptation of the tetralogy was entitled &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Rugby Wars&quot;. Written by Matt Toner and Chris Coculuzzi, and directed by Coculuzzi, the play was acted by the Upstart Crow Theatre Group and staged outdoors at the Robert Street Playing Field as part of the Toronto Fringe Festival. Presented as if it were a live rugby match between York and Lancaster, the &#x27;play&#x27; featured commentary from Falstaff (Stephen Flett), which was broadcast live for the audience. The &#x27;match&#x27; itself was refereed by &#x27;Bill Shakespeare&#x27; (played by Coculuzzi), and the actors (whose characters names all appeared on their jerseys) had microphones attached and would recite dialogue from all four plays at key moments.

In 2002, Leon Rubin presented the tetralogy as a trilogy at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Ontario. Using the Barton/Hall method of combining &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; with the first half of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;, and the second half of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; with &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, the plays were renamed &quot;Henry VI: Revenge in France&quot; and &quot;Henry VI: Revolt in England&quot;. Michael Thierry played Henry, Seana McKenna played Margaret, Brad Ruby played Talbot and Michelle Giroux played Joan.

Also in 2002, Edward Hall and the Propeller company presented a one-play all-male cast modern dress adaptation of the trilogy at the Watermill Theatre. Under the title &quot;Rose Rage&quot;, Hall used a cast of only thirteen actors to portray the nearly one hundred and fifty speaking roles in the four-hour production, thus necessitating doubling and tripling of parts. Although a new adaptation, this production followed the Jackson/Seale method of eliminating almost all of &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; (Joan was completely absent). The original cast included Jonathan McGuinness as Henry, Robert Hands as Margaret and Keith Bartlett as Talbot. After a successful run at the Watermill, the play moved to the Chicago Shakespeare Theater. The American cast included Carman Lacivita as Henry, Scott Parkinson as Margaret and Fletcher McTaggart as Talbot.

Outside England, a major adaptation of the tetralogy took place in 1864 in Weimar under the direction of Franz von Dingelstedt, who, seven years previously had staged the play unedited. Dingelstedt turned the trilogy into a two-parter under the general name &quot;Die weisse rose&quot;. The first play was called &quot;Haus Lancaster&quot;, the second &quot;Haus York&quot;. This adaptation was unique insofar as both plays were created by combining material from all three &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays. Following this structure, Alfred von Walzogen also produced a two-part play in 1875, under the general title &quot;Edward IV&quot;. Another European adaptation was in 1965 at the Teatro Piccolo in Milan. Directed by Giorgio Strehler it went under the title &quot;Il gioco del potenti&quot; (&quot;The Play of the Mighty&quot;). Using Barton and Hall&#x27;s structure, Strehler also added several characters, including a Chorus, who used monologues from &quot;Richard II&quot;, both parts of &quot;Henry IV&quot;, &quot;Henry V&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot; and &quot;Timon of Athens&quot;, and two gravediggers called Bevis and Holland (after the names of two of Cade&#x27;s rebels in the Folio text of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;), who commented (with dialogue written by Strehler himself) on each of the major characters as they set about burying them. A major German adaptation was Peter Palitzsch&#x27;s two-part adaptation of the trilogy as &quot;Rosenkriege&quot; in 1967 at the Stuttgart State Theatre. Condensing the three plays into two, &quot;Heinrich VI&quot; and &quot;Eduard IV&quot;, Palitzsch&#x27;s adaptation concluded with the opening monologue from &quot;Richard III&quot;.

===Film===
The only cinematic adaptation of the play came in the 1973 horror comedy film &quot;Theatre of Blood&quot;, directed by Douglas Hickox. Vincent Price stars in the film as Edward Lionheart, (self)regarded as the finest Shakespearean actor of all time. When he fails to be awarded the prestigious Critic&#x27;s Circle Award for Best Actor, he sets out exacting bloody revenge on the critics who gave him poor reviews, with each act inspired by a death in a Shakespeare play. One such act of revenge involves the critic Chloe Moon (Coral Browne). Lionheart electrocutes Moon using a pair of hair curlers, whilst he recites excerpts from Act 5, Scene 4 of &quot;1 Henry VI&quot;, where Joan is sentenced to burn at the stake.

===Television===
The first television adaptation of the play was in 1960 when the BBC produced a serial entitled &quot;An Age of Kings&quot;. The show comprised fifteen sixty- and seventy-five-minute episodes that adapted all eight of Shakespeare&#x27;s sequential history plays. Directed by Michael Hayes and produced by Peter Dews, with a script by Eric Crozier, the production featured Terry Scully as Henry, Mary Morris as Margaret and Eileen Atkins as Joan. The ninth episode, under the title &quot;The Red Rose and the White&quot;, presented a heavily abridged version of &quot;1 Henry VI&quot;. With the episode only running one hour, obviously a great deal of text was removed (&quot;1 Henry VI&quot; was the only play in the octology to be screened in one episode, as opposed to split over two). Perhaps the most significant cuts were the complete removal of the character of Talbot, and the excision of all battle scenes in France.

In 1965, BBC 1 broadcast all three plays from John Barton and Peter Hall&#x27;s &quot;The Wars of the Roses&quot; trilogy (&quot;Henry VI&quot;, &quot;The Rise of Edward IV&quot; and &quot;Richard III&quot;) with David Warner as Henry and Peggy Ashcroft as Margaret. Directed for television by Robin Midgley and Michael Hayes, the plays were presented as more than simply filmed theatre, with the core idea being &quot;to recreate theatre production in televisual terms – not merely to observe it, but to get to the heart of it.&quot; Filming was done on the RSC stage, but not during actual performances, thus allowing cameras to get close to the actors, and cameramen with hand-held cameras to shoot battle scenes. Additionally, camera platforms were created around the theatre. In all, twelve cameras were used, allowing the final product to be edited more like a film than a piece of static filmed theatre. Filming was done following the 1964 run of the plays at Stratford-upon-Avon, and took place over an eight-week period, with fifty-two BBC staff working alongside eighty-four RSC staff to bring the project to fruition. In 1966, the production was repeated on BBC 1 where it was re-edited into eleven episodes of fifty minutes each. The first episode, &quot;The Inheritance&quot; covered Acts 1, 2, 3 and Act 4, Scene 1, ending with Henry choosing a red rose and inadvertently aligning himself with Somerset. The second episode, &quot;Margaret of Anjou&quot;, presented the rest of &quot;1 Henry VI&quot;, beginning with Talbot confronting the French general at Harfleur (Bordeaux in the play), as well as the first half of Act 1, Scene 1 of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; (concluding with Henry and Margaret departing from the court).

Another television version of the play was produced by the BBC in 1981 for their &quot;BBC Television Shakespeare&quot; series, although the episode did not air until 1983. Directed by Jane Howell, the play was presented as the first part of the tetralogy (all four adaptations directed by Howell) with linked casting. Henry was played by Peter Benson, Margaret by Julia Foster, Talbot by Trevor Peacock and Joan by Brenda Blethyn. Howell&#x27;s presentation of the complete first historical tetralogy was one of the most lauded achievements of the entire BBC series, and prompted Stanley Wells to argue that the productions were &quot;probably purer than any version given in the theatre since Shakespeare&#x27;s time.&quot; Michael Mannheim was similarly impressed, calling the tetralogy &quot;a fascinating, fast-paced and surprisingly tight-knit study in political and national deterioration.&quot;
Inspired by the notion that the political intrigues behind the Wars of the Roses often seemed like playground squabbles, Howell and production designer Oliver Bayldon staged the four plays in a single set resembling a children&#x27;s adventure playground. However, little attempt was made at realism. For example, Bayldon did not disguise the parquet flooring (&quot;it stops the set from literally representing [...] it reminds us we are in a modern television studio&quot;), and in all four productions, the title of the play is displayed within the set itself (on banners in &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; and &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; (where it is visible throughout the entire first scene), on a shroud in &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, and written on a chalkboard by Richard himself in &quot;Richard III&quot;). Many critics felt these set design choices lent the production an air of Brechtian &quot;verfremdungseffekt&quot;. Stanley Wells wrote of the set that it was intended to invite the viewer to &quot;accept the play&#x27;s artificiality of language and action,&quot; Michael Hattaway describes it as &quot;anti-illusionist,&quot; Susan Willis argues that the set allows the productions &quot;to reach theatrically toward the modern world&quot; and Ronald Knowles writes &quot;a major aspect of the set was the subliminal suggestion of childlike anarchy, role-playing, rivalry, game and vandalism, as if all culture were precariously balanced on the shaky foundations of atavistic aggression and power-mad possession.&quot; Another element of &quot;verfremdungseffekt&quot; in this production is seen when Gloucester and Winchester encounter one another at the Tower, both are on horseback, but the horses they ride are hobby-horses, which the actors (David Burke and Frank Middlemass respectively) cause to pivot and prance as they speak. The ridiculousness of this situation works to &quot;effectively undercut their characters&#x27; dignity and status.&quot; The &quot;anti-illusionist&quot; set was also used as a means of political commentary; as the four plays progressed, the set decayed and became more and more dilapidated as social order became more fractious. In the same vein, the costumes become more and more monotone as the four plays move on. &quot;The First Part of Henry the Sixt&quot; features brightly coloured costumes that clearly distinguish the various combatants from one another, but by &quot;The Tragedy of Richard III&quot;, everyone fights in similarly coloured dark costumes, with little to differentiate one army from another. Graham Holderness saw Howell&#x27;s non-naturalistic production as something of a reaction to the BBC&#x27;s adaptation of the &quot;Henriad&quot; in seasons one and two, which had been directed by David Giles in the traditional and straightforward manner favoured by then series producer Cedric Messina; &quot;where Messina saw the history plays conventionally as orthodox Tudor historiography, and [David Giles] employed dramatic techniques that allow that ideology a free and unhampered passage to the spectator, Jane Howell takes a more complex view of the first tetralogy as, simultaneously, a serious attempt at historical interpretation, and as a drama with a peculiarly modern relevance and contemporary application. The plays, to this director, are not a dramatisation of the Elizabethan World Picture but a sustained interrogation of residual and emergent ideologies in a changing society [...] This awareness of the multiplicity of potential meanings in the play required a decisive and scrupulous avoidance of television or theatrical naturalism: methods of production should operate to open the plays out, rather than close them into the immediately recognisable familiarity of conventional Shakespearean production.&quot;

For the most part, Howell&#x27;s adaptation is taken word-for-word from the &quot;First Folio&quot;, with only some relatively minor differences. For example, the adaptation opens differently to the play, with Henry VI singing a lament for his father. Another difference is that Fastolf&#x27;s escape from Rouen is seen rather than merely mentioned. Also worth noting is that Act 5, Scene 1 and Act 5, Scene 2 are reversed so that Act 4, Scene 7 and Act 5, Scene 2 now form one continuous piece. Additionally, numerous lines were cut from almost every scene. Some of the more notable omissions include; in Act 1, Scene 1, absent are Bedford&#x27;s references to children crying and England becoming a marsh since Henry V died: &quot;Posterity await for wretched years/When, at their mothers&#x27; moistened eyes, babes shall suck,/Our isle be made a marish of salt tears,/And none but women left to wail the dead.&quot; (ll.48–51). In Act 1, Scene 2, Alençon&#x27;s praise of the resoluteness of the English army is absent: &quot;Froissart, a countryman of ours, records/England all Olivers and Rolands bred/During the time Edward the Third did reign./More truly now may this be verified,/For none by Samsons and Goliases/It sendeth forth to skirmish.&quot; (ll.29–34). In Act 1, Scene 3, some of the dialogue between Gloucester and Winchester outside the Tower is absent (ll.36–43), whilst in Act 1, Scene 5, so too is Talbot&#x27;s complaint about the French wanting to ransom him for a prisoner of less worth: &quot;But with a baser man-of-arms by far,/Once in contempt they would have bartered me—/Which I, disdaining, scorned, and crav&#x27;d death/Rather than I would be so vile-esteemed&quot; (ll.8–11). In Act 1, Scene 7, some of Charles&#x27; praise of Joan is absent: &quot;A statelier pyramis to her I&#x27;ll rear/Than Rhodope&#x27;s of Memphis ever was./In memory of her, when she is dead,/Her ashes, in an urn more precious/Than the rich-jewelled coffer of Darius,/Transported shall be at high festivals/Before the kings and queens of France&quot; (ll.21–27). In Act 3, Scene 1, some of Warwick&#x27;s attack on Winchester is absent: &quot;You see what mischief – and what murder too –/Hath been enacted through your enmity&quot; (ll.27–28). In Act 4, Scene 6, some of the dialogue between Talbot and John has been removed (ll.6–25). The most interesting omissions come in Act 4, Scene 7. In this scene, twelve of Joan&#x27;s sixteen lines have been cut; the entire seven line speech where she says John Talbot refused to fight her because she is a woman (ll.37–43); the first three lines of her five line mockery of Lucy&#x27;s listing of Talbot&#x27;s titles, &quot;Here&#x27;s a silly, stately style indeed./The Turk, that two-and-fifty kingdoms hath,/Writes not so tedious a style as this&quot; (ll.72–75); and the first two lines of her four line speech where she mocks Lucy, &quot;I think this upstart is old Talbot&#x27;s ghost,/He speaks with such a proud commanding spirit&quot; (ll.86–88). These omissions reduce Joan&#x27;s role in this scene to a virtual spectator, and coupled with this, Brenda Blethyn portrays the character as if deeply troubled by something (presumably the loss of contact with her &#x27;fiends&#x27;).

Another notable stylistic technique used in the adaptation is the multiple addresses direct-to-camera. Much more so than in any of the sequels, the adaptation of &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; has multiple characters addressing the camera continually throughout the play, oftentimes for comic effect. The most noticeable scene in this respect is Act 2, Scene 3, where Talbot meets the Countess of Auvergne. Almost all of her dialogue prior to line 32 (&quot;If thou be he, then thou art prisoner&quot;) is delivered direct to camera, including her incredulous description of the difference between the real Talbot, and the reports she has heard of him. At one point during this speech, Auvergne exclaims &quot;Alas, this is a child, a silly dwarf&quot; (l.21), at which point Talbot himself looks at the camera in disbelief. The comedy of the scene is enhanced by having the 5-foot 10 actor Trevor Peacock playing Talbot, and the 6-foot 3 actress Joanna McCallum playing Auvergne. Elsewhere, addresses to the camera are found throughout the play. For example, as Bedford, Gloucester, Exeter and Winchester leave in Act 1, Scene 1, each one reveals their intentions direct-to-camera (ll.166–177).

Other examples are Joan&#x27;s confession of where she got her sword (1.2.100–101); the Mayor&#x27;s last two lines at the Tower (1.3.89–90); Talbot&#x27;s &quot;My thoughts are whirl&#x27;d like a potter&#x27;s wheel./I know not where I am nor what I do./A witch, by fear, not force, like Hannibal,/Drives back our troops and conquers as she lists&quot; (1.6.19–22); some of Mortimer&#x27;s monologue prior to the arrival of Richard (2.5.22–32); Richard&#x27;s &quot;Plantagenet, I see, must hold his tongue,/Lest it be said, &#x27;Speak, sirrah, when you should:/Must your bold verdict enter talk with lords?&#x27;/Else would I have a fling at Winchester&quot; (3.1.61–64); Exeter&#x27;s soliloquy at the end of Act 3, Scene 1 (ll.190–203); Exeter&#x27;s soliloquy at the end of Act 4, Scene 1 (ll.182–194); most of the dialogue between Suffolk and Margaret as they ignore one another (5.4.16–64); and Suffolk&#x27;s soliloquy, which closes the play (5.6.102–109). Also to-camera is Joan&#x27;s &quot;Poor market folks that come to sell their corn&quot; (3.2.14), which is delivered as if it were a translation of the preceding line for the benefit of the non-French speaking audience.

In 1964, Austrian channel ORF 2 presented an adaptation of the trilogy by Leopold Lindtberg under the title &quot;Heinrich VI&quot;. The cast list from this production has been lost. In 1969, German channel ZDF presented a filmed version of the first part of Peter Palitzsch&#x27;s 1967 two-part adaptation of the trilogy in Stuttgart, &quot;Heinrich VI: Der Krieg der Rosen 1&quot;. The second part, &quot;Eduard IV: Der Krieg der Rosen 2&quot;, was screened in 1971.

===Radio===
In 1923, extracts from all three &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays were broadcast on BBC Radio, performed by the Cardiff Station Repertory Company as the third episode of a series of programs showcasing Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, entitled &quot;Shakespeare Night&quot;. In 1947, BBC Third Programme aired a one-hundred-and-fifty-minute adaptation of the trilogy as part of their &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Historical Plays&quot; series, a six-part adaptation of the eight sequential history plays, with linked casting. Adapted by Maurice Roy Ridley, &quot;King Henry VI&quot; starred John Byron as Henry and Gladys Young as Margaret. Almost the entirety of &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; was cut, with everything related to the conflict in France being removed. In 1952, Third Programme aired an adaptation of the tetralogy by Peter Watts and John Dover Wilson under the general name &quot;The Wars of the Roses&quot;. The tetralogy was adapted into a trilogy but in an unusual way. &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; was simply removed, so the trilogy contained only &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;, &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; and &quot;Richard III&quot;. The adaptation starred Valentine Dyall as Henry and Sonia Dresdel as Margaret. In 1971, BBC Radio 3 presented a two-part adaptation of the trilogy by Raymond Raikes. Part 1 contained an abridged &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; and an abridged version of the first three acts of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;. Part 2 presented Acts 4 and 5 of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; and an abridged &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;. Nigel Lambert played Henry, Barbara Jefford played Margaret, Francis de Wolff played Talbot and Elizabeth Morgan played Joan. In 1977, BBC Radio 4 presented a 26-part serialisation of the eight sequential history plays under the general title &quot;Vivat Rex&quot; (long live the King). Adapted by Martin Jenkins as part of the celebration of the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II, &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; comprised episodes 15 (&quot;Joan of Arc&quot;) and 16 (&quot;The White Rose and the Red&quot;). James Laurenson played Henry, Peggy Ashcroft played Margaret, Clive Swift played Talbot, Hannah Gordon played Joan, and Richard Burton narrated.

In America, in 1936, a heavily edited adaptation of the trilogy was broadcast as part of NBC Blue&#x27;s &quot;Radio Guild&quot; series. Comprising three sixty-minute episodes aired a week apart, the adaptation was written by Vernon Radcliffe and starred Henry Herbert as Henry and Janet Nolan as Margaret. In 1954, CBC Radio presented an adaptation of the trilogy by Andrew Allen, who combined &quot;1 Henry VI&quot;, &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; and &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; into a one-hundred-and-sixty-minute episode. There is no known cast information for this production.

In 1985, German radio channel Sender Freies Berlin broadcast a heavily edited seventy-six-minute two-part adaptation of the octology adapted by Rolf Schneider, under the title &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Rosenkriege&quot;.

===Manga===
Aya Kanno&#x27;s Japanese manga comic &quot;Requiem of the Rose King&quot; is a loose adaptation of the first Shakespearean historical tetralogy, covering &quot;Henry VI&quot; and &quot;Richard III&quot;.

<doc id="184846" wikidata="Q1236216" url="?curid=184846" title="Henry VI, Part 2">
<text>Henry VI, Part 2 (often written as 2 Henry VI) is a history play by William Shakespeare believed to have been written in 1591 and set during the lifetime of King Henry VI of England. Whereas &quot;Henry VI, Part 1&quot; deals primarily with the loss of England&#x27;s French territories and the political machinations leading up to the Wars of the Roses, and &quot;Henry VI, Part 3&quot; deals with the horrors of that conflict, &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; focuses on the King&#x27;s inability to quell the bickering of his nobles, the death of his trusted adviser Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, the rise of the Duke of York and the inevitability of armed conflict. As such, the play culminates with the opening battle of the War, the First Battle of St Albans (1455).

Although the &quot;Henry VI&quot; trilogy may not have been written in chronological order, the three plays are often grouped together with &quot;Richard III&quot; to form a tetralogy covering the entire Wars of the Roses saga, from the death of Henry V in 1422 to the rise to power of Henry VII in 1485. It was the success of this sequence of plays that firmly established Shakespeare&#x27;s reputation as a playwright.

&quot;Henry VI, Part 2&quot; has the largest cast of all Shakespeare&#x27;s plays and is seen by many critics as the best of the &quot;Henry VI&quot; trilogy.

== Synopsis ==

The play begins with the marriage of King Henry VI of England to the young Margaret of Anjou. Margaret is the protégée and lover of William de la Pole, 4th Earl of Suffolk, who aims to influence the king through her. The major obstacle to Suffolk and Margaret&#x27;s plan is the Lord Protector; Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, who is extremely popular with the common people and deeply trusted by the King. Gloucester&#x27;s wife, however, has designs on the throne, and has been led by an agent of Suffolk to dabble in necromancy. She summons a spirit and demands it reveal the future to her, but its prophecies are vague and before the ritual is finished, she is interrupted and arrested. At court she is then banished, greatly to the embarrassment of Gloucester. Suffolk then conspires with Cardinal Beaufort and the Duke of Somerset to bring about Gloucester&#x27;s ruin. Suffolk accuses Gloucester of treason and has him imprisoned, but before Gloucester can be tried, Suffolk sends two assassins to kill him. Meanwhile, Richard, 3rd Duke of York, reveals his claim to the throne to the Earls of Salisbury and Warwick, who pledge to support him.

Suffolk is banished for his role in Gloucester&#x27;s death, whilst Winchester (Cardinal Beaufort) contracts a fever and dies, cursing God. Margaret, horrified at Suffolk&#x27;s banishment, vows to ensure his return, but he is killed by pirates shortly after leaving England, and his head sent back to the distraught Margaret. Meanwhile, York has been appointed commander of an army to suppress a revolt in Ireland. Before leaving, he enlists a former officer of his, Jack Cade, to stage a popular revolt in order to ascertain whether the common people would support York should he make an open move for power. At first, the rebellion is successful, and Cade sets himself up as Mayor of London, but his rebellion is put down when Lord Clifford (a supporter of Henry) persuades the common people, who make up Cade&#x27;s army, to abandon the cause. Cade is killed several days later by Alexander Iden, a Kentish gentleman, into whose garden he climbs looking for food.

York returns to England with his army, claiming that he intends to protect the King from the duplicitous Somerset. York vows to disband his forces if Somerset is arrested and charged with treason. Buckingham swears that Somerset is already a prisoner in the tower, but when Somerset enters (&quot;at liberty&quot;), accompanied by the Queen, York holds Buckingham&#x27;s vow broken, and announces his claim to the throne, supported by his sons, Edward and Richard. The English nobility take sides, some supporting the House of York, others supporting Henry and the House of Lancaster. A battle is fought at St Albans in which the Duke of Somerset is killed by York&#x27;s son Richard, and Lord Clifford by York. With the battle lost, Margaret persuades the distraught King to flee the battlefield and head to London. She is joined by Young Clifford, who vows revenge on the Yorkists for the death of his father. The play ends with York, Edward, Richard, Warwick and Salisbury setting out in pursuit of Henry, Margaret and Clifford.

== Sources ==

Shakespeare&#x27;s primary source for &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; was Edward Hall&#x27;s &quot;The Union of the Two Noble and Illustre Families of Lancaster and York&quot; (1548). He also drew upon the second edition of Raphael Holinshed&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles&quot; (1587). Although Holinshed&#x27;s treatment of the Wars of the Roses is derived in large part from Hall&#x27;s work, even to the point of reproducing large portions of it verbatim, there are enough differences between Hall and Holinshed to establish that Shakespeare must have consulted both of them.

For example, the marked contrast between Henry and Margaret, a recurring theme in the play, comes from Hall, who presents Henry as a &quot;saint-like&quot; victim of circumstances, and Margaret as a cunning and manipulative egotist. Shakespeare must have used Hall to establish York&#x27;s claim to the throne (outlined in 2.2), as the corresponding section in Holinshed adds an extra generation to York&#x27;s lineage. However, the meeting between Buckingham and York before the Battle of St Albans (dramatised in 5.1) is found only in Holinshed.

Only Holinshed contains information about the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1381, which Shakespeare used for the scenes of Cade&#x27;s rebellion throughout Act 4 (for example, details such as having people killed because they could read, and promises of setting up a state with no money). The Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1381 was highly anti-intellectual and anti-textual as well, an aspect that Shakespeare used to characterize his version of Cade&#x27;s Rebellion (while in reality, Cade&#x27;s Rebellion was one of the first popular uprisings in England that used writing to voice their grievances). The presentation of Henry&#x27;s reaction to the rebellion also differs in Hall and Holinshed. In Hall, Henry pardons everyone who surrenders and lets them all return home unpunished, and this is how Shakespeare presents it in the play. In Holinshed, by contrast, Henry convenes a court and has several of the leaders executed (as he did in reality). Another historical parallel found in Holinshed is that Henry is presented as unstable, constantly on the brink of madness, something which is not in Hall, who presents a gentle but ineffective King (again, Shakespeare follows Hall here).

Shakespeare&#x27;s largest departure from Hall and Holinshed is in his conflation of the Cade rebellion, York&#x27;s return from Ireland and the Battle of St Albans into one continuous sequence. Both Hall and Holinshed present these events as covering a four-year period (as they did in reality), but in the play they are presented as one leading directly, and immediately, to the other. This is how the events are depicted in Robert Fabyan&#x27;s &quot;New Chronicles of England and France&quot; (1516), suggesting that this too may have been a source.

Another definite source for Shakespeare was Richard Grafton&#x27;s &quot;A Chronicle at Large&quot; (1569). Like Holinshed, Grafton reproduces large passages of unedited material from Hall, but some sections are exclusive to Grafton, showing Shakespeare must also have consulted him. The false miracle for example (dramatised in 2.1) is found only in Grafton, not in Hall or Holinshed (although a similar scene is also outlined in John Foxe&#x27;s &quot;Acts and Monuments, Book of Martyrs&quot; (1563), with which Shakespeare may have been familiar).

== Date and text ==

=== Date ===
On 12 March 1594, a play was entered in the Stationers&#x27; Register by the bookseller Thomas Millington and printed in quarto by Thomas Creede later that year as &quot;The First part of the Contention betwixt the two famous Houses of Yorke and Lancaster, with the death of the good Duke Humphrey: And the banishment and death of the Duke of Suffolke, and the Tragicall end of the proud Cardinall of VVinchester, vvith the notable Rebellion of Jacke Cade: And the Duke of Yorkes first claime vnto the Crowne&quot;. It has been theorised that &quot;The Contention&quot; is a reported text of a performance of what is today called &quot;Henry VI, Part II&quot;. If so, the play was written no later than 1594.

However, it has been suggested the play may have been written several years earlier. Robert Greene&#x27;s pamphlet &quot;Greene&#x27;s Groats-Worth of Wit&quot; (entered in the Stationers&#x27; Register on 20 September 1592) mocks Shakespeare as &quot;an upstart crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his &#x27;tiger&#x27;s heart wrapped in a player&#x27;s hide&#x27;, supposes that he is as well able to bombast out a blank verse as the best of you.&quot; This parody of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, 1.4.138, where York refers to Margaret as a &quot;tiger&#x27;s heart wrapped in a woman&#x27;s hide!&quot;, proves that &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; was well known by September 1592, which means it must have been staged before 23 June, when the government closed the theatres to prevent the spread of plague. As it is known for certain that &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; was a sequel to &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;, it is certain that if &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; was on stage by June 1592, so too was &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; and that both were probably written in 1591 or 1592.

For a discussion of whether the three parts of the trilogy were composed in chronological order, see &quot;1 Henry VI&quot;.

=== Text ===
The 1594 quarto text of &quot;The Contention&quot; was reprinted twice, in 1600 (in quarto) and 1619 (also in quarto). The 1600 text was printed by Valentine Simmes for Millington. The 1619 text was part of William Jaggard&#x27;s False Folio, which was printed for Thomas Pavier. This text was printed together with a version of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; which had been printed in octavo in 1595 under the title &quot;The True Tragedie of Richard Duke of Yorke, and the death of good King Henrie the Sixt, with the Whole Contention betweene the two Houses, Lancaster and Yorke&quot;. In the False Folio, the two plays were grouped under the general title &quot;The Whole Contention betweene the Two Famous Houses, Lancaster and Yorke, With the Tragicall ends of the good Duke Humfrey, Richard Duke of Yorke, and King Henrie the sixt&quot;. Also printed with &quot;The Whole Contention&quot; was &quot;Pericles, Prince of Tyre&quot;. The 1619 text of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; was not directly taken from &quot;The Contention&quot; however. The original text was edited to correct an error in York&#x27;s outline of his genealogy in 2.2.

The text of the play that today forms &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; was not published until the 1623 &quot;First Folio&quot;, under the title &quot;The second Part of Henry the Sixt, with the death of the Good Duke Humfrey&quot;.

When the play came to be called &quot;Part 2&quot; is unclear, although most critics tend to assume it was the invention of John Heminges and Henry Condell, the editors of the &quot;First Folio&quot;, as there are no references to the play under the title &quot;Part 2&quot;, or any derivative thereof, before 1623.

== Analysis and criticism ==

=== Critical history ===

Some critics argue that the &quot;Henry VI&quot; trilogy were the first ever plays to be based on recent English history, and as such, they deserve an elevated position in the canon, and a more central role in Shakespearean criticism. According to F.P. Wilson for example, &quot;There is no certain evidence that any dramatist before the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 dared to put upon the public stage a play based upon English history [...] so far as we know, Shakespeare was the first.&quot; However, not all critics agree with Wilson here. For example, Michael Taylor argues that there were at least thirty-nine history plays prior to 1592, including the two-part Christopher Marlowe play &quot;Tamburlaine&quot; (1587), Thomas Lodge&#x27;s &quot;The Wounds of Civil War&quot; (1588), George Peele&#x27;s &quot;The Troublesome Reign of King John&quot; (1588), the anonymous &quot;Edmund Ironside&quot; (1590), Robert Green and Thomas Lodge&#x27;s &quot;Selimus&quot; (1591) and another anonymous play, &quot;The True Tragedy of Richard III&quot; (1591). Paola Pugliatti however argues that the case may be somewhere between Wilson and Taylor&#x27;s argument; &quot;Shakespeare may not have been the first to bring English history before the audience of a public playhouse, but he was certainly the first to treat it in the manner of a mature historian rather than in the manner of a worshipper of historical, political and religious myth.&quot;

In any case, there is much more critical disagreement about the play, not the least of which concerns its relationship to &quot;The Contention&quot;.

==== &quot;The Contention&quot; as reported text ====

Over the years, critics have debated the connection between &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; and &quot;The Contention&quot;, to the point where four main theories have emerged:

# &quot;The Contention&quot; is a reconstructed version of a performance of what we today call &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;; i.e. a bad quarto, an attempt by actors to reconstruct the original play from memory and sell it. Originated by Samuel Johnson in 1765 and refined by Peter Alexander in 1929. Traditionally, this is the most accepted theory.
# &quot;The Contention&quot; is an early draft of the play that was published in the 1623 Folio under the title &quot;The second Part of Henry the Sixt&quot;. Originated by Edmond Malone in 1790 as an alternate to Johnson&#x27;s memorial report theory. Supported today by critics such as Steven Urkowitz.
# &quot;The Contention&quot; is &quot;both&quot; a reported text &quot;and&quot; an early draft of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;. This theory has been gaining increasing support from the latter half of the 20th century, and is championed by many modern editors of the play.
# Shakespeare did not write &quot;The Contention&quot; at all; it was an anonymous play which he used as the basis for &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;. Originated by Georg Gottfried Gervinus in 1849, this theory remained popular throughout the nineteenth century, with Robert Greene the leading candidate as a possible author. It has fallen out of favour in the twentieth century.

Traditionally, critical opinion has tended to favour the first theory; that &quot;The Contention&quot; is a bad quarto, a memorial reconstruction, perhaps by the actor who had played Suffolk and/or Cade in early performance. Samuel Johnson put forth this theory in 1765, but was challenged by Edmond Malone in 1790, who suggested that &quot;The Contention&quot; could be an early draft of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;. Malone&#x27;s view was the dominant one until 1929, when Peter Alexander and Madeleine Doran, working independently of one another, re-established the dominance of the bad quarto theory.

They focused on a genealogical error in &quot;The Contention&quot;, which they argue seems unlikely to have been made by an author, and is therefore only attributable to a reporter. In &quot;The Contention&quot;, when York sets out his claim to the throne, he identifies Edmund of Langley as Edward III&#x27;s second son, instead of his fifth. In &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;, Langley is correctly placed in the genealogy. This error renders unnecessary York&#x27;s need to claim the throne through his mother&#x27;s ancestry: were he descended from the second son, he himself would be descended directly from an elder son than Henry. It has been argued that &quot;no one who understood what he was writing – that is, no author – could have made this error, but someone parroting someone else&#x27;s work, of which he himself had but a dim understanding – that is, a reporter – easily could.&quot;

Act 3, Scene 1 has been pinpointed as another scene which provides evidence that &quot;The Contention&quot; is a reported text. In &quot;The Contention&quot;, after the court has turned on Gloucester, Suffolk then illogically switches back to discussing the regentship of France. Horner and Thump are introduced and Gloucester arranges for them to formally duel. At this point, Gloucester leaves, but without any discernible reason. Margaret then strikes Eleanor, Gloucester returns, and he and his wife leave together. Steven Urkowitz (a staunch opponent of the theory of bad quartos in general) argues that the difference in the two scenes is an example of &quot;the finely Shakespearean first choices recorded in the Quarto.&quot; Roger Warren, however, argues that the scene provides strong evidence that &quot;The Contention&quot; is a reported text; &quot;it is not hard to conjecture how the Quarto&#x27;s version came about. The conflicting claims of York and Somerset led to the Armourer and his Man being introduced too soon; whoever was compiling the Quarto text remembered that Humphrey left the stage, though not why, but &quot;did&quot; remember that while he was offstage Margaret struck his wife. The utterly unmotivated exit and reappearance of Humphrey in itself rules out any possibility that the Quarto&#x27;s scene is a legitimate alternative to the Folio version, rather than a confused report of it.&quot;

Further evidence for the reported text theory is provided in how other plays are used throughout &quot;The Contention&quot;. For example, Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus&quot; is quoted in the witchcraft scene (&quot;Now Faustus, what wouldst thou have me do?&quot; (1.3.36) is reproduced as &quot;Now Bolingbroke, what wouldst thou have me do?&quot;), and Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Edward II&quot; is paraphrased in Act 3, Scene 1 (Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;The wild O&#x27;Neill, with swarms of Irish kerns,/Lives uncontrolled within the English pale&quot; (2.2.163–164) becomes &quot;The wild O&#x27;Neill, my lords, is up in arms,/With troops of Irish kerns that uncontrolled/Doth plant themselves within the English pale&quot;). Even a line from &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; is used in Act 3, Scene 1 (&quot;If our King Henry had shook hands with death&quot; (1.4.103)), all of which seems to suggest that, as is so often the case in the bad quartos, the reporter was filling in blanks (i.e. passages he could not remember) with extracts from other plays.

==== &quot;The Contention&quot; as early draft ====

Steven Urkowitz has spoken at great length about the debate between the bad quarto theory and the early draft theory, coming down firmly on the side of the early draft. Urkowitz argues that the quarto of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; and the octavo of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; actually present scholars with a unique opportunity to see a play evolving, as Shakespeare edited and rewrote certain sections; &quot;the texts of &quot;2&quot; and &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; offer particularly rich illustrations of textual variation and theatrical transformation.&quot; Urkowitz cites the dialogue in the opening scene of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; as especially strong evidence of the early draft theory. In &quot;The Contention&quot;, Henry receives Margaret with joy and an exclamation that all his worldly troubles are behind him. Margaret is then depicted as utterly humble, vowing to love the King no matter what. After the initial meeting then, Henry asks Margaret to sit beside him before bidding the Lords to stand nearby and welcome her. In &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;, on the other hand, Henry is more cautious in greeting Margaret, seeing her as a relief for his problems, but only if she and he can find common ground and love one another. She herself is also much bolder and self-congratulatory in &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; than in &quot;The Contention&quot;. Additionally, in &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; there is no reference to anyone sitting, and the lords kneel before speaking to Margaret. Urkowitz summarises these differences by arguing,
In the visible geometry of courtly ceremony, the Folio version offers us a bold Queen Margaret and an exuberant king who stands erect while the visibly subordinated nobles kneel before them. In contrast to the modest queen seated beside the king surrounded by standing nobles, in this text at the equivalent moment, we have an assertive queen standing upright with her monarch, visibly subordinating the kneeling, obedient lords. Distinct theatrical representations of psychological and political tensions distinguish the two versions of the passage. Both texts &quot;work&quot; by leading an audience through an elaborate ceremonial display fraught with symbolic gestures of emotional attachment, sanctification, regal authority, and feudal obedience, but each displays a distinct pattern of language and coded gestures. Such fine-tuning of dramatic themes and actions are staples of professional theatrical writing.
The differences in the texts are of the sort one tends to find in texts that were altered from an original form, and Urkowitz cites Eric Rasmussen, E.A.J. Honigmann and Grace Ioppolo as supporting this view. He refers to the case of Richard Brinsley Sheridan&#x27;s &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; (1777), which existed in an earlier form, also by Sheridan, in a two-part play &quot;The Slanderers&quot; and &quot;Sir Peter Teazel&quot;, which he argues contain the same type of modifications as is found in the &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays.

Urkowitz is not alone in finding evidence to support the early draft theory. For example, in &quot;The Contention&quot;, Margery Jourdayne is referred to as &quot;the cunning witch of Ely&quot;, but in &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; she is referred to merely as &quot;the cunning witch.&quot; The traditional argument to explain this disparity is that such information was added by either Shakespeare or someone else during rehearsals, but was not found in the prompt book which was used to print the &quot;First Folio&quot;. However, R.B. McKerrow argues against the likelihood of this theory. He asks why a writer would go back to a chronicle source to add a piece of information which is of no importance dramatically, and brings nothing to the scene. McKerrow suggests that the line was cut after performance. A similar example is found in Act 4, Scene 7 where Cade orders his men to kill Lord Saye and Sir James Comer. In &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;, Cade orders them to cut off Saye&#x27;s head and then go to Cromer&#x27;s house and kill him, but in &quot;The Contention&quot;, he tells them to bring Saye to &quot;Standard in Cheapside&quot;, and then go to Cromer&#x27;s house in &quot;Mile End Green.&quot; McKerrow argues that such unimportant detail suggests removal after performance rather than addition before performance.

More evidence is found in Act 2, Scene 1. In &quot;The Contention&quot;, after Winchester has accepted Gloucester&#x27;s challenge to a duel (l. 38; &quot;Marry, when thou dar&#x27;est&quot;), there is additional dialogue not found in &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;;

&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;GLOUCESTER&quot;
Dare? I tell thee priest,
Plantagenets could never brook the dare.

&quot;WINCHESTER&quot;
I am Plantagenet as well as thou,
And son of John of Gaunt.

&quot;GLOUCESTER&quot;
In bastardy.

&quot;WINCHESTER&quot;
I scorn thy words.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Again, McKerrow&#x27;s argument here is not that these lines were added during rehearsals, but that they existed in an early draft of the play and were removed after rehearsals, as they were simply deemed unnecessary; the animosity between the two had already been well established.

However, the theory that &quot;The Contention&quot; may be an early draft does not necessarily imply that it could not also represent a bad quarto. Traditionally, most critics (such as Alexander, Doran, McKerrow and Urkowitz) have looked at the problem as an either–or situation; &quot;The Contention&quot; is &quot;either&quot; a reported text &quot;or&quot; an early draft, but recently there has been some argument that it may be both. For example, this is the theory supported by Roger Warren in his &quot;Oxford Shakespeare&quot; edition of the play. It is also the theory advanced by Randall Martin in his &quot;Oxford Shakespeare&quot; edition of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;. The crux of the argument is that both the evidence for the bad quarto theory and the evidence for the early draft theory are so compelling that neither is able to completely refute the other. As such, if the play contains evidence of being both a reported text &quot;and&quot; an early draft, it must be both; i.e. &quot;The Contention&quot; represents a reported text &quot;of&quot; an early draft of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;. Shakespeare wrote an early version of the play, which was staged. Shortly after that staging, some of the actors constructed a bad quarto from it and had it published. In the meantime, Shakespeare had rewritten the play into the form found in the &quot;First Folio&quot;. Warren argues that this is the only theory which can account for the strong evidence for both reporting and revision, and it is a theory which is gaining increased support in the late twentieth/early twenty-first century.

=== Language ===

Language, throughout the play, helps to establish the theme as well as the tone of each particular episode. For example, the opening speech of the play is an ornate, formal declaration by Suffolk:

&lt;poem&gt;
As by your high imperial majesty
I had in charge at my depart for France,
As Procurator to your excellence,
To marry Princess Margaret for your grace,
So in the famous ancient city Tours,
In presence of the Kings of France and Sicil,
The Dukes of Orléans, Calabre, Bretagne, and Alençon,
Seven earls, twelve barons, and twenty reverend bishops,
I have performed my task and was espoused,
And humbly now upon my bended knee,
In sight of England and her lordly peers,
Deliver up my title in the Queen
To your most gracious hands, that are the substance
Of that great shadow I did represent:
The happiest gift that ever marquis gave,
The fairest queen that ever king received.
::::::: (1.1.1–16)
&lt;/poem&gt;

The substance of Suffolk&#x27;s speech is &quot;As I was instructed to marry Margaret on your behalf, I did so, and now I deliver her to you.&quot; However, the formality of the scene and the importance of the event require him to deliver this message in heightened language, with the formal significance of Henry&#x27;s marriage to Margaret mirrored in the formal language used by Suffolk to announce that marriage.

Language conveys the importance of religion throughout the play. Henry&#x27;s language often echoes the Bible. For example, hearing of the Cade rebellion, he comments &quot;Ο graceless men, they know not what they do&quot; (4.4.37), echoing the Gospel of Luke: &quot;Father, forgive them: for they know not what they do&quot; (23:34). Earlier in the play, he refers to heaven as &quot;the treasury of everlasting joy&quot; (2.1.18), recalling the Gospel of Matthew&#x27;s &quot;lay up treasures for yourselves in heaven&quot; (6:20), and then a few lines later he muses &quot;blessèd are the peacemakers on earth&quot; (2.1.34), echoing Jesus&#x27; Sermon on the Mount. On both of these occasions however, Cardinal Winchester, ostensibly a pious man, distorts Henry&#x27;s genuine piety. After Henry&#x27;s assessment of heaven, Winchester says to Gloucester, &quot;Thy heaven is on earth, thine eyes and thoughts/Beat on a crown, the treasure of thy heart&quot; (2.1.19–20). Then, after Henry praises peacemakers, Winchester hypocritically says, &quot;Let me be blessèd for the peace I make,/Against this proud Protector with my sword&quot; (2.1.35–36). The Cardinal mocks religion shortly before the murder of Gloucester. Speaking of the forthcoming murder, Suffolk says, &quot;And to preserve my sovereign from his foe,/Say but the word and I will be his priest&quot; (3.1.271–272), to which Winchester responds &quot;But I would have him dead, my Lord of Suffolk,/Ere you can take due orders for a priest&quot; (3.1.273–274), disdaining priesthood and trivialising murder. After Gloucester is dead, Winchester continues to blaspheme himself, proclaiming the death of Gloucester to be &quot;God&#x27;s secret judgement&quot; (3.2.31), a callous and knowing distortion.

Shakespeare uses language to distinguish between different types of characters. The courtly scenes tend to be spoken in blank verse, whereas the commons tend to speak in prose, with fewer metaphors and less decorative language (Shakespeare uses this contrast in several plays, such as &quot;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot;, where prose marks the servants out from their masters). When power begins to go to Jack Cade&#x27;s head, he begins to slip into a more courtly way of speaking. This is most noticeable in his adoption of the &#x27;royal we&#x27;, using phrases such as &quot;our jurisdiction regal&quot; (4.7.24), and &quot;we charge and command&quot; (4.7.116).

The longest speech in the play is Margaret&#x27;s lament to Henry after they have found Gloucester&#x27;s dead body. This lengthy speech is full of classical allusions, elaborate metaphors and verbosity as Margaret moves through a litany of topics in an effort to make her point:

&lt;poem&gt;

Be woe for me, more wretched than he is.
What, dost thou turn away and hide thy face?
I am no loathsome leper, look on me.
What, art thou like the adder waxen deaf?
Be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen.
Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester&#x27;s tomb?
Why then Queen Margaret was ne&#x27;er thy joy.
Erect his statua and worship it,
And make my image but an alehouse sign.
Was I for this nigh wracked upon the sea,
And twice by awkward winds from England&#x27;s bank
Drove back again unto my native clime?
What boded this, but well forewarning winds
Did seem to say, &#x27;Seek not a scorpion&#x27;s nest,
Nor set no footing on this unkind shore&#x27;?
What did I then, but cursed the gentle gusts
And he that loosed them forth their brazen caves,
And bid them blow towards England&#x27;s blessèd shore,
Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock?
Yet Aeolus would not be a murderer,
But left that hateful office unto thee.
The pretty vaulting sea refused to drown me,
Knowing that thou wouldst have me drowned on shore
With tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness.
The splitting rocks cow&#x27;red in the sinking sands,
And would not dash me with their ragged sides,
Because thy flinty heart, more hard than they,
Might in thy palace perish Margaret.
As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs,
When from thy shore the tempest beat us back,
I stood upon the hatches in the storm,
And when the dusky sky began to rob
My earnest-gaping sight of thy land&#x27;s view,
I took a costly jewel from my neck—
A heart it was, bound in with diamonds—
And threw it towards thy land. The sea received it,
And so I wished thy body might my heart.
And even with this I lost fair England&#x27;s view,
And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart,
And called them blind and dusky spectacles,
For losing ken of Albion&#x27;s wishèd coast.
How often have I tempted Suffolk&#x27;s tongue—
The agent of thy foul inconstancy—
To sit and witch me, as Ascanius did,
When he to madding Dido would unfold
His father&#x27;s acts, commenced in burning Troy!
Am I not witched like her? Or thou not false like him?
Ay me, I can no more. Die Margaret,
For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.
::::::: (3.2.73–121)

&lt;/poem&gt;

There is some debate amongst critics as to the meaning and purpose of this speech, although all tend to agree that the meaning is inherently tied up in the elaborate language. Some critics (such as Stanley Wells) argue that the speech, with its wordiness, abstraction, strained allusions, and lengthy metaphors, is poorly written, evidence that Shakespeare was not yet in control of his medium. Proponents of this theory point to &quot;The Contention&quot;, where only seven lines are retained, with the argument being that the rest of the speech was cut from performance. L.C. Knights, by contrast, argues that the speech is deliberately excessive and highly-wrought because Margaret is trying to deflect the already confused and dejected Henry from accusing Suffolk of the murder.

Peter Hall suggested that &quot;the speech is there to establish the emotional, hysterical side of Margaret&#x27;s nature. I think that is why the language gets so extremely elaborate – it is an attempt by Margaret to contain her turbulent emotions by expressing them in such a strange way.&quot;

The complete antithesis of this theory has also been suggested as a possibility: that the speech shows not that Margaret is losing control, but that she is completely in control of herself and her emotions. This theory is most noticeable in how director Jane Howell had Julia Foster act the part in the 1981 &quot;BBC Television Shakespeare&quot; adaptation. Here, Margaret uses her speech to vent her intense emotions, not to contain them. The far ranging metaphors and classical allusions are her way of letting go of her pent up rage and emotion, her disdain for Henry and her inherent passion.

In Terry Hands&#x27; 1977 production for the Royal Shakespeare Company, Margaret (played by Helen Mirren) tried to bring Henry back from the brink of madness by engaging his mind in an elaborate, difficult to follow verbal dance. Henry&#x27;s preceding speech to Suffolk, where he demands Suffolk not look at him, and then immediately demands that he wants to look into Suffolk&#x27;s eyes was played by Alan Howard in such a way as to suggest that Henry was losing his grip on reality, and in response to this, Mirren played the speech in such a way as to engage Henry&#x27;s mind in the here and now, focus his thoughts and prevent them drifting away.

=== Themes ===

==== Henry&#x27;s weakness ====

A major theme of the play is Henry&#x27;s inherent weakness and his inability to control the country or even his own court. According to Martin, Henry&#x27;s weakness as king was the main reason that many nineteenth century critics judged &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; to lack emotion: Henry was so inept that audiences could not empathise with him, and hence, his tragedy was diminished. There are numerous examples throughout the play which such critics could have focused on. For example, Henry fails to unite his bickering nobles, and instead allows them to push him around as they decide for themselves how to act and what to do, and at the same time, he allows himself to be utterly dominated by Margaret. He is so subservient that he consents to the imprisonment of a man (Gloucester) he loves and knows to be innocent, and then attempts to hide from the implications of this decision, trying to leave the court after Gloucester&#x27;s arrest:

&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;KING HENRY&quot;
My lords, what to your wisdoms seemeth best
Do or undo, as if ourself were here.

&quot;QUEEN MARGARET&quot;
What, will your highness leave the parliament?

&quot;KING HENRY&quot;
Ay Margaret, my heart is drowned with grief,
Whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes.
::::::: (3.1.195–199)
&lt;/poem&gt;

This leads Henry to a realisation of how he has failed Gloucester, and to lament his own lack of decisiveness and resolution:

&lt;poem&gt;
And as the butcher takes away the calf,
And binds the wretch, and beats it when it strains,
Bearing it to the bloody slaughterhouse,
Even so remorseless have they borne him hence;
And as the dam runs lowing up and down,
Looking the way her harmless young one went,
And can do naught but wail her darling&#x27;s loss,
Even so myself bewails good Gloucester&#x27;s case
With sad unhelpful tears, and with dimmed eyes
Look after him, and cannot do him good,
So mighty are his vowèd enemies.
::::::: (3.1.210–220)
&lt;/poem&gt;

Another example of his weakness as ruler is seen in his utter indifference to the vital decision of choosing a new French regent; as Somerset and York debate the issue, each trying to convince Henry that they should be the one to get the job, Henry dismissively declares, &quot;For my part, noble Lords, I care not which:/Or Somerset or York, all&#x27;s one to me&quot; (1.3.102–103). This lack of concern is forcibly emphasised when Somerset later tells Henry that all French territories have been lost, and Henry responds nonchalantly, &quot;Cold news, Lord Somerset; but God&#x27;s will be done&quot; (3.1.86). His lack of decisive leadership is even referred to by others; Margaret claims that &quot;Henry my lord is cold in great affairs,/Too full of foolish pity&quot; (3.1.224–225). Later, when the Irish post appears with news of rebellion, York says he will do whatever Henry deems necessary, to which Suffolk responds &quot;Why, our authority is his consent,/And what we do establish he confirms&quot; (3.1.316–317).

Henry is presented as a good man, but a poor king, to whom Roger Warren refers as &quot;a man of deep religious conviction but no political acumen.&quot; He is a weak leader, and it is partly his failure to assert his authority that is responsible for the chaos that takes over the country. As director Peter Hall says, &quot;In theory, Henry should be a good king. He applies Christian ethics to government. But he is up against men who don&#x27;t. They justify their behaviour by invoking the great sanctions – God, the King, Parliament, the People – that unscrupulous statesmen, motivated by the naked desire to be on top, have used throughout the ages. Here is the central irony of the play: Henry&#x27;s Christian goodness produces evil.&quot;

==== Contrast between Henry and Margaret ====

Another major theme throughout the play is the contrast between Margaret and Henry, something which is introduced when they first meet. Henry thanks God for bringing Margaret to him, and exclaims &quot;For thou hast given me in this beauteous face/A world of earthly blessing to my soul,/If sympathy of love unite our thoughts&quot; (1.1.21–23). The irony here, much commented on by critics, is that this unity is exactly what does not happen – their thoughts never unite, and their contrasting and incompatible attitudes are seen time and again throughout the play. For example, after the false miracle, Henry is distraught and laments, &quot;O God, seest thou this and bear&#x27;st so long?&quot; (2.1.150), while Margaret&#x27;s response is much more mundane; &quot;It made me laugh to see the villain run&quot; (2.1.151). When Buckingham arrives to bring news to Henry of Eleanor&#x27;s dabbling in necromancy, Henry&#x27;s reaction is pious and sorrowful, &quot;O God, what mischiefs work the wicked ones,/Heaping confusion on their heads thereby&quot; (2.1.181–182). Margaret&#x27;s response, however, is combative, using the news to forward her own agenda; &quot;Gloucester, see here the tainture of thy nest,/And look thyself be faultless, thou wert best&quot; (2.1.183–184). Later, when Horner and Thump are about to fight, Henry sees the contest as a sacred point of honour: &quot;A God&#x27;s name, see the lists and all things fit;/Here let them end it, and God defend the right&quot; (2.3.54–55). Margaret however, is simply looking forward to a fight; &quot;For purposely therefore,/Left I the court to see this quarrel tried&quot; (2.3.52–53). Henry is &quot;fatally married to his polar opposite.&quot;
The contrast between them is perhaps most forcibly realised when Gloucester dies in Act 3, Scene 2. Margaret makes a speech in which she points out how it is unfair to accuse Suffolk of the murder simply because Suffolk and Gloucester were enemies, as she and Gloucester&#x27;s wife were enemies too, so if Suffolk is a suspect, so should she be one as well; &quot;Ay me unhappy,/To be a queen, and crowned with infamy&quot; (70–71). Again, she is turning events to focus on herself. Henry however, completely ignores her, calling out sorrowfully; &quot;Ah, woe is me for Gloucester, wretched man&quot; (72). This situation is repeated during the Cade rebellion, but this time they ignore one another. After the rebels deliver their terms to Henry, he tells Buckingham he will speak with Cade, but Margaret is concerned only with herself and Suffolk (whose head she is now carrying). Speaking to the head she ignores Henry&#x27;s problems and exclaims, &quot;Ah barbarous villain! Hath this lovely face/Ruled like a wandering planet over me,/And could it not enforce them to relent,/That were unworthy to behold the same?&quot; (4.4.14–17). Henry however ignores this, and continues to deal with the rebel demands, saying simply, &quot;Lord Saye, Jack Cade hath sworn to have thy head&quot; (4.4.18). This tendency for them to ignore one another is another example of their incompatibility, their failure to unite in thoughts.

==== Religion ====
Religion is a fundamental fact of life to Henry, who is presented as truly pious. Shakespeare may have taken this aspect of Henry&#x27;s character from Edward Hall&#x27;s description of him: &quot;He did abhor of his own nature, all the vices, as well of the body as of the soul; and from his very infancy he was of honest conversation and pure integrity; no knower of evil, and a keeper of all goodness; a despiser of all things which were wont to cause the minds of mortal men to slide or appair. Besides this, patience was so radicate in his heart that of all the injuries to him committed (which were no small number) he never asked vengeance nor punishment, but for that rendered to Almighty God, his Creator, hearty thanks, thinking that by this trouble and adversity his sins were to him forgotten and forgiven.&quot;

When Henry first meets Margaret, his reaction is to welcome her, and then immediately thank God for bringing her to him; &quot;I can express no kinder sign of love/Than this kind kiss. O Lord that lends me life,/Lend me a heart replete with thankfulness!&quot; (1.1.18–20). Hearing later of the false miracle, even before meeting Simpcox, Henry exclaims, &quot;Now God be praised, that to believing souls/Gives light in darkness, comfort in despair&quot; (2.1.64–65). Henry accepts the authenticity of the event without evidence, trusting in his faith that it is true and that God has performed a miracle. Later, when Henry is defending Gloucester against accusations of treason, he uses two religious images to get his point across: &quot;Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent/From meaning treason to our royal person/As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove&quot; (3.1.69–71). Upon seeing the delirious Winchester, Henry exclaims &quot;O thou eternal mover of the heavens,/Look with a gentle eye upon this wretch&quot; (3.3.19–20). Then, after Winchester&#x27;s death, Warwick comments &quot;So bad a death argues a monstrous life&quot;, to which Henry replies &quot;Forbear to judge, for we are sinners all&quot; (3.3.30–31).

Henry believes that justice, truth and guilt are determined by God, not through human actions. After the fight between Horner and Thump, Henry announces,

&lt;poem&gt;
For by his death we do perceive his guilt.
And God in justice hath revealed to us
The truth and innocence of this poor fellow,
Which he had thought to have murdered wrongfully.
::::::: (2.3.101–104)
&lt;/poem&gt;

Indeed, so devoted to God is Henry that other characters comment on it. For example, when Margaret is mockingly describing Henry to Suffolk, she says,

&lt;poem&gt;
But all his mind is bent to holiness,
To number Ave-Maries on his beads,
His champions are the prophets and apostles,
His weapons holy saws of sacred writ,
His study is his tilt-yard, and his loves
Are brazen images of canonized saints.
I would the college of the cardinals
Would choose him Pope, and carry him to Rome,
And set the triple crown upon his head;
That were a state fit for his holiness.
::::::: (1.3.56–65)
&lt;/poem&gt;

York twice refers to Henry&#x27;s piousness. First, when outlining his plan to assume power he refers to Henry as a king &quot;Whose church-like humours fits not for a crown&quot; (1.1.246). Then, when making his argument as to why he should be king, he says to Henry, &quot;Thy hand is made to grasp a palmer&#x27;s staff/And not to grace an aweful princely sceptre&quot; (5.1.97–98).

==== Justice ====
Ideas of justice are paramount throughout the play, especially the notion of where justice comes from and who determines it. This is hinted at when Thump first meets Henry, and Henry asks Gloucester&#x27;s opinion. Gloucester says,

&lt;poem&gt;
And let these have a day appointed them
For single combat in convenient place,
For he hath witness of his servant&#x27;s malice.
This is the law, and this Duke Humphrey&#x27;s doom.
::::::: (1.3.208–211)
&lt;/poem&gt;

Of this scene, Michael Hattaway has commented, &quot;the feudal ritual of trial by combat is reduced to the grotesque fights between the drunken armourer and his apprentice [...] It serves to mirror the realities of the play: instead of seeing justice determined by God with regards to the rights of the adversaries, here we see simply a trial of might.&quot; As Henry himself says,

&lt;poem&gt;
For by his death we do perceive his guilt.
And God in justice hath revealed to us
The truth and innocence of this poor fellow,
Which he had thought to have murdered wrongfully.
::::::: (2.3.101–104)
&lt;/poem&gt;

He returns to this notion later, again arguing that truth is a defence against death and defeat:

&lt;poem&gt;
What stronger breastplate than a heart untainted?
Thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just;
And he but naked, though locked up in steel,
Whose conscience with injustice is corrupted.
::::::: (3.2.232–235)
&lt;/poem&gt;

Henry believes in the purity of justice, and cannot imagine how it could possibly be corrupt; &quot;And poise the cause in justice&#x27; equal scales/Whose beam stands sure, whose rightful cause prevails&quot; (2.1.199–200).

However, the perversion of justice is also a dominant theme throughout the play, despite Henry&#x27;s inability to see it. One of the most famous lines in the play, spoken by the rebel Cade&#x27;s sidekick Dick the Butcher, is &quot;the first thing we do, let&#x27;s kill all the lawyers&quot;. Whether this means that lawyers are the protectors of justice, or the agents of its corruption is disputed.

Gloucester assures Eleanor that as long as he has truth on his side, his enemies cannot destroy him: &quot;I must offend before I be attainted,/And had I twenty times so many foes,/And each of them had twenty times their power,/All these could not procure me any scathe/So long as I am loyal, true, and crimeless&quot; (2.4.60–64). His claims prove false, however, as he is arrested on false charges and then assassinated before his trial. Later in the play, Lord Saye makes a similar claim. When Buckingham warns him to be careful as the rebels are targeting people like him, Saye responds &quot;The trust I have is in mine innocence,/And therefore am I bold and resolute&quot; (4.4.58–59). Like Humphrey, his &quot;innocence&quot; does not save him, and both he and his son-in-law are killed by the rebels.

The nobles disdain for justice is revealed more forcibly when Henry, unaware that Gloucester is dead, asks the court to treat him fairly, and Margaret, knowing he is both innocent and dead, responds, &quot;God forbid any malice should prevail/That faultless may condemn a noble man&quot; (3.2.23–24). As Hattaway points out &quot;In England under Henry, law bears little relation to divinity and stands divorced from equity. The regal and judicial roles of the king&#x27;s court are hopelessly confused, so that the status of the institution itself is compromised.&quot;

The lords&#x27; failure to understand the need for an impartial and functioning judiciary is echoed in the rebellion; &quot;The virulent ambition and hostility to law that characterised the barons equally characterise the workmen,&quot; suggesting there is no difference between the old order and the new. This is evident in Cade&#x27;s speech after ordering the execution of Lord Saye; &quot;The proudest peer in the realm shall not wear a head on his shoulders unless he pay me tribute. There shall not a maid be married but she shall pay to me her maidenhead ere they have it. Men shall hold of me &quot;in capite&quot;. And we charge and command that their wives be as free as heart can wish or tongue can tell&quot; (4.7.112–117). In this proposed new world order, Cade envisions establishing an autocracy where all will pay fealty to him, and where his laws, which he can make arbitrarily, stand for everyone. As such, in this political system, as in the old, law and justice seem to have little relevance.

==== Physical destruction ====

Physical violence permeates the play, with many characters dying violently. Gloucester is suffocated in his bed; Winchester dies in a passionate frenzy; Suffolk is beheaded; Somerset and Clifford are killed in battle; Cade has Matthew Gough, Humphrey Stafford, William Stafford, Lord Saye, James Comer, and the Clerk of Chatham executed during the rebellion, and is then killed and beheaded himself by Alexander Iden.

Gloucester&#x27;s death in particular is associated with the physical, as seen in Warwick&#x27;s detailed description of the body;

&lt;poem&gt;
See how the blood is settled in his face.
Oft have I seen a timely-parted ghost,
Of ashy semblance, meagre, pale, and bloodless,
Being all descended to the labouring heart,
Who in the conflict that it holds with death
Attracts the same for aidance &#x27;gainst the enemy,
Which with the heart there cools, and ne&#x27;er returneth
To blush and beautify the cheek again.
But see, his face is black and full of blood;
His eyeballs further out than when he lived,
Staring full ghastly like a strangled man;
His hair upreared, his nostrils stretched with struggling,
His hands abroad displayed, as one that grasped
And tugged for life and was by strength subdued.
Look on the sheets: his hair, you see, is sticking;
His well-proportioned beard made rough and rugged,
Like to the summer&#x27;s corn by tempest lodged.
It cannot be but he was murdered here.
The least of all these signs were probable.
::::::: (3.2.160–178)
&lt;/poem&gt;

Winchester&#x27;s death is also physically grotesque as he distorts his face and curses God, haunted by the ghost of Gloucester.

However, many of the after-death actions are even more macabre than the deaths themselves. Suffolk&#x27;s head is delivered to Margaret, who carries it around court for the last two acts of the play. Lord Stafford and his brother are killed and their bodies dragged through the streets behind horses. Lord Saye and his son-in-law are beheaded and their heads carried throughout the streets on poles and made to kiss. Cade is beheaded and his head delivered to the king. Not only is physical violence presented as a major theme, but so too is physical desecration, a disregard for the body after death.

== Performance ==

After the original 1592 performances, the complete text of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; seems to have been rarely acted. The first recorded performance after Shakespeare&#x27;s day was on 23 April 1864 (Shakespeare&#x27;s tercentenary) at the Surrey Theatre in London, as a stand-alone performance, with director James Anderson playing York and Cade. Of this production, &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; wrote, &quot;It is a revival, or rather restoration to the stage, of an utterly neglected work, which has not been played for 270 years.&quot; The next definite performance was in 1889, when George Osmond Tearle directed another stand-alone production at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon, starring Erskine Lewis as Henry and Ellen Cranston as Margaret. In 1899, F.R. Benson directed another stand-alone production of the play at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre. In 1906, he revived the play, and included &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; and &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; in a production of Shakespeare&#x27;s two tetralogies, performed over eight nights. As far as can be ascertained, this was not only the first performance of the octology, but was also the first definite performance of both the tetralogy and the trilogy. Benson himself played Henry and his wife, Constance Benson, played Margaret.

In 1951, Douglas Seale directed a production at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre, starring Paul Daneman as Henry, Rosalind Boxall as Margaret, John Arnatt as York and Alfred Burke as Gloucester. &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; has not been performed as a stand-alone play since then, although Seale&#x27;s production was so successful that &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; followed in 1952, and &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; in 1953, all with linked casting.

A production that made much of its unedited status came in 1977, at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, where Terry Hands presented all three &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays with Alan Howard as Henry and Helen Mirren as Margaret. Although the production was only moderately successful at the box office, it was critically lauded at the time for Alan Howard&#x27;s unique portrayal of Henry. Howard adopted historical details concerning the real Henry&#x27;s madness into his performance, presenting the character as constantly on the brink of a mental and emotional breakdown. Also praised was the staging of the battle of St Albans, which was fought between the principal characters only, without any extras or suggestions of it being a larger battle, thus emphasising that the whole conflict grew from what was originally a small family squabble. Possibly as a reaction to a recent adaptation of the trilogy under the general title &quot;Wars of the Roses&quot;, which was strongly political, Hands attempted to ensure his own production was entirely apolitical; &quot;&quot;Wars of the Roses&quot; was a study in power politics: its central image was the conference table, and Warwick, the scheming king-maker, was the central figure. But that&#x27;s not Shakespeare. Shakespeare goes far beyond politics. Politics is a very shallow science.&quot; Aside from Howard and Mirren, the production starred Emrys James as York and Graham Crowden as Gloucester.
Under the direction of Michael Boyd the play was presented at the Swan Theatre in Stratford in 2000, with David Oyelowo as Henry, Fiona Bell as Margaret, Clive Wood as York, and Richard Cordery as Gloucester. The play was presented with the five other history plays (&quot;Richard II&quot;, &quot;1 Henry IV&quot;, &quot;2 Henry IV&quot;, &quot;Henry V&quot; and &quot;Richard III&quot;) to form a complete eight-part history cycle under the general title &quot;This England: The Histories&quot; (the first time the RSC had ever attempted to stage the eight plays as one sequence). &quot;This England: The Histories&quot; was revived in 2006, as part of the &quot;Complete Works&quot; festival at the Courtyard Theatre, with the &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays again directed by Boyd, and starring Chuk Iwuji as Henry, Katy Stephens as Margaret, Jonathan Slinger as York and, reprising his role from 2000, Richard Cordery as Gloucester. When the &quot;Complete Works&quot; wrapped in March 2007, the history plays remained on stage, under the shorter title &quot;The Histories&quot;, as part of a two-year thirty-four actor ensemble production. &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; was performed under the title &quot;Henry VI, Part 2: England&#x27;s Fall&quot;. At the end of the two-year programme, the entire octology was performed over a four-day period under the title &quot;The Glorious Moment&quot;; &quot;Richard II&quot; was staged on a Thursday evening, followed by the two &quot;Henry IV&quot; plays on Friday afternoon and evening, the three &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays on Saturday (two afternoon performances and one evening performance), and &quot;Richard III&quot; on Sunday evening.

Boyd&#x27;s production garnered much attention at the time because of his interpolations and additions to the text. Most notably, Boyd introduced a new character into the trilogy. Called The Keeper, the character never speaks, but upon the death of each major character, the Keeper (played by Edward Clayton in 2000, and by Anthony Bunsee in 2006/2007), wearing all red, would walk onto stage and approach the body. The actor playing the body would then stand up and allow himself to be led off-stage by the figure. Another alteration was that the &#x27;Lieutenant&#x27; who orders Suffolk&#x27;s death in 4.1 was in fact the ghost of Lord Talbot (played by Keith Bartlett), who had been killed in &quot;1 Henry VI&quot;. Additionally, during Jack Cade&#x27;s rebellion, the ghosts of Gloucester, Winchester and Suffolk all appear as rebels, and in a much lauded piece of double casting, Clayton and Bunsee also played Dick the Butcher in their respective performances. The production was also particularly noted for its realistic violence. According to Robert Gore-Langton of the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, in his review of the original 2000 production, &quot;blood from a severed arm sprayed over my lap. A human liver slopped to the floor by my feet. An eyeball scudded past, then a tongue.&quot;

In 2012, the trilogy was staged at Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe as part of the Globe to Globe Festival, with each play performed by a different Balkans based company and offered as a commentary on the recent history of violence in that region. &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; was staged by the National Theater of Albania, directed by Adonis Filipi, and starring Indrit Çobani as Henry, Ermina Hysaj as Margaret, Vasjan Lami as York and Kristaq Skrami as Gloucester. In 2013, Nick Bagnall directed another production of the trilogy at the Globe. All three plays were performed each day, beginning at midday, under the overall title &quot;Henry VI: Three Plays&quot;. &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; was performed under the title &quot;Henry VI: The Houses of York and Lancaster&quot;. Each of the plays was edited down to two hours, and the entire trilogy was performed with a cast of fourteen actors. On several specific dates, the plays were performed at the actual locations where some of the original events took place and streamed live to the theatre; &quot;battlefield productions&quot; were staged at Towton (Battle of Towton from &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;), Tewkesbury (Battle of Tewkesbury from &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;), St Albans Cathedral (First Battle of St Albans from &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; and Second Battle of St Albans from &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;), and Monken Hadley Common (Battle of Barnet from &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;). The production starred Graham Butler as Henry, Mary Doherty as Margaret, Brendan O&#x27;Hea as York and Garry Cooper as Gloucester.

The first major American performance was in 1935 at the Pasadena Playhouse in California, directed by Gilmore Brown, as part of a production of all ten Shakespearean histories (the two tetralogies, preceded by &quot;King John&quot; and succeeded by &quot;Henry VIII&quot;).

In Europe, unedited stagings of the play took place at the Weimar Court Theatre in 1857. Directed by Franz von Dingelstedt, it was performed as the sixth part of the octology, with all eight plays staged over a ten-day period. A major production was staged at the Burgtheater in Vienna in 1873, with a celebrated performance from Friedrich Mitterwurzer as Winchester. Jocza Savits directed a production of the tetralogy at the Munich Court Theatre in 1889 and again in 1906. In 1927, Saladin Schmitt presented the unedited octology at the Municipal Theatre in Bochum. Denis Llorca staged the tetralogy as one twelve-hour piece in Carcassonne in 1978 and in Créteil in 1979. In 1999, director Ruediger Burbach presented &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; and &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; at the Zurich Playhouse. This production was unique insofar as a woman (Katharina Schmoelzer) played Henry. Margaret was played by Katharina von Bock.

== Adaptations ==

=== Theatrical ===

Evidence for the first adaptation of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; is found during the Restoration, when, in 1681, John Crowne created a two-part play entitled &quot;Henry the Sixth, The First Part&quot; and &quot;The Misery of Civil War&quot;. &quot;Henry&quot; comprised Acts 1–3 of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; focusing on the death of Gloucester, &quot;Misery&quot; adapted the last two acts of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; and much of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;. Writing at the time of Popish Plot, Crowne, who was a devout royalist, used his adaptation to warn about the danger of allowing England to descend into another civil war, which would be the case should the Whig party rise to power. As such, the scenes of Jack Cade&#x27;s rebellion, as depicted in &quot;Misery&quot;, were much more violent than in Shakespeare, with painted backdrops of people on fire and children impaled on pikes. Crowne also rewrote the roles of Gloucester and Winchester to make Gloucester more saint-like and taintless, and Winchester even more villainous. He also linked the murder of Gloucester to the recent assassination of Edmund Berry Godfrey, an incident which had led to an outbreak of anti-Catholic hysteria in London in 1678. By creating this link, Crowne was aiming to enhance anti-Catholic sentiment even more and ensure the passing of the Exclusion Bill, which would prevent the Catholic James Stuart, Duke of York succeeding his brother, the Protestant Charles II. To this end, Crowne rewrote the murder scene to give more characterisation to the three murderers, who were depicted as devout, but cold-blooded Catholics.

Two more adaptations followed in 1723. The first was &quot;Humfrey Duke of Gloucester&quot; by Ambrose Philips, which used about thirty lines from Acts 1–3 of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; and was performed at Drury Lane. In a possible comment on the politics of Crowne&#x27;s adaptation, Phillips dedicated his version to William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath, a leading Whig politician. The second 1723 adaptation, also performed at Drury Lane, was Theophilus Cibber&#x27;s &quot;King Henry VI: A Tragedy&quot;, which used Act 5 of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; and Acts 1 and 2 of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, and which featured his father Colley Cibber as Winchester.

In 1817, Edmund Kean appeared in J.H. Merivale&#x27;s &quot;Richard Duke of York; or the Contention of York and Lancaster&quot;, which used material from all three &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays, but removed everything not directly related to York. Material from &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; included the lamentation about the loss of Anjou and Maine, the conflict between Gloucester and Winchester, the murder of Gloucester, the death of Winchester (where all Warwick&#x27;s dialogue is reassigned to York), and Cade&#x27;s rebellion.

Following Merivale&#x27;s example, Robert Atkins adapted all three plays into a single piece for a performance at The Old Vic in 1923 as part of the celebrations for the tercentenary of the &quot;First Folio&quot;. Guy Martineau played Henry and Esther Whitehouse played Margaret. Atkins himself played York.

The success of the 1951–1953 Douglas Seale stand-alone productions of each of the individual plays in Birmingham prompted him to present the three plays together at the Old Vic in 1957 under the general title &quot;The Wars of the Roses&quot;. Barry Jackson adapted the text, altering the trilogy into a two-part play; &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; and &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; were combined (with almost all of &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; eliminated) and &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; was edited down. Seale again directed, with Paul Daneman again appearing as Henry and Alfred Burke as Gloucester, alongside Barbara Jefford as Margaret and Derek Godfrey as York.

The production which is usually credited with establishing the reputation of the play in the modern theatre is John Barton and Peter Hall&#x27;s 1963/1964 RSC production of the tetralogy, adapted into a three-part series, under the general title &quot;The Wars of the Roses&quot;, at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre. The first play (entitled simply &quot;Henry VI&quot;) featured a much shortened version of &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; and half of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; (up to the death of Beaufort). The second play (entitled &quot;Edward IV&quot;) featured the second half of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; and a shortened version of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, which was then followed by a shortened version of &quot;Richard III&quot; as the third play. In all, 1,450 lines written by Barton were added to 6,000 lines of original Shakespearean material, with a total of 12,350 lines removed. The production starred David Warner as Henry, Peggy Ashcroft as Margaret, Donald Sinden as York and Paul Hardwick as Gloucester. Barton and Hall were both especially concerned that the plays reflect the contemporary political environment, with the civil chaos and breakdown of society depicted in the plays mirrored in the contemporary &quot;milieu&quot;, by events such as the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961, the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 and the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963. The directors allowed these events to reflect themselves in the production, arguing that &quot;we live among war, race riots, revolutions, assassinations, and the imminent threat of extinction. The theatre is, therefore, examining fundamentals in staging the &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays.&quot; They were also influenced by politically focused literary theory of the time; both had attended the 1956 London visit of Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s Berliner Ensemble, both were subscribers to Antonin Artaud&#x27;s theory of &quot;Theatre of Cruelty&quot;, and Hall had read an English translation of Jan Kott&#x27;s influential &quot;Shakespeare Our Contemporary&quot; in 1964 prior to its publication in Britain. Both Barton and Hall were also supporters of E.M.W. Tillyard&#x27;s 1944 book &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s History Plays&quot;, which was still a hugely influential text in Shakespearian scholarship, especially in terms of its argument that Shakespeare in the tetraology was advancing the Tudor myth.

Another major adaptation was staged in 1987 by the English Shakespeare Company, under the direction of Michael Bogdanov. This touring production opened at the Old Vic, and subsequently toured for two years, performing at, amongst other places, the Panasonic Globe Theatre in Tokyo, Japan (as the inaugural play of the arena), the Festival dei Due Mondi in Spoleto, Italy and at the Adelaide Festival in Adelaide, Australia. Following the structure established by Barton and Hall, Bogdanov combined a heavily edited &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; and the first half of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; into one play (&quot;Henry VI&quot;), and the second half of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; and &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; into another (&quot;Edward IV&quot;), and followed them with an edited &quot;Richard III&quot;. Also like Barton and Hall, Bogdanov concentrated on political issues, although he made them far more overt than had his predecessors. For example, played by June Watson, Margaret was closely modelled after the British Prime Minister at the time, Margaret Thatcher, even to the point of having similar clothes and hair. Likewise, Paul Brennan&#x27;s Henry was closely modelled after King Edward VIII, before his abdication. Jack Cade, played by Michael Pennington was presented as a punk with spiked hair and wearing a shirt depicting a Union Jack with a white rose in the middle, and during the Cade rebellion, football hooligan chants were heard. Indeed, the Cade rebellion in general was modelled on the National Front. Bogdanov also employed frequent anachronisms and contemporary visual registers, in an effort to show the relevance of the politics to the contemporary period. The production was noted for its pessimism as regards contemporary British politics, with some critics feeling the political resonances were too heavy handed. However, the series was a huge box office success. Alongside Watson and Brennen, the play starred Barry Stanton as York and Colin Farrell as Gloucester.

Another adaptation of the tetralogy by the Royal Shakespeare Company followed in 1988, performed at the Barbican. Adapted by Charles Wood and directed by Adrian Noble, the Barton/Hall structure was again followed, reducing the trilogy to two plays by dividing &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; in the middle. The resulting trilogy was entitled &quot;The Plantagenets&quot;, with the individual plays entitled &quot;Henry VI&quot;, &quot;The Rise of Edward IV&quot; and &quot;Richard III, His Death&quot;. Starring Ralph Fiennes as Henry, Penny Downie as Margaret, Anton Lesser as York and David Waller as Gloucester, the production was extremely successful with both audiences and critics.

Michael Bogdanov and the English Shakespeare Company presented a different adaptation at the Swansea Grand Theatre in 1991, using the same cast as on the touring production. All eight plays from the history cycle were presented over a seven night period, with each play receiving one performance only, and with only twenty eight actors portraying the nearly five hundred roles. Whilst the other five plays in the cycle were unadapted, the &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays were combined into two, using the Barton/Hall structure, with the first named &quot;The House of Lancaster&quot; and the second, &quot;The House of York&quot;.

In 2000, Edward Hall presented the trilogy as a two-part series at the Watermill Theatre in Newbury. Hall followed the Jackson/Seale structure, combining &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; and &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; into one play which all but eliminated &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; and following this with an edited version of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;. This production was noted for how it handled the violence of the play. The set was designed to look like an abattoir, but rather than attempt to present the violence realistically (as most productions do), Hall went in the other direction; presenting the violence symbolically. Whenever a character was decapitated or killed, a red cabbage was sliced up whilst the actor mimed the death beside it.

In 2001, Tom Markus directed an adaptation of the tetralogy at the Colorado Shakespeare Festival. Condensing all fours plays into one, Markus named the play &quot;Queen Margaret&quot;, doing much the same with the character of Margaret as Merivale had done with York. Margaret was played by Gloria Biegler, Henry by Richard Haratine, York by Lars Tatom and Gloucester by Charles Wilcox.
Another unusual 2001 adaptation of the tetralogy was entitled &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Rugby Wars&quot;. Written by Matt Toner and Chris Coculuzzi, and directed by Coculuzzi, the play was acted by the Upstart Crow Theatre Group and staged outdoors at the Robert Street Playing Field as part of the Toronto Fringe Festival. Presented as if it were a live rugby match between York and Lancaster, the &#x27;play&#x27; featured commentary from Falstaff (Stephen Flett), which was broadcast live for the audience. The &#x27;match&#x27; itself was refereed by &#x27;Bill Shakespeare&#x27; (played by Coculuzzi), and the actors (whose characters names all appeared on their jerseys) had microphones attached and would recite dialogue from all four plays at key moments.

In 2002, Leon Rubin presented the tetralogy as a trilogy at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Ontario. Using the Barton/Hall method of combining &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; with the first half of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;, and the second half of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; with &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, the plays were renamed &quot;Henry VI: Revenge in France&quot; and &quot;Henry VI: Revolt in England&quot;. Michael Thierry played Henry, Seana McKenna played Margaret, Thom Marriott played York and David Francis played Gloucester.

Also in 2002, Edward Hall and the Propeller Company presented a one-play all-male cast modern dress adaptation of the trilogy at the Watermill Theatre. Under the title &quot;Rose Rage&quot;, Hall used a cast of only thirteen actors to portray the nearly one hundred and fifty speaking roles in the four-hour production, thus necessitating doubling and tripling of parts. Although a new adaptation, this production followed the Jackson/Seale method of eliminating almost all of &quot;1 Henry VI&quot;. The original cast included Jonathan McGuinness as Henry, Robert Hands as Margaret, Guy Williams as York and Richard Clothier as Gloucester. After a successful run at the Watermill, the play moved to the Chicago Shakespeare Theater. The American cast included Carman Lacivita as Henry, Scott Parkinson as Margaret, Bruce A. Young as York and Sean Fortunato as Gloucester.

Outside England, a major European adaptation of the tetralogy took place in 1864 in Weimar under the direction of Franz von Dingelstedt, who, seven years previously had staged the play unedited. Dingelstedt turned the trilogy into a two-parter under the general name &quot;Die weisse rose&quot;. The first play was called &quot;Haus Lancaster&quot;, the second &quot;Haus York&quot;. This adaptation was unique insofar as both plays were created by combining material from all three &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays. Following this structure, Alfred von Walzogen also produced a two-part play in 1875, under the general title &quot;Edward IV&quot;. Another European adaptation was in 1965 at the Piccolo Teatro in Milan. Directed by Giorgio Strehler it went under the title &quot;Il gioco del potenti&quot; (&quot;The Play of the Mighty&quot;). Using Barton and Hall&#x27;s structure, Strehler also added several characters, including a Chorus, who used monologues from &quot;Richard II&quot;, both parts of &quot;Henry IV&quot;, &quot;Henry V&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot; and &quot;Timon of Athens&quot;, and two gravediggers called Bevis and Holland (after the names of two of Cade&#x27;s rebels in the Folio text), who commented (with dialogue written by Strehler himself) on each of the major characters as they set about burying them. A major German adaptation was Peter Palitzsch&#x27;s two-part adaptation of the trilogy as &quot;Rosenkriege&quot; in 1967 at the Stuttgart State Theatre. Condensing the three plays into two, &quot;Heinrich VI&quot; and &quot;Eduard IV&quot;, Palitzsch&#x27;s adaptation concluded with the opening monologue from &quot;Richard III&quot;.

=== Television ===
The first television adaptation of the play was in 1960 when the BBC produced a serial entitled &quot;An Age of Kings&quot;. The show comprised fifteen sixty- and seventy-five-minute episodes which adapted all eight of Shakespeare&#x27;s sequential history plays. Directed by Michael Hayes and produced by Peter Dews, with a script by Eric Crozier, the production featured Terry Scully as Henry, Mary Morris as Margaret, Jack May as York and John Ringham as Gloucester. The tenth episode, &quot;The Fall of a Protector&quot; covers Acts 1, 2 and Act 3, Scene 1, ending with York&#x27;s soliloquy regarding the fact that he now has troops at his disposal and his revelation of his plans to use Jack Cade to instigate a popular rebellion. The eleventh episode, &quot;The Rabble from Kent&quot;, presents everything from Act 3, Scene 2 onwards, beginning with the death of Humphrey. With each episode running one hour, a great deal of text was necessarily removed, but aside from truncation, only minor alterations were made to the original. For example, in &quot;The Fall of a Protector&quot;, Peter Thump does not kill Thomas Horner during the combat; he compels him to confess by sitting on him, and Horner is promptly arrested. In &quot;The Rabble from Kent&quot;, we see the murder of Gloucester, whereas in the text, it happens off-stage. Also worth noting is that the characters of both George Plantagenet and Edmund, Earl of Rutland are introduced just prior to the Battle of St Albans, whereas in the text, neither character is introduced until &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; (Edmund in Act 1, Scene 3; George in Act 2, Scene 2). Additionally, Edmund is played by an adult actor, whereas in the text, he is a child.

In 1965, BBC 1 broadcast all three plays from John Barton and Peter Hall&#x27;s &quot;The Wars of the Roses&quot; trilogy (&quot;Henry VI&quot;, &quot;The Rise of Edward IV&quot; and &quot;Richard III&quot;) with David Warner as Henry and Peggy Ashcroft as Margaret. Directed for television by Robin Midgley and Michael Hayes, the plays were presented as more than simply filmed theatre, with the core idea being &quot;to recreate theatre production in televisual terms – not merely to observe it, but to get to the heart of it.&quot; Filming was done on the RSC stage, but not during actual performances, thus allowing cameras to get close to the actors, and cameramen with hand-held cameras to shoot battle scenes. Additionally, camera platforms were created around the theatre. In all, twelve cameras were used, allowing the final product to be edited more like a film than a piece of static filmed theatre. Filming was done following the 1964 run of the plays at Stratford-upon-Avon, and took place over an eight-week period, with fifty-two BBC staff working alongside eighty-four RSC staff to bring the project to fruition. In 1966, the production was repeated on BBC 1 where it was re-edited into eleven episodes of fifty minutes each. The second episode, &quot;Margaret of Anjou&quot;, presented &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; from Act 4, Scene 2 onwards, beginning with Talbot confronting the French general at Harfleur (Bordeaux in the play), as well as the first half of Act 1, Scene 1 of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; (concluding with Henry and Margaret departing from the court). The third episode, &quot;The Lord Protector&quot; covered Acts 1, 2 and Act 3, Scene 1 of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;, ending with York&#x27;s soliloquy regarding the fact that he now has troops at his disposal and his revelation of his plans to use Jack Cade to instigate a popular rebellion. The fourth episode, &quot;The Council Board&quot;, presented Act 3, Scene 2 up to Act 4, Scene 8, concluding with Jack Cade&#x27;s forces abandoning him. The fifth episode, &quot;The Fearful King&quot;, presented the rest of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; (beginning with Henry pardoning Cade&#x27;s rebels) as well as &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; Act 1 and Act 2, Scene 1, concluding with Warwick rallying Edward, Richard and George after their father&#x27;s death.

Another television version of the play was produced by the BBC in 1981 for their &quot;BBC Television Shakespeare&quot; series, although the episode did not air until 1983. Directed by Jane Howell, the play was presented as the second part of the tetralogy (all four adaptations directed by Howell) with linked casting; Henry was played by Peter Benson, Margaret by Julia Foster, York by Bernard Hill and Gloucester by David Burke. Howell&#x27;s presentation of the complete first historical tetralogy was one of the most lauded achievements of the entire BBC series, and prompted Stanley Wells to argue that the productions were &quot;probably purer than any version given in the theatre since Shakespeare&#x27;s time.&quot; Michael Mannheim was similarly impressed, calling the tetralogy &quot;a fascinating, fast-paced and surprisingly tight-knit study in political and national deterioration.&quot;
Inspired by the notion that the political intrigues behind the Wars of the Roses often seemed like playground squabbles, Howell and production designer Oliver Bayldon staged the four plays in a single set resembling a children&#x27;s adventure playground. However, little attempt was made at realism. For example, Bayldon did not disguise the parquet flooring (&quot;it stops the set from literally representing [...] it reminds us we are in a modern television studio&quot;), and in all four productions, the title of the play is displayed within the set itself (on banners in &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; and &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; (where it is visible throughout the entire first scene), on a shroud in &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, and written on a chalkboard by Richard himself in &quot;Richard III&quot;). Many critics felt these set design choices lent the production an air of Brechtian . Stanley Wells wrote of the set that it was intended to invite the viewer to &quot;accept the play&#x27;s artificiality of language and action,&quot; Michael Hattaway describes it as &quot;anti-illusionist,&quot; Susan Willis argues that the set allows the productions &quot;to reach theatrically toward the modern world&quot; and Ronald Knowles writes &quot;a major aspect of the set was the subliminal suggestion of childlike anarchy, role-playing, rivalry, game and vandalism, as if all culture were precariously balanced on the shaky foundations of atavistic aggression and power-mad possession.&quot; As the four plays progressed, the set decayed and became more and more dilapidated as social order became more fractious. In the same vein, the costumes became more and more monotone as the plays went on – &quot;The First Part of Henry the Sixt&quot; features brightly coloured costumes which clearly distinguish the various combatants from one another, but by &quot;The Tragedy of Richard III&quot;, everyone fights in similarly coloured dark costumes, with little to differentiate one army from another.

Another element of in this production is the use of doubling, particularly the use of the actors David Burke and Trevor Peacock. Burke plays Henry&#x27;s closest advisor and most loyal servant, Gloucester, and after Gloucester&#x27;s death, he plays Jack Cade&#x27;s right-hand man, Dick the Butcher. Peacock plays Cade himself, having previously appeared in &quot;The First Part of Henry the Sixt&quot; as Lord Talbot, representative of chivalry. Both actors play complete inversions of their previous characters, re-creating both an authentically Elizabethan theatrical practice and a Breachtian political commentary. Graham Holderness saw Howell&#x27;s non-naturalistic production as something of a reaction to the BBC&#x27;s adaptation of the &quot;Henriad&quot; in seasons one and two, which had been directed by David Giles in the traditional and straightforward manner favoured by then series producer Cedric Messina; &quot;where Messina saw the history plays conventionally as orthodox Tudor historiography, and [David Giles] employed dramatic techniques which allow that ideology a free and unhampered passage to the spectator, Jane Howell takes a more complex view of the first tetralogy as, simultaneously, a serious attempt at historical interpretation, and as a drama with a peculiarly modern relevance and contemporary application. The plays, to this director, are not a dramatisation of the Elizabethan World Picture but a sustained interrogation of residual and emergent ideologies in a changing society [...] This awareness of the multiplicity of potential meanings in the play required a decisive and scrupulous avoidance of television or theatrical naturalism: methods of production should operate to open the plays out, rather than close them into the immediately recognisable familiarity of conventional Shakespearean production.&quot;

Howell&#x27;s &quot;The Second Part of Henry the Sixt&quot; was based on the folio text rather than the quarto; however, it departed from that text in a number of places. For example, numerous lines were cut from almost every scene. Some of the more notable omissions include: in Act 1, Scene 1, both of Gloucester&#x27;s references to Bedford are absent (ll. 82–83, 95–96), as is the reference to Suffolk&#x27;s demands that he be paid for escorting Margaret from France (ll. 131–133), and York&#x27;s allusion to Althaea and Calydon in his closing soliloquy (ll.231–235). Absent in Act 2, Scene 1 is Gloucester&#x27;s question to Winchester &quot;Is your priesthood grown peremptory? &quot;Tantaene animis caelestibus irae&quot;?&quot; (ll.23–24), as are lines 173–180, where Winchester taunts Gloucester about Eleanor&#x27;s arrest and Gloucester calls off their duel. York&#x27;s outline of Edward III&#x27;s seven sons is absent from Act 2, Scene 2 (ll.10–17), as is Salisbury&#x27;s reference to Owen Glendower (l.41). Suffolk&#x27;s accusation that Gloucester was involved in necromancy with Eleanor is omitted from Act 3, Scene 1 (ll.47–53), as is Gloucester&#x27;s outline of how he dealt with criminals during his time as Protector (ll.128–132). Also absent from 3.1 are the comments by Winchester, Suffolk and Margaret after Gloucester accuses them of conspiring to bring him down (ll.172–185), and York&#x27;s references to how he fought alongside Cade in Ireland (ll.360–370). In Act 4, Scene 1, all references to Walter Whitmore&#x27;s name as Gualtier are absent (ll.38–39). The entirety of Act 4, Scene 5 (a brief scene showing Scales and Gough on patrol at the Tower of London) is absent. In Act 5, Scene 1, some of the dialogue between Clifford and Warwick is absent (ll.200–210).

However, there were also some additions to the text, most noticeably some lines from &quot;The Contention&quot;, such as in Act 1, Scene 1, where two lines are added to Salisbury&#x27;s vow to support York if he can prove he is a legitimate heir to the crown. Between lines 197 and 198 is added &quot;The reverence of mine age and the Neville&#x27;s name/Is of no little force if I command.&quot; In Act 1, Scene 3, two lines are added to the conversation between Margaret and Thump between lines 31 and 32, where Thump mistakes the word &#x27;usurper&#x27; for &#x27;usurer&quot; and is corrected by Margaret. Another example is found in Act 2, Scene 1, where the extended conversation between Gloucester and Winchester in which Gloucester says Winchester was born &quot;in bastardy&quot; is included. Other changes include the transferral of lines to characters other than those who speak them in the Folio text. The most notable of these is 1.3.211 where Gloucester&#x27;s line &quot;This is the law, and this Duke Gloucester&#x27;s doom&quot; is given to Henry. Additionally, in Act 1, Scene 4, during the conjuration, there is no separate spirit in the scene; all the spirit&#x27;s dialogue is spoken &#x27;through&#x27; Jourdayne, and her lines from the Folio are omitted. Also, later in the scene, it is Buckingham who reads the prophecies, not York. In Act 4, Scene 1, the second half of line 139 (&quot;Pompey the Great, and Suffolk dies by pirates&quot;) is spoken by the Lieutenant, not Suffolk.

Another notable stylistic technique is that the soliloquies of York in Act 1, Scene 1 and Act 3, Scene 1, as well as those of Eleanor and Hum in Act 1, Scene 2, and York&#x27;s asides in Act 1, Scene 1 and Act 3, Scene 1 are all delivered direct to camera, as is the Dick the Butcher&#x27;s comments in Act 4, Scene 2, as Cade delivers his speech to the masses. Also worth noting is that the character of George Plantagenet is introduced just prior to the Battle of St Albans, whereas in the text, he is not introduced until &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, Act 2, Scene 2. Additionally, Buckingham is killed onscreen whereas in the play, his fate is unknown, only revealed in the opening lines of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; to have been killed by Edward.

In 1964, Austrian channel ORF 2 presented an adaptation of the trilogy by Leopold Lindtberg under the title &quot;Heinrich VI&quot;. The cast list from this production has been lost. In 1969, German channel ZDF presented a filmed version of the first part of Peter Palitzsch&#x27;s 1967 two-part adaptation of the trilogy in Stuttgart, &quot;Heinrich VI: Der Krieg der Rosen 1&quot;. The second part, &quot;Eduard IV: Der Krieg der Rosen 2&quot;, was screened in 1971.

=== Radio ===
In 1923, extracts from all three &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays were broadcast on BBC Radio, performed by the Cardiff Station Repertory Company as the third episode of a series of programs showcasing Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, entitled &quot;Shakespeare Night&quot;. In 1947, BBC Third Programme aired a one-hundred-and-fifty-minute adaptation of the trilogy as part of their &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Historical Plays&quot; series, a six-part adaptation of the eight sequential history plays, with linked casting. Adapted by Maurice Roy Ridley, &quot;King Henry VI&quot; starred John Bryon as Henry, Gladys Young as Margaret, Richard Williams as York and Baliol Holloway as Gloucester. In 1952, Third Programme aired an adaptation of the tetralogy by Peter Watts and John Dover Wilson under the general name &quot;The Wars of the Roses&quot;. The tetralogy was adapted into a trilogy but in an unusual way. &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; was simply removed, so the trilogy contained only &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;, &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; and &quot;Richard III&quot;. The reason for this was explained by Dover Wilson, who argued that &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; is &quot;patchwork in which Shakespeare collaborated with inferior dramatists.&quot; The adaptation starred Valentine Dyall as Henry, Sonia Dresdel as Margaret, Stephen Jack as York and Gordon McLeod as Gloucester. In 1971, BBC Radio 3 presented a two-part adaptation of the trilogy by Raymond Raikes. Part 1 contained an abridged &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; and an abridged version of the first three acts of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;. Part 2 presented Acts 4 and 5 and an abridged &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;. Nigel Lambert played Henry, Barbara Jefford played Margaret and Ian McKellen played both York and Richard III. In 1977, BBC Radio 4 presented a 26-part serialisation of the eight sequential history plays under the general title &quot;Vivat Rex&quot; (&quot;Long live the King&quot;). Adapted by Martin Jenkins as part of the celebration of the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II, &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; comprised episodes 17 (&quot;Witchcraft&quot;) and 18 (&quot;Jack Cade&quot;). James Laurenson played Henry, Peggy Ashcroft played Margaret, Peter Jeffrey played York and Richard Burton narrated.

In America, in 1936, a heavily edited adaptation of the trilogy was broadcast as part of NBC Blue&#x27;s &quot;Radio Guild&quot; series. Comprising three sixty-minute episodes aired a week apart, the adaptation was written by Vernon Radcliffe and starred Henry Herbert as Henry, and Janet Nolan as Margaret. In 1954, CBC Radio presented an adaptation of the trilogy by Andrew Allen, who combined &quot;1 Henry VI&quot;, &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; and &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; into a one-hundred-and-sixty-minute episode. There is no known cast information for this production.

In 1985, German radio channel Sender Freies Berlin broadcast a heavily edited seventy-six-minute two-part adaptation of the octology adapted by Rolf Schneider, under the title &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Rosenkriege&quot;.

===Manga===
Aya Kanno&#x27;s Japanese manga comic &quot;Requiem of the Rose King&quot; is a loose adaptation of the first Shakespearean historical tetralogy, covering &quot;Henry VI&quot; and &quot;Richard III&quot;.

<doc id="184847" wikidata="Q1241754" url="?curid=184847" title="Henry VI, Part 3">
<text>Henry VI, Part 3 (often written as 3 Henry VI) is a history play by William Shakespeare believed to have been written in 1591 and set during the lifetime of King Henry VI of England. Whereas &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; deals with the loss of England&#x27;s French territories and the political machinations leading up to the Wars of the Roses and &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; focuses on the King&#x27;s inability to quell the bickering of his nobles, and the inevitability of armed conflict, &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; deals primarily with the horrors of that conflict, with the once stable nation thrown into chaos and barbarism as families break down and moral codes are subverted in the pursuit of revenge and power.

Although the &quot;Henry VI&quot; trilogy may not have been written in chronological order, the three plays are often grouped together with &quot;Richard III&quot; to form a tetralogy covering the entire Wars of the Roses saga, from the death of Henry V in 1422 to the rise to power of Henry VII in 1485. It was the success of this sequence of plays that firmly established Shakespeare&#x27;s reputation as a playwright.

&quot;Henry VI, Part 3&quot; features one of the longest soliloquies in all of Shakespeare (3.2.124–195) and has more battle scenes (four on stage, one reported) than any other of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays.

==Synopsis==
The play begins where &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; left off, with the victorious Yorkists (Duke of York, Edward, Richard, Warwick, Montague [i.e. Salisbury] and Norfolk) pursuing Henry and Margaret from the battlefield in the wake of the First Battle of St Albans (1455). Upon reaching the parliamentary chambers in London, York seats himself in the throne, and a confrontation ensues between his supporters and Henry&#x27;s. Threatened with violence by Warwick, who has brought part of his army with him, the King reaches an agreement with York which will allow him to remain king until his death, at which time the throne will permanently pass to the House of York and its descendants. Disgusted with this decision, which would disinherit the King&#x27;s son, Prince Edward, the King&#x27;s supporters, led by his wife, Margaret, abandon him, and Margaret declares war on the Yorkists, supported by Clifford, who is determined to exact revenge for the death of his father at the hands of York during the battle of St Albans.

Margaret attacks York&#x27;s castle at Wakefield, and the Yorkists lose the ensuing battle (1460). During the conflict, Clifford murders York&#x27;s twelve-year-old son, Rutland. Margaret and Clifford then capture and taunt York himself; forcing him to stand on a molehill, they give him a handkerchief covered with Rutland&#x27;s blood to wipe his brow, and place a paper crown on his head, before stabbing him to death. After the battle, as Edward and Richard lament York&#x27;s death, Warwick brings news that his own army has been defeated by Margaret&#x27;s at the Second Battle of St Albans (1461), and the King has returned to London, where, under pressure from Margaret, he has revoked his agreement with York. However, George Plantagenet, Richard and Edward&#x27;s brother, has vowed to join their cause, having been encouraged to do so by his sister, the Duchess of Burgundy. Additionally, Warwick has been joined in the conflict by his own younger brother, Montague.

The Yorkists regroup, and at the Battle of Towton (1461), Clifford is killed and the Yorkists are victorious. During the battle, Henry sits on a molehill and laments his problems. He observes a father who has killed his son, and a son who has killed his father, representing the horrors of the civil war. Following his victory, Edward is proclaimed king and the House of York is established on the English throne. George is proclaimed Duke of Clarence and Richard, Duke of Gloucester, although he complains to Edward that this is an ominous dukedom. King Edward and George then leave the court, and Richard reveals to the audience his ambition to rise to power and take the throne from his brother, although as yet he is unsure how to go about it.

After Towton, Warwick goes to France to secure for Edward the hand of Louis XI&#x27;s sister-in-law, Lady Bona, thus ensuring peace between the two nations by uniting in marriage their two monarchies. Warwick arrives at the French court to find that Margaret, Prince Edward and the Earl of Oxford have come to Louis to seek his aid in the conflict in England. Just as Louis is about to agree to supply Margaret with troops, Warwick intervenes, and convinces Louis that it is in his interests to support Edward and approve the marriage. Back in England, however, the recently widowed Lady Grey (Elizabeth Woodville) has come to King Edward requesting her late husband&#x27;s lands be returned to her. Edward is captivated by her beauty and promises to return her husband&#x27;s lands to her if she becomes his mistress, but Lady Grey refuses. The two exchange sexually-charged banter, but Lady Grey continues to refuse Edward on the grounds of preserving her honor. Edward declares that, besides being beautiful, she is also clever and virtuous, and decides to marry her against the advice of both George and Richard. Upon hearing of this, Warwick, feeling he has been made to look a fool despite service to the House of York, denounces Edward, and switches allegiance to the Lancastrians, promising his daughter Anne&#x27;s hand in marriage to Prince Edward as a sign of his loyalty. Shortly thereafter, George and Montague also defect to the Lancastrians. Warwick then invades England with French troops, and Edward is taken prisoner and conveyed to Warwick&#x27;s brother, the Archbishop of York, while heavily pregnant Lady Grey (now Queen Elizabeth) flees to sanctuary.

However, Edward is soon rescued by Richard, Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley. Henry, having been restored to the throne, appoints Warwick and George as his Lords Protector. News of the escape reaches Henry&#x27;s court, and the young Earl of Richmond is sent into exile in Brittany for safety. Richmond is a descendant of John of Gaunt, uncle of Richard II and son of Edward III, and therefore a potential Lancastrian heir should anything happen to Henry and his son; hence the need to protect him.
Edward reorganises his forces and confronts Warwick&#x27;s army. Before the walls of Coventry, George betrays Warwick, and rejoins the Yorkists; this is lauded by Edward and Richard, and furiously condemned by the Lancastrians. The Yorkists achieve a decisive victory at the Battle of Barnet (1471), during which both Warwick and Montague are killed. Meanwhile, Edward&#x27;s forces have captured Henry and sent him to the Tower of London.

Oxford and the Duke of Somerset now assume command of the Lancastrian forces, and join a second battalion newly arrived from France led by Margaret and Prince Edward. In the subsequent Battle of Tewkesbury (1471), the Yorkists rout the Lancastrians, capturing Margaret, Prince Edward, Somerset and Oxford. Somerset is sentenced to death, Oxford to life imprisonment, Margaret is banished, and Prince Edward is stabbed to death by the three Plantagenet brothers, who fly into a rage after he refuses to recognise the House of York as the legitimate royal family. At this point, Richard goes to London to kill Henry. At Richard&#x27;s arrival at the Tower, the two argue, and in a rage Richard stabs Henry. With his dying breath, Henry prophesies Richard&#x27;s future villainy and the chaos that will engulf the country.

Back at court, Edward is reunited with his queen and meets his infant son, who was born in sanctuary. Edward orders celebrations to begin, believing the civil wars are finally over and lasting peace is at hand. He is unaware, however, of Richard&#x27;s scheming and his desire for power at any cost.

==Sources==
Shakespeare&#x27;s primary source for &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; was Edward Hall&#x27;s &quot;The Union of the Two Noble and Illustre Families of Lancaster and York&quot; (1548). As with most of his chronicle histories, Shakespeare also consulted Raphael Holinshed&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles of England, Scotland and Ireland&quot; (1577; 2nd edition 1587). Holinshed took much of his information on the Wars of the Roses from Hall, even to the point of reproducing large portions of text from Hall verbatim. However, there are sufficient differences between Hall and Holinshed to establish that Shakespeare consulted both.

For example, when Henry is urged by Clifford, Northumberland and Westmorland to engage the Yorkists in combat in the parliamentary chambers, he is reluctant, arguing that the Yorkists have greater support in London than the Lancastrians; &quot;Know you not the city favours them,/And they have troops of soldiers at their beck&quot; (1.1.67–68). Both Hall and Holinshed report that the Yorkists invaded the parliament house, but only Hall reports that Henry chose not to engage them because the majority of the people supported York&#x27;s claim to the throne. Rutland&#x27;s death scene (1.3) is also based on Hall rather than Holinshed. Although Clifford is reported as having murdered Rutland in both Hall and Holinshed, only in Hall is Rutland&#x27;s tutor present, and only in Hall do Rutland and Clifford engage in a debate about revenge prior to the murder. The depiction of Edward&#x27;s initial meeting with Lady Grey (3.2) is also based on Hall rather than Holinshed. For example, Hall is alone in reporting that Edward seemingly offered to make her his queen merely from motives of lust; Edward &quot;affirming farther that if she would thereunto condescend [to sleep with him], she might so fortune of his paramour and concubine to be changed to his wife and lawful bedfellow.&quot; Later, Holinshed does not mention any instance in which George and Richard express their dissatisfaction with Edward&#x27;s decision (depicted in the play in 4.1), or their questioning of Edward as to why he is favouring the relations of his wife over his own brothers. Such a scene occurs only in Hall, who writes that Clarence declared to Gloucester that, &quot;We would make him know that we were all three one man&#x27;s sons, of one mother and one lineage descended, which should be more preferred and promoted than strangers of his wife&#x27;s blood [...] He will exalt or promote his cousin or ally, which little careth for the fall or confusion of his own line and lineage.&quot; A more general aspect unique to Hall is the prominence of revenge as a motive for much of the cruelty in the play. Revenge is cited many times by different characters as a guiding force behind their actions; Northumberland, Westmorland, Clifford, Richard, Edward and Warwick all declare at some point in the play that they are acting out of a desire for vengeance on their enemies. Revenge, however, plays little part in Holinshed, who hardly mentions the word, and never offers it as a major theme of the war.

On the other hand, some aspects of the play are unique to Holinshed rather than Hall. For example, both Hall and Holinshed represent Margaret and Clifford taunting York after the Battle of Wakefield (depicted in 1.4), but Hall makes no mention of a crown or a molehill, both of which are alluded to in Holinshed (although in the chronicle, the crown is made of sedges, not paper); &quot;The duke was taken alive and in derision caused to stand upon a molehill, on whose head they put a garland instead of a crown, which they had fashioned and made of sedges or bulrushes.&quot; More evidence that Shakespeare used Holinshed is found in the scene is which Warwick is in France after joining the Lancastrians (3.3), and King Louis assigns his Admiral, Lord Bourbon, to aid Warwick in assembling an army. In Holinshed, the Admiral is referred to as &quot;Lord Bourbon&quot;, as he is in the play (and as he was in reality), whereas in Hall the Admiral is erroneously called &quot;Lord Burgundy&quot;. Another aspect of the play found only in Holinshed is Edward&#x27;s offer of peace to Warwick prior to the Battle of Barnet; &quot;Now Warwick, wilt thou ope the city gates,/Speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee?/Call Edward king, and at his hands beg mercy,/And he shall pardon thee these outrages&quot; (5.1.21–24). This offer from Edward is not reported in Hall, who makes no reference to a Yorkist attempt to parley with Warwick. This incident is found only in Holinshed.
Although Shakespeare&#x27;s main sources for factual material were Hall and Holinshed, he seems to have used other texts for thematic and structural purposes. One such source was almost certainly Sackville and Norton&#x27;s &quot;Gorboduc&quot; (1561), a play about a deposed king who divides his land between his children, and which Shakespeare also used as a source for &quot;King Lear&quot;. &quot;Gorboduc&quot; was reprinted in 1590, the year before Shakespeare wrote &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, and he seems to have used it as his &quot;model for exploring and representing the destruction of civil society by factional conflict.&quot; More specifically, &quot;Gorboduc&quot; is the only known pre-seventeenth century text containing a scene in which a son unknowingly kills his father, and a father unknowingly kills his son, and as such, almost certainly served as the source for Act 2, Scene 5, in which Henry witnesses just such an incident.

Another thematic source may have been William Baldwin&#x27;s &quot;The Mirror for Magistrates&quot; (1559; 2nd edition, 1578), a well-known series of poems spoken by controversial historical figures who speak of their lives and deaths, and to warn contemporary society not to make the same mistakes they did. Three such figures are Margaret of Anjou, King Edward IV and Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York. York&#x27;s final scene, and his last speech in particular (1.4.111–171), are often identified as being the &#x27;type&#x27; of scene suitable to a traditional tragic hero who has been defeated by his own ambition, and this is very much how York presents himself in &quot;Mirror&quot;, a tragic hero whose dynastic ambitions caused him to reach too far and led to his ruin.

Thomas Kyd&#x27;s &quot;The Spanish Tragedy&quot; (1582–1591) may also have served as a minor influence. Of specific importance is the handkerchief soaked in Rutland&#x27;s blood which Margaret produces during York&#x27;s torture in Act 1, Scene 4. This could have been influenced by the recurring image of a bloody handkerchief in the immensely popular &quot;Tragedy&quot;, insofar as a handkerchief soaked in the blood of his son, Horatio, is carried by the protagonist, Hieronimo, throughout the play.

A minor source which Shakespeare certainly used was Arthur Brooke&#x27;s &quot;The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet&quot; (1562), which was also Shakespeare&#x27;s source for &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. Much of Margaret&#x27;s speech to her army in Act 5, Scene 4 is taken almost verbatim from Brooke. In &quot;Romeus and Juliet&quot;, Friar Laurence advises Romeus to stand up to his troubles, and be brave in the face of great danger;

:
A wise man in the midst of troubles and distress
Still stands not wailing present harm, but seeks his harm&#x27;s redress.
As when the winter flaws with dreadful noise arise,
And heave the foamy swelling waves up to the starry skies,
So that the bruis&#x27;d barque in cruel seas betost,
Despaireth of the happy haven, in danger to be lost.
The pilot bold at helm, cries, &#x27;Mates, strike now your sail&#x27;,
And turns her stem into the waves that strongly her assail.
Then driven hard upon the bare and wreckful shore,
In greater danger to be wrecked than he had been before,
He seeth his ship full right against the rock to run,
But yet he doth what lieth in him the perilous rock to shun.
Sometimes the beaten boat, by cunning government –
The anchors lost, the cables broke, and all the tackle spent,
The rudder smitten off, and overboad the |mast –
Doth win the long desir&#x27;d port, the stormy danger past.
But if the master dread, and overpressed with woe,
Begin to wring his hands, and lets the guiding rudder go,
The ship rents on the rock or sinketh in the deep,
And eke the coward drench&#x27;d is: So, if thou still beweep
And seek not how to help the changes that do chance,
Thy cause of sorrow shall increase, thou cause of thy mischance.
(ll.1359–1380)
This is very similar to Margaret&#x27;s speech in &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;;
Great lords, wise men ne&#x27;er sit and wail their loss
But cheerly seek how to redress their harms.
What though the mast be now blown overboard,
The cable broke, the holding-anchor lost,
And half our sailors swallowed in the flood?
Yet lives our pilot still. Is&#x27;t meet that he
Should leave the helm and, like a fearful lad,
With tearful eyes add water to the sea,
And give more strength to that which hath too much,
Whiles in his moan the ship splits on the rock
Which industry and courage might have saved?
Ah what a shame, ah what a fault were this.
Say Warwick was our anchor, what of that?
And Montague our topmast, what of him?
Our slaughtered friends the tackles, what of these?
Why, is not Oxford here another anchor?
And Somerset another goodly mast?
The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings?
And, though unskilful, why not Ned and I
For once allowed the skilful pilot&#x27;s charge?
We will not from the helm to sit and weep,
But keep our course, though the rough wind say no,
From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wrack.
As good to chide the waves as speak them fair;
And what is Edward but a ruthless sea?
What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit?
And Richard but a ragged fatal rock –
All these the enemies to our poor barque?
Say you can swim; alas &#x27;tis but a while.
Tread on the sand; why, there you quickly sink;
Bestride the rock; the tide will wash you off
Or else you famish – that&#x27;s a threefold death.
This speak I, lords, to let you understand,
In case some one of you would fly from us,
That there&#x27;s no hoped-for mercy with the brothers
More than with ruthless waves, with sands and rocks.
Why, courage then, what cannot be avoided
&#x27;Twere childish weakness to lament or fear.
(5.4.1–38)
It has also been suggested that Shakespeare may have used several mystery cycles as sources. Randall Martin, in his 2001 edition of the play for &quot;The Oxford Shakespeare&quot; notes the similarities between York&#x27;s torture in Act 1, Scene 4 and the torture of Christ as depicted in &quot;The Buffeting and Scourging of Christ&quot;, &quot;Second Trial Before Pilate&quot; and &quot;Judgement of Jesus&quot;. He also suggests a debt of influence for the murder of Rutland in Act 1, Scene 3 from &quot;Slaughter of the Innocents&quot;. Emrys Jones further suggests that Shakespeare may have been influenced in York&#x27;s death scene by Desiderius Erasmus&#x27; &quot;Tragicus Rex&quot; and Thomas More&#x27;s &quot;Utopia&quot; (1516) and &quot;History of King Richard III&quot; (1518), from which some of Richard&#x27;s soliloquy in Act 5, Scene 6 is taken, especially the references to the need to play the actor.

==Date and text==

===Date===

&quot;The True Tragedie of Richard Duke of Yorke, and the death of good King Henrie the Sixt, with the Whole Contention betweene the two Houses Lancaster and Yorke&quot; (referred to hereafter as &quot;True Tragedy&quot;) was published in octavo in 1595 by the bookseller Thomas Millington and printed by Peter Short. It has been theorised that the &quot;True Tragedy&quot; is a reported text of a performance of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, and if so, &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; was written by 1595 at the latest.

However, there is evidence that the play may have been written several years earlier and was on stage by September 1592. Robert Greene&#x27;s pamphlet &quot;A Groatsworth of Wit&quot; (registered on 20 September 1592) parodies a line from &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; whilst mocking Shakespeare, to whom Greene refers as &quot;an upstart crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his &#x27;tiger&#x27;s heart wrapped in a player&#x27;s hide&#x27;, supposes that he is as well able to bombast out a blank verse as the best of you, and being an absolute &quot;Johannes fac totum&quot;, is in his own conceit the only Shake-scene in a country.&quot; This parodies &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, 1.4.138, where York refers to Margaret as a &quot;tiger&#x27;s heart wrapped in woman&#x27;s hide&quot;. This parody proves that &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; was well known by at least September 1592, which means it must have been staged prior to 23 June, as that was when the government shut the theatres to prevent an outbreak of plague. As such, for the play to have been on stage by 23 June, it had to have been written in either 1591 or early 1592.

For a discussion of whether the three parts of the trilogy were composed in chronological order, see &quot;Henry VI, Part I&quot;.

===Text===

The 1595 octavo text of the &quot;True Tragedy&quot; was reprinted in quarto in 1600 by William White for Millington. It was reprinted in folio in 1619 as part of William Jaggard&#x27;s False Folio, printed for Thomas Pavier. This text was printed together with a version of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; which had been printed in quarto in 1594 under the title &quot;The First part of the Contention betwixt the two famous Houses of Yorke and Lancaster, with the death of the good Duke Humphrey: And the banishment and death of the Duke of Suffolke, and the Tragicall end of the proud Cardinal of Winchester, with the notable Rebellion of Jack Cade: and the Duke of Yorke&#x27;s first claim unto the Crowne&quot;(referred to hereafter as &quot;The Contention&quot;). In the False Folio the two plays were grouped under the general title &quot;The Whole Contention betweene the Two Famous Houses, Lancaster and Yorke. With the Tragicall ends of the good Duke Humfrey, Richard Duke of Yorke, and King Henrie the sixt&quot;. Also printed with &quot;The Whole Contention&quot; was &quot;Pericles, Prince of Tyre&quot;.

The text of the play known today as &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; was not published until the 1623 &quot;First Folio&quot;, under the title &quot;The third Part of Henry the Sixt, with the death of the Duke of Yorke&quot;.

When the play came to be called &quot;Part 3&quot; is unclear, although most critics tend to assume it was the invention of the First Folio editors, John Heminges and Henry Condell, as there are no references to the play under the title &quot;Part 3&quot;, or any derivative thereof, prior to 1623.

==Analysis and criticism==

===Critical history===
Some critics argue that the &quot;Henry VI&quot; trilogy were the first ever plays to be based on recent English history, and as such, they deserve an elevated position in the canon, and a more central role in Shakespearean criticism. According to F.P. Wilson for example, &quot;There is no certain evidence that any dramatist before the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 dared to put upon the public stage a play based upon English history [...] so far as we know, Shakespeare was the first.&quot; However, not all critics agree with Wilson here. For example, Michael Taylor argues that there were at least thirty-nine history plays prior to 1592, including the two-part Christopher Marlowe play &quot;Tamburlaine&quot; (1587), Thomas Lodge&#x27;s &quot;The Wounds of Civil War&quot; (1588), the anonymous &quot;The Troublesome Reign of King John&quot; (1588), &quot;Edmund Ironside&quot; (1590 – also anonymous), Robert Greene&#x27;s &quot;Selimus&quot; (1591) and another anonymous play, &quot;The True Tragedy of Richard III&quot; (1591). Paola Pugliatti, however, argues that the case may be somewhere between Wilson and Taylor&#x27;s argument; &quot;Shakespeare may not have been the first to bring English history before the audience of a public playhouse, but he was certainly the first to treat it in the manner of a mature historian rather than in the manner of a worshipper of historical, political and religious myth.&quot;

Another issue often discussed amongst critics is the quality of the play. Along with &quot;1 Henry VI&quot;, &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; has traditionally been seen as one of Shakespeare&#x27;s weakest plays, with critics often citing the amount of violence as indicative of Shakespeare&#x27;s artistic immaturity and inability to handle his chronicle sources, especially when compared to the more nuanced and far less violent second historical tetralogy (&quot;Richard II&quot;, &quot;1 Henry IV&quot;, &quot;2 Henry IV&quot; and &quot;Henry V&quot;). For example, critics such as E.M.W. Tillyard, Irving Ribner and A.P. Rossiter have all claimed that the play violates neoclassical precepts of drama, which dictate that violence and battle should never be shown mimetically on stage, but should always be reported diegetically in dialogue. This view was based on traditional notions of the distinction between high and low art, a distinction which was itself based partly upon Philip Sidney&#x27;s &quot;An Apology for Poetry&quot; (1579). Based on the work of Horace, Sidney criticised &quot;Gorboduc&quot; for showing too many battles and being too violent when it would have been more artistic to verbally represent such scenes. The belief was that any play which actually &quot;showed&quot; violence was crude, appealing only to the ignorant masses, and was therefore low art. On the other hand, any play which elevated itself above such direct representation of violence and instead relied on the writer&#x27;s ability to verbalise and his skill for diegesis, was considered artistically superior and therefore, high art. Writing in 1605, Ben Jonson commented in &quot;The Masque of Blackness&quot; that showing battles on stage was only &quot;for the vulgar, who are better delighted with that which pleaseth the eye, than contenteth the ear.&quot; Based upon these theories, &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, with its four on-stage battles and multiple scenes of violence and murder, was considered a coarse play with little to recommend it to the intelligentsia.

On the other hand, however, writers like Thomas Heywood and Thomas Nashe praised battle scenes in general as oftentimes being intrinsic to the play and not simply vulgar distractions for the illiterate. In &quot;Piers Penniless his Supplication to the Devil&quot; (1592), Nashe praised the didactic element of drama which depicted battle and martial action, arguing that such plays were a good way of teaching both history and military tactics to the masses; in such plays &quot;our forefather&#x27;s valiant acts (that have lain long buried in rusty brass and worm-eaten books) are revived.&quot; Nashe also argued that plays which depict glorious national causes from the past rekindle a patriotic fervour which has been lost in &quot;the puerility of an insipid present,&quot; and that such plays &quot;provide a rare exercise of virtue in reproof to these degenerate effeminate days of ours.&quot; Similarly, in &quot;An Apology for Actors&quot; (1612), Heywood writes, &quot;So bewitching a thing is lively and well-spirited action, that it hath power to new mould the hearts of the spectators, and fashion them to the shape of any noble and notable attempt.&quot; More recently, speaking of &quot;1 Henry VI&quot;, Michael Goldman has argued that battle scenes are vital to the overall movement and purpose of the play; &quot;the sweep of athletic bodies across the stage is used not only to provide an exciting spectacle but to focus and clarify, to render dramatic, the entire unwieldy chronicle.&quot;

In line with this thinking, recent scholarship has tended to look at the play as being a more complete dramatic text, rather than a series of battle scenes loosely strung together with a flimsy narrative. Certain modern productions in particular have done much to bring about this re-evaluation (such as Peter Hall&#x27;s and John Barton&#x27;s in 1963 and 1964, Terry Hands&#x27; in 1977, Michael Bogdanov&#x27;s in 1986, Adrian Nobles&#x27; in 1988, Katie Mitchell&#x27;s in 1994, Edward Hall&#x27;s in 2000 and Michael Boyd&#x27;s in 2000 and 2006). Based upon this revised way of thinking, and looking at the play as more complex than has traditionally been allowed for, some critics now argue that the play &quot;juxtaposes the stirring aesthetic appeal of martial action with discursive reflection on the political causes and social consequences.&quot;

The question of artistic integrity, however, is not the only critical disagreement which &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; has provoked. There are numerous other issues about which critics are divided, not the least aspect of which concerns its relationship to &quot;True Tragedy&quot;.

====&quot;True Tragedy&quot; as a reported text====

Over the years, critics have debated the connection between &quot;True Tragedy&quot; and &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;. Four main theories have emerged:

# &quot;True Tragedy&quot; is a reconstructed version of a performance of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;; a &quot;bad octavo&quot;, an attempt by actors to reconstruct the original play from memory and sell it. The theory originated with Samuel Johnson in 1765, and was refined by Peter Alexander in 1928.
# &quot;True Tragedy&quot; is an early draft of Shakespeare&#x27;s play published in the 1623 &quot;First Folio&quot; as &quot;The third Part of Henry the Sixt&quot;. The theory originated with Edmond Malone in 1790 as an alternative to Johnson&#x27;s memorial reconstruction theory, and is championed today by critics such as Steven Urkowitz.
# &quot;True Tragedy&quot; is both a reported text and an early draft of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;. This theory gained increasing support in the latter half of the 20th century, and is supported by several modern editors of the play.
# Shakespeare was not the author of the &quot;True Tragedy&quot;, but made use of the anonymous play as the basis for his &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;. The theory originated with Georg Gottfried Gervinus in 1849, and remained popular throughout the 19th century, with Thomas Lodge and George Peele the leading candidates as possible authors of the &quot;True Tragedy&quot;. The theory fell out of favour in the twentieth century.

Critical opinion originally favoured Samuel Johnson&#x27;s theory that the &quot;True Tragedy&quot; is a bad quarto, a memorial reconstruction. Edmond Malone challenged Johnson&#x27;s theory in 1790, suggesting that the &quot;True Tragedy&quot; could be an early draft of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;. Malone&#x27;s view was the dominant one until 1929, when Peter Alexander re-established the dominance of the bad quarto theory.

One of Alexander&#x27;s main arguments hinged on the start of Act 4, Scene 1, where Richard and Clarence reproach Edward for favouring his wife&#x27;s relatives over themselves. In &quot;True Tragedy&quot;, after Edward has been informed of Warwick&#x27;s allegiance with the Lancastrians, he is upbraided by his brothers for his recent actions;
&quot;CLARENCE&quot;
...Lord Hastings well deserves,
To have the daughter and heir of the Lord Hungerford.

&quot;EDWARD&quot;
And what then? It was our will it should be so.

&quot;CLARENCE&quot;
Ay, and for such a thing too the Lord Scales
Did well deserve at your hands, to have the
Daughter of the Lord Bonfield, and left your
Brothers to go seek elsewhere.
:::::::(ll.2074–2083)
This implies that Lord Hastings is set to marry the daughter of Lord Hungerford, and Lord Scales is set to marry the daughter of Lord Bonfield. In &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, however, the lines are different;
&quot;CLARENCE&quot;
...Lord Hastings well deserves
To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford.

&quot;EDWARD&quot;
What of that? It was my will and grant,
And for this once, my will shall stand as law.

&quot;RICHARD&quot;
And yet methinks your Grace hath not done well
To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales
Unto the brother of your loving bride;
She better would have fitted me, or Clarence,
But in your bride you bury brotherhood.

&quot;CLARENCE&quot;
Or else, you would not have bestowed the heir,
Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife&#x27;s son,
And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere.
:::::::(4.1.48–59)
This explains that it was Lord Scales&#x27; daughter (Elizabeth de Scales) who was to marry Lady Grey&#x27;s brother (Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl of Rivers), and Lady Grey&#x27;s son (Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset) who was to marry the daughter of Lord Bonville (Cecily Bonville). As such, based on the inconsistency between Scales marrying Bonfield&#x27;s daughter in &quot;True Tragedy&quot; and Scales&#x27; daughter marrying Grey&#x27;s brother in &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, Alexander argued that the representation of the scene in &quot;True Tragedy&quot; is completely nonsensical and probably came about because the reporter became confused about who was married whom. Furthermore, unlike the account in &quot;True Tragedy&quot;, the version in &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; corresponds closely to the chronicle material found in Hall (&quot;the heir of the Lord Scales [Edward] hath married to his wife&#x27;s brother, the heir also of the Lord Bonville and Harrington he hath given to his wife&#x27;s son, and the heir of the Lord Hungerford he hath granted to the Lord Hastings&quot;). In relation to mistakes like this, it has been argued that &quot;no one who understood what he was writing, that is – no author – could have made such error[s], but someone parroting someone else&#x27;s work of which he himself had but a dim understanding – that is, a reporter – could have.&quot;
However, even more telling than the difference between the details of the proposed marriages is the contrast between the two names; Bonfield in &quot;True Tragedy&quot; and Bonville in &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;. Bonfield is never mentioned in the chronicles, and there is no known historical personage of that name. Bonville on the other hand is mentioned numerous times by both Hall and Holinshed, and is a known historical figure. However, there is a minor character named Bonfield in the Robert Greene play &quot;George a Greene, the Pinner of Wakefield&quot; (1587–1590), where he is a member of a group of staunch opponents of Edward III. &quot;George a Greene&quot; was published in quarto in 1599, and the title page states that it was performed by Sussex&#x27;s Men. In 1594, Sussex&#x27;s Men had performed &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;, which, according to the title page of the 1594 quarto, was also performed by Strange&#x27;s Men (i.e. Derby&#x27;s Men) and Pembroke&#x27;s Men. Furthermore, according to the title page of the 1595 octavo of &quot;True Tragedy&quot;, it was performed by Pembroke&#x27;s Men. As such, Pembroke&#x27;s Men performed both &quot;True Tragedy&quot; and &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;, whereas Sussex&#x27;s Men performed both &quot;George a Greene&quot; and &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;, thus creating a link between &quot;True Tragedy&quot; and &quot;George a Greene&quot;, and perhaps suggesting that either Sussex&#x27;s Men could have performed &quot;True Tragedy&quot; or Pembroke&#x27;s Men could have performed &quot;George a Greene&quot;, or both. Taken together, the name of Bonfield &quot;in two historically unrelated texts performed by companies that shared scripts and personnel indicates that the name is a non-authorial interpolation by players.&quot; That this could be the case is further supported by the fact that reported texts often use material from other plays. For example, &quot;The Contention&quot; uses material from Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus&quot; (), &quot;Edward II&quot; () and even a line from &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;; &quot;If our King Henry had shook hands with death&quot; (1.4.103).

More evidence of reporting is found in Act 2 Scene 5. In this scene, in &quot;True Tragedy&quot;, after realising that the Battle of Towton is lost, Exeter, Margaret and Prince Edward urge Henry to flee, with Exeter exclaiming, &quot;Away my Lord for vengeance comes along with him&quot; (l.1270). However, this is totally unqualified – there is no indication whatsoever of who &quot;he&quot; is. In &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, however, the line is &quot;Away; for vengeance comes along with them&quot; (l.124). In this case, &quot;them&quot; is Warwick, Richard and Edward, all of whom are mentioned by Prince Edward and Margaret in the lines immediately preceding Exeter&#x27;s. As such, the line in &quot;True Tragedy&quot; can only be understood if one refers to the equivalent scene in &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;. This type of anomaly, where vital pieces of qualifying information are omitted, is common in the bad quartos.

A similar piece of evidence is found in Act 5, Scene 1. After Warwick and his troops have entered Coventry and are awaiting the arrival of Oxford, Somerset, Montague and Clarence, Richard urges Edward to storm the city and attack Warwick immediately. In &quot;True Tragedy&quot;, Edward refuses, arguing &quot;No, some other may set upon our backs/We&#x27;ll stay till all be entered and then follow them&quot; (ll.2742–2743). In &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; however, Edward says, &quot;So other foes may set upon our backs./Stand we in good array: for they no doubt/Will issue out again, and bid us battle&quot; (ll.61–63). The difference between the two passages is that in &quot;True Tragedy&quot;, Edward &quot;knows&quot; more regiments are coming (&quot;we&#x27;ll stay till be all be entered&quot;), but in the context of the play, he has no way of knowing this, he should be unaware that Oxford, Somerset, Montague and Clarence are heading to Coventry. In &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; however, he merely feels that attacking would be a bad idea as it would leave their rear defenceless (&quot;so other foes may set upon our backs&quot;). This suggests that in &quot;True Tragedy&quot;, the reporter was thinking ahead, anticipating the arrival of the others and anachronistically having a character aware of their inevitable arrival. Again, as with the omission of important information, this illogical foreknowledge of events is the type of mistake which characterises the bad quartos in general.

====&quot;True Tragedy&quot; as early draft====
Steven Urkowitz has spoken at great length about the debate between the bad quarto theory and the early draft theory, coming down firmly on the side of the early draft. Urkowitz argues that the quarto of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; and the octavo of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; actually present scholars with a unique opportunity to see a play evolving, as Shakespeare edited and rewrote certain sections; &quot;the texts of &quot;2&quot; and &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; offer particularly rich illustrations of textual variation and theatrical transformation.&quot; Urkowitz argues that the Bonfield/Bonville variant in &quot;True Tragedy&quot;/&quot;3 Henry VI&quot; &quot;is dramatically defensible because it still supports Clarence&#x27;s complaint against Edward and motivates his ensuing defection to the Lancastrians. This change therefore, gets across the &quot;intent&quot; of the chronicle history.&quot; Urkowitz argues that &quot;such fine-tuning of dramatic themes and actions are staples of professional theatrical writing.&quot; As such, the differences in the texts are exactly the types of differences one tends to find in texts which were altered from an original form, and Urkowitz cites Eric Rasmussen, E.A.J. Honigmann and Grace Ioppolo as supporting this view. He particularly refers to the case of Richard Brinsley Sheridan&#x27;s &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; (1777), which existed in an earlier form, also by Sheridan, in a two-part play &quot;The Slanderers&quot; and &quot;Sir Peter Teazel&quot;, and which he argues contain the same type of modifications as is found in the &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays.

Urkowitz is not alone in finding evidence to support the early draft theory. One of the main arguments as to the early draft theory is how &quot;True Tragedy&quot; and &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; use Holinshed and Hall. Whereas in &quot;True Tragedy&quot;, Shakespeare uses Hall more than Holinshed, in &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; the use of Hall and Holinshed is roughly equal. The argument is that this difference cannot be accounted for by faulty reporting, and instead must represent revision on Shakespeare&#x27;s part; &quot;The nature of the differences between &quot;True Tragedy&quot; and &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; in terms of factual details, diction, and interpretive commentary by Hall and Holinshed reasonably suggests a direction of change, as well as the presence of an informed agency at work in revising the play reported by &quot;True Tragedy&quot;.&quot;

An example of this can be found when Clarence returns to the Yorkist forces in Act 5, Scene 1. In &quot;True Tragedy&quot;, his turn is anticipated;
&quot;CLARENCE&quot;
Clarence, Clarence for Lancaster.

&quot;EDWARD&quot;
&quot;Et tu, Brute&quot;, wilt thou stab Caesar too?
A parley sir, to George of Clarence.

&quot;Sound a parley, and Richard and Clarence whisper together, and then Clarence takes his red rose out of his hat, and throws it at Warwick.&quot;

&quot;WARWICK&quot;
Come Clarence come, thou wilt if Warwick call.

&quot;CLARENCE&quot;
Father of Warwick, know you what this means?
I throw mine infamy at thee.
:::::::(ll.2762–2768)
In this version of the scene, Richard is shown as primarily responsible for turning Clarence back to the Yorkist side; whatever he says during their parley convinces Clarence to rejoin his brothers. This is how the incident is represented in Hall; &quot;Richard Duke of Gloucester, brother to [Clarence and Edward], as though he had been made arbiter between them, first rode to [Clarence] and with him communed very secretly; from him he came to King Edward and with like secretness so used him that in conclusion no unnatural war but a fraternal amity was concluded and proclaimed and both the brethren lovingly embraced, and familiarly communed together.&quot;

In &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; however, the scene plays out differently;
&quot;Enter Clarence with Drum and Soldiers bearing colours.&quot;

&quot;WARWICK&quot;
And lo, where George of Clarence sweeps along.
Of force enough to bid his brother battle:
With whom, in upright zeal to right, prevails
More than the nature of a brother&#x27;s love
Come Clarence, come: thou wilt if Warwick call.

&quot;CLARENCE&quot;
Father of Warwick, know you what this means?

&quot;He shows his red rose.&quot;

Look here, I throw my infamy at thee.
:::::::(5.1.76–82)
This version of the scene corresponds to Holinshed, where Richard plays no part in Clarence&#x27;s decision; &quot;the Duke of Clarence began to weigh with himself the great inconvenience into the which as well his brother King Edward, as himself and his younger brother the Duke of Gloucester were fallen through the dissension betwixt them (which had been compassed and brought to pass by the politic working of the Earl of Warwick).&quot; The argument here is that the difference in &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; could not simply be the result of faulty reporting, or even interpolation on the part of a reporter, but must represent authorial agency, hence, &quot;True Tragedy&quot; must represent an earlier draft of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;.
Also important in this argument is the action which is implied as taking place between Act 5, Scene 4 and Act 5, Scene 5. In both &quot;True Tragedy&quot; and &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, after Margaret rallies her troops, they exit the stage to the sounds of battle, followed by the entry of the victorious Yorkists. The difference in the two texts is in the presentation of this victory. In &quot;True Tragedy&quot;, Margaret, Prince Edward, Oxford and Somerset are all introduced together, all taken captive at the same time, which is how the incident is reported in Hall; all the Lancastrian leaders were captured in the field and brought to the Yorkist camp together. However, in &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, Margaret, Oxford and Somerset are introduced initially, and subsequently Prince Edward is led into the camp (l.11; &quot;And lo where youthful Edward comes&quot;). This separate capture of Edward follows Holinshed, who outlines that Edward fled the field, was captured in a nearby house, and then brought to the camp alone to be with his fellow Lancastrians, who were already prisoners there. Again, the implication is that Shakespeare initially used Hall when composing &quot;True Tragedy&quot;, but some time after 1594, and for whatever reason, he modified his thinking, and changed the scene to reflect the account in Holinshed instead.

However, the theory that &quot;True Tragedy&quot; may be an early draft does not necessarily imply that it could not also represent a bad quarto as well. Traditionally, most critics (such as Alexander, McKerrow and Urkowitz) have looked at the problem as an either-or situation; &quot;True Tragedy&quot; is &quot;either&quot; a reported text &quot;or&quot; an early draft, but recently there has been some argument that it may be both. For example, this is the theory supported by Randall Martin in his &quot;Oxford Shakespeare&quot; edition of the play. It is also the theory advanced by Roger Warren in his &quot;Oxford Shakespeare&quot; edition of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;. The crux of the argument is that both the evidence for the bad quarto theory and the evidence for the early draft theory are so compelling that neither is able to completely refute the other. As such, if the play contains evidence of being both a reported text &quot;and&quot; an early draft, it must be both; i.e. &quot;True Tragedy&quot; represents a reported text &quot;of&quot; an early draft of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;. Shakespeare wrote an early version of the play, which was staged. Shortly after that staging, some of the actors constructed a bad quarto from it and had it published. In the meantime, Shakespeare had rewritten the play into the form found in the &quot;First Folio&quot;. Martin argues that this is the only theory which can account for the strong evidence for both reporting and revision, and it is a theory which is gaining increased support in the late twentieth/early twenty-first century.

====Differences between &quot;True Tragedy&quot; and &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;====
If one accepts that Shakespeare made a conscious decision to use Holinshed more frequently during his re-editing of &quot;True Tragedy&quot;, one must ask why he may have done so. &quot;True Tragedy&quot; is roughly one thousand lines shorter than &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, and whilst many of the differences are simple aesthetic changes and alternate phraseology (much of which is easily attributable to inaccurate reporting), one major difference between the two that runs throughout is how they each handle violence. On the whole, &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; is far more restrained in its depiction of war, whereas &quot;True Tragedy&quot; has more explicit and sustained on-stage combat and more royal processions and celebrations after combat. Much more so than does &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, &quot;True Tragedy&quot; conforms to the so-called Tudor myth that the Wars of Roses were God&#x27;s punishment for people straying from the path laid out for them, and His means of purging the country of evil and opening the way for the righteous Tudor dynasty to establish peace. Traditionally, this has been a common way of interpreting the entire octalogy; advocated and elaborated upon by critics as diverse as August Wilhelm Schlegel, Hermann Ulrici, Georg Gottfried Gervinus, Irving Ribner, M.M. Reese, Robert Rentoul Reed, and, most famously, E.M.W. Tillyard, with whom the phrase Tudor myth is now most associated.

Some critics, however, such as Henry Ansgar Kelly, A.P. Rossiter, A.L. French, David Frey, J.P. Brockbank, David Riggs, Michael Hattaway, Michael Taylor, Randall Martin and Ronald Knowles, argue that this is the main reason Shakespeare chose to use Holinshed rather than Hall, as Holinshed&#x27;s attitude to violence was less celebratory than Hall&#x27;s, his patriotic fervour less pronounced, and his attitude to carnage more ambiguous; i.e. Shakespeare had become less enamoured of the Tudor view of history, and altered his play accordingly. As Paola Pugliatti puts it, &quot;Source manipulation and sheer invention may be read as a distinctly critical gesture, in that they show the need to question the official historiographical tradition.&quot;

Examples of the difference in depictions of violence between &quot;True Tragedy&quot; and &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; include Act 2, Scene 6; in &quot;True Tragedy&quot;, the stage direction dictates that Clifford enter &quot;with an arrow in his neck&quot;, whereas in &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, he simply enters &quot;wounded.&quot; In Act 4, Scene 3, when Warwick surprises Edward in his tent, in &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, Richard and Hastings simply flee, but in &quot;True Tragedy&quot;, there is a short battle between Warwick&#x27;s and Richard&#x27;s soldiers. Similarly, in &quot;True Tragedy&quot;, Act 5, Scene 5 begins with &quot;Alarms to the battle, York flies, then the chambers be discharged. Then enter the King, Clarence and Gloucester and the rest, and make a great shout, and cry &quot;For York, for York&quot;, and then the Queen is taken, and the Prince and Oxford and Somerset, and then sound and enter all again.&quot; &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; begins with the far less grandiose &quot;Flourish. Enter Edward, Gloucester, Clarence, and Soldiers, with Queen Margaret, Oxford and Somerset prisoners.&quot;

Taking all of these differences into account, the argument is that &quot;Shakespeare reconceived the action, toning down the sound and fury, and thereby altering the overall effect and meaning of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; as a play whose attitude to war is more rueful.&quot;

====Montague problem====
Another aspect of the play which has provoked critical disagreement is the character of Montague. He is introduced in Act 1, Scene 1 as a Yorkist supporter who fought at the Battle of St Albans (dramatised at the end of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;), and he accompanies York, Richard, Edward, Warwick and Norfolk from the battlefield to London in pursuit of Henry, Margaret and Clifford. In Act 1, Scene 2, upon realising that Margaret is set to attack, York sends Montague to London to get Warwick; &quot;My brother Montague shall post to London./Let noble Warwick, Cobham, and the rest/Whom we have left protectors of the King,/With powerful policy strengthen themselves&quot; (ll.55–58). Montague duly leaves, and when Warwick returns in Act 2, Scene 1, he is accompanied by a character called Montague, but who he introduces as an apparently new character; &quot;...Therefore Warwick came to seek you out,/And therefore comes my brother Montague.&quot; (ll.166–167).

As such, the character of Montague seems to represent two separate historical personages in the play, and whilst this is not unusual in Shakespearean histories, the manner of the dual representation is. For example, in &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; and &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;, the character of Somerset represents both John Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset and his younger brother, Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset. Similarly, in &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, another character called Somerset represents both Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset and his younger brother Edmund Beaufort, 4th Duke of Somerset. However, both Somerset in &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; and &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; and Somerset in &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; are presented as consistent characters &quot;within&quot; the play, i.e. Somerset in &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; and &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; does not represent John Beaufort sometimes and Edmund Beaufort at others; he is consistently the &quot;same&quot; character in the &quot;milieu&quot; of the play. The same is true of Somerset in &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;; &quot;as a character&quot;, he is always the same person.

Montague however, seems to represent two different people at different times in the play; i.e. the character himself changes identities during the play. Initially he seems to represent Salisbury, Warwick&#x27;s father (Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury – a major character in &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;) and subsequently, he seems to represent Salisbury&#x27;s son and Warwick&#x27;s brother, John Neville (1st Marquis of Montague – a new character). In &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, at 1.1.14, 1.1.117–118 and 1.2.60, Montague refers to York as his &#x27;brother&#x27;. Similarly, at 1.2.4, 1.2.36 and 1.2.55, York refers to Montague as his &#x27;brother&#x27;. If Montague here represents Salisbury, their reference to one another as &#x27;brother&#x27; makes sense, as Salisbury was York&#x27;s brother-in-law (York was married to Salisbury&#x27;s sister, Cecily Neville). However, if Montague here represents John Neville, his and York&#x27;s references to one another as &#x27;brother&#x27; are inaccurate. Subsequently, at 2.1.168, Warwick refers to Montague as brother, and he is also called Marquis for the first time, neither descriptions of which could be applied to Salisbury or to any character who describes himself as a brother to York. As such, in 1.1 and 1.2, Montague seems to be York&#x27;s brother-in-law, and Warwick&#x27;s father, Richard Neville (i.e. Salisbury), but from that point forward, after his re-introduction in Act 2, he seems to represent Salisbury&#x27;s son and Warwick&#x27;s younger brother, John Neville. Salisbury is a major character in &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;, as he is in both Hall and Holinshed&#x27;s chronicles, and in reality, as outlined in the chronicles, he was killed at Pontefract in 1461 having been captured by Margaret at the Battle of Wakefield (depicted in 1.3 and 1.4).

In &quot;True Tragedy&quot; (which treats the character of Montague as one consistent persona throughout the play), Salisbury&#x27;s death is reported by Richard;
Thy noble father in the thickest throngs,
Cried full for Warwick, his thrice valiant son,
Until with thousand swords he was beset,
And many wounds made in his aged breast,
As he tottering sat upon his steed,
He waft his hand to me and cried aloud:
&#x27;Richard, commend me to my valiant son&#x27;,
And still he cried &#x27;Warwick revenge my death&#x27;,
And with those words he tumbled off his horse,
And so the noble Salisbury gave up the ghost.
:::::::(ll.1075–1085)
In the corresponding scene in &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; however, Richard reports the death of another of Warwick&#x27;s brothers, Thomas Neville, who never features as a character in any of the &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays;
Thy brother&#x27;s blood the thirsty earth hath drunk,
Broached with the steely point of Clifford&#x27;s lance,
Until with thousand swords he was beset,
And in the very pangs of death he cried,
Like to a dismal clangor heard from afar
&#x27;Warwick revenge, brother, revenge my death.&#x27;
So underneath the belly of their steeds,
That stained their fetlocks in his smoking blood,
The noble gentleman gave up the ghost.
:::::::(2.3.14–23)
It is generally agreed amongst critics that the differences between these two passages represents authorial revision as opposed to faulty reporting, leading one to ask the question of why Shakespeare removed the references to Salisbury, and why he wrote the preceding lines where Warwick re-introduces Montague as his brother. There is no definitive answer to this question, nor is there any answer to the question of why Shakespeare changed the character&#x27;s name from Salisbury to Montague and then, after Act 1, equated him with another personage entirely.

Obviously, such a character discrepancy can create a problem for productions of the play. As an example of one way in which productions can resolve the problem, in Act 1, Scene 1 of the 1981 &quot;BBC Shakespeare&quot; adaptation, Montague is not present in either the persona of Salisbury or that of John Neville. As such, his first two lines, &quot;Good brother, as thou lov&#x27;st and honour&#x27;st arms,/Let&#x27;s fight it out and not stand cavilling thus&quot; (ll.117–118), are reassigned to Clarence and altered to &quot;Set it on your head good father/If thou lov&#x27;st and honour&#x27;st arms,/Let&#x27;s fight it out and not stand cavilling thus.&quot; Montague&#x27;s second line, &quot;And I unto the sea from when I came&quot; (l.210), is entirely absent. As a character, Montague is then introduced in Act 1, Scene 2, played by Michael Byrne (as he is for the rest of the production). His first line in this scene however, &quot;But I have reasons strong and forcible&quot; (l.3) is reassigned to Clarence. Later, when York is giving his men instructions, his order to Montague, &quot;Brother, thou shalt to London presently&quot; (l.36) is changed to &quot;Cousin, thou shalt to London presently&quot;, and York&#x27;s reiteration of the order &quot;My brother Montague shall post to London&quot; (l.54) is changed to &quot;Hast you to London my cousin Montague.&quot; Additionally, Montague&#x27;s &quot;Brother, I go, I&#x27;ll win them, fear it not&quot; (l.60) is changed to &quot;Cousin, I go, I&#x27;ll win them, fear it not.&quot; This all serves to establish a single figure who is York&#x27;s cousin and Warwick&#x27;s brother (i.e. John Neville).

How the adaptation handles the report of the death of Warwick and Montague&#x27;s brother Thomas Neville in Act 2, Scene 3 is also worth noting. The text from &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; reporting the death of Neville is used, but it is altered so as the report becomes about Salisbury;
Thy father&#x27;s blood the thirsty earth hath drunk,
Broached with the steely point of Clifford&#x27;s lance,
Until with thousand swords he was beset,
And in the very pangs of death he cried,
Like to a dismal clangor heard from afar
&#x27;Warwick revenge, son, revenge my death.&#x27;
So underneath the belly of their steeds,
That stained their fetlocks in his smoking blood,
The noble Salisbury gave up the ghost.
:::::::(2.3.14-23)
From this point forward, the character remains consistent as Warwick&#x27;s brother, and there is no further alteration of the text. As such, in this adaptation, the character is presented as one figure throughout – that of John Neville, Warwick&#x27;s brother, Salisbury&#x27;s son and York&#x27;s cousin, and any lines which seemingly contradict that have been changed accordingly.

===Language===
Language has an extremely important role throughout the play, especially in terms of repetition. Several motifs, words and allusions occur time and again, serving to contrast characters and situations, and to foreground certain important themes.
Perhaps the most obvious recurring linguistic motif in the play is that of state power as specifically represented by the crown and the throne. Both words occur multiple times throughout the play. For example, in Act 1, Scene 1 (which is set in parliament, with York spending most of the scene sitting on the throne), Warwick introduces the imagery, saying to York &quot;Before I see thee seated in that throne,/Which now the House of Lancaster usurps,/I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close&quot; (ll.22–24). He then introduces the word &quot;crown&quot;; &quot;Resolve thee Richard, claim the English crown&quot; (l.49). Immediately after York sits in the throne, Henry enters, exclaiming, &quot;My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,/Even in the chair of state. Belike he means,/Backed by the power of Warwick, that false peer,/To aspire unto the crown and reign as king&quot; (ll.50–54). During the subsequent debate over legitimacy, Exeter tells York &quot;Thy father was a traitor to the crown&quot; (l.80), to which York replies &quot;Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown&quot; (l.81). Also during the debate, Henry asks York, &quot;And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?&quot; (l.85). York next asks Henry, &quot;Will you we show our title to the crown? (l.103), to which Henry says &quot;What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?&quot; (l.105). As the debate reaches an impasse, Richard urges York, &quot;Father, tear the crown from the usurper&#x27;s head&quot; (l.115). Henry refuses to yield however, declaring &quot;Think&#x27;st thou that I will leave my kingly throne?&quot; (l.125). Subsequently, during the debate about the conflict between Henry Bolingbrook and Richard II, York asks Exeter if Richard&#x27;s abdication &quot;was prejudicial to his crown?&quot; (l.145) to which Exeter responds &quot;No, for he could not so resign his crown&quot; (l.146). York then demands that Henry &quot;Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs&quot; (l.173), to which Henry reluctantly agrees, &quot;I here entail/The crown to thee and to thine heirs forever&quot; (ll.195–196).

Although not all subsequent scenes are as heavily saturated with references to monarchical power as is the opening scene, the imagery does recur throughout the play. Other notable examples include Richard&#x27;s &quot;How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown,/Within whose circuit is Elysium/And all that poets feign of bliss and joy&quot; (1.2.29–31) and Edward&#x27;s battle cry, &quot;A crown or else a glorious tomb,/A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre&quot; (1.4.16). Also significant is the torture of York in Act 1, Scene 4, where he is forced to wear a paper crown, whilst Margaret alludes to both the real crown and the throne numerous times;
Ay, marry sir, now looks he like a King.
Ay, this is he that took King Henry&#x27;s chair,
And this is he was his adopted heir.
But how is it, that great Plantagenet
Is crowned so soon and broke his solemn oath?
As I bethink me, you should not be king,
Till our King Henry had shook hands with death.
And will you pale your head in Henry&#x27;s glory
And rob his temples of the diadem
Now in his Life, against your holy oath?
O &#x27;tis a fault too too unpardonable.
Off with the crown; and with the crown, his head,
And whilest we breath, take time to do him dead.
:::::::(ll.96–108)
Later, York takes off the crown and throws it at Margaret, exclaiming &quot;There, take the crown, and with the crown my curse&quot; (l.164).

Another example of language foregrounding authority by references to the crown and throne is found in Act 2, Scene 1, as Edward laments the death of his father; &quot;His dukedom and his chair with me is left&quot; (l.90), to which Richard answers, specifically foregrounding the issue of language and the importance of words, &quot;For &#x27;chair and dukedom&#x27;, &#x27;throne and kingdom&#x27; say&quot; (l.93). Warwick says something similar later in the scene, calling Edward &quot;No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York;/The next degree is England&#x27;s royal throne&quot; (l.192–193). After decapitating York, Margaret points out the head to Henry, saying, &quot;Yonder&#x27;s the head of that arch-enemy/That sought to be encumbered with your crown&quot; (2.2.2–3). Later, Edward asks Henry, &quot;Wilt thou kneel for grace/And set thy diadem upon my head?&quot; (2.2.81–82). Edward then says to Margaret, &quot;You that are king, though he do wear the crown&quot; (2.2.90). Later, in Act 2, Scene 6, when Edward is blaming Margaret for the civil war, he says to Henry that if she hadn&#x27;t provoked the House of York &quot;thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace&quot; (l.19). He then says to Warwick, &quot;For in thy shoulder do I build my seat&quot; (l.99). In Act 3, Scene 1, Henry then debates with the gamekeepers the importance of the crown to the role of kingship;
&quot;SECOND GAMEKEEPER&quot;
But if thou be a king, where is thy crown?

&quot;HENRY&quot;
My crown is in my heart, not on my head,
Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,
Nor to be seen: my crown is called content,
A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.

&quot;SECOND GAMEKEEPER&quot;
Well, if you be a king crowned with content,
Your crown content and you must be contented
To go along with us.
:::::::(ll.61–68)
During his lengthy soliloquy in Act 3, Scene 2, Richard also mentions the crown numerous times;
I&#x27;ll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,
And whiles I live t&#x27;account this world but hell
Until my misshaped trunk that bears this head
Be round impaled with a glorious crown.
And yet I know not how to get the crown.
:::::::(ll.168–173)
In Act 3, Scene 3, after Warwick has joined the Lancastrians, he vows to Margaret &quot;to force the tyrant from his seat by war&quot; (l.206), and promises &quot;I&#x27;ll uncrown him ere&#x27;t be long&quot; (l.232). He also muses to himself &quot;I was the chief that raised him to the crown,/And I&#x27;ll be chief to bring him down again&quot; (ll.263–264). In Act 4, Scene 6, after Warwick has successfully deposed Edward, Henry says to him, &quot;Warwick, although my head still wear the crown,/I here resign my government to thee&quot; (l.24). Finally, upon meeting Richmond (the future Henry VII), Henry proclaims, &quot;His head by nature framed to wear a crown,/His hand to wield a sceptre, and himself/Likely in time to bless a regal throne&quot; (ll.72–74).

Another recurring motif is animal imagery, particularly, bird imagery. The first example is in Act 1, Scene 1, when Warwick says &quot;[No-one] dares stir a wing if Warwick shake his bells&quot; (l.47), a reference to falconry. Again in the opening scene, Henry claims that York will, &quot;like an empty eagle/Tire on the flesh of me and my son&quot; (ll.269–270). Later, as York describes his failed attempts to win the recently concluded battle, he muses to himself, &quot;We botched again, as I have often seen a swan/With bootless labour swim against the tide&quot; (1.4.19–20). Subsequently, as Clifford tells York he will soon die, York declares &quot;My ashes, as the Phoenix&#x27;, may bring forth/A bird that will revenge upon you all&quot; (1.4.35–36), to which Clifford replies &quot;So cowards fight when they can fly no further,/So doves peck the falcon&#x27;s piercing talons&quot; (1.4.40–41). After the news of York&#x27;s death has reached them, Richard encourages Edward to take York&#x27;s place; &quot;If thou be that princely eagle&#x27;s bird&quot; (2.1.91). Later, Warwick points out that Henry has been compelled to rescind his oath to yield the throne to the House of York; &quot;Clifford and the Lord Northumberland/And of their feather many more proud birds,/Have wrought the easy-melting King like wax&quot; (2.1.169–171). When Clifford is urging Henry to protect the Prince&#x27;s birthright, he attempts to illustrate to Henry that doing the right thing for his children should be a natural course of action; &quot;Doves will peck in safeguard of their brood&quot; (2.2.18). During the debate about the rightful king, Edward refers to Clifford as &quot;that fatal screech owl/That nothing sung but death to us and ours&quot; (2.6.55–56). Bird imagery continues to be used contemptuously in France, where Margaret says of Edward and Warwick, &quot;both of you are birds of selfsame feather&quot; (3.3.161). Prior to the Battle of Barnet, as Somerset attempts to rally the troops, he says &quot;And he that will not fight for such a hope,/Go home to bed, and like the owl by day,/If he arise, be mocked and wondered at&quot; (5.4.55–57). When Richard visits Henry in the tower, Henry defends his suspicion of Richard&#x27;s intentions; &quot;The bird that hath been lim&#x27;d in a bush,/With trembling wings misdoubteth every bush&quot; (5.6.13–14). Birds also play an important part in Henry&#x27;s prophecy of Richard&#x27;s future evil reign, as he points out the many ill omens accompanying Richard&#x27;s birth; &quot;The owl shrieked at thy birth, an evil sign,/The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time,/Dogs howled and hideous tempest shook down trees,/The raven rooked her on the chimney&#x27;s top,/And chatt&#x27;ring pies in dismal discords sung&quot; (5.6.44–48).
Another commonly recurring animal motif is that of lambs and wolves. This is introduced in the opening scene when Margaret chastises Henry for yielding to York&#x27;s demands and relinquishing the throne to the House of York; &quot;Such safety finds/The trembling lamb environ&#x27;d with wolves&quot; (ll.243–244). Later, as York watches his army lose the Battle of Wakefield, he laments &quot;All my followers to the eager foe/Turn back and fly, like ships before the wind/Or lambs pursued by hunger-starv&#x27;d wolves&quot; (1.4.3–5). After being captured by the Lancastrians, York then refer to Margaret as &quot;She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France&quot; (1.4.111). During the Battle of Tewkesbury, as Richard and Clifford fight, they are interrupted by Warwick, and Clifford flees. Warwick attempts to pursue him, but Richard says, &quot;Nay Warwick, single out some other chase,/For myself will hunt this wolf to death&quot; (2.4.13). Prior to the battle of Barnet, Margaret rallies her troops by claiming Edward has destroyed the country and usurped the throne, then pointing out &quot;And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil&quot; (5.4.80). Finally, upon being left alone with Richard in the Tower, Henry proclaims &quot;So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf,/So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece,/And next his throat, unto the butcher&#x27;s knife&quot; (5.6.7–9).

A third recurring image is that of the lion. This is introduced by Rutland in Act 1, Scene 3; &quot;So looks the pent-up lion o&#x27;er the wretch&quot; (l.174). Later, Richard, speaking of York, says &quot;Methought he bore him in the thickest troop/As doth a lion in a herd of neat&quot; (2.1.13–14). As Clifford chastises Henry for disinheriting Prince Edward, he asks &quot;To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?/Not to the beast that would usurp the den&quot; (2.2.11–12). Lions are then mentioned in conjunction with lambs during the Battle of Tewkesbury; &quot;While lions roar and battle for their dens/Poor harmless lambs abide their enmity&quot; (2.5.74–75). Lions and lambs are again combined when, just before his second capture, Henry is wondering why the people prefer Edward to him; &quot;And when the lion fawns upon the lamb,/The lamb will never cease to follow him&quot; (4.8.49–50). Warwick later combines lions and birds during his death speech, &quot;I must yield my body to the earth/And by my fall, the conquest to my foe./Thus yields the cedar to the axe&#x27;s edge,/Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,/Under whose shade the ramping lion slept&quot; (5.2.9–13).

Other animals referred to in the play include dogs (1.4.56, 2.1.15 and 2.5.129), woodcocks (1.4.61), rabbits (1.4.62), snakes (1.4.112 and 2.2.15), tigers (1.4.138, 1.4.155 and 3.1.39), cattle (2.1.14), bears (2.1.15, 2.2.13 and 3.2.161), toads (2.2.138), bulls (2.5.126), hares (2.5.131), chameleons (3.2.191) and foxes (4.7.25).

===Themes===
====Revenge====
One of the most obvious themes in the play is revenge, which is cited numerous times by various different characters as the driving force for their actions. At different points in the play, Henry, Northumberland, Westmorland, Clifford, Richard, Edward and Warwick all cite a desire for revenge as a major factor in guiding their decisions, and revenge becomes a shared objective between both sides of the conflict, as each seek to redress the apparent wrongs perpetrated by the other; &quot;In &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, we witness the final degradation of chivalry: this play contains some of the most horrific scenes in the canon as England&#x27;s warlords sacrifice honour to a remorseless ethic of revenge.&quot;

The theme of revenge is introduced in the opening scene. Upon seeing York seated on the royal throne, Henry reminds his allies of their conflict with the Yorkists in an attempt to motivate them; &quot;Earl of Northumberland, [York] slew thy father,/And thine Lord Clifford, and you both have vowed revenge/On him, his sons, his favourites and his friends&quot; (1.1.54–56). Northumberland responds to this with &quot;If I be not, heavens be revenged on me&quot; (1.1.57). Later, after Henry has resigned the crown to the House of York and has been abandoned by Clifford, Westmorland and Northumberland, Exeter explains, &quot;They seek revenge and therefore shall not yield&quot; (1.1.191). Later, after Edward has been installed as king, Oxford refuses to acknowledge him, arguing &quot;Call him my king, by whose injurious doom/My elder brother the Lord Aubrey Vere/Was done to death? And more than so, my father&quot; (3.3.101-102).

Revenge, however, is not confined to the Lancastrians. Upon learning of the death of his father, Richard is almost overwhelmed with a manic thirst for vengeance;
I cannot weep, for all my body&#x27;s moisture
Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart, 
Nor can my tongue unload my heart&#x27;s great burden,
For selfsame wind that I should speak withal
Is kindling coals that fires all my breast
And burns me up with flames that tears would quench.
To weep is to make less the depth of grief;
Tears then for babes, blows and revenge for me.
Richard, I bear thy name, I&#x27;ll venge thy death,
Or die renown&#x27;d by attempting it.
:::::::(2.1.79–88)
Similarly, upon hearing of the death of his brother, Warwick vows, &quot;Here on my knee I vow to God above/I&#x27;ll never pause again, never stand still,/Till either death hath closed these eyes of mine/Or fortune given me measure of revenge&quot; (2.3.29–32). During his time in France, Warwick again cites revenge as part of his reason for joining the Lancastrians; &quot;Did I let pass th&#x27;abuse done to my niece?&quot; (3.3.188 – this is a reference to an incident reported in both Hall and Holinshed where Edward attempted to rape either Warwick&#x27;s daughter or his niece; &quot;Edward did attempt a thing once in the Earl&#x27;s house which was much against the Earl&#x27;s honesty (whether he would have deflowered his daughter or his niece, the certainty was not for both their honours openly known) for surely such a thing was attempted by King Edward&quot;). Only a few lines later, Warwick then exclaims, &quot;I will revenge [Edward&#x27;s] wrong to Lady Bona&quot; (3.3.197). He also acknowledges that revenge is his primary motive in joining the Lancastrians, not devotion to their cause; &quot;I&#x27;ll be the chief to bring [Edward] down again,/Not that I pity Henry&#x27;s misery,/But seek revenge on Edward&#x27;s mockery&quot; (3.3.264–266). It is perhaps Warwick who sums up the revenge ethic of the play; in Act 2, Scene 6, upon finding Clifford&#x27;s body, Warwick orders that Clifford&#x27;s head replace York&#x27;s at the gates of the city, declaring &quot;Measure for measure must be answer&#x27;d&quot; (l.54).
Of all the characters who advocate revenge however, Clifford is by far the most passionate. His obsession with revenge for the death of his father takes root before the play even begins, in the penultimate scene of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;;
Wast thou ordained, dear father,
To lose thy youth in peace, and to achieve
The silver livery of advis&#x27;d age,
And in thy reverence and thy chair-days, thus
To die in ruffian battle? Even at this sight
My heart is turned to stone; and while &#x27;tis mine
It shall be stony. York not our old men spares;
No more will I their babes. Tears virginal
Shall be to me even as the dew to fire,
And beauty that the tyrant oft reclaims
Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax.
Henceforth I will not have to do with pity.
Meet I an infant of the house of York,
Into as many gobbets will I cut it
As wild Medea young Absyrtus did.
In cruelty will I seek out my fame.
:::::::(5.2.45–60)
Early in &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, Clifford makes it clear that nothing has changed in his desire to revenge his father&#x27;s death. When Warwick mentions his father, Clifford responds &quot;Urge it no more, lest that instead of words,/I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger/As shall revenge his death before I stir&quot; (1.1.99–101). Later, refusing to bow to York, Clifford exclaims &quot;May that ground gape and swallow me alive/Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father&quot; (1.1.162–163). The murder of Rutland is particularly important in terms of Clifford&#x27;s pursuit of vengeance, as the scene is punctuated with a debate about the limits and moral implications of exacting revenge on someone who did no wrong in the first place;

&quot;RUTLAND&quot;
Sweet Clifford, hear me speak before I die:
I am too mean a subject for thy wrath;
Be thou revenged on men, and let me live.

&quot;CLIFFORD&quot; 
In vain thou speak&#x27;st, poor boy: my father&#x27;s blood
Hath stopped the passage where thy words should enter.

&quot;RUTLAND&quot;
Then let my father&#x27;s blood open it again:
He is a man, and Clifford cope with him.

&quot;CLIFFORD&quot; 
Had I thy brethren here, their lives and thine
Were not revenge sufficient for me:
No, if I digged up thy forefathers&#x27; graves
And hung their rotten coffins up in chains,
It could not slake mine ire, nor ease my heart.
The sight of any of the House of York
Is as a fury to torment my soul,
And till I root out their accurs&#x27;d line
And leave not one alive, I live in hell.
Therefore –
&quot;He lifts his hand.&quot;

&quot;RUTLAND&quot;
O let me pray, before I take my death!
To thee I pray; sweet Clifford pity me.

&quot;CLIFFORD&quot; 
Such pity as my rapier&#x27;s point affords.

&quot;RUTLAND&quot;
I never did thee harm, why wilt thou slay me?

&quot;CLIFFORD&quot; 
Thy Father hath.

&quot;RUTLAND&quot;
But &#x27;twas ere I was born.
Thou hast one son: for his sake pity me,
Least in revenge thereof, sith God is just,
He be as miserably slain as I.
Ah, let me live in prison all my days,
And when I give occasion of offence,
Then let me die, for now thou hast no cause.

&quot;CLIFFORD&quot; 
No cause? thy Father slew my Father: therefore die.

&quot;He stabs him.&quot;

&quot;RUTLAND&quot;
&quot;Dii faciant laudis summa sit ista tuæ.&quot;

&quot;CLIFFORD&quot;
Plantagenet, I come Plantagenet,
And this thy son&#x27;s blood cleaving to my blade
Shall rust upon my weapon, till thy blood
Congealed with this, do make me wipe off both.
:::::::(1.3.19–52)

Clifford subverts all notions of morality and chivalry in his dogged pursuit of revenge, determined to visit onto the House of York the same type of suffering as it delivered onto him with the death of his father. This culminates during the torture of York in Act 1, Scene 4. Only moments after capturing York, Clifford wants to execute him immediately, but is prevented from doing so by Margaret, who wishes to talk to, and taunt, York prior to killing him. When Margaret tells York that he will die soon, Clifford quickly points out, &quot;That is my office, for my father&#x27;s sake&quot; (l.109). Clifford remains relatively silent throughout most of the scene, speaking only immediately prior to his stabbing of York, and again, citing revenge as foremost in his mind; &quot;Here&#x27;s for my oath, here&#x27;s for my father&#x27;s death&quot; (l.175).

However, even with the death of his father&#x27;s killer, Clifford seems to remain obsessed with revenge. During his single combat with Richard at the Battle of Towton, Clifford attempts to evoke a desire for revenge in Richard by pointing out how he killed two members of Richard&#x27;s family;
Now Richard, I am here with thee alone,
This is the hand that stabbed thy father York
And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland,
And here&#x27;s the heart that triumphs in their death
And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother
To execute the like upon thyself;
And so have at thee.
:::::::(2.4.5–11)
Even at the point of his own death, Clifford cannot let go of revenge, transferring his own obsession onto his enemies, and assuming that in his death, they will have a measure of the revenge he so yearns for; &quot;Come York and Richard, Warwick and the rest,/I stabbed your father&#x27;s bosom, split my breast&quot; (2.6.28–29).

====Power and barbarism====

Despite the prevalence of revenge in the earlier parts of the play, it loses significance as a motivating factor as the nature of the conflict changes and develops into a pursuit of power, without recourse to past antagonisms. Revenge ceases to be the primary driving force for many of the characters, with lust for power taking over, and past conflicts rendered unimportant as each side desperately races for victory; &quot;the revenge ethic has been outstripped by expedient violence with no aim other than the seizure of power.&quot;

For example, when Edward and Richard are urging York to break his oath to Henry, Edward says, &quot;But for a kingdom, any oath may be broken;/I would break a thousand oaths to reign one year&quot; (1.2.16–17), thus showing the attraction that power has for the characters, and what they would be willing to do to attain it. Later, echoing Warwick&#x27;s statement about his reasons for joining the Lancastrians, Richard outlines why he has remained loyal to the Yorkists; &quot;I stay not for the love of Edward but the crown&quot; (4.1.125), again showing the attraction of power and the subversion of all other concerns, including familial relations. Another example is when Prince Edward is killed in Act 5, Scene 5. His death is brought about because he taunts the Plantagenet brothers, and they lose their temper with him, not because they are exacting revenge for an ongoing feud with his family. Similarly, when Richard kills Henry, his motives have nothing to do with the conflict between his family and Henry&#x27;s. He murders him simply because Henry stands in the way of his attempts to gain the throne. As Michael Hattaway writes, &quot;family loyalties may have been the initial cause of the feuds, but an audience watching &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; is likely to feel that individual ambition rather than family honour is what fuels the vendettas that inform the play. Both [families] seem to have forgotten that the quarrel between [them] originally was a dynastic one: their claims to legitimacy and authority in this play are now validated only by the forces they can muster&quot;. As Jane Howell, director of the &quot;BBC Shakespeare&quot; adaptation argues, &quot;anarchy is loosed and you&#x27;re left with a very different set of values – every man for himself. You&#x27;re into a time of change in which there is no code except survival of the fittest – who happens to be Richard.&quot;

The play depicts what happens when &quot;a nation turns on itself in epic savagery, dissolving its own social foundations.&quot; Significantly in this sense, the play has no antagonist, and both sides in the conflict are depicted as capable of atrocities in their pursuit of victory. For example, the opening moments of the play see Richard introduced carrying the head of the Duke of Somerset, whom he killed at the end of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;. The degradation of chivalric customs and human decency is emphasised when York responds to Richard&#x27;s arrival by &#x27;talking&#x27; to the head itself; &quot;But is your grace dead, my lord of Somerset&quot; (1.1.18). Michael Hattaway sees this scene as an important prologue to the play insofar as &quot;the act of desecration signifies the extinguishing of the residual chivalric code of conspicuous virtue, the eclipsing of honour by main force.&quot;

Another example of barbarism perpetrated by the Yorkists is the abuse of Clifford&#x27;s body in Act 2, Scene 6, where Edward, Richard, Clarence and Warwick all speak to the corpse in derision, sardonically wondering why it doesn&#x27;t answer them. Richard&#x27;s treatment of Henry&#x27;s body in the final scene is another example of the lack of reverence for the dead; after Henry&#x27;s death, Richard stabs the corpse, proclaiming &quot;Down, down to hell, and say I sent thee hither&quot; (5.6.67).

As such, with power being seen by many of the characters as the ultimate goal, the play also deals with themes of disloyalty and betrayal, and outlines the results of political factionalism and social breakdown; a once calm world is seen spiralling toward chaos as barbarism and immorality come to the fore. As E.M.W. Tillyard has written of the &quot;Henry VI&quot; trilogy; &quot;The second part had showed us the murder of Duke Humphrey of Gloucester, the rise of York, the destruction of two of Humphrey&#x27;s murderers and the enmity of the two survivors, York and Queen Margaret. Through these happenings the country had been brought to the edge of chaos. In the third part, Shakespeare shows us chaos itself, the full prevalence of civil war, the perpetration of one horrible deed after another. In the second part there had remained some chivalric feeling [...] But in the third part all the decencies of chivalric warfare are abandoned.&quot;

====Family conflict and family dissolution====
Just as revenge gives way to a desire for power, so too does national political conflict give way to a petty interfamily feud. For example, the play opens in the aftermath of the First Battle of St Albans (1455), and immediately dramatises the agreement between Henry and York that the House of Lancaster will cede the throne to the House of York upon Henry&#x27;s death. However, in reality, this agreement was brought about not by the First Battle of St Albans but by the Battle of Northampton in 1460, which Shakespeare chose not to dramatise. Furthermore, the legal settlement whereby Henry agreed to relinquish the crown to the House of York upon his death came about due to lengthy parliamentary debate, not a personal agreement between Henry and York, as it is depicted in the play. As such, a wide-ranging political debate spanning five years, and involving virtually every peer in the country is telescoped in the play to an immediate agreement between two men, thus illustrating the personal nature of the conflict.

Another example of a character who also personalises the national conflict and turns it from a political struggle into a personal quest is Clifford, whose desire for revenge for the death of his father seems to be his only reason for fighting. Clifford seems unconcerned with Henry&#x27;s ability to lead the country, and his desire for personal vengeance seems to outweigh any sense he has of aiding the House of Lancaster because he believes it to be the right thing to do. Similarly, Warwick&#x27;s later actions in the play, as he himself acknowledges, have nothing to do with ensuring Henry remain king, but are based wholly on his personal feelings towards Edward; he is more concerned with bringing down the House of York than elevating the House of Lancaster. As such, &quot;the York-Warwick alliance degenerates into an inter-family feud, even more petty in its tit-for-tat predictability than York and Lancaster&#x27;s squabbles.&quot; Although the conflicts depicted in the play &quot;are&quot; national, they are treated by many of the characters as personal quarrels.

This concentration on the personal and familial aspects of the war leads to another major theme in the play; the dissolution of Family. Throughout the play, family ties are shown to be fragile and constantly under threat. The first breach of familial bonds comes when Henry agrees to pass the crown to the House of York after his death. This disinherits his son and renders the crown a piece of transferable property, rather than a symbol of dynastic heritage or monarchic succession. All of Henry&#x27;s followers are aghast at this decision, none more so than Margaret, who exclaims,
Ah, wretched man, would I had died a maid
And never seen thee, never borne thee son,
Seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father.
Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?
Hadst thou but loved him half so well as I,
Or felt that pain which I did for him once,
Or nourished him as I did with my blood,
Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there,
Rather than have made that savage Duke thine heir
And disinherited thine only son.
:::::::(1.1217–226)
Margaret is not alone in her efforts to convince Henry that his decision is wrong. Clifford also attempts to persuade him, arguing that fathers who do not pass on their successes to their sons are unnatural;
Ambitious York, did level at thy crown,
Thou smiling, while he knit his angry brows.
He but a duke would have his son a king
And raise his issue like a loving sire,
Thou being a king, blessed with a goodly son
Didst yield consent to disinherit him,
Which argued thee a most unloving father.
Unreasonable creatures feed their young,
And though man&#x27;s face be fearful to their eyes,
Yet in protection of their tender ones,
Who hath not seen them, even with those wings
Which sometime they have used with fearful flight,
Make war with him that climbed unto their nest,
Offering their own lives in their young&#x27;s defence?
For shame, my liege, make them your precedent.
Were it not pity that this goodly boy
Should lose his birth-right by his father&#x27;s fault,
And long hereafter say unto his child,
&#x27;What my great-grandfather and grandsire got,
My careless father fondly gave away&#x27;?
Ah what a shame were this! Look on the boy,
And let his manly face, which promiseth
Successful fortune, steel thy melting heart,
To hold thine own and leave thine own with him.
:::::::(2.2.19–42)
Henry however, disagrees with Clifford, arguing that passing on the burden of kingship is not necessarily the natural thing for a father to do, as it brings no reward when that title was unlawfully obtained in the first place (&quot;things ill got, had ever bad success&quot;: Henry is referring to the deposition and assassination of Richard II by his own grandfather, Henry IV). By disinheriting his son, Henry seems to think he is protecting the Prince, ensuring that he will never suffer the hardships he himself experienced when he was left a usurped inheritance by his own father (&quot;I&#x27;ll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind and would my father had left me no more&quot;);
But Clifford tell me, didst thou never hear
That things ill got, had ever bad success?
And happy always was it for that son
Whose father for his hoarding went to hell?
I&#x27;ll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind,
And would my father had left me no more,
For all the rest is held at such a rate
As brings a thousandfold more care to keep
Then in possession any jot of pleasure.
:::::::(2.2.45–53)
As such, while Margaret and Clifford argue that Henry has destroyed his family in his deal with York, Henry himself seems to feel that he has done his offspring a favour and prevented him from experiencing future suffering.

York&#x27;s deal with Henry doesn&#x27;t just have implications for Henry&#x27;s family however, it also has implications for York&#x27;s. York willingly sacrifices personal glory for the sake of his heirs, electing not to become King himself with the promise that his sons and grandsons will be kings instead. However, almost immediately after his deal with Henry, York&#x27;s family is torn apart. Act 1, Scene 2 symbolically begins with Edward and Richard arguing; &quot;No quarrel but a slight contention&quot; (l.6). Act 1, Scene 3 then depicts the murder of York&#x27;s youngest son, whilst in Act 1, Scene 4, York himself is tortured and murdered, with the knowledge that Rutland is already dead. In this sense, York functions as a symbolic character insofar as &quot;the personal losses underlining York&#x27;s political &#x27;tragedy&#x27; [magnify] the play&#x27;s theme of civil war&#x27;s destruction of family relationships.&quot;
The dissolution of the House of York however doesn&#x27;t end with the death of York himself. Later, in Act 3, Scene 2, Richard further dissolves the family by revealing his ambition to usurp Edward&#x27;s throne, and thereby disinherit Edward&#x27;s children, his own nephews; &quot;Ay, Edward, use women honourably./Would he were wasted, marrow, bones, and all,/That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring/To cross me from the golden time I look for&quot; (ll.124–127). After murdering Henry, Richard then outlines his plan to bring this about, vowing to turn Edward against Clarence:
Clarence beware, thou keep&#x27;st me from the light,
But I will sort a pitchy day for thee,
For I will buzz abroad such prophecies
That Edward shall be fearful of his life,
And then to purge his fear, I&#x27;ll be thy death. (5.6.84–88)
In this ambition, Richard proves successful, utterly destroying his own family in the process.
Also important to the theme of family dissolution is Act 2, Scene 5, where a father unwittingly kills his son, and a son unwittingly kills his father. Stuart Hampton-Reeves argues that this scene is a symbolic one referring to the conscription debate in England during the 1580s and 1590s. The Dutch Revolt against the Spanish Empire had begun in 1568, and although England and France were both supporting the Dutch, they had officially remained neutral for fear of angering the Spanish. However, in 1585, Elizabeth I signed the Treaty of Nonsuch, which officially brought England into the conflict, with the promise of 6,500 troops (which was then changed to 8,000 troops) for the Dutch. As such, to supply these troops, mobilisation was needed and the government thus replaced the traditional feudal system, whereby local nobles raised armies from among their own tenantry, with national conscription. This was not without controversy, and the incident involving the fathers and sons allude to both practices; the feudal system and the national system. Upon discovering he has killed his father, the son laments &quot;From London by the king was I pressed forth./My father, being the Earl of Warwick&#x27;s man,/Came on the part of York, pressed by his master&quot; (2.5.64–66). The son had left the family home and travelled to London, where he had been conscripted into the king&#x27;s army upon the outbreak of war. The father had stayed at home and had been compelled to join the army of the local noble (i.e. Warwick). Thus they ended up on opposite sides in the conflict, as regional stability gives way to national discord and social breakdown, and the war begins quite literally to tear families apart.

==Performance==
After the original 1592 performances, the complete text of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; seems to have been very rarely acted. The first definite performance in England after Shakespeare&#x27;s day did not occur until 1906, when F. R. Benson presented the play at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in a production of Shakespeare&#x27;s two tetralogies, performed over eight nights. As far as can be ascertained, this was not only the first performance of the octology, but was also the first definite performance of both the tetralogy and the trilogy. Benson himself played Henry and his wife, Constance Benson, played Margaret.

In 1952, Douglas Seale directed a production of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre, following a successful production of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; in 1951. &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; would follow in 1953. All three plays starred Paul Daneman as Henry and Rosalind Boxall as Margaret, with &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; featuring Alan Bridges as Edward and Edgar Wreford as Richard. Although little was removed from the text, it did end differently from the written play. After Edward has spoken his last lines, everyone leaves the stage except Richard, who walks towards the throne, then turns and looks out to the audience, speaking the first thirty lines of his opening speech from &quot;Richard III&quot; (from &quot;Now is the winter of our discontent&quot; to &quot;I am determin&#x27;d to prove a villain&quot;), at which point the curtain falls. Additionally, in this production, Boxall as Margaret fully participated in the Battle of Tewkesbury, which was considered a bold move at the time.
A production which made much of its unedited status came in 1977, at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, where Terry Hands presented all three &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays with Alan Howard as Henry and Helen Mirren as Margaret. Although the production was only moderately successful at the box office, it was critically lauded at the time for Alan Howard&#x27;s unique portrayal of Henry. Howard adopted historical details concerning the real Henry&#x27;s madness into his performance, presenting the character as constantly on the brink of a mental and emotional breakdown. Possibly as a reaction to a recent adaptation of the trilogy under the general title &quot;Wars of the Roses&quot;, which was strongly political, Hands attempted to ensure his own production was entirely apolitical; &quot;&quot;Wars of the Roses&quot; was a study in power politics: its central image was the conference table, and Warwick, the scheming king-maker, was the central figure. But that&#x27;s not Shakespeare. Shakespeare goes far beyond politics. Politics is a very shallow science.&quot; Aside from Howard and Mirren, the production starred Alfred Lynch as Edward and Anton Lesser as Richard.

In 1994, Katie Mitchell directed the play as a stand-alone piece for the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) at The Other Place theatre in Stratford, under the title &quot;Henry VI: The Battle for the Throne&quot;. Starring Jonathan Firth as Henry, Ruth Mitchell as Margaret, Tom Smith as Richard and Lloyd Owen as Edward, the play added dialogue (primarily anti-war material) from &quot;Gorboduc&quot;, &quot;Richard II&quot;, &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; and &quot;Richard III&quot;. Mitchell cut all on-stage violence, resulting in York, Rutland, Prince Edward and Henry all being killed off-stage. The introduction of the head of Somerset was also removed, with the play beginning instead at line 25, &quot;This is the palace of the fearful king.&quot; Also removed was much of Margaret&#x27;s speech to rouse her army prior to Tewkesbury.

Under the direction of Michael Boyd, the play was presented at the Swan Theatre in Stratford in 2000, with David Oyelowo as Henry, Fiona Bell as Margaret, Tom Beard as Edward and Aidan McArdle as Richard. The play was presented with the other five history plays (&quot;Richard II&quot;, &quot;1 Henry IV&quot;, &quot;2 Henry IV&quot;, &quot;Henry V&quot; and &quot;Richard III&quot;) to form a complete eight-part history cycle under the general title &quot;This England: The Histories&quot; (the first time the RSC had ever attempted to stage the eight plays as one sequence). &quot;This England: The Histories&quot; was revived in 2006, as part of the &quot;Complete Works&quot; festival at the Courtyard Theatre, with the &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays again directed by Boyd, and starring Chuk Iwuji as Henry, Katy Stephens as Margaret, Forbes Masson as Edward and Jonathan Slinger as Richard. When the &quot;Complete Works&quot; wrapped in March 2007, the history plays remained on stage, under the shorter title &quot;The Histories&quot;, as part of a two-year thirty-four actor ensemble production. &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; was performed under the title &quot;Henry VI, Part 3: The Chaos&quot;. At the end of the two-year programme, the entire octology was performed over a four-day period under the title &quot;The Glorious Moment&quot;; &quot;Richard II&quot; was staged on a Thursday evening, followed by the two &quot;Henry IV&quot; plays on Friday afternoon and evening, the three &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays on Saturday (two afternoon performances and one evening performance), and &quot;Richard III&quot; on Sunday evening.

Boyd&#x27;s production garnered much attention at the time because of his interpolations and additions to the text. Boyd introduced a new character into the trilogy. Called The Keeper, the character never speaks, but upon the death of each major character, the Keeper (played by Edward Clayton in 2000, and by Anthony Bunsee in 2006/2007), wearing all red, would walk onto stage and approach the body. The actor playing the body would then stand up and allow himself to be led off-stage by the figure. The production was also particularly noted for its realistic violence. According to Robert Gore-Langton of the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, in his review of the original 2000 production, &quot;blood from a severed arm sprayed over my lap. A human liver slopped to the floor by my feet. An eyeball scudded past, then a tongue.&quot;

In 2012, the trilogy was staged at Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe as part of the Globe to Globe Festival, with each play performed by a different Balkans based company and offered as a commentary on the recent history of violence in that region. &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; was staged by the Macedonian company National Theatre Bitola, directed by John Blondell, and starring Petar Gorko as Henry, Gabriela Petrusevska as Margaret, Nikolche Projchevski as Edward and Martin Mirchevski as Richard. In 2013, Nick Bagnall directed another production of the trilogy at the Globe. All three plays were performed each day, beginning at midday, under the overall title &quot;Henry VI: Three Plays&quot;. &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; was performed under the title &quot;Henry VI: The True Tragedy of the Duke of York&quot;. Each of the plays was edited down to two hours, and the entire trilogy was performed with a cast of fourteen actors. On several specific dates, the plays were performed at the actual locations where some of the original events took place and streamed live to the theatre; &quot;battlefield productions&quot; were staged at Towton (Battle of Towton from &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;), Tewkesbury (Battle of Tewkesbury from &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;), St Albans Cathedral (First Battle of St Albans from &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; and Second Battle of St Albans from &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;), and Monken Hadley Common (Battle of Barnet from &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;). The production starred Graham Butler as Henry, Mary Doherty as Margaret, Patrick Myles as Edward and Simon Harrison as Richard.

Outside the UK, the first major American performance was in 1935 at the Pasadena Playhouse in California, directed by Gilmore Brown, as part of a production of all ten Shakespearean histories (the two tetralogies, preceded by &quot;King John&quot; and proceeded by &quot;Henry VIII&quot;). In 2010 in New York City, the independent theatre company Wide Eyed Productions, in association with Columbia University, mounted a stand-alone production of the play at the East 13th Street Theatre (home of Classic Stage Company). The production was directed by Adam Marple and featured Nat Cassidy as Henry, Candace Thompson as Margaret, Sky Seals as Edward and Ben Newman as Richard. It was noted as being a rare opportunity to see the play on its own and was well received – particularly for its staging of the conclusion, in which Henry&#x27;s corpse remained onstage, doused in a steady rain of blood, throughout Edward IV&#x27;s final scene, after which a naked and feral Richard bolts onstage and delivers the opening lines of &quot;Richard III&quot;, before literally eating the throne. The play also featured a huge portrait of Henry V wallpapered to the upstage wall that was steadily torn apart over the course of the play.

In Europe, unedited stagings of the play took place at the Weimar Court Theatre in 1857. Directed by Franz von Dingelstedt, it was performed as the seventh part of the octology, with all eight plays staged over a ten-day period. A major production was staged at the Burgtheater in Vienna in 1873. Jocza Savits directed a production of the tetralogy at the Munich Court Theatre in 1889 and again in 1906. In 1927, Saladin Schmitt presented the unedited octology at the Municipal Theatre in Bochum. Denis Llorca staged the tetralogy as one twelve-hour piece in Carcassonne in 1978 and in Créteil in 1979. In 1999, director Ruediger Burbach presented &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; and &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; at the Zurich Playhouse. This production was unique insofar as a woman (Katharina Schmoelzer) played Henry. Margaret was played by Katharina von Bock.

==Adaptations==

===Theatrical===
Evidence for the first adaptation of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; is found during the Restoration, when, in 1681, John Crowne created a two-part play entitled &quot;Henry the Sixth, The First Part&quot; and &quot;The Misery of Civil War&quot;. &quot;Henry&quot; comprised Acts 1–3 of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; focusing on the death of Gloucester, &quot;Misery&quot; adapted the last two acts of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; and much of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;. Writing at the time of Popish Plot, Crowne, who was a devout royalist, used his adaptation to warn about the danger of allowing England to descend into another civil war, which would be the case should the Whig party rise to power. Changes to the text include a new, albeit silent scene just prior to the Battle of Wakefield where York embraces Rutland before heading out to fight; an extension of the courtship between Edward and Lady Grey, and the edition of two subplots; one concerning a mistress of Edward&#x27;s whom he accidentally kills in battle (an allusion to Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;Philaster&quot;), the other involving an attempt by Warwick to seduce Lady Grey after her husband&#x27;s death at the Second Battle of St. Albans (this is later used as a rationale for why Warwick turns against Edward). Also worth noting is that the role of Margaret in &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; was removed almost entirely, reducing her to two scenes; the death of York and the death of Prince Edward.

&quot;3 Henry VI&quot; was also partly incorporated into Colley Cibber&#x27;s &quot;The Tragical History of King Richard the Third, containing the Distresses and Death of King Henry the Sixth&quot; (1699), one of the most successful Shakespearean adaptations of all time. The play was half Shakespeare, half new material. &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; was used as the source for Act 1, which dramatised Henry&#x27;s lamentation about the burdens of Kingship (2.5), the battle of Tewkesbury (Act 5 – although Margaret&#x27;s speech in Act 5, Scene 1 was replaced with Henry V&#x27;s &quot;once more unto the breach&quot; speech from &quot;Henry V&quot; and is spoken by Warwick) and Richard&#x27;s murder of Henry in the tower (5.6). Richard&#x27;s soliloquy in Act 2 of &quot;Tragical History&quot; was also based upon his soliloquy in Act 3, Scene 2 of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;.

Colley&#x27;s son, Theophilus Cibber wrote his own adaptation, &quot;King Henry VI: A Tragedy&quot; in 1723, using Act 5 of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; and Act 1 and 2 of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;. Performed at Drury Lane, Colley appeared as Winchester. As had Crowne, Cibber created a new scene involving Rutland; after the death of York, he and Rutland are laid side by side on the battlefield.

In 1817, Edmund Kean appeared in J.H. Merivale&#x27;s &quot;Richard Duke of York; or the Contention of York and Lancaster&quot;, which used material from all three &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays, but removed everything not directly related to York; the play ended with his death, which occurs in Act 1, Scene 4 of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;. Material from &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; included the opening few scenes involving York taking the throne from Henry, preparing for battle, and then the battle itself.

Following Merivale&#x27;s example, Robert Atkins adapted all three plays into a single piece for a performance at The Old Vic in 1923 as part of the celebrations for the tercentenary of the &quot;First Folio&quot;. Guy Martineau played Henry and Esther Whitehouse played Margaret. Atkins himself played Richard.
The success of the 1951–1953 Douglas Seale stand-alone productions of each of the individual plays in Birmingham prompted him to present the three plays together at the Old Vic in 1957 under the general title &quot;The Wars of the Roses&quot;. Barry Jackson adapted the text, altering the trilogy into a two-part play; &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; and &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; were combined (with almost all of &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; eliminated) and &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; was edited down, with most of Act 4 removed, thus reducing the importance of Edward in the overall play. Seale again directed, with Paul Daneman again appearing as Henry, Alan Bridges as Edward and Edgar Wreford as Richard, alongside Barbara Jefford as Margaret. As with Seale&#x27;s 1953 Birmingham production, the end of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; was altered to include the opening of &quot;Richard III&quot;.

The production which is usually credited with establishing the reputation of the play in the modern theatre is John Barton and Peter Hall&#x27;s 1963/1964 RSC production of the tetralogy, adapted into a three-part series, under the general title &quot;The Wars of the Roses&quot;, at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre. The first play (entitled simply &quot;Henry VI&quot;) featured a much shortened version of &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; and half of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; (up to the death of Cardinal Beaufort). The second play (entitled &quot;Edward IV&quot;) featured the second half of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; and a shortened version of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, which was then followed by a shortened version of &quot;Richard III&quot; as the third play. In all, 1,450 lines written by Barton were added to 6,000 lines of original Shakespearean material, with a total of 12,350 lines removed. The production starred David Warner as Henry, Peggy Ashcroft as Margaret, Roy Dotrice as Edward and Ian Holm as Richard. Barton and Hall were both especially concerned that the plays reflect the contemporary political environment, with the civil chaos and breakdown of society depicted in the plays mirrored in the contemporary &quot;milieu&quot;, by events such as the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961, the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 and the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963. Hall allowed these events to reflect themselves in the production, arguing that &quot;we live among war, race riots, revolutions, assassinations, and the imminent threat of extinction. The theatre is, therefore, examining fundamentals in staging the &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays.&quot; They were also influenced by politically focused literary theory of the time; both had attended the 1956 London visit of Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s Berliner Ensemble, both were subscribers to Antonin Artaud&#x27;s theory of &quot;Theatre of Cruelty&quot;, and Hall had read an English translation of Jan Kott&#x27;s influential &quot;Shakespeare Our Contemporary&quot; in 1964 prior to its publication in Britain. Both Barton and Hall were also supporters of E.M.W. Tillyard&#x27;s 1944 book &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s History Plays&quot;, which was still a hugely influential text in Shakespearian scholarship, especially in terms of its argument that Shakespeare in the tetralogy was advancing the Tudor myth.

Another major adaptation was staged in 1986 by the English Shakespeare Company, under the direction of Michael Bogdanov. This touring production opened at the Old Vic, and subsequently toured for two years, performing at, amongst other places, the Panasonic Globe Theatre in Tokyo, Japan (as the inaugural play of the arena), the Festival dei Due Mondi in Spoleto, Italy and at the Adelaide Festival in Adelaide, Australia. Following the structure established by Barton and Hall, Bogdanov combined &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; and the first half of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; into one play, and the second half of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; and &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; into another, using the same titles as Barton (&quot;Henry VI&quot; and &quot;The Rise of Edward IV&quot;). Also like Barton and Hall, Bogdanov concentrated on political issues, although he made them far more overt than had his predecessors. For example, played by June Watson, Margaret was closely modelled after the British Prime Minister at the time, Margaret Thatcher, even to the point of having similar clothes and hair. Likewise, Paul Brennan&#x27;s Henry was modelled after the King Edward VIII, prior to his abdication. Bogdanov also employed frequent anachronisms and contemporary visual registers, in an effort to show the relevance of the politics in the fifteenth century to the contemporary period. The production was noted for its pessimism as regards contemporary British politics, with some critics feeling the political resonances were too heavy handed. However, the series was a huge box office success. Alongside Watson and Brennan, the play starred Philip Bowen as Edward and Andrew Jarvis as Richard.

Another adaptation of the tetralogy by the Royal Shakespeare Company followed in 1988, performed at the Barbican. Adapted by Charles Wood and directed by Adrian Noble, the Barton/Hall structure was again followed, reducing the trilogy to two plays by dividing &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; in the middle. The resulting trilogy was entitled &quot;The Plantagenets&quot;, with the individual plays entitled &quot;Henry VI&quot;, &quot;The Rise of Edward IV&quot; and &quot;Richard III, His Death&quot;. Starring Ralph Fiennes as Henry, Penny Downie as Margaret, Ken Bones as Edward and Anton Lesser as Richard, the production was extremely successful with both audiences and critics. This play ended with the line &quot;Now is the winter of our discontent;&quot; the opening line from &quot;Richard III&quot;.

Michael Bogdanov and the English Shakespeare Company presented a different adaptation at the Swansea Grand Theatre in 1991, using the same cast as on the touring production. All eight plays from the history cycle were presented over a seven night period, with each play receiving one performance only, and with only twenty-eight actors portraying the nearly five hundred roles. Whilst the other five plays in the cycle were unadapted, the &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays were combined into two, using the Barton/Hall structure, with the first was named &quot;The House of Lancaster&quot; and the second, &quot;The House of York&quot;.

In 2000, Edward Hall presented the trilogy as a two-part series at the Watermill Theatre in Newbury. Hall followed the Jackson/Seale structure, combining &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; and &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; into one play which all but eliminated &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; and following this with an edited version of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;. This production was noted for how it handled the violence of the play. The set was designed to look like an abattoir, but rather than attempt to present the violence realistically (as most productions do), Hall went in the other direction; presenting the violence symbolically. Whenever a character was decapitated or killed, a red cabbage was sliced up whilst the actor mimed the death beside it.

In 2001, Tom Markus directed an adaptation of the tetralogy at the Colorado Shakespeare Festival. Condensing all fours plays into one, Markus named the play &quot;Queen Margaret&quot;, doing much the same with the character of Margaret as Merivale had done with York. Margaret was played by Gloria Biegler, Henry by Richard Haratine, Edward by John Jurcheck and Richard by Chip Persons.
Another unusual 2001 adaptation of the tetralogy was entitled &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Rugby Wars&quot;. Written by Matt Toner and Chris Coculuzzi, and directed by Coculuzzi, the play was acted by the Upstart Crow Theatre Group and staged outdoors at the Robert Street Playing Field as part of the Toronto Fringe Festival. Presented as if it were a live rugby match between York and Lancaster, the &#x27;play&#x27; featured commentary from Falstaff (Stephen Flett), which was broadcast live for the audience. The &#x27;match&#x27; itself was refereed by &#x27;Bill Shakespeare&#x27; (played by Coculuzzi), and the actors (whose characters names all appeared on their jerseys) had microphones attached and would recite dialogue from all four plays at key moments.

In 2002, Leon Rubin presented the tetralogy as a trilogy at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Ontario. Using the Barton/Hall method of combining &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; with the first half of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;, and the second half of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; with &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, the plays were renamed &quot;Henry VI: Revenge in France&quot; and &quot;Henry VI: Revolt in England&quot;. Michael Thierry played Henry, Seana McKenna played Margaret, Rami Posner played Edward and Thom Marriott played Richard.

Also in 2002, Edward Hall and the Propeller Company presented a one-play all-male cast modern dress adaptation of the trilogy at the Watermill Theatre. Under the title &quot;Rose Rage&quot;, Hall used a cast of only thirteen actors to portray the nearly one hundred and fifty speaking roles in the four-hour production, thus necessitating doubling and tripling of parts. Although a new adaptation, this production followed the Jackson/Seale method of eliminating almost all of &quot;1 Henry VI&quot;. The original cast included Jonathan McGuinness as Henry, Robert Hands as Margaret, Tim Treloar as Edward and Richard Clothier as Richard. After a successful run at the Haymarket, the play moved to the Chicago Shakespeare Theater. The American cast included Carman Lacivita as Henry, Scott Parkinson as Margaret, Fletcher McTaggart as Edward and Bruce A. Young as Richard.

Outside England, a major European adaptation of the tetralogy took place in 1864 in Weimar under the direction of Franz von Dingelstedt, who, seven years previously had staged the play unedited. Dingelstedt turned the trilogy into a two-parter under the general name &quot;Die weisse rose&quot;. The first play was called &quot;Haus Lancaster&quot;, the second &quot;Haus York&quot;. This adaptation was unique insofar as both plays were created by combining material from all three &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays. Following this structure, Alfred von Walzogen also produced a two-part play in 1875, under the general title &quot;Edward IV&quot;. Another European adaptation was in 1965 at the Teatro Piccolo in Milan. Directed by Giorgio Strehler it went under the title &quot;Il gioco del potenti&quot; (&quot;The Play of the Mighty&quot;). Using Barton and Hall&#x27;s structure, Strehler also added several characters, including a Chorus, who used monologues from &quot;Richard II&quot;, both parts of &quot;Henry IV&quot;, &quot;Henry V&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot; and &quot;Timon of Athens&quot;, and two gravediggers called Bevis and Holland (after the names of two of Cade&#x27;s rebels in the Folio text of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;), who commented (with dialogue written by Strehler himself) on each of the major characters as they set about burying them. A major German adaptation was Peter Palitzsch&#x27;s two-part adaptation of the trilogy as &quot;Der krieg der rosen&quot; in 1967 at the Stuttgart State Theatre. Condensing the three plays into two, &quot;Heinrich VI&quot; and &quot;Eduard IV&quot;, Palitzsch&#x27;s adaptation concluded with the opening monologue from &quot;Richard III&quot;.

===Film===
Although &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; itself has never been adapted directly for the cinema, extracts from it have been used in many of the cinematic adaptations of &quot;Richard III&quot;.

The first such adaptation was 1911 twenty-two-minute silent version of &quot;Richard III&quot;, directed by and starring F.R. Benson. Filmed as part of a series intended by Benson to promote the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre at Stratford, the piece was pure filmed theatre, with each scene shot on-stage in a single take by an unmoving camera. Each single shot scene is prefaced by a scene-setting intertitle and a brief quotation from the text. Of thirteen scenes in total, the first two are taken from &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;; the murder of Prince Edward and the banishment of Queen Margaret (Act 5, Scene 5) and Richard&#x27;s murder of Henry in the Tower (Act 5, Scene 6). Similarly, the 1912 American adaptation, directed by James Keane and André Calmettes, and starring Frederick Warde as Richard, opened with the same two scenes; the murder of Prince Edward and the murder of Henry VI.

The play was also used in one of the earliest sound films; the 1929 John G. Adolfi movie &quot;The Show of Shows&quot;; a revue-style production featuring extracts from numerous plays, musicals and novels. Richard&#x27;s soliloquy from Act 3, Scene 2 was used in the film, recited by John Barrymore (although Barrymore incorrectly attributes the speech to &quot;1 Henry VI&quot;), who delivers the speech after the opening dialogue of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; concerning Somerset&#x27;s head. Barrymore had recently starred in a hugely successful five-hour production of &quot;Richard III&quot; on Broadway, and this speech had been singled out by critics as the best in the entire production. As such, when offered the chance to perform on film, Barrymore chose to reproduce it. Film critics proved just as impressed with the speech as had theatrical critics, and it was generally regarded as the finest moment of the film.

Extracts from the play were also used in Laurence Olivier&#x27;s 1955 filmic adaptation of &quot;Richard III&quot;, starring Olivier himself as Richard, Cedric Hardwicke as Edward, John Gielgud as George and Mary Kerridge as Queen Elizabeth. The film begins with the coronation of Edward IV, which happens between 3.1 and 3.2 of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, and then moves into a shortened version of Act 5, Scene 7; the final scene from &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;. The opening lines of the film are Edward&#x27;s &quot;Once more we sit in England&#x27;s royal throne,/Repurchased with the blood of enemies./Come hither Bess, and let me kiss my boy./Young Ned, for thee, thine uncles and myself/Have in our armours watched the winter&#x27;s night,/Went all afoot in summer&#x27;s scalding heat,/That thou mightst repossess the crown in peace/And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain&quot; (this is a truncated version of ll. 1–20). Apart from the omission of some lines, the most noticeable departure from the text of 5.7 is the inclusion of two characters who do not appear in the play; the Duke of Buckingham (played by Ralph Richardson) and Jane Shore (played by Pamela Brown). Buckingham is a major character throughout &quot;Richard III&quot;, where he is Richard&#x27;s closest ally for a time. Jane Shore is mentioned several times in &quot;Richard III&quot;, and although she never features as a character, she is often included in productions of the play. After the conclusion of Act 5, Scene 7 from &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, the film then moves on to the opening soliloquy from Act 1, Scene 1 of &quot;Richard III&quot;. However, after twenty-three lines, it then moves back to &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, quoting from Richard&#x27;s soliloquy in Act 3, Scene 2;
Why, love forswore me in my mother&#x27;s womb,
And for I should not deal in her soft laws,
She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe
To shrink mine arm up like a withered shrub,
To make an envious mountain on my back
Where sits deformity to mock my body,
To shape my legs of an unequal size,
To disproportion me in every part
Like to a chaos, or an unlicked bear-whelp
That carries no impression like the dam.
:::::::(ll.153–162)
At this point, the film returns to lines twenty-four to twenty-eight of &quot;Richard III&quot;, before again returning to Act 3, Scene 2 of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;;
Then since this earth affords no joy to me
But to command, to check, to o&#x27;erbear such
As are of better person than myself,
I&#x27;ll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,
And, whiles I live, t&#x27;account this world but hell, 
Until my misshaped trunk that bears this head
Be round impaled with a glorious crown.
And yet I know not how to get the crown,
For many lives stand between me and home,
And I, like one lost in a thorny wood,
That rents the thorns and is rent with the thorns,
Seeking a way and straying from the way,
Not knowing how to find the open air,
But toiling desperately to find it out,
Torment myself to catch the English crown,
And from that torment I will free myself,
Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.
Why, I can smile, and murder while I smile,
And cry, &#x27;content&#x27; to that which grieves my heart,
And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,
And frame my face to all occasions.
I&#x27;ll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall,
I&#x27;ll slay more gazers than the basilisk;
I&#x27;ll play the orator as well as Nestor,
Deceive more slyly than Ulysses could,
And, like a Sinon, take another Troy.
I can add colours to the chameleon,
Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,
And set the murd&#x27;rous Machiavel to school 
Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?
Tut! were it further off, I&#x27;ll pluck it down. 
::::::: (ll.165–195)
The film then moves into Act 1, Scene 2 of &quot;Richard III&quot;. At the conclusion of Act 1, Scene 2, it then returns to &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; a final time, to Richard&#x27;s soliloquy after murdering Henry in Act 5, Scene 6;
Clarence beware, thou keep&#x27;st me from the light,
But I will sort a pitchy day for thee,
For I will buzz abroad such prophecies
That Edward shall be fearful of his life,
And then to purge his fear, I&#x27;ll be thy death.
::::::: (ll. 84–88)
Richard Loncraine&#x27;s 1995 filmic adaptation of Richard Eyre&#x27;s 1990 stage production of &quot;Richard III&quot; features considerably less material from &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; than had Olivier&#x27;s film. Starring Ian McKellen as Richard (reprising his role from the stage production), John Wood as Edward, Nigel Hawthorne as George and Annette Bening as Queen Elizabeth, the film begins prior to the Battle of Tewkesbury, with Henry VI (portrayed by Edward Jewesbury) still in power. The opening scene depicts Henry and his son Edward (played by Christopher Bowen) preparing for the forthcoming battle. However, a surprise attack is launched on their headquarters by Richard, and both are killed. This scene is without dialogue. The last line of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; is also used in the film; Edward&#x27;s &quot;For here I hope begins our lasting joy&quot; appears as a subtitle after the coronation of Edward and is altered to read &quot;And now, they hope, begins their lasting joy&quot;, with &quot;they&quot; referring to the House of York. The film then moves on to the coronation of Edward IV (again without dialogue), before Richard delivers the opening speech of &quot;Richard III&quot; as an after-dinner toast to the new king. Like Olivier&#x27;s film, Loncraine includes several characters in the coronation scene who are not present in the text of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;; Buckingham (played by Jim Broadbent), Richmond (played by Dominic West) and Elizabeth Plantagenet (played by Kate Steavenson-Payne). Richmond will later go on to be Henry VII, and Elizabeth (King Edward&#x27;s daughter) will become his queen. As with Jane Shore, Elizabeth is mentioned several times in &quot;Richard III&quot;, although she never appears in the text. Loncraine&#x27;s film also used a line from &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; in its poster campaign – &quot;I can smile and murder whiles I smile&quot; (3.2.182), although &quot;whiles&quot; was changed to &quot;while.&quot; This line is also included in the film – after Richard concludes his opening speech to Edward, he enters the men&#x27;s room and continues in soliloquy form to line twenty-seven of &quot;Richard III&quot; before then referring back to the earlier play &quot;Why, I can smile and murder while I smile/And wet my cheeks with artificial tears/And frame my face to all occasions&quot; (ll. 182–185). The film then moves on to the arrest of George.

===Television===
The first television adaptation of the play was in 1960 when the BBC produced a serial entitled &quot;An Age of Kings&quot;. The show comprised fifteen sixty- and seventy-five-minute episodes which adapted all eight of Shakespeare&#x27;s sequential history plays. Directed by Michael Hayes and produced by Peter Dews, with a script by Eric Crozier, the production featured Terry Scully as Henry, Mary Morris as Margaret, Julian Glover as Edward and Paul Daneman as Richard. The twelfth episode, &quot;The Morning&#x27;s War&quot; covers Acts 1, 2 and Act 3, Scenes 1 and 2, concluding with Richard&#x27;s soliloquy wherein he vows to attain the crown. The thirteenth episode, &quot;The Sun in Splendour&quot;, presents everything from Act 3, Scene 3 onwards, beginning with Margaret&#x27;s visit to Louis XI in France. With each episode running one hour, a great deal of text was necessarily removed, but aside from truncation, only minor alterations were made to the original. For example, in &quot;The Morning&#x27;s War&quot;, the character of Edmund, Earl of Rutland is played by an adult actor, whereas in the text, he is a child and Margaret is present during the murder of Rutland, and we see her wipe his blood on the handkerschief which she later gives to York. Additionally, Richard fights and kills Clifford during the Battle of Towton. In the text, they fight, but Clifford flees and is mortally wounded off-stage when hit by an arrow. In &quot;The Sun in Splendour&quot;, Edward is rescued from his imprisonment by Richard and Lord Stafford, whereas in the play, he is rescued by Richard, Lord Hastings and William Stanley. Also, the end of the episode differs slightly from the end of the play. After Edward expresses his wish that all conflict has ceased, a large celebration ensues. As the credits role, Richard and George stand to one side, and George almost slips into a barrel of wine, only to be saved by Richard. As George walks away, Richard thinks to himself and then smiles deviously at the camera.

In 1965, BBC 1 broadcast all three plays from John Barton and Peter Hall&#x27;s &quot;The Wars of the Roses&quot; trilogy (&quot;Henry VI&quot;, &quot;The Rise of Edward IV&quot; and &quot;Richard III&quot;) with David Warner as Henry and Peggy Ashcroft as Margaret. Directed for television by Robin Midgley and Michael Hayes, the plays were presented as more than simply filmed theatre, with the core idea being &quot;to recreate theatre production in televisual terms – not merely to observe it, but to get to the heart of it.&quot; Filming was done on the RSC stage, but not during actual performances, thus allowing cameras to get close to the actors, and cameramen with hand-held cameras to shoot battle scenes. Additionally, camera platforms were created around the theatre. In all, twelve cameras were used, allowing the final product to be edited more like a film than a piece of static filmed theatre. Filming was done following the 1964 run of the plays at Stratford-upon-Avon, and took place over an eight-week period, with fifty-two BBC staff working alongside eighty-four RSC staff to bring the project to fruition. In 1966, the production was repeated on BBC 1 where it was re-edited into eleven episodes of fifty minutes each. The fifth episode, &quot;The Fearful King&quot; covered &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; Act 5 (beginning with Henry pardoning Jack Cade&#x27;s followers) and &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; Act 1 and Act 2, Scene 1, concluding with Warwick rallying Edward, Richard and George after their father&#x27;s death. The sixth episode, &quot;The Kingmaker&quot;, presented Act 2, Scene 2 up to Act 3, Scene 3, concluding with Warwick&#x27;s avowal to remove Edward from the throne and restore Henry. The seventh episode, &quot;Edward of York&quot;, presented Act 3, Scene 4 to Act 5, Scene 5 (concluding with the death of Prince Edward). The eight episode, &quot;The Prophetess&quot;, presented the rest of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; (beginning with Richard&#x27;s murder of Henry) as well as &quot;Richard III&quot; Act 1, Scenes 1, 2 and 3 (concluding with Richard sending two murderers to kill George).

Another television version of the play was produced by the BBC in 1982 for their &quot;BBC Television Shakespeare&quot; series, although the episode didn&#x27;t air until 1983. Directed by Jane Howell, the play was presented as the third part of the tetralogy (all four adaptations directed by Howell) with linked casting; Henry was played by Peter Benson, Margaret by Julia Foster, Edward by Brian Protheroe and Richard by Ron Cook. Howell&#x27;s presentation of the complete first historical tetralogy was one of the most lauded achievements of the entire BBC series, and prompted Stanley Wells to argue that the productions were &quot;probably purer than any version given in the theatre since Shakespeare&#x27;s time.&quot; Michael Mannheim was similarly impressed, calling the tetralogy &quot;a fascinating, fast paced and surprisingly tight-knit study in political and national deterioration.&quot;

Inspired by the notion that the political intrigues behind the Wars of the Roses often seemed like playground squabbles, Howell and production designer Oliver Bayldon staged the four plays in a single set resembling a children&#x27;s adventure playground. However, little attempt was made at realism. For example, Bayldon did not disguise the parquet flooring (&quot;it stops the set from literally representing [...] it reminds us we are in a modern television studio&quot;), and in all four productions, the title of the play is displayed within the set itself (on banners in &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; and &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; (where it is visible throughout the entire first scene), on a shroud in &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, and written on a chalkboard by Richard himself in &quot;Richard III&quot;). Many critics felt these set design choices lent the production an air of Brechtian &quot;verfremdungseffekt&quot;. Stanley Wells wrote of the set that it was intended to invite the viewer to &quot;accept the play&#x27;s artificiality of language and action,&quot; Michael Hattaway describes it as &quot;anti-illusionist,&quot; Susan Willis argues that the set allows the productions &quot;to reach theatrically toward the modern world&quot; and Ronald Knowles writes &quot;a major aspect of the set was the subliminal suggestion of childlike anarchy, role-playing, rivalry, game and vandalism, as if all culture were precariously balanced on the shaky foundations of atavistic aggression and power-mad possession.&quot; As the four plays progressed, the set decayed and became more and more dilapidated as social order became more fractious. In the same vein, the costumes became more and more monotone as the plays went on – &quot;The First Part of Henry the Sixt&quot; features brightly coloured costumes which clearly distinguish the various combatants from one another, but by &quot;The Tragedy of Richard III&quot;, everyone fights in similarly coloured dark costumes, with little to differentiate one army from another. The scene where Richard kills Henry has three biblical references carefully worked out by Howell; as Richard drags Henry away, his arms spread out into a crucified position; on the table at which he sat are seen bread and wine, and in the background, an iron crossbar is faintly illuminated against the black stone wall. Graham Holderness saw Howell&#x27;s non-naturalistic production as something of a reaction to the BBC&#x27;s adaptation of the &quot;Henriad&quot; in seasons one and two, which had been directed by David Giles in the traditional and straightforward manner favoured by then series producer Cedric Messina; &quot;where Messina saw the history plays conventionally as orthodox Tudor historiography, and [David Giles] employed dramatic techniques which allow that ideology a free and unhampered passage to the spectator, Jane Howell takes a more complex view of the first tetralogy as, simultaneously, a serious attempt at historical interpretation, and as a drama with a peculiarly modern relevance and contemporary application. The plays, to this director, are not a dramatisation of the Elizabethan World Picture but a sustained interrogation of residual and emergent ideologies in a changing society [...] This awareness of the multiplicity of potential meanings in the play required a decisive and scrupulous avoidance of television or theatrical naturalism: methods of production should operate to open the plays out, rather than close them into the immediately recognisable familiarity of conventional Shakespearean production.&quot;

Although Howell&#x27;s &quot;The Third Part of Henry the Sixt&quot; was based on the folio text rather than the octavo, it departed from that text in a number of places. For example, it opens differently from the play, with the first twenty-four lines absent. Instead it begins with Edward, Richard, Clarence, Warwick and Norfolk hacking down the door of parliament and Warwick proclaiming &quot;This is the palace of the fearful king&quot; (1.1.25). The opening scene also differs from the play insofar as Clarence is present from the start whereas in the play he is only introduced in Act 2, Scene 2 (Clarence was introduced, along with Edward and Richard, in the final scene of the preceding adaptation). As well as the opening twenty-four lines, numerous other lines were cut from almost every scene. Some of the more notable omissions include, in Act 1, Scene 1, York&#x27;s &quot;Stay by me my lords,/And soldiers stay and lodge by me this night&quot; (ll.31–32) is absent, as are all references to Margaret chairing a session of parliament (ll.35–42). Also absent from this scene is some of the dialogue between Warwick and Northumberland as they threaten one another (ll.153–160) and Margaret&#x27;s references to the pains of child birth, and Henry&#x27;s shameful behaviour in disinheriting his son (ll.221–226). Absent from Act 1, Scene 3 is Rutland&#x27;s appeal to Clifford&#x27;s paternal instincts; &quot;Thou hast one son: for his sake pity me,/Lest in revenge thereof, sith God is just,/He be as miserably slain as I&quot; (ll.41–43). In Act 2, Scene 1, all references to Clarence&#x27;s entry into the conflict (l.143; ll.145–147) are absent, as he had already been introduced as a combatant at the end of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;. In Act 2, Scene 2, two lines are missing from Henry&#x27;s rebuke of Clifford&#x27;s accusation that he has been unnatural by disinheriting the Prince; &quot;And happy always was it for that son/Whose father for his hoarding went to hell&quot; (ll.47–48). During the ensuing debate between the Yorkists and the Lancastrians, Richard&#x27;s &quot;Northumberland, I hold thee reverentially&quot; (l.109) is absent. In Act 2, Scene 3, Clarence&#x27;s plans to rouse the army are absent &quot;And call them pillars that will stand to us,/And if we thrive, promise them such rewards/As victors wear at the Olympian games&quot; (ll.51–53). In Act 3, Scene 3, Oxford and Prince Edward&#x27;s speculations as to the contents of the newly arrived letters is absent (ll.167–170), as is Warwick&#x27;s reference to Salisbury&#x27;s death and the incident with his niece, &quot;Did I forget that by the House of York/My father came untimely to his death?/Did I let pass th&#x27;abuse done to my niece&quot; (ll.186–188). All references to Lord Bourbon are also absent from this scene (ll.253–255). In Act 4, Scene 4, the first twelve lines are absent (where Elizabeth reports to Rivers that Edward has been captured).

However, there were also some additions to the text, most noticeably some lines from &quot;True Tragedy&quot;. In Act 1, Scene 1, for example, four lines are added at the beginning of Henry&#x27;s declaration that he would rather see civil war than yield the throne. Between lines 124 and 125, Henry states &quot;Ah Plantagenet, why seekest thou to depose me?/Are we not both Plantagenets by birth?/And from two brothers lineally descent?/Suppose by right and equity thou be king...&quot;. Also in Act 1, Scene 1, a line is inserted between lines 174 and 175. When York asks Henry if he agrees to the truce, Henry replies &quot;Convey the soldiers hence, and then I will.&quot; In Act 2, Scene 6, a line is inserted between lines 7 and 8; &quot;The common people swarm like summerflies.&quot; Most significant however is Act 5, Scene 1, where the entirety of Clarence&#x27;s return to the Lancastrians is taken from &quot;True Tragedy&quot;, which completely replaces the depiction of the scene in &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;. Others changes include the transferral of lines to characters other than those who speak them in the Folio text, particularly in relation to Clarence, who is given numerous lines in the early part of the play. For example, in Act 2, Scene 1, it is Clarence who says Edward&#x27;s &quot;I wonder how our princely father scaped,/Or whether he be scaped away or no/From Clifford and Northumberland&#x27;s pursuit&quot; (ll.1–3). Clarence also speaks Richard&#x27;s &quot;Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun,/Not separated with the racking clouds/But severed in a pale clear-shining sky&quot; (ll.26–28); Edward&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon/Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay&quot; (ll.68–69); and Richard&#x27;s &quot;Great lord of Warwick, if we should recount/Our baleful news, and at each word&#x27;s deliverance/Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told,/The words would add more anguish than the wounds&quot; (ll.96–100). Also worth noting is that Elizabeth&#x27;s son, the Marquess of Dorset, is introduced just after the marriage of Elizabeth and Edward (Act 4, Scene 1). In the text, Dorset doesn&#x27;t appear until &quot;Richard III&quot;.

A notable stylistic technique used in the adaptation is the multiple addresses direct to camera. For example, Henry&#x27;s &quot;I know not what to say, my title&#x27;s weak&quot; (1.1.135), &quot;All will revolt from me, and turn to him&quot; (1.1.152), &quot;And I with grief and sorrow to the court&quot; (1.1.211), and &quot;Revenged may she be on that hateful Duke,/Whose haughty spirit, wing&#x27;d with desire,/Will cost my crown, and like an empty eagle/Tire on the flesh of me and my son&quot; (1.1.267–270); Exeter&#x27;s &quot;And I, I hope, shall reconcile them all&quot; (1.1.274); the entirety of York&#x27;s soliloquy in Act 1, Scene 4; Warwick&#x27;s pause to get his breath during the Battle of Barnet (2.3.1–5); all of Act 2, Scene 5 (including dialogue from Henry, the father and the son) up to the entry of Prince Edward at line 125; all of Henry&#x27;s monologue in Act 3, Scene 1, prior to his arrest (ll.13–54); Richard&#x27;s entire soliloquy in Act 3, Scene 2 (ll.124–195); Margaret&#x27;s &quot;Ay, now begins a second storm to rise,/For this is he that moves both wind and tide&quot; (3.3.47–48); Warwick&#x27;s soliloquy at the end of the Act 3, Scene 3 (ll.257–268); Richard&#x27;s &quot;I hear, yet say not much, but think the more&quot; (4.1.85) and &quot;Not I, my thoughts aim at a further matter:/I stay not for love of Edward but the crown&quot; (141.124–125); Warwick&#x27;s &quot;O unbid spite, is sportful Edward come&quot; (5.1.18); the entirety of Richard&#x27;s soliloquy in Act 5, Scene 6, after killing Henry (ll.61–93) and Richard&#x27;s &quot;To say the truth, so Judas kissed his master/And cried &#x27;All hail&#x27;, whenas he meant all harm&quot; (5.7.33–34).

The play also featured in ITV&#x27;s &quot;Will Shakespeare&quot;, a 1978 six-part (heavily fictionalised) biopic of Shakespeare (Tim Curry), written by John Mortimer. Episode one, &quot;Dead Shepherd&quot;, focuses on Shakespeare&#x27;s apprenticeship to Christopher Marlowe (Ian McShane), during which time he writes the &quot;Henry VI&quot; trilogy. Specifically focused upon is Act 2, Scene 5; the scene of the son killing his father and the father killing his son.
In other languages

In 1964, Austrian channel ORF 2 presented an adaptation of the trilogy by Leopold Lindtberg under the title &quot;Heinrich VI&quot;. The cast list from this production has been lost. In 1969, German channel ZDF presented a filmed version of the first part of Peter Palitzsch&#x27;s 1967 two-part adaptation of the trilogy in Stuttgart, &quot;Heinrich VI: Der Kreig der Rosen 1&quot;. The second part, &quot;Eduard IV: Der Kreig der Rosen 2&quot;, was screened in 1971.

===Radio===
In 1923, extracts from all three &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays were broadcast on BBC Radio, performed by the Cardiff Station Repertory Company as the third episode of a series of programs showcasing Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, entitled &quot;Shakespeare Night&quot;. In 1947, BBC Third Programme aired a one-hundred-and-fifty-minute adaptation of the trilogy as part of their &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Historical Plays&quot; series, a six-part adaptation of the eight sequential history plays, with linked casting. Adapted by Maurice Roy Ridley, &quot;King Henry VI&quot; starred John Byron as Henry, Gladys Young as Margaret, Francis de Wolff as York and Stephen Murray as Richard. In 1952, Third Programme aired an adaptation of the tetralogy by Peter Watts and John Dover Wilson under the general name &quot;The Wars of the Roses&quot;. The tetralogy was adapted into a trilogy but in an unusual way. &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; was simply removed, so the trilogy contained only &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;, &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; and &quot;Richard III&quot;. The reason for this was explained by Dover Wilson, who argued that &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; is &quot;patchwork in which Shakespeare collaborated with inferior dramatists.&quot; The adaptation starred Valentine Dyall as Henry, Sonia Dresdel as Margaret, John Glen as Edward and Donald Wolfit as Richard. In 1971, BBC Radio 3 presented a two-part adaptation of the trilogy by Raymond Raikes. Part 1 contained an abridged &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; and an abridged version of the first three acts of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;. Part 2 presented Acts 4 and 5 of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; and an abridged &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;. Nigel Lambert played Henry, Barbara Jefford played Margaret and Ian McKellen played both York and Richard. In 1977, BBC Radio 4 presented a 26-part serialisation of the eight sequential history plays under the general title &quot;Vivat Rex&quot; (long live the King). Adapted by Martin Jenkins as part of the celebration of the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II, &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; comprised episodes 19 (&quot;Warwick the Kingmaker&quot;) and 20 (&quot;The Tower&quot;). James Laurenson played Henry, Peggy Ashcroft played Margaret, Ian Ogilvy played Edward and Richard Burton narrated.

In America, in 1936, a heavily edited adaptation of the trilogy was broadcast as part of NBC Blue&#x27;s &quot;Radio Guild&quot; series. Comprising three sixty-minute episodes aired a week apart, the adaptation was written by Vernon Radcliffe and starred Henry Herbert as Henry and Janet Nolan as Margaret. In 1954, CBC Radio presented an adaptation of the trilogy by Andrew Allen, who combined &quot;1 Henry VI&quot;, &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; and &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; into a one hundred and sixty-minute episode. There is no known cast information for this production.

In 1985, German radio channel Sender Freies Berlin broadcast a heavily edited seventy-six-minute two-part adaptation of the octology adapted by Rolf Schneider, under the title &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Rosenkriege&quot;.

===Manga===
Aya Kanno&#x27;s Japanese manga comic &quot;Requiem of the Rose King&quot; is a loose adaptation of the first Shakespearean historical tetralogy, covering &quot;Henry VI&quot; and &quot;Richard III&quot;.

<text>Abstract art uses visual language of shape, form, color and line to create a composition which may exist with a degree of independence from visual references in the world. &quot;Abstract art&quot;, &quot;non-figurative art&quot;, &quot;non-objective art&quot;, and &quot;non-representational art&quot; are all closely related terms. They have similar, but perhaps not identical, meanings. 

Western art had been, from the Renaissance up to the middle of the 19th century, underpinned by the logic of perspective and an attempt to reproduce an illusion of visible reality. By the end of the 19th century many artists felt a need to create a new kind of art which would encompass the fundamental changes taking place in technology, science and philosophy. The sources from which individual artists drew their theoretical arguments were diverse, and reflected the social and intellectual preoccupations in all areas of Western culture at that time.

Abstraction indicates a departure from reality in depiction of imagery in art. This departure from accurate representation can be slight, partial, or complete. Abstraction exists along a continuum. Even art that aims for verisimilitude of the highest degree can be said to be abstract, at least theoretically, since perfect representation is impossible. Artwork which takes liberties, e.g. altering color or form in ways that are conspicuous, can be said to be partially abstract. Total abstraction bears no trace of any reference to anything recognizable. In geometric abstraction, for instance, one is unlikely to find references to naturalistic entities. Figurative art and total abstraction are almost mutually exclusive. But figurative and representational (or realistic) art often contain partial abstraction.

Both geometric abstraction and lyrical abstraction are often totally abstract. Among the very numerous art movements that embody partial abstraction would be for instance fauvism in which color is conspicuously and deliberately altered vis-a-vis reality, and cubism, which alters the forms of the real-life entities depicted.

== History ==
=== 19th century in Europe ===

Patronage from the church diminished and private patronage from the public became more capable of providing a livelihood for artists. Three art movements which contributed to the development of abstract art were Romanticism, Impressionism and Expressionism. Artistic independence for artists was advanced during the 19th century. An objective interest in what is seen can be discerned from the paintings of John Constable, J. M. W. Turner, Camille Corot and from them to the Impressionists who continued the &quot;plein air&quot; painting of the Barbizon school.
Early intimations of a new art had been made by James McNeill Whistler who, in his painting &quot;Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket&quot;, (1872), placed greater emphasis on visual sensation than the depiction of objects. Even earlier than that, with her &quot;spirit&quot; drawings, Georgiana Houghton&#x27;s choice to work with abstract shapes correlate with the unnatural nature of her subject, in a time when abstraction was not yet a concept (she organized an exhibit in 1871).

Expressionist painters explored the bold use of paint surface, drawing distortions and exaggerations, and intense color. Expressionists produced emotionally charged paintings that were reactions to and perceptions of contemporary experience; and reactions to Impressionism and other more conservative directions of late 19th-century painting. The Expressionists drastically changed the emphasis on subject matter in favor of the portrayal of psychological states of being. Although artists like Edvard Munch and James Ensor drew influences principally from the work of the Post-Impressionists they were instrumental to the advent of abstraction in the 20th century.
Paul Cézanne had begun as an Impressionist but his aim – to make a logical construction of reality based on a view from a single point, with modulated color in flat areas – became the basis of a new visual art, later to be developed into Cubism.

Additionally in the late 19th century in Eastern Europe mysticism and early modernist religious philosophy as expressed by theosophist Mme. Blavatsky had a profound impact on pioneer geometric artists like Hilma af Klint and Wassily Kandinsky. The mystical teaching of Georges Gurdjieff and P.D. Ouspensky also had an important influence on the early formations of the geometric abstract styles of Piet Mondrian and his colleagues in the early 20th century. The spiritualism also inspired the abstract art of Kasimir Malevich and František Kupka.

=== Early 20th century ===
==== Fauvism and Cubism ====

At the beginning of the 20th century Henri Matisse and several other young artists including the pre-cubist Georges Braque, André Derain, Raoul Dufy and Jean Metzinger revolutionized the Paris art world with &quot;wild&quot;, multi-colored, expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called Fauvism. The raw language of color as developed by the Fauves directly influenced another pioneer of abstraction, Wassily Kandinsky.

Cubism, based on Cézanne&#x27;s idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to cube, sphere and cone became, along with Fauvism, the art movement that directly opened the door to abstraction in the early 20th century.

==== Early abstract art ====
During the 1912 Salon de la Section d&#x27;Or, where František Kupka exhibited his abstract painting &quot;Amorpha, Fugue en deux couleurs&quot; (&quot;Fugue in Two Colors&quot;) (1912), the poet Guillaume Apollinaire named the work of several artists including Robert Delaunay, &quot;Orphism&quot;. He defined it as, &quot;the art of painting new structures out of elements that have not been borrowed from the visual sphere, but had been created entirely by the artist...it is a pure art.&quot;

Since the turn of the century, cultural connections between artists of the major European cities had become extremely active as they strove to create an art form equal to the high aspirations of modernism. Ideas were able to cross-fertilize by means of artist&#x27;s books, exhibitions and manifestos so that many sources were open to experimentation and discussion, and formed a basis for a diversity of modes of abstraction. The following extract from &quot;The World Backwards&quot; gives some impression of the inter-connectedness of culture at the time: &quot;David Burliuk&#x27;s knowledge of modern art movements must have been extremely up-to-date, for the second Knave of Diamonds exhibition, held in January 1912 (in Moscow) included not only paintings sent from Munich, but some members of the German Die Brücke group, while from Paris came work by Robert Delaunay, Henri Matisse and Fernand Léger, as well as Picasso. During the Spring David Burliuk gave two lectures on cubism and planned a polemical publication, which the Knave of Diamonds was to finance. He went abroad in May and came back determined to rival the almanac &quot;Der Blaue Reiter&quot; which had emerged from the printers while he was in Germany&quot;.

From 1909 to 1913 many experimental works in the search for this &#x27;pure art&#x27; had been created by a number of artists: Francis Picabia painted &quot;Caoutchouc&quot;, c. 1909, &quot;The Spring&quot;, 1912, &quot;Dances at the Spring&quot; and &quot;The Procession, Seville&quot;, 1912; Wassily Kandinsky painted &quot;Untitled (First Abstract Watercolor)&quot;, 1913, &quot;Improvisation 21A&quot;, the &quot;Impression&quot; series, and &quot;Picture with a Circle&quot; (1911); František Kupka had painted the Orphist works, &quot;Discs of Newton&quot; (Study for &quot;Fugue in Two Colors&quot;), 1912 and &quot;Amorpha, Fugue en deux couleurs&quot; (&quot;Fugue in Two Colors&quot;), 1912; Robert Delaunay painted a series entitled &quot;Simultaneous Windows&quot; and &quot;Formes Circulaires, Soleil n°2&quot; (1912–13); Léopold Survage created &quot;Colored Rhythm&quot; (Study for the film), 1913; Piet Mondrian, painted &quot;Tableau No. 1&quot; and &quot;Composition No. 11&quot;, 1913.

With his expressive use of color and his free and imaginative drawing Henri Matisse comes very close to pure abstraction in &quot;French Window at Collioure&quot; (1914), &quot;View of Notre-Dame&quot; (1914), and &quot;The Yellow Curtain&quot; from 1915.

And the search continued: The Rayist (Luchizm) drawings of Natalia Goncharova and Mikhail Larionov, used lines like rays of light to make a construction. Kasimir Malevich completed his first entirely abstract work, the Suprematist, &quot;Black Square&quot;, in 1915. Another of the Suprematist group&#x27; Liubov Popova, created the Architectonic Constructions and Spatial Force Constructions between 1916 and 1921. Piet Mondrian was evolving his abstract language, of horizontal and vertical lines with rectangles of color, between 1915 and 1919, Neo-Plasticism was the aesthetic which Mondrian, Theo van Doesburg and other in the group De Stijl intended to reshape the environment of the future.

==== Russian avant-garde ====


Many of the abstract artists in Russia became Constructivists believing that art was no longer something remote, but life itself. The artist must become a technician, learning to use the tools and materials of modern production. &quot;Art into life!&quot; was Vladimir Tatlin&#x27;s slogan, and that of all the future Constructivists. Varvara Stepanova and Alexandre Exter and others abandoned easel painting and diverted their energies to theatre design and graphic works.
On the other side stood Kazimir Malevich, Anton Pevsner and Naum Gabo. They argued that art was essentially a spiritual activity; to create the individual&#x27;s place in the world, not to organize life in a practical, materialistic sense. During that time, representatives of the Russian avant-garde collaborated with other Eastern European Constructivist artists, including Władysław Strzemiński, Katarzyna Kobro, and Henryk Stażewski.

Many of those who were hostile to the materialist production idea of art left Russia. Anton Pevsner went to France, Gabo went first to Berlin, then to England and finally to America. Kandinsky studied in Moscow then left for the Bauhaus. By the mid-1920s the revolutionary period (1917 to 1921) when artists had been free to experiment was over; and by the 1930s only socialist realism was allowed.

==== Music ====
As visual art becomes more abstract, it develops some characteristics of music: an art form which uses the abstract elements of sound and divisions of time. Wassily Kandinsky, himself an amateur musician, was inspired by the possibility of marks and associative color &quot;resounding in the soul.&quot; The idea had been put forward by Charles Baudelaire, that all our senses respond to various stimuli but the senses are connected at a deeper aesthetic level.

Closely related to this, is the idea that art has &quot;The spiritual dimension&quot; and can transcend &#x27;every-day&#x27; experience, reaching a spiritual plane. The Theosophical Society popularized the ancient wisdom of the sacred books of India and China in the early years of the century. It was in this context that Piet Mondrian, Wassily Kandinsky, Hilma af Klint and other artists working towards an &#x27;objectless state&#x27; became interested in the occult as a way of creating an &#x27;inner&#x27; object.
The universal and timeless shapes found in geometry: the circle, square and triangle become the spatial elements in abstract art; they are, like color, fundamental systems underlying visible reality.

==== The Bauhaus ====
The Bauhaus at Weimar, Germany was founded in 1919 by Walter Gropius. The philosophy underlying the teaching program was unity of all the visual and plastic arts from architecture and painting to weaving and stained glass. This philosophy had grown from the ideas of the Arts and Crafts movement in England and the Deutscher Werkbund. Among the teachers were Paul Klee, Wassily Kandinsky, Johannes Itten, Josef Albers, Anni Albers, and László Moholy-Nagy. In 1925 the school was moved to Dessau and, as the Nazi party gained control in 1932, The Bauhaus was closed. In 1937 an exhibition of degenerate art, &#x27;Entartete Kunst&#x27; contained all types of avant-garde art disapproved of by the Nazi party. Then the exodus began: not just from the Bauhaus but from Europe in general; to Paris, London and America. Paul Klee went to Switzerland but many of the artists at the Bauhaus went to America.

==== Abstraction in Paris and London ====


During the 1930s Paris became the host to artists from Russia, Germany, the Netherlands and other European countries affected by the rise of totalitarianism. Sophie Tauber and Jean Arp collaborated on paintings and sculpture using organic/geometric forms. The Polish Katarzyna Kobro applied mathematically based ideas to sculpture. The many types of abstraction now in close proximity led to attempts by artists to analyse the various conceptual and aesthetic groupings. An exhibition by forty-six members of the Cercle et Carré group organized by Joaquín Torres-García assisted by Michel Seuphor contained work by the Neo-Plasticists as well as abstractionists as varied as Kandinsky, Anton Pevsner and Kurt Schwitters. Criticized by Theo van Doesburg to be too indefinite a collection he published the journal &quot;Art Concret&quot; setting out a manifesto defining an abstract art in which the line, color and surface only are the concrete reality. Abstraction-Création founded in 1931 as a more open group, provided a point of reference for abstract artists, as the political situation worsened in 1935, and artists again regrouped, many in London. The first exhibition of British abstract art was held in England in 1935. The following year the more international &quot;Abstract and Concrete&quot; exhibition was organized by Nicolete Gray including work by Piet Mondrian, Joan Miró, Barbara Hepworth and Ben Nicholson. Hepworth, Nicholson and Gabo moved to the St. Ives in Cornwall to continue their constructivist work.

=== Late 20th century ===


During the Nazi rise to power in the 1930s many artists fled Europe to the United States. By the early 1940s the main movements in modern art, expressionism, cubism, abstraction, surrealism, and dada were represented in New York: Marcel Duchamp, Fernand Léger, Piet Mondrian, Jacques Lipchitz, André Masson, Max Ernst, and André Breton, were just a few of the exiled Europeans who arrived in New York. The rich cultural influences brought by the European artists were distilled and built upon by local New York painters. The climate of freedom in New York allowed all of these influences to flourish. The art galleries that primarily had focused on European art began to notice the local art community and the work of younger American artists who had begun to mature. Certain artists at this time became distinctly abstract in their mature work. During this period Piet Mondrian&#x27;s painting &quot;Composition No. 10&quot;, 1939–1942, characterized by primary colors, white ground and black grid lines clearly defined his radical but classical approach to the rectangle and abstract art in general.
Some artists of the period defied categorization, such as Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe who, while a modernist abstractionist, was a pure maverick in that she painted highly abstract forms while not joining any specific group of the period.

Eventually American artists who were working in a great diversity of styles began to coalesce into cohesive stylistic groups. The best-known group of American artists became known as the Abstract expressionists and the New York School. In New York City there was an atmosphere which encouraged discussion and there was a new opportunity for learning and growing. Artists and teachers John D. Graham and Hans Hofmann became important bridge figures between the newly arrived European Modernists and the younger American artists coming of age. Mark Rothko, born in Russia, began with strongly surrealist imagery which later dissolved into his powerful color compositions of the early 1950s. The expressionistic gesture and the act of painting itself, became of primary importance to Jackson Pollock, Robert Motherwell, and Franz Kline. While during the 1940s Arshile Gorky&#x27;s and Willem de Kooning&#x27;s figurative work evolved into abstraction by the end of the decade. New York City became the center, and artists worldwide gravitated towards it; from other places in America as well.

=== 21st century ===
Digital art, hard-edge painting, geometric abstraction, minimalism, lyrical abstraction, op art, abstract expressionism, color field painting, monochrome painting, assemblage, neo-Dada, shaped canvas painting, are a few directions relating to abstraction in the second half of the 20th century.

In the United States, &quot;Art as Object&quot; as seen in the Minimalist sculpture of Donald Judd and the paintings of Frank Stella are seen today as newer permutations. Other examples include Lyrical Abstraction and the sensuous use of color seen in the work of painters as diverse as Robert Motherwell, Patrick Heron, Kenneth Noland, Sam Francis, Cy Twombly, Richard Diebenkorn, Helen Frankenthaler, Joan Mitchell, and Veronica Ruiz de Velasco.

== Analysis ==

One socio-historical explanation that has been offered for the growing prevalence of the abstract in modern art—an explanation linked to the name of Theodor W. Adorno—is that such abstraction is a response to (and a reflection of) the growing abstraction of social relations in industrial society.

Frederic Jameson similarly sees modernist abstraction as a function of the abstract power of money, equating all things equally as exchange-values. The social content of abstract art is then precisely the abstract nature of social existence—legal formalities, bureaucratic impersonalization, information/power—in the world of late modernity.

By contrast, Post-Jungians would see the quantum theories with their disintegration of conventional ideas of form and matter as underlying the divorce of the concrete and the abstract in modern art.

Artist Al Capp offered the simpler explanation that abstract art was &quot;A product of the untalented, sold by the unprincipled to the utterly bewildered.&quot;

<text>HMS &quot;E15&quot; was an E-class submarine of the Royal Navy, commissioned in 1914.

==Design==
Like all post-&quot;E8&quot; British E-class submarines, &quot;E15&quot; had a displacement of at the surface and while submerged. She had a total length of and a beam of . She was powered by two Vickers eight-cylinder two-stroke diesel engines and two electric motors. The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a submerged speed of . British E-class submarines had fuel capacities of of diesel and ranges of when travelling at . &quot;E15&quot; was capable of operating submerged for five hours when travelling at .

As with most of the early E-class boats, &quot;E15&quot; was not fitted with a deck gun during construction but, as a vessel engaged in the Dardanelles campaign, later had a 12-pounder QF gun fitted, forward of the conning tower, at Malta Dockyard. She had five 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes, two in the bow, one either side amidships, and one in the stern; a total of 10 torpedoes were carried.

E-class submarines had wireless systems with 1 kW power ratings; in some submarines, these were later upgraded to 3 kW systems by removing a midship torpedo tube. Their maximum design depth was although in service some reached depths of below . Some submarines contained Fessenden oscillator systems. Her complement was three officers and 28 men.

== Service history ==
During World War I, &quot;E15&quot; served in the Mediterranean, participating in the Gallipoli Campaign against the Ottoman Empire. On 16 April 1915, under the command of Lieutenant Commander Theodore S. Brodie, &quot;E15&quot; sailed from her base at Mudros and attempted to break through the Dardanelles to the Sea of Marmara. Early in the morning of 17 April, the submarine, having dived too deep and become caught in the vicious current, ran aground some ten miles (16 km) in near Kepez Point directly under the guns of Fort Dardanos. &quot;E15&quot; was soon hit and disabled; Brodie was killed in the conning tower by shrapnel and six of the crew were killed by chlorine gas released when the submarine&#x27;s batteries were exposed to seawater after a second shell strike.
Forced to evacuate the vessel, the remaining crew surrendered, to be incarcerated in a prisoner of war camp near Istanbul where six later died.

The stranding was soon noticed by aeroplanes of the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS), and reported to the SS &quot;Hindu Kush&quot;, the Allied submarines&#x27; HQ and depot ship. It was considered imperative that the &quot;E15&quot; be destroyed to prevent the Turks from salvaging her. Several attempts were made; first, the British submarine , with Brodie&#x27;s brother on board, tried to sink her by torpedo but missed. Later, during the night, the destroyers and (commanded by the future Admiral A. B. Cunningham of World War II British Mediterranean Fleet fame), attempted to find her, but failed. The following morning, also failed to locate the beached &quot;E15&quot; owing to dense fog. Then the battleships and were ordered in but, prevented by intense fire from the Turkish shore batteries from getting within 11,000 metres of the submarine, were obliged to withdraw. Meanwhile, seaplanes attempted to bomb the stricken &quot;E15&quot; but also failed.

Finally, on the night of 18 April, two picket boats, one from &quot;Triumph&quot;, the other from &quot;Majestic&quot;, both armed with two 14-inch (356 mm) diameter torpedoes mounted in dropping gear, went in. Lieutenant Commander Eric Robinson, a volunteer from , commanded the expedition from &quot;Triumph&quot;″s boat; Lieutenant Claud Herbert Godwin skippered the boat from &quot;Majestic&quot;. Departing at 2200 hrs, the two vessels managed to navigate the narrow channel for before being detected and illuminated by searchlights, attracting a hail of fire from both shores. Miraculously both boats remained unscathed, and when one carelessly directed searchlight briefly illuminated the stricken submarine, Godwin seized his chance. Blinded by the lights, his first shot missed, and seconds afterwards the Turkish gunners scored their only hit, blowing away part of the stern and mortally wounding one seaman. Undeterred, Godwin went in again and fired his second torpedo, which struck &quot;E15&quot; just forward of the conning tower, but well below the waterline. Robinson, observing his comrades&#x27; plight, unhesitatingly brought his boat alongside and rescued them. Now doubly laden, &quot;Triumph&quot;″s boat fled downstream unobserved, the Turkish gunners concentrating their fire on the drifting and abandoned wreck of her sister ship.

The &quot;E15&quot; action would no doubt have earned Robinson the Victoria Cross had he not already been recommended for the award following earlier exploits on the Gallipoli peninsula. Instead, he was promoted to commander by special decree. Lieutenant Godwin was awarded the DSO, Lt. Brooke-Webb and Midshipman Woolley received the DSC, while the rest of the crews, all volunteers, received the DSM.

&quot;E15&quot; remains off Kepez Point in 8 m of water. The bodies of Lieut. Commander Brodie and several crew, initially buried on a beach nearby, were reinterred at the Chanak Consular Cemetery.

<text>This is a list of notable people who have been said to be a messiah, either by themselves or by their followers. The list is divided into categories, which are sorted according to date of birth, if it is known.

==Jewish messiah claimants==

In Judaism, &quot;messiah&quot; originally meant &quot;a divinely appointed king&quot; or &quot;anointed one&quot;, such as Aaron the brother of Moses, David, Cyrus the Great or Alexander the Great. Later, especially after the failure of the Hasmonean Kingdom (37 BC) and the Jewish–Roman wars (AD 66–135), the figure of the Jewish messiah was one who would deliver the Jews from oppression and usher in an Olam Haba (&quot;world to come&quot;) or Messianic Age.
However the term &quot;false messiah&quot; was largely absent from rabbinic literature. The first mention is in the Sefer Zerubbabel, from the mid-seventh century, which uses the term, &quot;mashiah sheker&quot;, (&quot;false messiah&quot;).
* Jesus of Nazareth (c. 4 BC – 30/33 AD), a religious leader who was persecuted by the Roman Empire for alleged sedition and is believed by Christians to have been crucified and resurrected. Jews who believed him to be the Messiah were originally called Nazarenes and later they were known as Jewish Christians (the first Christians). Baháʼís, Muslims, and Christians (including Messianic Jews) believe him to be the Messiah.
* Dositheos the Samaritan (mid 1st century), Origen wrote that Dositheos wished to persuade the Samaritans that he was the Jewish Messiah. (Hom. xxv in Lucam; &quot;Contra Celsum&quot;, I, lvii).
* Simon bar Kokhba, born Simon ben Koseva, (d. 135 AD) who led the apical Bar Kokhba revolt against the Roman Empire. For three years, bar Kokhba ruled as the &quot;nasi&quot;, or prince, of a semi-independent secessionist state in Israel. Some rabbinical scholars, including the great sage Akiva, proclaimed bar Kokhba as the Messiah. He died during the rebels&#x27; last stand at the fortress of Betar, after which the rebellion was brutally crushed and the land was left largely decimated, cementing both the slowly growing Jewish diaspora and the schism between Christianity and Judaism.
* Shlomo Molcho, born Diogo Pires (1500–1532) in Lisbon to parents who were Jewish converts to Christianity. After meeting David Reuveni, he left his post as secretary to the king&#x27;s council, traveled to Damascus, Safed, Jerusalem and later Solonika, where he studied kabbalah and became a mystic. He was eventually reunited with Reuveni, declared his aspirations as messiah, and was finally burned at the stake by the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, for refusing to convert back to Christianity. 
* Sabbatai Zevi (alternative spellings: Shabbetai, Sabbetai, Shabbesai; Zvi, Tzvi) (b. at Smyrna 1626; d. at Dulcigno (present day Ulcinj) 1676), a Sephardic ordained rabbi from Smyrna (now İzmir, Turkey), who was active throughout the Ottoman Empire and claimed to be the long-awaited Messiah. He was the founder of the Sabbatean movement, whose followers subsequently were to be known as Dönmeh &quot;converts&quot; or crypto-Jews - one of the most important messianic movements, whose influence was widespread throughout Jewry. His influence is felt even today. After his death, Sabbatai was followed by a line of putative followers who declared themselves Messiahs and are sometimes grouped as the &quot;Sabbethaian Messiahs&quot;.
*Menachem Mendel Schneerson (1902–1994), seventh Rebbe of Chabad Lubavitch; some of his followers believed that he was the Jewish Messiah during his lifetime, and some of them continue to believe so after his death in 1994. The number of believers grew in size after his death. Some of his followers believe that Schneerson never died. While Schneerson remained cryptic about such assertions, many of his followers do believe he was the Jewish Messiah. The issue remains controversial within both the Chabad movement and the broader Jewish community.

==Christian messiah claimants==

The Christian Bible states that Jesus will come again in some fashion; various people have claimed to, in fact, be the Second Coming of Jesus. Others have styled themselves new messiahs under the umbrella of Christianity.
The Synoptic gospels (Matthew 24:4, 6, 24; Mark 13:5, 21-22; and Luke 21:3) all use the term &quot;pseudochristos&quot; for messianic pretenders.
* Ann Lee (1736–1784), a central figure to the Shakers, who thought she &quot;embodied all the perfections of God&quot; in female form and considered herself in 1772 to be Christ&#x27;s female counterpart.
* John Nichols Thom (1799–1838), who had achieved fame and followers as Sir William Courtenay and adopted the claim of Messiah after a period in a mental institute.
* Abd-ru-shin (Oskar Ernst Bernhardt, 18 April 1875 – 6 December 1941), founder of the Grail Movement. 
* Lou de Palingboer (Louwrens Voorthuijzen) (1898-1968), a Dutch charismatic leader who claimed to be God as well as the Messiah from 1950 until his death in 1968.
* Ahn Sahng-hong (1918–1985), founder of the World Mission Society Church of God and worshiped by the members as the Messiah.
* Sun Myung Moon (1920–2012), founder and leader of the Unification Church established in Seoul, South Korea, who considered himself the Second Coming of Christ, but not Jesus himself. It is generally believed by Unification Church members (&quot;Moonies&quot;) that he was the Messiah and the Second Coming of Christ and was anointed to fulfill Jesus&#x27;s unfinished mission.
* Anne Hamilton-Byrne (born Evelyn Grace Victoria Edwards; 30 December 1921 – 13 June 2019), founder of The Family, Australia, claimed to have been the reincarnation of Jesus.
* (1931–2004), founder of the Victory Altar New Religious Movement, which refers to him as “the Victor Christ” and “God incarnated”. Died in the midst of a series of legal battles in which he was alternately convicted and acquitted on charges of fraud and instigation of the murders of multiple opponents.
* Lee Man-Hee (born 15 September 1931), founder of Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a new religious movement based in South Korea. Also known as The One Who Overcomes, he claims to be chosen by Jesus to be the next immortal savior of the world
* Jung Myung-seok (born 1945), a South Korean who was a member of the Unification Church in the 1970s, before breaking off to found the dissenting group now known as Providence Church in 1980. He also considers himself the Second Coming of Christ, but not Jesus himself. He believes he has come to finish the incomplete message and mission of Jesus Christ, asserting that he is the Messiah and has the responsibility to save all mankind. He claims that the Christian doctrine of resurrection is false but that people can be saved through him. Jung Myung-seok was convicted of rape by the Supreme Court of Korea and spent 10 years in prison (2008-2018). He was again indicted in South Korea on October 28, 2022, for sexually assaulting two female followers between 2018 and 2022.
* Claude Vorilhon, now known as Raël &quot;messenger of the Elohim&quot; (born 1946), a French professional test driver and former car journalist who became founder and leader of UFO religion the Raël Movement in 1972. Raëlism teaches that life on Earth was scientifically created by a species of extraterrestrials, which they call Elohim. He claimed he met an extraterrestrial humanoid in 1973 and became the Messiah. He then devoted himself to the task he said he was given by his &quot;biological father&quot;, an extraterrestrial named Yahweh.
* José Luis de Jesús Miranda (1946–2013), founder and leader of &quot;Creciendo en Gracia&quot; sect (Growing In Grace International Ministry, Inc.), based in Miami, Florida. He was a Puerto Rican preacher who had claimed to be both &quot;the Man Jesus Christ&quot; and the Antichrist at the same time, and exhibited a &quot;666&quot; tattoo on his forearm, a behavior his followers also adopted. He has referred to himself as &quot;Jesucristo Hombre&quot;, which translates to &quot;Jesus Christ made Man&quot;. He claimed he was indwelled with the same spirit that dwelled in Jesus. Miranda died on August 14, 2013, due to liver cancer.
* Inri Cristo (born 1948) of Indaial, Brazil, a claimant to be the second Jesus.
* Apollo Quiboloy (born 1950), Filipino founder and leader of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ religious group, who claims that Jesus Christ is the &quot;Almighty Father,&quot; that Quiboloy is &quot;His Appointed Son,&quot; and that salvation is now completed. He proclaims himself to be the &quot;Appointed Son of God&quot;. On November 11, 2021, Quiboloy was indicted by the United States Department of Justice for allegedly coercing girls and young women to have sex with him. These victims were threatened with eternal damnation and physical punishment if they didn’t comply. The indictment also included allegations that Quiboloy ran a sex-trafficking operation. Girls as young as 12 were allegedly trafficked through the fraudulent California charity “Children’s Joy.” Quiboloy was arrested by Philippine police on September 8, 2024.
* Brian David Mitchell (born 1953) was convicted May 25, 2011, for the 2002 kidnapping and rape of Elizabeth Smart. He believed himself the fore-ordained angel born on earth to be the Davidic &quot;servant&quot; prepared by God as a type of Messiah who would restore the divinely led kingdom of Israel to the world in preparation for Christ&#x27;s Second Coming. Mitchell&#x27;s belief in such an end-times figure – also known among many fundamentalist Latter Day Saints as &quot;the One Mighty and Strong&quot; – appeared to be based in part on a reading of the biblical Book of Isaiah by the independent LDS Hebraist, Avraham Gileadi, with whom Mitchell became familiar as a result of his previous participation in Sterling Allan&#x27;s American Study Group.
* Ante Pavlović (1957–2020), a Croatian self-proclaimed chiropractor who claimed to be a reincarnation of Jesus Christ, and would soon become president of Croatia.
* Sergey Torop (born 1961), who started to call himself &quot;Vissarion&quot;, founder of the Church of the Last Testament and the spiritual community Ecopolis Tiberkul in Southern Siberia.
* Alan John Miller (born 1962), founder of Divine Truth, a new religious movement based in Australia. Also known as A.J. Miller, he claims to be Jesus of Nazareth through reincarnation. Miller was formerly a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness.
* Yang Xiangbin (born 1973) is believed to be the identity of a woman referred to as &quot;Lightning Deng&quot; and &quot;the female Christ&quot; in the literature of Eastern Lightning, a Chinese Christian new religious movement. Zhao Weishan, founder and administrative leader of Eastern Lightning, claimed that Yang revealed herself to be the Second Coming of Christ in 1992.

==Muslim messiah claimants==

Islamic tradition has a prophecy of the Mahdi, who will come alongside the return of Isa (Jesus).

* Mirza Ghulam Ahmad of Qadian, India (1835–1908), proclaimed himself to be both the expected Mahdi and Messiah. Crucially, however, he claimed that Jesus had died a natural death after surviving crucifixion, and that prophecies concerning his future advent referred to the Mahdi himself bearing the qualities and character of Jesus rather than to his physical return alongside the Mahdi. He founded the Ahmadiyya Movement in 1889 envisioning it to be the rejuvenation of Islam. Adherents of the Ahmadiyya movement claim to be strictly Muslim, but are widely viewed by other Muslim groups as disbelievers and heretics.
* Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi (born 25 November 1941) is a spiritual leader and founder of the spiritual groups Anjuman Serfaroshan-e-Islam and RAGS International&quot;,&quot; now known as Messiah Foundation International. MFI reports that Shahi claimed to be the Mahdi, Messiah, and Kalki Avatar. Shahi has been also accused of claiming the status of a prophet. Shahi&#x27;s supporters claim that his face became prominent on the Moon, Sun, nebula star and the Black Stone in Mecca, and that these appearances are signs from God that Gohar Shahi is the awaited Mahdi, Messiah, and Kalki Avatar. According to MFI&#x27;s website, Shahi claimed to be Awaited Messiah, but not the second coming of Jesus and claim that Jesus has also returned to support the Shahi. Gohar Shahi claimed to have met with Jesus in America. Mainstream Muslim scholars have rejected Shahi&#x27;s claims, and condemned his teachings as blasphemous.

==Zoroastrian messiah claimants==

* Bahram Chobin, after he usurped the throne of the Sassanian Empire, declared himself to be the Messiah in the midst of the eschatological times of the late 6th century AD

==Multiple messiah claimants==
This list features people who are said, either by themselves or their followers, to be the messianic fulfillment of two or more religious traditions.
* Baháʼu&#x27;lláh, Mirza Husayn &#x27;Ali Nuri, (1817–1892), born Shiite, adopting Bábism in 1844 (see Báb or &quot;Ali Muhammad Shirazi&quot; in List of Mahdi claimants). In 1863, Baháʼu&#x27;lláh claimed to be the promised one of all religions, and founded the Baháʼí Faith. He claimed to be the fulfillment of the prophecies of the coming of a promised figure found in all 6 of the major prophetic religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Zoroastrianism, Hinduism and Buddhism) as noted in the authoritative history of the Baha&#x27;i Faith. He also claimed to be the prophet predicted by the Báb as &quot;He Whom God shall make manifest&quot; His followers have also claimed that his coming fulfilled prophecies of various smaller (often native) religions.

==Other messiah claimants==
This list features people who have been said, either by themselves or their followers, to be some form of a messiah that do not easily fit into Jewish, Christian, Islamic or other eschatological traditions.
* Cyrus Teed (1839–1908), proponent of the Hollow Earth theory who created a distinct model in which the world is an inverted sphere that the rest of universe can be seen from by looking inward and claimed to be the incarnation of Jesus Christ after being electrically shocked when attempting to practice alchemy with doses of magnetism during 1869.

* Adolf Hitler (1889–1945) of Nazi Germany has been claimed by some practitioners of Esoteric Nazism as the messiah, including Colin Jordan, Savitri Devi, and Miguel Serrano. Hitler had never claimed to be the messiah during his life, having had changing views towards religion.
* Chris Cantelmo (1962–2019), founder and leader of Cantelmoism, a religious mvement based on the belief that one can contact God using the drug DMT.
* Nirmala Srivastava (1923–2011), guru of Sahaja Yoga, proclaimed herself to be the Comforter promised by Jesus (that is, the incarnation of the Holy Ghost / Adi Shakti).
* World Teacher, a being claimed to be the Theosophical Maitreya and the Messiah (promised one) of all religions. He is said to have descended from the higher planes and manifested a physical body in early 1977 in the Himalayas, then on 19 July 1977 he is said to have taken a commercial airplane flight from Pakistan to England. He is currently said to be living in secret in London; promoted by New Age activist Benjamin Creme and his organization, Share International (See Maitreya (Benjamin Creme)).
* David Icke (born 29 April 1952), New Age conspiracy theorist who came up with the idea of Draconians and claimed to be the &quot;son of God&quot; during an interview on Wogan in 1991.

==Early life==
Jones was born Geethali Norah Jones Shankar on March 30, 1979, in Manhattan, New York City, to American concert producer Sue Jones and Indian Bengali musician Ravi Shankar. 

After her parents separated in 1986, Jones lived with her mother, growing up in Grapevine, Texas. As a child, Jones began singing in church and also took piano and voice lessons. She and her mother lived in Anchorage, Alaska when she was eleven years old. She attended Grapevine Middle School and Grapevine High School before transferring to Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts in Dallas. Her music took its first form early on in the local Methodist Church where she regularly sang solos. While in high school, she sang in the school choir, participated in band, and played the alto saxophone. At the age of 16, with both parents&#x27; consent, she officially changed her name to Norah Jones.

Jones always had an affinity for the music of Bill Evans and Billie Holiday, among other &quot;oldies&quot;. She once said, &quot;My mom had this eight-album Billie Holiday set; I picked out one disc that I liked and played that over and over again&quot;.

She attended Interlochen Center for the Arts during the summers. While at high school, she won the &quot;Down Beat&quot; Student Music Awards for Best Jazz Vocalist (twice, in 1996 and 1997) and Best Original Composition (1996).

Jones attended the University of North Texas (UNT), where she majored in jazz piano and sang with the UNT Jazz Singers. During this time, she had a chance meeting with future collaborator Jesse Harris. She gave a ride to a band playing at the university whose members happened to be friends of Harris. He was on a cross-country road trip with friend and future Little Willies member Richard Julian, and stopped to see the band play. After meeting Jones, Harris started sending her lead sheets of his songs.

In 1999, Jones left Texas for New York City. Less than a year later, she started a band with Harris, and her recordings with them were bestsellers.

==Musical career==
Jones was a lounge singer before becoming a recording artist. Before releasing her first studio album, she performed with Wax Poetic, Peter Malick, and jazz guitarist Charlie Hunter.

===2000–2002: &quot;New York City&quot;, &quot;First Sessions&quot; and &quot;Come Away with Me&quot;===

As Peter Malick states in the liner notes, &quot;I started looking for a singer who might be open to recording [my latest songs] for me. On a Tuesday night, I walked into the Living Room just as the singer announced the last song of the set. The Dinah Washington classic &#x27;Since I Fell for You&#x27; filled the room and I was struck breathless. Here, in the tradition of Billie Holiday, was a stunningly beautiful, blues infused voice. This was my first contact with Norah Jones.&quot; Malick asked her to participate in sessions at Room 9 from Outer Space in South Boston, during August and September 2000. They recorded Malick&#x27;s songs &quot;New York City&quot;, &quot;Strange Transmissions&quot;, &quot;Deceptively Yours&quot; and &quot;Things You Don&#x27;t Have to Do&quot; in addition to cover versions of &quot;All Your Love&quot; by Sam Maghett and &quot;Heart of Mine&quot; by Bob Dylan. These songs became the album &quot;New York City&quot; (Koch, 2003) by the Peter Malick Group Featuring Norah Jones.

After moving to New York City, Jones signed to Blue Note, a label owned by EMI Group. The signing came as an indirect result of her performing as lead singer for the JC Hopkins Biggish Band. Shell White, who was the wife of J. C. Hopkins, worked for EMI Publishing and gave Jones&#x27;s three-track demo to Bruce Lundvall, the label&#x27;s president, and Brian Bacchus, its artists and repertoire agent (A&amp;R). The demo contained two jazz standards and a song by Jesse Harris. The two executives agreed that Jones had potential. Despite their misgivings about the direction of her music, they signed her to the label. Bacchus told &quot;HitQuarters&quot;, &quot;We let her find her own direction ... We knew that if she could develop her songwriting and we could find great songs, it would work.&quot;
Bacchus thought producer and engineer Jay Newland&#x27;s experience in jazz, blues, rock, country, and folk music would give a &quot;feeling for her sound.&quot; Jones and Newland recorded nine demo tracks. Four appeared on the sampler &quot;First Sessions&quot; (2001). The rest were set aside for her debut album. &quot;Come Away with Me&quot; (2002) was praised for its blend of acoustic pop with soul and jazz. Debuting at No. 139, it reached No. 1 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The single &quot;Don&#x27;t Know Why&quot; hit No. 1 on the Top 40 Adult Recurrents in 2003 and No. 30 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Singles Chart. At the 45th Grammy Awards in 2003, Jones was nominated for eight Grammy Awards and won five: Best New Artist, Album of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Album, Record of the Year, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for &quot;Don&#x27;t Know Why&quot;. This tied Lauryn Hill and Alicia Keys for most Grammy Awards received by a female artist in one night. Jesse Harris won Song of the Year for &quot;Don&#x27;t Know Why&quot; while Arif Mardin won Producer of the Year. The album won Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical. &quot;Come Away with Me&quot; was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for having sold one million copies. In February 2005, it was certified diamond for selling ten million copies.

===2004–2009: &quot;Feels like Home&quot;, &quot;Not Too Late&quot; and &quot;The Fall&quot;===

&quot;Feels like Home&quot; (2004) debuted at the top of the charts in at least 16 countries, including Germany, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.

Jones released her third album, &quot;Not Too Late&quot;, on January 30, 2007. The album was the first for which she wrote or co-wrote every song. She has said some of these songs are much darker than those on her previous albums. &quot;Not Too Late&quot; was mostly recorded at Jones&#x27;s home studio. It is her first album without producer Arif Mardin, who died in the summer of 2006. Jones described the sessions as &quot;fun, relaxed and easy&quot; and without a deadline; Blue Note executives reportedly did not know she was recording an album. The song &quot;My Dear Country&quot; is political commentary; she wrote it before the United States Presidential election day in 2004. &quot;Not Too Late&quot; reached the No. 1 position in twenty countries. &quot;Not Too Late&quot; had the third-best first week of sales in 2007, behind Avril Lavigne&#x27;s &quot;The Best Damn Thing&quot; and Linkin Park&#x27;s &quot;Minutes to Midnight&quot;. It reached No. 1 in the U.S., selling 405,000 copies. EMI announced that &quot;Not Too Late&quot; reached gold, platinum or multi-platinum in 21 countries as of February 2007. The album has sold 4 million copies worldwide. That same year she sang &quot;American Anthem&quot; for the Ken Burns documentary &quot;The War&quot;.
Jones&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;The Fall&quot;, debuted at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in November 2009, selling 180,000 copies in its first week. Although it was her first album that did not reach No. 1 in the United States, it did receive critical acclaim. As part of the promotional drive for the album, Jones performed on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and other television programs. &quot;The Fall&quot; featured a St. Bernard on the cover; his name is Ben. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Chasing Pirates&quot;, peaked at No. 13 on Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks and No. 7 on Jazz Songs. &quot;Billboard&quot;″s 2000–2009 decade awards ranked Jones as the top jazz recording artist, at No. 60 best Artist. &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; was elected the No. 4 album and No. 1 jazz album. 

Jones earned a platinum certification by the RIAA for sales of 1 million copies of &quot;The Fall&quot;. The album sold 1.5 million copies worldwide and was certified gold or platinum in 14 countries as of 2010. &quot;Baby, It&#x27;s Cold Outside&quot;, a duet with Willie Nelson, was nominated in the Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals category. In 2009, Jones performed &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; and &quot;Young Blood&quot; at the end of the Apple Inc.&#x27;s It&#x27;s Only Rock and Roll press conference on September 9 in San Francisco, for the release of iTunes 9 and video camera-equipped iPods, among other items She also made a guest appearance and performed with other artists on the season three finale of the NBC series &quot;30 Rock&quot;.

She played the album in its entirety at SXSW 2012. &quot;American Songwriter&quot; called &quot;Little Broken Hearts&quot; the &quot;most dramatic and rewarding departure she&#x27;s made in her career.&quot; On May 25, 2012, she began her fifth world tour in Paris, with performances in Europe, North America, Asia, South America, and Australia. She performed in London at the Roundhouse on September 10, 2012, as part of the iTunes Festival which was broadcast on the internet.

The album marked a return to her piano after dabbling in folk and pop on the last two records. Jones said the goal of this record was to do everything live. She said in an interview with &quot;Billboard&quot;, &quot;When you have great musicians, there&#x27;s no reason to overdub. That strips the soul out of the music.&quot; In 2019, Jones released a compilation album of singles she recorded from 2018 to 2019, entitled &quot;Begin Again&quot;, and the set includes collaborations with Jeff Tweedy and Thomas Bartlett.

<doc id="184867" wikidata="Q1238161" url="?curid=184867" title="The Downs (ship anchorage)">
<text>The Downs is a roadstead (an area of sheltered, favourable sea) in the southern North Sea near the English Channel, off the east Kent coast in southern England, between the North and the South Foreland, near the town of Deal. From the Elizabethan era onward the presence of the Downs helped to make Deal one of the premier ports in England, and in the 19th century it was equipped with its own telegraph and timeball tower to enable ships to set their marine chronometers.


The anchorage has depths down to . Even during southerly gales some shelter was afforded, though under this condition wrecks were not infrequent. Storms from any direction could also drive ships onto the shore or onto the sands, which—in spite of providing the sheltered water—were constantly shifting, and not always adequately marked. The Downs served in the age of sail as a permanent base for warships patrolling the North Sea and a gathering point for refitted or new ships coming out of Chatham Dockyard, such as , and formed a safe anchorage during heavy weather, protected on the east by the Goodwin Sands and on the north and west by the coast. The Downs lie between the Strait of Dover and the Thames Estuary, so both merchant ships awaiting an easterly wind to take them into the English Channel and those going up to London gathered there, often for quite long periods. According to the Deal Maritime Museum and other sources, there are records of as many as 800 sailing ships at anchor at one time.

In August 1511, Andrew Barton, a privateer, was killed in battle on board his ship. The Battle of the Downs took place here in 1639, when the Dutch navy destroyed a Spanish fleet which had sought refuge in neutral English waters. During the First World War, German destroyers made frequent raids against ships anchored in the Downs. Royal Navy vessels of the Dover Patrol were often tasked with guarding the area at night to discourage the enemy or counter-attack.

The English Channel remains the busiest shipping lane in the world; cross-Channel ferries and other ships still seek shelter in The Downs.

==Popular culture==
&quot;Black-eyed Susan&quot; or &quot;All in the Downs&quot; is a song by John Gay (1685–1732). The roadstead is also mentioned in the naval song &quot;Spanish Ladies&quot;.

<doc id="184869" wikidata="Q548656" url="?curid=184869" title="Blind Faith">
<text>Blind Faith were an English rock supergroup that consisted of Steve Winwood, Eric Clapton, Ginger Baker, and Ric Grech. They followed the success of each of the member&#x27;s former bands, including Clapton and Baker&#x27;s former group Cream and Winwood&#x27;s former group Traffic, but they split after a few months, producing only one album and a three-month summer tour.

The group originated with informal jamming by Clapton and Winwood in early 1969 following the break-ups of Cream and Traffic. Baker joined them in rehearsals and they decided to form a group. Grech joined as the fourth member from the band Family in May, and they began recording their eponymous debut album. It drew controversy for featuring a photograph of a topless 11-year-old girl on the front cover, and it was issued with a different cover in the United States.

The first Blind Faith concert was on 7 June in front of an estimated 100,000 fans in Hyde Park, London, but they felt that they had not rehearsed enough and were unprepared. They subsequently played concerts in Scandinavia and the US, but the lack of material in the live set led them to play old Cream and Traffic songs which pleased the audience but disillusioned the band. Clapton became increasingly isolated during the tour, preferring to spend time with support act Delaney &amp; Bonnie, and Blind Faith disbanded immediately after their last performance. Clapton and Winwood both enjoyed the music that they played together in the group&#x27;s limited time, and they have since collaborated on several tours playing Blind Faith material.

== Formation and early history ==
The origins of Blind Faith lay in the break-up of Cream in mid-1968. That trio was a major critical and commercial success, with millions of record sales in a few years, bringing international popularity to the group and each member. However, the band was crumbling from within because of frequent animosity between bassist Jack Bruce and drummer Ginger Baker, with Eric Clapton doing his best to mediate. Additionally, Clapton grew tired of playing commercially driven blues and hoped to progress with a new, experimental, less straitjacketed approach to the genre. The group disbanded in November 1968 following two concerts at the Royal Albert Hall.

Steve Winwood had faced similar problems to Clapton in the Spencer Davis Group, where he had been the lead singer for three years. Winwood wanted to experiment with the band&#x27;s sound by infusing jazz elements, but left due to his musical differences, instead forming a new band, Traffic, in 1967. While that band was on hiatus in Christmas 1968, Winwood started to jam with his good friend Clapton in the latter&#x27;s basement in Surrey, England. Clapton was pleased with the jam sessions with Winwood, but was hesitant to start a serious group. The music press were hopeful that Clapton would form a band even better than Cream. At one point, Clapton and Winwood thought they might record with Duck Dunn and Al Jackson Jr., the rhythm section of Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s.

In early 1969, Clapton and Winwood moved to Traffic&#x27;s rehearsal cottage in Aston Tirrold, Berkshire. Baker turned up one day to sit in with them, and the three seriously considered forming a group. Clapton questioned letting Baker in the band, because he had promised Bruce that, if they were to work with one another again, all three of them would play. Moreover, Clapton did not want to reunite with Cream barely nine weeks after the break-up, and also did not want to deal with another band whose members had large reputations individually. Winwood ultimately persuaded Clapton to finalize Baker&#x27;s inclusion in the line-up, arguing that Baker strengthened their musicianship and that it would be hard to find an equally talented drummer. Traffic was put on hold and the other remaining members, multi-instrumentalist Chris Wood and drummer / singer Jim Capaldi, were informed. Winwood later realised that Clapton would probably have rather had Capaldi in the new group instead of Baker.

Clapton and Winwood&#x27;s respective managers, Robert Stigwood and Chris Blackwell, said they would be happy to manage the new band. This created immediate tension; Stigwood wanted a quick money-making formula, while the band wanted time to write songs and develop as a unit. Winwood later said, &quot;they wanted a supergroup and we didn&#x27;t&quot;.

The formation of the group was announced to the press on 8 February 1969. By May, Ric Grech, bassist with Family, was invited to join them. He left Family midway through a US tour, causing considerable acrimony with the rest of the group. The new band&#x27;s name was confirmed as &quot;Blind Faith&quot; around this time by Clapton, who thought it described everyone&#x27;s self-belief that the band would be successful, no matter what happened.

== Recording ==

Because Winwood was signed to Island Records, he had to obtain permission from Blackwell (who owned the label) to appear on Polydor Records (to whom Clapton and Baker were signed in the U.K.). A promotional single was released by Island, although the promotion was for the label itself. It was a single announcing the fact that they were moving their offices, titled &quot;Change Of Address From 23 June 1969&quot;. This one-sided promo featured an instrumental jam by Blind Faith, who were not mentioned on the label (the only other label info is the new address, phone number, and new cable address of Island). Recorded at Olympic Studios during session for the debut album, an estimated 500 copies of the single were pressed, and mostly sent to UK disc jockeys and other music industry insiders. The track was finally released widely when it appeared as a bonus track on the two-CD &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; of the &quot;Blind Faith&quot; album in 2000 (titled &quot;Change Of Address Jam&quot;).

Upon its release in July 1969, the band&#x27;s first and only album &quot;Blind Faith&quot; topped both the UK chart and &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s chart for Pop Album in the U.S. The album sold more than half a million copies in the first month of its release and helped rejuvenate sales of Cream albums. &quot;Best of Cream&quot; reached No. 3 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts at the same time that &quot;Blind Faith&quot; was at the top.

The cover art for the album was created by photographer Bob Seidemann, a personal friend and former flatmate of Clapton, who is known primarily for his photos of Janis Joplin and the Grateful Dead. The cover was nameless – only the wrapping paper told the buyer who the artist was and the name of the album. It provoked controversy because it featured a topless 11-year-old girl, holding in her hands a silver space ship. The US record company issued it with an alternative cover with a photograph of the band on the front. The model on the cover posed upon consent by her parents and was paid £40 (£ as of ) for the shot.

During 2000 the entire album was remastered and re-released as a two-CD deluxe edition from Polydor that includes alternate takes, out-takes and studio rehearsal versions of the band&#x27;s music created during the early months of 1969.

== Touring ==
News of Blind Faith&#x27;s formation created a buzz of excitement among the public and press. The group debuted at a free concert at London&#x27;s Hyde Park on 7 June 1969 in front of 100,000 fans. Capaldi and Wood attended the gig, as did Mick Jagger and Marianne Faithfull. The setlist contained all six numbers that would appear on the debut album, along with a cover of the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Under My Thumb&quot;, Traffic&#x27;s &quot;Means to an End&quot;, and Sam Myers&#x27; &quot;Sleeping in the Ground&quot;. The performance was well received by fans, but troubled Clapton, who thought that the band&#x27;s playing was sub-par. He spent much of the gig close to his amplifiers and not coming forward on stage; only Baker supplied any showmanship and theatrics during the set.

Though the group were still developing, their management insisted they continue touring to provide income. Clapton, knowing the band had not rehearsed enough and was unprepared, was reluctant to tour, but agreed to do so because he could collaborate with Winwood and had no better work offers. The recording of their album continued, followed by a short tour of Scandinavia, where the band played smaller gigs and was able to rehearse their sound and prepare it for bigger audiences in the US and UK. After Scandinavia, the band toured the United States, making their debut at Madison Square Garden on 12 July.

A major problem with the tour was that the band had only a few songs in their catalogue, barely enough to fill an hour, which the audience did not know well. Clapton in particular was against any lengthy jamming, which had been Cream&#x27;s trademark, which would have allowed them to stretch out a set to a sufficient length. The group were forced to play old Cream and Traffic songs, to the delight of a crowd which usually preferred the old hits to the new Blind Faith material. Clapton resented being in a popular supergroup when he had intended to start a more low-key project. They were playing the same material from his Cream days, to appease the audience and to fill the void left by the lack of adequate new material. Clapton wanted to play the Woodstock Festival, which occurred during the tour, but was outvoted by the rest of the group.

The tour was supported by opening acts Free, Taste, and R&amp;B-based rock act Delaney &amp; Bonnie. Because Clapton liked the soulful, folksy-sounding blues of Delaney &amp; Bonnie, he began spending most of his time with them instead of Blind Faith, letting Winwood take a more prominent role in the band. Clapton even began sitting in on Delaney &amp; Bonnie&#x27;s opening sets, sometimes simply playing percussion, and showing more interest in them than his own band. He also wanted them to be the headliners instead of Blind Faith.

The band toured for seven more weeks in the US, finishing in Hawaii on 24 August. After the gig, Clapton and Winwood decided to end the group. Grech was immediately informed, but Baker did not find out until he had returned to England following a short holiday in Jamaica. When he finally got home to the UK, he met with Winwood and was upset to find that the band had disbanded.

== Aftermath ==
After the tour finished in August, various press reports speculated on future band activity, with Stigwood announcing that there would be further tours forthcoming. In October, the band issued a press release saying they had disbanded. There was no further activity from the group, though several tracks from the band can be found on Steve Winwood&#x27;s 1995 retrospective album &quot;The Finer Things&quot;. In 2005, the live album &quot;London Hyde Park 1969&quot; was released, documenting the entire concert at the park.

Clapton had mixed feelings about ending the group, and felt guilty about abandoning a project that Winwood had put more involvement into than himself. He stepped out of the spotlight, first to sit in with the Plastic Ono Band, and then to tour as a sideman for Delaney &amp; Bonnie and Friends. This freed him of the attention that he had considered a plague to both Cream and Blind Faith. After his sideman stint, he took several members from Delaney &amp; Bonnie to form a new super-group, Derek and the Dominos. He never dropped his Blind Faith repertoire completely, and occasionally performed &quot;Presence of the Lord&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Find My Way Home&quot; throughout his solo career.

Unlike Clapton, Baker had enjoyed his Blind Faith experience and looked to carry on an offshoot of the band in the form of Ginger Baker&#x27;s Air Force with both Grech and Winwood. After a few shows together, Winwood left to record a solo album &quot;Mad Shadows&quot;, which turned into the Traffic album &quot;John Barleycorn Must Die&quot;. Clapton turned up backstage to a Traffic gig in 1970 and played dual lead guitar with Winwood on &quot;Dear Mr. Fantasy&quot;, fuelling rumours of a reunion of the pair. Grech joined Traffic&#x27;s touring band after the album was released, and played on the Traffic albums &quot;The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys&quot; and &quot;Welcome to the Canteen&quot;. Winwood would later go on to have a successful solo career, and Grech was a member of various groups before his death in 1990. Baker died on 6 October 2019, leaving Winwood and Clapton as the only two surviving members of Blind Faith.

== Clapton and Winwood reunions ==
Clapton and Winwood performed together again on stage as part of the Action for Research into Multiple Sclerosis (ARMS) tour in 1983. The shows were a benefit for former Small Faces and Faces member Ronnie Lane, who was suffering from the syndrome.

In July 2007, Clapton and Winwood reunited for a performance during the second Crossroads Guitar Festival held at the Toyota Park Center of Bridgeview (Illinois), where the duo performed a number of Blind Faith songs as part of their set. That performance inspired the two to perform three reunion concerts at Madison Square Garden that took place on 25, 26 and 28 February 2008. It was not an official Blind Faith reunion, but simply &quot;Winwood and Clapton&quot;. They performed the four songs on the first side of &quot;Blind Faith&quot; as well as selections from Traffic, Derek and the Dominos, Clapton&#x27;s solo career and some covers. A DVD and a two-disc CD of these performances was released in 2009.

On 10 June 2009, Winwood and Clapton began a 14-date United States summer tour at the Izod Center in New Jersey, again including Blind Faith material in their setlist. Winwood and Clapton met again for a series of five concerts at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall from 26 May to 1 June 2011. Clapton and Winwood both returned to play Hyde Park on 8 July 2018, though they performed separately.

In February 2020, Clapton and Winwood played a selection of Blind Faith material at a tribute gig to Baker at the Eventim Apollo.

<doc id="184873" wikidata="Q408810" url="?curid=184873" title="Potassium ferricyanide">
<text>Potassium ferricyanide is the chemical compound with the formula K3[Fe(CN)6]. This bright red salt contains the octahedrally coordinated [Fe(CN)6]3− ion. It is soluble in water and its solution shows some green-yellow fluorescence. It was discovered in 1822 by Leopold Gmelin.

==Preparation==
Potassium ferricyanide is manufactured by passing chlorine through a solution of potassium ferrocyanide. Potassium ferricyanide separates from the solution:
:2 K4[Fe(CN)6] + Cl2 → 2 K3[Fe(CN)6] + 2 KCl

==Structure==
Like other metal cyanides, solid potassium ferricyanide has a complicated polymeric structure. The polymer consists of octahedral [Fe(CN)6]3− centers crosslinked with K+ ions that are bound to the CN ligands. The K+---NCFe linkages break when the solid is dissolved in water.

==Applications==
The compound is also used to harden iron and steel, in electroplating, dyeing wool, as a laboratory reagent, and as a mild oxidizing agent in organic chemistry.

===Photography===
==== Blueprint, cyanotype, toner ====
The compound has widespread use in blueprint drawing and in photography (Cyanotype process). Several photographic print toning processes involve the use of potassium ferricyanide. It is often used as a mild bleach in a concentration of 10g/L to reduce film or print density.

==== Bleaching ====
Potassium ferricyanide was used as an oxidizing agent to remove silver from color negatives and positives during processing, a process called bleaching. Because potassium ferricyanide bleaches are environmentally unfriendly, short-lived, and capable of releasing hydrogen cyanide gas if mixed with high concentrations and volumes of acid, bleaches using ferric EDTA have been used in color processing since the 1972 introduction of the Kodak C-41 process. In color lithography, potassium ferricyanide is used to reduce the size of color dots without reducing their number, as a kind of manual color correction called dot etching.

==== Farmer&#x27;s reducer ====
Ferricyanide is also used in black-and-white photography with sodium thiosulfate (hypo) to reduce the density of a negative or gelatin silver print where the mixture is known as Farmer&#x27;s reducer; this can help offset problems from overexposure of the negative, or brighten the highlights in the print.

===Reagent in organic synthesis===
Potassium ferricyanide is a used as an oxidant in organic chemistry. It is an oxidant for catalyst regeneration in Sharpless dihydroxylations.

===Sensors and indicators===
Potassium ferricyanide is also one of two compounds present in ferroxyl indicator solution (along with phenolphthalein) that turns blue (Prussian blue) in the presence of Fe2+ ions, and which can therefore be used to detect metal oxidation that will lead to rust. It is possible to calculate the number of moles of Fe2+ ions by using a colorimeter, because of the very intense color of Prussian blue.

In physiology experiments potassium ferricyanide provides a means increasing a solution&#x27;s redox potential (E°&#x27; ~ 436 mV at pH 7). As such, it can oxidize reduced cytochrome c (E°&#x27; ~ 247 mV at pH 7) in isolated mitochondria. Sodium dithionite is usually used as a reducing chemical in such experiments (E°&#x27; ~ −420 mV at pH 7).

Potassium ferricyanide is used to determine the ferric reducing power potential of a sample (extract, chemical compound, etc.). Such a measurement is used to determine of the antioxidant property of a sample.

Potassium ferricyanide is a component of amperometric biosensors as an electron transfer agent replacing an enzyme&#x27;s natural electron transfer agent such as oxygen as with the enzyme glucose oxidase. It is an ingredient in commercially available blood glucose meters for use by diabetics.

===Other===
Potassium ferricyanide is combined with potassium hydroxide (or sodium hydroxide as a substitute) and water to formulate Murakami&#x27;s etchant. This etchant is used by metallographers to provide contrast between binder and carbide phases in cemented carbides.

==Prussian blue==
Prussian blue, the deep blue pigment in blue printing, is generated by the reaction of K3[Fe(CN)6] with ferrous (Fe2+) ions as well as K4[Fe(CN)6] with ferric salts.

In histology, potassium ferricyanide is used to detect ferrous iron in biological tissue. Potassium ferricyanide reacts with ferrous iron in acidic solution to produce the insoluble blue pigment, commonly referred to as Turnbull&#x27;s blue or Prussian blue. To detect ferric (Fe3+) iron, potassium &quot;ferrocyanide&quot; is used instead in the Perls&#x27; Prussian blue staining method. The material formed in the Turnbull&#x27;s blue reaction and the compound formed in the Prussian blue reaction are the same.

==Safety==
Potassium ferricyanide has low toxicity, its main hazard being that it is a mild irritant to the eyes and skin. However, under very strongly acidic conditions, highly toxic hydrogen cyanide gas is evolved, according to the equation:

:6 H+ + [Fe(CN)6]3− → 6 HCN + Fe3+

For example, it will react with diluted sulfuric acid under heating forming potassium sulfate, ferric sulfate and hydrogen cyanide.

:2 K3 [Fe(CN)6] + 6 H2SO4 → 3 K2 SO4 + Fe2 (SO4)3 + 12 HCN

This will not occur with concentrated sulfuric acid as hydrolysis to formic acid and dehydration to carbon monoxide will take place instead.

:2 K3 Fe(CN)6 + 12 H2 SO4 + 12 H2O → 3 K2SO4 + 6 (NH4)2 SO4 + Fe2 (SO4)3 + 12 CO

<text>General Event Notification Architecture.

GENA Base defines an HTTP notification architecture that transmits notifications between HTTP resources. An HTTP resource could be any object which might need to send or receive a notification, for example a distribution list, buddy list, print job, etc. It was defined in Internet Draft &quot;draft-cohen-gena-p-base-01.txt&quot; (now expired).

GENA Base Client to Arbiter provides for the ability to send and receive notifications using HTTP over TCP/IP and administratively scoped unreliable multicast UDP. Provisions are made for the use of intermediary arbiters, called subscription arbiters, which handle routing notifications to their intended destination.

==History==

During July 13–14, 1998 the University of California Irvine convened WISEN: the Workshop on Internet-Scale Event Notification. This event brought together a number of experts of various fields and included a presentation on GENA by Josh Cohen of Microsoft. Delegates showcased their event notification architectures and haggled over requirements of the same. Josh&#x27;s final slide includes the bullet points &quot;GENA is being implemented by Microsoft Products&quot; and &quot;Our wish is to collaborate to agree on a standard. GENA or other, we will comply.&quot;

Interest in event notification appears to have waned after 1998 as participants were unable to come to common definitions of what is required for the definition of notification services and protocols. GENA was briefly considered for use in the Internet Printing Protocol but found a niche as part of the Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) architecture.

<text>In chemistry, a reducing agent (also known as a reductant, reducer, or [[electron donor]]) is a chemical species that &quot;donates&quot; an electron to an (called the , , , or ).

Examples of substances that are common reducing agents include hydrogen, carbon monoxide, the alkali metals, formic acid, oxalic acid, and sulfite compounds.

In their pre-reaction states, reducers have extra electrons (that is, they are by themselves reduced) and oxidizers lack electrons (that is, they are by themselves oxidized). This is commonly expressed in terms of their oxidation states. An agent&#x27;s oxidation state describes its degree of loss of electrons, where the higher the oxidation state then the fewer electrons it has. So initially, prior to the reaction, a reducing agent is typically in one of its lower possible oxidation states; its oxidation state increases during the reaction while that of the oxidizer decreases.
Thus in a redox reaction, the agent whose oxidation state increases, that &quot;loses/donates electrons&quot;, that &quot;is oxidized&quot;, and that &quot;reduces&quot; is called the or , while the agent whose oxidation state decreases, that &quot;gains/accepts/receives electrons&quot;, that &quot;is reduced&quot;, and that &quot;oxidizes&quot; is called the or .
For example, consider the overall reaction for aerobic cellular respiration:

The oxygen () is being reduced, so it is the oxidizing agent. The glucose () is being oxidized, so it is the reducing agent. 

==Characteristics==

Consider the following reaction:

:2 + → 2 + 2 

The reducing agent in this reaction is ferrocyanide (). It donates an electron, becoming oxidized to ferricyanide (). Simultaneously, that electron is received by the oxidizer chlorine (), which is reduced to chloride ().

Strong reducing agents easily lose (or donate) electrons. An atom with a relatively large atomic radius tends to be a better reductant. In such species, the distance from the nucleus to the valence electrons is so long that these electrons are not strongly attracted. These elements tend to be strong reducing agents. Good reducing agents tend to consist of atoms with a low electronegativity, which is the ability of an atom or molecule to attract bonding electrons, and species with relatively small ionization energies serve as good reducing agents too.

The measure of a material&#x27;s ability to reduce is known as its reduction potential. The table below shows a few reduction potentials, which can be changed to oxidation potentials by reversing the sign. Reducing agents can be ranked by increasing strength by ranking their reduction potentials. Reducers donate electrons to (that is, &quot;reduce&quot;) oxidizing agents, which are said to &quot;be reduced by&quot; the reducer. The reducing agent is stronger when it has a more negative reduction potential and weaker when it has a more positive reduction potential. The more positive the reduction potential the greater the species&#x27; affinity for electrons and tendency to be reduced (that is, to receive electrons). The following table provides the reduction potentials of the indicated reducing agent at 25 °C. For example, among sodium (Na), chromium (Cr), cuprous (Cu+) and chloride (Cl−), it is Na that is the strongest reducing agent while Cl− is the weakest; said differently, Na+ is the weakest oxidizing agent in this list while Cl is the strongest.

Common reducing agents include metals potassium, calcium, barium, sodium and magnesium, and also compounds that contain the hydride H− ion, those being NaH, LiH, LiAlH4 and CaH2.

Some elements and compounds can be both reducing or oxidizing agents. Hydrogen gas is a reducing agent when it reacts with non-metals and an oxidizing agent when it reacts with metals.

:2 Li(s) + H2(g) → 2 LiH(s)
Hydrogen (whose reduction potential is 0.0) acts as an oxidizing agent because it accepts an electron donation from the reducing agent lithium (whose reduction potential is -3.04), which causes Li to be oxidized and hydrogen to be reduced.

:H2(g) + F2(g) → 2 HF(g)
Hydrogen acts as a reducing agent because it donates its electrons to fluorine, which allows fluorine to be reduced.

==Importance==

Reducing agents and oxidizing agents are the ones responsible for corrosion, which is the &quot;degradation of metals as a result of electrochemical activity&quot;. Corrosion requires an anode and cathode to take place. The anode is an element that loses electrons (reducing agent), thus oxidation always occurs in the anode, and the cathode is an element that gains electrons (oxidizing agent), thus reduction always occurs in the cathode. Corrosion occurs whenever there&#x27;s a difference in oxidation potential. When this is present, the anode metal begins deteriorating, given there is an electrical connection and the presence of an electrolyte.

==Examples of redox reaction==
Historically, reduction referred to the removal of oxygen from a compound, hence the name &#x27;reduction&#x27;. An example of this phenomenon occurred during the Great Oxidation Event, in which biologically−produced molecular oxygen (dioxygen (), an oxidizer and electron recipient) was added to the early Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, which was originally a weakly reducing atmosphere containing reducing gases like methane () and carbon monoxide () (along with other electron donors) and practically no oxygen because any that was produced would react with these or other reducers (particularly with iron dissolved in sea water), resulting in their .
By using water as a reducing agent, aquatic photosynthesizing cyanobacteria produced this molecular oxygen as a waste product. This initially oxidized the ocean&#x27;s dissolved ferrous iron (Fe(II) − meaning iron in its +2 oxidation state) to form insoluble ferric iron oxides such as Iron(III) oxide (Fe(II) lost an electron to the oxidizer and became Fe(III) − meaning iron in its +3 oxidation state) that precipitated down to the ocean floor to form banded iron formations, thereby removing the oxygen (and the iron). The rate of production of oxygen eventually exceeded the availability of reducing materials that removed oxygen, which ultimately led Earth to gain a strongly oxidizing atmosphere containing abundant oxygen (like the modern atmosphere). The modern sense of donating electrons is a generalization of this idea, acknowledging that other components can play a similar chemical role to oxygen.

The formation of iron(III) oxide;
:4Fe + 3O2 → 4Fe3+ + 6O2− → 2Fe2O3

In the above equation, the Iron (Fe) has an oxidation number of 0 before and 3+ after the reaction. For oxygen (O) the oxidation number began as 0 and decreased to 2−. These changes can be viewed as two &quot;half-reactions&quot; that occur concurrently:

# Oxidation half reaction: Fe0 → Fe3+ + 3e−
# Reduction half reaction: O2 + 4e− → 2 O2−

Iron (Fe) has been oxidized because the oxidation number increased. Iron is the reducing agent because it gave electrons to the oxygen (O2).
Oxygen (O2) has been reduced because the oxidation number has decreased and is the oxidizing agent because it took electrons from iron (Fe).

<text>An oxidizing agent (also known as an oxidant, oxidizer, electron recipient, or electron acceptor) is a substance in a redox chemical reaction that gains or &quot;accepts&quot;/&quot;receives&quot; an electron from a (called the , , or &quot;electron donor&quot;). In other words, an oxidizer is any substance that oxidizes another substance. The oxidation state, which describes the degree of loss of electrons, of the oxidizer decreases while that of the reductant increases; this is expressed by saying that oxidizers &quot;undergo reduction&quot; and &quot;are reduced&quot; while reducers &quot;undergo oxidation&quot; and &quot;are oxidized&quot;.
Common oxidizing agents are oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, and the halogens.

In one sense, an oxidizing agent is a chemical species that undergoes a chemical reaction in which it gains one or more electrons. In that sense, it is one component in an oxidation–reduction (redox) reaction. In the second sense, an oxidizing agent is a chemical species that transfers electronegative atoms, usually oxygen, to a substrate. Combustion, many explosives, and organic redox reactions involve atom-transfer reactions.

==Electron acceptors==
Electron acceptors participate in electron-transfer reactions. In this context, the oxidizing agent is called an &quot;electron acceptor&quot; and the reducing agent is called an &quot;electron donor&quot;. A classic oxidizing agent is the ferrocenium ion , which accepts an electron to form Fe(C5H5)2. One of the strongest acceptors commercially available is &quot;Magic blue&quot;, the radical cation derived from N(C6H4-4-Br)3.

Extensive tabulations of ranking the electron accepting properties of various reagents (redox potentials) are available, see Standard electrode potential (data page).

==Atom-transfer reagents==
In more common usage, an oxidizing agent transfers oxygen atoms to a substrate. In this context, the oxidizing agent can be called an oxygenation reagent or oxygen-atom transfer (OAT) agent. Examples include (permanganate), (chromate), OsO4 (osmium tetroxide), and especially (perchlorate). Notice that these species are all oxides.

In some cases, these oxides can also serve as electron acceptors, as illustrated by the conversion of to ,ie permanganate to manganate.

===Common oxidizing agents===
*Oxygen (O2)
*Ozone (O3)
*Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and other inorganic peroxides, Fenton&#x27;s reagent
*Fluorine (F2), chlorine (Cl2), and other halogens
*Nitric acid (HNO3) and nitrate compounds such as potassium nitrate (KNO3), the oxidizer in black powder
*Potassium chlorate (KClO3) 
*Peroxydisulfuric acid (H2S2O8)
*Peroxymonosulfuric acid (H2SO5)
*Hypochlorite, chlorite, chlorate, perchlorate, and other analogous halogen oxyanions
*Fluorides of chlorine, bromine, and iodine
*Hexavalent chromium compounds such as chromic and dichromic acids and chromium trioxide, pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC), and chromate/dichromate compounds such as Sodium dichromate (Na2Cr2O7)
*Permanganate compounds such as potassium permanganate (KMnO4)
*Sodium perborate (·)
*Nitrous oxide (N2O), Nitrogen dioxide/Dinitrogen tetroxide (NO2 / N2O4)
*Sodium bismuthate (NaBiO3)
*Cerium (IV) compounds such as ceric ammonium nitrate and ceric sulfate
*Lead dioxide (PbO2)

== Dangerous materials definition ==

The dangerous goods definition of an oxidizing agent is a substance that can cause or contribute to the combustion of other material. By this definition some materials that are classified as oxidizing agents by analytical chemists are not classified as oxidizing agents in a dangerous materials sense. An example is potassium dichromate, which does not pass the dangerous goods test of an oxidizing agent.

The U.S. Department of Transportation defines oxidizing agents specifically. There are two definitions for oxidizing agents governed under DOT regulations. These two are Class 5; Division 5.1(a)1 and Class 5; Division 5.1(a)2. Division 5.1 &quot;means a material that may, generally by yielding oxygen, cause or enhance the combustion of other materials.&quot; Division 5.(a)1 of the DOT code applies to solid oxidizers &quot;if, when tested in accordance with the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), its mean burning time is less than or equal to the burning time of a 3:7 potassium bromate/cellulose mixture.&quot; 5.1(a)2 of the DOT code applies to liquid oxidizers &quot;if, when tested in accordance with the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria, it spontaneously ignites or its mean time for a pressure rise from 690 kPa to 2070 kPa gauge is less than the time of a 1:1 nitric acid (65 percent)/cellulose mixture.&quot;

<doc id="184884" wikidata="Q398101" url="?curid=184884" title="T'Pau (band)">
<text>T&#x27;Pau are an English pop group formed in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, led by singer Carol Decker. They had a string of top 40 hits in the UK during the late 1980s and early 1990s, most notably &quot;China in Your Hand&quot;, &quot;Heart and Soul&quot; and &quot;Valentine&quot;, and several hits in the rest of Europe, before disbanding in 1992. Decker still performs under the name T&#x27;Pau at solo shows and 1980s nostalgia concerts, and in 2013 she reunited with original band member and co-songwriter Ronnie Rogers for a 25th-anniversary UK tour.

==History==
The band formed in 1986, taking their name from a Vulcan elder of the same name in the sci-fi series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Prior to deciding on this name, they were called Talking America on early demos sent to record and publishing companies.

Their first hit was the 1987 release &quot;Heart and Soul&quot;. Initially a flop in the UK, it first became a hit in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, reaching No. 4 after being featured on a Pepe Jeans advertisement; it repeated the feat in the UK Singles Chart some months later. Their third single, &quot;China in Your Hand&quot;, was their biggest UK hit; it became the 600th single to reach number 1 in the UK and spent five weeks at the top spot. It also reached the number 1 in several other European countries but made little impact in the United States. Their debut album, &quot;Bridge of Spies&quot; (simply called &quot;T&#x27;Pau&quot; in the US), also reached number 1 and went quadruple platinum in the UK. The album produced a total of five hit singles including &quot;Valentine&quot;, &quot;Sex Talk&quot; (a live recording of an early flop single, &quot;Intimate Strangers&quot;), and &quot;I Will Be with You&quot;.

In 1988 they released their second album &quot;Rage&quot;, which peaked at No. 4 in the UK and reached platinum status there, but failed to come close to the level of success of the band&#x27;s debut album the year before. It produced the UK top 20 single &quot;Secret Garden&quot;, though chart returns were diminishing by this point, and two following singles earned very modest success. The third album &quot;The Promise&quot; followed in 1991: it peaked at No. 10 in the UK, earning a silver disc. The Promise included one top 20 hit, &quot;Whenever You Need Me&quot;, but the band&#x27;s commercial peak had now passed and they split up after its release. A compilation album, &quot;Heart and Soul – The Very Best of T&#x27;Pau&quot;, was released in 1993 and reached the UK top 40.

Another greatest hits release appeared in 1997, and Decker reformed the band with a new line-up in 1998, for the release of a new studio album, &quot;Red&quot;. The record was not a commercial success, but T&#x27;Pau have continued to perform live on a semi-regular basis. Two singles &quot;With a Little Luck&quot; and &quot;Giving Up the Ghost&quot; were released from the album. Decker still made guest appearances on TV shows throughout the 2000s, including &quot;Hit Me, Baby, One More Time&quot;, &quot;Just the Two of Us&quot; and &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;. In 2007, marking the 20th anniversary of T&#x27;Pau&#x27;s first success, Ron Rogers and Carol Decker released a new single, &quot;Just Dream&quot;, exclusively as an internet download. In 2008, T&#x27;Pau were part of the Here and Now 1980s nostalgia tour.

To mark the 25th anniversary of the formation of the band, Decker and Rogers embarked on a 28-date UK tour during the spring of 2013 without the original band members.

In February 2015, T&#x27;Pau released their fifth studio album, &quot;Pleasure &amp; Pain&quot;, and embarked on a tour. The final eight shows on the &quot;Pleasure &amp; Pain Tour&quot; had to be cancelled in early March after Decker suffered damage to her voice while suffering from bronchitis. Around the same time, it emerged that she had also grown frustrated at a lack of airplay for her band&#x27;s new material, as many radio stations were only interested in playing T&#x27;Pau&#x27;s classic hits. In an interview, she stated, &quot;It&#x27;s a little harder to get on the radio because all the &#x27;80s stations play the &#x27;80s stuff and they won&#x27;t play your new stuff. They actually say they can&#x27;t, and then the younger stations play the younger artists, the hip stations. That&#x27;s the downside, and I miss hearing radio plays for the new stuff... it is a little frustrating that I can&#x27;t get it out to the wider audience anymore.&quot; Despite this however the album did manage to edge into the charts at No. 98, their first chart action for more than two decades.

<doc id="184886" wikidata="Q450627" url="?curid=184886" title="Caroline Fox, 1st Baroness Holland">
<text>Georgiana Carolina Fox, 1st Baroness Holland, of Holland (27 March 1723 – 24 July 1774), known as Lady Caroline Lennox before 1744 and as Lady Caroline Fox from 1744 to 1762, was the eldest of the Lennox sisters.

==Family background==
The Lennox sisters were daughters of Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond, and Sarah Cadogan. Charles Lennox was the grandson of Charles II of England through the King&#x27;s relationship with Louise de Kérouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth. In 1744, Lady Caroline eloped with Henry Fox, a politician who was 18 years her senior. Though her parents disapproved of the marriage, it proved a happy one. The couple had four sons, including the Whig politician Charles James Fox and the general Henry Edward Fox.

Their home, Holland House, Kensington, became a social and political gathering place.

==Passed over==
Lady Caroline&#x27;s favourite sister, Emily Lennox, married and went to live in Ireland in 1747. In 1750 and 1751, the Lennox sisters&#x27; parents died in quick succession, leaving three younger daughters, Louisa, Sarah, and Cecilia, aged eight, six, and one. The 2nd Duke of Richmond, in his will, remembered Lady Caroline&#x27;s reckless elopement, passed over her and instructed that his three youngest daughters be entrusted to the care of their sister Emily and her husband, James FitzGerald, 20th Earl of Kildare. Lady Caroline resented this slight but hoped to redeem herself by presenting her younger sisters at court and helping them make good matches.

She was present at the celebrations for the Prince of Wales&#x27;s birthday as there is a reference to her outfit in a letter by Mary Pendarves (became Delany) dated 29 November 1742 which notes that Lady Caroline Lennox wore the finest clothes of &quot;gold and colours on white, embroidered by Mrs Wright&quot;.

The Kildares&#x27; allegations that the Foxes were responsible for Lady Sarah Lennox&#x27;s embarrassing rejection by the young King George III, as well as her disastrous marriage to Sir Charles Bunbury soon afterwards, provoked a quarrel between the sisters that was not healed until shortly before Lady Caroline&#x27;s death.

==Baroness==
On 3 May 1762, Caroline was created Baroness Holland of Holland in the Peerage of Great Britain. Her husband was created Baron Holland of Foxley less than a year later, on 17 April 1763.

Caroline&#x27;s two spoilt sons, especially the elder one Stephen, caused her much embarrassment and distress by gambling and falling into debt.

==Illness and death==
Lady Caroline was already plagued by a mysterious and painful illness when her husband, who had suffered a stroke, died on 1 July 1774. She followed him 23 days later and is buried at All Saints, Farley, Wiltshire.

==In media==
&quot;Aristocrats&quot;, a six-part television drama based on Stella Tillyard&#x27;s biography of Caroline and her sisters, first aired on BBC One in 1999.
