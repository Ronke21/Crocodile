<text>A curate () is a person who is invested with the &quot;care&quot; or &quot;cure&quot; () of souls of a parish. In this sense, &quot;curate&quot; means a parish priest; but in English-speaking countries the term &quot;curate&quot; is commonly used to describe clergy who are assistants to the parish priest. The duties or office of a curate are called a curacy.

==Etymology and other terms==
The term is derived from the Latin (compare Curator).

In other languages, derivations from &quot;&quot; may be used differently. In French, the is the chief priest (assisted by a ) of a parish, as is the Italian , the Spanish , and the Filipino term (which almost always refers to the parish priest), which is derived from Spanish.

==Catholic Church==

In the Catholic Church, the English word &quot;curate&quot; is used for a priest assigned to a parish in a position subordinate to that of the parish priest. The parish priest (or often, in the United States, the &quot;pastor&quot; or &quot;minister&quot;) is the priest who has canonical responsibility for the parish. He may be assisted by one or more other priests, referred to as curates, assistant priests, parochial vicars, or (in America) associate/assistant pastors.

==Anglican Communion==

In the Church of England today, &quot;curate&quot; refers to priests (or, in the first year, transitional deacons) who are in their first post after ordination (usually for four years), and are completing their training (not unlike an apprenticeship). The technical term &quot;curate&quot;, as found in the 1662 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, meant the incumbent of a benefice, that is the person licensed by the diocesan bishop to the &quot;cure of souls&quot;, who, depending on how the benefice income was raised and distributed, was a rector, a vicar, or a perpetual curate. A vicar arises when a rectory was sold to lay rectors, which would often be a monastic house (such as abbey) or university college; a perpetual curacy where another priest or senior cleric has long-term control of the parish finances, granting an agreed stipend and general powers to the curate, albeit of theoretically of the same job security, below.

Although the expression &quot;curate-in-charge&quot; was mainly used of an informal arrangement whereby an incumbent gave most responsibility for one of the parish churches to an assistant, in law it denoted a cleric licensed by the bishop to exercise some or all of the cure of souls when the incumbent had failed to make adequate provision for them or was subject to disciplinary measures. Once in possession of their benefices, rectors and vicars enjoyed a somewhat locally varied array of rights, absolutely, a home in which to live without charge, and generally a generous income from the parish especially in the era of tithes, yet could be removed after due legal process and for a restricted number of reasons.

Perpetual curates were placed on a similar footing in 1838 and were commonly styled &quot;vicars&quot;, and this practice was legally recognised in 1868. Clergy (both transitional deacons and priests) who assist the &quot;curate&quot; were, and are, properly called assistant curates, but are often referred to as &quot;the curate&quot;.

A house provided for an assistant curate is sometimes colloquially called a &quot;curatage&quot;. Assistant curates are also licensed by the bishop, but only at the request of the &quot;curate&quot;, who had the right of dismissal subject to certain conditions. Although it is customary for a priest to serve as a curate in one or more parishes before becoming an incumbent, it is by no means unknown for priests who have previously been beneficed or consecrated bishop to return to a curacy (as assistant curate), sometimes as a matter of choice. For example, Geoffrey Francis Fisher served as Curate of Trent near Sherborne after retiring as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1961.

With the 1968 Pastoral Measure and subsequent legislation, the Church of England has undergone a major process of reform which still continues today, and much of above no longer holds good. Ministers in the Church of England whose main income comes from sources other than their work as clergy may be termed &quot;self-supporting ministers&quot; or &quot;curate (SSM)&quot;.

Terms like &quot;rector&quot; and &quot;curate&quot; were carried overseas with the spread of Anglicanism, but their exact meaning depends on local conditions and regulations. In the Church of Ireland some curates are styled &quot;bishop&#x27;s curates&quot; as they are accountable directly to the diocesan bishop, while sometimes mentored by local parish clergy, and are perceived to have more autonomy than other assistant curates. 

In Anglican parishes with a charismatic or evangelical (low church) tradition, the roles of curates are usually seen as being an assistant leader to the overall leader, often in a larger team of pastoral leaders. Many of the larger charismatic and evangelical parishes have larger ministry teams with a number of pastoral leaders, some ordained and others who are not.

In the Episcopal Church of the United States, the curacy may be a temporary place to continue training after ordination, similar to an internship, or it may be a permanent, subordinant position, more akin to a &quot;perpetual curate&quot;.

===Training===

In the Church of England, the ongoing training of assistant curates is typically overseen by officers of the bishops called Initial Ministerial Education (IME) or Continuing Ministerial Development (CMD) Advisers.

==History==
Originally a bishop would entrust a priest with the &quot;cure of souls&quot; (pastoral ministry) of a parish. When, in medieval Europe, this included the legal freehold of church land in the parish, the parish priest was a &quot;perpetual curate&quot; (), an assistant would be a (plain) curate ().

The words and distinguish their appointments but not the length of service, the apparent reference to time is accidental. A curate is appointed by the parish priest and paid from parish funds. A perpetual curate is a priest in charge of a parish who was (usually) appointed and paid by the bishop.

As the church became more embedded into the fabric of feudal Europe, various other titles often supplanted &quot;curate&quot; for the parish priest. &quot;Rector&quot; was the title given to a priest in possession of the tithe income. This right to the income was known as a &quot;living&quot;. The title of rector comes from , &#x27;to rule&#x27;.

Those parishes where a monastery had appropriated the rights to the tithe income, a portion of this income was set aside for a priest to occupy the parish, essentially acting on behalf of the monastery, in other words vicariously – hence &quot;vicar&quot;. In some cases, a portion of a tithe for a vicar could exceed the income of some rectors, depending on the value of the livings being compared.

==Minor canons==
Minor canons are those clergy who are members of a cathedral&#x27;s establishment and take part in the daily services but are not part of the formal chapter. These are generally clergy who are nearer to the beginning than the end of their ministries, who have already served their curacy (title post) in a parish church. They are often selected for their singing and liturgical ability.

<doc id="185251" wikidata="Q123304" url="?curid=185251" title="Antioquia Department">
<text>Antioquia () is one of the 32 departments of Colombia, located in the central northwestern part of Colombia with a narrow section that borders the Caribbean Sea. Most of its territory is mountainous with some valleys, much of which is part of the Andes mountain range. Antioquia has been part of many territorial divisions of former countries created within the present-day territory of Colombia. Before the adoption of the Colombian Constitution of 1886, Antioquia State had a sovereign government.

The department covers an area of , and has a population of 6,994,792 (2023). Antioquia borders the Córdoba Department and the Caribbean Sea to the north; Chocó to the west; the departments of Bolívar, Santander, and Boyaca to the east; and the departments of Caldas and Risaralda to the south.

Medellín is Antioquia&#x27;s capital and the second-largest city in the country. Other important towns are Santa Fe de Antioquia, the old capital located on the Cauca River, and Puerto Berrío on the Magdalena.

== Geography ==
Antioquia is the sixth-largest Department of Colombia. It is predominantly mountainous, crossed by the Cordillera Central and the Cordillera Occidental of the Andes. The Cordillera Central divides to form the Aburrá valley, in which the capital, Medellín, is located. The Cordillera Central forms the plateaus of Santa Rosa de Osos and Rionegro.

While 80% of the department&#x27;s territory is mountainous, Antioquia also has lowlands in Bajo Cauca, Magdalena Medio, and eastern Sonsón, as well as coastline on the Caribbean Sea, in Urabá. This area has a tropical climate and is of high strategic importance due to its location.

== Toponymy ==
The basis for the name Antioquia is uncertain. A common explanation is that it was named after the Hellenistic-founded city in Ottoman Syria of Antioch on the Orontes ( &quot;Antiocheia&quot;, Arabic: &quot;Antākiyyah&quot;, now officially Antakya, Turkey). The region of Colombia known as the Coffee Zone has a strong influence from Arab Jews, both demographically and culturally, and many towns and cities are named after cities in the Middle East. Moreover, ancient Antiochia played a significant role in developing the communities of early Christianity and thus was important to the Catholic Spaniard conquistadors.

There are many other cities in the Middle East named Antiochia, which were likewise named for the Antiochid rulers during the Seleucid Empire (312–63 BC).

== History ==

=== Native people of Antioquia ===

Before Spanish colonization, Indigenous peoples inhabited the Antioquia region. Some specialists believe they came from Caribbean Sea, while others say they came from the interior Amazon River.

Antioquia was primarily populated by the Kalina or &quot;Mainland Caribs.&quot; Some scattered groups of Muisca were said to be present in the Darién region, a coastal region in the far north that is now in Panama, but no historical records refer to Muisca in Antioquia.

The Kalina in Antioquia comprised smaller groups called families. The most prominent were the Catía, Nutabe, and Tahamí, who inhabited central Antioquia. The Quimbaya occupied southern Antioquia.

The Quimbaya, Kalina, and Muisca were the most prominent groups the conquistadores encountered upon their arrival in Antioquia.

The Spaniards had a turbulent history of encounters with the Carib. Although the tribe was numerous and known for its warring culture, the Spaniards dominated or exterminated them in the process of conquest and colonization. Like all indigenous peoples of the Americas, many died in virgin soil epidemics of diseases endemic to Eurasia.

Some surviving natives dispersed to evade the Spanish, and some committed suicide to escape slavery. Many survivors fled to what is now Chocó Department. Barely 0.5% of Antioquia&#x27;s population is Indigenous, but most residents have a significant Indigenous genetic component (26% on average).

=== Basque and Jewish influence in Antioquia ===

Spain&#x27;s Basque Country and Jews have influenced Antioquia and its language since the Spanish colonization. This began in 1499 during the third voyage of Columbus. The owner and master of the &quot;Santa María&quot;, second in command to Columbus, was Juan de la Cosa, nicknamed &quot;el Vizcaino&quot; (&quot;the Biscayan&quot;). Hundreds of Basques settled in the area, sponsored by the Spanish colonization companies.

==== Dialect ====
Immigrants influenced the Spanish spoken in Antioquia in several ways:
*Immigrants from Andalusia and the Canary Islands brought their preference for &quot;seseo&quot;, a uniform pronunciation of &quot;s&quot;, &quot;z&quot;, and soft &quot;c&quot;.
*However, those from Extremadura favored an apico-alveolar sound (part way to &quot;sh&quot;).
*The digraph &quot;ll&quot; (double L) is affricative, like English &quot;j&quot;.
*Certain words beginning with &quot;r&quot; are prefixed by &quot;a&quot; (with the &quot;r&quot; doubled to continue to indicate that it is trilled):
** instead of 
** instead of 
** instead of .
*Specific words have been adopted, such as (useless, inept) and (tap).

==== Local character ====
It has been asserted since the mid-nineteenth century that Basque and Jewish origins have influenced the character of Antioquia. Specific evidence of cultural contribution is sparse, perhaps partly because Basque is not dominant in Spain. However, American historian Everett Hagen sampled the Medellín telephone directory in 1957 and found that 15% of the surnames were of Basque origin, but 25% of the employers were. He concluded that Basque influence was important in explaining the increased industrial development of Antioquia in Colombia. The study reinforced notions of the character of social groups, though it has been criticized as stereotypical.

=== Spaniards in Antioquia ===
The first Spaniard known to have visited the territory now known as Antioquia was Rodrigo de Bastidas, who explored the area around the future site of Darién in 1500. Ten years later, Alonso de Ojeda founded San Sebastián de Urabá, 2 km from the present-day town of Necoclí. It was later destroyed by the natives. The first Spanish military incursion into Antioquia, however, was not made until 1537. An expedition commanded by Francisco César traveled through the lands of chief Dabeiba, arriving at the Cauca River. They were said to have taken important treasures from the indigenous people&#x27;s tombs. In response, the warriors of chief Nutibara harassed the Spaniards continually, and forced them to return to Urabá.

In 1541, the conquistador Jorge Robledo departed from the site of the future (1542) Spanish town of Arma, a little below Aguadas in the North of Caldas, to lead an expedition north on the Cauca River.

Farther north, Robledo would found the city of Santa Fe de Antioquia, which in 1813 was declared the capital of the sovereign and independent state of Antioquia, and remained the seat of the governate until 1826, when Medellín was designated the capital.

=== 16th to the 21st centuries ===
Due to its geographical isolation, being located among mountains, Antioquia suffered supply problems. Its topography did not allow for much agriculture, so the city became dependent upon trade, especially of gold and gin for the colonization of new land. Much of this trade was due to reforms passed after a 1785 visit from Juan Antonio Mon y Velarde, an inspector of the Spanish Crown. The Antioquia became colonizers and traders.

The department was hard hit by the Colombian conflict, with 30,000 people missing between 1997 and 2005.

&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and Citi announced in the year 2013 that Medellín, the capital of the Department of Antioquia, is the winner of the City of the Year competition, a global program developed in partnership with the Urban Land Institute to recognize the most innovative urban centers. Medellín was ranked above the other finalists, Tel Aviv and New York City.

== Administrative divisions ==

=== Regions and municipalities ===
Antioquia is divided into nine subregions to facilitate the Department&#x27;s administration. These nine regions contain a total of 125 municipalities. The nine subregions with their municipalities are:

== Demographics ==
The population of Antioquia is 6,994,792 (2023), of which more than half live in the metropolitan area of Medellín. The racial composition is:

* White / Mestizo (88.6%)
* Black or Afro-Colombian (10.9%)
* Indigenous or Amerindian (0.5%)

During the 16th and 18th centuries, Antioquia received many immigrants from Spain, especially northern Spain. Most Indigenous peoples died from the introduction of European diseases, and many of those who survived intermarried with early Spanish settlers, who were mostly men; later, Spanish women also began to immigrate. Thousands of Scottish and English who settled in Antioquia fought for the Colombian army during independence. During the 19th and 20th centuries, immigrants (including Jews) arrived from Italy, Germany, United Kingdom, France, Portugal, Lebanon, Israel, Palestina and Syria. Many people from Antioquia are referred to as Paisas, people of mainly Spanish ancestry, a lot of them Basque. There is a small Afro-Colombian and Zambo-Colombian (people of Indigenous and African descent) population originating in the majority of the Urabá subregion and the neighboring departments of Chocó, Córdoba and Sucre.

<text>A Hieronymus machine is any of the patented radionics devices invented by electrical engineer Thomas Galen Hieronymus (21 November 1895 – 21 February 1988). Hieronymus received a U.S. Patent for his invention in 1949, which was described in the patent application title as a device for &quot;detection of emanations from materials and measurement of the volumes thereof&quot;.

Skeptics and scientists consider the devices to be an example of pseudoscience and quackery.

==History==
===Design and function===

The original &quot;Radiation Analyzer&quot; consisted of a chamber to hold a sample of material, a glass prism to refract the &quot;eloptic&quot; emanations coming from it, and a copper wire probe on a rotating armature to adjust the angle formed by the prism and the probe. Supposedly, &quot;eloptic&quot; emanations are refracted by the prism at different angles depending on the material. The detected &quot;eloptic&quot; signals were fed to a three-stage vacuum tube RF amplifier and conducted to a flat touch plate surrounded by a copper wire bifilar coil. By stroking the touch plate an operator could supposedly feel a sensation of &quot;tingling&quot; or &quot;stickiness&quot; when the &quot;eloptic&quot; energy was detected. As such, a human nervous system is considered to be necessary to operate a Hieronymus Machine.

Hieronymus subsequently designed solid-state versions of his Analyzers, substituting germanium transistors for crystal prisms and tunable capacitors for the rotating armature. He also designed and built various specialized devices designed for specific functions, including analysis of living organisms and production of homeopathic remedies. The most well-known Hieronymus Machine is the Eloptic Medical Analyzer, which supposedly analyzes and transmits &quot;eloptic energy&quot; to diagnose and treat medical conditions in plants and animals.

The theory of operation on which Hieronymus Machines are based is that all matter emits a kind of &quot;radiation&quot; that is not electromagnetic, but exhibits some of the characteristics of both light and electricity. The quality of this emanation is unique to every kind of matter, and therefore can be utilized for detection and analysis. Hieronymus coined the term &quot;eloptic energy&quot; to describe this radiation (from the words &quot;electrical&quot; and &quot;optical&quot;). All of his machines were designed to detect and manipulate this &quot;eloptic energy&quot;. Eloptic emanations have never been detected by instruments designed to measure electromagnetic energies, no other evidence of their existence have been produced, and there is no mathematical theory of an eloptic field, so the theory is considered pseudoscientific and is not accepted by the scientific community.

===John W. Campbell and Hieronymus machines===
The inventions of Hieronymus were championed by &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; editor John W. Campbell in late 1950s and early 1960s editorials. A series of correspondences between the two men show that while Hieronymus was sure that someday his theories of eloptic energy would be proven and accepted by physical scientists, Campbell was convinced that the machines were based on psionics, related to the user&#x27;s paranormal or ESP powers.

As an example, Campbell believed one could create an eloptic receiver or similar device with the prisms and amplifiers represented by their cardboard or even schematic representations. Through the use of mental powers, such a machine would function as well as its &quot;real&quot; equivalent. In his autobiography, Hieronymus wrote, &quot;I appreciated Mr Campbell&#x27;s interest in my work, but over the years since then, I have concluded that he set back the acceptance of my work at least a hundred years by his continual emphasis on what he termed the supernatural or &#x27;magic&#x27; aspects of a mind-controlled device he built by drawing the schematic of my patented instrument with India ink. The energy flowed over the lines of this drawing because India ink is conducting, but it isn&#x27;t worth a tinker&#x27;s damn for serious research or actual treating.&quot;

==Scientific reception==

The claims of Hieronymus about &quot;eloptic&quot; emanations were heavily criticized by the scientific community as having no basis in reality. His machines have been compared to the quack devices of Albert Abrams and have also been described as an example of pseudoscience.

<text>The passacaglia (; ) is a musical form that originated in early seventeenth-century Spain and is still used today by composers. It is usually of a serious character and is typically based on a bass-ostinato and written in triple metre.

==Origin==
The term passacaglia (; ; Italian: &quot;passacaglia&quot;, &quot;passacaglio&quot;, &quot;passagallo&quot;, &quot;passacagli&quot;, &quot;passacaglie&quot;) derives from the Spanish &quot;pasar&quot; (cross, pass) and &quot;calle&quot; (street). It originated in early 17th-century Spain as a strummed interlude between instrumentally accompanied dances or songs. Despite the form&#x27;s Spanish roots (confirmed by references in Spanish literature of the period), the first written examples of passacaglias are found in an Italian source dated 1606. These pieces, as well as others from Italian sources from the beginning of the century, are simple, brief sequences of chords outlining a cadential formula.

The passacaglia was redefined in the late 1620s by Italian composer Girolamo Frescobaldi, who transformed it into a series of continuous variations over a bass (which itself may be varied). Later composers adopted this model, and by the nineteenth century the word came to mean a series of variations over an ostinato pattern, usually of a serious character. A similar form, the chaconne, was also first developed by Frescobaldi. The two genres are closely related, and since &quot;composers often used the terms chaconne and passacaglia indiscriminately ... modern attempts to arrive at a clear distinction are arbitrary and historically unfounded&quot;.

In early scholarship, attempts to formally differentiate between the historical chaconne and passacaglia were made, but researchers often came to opposite conclusions. For example, Percy Goetschius held that the chaconne is usually based on a harmonic sequence with a recurring soprano melody, and the passacaglia was formed over a ground bass pattern, whereas Clarence Lucas defined the two forms in precisely the opposite way. More recently, however, some progress has been made toward making a useful distinction for the usage of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, when some composers (notably Frescobaldi and François Couperin) deliberately mixed the two genres in the same composition.

The melodic pattern—usually four, six or eight (rarely seven) bars long—repeats without change through the duration of the piece, while the upper lines are varied freely, over the bass pattern serving as a harmonic anchor.

The seventeenth-century chaconne, as found in Frescobaldi&#x27;s music, more often than not is in a major key, while the passacaglia is usually in a minor key. In eighteenth-century French practice, the passacaglia leans more strongly to the melodic basso ostinato, while the chaconne, &quot;in a reversal of the [seventeenth-century] Italian practice, in various respects undergoes a freer treatment&quot;.

==Composers==
Some examples are the organ passacaglias of Johann Sebastian Bach, Dieterich Buxtehude, Johann Pachelbel, Sigfrid Karg-Elert, Johann Caspar Kerll, Daniel Gregory Mason, Georg Muffat, Gottlieb Muffat, Johann Kuhnau, Juan Bautista Cabanilles, Bernardo Pasquini, Max Reger, Ralph Vaughan Williams (&quot;Passacaglia on B–G–C&quot;, 1933), George Frideric Handel and Leo Sowerby.

Passacaglias for lute have been composed by figures such as Alessandro Piccinini, Giovanni Girolamo Kapsperger, Sylvius Leopold Weiss, Esaias Reusner, Count Logy, Robert de Visée, Jacques Bittner, , François Dufault, Jacques Gallot, Denis Gaultier, Ennemond Gaultier, and Roman Turovsky-Savchuk, a passacaglia for bandura by Julian Kytasty, and for baroque guitar by Paulo Galvão, Santiago de Murcia, Francisco Guerau, Gaspar Sanz, and Marcello Vitale.

===Baroque===
One of the best known examples of the passacaglia in Western classical music is the &quot;Passacaglia and Fugue in C minor, BWV 582&quot;, for organ by Johann Sebastian Bach. The French clavecinists, especially Louis Couperin and his nephew François Couperin, used a variant of the form—the &quot;passacaille en rondeau&quot;—with a recurring episode between the variations. Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber&#x27;s &quot;Passacaglia&quot;, the last piece of the monumental &quot;Rosary Sonatas&quot;, is one of the earliest known compositions for solo violin. The central episode of Claudio Monteverdi&#x27;s madrigal &quot;Lamento della Ninfa&quot; is a passacaglia on a descending tetrachord. The first two movements of the fourth sonata from Johann Heinrich Schmelzer&#x27;s &quot;Sonatæ unarum fidium&quot; are passacaglias on a descending tetrachord, but in uncharacteristic major. In 1650 or earlier, Andrea Falconieri published a passacalle movement &quot;à tre&quot;, &quot;basso continuo&quot;, in Naples. The fourth movement of Luigi Boccherini&#x27;s Quintettino No. 6, Op. 30, (also known as &quot;Musica notturna delle strade di Madrid&quot;) is titled &quot;Passacalle&quot;. The last movement of George Frideric Handel&#x27;s Harpsichord Suite in G minor (HWV 432) is a passacaglia which has become well known as a duo for violin and viola, arranged by the Norwegian violinist Johan Halvorsen.

Other examples of &quot;passacaille&quot; include &quot;Les plaisirs ont choisi&quot; from Jean-Baptiste Lully&#x27;s opera &quot;Armide&quot; (1686) and Dido&#x27;s Lament, &quot;When I am Laid in Earth&quot; from Henry Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot;, the aria &quot;Piango, gemo, sospiro&quot; by Antonio Vivaldi, or &quot;Usurpator tiranno&quot; and &quot;Stabat Mater&quot; by Giovanni Felice Sances, et al.

===Romantic===
Nineteenth-century examples include the C-minor passacaglia for organ by Felix Mendelssohn, and the finale of Josef Rheinberger&#x27;s Eighth Organ Sonata. Notable passacaglias by Johannes Brahms can be found in the last movement of his Fourth Symphony, which many musicians place among Brahms&#x27; finest compositions. Composed by Brahms to conform to the strict metrics of classical dance, British conductor Constant Lambert called the piece &quot;grimly intellectual&quot;. In Brahms&#x27;s &quot;Variations on a Theme by Haydn&quot;, the bass repeats the same harmonic pattern throughout the piece. The first movement of Hans Huber&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 3, Op. 113 (1899) is a passacaglia.

===Modern===
The passacaglia proved an enduring form throughout the twentieth century and beyond. In mid-century, one writer stated that &quot;despite the inevitable lag in the performance of new music, there are more twentieth-century passacaglias in the active repertory of performers than baroque works in this form&quot;. Three composers especially identified with the passacaglia are Benjamin Britten, Dmitri Shostakovich, and Paul Hindemith. In his operas, Britten often uses a passacaglia to create the climactic moment of the drama. Examples are found in &quot;Peter Grimes&quot;, &quot;Billy Budd&quot;, &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot;, &quot;Death in Venice&quot;, and even in the comic opera &quot;Albert Herring&quot;. Britten also employed the form in smaller vocal forms, such as the Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings (1943) and &quot;The Holy Sonnets of John Donne&quot; (1945) for voice and piano, as well as in purely instrumental compositions, notably in the Violin Concerto, the second and third Cello suites, the second and third string quartets, the Cello Symphony, and the &quot;Nocturnal after John Dowland&quot; for guitar. Shostakovich restricted his use of the passacaglia to instrumental forms, the most notable examples being found in his Interlude in Act II of the opera Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk, Tenth String Quartet, Second Piano Trio, Eighth and Fifteenth Symphonies, and First Violin Concerto. Hindemith employed the form to conclude his 1938 ballet, &quot;Nobilissima Visione&quot;, and it is also found in his early Sonata for viola solo, Op. 11, No. 5 (1919) and the second movement of the song cycle &quot;Das Marienleben&quot; (1948), as well as in later works such as the Fifth String Quartet and the Octet for winds and strings. Igor Stravinsky used the form for the central movement of his Septet (1953), a transitional work between his neoclassical and serial periods. A passacaglia is also found in the finale of Witold Lutosławski&#x27;s Concerto for Orchestra, and in the final movement of Caroline Shaw&#x27;s Partita for 8 Voices.

Especially important examples of the form are found in the output of the Second Viennese School. Anton Webern&#x27;s Opus 1 is a Passacaglia for Orchestra, Arnold Schoenberg included a passacaglia movement, &quot;Nacht&quot;, in &quot;Pierrot lunaire&quot;, and Alban Berg, like Britten, used a passacaglia operatically, in act 1, scene 4 of &quot;Wozzeck&quot;.

<doc id="185259" wikidata="Q1425837" url="?curid=185259" title="Germ theory of disease">
<text>The germ theory of disease is the currently accepted scientific theory for many diseases. It states that microorganisms known as pathogens or &quot;germs&quot; can cause disease. These small organisms, which are too small to be seen without magnification, invade animals, plants, and even bacteria. Their growth and reproduction within their hosts can cause disease. &quot;Germ&quot; refers not just to bacteria but to any type of microorganism, such as protists or fungi, or other pathogens, including parasites, viruses, prions, or viroids. Diseases caused by pathogens are called infectious diseases. Even when a pathogen is the principal cause of a disease, environmental and hereditary factors often influence the severity of the disease, and whether a potential host individual becomes infected when exposed to the pathogen. Pathogens are disease-causing agents that can pass from one individual to another, across multiple domains of life.

Basic forms of germ theory were proposed by Girolamo Fracastoro in 1546, and expanded upon by Marcus von Plenciz in 1762. However, such views were held in disdain in Europe, where Galen&#x27;s miasma theory remained dominant among scientists and doctors.

By the early 19th century, the first vaccine, smallpox vaccination was commonplace in Europe, though doctors were unaware of how it worked or how to extend the principle to other diseases. A transitional period began in the late 1850s with the work of Louis Pasteur. This work was later extended by Robert Koch in the 1880s. By the end of that decade, the miasma theory was struggling to compete with the germ theory of disease. Viruses were initially discovered in the 1890s. Eventually, a &quot;golden era&quot; of bacteriology ensued, during which the germ theory quickly led to the identification of the actual organisms that cause many diseases.

== Miasma theory ==

The miasma theory was the predominant theory of disease transmission before the germ theory took hold towards the end of the 19th century; it is no longer accepted as a correct explanation for disease by the scientific community. It held that diseases such as cholera, chlamydia infection, or the Black Death were caused by a (, Ancient Greek: &quot;pollution&quot;), a noxious form of &quot;bad air&quot; emanating from rotting organic matter. Miasma was considered to be a poisonous vapor or mist filled with particles from decomposed matter (miasmata) that was identifiable by its foul smell. The theory posited that diseases were the product of environmental factors such as contaminated water, foul air, and poor hygienic conditions. Such infections, according to the theory, were not passed between individuals but would affect those within a locale that gave rise to such vapors.

== Development of germ theory ==

===Greece and Rome===
In Antiquity, the Greek historian Thucydides ( – ) was the first person to write, in his account of the plague of Athens, that diseases could spread from an infected person to others.

One theory of the spread of contagious diseases that were not spread by direct contact was that they were spread by spore-like &quot;seeds&quot; (Latin: &quot;semina&quot;) that were present in and dispersible through the air. In his poem, &quot;De rerum natura&quot; (On the Nature of Things, ), the Roman poet Lucretius ( – ) stated that the world contained various &quot;seeds&quot;, some of which could sicken a person if they were inhaled or ingested.

The Roman statesman Marcus Terentius Varro (116–27 BC) wrote, in his &quot;Rerum rusticarum libri III&quot; (Three Books on Agriculture, 36 BC): &quot;Precautions must also be taken in the neighborhood of swamps... because there are bred certain minute creatures which cannot be seen by the eyes, which float in the air and enter the body through the mouth and nose and there cause serious diseases.&quot;

The Greek physician Galen (AD 129 – ) speculated in his &quot;On Initial Causes&quot; () that some patients might have &quot;seeds of fever&quot;. In his &quot;On the Different Types of Fever&quot; (), Galen speculated that plagues were spread by &quot;certain seeds of plague&quot;, which were present in the air. And in his &quot;Epidemics&quot; (), Galen explained that patients might relapse during recovery from fever because some &quot;seed of the disease&quot; lurked in their bodies, which would cause a recurrence of the disease if the patients did not follow a physician&#x27;s therapeutic regimen.

===The Middle Ages===
A hybrid form of miasma and contagion theory was proposed by Persian physician Ibn Sina (known as Avicenna in Europe) in &quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot; (1025). He mentioned that people can transmit disease to others by breath, noted contagion with tuberculosis, and discussed the transmission of disease through water and dirt.

During the early Middle Ages, Isidore of Seville (–636) mentioned &quot;plague-bearing seeds&quot; (&quot;pestifera semina&quot;) in his &quot;On the Nature of Things&quot; (). Later in 1345, Tommaso del Garbo (–1370) of Bologna, Italy mentioned Galen&#x27;s &quot;seeds of plague&quot; in his work &quot;Commentaria non-parum utilia in libros Galeni&quot; (Helpful commentaries on the books of Galen).

The 16th century Reformer Martin Luther appears to have had some idea of the contagion theory, commenting, &quot;I have survived three plagues and visited several people who had two plague spots which I touched. But it did not hurt me, thank God. Afterwards when I returned home, I took up Margaret,&quot; (born 1534), &quot;who was then a baby, and put my unwashed hands on her face, because I had forgotten; otherwise I should not have done it, which would have been tempting God.&quot; In 1546, Italian physician Girolamo Fracastoro published &quot;De Contagione et Contagiosis Morbis&quot; (&quot;On Contagion and Contagious Diseases&quot;), a set of three books covering the nature of contagious diseases, categorization of major pathogens, and theories on preventing and treating these conditions. Fracastoro blamed &quot;seeds of disease&quot; that propagate through direct contact with an infected host, indirect contact with fomites, or through particles in the air.

===The Early Modern Period===

In 1668, Italian physician Francesco Redi published experimental evidence rejecting spontaneous generation, the theory that living creatures arise from nonliving matter. He observed that maggots only arose from rotting meat that was uncovered. When meat was left in jars covered by gauze, the maggots would instead appear on the gauze&#x27;s surface, later understood as rotting meat&#x27;s smell passing through the mesh to attract flies that laid eggs.

Microorganisms are said to have been first directly observed in the 1670s by Anton van Leeuwenhoek, an early pioneer in microbiology, considered &quot;the Father of Microbiology&quot;. Leeuwenhoek is said to be the first to see and describe bacteria in 1674, yeast cells, the teeming life in a drop of water (such as algae), and the circulation of blood corpuscles in capillaries. The word &quot;bacteria&quot; didn&#x27;t exist yet, so he called these microscopic living organisms &quot;animalcules&quot;, meaning &quot;little animals&quot;. Those &quot;very little animalcules&quot; he was able to isolate from different sources, such as rainwater, pond and well water, and the human mouth and intestine. 

Yet German Jesuit priest and scholar Athanasius Kircher (or &quot;Kirchner&quot;, as it is often spelled) may have observed such microorganisms prior to this. One of his books written in 1646 contains a chapter in Latin, which reads in translation: &quot;Concerning the wonderful structure of things in nature, investigated by microscope...who would believe that vinegar and milk abound with an innumerable multitude of worms.&quot; Kircher defined the invisible organisms found in decaying bodies, meat, milk, and secretions as &quot;worms.&quot; His studies with the microscope led him to the belief, which he was possibly the first to hold, that disease and putrefaction, or decay were caused by the presence of invisible living bodies, writing that &quot;a number of things might be discovered in the blood of fever patients.&quot; When Rome was struck by the bubonic plague in 1656, Kircher investigated the blood of plague victims under the microscope. He noted the presence of &quot;little worms&quot; or &quot;animalcules&quot; in the blood and concluded that the disease was caused by microorganisms. 

Kircher was the first to attribute infectious disease to a microscopic pathogen, inventing the germ theory of disease, which he outlined in his &quot;Scrutinium Physico-Medicum&quot;, published in Rome in 1658. Kircher&#x27;s conclusion that disease was caused by microorganisms was correct, although it is likely that what he saw under the microscope were in fact red or white blood cells and not the plague agent itself. Kircher also proposed hygienic measures to prevent the spread of disease, such as isolation, quarantine, burning clothes worn by the infected, and wearing facemasks to prevent the inhalation of germs. It was Kircher who first proposed that living beings enter and exist in the blood.

In the 18th century, more proposals were made, but struggled to catch on. In 1700, physician Nicolas Andry argued that microorganisms he called &quot;worms&quot; were responsible for smallpox and other diseases. In 1720, Richard Bradley theorised that the plague and &quot;all pestilential distempers&quot; were caused by &quot;poisonous insects&quot;, living creatures viewable only with the help of microscopes.

In 1762, the Austrian physician Marcus Antonius von Plenciz (1705–1786) published a book titled &quot;Opera medico-physica&quot;. It outlined a theory of contagion stating that specific animalcules in the soil and the air were responsible for causing specific diseases. Von Plenciz noted the distinction between diseases which are both epidemic and contagious (like measles and dysentery), and diseases which are contagious but not epidemic (like rabies and leprosy). The book cites Anton van Leeuwenhoek to show how ubiquitous such animalcules are and was unique for describing the presence of germs in ulcerating wounds. Ultimately, the theory espoused by von Plenciz was not accepted by the scientific community.

=== 19th and 20th centuries ===
==== Agostino Bassi, Italy ====
During the early 19th century, driven by economic concerns over collapsing silk production, Italian entomologist Agostino Bassi researched a silkworm disease known as &quot;muscardine&quot; in French and &quot;calcinaccio&quot; or &quot;mal del segno&quot; in Italian, causing white fungal spots along the caterpillar. From 1835 to 1836, Bassi published his findings that fungal spores transmitted the disease between individuals. In recommending the rapid removal of diseased caterpillars and disinfection of their surfaces, Bassi outlined methods used in modern preventative healthcare. Italian naturalist Giuseppe Gabriel Balsamo-Crivelli named the causative fungal species after Bassi, currently classified as &quot;Beauveria bassiana&quot;.

==== Louis-Daniel Beauperthuy, France ====
In 1838 French specialist in tropical medicine Louis-Daniel Beauperthuy pioneered using microscopy in relation to diseases and independently developed a theory that all infectious diseases were due to parasitic infection with &quot;animalcules&quot; (microorganisms). With the help of his friend M. Adele de Rosseville, he presented his theory in a formal presentation before the French Academy of Sciences in Paris. By 1853, he was convinced that malaria and yellow fever were spread by mosquitos. He even identified the particular group of mosquitos that transmit yellow fever as the &quot;domestic species&quot; of &quot;striped-legged mosquito&quot;, which can be recognised as &quot;Aedes aegypti&quot;, the actual vector. He published his theory in 1854 in the Gaceta Oficial de Cumana (&quot;Official Gazette of Cumana&quot;). His reports were assessed by an official commission, which discarded his mosquito theory.

==== Ignaz Semmelweis, Austria ====
Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian obstetrician working at the Vienna General Hospital (&quot;Allgemeines Krankenhaus&quot;) in 1847, noticed the dramatically high maternal mortality from puerperal fever following births assisted by doctors and medical students. However, those attended by midwives were relatively safe. Investigating further, Semmelweis made the connection between puerperal fever and examinations of delivering women by doctors, and further realized that these physicians had usually come directly from autopsies. Asserting that puerperal fever was a contagious disease and that matter from autopsies was implicated in its spread, Semmelweis made doctors wash their hands with chlorinated lime water before examining pregnant women. He then documented a sudden reduction in the mortality rate from 18% to 2.2% over a period of a year. Despite this evidence, he and his theories were rejected by most of the contemporary medical establishment.

==== Gideon Mantell, UK ====

Gideon Mantell, the Sussex doctor more famous for discovering dinosaur fossils, spent time with his microscope, and speculated in his &quot;Thoughts on Animalcules&quot; (1850) that perhaps &quot;many of the most serious maladies which afflict humanity, are produced by peculiar states of invisible animalcular life&quot;.

==== John Snow, UK ====

British physician John Snow is credited as a founder of modern epidemiology for studying the 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak. Snow criticized the Italian anatomist Giovanni Maria Lancisi for his early 18th century writings that claimed swamp miasma spread malaria, rebutting that bad air from decomposing organisms was not present in all cases. In his 1849 pamphlet &quot;On the Mode of Communication of Cholera,&quot; Snow proposed that cholera spread through the fecal–oral route, replicating in human lower intestines.

In the book&#x27;s second edition, published in 1855, Snow theorized that cholera was caused by cells smaller than human epithelial cells, leading to Robert Koch&#x27;s 1884 confirmation of the bacterial species &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot; as the causative agent. In recognizing a biological origin, Snow recommended boiling and filtering water, setting the precedent for modern boil-water advisory directives.

Through a statistical analysis tying cholera cases to specific water pumps associated with the Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company, which supplied sewage-polluted water from the River Thames, Snow showed that areas supplied by this company experienced fourteen times as many deaths as residents using Lambeth Waterworks Company pumps that obtained water from the upriver, cleaner Seething Wells. While Snow received praise for convincing the Board of Guardians of St James&#x27;s Parish to remove the handles of contaminated pumps, he noted that the outbreak&#x27;s cases were already declining as scared residents fled the region.

==== Louis Pasteur, France ====

During the mid-19th century, French microbiologist Louis Pasteur showed that treating the female genital tract with boric acid killed the microorganisms causing postpartum infections while avoiding damage to mucous membranes.

Building on Redi&#x27;s work, Pasteur disproved spontaneous generation by constructing swan neck flasks containing nutrient broth. Since the flask contents were only fermented when in direct contact with the external environment&#x27;s air by removing the curved tubing, Pasteur demonstrated that bacteria must travel between sites of infection to colonize environments.

Similar to Bassi, Pasteur extended his research on germ theory by studying pébrine, a disease that causes brown spots on silkworms. While Swiss botanist Carl Nägeli discovered the fungal species &quot;Nosema bombycis&quot; in 1857, Pasteur applied the findings to recommend improved ventilation and screening of silkworm eggs, an early form of disease surveillance.

==== Robert Koch, Germany ====
In 1884, German bacteriologist Robert Koch published four criteria for establishing causality between specific microorganisms and diseases, now known as Koch&#x27;s postulates:
# The microorganism must be found in abundance in all organisms with the disease, but should not be found in healthy organisms.
# The microorganism must be isolated from a diseased organism and grown in pure culture.
# The cultured microorganism should cause disease when introduced into a healthy organism.
# The microorganism must be re-isolated from the inoculated, diseased experimental host and identified as being identical to the original specific causative agent.

During his lifetime, Koch recognized that the postulates were not universally applicable, such as asymptomatic carriers of cholera violating the first postulate. For this same reason, the third postulate specifies &quot;should&quot;, rather than &quot;must&quot;, because not all host organisms exposed to an infectious agent will acquire the infection, potentially due to differences in prior exposure to the pathogen. Limiting the second postulate, it was later discovered that viruses cannot be grown in pure cultures because they are obligate intracellular parasites, making it impossible to fulfill the second postulate. Similarly, pathogenic misfolded proteins, known as prions, only spread by transmitting their structure to other proteins, rather than self-replicating.

While Koch&#x27;s postulates retain historical importance for emphasizing that correlation does not imply causation, many pathogens are accepted as causative agents of specific diseases without fulfilling all of the criteria. In 1988, American microbiologist Stanley Falkow published a molecular version of Koch&#x27;s postulates to establish correlation between microbial genes and virulence factors.

==== Joseph Lister, UK ====
After reading Pasteur&#x27;s papers on bacterial fermentation, British surgeon Joseph Lister recognized that compound fractures, involving bones breaking through the skin, were more likely to become infected due to exposure to environmental microorganisms. He recognized that carbolic acid could be applied to the site of injury as an effective antiseptic.

<text>Haloperidol, sold under the brand name Haldol among others, is a typical antipsychotic medication. Haloperidol is used in the treatment of schizophrenia, tics in Tourette syndrome, mania in bipolar disorder, delirium, agitation, acute psychosis, and hallucinations from alcohol withdrawal. It may be used by mouth or injection into a muscle or a vein. Haloperidol typically works within 30 to 60 minutes. A long-acting formulation may be used as an injection every four weeks for people with schizophrenia or related illnesses, who either forget or refuse to take the medication by mouth.
Haloperidol may result in movement disorders such as tardive dyskinesia, and akathisia both of which may be permanent. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome and QT interval prolongation may occur, the latter particularly with IV administration. In older people with psychosis due to dementia it results in an increased risk of death. When taken during pregnancy it may result in problems in the infant. It should not be used by people with Parkinson&#x27;s disease.
Haloperidol was discovered in 1958 by the team of Paul Janssen, prepared as part of a structure-activity relationship investigation into analogs of pethidine (meperidine). It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is the most commonly used typical antipsychotic. In 2020, it was the 303rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1million prescriptions.

== Medical uses ==
Haloperidol is used in the control of the symptoms of:

* Acute psychosis, such as drug-induced psychosis caused by ketamine, and phencyclidine, and psychosis associated with high fever or metabolic disease. Some evidence has found haloperidol to worsen psychosis due to psilocybin.
* Adjunctive treatment of alcohol and opioid withdrawal
* Agitation and confusion associated with cerebral sclerosis
* Alcohol-induced psychosis
* Hallucinations in alcohol withdrawal
* Hyperactive delirium (to control the agitation component of delirium)
* Hyperactivity, aggression
* Otherwise uncontrollable, severe behavioral disorders in children and adolescents
* Schizophrenia
* Therapeutic trial in personality disorders, such as borderline personality disorder
* Treatment of intractable hiccups
* Treatment of neurological disorders, including tic disorders such as Tourette syndrome, and chorea
* Treatment of severe nausea and emesis in postoperative and palliative care, especially for palliating adverse effects of radiation therapy and chemotherapy in oncology. Also used as a first line antiemetic for acute cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome.
* As chemical restraint in acute care psychiatry, mainly for violent and self-harming patients (controversial use but very commonly found in movies).

Haloperidol was considered indispensable for treating psychiatric emergency situations. However, the newer atypical drugs have gained a greater role in a number of situations, as outlined in a series of consensus reviews published between 2001 and 2005.

In a 2013 comparison of 15 antipsychotics in schizophrenia, haloperidol demonstrated standard effectiveness. It was 13–16% more effective than ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, and asenapine, approximately as effective as quetiapine and aripiprazole, and 10% less effective than paliperidone. A 2013 systematic review compared haloperidol to placebo in schizophrenia:

In contrast to certain other antipsychotics like risperidone, haloperidol is ineffective as a hallucinogen antidote or &quot;trip killer&quot; in blocking the effects of serotonergic psychedelics like psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD).

=== Pregnancy and lactation ===

Data from animal experiments indicate haloperidol is not teratogenic, but is embryotoxic in high doses. In humans, no controlled studies exist. Reports in pregnant women revealed possible damage to the fetus, although most of the women were exposed to multiple drugs during pregnancy. In addition, reports indicate neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery, such as agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorder. Following accepted general principles, haloperidol should be given during pregnancy only if the benefit to the mother clearly outweighs the potential fetal risk.

Haloperidol is excreted in breast milk. A few studies have examined the impact of haloperidol exposure on breastfed infants and in most cases, there were no adverse effects on infant growth and development.

=== Other considerations ===
During long-term treatment of chronic psychiatric disorders, the daily dose should be reduced to the lowest level needed for maintenance of remission. Sometimes, it may be indicated to terminate haloperidol treatment gradually. In addition, during long-term use, routine monitoring including measurement of BMI, blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, and lipids, is recommended due to the risk of side effects.

Other forms of therapy (psychotherapy, occupational therapy/ergotherapy, or social rehabilitation) should be instituted properly.
PET imaging studies have suggested low doses are preferable. Clinical response was associated with at least 65% occupancy of D2 receptors, while greater than 72% was likely to cause hyperprolactinaemia and over 78% associated with extrapyramidal side effects. Doses of haloperidol greater than 5 mg increased the risk of side effects without improving efficacy. Patients responded with doses under even 2 mg in first-episode psychosis. For maintenance treatment of schizophrenia, an international consensus conference recommended a reduction dosage by about 20% every 6 months until a minimal maintenance dose is established.
* Depot forms are also available; these are injected deeply intramuscularly at regular intervals. The depot forms are not suitable for initial treatment, but are suitable for patients who have demonstrated inconsistency with oral dosages.

The decanoate ester of haloperidol (haloperidol decanoate, trade names Haldol decanoate, Halomonth, Neoperidole) has a much longer duration of action, so is often used in people known to be noncompliant with oral medication. A dose is given by intramuscular injection once every two to four weeks. The IUPAC name of haloperidol decanoate is [4-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-oxobutyl]piperidin-4-yl] decanoate.

Topical formulations of haloperidol should not be used as treatment for nausea because research does not indicate this therapy is more effective than alternatives.

== Adverse effects ==
Sources for the following lists of adverse effects:

As haloperidol is a high-potency typical antipsychotic, it tends to produce significant extrapyramidal side effects. According to a 2013 meta-analysis of the comparative efficacy and tolerability of 15 antipsychotic drugs it was the most prone of the 15 for causing extrapyramidal side effects.

With more than 6 months of use 14 percent of users gain weight. Haloperidol may be neurotoxic.

Prolonged use of the drug can lead to mental dependence.

=== Contraindications ===
* Pre-existing coma, acute stroke
* Severe intoxication with alcohol or other central depressant drugs
* Known allergy against haloperidol or other butyrophenones or other drug ingredients
* Known heart disease, when combined will tend towards cardiac arrest

=== Special cautions ===
* A multiple-year study suggested this drug and other neuroleptic antipsychotic drugs commonly given to people with Alzheimer&#x27;s with mild behavioral problems often make their condition worse and its withdrawal was even beneficial for some cognitive and functional measures. 
* Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis: analysis of 17 trials showed the risk of death in this group of patients was 1.6 to 1.7 times that of placebo-treated patients. Most of the causes of death were either cardiovascular or infectious in nature. It is not clear to what extent this observation is attributed to antipsychotic drugs rather than the characteristics of the patients. The drug bears a boxed warning about this risk.
* Impaired liver function, as haloperidol is metabolized and eliminated mainly by the liver
* In patients with hyperthyroidism, the action of haloperidol is intensified and side effects are more likely.
* IV injections: risk of hypotension or orthostatic collapse
* Patients at special risk for the development of QT prolongation (hypokalemia, concomitant use of other drugs causing QT prolongation)
* Patients with a history of leukopenia: a complete blood count should be monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and discontinuation of the drug should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in white blood cells.
* Pre-existing Parkinson&#x27;s disease or dementia with Lewy bodies

=== Interactions ===
* Amiodarone: Q-Tc interval prolongation (potentially dangerous change in heart rhythm).
* Amphetamine and methylphenidate: counteracts increased action of norepinephrine and dopamine in patients with narcolepsy or ADD/ADHD
* Epinephrine: action antagonized, paradoxical decrease in blood pressure may result
* Guanethidine: antihypertensive action antagonized
* Levodopa: decreased action of levodopa
* Lithium: rare cases of the following symptoms have been noted: encephalopathy, early and late extrapyramidal side effects, other neurologic symptoms, and coma.
* Methyldopa: increased risk of extrapyramidal side effects and other unwanted central effects
* Other central depressants (alcohol, tranquilizers, narcotics): actions and side effects of these drugs (sedation, respiratory depression) are increased. In particular, the doses of concomitantly used opioids for chronic pain can be reduced by 50%.
* Other drugs metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme system: inducers such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and rifampicin decrease plasma levels and inhibitors such as quinidine, buspirone, and fluoxetine increase plasma levels
* Tricyclic antidepressants: metabolism and elimination of tricyclics significantly decreased, increased toxicity noted (anticholinergic and cardiovascular side effects, lowering of seizure threshold)

=== Potential neurotoxicity ===
Several lines of evidence suggest that haloperidol exhibits neurotoxicity. Some studies report an association between antipsychotic medications, especially first-generation agents, and a decline in gray matter volume. Haloperidol irreversibly blocks the sigma σ1 receptor. It may exert deleterious effects on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) by attenuating brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) transcription and expression, associated with an increase in the long non-coding RNA BDNF-AS in the DLPFC. Besides the preceding mechanisms, haloperidol metabolizes into HPP+, a monoaminergic neurotoxin related to MPTP. This might be involved in the extrapyramidal symptoms that develop with long-term haloperidol therapy.

===Discontinuation===
The British National Formulary recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotics to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. Symptoms of withdrawal commonly include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Other symptoms may include restlessness, increased sweating, and trouble sleeping. Less commonly there may be a feeling of the world spinning, numbness, or muscle pains. Symptoms generally resolve after a short period of time.

There is tentative evidence that discontinuation of antipsychotics can result in psychosis. It may also result in reoccurrence of the condition that is being treated. Rarely tardive dyskinesia can occur when the medication is stopped.

== Overdose ==
=== Symptoms ===
Symptoms are usually due to side effects. Most often encountered are:

* Anticholinergic side effects (dry mouth, constipation, paralytic ileus, difficulties in urinating, decreased perspiration)
* Coma in severe cases, accompanied by respiratory depression and massive hypotension, shock
* Hypotension or hypertension
* Rarely, serious ventricular arrhythmia (&quot;torsades de pointes&quot;), with or without prolonged QT-time
* Sedation
* Severe extrapyramidal side effects with muscle rigidity and tremors, akathisia, etc.

=== Treatment ===
Treatment is mostly symptomatic and involves intensive care with stabilization of vital functions. In early detected cases of oral overdose, induction of emesis, gastric lavage, and the use of activated charcoal can be tried. In the case of a severe overdose, antidotes such as bromocriptine or ropinirole may be used to treat the extrapyramidal effects caused by haloperidol, acting as dopamine receptor agonists. ECG and vital signs should be monitored especially for QT prolongation and severe arrhythmias should be treated with antiarrhythmic measures.

=== Prognosis ===
An overdose of haloperidol can be fatal, but in general the prognosis after overdose is good, provided the person has survived the initial phase.

== Pharmacology ==
Haloperidol is a typical butyrophenone-type antipsychotic that exhibits high-affinity dopamine D2 receptor antagonism and slow receptor dissociation kinetics. It has effects similar to the phenothiazines. The drug binds preferentially to D2 and α1 receptors at low dose (ED50 = 0.13 and 0.42 mg/kg, respectively), and 5-HT2 receptors at a higher dose (ED50 = 2.6 mg/kg). Given that antagonism of D2 receptors is more beneficial on the positive symptoms of schizophrenia and antagonism of 5-HT2 receptors on the negative symptoms, this characteristic underlies haloperidol&#x27;s greater effect on delusions, hallucinations and other manifestations of psychosis. Haloperidol&#x27;s negligible affinity for histamine H1 receptors and muscarinic M1 acetylcholine receptors yields an antipsychotic with a lower incidence of sedation, weight gain, and orthostatic hypotension though having higher rates of treatment emergent extrapyramidal symptoms.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
==== By mouth ====
The bioavailability of oral haloperidol ranges from 60 to 70%. However, there is a wide variance in reported mean Tmax and T1/2 in different studies, ranging from 1.7 to 6.1 hours and 14.5 to 36.7 hours respectively.

==== Intramuscular injections ====
The drug is well and rapidly absorbed with a high bioavailability when injected intramuscularly. The Tmax is 20 minutes in healthy individuals and 33.8 minutes in patients with schizophrenia. The mean T1/2 is 20.7 hours. The decanoate injectable formulation is for intramuscular administration only and is not intended to be used intravenously. The plasma concentrations of haloperidol decanoate reach a peak at about six days after the injection, falling thereafter, with an approximate half-life of three weeks.

==== Intravenous injections ====
The bioavailability is 100% in intravenous (IV) injection, and the very rapid onset of action is seen within seconds. The T1/2 is 14.1 to 26.2 hours. The apparent volume of distribution is between 9.5 and 21.7 L/kg. The duration of action is four to six hours.

==== Therapeutic concentrations ====
Plasma levels of five to 15 micrograms per liter are typically seen for therapeutic response (Ulrich S, et al. Clin Pharmacokinet. 1998). The determination of plasma levels is rarely used to calculate dose adjustments but can be useful to check compliance.

The concentration of haloperidol in brain tissue is about 20-fold higher compared to blood levels. It is slowly eliminated from brain tissue, which may explain the slow disappearance of side effects when the medication is stopped.

==== Distribution and metabolism ====
Haloperidol is heavily protein bound in human plasma, with a free fraction of only 7.5 to 11.6%. It is also extensively metabolized in the liver with only about 1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. The greatest proportion of the hepatic clearance is by glucuronidation, followed by reduction and CYP-mediated oxidation, primarily by CYP3A4. Haloperidol is metabolized into HPP+, a monoaminergic neurotoxin related to MPTP, by CYP3A enzymes.

== Chemistry ==
Haloperidol is a crystalline material with a melting temperature of 150 °C. This drug has very low solubility in water (1.4 mg/100 mL), but it is soluble in chloroform, benzene, methanol, and acetone. It is also soluble in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid (3 mg/mL) with heating.

== History ==
Haloperidol was discovered by Paul Janssen. It was developed in 1958 at the Belgian company Janssen Pharmaceutica and submitted to the first of clinical trials in Belgium later that year.

Haloperidol was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 12 April 1967; it was later marketed in the U.S. and other countries under the brand name Haldol by McNeil Laboratories.

==Society and culture==

===Cost===
Haloperidol is relatively inexpensive, being up to 100 fold less expensive than newer antipsychotics.

=== Names ===
Haloperidol is the INN, BAN, USAN, AAN approved name.

It is sold under the tradenames Aloperidin, Bioperidolo, Brotopon, Dozic, Duraperidol (Germany), Einalon S, Eukystol, Haldol (common tradename in the US and UK), Halol, Halosten, Keselan, Linton, Peluces, Serenace Norodol (Turkey) and Sigaperidol.

==Research==
Haloperidol was under investigation for the treatment of depression. It was employed as a short-term low-dose dopamine receptor antagonist to upregulate dopamine receptors and produce receptor supersensitivity followed by drug withdrawal as a means of treating depression.

==Veterinary use==
Haloperidol is also used on many different kinds of animals for nonselective tranquilization and diminishing behavioral arousal, in veterinary and other settings including captivity management.

<text>The Star Wars Holiday Special is an American television special originally broadcast by CBS on November 17, 1978. It is set in the universe of the sci-fi-based &quot;Star Wars&quot; media franchise. Directed by Steve Binder, it was the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; spin-off film, set between the events of the original film and the yet-to-be-released sequel &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980). It stars the main cast of the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; and introduces the character of Boba Fett, who appeared in later films.

In the storyline that ties the special together, following the events of the original film, Chewbacca and Han Solo attempt to visit the Wookiee home planet of Kashyyyk to celebrate &quot;Life Day&quot;. They are pursued by agents of the Galactic Empire, who are searching for members of the Rebel Alliance on the planet. The special introduces three members of Chewbacca&#x27;s family: his father Itchy, his wife Malla, and his son Lumpy.

The program also features the rest of the main &quot;Star Wars&quot; characters, including Luke Skywalker, C-3PO, R2-D2, Darth Vader and Princess Leia, all portrayed by the original cast (except , who is simply billed as &quot;himself&quot;). The program includes footage from the 1977 film and a cartoon produced by Toronto-based Nelvana featuring the bounty hunter Boba Fett. Scenes take place in space and in spacecraft including the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; and a Star Destroyer; segments also take place in a few other locales such as the Mos Eisley cantina from the original film.

The special was very poorly received, and has never been rebroadcast nor officially released on home video in any format in its entirety (save for its more favorably-received cartoon segment). It has become something of a cultural legend due to the underground quality of its existence. It has been viewed and distributed in off-air recordings of the original 1978 CBS television broadcast by fans as bootleg copies, and it has also been uploaded to content-sharing websites.

==Plot==
On Life Day, Chewbacca, accompanied by Han Solo, is headed home to see his family. Along the way, the duo is chased by two Star Destroyers, but they escape into hyperspace. Meanwhile, on Kashyyyk, Chewbacca&#x27;s family is preparing for his return. Hoping to find the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;, his wife, Malla, runs a computer scan for starships in the area but is unsuccessful.

Malla contacts Luke Skywalker, who, along with R2-D2, is working on his X-wing fighter. Luke tells her that he does not know what happened. Malla contacts Saun Dann, a local trader. He tells her through a carefully worded message that Han and Chewbacca are on their way and should be arriving soon.

Malla then attempts (unsuccessfully) to prepare a meal, the instructions of which are being aired via a local cooking show by an eccentric four-armed alien cook, Chef Gormaanda (Harvey Korman).

Saun arrives with Life Day gifts for everyone, including a virtual reality fantasy program (featuring Diahann Carroll) for Itchy. Back on the &quot;Falcon&quot;, Chewbacca and Han have just come out of hyperspace not far from Kashyyyk. Han notices an increased Imperial presence, so they decide to land in an unguarded area to the north.

As they enter the atmosphere, Lumpy hears the roaring of the ship. Believing Han and Chewie might be arriving, Malla opens the door, but instead finds two stormtroopers and officers. The Imperials force their way into the house. An officer orders a search for Chewbacca.

As they search, Saun and the others attempt to distract them with food and Malla&#x27;s music video box (which features a video by Jefferson Starship). When the music finishes, the head officer orders the search to continue. The head officer tells Malla to keep Lumpy busy while they search his room, so Lumpy (and the viewing audience) uses a viewscreen to watch a cartoon of his father&#x27;s many adventures:

During a search for a talisman, the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; crashes on the water moon of Panna with the main characters onboard. They run into Boba Fett, who saves Luke from a giant monster and claims to want to help the Rebels. They all board the &quot;Falcon&quot;, where Han has been infected by a mysterious sleeping virus caused by the talisman. Luke then contracts the virus as well. Fett and Chewie go into Panna City to get the cure. Once they get into the Imperial-occupied city, Fett instructs Chewie to stay behind—so he can contact Darth Vader. On the &quot;Falcon&quot;, as C-3PO is caring for Han and Luke, R2-D2 intercepts the transmission between Vader and Fett. Evading the Imperials, Fett and Chewie return to the &quot;Falcon&quot; with the cure. After everyone recovers from the virus, they learn of Fett&#x27;s true allegiances. He blasts away using his jetpack, promising they will meet again. The heroes head back to the Rebel base aboard the &quot;Falcon&quot;.

Lumpy works to create a translation device that will fool the Imperials into returning to their base by faking their commander&#x27;s voice. To do so, he first must watch the manual for the device, being presented by a malfunctioning, incompetent robot (also played by Korman). While the Imperials are searching downstairs, the living room viewscreen activates, announcing that Tatooine is being put under curfew by the Empire because of &quot;subversive forces&quot;.

The video is announced as required viewing for all Imperial forces and much of it features Ackmena (Bea Arthur) running the Mos Eisley cantina. Ackmena is approached by an admirer: Krelman, an amorous alien, who has misunderstood something she said to him recently. Ackmena announces last call, and upon being ignored, sings a farewell song.

Lumpy uses this opportunity to put his plan into motion, faking a repeated call for the Imperials to &quot;return to base&quot;. They leave, but one stormtrooper stays behind and realizes that they were tricked. He finds Lumpy and destroys the machine, then chases Lumpy outside.

Han and Chewbacca arrive. Chewie protects Lumpy as Han kills the stormtrooper. After they are reunited, an Imperial officer appears on the viewscreen, giving a general alert for the missing stormtrooper. Saun quickly responds that the trooper stole supplies and deserted. The danger averted, the family prepares to go to the festival at the great Tree of Life. They hold glowing orbs, and appear in space wearing red robes.

Wookiees walk into a bright star and arrive at the Tree of Life, where many are gathered, including C-3PO and R2-D2. Luke, Leia, and Han also appear. Leia gives a short speech and sings a song in celebration. Chewie remembers his adventures during the events of the original film. Finally, the Wookiee family sits around a table and bow their heads.

Kenny Baker, who played in the films, was not involved in the special. The droid was performed entirely by a radio-controlled unit, operated by Mick Garris (Lucas&#x27;s receptionist). In the credits, R2-D2 is credited by announcer Art James as playing himself.

Because James Earl Jones was originally uncredited in &quot;Star Wars&quot;, the special marked the first time he was credited as the voice of Darth Vader.

Malla&#x27;s mask was repurposed from a Chewbacca mask from the original film. The names of Chewbacca&#x27;s family were later explained to have been nicknames, their full names being Mallatobuck (Malla), Attichitcuk (Itchy), and Lumpawarrump or Lumpawaroo (Lumpy).

==Production==
While outlining the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; and planning its potential sequels, Lucas imagined a &quot;film just about Wookiees, nothing else.&quot; After the original film&#x27;s success, its cast made a few appearances on TV variety shows. According to Charles Lippincott, who was head of marketing of the Star Wars Corporation, CBS brought the idea of doing a TV special to him and Lucas, although there is some internal dispute about this claim. According to J.W. Rinzler, &quot;Everybody agreed that a television special was a good idea.&quot; Lucas was busy moving his production company to a new location, which was not heavily involved in the special. According to Lucasfilm producer Gary Kurtz:
Though Lucas is uncredited, it was his idea to build the narrative around Chewbacca&#x27;s family. CBS hired experienced variety show writers and producers, including writer Bruce Vilanch, who was concerned about the decision to center the special on a species who grunt in a fictional language without subtitles. Regardless, Lucas would not budge on his vision. The special went through two directors. The first, David Acomba, was brought in through an attempt to &quot;make us different in variety shows&quot;, according to Lippincott.

Acomba, a classmate of George Lucas at USC film school, was unfamiliar with a multiple-camera setup, which caused some problems. Acomba also felt that there was a divide between himself and the producers, and chose to leave the project after finishing only a few scenes, including the cantina and Jefferson Starship. He was replaced by Steve Binder, whose only contact with Lucasfilm was a &quot;Wookiee bible&quot; detailing how the species should look and behave. Stan Winston was hired to design the Wookiee family.

The special was broadcast in its entirety in the United States only once, on Friday, November 17, 1978 (the week before Thanksgiving), on the television network CBS from 8:00 pm to 10:00 pm, Eastern Standard Time (EST), pre-empting &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; and &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; leading to the latter shows&#x27; episodes to be aired that day to instead be shown a week later. It was also broadcast on the Canadian television network CTV from 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm, Eastern Standard Time.

==Segments==
All the acts are loosely linked together with material that involves the Wookiees&#x27; preparation for Life Day on Kashyyyk, Han and Chewie&#x27;s attempt to bypass the Imperial blockade and make it to Chewie&#x27;s family, and the Imperial garrison&#x27;s search for rebels. The plot strings together a series of musical numbers, celebrity cameos and other variety-show acts. These include songs and comedy routines by such 1970s talents as Jefferson Starship, Diahann Carroll, Art Carney, Harvey Korman and Bea Arthur, and a circus-style acrobatics routine including uneven bars and juggling. The most notable segment is an animated cartoon featuring the onscreen debut of Boba Fett.

===Music===
Original music was composed for &quot;The Star Wars Holiday Special&quot; by Ken and Mitzie Welch, while Ian Fraser was brought in to adapt John Williams&#x27; orchestral themes from &quot;Star Wars&quot;. The special features four songs:
# &quot;This Minute Now&quot; is sung by Diahann Carroll. Carroll – who is supposed to be an image created by a virtual reality machine – tells Chewbacca&#x27;s father, Itchy, that she is his &quot;fantasy&quot; and suggestively invites him to &quot;experience&quot; her.
# &quot;Light the Sky on Fire&quot;, performed by Jefferson Starship, which is presented as a 3D music video watched by one of the Imperial guards; during production the song was given the working title &quot;Cigar-Shaped Object (Vanished Without a Trace)&quot; (the song was included as a bonus 45 rpm single in the Jefferson Starship greatest hits collection &quot;Gold&quot;). (The clip marked Marty Balin&#x27;s final appearance with Jefferson Starship, as he had left the band in October 1978, a month before the special was broadcast. He later rejoined the band in 1993.)
# Later, Bea Arthur, who plays Ackmena, proprietress of the Mos Eisley cantina, sings &quot;Good Night, But Not Goodbye&quot; set to the Cantina Band theme. Some of the same aliens seen in the cantina in &quot;Star Wars&quot; reappear, including the band Figrin D&#x27;an and the Modal Nodes, as back-up musicians. 
# Finally, at the end of the special, Carrie Fisher sings a song in celebration of Life Day to the tune of &quot;Star Wars (Main Title)&quot; by John Williams.

===Comedy===
Harvey Korman provides comedy in three of the special&#x27;s skits, including the cantina skit with Bea Arthur where he plays a love-struck barfly who drinks through a hole in the top of his head. He also performs two solo routines: one as Chef Gormaanda, a four-armed parody of Julia Child (the four arms allow her to work much faster than Malla can keep up with) and one as a malfunctioning Amorphian android named Dromboid in an instruction video watched by Lumpy.

Art Carney has a more integral role in the story, playing a trader named Saun Dann on Kashyyyk who is a member of the rebellion and helps Chewie&#x27;s family. His segments are also largely played for laughs and at one point includes a scene alluding to his character Ed Norton from &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;, where an Imperial officer demands that he &quot;get on with it&quot; while Carney dallies with a prop, thus introducing the Jefferson Starship performance.

===Cartoon===
The high point of the special is generally considered to be the animated segment known as &quot;The Faithful Wookiee&quot;, which is the first official &quot;Star Wars&quot; cartoon. It was written by Lucas and produced by Toronto animation firm Nelvana Ltd., which later produced &quot;Droids&quot; and &quot;Ewoks&quot;, two Saturday-morning series based on the franchise in 1985 on ABC. Lucas requested that the visual style be inspired by Moebius. The vocal talents of the main cast are featured. Intended as an flashback, Luke wears a yellow jacket similar to his outfit at the end of &quot;A New Hope&quot;.

The cartoon introduces Boba Fett, whose appearance was based on footage of the unpainted costume from &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, and according to Nelvana co-founder Clive Smith, their suggestion to &quot;scuff up his costume a little bit&quot; influenced the character&#x27;s live-action appearance. The final costume design made a public parade appearance two months before the &quot;Holiday Special&quot; aired. The simplified color scheme for the cartoon was later repeated for Fett&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Droids&quot;. According to the official &quot;Star Wars&quot; website, Fett was voiced by Don Francks in the special.

Separate from the rest of the special, the cartoon is presently available to view on the streaming platform Disney+.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
The &quot;Star Wars Holiday Special&quot; was universally lambasted by critics, audiences, and &quot;Star Wars&quot; fans alike. Jerry Buck, in a November 1978 review for the Associated Press, called the program &quot;bubble gum for the brain&quot;. Nathan Rabin of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote, &quot;I&#x27;m not convinced the special wasn&#x27;t ultimately written and directed by a sentient bag of cocaine.&quot;
David Hofstede, author of &quot;What Were They Thinking?: The 100 Dumbest Events in Television History&quot;, ranked the holiday special at number one, calling it &quot;the worst two hours of television ever&quot;. On the review-aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 25% approval rating, based on 16 reviews, with an average rating of .

Writing for Fatherly, Nathan Rabin says the cartoon segment is singular compared to the rest of the special in that it &quot;feels worthy of being canon and not a hypnotically insane aberration.&quot;

===Recognition===
The special was ranked at No. 3 in &quot;The Five Goofiest Moments of the Star Wars Mythos&quot; in the 62nd issue of the UK&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot; magazine. &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked it at number 11 on their &quot;25 Most Hilarious Holiday TV Moments&quot;, mentioning that it was &quot;unintentionally hilarious&quot;. Both &quot;TV Guide&quot; and TV Land ranked the special at No. 59 on their &quot;Top 100 Unexpected Television Moments&quot; in a five-part special that aired from December 5 until December 9, 2005.

In 2008, the &quot;Star Wars Holiday Special&quot; was selected to be shown at the Paley Center for Media by 59% of voters in an online poll of Christmas specials (which allowed users to vote on five titles), beating &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; (34.6%), &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas!&quot; (31.3%) and &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot; (28.4%), among others.

===Reception from cast and crew===
George Lucas did not have significant involvement with the film&#x27;s production and was reportedly unhappy with the results. In 1987, Lucas reportedly said of the special: &quot;I believe it will be released on videotape. I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;re going to rerun it on television or not.&quot; In a May 2005 interview, Lucas was asked if the film had soured him on working in television. He replied:

In 2006, Harrison Ford made an appearance on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, and jokingly did not even acknowledge its existence at first when asked about it, then saying that he had never seen it. On the 2010 television program &quot;Times Talk&quot;, &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist David Carr asked Carrie Fisher about the special; she said that she made Lucas give her a copy of the special in exchange for recording commentary for the &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy so that she would &quot;have something for parties ... when [she] wanted everyone to leave&quot;. In 2018, Mark Hamill admitted to not having seen the entire special. In his 2019 autobiography, Anthony Daniels referred to the special as a &quot;turd&quot;.

The official &quot;Star Wars&quot; site states that the special &quot;delivered mixed results&quot; and states that its highlight was the Boba Fett animated segment. The official site also says, when referring to the fan interest in seeing the Wookiees on-screen, &quot;the 1978 Holiday Special didn&#x27;t cut it&quot;. The official site also refers to the Boba Fett animated segment as &quot;a cult classic&quot;.

==Distribution==

Despite only airing once on television, bootleg recordings of the special uploaded to the Internet led to it becoming a cult classic among &quot;Star Wars&quot; fans.
The cartoon segment appeared as an Easter egg on the 2011 &quot;Star Wars: The Complete Saga&quot; Blu-ray set, making it the only portion of the special to be officially released in any home video format. The cartoon was also released on Disney+ on April 2, 2021, under the name &quot;The Story of the Faithful Wookiee&quot;.

===International broadcast===
The program was seen in Canada on CTV on the same evening as the CBS broadcast. Toronto CTV station CFTO-TV aired the program at 7 pm, an hour earlier than seen on the nearest American outlet, WIVB-TV in Buffalo, New York. It was also distributed and seen in Australia and New Zealand. In Australia it was repeated multiple times on local stations between 1979 and 1984. It aired in France on January 1, 1980, on TF1, in a shortened 72-minute version, dubbed in French.

It was shown on Swedish SVT on May 31, 1979 as (literally &quot;Star Wars - and Peace&quot;).

It aired in the Republic of Ireland on RTÉ 2 on Christmas Day 1979. The special was also broadcast in Honduras on Canal 5 and Brazil on TV Bandeirantes (on Christmas Day, 1981).

* Prior to the special&#x27;s airing, the Kenner toy company considered creating a toy line based on the special. While the project was canceled because of the unpopularity of the special, several prototype versions of the figures are known to have been created. Those depict the Chewbacca family and seem to be simply modifications of Kenner&#x27;s officially released Chewbacca figure.
* Jefferson Starship released their song from the special, &quot;Light the Sky On Fire&quot;, as a single, with their 1974 song &quot;Hyperdrive&quot; as the B-side. &quot;Cash Box&quot; said of it that a &quot;dashing rhythm section of double-timing drums and pounding bass line underpin this unusual Starship track.&quot;
* In 2007, Hasbro released a Boba Fett action figure, using the likeness from the animated cartoon and titled &quot;Boba Fett (Animated Debut)&quot;.
* In 2022, a Little Golden Book adaptation of &quot;Story of the Faithful Wookiee&quot; was published, adapted by Christopher Nicholas and featuring art adapted from the original animation. (ISBN 9780736442633)

==Legacy==

===Canonicity of the special===

Despite the unpopularity of the special, Lucasfilm maintained its status as part of the continuity, placing it halfway between Episodes &quot;IV&quot; and &quot;V&quot;. From 1978 to 2014, most elements of the &quot;Holiday Special&quot; fell under a secondary level of canon superseded by other licensed works.

This was clarified in 2007 by Leland Chee, who maintained Lucasfilm&#x27;s internal continuity database called &quot;the Holocron&quot;. According to Chee, the Holocron contained at least 28 entries about &quot;The Star Wars Holiday Special&quot; by that point. These placed all elements referred to in other works, such as Life Day and Chewbacca&#x27;s family members, in an intermediary level of canon. Chee stated that elements not subsequently referred to were given the next lowest rank.

Chee also confirmed that Leslie Schofield appears as an unnamed character in &quot;The Star Wars Holiday Special&quot; and not the character he played in &quot;A New Hope&quot; named Chief Bast. Previously this confusion had caused some fans to question whether Bast&#x27;s death aboard the Death Star was genuine (drawing on a hint in the &quot;Customizable Card Game&quot;).

After Lucasfilm was acquired by The Walt Disney Company, the Holocron was retired. Only the episodic films and animated series beginning with &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; were declared to be part of the new canon. J. J. Abrams sardonically referred to the holiday special as canonical in a 2015 interview. Life Day was mentioned in &quot;Chapter 1: The Mandalorian&quot;, the first episode of the canonical live-action series, &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; (2019). A hologram circus similar to the one used by Lumpy was used in &quot;This Could Be a Real Adventure&quot;, the first episode of another canonical live-action series, &quot;Star Wars: Skeleton Crew&quot; (2024).

===Later appearances===
After being introduced by the special, the character Boba Fett and the planet Kashyyyk have gone on to play integral roles in the franchise, making their first film appearances in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; and &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;, respectively. Apart from this, more specific references to &quot;The Star Wars Holiday Special&quot; have been made, including:
* In 1979, Lucasfilm published &quot;Star Wars: The Wookiee Storybook&quot;, a children&#x27;s book that reunites characters from the special.

While there, the player can explore the customs of Life Day, as there are several Wookiees dressed in red robes, as in the special. Lumpy&#x27;s stuffed bantha from the special can also be seen in the game. The official site for &quot;Star Wars: Galaxies&quot; even had a webpage dedicated to explaining these features in the game and the customs of Life Day.

*A &quot;Life Day&quot; comic from Marvel was released on November 24, 2021.
*On January 4, 2022, a Little Golden Book adaptation of &quot;The Story of the Faithful Wookiee&quot; was released by Random House.

===In popular culture===
In 2005, Lawrence Person wrote a review of a &quot;Platinum Edition&quot; DVD release of the special as an April Fools hoax.

In the 2006 music video accompanying the &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic song &quot;White &amp; Nerdy&quot;, the main character is seen buying a bootlegged version of the &quot;Star Wars Holiday Special&quot;. The scene depicts the exchange as a drug deal, referencing the underground status of the special.

In 2007, the comedy troupe RiffTrax, which is composed of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; alumni Bill Corbett, Kevin Murphy and Michael J. Nelson, released a parody commentary on the special including the original commercial breaks.

In the 2011 &quot;Community&quot; episode &quot;Regional Holiday Music&quot;, the main characters watch the &quot;Inspector Spacetime holiday special&quot;, a clear nod to the &quot;Star Wars Holiday Special&quot;.

&quot;The LEGO Star Wars Holiday Special&quot; featuring characters from the sequel trilogy in a Life Day-themed adventure was released on Disney+ on November 17, 2020, the 42nd anniversary of the special. The same day, io9 announced that Jeremy Coon and Steve Kozak were directing a documentary about the making of the special titled &quot;A Disturbance in the Force&quot;.

&quot;The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special&quot; is a Disney+ special released in November 2022. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and director James Gunn has cited the &quot;Star Wars&quot; special as its main inspiration.

<text>Fluphenazine, sold under the brand name Prolixin among others, is a high-potency typical antipsychotic medication. It is used in the treatment of chronic psychoses such as schizophrenia, and appears to be about equal in effectiveness to low-potency antipsychotics like chlorpromazine. It is given by mouth, injection into a muscle, or just under the skin. There is also a long acting injectable version that may last for up to four weeks. Fluphenazine decanoate, the depot injection form of fluphenazine, should not be used by people with severe depression.
Common side effects include movement problems, sleepiness, depression and increased weight. Serious side effects may include neuroleptic malignant syndrome, low white blood cell levels, and the potentially permanent movement disorder tardive dyskinesia. In older people with psychosis as a result of dementia it may increase the risk of dying. It may also increase prolactin levels which may result in milk production, enlarged breasts in males, impotence, and the absence of menstrual periods. It is unclear if it is safe for use in pregnancy.

Fluphenazine is a typical antipsychotic of the phenothiazine class. Its mechanism of action is not entirely clear but believed to be related to its ability to block dopamine receptors. In up to 40% of those on long term phenothiazines, liver function tests become mildly abnormal.
Fluphenazine came into use in 1959. The injectable form is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. It was discontinued in Australia in 2017.

==Medical use==
A 2018 Cochrane review found that fluphenazine was an imperfect treatment and other inexpensive drugs less associated with side effects may be an equally effective choice for people with schizophrenia. Another 2018 Cochrane review found that there was limited evidence that newer atypical antipsychotics were more tolerable than fluphenazine. Intramuscular depot injection forms are available as both the decanoate and enanthate esters.

==Side effects==

===Discontinuation===
The British National Formulary recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotics to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. Symptoms of withdrawal commonly include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Other symptoms may include restlessness, increased sweating, and trouble sleeping. Less commonly there may be a feeling of the world spinning, numbness, or muscle pains. Symptoms generally resolve after a short period of time.

There is tentative evidence that discontinuation of antipsychotics can result in psychosis. It may also result in reoccurrence of the condition that is being treated. Rarely tardive dyskinesia can occur when the medication is stopped.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Fluphenazine acts primarily by blocking post-synaptic dopaminergic D2 receptors in the basal ganglia, cortical and limbic system. It also blocks α1 adrenergic receptors, muscarinic M1 receptors, and histaminergic H1 receptors.

===Pharmacokinetics===
==History==
Fluphenazine came into use in 1959.

==Availability==
The injectable form is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. It was discontinued in Australia in 2017.

== Veterinary ==
In horses, it is sometimes given by injection as an anxiety-relieving medication, though there are many negative common side effects and it is forbidden by many equestrian competition organizations.

<text>Typical antipsychotics (also known as major [[tranquilizers]], and first generation antipsychotics) are a class of antipsychotic drugs first developed in the 1950s and used to treat psychosis (in particular, schizophrenia). Typical antipsychotics may also be used for the treatment of acute mania, agitation, and other conditions. The first typical antipsychotics to come into medical use were the phenothiazines, namely chlorpromazine which was discovered serendipitously. Another prominent grouping of antipsychotics are the butyrophenones, an example of which is haloperidol. The newer, second-generation antipsychotics, also known as atypical antipsychotics, have largely supplanted the use of typical antipsychotics as first-line agents due to the higher risk of movement disorders with typical antipsychotics.

Both generations of medication tend to block receptors in the brain&#x27;s dopamine pathways, but atypicals at the time of marketing were claimed to differ from typical antipsychotics in that they are less likely to cause extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), which include unsteady Parkinson&#x27;s disease-type movements, internal restlessness, and other involuntary movements (e.g. tardive dyskinesia, which can persist after stopping the medication). More recent research has demonstrated the side effect profile of these drugs is similar to older drugs, causing the leading medical journal &quot;The Lancet&quot; to write in its editorial &quot;the time has come to abandon the terms first-generation and second-generation antipsychotics, as they do not merit this distinction.&quot; While typical antipsychotics are more likely to cause EPS, atypicals are more likely to cause adverse metabolic effects, such as weight gain and increase the risk for type II diabetes.

== Clinical uses ==
Typical antipsychotics block the dopamine 2 receptor (D2) receptor, causing a tranquilizing effect. It is thought that 60–80% of D2 receptors need to be occupied for antipsychotic effect. For reference, the typical antipsychotic haloperidol tends to block about 80% of D2 receptors at doses ranging from 2 to 5 mg per day. On the aggregate level, no typical antipsychotic is more effective than any other, though people will vary in which antipsychotic they prefer to take based on individual differences in tolerability and effectiveness. Typical antipsychotics can be used to treat, e.g., schizophrenia or severe agitation. Haloperidol, due to the availability of a rapid-acting injectable formulation and decades of use, remains the most commonly used antipsychotic for treating severe agitation in the emergency department setting.

== Adverse effects ==
Adverse effects vary among the various agents in this class of medications, but common effects include: dry mouth, muscle stiffness, muscle cramping, tremors, EPS and weight gain. EPS refers to a cluster of symptoms consisting of akathisia, parkinsonism, and dystonia. Anticholinergics such as benztropine and diphenhydramine are commonly prescribed to treat the EPS. 4% of users develop rabbit syndrome while on typical antipsychotics.

There is a risk of developing a serious condition called tardive dyskinesia as a side effect of antipsychotics, including typical antipsychotics. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia after chronic typical antipsychotic usage varies on several factors, such as age and gender, as well as the specific antipsychotic used. The commonly reported incidence of TD among younger patients is about 5% per year. Among older patients incidence rates as high as 20% per year have been reported. The average prevalence is approximately 30%. There are few treatments that have consistently been shown to be effective for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia, though an VMAT2 inhibitor like valbenazine may help. The atypical antipsychotic clozapine has also been suggested as an alternative antipsychotic for patients experiencing tardive dyskinesia. Tardive dyskinesia may reverse upon discontinuation of the offending agent or it may be irreversible, withdrawal may also make tardive dyskinesia more severe.

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a rare, but potentially fatal side effect of antipsychotic treatment. NMS is characterized by fever, muscle rigidity, autonomic dysfunction, and altered mental status. Treatment includes discontinuation of the offending agent and supportive care.

The role of typical antipsychotics has come into question recently as studies have suggested that typical antipsychotics may increase the risk of death in elderly patients. A 2005 retrospective cohort study from the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; showed an increase in risk of death with the use of typical antipsychotics that was on par with the increase shown with atypical antipsychotics. This has led some to question the common use of antipsychotics for the treatment of agitation in the elderly, particularly with the availability of alternatives such as mood stabilizing and antiepileptic drugs.

== Potency ==
Traditional antipsychotics are classified as &quot;high-potency&quot;, &quot;mid-potency&quot;, or &quot;low-potency&quot; based on their potency for the D2 receptor:

Prochlorperazine (Compazine, Buccastem, Stemetil) and Pimozide (Orap) are less commonly used to treat psychotic states, and so are sometimes excluded from this classification.

A related concept to D2 potency is the concept of &quot;chlorpromazine equivalence&quot;, which provides a measure of the relative effectiveness of antipsychotics. The measure specifies the amount (mass) in milligrams of a given drug that must be administered in order to achieve desired effects equivalent to those of 100 milligrams of chlorpromazine. Another method is &quot;defined daily dose&quot; (DDD), which is the assumed average dose of an antipsychotic that an adult would receive during long-term treatment. DDD is primarily used for comparing the utilization of antipsychotics (e.g. in an insurance claim database), rather than comparing therapeutic effects between antipsychotics. Maximum dose methods are sometimes used to compare between antipsychotics as well. It is important to note that these methods do not generally account for differences between the tolerability (i.e. the risk of side effects) or the safety between medications.

For a list of typical antipsychotics organized by potency, see below:

===Low potency===

* Chlorpromazine 
* Chlorprothixene
* Levomepromazine
* Mesoridazine
* Periciazine
* Promazine
* Thioridazine†

===Medium potency===

* Loxapine
* Molindone
* Perphenazine
* Thiothixene

===High potency===

* Droperidol 
* Flupentixol
* Fluphenazine
* Haloperidol
* Pimozide
* Prochlorperazine
* Thioproperazine
* Trifluoperazine
* Zuclopenthixol

†: discontinued or withdrawn products

== Long-acting injectables ==
Some typical antipsychotics have been formulated as a long-acting injectable (LAI), or &quot;depot&quot;, formulation. Depot injections are also used on persons under involuntary commitment to force compliance with a court treatment order when the person would refuse to take daily oral medication. This has the effect of dosing a person who doesn&#x27;t consent to take the drug. The United Nations Special Rapporteur On Torture has classified this as a human rights violation and cruel or inhuman treatment.

The first LAI antipsychotics (often referred to as simply &quot;LAIs&quot;) were the typical antipsychotics fluphenazine and haloperidol. Both fluphenazile and haloperidol are formulated as decanoates, referring to the attachment of a decanoic acid group to the antipsychotic molecule. These are then dissolved in an organic oil. Together, these modifications prevent the active medications from being released immediately upon injection, attaining a slow release of the active medications (note, though, that the fluphenazine decanoate product is unique for reaching peak fluphenazine blood levels within 24 hours after administration). Fluphenazine decanoate can be administered every 7 to 21 days (usually every 14 to 28 days), while haloperidol decanoate can be administered every 28 days, though some people receive more or less frequent injections. If a scheduled injection of either haloperidol decanoate or fluphenazine decanoate is missed, recommendations for administering make-up injectable dose(s) or providing antipsychotics to be taken by mouth vary by, e.g., how long ago the last injection was and how many previous injections the person has received (i.e., if steady state levels of the medication have been reached or not).

Both of the typical antipsychotic LAIs are inexpensive in comparison to the atypical LAIs. Doctors usually prefer atypical LAIs over typical LAIs due to the differences in adverse effects between typical and atypical antipsychotics in general.

== History ==

The original antipsychotic drugs were happened upon largely by chance and then tested for their effectiveness. The first, chlorpromazine, was developed as a surgical anesthetic after an initial report in 1952. It was first used in psychiatric institutions because of its powerful tranquilizing effect; at the time it was advertised as a &quot;pharmacological lobotomy&quot;. (Note that &quot;tranquilizing&quot; here only refers to changes in external behavior, while the experience a person has internally may be one of increased agitation but inability to express it.)

Until the 1970s there was considerable debate within psychiatry on the most appropriate term to use to describe the new drugs. In the late 1950s the most widely used term was &quot;neuroleptic&quot;, followed by &quot;major tranquilizer&quot; and then &quot;ataraxic&quot;. The word &quot;neuroleptic&quot; was coined in 1955 by Delay and Deniker after their discovery (1952) of the antipsychotic effects of chlorpromazine. It is derived from the (&quot;neuron&quot;, originally meaning &quot;sinew&quot; but today referring to the nerves) and &quot;&quot; (&quot;lambanō&quot;, meaning &quot;take hold of&quot;). Thus, the word means &quot;taking hold of one&#x27;s nerves&quot;. It was often taken to refer also to common effects such as reduced activity in general, as well as lethargy and impaired motor control. Although these effects are unpleasant and harmful, they were, along with akathisia, considered a reliable sign that the drug was working. These terms have been largely replaced by the term &quot;antipsychotic&quot; in medical and advertising literature, which refers to the medication&#x27;s more-marketable effects.

<text>A polyiamond (also polyamond or simply iamond, or sometimes triangular polyomino) is a polyform whose base form is an equilateral triangle. The word &quot;polyiamond&quot; is a back-formation from &quot;diamond&quot;, because this word is often used to describe the shape of a pair of equilateral triangles placed base to base, and the initial &#x27;di-&#x27; looks like a Greek prefix meaning &#x27;two-&#x27; (though &quot;diamond&quot; actually derives from Greek &quot; ἀδάμας&quot; - also the basis for the word &quot;adamant&quot;). The name was suggested by recreational mathematics writer Thomas H. O&#x27;Beirne in &quot;New Scientist&quot; 1961 number 1, page 164.

==Counting==
The basic combinatorial question is, How many different polyiamonds exist with a given number of cells? Like polyominoes, polyiamonds may be either free or one-sided. Free polyiamonds are invariant under reflection as well as translation and rotation. One-sided polyiamonds distinguish reflections.

The number of free &quot;n&quot;-iamonds for &quot;n&quot; = 1, 2, 3, ... is:

:1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 12, 24, 66, 160, ... .

The number of free polyiamonds with holes is given by ; the number of free polyiamonds without holes is given by ; the number of fixed polyiamonds is given by ; the number of one-sided polyiamonds is given by .
Some authors also call the diamond (rhombus with a 60° angle) a &quot;calisson&quot; after the French sweet of similar shape.

==Symmetries==
Possible symmetries are mirror symmetry, 2-, 3-, and 6-fold rotational symmetry, and each combined with mirror symmetry.

2-fold rotational symmetry with and without mirror symmetry requires at least 2 and 4 triangles, respectively. 6-fold rotational symmetry with and without mirror symmetry requires at least 6 and 18 triangles, respectively. Asymmetry requires at least 5 triangles. 3-fold rotational symmetry without mirror symmetry requires at least 7 triangles.

In the case of only mirror symmetry we can distinguish having the symmetry axis aligned with the grid or rotated 30° (requires at least 4 and 3 triangles, respectively); ditto for 3-fold rotational symmetry, combined with mirror symmetry (requires at least 18 and 1 triangles, respectively).

==Generalizations==
Like polyominoes, but unlike polyhexes, polyiamonds have three-dimensional counterparts, formed by aggregating tetrahedra. However, polytetrahedra do not tile 3-space in the way polyiamonds can tile 2-space.

==Tessellations==
Every polyiamond of order 8 or less tiles the plane, except for the V-heptiamond.

==Correspondence with polyhexes==

Every polyiamond corresponds to a polyhex, as illustrated at right. Conversely, every polyhex is also a polyiamond, because each hexagonal cell of a polyhex is the union of six adjacent equilateral triangles. Neither correspondence is one-to-one.

==In popular culture==
The set of 22 polyiamonds, from order 1 up to order 6, constitutes the shape of the playing pieces in the board game Blokus Trigon, where players attempt to tile a plane with as many polyiamonds as possible, subject to the game rules.

<doc id="185272" wikidata="Q758295" url="?curid=185272" title="Atypical antipsychotic">
<text>The atypical antipsychotics (AAP), also known as second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) and [[serotonin]]–dopamine antagonists (SDAs), are a group of antipsychotic drugs (antipsychotic drugs in general are also known as tranquilizers and neuroleptics, although the latter is usually reserved for the &quot;typical antipsychotics&quot;) largely introduced after the 1970s and used to treat psychiatric conditions. Some atypical antipsychotics have received regulatory approval (e.g. by the FDA of the US, the TGA of Australia, the MHRA of the UK) for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, irritability in autism, and as an adjunct in major depressive disorder.

Both generations of medication tend to block receptors in the brain&#x27;s dopamine pathways. Atypicals are less likely than haloperidol—the most widely used typical antipsychotic—to cause extrapyramidal motor control disabilities in patients such as unsteady Parkinson&#x27;s disease–type movements, body rigidity, and involuntary tremors. However, only a few of the atypicals have been demonstrated to be superior to lesser-used, low-potency first-generation antipsychotics in this regard.

As experience with these agents has grown, several studies have questioned the utility of broadly characterizing antipsychotic drugs as &quot;atypical/second generation&quot; as opposed to &quot;first generation&quot;, noting that each agent has its own efficacy and side-effect profile. It has been argued that a more nuanced view in which the needs of individual patients are matched to the properties of individual drugs is more appropriate. Although atypical antipsychotics are thought to be safer than typical antipsychotics, they still have severe side effects, including tardive dyskinesia (a serious movement disorder), neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and increased risk of stroke, sudden cardiac death, blood clots, and diabetes. Significant weight gain may occur. Critics have argued that &quot;the time has come to abandon the terms first-generation and second-generation antipsychotics, as they do not merit this distinction.&quot;

==Medical uses==
Atypical antipsychotics are typically used to treat schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. They are also frequently used to treat agitation associated with dementia, anxiety disorder, autism spectrum disorder, persecutory delusion and obsessive-compulsive disorder (an off-label use). In dementia, they should only be considered after other treatments have failed and if the patient is a risk to themselves and/or others.

===Schizophrenia===
The first-line psychiatric treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication, which can reduce the positive symptoms of schizophrenia in about 8–15 days. Antipsychotics only appear to improve secondary negative symptoms of schizophrenia in the short term and may worsen negative symptoms overall. Overall there is no good evidence that atypical antipsychotics have any therapeutic benefit for treating the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.

There is very little evidence on which to base a risk and benefit assessment of using antipsychotics for long-term treatment.

The choice of which antipsychotic to use for a specific patient is based on benefits, risks, and costs. It is debatable whether, as a class, typical or atypical antipsychotics are better. Both have equal drop-out and symptom relapse rates when typicals are used at low to moderate dosages. There is a good response in 40–50% of patients, a partial response in 30–40%, and treatment resistance (failure of symptoms to respond satisfactorily after six weeks to two of three different antipsychotics) in the remaining 20%. Clozapine is considered a first choice treatment for treatment resistant schizophrenia, especially in the short term; in the longer-terms the risks of adverse effects complicate the choice. In turn, risperidone, olanzapine, and aripiprazole have been recommended for the treatment of first-episode psychosis.

====Efficacy in the treatment of schizophrenia====
The utility of broadly grouping the antipsychotics into first generation and atypical categories has been challenged. It has been argued that a more nuanced view, matching the properties of individual drugs to the needs of specific patients is preferable. While the atypical (second-generation) antipsychotics were marketed as offering greater efficacy in reducing psychotic symptoms while reducing side effects (and extrapyramidal symptoms in particular) than typical medications, the results showing these effects often lacked robustness, and the assumption was increasingly challenged even as atypical prescriptions were soaring. In 2005 the US government body NIMH published the results of a major independent (not funded by the pharmaceutical companies) multi-site, double-blind study (the CATIE project). This study compared several atypical antipsychotics to an older, mid-potency typical antipsychotic, perphenazine, among 1,493 persons with schizophrenia. The study found that only olanzapine outperformed perphenazine in discontinuation rate (the rate at which people stopped taking it due to its effects). The authors noted an apparent superior efficacy of olanzapine to the other drugs in terms of reduction in psychopathology and rate of hospitalizations, but olanzapine was associated with relatively severe metabolic effects such as a major weight gain problem (averaging 9.4 lbs over 18 months) and increases in glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides. No other atypical studied (risperidone, quetiapine, and ziprasidone) did better than the typical perphenazine on the measures used, nor did they produce fewer adverse effects than the typical antipsychotic perphenazine (a result supported by a meta-analysis by Leucht &quot;et al.&quot; published in &quot;The Lancet&quot;), although more patients discontinued perphenazine owing to extrapyramidal effects compared to the atypical agents (8% vs. 2% to 4%, P=0.002). A phase 2 part of this CATIE study roughly replicated these findings. Compliance has not been shown to be different between the two types. Overall evaluations of the CATIE and other studies have led many researchers to question the first-line prescribing of atypicals over typicals, or even to question the distinction between the two classes.

It has been suggested that there is no validity to the term &quot;second-generation antipsychotic drugs&quot; and that the drugs that currently occupy this category are not identical to each other in mechanism, efficacy, and side-effect profiles.

Each drug has its own mechanism, as Dr. Rif S. El-Mallakh, explained regarding the binding site and occupancy with a focus on the dopamine D2 receptor:In general, when an antagonist of a neurotransmitter receptor is used, it must occupy a minimum of 65% to 70% of the target receptor to be effective. This is clearly the case when the target is a postsynaptic receptor, such as the dopamine D2 receptor. Similarly, despite significant variability in antidepressant response, blockade of 65% to 80% of presynaptic transport proteins—such as the serotonin reuptake pumps when considering serotoninergic antidepressants, or the norepinephrine reuptake pumps when considering noradrenergic agents such as nortriptyline—is necessary for these medications to be effective... Depending on the level of intrinsic activity of a partial agonist and clinical goal, the clinician may aim for a different level of receptor occupancy. For example, aripiprazole will act as a dopamine agonist at lower concentrations, but blocks the receptor at higher concentrations. Unlike antagonist antipsychotics, which require only 65% to 70% D2 receptor occupancy to be effective, aripiprazole receptor binding at effective antipsychotic doses is 90% to 95%. Since aripiprazole has an intrinsic activity of approximately 30% (i.e., when it binds, it stimulates the D2 receptor to about 30% of the effect of dopamine binding to the receptor), binding to 90% of the receptors, and displacing endogenous dopamine, allows aripiprazole to replace the background or tonic tone of dopamine, which has been measured at 19% in people with schizophrenia and 9% in controls. Clinically, this still appears as the minimal effective dose achieving maximal response without significant parkinsonism despite &gt;90% receptor occupancy.

===Bipolar disorder===
In bipolar disorder, SGAs are most commonly used to rapidly control acute mania and mixed episodes, often in conjunction with mood stabilizers (which tend to have a delayed onset of action in such cases) such as lithium and valproate. In milder cases of mania or mixed episodes, mood stabilizer monotherapy may be attempted first. SGAs are also used to treat other aspects of the disorder (such as acute bipolar depression or as a prophylactic treatment) as adjuncts or as a monotherapy, depending on the drug. Both quetiapine and olanzapine have demonstrated significant efficacy in all three treatment phases of bipolar disorder. Lurasidone (trade name Latuda) has demonstrated some efficacy in the acute depressive phase of bipolar disorder.

===Major depressive disorder===
In &quot;non-psychotic&quot; major depressive disorder (MDD), some SGAs have demonstrated significant efficacy as adjunctive agents; and, such agents include:

* Aripiprazole
*Brexpiprazole
*Cariprazine
* Olanzapine
* Quetiapine
* Ziprasidone

whereas only quetiapine has demonstrated efficacy as a monotherapy in non-psychotic MDD. Olanzapine/fluoxetine is an efficacious treatment in both &quot;psychotic&quot; and &quot;non-psychotic&quot; MDD.

Aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, cariprazine, olanzapine, and quetiapine have been approved as adjunct treatment for MDD by the FDA in the United States. Cariprazine, Quetiapine, lurasidone, and lumateperone have been approved, as monotherapies, for bipolar depression, but as of present, lurasidone has not been approved for MDD.

===Autism===
Both risperidone and aripiprazole have received FDA approval for irritability in autism.

===Dementia and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease===
Between May 2007 and April 2008, Dementia and Alzheimer&#x27;s together accounted for 28% of atypical antipsychotic use in patients aged 65 or older. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires that all atypical antipsychotics carry a black box warning that the medication has been associated with an increased risk of mortality in elderly patients. In 2005, the FDA issued an advisory warning of an increased risk of death when atypical antipsychotics are used in dementia. In the subsequent 5 years, the use of atypical antipsychotics to treat dementia decreased by nearly 50%. As of now, the only FDA-approved atypical antipsychotic for alzheimer-related dementia is brexpiprazole.

===Comparison table of efficacy===
== Adverse effects ==
The side effects reportedly associated with the various atypical antipsychotics vary and are medication-specific. Generally speaking, atypical antipsychotics are widely believed to have a lower likelihood for the development of tardive dyskinesia than the typical antipsychotics. However, tardive dyskinesia typically develops after long-term (possibly decades) use of antipsychotics. It is not clear if atypical antipsychotics, having been in use for a relatively short time, produce a lower incidence of tardive dyskinesia.

Among the other side effects that have been suggested is that atypical antipsychotics increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Kabinoff and colleagues (2003) found that the increase in cardiovascular disease is seen regardless of the treatment received, and that it is instead caused by many different factors such as lifestyle or diet.

Sexual side effects have also been reported when taking atypical antipsychotics. In males antipsychotics reduce sexual interest, impair sexual performance with the main difficulties being failure to ejaculate. In females there may be abnormal menstrual cycles and infertility. In both males and females the breasts may become enlarged and a fluid will sometimes ooze from the nipples. Sexual adverse effects caused by some antipsychotics are a result of an increase of prolactin. Sulpiride and Amisulpiride, as well as Risperdone and paliperidone (to a lesser extent), cause a high increase of prolactin.

In April 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an advisory and subsequent black box warning regarding the risks of atypical antipsychotic use among elderly patients with dementia. The FDA advisory was associated with decreases in the use of atypical antipsychotics, especially among elderly patients with dementia. Subsequent research reports confirmed the mortality risks associated with the use of both conventional and atypical antipsychotics to treat patients with dementia. Consequently, in 2008 the FDA issued although a black box warning for classical neuroleptics. Data on treatment efficacies are strongest for atypical antipsychotics. Adverse effects in patients with dementia include an increased risk of mortality and cerebrovascular events, as well as metabolic effects, extrapyramidal symptoms, falls, cognitive worsening, cardiac arrhythmia, and pneumonia. Conventional antipsychotics may pose an even greater safety risk. No clear efficacy evidence exists to support the use of alternative psychotropic classes (e.g. antidepressants, anticonvulsants).

=== Drug-induced OCD ===
Many different types of medication can induce in patients that have never had symptoms before. A new chapter about OCD in the DSM-5 (2013) now specifically includes drug-induced OCD.

There are reports that some atypical antipsychotics could cause drug-induced OCD in already schizophrenic patients.

=== Tardive dyskinesia ===
All of the atypical antipsychotics warn about the possibility of tardive dyskinesia in their package inserts and in the PDR. It is not possible to truly know the risks of tardive dyskinesia when taking atypicals, because tardive dyskinesia can take many decades to develop and the atypical antipsychotics are not old enough to have been tested over a long enough period of time to determine all of the long-term risks. One hypothesis as to why atypicals have a lower risk of tardive dyskinesia is because they are much less fat-soluble than the typical antipsychotics and because they are readily released from D2 receptor and brain tissue. The typical antipsychotics remain attached to the D2 receptors and accumulate in the brain tissue which may lead to TD.

Both typical and atypical antipsychotics can cause tardive dyskinesia. According to one study, rates are lower with the atypicals at 3.9% per year as opposed to the typicals at 5.5% per year.

=== Metabolism ===
Recently, metabolic side effects have been of considerable concern to clinicians, patients and the FDA. In 2003, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required all manufacturers of atypical antipsychotics to change their labeling to include a warning about the risks of hyperglycemia and diabetes with atypical antipsychotics. It must also be pointed out that although all atypicals must carry the warning on their labeling, some evidence shows that atypicals are not equal in their effects on weight and insulin sensitivity. The general consensus is that clozapine and olanzapine are associated with the greatest effects on weight gain and decreased insulin sensitivity, followed by risperidone and quetiapine. Ziprasidone and aripiprazole are thought to have the smallest effects on weight and insulin resistance, but clinical experience with these newer agents is not as developed as that with the older agents. The mechanism of these adverse effects is not completely understood but it is believed to result from a complex interaction between a number of pharmacologic actions of these drugs. Their effects on weight are believed to mostly derive from their actions on the H1 and 5-HT2C receptors, while their effects on insulin sensitivity are believed to be the result of a combination of their effects on body weight (as increased body mass is known to be a risk factor for insulin resistance) and their antagonistic effects on the M3 receptor. Some of the newer agents, however, such as risperidone and its metabolite paliperidone, ziprasidone, lurasidone, aripiprazole, asenapine and iloperidone, have clinically insignificant effects on the M3 receptor and appear to carry a lower risk of insulin resistance. Whereas clozapine, olanzapine and quetiapine (indirectly via its active metabolite, norquetiapine) all antagonise the M3 receptor at therapeutic-relevant concentrations.

Recent evidence suggests a role of the α1 adrenoceptor and 5-HT2A receptor in the metabolic effects of atypical antipsychotics. The 5-HT2A receptor, however, is also believed to play a crucial role in the therapeutic advantages of atypical antipsychotics over their predecessors, the typical antipsychotics.

The two atypical antipsychotics with trials showing that had a low incidence of weight gain in large meta-analysis were lurasidone and aripiprazole. In a meta-analysis of 18 antipsychotics, olanzapine and clozapine exhibited the worst metabolic parameters and aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, cariprazine, lurasidone, and ziprasidone the most benign parameters. Aripiprazole, asenapine, ziprasidone and lurasidone have low propensity to cause weight gain. Lumateperone was found to cause minimal weight gain in a long-term 12 month follow-up study.

A study by Sernyak and colleagues found that the prevalence of diabetes in atypical antipsychotic treatments was statistically significantly higher than that of conventional treatment. The authors of this study suggest that it is a causal relationship the Kabinoff et al. suggest the findings only suggest a temporal association. Kabinoff et al. suggest that there is insufficient data from large studies to demonstrate a consistent or significant difference in the risk of insulin resistance during treatment with various atypical antipsychotics. Prescribing topiramate, zonisamide, metformin, GLP-1 receptor agonists, or nizatidine alongside an antipsychotic significantly reduces weight gain.

Despite increasing some risk factors, SGAs are not associated with excess cardiovascular mortality when used to treat serious psychiatric disorders.

===Comparison table of adverse effects===
===Discontinuation===
The British National Formulary recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotics to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. Symptoms of withdrawal commonly include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Other symptoms may include restlessness, increased sweating, and trouble sleeping. Less commonly there may be a feeling of the world spinning, numbness, or muscle pains. Symptoms generally resolve after a short period of time.

There is tentative evidence that discontinuation of antipsychotics can result in psychosis. It may also result in reoccurrence of the condition that is being treated. Rarely tardive dyskinesia can occur when the medication is stopped.

==Pharmacology==

=== Pharmacodynamics ===
The atypical antipsychotics integrate with the serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (α, β), and dopamine (DA) receptors in order to effectively treat schizophrenia.

D2 Receptor: Hyperactive dopaminergic activity on D2 receptors in the mesolimbic pathway is responsible for the positive symptoms of schizophrenia (hallucinations, delusions, paranoia). After taking an antipsychotic, antagonism of D2 receptors occurs throughout the entire brain, leading to a number of deleterious side effects from D2 receptor antagonism throughout the entire dopamine pathway system. It&#x27;s not possible to affect D2 receptors only in the mesolimbic pathway, but 5-HT2A receptor antagonism reverses these side effects to some extent. Reducing D2 dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway also results in an anhedonic effect, reducing pleasure and motivation. In the mesocortical pathway to the DLPFC and VMPFC, endogenous D2 receptor dopamine activity is sometimes low in schizophrenia, resulting in cognitive, affective, and, broadly, the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. D2 receptor antagonism further compounds these problems. In the nigrostriatal pathway, D2 receptor antagonism results in extrapyramidal symptoms. If this antagonism occurs long enough, symptoms of EPS may become permanent, even if antipsychotic use is discontinued. In the tuberoinfundibular pathway, D2 receptor antagonism results in elevated prolactin. If prolactin levels become high enough, hyperprolactinaemia may occur, resulting in sexual dysfunction, weight gain, more rapid demineralization of bones, and possibly galactorrhea and amenorrhea.

5-HT2A Receptor: When serotonin is released on to postsynaptic 5-HT2A receptors, the dopamine neuron is inhibited, thus acting as a brake on dopamine release. This brake is disrupted through action of a 5-HT2A antagonist, which disinhibits the dopamine neuron, stimulating dopamine release. The result of this is that dopamine competes with antipsychotic D2 antagonistic action at D2 receptors, thereby reducing antagonistic binding there and eliminating or lowering D2 antagonistic effects in several pathways of the dopamine system. In the nigrostratial pathway, it reduces EPS. In the tuberoinfundibular pathway, it reduces or eliminates prolactin elevation. Dopamine release in the mesolimbic pathway from 5-HT2A antagonism does not appear to be as robust as in the other pathways of the dopamine system, thereby accounting for why atypical antipsychotics still retain part of their efficacy against the positive symptoms of schizophrenia through their D2 antagonism. When 5-HT2A antagonistic agent particles occupy 5-HT2A receptors in the mesocortical pathway and in the prefrontal cortex, the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, affective symptoms, and cognitive deficits and abnormalities are treated and reduced. Furthermore, 5-HT2A receptor antagonism blocks the serotonergic excitation of cortical pyramidal cells, reducing glutamate release, which in turn lowers hyperactive dopaminergic D2 receptor activity in the mesolimbic pathway, reducing or eliminating the positive symptoms of schizophrenia.

Brexpiprazole, approved by the US FDA in 2015, has a similar binding profile to aripiprazole as a partial D2 agonist with moderate histamine binding, but with brexipiprazole has a higher affinity for serotonin receptor 5-HT2A.

Some effects of 5-HT1A receptor activation include decreased aggressive behavior/ideation, increased sociability, and decreased anxiety and depression. Blockade of the 5-HT2C receptor increases serotonin, releasing norepinephrine and dopamine within the brain. But neuronal reuptake of norepinephrine is limited sharply by some antipsychotics, e.g. ziprasidone. Increased norepinephrine can cause increased glucose(blood sugar) levels. Increased blood sugar levels by increased norepinephrine causes hunger in many humans, which is why weight gain occurs with some antipsychotics if the norepinephrine is not inhibited. Inhibition of norepinephrine stabilizes mood in humans. 5-HT6 receptor antagonists improve cognition, learning, and memory. The 5-HT7 receptor is very potent for the mitigation of bipolar conditions and also yields an antidepressant effect. The antipsychotics asenapine, lurasidone, risperidone, and aripiprazole are very potent at the 5-HT7 receptor. Antagonistic affinity for the H1 receptor also has an antidepressant effect. H1 antagonism blocks serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Patients with increased histamine levels have been observed to have lower serotonin levels. However, the H1 receptor is linked to weight gain. To have partial agonism at the 5-HT1A receptor can yield absence of weight gain in an antipsychotic. This is very relevant for ziprasidone, but it creates a risk for a prolonged QTc interval. On the other hand, blockade of the 5-HT3 receptor removes the risk for a prolonged QTc interval, but then creates a larger risk for weight gain. Relation to the 5-HT3 receptor increases caloric uptake and glucose, which is seen in clozapine and olanzapine. Other ways for dopamine to resolve is to have agonism at both the D2 receptor and 5-HT1A receptor, which normalizes the dopamine level in the brain. This occurs with cariprazine and aripiprazole.

Whether the anhedonic, loss of pleasure and motivation effect resulting from dopamine insufficiency or blockade at D2 receptors in the mesolimbic pathway, which is mediated in some part by antipsychotics (and despite dopamine release in the mesocortical pathway from 5-HT2A antagonism, which is seen in atypical antipsychotics), or the positive mood, mood stabilization, and cognitive improvement effect resulting from atypical antipsychotic serotonergic activity is greater for the overall quality of life effect of an atypical antipsychotic is a question that is variable between individual experience and the atypical antipsychotic(s) being used.

Legend:

===Pharmacokinetics===
Atypical antipsychotics are most commonly administered orally. Antipsychotics can also be injected, but this method is not as common. They are lipid-soluble, are readily absorbed from the digestive tract, and can easily pass the blood–brain barrier and placental barriers. Once in the brain, the antipsychotics work at the synapse by binding to the receptor. Antipsychotics are completely metabolized in the body and the metabolites are excreted in urine. These drugs have relatively long half-lives. Each drug has a different half-life, but the occupancy of the D2 receptor falls off within 24 hours with atypical antipsychotics, while lasting over 24 hours for the typical antipsychotics. This may explain why relapse into psychosis happens quicker with atypical antipsychotics than with typical antipsychotics, as the drug is excreted faster and is no longer working in the brain. Physical dependence with these drugs is very rare. However, if the drug is abruptly discontinued, psychotic symptoms, movement disorders, and sleep difficulty may be observed. It is possible that withdrawal is rarely seen because the AAP are stored in body fat tissues and slowly released.

== History ==
The first major tranquilizer or antipsychotic medication, chlorpromazine (Thorazine), a typical antipsychotic, was discovered in 1951 and introduced into clinical practice shortly thereafter. Clozapine (Clozaril), an atypical antipsychotic, fell out of favor due to concerns over drug-induced agranulocytosis. Following research indicating its effectiveness in treatment-resistant schizophrenia and the development of an adverse event monitoring system, clozapine re-emerged as a viable antipsychotic. According to Barker (2003), the three most-accepted atypical drugs are clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine. However, he goes on to explain that clozapine is usually the last resort when other drugs fail. Clozapine can cause agranulocytosis (a decreased number of white blood cells), requiring blood monitoring for the patient. Despite the effectiveness of clozapine for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, agents with a more favorable side-effect profile were sought for widespread use. During the 1990s, olanzapine, risperidone, and quetiapine were introduced, with ziprasidone and aripiprazole following in the early 2000s. The atypical antipsychotic paliperidone was approved by the FDA in late 2006. The atypical antipsychotic asenapine (Saphris) was approved by the FDA in 2009.

The atypical antipsychotics have found favor among clinicians and are now considered to be first-line treatments for schizophrenia and are gradually replacing the typical antipsychotics. In the past, most researchers have agreed that the defining characteristics of atypical antipsychotics are the decreased incidence of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) and an absence of sustained prolactin elevation.

The terminology can still be imprecise. The definition of &quot;atypicality&quot; was based upon the absence of extrapyramidal side effects, but there is now a clear understanding that atypical antipsychotics can still induce these effects (though to a lesser degree than typical antipsychotics). Recent literature focuses more upon specific pharmacological actions and less upon categorization of an agent as &quot;typical&quot; or &quot;atypical&quot;. There is no clear dividing line between the typical and atypical antipsychotics therefore categorization based on the action is difficult.

More recent research is questioning the notion that second-generation antipsychotics are superior to first generation typical antipsychotics. Using a number of parameters to assess quality of life, Manchester University researchers found that typical antipsychotics were no worse than atypical antipsychotics. The research was funded by the National Health Service (NHS) of the UK. Because each medication (whether first or second generation) has its own profile of desirable and adverse effects, a neuropsychopharmacologist may recommend one of the older (&quot;typical&quot; or first generation) or newer (&quot;atypical&quot; or second generation) antipsychotics alone or in combination with other medications, based on the symptom profile, response pattern, and adverse effects history of the individual patient.

==Society and culture==
Between May 2007 and April 2008, 5.5 million Americans filled at least one prescription for an atypical antipsychotic. In patients under the age of 65, 71% of patients were prescribed an atypical antipsychotic to treat Schizophrenia or Bipolar Disorder where this dropped to 38% in patients aged 65 or above.

Despite the name &quot;antipsychotics&quot;, the drugs are commonly used for a variety of conditions that do not involve psychosis. Some healthcare professionals reported avoiding the name &quot;atypical antipsychotic&quot; when prescribing the drug to patients who had bipolar disorder.

<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 1987 was the 32nd edition of the annual Eurovision Song Contest. It took place in Brussels, Belgium, following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;J&#x27;aime la vie&quot; by Sandra Kim. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster (RTBF), the contest was held at the Centenary Palace on 9 May 1987 (also Europe Day) and hosted by French-Belgian singer Viktor Lazlo.

Twenty-two countries took part in the contest with and returning to the competition after their absences the previous year. This set the record for the highest number of competing countries up until that point.

The winner was with the song &quot;Hold Me Now&quot; by Johnny Logan, who had also won the contest. He became the first performer to have won the Eurovision Song Contest twice. , , , and the rounded out the top five.

==Location==
The contest took place at the Brussels Exhibition Centre (Brussels Expo) in Brussels, Belgium. These are a set of exhibition halls built from 1930 on the Heysel/Heizel Plateau (Heysel Park) in Laeken (northern part of the City of Brussels) to celebrate the centenary of Belgian Independence. The Centenary Palace (, ), where the main stage was located, is one of the remaining buildings of the Brussels International Exposition of 1935. Currently, it is still being used for trade fairs, as well as concerts, usually for bigger acts and artists.

===Host city selection process===

During the selection process of the host city and venue, a joint committee from the two Belgian broadcasters, Walloon (RTBF) and Flemish (BRT), was created by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). The committee also decided that a potential place for the contest was the Royal Theatre of Antwerp, as both locations proposed by RTBF (the Palais du Centenaire in Brussels and the in Liege) would have required heavy renovation works to meet the proposed technical specifications for the contest. Nevertheless, RTBF demanded the event to be held in Brussels with the argument that the city symbolized more than the Belgium capital itself, in addition to its federal functions as the capital of the country (but almost all governing bodies of the European Union also located there). On 6 October 1986, seven months ahead of the contest, RTBF surprisingly and one-sidedly announced that the Palais du Centenaire was chosen as the host venue for the Eurovision Song Contest 1987. The Flemish newspaper , published that BRT proposed instead to host the contest at the Cirque Royal, near the Royal Palace of Brussels, adding that RTBF would be solely in charge of organizing the contest if BRT&#x27;s counteroffer was not chosen. However, RTBF moved forward alone with its plans and confirmed that the Palais du Centenaire was the official contest&#x27;s host venue. BRT was offended by the choice of Brussels as the host city, and withdrew from the organization, but kept the duties of competing in the contest representing Belgium.

==Participating countries==

The Eurovision Song Contest 1987 was the biggest contest to date, and it was also the first in which 22 countries competed. Only , and failed to compete out of all the countries which had entered the contest in the past. To date, this was the largest number of countries participating in the contest, with the maximum number up until then being 20. As this had never happened, the EBU was forced to review the rules and production calendar after this edition, and fearing that the number would increase again, it was decided that from this edition onwards, the maximum number of participants would also be 22. This was a problematic question over the next six years as new and returning nations indicated an interest in participating, but they could not be accommodated.

Several of the performing artists had previously competed as lead artists in past editions for the same country. Gary Lux had represented as part of Westend, and as a soloist; and he had additionally provided backing vocals . Alexia had represented as part of Island. Wind had represented . Johnny Logan had won the contest for .

== Production and format ==
===Host broadcaster rule===
By 1986, had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 30 times since making its debut at the first contest in along six other countries. Belgium was the only one of the seven founding countries to have never won the contest and had only finished in the top five four times (with &quot; by Tonia in placing fourth, &quot; by Jean Vallée in placing second, &quot;&quot; by Stella in placing fourth, and &quot; &quot; by Jacques Zegers in placing fifth).

Their Eurovision victory in , with by Sandra Kim, occurred amidst a complex political situation in Belgium. The country was undergoing massive constitutional reforms in which the Belgian state was transitioning from a centralized to a federal system. This was due to rising tensions between the two major linguistic regions of Belgium, Dutch-speaking Flanders and French-speaking Wallonia. Both regions had had independent broadcasters since 1960 (BRT in Flanders and RTBF in Wallonia) but had still agreed to jointly host the contest in the event of a Belgian victory. While the triumph of &quot;&quot; in 1986an entry sent by French-speaking RTBFreignited a sense of national union across all Belgian regions, the two regional broadcasters weren&#x27;t able to overcome their disagreements and joint host the competition. During the production of the event, BRT eventually withdrew from the project and RTBF organised the contest alone as host broadcaster. As a consequence, the host country images in Eurovision 1987 mostly showed footage of Wallonia. BRT still remained in charge of the participation in the contest compeating for Belgium.

===Budget===
Holding the contest in Belgium caused several legal changes in the country&#x27;s system and forced the implementation of most of the modern rules and regulations on the monetization of public television. This led to the authorization of advertising, sponsorships, and marketing actions in the two public channels in the country. As a consequence, the RTBF was also allowed to sell sponsorship quotas for the event, setting a new precedent for the Eurovision Song Contest.

For RTBF, this decision was a relief as the event was almost entirely funded with private funds. This opened the doors to the commercial potential of the event itself, starting a period of modernization and increased interest for the event. Apart from the latent tensions, after the end of the contest the then-president of the BRT Cas Goossens praised RTBF for their &quot;perfect organization&quot; while at the same time regretting that the two broadcasters weren&#x27;t able to collaborate. He added that the cost of hosting Eurovision would have been difficult to justify to the Flemish taxpayers.

===Rehearsals===
Dress rehearsals began on 24–25 April.

<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 1986 was the 31st edition of the annual Eurovision Song Contest. It was held in Bergen, Norway, following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;La det swinge&quot; by Bobbysocks! Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster (NRK), the contest was held at on 3 May 1986 and was hosted by previous Norwegian contestant Åse Kleveland.

Twenty countries took part in this year&#x27;s contest with and deciding not to participate and and returning. also competed for the first time this year.

The winner was with the song &quot;&quot; by Sandra Kim. Belgium was the last of the original 7 countries that had competed in the first contest to win. Aged 13, Kim was the youngest ever Eurovision winner. Current rules require Eurovision Song Contest participants to be at least 16, so unless the rule is changed, Kim&#x27;s record will never be broken. The lyrics of her song implied that Kim was 15 years of age, but after the contest, it was revealed that she was actually 13. , who finished second, appealed for her to be disqualified, but was not successful.

The 1986 contest was a first for Eurovision in that royalty were among the guests—Crown Prince Harald, Crown Princess Sonja, Princess Märtha Louise and Prince Haakon Magnus were all in attendance.

==Background==

By 1985, Norway had received the unwanted distinction of being &quot;the nul points country&quot;, receiving 0 points three times and coming in last six times. When they finally won the 1985 contest, it was a source of pride among the Norwegian population, and the national broadcaster, NRK, took full advantage of being able to showcase Norway and its achievements in front of over 500 million television viewers. By the autumn of 1985, NRK had decided to hold the next year&#x27;s contest at the in Bergen, turning down other bids from capital Oslo, and main cities of Stavanger, Sandnes and Trondheim. Bergen is the northernmost city to have ever hosted the Eurovision Song Contest. About 450 journalists have covered the event.

As this was the first time Norway hosted a Eurovision Song Contest, NRK commissioned a lavish budget for the event, turning into a Viking-esque &quot;ice palace&quot; for the live show, complete with white and pastel neon lights for the stage. In addition, NRK also had a special diamond-encrusted dress made for presenter Åse Kleveland for her opening number. The prized dress, which weighed upwards of 15 pounds (6.8 kg), is still available for viewing at NRK&#x27;s costuming department at in Oslo.

Åse Kleveland, a well-known folk guitarist and singer, who was President of the Norwegian Association of Musicians and a former Eurovision entrant in , sang the multilingual &quot;Welcome to Music&quot; as the opening act, incorporating English and French primarily, in addition to other European languages. BBC commentator Terry Wogan, at the close of Kleveland&#x27;s number, dryly remarked, &quot;Katie Boyle (a former Eurovision host for the UK) never sang, did she?&quot;

During her opening remarks, Kleveland said of Norway&#x27;s road in the contest, &quot;For those of you who have followed Norway&#x27;s course through the history of the Eurovision Song Contest, you will know that it has been quite thorny, in fact. So, imagine our joy when last year we &quot;finally&quot; won, and the pleasure we feel today, being able to welcome 700 million viewers to the top of Europe, to Norway, and to Bergen.&quot;

The intersong videos introducing each participant, traditionally named &#x27;postcards&#x27; were for the only time, represented as actual picture postcards sent from the artists to your own nation. Each video began with clips of various scenic views of a part of Norway, which then &#x27;flipped&#x27; to reveal a message of greeting, written in the language of the upcoming song, alongside details of the title, author and composer. The postage stamp on each card (a representation of a genuine Norwegian postage stamp) was linked to the theme of the video content. The postcard then &#x27;flipped&#x27; back to the picture side, where the performing artist had been superimposed onto the image. After the video, Åse Kleveland gave details of the entry and introduced the conductors in a mix of English and French, reading from cards represented by the flag of the upcoming country.

The main interval act presented featured Norwegian musicians, a hitherto unknown young woman outside of Norway, Sissel Kyrkjebø and the musician Steinar Ofsdal, accompanied by the NRK radio orchestra, Kringkastingsorkesteret (KORK). They opened with the traditional song of the city of Bergen, Udsikter fra Ulriken (also known as &quot;Nystemte&#x27;n&quot;), and presented a number of familiar tunes while showing the sights and sounds of Bergen area. Ofsdal played a range of traditional Norwegian folk instruments such as accordion, recorder and hardingfele. This was Kyrkjebø&#x27;s first performance on an international event, which served as the starting point for a consolidated international career years later.

== Participating countries ==

A record number of broadcasters submitted entries for the contest, and it was expected that twenty-one countries would participate in the event. This would have surpassed the previous record of twenty participating countries which competed in , , and . The and both returned after a one-year absence, and made its first ever entry. Of the countries which had participated in the only opted not to compete in this event. However, only twenty countries ultimately participated, as the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT), which had already selected the song &quot;&quot; performed by Polina to represent , made a late decision to not compete due to the event falling on Holy Saturday in the Eastern Orthodox calendar.

The contest featured one artist who had previously competed at Eurovision: Elpida representing had previously represented .

== Production and format ==
About 450 journalists have covered the event. The trophy was made by Arne Valen at the Bergen Steinsenter.

== Contest overview ==
The contest took place at 21:00 CEST, and was hosted by Åse Kleveland, who had competed in Eurovision representing .

== Detailed voting results ==

The winning song, Belgium&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, received points from every jury (Belgium received five sets of 12 points; every country awarded Belgium at least five points except for Germany, which gave them just one point). Belgium was the leader in the voting from the results of the second jury out of twenty, in the longest winning stretch during voting since 1974. Switzerland was behind Belgium in nearly every part of the voting, but Belgium had a commanding lead from the very beginning. Traditionally some juries give high points to the host country&#x27;s entrant, but this did not happen this year; no jury gave Norway&#x27;s song &quot;Romeo&quot; more than six points out of a possible 12.

Belgium scored an absolute record at the time, with Sandra Kim earning a never seen before number of 176 points (that record remained seven years until the 1993 contest, with Ireland scoring 187 points), an average of 9.26 points per voting nation. Kim received 77.2% of the maximum possible score, which, as of 2023, still ranks 8th among all Eurovision winners.

<text>Partita (also &quot;partie&quot;, &quot;partia&quot;, &quot;parthia&quot;, or &quot;parthie&quot;) was originally the name for a single-instrumental piece of music (16th and 17th centuries), but Johann Kuhnau (Thomaskantor until 1722), his student Christoph Graupner, and Johann Sebastian Bach used it for collections of musical pieces, as a synonym for suite.

Johann Sebastian Bach wrote two sets of partitas for different instruments. Those for solo keyboard the composer published as his Opus 1 (known as the Klavierübung I). One additional suite in B minor, the &quot;Overture in the French Style&quot; (often simply called &quot;French Overture&quot;) is sometimes also considered a partita. See &quot;Partitas&quot; for keyboard (825–830) and choral partitas for organ. The &quot;Partita&quot; in A minor for solo flute (BWV 1013) which takes the form of a suite of four dances, has been given the title &quot;partita&quot; by its modern editors; it is sometimes transposed for oboe.

Bach also wrote three partitas for solo violin in 1720 which he paired with sonatas. (He titled each of them the German &quot;Partia&quot;, but they came to be called the Italian &quot;partita&quot;, which was introduced in the Bach Gesellschaft edition in 1879, being the more common term at the time.) See: Sonatas and partitas for solo violin.

The most prolific composer of partitas for harpsichord was Christoph Graupner, whose works in the form number about 57. The first set was published in 1718 and dedicated to his patron Ernest Louis, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt. The last of his partitas exist in manuscripts dated 1750. They are difficult and virtuosic pieces which exhibit an astonishing variety of musical styles. See: List of harpsichord pieces by Christoph Graupner. The longest partita ever written so far is Shoah for Solo Violin and Sacred Temple by Jorge Grundman, which lasts an hour and a half and was finished in 2016.

<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 1985 was the 30th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest, held on 4 May 1985 in the in Gothenburg, Sweden. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster (SVT), it was presented by Lill Lindfors. The contest was held in following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;Diggi-Loo Diggi-Ley&quot; by Herreys. Nineteen countries participated in the contest; and returned after a one-year absence, while the and , which had participated in the previous year&#x27;s event, declined to enter due to separate memorial events in those countries coinciding with the date of the contest.

The winner was with the song &quot;&quot;, composed and written by Rolf Løvland and performed by the group Bobbysocks. This was Norway&#x27;s first contest victory, and only the third top five placing for a country which had placed last on six previous occasions, including three times receiving &quot;nul points&quot;. With a total of 123 points, &quot;&quot; remains the lowest scoring winner under the voting system used between and . , Sweden, the and Israel rounded out the top five positions.

==Location==

The 1985 contest took place in Gothenburg, Sweden, following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;Diggi-Loo Diggi-Ley&quot; performed by Herreys. It was the second time that Sweden had hosted the event, ten years after the was held in Stockholm. The chosen venue was the , an indoor arena inaugurated in 1971, home to the Frölunda HC ice hockey team and the Gothenburg Horse Show. The Scandinavium was chosen by host broadcaster (SVT) from a number of bids submitted by various Swedish cities and venues; among those known to have been considered to stage the contest were the Berwald Hall in Stockholm and the in Jönköping. The stadium&#x27;s maximum capacity of 14,000 people was reduced to 8,000 attendees for the contest, in order to provide space for the stage and technical equipment; this still made it the largest venue and the largest assembled audience in the history of the contest up to that point. During the week leading up to the rehearsals and the televised event, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and SVT held an official reception for the participating delegations, which was hosted on the evening of 1 May 1985 at .

== Participating countries ==


Nineteen countries in total participated in the 1985 contest. and both returned following a one-year absence, however the and , which had competed in the previous year&#x27;s contest, declined to enter in 1985 as the date of the contest coincided with memorial days in the countries, specifically the Remembrance of the Dead, and the anniversary of the death of Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito, respectively. It was the first time in the contest&#x27;s history that there was no entry from the Netherlands, with the nation having previously competed in every event since its .

Several of the participating artists in this year&#x27;s event had previously competed in past editions of the contest. Izhar Cohen, who had previously won the with the song &quot;A-Ba-Ni-Bi&quot; alongside the group Alphabeta, made a second contest appearance for at this event. The group Hot Eyes represented their nation for a second consecutive year, while the duo Al Bano and Romina Power also made a second contest appearance, having previously competed for their country in . The two members of &#x27;s group Bobbysocks had previously competed in the event separately, with Hanne Krogh having represented Norway in , and Elisabeth Andreasson previously competing for in as a member of the group Chips alongside Kikki Danielsson; Danielsson also competed in this event as a solo artist for Sweden. The duo Mariella Farré and had also previously competed in the contest for their country with separate entries, with Farré having competed in as a soloist, while Gasparini had been a member of the Pepe Lienhard Band in . Gary Lux competed for in this event as a solo artist, having previously represented the country in 1983 as a member of the group Westend; and Ireen Sheer, who had already twice competed in Eurovision, for in and for in 1978, represented Luxembourg again at this contest alongside five other artists. Additionally, &#x27;s Lia Vissi had previously participated as backing vocalist for at the contest on two separate occasions, in and , the latter as a member of the group the Epikouri; and Rhonda Heath, who was a member of the group Silver Convention that had represented Germany in 1977, returned as a backing vocalist for Austria at this event.


== Production and format ==
The Eurovision Song Contest 1985 was produced by SVT. served as executive producer and director, served as designer, and Curt-Eric Holmquist served as musical director, leading the orchestra. A separate musical director could be nominated by each country to lead the orchestra during their performance, with the host musical director also available to conduct for those countries which did not nominate their own conductor. On behalf of the contest organisers, the EBU, the event was overseen by Frank Naef as scrutineer.

Each participating broadcaster submitted one song, which was required to be no longer than three minutes in duration and performed in the language, or one of the languages, of the country which it represented. A maximum of six performers were allowed on stage during each country&#x27;s performance. Each entry could utilise all or part of the live orchestra and could use instrumental-only backing tracks, however any backing tracks used could only include the sound of instruments featured on stage being mimed by the performers.

The results of the 1985 contest were determined through the same scoring system as had first been introduced in 1975: each country awarded twelve points to its favourite entry, followed by ten points to its second favourite, and then awarded points in decreasing value from eight to one for the remaining songs which featured in the country&#x27;s top ten, with countries unable to vote for their own entry. The points awarded by each country were determined by an assembled jury of eleven individuals, who were all required to be members of the public with no connection to the music industry, with a recommendation that there should be a balance between the sexes and that half should be under 25 years old. Each jury member voted in secret and awarded between one and five votes to each participating song, excluding that from their own country and with no abstentions permitted. The votes of each member were collected following the country&#x27;s performance and then tallied by the non-voting jury chairperson to determine the points to be awarded. In any cases where two or more songs in the top ten received the same number of votes, a show of hands by all jury members was used to determine the final placing.

Rehearsals for the participating artists began on 28 April 1985. Two technical rehearsals were conducted for each participating delegation in the week approaching the contest, with countries rehearsing in the order in which they would perform. The first rehearsals of 40 minutes were held on 29 and 30 April, followed by a press conference for each delegation and the accredited press. Each country&#x27;s second rehearsals were held on 1 and 2 May and lasted 25 minutes total. Three dress rehearsals were held with all artists, two held in the afternoon and evening of 3 May and one final rehearsal in the afternoon of 4 May, with an invited audience present for the second dress rehearsal.

== Contest overview ==
The contest was held on 4 May 1985, beginning at 21:00 (CEST) and lasting 2 hours and 46 minutes. The event was presented by the Swedish singer Lill Lindfors; Lindfors had previously represented Sweden in the , placing second alongside Svante Thuresson with the song &quot;&quot;. Following the confirmation of the nineteen participating countries, a draw was held in Gothenburg on 7 December 1984 to determine the running order (R/O) of the contest.

Lindfors opened the contest with a performance of &quot;My Joy Is Building Bricks of Music&quot;, an English version of her song &quot;&quot;, becoming the first contest presenter to perform during the contest. To mark the thirtieth staging of the contest, among the invited audience present was Lys Assia, the contest&#x27;s first winning artist and representative for in three consecutive contests, in , and . The interval act featured jazz guitarists Peter Almqvist and Ulf Wakenius, performing as Guitars Unlimited. Lindfors was also part of a memorable moment from the contest: when she returned to the stage following the interval act, the skirt of her outfit, designed by Christer Lindarw, got caught on the set and ripped off in an apparent wardrobe malfunction, before Lindfors unclipped the top portion of her outfit to reveal a dress; returning to the microphone, she remarked to the audience, &quot;I just wanted you to wake up a little.&quot; The trophy awarded to the winning songwriter was presented by the previous year&#x27;s winning artists Herreys.

The winner was represented by the song &quot;&quot;, composed and written by Rolf Løvland, and performed by Hanne Krogh and Elisabeth Andreasson as Bobbysocks. It was Norway&#x27;s first contest win and marked a notable turnaround in fortune for the country, which had only placed in the top five on two previous occasions while having placed last six times, including three &quot;nul points&quot;, at the time of the event, a fact on which Lindfors commented as she interviewed Bobbysocks on stage following their victory. During the traditional winner&#x27;s reprise performance, the group sung part of the winning song as its English version &quot;Let It Swing&quot;, with the English lyrics also written by Løvland.

Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their television viewers. These commentators were typically sent to the venue to report on the event, and were able to provide commentary from small booths constructed at the back of the venue. The contest was reportedly broadcast in 30 countries, including the participating nations, Australia, and in the countries of South America, with an estimated global audience of 400 to 600 million.

<text>Moon Mullins is an American comic strip which had a run as both a daily and Sunday feature from June 19, 1923, to June 2, 1991. Syndicated by the Chicago Tribune/New York News Syndicate, the strip depicts the lives of diverse lowbrow characters who reside at the Schmaltz (later Plushbottom) boarding house. The central character, Moon (short for Moonshine), is a would-be prizefighter—perpetually strapped for cash but with a roguish appetite for vice and high living. Moon took a room in the boarding house at 1323 Wump Street in 1924 and never left, staying on for 67 years. The strip was created by cartoonist Frank Willard.

==Origins and history==
Frank Henry Willard was born on September 21, 1893, in Anna, Illinois, the son of a physician. He determined to become a cartoonist early in life. After attending the Academy of Fine Arts in Chicago in 1913, he was a staff artist with the &quot;Chicago Herald&quot; (1914–18), where he drew the Sunday kids&#x27; page &quot;Tom, Dick and Harry&quot; and another strip, &quot;Mrs. Pippin&#x27;s Husband&quot;. He next wrote and drew &quot;The Outta Luck Club&quot; for King Features Syndicate (1919–23).

In &quot;The Comics&quot; (1947), Coulton Waugh described Willard&#x27;s art style as &quot;gritty-looking&quot;. In 2003, the &quot;Scoop&quot; newsletter documented the 1923 events that led to the creation of the strip:

Willard was in tune with the working class characters he created, as noted by David Westbrook in &quot;From Hogan&#x27;s Alley to Coconino County: Four Narratives of the Early Comic Strip&quot;:
:Some comic strip artists laid claim to a similar working-class authenticity by representing themselves in the position of employee. When Frank Willard, author of &quot;Moon Mullins&quot;, narrates a scene from his workplace, he portrays himself as a rowdy underdog much like &quot;The Yellow Kid&quot;. He becomes, in effect, the &quot;tricky and roguish&quot; character cited by Gilbert Seldes as the quintessence of the comic strip.

::I worked for a syndicate manager once who got everybody in the place together once a week and jumped on a desk and gave us &#x27;pep talks.&#x27; He didn&#x27;t give us ideas, but, oh boy, how worn out we were after those pep talks. The guy that applauded the loudest got the most money, and I didn&#x27;t get much—as he found out who it was who gave him the bird!|30|30|Frank Willard, as related to Martin Sheridan
:When Brennecke (in &quot;The Real Mission of the Funny Paper&quot; by Ernest Brennecke, from &quot;The Century Magazine&quot;, March 1924) locates the truth of comic strip realism in the comics&#x27; habit of &quot;commenting trenchantly&quot; on &quot;the life of the middle classes,&quot; it is comics like &quot;The Yellow Kid&quot; and artists like Willard that he has in mind...

*Moon Mullins: With his big eyes, plaid pants, perpetual cigar and yellow derby hat, Moon is an amiable roughneck. He haunts saloons, racetracks and pool halls, mangles the English language with Jazz Age slang, and gets into endless scrapes looking for an easy buck or a hot dame. Moon himself is a low-rent but likeable sort of riff-raff, involved in get-rich schemes and bootleg whiskey, crap games and staying out all night with disreputable friends. None of the roughhousing was fatal or even particularly threatening, however. Indeed, the gentleness of the situational humor behind all the characters&#x27; rough edges kept the strip on an even keel. The name &quot;Moonshine&quot; referenced Mullins as a drinker and gambler during Prohibition.
*Kayo: Moon&#x27;s street urchin kid brother, who sleeps in an open dresser drawer. Kayo is usually clad in suspenders, polka dot pants and a black derby. Pint-sized Kayo (a play on &quot;K.O.,&quot; sportswriters&#x27; shorthand for a knockout punch) is wise beyond his years and even a bit of a cynic. His plain-speaking, matter-of-fact bluntness is a frequent source of comedy.

*Emmy (Schmaltz) Plushbottom: the nosy, lanky, spinsterish landlady who likes to put on airs. She finally married on October 6, 1933, and became Lady Plushbottom. She says &quot;My stars&quot; and &quot;For pity sakes&quot; a lot, but her trademark line—always delivered after a (frequent) putdown—is &quot;I&#x27;ll &quot;smack&quot; your &quot;sassy&quot; face!&quot;
*(Uncle) Willie: Introduced in 1927, Moon&#x27;s long lost, no-account uncle wears a checkered suit and is perpetually unshaven. Willie, who would disappear for months at a time, prefers the hobo life—despite being married and half-domesticated. His only occupation seems to be the avoidance of physical labor and confrontations with his formidable wife, Mamie.
*(Aunt) Mamie: Miss Schmaltz&#x27;s burly, no-nonsense washwoman and cook. Her rolled-up sleeves reveal a conspicuous star tattoo. She&#x27;s the only featured character of the working class cast who actually works. Mamie is usually tolerant of her errant husband, but she can be dangerous when riled—much to Willie&#x27;s dismay.
*Lord Plushbottom: (aka &quot;Plushie,&quot; as Moon calls him.) Willard introduced him because Patterson thought tossing a well-bred Englishman into that shabby crowd had great comic possibilities. Plushbottom initially appeared as a man of wealth, whom Emmy pursued for 10 years before their marriage. Afterward he moved in, in apparently reduced circumstances, but never discarded his evening clothes, spats and top hat for everyday wear.
*Egypt: Emmy&#x27;s beautiful flapper niece with the bobbed Louise Brooks coiffure, and Moon&#x27;s sometime girlfriend.
*Mushmouth: Moon&#x27;s pal and much-maligned step-and-fetch-it.
*Kitty Higgins: the star of Willard&#x27;s &quot;topper&quot; strip about a precocious little girl and her maid, Pauline. Kitty eventually joined the &quot;Moon Mullins&quot; cast as Kayo&#x27;s girlfriend.

After Johnson took over, other characters were added to the cast, including:
*Professor Byrrd: an erudite, tweed-suited academic
*Myna Byrrd: the Professor&#x27;s lovely brunette daughter
*Miss Swivel: a sexy blonde stenographer, frequently pursued by Moon
*Mr. Doodle: an eccentric, temperamental artist
*Joke: a cab driver

The strip was reviewed by Dr. Hermes in &quot;Dr. Hermes Retro-Scans&quot;:
The Sunday page&#x27;s topper strip, &quot;Kitty Higgins&quot;, ran from December 14, 1930, to 1973.

==Later years==

Ferdinand &quot;Ferd&quot; Johnson (1905–1996) began as Willard&#x27;s assistant a few months after the strip began in 1923. Starting with the lettering, then the backgrounds, Johnson gradually progressed to the point where he was handling the entire operation; but it was only after Willard&#x27;s death that he began signing it. When Willard died suddenly on January 11, 1958, the Tribune Syndicate hired Johnson to helm the strip. Johnson&#x27;s first credited strip ran on March 3, 1958. (Frank Willard&#x27;s tombstone at the Anna Cemetery in Anna, Illinois, is graced with an engraving of Moon Mullins.)

Ferd Johnson was born December 18, 1905, in Spring Creek, Pennsylvania. Johnson became interested in cartooning after winning the Erie (Pennsylvania) &quot;Dispatch-Herald&quot; cartoon contest at the age of 12. After finishing high school in 1923 he attended the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts, but left school after only three months to take an assistant&#x27;s job at the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; with Willard. While assisting on &quot;Moon Mullins&quot;, Johnson remained active with other &quot;Tribune&quot; projects. He created several comic strip features for the Syndicate—&quot;Texas Slim&quot; (1925–1928) and &quot;Lovey-Dovey&quot; (1932)—did sports illustration work, and produced advertising cartoons. In 1940, he revived Texas Slim in &quot;Texas Slim and Dirty Dalton&quot; (with the companion strip, &quot;Buzzy&quot;), which ran for 18 years.

By the time he took &quot;Moon Mullins&quot;, it had evolved from long story continuities to a gag-a-day strip. In 1978, Ferd&#x27;s son, Tom Johnson, signed on as his assistant. Ferd Johnson stayed with the strip until it came to an end upon his retirement in 1991. 
==Decline and end==
&quot;Moon Mullins&quot; appeared in 350 papers at its height but declined to 50. Johnson said, &quot;They just kept dropping off because it&#x27;s so damn old. The new ones come out and the editors want to make room for them, so the old ones get dumped. And &quot;Moon&quot; sure qualifies that way.&quot; In April 1991, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; dropped the strip, and the Tribune Media Syndicate told Johnson that it was the end. The last strip ran on Sunday, 2 June 1991.

==Licensing and promotion==

===Comic books and reprints===

The strip was reprinted in a long-running series of Cupples &amp; Leon books (1927–1937), Big Little Books and comic books for Dell Comics (starting in 1936) and later, the American Comics Group (1947–1948). Dover Publications reprinted a collection of the daily strips in 1976, consisting of the third and fifth Cupples &amp; Leon books. Representative samples of &quot;Moon Mullins&quot; daily continuity were featured in &quot;Great Comics Syndicated by the Daily News-Chicago Tribune&quot; (Crown Publishers, 1972), and &quot;The Smithsonian Collection of Newspaper Comics&quot; (Smithsonian Institution Press/Harry Abrams, 1977). The latter volume also reproduces several full-color Sunday pages. Comic strip historian Bill Blackbeard (1926–2011) edited a series of strip reprints for SPEC Productions.

===Moon Mullins merchandise===

&quot;Moon Mullins&quot; merchandising began when agent Toni Mendez arranged a licensing deal for Kayo suspenders. The wave of products that followed included such items as a series of Kellogg&#x27;s Pep Cereal pins, a Milton Bradley board game (1938), salt and pepper shakers, perfume bottles, Christmas lights, bisque toothbrush holders, a set of German nodder figures, carnival chalkware statues, a wind-up toy handcar,&lt;ref name=&quot;invaluable/464&quot;&gt;
*jpg&lt;/ref&gt; oilcloth and celluloid Kayo dolls, coloring books and a series of jigsaw puzzles (1943).

===Kayo Mullins chocolate drink===
&quot;Kayo Chocolate Drink&quot; was the name of a bottled, later canned, chocolate-flavored milk drink. Created in 1929 by Aaron D. Pashkow of Chicago, it was bottled under authority of Chocolate Products, manufactured for decades, and featured Kayo Mullins on its label.&lt;ref name=&quot;sodapopbottles/signs&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It now only sold as a powdered hot chocolate mix distributed by Superior Coffee and Tea and &quot;Smucker Foodservice Canada&quot; for the foodservice market.

===Radio===

&quot;Moon Mullins&quot; was adapted for radio during the 1940s. In the third episode of the series (March 25, 1940), the Plushbottoms trade Moon&#x27;s only suit to pay for a collect telegram and learn they are owners of a goldmine. In a CBS audition recording dated January 31, 1947, Uncle Willie asks Moon for $10 bail, and Moon teaches the game of Blackjack to Kayo. Lord Plushbottom plans to go to a costume party as an Indian but instead winds up with a suit of armor. Character actor Sheldon Leonard was in the cast.

===Animation===
Cambria Studios produced two sample episodes of a proposed &quot;Moon Mullins&quot; syndicated TV series with their Syncro-Vox animation process in the early 1960s, but it did not clear enough television stations to go into production. Comic actor and director Howard Morris was the voice of Moon when the strip was adapted to animation for &quot;Archie&#x27;s TV Funnies&quot; (1971–1973), produced by Filmation. Moon and Kayo became one of several rotating segments on the Saturday morning cartoon series. Other comic strip character features in the rotation included &quot;Broom-Hilda, Dick Tracy, The Captain and the Kids, Alley Oop, Nancy and Sluggo&quot; and &quot;Smokey Stover&quot;. It was repeated in 1978, without &quot;Archie&quot;, under the title &quot;Fabulous Funnies&quot;.

<doc id="185289" wikidata="Q3821163" url="?curid=185289" title="The Silver Chalice">
<text>The Silver Chalice is a 1952 English language historical novel by Thomas B. Costain. It is the fictional story of the making of a silver chalice to hold the Holy Grail (itself here conflated with the Holy Chalice) and includes 1st century biblical and historical figures: Luke, Joseph of Arimathea, Simon Magus and his companion Helena, and the apostle Peter.

The story was inspired by the archeological discovery of a 1st-century silver chalice in Antioch (see Antioch Chalice). It is in effect a prequel to the Arthurian Legend, where the search for the Holy Grail plays a conspicuous part.

Two years after its publication, Warner Bros. released a feature adaptation of the book. The film starred Paul Newman, in his first studio role, as Basil the craftsman.

First published in 1952, this classic recounts the story of Basil, a young silversmith, who is commissioned by Luke the Evangelist, a disciple of Christ and biographer of the Apostle Paul, to fashion a holder for the cup Jesus used at the Last Supper.

&quot;The Silver Chalice&quot; was a top best-selling fiction title of 1953 in the United States, atop &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list from September 7, 1952 to March 8, 1953, and remaining 64 weeks on the list until October 25, 1953.

==Plot introduction==
&quot;The Silver Chalice&quot; takes place in Judea and other parts of the Roman Empire shortly after the death of Jesus. A young man, Basil, is adopted by a rich man, but loses his fortune when his father dies and his uncle defrauds him, claiming he was purchased as a slave, and sells him. As a slave, he survives by working as an artist and silversmith. He gains his freedom, becomes a Christian and is commissioned to create an outer covering for the cup Jesus drank from at The Last Supper.

The plot of &quot;The Silver Chalice&quot; centers on the Grail — the cup from which Christ drank at the Last Supper. Tired of “all the Arthurian tripe about the Holy Grail,” Costain imagined his own version of the story. Joseph of Arimathea hires Basil of Antioch, a lowborn artisan, to fashion a beautiful silver casing to hold the plain original cup that Jesus used. The casing is to be decorated with the faces of Jesus and the twelve Apostles. To fulfill the commission, Basil travels throughout the ancient Mediterranean world to meet these men and those who knew them intimately.

==Reception==

===Positive===
&quot;The Silver Chalice&quot; was well received when it was published in 1952. The book was on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller List from September 7, 1952 to October 25, 1953 for a total of 64 weeks. It was near the top of that list for 6 months.

Also in 1953, Kirkus Reviews said:
:Mr. Costain&#x27;s best book of fiction, and one that will put out a strong bid to rival &quot;The Robe&quot; in success with that market. The subject is an illusive one that has been approached tentatively through the centuries -- the mystery of the holy grail...Occasional pandering to modern taste weakens the fundamental values, perhaps, but insures the larger market. A sure best seller.

After the author&#x27;s death in 1965, &quot;The Canadian Book Review Annual&quot; said that:
:There are a number of anachronisms but, by and large, the novel is a creative introduction to the period and worth a reprint.

<doc id="185290" wikidata="Q927497" url="?curid=185290" title="Mars effect">
<text>The Mars effect is a purported statistical correlation between athletic eminence and the position of the planet Mars relative to the horizon at time and place of birth. This controversial finding was first reported by the French psychologist and &quot;neo-astrologer&quot; Michel Gauquelin. In his book (&quot;The Influence of the Stars&quot;, 1955), Gauquelin suggested that a statistically significant number of sports champions were born just after the planet Mars rises or culminates. He also divided the plane of the ecliptic into twelve sectors, identifying two &quot;key&quot; sectors of statistical significance.

Gauquelin&#x27;s work was accepted by the psychologist Hans Eysenck among others but later attempts to validate the data and replicate the effect have produced uneven results, chiefly owing to disagreements over the selection and analysis of the data set. Since the phenomenon in question depends upon the daily rotation of the Earth, the availability and accuracy of time and place of birth data is crucial to such studies, as is the criterion of &quot;eminence&quot;. Later research claims to explain the Mars effect by selection bias, favouring champions who were born in a &quot;key sector&quot; of Mars and rejecting those who were not from the sample.

==Reception and replication==
Gauquelin&#x27;s work was not limited to the Mars effect: his calculations led him first to reject most of the conventions of natal astrology as it is practised in the modern west but he singled out &quot;highly significant statistical correlations between planetary positions and the birth times of eminently successful people.&quot; This claim concerned not only Mars but five planets, correlated with eminence in fields broadly compatible with the traditional &quot;planetary rulerships&quot; of astrology. However, partly because eminence in sport is more quantifiable, later research, publicity and controversy has tended to single out the &quot;Mars effect&quot;.

===Belgian athletes – the Comité Para===
In 1956 Gauquelin invited the Belgian Comité Para to review his findings but it was not until 1962 that Jean Dath corroborated the statistics Gauquelin had presented and suggested an attempt at duplication using Belgian athletes. By this time Gauquelin had published &quot;Les Hommes et Les Astres&quot; (Men and the Stars, 1960), offering further data. The Comité Para tested the Mars effect in 1967 and replicated it, though most of the data (473 of 535) were still collected by Gauquelin himself. The committee, suspecting that the results might have been an artifact, withheld its findings for a further eight years, then cited unspecified “demographic errors” in its findings. Unpublished internal analyses contradicted this and one committee member, Luc de Marré, resigned in protest. In 1983 Abell, Kurtz and Zelen (&quot;see below&quot;) published a reappraisal, rejecting the idea of demographic errors, saying, “Gauquelin adequately allowed for demographic and astronomical factors in predicting the expected distribution of Mars sectors for birth times in the general population.”

===The Zelen test===
In 1975 Paul Kurtz&#x27;s journal &quot;The Humanist&quot; published an article on astrology criticizing Gauquelin, to which the latter and his wife Françoise responded. Then Professor Marvin Zelen, a statistician and associate of the recently founded Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP, now known as the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI)), proposed in a 1976 article in the same periodical that, in order to eliminate any demographic anomaly, Gauquelin randomly pick 100 athletes from his data-set of 2,088 and check the birth/planet correlations of a sample of babies born at the same times and places in order to establish a control group, giving the base-rate (chance) expectation for comparison (The 100 random athletes later expanded into a subsample of 303 athletes).

In April 1977 CSICOP researcher George O. Abell wrote to Kurtz stating that Zelen&#x27;s test had come out in the Gauquelins&#x27; favour. The Gauquelins also performed the test that Professor Zelen had proposed and carried out and found that the chance Mars-in-key-sector expectation for the general population (i.e., non-champions) was about 17%, significantly less than the 22% observed for athletic champions. However the subsequent article by Zelen, Abell and Kurtz did not clearly state this outcome but rather questioned the original data. In a rebuttal of the Gauquelins&#x27; published conclusion, Marvin Zelen analysed the composition, not of the 17,000 non-champions of the control group, but of the 303 champions, splitting this secondary subsample (which was already nearly too small to test 22% vs 17%) by eliminating female athletes, a subgroup that gave the results most favourable to Gauquelin, and dividing the remaining athletes into city/rural sections and Parisian/non-Parisian sections.

Before and after publication of Zelen&#x27;s results astronomer and charter CSICOP member Dennis Rawlins, the CSICOP Council&#x27;s only astronomer at the time, repeatedly objected to the procedure and to CSICOP&#x27;s subsequent reporting of it. Rawlins privately urged that the Gauquelins&#x27; results were valid and the “Zelen test” could only uphold this and that Zelen had diverted from the original purpose of the control test, which was to check the base rate of births with Mars in the &quot;key&quot; sectors. It appeared to him that the test had minimised the significance of the Mars/key-sector correlations with athletes by splitting the sample of athletes and that the experimenters, who were supposed to be upholding scientific standards, were actually distorting and manipulating evidence to conceal the result of an ill-considered test.

The Kurtz-Zelen-Abell analysis had split the sample primarily to examine the randomness of the 303 selected champions, the non-randomness of which Rawlins demonstrated in 1975 and 1977. Zelen&#x27;s 1976 &quot;Challenge to Gauquelin&quot; had stated: &quot;We now have an objective way for unambiguous corroboration or disconfirmation ... to settle this question&quot;, whereas this aim was now disputed. Rawlins made procedural objections, stating; &quot;... we find an inverse correlation between size and deviation in the Mars-athletes subsamples (that is, the smaller the subsample, the larger the success) – which is what one would expect if bias had infected the blocking off of the sizes of the subsamples&quot;.

CSICOP also contended, after reviewing the results, that the Gauquelins had not chosen randomly. They had had difficulty finding sufficient same-week and same-village births to compare with champions born in rural areas and so had chosen only champions born in larger cities. The Gauquelins&#x27; original total list of about 2,088 champions had included 42 Parisians and their subsample of 303 athletes also included 42 Parisians. Further, Paris is divided into 20 &quot;arrondissements&quot;, different economic classes and ethnic groups typically inhabiting different arrondissements. The Gauquelins had compared the 42 Parisian champions (who had been born throughout Paris) to non-champions of only one arrondissement. If the 22% correlation was an artifact partly based on factors such as rural recordkeeping, economic, class or ethnic differences in birth patterns, this fact would be blurred by this non-random selection.

===U.S. athletes – CSICOP===
At the same time CSICOP began a study of U.S. athletes in consultation with Zelen, Abell and Rawlins. The results, published in 1979 showed a negative result. Gauquelin contended the KZA group demonstrated an overall preference for mediocre athletes and ignored his criteria of eminence and that they included basketball players and people born after 1950.

=== CFEPP test ===
In 1994 the results of a major study undertaken by the Committee for the Study of Paranormal Phenomena (&quot;Comité pour l’Étude des Phénomènes Paranormaux&quot;, or CFEPP) in France found no evidence whatsoever of a &quot;Mars Effect&quot; in the births of athletes. The study had been proposed in 1982 and the committee had agreed in advance to use the protocol upon which Gauquelin insisted. The CFEPP report was “leaked” to the Dutch newspaper &quot;Trouw&quot;.

In 1990 the CFEPP had issued a preliminary report on the study, which used 1,066 French sports champions, giving full data for the 1,066 as well as the names of 373 who fit the criteria but for whom birth times were unavailable, discussing methodology and listing data-selection criteria. In 1996 the report, with a commentary by J. W. Nienhuys and several letters from Gauquelin to the committee, was published in book form as &quot;The Mars Effect – A French Test of Over 1,000 Sports Champions&quot;. The CFEPP stated that its experiment showed no effect and concluded that the effect was attributable to bias in Gauquelin&#x27;s data selection, pointing to the suggestions made by Gauquelin to the committee for changes in their list of athletes. The CFEPP report was criticized by Suitbert Ertel on similar grounds as the American study – for including too many mediocre athletes – and also for using a too high chance-excpectancy level. According to Ertel, a Mars effect could be detected by dividing the athletes into groups of eminence grading.

=== Statistical explanation ===

Some researchers argued that Gauquelin did not adjust the statistical significance of the Mars Effect for multiple comparisons and did not address the issue in his publications. Simplified and illustrative showcase argument is explained here: There are 10 celestial bodies and 12 sectors for them to be in. Furthermore, there are 132 combinations of sector pairs and thus 1320 different combinations of a planet with two sectors. There is about a 25% chance to find at least one such combination (of one planet and two sectors) for a random dataset of the same size as Gauquelin&#x27;s that would yield a result with apparent statistical significance like the one obtained by Gauquelin. This implies that after adjusting for multiple comparisons, the Mars effect is no longer statistically significant even at the modest significance level of 0.05 and is probably a false positive. But the multiple comparisons argument is countered or weakened if it is proven that an effect shows up in more than one study. Some argue that the latter is the case.

Geoffrey Dean has suggested that the effect may be caused by self-reporting of birth dates by parents rather than any issue with the study by Gauquelin. Gauquelin had failed to find the Mars effect in populations after 1950. Dean has put forward the idea that this may be due to increases in doctors reporting the time of birth rather than parents. Information about misreporting was unavailable to Gauquelin at the time. Dean had said that misreporting by 3% of the sample would explain the result.

<doc id="185300" wikidata="Q2884647" url="?curid=185300" title="Barnaby (comics)">
<text>Barnaby is a comic strip which began April 20, 1942, in the newspaper &quot;PM&quot; and was later syndicated in 64 American newspapers (for a combined circulation of more than 5,500,000).

Created by Crockett Johnson, who is best known today for his children&#x27;s book &quot;Harold and the Purple Crayon&quot;, the strip featured a cherubic-looking five-year-old and his far-from-cherubic fairy godfather, Jackeen J. O&#x27;Malley, a short, cigar-smoking man with four tiny wings. With a distinctive appearance because of its use of typography, the strip had numerous reprints and was adapted into a 1940s stage production. The usually caustic Dorothy Parker had nothing but praise: &quot;I think, and I&#x27;m trying to talk calmly, that Barnaby and his friends and oppressors are the most important additions to American Arts and Letters in Lord knows how many years.&quot;

==Characters and story==
One night after having been read a fairy tale involving a fairy godmother by his mother, Barnaby Baxter received a visit through his bedroom window by the cigar-wielding and pink wings-wearing Jackeen J. (J. J.) O&#x27;Malley, who announced that he was Barnaby&#x27;s fairy godfather. This began a series of adventures with Mr. O&#x27;Malley that frequently got the pair of them into scrapes, most of which were either of Mr. O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s making or resulted in embarrassment of some sort for the rather clumsy fairy godfather, a member of the Elves, Leprechauns, Gnomes, and Little Men&#x27;s Chowder &amp; Marching Society. A many of their adventures have surprising results, such as uncovering a gang of criminals hiding their loot in a supposedly haunted house, Barnaby&#x27;s winning a scrap iron contest while out searching for a leprechaun&#x27;s pot of gold, and unmasking a spy working in Mr. Baxter&#x27;s office.

Barnaby&#x27;s parents deny that Mr. O&#x27;Malley is real and take Barnaby to child psychologists. This denial continues even when O&#x27;Malley is seen flying past their picture window, when he walks into their living room, and even after he is elected their representative to Congress.

As time passes, more characters are added, including Jane Schultz, the little girl from down the street who didn&#x27;t believe in Mr. O&#x27;Malley until she saw him; Gorgon, Barnaby&#x27;s talking dog (who never talks in front of the adults); Gus, the timid, glasses-wearing ghost; Atlas the Mental Giant (who is physically Barnaby&#x27;s size); and Lancelot McSnoyd, the annoying invisible leprechaun who speaks with a Brooklyn accent.

The strip ended when Barnaby reached his sixth birthday, the magical point beyond which he could no longer have a fairy godfather. With much regret, O&#x27;Malley leaves.

==History==
&quot;Barnaby&quot; was primarily a daily strip which began April 20, 1942, and later had a short-lived Sunday strip (December 1, 1946, to May 30, 1948). Instead of hand-lettering, &quot;Barnaby&quot; used typography in the balloons. The typeface is Italic Futura Medium, which was designed by the German typographer Paul Renner in the 1920s.

In 1946, when Johnson began to concentrate on his children&#x27;s books, the strip was drawn by Johnson&#x27;s Connecticut neighbor, artist Jack Morley, who had previously drawn editorial cartoons for the &quot;New York Journal American&quot;. For a year, Morley collaborated on the writing of the strip with Ted Ferro, who teamed with his wife for nine years on their scripts for the daytime comedy-drama radio serial, &quot;Lorenzo Jones&quot;. The Morley/Ferro strips ran from December 31, 1945, to September 14, 1947.

Starting September 14, 1947, Johnson began scripting again, with Morley doing the art. Johnson assisted Morley by giving him specific layouts for each panel, and the credit &quot;Jack Morley and CJ&quot; was then used on the strip. The final story reached a conclusion on February 2, 1952.

==Revival and reprints==
The strip was briefly revived, with adaptations of the early stories minus their World War II references, for a run from September 12, 1960, to April 14, 1962. These strips were redrawn in Johnson&#x27;s style by Warren Sattler.

&quot;Barnaby&quot; received much critical praise when it first appeared, and it has been reprinted in &quot;Barnaby Quarterly&quot; (three issues, 1940s), by Henry Holt and Company (two hardcover books, with strips redrawn), Dover books (reprinting the first hardcover, 1960s), Ballantine Books (six paperbacks, 1980s) and &quot;Comics Revue&quot; magazine. These reprints still command high prices from used book dealers.

Fantagraphics has begun publishing a five-volume series of collections designed by Daniel Clowes, reprinting the entire original run (1942–1952) of the strip. The first volume became available in June 2013, the fourth volume in December 2020, and the fifth and final volume is forthcoming.

==Theater==
Jerome Chodorov wrote a stage adaptation, &quot;Barnaby and Mr. O&#x27;Malley&quot;, which was produced in 1946 by Barney Josephson and James D. Proctor. The play was not a success, with four total performances before it &quot;closed for repairs&quot;, never to return. J. M. Kerrigan starred as O&#x27;Malley, Iris Mann played Jane, and Royal Dano had the role of the leprechaun Launcelot McSnoyd. Barnaby was portrayed by child actor Thomas William Hamilton, who would later become the namesake for the asteroid 4897 Tomhamilton.

The play was later adapted for television as a 1959 episode of the General Electric Theater, hosted by Ronald Reagan and starring Bert Lahr and Ron Howard.

<doc id="185306" wikidata="Q814154" url="?curid=185306" title="Beetle Bailey">
<text>Beetle Bailey is an American comic strip created by cartoonist Mort Walker, published since September 4, 1950. It is set on a fictional United States Army post. In the years just before Walker&#x27;s death in 2018 (at age 94), it was among the oldest comic strips still being produced by its original creator. Over the years, Mort Walker had been assisted by (among others) Jerry Dumas, Bob Gustafson, Frank Johnson and Walker&#x27;s sons, Neal, Brian and Greg Walker, who are continuing the strip after his death.

==Overview==
Beetle was originally a college student at Rockview University, as of September 4, 1950. Although he was as lazy in college as he would be in the service, he did have a broken down jalopy and was the star of the track team (apparently on a scholarship). He had four friends: Bitter Bill; Diamond Jim; Freshman and Sweatsock. He also smoked a pipe. The characters in that early strip were modeled after Walker&#x27;s Kappa Sigma fraternity brothers at the University of Missouri. On March 13, 1951, during the strip&#x27;s first year, Beetle quit school and enlisted in the U.S. Army, where he has remained ever since. His reason for enlisting was because he was running away after being nearly trapped by both his angry jealous first girlfriend &quot;Buzz&quot; and a second girl who was chasing him.

Most of the humor in &quot;Beetle Bailey&quot; revolves around the inept characters stationed at Camp Swampy (inspired by Camp Crowder, where Walker had once been stationed while in the Army), which is located near the town of Hurleyburg at &quot;Parris Island, S.C.&quot; (a real-life Marine Corps base). Private Bailey is a lazy sort who usually naps and avoids work, and thus is often the subject of verbal and physical chastising from his senior NCO, Sergeant Snorkel. The characters never seem to see combat themselves, with the exception of mock battles and combat drills. In fact, they seem to be in their own version of stereotypical comic strip purgatory (initially basic training, they now appear to be stuck in time in a regular infantry division).

The uniforms of Beetle Bailey are still the uniforms of the late 1940s to early 1970s Army, with green fatigues and patrol caps as the basic uniform, and the open jeep as the basic military vehicle. Sergeant First Class Snorkel wears a green dress uniform with a heavily wrinkled garrison cap; the officers wear M1 helmet liners painted with their insignia. Despite this anachronism, modern weapons and equipment do make rare appearances. While Beetle Bailey&#x27;s unit is Company A, one running gag is that the characters are variously seen performing activities associated with different types of units in the Army, such as artillery, armor, infantry and paratroops. Occasionally dream sequences have appeared where the characters see themselves as seasoned combat veterans, such as Sarge having a dream he was General &quot;Storming Snorkel&quot; briefing on Operation Desert Shield, or Beetle imagining himself leaving the Army and returning to school on the G.I. Bill, where female students all know him as &quot;Bombshell Bailey, the famous war hero&quot;.

Beetle is always seen with a hat or helmet which covers his forehead and eyes. Even on leave, his &quot;civvies&quot; include a pork pie hat worn in the same style. He can be seen without it only once—in the original strip, when he was still a college student. The strip was pulled and never ran in any newspaper. It has been printed only in various books on the strip&#x27;s history. One daily strip had Sarge scare Beetle&#x27;s hat off, but Beetle was wearing sunglasses. In a 3/27/1966 dream sequence by Sgt. Snorkel (a parody of the 1960s &quot;Batman&quot;, with Sgt. Snorkel as &quot;Fatman&quot; and Beetle as &quot;Slobber&quot;), the heroes try to stop the infamous &quot;Pizza Pete&quot;; Beetle/Slobber wears a mask but his eyes can be seen The only acknowledged picture of Beetle Bailey&#x27;s eyes (two black dots on a piece of paper held by Beetle and Snorkel) was published in 2000. In his 1975 memoir &quot;Backstage at the Strips&quot;, Walker addressed the question of Beetle&#x27;s eyes, saying:
I constantly get inquiries as to the color of Beetle&#x27;s eyes. As if &quot;I&quot; knew. Black as ink, I suppose, if he &quot;has&quot; any. Maybe there&#x27;s &quot;nothing&quot; under the hat. Why should there be? There is nothing until I draw it, and I&#x27;ve never drawn his eyes. Why, then, should he have any?

One running gag has Sergeant Snorkel hanging helplessly from a small tree branch after having fallen off a cliff, with the first instance running on August 16, 1956. While he is never shown falling off, or even walking close to the edge of a cliff, he always seems to hold on to that same branch, yelling for help.
==Publication history==
During the first two years of &quot;Beetle Bailey&quot;″s run (1950–1952), Walker did all work on the strip himself, including writing, penciling, inking and lettering; however, in 1952 he hired cartoonist Fred Rhoads as his first assistant. After that, numerous people would assist Walker on the strip through the years.

As of 2016, the strip was being syndicated (by King Features) in 1,800 papers in the United States and the rest of the world.

In Sweden, the strip received a dedicated magazine in 1970, with a Norwegian version being added the following year, which is published to this day as of 2020. Denmark also has dedicated (albeit not exclusive) magazine, named &quot;Basserne&quot;, first published in 1973.

==Characters and story==
===Main characters===
*Private Carl James &quot;Beetle&quot; Bailey—the main character and the strip&#x27;s namesake, a feckless, shirking, perpetual goof-off and straggler known for his chronic laziness and generally insubordinate attitude. Slack, hapless, lanky and freckled, Beetle&#x27;s eyes are always concealed, whether by headgear or, in the rare instance of not wearing any (e.g., in the shower), by his hair. He is an expert in camouflage as he is often hiding from Sarge. He is also a better card player than Sgt. Snorkel when he won Snorkel&#x27;s stripes in a poker game. His nickname was given to him by his aunt who thought his freckles made him look like a ladybug beetle. In early strips, it was revealed that he is the brother of Lois Flagston (née Bailey) of the &quot;Hi and Lois&quot; comic strip, which Mort Walker wrote, and Dik Browne drew. Although many of the early comics show Beetle &quot;et al&quot; are from &quot;Company A&quot;, by 2014 the designation had been changed to &quot;Kilo Company&quot; 3rd Battalion of the 9th Infantry Regiment, in the fictional 13th Division. Beetle&#x27;s and Lois&#x27;s grandmother came from Dublin, Ireland. He has an enforced chef&#x27;s palate from being forced to taste Cookie&#x27;s questionable preparations. A running gag is that Beetle is sent to peel potatoes as punishment for screwing up - after 38 years in the army, as of 8-21-1989, he has peeled 50,000 potatoes. On one occasion on field exercises when his &quot;782 gear&quot; was supposed to be laid out for inspection by Halftrack, Beetle was the only soldier to have none of his gear with him; a running gag is Beetle lying down to take a nap anywhere, even in front of Sgt Snorkel. A second gag is Beetle&#x27;s bungling of any simple assignment, even trying to fill the sugar bowls in the mess hall during his first year (the only reason Snorkel didn&#x27;t beat Beetle up is that he felt Beetle should be in the US Navy!)
*Sergeant 1st Class Orville P. Snorkel—Beetle&#x27;s platoon sergeant and nemesis, introduced in 1951. Sarge is known to frequently beat up Beetle for any excuse he can think of, leaving Beetle a shapeless pulp. Once, in the February 2, 1971 strip, he even shoved Beetle through a knothole in the floorboard. Sarge is too lovable to be a villain, however. Obese, snaggle-toothed and volatile, Sarge can be alternately short-tempered and sentimental. He and Beetle seem to have a mutual love/hate relationship; much of the time there is an implied truce between them. They share an uneasy alliance that sometimes borders on genuine (albeit unequal) friendship. Sarge is also a helpless foodie, loves food like crazy and does not miss even a single chance where he can lay his hands on food. He is seen gobbling up cookies and cakes that Beetle&#x27;s mother lovingly sends him. Sarge is sometimes also seen at a pub drinking several glasses of beer. In some early strips Sarge was married, but he was later retconned into an unmarried army lifer, who knows next to nothing about civilian life. Despite his grouchiness and bossiness, Sarge &quot;does&quot; have a soft side, which he usually keeps concealed. He is from Pork Corners, Kansas. He was also known to be very foul-mouthed, even compared to the rest of the cast. Sarge&#x27;s mother&#x27;s maiden name is &quot;Papadopoulos&quot;, suggesting that he is of Greek heritage.
*Otto—Sgt. Snorkel&#x27;s anthropomorphic, look-alike bulldog whom Sarge dresses up the same as himself, in an army uniform. Otto is fiercely protective of Sarge and seems to have a particular antipathy toward Beetle. His first appearance was July 17, 1956; originally he was a regular dog who walked on all fours, but Mort Walker finally decided to make him more human-like. As Walker put it, &quot;I guess he&#x27;s funnier that way.&quot; Otto got his army uniform in the June 6, 1958 strip.
*Brigadier General Amos T. Halftrack—the inept, frustrated, alcoholic commander of Camp Swampy, introduced in 1951. He is 78 years old, from Kenner, Louisiana—though according to Capt. Scabbard he was born in China (April 28, 1971). As of April 26, 1980 he was married to his wife Martha for 30 years (Halftrack says ruefully after being married to his wife for so long that she must take mental telepathy lessons as she knows what he&#x27;s thinking.) He loves to golf, much to his wife Martha&#x27;s dismay; although he is a terrible golfer and scored a hole in one only once likewise his golfing clothes are so ridiculous his wife compares him to clown Ronald McDonald. He sometimes dreams about his secretary, Miss Buxley. At his home, the only one who likes him is his pet dog. He also has a &quot;General Halfrack Fan Club&quot; (1 member) An actual &quot;Half-track&quot; is a military vehicle.
*Miss Buxley—Halftrack&#x27;s beautiful, blonde, buxom civilian secretary—and occasional soldier&#x27;s date (as well as a constant distraction for Halftrack). Miss Buxley has an apparent interest in Beetle and later becomes his girlfriend, but is constantly pursued by Killer. Although she officially became part of the comic strip 11-17-1971; she made an earlier cameo in 1964 as that of a beautiful blond who refused to date Killer because she dated officers only.
*Lieutenant Sonny Fuzz—very young (with noticeably pointy eyebrows and very little facial hair), overly earnest, anal-retentive and &quot;by the book&quot; and highly susceptible to squeaky furniture. The apple-polishing Fuzz is always trying to impress uninterested superiors (especially Halftrack), and &quot;rub it in the noses&quot; of his subordinates. He was introduced March 7, 1956 and even then he was so naive that Pvt Cosmo actually won Fuzz&#x27;s uniform in a dice game. Mort Walker said he modeled the character and personality of Lt. Fuzz on himself, having taken himself too seriously after completing Officer Training. Lt. Fuzz has also managed to get on Sarge&#x27;s bad side, albeit not as much as the enlisted men. A strip had Lt. Fuzz discussing with Sarge about the fact that Beetle Bailey has been a private for a long time and recommends he be sent before a promotion board. Sarge flashes back to all of Beetle&#x27;s errors, then yells in fury at Lt. Fuzz, who has no idea what he did to infuriate Sgt. Snorkel.
*Lieutenant Jackson Flap—the strip&#x27;s first black character, often touchy and suspicious but effortlessly cool, introduced in 1970. Originally wore an afro hairstyle, but later shaved it off as later regulations disallowed many hairdos. Has often been seen with a beard, and is in most ways the total opposite to Lt. Fuzz, even though they share the same rank. Walker created Flap due to critique of the all-White crew of the comic strip, and was immediately censored by US Army newspaper &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; until criticism made the publication revert the decision and publish strips with Flap in them along with the rest.
*Cookie (Cornelius) Jowls—the mess sergeant, who smokes cigarettes while preparing the mess hall&#x27;s questionable menu (infamous for rubbery meatballs and tough-as-rawhide steaks). He practices no sanitary food preparation measures aside from wearing a chef hat, and is almost always seen wearing a tank top. Walker once described him as &quot;the sum of all Army cooks I&#x27;ve met in my life.&quot; He bears a striking resemblance to SFC Snorkel and has also been known to occasionally beat up on Beetle. Like Sarge, he also loves food, though he is not above using Beetle as a guinea pig (which Beetle loathes). Although similar to Sarge, Cookie has had the most tension with Snorkel, particularly when Sarge raided the mess hall after Cookie stopped working and the kitchen was off-limits. In the strip of February 8, 2022, he reveals his real first name to be Cornelius. He also revealed that his sense of taste was nonexistent.
*Private &quot;Killer&quot; Diller—the notorious ladies&#x27; man and Beetle&#x27;s frequent crony—introduced in 1951. His garrison cap wiggles whenever he gets excited about a woman.
*Private Zero—the buck-toothed, naïve farm boy who takes commands and comments literally and misunderstands practically everything. Sometimes Zero, although not lazy (and therefore never assaulted as Beetle often is), infuriates Sarge more than anyone else. He was raised in Cornpone, Nebraska and worked as a farmhand; A running gag that Zero can&#x27;t do anything right-he literally painted Sarge&#x27;s jeep black and white checkered; on a parachute practice jump he ended up upside down; on a routine route march he got separated from his company and asked a farmer if he&#x27;d seen a military company missing a rifleman &quot;who looks just like me&quot;; on Sentry Duty he can&#x27;t remember to give the traditional challenge &quot;Halt! Who Goes there-Friend or Foe&quot;-Whats the Password?
*Private Plato—the Camp&#x27;s resident intellectual; bespectacled, given to scrawling long-winded, analytical, often philosophical graffiti. Named after Plato but based on Walker&#x27;s pal, fellow cartoonist Dik Browne. Plato is the only character other than Beetle to evolve from the early &quot;college&quot; months of the strip.(unlike Beetle he actually graduated from Rockview University before enlisting in the army) Asked his full name, he tells Beetle &quot;Aristotle Anaximenes Heraclitus Papagelis&quot;.

===Supporting characters===
*Private Blips—Gen. Halftrack&#x27;s competent, jaded, not-at-all-buxom secretary (&quot;blips&quot; are small points of light on a radar screen). She resents Halftrack&#x27;s constant ogling of Miss Buxley, and though envious of the latter&#x27;s beauty maintains a polite working relationship with her.
*Chaplain Stainglass—&quot;He&#x27;s praying... he&#x27;s looking at the food... he&#x27;s praying again!&quot; According to &quot;Mort Walker&#x27;s Private Scrapbook&quot;, Walker based the chaplain on Irish actor Barry Fitzgerald&#x27;s priest character from &quot;Going My Way&quot; (1944). He often tries to get Sarge to not beat up Beetle or the men but his efforts either backfire or are futile.
*Martha [Knips] Halftrack—the General&#x27;s formidable, domineering wife. She is 70 years old and is from Morganfield, Kentucky. she also has a pet cat that ignores General Halftrack Her brother Sgt Knips is the senior NCO at Camp Swampy 
*Private Rocky—Camp Swampy&#x27;s long-haired, disgruntled social dissident, a former biker gang member (with a sideline as a shady used car salesman [see comic below]) and rebel-without-a-clue, introduced in 1958. Is the editor of the &quot;Camp Swampy Muckateer&quot;.
*Private Cosmo—Camp Swampy&#x27;s sunglass-wearing, resident &quot;shady entrepreneur&quot; and huckster. Loosely based on William Holden&#x27;s Sefton character from &quot;Stalag 17&quot;.
*Captain Sam Scabbard—hard-nosed, flat-top wearing officer, commander of A Company and usually depicted as competent. Can be firm with Sarge, but also trusts him over Lt. Fuzz. Mort Walker has said that there needed to be at least one normal person in the comic.
*Major Greenbrass—staff officer and golf partner of Gen. Halftrack. He is most often simply a sounding-board for the general, reacting to his superior&#x27;s shenanigans instead of causing his own. In March 2023 he was redesigned with dark skin, making him Black. Since then the strip&#x27;s color department has been inconsistent about his race, at times reverting him to White.
*Private Julius Plewer—fastidious fussbudget, who eventually became Halftrack&#x27;s chauffeur.
*Corporal Yo—the strip&#x27;s only Asian character, introduced in 1990, who tries to help Sarge bring efficiency to Company A. Like Major Greenbrass&#x27; relationship to General Halftrack, Cpl. Yo is most often a conversation partner for Sarge or one of the lieutenants. He is rarely presented as a goof like the other enlisted men frequently are. After 30 years in the strip he was redesigned with an olive complexion and less slanted eyes.
*Dr. Bonkus—Camp Swampy&#x27;s staff psychiatrist.
*Sergeant 1st Class Louise Lugg—a tough soldier who hopes to be Sarge&#x27;s girlfriend, introduced in 1986. Lt. Flap wondered why Lugg was sent to the camp; Halftrack commented that she showed up after he called the Pentagon to request an overseas assignment—&quot;I asked them to send me abroad.&quot; Has romantic interest in Sarge.
*Bella—Sgt. Louise Lugg&#x27;s female cat.
*Specialist Chip Gizmo— Camp Swampy&#x27;s resident computer geek, was named by a write-in contest in 2002. The contest, sponsored by Dell Computer Corp., received more than 84,000 entries. It raised more than $100,000 for the Fisher House Foundation, a non-profit organization that provides housing for families of patients at military and veterans hospitals. Due to his expertise in information technology, he was often seen working near General Halftrack&#x27;s office aiding him and Miss Buxley.

===Retired characters===
*Bunny Piper—Was Beetle&#x27;s seldom-seen girlfriend (from 1959), before he started dating Miss Buxley.
*Buzz—Was Beetle&#x27;s girlfriend before 1959.
* Canteen (early 1950s)—always eating.
* Snake Eyes (early 1950s)—the barracks gambler, replaced by Cosmo, Rocky and others.
* Big Blush (early 1950s)—tall, innocent, and a great attraction to the girls; many of his characteristics incorporated into both Sarge and Zero.
* Fireball (early 1950s)—neophyte who always seems to be in the way, forerunner of both Zero and Lt. Fuzz.
* Bammy (early 1950s)—the southern patriot from Alabama who is still fighting the Civil War.
* Dawg (early 1950s)—the guy in every barracks who creates his own pollution.
* Ozone (late 1950s)—Zero&#x27;s bigger, even more naïve friend. Appeared in a January 6, 1971 cartoon of Company A having an official group photograph 
* Moocher (early 1960s)—stingy and always borrowing things.
* Pop (1960s)—married private: gets yelled at by Sarge all day and goes home at night for more abuse from his wife.
* Sergeant (&quot;Glotis&quot;) Webbing—variously described as being from either B Company or D Company. He somewhat resembles Snorkel, except that he lacks the trademark wrinkles in Snorkel&#x27;s garrison cap and has wavy hair and thick eyebrows. He has pointy teeth. On at least two separate occasions, Webbing engaged Sgt. Snorkel in a cussing duel. He also attempted to one-up Snorkel in anthropomorphizing dogs, leading to Otto&#x27;s first appearance in uniform, and was most recently seen (recognizably, but not mentioned by name) in 1983. On one occasion Beetle tried to win [but failed] a 5 cent bet by having a sleeping Sgt Snorkel outsnore the loudest snoring by Sgt &quot;Glotis&quot; on one occasion Sgt Snorkel was shocked that Beetle was &quot;cheating&quot; when Beetle allowed himself to be beaten up by Sgt Webbing instead of Sgt Snorkel
* Rolf (early 1980s)—civilian tennis instructor, very popular with the female cast (including both Mrs. Halftrack and Miss Buxley, much to General Halftrack&#x27;s consternation). Originally introduced in response to complaints about the constant ogling of Miss Buxley by the male characters. First appearance was in the September 9, 1982 strip, disappeared completely by the mid-1980s.

The early strip was set at Rockview University. When Beetle joined the army, all of the other characters were dropped (although both incarnations of the strip include a bespectacled intellectual named Plato). Four characters from the original cast (Bitter Bill, Diamond Jim, Freshman, and Sweatsock) made at least one appearance, in the January 5, 1963 strip.

===Extras, one-shots and walk-ons===
Beetle&#x27;s family, etc.:

* Mr. and Mrs. Bailey, parents of Beetle, Lois, and Chigger. (The 2/7/52 strip names Beetle&#x27;s father as Gurney.)
* Lois Flagston (née Bailey), Beetle&#x27;s sister; she and her husband are the title characters of the &quot;Hi and Lois&quot; comic strips. Beetle was shown in a crossover where he is first telling Zero and Plato he has taken leave to visit his sister and brother-in-law. He then appears the next day in &quot;Hi &amp; Lois&quot;, wearing civilian clothes.
* Chigger, the younger brother of Beetle and Lois. In a March 2023 appearance, he is short and looks pre-teen.
* Hiram &quot;Hi&quot; Flagston, Beetle&#x27;s brother-in-law and Lois&#x27;s husband.
* Chip, Dot, Ditto, and Trixie Flagston, Hi and Lois&#x27;s children, Beetle&#x27;s nephews and nieces.
* Mr. and Mrs. Piper, Bunny&#x27;s parents
Camp Swampy:
* A camp doctor whose appearance is consistent, but who is unnamed 
* An unnamed officers&#x27; club bartender, frequent intermediary between the Halftracks
* An unnamed Secretary of Defense who has made numerous appearances.
* Popeye the Sailor once made an indirect appearance in the form of a Halloween mask worn by Zero. He made a one-time appearance in a strip dated July 16, 2012.
* 2012 NCS Cartoonist of the Year Tom Richmond made an appearance in a Sunday page.
Numerous one-shot characters have appeared over the years, mostly unnamed, including an inspector general who looks like Alfred E. Neuman, and various officers and civilians. Among the few to be given names is Julian, a nondescript chauffeur eventually replaced by Julius.

==Censorship==

In 1962, the comic strip was censored because it showed a belly button, and in 2006, the description of Rocky&#x27;s criminal past was replaced with a non-criminal past.

===Self-censoring===
Sometimes Mort Walker created strips with raunchy subject matter for his own amusement. This was done at the sketch stage, and those strips were never meant to be published in the U.S. They &quot;end[ed] up in a black box in the bottom drawer&quot;, according to Walker. These sketches were sometimes published in Scandinavia, however, with a translation underneath. In Norway, they appeared in the Norwegian &quot;Beetle Bailey&quot; comic book, &quot;Billy&quot;, with the cover of the comic marked to show it contained censored strips. To offset any possible negative reaction, the publisher experimented with &quot;scrambling&quot; the strips in the mid-1990s. To see them, the reader had to view them through a &quot;de-scrambling&quot; plastic card. This was discontinued soon afterward, and the strips later were printed without scrambling. In Sweden, some of these strips were collected in the &quot;Alfapocket&quot; series.

==Animation==
A television series based on the strip, consisting of 50 six-minute animated cartoon shorts produced by King Features Syndicate, was animated by Paramount Cartoon Studios in the U.S. and Artransa Film Studios in Sydney, Australia. The series was first broadcast in 1963 as part of &quot;The King Features Trilogy&quot;. 50 episodes were produced.

The opening credits included the sound of a bugle reveille, followed by a theme song specifically composed for the cartoon.
In the closing credits Geoff Pike was listed as Director.

Beetle was voiced by comic actor and director Howard Morris with Allan Melvin as the voice of Sarge. Other King Features properties, such as &quot;Snuffy Smith&quot; and &quot;Krazy Kat&quot;, also appeared in the syndicated series, under the collective title &quot;Beetle Bailey and His Friends&quot;. June Foray did the voice of Bunny, plus all of the female characters involved.

Beetle and Sgt. Snorkel were featured prominently in the animated television film &quot;Popeye Meets the Man Who Hated Laughter&quot;, which debuted on October 7, 1972, as an episode of &quot;The ABC Saturday Superstar Movie&quot;. In the beginning of the show, General Halftrack, and Lt. Flap also appeared in the Chinese Restaurant scene.

===1989 special===
A 30-minute animated TV special co-written by Mort Walker and Hank Saroyan was produced for CBS in 1989, but did not air due to management changes at the CBS network. It has been released on DVD alongside the 1960s cartoons. Greg Whalen played Beetle, Bob Bergen portrayed Killer, Henry Corden was Sgt. Snorkel, Frank Welker was both Zero and Otto, Linda Gary voiced both Miss Buxley and Ms. Blips and General Halftrack was Larry Storch. This special was one of a number of specials made in the same timeframe by King Features/Hearst for TV as potential series pilots; others included &quot;Blondie &amp; Dagwood&quot; (co-produced with Marvel Productions, who had also collaborated with King Features for the &quot;Defenders of the Earth&quot; series a few years before) and &quot;Hägar the Horrible&quot; (co-produced with Hanna-Barbera Productions).

==Musical theatre==
In 1988, a musical based on the comic strip premiered at Candlewood Playhouse in New Fairfield, Connecticut for a limited run. Music and lyrics were by Neil and Gretchen Gould. In addition to the familiar characters from the strip, the plot introduced a wayward computer that promoted Bailey to three-star general.

==Licensing==
* Over the years, &quot;Beetle Bailey&quot; characters have been licensed for dolls, T-shirts, salt and pepper shakers, toys, telephones, music boxes, handpuppets, coffee mugs, cookie jars, neckties, lunchboxes, paperback books, games, bobblehead nodders, banks, lapel pins and greeting cards. The Multiple Plastics Corporation manufactured a 1964 Camp Swampy playset, a tie-in with the cartoon TV show, with character figures accompanying the usual MPC toy GIs and military vehicles.
* In 2000, Dark Horse Comics issued two collectible figures of Beetle and Sarge as part of their line of Classic Comic Characters—statues No. 11 and 12, respectively. In honor of the strip&#x27;s 50th anniversary, DHC also produced a boxed PVC figure set of seven &quot;Beetle Bailey&quot; characters (Beetle, Sarge, Gen. Halftrack, Miss Buxley, Otto, Lt. Flap and Cookie).
* BCI Eclipse has released 20 episodes of &quot;Beetle Bailey&quot; as part of &quot;Animated All Stars&quot;, a 2-DVD set (BCI 46952). Rhino Home Video also released a DVD containing 10 episodes, along with a couple of &quot;Hägar the Horrible&quot; and &quot;Betty Boop&quot; cartoons. In 2007, &quot;Beetle Bailey: The Complete Collection&quot; was released to DVD, containing all 50 shorts grouped randomly into 13 episodes, plus a previously unaired 1989 TV special.
* For &quot;Beetle Bailey&quot;″s 50th anniversary in 2000, Gate offered a 1/18th Willys MB with figurines of Beetle, Sarge and Otto. The figures were the same scale as the Jeep and were molded in seated poses, so they could be placed in the seats of the model. The Jeep could also be ordered without the figures, with figurines of Laurel and Hardy, or figurines of Laurel and Hardy in sailor suits.
* In 2010, fashion designer Dr. X and Bloomingdale&#x27;s unveiled a limited edition retro/punk rock style line of clothing including T-shirts, leather jackets, Beetle-themed Chuck Taylors shoes and various accessories.
* In 2012, Rolex and Bamford Watch Department created a Beetle Bailey Rolex watch.

==Beyond the strip==
* &quot;Beetle Bailey&quot; also successfully appeared in comic books from 1953 to 1980. The first series was published by Dell Comics, then Gold Key Comics, King Comics and Charlton Comics. Harvey Comics ran a much-later second series from 1992 to 1994.
* The comic strip &quot;Hi and Lois&quot;, co-created by Mort Walker and Dik Browne, is a spin-off from &quot;Beetle Bailey&quot; (Beetle&#x27;s sister is Lois Flagston). &quot;Hi and Lois&quot;, also syndicated by King Features, debuted in 1954. Characters from one strip occasionally make guest appearances in the other.
* A &quot;Beetle Bailey&quot; parody in &quot;Mad&quot; from the late 1960s portrays Sarge and Captain Scabbard finally wresting the cap off Beetle&#x27;s face—revealing the words &quot;Get Out of Viet Nam!&quot; tattooed on his forehead.
* Beetle again appeared in a 1988 issue of &quot;Mad&quot;, alongside Sarge, in a segment explaining human anatomy according to cartoonists. Sarge&#x27;s head shape was used as an example of a &quot;sloping, subhuman skull type&quot; which was also noted in Michael Patterson of &quot;For Better or for Worse&quot;. Beetle was featured in the section on eyes about having concealed eyes; &quot;beetlus yardbirdus&quot;.
* Beetle and Sarge guest-starred in the 75th anniversary party of &quot;Blondie&quot;″s Blondie and Dagwood in 2005.
* An animated segment featuring Beetle Bailey and his company was seen during the 1970s and 1980s on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, demonstrating to young viewers the concept of &quot;first&quot; and &quot;last&quot;.
* A life-size bronze sculpture of Beetle designed by Mort Walker with his son Neal assisting in the sculpting was unveiled at Walker&#x27;s alma mater, the University of Missouri, on October 23, 1992.

<doc id="185307" wikidata="Q136783" url="?curid=185307" title="Magical thinking">
<text>Magical thinking, or superstitious thinking, is the belief that unrelated events are causally connected despite the absence of any plausible causal link between them, particularly as a result of supernatural effects. Examples include the idea that personal thoughts can influence the external world without acting on them, or that objects must be causally connected if they resemble each other or have come into contact with each other in the past. Magical thinking is a type of fallacious thinking and is a common source of invalid causal inferences. Unlike the confusion of correlation with causation, magical thinking does not require the events to be correlated.

The precise definition of magical thinking may vary subtly when used by different theorists or among different fields of study. In psychology, magical thinking is the belief that one&#x27;s thoughts by themselves can bring about effects in the world or that thinking something corresponds with doing it. These beliefs can cause a person to experience an irrational fear of performing certain acts or having certain thoughts because of an assumed correlation between doing so and threatening calamities. In psychiatry, magical thinking defines false beliefs about the capability of thoughts, actions or words to cause or prevent undesirable events. It is a commonly observed symptom in thought disorder, schizotypal personality disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

== Types ==
=== Direct effect ===
Bronisław Malinowski&#x27;s &quot;Magic, Science and Religion&quot; (1954) discusses another type of magical thinking, in which words and sounds are thought to have the ability to directly affect the world. This type of wish fulfillment thinking can result in the avoidance of talking about certain subjects (&quot;Speak of the devil and he&#x27;ll appear&quot;), the use of euphemisms instead of certain words, or the belief that to know the &quot;true name&quot; of something gives one power over it; or that certain chants, prayers, or mystical phrases will bring about physical changes in the world. More generally, it is magical thinking to take a symbol to be its referent or an analogy to represent an identity.

Sigmund Freud believed that magical thinking was produced by cognitive developmental factors. He described practitioners of magic as projecting their mental states onto the world around them, similar to a common phase in child development. From toddlerhood to early school age, children will often link the outside world with their internal consciousness, e.g. &quot;It is raining because I am sad.&quot;

=== Symbolic approaches ===
Another theory of magical thinking is the symbolic approach. Leading thinkers of this category, including Stanley J. Tambiah, believe that magic is meant to be expressive, rather than instrumental. As opposed to the direct, mimetic thinking of Frazer, Tambiah asserts that magic utilizes abstract analogies to express a desired state, along the lines of metonymy or metaphor.

An important question raised by this interpretation is how mere symbols could exert material effects. One possible answer lies in John L. Austin&#x27;s concept of performativity, in which the act of saying something makes it true, such as in an inaugural or marital rite. Other theories propose that magic is effective because symbols are able to affect internal psycho-physical states. They claim that the act of expressing a certain anxiety or desire can be reparative in itself.

== Causes ==

According to theories of anxiety relief and control, people turn to magical beliefs when there exists a sense of uncertainty and potential danger, and with little access to logical or scientific responses to such danger. Magic is used to restore a sense of control over circumstance. In support of this theory, research indicates that superstitious behavior is invoked more often in high stress situations, especially by people with a greater desire for control.

Boyer and Liénard propose that in obsessive-compulsive rituals — a possible clinical model for certain forms of magical thinking — focus shifts to the lowest level of gestures, resulting in goal demotion. For example, an obsessive-compulsive cleaning ritual may overemphasize the order, direction, and number of wipes used to clean the surface. The goal becomes less important than the actions used to achieve the goal, with the implication that magic rituals can persist without efficacy because the intent is lost within the act. Alternatively, some cases of harmless &quot;rituals&quot; may have positive effects in bolstering intent, as may be the case with certain pre-game exercises in sports.

Some scholars believe that magic is effective psychologically. They cite the placebo effect and psychosomatic disease as prime examples of how our mental functions exert power over our bodies. 

=== Phenomenological approach ===
Ariel Glucklich tries to understand magic from a subjective perspective, attempting to comprehend magic on a phenomenological, ly based level. Glucklich seeks to describe the attitude that magical practitioners feel what he calls &quot;magical consciousness&quot; or the &quot;magical experience&quot;. He explains that it is based upon &quot;the awareness of the interrelatedness of all things in the world by means of simple but refined sense perception.&quot;

Another phenomenological model is that of Gilbert Lewis, who argues that &quot;habit is unthinking&quot;. He believes that those practicing magic do not think of an explanatory theory behind their actions any more than the average person tries to grasp the pharmaceutical workings of aspirin. When the average person takes an aspirin, he does not know how the medicine chemically functions. He takes the pill with the premise that there is proof of efficacy. Similarly, many who avail themselves of magic do so without feeling the need to understand a causal theory behind it.

==In children==
According to Jean Piaget&#x27;s Theory of Cognitive Development, magical thinking is most prominent in children between ages 2 and 7. Due to examinations of grieving children, it is said that during this age, children strongly believe that their personal thoughts have a direct effect on the rest of the world. It is posited that their minds will create a reason to feel responsible if they experience something tragic that they do not understand, e.g. a death. Jean Piaget, a developmental psychologist, came up with a theory of four developmental stages. 

Children between ages 2 and 7 would be classified under his preoperational stage of development. During this stage children are still developing their use of logical thinking. A child&#x27;s thinking is dominated by perceptions of physical features, meaning that if the child is told that a family pet has &quot;gone away to a farm&quot; when it has in fact died, then the child will have difficulty comprehending the transformation of the dog not being around anymore. Magical thinking would be evident here, since the child may believe that the family pet being gone is just temporary. Their young minds in this stage do not understand the finality of death and magical thinking may bridge the gap.

===Grief===
It was discovered that children often feel that they are responsible for an event or events occurring or are capable of reversing an event simply by thinking about it and wishing for a change: namely, &quot;magical thinking&quot;. Make-believe and fantasy are an integral part of life at this age and are often used to explain the inexplicable.

According to Piaget, children within this age group are often &quot;egocentric&quot;, believing that what they feel and experience is the same as everyone else&#x27;s feelings and experiences. Also at this age, there is often a lack of ability to understand that there may be other explanations for events outside of the realm of things they have already comprehended. What happens outside their understanding needs to be explained using what they already know, because of an inability to fully comprehend abstract concepts.

Magical thinking is found particularly in children&#x27;s explanations of experiences about death, whether the death of a family member or pet, or their own illness or impending death. These experiences are often new for a young child, who at that point has no experience to give understanding of the ramifications of the event. A child may feel that they are responsible for what has happened, simply because they were upset with the person who died, or perhaps played with the pet too roughly. There may also be the idea that if the child wishes it hard enough, or performs just the right act, the person or pet may choose to come back, and not be dead any longer. 

When considering their own illness or impending death, some children may feel that they are being punished for doing something wrong, or not doing something they should have, and therefore have become ill. If a child&#x27;s ideas about an event are incorrect because of their magical thinking, there is a possibility that the conclusions the child makes could result in long-term beliefs and behaviours that create difficulty for the child as they mature.

==Related terms==
&quot;Quasi-magical thinking&quot; describes &quot;cases in which people act as if they erroneously believe that their action influences the outcome, even though they do not really hold that belief&quot;. People may realize that a superstitious intuition is logically false, but act as if it were true because they do not exert an effort to correct the intuition.

<doc id="185311" wikidata="Q2916312" url="?curid=185311" title="United States presidential primary">
<text>Each of the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and five territories of the United States holds either primary elections or caucuses to help nominate individual candidates for president of the United States. This process is designed to choose the candidates that will represent their political parties in the general election.

The United States Constitution has never specified this process; political parties have developed their own procedures over time. Some states hold only primary elections, some hold only caucuses, and others use a combination of both. These primaries and caucuses are staggered, generally beginning sometime in January or February, and ending about mid-June before the general election in November. State and local governments run the primary elections, while caucuses are private events that are directly run by the political parties themselves. A state&#x27;s primary election or caucus is usually an indirect election: instead of voters directly selecting a particular person running for president, they determine the number of delegates a candidate will receive from their respective state for each party&#x27;s national convention. These delegates then in turn select their party&#x27;s presidential nominee. The first state in the United States to hold its presidential primary was North Dakota in 1912, following on Oregon&#x27;s successful implementation of its system in 1910.

Each party determines how many delegates it allocates to each state. Along with those &quot;pledged&quot; delegates chosen during the primaries and caucuses, state delegations to both the Democratic and Republican conventions also include &quot;unpledged&quot; delegates who have a vote. For Republicans, they consist of the three top party officials who serve &quot;At Large&quot; from each state and territory. Democrats have a more expansive group of unpledged delegates called &quot;superdelegates&quot;, who are party leaders and elected officials. If no single candidate has secured an absolute majority of delegates (including both pledged and unpledged), then a &quot;brokered convention&quot; occurs: all pledged delegates are &quot;released&quot; after the first round of voting and are able to switch their allegiance to a different candidate, and then additional rounds take place until there is a winner with an absolute majority.

The staggered nature of the presidential primary season allows candidates to concentrate their resources in each area of the country one at a time instead of campaigning in every state simultaneously. In some of the less populous states, this allows campaigning to take place on a much more personal scale. However, the overall results of the primary season may not be representative of the U.S. electorate as a whole: voters in Iowa, New Hampshire and other less populous states which traditionally hold their primaries and caucuses in late-January/February usually have a major impact on the races, while voters in California and other large states which traditionally hold their primaries in June generally end up having a significantly reduced say because the races are usually over by then. As a result, more states vie for earlier primaries, known as &quot;front-loading&quot;, to claim a greater influence in the process. The national parties have used penalties and awarded bonus delegates in efforts to stagger the system over broadly a 90-day window. Where state legislatures set the primary or caucus date, sometimes the out-party in that state has endured penalties in the number of delegates it can send to the national convention.

==History==
=== Background ===
There is no provision for the role of political parties in the United States Constitution, since the Founding Fathers did not originally intend for American politics to be partisan. In Federalist Papers No. 9 and No. 10, Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, respectively, wrote specifically about the dangers of domestic political factions. Thus in the first two presidential elections, the Electoral College handled the nominations and elections in 1789 and 1792 that selected George Washington. The beginnings of the American two-party system then emerged from Washington&#x27;s immediate circle of advisors. Hamilton and Madison, who wrote the aforementioned Federalist Papers against political factions, ended up being the core leaders in this partisanship: Hamilton became the leader of Federalist Party while Madison co-helmed the Democratic-Republican Party with Thomas Jefferson.

=== Congressional caucus era (17961832) ===
Starting with the 1796 election, congressional party or a state legislature party caucus selected the party&#x27;s presidential candidates. Before 1820, Democratic-Republican members of Congress would nominate a single candidate from their party. That system collapsed in 1824, and since 1832 the preferred mechanism for nomination has been a national convention.

=== Caucus and convention era (18321912) ===
The first national convention to nominate a presidential candidate was called by the Anti-Masonic Party in 1831, as they could not use the caucus system because they had no congressmen. The party leaders instead called for a national meeting of supporters to set the party&#x27;s candidate. This convention was held in Baltimore, Maryland, on September 26, 1831, which selected William Wirt as their presidential candidate.

Delegates to the national convention were usually selected at state conventions whose own delegates were chosen by district conventions. Sometimes they were dominated by intrigue between political bosses who controlled delegates; the national convention was far from democratic or transparent.

=== Mixed primary and caucus era (191268) ===
Progressive Era reformers looked to the primary election as a way to measure popular opinion of candidates, as opposed to the opinion of the bosses. Florida enacted the first presidential primary in 1901. The Wisconsin direct open primary of 1905 was the first to eliminate the caucus and mandate direct selection of national convention delegates. In 1910, Oregon became the first state to establish a presidential preference primary, which requires delegates to the National Convention to support the winner of the primary at the convention. By 1912, twelve states either selected delegates in primaries, used a preferential primary, or both. By 1920 there were 20 states with primaries, but some went back, and from 1936 to 1968, 12 states used them.

The primary received its first major test in the 1912 election pitting incumbent president William Howard Taft against challengers Theodore Roosevelt and Robert La Follette. Roosevelt proved the most popular candidate, but as most primaries were non-binding &quot;preference&quot; shows and held in only fourteen of the-then forty-eight states, the Republican nomination went to Taft, who controlled the convention.

Seeking to boost voter turnout, New Hampshire simplified its ballot access laws in 1949. In the ensuing non-binding &quot;beauty contest&quot; of 1952, Republican Dwight Eisenhower demonstrated his broad voter appeal by out-polling the favored Robert A. Taft, &quot;Mr. Republican.&quot; Also, Democrat Estes Kefauver defeated incumbent president Harry S. Truman, leading the latter to decide not to run for another term.
The first-in-the-nation New Hampshire primary has since become a widely observed test of candidates&#x27; viability.

=== National binding primary era (1972present) ===
The impetus for national adoption of the binding primary election was the chaotic 1968 Democratic National Convention. Vice President Hubert Humphrey secured the presidential nomination despite not winning a single primary under his own name. After this, a Democratic National Committee-commissioned panel led by Senator George McGovern – the McGovern–Fraser Commission – recommended that states adopt new rules to assure wider participation. A large number of states, faced with the need to conform to more detailed rules for the selection of national delegates, chose a presidential primary as an easier way to come into compliance with the new national Democratic Party rules. The result was that many more future delegates would be selected by a state presidential primary. The Republicans also adopted many more state presidential primaries. By 1992, Democrats had primaries in 40 states and Republicans in 39.

==Procedure==
Both major political parties of the U.S.—the Democratic Party and the Republican Party—officially nominate their candidate for president at their respective national conventions. Each of these conventions is attended by a number of delegates selected in accordance with the given party&#x27;s bylaws. The results of the presidential primaries and caucuses bind many of these delegates, known as pledged delegates, to vote for a particular candidate.

Both parties also have a group of unpledged delegates. Republicans have three &quot;At-Large&quot; delegates selected at the state convention from all the states and territories, 168 in number. These are each states&#x27; two national committeepersons and the state chairperson.

In Democratic primaries through 2016, about 85% of delegates to the Democratic National Convention are &quot;pledged delegates&quot; who are apportioned to candidates according to the results of primaries and caucuses. The remaining 15% are unpledged superdelegates (consisting of sitting Democratic governors, sitting Democratic members of Congress [i.e., senators and representatives], former and current Democratic presidents and vice presidents, and a few leaders of Democratic National Committee-affiliated organizations, such as the Young Democrats of America) who can vote for whomever they wish. Some superdelegates are former or current state or federal lobbyists. In 2016, following a push by independent Senator Bernie Sanders, who ran as a Democrat, the party voted in favor of superdelegate reform, such that in future presidential elections most superdelegates will be bound to their state primary results.

===Types of primaries and caucuses===

Franchise in a primary or caucus is governed by rules established by the state party, although the states may impose other regulations.

While most states hold primary elections, a handful of states hold caucuses. Instead of going to a polling place, voters attend local private events run by the political parties, and cast their selections there. One disadvantage of caucuses is that the state party runs the process directly instead of having the state and local governments run them. Another is that most election laws do not normally apply to caucuses.

Nearly all states have a &quot;binding&quot; primary or caucus, in which the results of the election depending on state law or party rules legally &quot;bind&quot; some or all of the delegates to vote for a particular candidate at the national convention, for a certain number of ballots or until the candidate releases the delegates. Some binding primaries are &quot;winner-take-all&quot; contests, in which all of a state&#x27;s delegates are required to vote for the same candidate. In a &quot;proportional vote&quot;, a state&#x27;s delegation is allocated in proportion to the candidates&#x27; percent of the popular vote in a congressional district. In many of those states that have proportional vote primaries, a candidate must meet a certain threshold in the popular vote to be given delegates.

Some states may use a binding &quot;walking subcaucus&quot; system, where voters may instead be choosing pledged delegates to a local, county or state party convention, which then, in turn, selects pledged delegates to the national convention. A handful of states may also practice &quot;non-binding&quot; &quot;beauty contests&quot;, which are public opinion surveys for use by caucus delegates to select candidates to a state convention, which then in turn selects delegates to the national convention.

In many states, only voters registered with a party may vote in that party&#x27;s primary, known as a closed primary. In some states, a semi-closed primary is practiced, in which voters unaffiliated with a party (independents) may choose a party primary in which to vote. In an open primary, any voter may vote in any party&#x27;s primary. A semi-open primary occurs when a voter must choose a party-specific ballot to cast, instead of being provided a single ballot where the voter must choose on the ballot itself which party&#x27;s primary to vote in. In all of these systems, a voter may participate in only one primary; that is, a voter who casts a vote for a candidate standing for the Republican nomination for president cannot cast a vote for a candidate standing for the Democratic nomination, or vice versa. A few states once staged a blanket primary, in which voters could vote for one candidate in multiple primaries, but the practice was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 2000 case of &quot;California Democratic Party v. Jones&quot; as violating the freedom of assembly guaranteed by the First Amendment.

===Delegate selection rules===
Both the Democratic Party and the Republican Party usually modify their delegate selection rules between presidential elections, including how delegates are allocated to each state and territory.

Under the current Democratic Party selection rules, adopted in 2006, pledged delegates are selected under proportional representation, which requires a candidate have a minimum of 15% of a state&#x27;s popular vote to receive delegates. In addition, the Democratic Party may reject any candidate under their bylaws. Each state publishes a Delegate Selection Plan that notes the mechanics of calculating the number of delegates per congressional district, and how votes are transferred from local conventions to the state and national convention. Since the 2012 Democratic primaries, the number of pledged delegates allocated to each of the 50 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., is based on two main factors: (1) the proportion of votes each state gave to the Democratic candidate in the last three presidential elections, and (2) the number of electoral votes each state has in the United States Electoral College. The U.S. Territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands are instead assigned a fixed number of pledged delegates. States and territories who schedule their primary or caucus later in the primary season may also get additional bonus delegates.

The Republican Party&#x27;s rules since 2008 leave more discretion to the states in choosing a method of allocating pledged delegates. As a result, states variously applied the statewide winner-take-all method (e.g., New York), district- and state-level winner-take-all (e.g., California), or proportional allocation (e.g., Massachusetts). Changes in the rules before 2012 brought proportional representation to more states. The number of Republican pledged delegates allocated to each of the 50 U.S. states is 10 at-large delegates, plus three district delegates for each congressional district. Washington, D.C., and the five U.S. Territories are instead assigned a fixed number of pledged delegates. States and territories get bonus delegates based on whether it (if applicable) has a Republican governor, it has GOP majorities in one or all chambers of its state legislature, whether one or both of its U.S. senators are Republican, it has a GOP majority in its delegation to the U.S. House of Representatives, and whether its electoral college votes went to the Republican candidate in the last presidential election.

Each party&#x27;s bylaws also specify which current and former elected officeholders and party leaders qualify as unpledged delegates. Because of possible deaths, resignations, or the results of intervening or special elections, the final number of these superdelegates may not be known until the week of the convention.

===In U.S. territories===
The primary and caucus system is the only method in which voters in Puerto Rico, Guam, and other U.S. territories can have a say in the presidential race. Under the U.S. Constitution, U.S. territories are not represented in the Electoral College, and thus voters residing in those areas are basically ineligible to vote in the general election. On the other hand, as stated above, the primaries and caucuses are non-governmental party affairs. Both the Democratic and Republican parties, as well as other third parties, have agreed to let these territories participate in the presidential nomination process. In the two major party&#x27;s rules, &quot;territories&quot; are referred to as &quot;states&quot;, which can be carried over in discussion and media implying there are more than 50 states.

===Delegate voting at the convention===
During the convention, there is generally a roll call of the votes. Each delegation announces its vote tallies, usually accompanied with some boosterism of their state or territory. The delegation may pass, nominally to retally their delegates&#x27; preferences, but often to allow a different delegation to give the leading candidate the honor of casting the majority-making vote.

If no single candidate has secured a majority of delegates (including both pledged and unpledged) during the first vote, then a &quot;brokered convention&quot; results. All pledged delegates are then &quot;released&quot; and are able to switch their allegiance to a different candidate. Thereafter, the nomination is decided through a process of alternating political horse trading, and additional rounds of re-votes.

A customary ceremonial practice has been for the losing candidate(s) in the primary season to &quot;release&quot; their delegates at the convention and exhort them to vote for the winning nominee as a sign of party unity. Thus, the vote tallied on the convention floor is unanimous or nearly so. For example, during the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Hillary Clinton (who only captured about 22% of delegates compared to Barack Obama&#x27;s approximate 72%) moved to nominate Obama by acclamation, making it a unanimous vote.

==Calendar==
Campaigning for president often begins almost a year before the New Hampshire primary, almost two years before the presidential election. This is largely because federal campaign finance laws including the Federal Election Campaign Act state that a candidate who intends to receive contributions aggregating in excess of $5,000 or make expenditures aggregating in excess of $5,000, among others, must first file a Statement of Candidacy with the Federal Election Commission. Thus, presidential candidates officially announce their intentions to run that early so they can start raising or spending the money needed to mount their nationwide campaigns.

During the first six months of the year, primaries and caucuses are separately held in each of the 50 states; the District of Columbia, and each of the five permanently inhabited US territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands. Each party sets its own calendar and rules, and in some cases actually administers the election. However, to reduce expenses and encourage turnout, the major parties&#x27; primaries are usually held the same day and may be consolidated with other state elections. The primary election itself is administered by local governments according to state law. In some cases, state law determines how delegates will be awarded and who may participate in the primary; where it does not, party rules prevail.

Since the 1970s, states have held increasingly early primaries to maximize their leverage (see &quot;Front-loading and compression&quot; below). In reaction to these moves, both the Democratic and Republican National Committees imposed a timing tier system of scheduling rules, stripping states of delegates if they move their primaries early, such as the case in both the Florida Democratic primary and the Florida Republican primary in 2008.

===Iowa and New Hampshire===


The first binding event, in which a candidate can secure convention delegates, is traditionally the Iowa caucus, usually held in late January or early February of the presidential election year. It is generally followed by the New Hampshire primary, the first primary by tradition since 1920 and by New Hampshire state law. New Hampshire law states the primary shall be held &quot;on the Tuesday at least seven days immediately preceding the date on which any other state shall hold a similar election.&quot; The Iowa caucuses are not considered to be &quot;a similar election&quot; under New Hampshire&#x27;s law because the former uses caucuses instead of primary elections. Should any other state move its primary too close to New Hampshire&#x27;s, or before, the New Hampshire secretary of state is required to reschedule the primary accordingly.

In recent elections, the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary have garnered over half the media attention paid to the entire selection process. After Iowa and New Hampshire, the front runners then attempt to solidify their status, while the others fight to become #2.

Because these states are small, campaigning takes place on a much more personal scale. As a result, even a little-known, underfunded candidate can use retail politics to meet intimately with interested voters and perform better than expected. The Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary have produced a number of headline-making upsets in history:
* Harry S. Truman ended his presidential re-election bid in 1952 after losing the Democratic Party&#x27;s New Hampshire primary.
*Lyndon Baines Johnson dropped his 1968 presidential reelection bid after performing far below expectations in the Democratic Party&#x27;s New Hampshire primary.
* In the 1972 Democratic primaries, George McGovern was initially considered a dark horse but he had better-than-expected second-place finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire and eventually won the nomination; frontrunner Edmund Muskie who won both contests instead lost momentum.
* Jimmy Carter had entered the 1976 presidential race with extremely low name recognition and seemingly little chance against nationally better-known politicians but Carter became the Democratic Party front-runner early on by winning the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary and he went on to win the nomination.
* George H. W. Bush won the Iowa caucus in 1980, leading him to claim that he had &quot;Big Mo&quot; (momentum) over Republican Party presidential frontrunner Ronald Reagan. However, Reagan won the New Hampshire primary and several others to take the nomination. Eight years later, in the 1988 Republican presidential nomination battle, Bush, serving as Reagan&#x27;s vice president, unexpectedly finished third in Iowa which Bob Dole won. Dole was also leading in New Hampshire polls but ended up losing that primary as he failed to counterattack ads from Bush. Bush had no serious trouble clinching the nomination afterward.
* Gary Hart was initially not considered a serious contender in 1984, which featured former vice president Walter Mondale as the Democratic Party presidential frontrunner. However, Hart had a respectable showing in Iowa and then stunned Mondale in New Hampshire, the latter where Hart had started campaigning months earlier. This resulted in a long primary battle, with Mondale eventually emerging as the nominee after Super Tuesday III.
* Pat Buchanan&#x27;s 2nd place showing in the 1992 and win in the 1996 New Hampshire primaries coincided with the weakness of the future Republican Party presidential nominees, incumbent George H. W. Bush, and Senator Bob Dole respectively; Bush and Dole subsequently lost the general election.
* In 1992, then-Governor Bill Clinton&#x27;s better-than-expected second-place finish in New Hampshire salvaged his campaign and he went on to win the Democratic Party&#x27;s presidential nomination, following on to be elected president with a 43% plurality.
* Senator John McCain upset George W. Bush in the Republican Party&#x27;s New Hampshire primary in 2000, Bush&#x27;s frontrunner campaign had initially not expected serious opposition after other potential candidates like Elizabeth Dole and Dan Quayle decided not to run. McCain&#x27;s new-found momentum ended after his defeat in the South Carolina primary (see below), and though he pulled out wins in Michigan and his home state of Arizona, his campaign was ended by Super Tuesday.
* In the 2004 primaries, John Kerry, whose campaign had been sagging in prior months, won the Democratic Party&#x27;s Iowa caucus while John Edwards unexpectedly finished second, over heavily favored Howard Dean and Richard Gephardt (the latter two had been trading negative attacks in the weeks leading up to the vote). Gephardt immediately ended his campaign, while Dean&#x27;s post-concession speech drew negative attention. Kerry went on to overcome Dean&#x27;s initial lead in New Hampshire to win that primary, and eventually the Democratic presidential nomination.
* In 2008, Democratic Party presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton, whose campaign initially banked on a knockout victory in Iowa, unexpectedly finished third in that caucus behind winner Barack Obama and John Edwards. Clinton then pulled off a comeback victory in New Hampshire where Obama had been leading the polls. Although Obama and Clinton were largely well matched in most of the subsequent primaries, Obama&#x27;s better organization and uncontested caucus victories were crucial to his winning the Democratic nomination.
* In 2008, John McCain, initially struggling among Republican Party contenders in 2007, decided to skip Iowa and concentrate on New Hampshire (the same primary where he had unexpectedly triumphed back in 2000) and McCain&#x27;s win rejuvenated his presidential campaign and he became the Republican nominee. Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, two candidates who had each led in the polls in 2007, did not perform as expected in Iowa and New Hampshire.
* In 2012, Mitt Romney was initially reported to be the first Republican Party &quot;non-incumbent&quot; presidential candidate, since the Iowa caucus started in 1976, to win both the Iowa caucus (albeit, by an 8-vote margin over Rick Santorum) and New Hampshire primary. However a final count released by the Iowa state party sixteen days after the caucus contest reported Santorum as the winner by 34 votes over Romney, but by then Romney had already won New Hampshire by a comfortable margin.

===Nevada===
In 2008 Nevada was given the official &quot;First in the West&quot; status reflecting the growing importance of the West as well as Nevada&#x27;s electoral bellwether status. America&#x27;s increasing ethnic diversity, urbanization, and geographic redistribution made influential political leaders come to the realization that Iowa and New Hampshire were not representative of the rest of the country. Following the 2004 election, then-Senate majority leader Harry Reid began making a case for Nevada as the perfect American microcosm. Since 2012, the Nevada caucuses have been the third race in the process after Iowa and New Hampshire.

===South Carolina===
South Carolina is generally the &quot;First in the South&quot; primary. For the Republicans, it is considered a &quot;firewall&quot; to protect establishment favorites and frontrunners in the presidential nomination race, being designed to stop the momentum of insurgent candidates who could have received a boost from strong showings in Iowa and New Hampshire. From its inception in 1980 through the election of 2008, the winner of the South Carolina Republican presidential primary has gone on to win the nomination. In the 2012 Republican primaries, Newt Gingrich initially finished poorly in the early states, but then scored an upset victory in South Carolina over frontrunner Mitt Romney. However, after suffering a decisive defeat to Romney in Florida, Gingrich&#x27;s campaign was relegated back to third place, leaving Rick Santorum as the main challenger to Romney for the rest of the primaries.

In 2020, a decisive win in the South Carolina primary helped former Vice President Joe Biden win the Democratic presidential primary by eliminating several rivals and triggering strong wins across the country on Super Tuesday. Biden had previously struggled in Iowa and New Hampshire.

===Super Tuesday===
The Tuesday in February or March when the greatest number of states hold primary elections and caucuses is known as &quot;Super Tuesday&quot;. Because it is held in various states from geographically and socially diverse regions of the country, it typically represents a presidential candidate&#x27;s first test of national electability. More delegates can be won on Super Tuesday than on any other single day of the primary calendar, thus convincing wins during this day have usually propelled candidates to their party&#x27;s nomination.

===Front-loading and coordination===
With the broadened use of the primary system, states have tried to increase their influence in the nomination process. One tactic has been to create geographic blocs to encourage candidates to spend time in a region. Vermont and Massachusetts attempted to stage a joint New England primary on the first Tuesday of March, but New Hampshire refused to participate so it could retain its traditional place as the first primary. The first regional primary was the Southern Super Tuesday of March 8, 1988, in which nine states united in the idea that a candidate would reflect regional interests. It failed as all but two of the eight major candidates won at least one primary on that day.

Another trend is to stage earlier and earlier primaries, given impetus by Super Tuesday and the mid-1990s move (since repealed) of the California primary and its bloc of votes—the largest in the nation—from June to March. To retain its tradition as the first primary in the country (and adhere to a state law which requires it to be), New Hampshire moved their primary forward, from early March to early January.

A major reason states try to increase their influence, and vie for earlier primaries, is that in recent years the races have usually been decided before the primary season has ended in June. For example, John McCain officially clinched the 2008 Republican presidential nomination in March, while during that same month Barack Obama held a substantial lead in pledged delegates in the Democratic Party primaries. In 2012, Obama faced no major challenger in the Democratic Party primaries since he had the advantage of incumbency &quot;(see below)&quot;, while Mitt Romney gained enough delegates to be declared the &quot;presumptive&quot; Republican nominee by late April.

In 2012, both the Republicans and the Democrats moved their Florida primary to January 31, which was an earlier date than past election cycles. In response, other states also changed their primary election dates for 2012, in order to claim a greater influence, creating a cascade of changes in other states. This followed what happened in 2008 when Nevada moved its caucuses to January, causing other states to also move their primaries to earlier dates. Senate majority leader and Nevada senator Harry Reid was a major proponent of moving that state&#x27;s caucuses to January, arguing that Nevada would be the perfect American microcosm: its western location, significant minority population, and strong labor population would be more representative of the country as a whole than Iowa and New Hampshire.

Both parties then enacted stricter timing rules for 2016: primaries and caucuses cannot start until February 1; and only Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada are entitled to February contests.

==Criticism==

===Representativeness===
Because they are the states that traditionally hold their respective contests first, the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary usually attract the most media attention; however, critics, such as Mississippi secretary of state Eric Clark and Tennessee senator William Brock, point out that these states are not representative of the United States as a whole: they are more overwhelmingly white, rural, and wealthy than the national average, and neither is in the fast-growing West or South.

Conversely, states that traditionally hold their primaries in June, like California (the most populous state overall) and New Jersey (the most densely populated state), usually end up having no say in who the presidential candidate will be. As stated above, the races were usually over well before June. California and New Jersey moved their primaries to February for the 2008 election, but in 2012 both states ended up moving them back to June. California lawmakers stated that consolidating their presidential and statewide primary election in June saves them about $100 million, and that it is not worth the cost when there is generally no competitive balance between the two political parties within California.

In 2005, the primary commission of the Democratic National Committee began considering removing Iowa and New Hampshire from the top of the calendar, but this proposal never gained approval, so those two states remain as the first two contests. New Hampshire also fought back by obliging candidates who wanted to campaign in the state to pledge to uphold that primary as the first one.

===Front-loading and compression===
States vie for earlier primaries to claim greater influence in the nomination process, as the early primaries can act as a signal to the nation, showing which candidates are popular and giving those who perform well early on the advantage of the bandwagon effect. Also, candidates can ignore primaries that fall after the nomination has already been secured, and would owe less to those states politically. As a result, rather than stretching from March to July, most primaries take place in a compressed time frame in February and March. National party leaders also have an interest in compressing the primary calendar, as it enables the party to reduce the chance of a bruising internecine battle and to preserve resources for the general campaign.

In such a primary season, however, many primaries will fall on the same day, forcing candidates to choose where to spend their time and resources. Indeed, Super Tuesday was created deliberately to increase the influence of the South. When states cannot agree to coordinate primaries, however, attention flows to larger states with large numbers of delegates at the expense of smaller ones. Because the candidate&#x27;s time is limited, paid advertising may play a greater role. Moreover, a compressed calendar limits the ability of lesser-known candidates to corral resources and raise their visibility among voters, especially when a better-known candidate enjoys the financial and institutional backing of the party establishment.

In an article from &quot;Detroit News&quot;, Tennessee Senator William (Bill) Brock said about front-loading, &quot;Today, too many people in too many states have no voice in the election of our major party nominees. For them, the nominations are over before they have begun.&quot;

===Role of superdelegates===
The term &quot;superdelegate&quot; itself was used originally as a criticism of unpledged delegates. Superdelegates are only used by the Democratic Party. Political commentator Susan Estrich argued in 1981 that these delegates, who at the time were predominantly white and male, had more power than other delegates because of their greater freedom to vote as they wish. The Democratic Party in particular has faced accusations that it conducts its nominating process in an undemocratic way, because superdelegates are generally chosen without regard to their preferences in the presidential race and are not obligated to support the candidate chosen by the voters.

===Advantage of incumbency===
An incumbent president seeking re-election usually faces no opposition during their respective party&#x27;s primaries, especially if they are still popular. For presidents Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump, for example, their respective paths to nomination became uneventful and the races become merely &quot;pro forma&quot;. With the lack of serious competition, the incumbent president&#x27;s party may also cancel several state primaries/caucuses to both save money and to show undivided support for the incumbent&#x27;s candidacy. Furthermore, no incumbent president has participated in a primary debate since Gerald Ford in 1976.

Serious challenges are rare, but then generally presage failure to win the general election in the fall. During the 1976 Republican Party primaries, then-former California governor Reagan carried 23 states while running against incumbent president Gerald Ford; Ford then went on to lose the presidential election to Jimmy Carter. Senator Ted Kennedy then carried 12 states while running against Carter during the 1980 Democratic Party primaries; Reagan then defeated Carter in the fall. Pat Buchanan captured a decent percentage of a protest vote against George H.W. Bush during the 1992 Republican primaries, but only received a handful of delegates; Bush too subsequently went on to lose in the general election to Clinton.

==Reform proposals==
There are several proposals for reforming the primary system. Some have called for a single nationwide primary to be held on one day. Others point out that requiring candidates to campaign in every state simultaneously would exacerbate the purported problem of campaigns being dominated by the candidates who raise the most money. The following proposals attempt to return the primary system to a more relaxed schedule, and would help less-funded candidates by lowering the cost of entry.

===California Plan (American Plan)===
One reform concept is the graduated random presidential primary system, variations of which have been referred to as the American Plan or the California Plan. This plan starts with small primaries, and gradually moves up to larger ones, in 10 steps, with states chosen at random. The idea is that fewer initial primaries, typically in smaller states, would allow grassroots campaigns to score early successes and pick up steam. However, since states are chosen at random, travel costs may still be significant.

===Delaware Plan (Fourfold Round Plan)===
A commission empaneled by the Republican National Committee recommended the Delaware Plan in 2000. This plan had states grouped by size into four groups, with the smallest primaries first, then the next-smallest, and so on. Populous states objected to the plan, however, because it would have always scheduled their primaries at the end of the season. Other criticisms included the wide geographic range of the states, necessitating high travel costs. The Delaware Plan was put to vote at Republican National Convention of 2000 and rejected.

===Rotating regional primary system===
The National Association of Secretaries of State has endorsed a rotating regional primary system, with the country split into four regions: the West, the Midwest, the South, and the Northeast. Unlike the Delaware Plan and the American Plan, the Rotating Regional Primary System would lower campaigning costs by restricting groups of primaries to single, contiguous regions.

Author and political scientist Larry J. Sabato is also a proponent of this plan, but his proposal would have the order of regional primaries determined by lottery on January 1 of each presidential election year instead of on a rotating basis. In addition, his plan would allow for a few small population states, such as Iowa and New Hampshire, to hold their primaries in advance of the first region.

Criticisms of the regional plan include the higher entry costs than the other plans (since 1/4 of the country would vote in the first regional), and the political bias of certain regions (the South or the Northeast) unduly influencing the selection of a nominee.

===Inter regional primary plan===
In the interregional primary plan, the country is divided into geographical regions. On each primary date from March to June, one state from each of six regions votes. Each election date would contain a wide variety of perspectives. The order of the states in each region is set by a lottery. In a 24-year cycle, every state would have a chance to be among the first primary states. The primary criticism of this plan is that travel costs would be quite high: in each round, candidates would essentially have to cover the entire country to campaign effectively. Contrary to most reform plans, this would reduce the ability of lesser-funded candidates to build up from small contests to large ones.
===Timing adjustment===
In the 2008 Republican primary, states that ran early primaries were punished by a reduction of 50% in the number of delegates they could send to the national convention. Extension of this idea would set timing tiers, under which states that ran earlier primaries would send proportionally fewer delegates to the national convention, and states that waited would get a higher proportional number of delegates to the convention. For example, the party allowed primaries before March 1 to send 40% of delegates; those during March could send 60%; those during April could send 80%; those during May could send 100%; and those during June could send 120%.

The effect of such a plan would be clumping of primaries at the beginning of each month. It would still allow states to determine the timing of their own primaries, while giving them some incentive to hold primaries later. The disadvantage of the timing adjustment method is that it does not reduce travel time as the regional plans do, although it does permit regional groups of states to voluntarily clump together in a single superprimary as they have done in the past.

In practice, however, this timing tier system did not prevent states from moving their primaries in 2008 and 2012. For example, during the 2012 Republican primary, Florida and several other states still moved their primaries to earlier dates despite being penalized delegates.

Both parties then enacted more severe penalties in 2016 for violating their timing rules. For Republicans, states with more than 30 delegates that violate the timing rules will be deprived of all their delegates but nine; states with less than 30 will be reduced to six. For Democrats, states violating these rules will be penalized half of their pledged delegates and all of their unpledged delegates.

<doc id="185313" wikidata="Q520867" url="?curid=185313" title="Freeganism">
<text>Freeganism is an ideology of limited participation in the conventional economy and minimal consumption of resources, particularly through recovering wasted goods like food. The word &quot;freegan&quot; is a portmanteau of &quot;free&quot; and &quot;vegan&quot;. While vegans avoid buying, consuming, using, and wearing animal products as an act of protest against animal exploitation, freegans—at least in theory—avoid buying &quot;anything&quot; as an act of protest against the food system in general.

Freeganism is often presented as synonymous with &quot;dumpster diving&quot; for discarded food, although freegans are distinguished by their association with an anti-consumerist and anti-capitalist ideology and their engagement in a wider range of alternative living strategies, such as voluntary unemployment, squatting in abandoned buildings, and &quot;guerrilla gardening&quot; in unoccupied city parks.
== History ==

Freegans&#x27; goal of reduced participation in capitalism and tactics of recovering wasted goods shares elements with the Diggers, an anarchist street theater group based in Haight-Ashbury in San Francisco in the 1960s that organized free housing and clinics and gave away rescued food. The word &quot;freegan&quot; itself was allegedly invented in 1994 by Keith McHenry, the co-founder of Food Not Bombs—an anarchist group that distributes free vegetarian meals as a protest against militarism and as a way of providing &quot;solidarity not charity&quot;—to refer to non-vegans who never pay for animal products. McHenry&#x27;s account is consistent with other published accounts of freeganism that show the word as beginning to be used in the mid-1990s by participants in the antiglobalization and radical environmental movements.

 The pamphlet &quot;Why Freegan?&quot;—written by former Against Me! drummer Warren Oakes in Gainesville, Florida, in 1999—defines freeganism as &quot;an anti-consumeristic ethic about eating&quot; and goes on to describe practices including dumpster diving, plate scraping, wild foraging, gardening, theft, employee scams, and barter as alternatives to paying for food. The pamphlet also expanded the activities associated with &quot;freeganism&quot; with a long section on non-alimentary practices, including conserving water, pre-cycling, reusing goods, and using solar energy. More than just a set of behaviors, though, the pamphlet presents freeganism as having an overarching political goal: an &quot;ultimate boycott&quot; of &quot;all the corporations, all the stores, all the pesticides, all the land and resources wasted, the capitalist system, the all-oppressive dollar, the wage slavery, the whole burrito&quot; in favor of &quot;liv[ing] a full satisfying life...while treading lightly on the earth&quot;.

The first organized group of self-described &quot;freegans&quot; formed in 2003 as an offshoot of the Wetlands Preserve nightclub and associated Activism Center in New York City. According to the group freegan.info, &quot;After years of trying to boycott products from unethical corporations responsible for human rights violations, environmental destruction, and animal abuse, many of us found that no matter what we bought we ended up supporting something deplorable. We came to realize that the problem isn&#x27;t just a few bad corporations but the entire system itself.&quot; From 2005, freegan.info organized regular events including sewing and bicycle workshops, wild food foraging expeditions, and &quot;trash tours&quot;—public dumpster dives open to the public and to media. 

== Motivations and ideology ==
Studies usually find that most people who participate in practices associated with freeganism, such as dumpster diving for food, do so for economic reasons. Freegans are usually distinguished as being a subset of this population which has an ideological or political motivation for recovering waste or avoiding consumption, although some freegans also say that they do so for amusement, to acquire free goods, or out of religious conviction. Anthropologist Loretta Lou has demonstrated how freeganism is closely related to notions of freedom, especially &quot;ethical freedom&quot;, among some freegan practitioners in Asia. 

=== Anarchism and anti-capitalism ===
Freeganism&#x27;s initial practitioners and forerunners like Food Not Bombs were explicitly anti-capitalist, arguing that capitalism is responsible for excessive consumption, the abuse of human laborers and non-human animals, and the waste of resources. Freegans&#x27; approach to anti-capitalism is broadly anarchist in orientation: rather than seeking to seize state power, freegans claim to be engaged in &quot;prefigurative politics&quot;, using wasted resources to build a new society &quot;in the shell of the old&quot; based on values of &quot;community, generosity, social concern, freedom, cooperation, and sharing&quot;. Freegan practices in theory reject the commoditization of basic necessities, the imperative of economic growth, and an economy based on money exchange rather than free gifting or sharing. Freegan organizations also often use consensus-based decision-making, popularized by the anti-globalization movement and later visible in anarchist-inspired mobilizations like Occupy Wall Street.

=== Veganism and food waste ===
The word &quot;freegan&quot; originated as a play on the label &quot;veganism&quot; and research on freegan.info in New York found that most participants were vegetarian or vegan prior to becoming freegan. In many cases, though, freegans &quot;critique&quot; vegans by arguing that vegans ignore the environmental and labor impacts of the products they buy and corporate ownership of many vegan product lines.

Freegans&#x27; rejection of veganism is often tied to their discovery of food waste, estimated as up to 40% of the food supply in the United States and other Western countries. For many, statistics about the ecological impacts of food waste—up to 12% of global cropland and 23% of global freshwater goes to produce food which is never consumed—serve as justification for a complete rejection of the capitalist food system. Moreover, the presence of food in supermarket dumpsters shows, according to some freegans, that the vegan theory of social change is flawed, because markets do &quot;not&quot; efficiently translate consumer preferences into changes in production.

=== Back-to-nature ===
Some freegans associate themselves with &quot;back-to-the-landers&quot; or &quot;anarcho-primitivism&quot;, the latter of which asserts that human beings should reject not only capitalism but civilization itself. With some exceptions, though, freeganism is a largely urban or suburban phenomenon. Some research suggests that freegans overcome this apparent contradiction by attempting to re-naturalize the city, treating urban waste as a &quot;natural&quot; resource and approach dumpster diving as a practice analogous to hunting or gathering.

==Practices==

===Urban foraging===
Freegans are best known for recovering discarded food from commercial establishments, a practice known as &quot;dumpster diving&quot; or &quot;urban foraging&quot; in North America, &quot;skipping&quot;, &quot;bin raiding&quot;, or &quot;skipitarianism&quot; in the UK, &quot;skip dipping&quot; in Australia, &quot;containern&quot; in Germany, or &quot;doing the duck&quot; in New Zealand. Freegan diets are thus made possible by the range of practices that produce commercial food waste that is nonetheless still edible, such as conservative sell-by dates, the deliberate overstocking of certain perishable products (like baked goods), or aesthetic criteria for fruits and vegetables. However, dumpster diving is not limited to rummaging for food; freegans report recovering clothing, books, appliances, bicycles, and furniture from commercial dumpsters as well.

Although some freegans are reluctant to share their sites and strategies for &quot;urban foraging&quot;, others—like those in freegan.info—have organized public events to raise awareness of food waste and recruit other practitioners. These events attracted significant media coverage, particularly between 2005 and 2009, from outlets such as &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Oprah, and MSNBC.

===Wild foraging and urban gardens===

Instead of buying conventionally grown foods, wild foragers find and harvest food and medicinal plants growing in their own communities. Some freegans participate in &quot;guerrilla&quot; or &quot;community&quot; gardens, with the stated aim of rebuilding community and reclaiming the capacity to grow one&#x27;s own food. In order to fertilize those guerrilla gardens, food obtained from dumpster diving is sometimes also reused, and some use vermiculture instead of ordinary composting techniques in order to keep the required infrastructure small and adapted to urban areas. Some rural freegans are also &quot;homesteaders&quot; who grow their own food and employ alternative energy sources to provide energy for their homesteads, occasionally living &quot;off the grid&quot; entirely.

===Sharing===
&quot;Sharing&quot; is also presented as a common freegan practice, associated with the anarchist idea of a &quot;gift economy&quot;. For example, Food Not Bombs recovers food that would otherwise go to waste to serve warm meals on the street to anyone who wants them. Really, Really Free Markets are free social events in which freegans can share goods instead of discarding them, share skills, give presents and eat food. A free store is a temporary market where people exchange goods and services outside of a money-based economy. In New York City, freegan.info often distributes recovered food items for free in an ad-hoc manner after trash tours.

Freegans also advocate sharing travel resources. Carpools and hitchhiking reduce, but do not eliminate, use of cars. Community bicycle programs and collectives facilitate community sharing of bicycles, restore found and broken bikes, and teach people how to do their own bicycle repairs. In the process, they aim to build a culture of skill and resource sharing, reuse wasted bikes and bike parts, and create greater access to green transport.

===Squatting===
Just as freegans argue food waste should be recovered and redistributed, many argue that unoccupied buildings are a form of &quot;waste&quot; to be reclaimed. Squatting was widespread in Western Europe as well as parts of the United States in the 1980s and 1990s, and activists used squatted buildings not only for housing but also to create community centers, pirate radio stations, or free schools. A widespread crackdown by municipalities closed many squats and legalized the remainder in the 1990s—the moment when freeganism was emerging—and so it is thus difficult to know how many people are involved in this activity. While research with freegans consistently shows that they &quot;endorse&quot; squatting, in practice, freegan living situations vary, ranging from trading work for rent to traditional home ownership.

===Working less===

Working less is another component of freeganism. Freegans oppose the notion of working for the sole purpose of accumulating material items. They argue that their need to work is reduced by only purchasing the basic necessities and acquiring the remainder for free from the garbage. According to freegans, not working frees up additional time for political action while avoiding tasks they see as sacrificing valuable time to &quot;take orders from someone else, stress, boredom, monotony, and in many cases risks to physical and psychological well-being&quot;. As with squatting, however, the degree of concordance between freegan ideology and practices is variable. In surveys, self-described freegans vary from reporting working only irregularly, working consistently in social justice organizations, and being employed in more conventional, &quot;capitalist&quot; occupations.

== Responses and criticism ==

=== Sanitation and stigma ===
Contact with waste is seen as a taboo and socially unacceptable in most developed countries, and freegans are often associated with stigmatized and racialized groups like the homeless or even compared to scavenging &quot;pest&quot; animals like raccoons. Some public health officials, like those in New York City, have explicitly discouraged dumpster diving for sanitation reasons and media coverage occasionally focuses on the &quot;ick&quot; factor of dumpster diving while (explicitly or implicitly) ignoring its political content. This discourse has been deployed more broadly to discredit anarchist movements by claiming they are unhygienic and thus dangerous. While some freegans argue that dumpster dived food is safe—noting it is usually thrown out because it cannot be profitably sold, not because it is no longer edible—others embrace the &quot;dirtiness&quot; of recovered food as a symbolic rejection of capitalist norms. The group freegan.info has made the disgust attached to wasted food part of its messaging, arguing that social disapprobation should instead fall on those who throw out food, rather than those who recover it.

=== Parasitism ===
Freeganism has also been critiqued both by other radical movements and by mainstream commentators for the fact that its signature practice—dumpster diving—depends on the capitalist food system that freegans claim to be rejecting. A typical response is that freegan practices are not limited to dumpster diving, but include also actions like guerilla gardening, wild food foraging, or sewing or bike repair &quot;skill shares&quot; that are more fully autonomous from the conventional economy.

=== Racial and class composition ===
Although activities like dumpster diving or gleaning are traditionally seen as subsistence strategies for the poor, most research on freegans finds that individuals come from middle-class and upper-class backgrounds and have high levels of education (even if their present lifestyles make them low-income). Freeganism has also been described as racially exclusive, because freeganism&#x27;s voluntary association of waste would seem to confirm a &quot;globally ubiquitous racial construction&quot; that people of color are dirty and polluted. As one freegan of color wrote, &quot;I am extremely embarrassed for people to see me diving, because I can tell that I&#x27;m not just me, I&#x27;m also a representation of black people in general...I got harassed by security several times while diving on my own campus, until my white friends pop their heads out of the dumpsters.&quot; In contrast, the portrait of the gender balance of freeganism is more mixed, with some accounts saying groups are majority men and others majority women.

=== Legality and commercial responses ===

The legality of freegan practices of reclaiming wasted food, space, or buildings varies depending on local laws around property, trespassing, and waste removal. In some places, like New York City, freegans dumpster dive publicly; in other locations, urban foraging is a secretive activity. In recent years, there have been arrests of people dumpster diving for political reasons in the United Kingdom, Belgium, and France, although in most locations charges have eventually been dropped. These actions could be seen as part of a broader criminalization of acts of survival—like sleeping in public places, sharing food without a permit, or recovering aluminum cans to re-sell—that has affected freegans as well as affiliated groups like Food Not Bombs and the homeless. Freegans report that stores have responded to waste recovery as well, including deliberately destroying products prior to disposing of them, locking dumpsters, or pouring bleach on food to make it inedible. In France, a new national law bans the practice of destroying food in this way.

== Impacts ==
Media coverage of freeganism in the United States peaked around the financial crisis in 2007-2009 and dropped off subsequently. More recently, freeganism has been discussed in the context of increasing public interest in food waste. Tristram Stuart, a prominent food waste campaigner and founder of the organization &quot;Feedback&quot; claims that media attention to freeganism was crucial in attracting attention to the problem. Other analyses of the origins of contemporary public policy initiatives around food waste have also concluded that freeganism contributed to new initiatives, like the French law on food waste or the U.S. food waste reduction challenge.

== In popular culture ==
The 2013 film The East was based on Freeganism and related practices such as Anarchist Communalism. Director Zal Batmanglij and star Brit Marling co-wrote the film and the script was largely based on their experiences practicing Freeganism in the summer of 2009.

<text>&quot;Brown Bess&quot; is a nickname of uncertain origin for the British Army&#x27;s muzzle-loading smoothbore flintlock Land Pattern Musket and its derivatives. The musket design remained in use for over a hundred years with many incremental changes in its design. These versions include the Long Land Pattern, the Short Land Pattern, the India Pattern, the New Land Pattern Musket, and the Sea Service Musket.

The Long Land Pattern musket and its derivatives, all 0.75 inches calibre flintlock muskets, were the standard long guns of the British Empire&#x27;s land forces from 1722 until 1838, when they were superseded by a percussion cap smoothbore musket. The British Ordnance System converted many flintlocks into the new percussion system known as the Pattern 1839 Musket. A fire in 1841 at the Tower of London destroyed many muskets before they could be converted. Still, the Brown Bess saw service until the middle of the nineteenth century.

Most male citizens of the thirteen colonies of British America were required by law to own arms and ammunition for militia duty. The Long Land Pattern was a common firearm in use by both sides in the American War of Independence.

In 1808 during the Napoleonic Wars, the United Kingdom subsidised Sweden (during the period when Finland was under Swedish rule) in various ways as the British government anxiously wanted to keep an ally in the Baltic Sea region. These included deliveries of significant numbers of Brown Bess-muskets for use in the Finnish War of 1808 to 1809.

During the Musket Wars (1820s–30s), Māori warriors used Brown Besses purchased from European traders at the time. Some muskets were sold to the Mexican Army, which used them during the Texas Revolution of 1836 and the Mexican–American War of 1846 to 1848. Brown Besses saw service in the First Opium War and during the Indian rebellion of 1857. Zulu warriors, who had also purchased them from European traders, used them during the Anglo-Zulu War in 1879. One was even used in the Battle of Shiloh in 1862, during the American Civil War.

==Origins of the name==

One hypothesis is that the &quot;Brown Bess&quot; was named after Elizabeth I of England, but this lacks support. Jonathan Ferguson, Keeper of Firearms and Artillery at the Royal Armouries, traces the name to at least the 1760s, and his research suggests the name was adopted from slang for a mistress, prostitute, or lowly woman who also appear in period sources referred to as &quot;Brown Bess&quot;. He writes, Bess&#x27; was a generic and sometimes derogatory name, a bit like &#x27;Sheila&#x27; in modern Australian English&quot;, and &quot;brown&quot; simply meant plain or drab. Ferguson discounts, with evidence, many of the other theories previously popular.

Early uses of the term include the newspaper, the &quot;Connecticut Courant&quot; in April 1771, which said: &quot;... but if you are afraid of the sea, take Brown Bess on your shoulder and march.&quot; This familiar use indicates widespread use of the term by that time. The 1785 &quot;Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue&quot;, a contemporary work that defined vernacular and slang terms, contained this entry: &quot;Brown Bess: A soldier&#x27;s firelock. To hug Brown Bess; to carry a fire-lock, or serve as a private soldier.&quot; Military and government records of the time do not use this poetical name but refer to &quot;firelocks&quot;, &quot;flintlock&quot;, &quot;muskets&quot; or by the weapon&#x27;s model designations.

Popular explanations of the use of the word &quot;Brown&quot; include that it was a reference to either the colour of the walnut stocks, or to the characteristic brown colour that was produced by russeting, an early form of metal treatment. However, in the case of russeting at least, the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and Ferguson note that &quot;browning&quot; was only introduced in the early 19th century, well after the term had come into general use. Others argue that mass-produced weapons of the time were coated in brown varnish on metal parts as a rust-preventive and on wood as a sealer (or in the case of unscrupulous contractors, to disguise inferior or non-regulation types of wood), an entirely different thing from russeting.

Similarly, the word &quot;Bess&quot; is commonly held to either derive from the word &quot;arquebus&quot; or &quot;blunderbuss&quot; (predecessors of the musket) or to be a reference to Elizabeth I, possibly given to commemorate her death. The OED has citations for &quot;brown musket&quot; dating back to the early 18th century that refer to the same weapon. Another suggestion is that the name is simply the counterpart to the earlier Brown Bill. However, the origin of the name may be much simpler, if vulgar.

Kipling may have based his poem on an earlier but similar &quot;Brown Bess&quot; poem published in &quot;Flights of Fancy&quot; (No. 16) in 1792. Of course, the name could have been initially inspired by the older term of the &quot;Brown Bill&quot; and perhaps the barrels were originally varnished brown, but it is well known in literary circles that the name &quot;Brown Bess&quot; during the period in question in the 17th to early 19th centuries is not a reference to a colour or a weapon but to simply refer to a wanton prostitute (or harlot). Such a nickname would have been a delight to the soldiers of the era who were from the lower classes of English and then British society. So far, the earliest use noted of the term &quot;Brown Bess&quot; was in a 1631 publication, John Done&#x27;s &quot;Polydoron: or A Mescellania of Morall, Philosophicall, and Theological Sentences&quot;, page 152:

==The Land Pattern muskets==
From the seventeenth century to the early years of the eighteenth century, most nations did not specify standards for military firearms. Firearms were individually procured by officers or regiments as late as 1745, and were often custom-made to the tastes of the purchaser. As the firearm gained ascendancy on the battlefield, this lack of standardisation led to increasing difficulties in the supply of ammunition and repair materials. To address these difficulties, armies began to adopt standardised &quot;patterns&quot;. A military service selected a &quot;pattern musket&quot; to be stored in a &quot;pattern room&quot;. There it served as a reference for arms makers, who could make comparisons and take measurements to ensure that their products matched the standard.

Stress-bearing parts of the Brown Bess, such as the barrel, lockwork, and sling-swivels, were customarily made of iron, while other furniture pieces such as the butt plate, trigger guard and ramrod pipe were found in both iron and brass. It weighed around and it could be fitted with a triangular cross-section bayonet. The weapon had a single fore-sight, but no rear sights. this doubled as a bayonet lock. This is often mistakenly referred to as a &quot;bayonet lug&quot; but this is a modern nomenclature - contemporary sources refer to this as a &quot;sight&quot; and cite its positioning to be intentional for aiming.

The earliest models had iron fittings, but these were replaced by brass in models built after 1736. Wooden ramrods were used with the first guns but were replaced by iron ones, although guns with wooden scouring sticks were still issued to troops on American service until 1765 and later to loyalist units in the American Revolution. Wooden ramrods, also called scouring sticks, were also used in the Dragoon version produced from 1744 to 1771 for Navy and Marine use.

The accuracy of the Brown Bess was fair, as with most other muskets. In 1811, in London, a test shooting was conducted at the site. The target was a wooden shield the size of an infantry or a cavalry line. The results of the practice were as follows: at a distance of 53% hits, 30% hits, 23% hits. The accuracy of the Brown Bess was in line with most other smoothbore muskets of the 18th to 19th centuries. But it should be borne in mind that this is the result of shooting by ordinary soldiers who had little training. Soldiers of light infantry had more training, and were taught accurate shooting.

The Brown Bess was used not only in the line infantry, but also light infantry, as well as Rogers&#x27; Rangers, hunters, skirmishers, Indians and many other irregular troops who used non-standard tactics.

According to Spearman in &quot;The British Gunner&quot;, the standard service charge for the Brown Bess was 6 drams (165 grains) of black powder, including the powder used for priming. However, Spearman also mentioned that &quot;the service charges given in [the] table, although established by authority, [were] too great, and [could] be reduced by about one-fourth&quot; due to advances in black powder quality. Analysis of two paper cartridges from the American Revolutionary War found that they contained approximately 115 grains of powder, which was consistent with Spearman&#x27;s observations that the standard service charge could be reduced by one-fourth.

Modern ballistic testing with electronic ignition demonstrated that a muzzle velocity of 1800 fps was possible, with a corresponding muzzle energy of approximately 4000 J. 

However, when loaded with 100 to 110 grains of modern black powder and fired manually, the Brown Bess typically only reached a muzzle velocity of 1000 fps with approximately 1600 J of muzzle energy. 

Roberts et al. summarized historical data which suggested that muzzle velocities of 1500 fps were not uncommon. This would generate approximately 3000 J of muzzle energy. However, Roberts was unable to generate this velocity without exceeding the service charge established by Spearman.

According to the Russian lieutenant-general Ivan G. Gogel, all the muskets of the European nations were able to penetrate a wooden shield with a thickness of at a distance of 300 yards.

British soldiers armed with Brown Besses preferred to reduce the standard number of steps for loading a musket. To this end, they would sometimes drop the cartridge into the barrel and strike the butt on the ground, to seat the load without the use of a ramrod.

Besides not having fore-sights, Brown Bess-muskets were virtually identical to Potzdam muskets up until the Prussian 1801 pattern.

===Variations===
Many variations and modifications of the standard pattern musket were created over its long history. The earliest version was the Long Land Pattern of 1722, long (without bayonet), with a barrel. It was later found that shortening the barrel did not detract from accuracy but made handling easier, giving rise to the Militia (or Marine) Pattern of 1756 and the Short Land Pattern of 1768, which both had a barrel. Another version with a barrel was first manufactured for the British East India Company, and was eventually adopted by the British Army in 1790 as the India Pattern.

By the late 1830s and into the early 1840s the weapon was becoming obsolete and its flintlock mechanism was being replaced by the more efficient and reliable percussion cap ignition. The flintlock mechanism was prone to misfiring, especially in wet weather. The last flintlock pattern manufactured was selected for conversion to the new system as the Pattern 1839. As a fire at the Tower of London destroyed large stocks of these in 1841, a new Pattern 1842 musket was manufactured. These remained in service until the 1853 outbreak of the Crimean War, when they were replaced by the Minié and the P53 Enfield rifled musket.

<text>The Charleville musket was a .69 caliber standard French infantry musket used in the 18th and 19th centuries. It was made in 1717 and was last produced during the 1840s. However, it still saw limited use in conflicts through the mid-19th century (such as the Crimean War).

== History ==

Marin le Bourgeoys created the first true flintlock weapons for King Louis XIII shortly after his accession to the throne in 1610. Throughout the 17th century, flintlock muskets were produced in a wide variety of models.

In 1717, a flintlock musket for the French infantry was standardized. This became the first standard flintlock musket to be issued to all French troops. While it is more correctly called a French infantry musket or a French pattern musket, these muskets later became known as &quot;Charleville muskets&quot;, after the armory in Charleville-Mézières, Ardennes, France. The standard French infantry-long gun was also produced at Tulle, Saint-Étienne, Maubeuge Arsenal, and other sites. While technically not the correct name for these muskets, the use of the name Charleville dates back to the U.S. Revolutionary War, when Americans tended to refer to all of the musket models as Charlevilles. The naming of these muskets is not consistent. Some references only refer to Model 1763 and later versions as Charleville flintlock muskets, while other references refer to all models as the Charleville.
The Charleville musket&#x27;s design was refined several times during its service life. Later models of Charleville muskets remained in service until 1840, when percussion lock systems made the flintlock mechanism obsolete.

== Design features ==
Charleville muskets had a smoothbore barrel. Rifles were more accurate than smoothbore muskets, but military commanders favored smoothbores on the battlefield, since the round from a rifle had to fit tightly into the barrel and became very difficult to load after a few shots because the black powder quickly fouled the barrel. The longer range and better accuracy of the rifle were also considered to be of little value on a battlefield that was quickly obscured by black powder smoke. Like all smoothbore muskets, the Charleville flintlock musket was only accurate to about 200 yards against a column of men, or eighty to a hundred yards against a man-sized target.

The Charleville&#x27;s 0.69-inch (17.5 mm) caliber barrel was slightly smaller than its main competitor, the 0.75-inch caliber Brown Bess produced by the British. The smaller round was intentionally chosen to reduce weight in the field, but still had enough mass to be effective as a military round. The Charleville&#x27;s stock was usually made out of walnut.

Charleville muskets were not always used like modern rifles. In pitched battles formations of musketeers did not aim and fire individually, but would fire controlled volleys on command against other close packed formations. This mitigated to some extent the natural inaccuracy of the musket, as well as the general lack of marksmanship training among infantrymen of the period. However from the French Revolutionary Wars onward the French army began to use light infantry tactics on a large scale as well, and thus the Charleville was also regularly used for individually aimed fire by skirmishers operating singly from behind cover. Despite the musket&#x27;s relative lack of accuracy the French infantrymen, especially the voltigeurs and chasseurs, were often highly effective skirmishers with it.

The bayonet also played an important role in warfare during the era of flintlock muskets, unlike its reputation today as a last-ditch weapon. Given the slow reloading process of muzzle loading guns, a hedge of bayonets provided vital protection for musketeers against fast charging cavalry in the open. This low rate of fire also allowed infantry to often close into melee distance without taking too many casualties, and bayonet charges were thus frequently used to decisively rout wavering enemy formations. The Charleville thus played a dual role on the battlefield, obviously as a ranged weapon, but also as a polearm in hand-to-hand combat. This intended use as a makeshift spear dictated the Charleville&#x27;s general length and weight. A short barrel would leave its user at a disadvantage in combat due to the lack of reach, and the gun also needed to be sturdy enough to be used as a pike or a club, while remaining light enough to be easily handled by the general infantrymen.

The rate of fire depended on the skill of the soldier, which was typically about three shots per minute. The Charleville&#x27;s barrel was held into place by three barrel bands. This made the Charleville sturdier than the British Brown Bess musket, which used pins to hold the barrel in place. The butt of the Charleville&#x27;s stock was sometimes referred to as the &quot;patte de vache&quot; (French for &quot;cow&#x27;s foot&quot;), as its shape was designed to be used as a club in hand-to-hand combat.

Charleville muskets were muzzle-loaded and used a flintlock firing mechanism. They typically fired a round, lead ball but could fire other ammunition such as buck and ball or shot.

== Variants ==

=== Model 1717 ===

After numerous musket designs in the late 17th and early 18th century, most notably the Tulle Musket, the infantry musket was standardized in what would become the Model 1717. This model standardized most of the design features that would be common to all subsequent models, such as a .69 caliber barrel, an approximate length of and an approximate weight of . The Model 1717 also standardized the smoothbore barrel and flintlock firing mechanism.

Unlike later models, the Model 1717 had a pinned barrel, similar in design to the British Brown Bess. It also had a single barrel band at the center of the barrel, and four iron pipes that held a wooden scouring stick. All of the furniture was iron.

The Model 1717 had a barrel and an overall length of , and weighed approximately nine pounds. A total of 48,000 Model 1717 muskets were produced.

=== Model 1728 ===

The Model 1728 replaced the pinned barrel with a barrel held in place by three barrel bands, which would become standard on all subsequent Charleville muskets. The barrel band design was not only easier to disassemble for cleaning, but was also sturdier, which was an important consideration in bayonet combat.

The lock was also revised, with a longer &quot;steel&quot; spring and a slightly modified cock design.

Changes in the 1740s included the standardized use of a steel ramrod in 1741 and, after 1746, newly manufactured muskets had the pan/frizzen bridle removed. Other minor changes were also made throughout the Model 1728&#x27;s production life. These modified versions are generally considered to be minor variations to the Model 1728, and are not typically considered to be a separate and distinct model of musket.
A total of 375,000 Model 1728 muskets were produced.

=== Model 1763 ===
After the Seven Years&#x27; War (in North America often known as the French and Indian war), the French infantry musket was redesigned, resulting in the Model 1763.

The barrel was shortened from and the octagonal breech plug featured on earlier models was replaced with a more rounded design. The stock&#x27;s distinctive &quot;cow&#x27;s foot&quot; butt was modified with a much more straightened design. The ramrod was also given a more trumpet shaped end.

Though shorter in length, the Model 1763 was designed to be heavier and sturdier, and weighed over ten pounds.

A total of 88,000 Model 1763 muskets were produced.

=== Model 1766 ===
The Model 1763&#x27;s sturdier design proved to be a bit too heavy, so in 1766 the musket&#x27;s design was lightened. The barrel wall was thinned, the lock was shortened, the stock was slimmed, and the Model 1763&#x27;s long iron ramrod cover was replaced by a pinned spring under the breech. The trumpet shaped ramrod of the Model 1763 was also abandoned in favor of a ramrod with a lighter button shaped end.

Though usually considered to be a separate model, the Model 1766 was often referred to as a &quot;light Model 1763&quot; musket, especially in Revolutionary War invoices.

Despite being thinned down, the Model 1766 proved to be rugged and reliable.

A total of 140,000 Model 1766 muskets were produced.

=== Models 1770 to 1776 ===

Several changes were made to Charleville muskets during the 1770s. References are not consistent with respect to the naming of these models. Some consider many of them to be distinct models, while others consider them to be only variations of earlier models. Most of the modifications during this period were relatively minor.

The Model 1770 had a modified lock plate, stronger barrel bands, and a modified retaining spring. The Model 1771 moved the bayonet lug and strengthened the barrel. The Model 1770 and 1771 are often grouped together as a single model. The Model 1773 was similar to previous models, but again modified the ramrod-retaining spring. The Model 1773 is often considered to be a minor variant to the Model 1770/1771. The Model 1774 had a shorter trigger guard, and the tail of the steel was cut square. The ramrod-design was also modified in the Model 1774, giving it more of a pear shaped head. Similarly minor changes were made for the Model 1776, which is often not considered to be a separate model.

Throughout the 1770s, the stock was modified in an inconsistent fashion. Some muskets were produced with a much more pronounced comb on the stock than others, which have an almost nonexistent comb.

A total of 70,000 Model 1770 to 1776 muskets were produced.

=== Model 1777 ===
The design of the stock was again modified for the Model 1777, with a cheek rest cut into the inboard side of the butt. The Model 1777 also featured a slanted brass priming pan and bridle, and a modified trigger guard with two rear finger ridges.

The Model 1777 is often incorrectly believed to have been used in large numbers by rebel troops during the American War of Independence. While the Model 1777 was used in the American Revolutionary War, it was generally only used by French troops who served on American soil, such as those under the command of General Rochambeau. American troops were instead armed with earlier Model 1763 and 1766 muskets.

(See also Musket Model 1777).

=== Other variants ===
In 1754, the French introduced a shorter Officers version of the Charleville.

Most models were produced in shorter dragoon versions, which were generally about shorter than their infantry counterpart. The Model 1763, 1766, and 1777 were all available in a cavalry version. These are also often called carbine versions.

The Model 1777 Artillery version had a barrel and an overall length of . The furniture was mostly made of brass.

The Model 1777 Dragoon version had a 42-inch barrel and an overall length of . Most of the furniture was made of brass.

The Model 1777 Navy version was similar in length to the Dragoon version. All furniture on the navy version was made of brass.

The Russian Model 1808 Musket was based heavily on the design of the Model 1777 Charleville. This musket is often called a Tula musket since the majority were manufactured in Tula and bore its name on their locks. The Tula musket was manufactured with only minor changes until 1845, when it was replaced by a percussion lock musket.

The Dutch Model 1815 No. 1 and No. 2, as well as the Koloniaal Model 1836 and 1837 were based heavily on the design of the Model 1777 Corrigé en l&#x27;an IX.

Charleville muskets were also copied by Belgium, Austria and Prussia as the Augustin 1842 musket and Potzdam 1809 musket.

In the 1830s and 1840s, many old Charleville muskets (mostly later models) were converted from flintlocks to percussion locks. Several Dutch guns were even converted to breechloaders with the Snider breech-loading system in the 1860s.

== Use ==
Large numbers of Charleville Model 1763 and 1766 muskets were imported into the United States from France during the American War of Independence, due in large part to the influence of Marquis de Lafayette. The Charleville 1766 heavily influenced the design of the Springfield Musket of 1795.

The Model 1766 and 1777 were also used by the French during their participation in the American Revolutionary War.

The Model 1777 was used throughout the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. It remained in service, at least partially, until the mid-1840s.

Modern replica Charleville muskets are produced by several manufacturers. These are used by historical reenactors in both in the Americas and Europe.

<text>The Homeric Hymns () are a collection of thirty-three ancient Greek hymns and one epigram. The hymns praise deities of the Greek pantheon and retell mythological stories, often involving a deity&#x27;s birth, their acceptance among the gods on Mount Olympus, or the establishment of their cult. In antiquity, the hymns were generally, though not universally, attributed to the poet Homer: modern scholarship has established that most date to the seventh and sixth centuries BCE, though some are more recent and the latest, the &quot;Hymn to Ares&quot;, may have been composed as late as the fifth century CE.

The &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot; share compositional similarities with the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, also traditionally attributed to Homer. They share the same artificial literary dialect of Greek, are composed in dactylic hexameter, and make use of short, repeated phrases known as formulae. It is unclear how far writing, as opposed to oral composition, was involved in their creation. They may initially have served as preludes to the recitation of longer poems, and have been performed, at least originally, by singers accompanying themselves on a lyre or another stringed instrument. Performances of the hymns may have taken place at sympotic banquets, religious festivals and royal courts.

There are references to the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot; in Greek poetry from around 600 BCE; they appear to have been used as educational texts by the early fifth century BCE, and to have been collected into a single after the third century CE. Their influence on Greek literature and art was relatively small until the third century BCE, when they were used extensively by Alexandrian poets including Callimachus, Theocritus and Apollonius of Rhodes. They were also an influence on Roman poets, such as Lucretius, Catullus, Virgil, Horace and Ovid. In late antiquity (), they influenced both pagan and Christian literature, and their collection as a corpus probably dates to this period. They were comparatively neglected during the succeeding Byzantine period (that is, until 1453), but continued to be copied in manuscripts of Homeric poetry; all the surviving manuscripts of the hymns date to the fifteenth century. They were also read and emulated widely in fifteenth-century Italy, and indirectly influenced Sandro Botticelli&#x27;s painting &quot;The Birth of Venus&quot;.

The &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot; were first published in print by Demetrios Chalkokondyles in 1488–1489. George Chapman made the first English translation of them in 1624. Part of their text was incorporated, via a 1710 translation by William Congreve, into George Frideric Handel&#x27;s 1744 musical drama &quot;Semele.&quot; The rediscovery of the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Demeter&quot; in 1777 led to a resurgence of European interest in the hymns. In the arts, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe used the &quot;Hymn to Demeter&quot; as an inspiration for his 1778 melodrama &quot;Proserpina&quot;. Their textual criticism progressed considerably over the nineteenth century, particularly in German scholarship, though the text continued to present substantial difficulties into the twentieth. The &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot; were also influential on the English Romantic poets of the early nineteenth century, particularly Leigh Hunt, Thomas Love Peacock and Percy Bysshe Shelley. Later poets to adapt the hymns included Alfred, Lord Tennyson, and Constantine P. Cavafy. Their influence has also been traced in the works of James Joyce, the film &quot;Rear Window&quot; by Alfred Hitchcock, and the novel &quot;Coraline&quot; by Neil Gaiman. 

== Composition ==

The &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot; mostly date to the archaic period () of Greek history, though they often retell much older stories. The earliest of the hymns date to the seventh century BCE; most were probably composed between that century and the sixth century BCE, though the &quot;Hymn to Ares&quot; was composed considerably later and may date from as late as the fifth century CE. Although the individual hymns can rarely be dated with certainty, the longer poems (Hymns 2–5) are generally considered archaic in date. 

The earliest of the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot; were composed in a time period when oral poetry was common in Greek culture. It is unclear how far the hymns were composed orally, as opposed to with the use of writing, and scholars debate the degree of consistency or &quot;fixity&quot; likely to have existed between early versions of the hymns in performance. The debate is clouded by the impossibility of determining for certain whether a poem with characteristic features of oral poetry was in fact composed orally, or composed using writing but in imitation of an oral-poetic style. Modern scholarship tends to avoid a sharp distinction between oral and written composition, seeing the poems as traditional texts originating in a strongly oral culture.

The name &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot; derives from the attribution, in antiquity, of the hymns to Homer, then believed to be the poet of the &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;. The &quot;Hymn to Apollo&quot; was attributed to Homer by Pindar and Thucydides, who wrote around the beginning and the end of the fifth century BCE respectively. This attribution may have reflected the high esteem in which the hymns were held, as well as their stylistic similarities with the Homeric poems. The dialect of the hymns, an artificial literary language () derived largely from the Aeolic and Ionic dialects of Greek, is similar to that used in the &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;. Like the &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;, the hymns are composed in the rhythmic form known as dactylic hexameter and make use of formulae: short, set phrases with particular metrical characteristics that could be repeated as a compositional aid. 

The attribution to Homer was sometimes questioned in antiquity, such as by the rhetorician Athenaeus, who expressed his doubts about it around 200 CE. Other hypotheses in ancient times included the belief that the &quot;Hymn to Apollo&quot; was the work of Kynaithos of Chios, one of the Homeridae, a circle of poets claiming descent from Homer. Some ancient biographies of Homer denied his authorship of the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot;, and the hymns&#x27; comparative absence, relative to the &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;, from the work of scholars based in Hellenistic (323–30 BCE) Alexandria may suggest that they were no longer considered to be his work by this period. However, few direct statements denying Homer&#x27;s authorship of the hymns survive from antiquity: in the second century CE, the Greek geographer Pausanias maintained their attribution to Homer. 

Irene de Jong has contrasted the narrative focus of the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot; with that of the Homeric epics, writing that the gods are the primary focus of the hymns, with mortals serving primarily to witness the gods&#x27; actions, whereas the epics focus primarily on their mortal characters and use the gods to support the portrayal of human affairs. The poems also make use of different narrative styles: the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot; are unlike the Homeric epics in that they employ iterative narration (accounts of events which repeatedly or habitually occur), which is relatively rare in ancient Greek literature, within passages of singulative narration (accounts of specific events related in sequence). has also suggested that the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot; generally place greater focus on single events than the Homeric epics, and cover a shorter span of time, resulting in what he calls a comparatively &quot;slow&quot; narration.

== Content and performance ==

The hymns vary considerably in length, between 3 and 580 surviving lines. They are generally considered to have originally functioned as preludes () to recitations of longer works, such as epic poems. Many of the hymns end with a verse indicating that another song will follow, sometimes specifically a work of heroic epic. Over time, however, at least some may have lengthened and been recited independently of other works. The hymns which currently survive as shorter works may equally be abridgements of longer works, retaining the introduction and conclusion of a poem whose central narrative has been lost. 

The first known sources referring to the poems as &quot;hymns&quot; () date from the first century BCE. In concept, an ancient hymn was an invocation of a deity, often connected with a specific cult or sanctuary associated with that deity. The hymns often cover the deity&#x27;s birth, arrival on Olympus, and dealings with human beings. Several discuss the origins of the god&#x27;s cult or the founding of a major sanctuary dedicated to them. Some are aetiological accounts of religious cults, specific rituals, aspects of a deity&#x27;s iconography and responsibilities, or of aspects of human technology and culture. The hymns have been considered as , or gifts offered to deities on behalf of a community or social group. In this capacity, Claude Calame has referred to them as &quot;contracts&quot;, by which the praise of the deity in the hymn invites reciprocity from that deity in the form of favour or protection for the singer or their community.

Little is known about the musical settings of the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot;. The earliest surviving ancient Greek musical compositions date to the end of the fifth century BCE, after the composition of nearly all of the hymns. Originally, the hymns appear to have been performed by singers accompanying themselves on a stringed instrument, such as a lyre; later, they may have been recited, rather than sung, by an orator holding a staff. The &quot;Hymn to Apollo&quot; makes reference to a chorus of maidens on the island of Delos, the Deliades, who sang hymns to Apollo, Leto and Artemis. References to instruments of the lyre family (known interchangeably as ) occur throughout the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot; and other archaic texts, such as the &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;. These lyres generally had four strings in the early period of the hymns&#x27; composition, though seven-stringed versions became more common during the seventh century BCE. A paean, probably written in 138 BCE, mentions the accompaniment of hymnic singing with a kithara (a seven-stringed instrument of the lyre family), and contrasts this style of music with that of the aulos, a reeded wind instrument. It is unlikely that early Greek music was written down; instead, compositions were transmitted aurally and passed on through tradition. Until the fourth century BCE, few compositions appear to have been intended for repeat performance or long-term transmission.

The &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot; may have been composed to be recited at religious festivals, perhaps at singing contests: several directly or indirectly ask the god&#x27;s support in competition. Some allude to the deity&#x27;s cult at a specific place and may have been composed for performance within that cult, though the latter did not necessarily follow from the former. They seem likely to have been performed frequently in various contexts throughout antiquity, such as at banquets or symposia. It has been suggested that the fifth hymn, to Aphrodite, could have been composed for performance at a royal or aristocratic court, perhaps of a family in the Troad claiming descent from Aphrodite via her son Aeneas. The hymns&#x27; narrative voice has been described by Marco Fantuzzi and Richard Hunter as &quot;communal&quot;, usually making only generalised reference to their place of composition or the identity of the speaker. This made the hymns suitable for recitation by different speakers and for different audiences. Jenny Strauss Clay has suggested that the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot; played a role in the establishment of a panhellenic conception of the Olympian pantheon, with Zeus as its head, and therefore in promoting the cultural unity of Greeks from different polities.

== Reception ==

=== Antiquity ===

The &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot; are quoted comparatively rarely in ancient literature. There are sporadic references to them in early Greek lyric poetry, such as the works of Pindar and Sappho. The lyric poet Alcaeus composed hymns around 600 BCE to Dionysus and to the Dioscuri, which were influenced by the equivalent Homeric hymns, as possibly was Alcaeus&#x27;s hymn to Hermes. The &quot;Homeric Hymn to Hermes&quot; also inspired the &quot;Ichneutae&quot;, a satyr play composed in the fifth century BCE by the Athenian playwright Sophocles. Few definite references to the hymns can be dated to the fourth century BCE, though the &quot;Thebaid&quot; of Antimachus may contain allusions to the hymns to Aphrodite, Dionysus and Hermes. A few fifth-century painted vases show myths depicted in the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot; and may have been inspired by the poems, but it is difficult to be certain whether the correspondences reflect direct contact with the hymns or simply the commonplace nature of their underlying mythic narratives.

The hymns do not appear to have been studied by the Hellenistic scholiasts of Alexandria, though they were used and adapted by Alexandrian poets, particularly of the third century BCE. Eratosthenes, the chief librarian at Alexandria, adapted the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Hermes&quot; for his own &quot;Hermes&quot;, an account of the god&#x27;s birth and invention of the lyre. , a didactic poem about the heavens by Aratus, drew on the same poem. Callimachus drew on the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot; for his own hymns, and is the earliest-known poet to use them as inspiration for multiple works. The hymns were also used by Theocritus, Callimachus&#x27;s approximate contemporary, in his &quot;Idylls&quot; 17, 22 and 24, and by the similarly contemporary Apollonius of Rhodes in his &quot;Argonautica&quot;. The mythographer Apollodorus, who wrote in the second century BCE, may have had access to a collection of the hymns and considered them Homeric in origin. The first century BCE historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus also quoted from the hymns and referred to them as &quot;Homeric&quot;. Diodorus Siculus, another historian writing in the first century BCE, quoted verses of the first &quot;Hymn to Dionysus&quot;. 

The Greek philosopher Philodemus, who moved to Italy between around 80 and 70 BCE and died around 40 to 35 BCE, has been suggested as a possible originator for the movement of manuscripts of the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot; into the Roman world, and consequently for their reception into Latin literature. His own works quoted from the hymns to Demeter and Apollo. In Roman poetry, the opening of Lucretius&#x27;s , written around the mid 50s BCE, has correspondences with the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite,&quot; while Catullus emulated the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot; in his epyllion on the wedding of Peleus and Thetis. Virgil drew upon the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot; in his &quot;Aeneid&quot;, composed between 29 and 19 BCE. The encounter in Book 1 of the &quot;Aeneid&quot; between Aeneas and his mother Venus references the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite&quot;, in which Venus&#x27;s Greek counterpart seduces Aeneas&#x27;s father, Anchises. Later in the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, the account of the theft of Hercules&#x27;s cattle by the monster Cacus is based upon that of the theft of Apollo&#x27;s cattle by Hermes in the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Hermes&quot;.

The Roman poet Ovid made extensive use of the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot;: his account of Apollo and Daphne in the &quot;Metamorphoses,&quot; published in 8 CE, references the &quot;Hymn to Apollo&quot;, while other parts of the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; make reference to the &quot;Hymn to Demeter&quot;, the &quot;Hymn to Aphrodite&quot; and the second &quot;Hymn to Dionysus&quot;. Ovid&#x27;s account of the abduction of Persephone in his &quot;Fasti&quot;, written and revised between 2 and around 14 CE, likewise references the &quot;Hymn to Demeter&quot;. Ovid further makes use of the &quot;Hymn to Aphrodite&quot; in &quot;Heroides&quot; 16, in which Paris adapts a section of the hymn to convince Helen of his worthiness for her. The &quot;Odes&quot; of Ovid&#x27;s contemporary Horace also make use of the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot;, particularly the five longer poems. In the second century CE, the Greek-speaking authors Lucian and Aelius Aristides drew on the hymns: Aristides used them in his orations, while Lucian parodied them in his satirical &quot;Dialogues of the Gods&quot;.

=== Late antiquity to Renaissance ===
In late antiquity (that is, from around the third to the sixth centuries CE), the direct influence of the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot; was comparatively limited until the fifth century. The &quot;Hymn to Hermes&quot; was a partial exception, as it was frequently taught in schools. It is possibly alluded to in an anonymous third-century poem praising a gymnasiarch named Theon, preserved by a papyrus fragment found at Oxyrhynchus in Egypt and probably written by a student for a local festival. It also influenced the &quot;Strasbourg Cosmogony&quot;, a poem composed around 350 CE (possibly by the poet and local politician Andronicus) in commemoration of the mythical origins of the Egyptian city of Hermopolis Magna. The &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot; did influence the fourth-century Christian poem &quot;The Vision of Dorotheus&quot; and a third-century hymn to Jesus transmitted among the &quot;Sibylline Oracles&quot;. They may also have been a model, alongside the hymns of Callimachus, for the fourth-century Christian hymns known as the , written by Gregory of Nazianzus. In the fifth century, the Greek-speaking poet Nonnus quoted and adapted the hymns; from that time onwards, other poets, such as Musaeus Grammaticus and Coluthus, made use of them.

Although the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot; were known and transmitted in the Byzantine period, they were only rarely referenced, and never quoted, in Byzantine literature. The sixth-century poet Paul Silentiarius celebrated the restoration of Hagia Sophia by the emperor Justinian I in a poem which borrowed from the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Hermes&quot;. Later authors, such as the eleventh-century Michael Psellos, may have drawn upon them, but it is often unclear whether their allusions are drawn directly from the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot; or from other works narrating the same myths. The hymns have also been cited as an inspiration for the twelfth-century poetry of Theodore Prodromos.
The &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot; were copied and adapted widely in fifteenth-century Italy, for example by the poets Michael Marullus and Francesco Filelfo. Marsilio Ficino made a translation of them around 1462; Giovanni Tortelli used them for examples in his 1478 grammatical treatise . The (&#x27;Stanzas for the Joust&#x27;), written in the 1470s by Angelo Poliziano, paraphrase the second &quot;Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite&quot;, and were in turn an inspiration for Sandro Botticelli&#x27;s &quot;The Birth of Venus&quot;, painted in the 1480s.

=== Early modern period onwards ===

Georgius Dartona made the first translation of the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot; into Latin, which was published in Paris by in 1538. Around 1570, the French humanist Jean Daurat gave lectures in which he advanced an allegorical reading of the opening of the first &quot;Hymn to Aphrodite&quot;. The first English translation of the hymns was made by George Chapman in 1624, as part of his complete translation of Homer&#x27;s works. Although they received relatively little attention in English poetry in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the playwright and poet William Congreve published a version of the first &quot;Hymn to Aphrodite&quot;, written in heroic couplets, in 1710. Congreve also wrote an operatic libretto, &quot;Semele&quot;, set to music by John Eccles in 1707 but never performed. Congreve published the libretto in 1710; in 1744, George Frideric Handel released a version of the opera with his own music and alterations to the libretto made by an unknown collaborator, including a newly-added passage quoting Congreve&#x27;s translation of the &quot;Hymn to Aphrodite&quot;. The rediscovery of the &quot;Hymn to Demeter&quot; in 1777 sparked a series of scholarly editions of the poem in Germany, and its first translations into German (in 1780) and Latin (in 1782). It was also an influence on Johann Wolfgang von Goethe&#x27;s melodrama &quot;Proserpina&quot;, first published as a prose work in 1778. 

The hymns were frequently read, praised and adapted by the English Romantic poets of the early nineteenth century. In 1814, the essayist and poet Leigh Hunt published a translation of the second &quot;Hymn to Dionysus&quot;. Thomas Love Peacock adapted part of the same hymn in the fifth canto of his &quot;Rhododaphne&quot;, published posthumously in 1818. In January 1818, Percy Bysshe Shelley made a translation of some of the shorter &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot; into heroic couplets; in July 1820, he translated the &quot;Hymn to Hermes&quot; into . Of Shelley&#x27;s own poems, &quot;The Witch of Atlas&quot;, written in 1820, and &quot;With a Guitar, to Jane&quot;, written in 1822, were most closely influenced by the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot;, particularly the &quot;Hymn to Hermes&quot;. The 1889 poem &quot;Demeter and Persephone&quot; by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, reinterprets the narrative of the &quot;Hymn to Demeter&quot; as an allegory for the coming of Christ. 

The &quot;Hymn to Demeter&quot; was particularly influential as one of the few sources, and the earliest source, for the religious rituals known as the Eleusinian Mysteries. It became an important nexus of the debate as to the nature of early Greek religion in early-nineteenth-century German scholarship. The anthropologist James George Frazer discussed the hymn at length in &quot;The Golden Bough,&quot; his influential 1890 work of comparative mythology and religion. James Joyce made use of the same hymn, and possibly Frazer&#x27;s work, in his 1922 novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;, in which the character Stephen Dedalus references &quot;an old hymn to Demeter&quot; while undergoing a journey reminiscent of the Eleusinian Mysteries. Joyce also drew upon the &quot;Hymn to Hermes&quot; in the characterisation of both Dedalus and his companion Buck Mulligan. &quot;The&quot; &quot;Cantos&quot; by Joyce&#x27;s friend and mentor Ezra Pound, written between 1915 and 1960, also draw on the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot;: Canto I concludes with parts of the hymns to Aphrodite, in both Latin and English. In modern Greek poetry, the 1901 &quot;Interruption&quot; by Constantine P. Cavafy references the myth of Demophon as told in the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Demeter&quot;.

The first &quot;Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite&quot; has also been cited as an influence on Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s 1954 film &quot;Rear Window&quot;, particularly for the character of Lisa Freemont, played by Grace Kelly. Judith Fletcher has traced allusions to the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Demeter&quot; in Neil Gaiman&#x27;s 2002 children&#x27;s novel &quot;Coraline&quot; and its 2009 film adaptation, arguing that the allusions in the novel&#x27;s text are &quot;subliminal&quot; but become explicit in the film.

== Textual history ==
=== Ancient and early modern transmission ===
Only a few ancient papyrus copies of the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot; are known. An Attic vase painted around 470 BCE shows a youth, seated, holding a scroll with the first two words of the second &quot;Homeric Hymn to Hermes&quot;: this has been used to suggest that the hymns were used as educational texts by this period. At least the longer hymns seem to have been collected into a single edition at some point during the Hellenistic period (323–30 BCE). Alexander Hall has argued that Hymns 1–26, except 6 (the &quot;Hymn to Aphrodite&quot;) and 8 (the &quot;Hymn to Ares&quot;), were initially collected into what he calls a &quot;proto-collection&quot;, probably no earlier than the Hellenistic period, with the remaining hymns later added as an appendix. 

Unlike those of the &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;, the text of the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot; was comparatively little edited by the Hellenistic scholars of Alexandria. has suggested that, throughout antiquity, manuscripts of the text may have circulated which intentionally included two different versions (&quot;doublets&quot;) of the same word: Alexandrian scholars developed the practice of marking these with a dotted antisigma (ↄ), evidence of which can be found in surviving manuscripts of the &quot;Hymn to Apollo&quot;. 

The grouping of the hymns into their current may date to late antiquity. References to the shorter poems as being within the corpus begin to be found in sources dating from the second and third centuries CE. The assemblage of the thirty-three hymns listed today as &quot;Homeric&quot; dates to no earlier than the third century CE. Between the fifth and the thirteenth centuries CE, the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot; were generally transcribed in an edition which also contained the &quot;Hymns&quot; of Callimachus, the &quot;Orphic Hymns&quot;, the hymns of Proclus and the &quot;Orphic Argonautica&quot;. 

Manuscripts of the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot;, often bundling them with other works such as the hymns of Callimachus, continued to be made during the Byzantine period. The surviving medieval manuscripts of the poems date to the fifteenth century and are drawn primarily from the late-antique compilation of the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot; along with Orphic and other hymnic poetry. They all descend from a single, now-lost manuscript, known in scholarship by the siglum Ω (omega) and possibly written in minuscule. In fifteenth-century Italy, the hymns were copied widely. A manuscript known by the siglum V, commissioned by the Byzantine-born Catholic cardinal Bessarion probably in the 1460s, published the hymns at the end of a collection of the other works then considered Homeric. This arrangement became standard in subsequent editions of Homer&#x27;s works, and played an important role in establishing the perceived relationship between the hymns, the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. The first printed edition () of the works of Homer, which included the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot;, was made by the Florence-based Greek scholar Demetrios Chalkokondyles in 1488–1489. The 1566 edition, made by Henri Estienne, was the first to include line numbers and a Latin translation.

By the end of the eighteenth century, twenty-five Byzantine manuscripts were known. One, known as M or the , was written by the polymath Ioannes Eugenikos in the first half of the fifteenth century, possibly in Constantinople or Italy. This manuscript preserved both the first &quot;Hymn to Dionysus&quot; and the &quot;Hymn to Demeter&quot;, but both were lost at some point after its creation and remained unknown until 1777, when the philologist Christian Frederick Matthaei discovered Μ in a barn outside Moscow. All surviving manuscripts, apart from Μ, have among their sources a lost one known by the siglum Ψ (psi), which probably dates to the twelfth or thirteenth century. This may be a manuscript mentioned in a letter by the humanist Giovanni Aurispa in 1424, which he stated he had acquired in Constantinople; Aurispa&#x27;s manuscript has also been suggested as being Ω. As of 2016, a total of twenty-nine manuscripts of the hymns are known.

=== Modern scholarship ===

Until the later twentieth century, the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot; received relatively little attention from classical scholars or translators. No of the hymns&#x27; manuscripts was made between that of Chalkokondyles in 1488 and 1749. Joshua Barnes published an edition of the hymns in 1711, which was the first to attempt to explain textual issues by citing parallels in other texts considered to be Homeric. Friedrich August Wolf published two editions, as part of larger editions of Homer, in 1794 and 1807. The first modern edition of the hymns as a separate text, without the Homeric epics, was made in 1796 by Karl David Ilgen and followed by editions by August Mattiae in 1805 and Gottfried Hermann in 1806. In 1886, published a German edition of the hymns: this was both the first modern edition in a vernacular language (that is, not in Latin) and the only edition to date that has printed digammas in their text. The present conventional order of the hymns was established by the Oxford edition of Alfred Goodwin in 1893, following that employed by the manuscript M: previously, the &quot;Hymn to Apollo&quot; had been placed first. Reviewing Goodwin&#x27;s work in 1894, Edward Ernest Sikes judged that most of the important work on the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot; had previously been done by German scholars, and that &quot;little of importance&quot; had recently been written, apart from Goodwin&#x27;s edition, on them in English. 

In the first half of the eighteenth century, wrote a book of notes on the text of the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot;, in which he condemned Barnes&#x27;s then-standard 1711 edition and the 1722 edition of Michel Maittaire. The first modern textual criticism of the hymns dates to 1749, when David Ruhnken published his readings of two medieval manuscripts, known as A and C. The hymns&#x27; text was a matter of considerable scholarly attention in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. August Baumeister published an edition of the hymns in 1860, which was the first to integrate readings based on the Θ (theta) family of manuscripts (a sub-family of those descended from Ψ). Robert Yelverton Tyrrell wrote in 1894 that the text of the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot; had been in a &quot;state of chaos&quot; before Baumeister&#x27;s edition, though their text was still considered problematic at the turn of the 20th century: Thomas Leyden Agar wrote in 1916 of the &quot;manifold and manifest&quot; errors of tradition in the hymns. In 1984, Bruno Gentili suggested that variations found in the manuscript tradition as to the reading of particular passages may have been considered equally-correct alternations () available to a rhapsode, and therefore that attempts to discriminate between them in modern editions were misguided.

Between 1894 and 1897, Thomas William Allen published a series of four articles in &quot;The Journal of Hellenic Studies&quot; on textual problems in the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot;, which became the basis of the 1904 edition of the hymns he co-produced with Edward Ernest Sikes. In 1912, Allen published an edition of the hymns in the &quot;Oxford Classical Texts&quot; series. He published an updated version of his 1904 edition in 1936, co-edited with William Reginald Halliday; Sikes refused to collaborate on it, but remained credited as an editor. The first commentary on a single hymn was that of Nicholas Richardson on the &quot;Hymn to Demeter&quot; in 1974. In his Loeb Classical Library edition of 2003, Martin West rejected the argument of Gentili, choosing instead to posit a correct reading for each known alternation.

<text>Warendorf () is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the northern part of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Neighboring districts are Steinfurt, Osnabrück (district), Gütersloh, Soest, district-free city Hamm, Coesfeld and the district-free city Münster.

==History==
In medieval times the region was part of the Prince-Bishopric of Münster. When it became part of the Prussian Province of Westphalia, the new government in 1816 created the districts of Warendorf and Beckum. In 1975 these two districts were merged to form today&#x27;s district.

==Geography==
The district is located east of the city of Münster. The Ems river runs through the district from east to west. The Lippe River forms part of the southern border of the district.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms is a combination of the two coats of the precursor districts Warendorf and Beckum. The two sun roses are taken from the Warendorf coat of arms, which took it from the family coat of arms of the Vogt family in Warendorpe. The wavy line comes from the Beckum coat of arms, and symbolized the richness of water in the area, especially the Werse river. The coat of arms was granted in 1976.

<text>Joe Palooka is an American comic strip about a heavyweight boxing champion, created by cartoonist Ham Fisher. The strip debuted on April 19, 1930 and was carried at its peak by 900 newspapers. It was cancelled in 1984.

The strip was adapted to a 15-minute CBS radio series, 12 feature-length films (chiefly from Monogram Pictures), nine Vitaphone film shorts, a 1954 syndicated television series (&quot;The Joe Palooka Story&quot;), comic books and merchandise, including a 1940s board game, a 1947 New Haven Clock &amp; Watch Company wristwatch, a 1948 metal lunchbox featuring depictions of Joe, Humphrey and Little Max, and a 1946 Wheaties cereal box cut-out mask. In 1980, a mountain in Pennsylvania was named for the character.

== Publication history ==
In his home town of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, Fisher devised the character in 1921 after he met a boxer, Pete Latzo, outside a poolroom. As Fisher explained in an article in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;:
Many rejections followed before Fisher&#x27;s strip was finally syndicated by the McNaught Syndicate after Fisher, while employed as a McNaught salesman, sold it to over 20 newspapers. It debuted April 19, 1930, and by 1948, it was ranked as one of the five most popular newspaper comic strips.

After Fisher committed suicide in 1955, his assistant Moe Leff drew the strip for four years. Leff had been ghosting on the strip&#x27;s art since the late 1930s; his first credited strip was September 17, 1956. Lank Leonard recommended Tony DiPreta, who stepped in starting September 7, 1959, to illustrate scripts by Morris Weiss (early 1960s to early 1970s) and Ed Moore (mid 1970s on). DiPreta stayed with the strip for 25 years until it ended its run November 24, 1984, when it had dropped to only 182 newspapers. DiPreta then moved on to draw &quot;Rex Morgan, M.D.&quot;

==Toppers==
The &quot;Joe Palooka&quot; Sunday page had many different toppers over the course of the run.

One of the early toppers was &quot;Fisher&#x27;s Looney Legends&quot;, which ran from January 10, 1932 to August 27, 1933. During this run, the strip had many alternate titles, including &quot;Fisher&#x27;s Dopey Dramas&quot;, &quot;Fisher&#x27;s Foolish Fables&quot;, &quot;Fisher&#x27;s Historical Hysteria&quot;, &quot;Fisher&#x27;s Neolithic Narratives&quot;, &quot;Fisher&#x27;s Nursery Rhymes&quot; and &quot;Fisher&#x27;s Poet&#x27;s Corner&quot;. This was replaced by three longer features: &quot;Fisher&#x27;s History of Boxing&quot; (Sept 3, 1933 – June 20, 1937), &quot;Joe Palooka&#x27;s Boxing Course&quot; (June 27, 1937 – May 1, 1938) and &quot;Joe Palooka&#x27;s Album&quot; (May 8, 1938 – Nov 14, 1943).

From 1943–1946, the topper strip rotated between a variety of different features. The most often used titles during this period were &quot;War Time Anecdotes&quot; aka &quot;Fisher&#x27;s Wartime Whoppers&quot; (Nov 21, 1943 – Sept 9, 1945), &quot;Miss Jones&quot; aka &quot;The Estimable Miss Jones&quot; (March 12, 1944 – Nov 11, 1945), &quot;After It&#x27;s Over&quot; (April 8 – Oct 7, 1945), &quot;Sidewalks of Manhattan&quot; (Nov 18, 1945 – Feb 24, 1966), &quot;Charlie the Cook&quot; (Oct 15, 1944 – Sept 23, 1945), and &quot;Lady De Van&quot; (March 3 – July 7, 1946). Other titles used during this period include &quot;The Atom Age&quot;, &quot;Captain Tommy&quot;, &quot;Could Be&quot;, &quot;Guy Who Married a WAC Sergeant&quot;, &quot;Fisher&#x27;s Follies&quot;, &quot;How To Be Popular?&quot;, &quot;Letter From Home&quot;, &quot;Mebbe I&#x27;m Wrong&quot;, &quot;Now That It&#x27;s Over&quot;, &quot;Smythe the Murp&#x27;s Ex-Butler&quot;, and &quot;Two Thousand A.D.&quot;

==Characters and story==
Fisher originally changed the appearance of Palooka to fit each reigning real-life champ – until the coming of African-American Joe Louis in the 1930s, at which time the image of the cowlicked blond Palooka remained unchanged. Though his adventures were mostly low-key, he was pumped up by a supporting cast led by girlfriend Ann Howe, boxing manager Knobby Walsh, his mute orphan sidekick Little Max, Smokey, his black valet and later sparring partner, and lovable giant Humphrey Pennyworth, a smiling blacksmith who wielded a 100-pound (45 kg) maul. Like Ozark Ike McBatt in baseball, &quot;Joe Palooka&quot; was intended to exemplify the sports hero in an age when uprightness of character was supposed to matter most. The character was part of an effort among top newspaper cartoonists to sell World War II-era Series E bonds to the public as a wartime financing initiative.
The strip garnered much publicity when cheese heiress Ann Howe and Joe were married on June 24, 1949. The engraved invitations for the event, sent to a select list of celebrities, read: &quot;Mr. Ham Fisher requests the honour of your presence at the marriage of Ann Howe to Mr. Joe Palooka on the afternoon of June 24th in your favorite newspaper.&quot; Fisher received formal acceptances from Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson, General Omar Bradley and Attorney General Tom C. Clark. At the time, the strip was carried in 665 American newspapers and 125 foreign papers.

==Etymology==
Of uncertain origin, the word &quot;palooka&quot; was found in print as early as 1923 and widely used to mean a lout or an inept fighter.

== Comic books ==

Over decades, &quot;Joe Palooka&quot; appeared in comic books from several comic book publishers. Early comic books offered strip reprints, but eventually the character was seen in original comic book stories. Secondary characters Little Max and Humphrey Pennyworth each had their own Harvey Comics series.

Joe Antonacci owns the trademark to and has recreated Joe Palooka. A brand new comic book version of the character created by Antonacci and his creative team was published by IDW Publishing in 2012. Palooka is reborn as a mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter. Antonacci&#x27;s team has also created a sister series of MMA-themed comic books entitled &quot;Legion of Combat&quot;.

==Radio series==
On radio, &quot;Joe Palooka&quot; was broadcast on CBS from April 12 to August 18, 1932. With Teddy Bergman in the title role, the 15-minute series was heard on Tuesdays and Thursdays, sponsored by Heinz Rice Flakes. Elmira Roessler, Elsie Hitz and Mary Jane Higby played Ann Howe. Knobby Walsh was portrayed by Frank Readick and Hal Lansing. Others in the cast: Karl Swenson and Norman Gottschalk. The announcer was Harry von Zell.

==Films and television==
Joe Palooka made his film debut in &quot;Palooka&quot; (1934) with Stuart Erwin in the title role, Jimmy Durante as Knobby, Lupe Vélez as Nina Madero, and Marjorie Rambeau as Mayme Palooka. Now in the public domain, the film can be seen online. &quot;Palooka&quot; was followed by a series of nine two-reel Vitaphone shorts (1936–37) starring Robert Norton as Joe and Shemp Howard as Knobby.

He returned to feature-length films in 1946, when Monogram Pictures launched a series of 11 low-budget films starring Joe Kirkwood, Jr. as Joe, Leon Errol as Knobby and Elyse Knox as Ann Howe. The first in the series was &quot;Joe Palooka, Champ&quot; (1946); the series ended 1951, with &quot;Joe Palooka in Triple Cross&quot;.

&quot;The Joe Palooka Story&quot;, popularly known simply as &quot;Joe Palooka&quot;, was a 1954 syndicated television series starring Kirkwood and featuring former boxing champion Maxie Rosenbloom as Humphrey Pennyworth.

==Cultural legacy==
The name appears in several episodes of the long-running television show &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, most notably in the 10th season episode &#x27;Heroes&#x27; where fictional prize fighter &#x27;Gentleman Joe&#x27; Cavanaugh visits the outfit and Margaret remarks &quot;Is that what it takes to get a steak dinner around here, a visit from some Joe Palooka&quot;

South of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania on the way to the town of Mountain Top, Pennsylvania is Joe Palooka Mountain, named in the early 1980s by then-Mayor of Wilkes-Barre Thomas McLaughlin. A granite monument with the likeness of Joe Palooka is located at the base of the mountain at the intersection of PA 309 and PA 437 between Wilkes-Barre and the town of Mountain Top.

In September 1948, a limestone Joe Palooka statue (in a flowing cape) was erected on a hill overlooking Indiana State Road 37. In 1984, the nine-foot high, ten-ton statue and its base were moved and rededicated to the Town Hall in Oolitic, Indiana.

In &quot;The Story of a Shipwrecked Sailor&quot;, sailor Luis Alejandro Velasco refers to a &quot;Joe Palooka&quot; tavern at a port in Mobile, AL, United States, where he and his shipmates, while on leave, went to drink whisky and threw a fight from time to time.

In &quot;Sometimes a Great Notion&quot;, Ken Kesey skewers one of his characters with this paragraph: &quot;&#x27;Tsk, tsk,&#x27; said Brother Walker. And, as he had learned the comment from &quot;Joe Palooka&quot;, it came out &#x27;tisk tisk&#x27;, the way he assumed it was pronounced.&quot;

In the 1977 film &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot;, after having been drawn into a fight and taking a beating, character Cledus &quot;Snowman&quot; Snow (Jerry Reed) tells his friend Bo &quot;Bandit&quot; Darville (Burt Reynolds) over the CB radio, &quot;Look, you ain&#x27;t gonna believe this, but I just did my imitation of Joe Palooka.&quot;

<text>A musket is a muzzle-loaded long gun that appeared as a smoothbore weapon in the early 16th century, at first as a heavier variant of the arquebus, capable of penetrating plate armour. By the mid-16th century, this type of musket gradually disappeared as the use of heavy armour declined, but &quot;musket&quot; continued as the generic term for smoothbore long guns until the mid-19th century. In turn, this style of musket was retired in the 19th century when rifled muskets (simply called rifles in modern terminology) using the Minié ball (invented by Claude-Étienne Minié in 1849) became common. The development of breech-loading firearms using self-contained cartridges (introduced by Casimir Lefaucheux in 1835) and the first reliable repeating rifles produced by Winchester Repeating Arms Company in 1860 also led to their demise. By the time that repeating rifles became common, they were known as simply &quot;rifles&quot;, ending the era of the musket.

==Etymology==
According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, firearms were often named after animals, and the word musket derived from the French word , which is a male sparrowhawk. An alternative theory is that derives from the 16th-century French , from the Italian , meaning the bolt of a crossbow. The Italian is a diminutive of , a fly.

===Terminology===
The first recorded usage of the term &quot;musket&quot; or appeared in Europe in the year 1499. Evidence of the musket as a type of firearm does not appear until 1521 when it was used to describe a heavy arquebus capable of penetrating heavy armour. This version of the musket fell out of use after the mid-16th century with the decline of heavy armour; however, the term itself stuck around as a general descriptor for &quot;shoulder arms&quot; fire weapons into the 19th century. The differences between the arquebus and musket post-16th century are therefore not entirely clear, and the two have been used interchangeably on several occasions. According to historian David A. Parrot, the concept of the musket as a legitimate innovation is uncertain and may consist of nothing more than a name change.

==Parts of a musket==
Trigger guards began appearing in 1575.

Bayonets were attached to muskets in several parts of the world from the late 16th to 17th centuries.

Locks came in many different varieties. Early matchlock and wheel lock mechanisms were replaced by later flintlock mechanisms and finally percussion locks. In some parts of the world, such as China and Japan, the flintlock mechanism never caught on and they continued using matchlocks until the 19th century when percussion locks were introduced.

In the latter half of the 18th century, several improvements were added to the musket. In 1750, a detent was added to prevent the sear from catching in the half-cock notch. A roller bearing was introduced in 1770 to reduce friction and increase sparks. In 1780, waterproof pans were added.

The phrase &quot;lock, stock, and barrel&quot; refers to the three main parts of a musket.

==Ammunition==
Sixteenth- and 17th-century musketeers used bandoliers which held their pre-measured charges and lead balls.

The Minié ball, which despite its name was actually bullet-shaped and not ball-shaped, was developed in the 1840s. The Minié ball had an expanding skirt which was intended to be used with rifled barrels, leading to what was called the rifled musket, which came into widespread use in the mid-19th century. The Minié ball was small enough in diameter that it could be loaded as quickly as a round ball, even with a barrel that had been fouled with black powder residue after firing many shots, and the expanding skirt of the Minié ball meant that it would still form a tight fit with the barrel and impart a good spin into the round when fired. This gave the rifled musket an effective range of several hundred yards, which was a significant improvement over the smooth bore musket. For example, combat ranges of were achievable using the rifled muskets during the American Civil War.

Musketeers often used paper cartridges, which served a purpose similar to that of modern metallic cartridges in combining bullet and powder charge. A musket cartridge consisted of a pre-measured amount of black powder and ammunition such as a round ball, Nessler ball or Minié ball all wrapped up in paper. Cartridges would then be placed in a cartridge box, which would typically be worn on the musketeer&#x27;s belt during a battle. Unlike a modern cartridge, this paper cartridge was not simply loaded into the weapon and fired. Instead, the musketeer would tear open the paper (usually with his teeth), pour some of the powder into the pan and the rest into the barrel, follow it with the ammunition (and the paper as wadding if not using a Minié ball), then use the ramrod as normal to push it all into the barrel. While not as fast as loading a modern cartridge, this method did significantly speed up the loading process since the pre-measured charges meant that the musketeer did not have to carefully measure out the black powder with every shot.

==Accessories==
Some ramrods were equipped with threaded ends, allowing different attachments to be used. One of the more common attachments was a ball screw or ball puller, which was a screw that could be screwed into the lead ball to remove it if it had become jammed in the barrel, similar to the way that a corkscrew is used to remove a wine cork. Another attachment was called a worm, which was used to clear debris from the barrel, such as paper wadding that had not been expelled. Some worm designs were sturdy enough that they could be used to remove stuck ammunition. The worm could also be used with a small piece of cloth for cleaning. A variation on the worm called the &quot;screw and wiper&quot; combined the typical design of a worm with a ball puller&#x27;s screw.

==History==

=== Heavy arquebus ===
The heavy arquebus known as the musket appeared in Europe by 1521. In response to firearms, thicker armour was produced, from in the 15th century to in the late 16th century. Armour that was thick required nearly three times as much energy to penetrate as did armour that was only thick. During the siege of Parma in 1521, many Spanish soldiers reportedly used an &quot;arquebus with rest&quot;, a weapon much larger and more powerful than the regular arquebus. However, at this point, long-barrelled, musket-calibre weapons had been in use as wall-defence weapons in Europe for almost a century. 

The musketeers were the first infantry to give up armour entirely. Musketeers began to take cover behind walls or in sunken lanes and sometimes acted as skirmishers to take advantage of their ranged weapons. In England, the musket barrel was cut down from to around 1630. The number of musketeers relative to pikemen increased partly because they were now more mobile than pikemen.

Muskets of the 16th to 19th centuries were accurate enough to hit a target of in diameter at a distance of . At the same distance, musket bullets could penetrate a steel bib about thick, or a wooden shield about thick. The maximum range of the bullet was . The speed of the bullets was between , and the kinetic energy was . 

=== Flintlock musket ===
The heavy musket went out of favour around the same time the snaphance flintlock was invented in Europe, in 1550. The snaphance was followed by the &quot;true&quot; flintlock in the late 17th century. While the heavy variant of the arquebus died out due to the decline of heavy armour, the term &quot;musket&quot; itself stuck around as a general term for &#x27;shoulder arms&#x27; fireweapons, replacing &quot;arquebus,&quot; and remained until the 1800s. The differences between the arquebus and musket post-16th century are therefore not entirely clear, and the two have been used interchangeably on several occasions. Flintlocks are not usually associated with arquebuses.

A variation of the musket known as the caliver, a standardized &quot;calibre&quot; (spelled &quot;caliber&quot; in the US), appeared in Europe around 1567–9. According to Jacob de Gheyn, the caliver was a smaller musket that did not require a fork rest. Benerson Little described it as a &quot;light musket&quot;.

===Asia===
Matchlock firearms were used in India by 1500, in Đại Việt by 1516, and in Southeast Asia by 1540. According to a Burmese source from the late 15th century, King Minkhaung II would not dare attack the besieged town of Prome due to the defenders&#x27; use of cannon and small arms that were described as muskets, although these were probably early matchlock arquebuses or wall guns.

====South Asia====
The Portuguese may have introduced muskets to Sri Lanka during their conquest of the coastline and lowlands in 1505, as they regularly used short barrelled matchlocks during combat. However, P. E. P. Deraniyagala points out that the Sinhalese term for gun, &#x27;bondikula&#x27;, matches the Arabic term for gun, &#x27;bunduk&#x27;. Also, certain technical aspects of the early Sri Lankan matchlock were similar to the matchlocks used in the Middle East, thus forming the generally accepted theory that the musket was not entirely new to the island by the time the Portuguese came. In any case, soon native Sri Lankan kingdoms, most notably the Kingdom of Sitawaka and the Kingdom of Kandy, manufactured hundreds of Lankan muskets, with a unique bifurcated stock, longer barrel and smaller calibre, which made it more efficient in directing and using the energy of the gunpowder. These were mastered by the Sri Lankan soldiers to the point where, according to the Portuguese chronicler, Queirós, they could &quot;fire at night to put out a match&quot; and &quot;by day at 60 paces would sever a knife with four or five bullets&quot; and &quot;send as many on the same spot in the target.&quot;

====Middle East====
Despite initial reluctance, the Safavid Empire of Persia rapidly acquired the art of making and using handguns. A Venetian envoy, Vincenzo di Alessandri, in a report presented to the Council of Ten on 24 September 1572, observed:

====Japan====
During the Sengoku period of Japan, arquebuses were introduced by Portuguese merchantmen from the region of Alentejo in 1543 and by the 1560s were being mass-produced locally. By the end of the 16th century, the production of firearms in Japan reached enormous proportions, which allowed for a successful military operation in Korea during the Japanese invasions of Korea. Korean chief state councillor Yu Sŏngnyong noted the clear superiority of the Japanese musketeers over the Korean archers:

====China====
Arquebuses were imported by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) at an uncertain point, but the Ming only began fielding matchlocks in 1548. The Chinese used the term &quot;bird-gun&quot; to refer to arquebuses and Turkish arquebuses may have reached China before Portuguese ones. In Zhao Shizhen&#x27;s book of 1598 AD, the &quot;Shenqipu&quot;, there were illustrations of Ottoman Turkish musketeers with detailed illustrations of their muskets, alongside European musketeers with detailed illustrations of their muskets. There was also illustration and description of how the Chinese had adopted the Ottoman kneeling position in firing while using European-made muskets, though Zhao Shizhen described the Turkish muskets as being superior to the European muskets. The &quot;Wu Pei Chih&quot; (1621) later described Turkish muskets that used a rack and pinion mechanism, which was not known to have been used in any European or Chinese firearms at the time.

====Korea====
In Korea, the Joseon dynasty underwent a devastating war with the newly unified Japan that lasted from 1592 to 1598. The shock of this encounter spurred the court to undergo a process of military strengthening. One of the core elements of military strengthening was to adopt the musket. According to reformers, &quot;In recent times in China they did not have muskets; they first learned about them from the Wokou pirates in Zhejiang Province. Qi Jiguang trained troops in their use for several years until they [muskets] became one of the skills of the Chinese, who subsequently used them to defeat the Japanese.&quot; By 1607 Korean musketeers had been trained in the fashion which Qi Jiguang prescribed, and a drill manual had been produced based on the Chinese leader&#x27;s &quot;Jixiao Xinshu&quot;. Of the volley fire, the manual says that &quot;every musketeer squad should either divide into two musketeers per layer or one and deliver fire in five volleys or in ten.&quot; Another Korean manual produced in 1649 describes a similar process: &quot;When the enemy approaches to within a hundred paces, a signal gun is fired and a conch is blown, at which the soldiers stand. Then a gong is sounded, the conch stops blowing, and the heavenly swan [a double-reed horn] is sounded, at which the musketeers fire in concert, either all at once or in five volleys (齊放一次盡擧或分五擧).&quot; This training method proved to be quite formidable in the 1619 Battle of Sarhu, in which 10,000 Korean musketeers managed to kill many Manchus before their allies surrendered. While Korea went on to lose both wars against the Manchu invasions of 1627 and 1636, their musketeers were well respected by Manchu leaders. It was the first Qing emperor Hong Taiji who wrote: &quot;The Koreans are incapable on horseback but do not transgress the principles of the military arts. They excel at infantry fighting, especially in musketeer tactics.&quot;

Afterwards, the Qing dynasty requested Joseon to aid in their border conflict with Russia. In 1654, 370 Russians engaged a 1,000-man Qing-Joseon force at the mouth of the Songhua River and were defeated by Joseon musketeers. In 1658, five hundred Russians engaged a 1,400-strong Qing-Joseon force and were defeated again by Joseon musketeers. Under the Three Branch System, similar to the Spanish Tercio, Joseon organized their army under firearm troops (artillery and musketeers), archers, and pikemen or swordsmen. The percentage of firearms in the Joseon army rose dramatically as a result of the shorter training period for firearms. In addition, the sulphur mines discovered in Jinsan reduced the expense of producing gunpowder. Under the reign of Sukjong of Joseon (1700s), 76.4% of the local standing army in Chungcheong were musketeers. Under the reign of King Yeongjo, Yoon Pil-Un, Commander of the Sua-chung, improved on firearms with the Chunbochong (천보총), which had a greater range of fire than the existing ones. Its usage is thought to have been similar to the Afghan jezail or American long rifle.

===Outside Eurasia===
During the Musket Wars period in New Zealand, between 1805 and 1843, at least 500 conflicts took place between various Māori tribes—often using trade muskets in addition to traditional Māori weapons. The muskets were initially cheap Birmingham muskets designed for the use of coarse grain black powder. Maori favoured the shorter barrel versions. Some tribes took advantage of runaway sailors and escaped convicts to expand their understanding of muskets. Early missionaries—one of whom was a trained gunsmith—refused to help Māori repair muskets. Later, common practice was to enlarge the percussion hole and to hold progressively smaller lead balls between the fingers so that muskets could fire several shots without having to remove fouling. Likewise, Māori resorted to thumping the butt of the musket on the ground to settle the ball instead of using a ramrod. Māori favoured the use of the double-barrel shot gun (&quot;Tuparra&quot; – two barrel) during fighting often using women to reload the weapons when fighting from a &quot;Pā&quot; (fortified village or hillfort). They often resorted to using nails, stones or anything convenient as &quot;shot&quot;. From the 1850s, Māori were able to obtain superior military style muskets with greater range. One of the authors was a &quot;Pakeha&quot; (European) who lived among Māori, spoke the language fluently, had a Māori wife and took part in many intertribal conflicts as a warrior.

=== Replacement by the rifle ===
The musket was a smoothbore firearm and lacked rifling grooves that would have spun the bullet in such a way as to increase its accuracy. The last contact with the musket barrel gives the ball a spin around an axis at right angles to the direction of flight. The aerodynamics result in the ball veering off in a random direction from the aiming point. The practice of rifling, putting grooves in the barrel of a weapon, causing the projectile to spin on the same axis as the line of flight, prevented this veering off from the aiming point. Rifles already existed in Europe by the late 15th century, but they were primarily used as sporting weapons and had little presence in warfare. The problem with rifles was the tendency for powder fouling to accumulate in the rifling, making the piece more difficult to load with each shot. Eventually, the weapon could not be loaded until the bore was wiped clean. For this reason, smoothbore muskets remained the primary firearm of most armies until the mid-19th century. It was not until 1611 that rifles started seeing some limited usage in warfare by Denmark. Around 1750, rifles began to be used by skirmishers of Frederick the Great, recruited in 1744 from a Jäger unit of game-keepers and foresters, but the rifle&#x27;s slow rate of fire still restricted their usage.

The invention of the Minié ball in 1849 solved both major problems of muzzle-loading rifles. Rifled muskets of the mid-19th century, like the Springfield Model 1861 which dealt heavy casualties at the Battle of Four Lakes, were significantly more accurate, with the ability to hit a man-sized target at a distance of or more. The smoothbore musket generally allowed no more than with any accuracy.

The Crimean War (1853–1856) saw the first widespread use of the rifled musket for the common infantryman and by the time of the American Civil War (1861–1865) most infantry were equipped with the rifled musket. These were far more accurate than smoothbore muskets and had a far longer range, while preserving the musket&#x27;s comparatively faster reloading rate. Their use led to a decline in the use of massed attacking formations, as these formations were too vulnerable to the accurate, long-range fire a rifle could produce. In particular, attacking troops were within range of the defenders for a longer period of time, and the defenders could also fire at them more quickly than before. As a result, while 18th-century attackers would only be within range of the defenders&#x27; weapons for the time it would take to fire a few shots, late-19th-century attackers might suffer dozens of volleys before they drew close to the defenders, with correspondingly high casualty rates. However, the use of massed attacks on fortified positions were not immediately replaced with new tactics, and as a result, major wars of the late 19th century and early 20th century tended to produce very high casualty figures.

==Operation==

Many soldiers preferred to reduce the standard musket reloading procedures to increase the speed of fire. This statement is from Thomas Anburey who served as a lieutenant in Burgoyne&#x27;s army:
&quot;Here I cannot help observing to you, whether it proceeded from an idea of self-preservation, or natural instinct, but the soldiers greatly improved the mode they were taught in, as to expedition. For as soon as they had primed their pieces and put the cartridge into the barrel, instead of ramming it down with their rods, they struck the butt end of the piece upon the ground, and bringing it to the present, fired it off&quot;. This practice was known as &#x27;tap-loading&#x27;.

==Tactics==

===Countermarch===
As muskets became the default weapon of armies, the slow reloading time became an increasing problem. The difficulty of reloading—and thus the time needed to do it—was diminished by making the musket ball much smaller than the internal diameter of the barrel, so as the interior of the barrel became dirty from soot from previously fired rounds, the musket ball from the next shot could still be easily rammed. To keep the ball in place once the weapon was loaded, it would be partially wrapped in a small piece of cloth. However, the smaller ball could move within the barrel as the musket was fired, decreasing the accuracy of musket fire (it was complained that it took a man&#x27;s weight in lead musket balls to kill him).

The development of volley fire—by the Ottomans, the Chinese, the Japanese, and the Dutch—made muskets more feasible for widespread adoption by the military. The volley fire technique transformed soldiers carrying firearms into organized firing squads with each row of soldiers firing in turn and reloading in a systematic fashion. Volley fire was implemented with cannons as early as 1388 by Ming artillerists, but volley fire with matchlocks was not implemented until 1526 when the Ottoman Janissaries used it during the Battle of Mohács. The matchlock volley fire technique was next seen in mid-16th-century China as pioneered by Qi Jiguang and in late-16th-century Japan. Qi Jiguang elaborates on his countermarch volley fire technique in the &quot;Jixiao Xinshu&quot;:

Frederick Lewis Taylor claims that a kneeling volley fire may have been employed by Prospero Colonna&#x27;s arquebusiers as early as the Battle of Bicocca (1522). However, this has been called into question by Tonio Andrade who believes this is an over interpretation as well as mis-citation of a passage by Charles Oman suggesting that the Spanish arquebusiers kneeled to reload, when in fact Oman never made such a claim. This is contested by Idan Sherer, who quotes Paolo Giovio saying that the arquebusiers kneeled to reload so that the second line of arquebusiers could fire without endangering those in front of them.

European gunners might have implemented countermarch to some extent since at least 1579 when the Englishman Thomas Digges suggested that musketeers should, &quot;after the old Romane manner make three or four several fronts, with convenient spaces for the first to retire and unite himselfe with the second, and both these if occasion so require, with the third; the shot [musketeers] having their convenient lanes continually during the fight to discharge their peces.&quot; The Spanish too displayed some awareness of the volley technique. Martín de Eguiluz described it in the military manual, &quot;Milicia, Discurso y Regla Militar&quot;, dating to 1586: &quot;Start with three files of five soldiers each, separated one from the other by fifteen paces, and they should comport themselves not with fury but with calm skillfulness [con reposo diestramente] such that when the first file has finished shooting they make space for the next (which is coming up to shoot) without turning face, countermarching [contrapassando] to the left but showing the enemy only the side of their bodies, which is the narrowest of the body, and [taking their place at the rear] about one to three steps behind, with five or six pellets in their mouths, and two lighted matchlock fuses ... and they load [their pieces] promptly ... and return to shoot when it&#x27;s their turn again.&quot; Most historians, including Geoffrey Parker, have ignored Eguiluz, and have erroneously attributed the invention of the countermarch to Maurice of Nassau, although the publication of the &quot;Milicia, Discurso y Regla Militar&quot; antedates Maurice&#x27;s first letter on the subject by two years. Regardless, it is clear that the concept of volley fire had existed in Europe for quite some time during the 16th century, but it was in the Netherlands during the 1590s that the musketry volley really took off. The key to this development was William Louis, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg who in 1594 described the technique in a letter to his cousin:

===Light infantry===
In the 18th century, regular light infantry began to emerge. In contrast to the front-line infantry, they fought in the loose formation, used natural shelters and terrain folds. In addition, they were better prepared to target single targets. This type of troops was designed to fight against irregular enemy troops, such as militia, guerrillas and natives. At the beginning of the 19th century, the number of light infantry increased dramatically. In the French army, light infantry accounted for 25% of the infantry. In the Russian Army, 50 light infantry regiments and one company in each battalion were formed, which accounted for about 40% of light infantry in the entire infantry.

===Attack column===
In the 19th century, a new tactic was devised by the French during the French Revolutionary Wars. This was the &#x27;&quot;colonne d&#x27;attaque&quot;&#x27;, or attack column, consisting of one regiment up to two brigades of infantry. Instead of advancing slowly all across the battlefield in line formations, the French infantry were brought forward in such columns, preceded by masses of skirmishers to cover and mask their advance. The column would then normally deploy into line right before engaging the enemy with either fire or bayonet. This allowed the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic infantry a much greater degree of mobility compared to their &quot;Ancien Régime&quot; opponents, and also allowed much closer cooperation of infantry with cavalry and artillery, which were free to move in between the infantry columns of the former rather than being trapped in between the linear formation of the latter. The &quot;colonne d&#x27;attaque&quot; was henceforth adopted by all European armies during and after the Napoleonic Wars. While some British historians, such as Sir Charles Oman, have postulated that it was the standard French tactic to charge enemy lines of infantry head on with their columns, relying on the morale effect of the huge column, and hence were often beaten off by the devastating firepower of the redcoats, more current research into the subject has revealed that such occasions were far from the norm, and that the French normally tried deploying into lines before combat as well.

<text>Coining is a form of precision stamping in which a workpiece is subjected to a sufficiently high stress to induce plastic flow on the surface of the material. A beneficial feature is that in some metals, the plastic flow reduces surface grain size, and work hardens the surface, while the material deeper in the part retains its toughness and ductility. The term comes from the initial use of the process: manufacturing of coins.

Coining is used to manufacture parts for all industries and is commonly used when high relief or very fine features are required. For example, it is used to produce coins, badges, buttons, precision-energy springs and precision parts with small or polished surface features.

Coining is a cold working process similar in other respects to forging, which takes place at elevated temperature; it uses a great deal of force to elastically deform a workpiece, so that it conforms to a die. Coining can be done using a gear driven press, a mechanical press, or more commonly, a hydraulically actuated press. Coining typically requires higher tonnage presses than stamping, because the workpiece is elastically deformed and not actually cut, as in some other forms of stamping. The coining process is preferred when there is a high tonnage. 

==Coining for currency==
==Coining in electronic industry==

In soldering of electronic components, bumps are formed on bonding pads to enhance adhesion, which are further flattened by the coining process. Unlike typical coining applications, in this case the goal of coining is to create a flat, rather than patterned, surface.

<text>Julius Knipl, Real Estate Photographer was a weekly comic strip written and drawn by Ben Katchor from 1988 to 1998. It was first published in &quot;The New York Press&quot; and subsequently self-syndicated to various alternative weekly newspapers including &quot;The Washington DC City Paper,&quot; &quot;Chicago NewCity,&quot; &quot;Philadelphia City Paper,&quot; &quot;San Francisco Weekly,&quot; &quot;The Forward (English-language),&quot; &quot;The Village Voice&quot; and others.

Katchor embodies his love of the fading small-business community in an imaginary East Coast city in the title character, a small businessman who wanders the streets taking pictures and being sidetracked into surreal escapades. Strips often depict Knipl&#x27;s chance encounters with obscure, marginal businesses (e.g. a company that distributes newspaper weights to newsstands), eccentric hobbyists, and enigmatic details of the urban landscape. There is rarely continuity between the strips, and Knipl is the only recurring character.

A collection of &quot;Julius Knipl&quot; strips was published in 1991 by Penguin Books (as a &quot;RAW&quot; One-Shot) as &quot;Cheap Novelties: The Pleasures of Urban Decay&quot;. Another collection was published in 1996 by Little, Brown and Company under the title &quot;Julius Knipl, Real Estate Photographer: Stories&quot;. Pantheon Books published a third volume of strips, &quot;The Beauty Supply District&quot;, in 2000. Each book includes one long story in addition to the self-contained weekly strips. Translated collections of the strip in French and Japanese have also been released.

NPR&#x27;s &quot;Weekend Edition&quot; Saturday ran audio versions of several Julius Knipl stories in 1995 and 1996, narrated by Katchor and starring Jerry Stiller in the title role.
The word &quot;knipl&quot; means roughly &quot;nest egg&quot; or housewife hidden savings in Yiddish.

==Publication==
In 1988 publisher Russ Smith approached &quot;Raw&quot; co-editor Art Spiegelman about comic strips for the weekly alternative newspaper &quot;New York Press&quot;. Spiegelman recommended Katchor, whom he had published in &quot;Raw&quot;. Katchor has since produced the strip weekly, and it has been carried by other alternative weeklies as well, such as &quot;The Forward&quot; and &quot;The Village Voice&quot;.

When the &quot;Village Voice&quot; canceled the strip in 1995, Katchor set up an illuminated &quot;Julius Knipl Reading Box&quot; for the public to read his new installments, on display in the window of a B&amp;H Dairy or outside his neighborhood Papaya King.

Strips from the series have appeared in the collections &quot;Cheap Novelties: The Pleasures of Urban Decay&quot; (1991), &quot;Julius Knipl, Real Estate Photographer: Stories&quot; (1996), &quot;Julius Knipl, Real Estate Photographer: The Beauty Supply&quot; (2000).

==Style and analysis==
Katchor draws the strip in a loose, sketchy pen-and-ink style overlaid with a gray watercolor wash. The backgrounds are detailed and drawn from a wide variety of shifting perspectives. A typical strip is made up of eight or nine panels captioned with crooked, hand-lettered boxes. The captions and drawings often follow independent narrative threads, sometimes with ironic effects, with the captions contradicting or reinforcing the visuals.

The dreamlike strip displays a nostalgic tone for an imaginary East Coast city, and its working class, immigrant population in particular. The strip&#x27;s city is populated with small businesses that had never existed and that are often implausible, but reminiscent of a New York in the days of large numbers of immigrants before the dominance of large corporate chains.

<text>Huntley Ashworth Gordon (October 8, 1879 – December 7, 1956) was a Canadian actor who began his career in the Silent Film era.

==Profile==

Gordon was born in Montreal, Quebec, and educated in both Canada and England. He had various jobs including working in a bank, in a silver mine, contracting, as a commercial traveller, and being a cigarette factory owner before settling on the stage and at one time acted with Ethel Barrymore. His Broadway credits included &quot;Life&quot; (1914) and &quot;Our Mrs. McChesney&quot; (1915).

He began his screen career in 1916 when given a chance by Thomas Ince. Gordon was once a model for Arrow Collars; he was once painted by American commercial illustrator J. C. Leyendecker.

He served in the Canadian Army during World War I and began a career in motion pictures in England where he had been stationed during the war. With his suave manner and classic good looks he was sought out in Hollywood, California where he acted in both silent and talking films.

In Hollywood, he appeared in numerous films including starring opposite Gloria Swanson in the 1923 film &quot;Bluebeard&#x27;s 8th Wife&quot;. That same year he starred in &quot;The Wanters&quot; with Norma Shearer and Marie Prevost.

For most of his career, Gordon traveled between America and Britain, making films in both countries, appearing in more than 120 films. He was with MGM studios when he retired from film in 1940 and invested in the manufacture of silk stockings, a lucrative business at a time when Canadian and British women could not get them due to the rationing brought on by the Second World War. Although he no longer made motion pictures, Huntley Gordon remained active in the world of network radio.

Gordon died of a heart attack in Van Nuys, California, and was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

<text>A sweater (North American English) or pullover, also called a [[Jersey (clothing)|jersey]] or jumper (British English, Hiberno-English and Australian English), is a piece of clothing, typically with long sleeves, made of knitted or crocheted material that covers the upper part of the body. When sleeveless, the garment is often called a slipover, tank top, or [[sweater vest]]. 

Sweaters are worn by adults and children, often over a shirt, blouse, T-shirt, or another top, but sometimes next to the skin. Sweaters were traditionally made from wool but can now be made of cotton, synthetic fibers, or any combination of these. There are also seasonal sweaters, which around Christmas are often called &quot;ugly sweaters&quot;.

== Etymology ==
According to British dictionaries, &quot;sweater&quot; is used in British English in the same sense as in American English but &quot;jumper&quot; is commonly used instead (though some say that &quot;sweater&quot; is used for heavier ones worn for warmth). The Oxford English Dictionary states that in British usage, sweaters are always pulled over the head and jumpers are not necessarily, whereas most or all other British dictionaries disagree and say that sweaters are not necessarily pullovers or even say that jumpers are always pullovers, i.e. never open in front.

The Oxford English Dictionary gives &quot;sweater&quot; as appearing in 1882 and gives its definition as &quot;A woolen vest or jersey worn in rowing or other athletic exercises, originally... to reduce one&#x27;s weight; now commonly put on also before or after exercise to prevent taking cold. Hence a similar garment for general informal wear; a jumper or pullover&quot;

According to most British dictionaries, British usage agrees with what American dictionaries describe as American English usage, according to which a sweater is either a pullover or a cardigan (which opens at the front). Almost all British dictionaries include cardigans as a type of sweater but at least one includes cardigans as a type of jumper (i.e. most British dictionaries consider &quot;sweater&quot; – and at least one considers &quot;jumper&quot; – to be a hypernym for both pullovers and cardigans). Colloquial and informal usage common in Britain is using the term “cardie” for a cardigan which usually refers to a button-front sweater.

==Types and design==
The term &quot;sweater&quot; is a catch-all for a variety of knit garments. Although the term often refers to a pullover, it can also refer to a cardigan, a garment that opens and fastens down the front. Within either group, there is a great variety of designs. Various necklines are found, although the V-neck, turtleneck, and crew neck are the most popular. The hemline is typically at hip height or slightly longer, just overlapping the waist of one&#x27;s pants or skirt, but can vary significantly. It can range from just below the bust in women&#x27;s garments to mid-thigh in either sex or even longer in a knitted variation of the poncho shirtdress. The sleeve length is also variable, ranging from full-length or three-quarters to short-sleeved, cap sleeves or sleeveless. The front seam or opening of a cardigan allows for further different styles, such as a surplice or a bolero jacket. All hems may have various types of borders, such as picots, ribbing, and frills.

Knitted fabrics are generally somewhat elastic and have a softer hand (feel or drape) than woven fabric. Sweaters that are more tightly fitted or have a soft drape may conform well to the body without requiring tailoring necessary in a woven garment such as darts, flares, and gores. Even when such shaping is used, it can be knit into the fabric itself, without requiring seams.

Another type is a sweater vest.

==Nomenclature==

A sweater with an open front fastened by buttons or a zipper is generally called a cardigan, but the nomenclature for other styles in different dialects can be quite confusing. In British English, a sweater may also be called a pullover, jumper, or jersey. In the United States, however, &quot;jumper&quot; refers to a style of women&#x27;s sleeveless dress, worn over a blouse or shirt, and &quot;jersey&quot; refers to a knit shirt, especially if part of an athletic uniform. If sleeveless, such a garment may be called a &quot;slipover&quot; or &quot;tank top&quot; in British English, while &quot;tank top&quot; in US English refers to a sleeveless shirt or undershirt.

In the U.S. a sleeveless sweater may also be called a sweater vest, especially if it has a V-neck and somewhat formal appearance resembling a formal vest, a garment known as a waistcoat in the UK. In British English, &quot;vest&quot; refers to an undershirt. In South African English, a knitted sweater is always called a jersey, while &quot;sweater&quot;, when used, refers to a &quot;sweatshirt&quot;. In the sport of ice hockey, the top of a hockey player&#x27;s uniform had traditionally been a sweater; and even though modern hockey uniform tops are more commonly a jersey they are typically referred to as a &quot;hockey sweater,&quot; regardless of the style, but frequently, in the U.S. it is called a hockey &quot;jersey&quot;.

==Customary wear==

Thin sweaters may be worn tucked into the waistband of trousers; but otherwise, men&#x27;s sweaters are worn untucked. Nonetheless, some individuals, including some television and film actors, have been known for wearing tucked-in sweaters.

Sweaters are a versatile item of clothing and can be worn on top of almost any outfit. Sports sweaters are often worn on tops of sports kit while traveling to or from a sports ground. Sweaters can be worn with a dress shirt underneath (and optionally a tie), which has the advantage of allowing the wearer to have the option of removing the sweater when it is uncomfortably warm and still looking presentable in many situations. Layering and the ease with which it allows for temperature regulation is a major benefit of the sweater as an article of clothing. Various methods have evolved for conveniently carrying a sweater, once removed. The three most common approaches are: around the waist (either loin cloth or knotted in front style) and over the shoulder.

In the late 20th century, the sweater increasingly came to be worn as an alternative to a shirt when finer materials made them more comfortable next to the skin.

Some people enjoy wearing Christmas-related sweaters around Christmas time to get into the festive spirit. 
Some women&#x27;s sweaters are meant to be worn belted; a belt or drawstring is sometimes knitted into the sweater itself. Leggings are commonly worn with long sweaters or sweater dresses.

==Care==
Sweaters are often maintained by washing or dry cleaning and the use of a lint roller or pill razor. But airing (and rinsing in pure water if necessary) is considered better than washing with soap or another detergent, especially when not all of the natural oil (lanolin) has been removed from the wool. The use of detergent is in fact detrimental because it removes the lanolin, which helps the wool to repel and shed dirt as well as water. In fact, sweaters made from unscoured wool, such as some Irish Aran jumpers, remain wearable even when wet.

==Ice hockey==
The uniforms that present-day ice hockey players wear are referred to as &quot;sweaters&quot;. This is because original uniforms were simply sweaters with the team&#x27;s crest stitched on the front. However, as technology changed, so did the uniforms as actual sweaters absorbed too much moisture and became weighed down and cumbersome throughout the course of a game.

<doc id="185338" wikidata="Q3021400" url="?curid=185338" title="Del Lord">
<text>Delmer &quot;Del&quot; Lord (October 7, 1894March 23, 1970) was a Canadian film director and actor best known as a director of Three Stooges films.

==Career==
Delmer Lord was born in the small town of Grimsby, Ontario, Canada. Interested in the theatre, he traveled to New York City, then when fellow Canadian Mack Sennett offered him a job at his new Keystone Studios, Lord went on to work in Hollywood, California. There he played the driver of the Keystone Cops police van, appearing in many of the Cops&#x27; successful films.

Given a chance to direct, Del Lord became a specialist in automotive gags, rigging cars to explode, crash, fall apart, or dangle in precarious positions. Lord was responsible for a number of very successful comedies for Keystone and directed two feature films for Universal Pictures. However, the Great Depression plagued the film industry with budget cuts, and Sennett was forced to close his studio in 1933. Hal Roach launched a brief series of slapstick comedies with &quot;The Taxi Boys&quot; (Clyde Cook, Billy Gilbert, Billy Bevan, and other expressive comedians), and these films required outlandish visual gags and a fleet of crazy cars. Del Lord was the ideal man to direct, and he worked on these comedies exclusively for a year. After leaving Roach, Lord joined producer Phil Ryan&#x27;s short-comedy unit at Paramount Pictures. During the summer of 1934 Lord took a job selling used cars at a relative&#x27;s automobile agency. Producer Jules White, shopping for a Buick, encountered Lord at the agency and hired him to work at Columbia Pictures.

From 1935 to 1945, Lord directed some of Columbia&#x27;s fastest and funniest two-reelers and is credited with developing the unique comic style of the Three Stooges. In addition to more than three dozen Stooges films, he directed or co-produced more than 200 motion pictures. 

In 1936 a Canadian law required that American studios would have to release a certain quota of Canadian-made films in order to distribute their own Hollywood productions in Canada. Columbia, anxious to exert some control over the quality of the films, sent some of its actors and crew members to Canada, including its Canadian-born employees. Del Lord made one feature film there, &quot;What Price Vengeance&quot; (1937).

Columbia promoted Lord to feature films in 1944. Curiously, most of Lord&#x27;s Columbia features are action melodramas rather than slapstick comedies; he may have gotten these assignments based on his handling of his one previous Columbia feature, &quot;What Price Vengeance&quot;.

In 1945 Monogram Pictures announced that Del Lord would produce and direct its feature-length musical &quot;Swing Parade of 1946&quot;, which would feature the Three Stooges. Lord withdrew from the project, and Monogram assigned him to a Bowery Boys comedy, &quot;In Fast Company&quot; (1946). 

In 1946 comedy star Hugh Herbert, then working in Columbia&#x27;s short comedies, clashed with director Edward Bernds and refused to work with Bernds any longer. Producer Hugh McCollum asked Del Lord to return temporarily to the studio&#x27;s short-subjects department, where he directed eight comedies with Herbert and one with the Stooges. In 1952 Lord directed Buster Keaton in an industrial featurette, &quot;A Paradise for Buster&quot;. Del Lord can be seen in an episode of TV&#x27;s &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, honoring Lord&#x27;s old boss Mack Sennett.

==Death==
Del Lord died on March 23, 1970, in Calabasas, California, and is interred in the Olivewood Memorial Park, in Riverside, California.

==In popular culture==
Two rock bands took their names from the Stooges&#x27; frequently credited director: the Del-Lourds of New Jersey (1963) and The Del-Lords of New York City (1983-90 and 2010-13).

<text>Sidney Olcott (born John Sidney Allcott; September 20, 1872 – December 16, 1949) was a Canadian-born film producer, director, actor and screenwriter.
==Biography==
Born John Sidney Allcott in Toronto, he became one of the first great directors of the motion picture business. With a desire to be an actor, a young Sidney Olcott went to New York City where he worked in the theatre until 1904 when he performed as a film actor with the Biograph Studios.

In 1907, Frank J. Marion and Samuel Long, with financial backing from George Kleine, formed a new motion picture company called the Kalem Company and were able to lure the increasingly successful Olcott away from Biograph. Olcott was offered the sum of ten dollars per picture and under the terms of his contract, Olcott was required to direct a minimum of one, one-reel picture of about a thousand feet every week. After making a number of very successful films for the Kalem studio, including &quot;Ben Hur&quot; (1907) with its dramatic chariot race scene, and &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; (1908),

Olcott became the company&#x27;s president and was rewarded with one share of its stock. In 1910, Olcott went to Ireland where he made a film called &quot;A Lad from Old Ireland&quot;. He would go on to make more than a dozen films there and later on only the outbreak of World War I prevented him from following through with his plans to build a permanent studio in Beaufort, County Kerry, Ireland. The Irish films led to him taking a crew to Palestine in 1912 to make the first five-reel film ever, titled &quot;From the Manger to the Cross&quot;, the life story of Jesus.

The film concept was at first the subject of much scepticism but when it appeared on screen, it was lauded by the public and the critics. Costing $35,000 to produce, &quot;From the Manger to the Cross&quot; earned the Kalem Company profits of almost $1 million, a staggering amount in 1912. The motion picture industry acclaimed him as its greatest director and the film influenced the direction many great filmmakers would take such as D.W. Griffith and Cecil B. DeMille. &quot;From the Manger to the Cross&quot; is still shown today to film societies and students studying early film making techniques. In 1998, the film was selected for the National Film Registry of the United States Library of Congress.

Despite making the studio owners very rich men, they refused to increase his salary beyond the $150 a week he was then earning. From the enormous profits made for his employers, Olcott&#x27;s dividend on the one share they had given him amounted to $350. As a result, Olcott resigned and took some time off, making only an occasional film until 1915 when he was encouraged by Mary Pickford to join her at Famous Players–Lasky, later Paramount Pictures. The Kalem Company never recovered from the mistake of losing Olcott and a few years after his departure, the operation was acquired by Vitagraph Studios in 1916.

Olcott was a founding member of the East Coast chapter of the Motion Picture Directors Association, a forerunner to today&#x27;s Directors Guild of America and would later serve as its president. Olcott married actress Valentine Grant, the star of his 1916 film, &quot;The Innocent Lie&quot;.

During World War II, Olcott opened his home to visiting British Commonwealth soldiers in Los Angeles. In his book titled &quot;Stardust and Shadows: Canadians in Early Hollywood&quot;, writer Charles Foster tells of this period in Olcott&#x27;s life, and of how he was introduced to many members of Hollywood&#x27;s Canadian community through Olcott. Olcott died in Hollywood, California, in the house of his friend Robert Vignola where he lived after the death of Valentine Grant. Wanting to be buried in Canada, he is buried in Park Lawn cemetery in Toronto, Ontario.

<text>Cannock Chase, often referred to locally as The Chase, is a mixed area of countryside in the county of Staffordshire, England. The area has been designated as the Cannock Chase National Landscape, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and much of it is managed by Forestry England for its important ecology and for recreational use. The Chase gives its name to the Cannock Chase local government district. It is a former Royal forest.

== Geology ==
With the exception of the southeastern area, the Chase is almost wholly underlain by sandstones and conglomerates of the Chester Formation dating from the Triassic period. Formerly known as the Cannock Chase Formation, these form a part of the Sherwood Sandstone Group. Overlying these rocks in the Rugeley area are the, often pebbly, sandstones of the Helsby Sandstone Formation, formerly referred to in this area as the Bromsgrove Sandstone. Older literature will often refer to the bunter sandstone, a name which geologists no longer apply to the New Red Sandstone of Britain. Southeast of Rugeley Road the bedrock is provided by the mudstones, siltstones and sandstones of the Pennine Middle Coal Measures Formation, a succession dating from the end of the Carboniferous period, and which is separated from the overlying New Red Sandstone rocks by an unconformity. The Hednesford Hills are formed by the Chester Formation sandstones.

A &#x27;humped profile&#x27; dry valley running west–east, and followed by the bridleway between Brocton and Beggar&#x27;s Hill is interpreted as a glacial overflow channel, operative during the ice age. An expanse of glacial till underlies Haywood Warren with smaller patches mapped elsewhere. Sand and gravel have been quarried in different parts of the Chase over the years, as at Wolseley today.

==Landscape, flora and fauna==
The Chase is located between Hednesford, Huntington, Lichfield, Rugeley, Brocton, Milford and Stafford. It comprises a mixture of natural deciduous woodland, coniferous plantations, open heathland, small lakes and the remains of early industry, such as coal mining. The Chase was designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) on 16 September 1958 and is the smallest area so designated in mainland Britain, covering . Much of the area is also designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Despite being relatively small in area, the chase provides a remarkable range of landscape and wildlife, including a herd of around 800 fallow deer and a number of rare and endangered birds, including migrant nightjars.

Efforts are underway to increase the amount of heathland on the chase, reintroducing shrubs such as heather in some areas where bracken and birch forest have crowded out most other plants. The local flora also includes several species of &quot;Vaccinium&quot;, including the eponymous Cannock Chase berry (&quot;Vaccinium × intermedium&quot; Ruthe). In January 2009, an outbreak of the plant pathogen &quot;Phytophthora ramorum&quot; was discovered on the chase, at Brocton Coppice. Various restrictions were put in place in an attempt to prevent its spread.

==Recreation==
The chase is an important local amenity for recreation, with 58% of the National Landscape area publicly accessible, and several visitor attractions lie within it. While only around 10,000 people live within the National Landscape area itself, 135,000 people live within a 30 minute walk of the area, and 3.2 million people live within a one hour drive of the area. It received an estimated 2.3 million visitors in 2010-11.

===Visitor sites and landmarks===

There are a number of visitor centres, museums and waymarked paths, including the Heart of England Way and the Staffordshire Way. There are also accessible trails to enable people to experience the health benefits of the Chase, such as The Route to Health. Additionally, there are many unmarked public paths. On the north-eastern edge of the Chase can be found Shugborough Hall, ancestral home of the Earls of Lichfield. At its southern edge are the remains of Castle Ring, an Iron Age hill fort, which at is the highest point on the Chase. Several glacial erratic boulders are also found on the Chase, remnants of glaciation. One is mounted on a plinth.

The Chase has several war memorials, including German and Commonwealth war cemeteries. A memorial to the victims of the Katyn massacre was unveiled by Stefan Staniszewski, whose father Hillary, Zygmunt Staniszewski, died in the massacre. Preserved below the memorial are phials of soil from both Warsaw and the Katyn forest. Freda, the Harlequin Great Dane mascot of the New Zealand Rifle Brigade (Earl of Liverpool&#x27;s Own) is also buried on the chase marked with a memorial marble headstone.

===Mountain biking===
The Chase is popular with cross-country mountain bike users. The purpose-built XC &#x27;Follow the Dog&#x27; trail is an technically challenging route, opened in 2005, starting and finishing at the Birches Valley Visitors/Cycle Centre. It is open to all; however, it is not recommended for beginners. A new section of XC trail was opened in April 2010. The &#x27;Monkey Trail&#x27; () is a more technical trail that splits from &#x27;Follow the Dog&#x27; at about the halfway point, then rejoins slightly further on. There are several features mountain bikers can look out for when riding on the chase, such as Kitbag Hill, Rabbit Hill, Quagmire Bridge, Roots Hall and Brocton Shorts.

Increasing popularity of the MTB trails led Network Rail to install a cycle bridge in 2013 at Moors Gorse to replace the previous pedestrian level crossing where multiple near misses indicated a high risk to cyclists.

===Entertainment===
Since 2006, the forest has been used as an open-air music venue as part of the Forestry England nationwide Forest Live, with acts such as The Zutons, The Feeling, Status Quo and Jools Holland playing in a forest clearing. Also contained within the chase is Hednesford Hills Raceway a historic venue that frequently hosts Stock Car Racing and Banger Racing

==History and archaeology==
===Model WW I battlefield===
A model World War I battlefield was constructed near Brocton by German prisoners of war held in a camp on nearby Cannock Chase and guarded by soldiers of the New Zealand Rifle Brigade. The model was of the village and surrounding area of Messines in Belgium, which included replica trenches and dugouts, railway lines, roads, and accurate contours of the surrounding terrain.

In September 2013 Staffordshire County Council allowed a team of local archaeologists and volunteers to excavate the well-preserved battlefield, revealing many new details. Staffordshire County Council used laser-scanning technology to recreate the site as a 3D interactive model that can be explored online. The model was open to public view for a few weeks before being buried again to ensure its preservation.

=== The Chase Through Time ===
The Chase Through Time project (2016–18) explored two thousand years of the history of the landscape of Cannock Chase AONB. It was a partnership between Staffordshire County Council, Historic England and the Heritage Lottery Fund.

An archaeological survey using lidar which enabled researchers to see beneath trees coverage, and map usually unseen archaeological features in combination with historic aerial photographs, which illustrated changes to the landscape over the last 70 years. The project mapped archaeology from prehistoric burnt mounds, medieval and later coal mining, post medieval land division showing the early land management of the Chase, and aspects of the landscape&#x27;s use in the First World War. 565 archaeological sites were mapped, with 436 of these sites new to the record.

===Cannock Chase murders===
The area gained notoriety in the late 1960s when the Cannock Chase murders made national headlines. The remains of three young girls were found on the Chase after going missing from areas along the A34 road between there and Birmingham. Raymond Leslie Morris, a motor engineer from Walsall, was found guilty at Stafford assizes of one of the murders in 1968 and was sentenced to life imprisonment. He died in prison in March 2014, aged 84, after serving 45 years.

==In popular culture==
Since the 1970s, sightings of Black Eyed Kids, Black Dogs, Werewolves, British big cats, UFOs, and even Bigfoot have been reported in the local press. However no conclusive evidence has ever been produced verifying these claims, and they may best be thought of as forming part of local folklore.

The 1972 Labi Siffre album &quot;Crying Laughing Loving Lying&quot; features a track, written on Cannock Chase, and named after it.

<doc id="185342" wikidata="Q7504671" url="?curid=185342" title="Shugborough Hall">
<text>Shugborough Hall is a stately home near Great Haywood, Staffordshire, England.

The hall is situated on the edge of Cannock Chase, about east of Stafford and from Rugeley. The estate was owned by the Bishops of Lichfield until the dissolution of the monasteries, upon which it passed through several hands before being purchased in 1624 by William Anson, a local lawyer and ancestor of the Earls of Lichfield. The estate remained in the Anson family for three centuries. Following the death of the 4th Earl of Lichfield in 1960, the estate was allocated to the National Trust in lieu of death duties, and then immediately leased to Staffordshire County Council. Management of the estate was returned to the National Trust in 2016. It is open to the public and comprises the hall, museum, kitchen garden and a model farm.

==History==

The Shugborough estate was owned by the Bishops of Lichfield until the dissolution of the monasteries around 1540, and thereafter passed through several hands, until it was purchased in 1624 by William Anson (c.1580–1644), a lawyer, of Dunston, Staffordshire for £1,000. In 1693, William Anson&#x27;s grandson, also called William (1656–1720), demolished the existing manor house and constructed a three-story building which still forms the central part of the hall.

William&#x27;s elder son, Thomas Anson MP (1695-1773), would further extend the house in the 1740s, adding two pavilions flanking either side of the central block. It was Thomas&#x27;s younger brother, however, who would fund these changes; Admiral George Anson, created Lord Anson in 1747 and First Lord of the Admiralty in 1751, amassed a great fortune during his naval career, and when he died without issue he left the majority to his elder brother. Thomas also died childless and the estate passed to his sister&#x27;s son, George Adams, who adopted the surname Anson by royal licence.

In 1806, George&#x27;s son Thomas (1767–1818) was created 1st Viscount Anson. His son, the 2nd viscount, would be created 1st Earl of Lichfield in the 1831 Coronation Honours. The Earl led an extravagant lifestyle and amassed several large debts, which, in 1842, forced him to sell the entire contents of the house in a two-week-long sale. While Thomas George Anson, 2nd Earl of Lichfield did much to restore the house and contents to its former glory, by the time his son inherited the estate it was heavily mortgaged.

In 1831, Princess Alexandrina Victoria of Kent, the future Queen Victoria, then 13, visited Shugborough with her mother, the Duchess of Kent, as part of an extensive tour of the country. The young princess stayed with many local landowners at the time, including John Talbot, 16th Earl of Shrewsbury.
Passing from east to west through the southern part of the park is the Trent Valley Line, planned in 1845. The railway runs underground in the Shugborough Tunnel and therefore has minimal visual impact. The tunnel entrances, which are listed grade II, are highly decorated, in particular the western approach which dates from 1847. The drive to the hall is carried over the tunnel by a bridge, about north-west of the Lichfield Lodge, which also dates from 1847 and also listed at grade II. The double-track line is part of the West Coast Main Line, running north-west between Colwich Junction and Stafford.

===Late 20th century and today===
Following the death of the 4th Earl in 1960, an agreement was reached whereby the estate would pass to the National Trust in lieu of death duties. The deal was finalised and the house opened to the public in 1966. The estate was immediately leased to Staffordshire County Council, who managed and maintained it on behalf of the National Trust, with Patrick Anson, 5th Earl of Lichfield retaining an apartment in the hall until his death in 2005, paying a nominal rent to the new owners. His successor, the 6th Earl, decided to relinquish the lease of the apartments, thus severing the family&#x27;s direct links with the estate.

In 2016 Staffordshire County Council handed the estate back to the National Trust, with 49 years remaining on its lease. The move is expect to save the council £35 million, with the Trust intending to renew investment in the property.
The grounds and mansion house are open to the public. The attraction is marketed as &quot;The Complete Working Historic Estate&quot;, which includes a working model farm museum dating from 1805 complete with a working watermill, kitchens, a dairy, a tea room, and rare breeds of farm animals. Originally restored in 1990, the estate&#x27;s brewery is England&#x27;s only log-fired brewery that still produces beer commercially. Previously used only on special occasions, the brewhouse has been a working exhibit since 2007, operated by Titanic Brewery.

Since 2011 the private apartments have housed an exhibition of the work of Patrick Lichfield. His cameras and lighting gear have been set up in a recreation of his studio, and there is a gallery of some of his most famous photographic subjects.

==Architecture==
===Interior===
====The state rooms====
The state rooms at Shugborough Hall include The State Dining Room, The Red Drawing Room, The Library, The Saloon, The Verandah Room, The Anson Room and The State Bedroom. These contain some of the most opulent and highly decorated interiors in the hall.

The Verandah Room contains a 208-piece porcelain dinner service commissioned to commemorate Admiral Anson&#x27;s circumnavigation of the globe in HMS &quot;Centurion&quot;. The dinner service was offered to Admiral Anson in gratitude for assisting in fighting the huge fires that were destroying the merchant district in Canton. (Story narrated by Shugborough guide October 2015). The State Bedroom overlooks the terrace and was occupied by Queen Victoria during her childhood visit.

====Private apartments====
The private apartments were the living quarters of 5th Earl and his family until 2010. The Boudoir, with its silver gilt wallpaper, is the only room in the hall with hand-painted ceilings with gold detailing. Other rooms include The Lilac and Yellow Bedrooms, The Sitting Room and the completely circular Breakfast Room.

===Exterior===
In about 1693, William Anson (1656–1720) demolished the old house and created a new mansion. The entrance front, then facing to the west, comprised a balustraded, three-storey, seven-bayed central block. In about 1748 his great-grandson Thomas Anson (1767–1818) commissioned architect Thomas Wright to remodel the house, which was extended with flanking two-storey, three-bayed pavilions linked to the central block by pedimented passages.

At the turn of the 19th century, the house was further altered and extended by architect Samuel Wyatt. The pavilions and passages were incorporated into the main building, and a new porticoed entrance front with ten Ionic pillars was created at the east. These pillars resemble carved stone but are hollow timber structures. This was done for Thomas Anson, 1st Viscount Anson and his wife Anne Margaret Coke, daughter of Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester, whom he married in 1794. The hall, as it is seen today, is built in a neo-classical style and encased in slate, sanded to resemble stone.

===The park and follies===
Like many landowners of his time, Thomas Anson (1695–1773) took a keen interest in the landscaping of his parkland. The land around Shugborough was largely flat, which ensured that trees, follies and water would play an important role in shaping the landscape. The grounds contain a number of follies, many of which, such as The Chinese House and two Chinese-style bridges, have a Chinese theme, in honour of Admiral George Anson. Admiral Anson, who had visited Canton, left a considerable sum of money to his brother Thomas Anson when he died, which was used to develop the hall and estate. The Chinese House and the red iron footbridge are both grade I listed.

In 1760, Classical architect James Stuart was employed to design a number of monuments. Stuart had visited Athens in the early 1750s, and Ancient Greek influences are obvious at Shugborough. Stuart designed for Anson a copy of the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates and a grade I listed triumphal arch based on the Arch of Hadrian in Athens.

====The Shepherd&#x27;s Monument====
The Shepherd&#x27;s Monument is a stone and marble folly within the grounds of Shugborough hall, engraved with the inscriptions &quot;O.U.O.S.V.A.V.V&quot; and &quot;D.M.&quot;. The monument has been internationally well-known since 1982, when the book &quot;The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail&quot; drew attention to the mysterious Shugborough inscription. Carved by Peter Scheemakers, theories have abounded, including some which suggest it may indicate the whereabouts of the Holy Grail.

<text>The Rhein-Erft-Kreis () is a district in the west of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Neighboring districts are Neuss, district-free Cologne, Rhein-Sieg, Euskirchen, Düren.

==History==

The district in its current borders was created in 1975, when the previous districts Bergheim and Cologne were merged. On 1 November 2003 the district was renamed from &quot;Erftkreis&quot; to &quot;Rhein-Erft-Kreis&quot;.
==Geography==
The main river in the district is the Erft, which also gave it the name. The Erft flows through the foothills of the Eifel, on the left side of the Rhine river. The lake Bleibtreusee is located within the district.

===Towns===

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms shows the lion of Jülich in the left half, as most of the area belonged to the duchy of Jülich. The right side shows the Cologne cross, which stands for the former Cologne district. On top the Erft river is depicted; the Prussian Rhine Province had the same symbol in its coat of arms.

<text>Castle Ring is an Iron Age hill fort, situated high up on the southern edge of Cannock Chase (The Chase), Staffordshire, England.

It is the highest point on The Chase with an elevation of .

It is near the village of Cannock Wood, south of Rugeley and north of Burntwood, adjacent to the Heart of England Way. There are excellent views over The Chase, the Trent Valley and Staffordshire more generally.

The public are free to walk around it as there is a path.

==History==
Castle Ring is thought to have first been occupied 500BCE by an Ancient British (Celtic) tribe named the Cornovii. It was abandoned 43CE as a consequence of Romans occupying the area.

Apart from perimeter earthworks, little remains visible. Parts of the ground in the ring appear to have been ploughed, but there is no consensus as to whether this was carried out in prehistoric times, or in the medieval period, when a hunting lodge was also built in the ring. The remains of this lodge are still visible.

Poy was an early proponent of changing the lyrics of Canada&#x27;s National Anthem to more inclusive wording by changing the line &quot;in all thy sons command&quot; to &quot;in all of us command. Her argument centered around the fact that the proposed wording was the original lyric after having been changed to &quot;sons&quot; during the First World War in order to encourage young men to enlist.

With a $8.9 billion revenue in 2022 (a 39% increase over the previous high in 2019), tourism has been a very important source of revenue for Puerto Rico for a number of decades given its favorable warm climate, beach destinations and its diversity of natural wonders, cultural and historical sites, festivals, concerts and sporting events. As Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory of the United States, U.S. citizens do not need a passport to enter Puerto Rico, and the ease of travel attracts many tourists from the mainland U.S. each year.

In 2017, Hurricane Maria caused severe damage to the island and its infrastructure. The damage was estimated at $100 billion. An April 2019 report indicated that by that time, only a few hotels were still closed, that life for tourists in and around the capital had, for the most part, returned to normal. By October 2019, nearly all of the popular amenities for tourists, in the major destinations such as San Juan, Ponce and Arecibo, were in operation on the island and tourism was rebounding. This was important for the economy, since tourism provides up 10% of Puerto Rico&#x27;s GDP, according to Discover Puerto Rico. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, however, greatly affected this gradual recovery, and it was not until 2022 that tourism numbers would demonstrate a concrete recovery of the tourism industry in the island.

==History==

The inauguration of the Condado Vanderbilt Hotel on 16 October 1919 marked the beginning of upscale tourism in Puerto Rico. According to Dennis Merrill, author of &quot;Negotiating Cold War Paradise: U.S. Tourism, Economic Planning, and Cultural Modernity in Twentieth-Century Puerto Rico&quot;, the tourism industry in the Caribbean is viewed by its critics as causing host countries to practice economic subservience to the visitors of the islands. He highlights the U.S. attempt in the 1930s to make Puerto Rico an island destination for tourists to bring in a new source of revenue to the U.S. and help lift it out of economic depression. Travel guides and advertisements used at the time suggested that the people of Puerto Rico lived in poverty and wanted a chance to serve travelers from the United States.

The creation of the Caribe Hilton Hotel in San Juan in 1949 represented a partnership between the Puerto Rican government and private U.S businesses. American business viewed the creation of the hotel as a symbol of their power to create material progress. A majority of Puerto Rican citizens did not approve of the decision to build the hotel as they believed that the public funds would have better suited the island inhabitants if they were invested in improving education and social welfare. San Juan&#x27;s fire chief of the time disapproved the local government&#x27;s decision to &quot;degrade itself by buying tourists&quot;. Articles published by &quot;El Mundo&quot; in 1952 described American tourists as &quot;selfish people who did not care about the island and ones who will in the future convince the Puerto Rican people to serve them&quot;. In addition to beach holidays, gambling and casinos were some of the first tourist activities that were developed in the island. The gambling sector is also an important contributor to the tourism sector (employing 3,409 people, 2017 ), and it encompasses 20 casinos all attached to hotels and resorts acting as tourist destinations. It is mandatory, according to Puerto Rican law, that casinos must be attached to hotels and resorts, and must be located within &quot;zones of historic or touristic interest&quot; (Spanish: &quot;zonas históricas, antiguas o de interés turístico&quot;). Today there is a significant and growing Chinese presence in the Puerto Rico gambling sector, so far 10% of the casinos are owned by Chinese individuals or companies, and more are partially owned. The number of Chinese tourists is also on the rise: in 2019, contribution of travel and tourism to GDP (% of GDP) for Puerto Rico was 6.9%. However, the exact contribution of the gambling sector within the tourism and travel sector is not measured separately by the government.

In the 1950s, the focus of tourism shifted to cultural and natural heritage travel with the federal designation of the San Juan National Historic Site and the historic district of Old San Juan being restored by the Puerto Rican government in order to attract visitors interested in the colonial history of the island. The designation of La Fortaleza and San Juan National Historic Site in 1983 as the eleventh World Heritage Site under U.S. jurisdiction further helped cement San Juan as a national and international tourist destination. Ecotourism later grew with the establishment of visitor infrastructure in El Yunque National Forest, the only tropical rainforest in the National Forest Service system, and with the development of natural heritage tourist destinations in the form of state forests, recreational areas and &quot;parques nacionales&quot;, the Puerto Rican equivalent of state parks, between the 1950s and 1980s. Other tourist activities such as fishing also became popular in the second half of the 20th century with Puerto Rico being considered one of the best places in the world to catch Atlantic tarpon.

The tourism industry experienced moderate levels of growth in 2014, driven primarily by the introduction of new cruise lines and airfare activity and the development of new hotels on the island. In 2016, Puerto Rico was featured as a popular destination for business meetings, incentives, conferencing, and exhibitions, due to its modern convention center and district overlooking the Port of San Juan. Between 2017 and 2020, however, the tourism industry in Puerto Rico was greatly affected by events such as Hurricane Maria in 2017, the 2019 and 2020 earthquakes, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Additionally, during the 2019 government shutdown, the San Juan National Historic Site closed its two colonial-era fortresses of Castillo San Felipe del Morro and Castillo San Cristóbal to visitors.

As of 2024, nonstop flights to Puerto Rico are available year-round from domestic airports such as Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Denver, Detroit, Fort Lauderdale, Houston, Miami, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Nashville, New Orleans, New York, Newark, Orlando, Philadelphia, Tampa, Washington, D.C., and several international airports, including Bogotá, Cancún, Madrid, Medellín, Montreal, Panama City, and Toronto, as well as regional Caribbean destinations such as Barbados, Port of Spain, Punta Cana, St. Croix, St. Maarten, St. Thomas, Santiago de los Caballeros, Santo Domingo, and Tortola.

=== Land Privatization, Ownership, and Impacts ===
==== Role of corporations ====
Increasing land privatization in Puerto Rico takes place amid what scholars Yarimar Bonilla and Marisol LeBrón term “aftershocks of disaster,” where the island is mired in neocolonial debt and public infrastructures like airports and hospitals continue to be sold to the highest bidder. The passing of Act 20/22 in 2012 also allowed wealthy elites from the United States to treat Puerto Rico as a tax haven and become “stakeholders.” New arrivals–who do not include those born in Puerto Rico—who spend at least six months in the territory can be exempt from federal, local, capital gains, and passive income taxes until 2035, all of which contributes to the rise of “hyper-segregated elite foreign enclaves around the island.”

As Naomi Klein and Boniila demonstrate in their research, this “infrastructure of disposition and displacement” was deeply rooted even before Hurricane Maria in 2017. Hurricane Maria only worsened the ongoing land privatization, as one resident shared: “It feels like Hurricane Maria placed a ‘For Sale’ sign on the island.” More recently, in 2021, cryptocurrency companies like Pantera Capital and Redwood City Ventures have been moving their offices to Puerto Rico alongside 274 other corporations, LLCs, partnerships, and other entities approved under the Exports Services Act to avoid taxes. Mortgage investors, such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Perella Weinberg Partners, and TPG Capital have increasingly turned to Puerto Rico for cheap foreclosed properties as local residents are forced to leave. There is such significant demand that other companies, such as PRelocate, specialize in helping their clients relocate their businesses to the island.

==== Land Ownership Shifts and Tourism ====
The lack of proof of ownership of land and homes in Puerto Rico has served as an obstacle for people whose homes were destroyed by Hurricane Maria in 2017 to get repaired. According to the Puerto Rico Builders’ Association, in 2018, 45-55% of homes and commercial buildings have been constructed without building permits or following land use codes. It is estimated that 260,000 homes do not have deeds or titles. Much of these illegally built homes have been cited as examples of “rescuing land.” Many who lack the resources would thereby “rescue land” by building homes in vacant and unused land that is often owned by the state, and not homeowners. In addition, many homes lack historical documentation because of the practice of subdividing generationally owned land. As a result, much of the housing that has been made inhospitable by the Hurricane that devastated the island, cannot be fixed for residents through FEMA funding, leaving many in dire and unsafe conditions, or without proper housing at all.

Meanwhile, in July 2019 the Puerto Rican state planning board put forth new land use codes in an attempt to bring business to the island and alleviate the debt crisis. The plan, which was met with significant resistance, would potentially change areas that were zoned as natural resource areas, agricultural lands, and residential areas to allow new land uses. According to Puerto Rican farmer Carlos Pacheo, land used for agricultural areas allowing new uses, including industry, can negatively affect the growth of local agriculture in Puerto Rico and thus impact food security, which is a growing problem for Puerto Rico as the island has been relying on expensive importation of food. It is estimated that 99,000 cuerdas of land could lose protected status, making land once deemed as natural resources or residential areas, could fall into the ownership of corporations, especially tourist corporations.

Moreover, the Puerto Rican government has been incentivizing the growth of the tourism industry and investors from the United States, instead of addressing the lack of ownership of land and stable housing by regular citizens and long-time Puerto Rican residents. Act 74 specifically incentivizes investment in the tourism industry. Under the act, construction of new facilities or remodeling of old facilities for the use of tourism would grant land developers a 10-year tax exemption. Businesses providing tourist activity can be defined as timeshares, hotels, inns, guesthouses, entertainment facilities in ports that stimulate tourism, theme parks, golf courses associated with a hotel, and marinas for tourist purposes. It also includes businesses that administer or develop natural resources as a source of active and passive entertainment. In addition, Act 74 grants businesses excise, sales and use tax exemptions on imported articles to be used for tourism activity in Puerto Rico provided that there was a genuine effort to source the articles in Puerto Rico but there was no economic justification to do so. Moreover, businesses that provide tourist activity receive property tax exemption at the 90% rate, income tax exemption at the 90% rate if not located in Vieques or Culebra, income tax exemption at the 100% rate if located in Vieques or Culebra, and exemption from municipal construction tax, amongst other benefits for investors. There is thereby less public investment from the growth of private developments in the tourist industry.

Additionally, the 2012 Act 60 provides tax benefits for foreigners who relocate and buy property in Puerto Rico within 2 years of moving. 4,286 applications for these benefits have been approved since 2012. Puerto Rican residents do not qualify for these benefits, resulting in more and more land being owned by non-Puerto Ricans. According to the New York Times, many of these investors buy residential properties and turn them into short-term rentals, causing a housing shortage for local residents. In Rincon, a 2-bedroom apartment would list for $290,000 in 2017 on average but would now cost $420,000. This is as forty-three percent of Puerto Ricans live under the poverty level, meaning owning housing is increasingly accessible only to the wealthy, who, in many instances, are foreign investors.

British property investor, Keith St. Clair, who benefitted from tax-breaks that incentivize property ownership by tourist corporations, aims to: “ignite a much-needed renaissance that will increase tourism” in the Isla Verde section of Carolina, Puerto Rico.

In 2019, Donald Trump’s tax incentive plan resulted in 98% of Puerto Rico being deemed as an opportunity zone, which would incentivize land development by foreign investors in areas deemed as low-income based on the Census. Pedro Cardona, former vice president and a planner for the Puerto Rican Planning Board says that the instatement of opportunity zones would introduce a gentrification and elitization component to various areas in Puerto Rico, which can be tied to foreign investment in the Tourism industry.

==== Grassroots Movements and Protests ====
There are numerous ongoing grassroots movements and protests against land privatization in Puerto Rico, particularly against the expansion of many resorts and hotels onto public beaches.

===== Los Almendros Beach =====
In 2021, protests broke out in Rincón, when the Board of Directors of the luxury condominiums &quot;Sol y Playa&quot; began plans to develop a pool that would spill over onto the neighboring public beach, Los Almendros Beach. Environmentalists and locals protested the development, as it would have caused a significant disruption to the wildlife and ecosystem around the beach. Locals also noted that &quot;Sol y Playa&quot; had no right to build onto a public beach, and were concerned that it was the start of an attempt to privatize the beach to renters in condominiums.

Controversy erupted when large numbers of police began to remove and arrest the protestors, despite the beach being fully public. The heavy police presence confirmed for many native Puerto Ricans the hypocrisies of policing in the island; many protestors noted how police often dedicate resources when wealthy neighborhoods (like &quot;Sol y Playa&quot;) become disrupted, yet in the rest of the island, police presence is sparse. In total, around 534 police stood ground at the protest site.

The protest, however, was extremely effective; the governor’s planning board declared &quot;Sol y Playa&quot;’s construction project illegal on August 4, 2021. This ruling was seen as a potential turning point in the fight against the privatization of public land in Puerto Rico.

===== &quot;Playas P’al Pueblo &quot; =====
&quot;Playas P’al Pueblo&quot; is one organization fighting against the hotel chain Marriott in Puerto Rico. They were founded on March 13, 2005, with the intention of setting up a basecamp in the near the Courtyard Marriott in Isla Verde, to protest the Marriott’s proposed expansion in the area.

Since the founding of &quot;Playas P’al Pueblo&quot;, the organization has been litigating on behalf of environmental justice groups to stop the proposed expansion. They regard the Marriott’s expansion in Isla Verde, as well as similar resort and hotel expansion across Puerto Rico, as an attempt to privatize public land and exclude native Puerto Ricans from their own land.

&quot;Playas P’al Pueblo&quot; has also been involved in numerous coastal restoration projects, as well as environmental education projects in their base-camp. They have begun to plant trees around their base-camp in order to re-establish a coastabl habitat, as developers had nearly destroyed it. They have also hosted hundreds of students at their base camp to teach them about the ongoing resistance against the privatization of Puerto Rican land.

&quot;Playas P’al Pueblo&quot;’s efforts to rebuild the coastal habitat have led to locals calling the area &quot;Carolina Forest Coastal Reserve&quot;.

==Competition==
Cuba and Puerto Rico have perennially competed for the top tourist destination in the Caribbean. The tourism industry in Puerto Rico has greatly benefited from the poor relations between the United States and Cuba. In 2015, the U.S. reestablished diplomatic relations with Cuba and loosened the travel restrictions for Americans. This decision boosted Cuban tourism and caused the island nation to surpass Puerto Rico in total visitors, but in 2017, the U.S. government re-enforced travel restrictions to Cuba. Puerto Rico also competes with the Dominican Republic, Aruba, Jamaica and Florida for domestic American and international visitors. Tourists also flying to destinations in the Lesser Antilles, such as Barbados, Dominica, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Trinidad &amp; Tobago, and the Virgin Islands often have connecting flights in Puerto Rico.

==Marketing campaigns==

The Puerto Rico Tourism Company spent $1 million in 2002, featuring celebrities, to advertise the tourism to Puerto Rico. In 2017, Despacito, a wildly popular song by famous Puerto Rican artists Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee caused a spike in tourism to Puerto Rico, especially to an area of San Juan called La Perla, which featured in the song&#x27;s video.

On July 1, 2018, Puerto Rico&#x27;s government passed a law to create a new tourism organization, Discover Puerto Rico. This was part of a larger plan to use tourism to revitalize the island after Hurricane Maria.

The new Discover Puerto Rico campaign started that month. An April 2019 report stated that the tourism team, &quot;after hitting the one-year anniversary of the storm in September 2018&quot;, the organization began to shift towards more optimistic messaging. The &quot;Have We Met Yet?&quot; campaign was intended to highlight the island&#x27;s culture and history, making it distinct, different than other Caribbean destinations. In 2019, Discover Puerto Rico planned to continue that campaign, including &quot;streaming options for branded content&quot;.

The video series &quot;Discover Puerto Rico with Lin-Manuel&quot; starring actor, songwriter and lyricist Lin-Manuel Miranda, became available on all JetBlue aircraft on 1 October 1, 2019 and would continue until 30 January 2020.

==Destinations==

Tourist destinations vary around the island. The government of Puerto Rico and the Puerto Rico Tourism Company divided the island and its 78 municipalities into six tourism regions in order to better promote market and develop the entirety of the island outside of San Juan and to foment an inflow of domestic and international visitors into the different parts of the island.

=== &quot;Región Metro&quot; ===

&quot;Región Metro&quot; (Spanish for &quot;metropolitan region&quot;) roughly corresponds to the urban core of the San Juan metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in Puerto Rico and, with more than 2.2 million inhabitants according to the 2020 census, one of the most urbanized regions in the Caribbean. San Juan is the largest city in Puerto Rico, and it is home to some of the most visited tourist attractions in the island such as Old San Juan and the San Juan National Historic Site. The city of San Juan hosts numerous beaches such as El Condado and Ocean Park, museums such as the Museum of Art of Puerto Rico, world-class event venues such as &quot;El Choliseo&quot;, parks such as Luis Muñoz Rivera Park and the University of Puerto Rico Botanical Garden, and large malls such as Plaza Las Américas. Some of the other prominent tourist attractions of the region include the Bacardi Distillery, the Caparra Archaeological Site, the Caribbean Manatee Conservation Center, Isla de Cabras, Julio Enrique Monagas Park, Parque de las Ciencias, and the William Miranda Marín Botanical and Cultural Garden.

=== Porta Antillas (Región Este) ===
Porta Antillas, also known as Porta del Este and &quot;Región Este&quot; (Spanish for &quot;eastern region&quot;), corresponds to the Sierra de Luquillo, the eastern coast of Puerto Rico and the island municipalities of Culebra and Vieques (often referred to as the Spanish Virgin Islands), and it includes El Yunque National Forest, the most visited natural attraction in the island. Some of the other prominent tourist attractions of the region include the Humacao Nature Reserve, La Cordillera Reef Nature Reserve, Las Cabezas de San Juan with its historic lighthouse, the Malecón of Naguabo, Palmas del Mar, Piñones and its food kiosks, Punta Tuna Lighthouse, and Puerto Del Rey Marina.

=== Porta Atlántico (Región Norte) ===
Porta Atlántico, also known as &quot;Región Norte&quot; (Spanish for &quot;northern region&quot;), corresponds to the northern Atlantic coast of Puerto Rico located immediately west of San Juan. It is prominently marked by its karst topography, which is evident in the numerous mogotes, sinkholes, cave systems and dramatic limestone ocean cliffs. The largest city in the region is Arecibo, one of the oldest towns in Puerto Rico, famous for its lighthouse, the Arecibo Observatory, Cueva Ventana and Cueva del Indio. Another prominent landmark of the region is the Camuy River Caverns, one of the largest of its type in the world. Some of the most prominent tourist attractions in the region include the Cambalache State Forest, Dos Bocas Lake, Hacienda La Esperanza, La Plata Lake, Mar Bella Beach, and Mar Chiquita Beach.

=== Porta Caribe (Región Sur) ===
Porta Caribe, also known as &quot;Región Sur&quot; (Spanish for &quot;southern region&quot;), corresponds to the southern coast of Puerto Rico, and it includes the numerous islands and keys located along the Caribbean coast of the island such as Caja de Muertos. Ponce is the second largest city in Puerto Rico outside of the San Juan metropolitan area, and it is one of the most architecturally important cities in the island with a unique style called Ponce Creole having been born there at the end of the 19th century. Some of the other prominent tourist attractions of the region include Castillo Serrallés, Central Aguirre Historic District, the Coamo Hot Springs, Cruceta del Vigía, Hacienda Buena Vista, the historic downtown of Coamo with its historic church, Parque de Bombas, La Guancha, the Ponce Museum of Art, and the Tibes Indigenous Ceremonial Center.

=== Porta Cordillera (Región Central) ===

Porta Cordillera, also known as &quot;Región Central&quot; (Spanish for &quot;central region&quot;), corresponds to the mountainous municipalities that are located along the Cordillera Central (also known as the Central Mountain Range). Some of the most prominent tourist attractions in the region include the Caguana Indigenous Ceremonial Center, Guavate and its &quot;lechoneras&quot;, Guilarte State Forest, Los Tres Picachos State Forest, the Luis Muñoz Rivera birthplace and family mausoleum, the San Cristóbal Canyon, and Toro Negro State Forest which contains Cerro de Punta, the highest point in Puerto Rico. Many of the small historic towns of the region such as Adjuntas, Ciales, Jayuya and Utuado are also closely tied to the coffee industry of Puerto Rico. In addition to the natural and cultural sites of the region, the Aibonito Festival of Flowers is a notable event that draws many visitors to the region every year.

=== Porta del Sol (Región Oeste) ===

Porta del Sol, also known as &quot;Región Oeste&quot; (Spanish for &quot;western region&quot;), corresponds to the entirety of the western coast of Puerto Rico which is located along the Mona Passage, and it includes the uninhabited islands of Mona, Monito and Desecheo. Some of the most prominent tourist attractions in the region include Boquerón, the Cabo Rojo National Wildlife Refuge, Crash Boat Beach, Domes Beach, Guajataca Lake, Guajataca State Forest, Guánica State Forest, Hacienda Juanita, Jobos Beach, Joyuda, La Parguera, La Pocita de las Golondrinas Beach, Los Cayos de Caña Gorda, Los Morrillos de Cabo Rojo and its lighthouse, Maricao State Forest, Palacete Los Moreau, Pozo de Jacinto, Punta Borinquen, Punta Higuero Lighthouse, and the San Germán Historic District.

==Cruise ship tourism==

In spite of damage caused by previous hurricanes, particularly Maria in 2017, an April 2019 report stated that &quot;1.7 million cruise ship passengers are expected to visit this fiscal year&quot;.

In late November 2019 however, reports indicated that 90 calls to San Juan by Royal Caribbean ships would be cancelled during 2020 and 2021. This step would mean 360,000 fewer visitors, with a loss to the island&#x27;s economy of 44 million. As well, 30 ship departures from San Juan were being canceled. The rationale for this decision was discussed in a news report:The reason for the cancellations is the privatization of the cruise docks in San Juan due to much-needed maintenance that is needed. Around $250 million investment is needed to make sure cruise ships can continue to dock there in the years to come. There is an urge for governor Wanda Vazquez to not go ahead with the privatization so this news is fluid.

<text>X-1 (or SS X-1) was a United States Navy Midget Submarine designed under project SCB 65. Laid down on 8 June 1954, at Deer Park, Long Island, New York, by the Engine Division of Fairchild Engine and Airplane Corporation. Launched on 7 September 1955, at Oyster Bay, Long Island, by Jakobson Shipyard. Delivered to the Navy on 6 October at New London, Connecticut and placed in service on 7 October 1955 with Lieutenant Kevin Hanlon in command.

==Service history==
&quot;X-1&quot; served in a research capacity in rigorous and extensive tests to assist the Navy to evaluate its ability to defend harbors against very small submarines. Further tests conducted with the &quot;X-1&quot; helped to determine the offensive capabilities and limitations of this type of submersible.

&quot;X-1&quot; was originally powered by a hydrogen peroxide/diesel engine and battery system, but an explosion of her hydrogen peroxide supply on 20 May 1957 resulted in the craft&#x27;s modification to accept a diesel-electric drive. On 2 December 1957, &quot;X-1&quot; was taken out of service and deactivated at Philadelphia.

Towed to Annapolis, Maryland, in December 1960, &quot;X-1&quot; was reactivated and attached to Submarine Squadron 6 and based at the Small Craft Facility of the Severn River Command for experimental duties in Chesapeake Bay. In tests conducted under the auspices of the Naval Research Laboratory, &quot;X-1&quot; performed for scientists who observed her operations from a platform suspended beneath the Bay Bridge, to learn more about the properties and actions of sea water.

Having been in active service through January 1973, &quot;X-1&quot; was again taken out of service on 16 February 1973. On 26 April 1973, she was transferred to the Naval Ship Research and Development Center, Annapolis. On 9 July 1974, she was slated for use as a historical exhibit. She was later displayed on the grounds of the Naval Station complex, North Severn, near Annapolis. In 2001, &quot;X-1&quot; was transferred to the Submarine Force Museum, in Groton, Connecticut, where she is on display before the main exhibit building.

<doc id="185362" wikidata="Q149208" url="?curid=185362" title="East Frisian Low Saxon">
<text>East Frisian Low Saxon, East Frisian Low German or simply called East Frisian is a Northern Low Saxon dialect spoken in the East Frisian peninsula of northwestern Lower Saxony.

It is used quite frequently in everyday speech there. About half of the East Frisian population in the coastal region uses the language. A number of individuals, despite not being active speakers of East Frisian Low Saxon, are able to understand it to some extent. However, both active and passive language skills are in a state of decrease.

East Frisian Low Saxon is not to be confused with the East Frisian language; the latter, spoken by about 2,000 individuals in the Saterland region, is a Frisian language, not Low German.

There are several dialects in East Frisian Low Saxon. There are two main groups of dialects. The dialects in the east, called Harlinger Platt, are strongly influenced by Northern Low Saxon of Oldenburg. The western dialects are closer to the Low Saxon Language spoken in the Dutch province of Groningen, Gronings.

East Frisian Low Saxon differs from other Northern Low Saxon dialects in several aspects, which are often linked to Frisian heritage. The language originally spoken in East Frisia and Groningen was Frisian, so the current Low German dialects of East Frisia, as part of the dialects, build on a Frisian substrate which has led to a large amount of unique lexical, syntactic, and phonological items which differ from other Low Saxon variants. Some Old Frisian vocabulary is still in active speech today.

East Frisian features frequent use of diminutives, as in the Dutch language, e.g. &quot;&quot; ‘lump of rock sugar’. In many cases, diminutives of names, especially female ones, have become names of their own. For example: &quot;Antje&quot; (from Anna), &quot;Triintje&quot; (from Trina = Katharina) etc.

The dialects spoken in East Frisia are closely related to those spoken in the Dutch province of Groningen (Grunnegs, Grünnigs) and in Northern Drenthe (Noordenvelds). The biggest difference seems to be that of loanwords (from Dutch or German, resp.).

The standard greeting is Moin (moi in Gronings), used 24 hours a day.

==Phonology==
===Consonants===
==Orthography==
East Frisian Low Saxon has two orthographies which are well known. One is developed by the Ostfriesische Landschaft, which is based on the orthography by Johannes Sass. The Ostfriesische Landschaft uses this spelling for all of their projects, and to promote the dialect. It is considered to also be a cross di-dialect compromise writing, to provide materials in Low German for outside of the East Frisian Low Saxon dialect speaking area, and is recognized by the government of Lower Saxony.

However, a newer, more phonetic orthography was developed in 1975 by Holger Weigelt, since he expressed concerns that the grammatical structures and character of East Frisian Low Saxon would not be presented well under the Sass-based spelling. This orthography is used fully by the Jungfräiske Mäinskup, which promotes the dialect and provides learning materials in this spelling. They also recognize East Frisian Low Saxon as its own Friso-Saxon language. The Incubator Wikipedia for East Frisian Low Saxon along with the examples of the dialect in this page are also in this spelling.

<doc id="185365" wikidata="Q940618" url="?curid=185365" title="Cod Wars">
<text>The Cod Wars (; also known as , ; ) were a series of 20th-century confrontations between the United Kingdom (with aid from West Germany) and Iceland about fishing rights in the North Atlantic. Each of the disputes ended with an Icelandic victory.

Fishing boats from Britain had been sailing to waters near Iceland in search of catch since the 14th century. Agreements struck during the 15th century started a centuries-long series of intermittent disputes between the two countries. Demand for seafood and consequent competition for fish stocks grew rapidly in the 19th century. The modern disputes began in 1952 after Iceland expanded its territorial waters from 3 to . The United Kingdom responded by banning Icelandic ships landing their fish in British ports. In 1958, Iceland expanded its territorial waters to and banned foreign fishing fleets. Britain refused to accept this decision, which led to a series of confrontations over 20 years: 1958–1961, 1972–73 and 1975–76. British fishing boats were escorted to the fishing grounds by the Royal Navy while the Icelandic Coast Guard attempted to chase them away and use long hawsers to cut nets from the British boats; ships from both sides suffered damage from ramming attacks.

Each confrontation concluded with an agreement favourable for Iceland. Iceland made threats it would withdraw from NATO, which would have forfeited NATO&#x27;s access to most of the GIUK gap, a critical anti-submarine warfare chokepoint during the Cold War. In a NATO-brokered agreement in 1976, the United Kingdom accepted Iceland&#x27;s establishment of a 12-nautical-mile (22 km) exclusive zone around its shores and a Icelandic fishery zone where other nations&#x27; fishing fleets needed Iceland&#x27;s permission. The agreement brought to an end more than 500 years of unrestricted British fishing in these waters and, as a result, British fishing communities were devastated, with thousands of jobs lost. The UK declared a similar 200-nautical-mile zone around its own waters. Since 1982, a exclusive economic zone has been the international standard under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.

There was one confirmed death during the Cod Wars: an Icelandic engineer, who was accidentally killed in 1973 while repairing damage on the Icelandic patrol boat &quot;Ægir&quot; after a collision with the British frigate &quot;Apollo&quot;. Recent studies of the Cod Wars have focused on the underlying economic, legal and strategic drivers for Iceland and the United Kingdom, as well as the domestic and international factors that contributed to the escalation of the dispute. Lessons drawn from the Cod Wars have been applied to international relations theory.

==Background==
Seafood has for centuries been a staple in the diet of inhabitants of the British Isles, Iceland and other Nordic countries, which are surrounded by some of the world&#x27;s richest fisheries. Danish and Norse raiders came to Britain in the ninth century bringing one fish species in particular, the North Sea cod, into the national diet. Other whitefish like halibut, hake and pollock also became popular.

===Until 1949===

By the end of the 14th century, fishing boats from the east coast of England, then as now home to most of the English fishing fleet, were sailing to Icelandic waters in search of these catches; their landings grew so abundant as to cause political friction between England and Denmark, who ruled Iceland at the time. The Danish King Eric banned all Icelandic trade with England in 1414 and complained to his English counterpart, Henry V, about the depletion of fishing stocks off the island. Restrictions on British fishing passed by Parliament were generally ignored and unenforced, leading to violence and the Anglo-Hanseatic War (1469–1474). Diplomats resolved these disputes through agreements that allowed British ships to fish Icelandic waters with seven-year licences, a provision that was struck from the Treaty of Utrecht when it was presented to the Icelandic Althing for ratification in 1474. This started a centuries-long series of intermittent disputes between the two countries. From the early 16th century onward, English sailors and fishermen were a major presence in the waters off Iceland.

With the increases in range of fishing that were enabled by steam power in the late 19th century, boat owners and skippers felt pressure to exploit new grounds. Their large catches in Icelandic waters attracted more regular voyages across the North Atlantic. In 1893, the Danish government, which then governed Iceland and the Faroe Islands, claimed a fishing limit of around their shores. British trawler owners disputed the claim and continued to send their ships to the waters near Iceland. The British government did not recognise the Danish claim on the grounds that setting such a precedent would lead to similar claims by the nations around the North Sea, which would damage the British fishing industry.

In 1896, the United Kingdom made an agreement with Denmark for British vessels to use any Icelandic port for shelter if they stowed their gear and trawl nets. In return, British vessels were not to fish in Faxa Bay east of a line from Ílunýpa, a promontory near Keflavík to Þormóðssker (43.43° N, 22.30° W).

With many British trawlers being charged and fined by Danish gunboats for fishing illegally within the limit, which the British government refused to recognise, the British press began to enquire why the Danish action against British interests was allowed to continue without intervention by the Royal Navy. The British made a show of naval force (gunboat diplomacy) in 1896 and 1897.

In April 1899, the steam trawler &quot;Caspian&quot; was fishing off the Faroe Islands when a Danish gunboat tried to arrest her for allegedly fishing illegally inside the limits. The trawler refused to stop and was fired upon first with blank shells and then with live ammunition. Eventually, the trawler was caught, but before the skipper, Charles Henry Johnson, left his ship to go aboard the Danish gunboat, he ordered the mate to make a dash for it after he went on to the Danish ship. The &quot;Caspian&quot; set off at full speed. The gunboat fired several shots at the unarmed boat but could not catch up with the trawler, which returned, heavily damaged, to Grimsby, England. On board the Danish gunboat, the skipper of the &quot;Caspian&quot; was lashed to the mast. A court held at Thorshavn convicted him on several counts including illegal fishing and attempted assault, and he was jailed for 30 days.

The &#x27;Anglo-Danish Territorial Waters Agreement&#x27; of 1901 set a territorial waters limit, measured narrowly, around each party&#x27;s coastlines: this applied to Iceland as (at the time) part of Denmark and had a term of 50 years.

The Icelandic fisheries grew in importance for the British fishing industry around the end of the 19th century. The reduction in fishing activity brought about by the hostilities of the First World War effectively ended the dispute for a time.

While data is incomplete for the prewar period, one historian argues that the Icelandic fishing grounds were &#x27;very important&#x27; to the British fishing industry as a whole. Data from 1919 to 1938 showed a significant increase in the British total catches in Icelandic waters. The British catches in Iceland were more than twice the combined catches of all other grounds of the British distant water fleet. Icelanders grew increasingly dismayed at the British presence.

=== 1949–1958 ===
In October 1949, Iceland initiated the two-year abrogation process of the agreement made between Denmark and the United Kingdom in 1901. The fishery limits to the north of Iceland were extended to . However, since the British trawling fleet did not use those grounds, the northern extension was not a source of significant contention between the two states. Initially planning to extend the rest of its fishery limits by the end of the two-year abrogation period, Iceland chose to postpone its extension to wait for the outcome of the UK–Norway fisheries case in the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which was decided in December 1951.

Icelanders were satisfied with the ICJ ruling, as they believed that Iceland&#x27;s preferred extensions were similar to those afforded to Norway in the ICJ ruling. The UK and Iceland tried to negotiate a solution but were unable to reach agreement. The Icelandic government declared, on 19 March 1952, its intention to extend its fishery limits on 15 May 1952.

Iceland and the United Kingdom were involved in a dispute from May 1952 to November 1956 over Iceland&#x27;s unilateral extension of its fishery limits from . Unlike in the Cod Wars, the Royal Navy was never sent into Icelandic waters. The British trawling industry, however, implemented costly sanctions on Iceland by imposing a landing ban on Icelandic fish in British ports. The landing ban was a major blow to the Icelandic fishing industry (the UK was Iceland&#x27;s largest export market for fish) and caused consternation among Icelandic statesmen. The two sides decided to refer one part of the Icelandic extension to the ICJ in early 1953: the controversial Faxa Bay delimitation.

In May 1953, businessman George Dawson signed an agreement with the Icelandic trawler owners to buy fish landed in Britain. Seven landings were made but the merchants who bought from Dawson were blacklisted and he was unable to distribute the fish effectively himself.

Cold War politics proved favourable for Iceland, as the Soviet Union, seeking influence in Iceland, stepped in to purchase Icelandic fish. The United States, fearing greater Soviet influence in Iceland, also did so and persuaded Spain and Italy to do likewise.

Soviet and American involvement resulted in weakening the punitive effects of the British landing ban. Some scholars refer to the dispute of 1952 to 1956 as one of the Cod Wars, as the object of the dispute and its costs and risks were all similar to those in the other three Cod Wars.

Just as the other Cod Wars, the dispute ended with Iceland achieving its aims, as the Icelandic fishery limits were recognized by the United Kingdom, following a decision by the Organisation of European Economic Co-operation in 1956.

Two years later, in 1958, the United Nations convened the first International Conference on the Law of the Sea, which was attended by 86 states. Several countries sought to extend the limits of their territorial waters to , but the conference did not reach any firm conclusions.

== First Cod War (1958–1961) ==

The First Cod War lasted from 1 September 1958 to 11 March 1961. It began as soon as a new Icelandic law came into force and expanded the Icelandic fishery zone from at midnight on 1 September 1958.

All members of NATO opposed the unilateral Icelandic extension. The British declared that their trawlers would fish under protection from their warships in three areas: out of the Westfjords, north of Horn and southeast of Iceland. In all, twenty British trawlers, four warships and a supply vessel were inside the newly declared zones. The deployment was expensive; in February 1960, Lord Carrington, the First Lord of the Admiralty, responsible for the Royal Navy, stated that the ships near Iceland had expended half a million pounds sterling worth of oil since the new year and that a total of 53 British warships had taken part in the operations. Against that, Iceland could deploy seven patrol vessels and a single PBY-6A Catalina flying boat.

The deployment of the Royal Navy to contested waters led to protests in Iceland. Demonstrations against the British embassy were met with taunts by the British ambassador, Andrew Gilchrist, as he played bagpipe music and military marches on his gramophone. Many incidents followed. The Icelanders were, however, at a disadvantage in patrolling the contested waters because of the size of the area and the limited number of patrol ships. According to one historian, &quot;only the flagship &quot;Þór&quot; () could effectively arrest and, if necessary, tow a trawler to harbour&quot;.

On 4 September, ICGV &quot;Ægir&quot;, an Icelandic patrol vessel built in 1929, attempted to take a British trawler off the Westfjords, but was thwarted when HMS &quot;Russell&quot; intervened, and the two vessels collided. On 6 October, V/s &quot;María Júlía&quot; fired three shots at the trawler &quot;Kingston Emerald&quot;, forcing the trawler to escape to sea. On 12 November, V/s &quot;Þór&quot; encountered the trawler &quot;Hackness&quot;, which had not stowed its nets legally. &quot;Hackness&quot; did not stop until &quot;Þór&quot; had fired two blanks and one live shell off its bow. Once again, HMS &quot;Russell&quot; came to the rescue, and its shipmaster ordered the Icelandic captain to leave the trawler alone, as it was not within the limit recognised by the British government. The captain of &quot;Þór&quot;, Eiríkur Kristófersson, said that he would not do so and ordered his men to approach the trawler with the gun manned. In response, the &quot;Russell&quot; threatened to sink the Icelandic boat if it fired a shot at the &quot;Hackness&quot;. More British ships then arrived, and the &quot;Þór&quot; retreated.

Icelandic officials threatened to withdraw Iceland&#x27;s membership of NATO and to expel US forces from Iceland unless a satisfactory conclusion could be reached to the dispute. Even the cabinet members who were pro-Western (proponents of NATO and the US Defence Agreement) were forced to resort to the threats, as that was Iceland&#x27;s chief leverage, and it would have been political suicide not to use it. Thus, NATO engaged in formal and informal mediations to bring an end to the dispute.

Following the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea between 1960 and 1961, the UK and Iceland came to a settlement in late February 1961, which stipulated Icelandic fishery limits but that Britain would have fishing rights in allocated zones and under certain seasons in the outer for three years. The Icelandic Althing approved the agreement on 11 March 1961.

The deal was very similar to one that Iceland had offered in the weeks and days leading up to its unilateral extension in 1958. As part of the agreement, it was stipulated that any future disagreement between Iceland and Britain in the matter of fishery zones would be sent to the International Court of Justice, in the Hague.

== Second Cod War (1972–1973) ==


The Second Cod War between the United Kingdom and Iceland lasted from September 1972 until the signing of a temporary agreement, in November 1973.

The Icelandic government again extended its fishing limits, now to . It had two goals in extending the limits: (1) to conserve fish stocks and (2) to increase its share of total catches. The reasons that Iceland pursued 50 nmi fishery limits, rather than the 200 nmi limits that they had also considered, were that the most fruitful fishing grounds were within the 50 nmi and that patrolling a 200 nmi limit would have been more difficult.

The British contested the Icelandic extension with two goals in mind: (1) to achieve the greatest possible catch quota for British fishermen in the contested waters and (2) to prevent a &quot;de facto&quot; recognition of a unilateral extension of a fishery jurisdiction, which would set a precedent for other extensions.

All Western European states and the Warsaw Pact opposed Iceland&#x27;s unilateral extension. African states declared support for Iceland&#x27;s extension after a meeting in 1971 where the Icelandic prime minister argued that the Icelandic cause was a part of a broader battle against colonialism and imperialism.

On 1 September 1972, the enforcement of the law that expanded the Icelandic fishery limits to began. Numerous British and West German trawlers continued fishing within the new zone on the first day. The Icelandic leftist coalition then governing ignored the treaty that stipulated the involvement of the International Court of Justice. It said that it was not bound by agreements made by the previous centre-right government, with Lúdvik Jósepsson, the fisheries minister, stating that &quot;the basis for our independence is economic independence&quot;. The next day, the brand-new patrol ship ICGV &quot;Ægir&quot;, built in 1968, chased 16 trawlers, in waters east of the country, out of the 50 nmi zone. The Icelandic Coast Guard started to use net cutters to cut the trawling lines of non-Icelandic vessels fishing within the new exclusion zone.

On 5 September 1972, at 10:25, ICGV &quot;Ægir&quot;, under Guðmundur Kjærnested&#x27;s command, encountered an unmarked trawler fishing northeast of Hornbanki. The master of the black-hulled trawler refused to divulge the trawler&#x27;s name and number and, after being warned to follow the Coast Guard&#x27;s orders, played &quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot; over the radio. At 10:40, the net cutter was deployed into the water for the first time, and &quot;Ægir&quot; sailed along the trawler&#x27;s port side. The fishermen tossed a thick nylon rope into the water as the patrol ship closed in, attempting to disable its propeller. After passing the trawler, &quot;Ægir&quot; veered to the trawler&#x27;s starboard side. The net cutter, behind the patrol vessel, sliced one of the trawling wires. As ICGV &quot;Ægir&quot; came about to circle the unidentified trawler, its angry crew threw coal as well as waste and a large fire axe at the Coast Guard vessel. A considerable amount of swearing and shouting came through the radio, which resulted in the trawler being identified as &quot;Peter Scott&quot; (H103).

On 25 November 1972, a crewman on the German trawler &quot;Erlangen&quot; suffered a head injury as an Icelandic patrol ship cut the trawler&#x27;s trawling wire, which struck the crewman. On 18 January 1973, the nets of 18 trawlers were cut. That forced the British seamen to leave the Icelandic fishery zone unless they had the protection of the Royal Navy. The next day large, fast tugboats were sent to their defence, the first being the &quot;Statesman&quot;. The British considered that to be insufficient and formed a special group to defend the trawlers.

On 23 January 1973, the volcano Eldfell on Heimaey erupted, forcing the Coast Guard to divert its attention to rescuing the inhabitants of the small island.

On 17 May 1973, the British trawlers left the Icelandic waters, only to return two days later when they were escorted by British frigates. The naval deployment was codenamed Operation Dewey. Hawker Siddeley Nimrod jets flew over the contested waters and notified British frigates and trawlers of the whereabouts of Icelandic patrol ships. Icelandic statesmen were infuriated by the entry of the Royal Navy and considered to appeal to the UN Security Council or call for Article 5 of the NATO Charter to be implemented. According to Frederick Irving, US ambassador to Iceland at the time, Icelandic prime minister Ólafur Jóhannesson demanded that the US send jets to bomb the British frigates. There were major protests in Reykjavík on 24 May 1973. All the windows of the British embassy in Reykjavík were broken.

On 26 May, ICGV &quot;Ægir&quot; ordered the Grimsby trawler &quot;Everton&quot; to stop, but the captain of the fishing vessel refused to submit. The incident was followed by a protracted pursuit during which &quot;Ægir&quot; fired first blank warning shots, later live rounds in order to disable the trawler. &quot;Everton&quot; was hit on her bow by four 57 mm shells and water began to rush in, but managed to limp to the protection zone, where she was assisted by the frigate . Emergency repairs were carried out by a naval team from &quot;Jupiter&quot;. Prime minister Ólafur Jóhannesson said about the incident that this was &quot;a natural and inevitable law‐enforcement action&quot;.

The Icelandic lighthouse tender V/s &quot;Árvakur&quot; collided with four British vessels on 1 June, and six days later, on 7 June, ICGV &quot;Ægir&quot; collided with , when the former was reconnoitring for icebergs off the Westfjords, near the edge of the Greenland ice sheet. The Icelandic Coast Guard reported that &quot;Scylla&quot; had been &quot;shadowing and harassing&quot; the Icelandic patrol boat. The British Ministry of Defense claimed that the gunboat intentionally rammed the British frigate.

On 29 August the Icelandic Coast Guard suffered the only confirmed fatality of the conflict, when ICGV &quot;Ægir&quot; collided with . Halldór Hallfreðsson, an engineer on board the Icelandic vessel, died by electrocution from his welding equipment after sea water flooded the compartment in which he was making hull repairs.

On 16 September 1973, Joseph Luns, Secretary-General of NATO, arrived in Reykjavík to talk with Icelandic ministers, who had been pressed to leave NATO, as it had been of no help to Iceland in the conflict. Britain and Iceland were both NATO members. The Royal Navy made use of bases in Iceland during the Cold War to fulfill its primary NATO duty, guarding the Greenland-Iceland-UK gap.

After a series of talks within NATO, British warships were recalled on 3 October. Trawlermen played &quot;Rule Britannia!&quot; over their radios, as they had done when the Royal Navy entered the waters. They also played &quot;The Party&#x27;s Over&quot;. An agreement was signed on 8 November to limit British fishing activities to certain areas inside the 50 nmi limit. The agreement, resolving the dispute, was approved by the Althing on 13 November 1973. The agreement was based on the premise that British trawlers would limit their annual catch to no more than 130,000 tons. The Icelanders were reportedly prepared to settle for 156,000 tons in July 1972 but had increased their demands by spring of 1973 and coffered 117,000 tons (the British demanded 145,000 tons in spring 1973). The agreement expired in November 1975, and the third &quot;Cod War&quot; began.

The Second Cod War threatened Iceland&#x27;s membership in NATO and the US military presence in Iceland. It was the closest that Iceland has come to canceling its bilateral Defence Agreement with the US.

Icelandic NATO membership and hosting of US military had considerable importance to Cold War strategy because of Iceland&#x27;s location in the middle of the GIUK gap.

After the entry of the Royal Navy into the contested waters, at any given time, four frigates and an assortment of tugboats would generally protect the British trawling fleet. Over the course of this Cod War, a total of 32 British frigates had entered the contested waters.

===&quot;C. S. Forester&quot; incident===
On 19 July 1974, more than nine months after the signing of the agreement, one of the largest wet fish stern trawlers in the British fleet, &quot;C. S. Forester&quot;, which had been fishing inside the limit, was shelled and captured by the Icelandic gunboat V/s &quot;Þór&quot; () after a pursuit. &quot;C. S. Forester&quot; was shelled with non-explosive ammunition after repeated warnings. The trawler was hit by at least two rounds, which damaged the engine room and a water tank. She was later boarded and towed to Iceland. Skipper Richard Taylor was sentenced to 30 days imprisonment and fined £5,000. He was released on bail after the owners paid £2,232. Her owners additionally paid a total of £26,300 for the release of the ship. The trawler was allowed to depart with a catch of 200 tons of fish.

== Third Cod War (1975–1976) ==
At the third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea in 1973, several countries supported a limit to territorial waters. On 15 July 1975, the Icelandic government announced its intention to extend its fishery limits. The Third Cod War (November 1975 – June 1976) began after Iceland again extended its fishing limits, now to from its coast. The British government did not recognise the large increase to the exclusion zone and so an issue occurred with British fishermen and their activity in the disputed zone. The conflict, which was the most hard-fought of the Cod Wars, saw British fishing trawlers have their nets cut by the Icelandic Coast Guard, and there were several incidents of ramming by Icelandic ships and British trawlers, frigates and tugboats.

One of the most serious incidents occurred on 11 December 1975. As reported by Iceland, V/s &quot;Þór&quot;, under the command of Helgi Hallvarðsson, was leaving port at Seyðisfjörður, where it had been minesweeping, when orders were received to investigate the presence of unidentified foreign vessels at the mouth of the fjord. The vessels were identified as three British ships: &quot;Lloydsman&quot;, an oceangoing tug three times bigger than V/s &quot;Þór&quot;; &quot;Star Aquarius&quot;, an oil rig supply vessel of British Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food; and the latter&#x27;s sister ship, &quot;Star Polaris&quot;. They were sheltering from a force nine gale within Iceland&#x27;s territorial waters. In the Icelandic account, when ordered to leave Icelandic territorial waters by the commander of &quot;Þór&quot;, the three tugboats initially complied. However, around from the coast, &quot;Star Aquarius&quot; allegedly veered to starboard and hit &quot;Þór&quot; port side as the Coast Guards attempted to overtake her. Even as &quot;Þór&quot; increased speed, &quot;Lloydsman&quot; again collided with its port side. &quot;Þór&quot; had suffered considerable damage by these hits and so when &quot;Star Aquarius&quot; came about, a blank round was fired from &quot;Þór&quot;. That did not deter &quot;Star Aquarius&quot;, as it hit &quot;Þór&quot; a second time. Another shot was fired from &quot;Þór&quot; as a result, this time a live round that hit the bow of &quot;Star Aquarius&quot;. Then, the tugboats retreated. V/s &quot;Þór&quot;, which was close to sinking after the confrontation, sailed to Loðmundarfjörður for temporary repairs.

The British reports of the incident differ considerably and maintain that &quot;Þór&quot; attempted to board one of the tugboats, and as &quot;Þór&quot; broke away, &quot;Lloydsman&quot; surged forward to protect &quot;Star Aquarius&quot;. Captain Albert MacKenzie of &quot;Star Aquarius&quot; said that &quot;Þór&quot; approached from the stern and hit the support vessel before it veered off and fired a shot from a range of about . Niels Sigurdsson, the Icelandic Ambassador in London, said that &quot;Þór&quot; had been firing in self-defence after it had been rammed by British vessels. Iceland consulted the UN Security Council over the incident, which declined to intervene.
The immediate Royal Navy response was to dispatch a large frigate force, which was already well on the way to Icelandic waters, before the Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, or the Foreign Secretary, Anthony Crosland, were informed. The Royal Navy saw the opportunity to demonstrate the capabilities of its older Type 12 and Type 81 frigates for sustained deployment in the area of the Denmark Strait, where they were expected to deter the passage of Soviet submarines while the Royal Navy was threatened by further serious defence and naval cuts by the Royal Navy&#x27;s chief &quot;bête noire&quot;, the Chancellor of Exchequer and former Minister of Defence, Denis Healey. The Royal Navy saw its strategic aim at the time to be as much fighting Healey as the Soviet Navy. The Second and Third Cod Wars were seen as necessary conflicts by the Royal Navy, like the Falklands War, six years later. To Crosland, also MP for the trawler port of Grimsby, the third war was a more serious threat to the Western Alliance than was the Middle East.

Another incident occurred in January 1976, when collided with &quot;Þór&quot;, which sustained a hole in its hull; the hull of &quot;Andromeda&quot; was dented. The British Ministry of Defence said that the collision represented a &quot;deliberate attack&quot; on the British warship &quot;without regard for life&quot;. The Icelandic Coast Guard, on the other hand, insisted that &quot;Andromeda&quot; had rammed &quot;Þór&quot; by &quot;overtaking the boat and then swiftly changing course&quot;. After the incident and facing a growing number of ships enduring dockyard repairs, the Royal Navy ordered a &quot;more cautious approach&quot; in dealing with &quot;the enemy cutting the trawlers&#x27; warps&quot;.

On 19 February 1976, the British Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Fred Preat, announced that a fisherman from Grimsby had become the first British casualty of the Third Cod War, when a hawser hit and seriously injured him after Icelandic vessels cut a trawl. While a British parliamentary source reported in a 1993 debate that a British trawlerman was accidentally killed by a solid shot fired by an Icelandic patrol boat, this suggestion has not been corroborated by any other historical source.

Britain deployed a total of 22 frigates and ordered the reactivation from reserve of the Type 41 frigate and Type 61 , refitting them as specialist ramming craft with reinforced wooden bows. In addition to the frigates, the British also deployed a total of seven supply ships, nine tugboats and three support ships to protect its fishing trawlers, but only six to nine of the vessels were on deployment at any one time. The Royal Navy was prepared to accept serious damage to its Cold War frigate fleet, costing millions and disabling part of its North Atlantic capacity for more than a year. had its bow torn off, had a 40 ft gash ripped through her hull, and suffered such structural damage from ramming by Icelandic gunboats that it had to be reduced to a moored operational training frigate. Iceland deployed four patrol vessels (V/s &quot;Óðinn&quot;, V/s &quot;Þór&quot;, V/s &quot;Týr&quot;, and V/s &quot;Ægir&quot;) and two armed trawlers (V/s &quot;Baldur&quot; and V/s &quot;Ver&quot;). The Icelandic government tried to acquire US s and when it was denied by Henry Kissinger, it tried to acquire Soviet s instead.

A more serious turn of events came when Iceland threatened closure of the NATO base at Keflavík, which would have severely impaired NATO&#x27;s ability to deny access to the Atlantic Ocean to the Soviet Union. As a result, the British government agreed to have its fishermen stay outside Iceland&#x27;s exclusion zone without a specific agreement.

On the evening of 6 May 1976, after the outcome of the Third Cod War had already been decided, V/s &quot;Týr&quot; was trying to cut the nets of the trawler &quot;Carlisle&quot; when Captain Gerald Plumer of ordered it rammed. &quot;Falmouth&quot;, at a speed of more than , rammed &quot;Týr&quot;, almost capsizing her. &quot;Týr&quot; did not sink and managed to cut the nets of &quot;Carlisle&quot;, and &quot;Falmouth&quot; rammed it again. &quot;Týr&quot; was heavily damaged and found herself propelled by only a single screw and pursued by the tugboat &quot;Statesman&quot;. In the dire situation, Captain Guðmundur Kjærnested gave orders to man the guns, in spite of the overwhelming superiority of firepower HMS &quot;Falmouth&quot; enjoyed, to deter any further ramming. In return, &quot;Falmouth&quot; suffered heavy bow damage. The Third Cod War saw 55 ramming incidents altogether.

In NATO-mediated sessions, an agreement was reached between Iceland and the UK on 1 June 1976. The British were allowed to keep 24 trawlers within the 200 nmi limit and fish a total of 30,000 tons.

While Iceland came closest to withdrawing from NATO and expelling US forces in the Second Cod War, Iceland actually took the most serious action in all of the Cod Wars in the Third Cod War by ending diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom on 19 February 1976. Although the Icelandic government was firmly pro-Western, the government linked Iceland&#x27;s NATO membership with the outcomes of the fishery dispute. If a favourable outcome could not be reached, Iceland implied that it would withdraw from NATO. However, the government never explicitly linked the US Defence Agreement to the outcome of the dispute.

== Results==
Iceland achieved its overall aims. As a result, the already-declining British fisheries were hit hard by being excluded from historical prime fishing grounds and the economies of the large northern fishing ports in the United Kingdom, such as Grimsby, Hull, and Fleetwood, were severely affected, with thousands of skilled fishermen and people in related trades being put out of work. The cost for repairing the damaged Royal Navy frigates was probably over £1 million at the time.

In 2012, the British government offered a multimillion-pound compensation deal and apology to fishermen who lost their livelihoods in the 1970s. More than 35 years after the workers lost their jobs, the £1,000 compensation offered to 2,500 fishermen was criticised for being insufficient and excessively delayed.

== Scholarship ==
The term &quot;Cod War&quot; was coined by a British journalist in early September 1958. None of the Cod Wars meet the threshold for a conventional war, and are more accurately be described as militarised interstate disputes. 

A 2016 review article found that the underlying drivers behind the desire to extend fishery limits were economic and legal for Iceland, but were economic and strategic for the United Kingdom. It, however, argues that &quot;these underlying causes account for the tensions but are not enough to explain why bargaining failure occurred&quot;. After all, the outbreak of each Cod War was costly and risky for both sides.

Several factors are mentioned to explain why bargaining failure occurred. The nature of nationalism and party competition for Iceland and pressure from the trawling industry for Britain are reasons that both sides took actions that were of noticeable risk to their broader security interests. Interdepartmental competition and unilateral behaviour by individual diplomats were also factors, with the British Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries influencing the British government&#x27;s decision &quot;more than the Foreign Office&quot;.

A 2017 study argues that both a combination of powerful domestic pressures on statesmen to escalate and miscalculation by those statesmen contributed to the outbreak of the Cod Wars. The study argues that Iceland won each of the Cod Wars because Icelandic statesmen were too greatly constrained by domestic politics to offer compromises to the British, but British statesmen were not as constrained by public opinion at home.

== Lessons drawn for international relations ==
International relations scholars such as Robert Keohane, Joseph Nye, Hans Morgenthau, Henry Kissinger and Ned Lebow have written on the Cod Wars.

The 2016 review article finds that lessons from the Cod Wars have most commonly been applied to liberal and realist schools of international relations theory and theories on asymmetric bargaining. It claims that the Cod Wars are widely seen as inconsistent with the precepts of the liberal peace, since democracy, trade and institutions are supposed to pacify interstate behaviour. A 2017 study argues that the &quot;supposedly pacifying factors of the liberal peace – democracy, trade and institutional ties – effectively made the disputes more contentious&quot;. The Cod Wars are also held up as an example of the decreasing salience of hard power in international relations, with implications for realist theory which emphasizes the importance of hard power. Theorists on asymmetric bargaining have emphasized how Iceland, lacking structural power, can still have an issue power advantage, with its greater commitment to the cause.

==Legacy==
The 1976 agreement at the end of the Third Cod War forced the UK to abandon the &quot;open seas&quot; international fisheries policy it had previously promoted. The British Parliament passed the Fishery Limits Act 1976, declaring a similar 200-nautical-mile zone around its own shores, a practice later codified into the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which provided similar rights to every sovereign nation.

The victories in the Cod Wars may have strengthened Icelandic nationalism and boosted the perception that Iceland can succeed through unilateral or bilateral means rather than compromise in multilateral frameworks, such as membership of the European Union.

The Cod Wars are often mentioned in Icelandic and British news reporting when either state is involved in a fishery dispute or when there are disputes of some sort between the two countries. The Cod Wars were extensively covered by media during the Icesave dispute between Iceland and the UK, and in preparation for the Iceland–England match at the round of 16 in Euro 2016.

In February 2017, the crews of two ships involved in the Cod Wars, the Hull trawler &quot;Arctic Corsair&quot; and the Icelandic patrol ship ICGV &quot;Óðinn&quot;, exchanged bells in a gesture of goodwill and sign of friendship between the cities of Hull and Reykjavík. The event was part of a project by Hull Museums on the history between Iceland and the United Kingdom during and after the Cod Wars.

<text>Euskirchen () is a Kreis (district) in the south-west of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Neighboring districts are Aachen, Düren, Rhein-Erft-Kreis, Rhein-Sieg, Ahrweiler, Daun, Bitburg-Prüm, and the Liège province (Belgium).

==History==
In 1827 a first district around the city of Euskirchen was created, however much smaller than today. In 1932 the district of Rheinbach was dissolved, whereby the Euskirchen district gained its southern part. In 1972 the Euskirchen district grew again by the inclusion of the Schleiden district.

==Geography==
Geographically, the south-western half of the district is inside the Eifel hill chain. This land is hardly suitable for agriculture, and therefore in historical times the region was rather poor. Areas further to the north-east are more flat and have historically been used to grow a variety of crops, most notably sugar beets. The only other source of wealth was the iron ore, but today the many forests there make the area interesting for tourists.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms shows the four signs of the main historical territories or rulers of the district. Top-left are the roses of the counts of Arenberg, top-right the lion of Jülich, bottom-right the wave-line of the counts of Manderscheid-Blankenheim, and bottom-left the Cologne cross.
The coat of arms was granted in 1973.

<doc id="185369" wikidata="Q574801" url="?curid=185369" title="Sedation">
<text>Sedation is the reduction of irritability or agitation by administration of sedative drugs, generally to facilitate a medical procedure or diagnostic procedure. Examples of drugs which can be used for sedation include isoflurane, diethyl ether, propofol, etomidate, ketamine, pentobarbital, lorazepam and midazolam.

==Medical uses==
Sedation is typically used in minor surgical procedures such as endoscopy, vasectomy, or dentistry and for reconstructive surgery, some cosmetic surgeries, removal of wisdom teeth, or for high-anxiety patients. Sedation methods in dentistry include inhalation sedation (using nitrous oxide), oral sedation, and intravenous (IV) sedation. Inhalation sedation is also sometimes referred to as &quot;relative analgesia&quot;.

Sedation is also used extensively in the intensive care unit so that patients who are being ventilated tolerate having an endotracheal tube in their trachea. It can also be used during a long term brain EEG to help patient relax.

==Risks==
There are studies claiming that sedation accounts for 40 percent to 50 percent procedure-related complications. Airway obstruction, apnea, and hypotension are not uncommon during sedation and require the presence of health professionals who are suitably trained to detect and manage these problems. Aside from the respiratory depression, risks also include unintended levels of sedation, postoperative somnolence, aspiration, and adverse reactions to sedation medications. Complications could also include perforation, bleeding, and the stimulation of vasovagal reflexes. To avoid sedation risks, care providers conduct a thorough pre-sedation evaluation and this process includes pre-sedation history and physicals with emphasis on the determining characteristics that indicate potential risks to the patient and potential difficult airway management. This process can also reveal if the sedation period needs to be prolonged or additional therapeutic procedures are required.

==Levels of sedation==
Sedation scales are used in medical situations in conjunction with a medical history in assessing the applicable degree of sedation in patients in order to avoid under-sedation (the patient risks experiencing pain or distress) and over-sedation (the patient risks side effects such as suppression of breathing, which might lead to death).

Examples of sedation scales include MSAT (Minnesota Sedation Assessment Tool), UMSS (University of Michigan Sedation Scale), the Ramsay Scale (Ramsay, et al. 1974) and the RASS (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale).

The American Society of Anesthesiologists defines the continuum of sedation as follows:

* Minimal sedation normal response to verbal stimuli.
* Moderate sedation purposeful response to verbal/tactile stimulation. (This is usually referred to as &quot;conscious sedation&quot;)
* Deep sedation purposeful response to repeated or painful stimulation.
* General anesthesia unarousable even with painful stimulus.

In the United Kingdom, deep sedation is considered to be a part of the spectrum of general anesthesia, as opposed to conscious sedation.

In addition to the aforementioned precautions, patients should be interviewed to determine if they have any other condition that may lead to complications while undergoing treatment. Any head, neck, or spinal cord injuries should be noted as well as any diagnosis of osteoporosis.

==Intravenous sedation==
The most common standard conscious sedation technique for adults is intravenous sedation using Midazolam. This requires a needle to be put into a vein to deliver the medication; this is known as an IV cannula.

Indications:
* Reduced dental anxiety and phobia
* Traumatic or prolonged dental procedures
* Patients with gag reflex
* Medical conditions potentially aggravated by the stress of dental treatment
* Special care (mild intellectual or physical disability)
* Some disorders involving its spasticity due to its muscle relaxant properties

Contraindications:
* Uncooperative patient
* Psychologically immature individuals
* Patients unable to provide a suitable escort
* Difficult oral surgery or prolonged surgical procedure
* Muscle diseases or diseases which cause muscle wastage
* ASA III or above
* Allergy or hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines
* Pregnancy and breast feeding
* History of psychiatric disorders
* Kidney or liver dysfunction
* Acute pulmonary insufficiency
* Preexisting respiratory conditions as patients are susceptible to respiratory depression
* Alcohol or drug addiction
* Lack of visible superficial veins

== Sedation for pediatric patients ==

Present drugs commonly used to sedate children: Methohexital; Thiopental; Benzodiazepines; Diazepam; Midazolam; Ketamine; Opioids; Morphine; Meperidine; Fentanyl.

Whenever it is necessary to sedate a child, one must consider the type of procedure planned (painful or nonpainful), the duration of the procedure (important in choosing the appropriate sedative), the underlying medical condition of the patient (proper fasting, contracted blood volume, interaction with other medications, and intact mechanisms of drug elimination), the need for anxiolysis or narcosis, and experience with alternative techniques or routes of administration.

A child undergoing a procedure that is nonpainful (e.g., CT scan or small laceration infiltrated with local anesthetic) does not require a narcotic. Conversely, a child undergoing a painful procedure may require an opioid.

<text>Drooling, or slobbering, is the flow of saliva outside the mouth. Drooling can be caused by excess production of saliva, inability to retain saliva within the mouth (incontinence of saliva), or problems with swallowing (dysphagia or odynophagia).

There are some frequent and harmless cases of drooling – for instance, a numbed mouth from either benzocaine, or when going to the dentist&#x27;s office.

Isolated drooling in healthy infants and toddlers is normal and may be associated with teething. It is unlikely to be a sign of disease or complications. Drooling in infants and young children may be exacerbated by upper respiratory infections and nasal allergies.

Some people with drooling problems are at increased risk of inhaling saliva, food, or fluids into the lungs, especially if drooling is secondary to a neurological problem. However, if the body&#x27;s normal reflex mechanisms (such as gagging and coughing) are not impaired, this is not life-threatening.

== Causes ==
Drooling or sialorrhea can occur during sleep. It is often the result of open-mouth posture from CNS depressants intake or sleeping on one&#x27;s side. Sometimes while sleeping, saliva does not build up at the back of the throat and does not trigger the normal swallow reflex, leading to the condition. Freud conjectured that drooling occurs during deep sleep, and within the first few hours of falling asleep, since those who are affected by the symptom experience the most severe harm while napping, rather than during overnight sleep.

A &quot;sudden&quot; onset of drooling may indicate poisoning – especially by pesticides or mercury – or reaction to snake or insect venom. Excess capsaicin can cause drooling as well, an example being the ingestion of particularly high Scoville Unit chili peppers. Some neurological problems cause drooling. Medication can cause drooling, either due to primary action or side-effects; for example the pain-relief medication Orajel can numb the mucosa.

Causes include:
* exercise, especially cardiovascular exercise
* stroke and other neurological pathologies
* intellectual disability
* adenoid hypertrophy
* cerebral palsy
* amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
* tumors of the upper aerodigestive tract
* Parkinson&#x27;s disease
* rabies
* mercury poisoning

Drooling associated with fever or trouble swallowing may be a sign of an infectious disease including:
* retropharyngeal abscess
* peritonsillar abscess
* tonsilitis
* mononucleosis
* strep throat
* obstructive diseases (tumors, stenosis)
* inability to swallow due to neurodegenerative diseases (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis)
==Treatment==
A comprehensive treatment plan depends on the cause and incorporates several stages of care: Correction of reversible causes, behavior modification, medical treatment, and surgical procedures.

Atropine sulfate tablets are used in some circumstances to reduce salivation. The same for anticholinergic drugs which can be also a benefit because they decrease the activity of the acetylcholine muscarinic receptors and can result in decreased salivation. They may be prescribed by doctors in conjunction with behavior modification strategies. Other drugs used are glycopyrrolate and botulinum toxin A – botox injection in salivary glands to diminish saliva production.

In general, surgical procedures are considered after clear diagnosis of the cause and evaluation of non-invasive treatment options. Severe cases can be sometimes be treated by surgical intervention – salivary duct relocalization, or in extreme cases resection of salivary glands.

==Popular culture==
The scope of the meaning of the term &quot;drool&quot; in popular use has expanded to include any occasion wherein someone highly desires something.

<doc id="185373" wikidata="Q396013" url="?curid=185373" title="Agranulocytosis">
<text>Agranulocytosis, also known as agranulosis or granulopenia, is an acute condition involving a severe and dangerous lowered white blood cell count (leukopenia, most commonly of neutrophils) and thus causing neutropenia in the circulating blood. It is a severe lack of one major class of infection-fighting white blood cells. People with this condition are at very high risk of serious infections due to their suppressed immune system.

In agranulocytosis, the concentration of granulocytes (a major class of white blood cells that includes neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils) drops below 200 cells/mm3 of blood.

==Signs and symptoms==
Agranulocytosis may be asymptomatic, or may clinically present with sudden fever, rigors and sore throat. Infection of any organ may be rapidly progressive (e.g., pneumonia, urinary tract infection). Sepsis may also progress rapidly.

==Causes==
A large number of drugs have been associated with agranulocytosis, including antiepileptics (such as carbamazepine and valproate), antithyroid drugs (carbimazole, thiamazole, and propylthiouracil), antibiotics (penicillin, chloramphenicol and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole), H2 blockers (cimetidine, famotidine, nizatidine, ranitidine), ACE inhibitors (benazepril), cytotoxic drugs, gold salts, analgesics (aminophenazone, indomethacin, naproxen, phenylbutazone, metamizole), mebendazole, allopurinol, the antidepressants mianserin and mirtazapine, and some antipsychotics. The atypical antipsychotic clozapine in particular is largely restricted to treatment-resistant cases and mandatory blood count monitoring in most countries.

Although the reaction is generally idiosyncratic rather than proportional, experts recommend that patients using these drugs be told about the symptoms of agranulocytosis-related infection, such as a sore throat and a fever.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention traced outbreaks of agranulocytosis among cocaine users, in the US and Canada between March 2008 and November 2009, to the presence of levamisole in the drug supply. The Drug Enforcement Administration reported that, as of February 2010, 71% of seized cocaine lots coming into the US contained levamisole as a cutting agent. Levamisole is an antihelminthic (i.e. deworming) drug used in animals. The reason for adding levamisole to cocaine hydrochloride is unknown, although it is likely due to their similar melting points, solubilities, and appearance.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is made after a complete blood count, a routine blood test. The absolute neutrophil count in this test will be below 500, and can reach 0 cells/mm3. Other kinds of blood cells are typically present in normal numbers. To formally diagnose agranulocytosis, other pathologies with a similar presentation must be excluded, such as aplastic anemia, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, myelodysplasia and leukemias. This requires a bone marrow examination that shows normocellular (normal amounts and types of cells) blood marrow with underdeveloped promyelocytes. These underdeveloped promyelocytes, if fully matured, would have been the missing granulocytes.

===Classification===
The term &quot;agranulocytosis&quot; derives from the Greek: &quot;a&quot;, meaning without; granulocyte, a particular kind of white blood cell (containing granules in its cytoplasm); and &quot;osis&quot;, meaning condition [esp. disorder]. Consequently, agranulocytosis is sometimes described as &quot;no granulocytes&quot;, but a total absence is not required for diagnosis.
However, &quot;-osis&quot; is commonly used in blood disorders to imply cell proliferation (such as in &quot;leukocytosis&quot;), while &quot;-penia&quot; to imply reduced cell numbers (as in &quot;leukopenia&quot;); for these reasons, granulocytopenia is a more etymologically consistent term, and as such, is sometimes preferred to &quot;agranulocytosis&quot; (which can be misinterpreted as &quot;agranulocyt-osis&quot;, meaning proliferation of agranulocytes (i.e. lymphocytes and monocytes). Despite this, &quot;agranulocytosis&quot; remains the most widely used term for the condition.

The terms agranulocytosis, granulocytopenia and neutropenia are sometimes used interchangeably. Agranulocytosis implies a more severe deficiency than granulocytopenia. Neutropenia indicates a deficiency of neutrophils (the most common granulocyte cell) only.

To be precise, neutropenia is the term normally used to describe absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs) of less than 500 cells per microlitre, whereas agranulocytosis is reserved for cases with ANCs of less than 100 cells per microlitre.

The following terms can be used to specify the type of granulocyte referenced:
* Inadequate numbers of neutrophils: neutropenia (most common)
* Inadequate numbers of eosinophils: eosinopenia (uncommon)
* Inadequate numbers of basophils: basopenia (very rare)

In a general sense the pathogenesis of neutropenia can be divided into two categories;
* Inadequate or ineffective formation of granulocytes. This can be due to bone marrow failure associated with aplastic anemia, leukemia, or chemotherapeutic agents. There can also be isolated neutropenias where only differentiated granulocyte precursors are affected as in the case of neoplastic proliferation of cytotoxic T cells or NK cells
* Accelerated destruction of neutrophils. Immune-mediated reactions to neutrophils which can be caused by drugs. An enlarged spleen can lead to splenic sequestration and accelerated removal of neutrophils. Utilization of neutrophils can occur in infections

==Treatment==
In patients that have no symptoms of infection, management consists of close monitoring with serial blood counts, cessation of the offending agent (e.g., medication), and general advice on the significance of fever. Transfusion of granulocytes would be a solution to the problem. However, granulocytes live only ~10 hours in the circulation (for days in spleen or other tissue), which gives a very short-lasting effect. In addition, there are many complications of such a procedure.
