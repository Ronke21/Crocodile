<text>Leila Marie Koerber (November 9, 1868 – July 28, 1934), known professionally as Marie Dressler, was a Canadian-born stage and screen actress and comedian, who was popular in Hollywood in early silent and Depression-era film.

After leaving home at the age of 14, Dressler built a career on stage in traveling theatre troupes, where she learned to appreciate her talent in making people laugh. In 1892, she started a career on Broadway that lasted into the 1920s, performing comedic roles that allowed her to improvise to get laughs. She soon transitioned into screen acting and made several shorts, but mostly worked in New York City on stage. During World War I, along with other celebrities, she helped sell Liberty bonds.

In 1914, she played the title role in the first full-length screen comedy, &quot;Tillie&#x27;s Punctured Romance&quot; (1914), opposite Charlie Chaplin and Mabel Normand. In 1919, she helped organize the first union for stage chorus players. Her career declined in the 1920s, and Dressler was reduced to living on her savings while sharing an apartment with a friend.

In 1927, she returned to films at the age of 59 and experienced a remarkable string of successes. For her performance in the comedy film &quot;Min and Bill&quot; (1930), Dressler won the Academy Award for Best Actress. She died of cancer in 1934.

==Early life==
Dressler was born Leila Marie Koerber on November 9, 1868, in Cobourg, Ontario. She was one of the two daughters of Anna (&quot;née&quot; Henderson), a musician, and Alexander Rudolph Koerber (1826–1914), a German-born former officer in the Crimean War. Leila&#x27;s elder sister, Bonita Louise Koerber (1864–1939), later married playwright Richard Ganthony.

Her father was a music teacher in Cobourg and the organist at St. Peter&#x27;s Anglican Church, where as a child Marie would sing and assist in operating the organ. According to Dressler, the family regularly moved from community to community during her childhood. It has been suggested by Cobourg historian Andrew Hewson that Dressler attended a private school, but this is doubtful if Dressler&#x27;s recollections of the family&#x27;s genteel poverty are accurate.

The Koerber family eventually moved to the United States, where Alexander Koerber is known to have worked as a piano teacher in the late 1870s and early 1880s in Bay City and Saginaw (both in Michigan) as well as Findlay, Ohio. Her first known acting appearance, when she was five, was as Cupid in a church theatrical performance in Lindsay, Ontario. Residents of the towns where the Koerbers lived recalled Dressler acting in many amateur productions, and Leila often irritated her parents with those performances.

==Stage career==
Dressler left home at the age of 14 to begin her acting career with the Nevada Stock Company, telling the company she was actually 18. The pay was either $6 or $8 per week, and Dressler sent half to her mother. At this time, Dressler adopted the name of an aunt as her stage name. According to Dressler, her father objected to her using the name of Koerber. The identity of the aunt was never confirmed, although Dressler denied that she adopted the name from a store awning. Dressler&#x27;s sister Bonita, five years older, left home at about the same time. Bonita also worked in the opera company. The Nevada Stock Company was a travelling company that played mostly in the American Midwest. Dressler described the troupe as a &quot;wonderful school in many ways. Often a bill was changed on an hour&#x27;s notice or less. Every member of the cast had to be a quick study&quot;. Dressler made her professional debut as a chorus girl named Cigarette in the play &quot;Under Two Flags&quot;, a dramatization of life in the Foreign Legion.

She remained with the troupe for three years, while her sister left to marry playwright Richard Ganthony. The company eventually ended up in a small Michigan town without money or a booking. Dressler joined the Robert Grau Opera Company, which toured the Midwest, and she received an improvement in pay to $8 per week, although she claimed she never received any wages.

Dressler ended up in Philadelphia, where she joined the Starr Opera Company as a member of the chorus. A highlight with the Starr company was portraying Katisha in &quot;The Mikado&quot; when the regular actress was unable to go on, due to a sprained ankle, according to Dressler. She was also known to have played the role of Princess Flametta in an 1887 production in Ann Arbor, Michigan. She left the Starr company to return home to her parents in Saginaw. According to her, when the Bennett and Moulton Opera Company came to town, she was chosen from the church choir by the company&#x27;s manager and asked to join the company. Dressler remained with the company for three years, again on the road, playing roles of light opera.

She later particularly recalled specially the role of Barbara in &quot;The Black Hussars&quot;, which she especially liked, in which she would hit a baseball into the stands. Dressler remained with the company until 1891, gradually increasing in popularity. She moved to Chicago and was cast in productions of &quot;Little Robinson Crusoe&quot; and &quot;The Tar and the Tartar&quot;. After the touring production of &quot;The Tar and the Tartar&quot; came to a close, she moved to New York City.

In 1892, Dressler made her debut on Broadway at the Fifth Avenue Theatre in &quot;Waldemar, the Robber of the Rhine&quot;, which only lasted five weeks. She had hoped to become an operatic diva or tragedienne, but the writer of &quot;Waldemar&quot;, Maurice Barrymore, convinced her to accept that her best success was in comedy roles. Years later, she appeared in motion pictures with his sons, Lionel and John, and became good friends with his daughter, actress Ethel Barrymore. In 1893, she was cast as the Duchess in &quot;Princess Nicotine&quot;, where she met and befriended Lillian Russell.

Dressler now made $50 per week, with which she supported her parents. She moved on into roles in &quot;1492 Up to Date&quot;, &quot;Girofle-Girofla&quot;, and &quot;A Stag Party, or A Hero in Spite of Himself&quot; After &quot;A Stag Party&quot; flopped, she joined the touring Camille D&#x27;Arville Company on a tour of the Midwest in &quot;Madeleine, or The Magic Kiss&quot;, as Mary Doodle, a role giving her a chance to clown.

In 1896, Dressler landed her first starring role as Flo in George Lederer&#x27;s production of &quot;The Lady Slavey&quot; at the Casino Theatre on Broadway, co-starring British dancer Dan Daly. It was a great success, playing for two years at the Casino. Dressler became known for her hilarious facial expressions, seriocomic reactions, and double takes. With her large, strong body, she could improvise routines in which she would carry Daly, to the delight of the audience.

Dressler&#x27;s success enabled her to purchase a home for her parents on Long Island. The &quot;Lady Slavey&quot; success turned sour when she quit the production while it toured in Colorado. The Erlanger syndicate blocked her from appearing on Broadway, and she chose to work with the Rich and Harris touring company. Dressler returned to Broadway in &quot;Hotel Topsy Turvy&quot; and &quot;The Man in the Moon&quot;.

She formed her own theatre troupe in 1900, which performed George V. Hobart&#x27;s &quot;Miss Prinnt&quot; in cities of the northeastern U.S. The production was a failure, and Dressler was forced to declare bankruptcy. In 1901 she starred as Anna of Austria, Queen of Spain in the Broadway musical comedy &quot;The King&#x27;s Carnival&quot;.

In 1904, she signed a three-year, $50,000 contract with the Weber and Fields Music Hall management, performing lead roles in &quot;Higgledy-Piggledy&quot; and &quot;Twiddle Twaddle&quot;. After her contract expired she performed vaudeville in New York, Boston, and other cities. Dressler was known for her full-figured body, and contemporaries included her friends Lillian Russell, Fay Templeton, May Irwin and Trixie Friganza. Dressler herself was tall and weighed .

In 1907, she met James Henry &quot;Jim&quot; Dalton. The two moved to London, where Dressler performed at the Palace Theatre of Varieties for $1500 per week. After that, she planned to mount a show herself in the West End. In 1909, with members of the Weber organization, she staged a modified production of &quot;Higgeldy Piggeldy&quot; at the Aldwych Theatre, renaming the production &quot;Philopoena&quot; after her own role. It was a failure, closing after one week. She lost $40,000 on the production, a debt she eventually repaid in 1930. She and Dalton returned to New York. Dressler declared bankruptcy for a second time.

She returned to the Broadway stage in a show called &quot;The Boy and the Girl&quot;, but it lasted only a few weeks. She moved on to perform vaudeville at Young&#x27;s Pier in Atlantic City for the summer. In addition to her stage work, Dressler recorded for Edison Records in 1909 and 1910. In the fall of 1909, she entered rehearsals for a new play, &quot;Tillie&#x27;s Nightmare&quot;. The play toured in Albany, Chicago, Kansas City, and Philadelphia, and was a flop. Dressler helped to revise the show, without the authors&#x27; permission, and in order to keep the changes she had to threaten to quit before the play opened on Broadway. Her revisions helped make it a big success there. Biographer Betty Lee considers the play the high point of her stage career.

Dressler continued to work in the theater during the 1910s, and toured the United States during World War I, selling Liberty bonds and entertaining the American Expeditionary Forces. American infantrymen in France named both a street and a cow after Dressler. The cow was killed, leading to &quot;Marie Dressler: Killed in Line of Duty&quot; headlines, about which Dressler (paraphrasing Mark Twain) quipped, &quot;I had a hard time convincing people that the report of my death had been greatly exaggerated.&quot;
After the war, Dressler returned to vaudeville in New York, and toured in Cleveland and Buffalo. She owned the rights to the play &quot;Tillie&#x27;s Nightmare&quot;, the play upon which her 1914 movie &quot;Tillie&#x27;s Punctured Romance&quot; was based. Her husband Jim Dalton and she made plans to self-finance a revival of the play. The play fizzled in the summer of 1920, and the production was disbanded. In 1919, during the Actors&#x27; Equity strike in New York City, the Chorus Equity Association was formed and voted Dressler its first president.

Dressler accepted a role in &quot;Cinderella on Broadway&quot; in October 1920, but the play failed after only a few weeks. She signed on for a role in &quot;The Passing Show of 1921&quot;, but left the cast after only a few weeks. She returned to the vaudeville stage with the Schubert Organization, traveling through the Midwest. Dalton traveled with her, although he was very ill from kidney failure. He stayed in Chicago while she traveled on to St. Louis and Milwaukee. He died while Marie was in St.Louis, and Marie then left the tour. His body was claimed by his ex-wife, and he was buried in the Dalton plot.

After failing to sell a film script, Dressler took an extended trip to Europe in the fall of 1922. On her return she found it difficult to find work, considering America to be &quot;youth-mad&quot; and &quot;flapper-crazy&quot;. She busied herself with visits to veteran hospitals. To save money she moved into the Ritz Hotel, arranging for a small room at a discount. In 1923, Dressler received a small part in a revue at the Winter Garden Theatre, titled &quot;The Dancing Girl&quot;, but was not offered any work after the show closed. In 1925, she was able to perform as part of the cast of a vaudeville show which went on a five-week tour, but still could not find any work back in New York City. The following year, she made a final appearance on Broadway as part of an Old Timers&#x27; bill at the Palace Theatre.

Early in 1930, Dressler joined Edward Everett Horton&#x27;s theater troupe in Los Angeles to play a princess in Ferenc Molnár&#x27;s &quot;The Swan&quot;, but after one week, she quit the troupe. Later that year she played the princess-mother of Lillian Gish&#x27;s character in the 1930 film adaptation of Molnar&#x27;s play, titled &quot;One Romantic Night&quot;.

==Film career==

Dressler had appeared in two shorts as herself, but her first role in a feature film came in 1914 at the age of 44. In 1902, she had met fellow Canadian Mack Sennett and helped him get a job in the theater. After Sennett became the owner of his namesake motion picture studio, he convinced Dressler to star in his 1914 silent film &quot;Tillie&#x27;s Punctured Romance&quot;. The film was to be the first full-length, six-reel motion picture comedy. According to Sennett, a prospective budget of $200,000 meant that he needed &quot;a star whose name and face meant something to every possible theatre-goer in the United States and the British Empire.&quot;

The movie was based on Dressler&#x27;s hit &quot;Tillie&#x27;s Nightmare&quot;. She claimed to have cast Charlie Chaplin in the movie as her leading man, and was &quot;proud to have had a part in giving him his first big chance.&quot; Instead of his recently invented Tramp character, Chaplin played a villainous rogue. Silent film comedian Mabel Normand also starred in the movie. &quot;Tillie&#x27;s Punctured Romance&quot; was a hit with audiences, and Dressler appeared in two &quot;Tillie&quot; sequels and other comedies until 1918, when she returned to vaudeville.

In 1922, after her husband&#x27;s death, Dressler and writers Helena Dayton and Louise Barrett tried to sell a script to the Hollywood studios, but were turned down. The one studio to hold a meeting with the group rejected the script, saying all the audiences wanted is &quot;young love&quot;. The proposed co-star of Lionel Barrymore or George Arliss were rejected as &quot;old fossils&quot;. In 1925, Dressler filmed a pair of two-reel short movies in Europe for producer Harry Reichenbach. The movies, titled the &quot;Travelaffs&quot;, were not released and were considered a failure by both Dressler and Reichenbach. Dressler announced her retirement from show business.
In early 1927, Dressler received a lifeline from director Allan Dwan. Although versions differ as to how Dressler and Dwan met, including that Dressler was contemplating suicide, Dwan offered her a part in a film he was planning to make in Florida. The film, &quot;The Joy Girl&quot;, an early color production, only provided a small part. Her scenes were finished in two days, so Dressler returned to New York upbeat after her experience with the production.

Later that year, Frances Marion, a screenwriter for the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) studio, came to Dressler&#x27;s rescue. Marion had seen Dressler in the 1925 vaudeville tour and witnessed Dressler at her professional low-point. Dressler had shown great kindness to Marion during the filming of &quot;Tillie Wakes Up&quot; in 1917, and in return, Marion used her influence with MGM&#x27;s production chief Irving Thalberg to return Dressler to the screen. Her first MGM feature was &quot;The Callahans and the Murphys&quot; (1927), a rowdy silent comedy co-starring Dressler (as Ma Callahan) with another former Mack Sennett comedian, Polly Moran, written by Marion.

The film was initially a success, but the portrayal of Irish characters caused a protest in the &quot;Irish World&quot; newspaper, protests by the American Irish Vigilance Committee, and pickets outside the film&#x27;s New York theatre. The film was first cut by MGM in an attempt to appease the Irish community, then eventually pulled from release after Cardinal Dougherty of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia called MGM president Nicholas Schenck. It was not shown again, and the negative and prints may have been destroyed. While the film brought Dressler to Hollywood, it did not re-establish her career. Her next appearance was a minor part in the First National film &quot;Breakfast at Sunrise&quot;. She appeared again with Moran in &quot;Bringing Up Father&quot;, another film written by Marion. Dressler returned to MGM in 1928&#x27;s &quot;The Patsy&quot; as the mother of the characters played by stars Marion Davies and Jane Winton.

Hollywood was converting from silent films, but &quot;talkies&quot; presented no problems for Dressler, whose rumbling voice could handle both sympathetic scenes and snappy comebacks (the wisecracking stage actress in &quot;Chasing Rainbows&quot; and the dubious matron in Rudy Vallée&#x27;s &quot;Vagabond Lover&quot;). Frances Marion persuaded Thalberg to give Dressler the role of Marthy in the 1930 film &quot;Anna Christie&quot;. Garbo and the critics were impressed by Dressler&#x27;s acting ability, and so was MGM, which quickly signed her to a $500-per-week contract. Dressler went on to act in comedic films which were popular with movie-goers and a lucrative investment for MGM. She became Hollywood&#x27;s number-one box-office attraction, and stayed on top until her death in 1934.

She also took on serious roles. For &quot;Min and Bill&quot;, with Wallace Beery, she won the 1930–31 Academy Award for Best Actress (the eligibility years were staggered at that time). She was nominated again for Best Actress for her 1932 starring role in &quot;Emma&quot;, but lost to Helen Hayes. Dressler followed these successes with more hits in 1933, including the comedy &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot;, in which she played an aging but vivacious former stage actress. Dressler had a memorable bit with Jean Harlow in the film:
Harlow: I was reading a book the other day.
Dressler: Reading a book?
Harlow: Yes, it&#x27;s all about civilization or something. A nutty kind of a book. Do you know that the guy said that machinery is going to take the place of &quot;every&quot; profession?
Dressler: Oh my dear, &quot;that&#x27;s&quot; something &quot;you&quot; need never worry about.

Following the release of &quot;Tugboat Annie&quot; Dressler appeared on the cover of Time in its issue dated August 7, 1933. Despite glamour actresses such as Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, or Norma Shearer MGM&#x27;s most prominent female star at the time was Dressler. The aging star consistently packed movie theaters with hits like &quot;Min and Bill&quot;, &quot;Emma&quot;, and &quot;Tugboat Annie&quot;. An exhibitors&#x27; poll in the January 1933 issue of Motion Picture Herald had Dressler as the number-one box office star in Hollywood.

Coming to movie stardom late, Dressler had no pretensions and a delightful sense of humor. Once, when visiting William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s California palace San Simeon, a monkey pelted her with some of his excrement. Dressler responded, &quot;Oh, a critic!&quot;.

Dressler was very grateful for her career&#x27;s late resurgence. While working on two films with Wallace Beery, &quot;Tugboat Annie&quot; and &quot;Min and Bill,&quot; she refused to take nonsense from the notorious &quot;son of a bitch&quot;. In response to one of Beery&#x27;s insults, she said, &quot;look you silly shit, you pull one more thing like that on me and I&#x27;ll have your head. On a platter. And not an expensive platter. A little, cheap, lousy, wooden platter. Like John the Baptist. With a personal note to L.B. Mayer.&quot;

Dressler&#x27;s newly regenerated career came to an abrupt end when she was diagnosed with terminal cancer in the early 1930s. MGM studio head Louis B. Mayer learned of Dressler&#x27;s illness from her doctor (who didn&#x27;t even tell Dressler of her condition). The studio chief took it upon himself to take charge of Dressler&#x27;s health. To keep her home, he ordered her not to travel, forcing her to miss a charity event in New York. Although furious, Dressler complied. She only learned about her condition six months later. After some experimental cancer therapy, Dressler returned to work under limitations enforced by Mayer. For the rest of her career, the actress only worked three hours a day and had mandatory stand-ins wherever possible. Before she died in July 1934, Dressler starred in three more features, including &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot;.

She appeared in more than 40 films, and achieved her greatest successes in talking pictures made during the last years of her life. The first of her two autobiographies, &quot;The Life Story of an Ugly Duckling&quot;, was published in 1924. A second book, &quot;My Own Story&quot;, &quot;as told to Mildred Harrington&quot;, appeared a few months after her death.

==Personal life==
Dressler&#x27;s first marriage was to an American, George Francis Hoeppert (1862 – September 7, 1929), a theatrical manager. His surname is sometimes given as Hopper. The couple married on May 6, 1894, in Grace Church Rectory, Greenville, New Jersey, as biographer Matthew Kennedy wrote, under her birth name, Leila Marie Koerber. In 1904, Dressler adopted an incubator baby girl and named her Marie Dressler.

Her marriage to Hoeppert gave Dressler U.S. citizenship, which was useful later in life, when immigration rules meant permits were needed to work in the United States, and Dressler had to appear before an immigration hearing. Ever since her start in the theatre, Dressler had sent a portion of her salary to her parents. Her success on Broadway meant she could afford to buy a home and later a farm on Long Island, which she shared with her parents. Dressler made several attempts to set up theatre companies or theatre productions of her own using her Broadway proceeds, but these failed and she had to declare bankruptcy several times.

In 1907, Dressler met a Maine businessman, James Henry &quot;Jim&quot; Dalton, who became her companion until his death on November 29, 1921, at the Congress Hotel in Chicago from diabetes. According to Dalton, the two were married in Europe in 1908. However, according to Dressler&#x27;s U.S. passport application, the couple married in May 1904 in Italy.

Dressler reportedly later learned that the &quot;minister&quot; who had married them in Monte Carlo was actually a local man paid by Dalton to stage a fake wedding. Dalton&#x27;s first wife, Lizzie Augusta Britt Dalton, claimed he had not consented to a divorce or been served divorce papers, although Dalton claimed to have divorced her in 1905. By 1921, Dalton had become an invalid due to diabetes mellitus, and watched her from the wings in his wheelchair. After his death that year, Dressler was planning for Dalton to be buried as her husband, but Lizzie Dalton had Dalton&#x27;s body returned to be buried in the Dalton family plot.

After Dalton&#x27;s death, which coincided with a decline in her stage career, Dressler moved into a servant&#x27;s room in the Ritz Hotel to save money. Eventually, she moved in with friend Nella Webb to save on expenses. After finding work in film again in 1927, she rented a home in Hollywood on Hillside Avenue. Although Dressler was working from 1927 on, she was still reportedly living hand to mouth. In November 1928, wealthy friends Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Neurmberg gave her $10,000, explaining they planned to give her a legacy someday, but they thought she needed the money immediately. In 1929, she moved to Los Angeles to 6718 Milner Road in Whitley Heights, then to 623 North Bedford Drive in Beverly Hills, both rentals. She moved to her final home at 801 North Alpine in Beverly Hills in 1932, a home which she bought from the estate of King C. Gillette. During her seven years in Hollywood, Dressler lived with her maid Mamie Cox and later Mamie&#x27;s husband Jerry.

==Miscellanea==
Although atypical in size for a Hollywood star, Dressler was reported in 1931 to use the services of a &quot;body sculptor to the stars&quot;, Sylvia of Hollywood, to keep herself at a steady weight.

Biographers Betty Lee and Matthew Kennedy document Dressler&#x27;s long-standing friendship with actress Claire Du Brey, whom she met in 1928. Dressler and Du Brey&#x27;s falling out in 1931 was followed by a later lawsuit by Du Brey, who had been trained as a nurse, claiming back wages as Dressler&#x27;s nurse.

==Death==
On Saturday, July 28, 1934, Dressler died of cancer, aged 65, in Santa Barbara, California. After a private funeral held at The Wee Kirk o&#x27; the Heather chapel, she was interred in a crypt in the Great Mausoleum in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale, California.

Dressler left an estate worth $310,000, the bulk left to her sister Bonita. She bestowed her 1933 Duesenberg Model J automobile and $35,000 to her maid of 20 years, Mamie Steele Cox, and $15,000 to Cox&#x27;s husband, Jerry R. Cox, who had served as Dressler&#x27;s butler for four years. Dressler intended that the funds should be used to provide a place of comfort for black travelers, and the Coxes used the funds to open the &quot;Coconut Grove&quot; night club and adjacent tourist cabins in Savannah, Georgia, in 1936, named after the night club in Los Angeles.

==Legacy==

Dressler&#x27;s birth home in Cobourg, Ontario, is known as Marie Dressler House and is open to the public. The home was converted to a restaurant in 1937 and operated as a restaurant until 1989, when it was damaged by fire. It was restored, but did not open again as a restaurant. It was the office of the Cobourg Chamber of Commerce until its conversion to its current use as a museum about Dressler and as a visitor information office for Cobourg. Each year, the Marie Dressler Foundation Vintage Film Festival is held, with screenings in Cobourg and in Port Hope, Ontario. A play about the life of Marie Dressler called &quot;Queen Marie&quot; was written by Shirley Barrie and produced at 4th Line Theatre in 2012 and Alumnae Theatre in 2018.

For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Dressler has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1731 Vine Street, added in 1960. After &quot;Min and Bill&quot;, Dressler and Beery added their footprints to the cement forecourt of Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, with the inscription &quot;America&#x27;s New Sweethearts, Min and Bill.&quot;

Canada Post, as part of its &quot;Canada in Hollywood&quot; series, issued a postage stamp on June 30, 2008, to honour Marie Dressler.

Dressler is beloved in Seattle. She played in two films based on historical Seattle characters. &quot;Tugboat Annie&quot; (1933) was loosely based on Thea Foss, of Seattle. Likewise Hattie Burns, in &quot;Politics&quot; (1931), was based on Bertha Knight Landes, the first woman to become mayor of Seattle.

Dressler&#x27;s 152nd birthday was commemorated in a Google Doodle on November 9, 2020.

<text>A Patch of Blue is a 1965 American drama film directed and written by Guy Green about the friendship between an educated black man (played by Sidney Poitier) and an illiterate, blind, white 18-year-old girl (played by Elizabeth Hartman in her film debut), and the problems that plague their friendship in a racially divided America. Made in 1965 against the backdrop of the growing civil rights movement, the film explores racism while playing on the idea that &quot;love is blind.&quot;

Shelley Winters won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, her second win for the award, following her victory in 1959 for &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot;. It was the final screen appearance for veteran actor Wallace Ford.

Scenes of Poitier and Hartman kissing were cut from the film when it was shown in film theaters in the Southern United States. These scenes are intact in the DVD version. According to the DVD audio commentary, it was the decision of director Guy Green that &quot;A Patch of Blue&quot; be filmed in black and white although color was available.

The film was adapted by Guy Green from the 1961 book &quot;Be Ready with Bells and Drums&quot; by the Australian author Elizabeth Kata. The book later won a Writers Guild of America award. The book&#x27;s plot has a slightly less optimistic ending than the film.

In addition to the Best Supporting Actress win for Winters, the film was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Elizabeth Hartman), Best Art Direction-Set Decoration (Black-and-White) (George Davis, Urie McCleary, Henry Grace, Charles S. Thompson), Best Cinematography (Black-and-White) and Best Music (Original Music Score). Hartman, 22 at the time, was the youngest Best Actress nominee, a record she held for 10 years before 20-year-old Isabelle Adjani broke her record in 1975.

== Plot ==
Selina D&#x27;Arcey is a blind white girl living in a city apartment with her crude and vulgar mother Rose-Ann, who works as a prostitute, and her grandfather Ole Pa. She strings beads to supplement her family&#x27;s small income and spends most of her time doing chores. Her mother is abusive, and Ole Pa is an alcoholic. Selina has no friends, rarely leaves the apartment, and has never received an education.

Selina convinces her grandfather to take her to the park, where she meets Gordon Ralfe, an educated and soft-spoken black man working night shifts in an office. The two become friends, meeting at the park almost every day. Gordon learns that she was blinded at age five when Rose-Ann threw chemicals on her while attempting to hit her husband and that she was raped by one of Rose-Ann&#x27;s &quot;boyfriends.&quot;

Rose-Ann&#x27;s friend Sadie is also a prostitute, and she realizes that Selina can be useful in their business. Rose-Ann and Sadie decide to leave Ole Pa, move with Selina into a better apartment, and force her into prostitution.

In the meantime, Gordon has contacted a school for the blind, which is ready to take Selina. While Rose-Ann is out, Selina runs away to the park and meets Gordon. She tells him about Rose-Ann&#x27;s plan, and he assures her that she will be leaving for school in a few days. Finding Selina missing from the apartment, Rose-Ann takes Ole Pa to the park and confronts Gordon. Despite Rose-Ann&#x27;s resistance, Gordon takes Selina away. Ole Pa then stops Rose-Ann from chasing after them, telling her that Selina is not a child anymore.

At Gordon&#x27;s house, Selina asks Gordon to marry her, to which he replies that there are many types of love, and she will realize that their relationship will not work. Selina tells him that she loves him and knows that he is black and his skin color doesn&#x27;t matter to her. Gordon tells her she must meet more people and wait a year to find out whether their love is more than friendship. A bus arrives to pick up Selina for her trip to the school, and the two say goodbye. Gordon has given Selina a music box that belonged to his grandmother. When she leaves it in the apartment, he runs after her to give it back but misses the bus and walks back upstairs to his apartment building.

==Cast==
==Production==
Guy Green bought the rights to himself. He made the film at MGM after another film he was going to make for that studio, &quot;The Forty Days of Musa Dagh&quot;, did not happen.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
The New York Times was critical: &quot;There is no doubt about the good intentions of those who produced &#x27;A Patch of Blue,&#x27;...But for the most part this little drama...seems a compound of specious contrivance. Miss Hartman...is just a wee bit too tidy and sweet...The action is too patly formulated, and Mr. Poitier, who is an honest performer, has to act like a saint. Why should it be, in a film of this nature...that the cold-water flat in which the heroine lives...looks like any phony slum apartment fabricated by the art department of a studio? And why should it be that the tune the girl is humming when the man comes upon her in the park is &#x27;Over the Rainbow?&#x27; Why should they leap and frolic like a couple of Disney kids on a shopping spree in a supermarket? And why should she discover a French music box that plays a little tune that he sings, in French, when she first visits his apartment? These are small things, but many more like them, strung together in a get-this-clearly way, give an air of artificial fictionalizing to what should be a casual, gritty, human, throbbing film.&quot;

The Chicago Tribune wrote: &quot;That storied shrew, the Wicked Stepmother, is back again. This time she&#x27;s played by Shelley Winters, who is not actually a step relative...but is wicked enough to make anyone see red...Not woman enough to do a solo set in sadism, Shelley shares her apartment with another Mean Person, a gin-guzzling grandfather...The park is the girl&#x27;s salvation, for there she meets a young man who opens up a new world to her. As played by Sidney Poitier, he is both kind and practical, never patronizing...As Selina, newcome Hartman extracts what she can from the mawkish, melodramatic script and effectively captures the personality nuances of the pale, gaunt girl whose frightened-rabbit isolation in the bleak apartment is transformed into a childlike exuberance in the park where a patch of green becomes her patch of blue.&quot;

The &quot;Time&quot; magazine review was mixed: &quot;&#x27;A Patch of Blue&#x27; takes some getting used to. It starts as a pointless little tearjerker, then turns abruptly into contemporary hope opera. To save it from itself requires extraordinary skill, and the movie is fortunate in having miracle workers at hand...Luckily, Director Guy Green...has a knack for sustaining the sort of idea that in lesser hands might easily slip from pathos into bathos. Green&#x27;s style is simple, forceful and true, and he habitually activates a performer&#x27;s most astonishing inner resources. The prize of his present cast is 21-year-old film fledgling Elizabeth Hartman...Patch of Blue flirts openly with the issue of interracial love, only to leave it unresolved in the last reel, and the film&#x27;s message becomes almost immaterial. In their quiet, tender scenes together, Hartman and Poitier conquer the insipidity of a plot that reduces tangled human problems to a case of the black leading the blind.&quot;

&quot;A Patch of Blue&quot; has a 89% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on nine reviews.

===Box-office===
The film proved to be the most successful in Poitier&#x27;s career, which proved a lucrative development considering he agreed to a salary cut in exchange for 10% of the film&#x27;s gross earnings. In addition, the film made Poitier a major national film star with excellent business in even southern cities like Houston, Atlanta and Charlotte.

===Awards and nominations===
==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack to &quot;A Patch of Blue&quot; was composed and conducted by Jerry Goldsmith. It gained Goldsmith his second Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score following his score to &quot;&quot; in 1962. It was one of the 250 nominated scores for the American Film Institute&#x27;s top 25 American film scores. The score has been released three times on CD; in 1991 through Mainstream Records (with the score to &quot;David and Lisa&quot; by Mark Lawrence), in 1992 through Tsunami Records (with his score to &quot;Patton&quot;), and an extended version in 1997 through Intrada Records.

==&quot;A Cinderella Named Elizabeth&quot;==
The film&#x27;s creators also made a short film about Hartman&#x27;s selection to play the starring role. The short, titled &quot;A Cinderella Named Elizabeth,&quot; focuses on her status as an unknown actress from Youngstown, Ohio, and includes segments from her screen test and associated &quot;personality test&quot;, in which the actress is filmed while being herself and answering questions about everyday topics such as her taste in clothing. The short also shows her visiting the Braille Institute of America to watch blind people being trained to do handwork – similar to the beadwork her character does in the film – and to perform tasks of daily living and self-care, of the sort that Poitier&#x27;s character teaches Selina to do.

<text>Min and Bill is a 1930 American pre-Code comedy-drama film, directed by George W. Hill and starring Marie Dressler and Wallace Beery. Adapted by Frances Marion and Marion Jackson from Lorna Moon&#x27;s 1929 novel &quot;Dark Star&quot;, the film tells the story of dockside innkeeper Min&#x27;s tribulations as she tries to protect the innocence of her adopted daughter, Nancy, while loving and fighting with boozy fisherman Bill, who resides at the inn. The picture was a runaway hit. In 1931, the studio released a Spanish-language version of &quot;Min and Bill&quot;, &quot;La fruta amarga&quot;, directed by Arthur Gregor and starring Virginia Fábregas and Juan de Landa.

&quot;Min and Bill&quot; stars Dressler (Min), Beery (Bill), Dorothy Jordan (Nancy), and Marjorie Rambeau (Bella, Nancy&#x27;s disreputable mother). Dressler won the Academy Award for Best Actress in 1931 for her performance in this film. Beery received the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1931 for playing the title role in &quot;The Champ&quot;, which “fully vaulted him from character player to genuine movie star.”

Beery became MGM&#x27;s highest-paid actor in the early 1930s, before Clark Gable took over that crown; Beery had a clause in his 1932 contract that he be paid a dollar per year more than any other actor on the lot.

In 1933, the studio teamed Dressler and Beery as a married couple in &quot;Tugboat Annie&quot;, which was also a huge success. In 1933, Dressler topped Quigley Publications&#x27; annual Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll of movie exhibitors in 1931 and 1932. She died of cancer in July 1934.


==Plot==
Min Divot (Marie Dressler) runs a dockside inn. She has been raising Nancy Smith (Dorothy Jordan) as her own since her prostitute mother, Bella (Marjorie Rambeau), left her at the inn as an infant. Min frequently argues with fisherman Bill (Wallace Beery). Despite Bill&#x27;s near-constant drinking, Min and he care for each other. Bill and she are the only ones who know the identity of Nancy&#x27;s real, still living, mother.

Min does her best to raise Nancy and keep her from learning about the real activities of the people who live and work on the docks. Despite not having much extra money or a home outside her inn, Min does her best to raise Nancy into a young lady. She does everything she can to make sure Nancy is never around when Bella arrives for a visit.

Nancy loves Min as her own mother and frequently skips school to be with her. After repeatedly dealing with the truant officer, Min uses the money she had hidden in her room to send Nancy to a fancy boarding school. She hopes the school will teach Nancy better manners than those she had been picking up from Bill and the others on the docks. The schooling works, and Nancy returns to Min with good manners, an education, and the news that she is now engaged to a very wealthy man named Dick Cameron. She wants Min to attend the wedding.

Min is thrilled, until she finds out that Bella has returned. Seeing how happy Nancy is to be getting married (and the wedding will be taking place in a few days), Min deliberately argues with Nancy and says terrible things she does not mean for Nancy to immediately leave. She is mad at herself for hurting Nancy, but is relieved that she is gone by the time Bella arrives. Min stalls Bella, hoping the wedding will take place and the couple can leave for their honeymoon before Bella can interfere.

Bella arrives as the ceremony takes place. She confronts Min in an upstairs room in her inn. She has discovered her daughter&#x27;s identity, and that of her very wealthy new husband. She taunts Min with the information and pledges to torment Nancy and her new husband until they give her money and take her into their new home.

Min thinks about the wedding and Nancy&#x27;s happiness, and tries to prevent Bella from leaving. When Bella attacks Min with a hot curling iron and attempts to leave, Min takes a hidden gun and shoots her dead. Min drops the gun and flees the room. Bill, knowing what was going on, tries to help Min by pleading with her to drive down to Mexico on his boat. Once Min and Bill leave the inn for the boat, an eavesdropping sailor enters Min&#x27;s room and discovers Bella&#x27;s corpse. Just as Min and Bill are about to board Bill&#x27;s boat, however, Min sees Nancy and Dick Cameron about to board a boat to their honeymoon, and is drawn silently to the happy couple. She wants to see Nancy one last time. Min watches, but decides not to let Nancy know she is there, and stays hidden in the crowd. Two police officers quietly confront Min about the shooting at the inn. Min does not say much. She takes one final look at a smiling Nancy as she leaves with her husband. Min turns back and smiles as she quietly walks away with the officers. She is sad that it may be the last time she ever sees Nancy, but at the same time, she is happy that Nancy managed to escape a dead-end life by the docks. Bill watches helplessly.

<text>The Vizsla (), also known as Hungarian Vizsla, Magyar Vizsla or Hungarian Pointer, is a dog breed from Hungary and belongs to the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) group 7 (Pointing Dogs), the Canadian Kennel Club (CKC) group 1 (Sporting group), and the American Kennel Club (Sporting group). The Hungarian or Magyar Vizsla or Smooth-Haired Vizsla are sporting dogs and loyal companions. The Vizsla&#x27;s medium size is one of the breed&#x27;s most appealing characteristics. As a hunter of fowl and upland game, the Vizsla has held a prominent position among sporting dogs – that of household companion and family dog.

The Hungarian Vizsla is a versatile hunting dog that was traditionally and is currently used to hunt, point, and retrieve, referring to the dog&#x27;s natural ability in tracking, pointing, and retrieving game, including in water. Although they are lively, gentle-mannered, demonstrably affectionate and sensitive, they are also fearless and possess a well-developed protective instinct.

==Description==
===Appearance===
The Hungarian Vizsla is a short-coated hunting dog of distinguished appearance and bearing. Robust, but rather lightly built, they are lean dogs that have defined muscles.

Various breeds are often mistaken for Vizslas and vice versa. Redbone Coonhounds, Weimaraners and Rhodesian Ridgebacks are most commonly mixed up. The body structure of a Vizsla is very similar in appearance to a Weimaraner and a Redbone Coonhound, though the Vizsla is typically leaner with a more defined musculature. Weimaraners and Rhodesian Ridgebacks are generally larger than Vizslas.

The nose of the Vizsla will usually be a reddish color that blends with the coat color. Black, brown, light pink, or another color nose is an indication of another breed. A Vizsla&#x27;s eye and nail color usually also blend with the coat color.

====Color and coats====

The standard coat is French-row yellow in several shadings. The coat could also be described as a yellow, orange, copper-brown color, russet gold, and dark sandy gold. Solid, dark, mahogany red and pale yellow are considered faults and a disqualification in competitions. Small areas of white on the fore-chest, neck, or tail are permissible but not preferred. Some variations in the Vizsla coat color along their back (saddle-type marks) are typical.

The American Kennel Club (AKC) breed standards for the Vizsla states that the coat should be short, smooth, dense, and close-lying, without a woolly undercoat. The Vizsla is not suited to being kept outside since, unlike most other breeds, it does not have an undercoat. They are self-cleaning dogs and rarely need to be bathed, if ever. They have little noticeable &quot;dog smell&quot; detectable by humans. After several forays into lakes and streams they will develop an aroma that is a weaker version of the &#x27;wet dog&#x27; smell. A quick bath and this odor will vanish.

==== Grooming and cleaning ====
Maintaining a Vizsla&#x27;s coat is relatively simple because of its short hair. When wet, a quick towel pat-down dries the dog fast, and for mud or dirt, letting it dry makes brushing it off easy. Using a velvet brush not only keeps their coat shiny but also helps in removing much of what they shed. Unlike most dogs, vizslas shed during all seasons, so it is important to keep up with brushing. Aside from their fur, keeping their claws trimmed prevents injury due to excessive length and chewing on hard items like raw marrow bones prevents plaque buildup and ensures clean teeth.

====Size====
The Vizsla is a medium-sized dog, The average height and weight:
*Males
**Height: 
**Weight: 
*Females
**Height: 
**Weight: 

====Tail====

The Vizsla holds its tail horizontal to the ground and wags it vigorously while charging through rough scrub and undergrowth.

The American breed standard calls for the tail to be docked to two-thirds of its original length, though docking for cosmetic reasons is opposed by the American Veterinary Medical Association, the American Animal Hospital Association, and the Canadian Veterinary Medical Association. UK&#x27;s Kennel Club breed standard permits both a docked tail or a natural tail; this accommodates laws in England &amp; Wales and in Scotland which outlaw docking for cosmetic reasons but exempt docking in newborn working dogs.

The docked tail of the Vizsla is significantly longer than that of other dogs with traditionally docked tails such as the Weimaraner, Dobermann, Boxer, and Australian Shepherd. Since the tail is docked when the puppy is less than three days old, this longer dock can result in some variation in tail length among Vizsla dogs from different breeding programs.

===Temperament===
They are natural hunters with an excellent ability to take training. Not only are they great pointers, but they are excellent retrievers as well. They will retrieve on land and in the water making the most of their natural instincts. However, they must be trained gently and without harsh commands or strong physical correction, as they have sensitive temperaments and can be easily damaged if trained too harshly.

Vizslas thrive on attention, exercise, and interaction. They are intelligent dogs and need a lot of mental stimulation when young. If left alone for long hours, they can be bored and become destructive. With proper socialization and training, Vizslas are very gentle dogs that can be great around children. The Vizsla wants to be close to its owner as much as possible, and it is commonly observed that Vizslas insist on sleeping under the covers in their owner&#x27;s bed at night.

==Health==

A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 13.5 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.
The Vizsla is considered to be a robust dog but some localized breeding programs using a small number of dogs have led to heritable illnesses in some offspring including:
* Hip dysplasia is very rare but possible.
* Canine epilepsy
* Cancer (mast cell tumors, hemangiosarcoma, lymphoma)
* Sebaceous adenitis
Responsible breeders do not select dogs for breeding if they have such inherent problems.
Vizslas can also suffer from hypothyroidism, dwarfism, persistent right aortic arch, tricuspid valve dysplasia, and progressive retinal atrophy. Major risks include epilepsy and lymphosarcoma. Vizslas can also be prone to skin and food allergies.

There is also the possibility of diseases and cancer developing in Vizslas that are spayed or neutered. According to the Veterinary Medical DataBases, lymphoma is most likely to occur in gonadectomized Vizslas (4.3x) compared to sexually intact Vizslas. However, this is due to the fact that there is a 1.1% chance of illness in dogs neutered 12 months after birth compared to the 0.3% chance in dogs neutered before 12 months, and the 0.1% chance in those that are sexually intact.

Vizslas can be prone to various bleeding-related conditions such as hemophilia A and Von Willebrand&#x27;s disease, leading to significant bleeding even from minor wounds due to a lack of blood clotting. Additionally, they may experience hypothyroidism, necessitating lifelong medication to support their thyroid in producing essential hormones for their survival.

=== Breeding ===
A Vizsla will begin puberty on average 8–10 months after birth. Though for Vizslas and most other breeds, they should not be bred during their first heat; instead, the second or third heat cycle is when they should be bred if desired. But even these measures can vary depending on the dog&#x27;s mental and physical maturity.

==History==

The first written reference to the Vizsla dog breed has been recorded in the &quot;Illustrated Vienna Chronicle&quot; prepared on order of King Louis I of Hungary by the Carmelite Friars in 1357.

The Vizsla has survived the Turkish occupation (1526–1696), the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, World War I, World War II and the Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic. However, Vizslas faced and survived several near-extinctions in their history, including being overrun by English Pointers and German Shorthaired Pointers in the 1800s (Boggs, 2000:19) and again to near-extinction after World War II. A careful search of Hungary and a poll of Hungarian sportsmen revealed only about a dozen Vizslas of the true type still alive in the country. From that minimum stock, the breed rose to prominence once again. The various &quot;strains&quot; of the Vizsla have become somewhat distinctive as individuals bred stock that suited their hunting style. Outside Hungary, vizslas were commonly bred in Romania, Austria, Slovakia, and Serbia.

The Vizsla started arriving in the United States at the close of World War II. As interest in and devotion to the breed began to increase, owners formed the Vizsla Club of America in order to gain American Kennel Club (AKC) recognition. As a result of registering foundation stock with the AKC, Vizsla owners were able to obtain official recognition on 25 November 1960, as the Vizsla became the 115th breed recognized by the American Kennel Club.

The Vizsla was used in development of other breeds, most notably the Weimaraner, Wirehaired Vizsla and German Shorthaired Pointer breeds. There is much conjecture about those same breeds, along with other pointer breeds, being used to reestablish the Vizsla breed at the end of the 19th century.

=== Vizsla in the UK ===
Approximately 4,520 Vizsla puppies are registered with the Kennel Club of Great Britain (KC) each year, making the breed one of the top 50 most popular. The number is steadily rising year after year as more people recognize the breed. There are two breed clubs for the Vizsla in Britain, The Hungarian Vizsla Club and The Hungarian Vizsla Society. The winner of the Best In Show award at Crufts 2010 was a Vizsla named Hungargunn Bear It&#x27;n Mind.

=== Vizsla in the US ===
About 2,500 vizslas are registered in the U.S. every year. According to the North American Versatile Hunting Dog Association, vizslas are the 7th highest annually registered dog, and this popularity has remained over the past 10 years. Other clubs in the U.S. include the Vizsla Club of America (breeding club) and The American Kennel Club (AKC).

The Vizsla Club of America a club dedicated to the health, betterment, and rescue of the purebred Hungarian vizsla. Established in the year 2000, this club partners with the American Kennel Club Canine Health Foundation to further research in the field of vizsla health, specifically health related issues such as hemangiosarcoma, lymphoma, mast cell cancer, canine epilepsy, brucellosis, diet-related DCM and temperament studies. They also partner with independent rescue organizations in creating a rescue fund for vizslas as well as The Frank Lacko Memorial Cancer Research Fund to research and eventually end cancer in the vizsla breed.

<doc id="177745" wikidata="Q230099" url="?curid=177745" title="Irene Dunne">
<text>Irene Dunne (born Irene Marie Dunn; December 20, 1898 – September 4, 1990) was an American actress who appeared in films during the Golden Age of Hollywood. She is best known for her comedic roles, though she performed in films of other genres.

After her father died when she was 14, Dunne&#x27;s family relocated from Kentucky to Indiana. She was determined to become an opera singer, but when she was rejected by The Met, she performed in musicals on Broadway until she was scouted by RKO and made her Hollywood film debut in the musical &quot;Leathernecking&quot; (1930). She later starred in the successful musical &quot;Show Boat&quot; (1936). 

Dunne starred in 42 movies and was nominated five times for the Academy Award for Best Actress—for her performances in the western drama &quot;Cimarron&quot; (1931), the screwball comedies &quot;Theodora Goes Wild&quot; (1936) and &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; (1937), the romance &quot;Love Affair&quot; (1939), and the drama &quot;I Remember Mama&quot; (1948). Dunne is considered one of the finest actresses never to have won an Academy Award. Some critics feel that her performances have been underappreciated and largely forgotten, often overshadowed by later remakes and better-known co-stars.

After the success of &quot;The Awful Truth&quot;, she was paired with Cary Grant, her co-star in that movie, two further times; in another screwball comedy, &quot;My Favorite Wife&quot; (1940), and in the melodrama &quot;Penny Serenade&quot; (1941). She has been praised by many during her career, and after her death, as one of the best comedic actresses in the screwball genre. The popularity of &quot;Love Affair&quot; also led to two additional movies with her co-star of that film, Charles Boyer; those were &quot;When Tomorrow Comes&quot; (1939) and &quot;Together Again&quot; (1944). Her last film role was in 1952 but she starred in and hosted numerous television anthology episodes until 1962 after having done numerous radio performances from the late 1930s until the early 1950s. She was nicknamed &quot;The First Lady of Hollywood&quot; for her regal manner despite being proud of her Irish-American, country-girl roots.

Dunne devoted her retirement to philanthropy and was chosen by President Dwight D. Eisenhower as a delegate for the United States to the United Nations, in which she advocated world peace and highlighted refugee-relief programs. She also used the time to be with her family—her husband, dentist Dr. Francis Griffin, and their daughter Mary Frances, whom they adopted in 1938. She received numerous awards for her philanthropy, including honorary doctorates, a Laetare Medal from the University of Notre Dame, and a papal knighthood—Dame of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre. In 1985, she was awarded a Kennedy Center Honor for her services to the arts.

==Early life==
Irene Marie Dunn was born on December 20, 1898, at 507 East Gray Street in Louisville, Kentucky, to Joseph John Dunn, an Irish-American steamboat engineer/inspector for the United States government, and Adelaide Antoinette Dunn (née Henry), a concert pianist/music teacher of German descent from Newport, Kentucky. She was their second child and second daughter, and had a younger brother named Charles; Dunne&#x27;s elder sister died soon after her birth. The family alternated between living in Kentucky and St. Louis due to her father&#x27;s job offers. He died in April 1913 from a kidney infection when she was fourteen. She saved all of his letters and remembered, indeed lived by, what he told her the night before he died: &quot;Happiness is never an accident. It is the prize we get when we choose wisely from life&#x27;s great stores.&quot;

Following her father&#x27;s death, Dunne&#x27;s family moved to her mother&#x27;s hometown of Madison, Indiana, living on W. Second St., in the same neighborhood as Dunne&#x27;s grandparents. Dunne&#x27;s mother taught her to play the piano as a very small girl — according to Dunne, &quot;Music was as natural as breathing in our house,&quot; — but unfortunately for her, music lessons frequently prevented her from playing with the neighborhood kids. Her first school production of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; began her interest in drama, so she took singing lessons as well, and sang in local churches and high school plays before her graduation in 1916. Wanting to become a music teacher, she studied at the Indianapolis Conservatory of Music, earning a diploma in 1918. Later, she auditioned for the Chicago Musical College when she visited friends during a journey to Gary, Indiana, and won a college scholarship, officially graduating in 1926. Hoping to become a soprano opera singer, she moved to New York after finishing her second year in 1920, but failed two auditions with the Metropolitan Opera Company due to her inexperience and her &quot;slight&quot; voice.

==Career==
=== 1920–1929: Acting beginnings, Broadway debut ===

Dunne took more singing lessons and then dancing lessons to prepare for a possible career in musical theater. On a New York vacation to visit family friends, she was recommended to audition for a stage musical, eventually starring as the leading role in the popular play &quot;Irene&quot;, which toured major cities as a roadshow throughout 1921. &quot;Back in New York,&quot; Dunne reflected, &quot;I thought that with my experience on the road and musical education it would be easy to win a role. It wasn&#x27;t.&quot; Her Broadway debut was December 25 the following year as Tessie in Zelda Sears&#x27;s &quot;The Clinging Vine&quot;. She understudied Peggy Wood, playing the role several times in February 1923. She then obtained the leading role when the original actress took a leave of absence in 1924. She replaced Leeta Corder in the lead role of Virginia Warewell in &quot;Ginger&quot; (1923) for the final few weeks on the production. She was also a replacement in &quot;Lollipop&quot; (1924) on Broadway. Supporting roles in musical theater productions followed in the shows &quot;The City Chap&quot; (1925), &quot;Yours Truly&quot; (1927) and &quot;She&#x27;s My Baby&quot; (1928). Her first top-billing, leading role &quot;Luckee Girl&quot; (1928) was not as successful as her previous projects. She would later call her career beginnings &quot;not great furor.&quot; At this time, Dunne added the extra &quot;e&quot; to her surname, which had ironically been misspelled as &quot;Dunne&quot; at times throughout her life until this point; until her death, &quot;Dunne&quot; would then occasionally be misspelled as &quot;Dunn&quot;. Starring as Magnolia Hawks in a road company adaptation of &quot;Show Boat&quot; was the result of a chance meeting with its director Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. in an elevator the day she returned from her honeymoon, when he mistook her for his next potential client, eventually sending his secretary to chase after her. A talent scout for RKO Pictures attended a performance, and Dunne signed the studio&#x27;s contract, appearing in her first movie, &quot;Leathernecking&quot; (1930), an adaptation of the musical &quot;Present Arms&quot;. Already in her 30s when she made her first film, she would be in competition with younger actresses for roles, and found it advantageous to evade questions that would reveal her age, so publicists encouraged the belief that she was born in 1901 or 1904; the former is the date engraved on her tombstone.

=== 1930–1949: Hollywood leading lady ===
The &quot;Hollywood musical&quot; era had fizzled out, so Dunne moved to dramatic roles during the Pre-Code era, leading a successful campaign for the role of Sabra in &quot;Cimarron&quot; (1931) with her soon-to-be co-star Richard Dix, earning her first Best Actress nomination. A &quot;Photoplay&quot; review declared, &quot;[This movie] starts Irene Dunne off as one of our greatest screen artists.&quot; Other dramas included &quot;Back Street&quot; (1932) and &quot;No Other Woman&quot; (1933); for &quot;Magnificent Obsession&quot; (1935), she reportedly studied Braille and focused on her posture with blind consultant Ruby Fruth. This was after she and Dix reunited for &quot;Stingaree&quot; (1934), where overall consensus from critics was that Dunne had usurped Dix&#x27;s star power. Under a new contract with Warner Bros., the remake of &quot;Sweet Adeline&quot; (1934) and &quot;Roberta&quot; (1935) were Dunne&#x27;s first two musicals since &quot;Leathernecking&quot;. &quot;Roberta&quot; also starred dancing partners Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, and Dunne sang four songs including &quot;Smoke Gets in Your Eyes&quot;. In 1936, she starred as Magnolia Hawks in &quot;Show Boat&quot; (1936), directed by James Whale. Dunne had concerns about Whale&#x27;s directing decisions, but she later admitted that her favorite scene to film was &quot;Make Believe&quot; with Allan Jones because the blocking reminded her of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. It was during this year that Dunne&#x27;s Warner Bros. contract had expired and she had decided to become a freelance actor, with the power to choose studios and directors. She was apprehensive about attempting her first comedy role as the title character in &quot;Theodora Goes Wild&quot; (1936), but discovered that she enjoyed the production process, and received her second Best Actress Oscar nomination for the performance.

Dunne followed &quot;Theodora Goes Wild&quot; with other romantic and comedic roles. &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; (1937) was the first of three films also starring Cary Grant and was later voted the 68th best comedy in American cinema history by the American Film Institute. Their screwball comedy &quot;My Favorite Wife&quot; (1940) was praised as an excellent spiritual successor, whereas &quot;Penny Serenade&quot; (1941) was a &quot;romantic comedy that frequently embraced melodrama.&quot; Dunne also starred in three films with Charles Boyer: &quot;Love Affair&quot; (1939), &quot;When Tomorrow Comes&quot; (1939), and &quot;Together Again&quot; (1944). &quot;Love Affair&quot; was such an unexpected critical and financial success that the rest of Dunne and Boyer&#x27;s films were judged against it; &quot;When Tomorrow Comes&quot; was considered the most disappointing of the &quot;trilogy,&quot; and the advertising for &quot;Together Again&quot; promoted the actors&#x27; reunion more than the movie. Dunne and Grant were praised as one of the best romantic comedy couples, while the Dunne and Boyer pairing was praised as the most romantic in Hollywood.
On her own, Dunne showed versatility through many film genres. Critics praised her comedic skills in &quot;Unfinished Business&quot; (1941) and &quot;Lady in a Jam&quot; (1942), despite both movies&#x27; negative reception. When the United States entered the Second World War, Dunne participated in celebrity war bond tours around the country, announcing at a rally in 1942, &quot;This is no time for comedy. I&#x27;m now a saleswoman, I sell bonds.&quot; She followed the tour with her only two war films: &quot;A Guy Named Joe&quot; (1943) and &quot;The White Cliffs of Dover&quot; (1944). Despite &quot;A Guy Named Joe&quot;″s troubled production and mixed reviews, it was one of the most successful films of the year. &quot;Over 21&quot; (1945) was Dunne&#x27;s return to comedy but the themes of war (such as her character&#x27;s husband enlisting in the army) immediately dated the story, which may have contributed to its lack of success. Strong but ladylike motherly roles in the vein of &quot;Cimarron&quot;″s Sabra would follow throughout her next films, such as Anna Leonowens in the fictionalized biopic &quot;Anna and the King of Siam&quot; (1946), and mothers Vinnie Day in &quot;Life with Father&quot; (1947), and Marta Hanson in &quot;I Remember Mama&quot; (1948). Dunne openly disliked Vinnie&#x27;s ditziness and had rejected &quot;Life with Father&quot; numerous times, eventually taking the role because &quot;it seemed to be rewarding enough to be in a good picture that everyone will see.&quot; For &quot;I Remember Mama&quot;, Dunne worked on her Norwegian accent with dialect coach Judith Sater, and wore body padding to appear heavier; Marta Hanson was her fifth and final Best Actress nomination.

=== 1950–1962: Declining movie-star power ===
Dunne&#x27;s last three films were box-office failures. The comedy &quot;Never a Dull Moment&quot; (1950) was accused of trying too hard. Dunne was excited to portray Queen Victoria in &quot;The Mudlark&quot; (1950) for a chance to &quot;hide&quot; behind a role with heavy makeup and latex prosthetics. It was a success in the UK, despite initial critical concern over the only foreigner in a British film starring as a well-known British monarch, but her American fans disapproved of the prosthetic decisions. The comedy &quot;It Grows on Trees&quot; (1952) became Dunne&#x27;s last movie performance, although she remained on the lookout for suitable film scripts for years afterwards. She filmed a television pilot based on &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot; that was not picked up. On the radio, she and Fred MacMurray respectively played a feuding editor and reporter of a struggling newspaper in the 52-episode comedy-drama &quot;Bright Star&quot;, which aired in syndication between 1952 and 1953 by the Ziv Company. She also starred in and hosted episodes of television anthologies, such as &quot;Ford Theatre&quot;, &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;, and the &quot;Schlitz Playhouse of Stars&quot;. Faye Emerson wrote in 1954, &quot;I hope we see much more of Miss Dunne on TV,&quot; and Nick Adams called Dunne&#x27;s performance in &quot;Saints and Sinners&quot; worthy of an Emmy nomination. Dunne&#x27;s last acting credit was in 1962, but she was once rumored to star in unmaterialized movies named &quot;Heaven Train&quot; and &quot;The Wisdom of the Serpent&quot;, and rejected an offer to cameo in &quot;Airport &#x27;77&quot;. In 1954, Hedda Hopper reported a rumor that Dunne would star alongside Robert Mitchum in Charles Laughton&#x27;s stage adaptation of &quot;The Web and the Rock&quot;. &quot;I never formally retired,&quot; Dunne later explained, &quot;but an awful lot of the girls my age soldiered on in bad vehicles. [I] couldn&#x27;t run around with an ax in my hand like Bette [Davis] and Joan [Crawford] did to keep things going.&quot;

==Hollywood retirement==

Dunne was a presenter at the 1950 BAFTAs when she was in London filming &quot;The Mudlark&quot;, and then represented Hollywood for the 12th Venice International Film Festival in 1951. She later appeared at 1953&#x27;s March of Dimes showcase in New York City to introduce two little girls nicknamed the Poster Children, who performed a dramatization about polio research.

She accepted Walt Disney&#x27;s offer to present at Disneyland&#x27;s &quot;Dedication Day&quot; in 1955, and christened the Mark Twain Riverboat with a bottle containing water from several major rivers across the United States. Years before, Dunne had also christened the &quot;SS Carole Lombard&quot;.

Dunne was the only actress to be appointed a member of the California Arts Commission between 1967 and 1970. The three years were spent developing a museum exhibit called &quot;Dimension&quot; for visually impaired visitors which officially opened on January 12, 1970, in the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum, and toured California for eleven months. Dunne recorded a talking booklet, explaining the history of the 30 sculptures on display and inviting guests to touch.

=== Activism ===
During the Second World War, Dunne joined the Beverly Hills United Service Organization, and co-founded the Clark Gable&#x27;s Hollywood Victory Committee. It organized servicemen entertainment and war-bond sales tours on behalf of willing Hollywood participants. The National War Savings Program awarded her a certificate for her work from their Treasury Department.

In her retirement, she devoted herself primarily to humanitarianism. Some of the organizations she worked with include the Sister Kenny Foundation, the American Cancer Society (becoming Chairwoman of its Field Army in 1948), the Los Angeles Orphanage, the Archdiocesan Council of Catholic Women, and was Co-Chairman of the American Red Cross. She was elected president of Santa Monica&#x27;s St. John&#x27;s Hospital and Health Clinic in 1950 (she resigned in 1966 to work in the developing council) and became a board member of Technicolor in 1965, the first woman ever elected to the board of directors. She established an African American school for Los Angeles, negotiated donations to St. John&#x27;s through box office results, and Hebrew University Rebuilding Fun&#x27;s sponsors committee. Harold Stassen appointed her chairwoman for the American Heart Association&#x27;s women&#x27;s committee on February 7, 1949, and she held the position until February 28. She appeared in a celebrity-rostered television special &quot;Benefit Show for Retarded Children&quot; (1955) with Jack Benny as host. Dunne also donated to refurbishments in Madison, Indiana, funding the manufacture of Camp Louis Ernst Boy Scout&#x27;s gate in 1939 and the Broadway Fountain&#x27;s 1976 restoration. In 1987, she founded the Irene Dunne Guild, a foundation which remains &quot;instrumental in raising funds to support programs and services at St. John&#x27;s.&quot; It was reported that the Guild had raised $20 million by the time of her death.

Dunne reflected in 1951: &quot;If I began living in Hollywood today, I would certainly do one thing that I did when I arrived, and that is to be active in charity. If one is going to take something out of a community—any community—one must put something in, too.&quot; She also hoped that charity would encourage submissive women to find independence: &quot;I wish women would be more direct. [...] I was amazed when some quiet little mouse of a woman was given a job which seemed to be out of all proportion to her capabilities. Then I saw the drive with which she undertook that job and put it through to a great finish. It was both inspiring and surprising. I want women to be individuals. They should not lean on their husbands&#x27; opinions and be merely echoes of the men of the family[.]&quot;

=== American delegate to the United Nations ===
In 1957, President Eisenhower appointed Dunne one of five alternative U.S. delegates to the United Nations in recognition of her interest in international affairs and Roman Catholic and Republican causes. Dunne admired the U.N.&#x27;s dedication to creating world peace, and was inspired by colleagues&#x27; beliefs that Hollywood influenced the world. On September 12, she was sworn in with Herman B. Wells, Walter H. Judd, A. S. J. Carnahan, Philip M. Klutznick and George Meany. She held delegacy for two years and addressed the General Assembly twice. She gave her delegacy its own anthem: &quot;Getting to Know You&quot; because &quot;it&#x27;s so simple, and yet so fundamental in international relations today.&quot; Dunne later described her Assembly request for $21 million to help Palestinian refugees as her &quot;biggest thrill,&quot; and called her delegacy career the &quot;highlight of my life.&quot; She also concluded, &quot;I came away greatly impressed with the work the U.N. does in its limited field—and it does have certain limits. I think we averted a serious situation in Syria, which might have been much worse without a forum to hear it... And I&#x27;m much impressed with the work the U.N. agencies do. I&#x27;m especially interested in UNICEF&#x27;s work with children[,] and the health organization [.]&quot;

===Political views===
Dunne was a lifelong Republican and served as a member of the Californian delegation in 1948&#x27;s Republican National Convention and campaigned for Thomas Dewey in the 1944 United States presidential election and Ronald Reagan in the 1966 California gubernatorial election. She accepted the U.N. delegacy offer because she viewed the U.N. as apolitical. She later explained: &quot;I&#x27;m a Nixon Republican, not a Goldwater one. I don&#x27;t like extremism in any case. The extreme rights do as much harm as the extreme lefts.&quot; Her large input in politics created an assumption that she was a member of the &quot;Hollywood right-wing fringe,&quot; which Dunne denied, calling herself &quot;foolish&quot; for being involved years before other celebrities did.

==Personal life==

Dunne&#x27;s father frequently told Dunne about his memories of traveling on bayous and lazy rivers. Dunne&#x27;s favorite family vacations were riverboat rides and parades, later recalling a voyage from St. Louis to New Orleans, and watching boats on the Ohio River from the hillside. She admitted, &quot;No triumph of either my stage or screen career has ever rivaled the excitement of trips down the Mississippi on the riverboats with my father.&quot;

Dunne was an avid golfer, playing the sport since high-school graduation; her husband and she often played against each other and she made a hole in one in two different games. They often socialized with Californian business people, but she was good friends with Loretta Young, Jimmy Stewart, Bob Hope, Rosalind Russell, Van Johnson, Ronald Reagan, Carole Lombard, and George Stevens Jr., and became godmother to Young&#x27;s son, Peter. She and Charles Boyer&#x27;s blossoming friendship in &quot;Love Affair&quot; seeped through the movie so strongly, they wrote essays about each other in the October issue of &quot;Photoplay&quot;. Dunne also bonded with Leo McCarey over numerous similar interests, such as their Irish ancestry, music, religious backgrounds, and humor. School friends nicknamed her &quot;Dunnie&quot; and she was referred to as this in Madison High School&#x27;s 1916 yearbook, along with the description &quot;divinely tall and most divinely fair.&quot; John Cromwell, however, reportedly described her as &quot;always [having] the look of a cat who had swallowed the canary.&quot;

Dunne was popular with co-workers off-camera, earning a reputation as warm and approachable, and having a &quot;poised, gracious manner&quot; like royalty, which spilled into her persona in movies. On observing life behind the scenes of a typical day of filming in Hollywood, Jimmie Fidler noted, &quot;There is something about Irene Dunne that makes every man in the room unconsciously straighten his tie.&quot; Dunne earned the nickname &quot;The First Lady of Hollywood&quot; because &quot;she was the first real lady Hollywood has ever seen,&quot; said Leo McCarey, with Gregory La Cava adding, &quot;If Irene Dunne isn&#x27;t the first lady of Hollywood, then she&#x27;s the last one.&quot; Ironically, this title had been bestowed on her when she was a little girl when an aunt cooed &quot;What a little lady!&quot; When approached about the nickname in 1936, Dunne admitted it had grown tiresome but approved if it was meant as &quot;the feminine counterpart of &#x27;gentleman&#x27;&quot;; a later interview she did have with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; would ironically be titled &quot;Irene Dunne, Gentlewoman.&quot;

Her fashion tastes were often the talk of newspapers, and Best Dressed lists featured her as one of the most stylish celebrities in the world. Dunne explained in a 1939 fashion-advice interview that her husband was partially responsible because he was equally stylish, but also chooses outfits based on personality, color scheme and the context of where the outfits will be worn. &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot; magazine later revealed Dunne chose outfits specifically designed for her by Mainbocher and Jean Louis because she did not like buying clothes in stores.

One of Dunne&#x27;s later public appearances was in April 1985, when she attended the unveiling of a bronze bust in her honor at St. John&#x27;s Hospital and Health Clinic. The artwork, commissioned by the hospital from artist Artis Lane, has a plaque reading &quot;IRENE DUNNE First Lady Of Saint John&#x27;s Hospital and Health Center Foundation.&quot;

=== Relationships ===
Between 1919 and 1922, Dunne was close to Fritz Ernst, a businessman based in Chicago who was 20 years older than she, and a member of one of the richest families in Madison, Indiana. They frequently corresponded while Dunne was training for musical theater but when Fritz proposed, Dunne declined, due to pressure from her mother and wanting to focus on acting. They remained friends and continued writing letters until Ernst died in 1959.

At a New York, Biltmore Hotel supper party in 1924, Dunne met Northampton, Massachusetts-born dentist Francis Griffin. According to Dunne, he preferred being a bachelor, yet tried everything he could to meet her. To her frustration, he did not telephone her until over a month later, but the relationship strengthened and they married in Manhattan on July 13, 1927. They had constantly argued about the state of their careers if they ever got married, with Dunne agreeing to consider theater retirement sometime in the future and Griffin agreeing to support Dunne&#x27;s acting. Griffin later explained: &quot;I didn&#x27;t like the moral tone of show business. [...] Then Ziegfeld signed her for &quot;Show Boat&quot; and it looked like she was due for big things. Next came Hollywood and [she] was catapulted to the top. Then I didn&#x27;t feel I could ask her to drop her career. [I] really didn&#x27;t think marriage and the stage were compatible but we loved each other and we were both determined to make our marriage work.&quot;

When Dunne decided to star in &quot;Leathernecking&quot;, it was meant to be her only Hollywood project, but when it was a box-office bomb, she took an interest in &quot;Cimarron&quot;. Soon after, she and her mother moved to Hollywood and maintained a long-distance relationship with her husband and brother in New York until they joined her in California in 1936. A family friend described their dynamic as &quot;like two pixies together,&quot; and they remained married until Griffin&#x27;s death on October 14, 1965, living in the Holmby Hills in a &quot;kind of French Chateau&quot; they designed. A hobby they both shared was astronomy. Griffin explained the marriage had lasted so long because: &quot;When she had to go on location for a film I arranged my schedule so I could go with her. When I had to go out of town she arranged her schedule so she could be with me. We co-operate in everything. [...] I think a man married to a career woman in show business has to be convinced that his wife&#x27;s talent is too strong to be dimmed or put out. Then, he can be just as proud of her success as she is and, inside he can take a bow himself for whatever help he&#x27;s been.&quot; Due to Dunne&#x27;s privacy, Hollywood columnists struggled to find scandals to write about her—an eventual interview with &quot;Photoplay&quot; included the disclaimer, &quot;I can guarantee no juicy bits of intimate gossip. Unless, perhaps she lies awake nights heartsick about the kitchen sink in her new home. She&#x27;s afraid it&#x27;s too near to the door. Or would you call that juicy? No? No, I thought not.&quot; When the magazines alleged that Dunne and Griffin would divorce, Griffin released a statement denying any marital issues.

After retiring from dentistry, Griffin became Dunne&#x27;s business manager and helped negotiate her first contract. The couple became interested in real estate, later investing in the Beverly Wilshire and throughout Las Vegas (including co-founding and chairing the board of Huntridge Corporation), and partnering with Griffin&#x27;s family&#x27;s businesses (Griffin Equipment Company and The Griffin Wellpoint Company.) Griffin sat as a board member of numerous banks, but his offices were relocated from Century City to their home after his death, when Dunne took over as president. They had one daughter, Mary Frances (née Anna Mary Bush; 1935 – 2020), who was adopted by the couple in 1936 (finalized in 1938) from the New York Foundling Hospital, run by the Sisters of Charity of New York.

=== Religion ===
Dunne was a devout Catholic laywoman, who became a daily communicant. She was a member of the Church of the Good Shepherd and the Catholic Motion Picture Guild in Beverly Hills, California. In 1953, Pope Pius XII awarded Dunne and her husband papal knighthoods as Dame and Knight of the Holy Sepulchre, respectively. Griffin also became a Knight of Malta in 1949.

==Death==

Dunne died at the age of 91 in her Holmby Hills home on September 4, 1990, and was entombed four days later next to her husband in the Calvary Cemetery, East Los Angeles. She had been unwell for a year with an irregular heartbeat, and became bedridden about a month before. The funeral was private with family friend Loretta Young being the only celebrity allowed to attend. Her personal papers are housed at the University of Southern California.

==Legacy==

Dunne is considered one of the best actresses of The Golden Age of Hollywood never to win an Academy Award. After &quot;I Remember Mama&quot; was released, &quot;Liberty&quot; magazine hoped she would &quot;do a Truman&quot; at the 1949 Oscars whereas Erskine Johnson called her and Best Actor nominee Montgomery Clift the dark horses of that ceremony. In 1985, Roger Fristoe said &quot;a generation of filmgoers is mostly unfamiliar with her work&quot; because eleven of her movies had been remade, including &quot;Love Affair&quot; (remade as &quot;An Affair to Remember&quot;), &quot;Show Boat&quot; (remade in 1951), &quot;My Favorite Wife&quot; (remade as &quot;Move Over, Darling&quot;), and &quot;Cimarron&quot; (remade in 1960). Dunne explained she had lacked the &quot;terrifying ambition&quot; of some other actresses, commenting in 1977, &quot;I drifted into acting and drifted out. Acting is not everything. Living is.&quot;
Although known for her comedic roles, Dunne admitted that she never saw comedy as a worthy genre, even leaving the country to attend the London premiere of &quot;Show Boat&quot; with her husband and James Whale to get away from being confronted with a script for &quot;Theodora Goes Wild&quot;. &quot;I never admired a comedienne,&quot; she said retrospectively, &quot;yet it was very easy for me, very natural. It was no effort for me to do comedy at all. Maybe that&#x27;s why I wasn&#x27;t so appreciative of it.&quot; She ascribed her sense of humor to her late father, as well as her &quot;Irish stubbornness.&quot; Her screwball comedy characters have been praised for their subversions to the traditional characterisation of female leads in the genre, particularly Susan (Katharine Hepburn) in &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; and Irene (Carole Lombard) in &quot;My Man Godfrey&quot;. &quot;Unlike the genre&#x27;s stereotypical leading lady, who exhibits bonkers behaviour continuously, Dunne&#x27;s screwball heroine [in &quot;Theodora Goes Wild&quot;] chooses when she &quot;goes wild&quot;,&quot; writes Wes D. Gehring, who also described Dunne&#x27;s screwball as situational because her characters often obfuscate wackiness to attract the male lead, and could turn it off when needed.

Biographers and critics argue that Dunne&#x27;s groundedness made her screwball characters more attractive than those of her contemporaries. In his review for &quot;My Favorite Wife&quot;, Bosley Crowther wrote that a &quot;mere man is powerless&quot; to &quot;her luxurious and mocking laughter, her roving eyes and come-hither glances.&quot; Maria DiBattista points out that Dunne is the &quot;only comic actress working under the strictures of the Production Code&quot; who ends both of her screwball movies alongside Cary Grant with a heavy implication of sharing a bed with him, &quot;under the guise of keeping him at bay.&quot; Frankie Teller claimed Dunne&#x27;s sexiness had been overshadowed by her melodramatic movies until &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; was released. Meanwhile, outside of comedy, Andrew Sarris theorized that Dunne&#x27;s sex appeal is due to the common narrative in her movies about a good girl &quot;going bad.&quot; Dunne&#x27;s backstage &quot;First Lady&quot; reputation furthered Sarris&#x27; sex appeal claims, admitting the scene when she shares a train carriage with Preston Foster in &quot;Unfinished Business&quot; was practically his &quot;rite of passage&quot; to a sex scene in a film, theorizing that the sex appeal of Dunne came from &quot;a good girl deciding thoughtfully to be bad.&quot; On the blatant eroticism of the same train scene, Megan McGurk wrote, &quot;The only thing that allowed this film to pass the censors was that good-girl Irene Dunne can have a one-night stand with a random because she loves him, rather than just a once-off fling. For most other women of her star magnitude, you could not imagine a heroine without a moral compass trained on true north. Irene Dunne elevates a tawdry encounter to something justifiably pure or blameless. She&#x27;s just not the casual sex type, so she gets away with it.&quot;

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; referred to Dunne&#x27;s publicity in their obituary as trailblazing, noting her as one of the first actors to become a freelancer in Hollywood during its rigid studio system through her &quot;non-exclusive contract that gave her the right to make films at other studios and to decide who should direct them,&quot; and her involvement with the United Nations as a decision that allowed entertainers from movies and television to branch out into philanthropy and politics, such as Ronald Reagan and George Murphy.

Dunne later said, &quot;Cary Grant always said that I had the best timing of anybody he ever worked with.&quot; Lucille Ball admitted at an American Film Institute seminar that she based her comedic skills on Dunne&#x27;s performance in &quot;Joy of Living&quot;, Joan Leslie called her an &quot;outstanding example as a woman and a star.&quot; Charles Boyer described her having &quot;an irrepressible youthfulness&quot; and Ralph Bellamy described working in three films with her as &quot;like a three-layered cake with candles[. She was] truly professional, extremely talented, and socially attractive and beautiful.&quot; When asked about life after retiring from baseball, Lou Gehrig stated he would want Dunne as a screen partner if he ever became a movie actor. Charles Mendl once called her one of the most attractive and fascinating women in the world &quot;who has beauty as an accomplished actress and sophisticated conversationalist.&quot; Dunne told James Bawden in 1977: &quot;Now don&#x27;t you dare call me normal. I was never a Pollyanna. There was always a lot of Theodora in me.&quot;

In 2006, a historical marker was erected on 105 E. Main Street, Madison (Jefferson County, Indiana) to honor her contributions to the state of Indiana.

==Awards and nominations==

Dunne received five Best Actress nominations during her career: for &quot;Cimarron&quot; (1931), &quot;Theodora Goes Wild&quot; (1936), &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; (1937), &quot;Love Affair&quot; (1939) and &quot;I Remember Mama&quot; (1948); she was the first actor to lose against the same actor in the same category twice, losing to Best Actress winner Luise Rainer in 1936 and 1937. When asked if she ever resented never winning, Dunne pointed out that the nominees she was up against had strong support, believing that she would never have had a chance, especially when &quot;Love Affair&quot; was against &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. &quot;I don&#x27;t mind at all,&quot; she told Joyce Haber, &quot;Greta Garbo never got an Oscar either [and] she&#x27;s a living legend.&quot;

However, Dunne was honored numerous times for her philanthropy from Catholic organizations and schools, receiving the University of Notre Dame&#x27;s Laetare Medal, and the Bellarmine Medal from Bellarmine College. She received numerous honorary doctorates, including from Chicago Musical College (for music), Loyola University and Mount St. Mary&#x27;s College (both for Law). For her film career, she was honored by the Kennedy Center, a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6440 Hollywood Blvd, and displays in the Warner Bros. Museum and Center for Motion Picture Study. A two-sided marker was erected in Dunne&#x27;s childhood hometown of Madison in 2006.

<text>NetBIOS () is an acronym for Network Basic Input/Output System. It provides services related to the session layer of the OSI model allowing applications on separate computers to communicate over a local area network. As strictly an API, NetBIOS is not a networking protocol. Operating systems of the 1980s (DOS and Novell Netware primarily) ran NetBIOS over IEEE 802.2 and IPX/SPX using the NetBIOS Frames (NBF) and NetBIOS over IPX/SPX (NBX) protocols, respectively. In modern networks, NetBIOS normally runs over TCP/IP via the NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NBT) protocol. NetBIOS is also used for identifying system names in TCP/IP (Windows).

==History and terminology==
NetBIOS is an operating system-level API that allows applications on computers to communicate with one another over a local area network (LAN). The API was created in 1983 by Sytek Inc. for software communication over IBM PC Network LAN technology. On IBM PC Network, as an API alone, NetBIOS relied on proprietary Sytek networking protocols for communication over the wire.

In 1985, IBM went forward with the Token Ring network scheme and produced an emulator of Sytek&#x27;s NetBIOS API to allow NetBIOS-aware applications from the PC-Network era to work over IBM&#x27;s new Token Ring hardware. This IBM emulator, named NetBIOS Extended User Interface (NetBEUI), expanded the base NetBIOS API created by Sytek with, among other things, the ability to deal with the greater node capacity of Token Ring. A new networking protocol, NBF, was simultaneously produced by IBM to allow its NetBEUI API (their enhanced NetBIOS API) to provide its services over Token Ring – specifically, at the IEEE 802.2 Logical Link Control layer.

In 1985, Microsoft created its own implementation of the NetBIOS API for its MS-Net networking technology. As in the case of IBM&#x27;s Token Ring, the services of Microsoft&#x27;s NetBIOS implementation were provided over the IEEE 802.2 Logical Link Control layer by the NBF protocol. However, the MS-Net was only delivered to OEMs, and it was actually not a complete product, nor was it ready to communicate on the network in the form it was distributed. It lacked any implementation of OSI Layers 1 to 4 (Physical, Data link, Network and Transport Layers) and an OEM was expected to provide these implementations (in the form of a NetBIOS part) to make its version of MS-Net a complete and ready to use product. MS-Net accessed the network through the Microsoft&#x27;s own variant of NetBIOS, which was split into two parts - the lower level part that OEMs had to provide implemented the NetBIOS calls that depended on layers 1-4, while the higher level part, provided by Microsoft, was hardware- and protocol-independent. This NetBIOS implementation supported the full NetBIOS API, but was called by invoking x86 interrupt 0x2A, instead of IBM&#x27;s standard interrupt 0x5C. The reliance on OEMs to implement parts of NetBIOS had the unfortunate side effect that different OEM versions of MS-Net and NetBIOS generally weren&#x27;t able to communicate with one another. 

In 1986, Novell released Advanced Novell NetWare 2.0 featuring the company&#x27;s own emulation of the NetBIOS API. Its services were encapsulated within NetWare&#x27;s IPX/SPX protocol using the NetBIOS over IPX/SPX (NBX) protocol.

In 1987, a method of encapsulating NetBIOS in TCP and UDP packets, NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NBT), was published. It was described in RFC 1001 (&quot;Protocol Standard for a NetBIOS Service on a TCP/UDP Transport: Concepts and Methods&quot;) and RFC 1002 (&quot;Protocol Standard for a NetBIOS Service on a TCP/UDP Transport: Detailed Specifications&quot;). The NBT protocol was developed in order to &quot;allow an implementation [of NetBIOS applications] to be built on virtually any type of system where the TCP/IP protocol suite is available,&quot; and to &quot;allow NetBIOS interoperation in the Internet.&quot;

After the PS/2 computer hit the market in 1987, IBM released the PC LAN Support Program, which included a driver offering the NetBIOS API.

There is some confusion between the names NetBIOS and NetBEUI. NetBEUI originated strictly as the moniker for IBM&#x27;s enhanced 1985 NetBIOS emulator for Token Ring. The name NetBEUI should have died there, considering that at the time, the NetBIOS implementations by other companies were known simply as NetBIOS regardless of whether they incorporated the API extensions found in Token Ring&#x27;s emulator. For MS-Net, however, Microsoft elected to name its implementation of the NBF protocol &quot;NetBEUI&quot; – naming its implementation of the transport protocol after IBM&#x27;s enhanced version of the API. Consequently Microsoft file and printer sharing over Ethernet often continues to be called NetBEUI, with the name NetBIOS commonly used only in reference to file and printer sharing over TCP/IP. More accurately, the former is NetBIOS Frames (NBF), and the latter is NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NBT).

Since its original publication in a technical reference book from IBM, the NetBIOS API specification has become a &quot;de facto&quot; standard in the industry despite originally supporting a maximum of only 80 PCs in a LAN. This limitation was generally overcome industry-wide through the transition from NBF to NBT, under which, for example, Microsoft was able to switch to Domain Name System (DNS) for resolution of NetBIOS hostnames, having formerly used the LAN segment-compartmentalized NBF protocol itself to resolve such names in Windows client-server networks.

==Services==
NetBIOS provides three distinct services:
*Name service (NetBIOS-NS) for name registration and resolution.
*Datagram distribution service (NetBIOS-DGM) for connectionless communication.
*Session service (NetBIOS-SSN) for connection-oriented communication.

(Note: SMB, an upper layer, is a service that runs on top of the Session Service and the Datagram service, and is not to be confused as a necessary and integral part of NetBIOS itself. It can now run atop TCP with a small adaptation layer that adds a length field to each SMB message; this is necessary because TCP only provides a byte-stream service with no notion of message boundaries.)

===Name service===
In order to start sessions or distribute datagrams, an application must register its NetBIOS name using the name service. NetBIOS names are 16 octets in length and vary based on the particular implementation. Frequently, the 16th octet, called the NetBIOS Suffix, designates the type of resource, and can be used to tell other applications what type of services the system offers. In NBT, the name service operates on UDP port 137 (TCP port 137 can also be used, but rarely is).

The name service primitives offered by NetBIOS are:
*Add name – registers a NetBIOS name.
*Add group name – registers a NetBIOS &quot;group&quot; name.
*Delete name – un-registers a NetBIOS name or group name.
*Find name – looks up a NetBIOS name on the network.

Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) are not supported by the NetBIOS name resolution protocol.

===Datagram distribution service===
Datagram mode is connectionless; the application is responsible for error detection and recovery. In NBT, the datagram service runs on UDP port 138.

The datagram service primitives offered by NetBIOS are:
*Send Datagram – send a datagram to a remote NetBIOS name.
*Send Broadcast Datagram – send a datagram to all NetBIOS names on the network.
*Receive Datagram – wait for a packet to arrive from a Send Datagram operation.
*Receive Broadcast Datagram – wait for a packet to arrive from a Send Broadcast Datagram operation.

===Session service===
Session mode lets two computers establish a connection, allows messages to span multiple packets, and provides error detection and recovery. In NBT, the session service runs on TCP port 139.

The session service primitives offered by NetBIOS are:
*Call – opens a session to a remote NetBIOS name.
*Listen – listen for attempts to open a session to a NetBIOS name.
*Hang Up – close a session.
*Send – sends a packet to the computer on the other end of a session.
*Send No Ack – like Send, but doesn&#x27;t require an acknowledgment.
*Receive – wait for a packet to arrive from a Send on the other end of a session.

In the original protocol used to implement NetBIOS services on PC-Network, to establish a session, the initiating computer sends an Open request which is answered by an Open acknowledgment. The computer that started the session will then send a Session Request packet which will prompt either a Session Accept or Session Reject packet.

During an established session, each transmitted packet is answered by either a positive-acknowledgment (ACK) or negative-acknowledgment (NAK) response. A NAK will prompt retransmission of the data. Sessions are closed by the non-initiating computer by sending a close request. The computer that started the session will reply with a close response which prompts the final session closed packet.

==NetBIOS name vs Internet host name==
When NetBIOS is run in conjunction with Internet protocols (e.g., NBT), each computer may have multiple names: one or more NetBIOS name service names and one or more Internet host names.

===NetBIOS name===
The NetBIOS name is 16 ASCII characters, however Microsoft limits the host name to 15 characters and reserves the 16th character as a NetBIOS Suffix. This suffix describes the service or name record type such as host record, master browser record, or domain controller record or other services. The host name (or short host name) is specified when Windows networking is installed/configured, the suffixes registered are determined by the individual services supplied by the host. In order to connect to a computer running TCP/IP via its NetBIOS name, the name must be resolved to a network address. Today this is usually an IP address (the NetBIOS name to IP address resolution is often done by either broadcasts or a WINS Server – NetBIOS Name Server). A computer&#x27;s NetBIOS name is often the same as that computer&#x27;s host name (see below), although truncated to 15 characters, but it may also be completely different.

NetBIOS names are a sequence of alphanumeric characters. The following characters are explicitly not permitted: &lt;samp&gt;\/:*?&quot;&lt;&gt;|&lt;/samp&gt;. Since Windows 2000, NetBIOS names also had to comply with restrictions on DNS names: they cannot consist entirely of digits, and the hyphen (&quot;-&quot;) or full-stop (&quot;.&quot;) characters may not appear as the first or last character. Since Windows 2000, Microsoft has advised against including any full-stop (&quot;.&quot;) characters in NetBIOS names, such that applications can use the presence of a full-stop to distinguish domain names from NetBIOS names.

The Windows LMHOSTS file provides a NetBIOS name resolution method that can be used for small networks that do not use a WINS server.

===Internet host name===
A Windows machine&#x27;s NetBIOS name is not to be confused with the computer&#x27;s Internet host name (assuming that the computer is also an Internet host in addition to being a NetBIOS node, which need not necessarily be the case). Generally a computer running Internet protocols (whether it is a Windows machine or not) usually has a host name (also sometimes called a machine name). Originally these names were stored in and provided by a hosts file but today most such names are part of the hierarchical Domain Name System (DNS).

Generally the host name of a Windows computer is based on the NetBIOS name plus the Primary DNS Suffix, which are both set in the System Properties dialog box. There may also be connection-specific suffixes which can be viewed or changed on the DNS tab in Control Panel → Network → TCP/IP → Advanced Properties. Host names are used by applications such as telnet, ftp, web browsers, etc. To connect to a computer running the TCP/IP protocol using its name, the host name must be resolved into an IP address, typically by a DNS server. (It is also possible to operate many TCP/IP-based applications, including the three listed above, using only IP addresses, but this is not the norm.)

==Node types==
Under Windows, the node type of a networked computer relates to the way it resolves NetBIOS names to IP addresses. This assumes that there are any IP addresses for the NetBIOS nodes, which is assured only when NetBIOS operates over NBT; thus, node types are not a property of NetBIOS per se but of interaction between NetBIOS and TCP/IP in the Windows OS environment. There are four node types.
*B-node: 0x01 Broadcast
*P-node: 0x02 Peer (WINS only)
*M-node: 0x04 Mixed (broadcast, then WINS)
*H-node: 0x08 Hybrid (WINS, then broadcast)

The node type in use is displayed by opening a command line and typing &quot;ipconfig /all&quot;.
A Windows computer registry may also be configured in such a way as to display &quot;unknown&quot; for the node type.

==NetBIOS Suffixes==
The NetBIOS Suffix, alternately called the NetBIOS End Character (endchar), is the 16th character of a NetBIOS name and indicates service type for the registered name. The number of record types is limited to 255; some commonly used values are:

For unique names:
*00: Workstation Service (workstation name)
*03: Windows Messenger service
*06: Remote Access Service
*20: File Service (also called Host Record)
*21: Remote Access Service client
*1B: Domain Master Browser – Primary Domain Controller for a domain
*1D: Master Browser

For group names:
*00: Workstation Service (workgroup/domain name)
*1C: Domain Controllers for a domain (group record with up to 25 IP addresses)
*1E: Browser Service Elections

<text>James Mooney (February 10, 1861 – December 22, 1921) was an American ethnographer who lived for several years among the Cherokee. Known as &quot;The Indian Man&quot;, he conducted major studies of Southeastern Indians, as well as of tribes on the Great Plains. He did ethnographic studies of the Ghost Dance, a spiritual movement among various Native American culture groups, after Sitting Bull&#x27;s death in 1890. His works on the Cherokee include &quot;The Sacred Formulas of the Cherokees&quot; (1891), and &quot;Myths of the Cherokee&quot; (1900). All were published by the US Bureau of American Ethnology, within the Smithsonian Institution.

Native American artifacts collected by Mooney are held in the collections of the Department of Anthropology, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution and the Department of Anthropology, Field Museum of Natural History. Papers and photographs from Mooney are in the collections of the National Anthropological Archives, Department of Anthropology, Smithsonian Institution.

==Early life==
James Mooney was born on February 10, 1861, in Richmond, Indiana, son of Irish Catholic immigrants. His formal education was limited to the public schools of the city. He became a self-taught expert on American tribes by his own studies and his careful observation during long residences with different groups. The field of ethnography was new in the late 19th century, and he helped create high standards for the work.

==Early career==
In 1885 he started working with the Bureau of American Ethnology (now part of the Smithsonian Institution) at Washington, D.C., under John Wesley Powell. In 1887, he moved to live among the Eastern band of the Cherokee. He compiled a list of Native American tribes that totaled 3,000 names. It ended after the US Army&#x27;s 1890 massacre of Lakota people at Wounded Knee, South Dakota. Mooney became recognized as a national expert on the American Indian.

== Writing career ==
Mooney&#x27;s writing style was widely considered as evocative. His sympathetic treatment of Native Americans is attributed to his upbringing and ethnic heritage. Although he wrote as a scientist, his objective attitude toward Native Americans contrasted with other writing, which was often either romantic or discriminatory. He largely accepted the goal of Indian assimilation as outlined by reformers of the era. But, he was a witness to what the costs were to the traditional peoples and reported on issues and changes with objectivity.

During the late 1800s Native Americans were under harsh attack in many areas, and essentially subjects of genocide by the United States of America. The Indian Wars, intended to suppress tribal resistance to European-American settlement of the West, was generally presented as required because Native Americans made unjustified attacks on pioneers. Mooney wrote more objectively about issues in the West.

Mooney took the time to observe various Native American tribes in the way they lived on a daily basis. Prior to his work, most people outside reservations learned about issues only from a distance. He wanted to learn and to teach other Americans about their culture. He published several books based on his studies of Native American tribes.

=== &quot;The Ghost-dance Religion and the Sioux Outbreak of 1890&quot; ===
Mooney provides a preface with a historical survey of comparable millenarian movements among other American Indian groups. In response to the rapid spread of the Ghost Dance among tribes of the western United States in the early 1890s, Mooney set out to describe and understand the phenomenon. He visited Wovoka, the Ghost Dance prophet, at his home in Nevada. He also traced the movement of the Ghost Dance from place to place, describing the ritual and recording the distinctive song lyrics of seven separate tribes.

=== &quot;Calendar History of the Kiowa Indians&quot; (1898) ===
&quot;The desire to preserve to future ages the memory of past achievements is a universal human instinct,&quot;Mooney said. &quot;The reliability of the record depends chiefly on the truthfulness of the recorder and the adequacy of the method employed.&quot; Mooney earned the confidence of the Kiowa who told him about their system of calendars to record events. They told him that the first calendar keeper in their tribe was Little Bluff, or &quot;Tohausan,&quot; principal chief of the tribe from 1833 to 1866. Mooney also worked with two other calendar keepers, &quot;Settan,&quot; or Little Bear; and &quot;Ankopaingyadete,&quot; meaning &quot;In the Middle of Many Tracks&quot;, and commonly known as &quot;Anko.&quot; Other Plains tribes kept pictorial records, which are known as winter counts. They were commonly created in the winter, when the people were indoors, and expressed major events of the year.

The Kiowa recorded two events for each year, offering a finer-grained record and twice as many entries for any given period. Silver Horn (1860–1940), or &quot;Haungooah,&quot; was the most highly esteemed artist of the Kiowa tribe in the 19th and 20th centuries, and kept a calendar. He was a respected religious leader in his later years.

=== &quot;Myths of the Cherokee (1900)&quot; ===
Mooney also spent much time with the Cherokee, by then removed to Indian Territory (in what is now Oklahoma and North Carolina). For many years he worked with Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians elder and translator Will West Long. He studied their language, culture, and mythology. This comprehensive volume compiled 126 Cherokee myths, including sacred stories, animal myths, local legends, wonder stories, historical traditions, and miscellaneous myths and legends. Some myths included:

* How the World was Made
* Why the Deer&#x27;s Teeth are Blunt
* How the Turkey got his Beard
* Why the Possum&#x27;s Tail is Bare

The book also includes original Cherokee manuscripts, relating to the history, archaeology, geographic nomenclature, personal names, botany, medicine, arts, home life, religion, songs, ceremonies, and language of the tribe.

=== &quot;Historical Sketch of the Cherokee (1975)&quot; ===
Published posthumously, this account of the Cherokee started with their first contact with whites and, through battles won and lost, treaties signed then broken, towns destroyed and people massacred, ended around 1900. There is humanity along with inhumanity in the relations between the Cherokee and other groups, Indian and non-Indian; there is fortitude and persistence balanced with disillusionment and frustration. In these respects, the history of the Cherokee epitomizes the experience of most Native Americans, Mooney writes. This, among with most, if not all of Mooney&#x27;s works, is considered dispassionate and matter-of-fact, which is why his works are found in the Bureau of American Ethnology.

==Personal life and death==

He married Ione Lee Gaut on September 28, 1897, in Washington, D.C., and had six children. One son was the writer Paul Mooney. Mooney died of heart disease in Washington, D.C., on December 22, 1921. He was buried in Mount Olivet Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

<text>An environmental tax, ecotax (short for ecological taxation), or green tax is a tax levied on activities which are considered to be harmful to the environment and is intended to promote environmentally friendly alternatives via economic incentives. One notable example is a carbon tax. Such a policy can complement or avert the need for regulatory (command and control) approaches. Often, an ecotax policy proposal may attempt to maintain overall tax revenue by proportionately reducing other taxes (e.g. taxes on wages and income or property taxes); such proposals are known as a green tax shift towards ecological taxation. Ecotaxes address the failure of free markets to consider environmental impacts.

Ecotaxes are examples of Pigouvian taxes, which are taxes on goods whose production or consumption creates external costs or externalities. An example might be philosopher Thomas Pogge&#x27;s proposed Global Resources Dividend.

== Categories of Environmental Taxes ==
The term, environmental tax, encompasses an array of different types of taxes used to internalize negative environmental externalities, promote sustainable development, support environmental preservation, and generate revenue. Specifically, environmental taxes can be divided into four main categories, under which all the ecotaxes fall. The categories are energy, transport, pollution and resource taxes.

=== Energy Taxes ===
The first type of ecotax, energy taxes, can vary greatly as they can be levied on the production, distribution, or consumption of energy sources, particularly fossil fuels like coal, oil, natural gas, and sometimes electricity. They are often aimed at influencing energy consumption patterns and behaviors, promoting energy efficiency, and encouraging the transition to cleaner and more sustainable energy sources. For example, they can influence energy consumption by levying larger ecotax rates on nonrenewable energy sources, which have a greater negative impact on the environment and contribute to high levels of CO2 emissions. This reduces the demand for unclean energy sources, and it can make renewable energy sources relatively more competitive, encouraging investment and consumption in clean energy technologies like solar, wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal power. Globally, the most commonly used environmental taxes fall in the category of “energy” taxes.  Energy taxes can be narrowed down further to “energy taxes for stationary purposes”, such as taxes on natural gas, coal and biofuels, “energy taxes for transport”, with petrol and diesel as the two most relevant examples, and lastly “greenhouse gasses”. Apart from the most common energy tax, carbon tax, another popular energy tax is the “coal excise tax” in the United States. The tax is levied on the producers, at the coal’s initial sale. Currently, the tax rate, after being increased by over 50% in 2020,  is $1.10 per ton for coal from subsurface mines and $0.55 per ton for coal from surface mines.The revenue is generated for a more specific purpose, which is to fund the Black Lung Program and the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. These entities pay benefits to miners who suffer from black lung disease. The tax continues to generate hundreds of millions of dollars each year despite the coal mining industry contracting, as the yearly revenue has shrunk from $644 million in 2008 to $177 million in 2022. It is important to note that governments, when imposing ecotaxes for the central purpose of revenue, generally tend to prefer energy taxes when levying environmental taxes due to the fact that energy demand tends to be quite inelastic in the short run, meaning that the government can use such taxes to gain immense revenue. This revenue can be used to reduce the budget deficit, where the majority of it goes to the general fund. However, the revenue earned can also be used to subsidize positive externality generating activities, which is called the “double dividend” of environmental tax. Furthermore, these taxes can reduce deadweight losses caused by negative externalities. For such reasons, many economists support energy taxes along with Environmentalists, where activists often highlight the importance of energy taxes in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the impact of climate change, while economists highlight the benefits of the taxes on the economy. Opponents, however, argue such taxes increase the cost of daily necessities, which harm the average consumer, especially those under the poverty line. Additionally, a strong argument against energy taxes is that they can be counterproductive, as it may encourage producers who are being taxed to relocate to countries in which there are weaker, or nonexistent energy taxes. This would negatively impact the domestic economy, as well as the climate, as a result of overambitious energy taxes. This is known as carbon leakage. 

=== Transport Taxes ===
The second most notable form of environmental tax globally is transport taxes. Such taxes range from being implemented on airplane tickets, to car purchases, or even motor registration. Transport fuels are, however, included in energy taxes.The category mostly consists of taxes on the usage or ownership of vehicles. An example of a common transport tax is the tax placed on vehicle registration. This tax is levied on registrations based on factors such as weight, fuel efficiency, or emissions, and it is used to both generate revenue, and to promote the ownership and usage of cleaner, and more fuel efficient vehicles. Another example is the tax imposed on cars entering areas of congestion, such as certain areas in New York City, and this can even be coupled with an additional ecotax on the usage of certain roads, for example through electronic tolling systems. Collectively, energy and transportation taxes make up the majority of the ecotaxes imposed globally. In 2021, the two taxes made up 96% of the ecotaxes implemented in the EU. The remaining 3% is made up of pollution and resource taxes. 

=== Resource and Pollution Taxes ===
Pollution taxes incorporate taxes on measured emissions to air and water, and the management of waste and noise pollution. An exception is CO2 taxes. A successful pollution ecotax is the “plastic bag tax” in Ireland. The country levies a €0.22 tax on plastic bags at the point of sale, with the hope of reducing consumption by reducing the demand for the bags due to the increase in cost. They successfully changed the consumer&#x27;s behavior, as can seen by the increase in the use of paper bags, a greener substitute, and due to the fall of plastic bags&#x27; contribution to the total litter pollution in Ireland from 5% to 0.13% in 14 years. It has also generated over €200 million in revenue, proving to be a huge revenue source for the government. The final categorization of ecotaxes, and arguably the least important form of ecotaxes is resource taxes. Within the category of resource ecotaxes lie taxes associated with the extraction or utilization of natural resources like water, forests, wildlife, and other forms of flora and fauna. These levies are imposed on activities leading to the depletion of natural resources. Resource taxes are the least prevalent ecotaxes. Resource depletion is usually covered by government fees, for example, determined by the amount and the type of resource extracted, as opposed to imposed taxes. 

==Taxes affected==

Examples of taxes which could be lowered or eliminated by a green tax shift are:
* Payroll, income, and, to a lesser extent, sales taxes.
* Corporate taxes (taxes on investment and entrepreneurship).
* Property taxes on buildings and other infrastructure.

Examples of ecotaxes which could be implemented or increased are:
* Carbon taxes on the use of fossil fuels by greenhouse gases produced. Old hydrocarbon taxes don&#x27;t penalize greenhouse gas (GHG) production.
* Duties on imported goods containing significant non-ecological energy input (to a level necessary to treat fairly local manufacturers)
* Severance taxes on the extraction of mineral, energy, and forestry products.
* License fees for camping, hiking, fishing and hunting and associated equipment.
* Specific taxes on technologies and products which are associated with substantial negative externalities.
* Waste disposal taxes and refundable fees.
* Steering taxes on effluents, pollution and other hazardous wastes.
* Site value taxes on the unimproved value of land.

==Economic frameworks and strategies employing tax shifting==

The object of a green tax shift is often to implement a &quot;full cost accounting&quot; or &quot;true cost accounting&quot;, using fiscal policy to internalize market distorting externalities, which leads to sustainable wealth creation. The broader measures required for this are also sometimes called ecological fiscal reform, especially in Canada, where the government has generally employed this terminology. In some countries the name is eco-social market economy.

Tax shifting usually includes balancing taxation levels to be revenue-neutral for government and to maintain overall progressiveness. It also usually includes measures to protect the most vulnerable, such as raising the minimum income to file income tax at all, or an increase to pension and social assistance levels to offset increased costs of fuel consumption.

Basic economic theory recognizes the existence of externalities and their potential negative effects. To the extent that green taxes correct for externalities such as pollution, they correspond with mainstream economic theory. In practice, however, setting the correct taxation level or the tax collection system needed to do so is difficult, and may lead to further distortions or unintended consequences.

Taxes on consumption may take the &quot;feebate&quot; approach advocated by Amory Lovins, in which additional fees on less sustainable products—such as sport utility vehicles—are pooled to fund subsidies on more sustainable alternatives, such as hybrid electric vehicles.

However, they may simply act as incentives to change habits and make capital investments in newer more efficient vehicles or appliances or to upgrade buildings. Small changes in corporate tax rates for instance can radically change return on investment of capital projects, especially if the averted costs of future fossil fuel use are taken into account.

The same logic applies to major consumer purchases. A &quot;green mortgage&quot; such as a Location Efficient Mortgage, for example, recognizes that persons who do not drive cars and live generally energy-efficient lifestyles pay far less per month than others and accordingly have more to pay a heftier mortgage bill with. This justifies lending them much more money to upgrade a house to use even less energy overall. The result is a bank taking more per month from a consumer&#x27;s income as utilities and car insurance companies take less, and housing stock upgraded to use the minimum energy feasible with current technology.

Aside from energy, the refits will generally be those required to be maximally accommodating to remote work, permaculture gardens (for example green roofs), and a lifestyle that is generally localized in the community not based on commuting. It raises real estate valuations for not only the neighborhood but the entire surrounding region. Consumers living sustainable lifestyles in upgraded housing will generally be unwilling to drive around aimlessly shopping, for instance, to save a few dollars on their purchases. Instead, they&#x27;ll stay nearer to home and create jobs in grocery delivery and small organic grocers, spending substantially less money on gasoline and car operation costs even if they pay more for food.

==Progressive or regressive?==
Some green tax shift proposals have been criticized as being fiscally regressive (a tax with an average tax rate that decreases as the taxpayer&#x27;s income increases). Taxing negative externalities usually entails exerting a burden on consumption, and since the poor consume more and save or invest less as a share of their income, so that any shift towards consumption taxes can be regressive. In 2004, research by the Policy Studies Institute and Joseph Rowntree Foundation indicated that flat rate taxes on domestic rubbish, energy, water and transport use would have a relatively higher impact on poorer households.

==Ecotax policies enacted==

An ecotax has been enacted in Germany by means of three laws in 1998, 1999 and 2002. The first introduced a tax on electricity and petroleum, at variable rates based on environmental considerations; renewable sources of electricity were not taxed. The second adjusted the taxes to favor efficient conventional power plants. The third increased the tax on petroleum. At the same time, income taxes were reduced proportionally so that the total tax burden remained constant.

The regional government of Balearic Islands (then held by an ecosocialist coalition) established an ecotax in 1999. The Balearic Island suffer a high human pressure from tourism, that at the same time provides the main source of income. The tax (€1.00 per person per day) would be paid by visitors staying at tourist resorts. This was criticized by the conservative opposition as contrary to business interests, and they abolished the tax in 2003 after seizing back the government.

A variety of ecotaxes (often called &quot;severance taxes&quot;) have been enacted by various states in the United States. The Supreme Court of the United States held in &quot;Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana&quot;, 453 U.S. 609 (1981), that in the absence of federal law to the contrary, states may set ecotaxes as high as they wish without violating the Commerce Clause or the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.

Starting from January 1, 2018, China&#x27;s first green tax aimed at environmental protection, the Environmental Protection Tax, was officially implemented, replacing the pollution discharge fee system that had been in place for nearly 40 years. The environmental protection tax is declared and paid quarterly, and the first collection period will be from April 1 to 15, 2018. The scope of taxation is air, water, solid and noise pollutants directly discharged into the environment. At present, except for the Tibet Autonomous Region, all provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities have issued specific applicable tax amounts for taxable air pollutants and water pollutants in their regions in accordance with legal procedures.

==Worldwide implementation==

===United Kingdom===
In 1993, the conservative government introduced the Fuel Price Escalator, featuring a small but steady increase of fuel taxes, as proposed by Weizsäcker and Jesinghaus in 1992. The FPE was stopped in 2000, following nationwide protests; while fuel was relatively cheap in 1993, fuel prices were then among the highest in Europe.
Under the 1997–2007 Labour government, despite Gordon Brown’s promise to the contrary, green taxes as a percentage of overall taxes had actually fallen from 9.4% to 7.7%, according to calculations by Friends of the Earth.

In a 2006 proposal, the U.K.&#x27;s then-Environment Secretary David Miliband had the government in discussions on the use of various green taxes to reduce climate-changing pollution. Of the proposed taxes, which were meant to be revenue-neutral, Miliband stated: &quot;They&#x27;re not fundamentally there to raise revenue.&quot;

Miliband provided additional comments on their need, saying: &quot;&quot;Changing people&#x27;s behaviour is only achieved by &quot;market forces and price signals&quot;&quot;, and &quot;As our understanding of climate change increases, it is clear more needs to be done.&quot;

===Ukraine===
Starting in 1999, the Ukrainian government has been collecting an ecological tax, officially known as Environmental Pollution Fee (), which is collected from all polluting entities, whether it&#x27;s one-time or ongoing pollution and regardless of whether the polluting act was legal or illegal at the time.

===India===

The Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India, asked Madras School of Economics, Chennai, to undertake a study of taxes on polluting inputs and outputs in 2001. Raja Chelliah, Paul Appasamy, U.Sankar and Rita Pandey (Academic Foundation, 2007, New Delhi) recommended eco taxes on coal, automobiles, chlorine, phosphate detergents, chemical pesticides, chemical fertilizers, lead acid batteries and plastics. See Ecotaxes on polluting inputs and outputs, Academic Foundation, New Delhi,2007. The Finance Minister introduced a coal cess at the rate of Rs 50 per ton in 2010.

===China===
The Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress enacted a set of environmental regulations and taxes in 1979, labelled as the &#x27;Pollutant Discharge Fee&#x27; (PDF). The Pollutant Discharge Fee, has proved to work in some parts of the country such as Northern China, however has shown adverse effects in parts such as the Karst region of Southwest China, as the area has had a boom in industrialisation and urbanisation, which has caused regional water shortage and pollution. 

On 1 January 2018, China replaced its existing, long-lasting &quot;Pollutant Discharge Fee&quot; system, with an environmental protection tax which was set to put in place a &quot;green&quot; financial and taxation system, whilst encouraging pollution control and the treatment of polluted areas. The new tax has also helped battle problems from the Pollutant Discharge Fee, such as local governments exploiting loopholes in the system and sparing big companies from legal trouble.This new law provides five types of exemptions, including, among others, exemptions for eligible agricultural pollution, pollution from transportation, and pollution from sewage and household waste. Taxpayers may also enjoy a 25% reduction in return for cutting down their air and water pollution by 30% or more, below the proscribed level.

According to data released by the Ministry of Finance of China, China&#x27;s environmental protection tax will collect 20.5 billion yuan (RMB, the same below) in 2023, and 5.1 billion yuan in January and February 2024. Before the environmental protection tax was levied, many Chinese companies had to pay pollution discharge fees. Six years ago, the finance department of a thermal power plant in Chongqing calculated that if the power generation remained unchanged, the environmental protection tax to be paid would double the original pollution discharge fee. Transformation is imminent. The reason why thermal power plants are criticised for &quot;high pollution&quot; is that the key is backward technology, such as incomplete coal combustion and lack of flue gas treatment equipment. The power plant has carried out ultra-low emission transformation on all six generating units and added wind and dust suppression nets in the coal yard. The effect is immediate. In 2018, the first year of the implementation of the Environmental Protection Tax Law, the pollution equivalents generated by power plants decreased by 73.1% compared with 2017, and the environmental protection tax paid was 2.14 million yuan, which was 73% lower than the pollution discharge fee of 7.96 million yuan paid in 2017. If the enterprise is identified as an advanced manufacturing industry, it can even enjoy the advanced manufacturing industry value-added tax additional deduction policy.

===France===

The French government shared its intentions to establish a new fee on plane tickets with the purpose to fund environment-friendly alternatives, such as eco-friendly transport infrastructure, including rail. The proposed tax would range between 1.50 euros ($1.7) and 18 euros ($20) and apply to most flights departing from France. The French government expects the new tax to raise over 180 million euros ($200 million) from 2020.

==== The carbon tax ====

The carbon tax was implemented in 2014 after two unsuccessful attempts. It is not a specific tax but a component of domestic consumption taxes on fossil fuels, proportional to their carbon content. It is based on the &quot;polluter pays&quot; principle, ‘’ according to which all persons must contribute to the repair of the damage they cause to the environment ‘’. It puts a price on each ton of emitted to encourage consumers to move away from certain products or behaviors with high greenhouse gas emissions. In other words, to reduce the use of fossil fuels. It is a Pigouvian tax that encourages quantifying the costs of negative externalities of goods and services.

The carbon tax is in fact a &quot;carbon component&quot; integrated into the more global calculation of the domestic consumption tax on energy products, natural gas and coal. It is indexed to the carbon price, which serves as a climate reference for investment choices by public and private economic actors and is expressed in euros per ton of . The carbon tax takes the form of a fee rather than a tax or an environmental tax in the strict sense of the word. It is a non-mandatory levy paid only by the use of a polluting service or good 

===== Tax payers =====

The tax is paid by households (on gasoline or gas for example), companies and administrations. However, there are many exceptions: the most polluting large industries are subject to European regulations; air and sea transport are exempted by virtue of international agreements and European directives; national river transport, cabs, road transport of goods, public transport as well as agricultural uses are also exempted from this tax.

===== Results =====
Nearly 4 million tons of were avoided by France in 2018 thanks to its carbon tax, according to an OECD study, which represents a 5% reduction in emissions from the manufacturing sector between 2014 and 2018.

===== Reception by the public =====

The rapid increase in this tax (from 7 euros per ton in 2014 to 14 in 2015 and 44.6 euros in 2018) caused gasoline prices to explode, which, coupled with the increase in the price of petroleum products and natural gas, contributed to the birth of the yellow vest movement. 
Other debates take place on the transparency of the tax, indeed, although the receipts are estimated at 8 billion euros per year, the citizens do not really know what is done with it, which makes it even more difficult to accept.

<text>Puebla de Zaragoza (; ; ), formally Heroica Puebla de Zaragoza, formerly Puebla de los Ángeles during colonial times, or known simply as Puebla, is the seat of Puebla Municipality. It is the capital and largest city of the state of Puebla, and the fourth largest city in Mexico, after Mexico City, Monterrey, and Guadalajara. A viceregal era planned city, it is located in the southern part of Central Mexico on the main route between Mexico City and Mexico&#x27;s main Atlantic port, Veracruz—about east southeast of Mexico City and about west of Veracruz.

The city was founded in 1531 in an area called Cuetlaxcoapan, which means &quot;where serpents change their skin&quot;, between two of the main indigenous settlements at the time, Tlaxcala and Cholula. This valley was not populated in the 16th century, as in the pre-Hispanic period this area was primarily used for the &quot;flower wars&quot; between a number of populations. Due to its history and architectural styles ranging from Renaissance to Mexican Baroque, the city was named a World Heritage Site in 1987. The city is also famous for mole poblano, chiles en nogada and Talavera pottery. However, most of its economy is based on industry.

Being both the fourth largest city in Mexico and the fourth largest Metropolitan area in Mexico, it has a current population of 3,344,000 people, and the city serves as one of the main hubs for eastern-central Mexico. Students from surrounding states attend its prestigious universities, such as BUAP, UDLAP, Ibero, among others. The city also excels in industry, having the world&#x27;s largest Volkswagen factory outside Germany, located in the Municipality of Cuautlancingo and an Audi plant in San José Chiapa. As a result, many suppliers to Volkswagen and Audi assembly plants have opened factories in the metropolitan area of Puebla.

==History==
===Pre-Columbian era===
Some historians consider that the area where the city is located nowadays was not inhabited in the Pre-Columbian era, except in the 15th century, when this valley was set aside for use for the so-called Flower wars among the populations of Itzocan, Tepeaca, Huejotzingo, Texmelucan and Tlaxcala, with those soldiers captured being used as sacrifice victims.

The foundation of Puebla begins with a letter from the bishop of Tlaxcala in 1530, Julián Garcés, to the Spanish queen outlining the need for a Spanish settlement between Mexico City and the port of Veracruz. According to legend, the bishop had a dream about where to build the city. In this dream, he saw a valley with woods and meadows crossed by a clear river and dotted with fresh-water springs on fertile land. While he was contemplating this scenery, he supposedly saw a group of angels descend from heaven and trace out the city. Convinced he had seen a divine vision, he celebrated Mass, and took some of the brothers out in search of the place. Five leagues from the monastery he declared they had found the place shown in the dream. This legend is the source of Puebla&#x27;s original name, Puebla de los Ángeles, and its current nickname Angelópolis (literally, &quot;City of Angels&quot;).

===Coat of arms===
The city&#x27;s coat of arms refers to a city (the castle with 5 towers) which is protected by angels; the letters K. V. refer to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor (), also referred to as Charles I of Spain; below are 7 rivers which cross the city.

===Colonial era===


The city was founded in 1531 within the Valley of Cuetlaxcoapan as a Spanish city, not on the foundation of an existing indigenous city-state. The official date of foundation is 16 April 1531, however, this first attempt at settlement failed due to constant flooding of the site right next to the river. Several rivers flow through the Valley of Puebla, the San Francisco, Atoyac and the Alseseca. This valley was bordered by the indigenous city-states turned colonial towns of Cholula, Tlaxcala, Huejotzingo and Tepeaca, all of which had large indigenous populations. After the city&#x27;s foundation, this valley became the main route between Mexico City and Veracruz, the port on the Caribbean coast and the connection to Spain.

Puebla was an important city and region in the history of New Spain, since it was in the center region of Spanish settlement, midway between the main port and the capital, had a large indigenous population, and drew many Spanish settlers. It supplied the capital with commercially grown agricultural products and became a center of local textile production. It was well connected to Mexico&#x27;s North, particularly the silver-mining region around Zacatecas.

Most of the population moved away from the west bank of the San Francisco River to a higher site. A few families remained behind and renamed the original settlement Alto de San Francisco. The Spanish Crown supported the founding of Puebla as a city without encomiendas, as this system was being abused and a number of Spaniards were finding themselves landless. Puebla received its coat-of-arms in 1538, and the titles &quot;Noble y Leal&quot; (Noble and Loyal) in 1558, &quot;Muy Noble y Leal Ciudad&quot; (Very Noble and Loyal City) in 1561 and &quot;Muy Noble y Muy Leal Ciudad&quot; (Very Noble and Very Loyal City) in 1576.

The layout of the city is of classic Spanish design, centered on a main plaza, today called the Zócalo. This main plaza originally was rectangular, but later made square because the earlier version was considered to be ugly. Another major feature of the city were the weekly markets (tianguis), in which indigenous sellers would come with their wares and foodstuffs to sell to the population. By the mid-16th century, water was brought in to the main plaza to a newly installed fountain. By the end of the century, the city occupied 120 blocks, much of which was under construction, with the new Cathedral begun in 1575. During the Union of Spain and Portugal (1580–1640), the city developed a sizeable Portuguese community. Trade ties with Portugal and a growing economy made the city an entrepôt for the transatlantic slave trade during the early 1600s.

Puebla&#x27;s favorable climate and strategic location helped the city to prosper, quickly becoming the second most important city in New Spain. Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla, the preeminent 17th-century composer in the New World, spent most of his life at the cathedral, from about 1620 to 1664.

The city council of Puebla, being made up of only Spaniards, had a certain amount of autonomy in the politics of the city and the land under its jurisdiction. This council annexed the towns of Amozoc, Totimehuacán, and Cuautinchán to its territory in 1755. By 1786, Puebla&#x27;s lands reached from what is now Veracruz to Guerrero states. The city continued to grow and be more regulated during the 17th and 18th centuries. A new city hall was built in 1714 and the tianguis in the main plaza was replaced by wood stalls by the 1770s. The streets were paved with stone between 1786 and 1811.

Commercial activity was dislodged from the main plaza completely by the early 19th century and placed in the San Francisco Parian market. Other plazas, such as the San Luis, San Antonio, El Carmen, La Concordia and Santa Inés were built. The main plaza underwent several transformations, adding statues and gardens. During the Mexican War of Independence, Puebla&#x27;s main role was the printing and distribution of the plan for independence. In 1827, after Independence, all Spaniards (&quot;peninsulares&quot;) were expelled from the city&#x27;s lands.

===Early Republican era===
In 1847, the city was taken by U.S. forces under General Winfield Scott, without a shot fired. The American garrison was besieged in the city from 14 September – 12 October 1847 by the irregular forces of General Joaquín Rea and later reinforced by Antonio López de Santa Anna. The siege was broken by the force of General Joseph Lane that fought its way from Veracruz into the city after defeating Santa Ana in the Battle of Huamantla on 9 October 1847. Puebla was then the base for General Lane&#x27;s campaign against General Rea and the other guerrillas that harassed the U. S. Army line of communications. These forces left in July 1848 after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was ratified.

During the French intervention in Mexico on 5 May 1862 in the Battle of Puebla, defending Mexican forces under Ignacio Zaragoza defeated the French army under Count de Lorencez. The city&#x27;s name was changed to Puebla de Zaragoza in 1862, by a decree issued by Benito Juárez and the holiday &quot;5 de Mayo&quot; (Cinco de Mayo) is a major annual event here. The city was attacked again by the French in 1863, who succeeded in taking it. French forces left in 1866 and reconstruction began in 1867.

During the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, Puebla remained important culturally and economically. It had a thriving textile industry at this time. Immigration from Europe was encouraged and people from Spain, Italy, Germany, France and Lebanon came to live in the city.

In what became a precursor to the Mexican Revolution, siblings Carmen, Máximo y Aquiles Serdán were behind one of the first conspiracies against the Porfirio Diaz government. Their plans were discovered and their house, located on 6 Oriente street was surrounded by federal troops. A gun battle ensued, killing both Serdán brothers on 18 November 1910. During the Mexican Revolution, the city was taken by forces under General Pablo Gonzalez Garza, then later was under Zapatista control.

===Recent events===

From 1931 until the end of the 20th century, growth of the city spurred the absorption of the municipalities of Ignacio Mariscal, San Felipe Hueyotlipan, Resurreccion, San Jeronimo Caleras, San Miguel Canoa and San Francisco Totimehuacán into the city. In 1950, by decree of the state congress, the city received the title of Heroica Puebla de Zaragoza. In 1977, the federal government declared the city a Zone of Historical Monuments. In 1987, the historic centre of Puebla was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

The City of Puebla submitted its candidacy to hold the headquarters of the Free Trade Area of the Americas, and briefly served as interim secretariat headquarters until negotiations were stopped in 2005.

==Municipality==
The municipality is located in the west-central region of the State of Puebla, bordering the municipalities of Santo Domingo Huehutlán, San Andrés Cholula, Teopantlán, Amozoc, Cuauthinchán, Tzicatlacoyan, Cuautlancingo, and Ocoyucan, and the State of Tlaxcala.

As municipal seat, the city of Puebla is the government for 482 other communities with a total area of 534.32km2. However, 94% of the municipality&#x27;s population of 1,485,941 lives in the city proper.

===Environment===
Most of the municipality has been deforested, including the lower portions of the Malinche volcano and all the Sierra de Amozoc, due to logging and seasonal farming.

The Sierra del Tentzon and higher elevations of Malinche volcano still conserve the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt pine-oak forests ecoregion – with forests of pine, holm oak and other tree species. In the pine forests, Montezuma Pine &quot;(Pinus montezumae)&quot; is generally predominant, with Hartweg&#x27;s Pine &quot;(Pinus hartwegii)&quot; and &quot;Pinus teocote&quot; in dry areas with shallow soils. Pine-fir forests are composed almost entirely of Hartweg&#x27;s Pine &quot;(Pinus hartwegii)&quot; and Sacred Fir &quot;(Abies religiosa)&quot;.

Animal life consists mostly of small mammals such as rabbits and skunks, as well as birds such as owls, buzzards and wild waterfowl.

==Geography==
Puebla is located at the Valley of Puebla also known as the Valley of Cuetlaxcoapan, a large valley surrounded on four sides by the mountains and volcanoes of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. It is located east of the Popocatépetl and Iztaccíhuatl volcanoes, giving residents views of their snow-topped peaks. Due to the proximity to the Popocatépetl, Puebla is sometimes exposed to the ash and dust that emanate from the volcano during its active periods, the most recent occurring on 19 May 2023.

La Malinche dormant volcano is located to the north of the city, and the Pico de Orizaba to the east. Hydrologically, the city is part of the Atoyac river basin; the river runs through northern, eastern and southern portions of the municipality, and connects to the Lake of Valsequillo, where the Manuel Ávila Camacho dam has been built. Other rivers that cross the area are the Alseseca and San Francisco.

==Climate==
Under the Köppen climate classification (Köppen: &quot;Cwb&quot;), Puebla features a subtropical highland climate, due to its tropical location but high altitude of around . In Mexico, the official designation is &quot;subhumid temperate climate with summer rains&quot;. It rarely gets truly hot in Puebla, with an average of only three days seeing temperatures rise above . Night temperatures are cool at all times of the year. Puebla experiences dry, temperate winter months (mid-October through February), warm springs (March to mid-May), and a monsoon season from mid-May to mid-October.

==Cultural attractions and tourism==

===Parks, squares and districts===

The historical and cultural value of Puebla&#x27;s architecture is a major reason the city was chosen as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Various styles and techniques such as Baroque, Renaissance and Classic are represented here in over 5,000 buildings included in the catalogue. The historic centre is filled with churches, monasteries, mansions and the like, mostly done in gray cantera stone, red brick and decorated with multicolored tiles. Puebla is also considered to be the &quot;cradle of Mexican Baroque&quot; both in architecture and in the decorative arts, and one of the five most important colonial cities in Mexico.

In spite of the many shopping malls that exist in Puebla today, the Zócalo, the main square, remains the cultural, political and religious center of the city. Many notable buildings surround the Zocalo including City Hall, the Casa de los Muñecos and the cathedral. Most of the streets in Puebla are named on a numbering system, which centers on the northwest corner of the Zocalo. El Parián is an arts and crafts market, within walking distance of the plaza. It consists mostly of permanent stalls but there is an area provided for vendors who visit and sell their wares on blankets spread on the ground.

Cuexcomate is a geyser cone thirteen meters tall with a diameter of 23 meters. The geyser is inactive and located in the La Libertad neighborhood of the city of Puebla. There is a spiral staircase going down into the crater itself.

Cuexcomate was mistakenly called the smallest volcano in the world due to its shape. However, this is a geyser, not a volcano. The word Cuexcomate comes from the Nahuatl &quot;clay pot&quot; or &quot;place to keep&quot; and has been used to store meals and dispose of dead bodies.

===Museums and galleries===

The Amparo Museum is housed in two colonial-era buildings from the 17th and 18th centuries that were popularly known as El Hospitalito. One was the Hospital of San Juan de Letrán, which was converted into a college for women. The other is a mansion from the 18th century. It was joined to the hospital and then became the &quot;Deposito de Mujeres Casadas&quot; (Refuge of Married Women) This was established in 1606 for women whose husbands were gone for long periods of time. However, the idea was not popular with women and in 1609, it became the asylum for &quot;lost women,&quot; those obligated to be secluded for some reason. This facility was moved to another building and the building became part of the women&#x27;s college founded next door, then a convent. The museum has fourteen exhibition halls with pottery, steles and sculptures from the Zapotec, Huasteca, Maya, Olmec and Aztec cultures as well as fine furniture and religious objects from the colonial period and examples of contemporary art. These represent the three epochs of Mexican history, pre-Columbian, colonial-era and post-Independence. Seven of the halls are dedicated to pre-Columbian pieces.

The Biblioteca Palafoxiana (Palafoxiana Library) was established in 1646 by Juan de Palafox y Mendoza for the Seminary of Puebla. He donated his own collection of 5,000 books to the College of San Juan to start the collection. It was the first public library in the Americas. The main room is in Baroque style and was constructed in 1773 by Bishop Francisco Fabian y Fuero who also named the institution after Palafox. Today the library contains over 42,000 books, 5,000 manuscripts and other items, which date from 1473 to 1910. The Library was named a Historic Monument of Mexico (Monumento Histórico de México) and UNESCO has made it a world heritage site.

The Centro Cultural Santa Rosa is housed in a building that dates from the 17th century which originally was housing for Dominican nuns. Later, it became a convent named in honour of Saint Rose of Lima. This is where the story of the invention of mole poblano takes place. In 1869, it ceased being a convent and became a psychiatric hospital. In the 20th century the Ceramic Museum was founded in the building&#x27;s kitchen, with the rest of the building occupied as tenements for about 1500 people. In 1973, the Museo de Arte Cultural Poblano was founded and in 2000 the name was changed to the current one. The facility offers exhibitions, shows and art classes.

The Museo de la Revolución (Museum of the Revolution) was the home of Aquiles Serdán in the very early 20th century. He was politically active in the anti-reelection (of President Porfirio Diaz) movement of the time and was accused of distributing propaganda against Díaz. Police assaulted the building and Serdán and his family fought back, until Aquiles was killed. President Francisco I. Madero stayed at the home in honor of Serdán. Shortly thereafter, the family moved to Mexico City and the building became tenements and stores. Decades later, the federal government acquired the building from the family to convert it into the museum that is here today.
Fort Loreto and Fort Guadalupe are located in the Centro Civico 5 de Mayo part of the city. Both were instrumental to the Battle of Puebla on 5 May 1862. The chapel of the Loreto fort contains a former chapel, which is now the Museo de la No Intervención (Museum of Non-Intervention). This is to commemorate a non-aggression pact signed by Mexico and Central American and two South American countries in the 1960s. The Museo de Guerra del Fuerte (Fort War Museum) de Loreto y Guadalupe is located in this fort as well. This museum contains cannons, shotguns, swords, documents and other objects related to this battle.

The Galería de Arte Contemporáneo y Diseño (Gallery of Contemporary Art and Design) is dedicated to visual arts such as painting, sculpture, ceramics, metal etching, photography, video, and others and belongs to the Secretary of Culture of the state of Puebla. It is housed in the old La Violeta textile factory, which dates back to 1908, and was one only many factories in this area at that time. This building was renovated between 1995 and 1998 for this museum.

The International Museum of the Baroque is a museum of Baroque art designed by Japanese architect Toyō Itō. It opened on February 4, 2016.

The Museo de José Mariano Bello y Acedo was initially founded with the private collection of the Bello family, along with works donated by friends. It originally began as a private museum or pinacotheca. Upon José Mariano&#x27;s death, the house and collection was bequeathed to the city.
The Casa de Alfeñique is named for the intricate mortar work that covers its façade. Alfeñique is a kind of sugar and almond candy. It was constructed by Antonio Santamaría de Incháurregui for Juan Ignacio Morales, who was a master ironsmith. The façades also contain ironwork balconies, cornices and a crown. The house was left to the state by Alejandro Ruiz Olavarrieta in 1896. It was first used to house the first public museum in the city of Puebla. The collection contains more than 1,500 pieces of a historical nature.

The Museo de Arte (Museum of Art) originally was constructed to be the Temple of San Pedro, founded in 1541 to be a church and a hospital. Eventually it was established as the Hospital of San Pedro y San Pablo under the direction of the Cathedral of Tlaxcala. It was functioning as a hospital by 1544, but it incurred major expenditures, forcing it to limit service to men only. The arches of the main courtyard were completed in 1640, as well as it fountain and nursing units. In the first half of the 18th century, the hospital ceased to be under the direct control of the cathedral, passing to the monks of the order of San Juan de Dios. In the latter half of the century, it began to house soldiers in order to improve its finances. The hospital underwent major reforms in the early 19th century to improve medical care, and began to receive medical students from the Medical-Surgical Academy of Puebla. In 1867, the facility became the Hospital General del Estado. In 1917, the hospital moved to new facilities in the city. Through most of the 20th century, the building was used for a wide-variety of purposes. In 1998, a project to restore the building for its use as Puebla Museum of Viceregal Art. In 2002, this museum was converted into the San Pedro Museum of Art, which exhibits works from various epochs.

The Museum Workshop of Erasto Cortés Juárez was the home of one of the major figures in fine and graphic arts in Puebla in the 20th century. The museum was founded in 2000 and contains more than 400 pieces of both his work and personal effects. The museum also hosts temporary exhibits, workshops and seminars.

===Cathedrals and churches===

Puebla Cathedral, located on 16 de Septiembre and 5 Oriente, took 300 years to complete, in part due to interruptions in its construction. The cathedral was begun in 1575 under orders of Philip II of Spain by architects Francisco Becerra and Juan de Cigorondo. The building was consecrated in 1649 even though only half of the walls and much of the roof were missing and the towers not yet built. The north tower was added in 1678 and the south tower in 1768.The shape of the cathedral is a Latin cross and contains five naves. The main altar is octagonal, with four others oriented to the cardinal directions The complex consists of fourteen chapels in various styles with numerous artistic works such as the main cupola and the main altar, both decorated by Cristóbal de Villalpando. The façade is classified as late Baroque in transition to Neoclassical, with Doric and Corinthian columns. Its bell towers stand at just under 70 meters high, the tallest in Mexico. The seating in the choir is made of parquetry of fine woods, onyx and ivory of Moorish design. The two organs were donated by Charles V. In the crypt under the cathedral, numerous statues of saints and angels made of onyx can be seen.

The Church and Friary of San Francisco is on Blvd Heroes del 5 de Mayo. Its elevated four-level tower stands out with its mouldings and Ionic and Doric pilasters. The main façade is done in gray cantera stone in which are sculpted large jars and flowers. The main portal is of Churrigueresque style, flanked by large panels of tilework surrounded by Plateresque decoration. Inside is a Plateresque choir, Neoclassic altarpieces and the mummified body of the beatified, and soon to be canonized as a saint, Sebastian de Aparicio.

The large friary complex houses an active group of Franciscan friars, who in addition to running a large K-12 school on the site, also work in other pastoral, justice, peace, and environmental activities.

The Church of Santo Domingo is located on 5 de Mayo Street. The main portal is of pure classic style finished in gray cantera stone. It consists of three levels with paired Doric-like columns. The façade of the old monastery is highly decorated in Baroque style, in front of which is a large atrium. Inside the ceiling consists of two large vaults and contains gilded altarpieces in Baroque, Salmonic and Churrigueresque styles.

The Chapel of the Rosary is located in the Church of Santo Domingo. The chapel was built between 1650 and 1690 and was the first to be dedicated to the Our Lady of the Rosary. The chapel is filled with symbolism, as it is filled with images and elements which are representative of the Baroque of New Spain. This symbolism is principally meant to aid with the evangelization process. The chapel contains three themes important to the Church, the mysteries of the rosary, the virtues associated with it and the Virgin of the Rosary herself. The cupola is in the shape of the crown of the Virgin Mary. The chapel is decorated with sculpted plaster that has been gilded done by local artists. There are also six paintings done by José Rodriguez Carnero as well as paintings by the altar depicting the life of the Virgin.

===Other notable buildings===
The Casa del Deán is the oldest noble house in the city of Puebla, constructed by Tomás de la Plaza Goes, who was the deacon of the Cathedral of Puebla. It was finished in 1580. The building remained practically intact until 1953, when it was going to be demolished to construct a movie theater. Protests to save the building, due to its murals and façade, succeeded in preserving only a portion of the building. The murals are frescos, which are the only surviving non-religious examples from the 16th century in their original place in Mexico. The gray stone façade is completely smooth to let the main portal, of Renaissance style, stand out. The portal contains and upper and lower portion with a crest.

The Teatro Principal de Puebla (Main Theater of Puebla) was inaugurated in 1761 by Miguel de Santamaría. In 1902, the theater burned down, and was rebuilt in 1940, and again in 1998. The theater hosts cultural events and art shows featuring regional, national and international artists.

The Municipal Palace is located on Maximino Avila Camacho. The façade is made of gray cantera stone in Renaissance style, using Ionic columns and pediments, differing from the other buildings that border the main plaza. The portal has two levels topped by a central garret, in which there is a clock and towers on each side.

The Fountain of the China Poblana is located on Blvd Heroes de 5 de May. It is a monumental work done in cantera stone and Talavera tile, with a base of about thirty meters in diameter. In the center is a column that supports two large bowls and a sculpture of the China Pobalana which is over three meters high. This fountain was inaugurated in September 1971. The monument was sculpted by Jesús Corro Ferrer, who portaraited the China Poblana using the image of his own wife - María del Consuelo López y Martínez. The Monument to Rafael Cabrera is also located in the city.

===Cuisine===
The best-known mole is named after the city of Puebla, mole poblano. The origin of this sauce is disputed and there are two versions of the legend that are most often cited. The first states that 16th century nuns from the Convent of Santa Rosa were worried because they had just found out that the archbishop was going to visit them and they had nothing to prepare for him except for an old turkey in the yard. Supposedly due to divine inspiration, they began to mix together many of the spices and flavorings they had on hand in the kitchen, including different types of chili peppers, other spices, day-old bread, chocolate and approximately twenty other ingredients. They let the sauce simmer for hours and poured it over the turkey meat. Fortunately, the archbishop was very pleased with the meal and the nuns were able to save face.

The other story states that the sauce is of pre-Hispanic times and this was served to Hernán Cortés and the other conquistadors by Moctezuma II. The Aztecs did have a preparation called &quot;chilmulli&quot;, which in Nahuatl means &quot;chili pepper sauce&quot;. However, there is no evidence that chocolate was ever used to flavor prepared foods or used in chilmulli. What has happened is that the sauce gained ingredients as it was reinterpreted over the colonial period.
Many food writers and gourmets nowadays consider one particular dish, the famous turkey in mole poblano, which contains chocolate, to represent the pinnacle of the Mexican cooking tradition.

Another famous dish, chiles en nogada, was also supposedly invented here. The story begins with three sisters from Puebla who met officers from Agustin de Iturbide&#x27;s Army of the Three Guarantees in Mexico City and fell in love with them. Attempts were made to engage the couples but one problem was that none of the sisters knew how to cook. Upon returning to Puebla, their mother sent them to the Convent of Santa Monica to learn. The women decided they wanted to make an original dish to impress Iturbide and his officers when they were due to visit Puebla. The dish, chiles en nogada, represents the colors of the Mexican flag, green (parsley), white (the walnut sauce) and red (pomegranate seeds). The dish was served for the first time at a banquet for Iturbide with great success.

Another signature dish in Puebla is the &quot;cemita&quot;, which is a type of well-stuffed sandwich on a bun. The cemita is considered to be &quot;the sister of the Mexican torta, the first cousin of the pambazo, the distant cousin of the paste and the sandwich and the precursor to the giant tortas&quot; that are now sold in most parts of Mexico today. This large, meaty sandwich is named after the bread on which it is served, a cemita. This bread is based on a bread introduced by the French during the period of the French Intervention in Mexico (1863–1867), but since then has evolved to suit Mexican tastes, especially in Puebla state. In the early 20th century, the bread began to be served sliced with a filling of leftovers, generally potatoes, beans, nopal, beef, chicken or pork. The Victoria Market in Puebla became famous for a version with beef hoof, onions and chili peppers with a vinaigrette sauce. Other markets and food stands soon created their own versions of the cemita with just about any kind of filling combination possible. During the same time period, it became traditional to sprinkle sesame seeds onto the cemita bread, often with designs of flowers, stars, animals and other things. While the dish started out as a lower-class meal, it is now enjoyed by people of all social classes in the city as a form of fast-food.

===Talavera pottery===

Soon after its foundation, Puebla was well known for its fine ceramics, especially for the style that would be called Talavera. This has been due to the abundance of quality clay in the region, drawing some of the best artisans. Between 1550 and 1570, Spanish potters from Talavera de la Reina in Spain came to Puebla to teach the locals European techniques of using the potter&#x27;s wheel and tin-glazing. These new methods were mixed with native designs to give rise to what became known as Poblano Talavera. The glazing technique was first used for the tiles that still decorate many of the buildings in this city. Later, it was used to make pots, plates, jars, religious figures and other items. By the mid-17th century, the industry here had become well-established. Guilds were formed and ordinances passed to ensure quality. Blue was used only on the most expensive pieces due to the cost of the mineral used to produce it. The period between 1650 and 1750 was known as the Golden Age.

In 1813, the constitution eradicated the potter&#x27;s guild and revoked the ordinances established in 1653 to standardize production. Now anybody could use this ceramic method in any style they wanted, and the lack of regulations led to a decline in technique and artistic quality. The Talavera market crashed. Out of the 46 workshops in production since the 18th century, only seven remained. When Enrique Luis Ventosa, a 29-year-old Catalan, arrived in Puebla in 1897, there were just six workshops left. Ventosa was fascinated by the history and fine craft work that had distinguished Puebla from the rest of Mexico. He became the leading force behind a renaissance in Talavera ware.

Another impetus to the rebirth of Puebla tile was that collectors found out about it. In 1904 an American named Emily Johnston de Forest traveled to Mexico with her husband and discovered Talavera. She established contact with scholars, collectors, and dealers who assisted her in building her collection. Eventually her collection was given to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Other museums, like the Philadelphia Museum of Art, built their own collections. The Franz Mayer Museum in Mexico City has the largest collection of 726 pieces.

===Story of the China Poblana===
According to colonial-era published sources, a young Indian woman named Mirra was kidnapped by Portuguese pirates and taken to Cochin (modern-day Kochi), in the south of India. There, she escaped her kidnappers and took refuge in a Jesuit mission, where she was baptized with the name &quot;Catarina de San Juan&quot;. Mirra was again kidnapped by the same pirates that had taken her from her birth parents, and in Manila they delivered her to the merchant who later took her to New Spain. Once in Acapulco, she was sold to a Puebla merchant by the name of Miguel de Sosa. Through her life, Catarina or Mirra continued to dress in a sari. It is possible that this gave rise to the &quot;china dress&quot; that became popular in Mexico in the 17th century. A few years after her arrival in Mexico, Miguel de Sosa died, providing in his will for the manumission of his slave. She was taken in by a convent, where it is said she began to have visions of the Virgin Mary and Baby Jesus. The &quot;China Poblana&quot; died on 5 January 1688 at the age of 82. In Puebla, she was venerated as a saint until 1691, when the Mexican Inquisition prohibited open devotion to her. Today, the Templo de la Compañía, in Puebla, is known as &quot;La Tumba de la China Poblana&quot; because in its sacristy lie the remains of Catarina de San Juan.

=== Tunnel system ===

There have long been rumours of a system of tunnels under the city. Long considered to be an urban legend, they were rediscovered in 2015. They are believed to be up to 500 years old and are thought to extend for more than 10 km.

==El Cinco de Mayo ==
Every year on 5 May, Puebla celebrates the defeat of invading French troops here in 1862. Celebrations include several days of concerts, lectures, other cultural activities. On the 5th itself, there is a very large parade and a re-enactment of the battle. The parade includes Mexican Army, Navy, Special Forces and soldiers dressed in period uniform. The military displays tanks, Humvees and armored personnel carriers. Civilian participation includes school bands, students and floats, both from Mexico and from abroad.

==Education==
Puebla has many universities, second in the country only after Mexico City. The main university of the city is the Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla (BUAP), the oldest and largest university in the region, founded on 15 April 1587. Other public university is the Instituto Tecnológico de Puebla (ITP). The city is also home for one of the most prestigious private universities in Mexico and Latin America, Tecnologico de Monterrey, Universidad Iberoamericana Puebla and the Universidad de las Americas Puebla (UDLAP).

==Sports==

Puebla has one professional football team, Puebla F.C. The biggest football stadium in the city, Cuauhtémoc Stadium, with a capacity of 51,720, was built in 1968 as a second football field for the 1968 Olympic Games. Matches for the 1970 and 1986 FIFA World Cups were also played in Cuauhtémoc Stadium. In 2015 it was intervened to make it up to new Fifa standards which commodity, modernism and outside visual image have changed for the better. With a capacity of 51,720 it is the 4th biggest stadium in México just behind Jalisco Stadium. At 45.9 meters tall it is also the highest stadium from parking level to the highest most part of the roof beating the second tallest Aztec stadium by 4 meters.

Puebla has a professional baseball team, the Pericos de Puebla.

Puebla, through the conurbated area of Cholula, has one college American football team, the &quot;Aztecas&quot; of the Universidad de las Américas. The Aztecas have won the championship three times since the creation of the Mexican College Football Organization (ONEFA) in 1978 (1995, 1996, and 1997). The team has been runners-up in the league five times, most recently in 2006 and 2007, losing the championship game all five times to the ITESM Campus Monterrey Borregos Salvajes. The Aztecas&#x27; home stadium is the &quot;Templo del Dolor&quot; (Temple of Pain).

==Economy==
Some agriculture still takes place in the municipality but environmental degradation and the growth of the city is making this a smaller sector of the economy. Crops raised include corn, beans, wheat, oats, avocados, pears, apples, peaches, choke cherries, Mexican hawthorns, nuts and white sapotes. Most agriculture takes place on small plots on the edges of the municipality. Similarly livestock such as cattle, pigs, sheep and horses are raised.

Industry accounts for about eighty percent of the economy and is mostly based in the outskirts of the city as well as in some surrounding municipalities. Main products include basic metals, chemicals, electrical items and textiles. The main employers are Hylsa and the Volkswagen automotive plant. A growing sector is food processing. Many industries are consolidated into parks such as the 5 de Mayo Industrial Park, the Resurrección Industrial Zone and the Puebla 2000 Industrial Park. Shopping centers include the Angelópolis Lifestyle Center and Parque Puebla.

==Transportation==
Puebla is served by Puebla International Airport, which is part of the metropolitan airport group for the Mexican capital and an alternate airport for Mexico City. It provides domestic services and flights to the United States. The airport is also used as a place to manufacture goods and export and import due to prime location.

In January 2013 the first line of the rapid transit bus system named RUTA was opened to the public from Chachapa to Tlaxcalancingo, in April 2014 the second line was inaugurated going from North 11th street at the height of Diagonal Defensores de la República to Calle Limones, and in 2019 the third line was added to the system, transporting passengers from Valsequillo to CAPU, the main hub for transport outside of the city. The Puebla-Cholula Tourist Train was inaugurated in January 2017 connecting Puebla with Cholula in the western end of the city. Operation of the tram-train ended on 31 December 2021.

Harding was born Dorothy Walton Gatley and was the daughter of a prominent United States Army officer. She was raised primarily in East Orange, New Jersey and graduated from East Orange High School. Having gained her initial acting experience in school drama classes, she decided on a career as an actress and moved across the Hudson River to New York City. Due to her father&#x27;s opposition to her career choice, she adopted the stage name Ann Harding.

After initial work as a script reader, Harding began to win roles on Broadway and in small semiprofessional theaters, primarily in Pennsylvania. Around the late 1920s she moved to California to begin working in motion pictures, which were just beginning to include sound.

Her work in plays had given her notable diction and stage presence, and she was quickly tapped for leading lady roles. By the late 1930s, she was becoming stereotyped as the beautiful, innocent, self-sacrificing woman, and film work became harder for her to obtain. After marrying conductor Werner Janssen in 1937, she worked only sporadically, with three notable roles coming in &quot;Eyes in the Night&quot; (1942), &quot;It Happened on Fifth Avenue&quot; (1947) and &quot;The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit&quot; (1956).

She worked occasionally in television between 1955 and 1965, and she appeared in two plays in the early 1960s, returning to the stage after an absence of over 30 years, including the lead in &quot;The Corn is Green&quot; in 1964 at the Studio Theater in Buffalo, New York.

After her 1965 retirement, she resided in Sherman Oaks, California, where she would die in 1981, and she was interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the Hollywood Hills.

==Early years==
Harding was born Dorothy Walton Gatley at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas to George G. Gatley, a career army officer, and Elizabeth &quot;Bessie&quot; Walton (Crabb) Gatley. After travelling often during her early life because of her father&#x27;s military career, she grew up in East Orange, New Jersey, graduated from East Orange High School, and attended Bryn Mawr College. Her father &quot;violently opposed her profession,&quot; so Harding changed her name when she began her acting career.

==Career==

Harding&#x27;s initial employment in the entertainment industry began as a script analyst. She then began acting and made her Broadway debut in &quot;Like a King&quot; in 1921. Three years later she found her &quot;home theater&quot; in Rose Valley, Pennsylvania, after being directed by Hedgerow Theatre founder Jasper Deeter in &quot;The Master Builder.&quot; Over the years she returned to Hedgerow to reprise several of her roles. She soon became a leading lady; she kept in shape by using the services of Sylvia of Hollywood. She was a prominent actress in Pittsburgh theatre for a time, performing with the Sharp Company and later starting the Nixon Players with Harry Bannister. In 1929, she made her film debut in &quot;Paris Bound&quot;, opposite Fredric March. In 1931, she purchased the Hedgerow Theatre building from Deeter for $5,000 and donated it to the company.
First under contract to Pathé, which was subsequently absorbed by RKO Pictures, Harding was promoted as the studio&#x27;s &#x27;answer&#x27; to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s superstar Norma Shearer. She co-starred with Ronald Colman, Laurence Olivier, Myrna Loy, Herbert Marshall, Leslie Howard, Richard Dix, and Gary Cooper, and was often on loan to other studios, such as MGM and Paramount. At RKO, Harding, along with Helen Twelvetrees and Constance Bennett, comprised a trio who specialized in the &quot;women&#x27;s pictures&quot; genre.

Harding&#x27;s performances were often heralded by the critics, who cited her diction and stage experience as assets to the then-new medium of &quot;talking pictures.&quot; In Harding&#x27;s second film, &quot;Her Private Affair,&quot; she portrayed a wife of questionable morality, and the film was a commercial success. During this period, she was generally considered to be one of cinema&#x27;s most beautiful actresses, with her waist-length blonde hair being one of her most noted physical attributes. Films during her peak include &quot;The Animal Kingdom,&quot; &quot;Peter Ibbetson,&quot; &quot;When Ladies Meet,&quot; &quot;The Flame Within,&quot; and &quot;Biography of a Bachelor Girl.&quot; Harding, however, eventually became stereotyped as the innocent, self-sacrificing young woman. Following lukewarm responses by both critics and the public to several of her later 1930s films, she eventually stopped making movies after she married the conductor Werner Janssen in 1937. She returned to the big screen in 1942 to make &quot;Eyes in the Night&quot; and to take secondary roles in other films. She played &quot;Mary,&quot; the estranged wife of Charlie Ruggles, in the Christmas film &quot;It Happened on Fifth Avenue&quot; in 1947. In 1956, she again starred with Fredric March in &quot;The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit.&quot;

The 1960s marked Harding&#x27;s return to Broadway after an absence of decades—having last appeared in 1927. In 1962, she starred in &quot;General Seeger,&quot; directed by and co-starring George C. Scott, and in 1964 she appeared in &quot;Abraham Cochrane&quot; (&quot;her last New York stage appearance&quot;). Both productions had brief runs, with the former play lasting a mere three performances (including previews). Harding made her final acting performance in 1965 in an episode of television&#x27;s &quot;Ben Casey&quot; before retiring.

==Personal life==
Harding was married twice, her husbands being:

*Harry Bannister, an actor. They married in 1926 and divorced in 1932 in Reno, Nevada. A &quot;New York Times&quot; article (May 8, 1932) about the divorce stated that the actress still loved her husband and only agreed to a divorce to help Bannister&#x27;s stymied career. &quot;The proceedings were among the most unusual in the history of Nevada&#x27;s liberal divorce laws,&quot; the newspaper reported. &quot;Only through dissolution of their marriage could he escape, they said, from being overshadowed by Miss Harding&#x27;s rise to stardom.&quot; The divorce also resulted in what was described as &quot;a bitter court fight ... over custody of their daughter&quot;, Jane Harding (1928–2005, married name Jane Otto). According to an interview with Harding&#x27;s biographer, Scott O&#x27;Brien, Jane Harding said, &quot;I had a terrible childhood. I hated my nurse. I never saw mother. She was always busy.&quot; 
*Werner Janssen, the conductor. Harding and Janssen married in 1937 and divorced in 1963, with Harding claiming that her husband had controlled her throughout their marriage, keeping her from her friends and isolating her from the world. By this marriage, Harding had two stepchildren, Alice and Werner Jr.

Among Harding&#x27;s romances was the novelist and screenwriter Gene Fowler. In the early 1960s, Harding began living with Grace Kaye, an adult companion, later known as Grace Kaye Harding. Ann Harding referred to Kaye as her daughter.

Harding campaigned for the reelection of President Herbert Hoover in 1932.

==Death==
On September 1, 1981, Harding died at the age of 79 in Sherman Oaks, California. 

She was survived by a daughter, named Jane Otto, and four grandchildren.

==Recognition==
Harding was honored with a block in the forecourt of Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre on August 30th, 1930.

Harding was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for &quot;Holiday&quot; in 1931. 

For her contributions to the motion picture and television industries, Harding has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame—one in the Motion Pictures section at 6201 Hollywood Boulevard and one in the Television section at 6850 Hollywood Boulevard. The ceremony for both stars was held on February 8, 1960.

As of October 7, 2023, there is a plaque memorializing Ann Harding inside Hedgerow Theatre.

<text>The University of Missouri System is an American state university system providing centralized administration for four universities, a health care system, an extension program, and ten research and technology parks. Over 61,500 students (Fall 2023) are currently enrolled at its four campuses. The health care system operates several hospitals and clinics in central Missouri, while the extension program provides distance learning and other educational initiatives statewide.

The UM System was created in 1963 when the University of Missouri (founded in 1839 in Columbia) and the Missouri School of Mines (now the Missouri University of Science and Technology, founded in 1870 in Rolla), were combined with the formerly private University of Kansas City (now University of Missouri–Kansas City, founded in 1933), and a newly created campus in suburban St. Louis (University of Missouri–St. Louis) in 1963.

==Components==
===Universities===

All four campuses are comprehensive, separately accredited, land-grant/research-intensive institutions offering undergraduate, graduate, and professional degree programs.

* University of Missouri (Mizzou, or MU) is the oldest campus, founded in Columbia in 1839. It is the largest university in the state with 31,041 students (Fall 2023). MU is considered the flagship of the system and offers over 270 degree programs through 20 schools and colleges, and is the only public university in Missouri that is a member of the Association of American Universities. Its Tigers athletic programs compete in the NCAA Division I Southeastern Conference.

* University of Missouri–Kansas City (UMKC), founded in 1933, is the largest school in the Kansas City metropolitan area with 15,327 students (Fall 2023). It offers over 150 degree programs through 12 schools and colleges, but is best known for its programs in health sciences, entrepreneurship programs, and its Conservatory of Music and Dance. Its athletic programs, the Kansas City Roos, compete in the NCAA Division I Summit League.

* Missouri University of Science and Technology (Missouri S&amp;T or S&amp;T) was founded in 1870 in Rolla. Currently enrolling 7,159 students (Fall 2023) it is the smallest campus in the system. 75 degrees and emphases are offered across a comprehensive range of programs in sciences, mathematics, liberal arts, humanities, and business, but most are focused on engineering. Its Miners athletic programs compete in the NCAA Division II Great Lakes Valley Conference (GLVC).

* University of Missouri–St. Louis (UMSL) was founded in 1963 in suburban St. Louis County. Enrolling 8,023 (Fall 2023). Over 80 degree programs are offered through nine schools and colleges, including Missouri&#x27;s only College of Optometry. Its Tritons athletic programs compete alongside the Missouri S&amp;T Miners in the GLVC.

===Health care===
The University of Missouri Health Care system operates several facilities in central Missouri, including University Hospital (the only Level I trauma center in central Missouri) and Ellis Fischel Cancer Center (the only hospital in Missouri specializing in cancer treatment). It is also closely affiliated with MU&#x27;s School of Medicine, University of Missouri School of Health Professions, Sinclair School of Nursing, and University of Missouri-Kansas City Doctor of Pharmacy at MU satellite program.

It employs 4,515 employees.

===Extension===
Using science-based knowledge, University of Missouri Extension engages people to understand change, solve problems and make informed decisions.

MU Extension makes university education and information accessible for:
* Economic viability
* Empowered individuals
* Strong families and communities
* Healthy environments.

University of Missouri Extension is a partnership of the University of Missouri-Columbia, Lincoln University, the people of Missouri through county extension councils, and the National Institute for Food and Agriculture of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

MU Extension offers distance learning, Mizzou Online, continuing education, evening classes. Programs in agriculture, natural resources, lawn and garden, home and consumer life, nutrition and health, families and relationships, community and leadership, business and careers, and emergency management are available through offices throughout the state.

===Research and technology parks===
As part of its economic development mission to support high-tech growth in Missouri, the UM System owns and operates 10 research parks throughout the state.

*Missouri Research Park is a park in Weldon Spring created in 1985. It is home to over a dozen high-tech companies and helped catalyze a high-tech corridor along I-64.
*Technology Park at Fort Leonard Wood in St. Robert is the first technology park in the nation to be located on an active Army post. It houses the MRP Business Center, which was created to be a catalyst for partnerships between the military, corporations, and academia.
*Discovery Ridge, near Columbia, was established in 2005 on of MU&#x27;s South Farm, a agricultural experiment station operated by MU&#x27;s College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources. The park is jointly operated by the UM System&#x27;s Office of Research and Economic Development and MU.
*Innovation Park in Rolla was announced in April 2007. The former golf course will be &quot;a research, development and office park project&quot; jointly operated by the UM System&#x27;s Office of Research and Economic Development and Missouri S&amp;T.
* UMSL Research Park is a park on UMSL&#x27;s north campus. It is home to Express Scripts&#x27; new corporate headquarters, which opened in June 2007. The park is jointly operated by the UM System&#x27;s Office of Research and Economic Development and UMSL.
* Innovative Technology Enterprises at UMSL is a business incubator that supports innovation in a wide-variety of fields including IT and the life sciences, providing the physical, mentoring, business development and computational resources required for startup companies to grow.
* Center for Emerging Technologies (CET) has provided the specialized facilities, knowledgeable support services, entrepreneur training programs, and access to capital needed to establish and develop next generation bioscience, medical and other advanced technology companies. CET&#x27;s operations began in 1998 and are supported by the Missouri Technology Corporation, City of St. Louis and private donors
* Center of Research, Technology and Entrepreneurial Exchange (CORTEX) is an office and research district in mid-town St. Louis created by a nonprofit consortium formed by the University of Missouri-St. Louis, Saint Louis University, Washington University, Barnes-Jewish Hospital, and the Missouri Botanical Garden.
* Missouri Plant Science Center in Mexico is a partnership between the University of Missouri, Missouri Technology Corporation and the City of Mexico. The nearly 25,000 sq. ft. facility houses wet and dry labs, offices and has unique pilot/scale manufacturing capabilities to process soybeans and other plant-derived materials into value-added products.
* MU Life Science Business Incubator at Monsanto Place – The facility and incubation program in Columbia, MO, are operated by the Missouri Innovation Center, a public non-profit organization specializing in assistance to entrepreneurial technology firms.

===Press===
The University of Missouri Press was established in 1958 and today publishes over 70 titles per year, including several series such as the &quot;Missouri Biography Series&quot;. It also distributes books for the Missouri Historical Society Press.

===Students organization===
The Associated Students of the University of Missouri is a student run organization that represents the students of all four UM system campuses in Jefferson City and Washington, D.C. It was created in 1975 by the Missouri Students Association. ASUM has an internship program that lobbies the Missouri General Assembly on a regular basis pertaining to student issues including equalizing the Access Missouri tuition grant, increasing funding for the Bright Flight Scholarship, and giving the student representative to the UM Board of Curators a vote.

==Administration==

===Organization===
The UM System is governed by a board of curators, consisting of nine members appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the Missouri Senate. Curators serve six-year terms, staggered by three positions expiring every two years. Not more than one curator can be appointed from the same congressional district, and no more than five curators can belong to the same political party. In addition, there is a non-voting student representative to the board, likewise appointed and confirmed, who serves a two-year term. The post is rotated among the four universities. Presently, the post is held by Avery Welker from the S&amp;T campus.

The board of curators selects the president of the system, who reports to the board along with the general counsel. Each campus is led by a chancellor who reports to the president, as does an executive vice president, four vice presidents, and a chief of staff. The president chairs the University of Missouri Health System advisory board.

===Presidents===
There have been ten presidents of UM System since its inception in 1963. Prior to the formation of the system, the position of president was more akin to what is now chancellor of the Columbia campus. However, the UM System counts presidents who served before the system was created, therefore the numbering starts at 14. See University of Missouri#Presidents and chancellors for a list of presidents from 1841 to 1963 and chancellors from 1963–present. This list does not include all interim presidents.

==History==
The University of Missouri was founded in 1839 in Columbia. It was the first public institution of higher learning west of the Mississippi River. It became a land-grant university after passage of the Morrill Act of 1862. In 1870, the University established the &quot;Missouri School of Mines and Metallurgy&quot; in Rolla.

The UM System was created in 1963 when the University of Kansas City, which had been a private institution, was acquired and renamed &quot;University of Missouri-Kansas City&quot;. That same year, a new university named University of Missouri-&quot;St. Louis&quot; was created. In 1964, the &quot;School of Mines&quot; ‡ was renamed &quot;the University of Missouri-Rolla&quot;, and the original university in Columbia was renamed &quot;University of Missouri-Columbia&quot;. Effective January 1, 2008, &quot;UM–Rolla&quot; became the &quot;Missouri University of Science and Technology&quot;.

===Naming===
Since its founding in 1839 until the formation of the system in 1963, the institution in Columbia was known simply as the University of Missouri. When the University of Missouri System was established, the existing institutions—the University of Missouri in Columbia and its offshoot, the Missouri School of Mines and Metallurgy in Rolla were renamed the University of Missouri–Columbia and the University of Missouri–Rolla. The formerly private institution acquired by the system, the University of Kansas City, was renamed the University of Missouri–Kansas City. The newly created institution in St. Louis was suitably named the University of Missouri–St. Louis, thus creating a uniformly named system of institutions.

The original generic name, the University of Missouri, was not officially assigned to any of the schools or the system. However, it has been commonly used both formally and informally to mean the original Columbia campus or the system. It has also been used to mean any of the other three campuses, though this is most often done in a casual manner at the campus in question, or by persons unfamiliar with the system. All four campuses have felt their regional designations potentially cause them to be mistaken as second-tier regional institutions. Considerable controversy over use of the generic name has been caused by the Columbia campus claiming de facto ownership, further marginalizing the other three campuses.

The Rolla campus was first to enact a break from regional designation. On 6 April 2007, the board of curators approved a proposal to rename the school the Missouri University of Science and Technology, effective 1 January 2008. In addition to ridding itself of a regional designation, it also emphasizes the school&#x27;s technological research mission. This quickly catalyzed a long-dormant &quot;name restoration&quot; campaign at the Columbia campus to drop its regional designation. This proposal met with considerable criticism, mainly from the Kansas City and St. Louis campuses, who saw this as unnecessary or unfair and an intentional detriment to their campuses. On 29 November 2007, the board of curators voted unanimously to allow the Columbia campus to use the generic University of Missouri name for essentially all public purposes, but not when dealing with &quot;official business&quot; such as budget documents, legal contracts, and other internal UM System documentation, or whenever clarification from the system or other campuses is needed. Use of the generic name is not compulsory and the Columbia designation may continue to be used in any context. The decision also stipulates that the UM System utilize the &quot;System&quot; designation in most instances. Proponents of the change say that it simply provides clarification and recognizes what has always been common usage, but the issue remains controversial.

Southwest Missouri State University sought and eventually was granted permission to drop its regional designation and become Missouri State University. This change was initially vehemently opposed by the UM System, as it saw this as a threat to its funding and its stature as the premier public institution of higher learning in Missouri. It also would create historic entanglements, as the University of Missouri had interchangeably used the Missouri State University name at times in its history. This resulted from MU being designated as both a land grant and a research institution, unlike states such as Iowa where separate institutions (University of Iowa and Iowa State University) were created.

===Proposed merger===
In April 2003, Northwest Missouri State University in Maryville approached the UM System with the possibility of becoming the fifth school in the system. Name proposals for the university after the merger, such as the University of Missouri–Northwest, were to reflect the school&#x27;s separate heritage. The Maryville institution would have become a doctoral degree-granting research university of equal stature with the existing UM System universities. However, the enabling legislation before the Missouri General Assembly never passed and the deal sunset. There have been no further attempts at a merger.

=== 2015 racial controversies, protests, and resignations ===
In 2015, Wolfe was the subject of criticism from a variety of groups over his failure to address a series of racist incidents at the University of Missouri, including students openly using racial slurs towards minority student leaders, and an October incident where feces was used to draw a swastika, drawing condemnation from black and Jewish student organizations. In November 2015, Missouri&#x27;s Legion of Black Collegians announced that approximately thirty athletes would not participate in any team activities unless Wolfe resigned. On November 8, 2015, the Missouri Student Association joined in calling for Wolfe&#x27;s resignation.

On November 9, 2015, Wolfe resigned at a special Board of Curators meeting that morning. In a statement, he said, &quot;My motivation in making this decision comes from a love of Columbia where I grew up and the state of Missouri. I thought and prayed over this decision. It is the right thing to do. ... The frustration and anger I see is real and I don&#x27;t doubt it for a second. ... I take full responsibility for the actions that have occurred. I have asked everybody to use my resignation to heal. Let&#x27;s focus in changing what we can change today and in the future, not what we can&#x27;t change in the past.&quot;

<doc id="177765" wikidata="Q3302930" url="?curid=177765" title="Feminist economics">
<text>Feminist economics is the critical study of economics and economies, with a focus on gender-aware and inclusive economic inquiry and policy analysis. Feminist economic researchers include academics, activists, policy theorists, and practitioners. Much feminist economic research focuses on topics that have been neglected in the field, such as care work, intimate partner violence, or on economic theories which could be improved through better incorporation of gendered effects and interactions, such as between paid and unpaid sectors of economies. Other feminist scholars have engaged in new forms of data collection and measurement such as the Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM), and more gender-aware theories such as the capabilities approach. Feminist economics is oriented toward the social ecology of money.

Feminist economists call attention to the social constructions of traditional economics, questioning the extent to which it is positive and objective, and showing how its models and methods are biased by an exclusive attention to masculine-associated topics and a one-sided favoring of masculine-associated assumptions and methods. While economics traditionally focused on markets and masculine-associated ideas of autonomy, abstraction and logic, feminist economists call for a fuller exploration of economic life, including such &quot;culturally feminine&quot; topics such as family economics, and examining the importance of connections, concreteness, and emotion in explaining economic phenomena.

Many scholars including Ester Boserup, Marianne Ferber, Drucilla K. Barker, Julie A. Nelson, Marilyn Waring, Nancy Folbre, Diane Elson, Barbara Bergmann and Ailsa McKay have contributed to feminist economics. Waring&#x27;s 1988 book &quot;If Women Counted&quot; is often regarded as the &quot;founding document&quot; of the discipline. By the 1990s feminist economics had become sufficiently recognised as an established subfield within economics to generate book and article publication opportunities for its practitioners.

==Origins and history==
Early on, feminist ethicists, economists, political scientists, and systems scientists argued that women&#x27;s traditional work (e.g. child-raising, caring for sick elders) and occupations (e.g. nursing, teaching) are systematically undervalued with respect to that of men. For example, Jane Jacobs&#x27; thesis of the &quot;Guardian Ethic&quot; and its contrast to the &quot;Trader Ethic&quot; sought to explain the undervaluing of guardianship activity, including the child-protecting, nurturing, and healing tasks that were traditionally assigned to women.

Written in 1969 and later published in the &quot;Houseworker&#x27;s Handbook&quot;, Betsy Warrior&#x27;s &quot;Housework: Slavery or a Labor of Love and The Source of Leisure Time&quot; presents a cogent argument that the production and reproduction of domestic labor performed by women constitutes the foundation of all economic transactions and survival; although, unremunerated and not included in the GDP. According to Warrior: &quot;Economics, as it&#x27;s presented today, lacks any basis in reality as it leaves out the very foundation of economic life. That foundation is built on women&#x27;s labor; first her reproductive labor which produces every new laborer (and the first commodity, which is mother&#x27;s milk and which sustains every new consumer/laborer); secondly, women&#x27;s labor entails environmentally necessary cleaning, cooking to make raw materials consumable, negotiating to maintain social stability and nurturing, which prepares for market and maintains each laborer. This constitutes women&#x27;s continuing industry enabling laborers to occupy every position in the work force. Without this fundamental labor and commodity there would be no economic activity nor we would have survived to continue to evolve.&quot; Warrior also notes that the unacknowledged income of men from illegal activities like arms, drugs and human trafficking, political graft, religious emoluments and various other undisclosed activities provide a rich revenue stream to men, which further invalidates GDP figures. Even in underground economies where women predominate numerically, like trafficking in humans, prostitution and domestic servitude, only a tiny fraction of the pimp&#x27;s revenue filters down to the women and children he deploys. Usually the amount spent on them is merely for the maintenance of their lives and, in the case of those prostituted, some money may be spent on clothing and such accouterments as will make them more salable to the pimp&#x27;s clients. For instance, focusing on just the US, according to a government sponsored report by the Urban Institute in 2014, &quot;A street prostitute in Dallas may make as little as $5 per sex act. But pimps can take in $33,000 a week in Atlanta, where the sex business brings in an estimated $290 million per year.&quot; Warrior believes that only an inclusive, facts-based economic analysis will provide a reliable bases for future planning for environmental and reproductive/population needs.

In 1970, Ester Boserup published &quot;Woman&#x27;s Role in Economic Development&quot; and provided the first systematic examination of the gendered effects of agricultural transformation, industrialization and other structural changes. This evidence illuminated the negative outcomes that these changes had for women. This work, among others, laid the basis for the broad claim that &quot;women and men weather the storm of macroeconomic shocks, neoliberal policies, and the forces of globalization in different ways.&quot; Moreover, measures such as employment equity were implemented in developed nations in the 1970s to 1990s, but these were not entirely successful in removing wage gaps even in nations with strong equity traditions.
In 1988, Marilyn Waring published &quot;If Women Counted: A New Feminist Economics&quot;, a groundbreaking and systematic critique of the system of national accounts, the international standard of measuring economic growth, and the ways in which women&#x27;s unpaid work as well as the value of Nature have been excluded from what counts as productive in the economy. In the foreword to the 2014 anthology &quot;Counting on Marilyn Waring&quot;, Julie A. Nelson wrote: 
:&quot;Marilyn Waring&#x27;s work woke people up. She showed exactly how the unpaid work traditionally done by women has been made invisible within national accounting systems, and the damage this causes. Her book ... encouraged and influenced a wide range of work on ways, both numerical and otherwise, of valuing, preserving, and rewarding the work of care that sustains our lives. By pointing to a similar neglect of the natural environment, she also issued a wake-up call to issues of ecological sustainability that have only grown more pressing over time. In recent decades, the field of feminist economics has broadened and widened to encompass these topics and more.&quot;

Supported by formation of the Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession (CSWEP) in 1972, gender-based critiques of traditional economics appeared in the 1970s and 80s. The subsequent emergence of Development Alternatives with Women for a New Era (DAWN) and the 1992 founding of the International Association for Feminist Economics (IAFFE) along with its journal &quot;Feminist Economics&quot; in 1994 encouraged the rapid growth of feminist economics.

As in other disciplines, the initial emphasis of feminist economists was to critique the established theory, methodology, and policy approaches. The critique began in microeconomics of the household and labor markets and spread to macroeconomics and international trade, ultimately extending to all areas of traditional economic analysis. Feminist economists pushed for and produced gender aware theory and analysis, broadened the focus on economics and sought pluralism of methodology and research methods.

Feminist economics shares many of its perspectives with ecological economics and the more applied field of green economy, including the focus on sustainability, nature, justice and care values.

==Critiques of traditional economics==
Although there is no definitive list of the principles of feminist economics, feminist economists offer a variety of critiques of standard approaches in economics. For example, prominent feminist economist Paula England provided one of the earliest feminist critiques of traditional economics as she challenged the claims that:

*That interpersonal utility comparisons are impossible;
*That tastes are exogenous and unchanging;
*That actors are selfish; and
*That household heads act altruistically.

This list is not exhaustive but does represent some of the central feminist economic critiques of traditional economics, out of the wide variety of such viewpoints and critiques.

===Normativity===
Many feminists call attention to value judgments in economic analysis. This idea is contrary to the typical conception of economics as a positive science held by many practitioners. For example, Geoff Schneider and Jean Shackelford suggest that, as in other sciences, &quot;the issues that economists choose to study, the kinds of questions they ask, and the type of analysis undertaken all are a product of a belief system which is influenced by numerous factors, some of them ideological in character.&quot; Similarly, Diana Strassmann comments, &quot;All economic statistics are based on an underlying story forming the basis of the definition. In this way, narrative constructions necessarily underlie all definitions of variables and statistics. Therefore, economic research cannot escape being inherently qualitative, regardless of how it is labeled.&quot; Feminist economists call attention to the value judgements in all aspects economics and criticize its depiction of an objective science.

===Free trade===
A central principle of mainstream economics is that trade can make everyone better off through comparative advantage and efficiency gains from specialization and greater efficiency. Many feminist economists question this claim. Diane Elson, Caren Grown and Nilufer Cagatay explore the role that gender inequalities play in international trade and how such trade reshapes gender inequality itself. They and other feminist economists explore whose interests specific trade practices serve.

For example, they may highlight that in Africa, specialization in the cultivation of a single cash crop for export in many countries made those countries extremely vulnerable to price fluctuations, weather patterns, and pests. Feminist economists may also consider the specific gendered effects of trade-decisions. For instance, &quot;in countries such as Kenya, men generally controlled the earnings from cash crops while women were still expected to provide food and clothing for the household, their traditional role in the African family, along with labor to produce cash crops. Thus women suffered significantly from the transition away from subsistence food production towards specialization and trade.&quot; Similarly, since women often lack economic power as business owners, they are more likely to be hired as cheap labor, often involving them in exploitative situations. These examples highlight feminist economic theory&#x27;s critique of the traditional economic theory.

===Exclusion of non-market activity===

Feminist economics call attention to the importance of non-market activities, such as childcare and domestic work, to economic development. This stands in sharp contrast to neoclassical economics where those forms of labor are unaccounted for as &quot;non-economic&quot; phenomena. Including such labor in economic accounts removes substantial gender bias because women disproportionately perform those tasks. When that labor is unaccounted for in economic models, much work done by women is ignored, literally devaluing their effort.

More specifically, for example, Nancy Folbre examines the role of children as public goods and how the non-market labor of parents contributes to the development of human capital as a public service. In this sense, children are positive externality which is under-invested according to traditional analysis. Folbre indicates that this oversight partially results from failing to properly examine non-market activities.

Marilyn Waring described how the exclusion of non-market activities in the national accounting systems relied on the deliberate choice and the design of the international standard of national accounts that explicitly excluded non-market activities. In some countries, such as Norway, which had included unpaid household work in the GDP in the first half of the 20th century, it was left out in 1950 for reasons of compatibility with the new international standard.

Ailsa McKay argues for a basic income as &quot;a tool for promoting gender-neutral social citizenship rights&quot; partially to address these concerns.

===Omission of power relations===
Feminist economics often assert that power relations exist within the economy, and therefore, must be assessed in economic models in ways that they previously have been overlooked. For example, in &quot;neoclassical texts, the sale of labor is viewed as a mutually beneficial exchange that benefits both parties. No mention is made of the power inequities in the exchange which tend to give the employer power over the employee.&quot; These power relations often favor men and there is &quot;never any mention made of the particular difficulties that confront females in the workplace.&quot; Consequently, &quot;Understanding power and patriarchy helps us to analyze how men-dominated economic institutions function and why females are often at a disadvantage in the workplace.&quot; Feminist economists often extend these criticisms to many aspects of the social world, arguing that power relations are an endemic and important feature of society.

===Omission of gender and race===
Feminist economics argue that gender and race must be considered in economic analysis. Amartya Sen argues that &quot;the systematically inferior position of women inside and outside the household in many societies points to the necessity of treating gender as a force of its own in development analysis.&quot; He goes on to say that experiences of men and women, even within the same household, are often so different that examining economics without gender can be misleading.

Economic models can often be improved by explicitly considering gender, race, class, and caste. Julie Matthaie describes their importance: &quot;Not only did gender and racial-ethnic differences and inequality precede capitalism, they have been built into it in key ways. In other words, every aspect of our capitalist economy is gendered and racialized; a theory and practice that ignores this is inherently flawed.&quot; Feminist economist Eiman Zein-Elabdin says racial and gender differences should be examined since both have traditionally been ignored and thus are equally described as &quot;feminist difference.&quot; The July 2002 issue of the &quot;Feminist Economics&quot; journal was dedicated to issues of &quot;gender, color, caste and class.&quot;

===Exaggeration of gender differences===
In other cases gender differences have been exaggerated, potentially encouraging unjustified stereotyping. In recent works Julie A. Nelson has shown how the idea that &quot;women are more risk averse than men,&quot; a now-popular assertion from behavioral economics, actually rests on extremely thin empirical evidence. Conducting meta-analyses of recent studies, she demonstrates that, while statistically significant differences in measures of mean risk aversion are sometimes found, the substantive size of these group-level differences tend to be small (on the order of a fraction of a standard deviation), and many other studies fail to find a statistically significant difference at all. Yet the studies that fail to find &quot;difference&quot; are less likely to be published or highlighted.

In addition, claims that men and women have &quot;different&quot; preferences (such as for risk, competition, or altruism) often tend to be misinterpreted as categorical, that is, as applying to all women and all men, as individuals. In fact, small differences in average behavior, such as are found in some studies, are generally accompanied by large overlaps in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s distributions. That is, both men and women can generally be found in the most risk-averse (or competitive or altruistic) groups, as well as in the least.

===&quot;Homo economicus&quot;===

The neoclassical economic model of a person is called &quot;Homo economicus&quot;, describing a person who &quot;interacts in society without being influenced by society,&quot; because &quot;his mode of interaction is through an ideal market,&quot; in which prices are the only necessary considerations. In this view, people are considered rational actors who engage in marginal analysis to make many or all of their decisions. Feminist economists argue that people are more complex than such models, and call for &quot;a more holistic vision of an economic actor, which includes group interactions and actions motivated by factors other than greed.&quot; Feminist economics holds that such a reformation provides a better description of the actual experiences of both men and women in the market, arguing that mainstream economics overemphasizes the role of individualism, competition and selfishness of all actors. Instead, feminist economists like Nancy Folbre show that cooperation also plays a role in the economy.

Feminist economists also point out that agency is not available to everyone, such as children, the sick, and the frail elderly. Responsibilities for their care can compromise the agency of caregivers as well. This is a critical departure from the &quot;homo economicus&quot; model.

Moreover, feminist economists critique the focus of neoclassical economics on monetary rewards. Nancy Folbre notes, &quot;legal rules and cultural norms can affect market outcomes in ways distinctly disadvantageous to women.&quot; This includes occupational segregation resulting in unequal pay for women. Feminist research in these areas contradicts the neoclassical description of labor markets in which occupations are chosen freely by individuals acting alone and out of their own free will. Feminist economics also includes study of norms relevant to economics, challenging the traditional view that material incentives will reliably provide the goods we want and need (consumer sovereignty), which does not hold true for many people.

Institutional economics is one means by which feminist economists improve upon the &quot;homo economicus&quot; model. This theory examines the role of institutions and evolutionary social processes in shaping economic behavior, emphasizing &quot;the complexity of human motives and the importance of culture and relations of power.&quot; This provides a more holistic view of the economic actor than &quot;homo economicus.&quot;

The work of George Akerlof and Janet Yellen on efficiency wages based on notions of fairness provides an example of a feminist model of economic actors. In their work, agents are not hyperrational or isolated, but instead act in concert and with fairness, are capable of experiencing jealousy, and are interested in personal relationships. This work is based on empirical sociology and psychology, and suggests that wages can be influenced by fairness considerations rather than purely market forces.

===Limited methodology===
Economics is often thought of as &quot;the study of how society manages its scarce resources&quot; and as such is limited to mathematical inquiry. Traditional economists often say such an approach assures objectivity and separates economics from &quot;softer&quot; fields such as sociology and political science. Feminist economists, argue on the contrary that a mathematical conception of economics limited to scarce resources is a holdover from the early years of science and Cartesian philosophy, and limits economic analysis. So feminist economists often call for more diverse data collection and broader economic models.

===Economic pedagogy===
Feminist economists suggest that both the content and teaching style of economics courses would benefit from certain changes. Some recommend including experimental learning, laboratory sessions, individual research and more chances to &quot;do economics.&quot; Some want more dialogue between instructors and students. Many feminist economists are urgently interested in how course content influences the demographic composition of future economists, suggesting that the &quot;classroom climate&quot; affects some students&#x27; perceptions of their own ability.

===The 2000s financial crisis===

Margunn Bjørnholt and Ailsa McKay argue that the financial crisis of 2007–08 and the response to it revealed a crisis of ideas in mainstream economics and within the economics profession, and call for a reshaping of both the economy, economic theory and the economics profession. They argue that such a reshaping should include new advances within feminist economics that take as their starting point the socially responsible, sensible and accountable subject in creating an economy and economic theories that fully acknowledge care for each other as well as the planet.

==Major areas of inquiry==

===Economic epistemology===

Feminist critiques of economics include that &quot;economics, like any science, is socially constructed.&quot; Feminist economists say that social constructs act to privilege male-identified, western, and heterosexual interpretations of economics. They generally incorporate feminist theory and frameworks to show how traditional economics communities signal expectations regarding appropriate participants, to the exclusion of outsiders. Such criticisms extend to the theories, methodologies and research areas of economics, in order to show that accounts of economic life are deeply influenced by biased histories, social structures, norms, cultural practices, interpersonal interactions, and politics.

Feminist economists often make a critical distinction that masculine bias in economics is primarily a result of gender, not sex. In other words, when feminist economists highlight the biases of mainstream economics, they focus on its social beliefs about masculinity like objectivity, separation, logical consistency, individual accomplishment, mathematics, abstraction, and lack of emotion, but not on the gender of authorities and subjects. However, the over-representation of men among economists and their subjects of study is also a concern.

===Economic history===
Feminist economists say that mainstream economics has been disproportionately developed by European-descended, heterosexual, middle and upper-middle-class men, and that this has led to suppression of the life experiences of the full diversity of the world&#x27;s people, especially women, children and those in non-traditional families.

Additionally, feminist economists claim that the historical bases of economics are inherently exclusionary to women. Michèle Pujol points to five specific historical assumptions about women that arose, became embedded in the formulation of economics, and continue to be used to maintain that women are different from the masculinized norms and exclude them. These include the ideas that:

*All women are married, or if not yet, they will be and all women will have children.
*All women are economically dependent on a male relative.
*All women are (and should be) housewives due to their reproductive capacities.
*Women are unproductive in the industrial workforce.
*Women are irrational, unfit economic agents, and cannot be trusted to make the right economic decisions.

Feminist economists also examine early economic thinkers&#x27; interaction or lack of interaction with gender and women&#x27;s issues, showing examples of women&#x27;s historical engagement with economic thought. For example, Edith Kuiper discusses Adam Smith&#x27;s engagement with feminist discourse on the role of women in the eighteenth century France and England. She finds that through his writings, Smith typically supported the &quot;status quo&quot; on women&#x27;s issues and &quot;lost sight of the division of labor in the family and the contribution of women&#x27;s economic work.&quot; In response, she points to Mary Collier&#x27;s works such as &quot;The Woman&#x27;s Labour&quot; (1739) to help understand Smith&#x27;s contemporaneous experiences of women and fill in such gaps.

===Engendering macroeconomic theories===

Central to feminist economics is an effort to alter the theoretical modeling of the economy, to reduce gender bias and inequity. Feminist macroeconomic inquiries focus on international capital flows, fiscal austerity, deregulation and privatization, monetary policy, international trade and more. In general, these modifications take three main forms: gender disaggregation, the addition of gender-based macroeconomic variables, and the creation of a two-sector system.

====Gender disaggregation====

This method of economic analysis seeks to overcome gender bias by showing how men and women differ in their consumption, investment or saving behavior. Gender disaggregation strategies justify the separation of macroeconomic variables by gender. Korkut Ertürk and Nilüfer Çağatay show how the feminization of labor stimulates investment, while an increase in female activity in housework raises savings. This model highlights how gender effects macroeconomic variables and shows that economies have a higher likelihood of recovering from downturns if women participate in the labor force more, instead of devoting their time to housework.

====Gendered macroeconomic variables====

This approach demonstrates the effects of gender inequalities by enhancing macroeconomic models. Bernard Walters shows that traditional neoclassical models fail to adequately assess work related to reproduction by assuming that the population and labor are determined exogenously. That fails to account for the fact that inputs are produced through caring labor, which is disproportionately performed by women. Stephen Knowels &quot;et al.&quot; use a neoclassical growth model to show that women&#x27;s education has a positive statistically significant effect on labor productivity, more robust than that of men&#x27;s education. In both of these cases, economists highlight and address the gender biases of macroeconomic variables to show that gender plays a significant role in models&#x27; outcomes.

====Two-sector system====

The two-sector system approach models the economy as two separate systems: one involving the standard macroeconomic variables, while the other includes gender-specific variables. William Darity developed a two-sector approach for low-income, farm-based economies. Darity shows that subsistence farming depended on the labor of women, while the production of income depended on the labor of both men and women in cash-crop activities. This model shows that when men control production and income, they seek to maximize income by persuading women to put additional effort into cash-crop production, causing increases in cash crops come at the expense of subsistence production.

===Well-being===
Many feminist economists argue economics should be focused less on mechanisms (like income) or theories (such as utilitarianism) and more on well-being, a multidimensional concept including income, health, education, empowerment and social status. They argue that economic success can not be measured only by goods or gross domestic product, but must also be measured by human well-being. Aggregate income is not sufficient to evaluate general well-being, because individual entitlements and needs must also be considered, leading feminist economists to study health, longevity, access to property, education, and related factors.

Bina Agarwal and Pradeep Panda illustrate that a woman&#x27;s property status (such as owning a house or land) directly and significantly reduces her chances of experiencing domestic violence, while employment makes little difference. They argue that such immovable property increases women&#x27;s self-esteem, economic security, and strengthens their fall-back positions, enhancing their options and bargaining clout. They show that property ownership is an important contributor to women&#x27;s economic well-being because it reduces their susceptibility to violence.

In order to measure well-being more generally, Amartya Sen, Sakiko Fukuda-Parr, and other feminist economists helped develop alternatives to Gross Domestic Product, such as the Human Development Index. Other models of interest to feminist economists include the labor theory of value, which was most thoroughly developed in &quot;Das Kapital&quot; by Karl Marx. That model considers production as a socially constructed human project and redefines wages as means to earning a living. This refocuses economic models on human innate desires and needs as opposed to monetary incentives.

====Human capabilities approach====
Economists Amartya Sen and Philosopher Martha Nussbaum created the human capabilities approach as an alternative way to assess economic success rooted in the ideas of welfare economics and focused on the individual&#x27;s potential to do and be what he or she may choose to value. Unlike traditional economic measures of success, focused on GDP, utility, income, assets or other monetary measures, the capabilities approach focuses on what individuals are able to do. This approach emphasizes processes as well as outcomes, and draws attention to cultural, social and material dynamics of well-being. Martha Nussbaum, expanded on the model with a more complete list of central capabilities including life, health, bodily integrity, thought, and more. In recent years, the capabilities approach has influenced the creation of new models including the UN&#x27;s Human Development Index (HDI).

===Household bargaining===
Central to feminist economics is a different approach to the &quot;family&quot; and &quot;household.&quot; In classical economics, those units are typically described as amicable and homogeneous. Gary Becker and new home economists introduced the study of &quot;the family&quot; to traditional economics, which usually assumes the family is a single, altruistic unit among which money is distributed equally. Others have concluded that an optimal distribution of commodities and provisions takes place within the family as a result of which they view families in the same manner as individuals. These models, according to feminist economists, &quot;endorsed traditional expectations about the sexes,&quot; and applied individualistic rational-choice models to explain home behavior. Feminist economists modify these assumptions to account for exploitative sexual and gender relations, single-parent families, same-sex relationships, familial relations with children, and the consequences of reproduction. Specifically, feminist economists move beyond unitary household models and game theory to show the diversity of household experiences.

For example, Bina Agarwal and others have critiqued the mainstream model and helped provide a better understanding of intra-household bargaining power. Agarwal shows that a lack of power and outside options for women hinders their ability to negotiate within their families. Amartya Sen shows how social norms that devalue women&#x27;s unpaid work in the household often disadvantage women in intra-household bargaining. These feminist economists argue that such claims have important economic outcomes which must be recognized within economic frameworks.

===Care economy===
Feminist economists join the UN and others in acknowledging care work, as a kind of work which includes all tasks involving caregiving, as central to economic development and human well-being. Feminist economists study both paid and unpaid care work. They argue that traditional analysis of economics often ignores the value of household unpaid work. Feminist economists have argued that unpaid domestic work is as valuable as paid work, so measures of economic success should include unpaid work. They have shown that women are disproportionately responsible for performing such care work.

Sabine O&#x27;Hara argues that care is the basis for all economic activity and market economies, concluding that &quot;everything needs care,&quot; not only people, but animals and things. She highlights the sustaining nature of care services offered outside the formal economy.

Riane Eisler claims we need the economic system, to give visibility to the essential work of caring for people and caring for nature. Measuring GDP only includes productive work and leaves out the life sustaining activities of the following three sectors: the household economy, the natural economy and the volunteer community economy. These sectors are where most of the care work is done. By changing existing economic indicators in a way that they would also measure the contributions of the three aforementioned sectors we can get a more accurate reflection of economic reality. She proposes social wealth indicators. According to her these indicators would show the enormous return on investment (ROI) in caring for people and nature. Psychological studies have shown that when people feel good, and they feel good when they feel cared for, they are more productive and more creative (example case study). As a result, the care economy has positive externalities such as increasing the quality of human capital.

Most nations not only fail to support the care work that is still predominantly done by women, but we live in the world with gendered system of values. Everything that is associated with women or femininity is devalued or even marginalised. We need to leave behind the gender double standard that devaluates caring. Only then we can shift from domination to partnership and create a new economic model that Eisler proposes in her book The Real Wealth of Nations: Creating a Caring Economics. Contributions of people and of nature present the real wealth of the society and our economic policies and practices must support caring for both she claims.

Feminist economists have also highlighted power and inequality issues within families and households. For example, Randy Albelda shows that responsibility for care work influences the time poverty experienced by single mothers in the United States. Similarly, Sarah Gammage examines the effects of unpaid care work performed by women in Guatemala. The work of the Equality Studies Department at University College Dublin such as that of Sara Cantillon has focused on inequalities of domestic arrangements within even affluent households.

While much care work is performed in the home, it may also be done for pay. As such, feminist economics examine its implications, including the increasing involvement of women in paid care work, the potential for exploitation, and effects on the lives of care workers.

Systemic study of the ways women&#x27;s work is measured, or not measured at all, have been undertaken by Marilyn Waring (see &quot;If Women Counted&quot;) and others in the 1980s and 1990s. These studies began to justify different means of determining value — some of which influenced the theory of social capital and individual capital, that emerged in the late 1990s and, along with ecological economics, influenced modern human development theory. (See also the entry on Gender and Social Capital.)

===Unpaid work===

Unpaid work can include domestic work, care work, subsistence work, unpaid market labor and voluntary work. There is no clear consensus on the definition of these categories. But broadly speaking, these kinds of work can be seen as contributing to the reproduction of society.
Domestic work is maintenance of the home, and is usually universally recognizable, e.g. doing the laundry. Care work is looking &quot;after a relative or friend who needs support because of age, physical or learning disability, or illness, including mental illness;&quot; this also includes raising children. Care work also involves &quot;close personal or emotional interaction.&quot; Also included in this category is &quot;self-care,&quot; in which leisure time and activities are included. Subsistence work is work done in order to meet basic needs, such as collecting water, but does not have market values assigned to it. Although some of these efforts &quot;are categorized as productive activities according to the latest revision of the international System of National Accounts (SNA) ... [they] are poorly measured by most surveys.&quot; Unpaid market work is &quot;the direct contributions of unpaid family members to market work that officially belongs to another member of the household.&quot; Voluntary work is usually work done for non-household members, but in return for little to no remuneration.

====System of National Accounts====
Each country measures its economic output according to the System of National Accounts (SNA), sponsored mainly by the United Nations (UN), but implemented mainly by other organizations such as the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the World Bank. The SNA recognizes that unpaid work is an area of interest, but &quot;unpaid household services are excluded from [its] production boundary.&quot; Feminist economists have criticized the SNA for this exclusion, because by leaving out unpaid work, basic and necessary labor is ignored.
Even accounting measures intended to recognize gender disparities are criticized for ignoring unpaid work. Two such examples are the Gender-related Development Index (GDI) and the Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM), neither of which include much unpaid work. So feminist economics calls for a more comprehensive index which includes participation in unpaid work.
In more recent years there has been increasing attention to this issue, such as recognition of unpaid work within SNA reports and a commitment by the UN to the measurement and valuation of unpaid work, emphasizing care work done by women. This goal was restated at the 1995 UN Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing.

====Measurement of unpaid work====
The method most widely used to measure unpaid work is gathering information on time use, which has &quot;been implemented by at least 20 developing countries and more are underway&quot; as of 2006. Time use measurement involves collecting data on how much time men and women spend on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis on certain activities that fall under the categories of unpaid work.

Techniques to gather this data include surveys, in-depth interviews, diaries, and participant observation. Proponents of time use diaries believe that this method &quot;generate[s] more detailed information and tend[s] to capture greater variation than predetermined questions.&quot; However, others argue that participant observation, &quot;where the researcher spends lengthy periods of time in households helping out and observing the labor process,&quot; generates more accurate information because the researcher can ascertain whether or not those studied are accurately reporting what activities they perform.

=====Accuracy=====
The first problem of measuring unpaid work is the issue of collecting accurate information. This is always a concern in research studies, but is particularly difficult when evaluating unpaid work. &quot;Time-use surveys may reveal relatively little time devoted to unpaid direct care activities [because] the demands of subsistence production in those countries are great,&quot; and may not take into account multitasking — for example, a mother may collect wood fuel while a child is in the same location, so the child is in her care while she is performing other work. Usually such indirect care should be included, as it is in many time use studies. But it is not always, and as a result some studies may undervalue the amount of certain types of unpaid work. Participant observation has been criticized for being &quot;so time-consuming that it can only focus on small numbers of households,&quot; and thus limited in the amount of information it can be used to gather.

All data gathering involves difficulties with the potential inaccuracy of research subjects&#x27; reports. For instance, when &quot;people doing domestic labor have no reason to pay close attention to the amount of time tasks take ... they [may] often underestimate time spent in familiar activities.&quot; Measuring time can also be problematic because &quot;the slowest and most inefficient workers [appear to carry] the greatest workload.&quot; Time use in assessing childcare is criticized as &quot;easily obscur[ing] gender differences in workload. Men and women may both put in the same amount of time being responsible for children but as participant observation studies have shown, many men are more likely to &#x27;babysit&#x27; their children while doing something for themselves, such as watching TV. Men&#x27;s standards of care may be limited to ensuring the children are not hurt. Dirty diapers may be ignored or deliberately left until the mother returns.&quot; A paradoxical aspect of this problem is that those most burdened may not be able to participate in the studies: &quot;It is usually those women with the heaviest work loads who choose not to participate in these studies.&quot; In general, measurement of time causes &quot;some of the most demanding aspects of unpaid work [to be unexplored] and the premise that time is an appropriate tool for measuring women&#x27;s unpaid work goes unchallenged.&quot; Surveys have also been criticized for lacking &quot;depth and complexity&quot; as questions cannot be specifically tailored to particular circumstances.

=====Comparability=====
A second problem is the difficulty of comparisons across cultures. &quot;Comparisons across countries are currently hampered by differences in activity classification and nomenclature.&quot; In-depth surveys may be the only way to get necessary information desired, but they make it difficult to perform cross-cultural comparisons. The lack of adequate universal terminology in discussing unpaid work is an example. &quot;Despite increasing recognition that domestic labor is work, existing vocabularies do not easily convey the new appreciations. People still tend to talk about work and home as if they were separate spheres. &#x27;Working mothers&#x27; are usually assumed to be in the paid labor force, despite feminist assertions that &#x27;every mother is a working mother.&#x27; There are no readily accepted terms to express different work activities or job titles. Housewife, home manager, homemaker are all problematic and none of them conveys the sense of a woman who juggles both domestic labor and paid employment.&quot;

=====Complexity=====
A third problem is the complexity of domestic labor and the issues of separating unpaid work categories. Time use studies now take multitasking issues into account, separating primary and secondary activities. However, not all studies do this, and even those that do may not take into account &quot;the fact that frequently several tasks are done simultaneously, that tasks overlap, and that the boundaries between work and relationships are often unclear. How does a woman determine her primary activity when she is preparing dinner while putting the laundry away, making coffee for her spouse, having coffee and chatting with him, and attending to the children?&quot; Some activities may not even be considered work, such as playing with a child (this has been categorized as developmental care work) and so may not be included in a study&#x27;s responses. As mentioned above, child supervision (indirect care work) may not be construed as an activity at all, which 
&quot;suggests that activity-based surveys should be supplemented by more stylized questions regarding care responsibilities&quot; as otherwise such activities can be undercounted. In the past, time use studies tended to measure only primary activities, and &quot;respondents doing two or more things at once were asked to indicate which was the more important.&quot; This has been changing in more recent years.

====Valuation of time====
Feminist economists point out three main ways of determining the value of unpaid work: the opportunity cost method, replacement cost method, and input-output cost method. The opportunity cost method &quot;uses the wage a person would earn in the market&quot; to see how much value their labor-time has. This method extrapolates from the opportunity cost idea in mainstream economics.

The second method of valuation uses replacement costs. In simple terms, this is done by measuring the amount of money a third-party would make for doing the same work if it was part of the market. In other words, the value of a person cleaning the house in an hour is the same as the hourly wage for a maid. Within this method there are two approaches: the first is a generalist replacement cost method, which examines if &quot;it would be possible, for example, to take the wage of a general domestic worker who could perform a variety of tasks including childcare&quot;. The second approach is the specialist replacement cost method, which aims to &quot;distinguish between the different household tasks and choose replacements accordingly&quot;.

The third method is the input-output cost method. This looks at both the costs of inputs and includes any value added by the household. &quot;For instance, the value of time devoted to cooking a meal can be determined by asking what it could cost to purchase a similar meal (the output) in the market, then subtracting the cost of the capital goods, utilities and raw materials devoted to that meal. This remainder represents the value of the other factors of production, primarily labor.&quot; These types of models try to value household output by determining monetary values for the inputs — in the dinner example, the ingredients and production of the meal — and compares those with market equivalents.

=====Difficulty establishing monetary levels=====
One criticism of time valuation concerns the choice of monetary levels. How should unpaid work be valued when more than one activity is being performed or more than one output is produced? Another issue concerns differences in quality between market and household products. Some feminist economists take issue with using the market system to determine values for a variety of reasons: it may lead to the conclusion that the market provides perfect substitutes for non-market work; the wage produced in the market for services may not accurately reflect the actual opportunity cost of time spent in household production; and the wages used in valuation methods come from industries where wages are already depressed because of gender inequalities, and so will not accurately value unpaid work. A related argument is that the market &quot;accepts existing sex/gender divisions of labor and pay inequalities as normal and unproblematic. With this basic assumption underlying their calculations, the valuations produced serve to reinforce gender inequalities rather than challenge women&#x27;s subordination.&quot;

=====Criticisms of opportunity cost=====
Criticisms are leveled against each method of valuation. The opportunity cost method &quot;depends on the lost earnings of the worker so that a toilet cleaned by a lawyer has much greater value than one cleaned by a janitor&quot;, which means that the value varies too drastically. There are also issues with the uniformity of this method not just across multiple individuals, but also for a single person: it &quot;may not be uniform across the entire day or across days of the week.&quot; There is also the issue of whether any enjoyment of the activity should be deducted from the opportunity cost estimate.

=====Difficulties with replacement cost=====
The replacement cost method also has its critics. What types of jobs should be used as substitutes? For example, should childcare activities &quot;be calculated using the wages of daycare workers or child psychiatrists?&quot; This relates to the problem of depressed wages in female-dominated industries, and whether using such jobs as an equivalent leads to the undervaluing of unpaid work. Some have argued that education levels ought to be comparable, for example, &quot;the value of time that a college-educated parent spends reading aloud to a child should be ascertained by asking how much it would cost to hire a college-educated worker to do the same, not by an average housekeeper&#x27;s wage.&quot;

=====Difficulties with input-output methods=====
Critiques against the input-output methods include the difficulty of identifying and measuring household outputs, and the issues of variation of households and these effects.

====Findings and economic effects of unpaid work====
In 2011, a wide-ranging study was conducted to determine the amount of unpaid household work engaged in by residents of different countries. This study, incorporating the results of time-use surveys from 26 OECD countries, found that, in each country, the average hours spent per day on unpaid household work was between about 2 to 4 hours per day. As domestic work is widely seen as &quot;women&#x27;s work&quot;, the majority of it is performed by women, even for women who also participate in the labor force. One study found that, when adding the time spent on unpaid household work to the time spent engaging in paid work, married mothers accumulate 84 hours of work per week, compared to 79 hours per week for unmarried mothers, and 72 hours per week for all fathers, whether married or not.

Efforts to calculate the true economic value of unpaid work, which is not included in measures such as gross domestic product, have shown that this value is enormous. In the United States, it has been estimated to be between 20 and 50%, meaning that the true value of unpaid work is trillions of dollars per year. For other countries, the percentage of GDP may be even higher, such as the United Kingdom, where is may be as high as 70%. Because this unpaid work is largely done by women and is unreported in economic indicators, it results in these contributions by women being devalued in a society.

===The formal economy===
Research into the causes and consequences of occupational segregation, the gender pay gap, and the &quot;glass ceiling&quot; have been a significant part of feminist economics. While conventional neoclassical economic theories of the 1960s and 1970s explained these as the result of free choices made by women and men who simply had different abilities or preferences, feminist economists pointed out the important roles played by stereotyping, sexism, patriarchal beliefs and institutions, sexual harassment, and discrimination. The rationales for, and the effects of, anti-discrimination laws adopted in many industrial countries beginning in the 1970s, has also been studied.

Women moved in large numbers into previous male bastions — especially professions like medicine and law — during the last decades of the 20th century. The gender pay gap remains and is shrinking more slowly. Feminist economists such as Marilyn Power, Ellen Mutari and Deborah M. Figart have examined the gender pay gap and found that wage setting procedures are not primarily driven by market forces, but instead by the power of actors, cultural understandings of the value of work and what constitutes a proper living, and social gender norms. Consequently, they assert that economic models must take these typically exogenous variables into account.

While overt employment discrimination by sex remains a concern of feminist economists, in recent years more attention has been paid to discrimination against caregivers—those women, and some men, who give hands-on care to children or sick or elderly friends or relatives. Because many business and government policies were designed to accommodate the &quot;ideal worker&quot; (that is, the traditional male worker who had no such responsibilities) rather than caregiver-workers, inefficient and inequitable treatment has resulted.

===Globalization===

Feminist economists&#x27; work on globalization is diverse and multifaceted. But much of it is tied together through detailed and nuanced studies of the ways in which globalization affects women in particular and how these effects relate to socially just outcomes. Often country case studies are used for these data. Some feminist economists focus on policies involving the development of globalization. For example, Lourdes Benería argues that economic development in the Global South depends in large part on improved reproductive rights, gender equitable laws on ownership and inheritance, and policies that are sensitive to the proportion of women in the informal economy. Additionally, Nalia Kabeer discusses the impacts of a social clause that would enforce global labor standards through international trade agreements, drawing on fieldwork from Bangladesh. She argues that although these jobs may appear exploitative, for many workers in those areas they present opportunities and ways to avoid more exploitative situations in the informal economy.

Alternatively, Suzanne Bergeron, for example, raises examples of studies that illustrate the multifaceted effects of globalization on women, including Kumudhini Rosa&#x27;s study of Sri Lankan, Malaysian, and Philippine, workers in free trade zones as an example of local resistance to globalization. Women there use their wages to create women&#x27;s centers aimed at providing legal and medical services, libraries and cooperative housing, to local community members. Such efforts, Bergeron highlights, allow women the chance to take control of economic conditions, increase their sense of individualism, and alter the pace and direction of globalization itself.

In other cases, feminist economists work on removing gender biases from the theoretical bases of globalization itself. Suzanne Bergeron, for example, focuses on the typical theories of globalization as the &quot;rapid integration of the world into one economic space&quot; through the flow of goods, capital, and money, in order to show how they exclude some women and the disadvantaged. She argues that traditional understandings of globalization over-emphasize the power of global capital flows, the uniformity of globalization experiences across all populations, and technical and abstract economic processes, and therefore depict the political economy of globalization inappropriately. She highlights the alternative views of globalization created by feminists. First, she describes how feminists may de-emphasize the idea of the market as &quot;a natural and unstoppable force,&quot; instead depicting the process of globalization as alterable and movable by individual economic actors including women. She also explains that the concept of globalization itself is gender biased, because its depiction as &quot;dominant, unified, [and] intentional&quot; is inherently masculinized and misleading. She suggests that feminists critique such narratives by showing how a &quot;global economy&quot; is highly complex, de-centered and unclear.

===Degrowth and Ecological economics===

Feminist and ecological economics so far have not engaged with one another much. argue for the degrowth approach as a useful critique of the devaluation of care and nature by the &quot;growth-based capitalist economic paradigm&quot;. They argue that the growth paradigm perpetuates existing gender and environmental injustices and seek to mitigate it with a degrowth work-sharing proposal.

Scholars in the paradigm of degrowth point out that the contemporary economic imaginary considers time as a scarce resource to be allocated efficiently, while in the domestic and care sector time use depends on the rhythm of life. (D’Alisa et al. 2014: Degrowth. A Vocabulary for a New Era, New York, NY: Routledge.)
Joan Tronto (1993: Moral Boundaries: A Political Argument for an Ethic of Care, New York, NY: Routledge.) divides the care process in four phases: caring about, taking care of, care-giving and care-receiving. These acquire different meanings when used describing the actions of males and females.

Degrowth proposes to put care at the center of society, thus calling for a radical rethinking of human relations. It should be pointed out that degrowth is a concept that originated in the global north and is mainly directed towards a reduction of the economic (and therefore material) throughput of affluent societies.
Environmental injustices linked to gender injustices are embedded in &quot;Green Growth&quot; due to its inability to dematerialize production processes, and these injustices are perpetuated through the Green Growth narrative and through its consequences. Ecological processes as well as caring activities are similarly, systematically devalued by the dominating industrial and economic paradigms. This can be explained by the arbitrary boundary between the monetized and the maintaining that remains largely unchallenged. 
Degrowth presents itself as an alternative to this dualistic view. If designed in a gender-sensitive way that recenters society around care could have the potential to alleviate environmental injustices while promoting greater gender equality.

==Methodology==

===Interdisciplinary data collection===
Many feminist economists challenge the perception that only &quot;objective&quot; (often presumed to be quantitative) data are valid. Instead, they say economists should enrich their analysis by using data sets generated from other disciplines or through increased use of qualitative methods. Additionally, many feminist economists propose utilizing non-traditional data collection strategies such as &quot;utilizing growth accounting frameworks, conducting empirical tests of economic theories, developing country case studies, and pursuing research at the conceptual and empirical levels.&quot;

Interdisciplinary data collection looks at systems from a specific moral position and viewpoint instead of attempting the perspective of a neutral observer. The intention is not to create a more &quot;subjective&quot; methodology, but to counter biases in existing methodologies, by recognizing that all explanations for world phenomena arise from socially-influenced viewpoints. Feminist economists say too many theories claim to present universal principles but actually present a masculine viewpoint in the guise of a &quot;view from nowhere&quot;, so more varied sources of data collection are needed to mediate those issues.

===Ethical judgment===
Feminist economists depart from traditional economics in that they say &quot;ethical judgments are a valid, inescapable, and in fact desirable part of economic analysis.&quot; For example, Lourdes Beneria argues that judgments about policies leading to greater well-being should be central to economic analysis. Similarly, Shahra Razavi says better understanding of care work &quot;would allow us to shift our priorities from &#x27;making money&#x27; or &#x27;making stuff&#x27; to &#x27;making livable lives&#x27; and &#x27;enriching networks of care and relationship&#x27;&quot; which should be central to economics.

===Country case studies===
Often feminist economists use country-level or smaller case studies focused on developing and often understudied countries or populations. For example, Michael Kevane and Leslie C. Gray examine how gendered social norms are central to understanding agricultural activities in Burkina Faso. Cristina Carrasco and Arantxa Rodriquez examine the care economy in Spain to suggest that women&#x27;s entrance into the labor market requires more equitable caregiving responsibilities. Such studies show the importance of local social norms, government policies and cultural situations. Feminist economists see such variation as a crucial factor to be included in economics.

===Alternative measures of success===
Feminist economists call for a shift in how economic success is measured. These changes include an increased focus on a policy&#x27;s ability to bring society toward social justice and improve people&#x27;s lives, through specific goals including distributive fairness, equity, the universal provisioning of needs, elimination of poverty, freedom from discrimination and the protection of human capabilities.

==== Human Development Index (HDI) ====

Feminist economists often support use of the Human Development Index as a composite statistic in order to assess countries by their overall level of human development, as opposed to other measures. The HDI takes into account a broad array of measures beyond monetary considerations including life expectancy, literacy, education, and standards of living for all countries worldwide.

====Gender-related Development Index (GDI)====
The Gender-related Development Index (GDI) was introduced in 1995 in the Human Development Report written by the United Nations Development Program in order to add a gender-sensitive dimension to the Human Development Index. The GDI takes into account not only the average or general level of well-being and wealth within a given country, but also how this wealth and well-being is distributed between different groups within society, especially between genders. However, feminist economists do not universally agree on the use of the GDI and some offer improvements to it.

====Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI)====

The Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI) is a recently developed measure of gender inequality calculated by analyzing social institutions, societal practices, and legal norms and how these factors largely frame gender norms within a society. By combining these sources of inequality, SIGI is able to penalize high levels of inequality in each of the applicable dimensions, allowing for only partial compensation by the gaps between the remaining dimensions and the highly inequitable one. Through its analysis of the institutional sources of gender inequality in over 100 countries, SIGI has been proven to add new insights into outcomes for women, even when other factors such as religion and region of the world are controlled for.
SIGI rankings largely mirror those of the HDI, with countries such as Portugal and Argentina leading the pack, while countries like Afghanistan and Sudan are significantly behind.

==Organizations==
Feminist economics continues to become more widely recognized and reputed as evidenced by the numerous organizations dedicated to it or widely influenced by its principles.

===International Association for Feminist Economics===

Formed in 1992, the International Association for Feminist Economics (IAFFE), is independent of the American Economic Association (AEA) and seeks to challenge the masculine biases in neoclassical economics. While the majority of members are economists, it is open &quot;not only to female and male economists but to academics from other fields, as well as activists who are not academics&quot; and currently has over 600 members in 64 countries. Although its founding members were mostly based in the US, a majority of IAFFE&#x27;s current members are based outside of the US. In 1997, IAFFE gained Non-Governmental Organization status in the United Nations.

===&quot;Feminist Economics&quot; journal===
&quot;Feminist Economics&quot;, edited by Diana Strassmann of Rice University and Günseli Berik of the University of Utah, is a peer-reviewed journal established to provide an open forum for dialogue and debate about feminist economic perspectives. The journal endorses a normative agenda to promote policies that will better the lives of the world&#x27;s people, both women and men. In 1997, the journal was awarded the Council of Editors and Learned Journals (CELJ) Award as Best New Journal. The 2007 ISI Social Science Citation Index ranked the journal &quot;Feminist Economics&quot; 20th out of 175 among economics journals and 2nd out of 27 among Women&#x27;s Studies journals.

== Graduate programs ==
A small, but growing number of graduate programs around the world offer courses and concentrations in feminist economics. (Unless otherwise noted below, these offerings are in departments of economics.)

<text>The International Astronomical Union (IAU) designates 88 constellations of stars. In the table below, they are ranked by the solid angle that they subtend in the sky, measured in square degrees and millisteradians.

These solid angles depend on arbitrary boundaries between the constellations: the list below is based on constellation boundaries drawn up by Eugène Delporte in 1930 on behalf of the IAU and published in &quot;Délimitation scientifique des constellations&quot; (Cambridge University Press). Before Delporte&#x27;s work, there was no standard list of the boundaries of each constellation.

Delporte drew the boundaries along vertical and horizontal lines of right ascension and declination; however, he did so for the epoch B1875.0, which means that due to precession of the equinoxes, the borders on a modern star map (e.g., for epoch J2000) are already somewhat skewed and no longer perfectly vertical or horizontal. This skew will increase over the centuries to come. However, this does not change the solid angle of any constellation.

<text>Helen Hayes MacArthur (; October 10, 1900 – March 17, 1993) was an American actress. Often referred to as the &quot;First Lady of American Theatre&quot;, she was the second person and first woman to win the EGOT (an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar, and a Tony Award), and the first person to win the Triple Crown of Acting. Hayes also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, America&#x27;s highest civilian honor, from President Ronald Reagan in 1986. In 1988, she was awarded the National Medal of Arts. 

The annual Helen Hayes Awards, which have recognized excellence in professional theatre in greater Washington, D.C., since 1984, are her namesake. In 1955, the former Fulton Theatre on 46th Street in New York City&#x27;s Theatre District was renamed the Helen Hayes Theatre. When that venue was demolished in 1982, the nearby Little Theatre was renamed in her honor. Helen Hayes is regarded as one of the greatest leading ladies of the 20th-century theatre. Her career spanned 82 years.

A leading philanthropist in later decades, Hayes was most proud of her 49-year association with the Helen Hayes Hospital, a non-profit rehabilitative center overlooking the Hudson River in West Haverstraw, NY.

== Early life ==
Helen Hayes Brown was born in Washington, D.C., on October 10, 1900. Her mother, Catherine Estelle &quot;Essie&quot; (née Hayes), was an aspiring actress who worked in touring companies. Her father, Francis van Arnum Brown, worked at a number of jobs, including as a clerk at the Washington Patent Office and as a manager and salesman for a wholesale butcher. Hayes&#x27;s Catholic maternal grandparents emigrated from Ireland during the Great Famine. Hayes attended Dominican Academy&#x27;s prestigious primary school, on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side, from 1910 to 1912, appearing there in &quot;The Old Dutch&quot;, &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot;, and other performances. She attended the Academy of the Sacred Heart Convent in Washington and graduated in 1917.

== Career ==
Hayes began a stage career as a five-year-old singer at Washington&#x27;s Belasco Theatre, on Lafayette Square, across from the White House. By age 10, she had made a short silent film, &quot;Jean and the Calico Doll&quot; (1910).

Her sound film debut was &quot;The Sin of Madelon Claudet&quot;, for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress. She followed that with starring roles in &quot;Arrowsmith&quot; (with Ronald Colman); &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; (with Gary Cooper); &quot;The White Sister&quot; (opposite Clark Gable); &quot;Another Language&quot; (opposite Robert Montgomery); &quot;What Every Woman Knows&quot; (a reprise of her Broadway hit); and &quot;&quot; also with Robert Montgomery. But Hayes did not prefer film to the stage.

Hayes eventually returned to Broadway in 1935, where for three years she played the title role in Gilbert Miller&#x27;s production of &quot;Victoria Regina&quot;, with Vincent Price as Prince Albert, first at the Broadhurst Theatre and later at the Martin Beck Theatre.
In 1951, she was involved in the Broadway revival of J.M. Barrie&#x27;s play &quot;Mary Rose&quot; at the ANTA Playhouse. In 1953, she was the first-ever recipient of the Sarah Siddons Award for her work in Chicago theatre, repeating as the winner in 1969. She returned to Hollywood in the 1950s, and her film star began to rise. She starred in &quot;My Son John&quot; (1952) and &quot;Anastasia&quot; (1956), and won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role as an elderly stowaway in the disaster film &quot;Airport&quot; (1970). She followed that up with several roles in Disney films such as &quot;Herbie Rides Again&quot;, &quot;One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing&quot; and &quot;Candleshoe&quot;. Her performance in &quot;Anastasia&quot; was considered a comeback—she had suspended her career for several years due to her daughter Mary&#x27;s death and her husband&#x27;s failing health.

In 1955, the Fulton Theatre was renamed for her. In the 1980s, business interests wished to raze that theatre and four others to construct a large hotel that included the Marquis Theatre. Hayes&#x27;s consent to raze the theatre named for her was sought and given, though she had no ownership interest in the building. Parts of the original Helen Hayes Theatre on Broadway were used to construct the Shakespeare Center on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, which Hayes dedicated with Joseph Papp in 1982. In 1983 the Little Theater on West 44th Street was renamed the Helen Hayes Theatre in her honor, as was a theatre in Nyack, which has since been renamed the Riverspace-Arts Center. In early 2014, the site was refurbished and styled by interior designer Dawn Hershko and reopened as the Playhouse Market, a quaint restaurant and gourmet deli.

Hayes, who spoke with her good friend Anita Loos almost daily on the phone, told her, &quot;I used to think New York was the most enthralling place in the world. I&#x27;ll bet it still is and if I were free next summer, I would prove it.&quot; With that, she convinced Loos to embark on an exploration of all five boroughs of New York. They visited and explored the city; Bellevue Hospital at night, a tugboat hauling garbage out to sea, parties, libraries, and Puerto Rican markets. They spoke to everyday people to see how they lived their lives and what made the city tick. The result of this collaborative effort was the book &quot;Twice Over Lightly&quot;, published in 1972.

It is unclear when or by whom Hayes was called the &quot;First Lady of the Theatre&quot;. Her friend, actress Katharine Cornell, also held that title, and each thought the other deserved it. One critic said Cornell played every queen as though she were a woman, whereas Hayes played every woman as though she were a queen.

Hayes was also recognized with additional awards during her career. In January 1968, Philadelphia Art Alliance president Raymond S. Green presented her with the alliance&#x27;s Award of Merit &quot;in recognition of outstanding creative work of high artistic merit.&quot; She had been chosen unanimously by the alliance&#x27;s drama committee and board of directors, according to alliance executive director James Kirk Merrick who noted, &quot;This award isn&#x27;t given every year... It is only presented when we feel someone is deserving. I don&#x27;t think there can be any question as to how we arrived at choosing Miss Hayes.&quot;

In 1982, with friend Lady Bird Johnson, she founded the National Wildflower Research Center, now the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center, in Austin, Texas. The center protects and preserves North America&#x27;s native plants and natural landscapes.

The Helen Hayes Award for theater in the Washington, D.C., area is named in her honor. She has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6220 Hollywood Blvd. Hayes is also in the American Theatre Hall of Fame.

== Personal life ==
Hayes was a Catholic and a Republican who attended many Republican National Conventions (including the one held in New Orleans in 1988), but she was not as politically vocal as several other Republicans (e.g., Adolphe Menjou, Ginger Rogers, John Wayne, Ronald Reagan, etc.) in the Hollywood community of that time.

Hayes delivered a seconding speech to George H. W. Bush&#x27;s nomination during the roll call at the 1988 Republican National Convention.

Hayes wrote three memoirs: &quot;A Gift of Joy&quot;, &quot;On Reflection&quot;, and &quot;My Life in Three Acts&quot;. Some of these books&#x27; themes include her return to Roman Catholicism (she had been denied communion from the Church for the duration of her marriage to Charles MacArthur, who was a divorced Protestant); and the polio-related death of her 19-year-old daughter, Mary (1930–1949), an aspiring actress. Hayes&#x27;s adopted son, James MacArthur (1937–2010), had a successful career in acting, including as co-star to Jack Lord in &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;. Hayes guest-starred on &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; in the 1975 episode &quot;Retire in Sunny Hawaii... Forever&quot;. She and her son appeared in &quot;The Love Boat&quot; episode &quot;No Girls for Doc/Marriage of Convenience/The Caller/The Witness&quot;.

Hayes was hospitalized a number of times for asthma, which was aggravated by stage dust, forcing her to retire from theater in 1971, at age 71.

Her last Broadway show was a 1970 revival of &quot;Harvey&quot;, in which she co-starred with James Stewart. Clive Barnes wrote, &quot;She epitomizes flustered charm almost as if it were a style of acting ... She is one of those actors ... where to watch how she is doing something is almost as pleasurable as what she is doing.&quot; She spent most of her last years writing and raising money for organizations that fight asthma.

== Philanthropy ==

Hayes was a generous donor of time and money to a number of causes and organizations, including the Riverside Shakespeare Company of New York City. Along with Mildred Natwick, she became a founding member of the company&#x27;s Board of Advisors in 1981. She was also on the board of directors for the Greater New York Council of the Girl Scouts of the USA during the early 1970s.

In 1982, Hayes dedicated Riverside&#x27;s The Shakespeare Center with New York theatre producer, Joseph Papp, and in 1985 she returned to the New York stage in a benefit for the company with a reading of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; with Raul Julia, Len Cariou, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Carole Shelley, Celeste Holm and Harold Scott, directed by W. Stuart McDowell. The next year Hayes performed a second benefit for the Riverside Shakespeare Company, this time at the Marquis Theatre, the construction of which had been made possible by the demolition of the Helen Hayes Theatre three years before. The production featured Rex Smith, Ossie Davis and F. Murray Abraham, and was produced by McDowell and directed by Robert Small, with Hayes narrating.

== Helen Hayes Hospital ==
According to her daughter-in-law, HB MacArthur, Hayes took the most pride in her philanthropic work with Helen Hayes Hospital, a physical rehabilitation hospital located in West Haverstraw, New York. She was extremely proud of the strides the hospital made toward the rehabilitation of people with disabilities, saying: &quot;I&#x27;ve seen my name in lights on theater marquees and in letters 20 feet tall on Broadway billboards, but nothing has ever given me greater sense of pride and satisfaction than my 49-year association with this unique hospital.&quot;
Hayes became involved with the hospital in the 1940s and was named to the Board of Visitors in 1944. In 1974, the hospital was renamed in her honor. She served on the Helen Hayes Hospital Board of Visitors for 49 years, until her death in 1993. In that time, she advocated tirelessly for the hospital and successfully led a fight to prevent its relocation to Albany in the 1960s. In the 1970s, she was instrumental in lobbying for funding to transform the hospital into a state-of-the-art facility.

Hayes also contributed her enthusiastic support to hospital events and fund-raising efforts, including handing out diplomas to the children upon graduation when the hospital was still a pediatric care facility. She also faithfully attended the hospital&#x27;s annual Classic Race, leading it in a classic car, handing out awards to runners, hand cyclists, and wheelchair racers, and offering the use of her home, Pretty Penny, for a dinner to launch the hospital&#x27;s endowment fund.

== Death ==
Hayes died on March 17, 1993, of congestive heart failure in Nyack, New York. Hayes&#x27;s friend Lillian Gish, the &quot;First Lady of American Cinema&quot;, was the designated beneficiary of her estate, but Gish had died only 18 days earlier. Hayes was interred in Oak Hill Cemetery in Nyack and was survived by her son, James Gordon MacArthur, and four grandchildren: Charles P. MacArthur, Mary McClure, Juliette Rappaport, and James D. MacArthur died 2nd March 2021 [53] . In 2011, she was honored with a US postage stamp.

Hayes was in the inaugural class of inductees to the American Theater Hall of Fame in 1972.

In 1972, she received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. The following year, in 1973, Hayes was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame. In 1979, the Supersisters trading card set was produced and distributed; one of the cards featured Hayes&#x27;s name and picture. In 1983, Hayes received the Award for Greatest Public Service Benefiting the Disadvantaged, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards. In 1979, she received the Laetare Medal from the University of Notre Dame.

<text>Bosnian (; / ; ), sometimes referred to as Bosniak ( / ; ), is the standardized variety of the Serbo-Croatian pluricentric language mainly used by ethnic Bosniaks. Bosnian is one of the three official languages of Bosnia and Herzegovina, alongside Croatian and Serbian, all of which are mutually intelligible. It is also an officially recognized minority language in Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Kosovo.

Bosnian uses both the Latin and Cyrillic alphabets, with Latin in everyday use. It is notable among the varieties of Serbo-Croatian for a number of Arabic, Persian and Ottoman Turkish loanwords, largely due to the language&#x27;s interaction with those cultures through Islamic ties.

Bosnian is based on the most widespread dialect of Serbo-Croatian, Shtokavian, more specifically on Eastern Herzegovinian, which is also the basis of standard Croatian, Serbian and Montenegrin varieties. Therefore, the Declaration on the Common Language of Croats, Serbs, Bosniaks and Montenegrins was issued in 2017 in Sarajevo. Although the common name for the common language remains &#x27;Serbo-Croatian&#x27;, newer alternatives such as &#x27;Bosnian-Croatian-Serbian&#x27; and &#x27;Bosnian-Croatian-Montenegrin-Serbian&#x27; have been increasingly utilised since the 1990s, especially within diplomatic circles.

==History==
===Standardization===


Although Bosnians are, at the level of vernacular idiom, linguistically more homogeneous than either Serbians or Croatians, unlike those nations they failed to codify a standard language in the 19th century, with at least two factors being decisive:

*The Bosnian elite, as closely intertwined with Ottoman life, wrote predominantly in foreign (Arabic, Persian, Ottoman Turkish) languages. Vernacular literature written in Bosnian with the Arebica script was relatively thin and sparse.
*The Bosnians&#x27; national emancipation lagged behind that of the Serbs and Croats and because denominational rather than cultural or linguistic issues played the pivotal role, a Bosnian language project did not arouse much interest or support amongst the intelligentsia of the time.

The modern Bosnian standard took shape in the 1990s and 2000s. Lexically, Islamic-Oriental loanwords are more frequent; phonetically: the phoneme /x/ (letter &quot;h&quot;) is reinstated in many words as a distinct feature of vernacular Bosniak speech and language tradition; also, there are some changes in grammar, morphology and orthography that reflect the Bosniak pre-World War I literary tradition, mainly that of the Bosniak renaissance at the beginning of the 20th century.

===Controversy and recognition===

The name &quot;Bosnian language&quot; is a controversial issue for some Croats and Serbs, who also refer to it as the &quot;Bosniak&quot; language (, ). Bosniak linguists however insist that the only legitimate name is &quot;Bosnian&quot; language () and that that is the name that both Croats and Serbs should use. The controversy arises because the name &quot;Bosnian&quot; may seem to imply that it is the language of all Bosnians, while Bosnian Croats and Serbs reject that designation for their idioms.

The language is called &quot;Bosnian language&quot; in the 1995 Dayton Accords and is concluded by observers to have received legitimacy and international recognition at the time.

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO), United States Board on Geographic Names (BGN) and the Permanent Committee on Geographical Names (PCGN) recognize the Bosnian language. Furthermore, the status of the Bosnian language is also recognized by bodies such as the United Nations, UNESCO and translation and interpreting accreditation agencies, including internet translation services.

Most English-speaking language encyclopedias (Routledge, Glottolog, Ethnologue, etc.) register the language solely as &quot;Bosnian&quot; language. The Library of Congress registered the language as &quot;Bosnian&quot; and gave it an ISO-number. The Slavic language institutes in English-speaking countries offer courses in &quot;Bosnian&quot; or &quot;Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian&quot; language, not in &quot;Bosniak&quot; language (e.g. Columbia, Cornell, Chicago, Washington, Kansas). The same is the case in German-speaking countries, where the language is taught under the name , not (e.g. Vienna, Graz, Trier) with very few exceptions.

Some Croatian linguists (Zvonko Kovač, Ivo Pranjković, Josip Silić) support the name &quot;Bosnian&quot; language, whereas others (Radoslav Katičić, Dalibor Brozović, Tomislav Ladan) hold that the term &quot;Bosnian language&quot; is the only one appropriate and that accordingly the terms Bosnian language and Bosniak language refer to two different things. The Croatian state institutions, such as the Central Bureau of Statistics, use both terms: &quot;Bosniak&quot; language was used in the 2001 census, while the census in 2011 used the term &quot;Bosnian&quot; language.

The majority of Serbian linguists hold that the term &quot;Bosniak language&quot; is the only one appropriate, which was agreed as early as 1990.

The original form of The Constitution of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina called the language &quot;Bosniac language&quot;, until 2002 when it was changed in Amendment XXIX of the Constitution of the Federation by Wolfgang Petritsch. The original text of the Constitution of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina was agreed in Vienna and was signed by Krešimir Zubak and Haris Silajdžić on March 18, 1994.

The constitution of , the Serb-dominated entity within Bosnia and Herzegovina, did not recognize any language or ethnic group other than Serbian. Bosniaks were mostly expelled from the territory controlled by the Serbs from 1992, but immediately after the war they demanded the restoration of their civil rights in those territories. The Bosnian Serbs refused to make reference to the Bosnian language in their constitution and as a result had constitutional amendments imposed by High Representative Wolfgang Petritsch. However, the constitution of refers to it as the &quot;Language spoken by Bosniaks&quot;, because the Serbs were required to recognise the language officially, but wished to avoid recognition of its name.

Serbia includes the Bosnian language as an elective subject in primary schools. Montenegro officially recognizes the Bosnian language: its 2007 Constitution specifically states that although Montenegrin is the official language, Serbian, Bosnian, Albanian and Croatian are also in official use.

===Historical usage of the term===
*In the work that was written between 1423 and 1426, the Bulgarian chronicler Constantine the Philosopher, in parallel with the Bulgarian, Serbian, Slovenian, Czech and Croatian, he also mentions the Bosnian language.
*The notary book of the town of Kotor from July 3, 1436, recounts a duke buying a girl that is described as a: &quot;Bosnian woman, heretic and in the Bosnian language called Djevena&quot;.
*The work &quot;Thesaurus Polyglottus&quot;, published in Frankfurt am Main in 1603 by the German historian and linguist Hieronymus Megiser, mentions the Bosnian dialect alongside the Dalmatian, Croatian and Serbian one.
*The Bosnian Franciscan Matija Divković, regarded as the founder of the modern literature of Bosnia and Herzegovina, asserts in his work (&quot;The Christian doctrine for the Slavic peoples&quot;) from 1611 his &quot;translation from Latin to the real and true Bosnian language&quot; ()
*Bosniak poet and Aljamiado writer Muhamed Hevaji Uskufi Bosnevi who refers to the language of his 1632 dictionary&quot; Magbuli-arif&quot; as Bosnian.
*One of the first grammarians, the Jesuit clergyman Bartol Kašić calls the language used in his work from 1640 (&#x27;Roman Rite&#x27;) as (&#x27;our language&#x27;) or (&#x27;Bosnian&#x27;). He used the term &quot;Bosnian&quot; even though he was born in a Chakavian region: instead he decided to adopt a &quot;common language&quot; () based on a version of Shtokavian Ikavian.
*The Croatian linguist Jakov Mikalja (1601–1654) who states in his dictionary () from 1649 that he wants to include &quot;the most beautiful words&quot; adding that &quot;of all Illyrian languages the Bosnian is the most beautiful&quot;, and that all Illyrian writers should try to write in that language.
*18th century Bosniak chronicler Mula Mustafa Bašeskija who argues in his yearbook of collected Bosnian poems that the &quot;Bosnian language&quot; is much richer than the Arabic, because there are 45 words for the verb &quot;to go&quot; in Bosnian.
*The Venetian writer, naturalist and cartographer Alberto Fortis (1741–1803) calls in his work &quot;Viaggio in Dalmazia&quot; (&quot;Journey to Dalmatia&quot;) the language of Morlachs as Illyrian, Morlach and Bosnian.
*The Croatian writer and lexicographer Matija Petar Katančić published six volumes of biblical translations in 1831 described as being &quot;transferred from Slavo-Illyrian to the pronunciation of the Bosnian language&quot;.
*Croatian writer Matija Mažuranić refers in the work (1842) to the language of Bosnians as Illyrian (a 19th-century synonym to South Slavic languages) mixed with Turkish words, with a further statement that they are the speakers of the Bosniak language.
*The Bosnian Franciscan Ivan Franjo Jukić states in his work (1851) that Bosnia was the only Turkish land (i.e. under the control of the Ottoman Empire) that remained entirely pure without Turkish speakers, both in the villages and so on the highlands. Further he states &quot;[...] a language other than the Bosnian is not spoken [in Bosnia], the greatest Turkish [i.e. Muslim] gentlemen only speak Turkish when they are at the Vizier&quot;.
*Ivan Kukuljević Sakcinski, a 19th-century Croatian writer and historian, stated in his work &quot;(Travels into Bosnia)&quot; from 1858, how the &#x27;Turkish&#x27; (i.e. Muslim) Bosniaks, despite converting to the Muslim faith, preserved their traditions and the Slavic mood, and that they speak the purest variant of the Bosnian language, by refusing to add Turkish words to their vocabulary.

==Differences between Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian==
The differences between the Bosnian, Serbian, and Croatian literary standards are minimal. Although Bosnian employs more Turkish, Persian, and Arabic loanwords—commonly called orientalisms—mainly in its spoken variety due to the fact that most Bosnian speakers are Muslims, it is still very similar to both Serbian and Croatian in its written and spoken form. &quot;Lexical differences between the ethnic variants are extremely limited, even when compared with those between closely related Slavic languages (such as standard Czech and Slovak, Bulgarian and Macedonian), and grammatical differences are even less pronounced. More importantly, complete understanding between the ethnic variants of the standard language makes translation and second language teaching impossible.&quot;

The Bosnian language, as a new normative register of the Shtokavian dialect, was officially introduced in 1996 with the publication of &quot;&quot; in Sarajevo. According to that work, Bosnian differed from Serbian and Croatian on some main linguistic characteristics, such as: sound formats in some words, especially &quot;h&quot; ( versus Serbian ); substantial and deliberate usage of Oriental (&quot;Turkish&quot;) words; spelling of future tense () as in Croatian but not Serbian () (both forms have the same pronunciation). 2018, in the new issue of , words without &quot;h&quot; are accepted due to their prevalence in language practice.

==Sample text==
Article 1 of the &quot;Universal Declaration of Human Rights&quot; in Bosnian, written in the Cyrillic script:
:&quot;Сва људска бића рађају се слободна и једнака у достојанству и правима. Она су обдарена разумом и свијешћу и треба да једно према другоме поступају у духу братства.&quot;

Article 1 of the &quot;Universal Declaration of Human Rights&quot; in Bosnian, written in the Latin alphabet:
:&quot;Sva ljudska bića rađaju se slobodna i jednaka u dostojanstvu i pravima. Ona su obdarena razumom i sviješću i treba da jedno prema drugome postupaju u duhu bratstva.&quot;

Article 1 of the &quot;Universal Declaration of Human Rights&quot; in English:
:&quot;All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.&quot;

<text>Financial instruments are monetary contracts between parties. They can be created, traded, modified and settled. They can be cash (currency), evidence of an ownership, interest in an entity or a contractual right to receive or deliver in the form of currency (forex); debt (bonds, loans); equity (shares); or derivatives (options, futures, forwards).

International Accounting Standards IAS 32 and 39 define a financial instrument as &quot;any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity&quot;.

Financial instruments may be categorized by &quot;asset class&quot; depending on whether they are foreign exchange-based (reflecting foreign exchange instruments and transactions), equity-based (reflecting ownership of the issuing entity) or debt-based (reflecting a loan the investor has made to the issuing entity). If the instrument is debt it can be further categorized into short-term (less than one year) or long-term.

==Types==
Financial instruments can be either cash instruments or derivative instruments:
* Cash instruments – instruments whose value is determined directly by the markets. They can be securities, which are readily transferable, and instruments such as loans and deposits, where both borrower and lender have to agree on a transfer.
* Derivative instruments – instruments which derive their value from the value and characteristics of one or more underlying entities such as an asset, index, or interest rate. They can be exchange-traded derivatives and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. Some of the more common derivatives include forwards, futures, options, swaps, and variations of these such as synthetic collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps.

Some instruments defy categorization into the above matrix, for example repurchase agreements.

==Measuring gain or loss==
The gain or loss on a financial instrument is as follows:

<doc id="177776" wikidata="Q940054" url="?curid=177776" title="The Sin of Madelon Claudet">
<text>The Sin of Madelon Claudet is a 1931 American pre-Code drama film directed by Edgar Selwyn and starring Helen Hayes. The screenplay by Charles MacArthur and Ben Hecht was adapted from the play &quot;The Lullaby&quot; by Edward Knoblock. It tells the story of a wrongly imprisoned woman who turns to theft and prostitution in order to support her son.

==Plot==
When neglected wife Alice (Karen Morley) decides to leave her doctor husband Lawrence (Robert Young), his friend Dr. Dulac (Jean Hersholt) stops her and tells her the life story of another woman, the French Madelon Claudet (born May 7, 1878) (Helen Hayes), who was persuaded by her American boyfriend, artist Larry Maynard (Neil Hamilton), to run away with him. Eventually, he has to return to the U.S. because his father is sick. Once there however, he betrays her and marries a woman whom his parents approve of. Unbeknownst to him, Madelon gives birth to a son. When her lover does not come back, her father (Russ Powell) gets her to agree to marry Hubert (Alan Hale), a farmer. However, when she refuses to give up her illegitimate son, Hubert and her father abandon her. She becomes the mistress of an older acquaintance, Count Carlo Boretti (Lewis Stone), while her friends Rosalie (Marie Prevost) and Victor Lebeau (Cliff Edwards) care for the boy. After a while, Carlo proposes marriage and Madelon accepts. However, when they go out to celebrate, he is arrested as a jewel thief. He manages to commit suicide, but Madelon is sentenced to ten years in prison as his accomplice, even though she is innocent.

When she finally is released in 1919, she goes to see her teenage son Lawrence, now living at a state boarding school. A conversation with the school&#x27;s doctor proves crucial. Dr. Dulac reveals that because his father was a criminal, he cannot get better work elsewhere. Determined not to become a similar burden to her own child, she tells her son that she is an old friend of his mother, and that his mother is dead. Madelon is determined to finance Lawrence&#x27;s medical education, but with the end of World War I, millions of Frenchmen are released from the army and jobs are scarce. When a man mistakes her for a prostitute, she takes up the profession. As she ages and loses her looks, she is forced to steal as well, but finally, her goal is realized, and Lawrence receives his degree.

Aged and destitute, she decides to give up her freedom and commit herself to state charity, but visits her son one last time, pretending to be a patient. When she leaves, she encounters Dr. Dulac, who recognizes her and persuades his friend Dr. Claudet, still unaware of her true identity, to provide for her. After hearing of the woman&#x27;s self-sacrifice, Alice Claudet suggests to Lawrence he invite Madelon to live with them.

==Production==
The film originally was titled &quot;The Lullaby&quot;. Following its first preview, it was panned by critics, who were impressed by Hayes in her sound film debut after a couple of silent films, but thought the plot was conventional and sappy. Producer Irving Thalberg called in playwright Charles MacArthur, who was Hayes&#x27; husband, to doctor the script. He thoroughly revised it, omitting inconsequential characters and framing the story as a flashback.

Hayes had begun filming &quot;Arrowsmith&quot; for Samuel Goldwyn and had to complete that project before shooting her new scenes for the Thalberg film. It was retitled &quot;The Sin of Madelon Claudet&quot; and opened to widespread acclaim for both Hayes and the film itself. The score included the song &quot;Adios amor&quot;.

The film was voted one of the ten best pictures of the year by a &quot;Film Daily&quot; nationwide poll.

==Reception==
In his review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Mordaunt Hall wrote &quot;[Helen Hayes&#x27;] superb portrayal in a difficult role leaves only the regret that the powers that be did not see fit to have her make her screen début in a more cheerful study...&quot;The Sin of Madelon Claudet&quot; is a sorrowful chronicle which will undoubtedly have a strong popular appeal. It is endowed with other commendable impersonations...[and] also has the benefit of Edgar Selwyn&#x27;s expert direction.&quot;

&quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote that the film was &quot;remarkable because in it Helen Hayes appears in cinema for the first time and because it succeeds in its intention — to make audiences weep...By ceasing entirely to be Helen Hayes and becoming instead the woman whose life story she portrays, Cinemactress Hayes makes the familiarity of the story double its sadness...The picture is well directed by Edgar Selwyn [and] splendidly acted by the rest of the cast.&quot;

&quot;TV Guide&quot; rates the film four stars and calls it a &quot;well-acted soaper&quot;.

<doc id="177778" wikidata="Q1353213" url="?curid=177778" title="Islamic economics">
<text>Islamic economics () refers to the knowledge of economics or economic activities and processes in terms of Islamic principles and teachings. Islam has a set of specific moral norms and values about individual and social economic behavior. Therefore, it has its own economic system, which is based on its philosophical views and is compatible with the Islamic organization of other aspects of human behavior: social and political systems.

Islamic economics is a broad field, related to the more specific subset of Islamic commercial jurisprudence (, &quot;fiqh al-mu&#x27;āmalāt&quot;). It is also an ideology of economics similar to the labour theory of value, which is &quot;labour-based exchange and exchange-based labour&quot;. While there are differences between the two, Islamic economics still tends to be closer to labor theory rather than subjective theory.

Islamic commercial jurisprudence entails the rules of transacting finance or other economic activity in a &quot;Shari&#x27;a&quot; compliant manner, i.e., a manner conforming to Islamic scripture (Quran and sunnah).
Islamic jurisprudence (&quot;fiqh&quot;) has traditionally dealt with determining what is required, prohibited, encouraged, discouraged, or just permissible. according to the revealed word of God (Quran) and the religious practices established by Muhammad (sunnah). This applied to issues like property, money, employment, taxes, loans, along with everything else. The social science of economics, on the other hand, works to describe, analyse and understand production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, and, studied how to best achieve policy goals, such as full employment, price stability, economic equity and productivity growth.

Early forms of capitalism are thought to have been developed in the Islamic Golden Age, starting from the 9th century, and later became dominant in European Muslim territories like Al-Andalus and the Emirate of Sicily. The Islamic economic concepts taken and applied by the gunpowder empires and various Islamic kingdoms and sultanates led to systemic changes in their economy. particularly in the Mughal Empire. Its wealthiest region of Bengal, a major trading nation of the medieval world, signaled the period of proto-industrialization, making direct contribution to the world&#x27;s first Industrial Revolution after the British conquests.

In the mid-20th century, campaigns began promoting the idea of specifically Islamic patterns of economic thought and behavior. By the 1970s, &quot;Islamic economics&quot; was introduced as an academic discipline in a number of institutions of higher learning throughout the Muslim world and in the West. The central features of an Islamic economy are often summarized as (1) the &quot;behavioral norms and moral foundations&quot; derived from the Quran and Sunnah; (2) collection of &quot;zakat&quot; and other Islamic taxes; and (3) prohibition of interest (&quot;riba&quot;) charged on loans.

Advocates of Islamic economics generally describe it as neither socialist nor capitalist but as a &quot;third way&quot;, an ideal mean with none of the drawbacks of the other two systems. Among the assertions made for an Islamic economic system by Islamic activists and revivalists are that the gap between the rich and the poor will be reduced and prosperity enhanced, by such means as the discouraging of the hoarding of wealth, taxing wealth (through &quot;zakat&quot;) but not trade, exposing lenders to risk through profit sharing and venture capital, discouraging of hoarding of food for speculation, and other activities that Islam regards as sinful such as unlawful confiscation of land. Complementing Islamic economics, Islamic entrepreneurship has gained traction, focusing on Muslim entrepreneurs, ventures, and contextual factors at the intersection of Islamic faith and entrepreneurship.

==Definitions and descriptions==

According to Hasan Raza, after more than six decades of its formal/ informal existence, a consensus on the definition of Islamic economics has not yet emerged. Some definitions that have been offered include:

*&quot;that branch of knowledge which helps to realize human well-being through an allocation and distribution of scarce resources that is in conformity with Islamic teachings without unduly curbing individual freedom or creating continued macroeconomic and ecological imbalances.&quot; (Umar Chapra) (similarly, the &quot;study of human behavior with regard to acquiring and using resources for the satisfaction of necessities, needs, and other desires,&quot; but &quot;based on the assumptions&quot; of the Islamic &quot;outlook on life and humanity&quot;. (Monzer Kahf))
*&quot;the study of an ... economy which abides by the rules of the Shariah&quot;, i.e. an Islamic economy (a definition used by some, according to M. Anas Zarqa).
*a discipline that goes beyond the practice of Western economics—which seeks to make &quot;positive analysis&quot; and give an objective description of &quot;what is&quot;—to provide normative policy prescriptions of &quot;what ought to be&quot; and &quot;can be&quot;. And which seeks to achieve a &quot;transformation of human beings from followers of base desires to people concerned with achieving higher goals&quot;. (Feisal Khan describing the ideas of M.R. Zaman, M.U. Chapra, and M.N. Khan &amp; M.I. Bhatti.) 
*&quot;a discipline that is guided by the Shariah and studies all human societies&quot; (A definition used by others, according to M. Anas Zarqa)
*&quot;restatements of Islamic economic teachings&quot;, using &quot;modern economic jargon&quot;. (What most of the knowledge content in the body of Islamic economics amounts to according to economist Muhammad Akram Khan)
*an ideology
**&quot;a revolutionary ideology&quot; to change &quot;the corrupt reality ... into a pure one&quot;, and &quot;not a science of political economy&quot; or &quot;an objective analysis of existing reality&quot;. (Ayatollah Murtaza Mutahhari)
**an &quot;ideological construct&quot; developed by 20th century Islamists (by Abul A&#x27;la Maududi, Ayatollah Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr, Abolhassan Banisadr, etc.) taking basic prescriptions from sharia (Islamic law), and systematizing and conceptualizing them &quot;to construct a coherent and functional ensemble offering a middle ground between the two systems of the twentieth century, Marxism and capitalism.&quot; (Social scientist Olivier Roy)
* Zaman (2015) argues that confusion regarding appropriate definition of Islamic economics has arisen because of attempts to mix Western economics concepts with Islamic ideals, when the two are diametrically opposed to each other in many dimensions. He proposes a definition based on purely Islamic sources: &quot;Islamic Economics is the EFFORT/STRUGGLE to implement the orders of Allah pertaining to economic affairs in our individual lives (Micro), in our communities (Meso), and at the level of Ummah (Macro).&quot;

===Fiqh and Islamic economics===
Fiqh (religious law) has developed several traditional concepts having to do with economics. These included:
* &quot;Zakat&quot; – the &quot;charitable taxing of certain assets, such as currency, gold, or harvest, with an eye to allocating these taxes to eight expenditures that are also explicitly defined in the Quran, such as aid to those in need.&quot;
* &quot;Gharar&quot;—&quot;uncertainty&quot;. The presence of any element of excessive uncertainty, in a contract is prohibited.
* &quot;Riba&quot;—&quot;referred to as usury (modern Islamic economists reached consensus that Riba is any kind of interest, rather than just usury)&quot; is prohibited.

Another source lists &quot;general rules&quot; include prohibition of &quot;Riba&quot;, &quot;Gharar&quot;, and also 
*&quot;Qimar&quot; (gambling) and
*the encouragement of &quot;Taa’won&quot; (mutual cooperation),
*&quot;the overriding doctrine of fairness in commercial dealings is established.&quot;

These concepts, like others in Islamic law, came from study of the Quran and ahadith. 

In addition to Quran and ahadith, sometimes other sources such as &quot;al-urf&quot; (custom), or &quot;al-ijma&quot; (consensus of the jurists) are employed, to create laws that determine whether actions were forbidden, discouraged, allowed, encouraged and obligatory for Muslims. The different school of fiqh (&quot;madhhab&quot;) vary slightly in their rulings.

Works of fiqh are typically divided into different &quot;books&quot; such as a Book of &quot;Iman&quot;, of &quot;Salah&quot;, &quot;Zakat&quot;, &quot;Taqwa&quot;, &quot;Hajj,&quot; but not `economics` or `economy`. Some brief works might contain almost nothing related to matters of property, sales, finance Others do not gather questions on economic issues in one heading, the case in &quot;Tawzih al-masa&#x27;il&quot;, a work of fatawa by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who although a pioneer of political Islam approached the subject of economy 
Other works divided the subjects of fiqh into four &quot;quarters&quot;: typically worship (al-`Ibadat), marriage and family law (al-Munakahat), criminal law (Jinayat), commercial transaction law (&quot;Mu&#x27;amalat&quot;). At least one author (M. Kahf) writes that &quot;Mu&#x27;amalat&quot; is &quot;closely related&quot; to Islamic Economics. (However even with the &quot;quarters&quot; division of fiqh topics &quot;mu&#x27;amalat&quot; would not include inheritance or wedding dower (&quot;mahr&quot;) (which at least often comes under marriage and family law), or calculation of alms (&quot;zakat,&quot; which comes under &quot;al-`Ibadat&quot;)).

A number of scholars (Olivier Roy, Timur Kuran, Omar Norman) have noted the recentness of reflecting on economic issues in the Islamic world, and the difference between economics the social science based on data, and Islamic jurisprudence based on revealed truth.

Salman Ahmed Shaikh and Monzer Kahf insist on a clear distinction between the roles of &quot;Fiqh&quot; and Islamic Economics, Shaikh saying to be meritorious as a separate field of inquiry, Islamic economics cannot confine itself just to explaining and deducing laws in economic matters based on core principles. Since this function is already performed by the discipline of Islamic jurisprudence ... 
M. Kahf writes that &quot;mu&#x27;amalat&quot; and Islamic economics &quot;often intermingle&quot;, &quot;mu&#x27;amalat&quot; &quot;sets terms and conditions of conduct for economic and financial relationships in the Islamic economy&quot; and provides the &quot;grounds on which new instruments&quot; of Islamic financing are developed, but that the &quot;nature of &quot;Fiqh&quot; imposes a concern about individual transactions and their minute legalistic characteristics&quot;, so that analyzing Islamic economics in terms of &quot;Fiqh&quot;&quot; risks losing &quot;the ability to provide a macro economic theory&quot;.

According to economist Muhammad Akram Khan the &quot;main plank&quot; of Islamic economics is the &quot;theory of riba&quot;, while &quot;another landmark&quot; is zakat, a tax on wealth and income. According to another contemporary writer Salah El-Sheikh, &quot;Islamic economic principles&quot; (what he calls a &quot;FiqhiConomic model&quot;) utilize the Faqīh (Islamic jurisprudence) as supporting material, but are grounded upon the ethical teachings within the Qu&#x27;rān. Sharīah&#x27;s basic tenets involve gharar and (fadl māl bilā &#x27;iwad). Gharar insists all knowledge about a trade or transaction is known before two individuals complete a transaction and (fadl māl bilā &#x27;iwad) warns against unjustified enrichment through trade and business. These tenets were &quot;among the first economic regulations&quot; and their philosophy can be seen today in modern Capitalism. Within Sharīah, El-Sheikh states, Gharar functions as a divine deterrent against asymmetric information and allows trade to prosper. Riba, ensures each transaction is conducted at a fair price, not allowing one party to benefit exceedingly, which shares a parallel philosophy with Karl Marx &quot;Das Kapital&quot;: seeking a greater outcome for the community.

==History==
===Pre-modern Muslim thought on economics===
Classical scholars in the Muslim world did however, make valuable contributions to Islamic thought on issues involving production, consumption, income, wealth, property, taxation, land ownership, etc. are Abu Yusuf (d. 798), Muhammad bin al-Hasan (d. 805), Al-Mawardi (d. 1058), Ibn Hazm (d. 1064), Sarakhsi (d. 1090), Tusi (d. 1093), Ghazali (d. 1111), Al-Dimashqi (d. after 1175), Ibn Rushd (d. 1187), Ibn Taymiyyah (d.1328), Ibn al-Ukhuwwah (d. 1329), Ibn al-Qayyim (d. 1350), Sayyid Ali Hamadani (d. 1384), Al-Shatibi (d. 1388), Ibn Khaldun (d. 1406), Al-Maqrizi (d. 1442), Dawwani (d. 1501), Muhammad Aurangzeb Alamgir (d. 1707).

Abu Yusuf (d. 798) was author of the book &quot;al Kharaj&quot;—literally &quot;the return or revenue&quot; but was used by the author to mean &quot;public revenues and taxation&quot;—which was a policy guide to Harun al-Rashid, the fifth Abbasid Caliph. Muhammad bin al-Hasan (d.805) wrote &quot;al Iktisab fi al Rizq al Mustatab&quot; [Earned Desired income], intended as advice to businessmen &quot;in their endeavors to create income opportunities&quot;. Abu &#x27;Ubaid al Qasim bin Sallam (d.839) was the author of &quot;al-Amwal&quot; (plural of &quot;wealth&quot;).

Perhaps the most well-known Islamic scholar who wrote about economical issues was Ibn Khaldun, who has been called &quot;the father of modern economics&quot; by I.M. Oweiss. Ibn Khaldun wrote on what is now called economic and political theory in the introduction, or &quot;Muqaddimah&quot; (&quot;Prolegomena&quot;), of his &quot;History of the World&quot; (&quot;Kitab al-Ibar&quot;). He discussed what he called &quot;asabiyya&quot; (social cohesion), which he cited as the cause of the advancement of some civilizations. Ibn Khaldun felt that many social forces are cyclic, although there could be sudden sharp turns that break the pattern.

His ideas about the benefits of the division of labor also relate to &quot;asabiyya&quot;, the greater the social cohesion, the more complex the successful division may be, the greater the economic growth. He noted that growth and development positively stimulates both supply and demand, and that the forces of supply and demand are what determines the prices of goods. He also noted macroeconomic forces of population growth, human capital development, and technological developments effects on development. In fact, Ibn Khaldun thought that population growth was directly a function of wealth.

Medieval Islamic economics appears to have somewhat resembled a form of capitalism, some arguing that it laid the foundations for the development of modern capitalism.

===Early modern period===
Economic policies based on sharia were introduced throughout the gunpowder empires, which led to their commercial expansion. Chiefly the Ottoman Empire and Mughal India underwent substantial increases in per capita income and population, and a sustained pace of technological innovation. A significant event was the creation of Muslim India&#x27;s Fatawa &#x27;Alamgiri, compiled by Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb Alamgir and Shah Waliullah Dehlawi&#x27;s family, through which the Indian subcontinent surpassed Qing China to become the world&#x27;s largest economy, valued 25% of world GDP, while the region of Mughal Bengal entered a period of proto-industrialization, making direct contribution to England&#x27;s first Industrial Revolution after English dominance was established following the Battle of Plassey.

===Development of &quot;Islamic economics&quot;===
According to Turkish-American economist Timur Kuran, &quot;not until the mid-twentieth century&quot; was there any body of thought that could be called &quot;Islamic economics&quot;, that was &quot;recognizable as a coherent or self-contained doctrine&quot;. But around 1950 &quot;campaigns launched to identify self-consciously, if not also exclusively, Islamic patterns of economic thought and behavior&quot;. The famous early-20th Century Muslim nationalist and author Muhammad Iqbal, for example, did not refer to religion in his treatise on economics.

Islamic economics grew naturally from the Islamic revival and political Islam whose adherents considered Islam to be a complete system of life in all its aspects, rather than a spiritual formula and believed that it logically followed that Islam must have an economic system, unique from and superior to non-Islamic economic systems. &quot;Islamic economics&quot; &quot;emerged&quot; in the 1940s according to the Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World. Maulana ala Maududi&#x27;s 1941 address &quot;The economic problem of man and its Islamic solution&quot; (&quot;Insaan ka Maashi Maslah aur aus ka Islami Hul&quot;) is &quot;generally considered to be one of the founding documents of modern Islamic economics&quot;

More conservative salafi have shown less interest in socioeconomic issues, asking the question, &quot;the prophet and his companions didn&#x27;t study &#x27;laws&#x27; of economics, look for patterns, strive for understanding of what happens in commerce, production, consumption. Why should we?&quot; Maududi himself also dismissed the need for a &quot;new science of economics, embodied in voluminous books, with high-sounding terminology and large organisation&quot;, as the true &quot;economic problem of man&quot;—along with all his social, political and other problems—&quot;can be easily understood&quot; and is simply the failure to follow Islamic law.

;1960, 70s
In the 1960s and 1970s, Shi&#x27;a thinkers worked to describe Islamic economics&#x27; &quot;own answers to contemporary economic problems.&quot; Several works were particularly influential:
* &quot;Eslam va Malekiyyat&quot; (Islam and Property) by Mahmud Taleqani (1951),
* &quot;Iqtisaduna&quot; (Our Economics) by Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr (1961) and
* &quot;Eqtesad-e Towhidi&quot; (The Economics of Divine Harmony) by Abolhassan Banisadr (1978)
* &quot;Some Interpretations of Property Rights, Capital and Labor from Islamic Perspective&quot; by Habibullah Peyman (1979).

Al-Sadr in particular was described as having &quot;almost single-handedly developed the notion of Islamic economics&quot;.

In their writings, Sadr and the other authors &quot;sought to depict Islam as a religion committed to social justice, the equitable distribution of wealth, and the cause of the deprived classes,&quot; with doctrines &quot;acceptable to Islamic jurists,&quot; while refuting existing non-Islamic theories of capitalism and Marxism. Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr and also cleric Mahmoud Taleghani developed an &quot;Islamic economics&quot; emphasizing a major role for the state in matters such as circulation and equitable distribution of wealth, and a reward to participants in the marketplace for being exposed to risk or liability. 
This version of Islamic economics, which influenced the Iranian Revolution, called for public ownership of land and of large &quot;industrial enterprises,&quot; while private economic activity continued &quot;within reasonable limits.&quot; These ideas informed the large public sector and public subsidy policies of the Iranian Revolution.

Sunni cleric Taqiuddin al-Nabhani proposed economic system (&quot;Nidham ul-Iqtisad fil Islam&quot; (The Economic System of Islam) by Taqiuddin Nabhani (1953)) combined public ownership of large chunks of the economy (utilities, public transport, health care, energy resources such as oil, and unused farm land), with use of the gold standard and specific instructions for the gold and silver weights of coins, arguing this would &quot;demolish ... American control and the control of the dollar as an international currency.&quot;

Likewise, Sunni imam Imran Nazar Hosein preached a similar system to al-Nabhani, advocating for a syncretic system with a gold / silver standard, while also having heavy government regulations of the market. Hosein is notable for being among a faction of Islamic scholars with a strict interpretation of riba prohibitions in the Qur&#x27;an, with the general definition of interest being as broad as money increasing over time for a single purchase. 

In the Sunni world the first international conference on Islamic economics was held at the King Abdulaziz University in Jeddah in 1976. Since then the International Association for Islamic Economics in collaboration with the Islamic Development Bank has held conferences in Islamabad (1983), Kuala Lumpur (1992), Loughborough (2000), Bahrain (2003), Jakarta (2005) and Jeddah (2008), Iqbal (2008). In addition there have been hundreds of seminars, workshops and discussion groups around the world on Islamic economics and finance. In the U.S. a small number of patent applications have been filed for Sharia compliant financial service methods.
;Khomeini era
What has been called one of &quot;two versions&quot; of &quot;Islamic economy&quot; existed during the first ten years (1979–1989) of the Islamic Republic of Iran during the life of Supreme Leader (and revolution founder) Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. This was an &quot;Islamist socialist, and state-run&quot;: It was &quot;little by little supplanted&quot; by a more liberal economic policy.

;Post-socialist trend
In the 1980s and 1990s, as the Islamic revolution failed to reach the per capita income level achieved by the regime it overthrew, and communist states and socialist parties in the non-Muslim world turned away from socialism, Muslim interest shifted away from government ownership and regulation. In Iran, &quot;&quot;eqtesad-e Eslami&quot; (meaning both Islamic economics and economy) ... once a revolutionary shibboleth, is indubitably absent in all official documents and the media. It disappeared from Iranian political discourse&quot; about 1990. During the era of Zia-ul-Haq, several Islamic economic concepts and practices were introduced into the domestic economy, as part of Zia&#x27;s Islamisation reforms (see Islamic economics in Pakistan).

The term lived on in the Muslim world, shifting form to the less ambitious goal of interest-free banking. Some Muslim bankers and religious leaders suggested ways to integrate Islamic law on usage of money with modern concepts of ethical investing. In banking this was done through the use of sales transactions (focusing on the fixed rate return modes) to support investing without interest-bearing debt. Many modern writers have strongly criticized this approach as a means of covering conventional banking with an Islamic facade. (Sohrab Behada has argued that the economic system proposed by Islam is essentially a capitalist one.)

==== Similarity of Islamic economy with other countries ====
In an interview with Professor Hossein Askari, a professor at George Washington University, the German newspaper &quot;Suddeutsche&quot; prepared a report on the ranking of countries that &quot;respect Islamic values&quot;.
Ireland, Luxembourg and Denmark are at the top of the said ranking table in relation to &quot;Islamic economy in non-Islamic countries&quot;. No Muslim-majority country is among the top 25 countries in this ranking. Israel is in 27th place and thus much higher than Saudi Arabia which is in 91st place. Germany is in 26th place in this table. In the research conducted by Shahrzad Rahman and Hossein Askari, two professors of George Washington University, an estimate of the extent of Islamic economy of 208 countries around the world was made, the results of which are very interesting and according to that, many countries that, although are not Islamic (such as Ireland, Denmark, Luxembourg and Sweden); But their economy has similarities with the economic model of Islam or the Islamic economy.

==As an academic discipline==

===Achievements===

In 1998, Javed Ahmad Khan compiled &quot;Islamic Economics and Finance: A Bibliography&quot;, and listed 1600 items published over 20 years, including books, articles, dissertations, theses and conference papers. 

As of 2008 there were:
*Eight magazines recently started &quot;exclusively devoted to Islamic economics and finance&quot;,
*484 research projects in various universities of ten countries including the US, the UK and Germany.
*200 Ph.D. dissertations completed at different universities of the world, literature published English, Arabic, Urdu, Bahasa Malaysia, Turkish and other regional languages.
*&quot;Over a thousand unique titles on Islamic economics and finance&quot; in IFP databank
*1500 conferences (whose proceedings are available in IFP databank)
*One school—the Kulliyyah of Economics and Management Sciences of International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM)—has produced over 2000 graduates in 25 years as of 2009.

King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah hosted the first international conference on Islamic economics in 1976. Thereafter the International Association for Islamic Economics in collaboration with the Islamic Development Bank has held conferences in Islamabad (1983), Kuala Lumpur (1992), Loughborough (2000), Bahrain (2003), Jakarta (2005), Jeddah (2008) and Iqbal (2008).

===Challenges===
Along with these achievements, some Islamic economists have complained of problems in the academic discipline: a shift in interest away from Islamic Economics to Islamic Finance since the 1980s, a shortage of university courses, reading materials that are &quot;either scant or of poor quality&quot;, lack of intellectual freedom, &quot;narrow focus&quot; on interest-free banking and zakat without data-based research to substantiate claim made for them—that interest causes economic problems or that zakat solves them.

A number of economists have lamented that while Islamic Finance was originally a &quot;subset&quot; of Islamic Economics, economics and research in pure Islamic economics has been &quot;shifted to the back burner&quot;. Funding for research has gone to Islamic Finance despite the lack of &quot;scientific knowledge to back&quot; the claims made for Islamic Finance. Enrollment has subsided in classes and second and third generation Islamic economists are scarce, some institutions have &quot;lost their real direction and some have even been closed&quot;. and interest of economists in the field&#x27;s &quot;grand idea&quot; of providing an alternative to capitalism and socialism has &quot;yielded&quot; to the &quot;needs&quot; of the &quot;industry&quot; of Islamic Finance.

According to economist Rasem Kayed, while a number of universities and institutes of higher learning now offer courses on Islamic economics and finance &quot;most of the courses offered by these institutions pertain to Islamic finance rather than Islamic economics.&quot;
Surveying Islamic economics and finance courses being offered as of 2008 by 14 universities in Muslim countries, Kayed found 551 courses in conventional economics and finance, and only 12 courses in Islamic economics and finance (only 2% of the total). This &quot;appalling and intolerable ... negligence&quot; was made worse by the curriculum of the courses which failed to debate &quot;the issues&quot; the discipline or give &quot;due thought to ... the future development of Islamic financial industry&quot; but rather attempted &quot;to squeeze as much abstract information&quot; as possible in their courses, according to Kayed.

Another economist (Muhammad Akram Khan) lamented that &quot;the real problem is that despite efforts for developing a separate discipline of Islamic economics, there is not much that can be genuinely called `economics`. Most of Islamic economics consists of theology on economic matters.&quot;
Another (M.N. Siddiqi) notes Islamic economics has been teaching &quot;conventional economics from an Islamic perspective&quot;, rather than Islamic economics.

Despite its start in 1976, as of 2009, 2013 Islamic economics was called still in its infancy, its &quot;curricula frames, course structures, reading materials, and research&quot;, &quot;mostly&quot; anchored in the &quot;mainstream tradition&quot;, &quot;lacking sufficiency, depth, coordination and direction,&quot; with teaching faculties in many cases ... found short of the needed knowledge, scholarship, and commitment.&quot; &quot;Distinct textbooks and teaching materials&quot; required have been found to &quot;neither exist&quot; nor be &quot;easy to create.&quot; Despite shortcomings in academic writing—most of the books are &quot;not cohesive&quot; and are &quot;at best no more than extended papers on specific topics&quot;—constructive evaluations are not common and response to what there is even less common. 
The lack of an Islamic economics textbook &quot;looms large&quot; for Muslim economists and scholars. Despite the holding of a workshop in November 2010 to arrange the writing of such a textbook, the participation of &quot;a number of eminent Muslim economists&quot;, (at the International Institute of Islamic Thought in London) and the appointment of &quot;a noted Muslim economist&quot; to coordinate the production of the textbook, as of 2015 &quot;no standard textbook of Islamic economics was available.&quot;

Islamic economic institutes are not known for their intellectual freedom, and according to Muhammad Akram Khan are unlikely to allow criticism of the ideas or policies of their founding leaders or governments. The Centre for Research in Islamic Economics, an organ of the Jeddah University in Saudi Arabia, for example, &quot;cannot allow publication of any work that goes against the orthodox thinking of the influential&quot; Saudi religious leadership. Despite &quot;tall talk about ijtehad&quot;, Islamic economists &quot;are shy&quot; about &quot;suggesting innovative ideas&quot; for fear of antagonizing religious clerics.

Use of Islamic terminology not only for distinctive Islamic concepts such as &quot;riba, zakat, mudaraba&quot; but also for concepts that do not have specific Islamic connotation—&quot;adl&quot; for justice, &quot;hukuma&quot; for government—locking out non-Muslim and even not Arabic speaking readers from the content of Islamic economics and even &quot;giving legitimacy&quot; to &quot;pendantry&quot; in the field.

==Property==
According to authors F. Nomani and A. Rahnema, the Qur&#x27;an states that God is the sole owner of all matter in the heavens and the earth, but man is God&#x27;s viceregent on earth and holds God&#x27;s possessions in trust (&quot;amanat&quot;). Islamic jurists divide properties into public, state, private categories.

Some Muslims believe that the Shariah provides &quot;specific laws and standards regarding the use and allocation of resources including land, water, animals, minerals, and
manpower.&quot;

===Public property===
According to M. A. Khan, &quot;Islam introduced the distinction between private property and public property and made the rulers accountable to the people&quot;. 
Scholars F. Nomani and A. Rahnema state that public property in Islam refers to natural resources (forests, pastures, uncultivated land, water, mines, oceanic resources etc.) to which all humans have equal right. Such resources are considered the common property of the community. Such property is placed under the guardianship and control of the Islamic state, and can be used by any citizen, as long as that use does not undermine the rights of other citizens, according to Nomani and Rahnema.

The owner of previously public property that is privatized pays &quot;zakat&quot; and, according to Shi&#x27;ite scholars, &quot;khums&quot; as well.
In general, the privatization and nationalization of public property is subject to debate amongst Islamic scholars.

According to an analysis by Walid El-Malik in 1993, only the Maliki school took the position that all kinds of natural resources are state-owned; the Hanafi school took the opposite view and held that mineral ownership followed surface ownership, while the other two schools, Shafi&#x27;i and Hanbali, drew a distinction between &quot;hidden&quot; and &quot;unhidden&quot; minerals.

===State property===
State property includes certain natural resources, as well as other property that cannot immediately be privatized. Islamic state property can be movable, or immovable, and can be acquired through conquest or peaceful means. Unclaimed, unoccupied and heir-less properties, including uncultivated land (&quot;mawat&quot;), can be considered state property.

During the life of Muhammad, one fifth of military equipment captured from the enemy in the battlefield was considered state property. During his reign, Umar (on the recommendation of Ali) considered conquered land to be state rather than private property (as was usual practice). The purported reason for this was that privatizing this property would concentrate resources in the hands of a few, and prevent it from being used for the general good. The property remained under the occupation of the cultivators, but taxes were collected on it for the state treasury.

Muhammad said &quot;Old and fallow lands are for God and His Messenger (i.e. state property), then they are for you&quot;. Jurists draw from this the conclusion that, ultimately, private ownership takes over state property.

===Private property===
There is consensus amongst Islamic jurists and social scientists that Islam recognizes and upholds the individual&#x27;s right to private ownership. The Qur&#x27;an extensively discusses taxation, inheritance, prohibition against stealing, legality of ownership, recommendation to give charity and other topics related to private property. Islam also guarantees the protection of private property by imposing stringent punishments on thieves. Muhammad said that he who dies defending his property was like a martyr.

Islamic economists classify the acquisition of private property into involuntary, contractual and non-contractual categories. Involuntary means are inheritances, bequests, and gifts. Non-contractual acquisition involves the collection and exploitation of natural resources that have not previously been claimed as private property. Contractual acquisition includes activities such as trading, buying, renting, hiring labor etc.

A tradition attributed to Muhammad, with which both Sunni and Shi&#x27;a jurists agree, in cases where the right to private ownership causes harm to others, then Islam favors curtailing the right in those cases. Maliki and Hanbali jurists argue that if private ownership endangers public interest, then the state can limit the amount an individual is allowed to own. This view, however, is debated by others.

When Muhammad migrated to Madinah many of the Muslims owned agricultural land. Muhammad confirmed this ownership and allocated land to individuals. The land allotted would be used for housing, farming or gardening. For example, Bilal b. Harith was given land with mineral deposits at &#x27;Aqiq Valley, Hassan b. Thabit was afforded the garden of Bayruha and Zubayr received oasis land at Khaybar and Banu Nadir. During the reign of Caliph Umar, a vast expanse of Persian royal family terrain had been acquired, this lead his successor Caliph Uthman to accelerate the allotment of land to individuals in return for a portion of the crop yield.

==Markets==
According to M. S. Naz, regulation of markets is among the main functions of &quot;hisbah&quot;, the &quot;semi-judicial institution&quot; operational from the &quot;earliest days of Islam&quot;. It was &quot;charged with responsibility of carrying out the spirit of the system, setting conditions that preserve and enhance the public health and interests, protect the consumers, solve business and labor disputes, promote good market behavior, and ensure their observance.&quot; M. A. Khan states, institution of &quot;Hisbah&quot; as established to &quot;supervise markets, to provide municipal services, and to settle petty disputes&quot;. In the contemporary era, Pakistan has attempted to re-create this institution, although it has jurisdiction only over the administrative excesses of the federal government departments and agencies, not provincial ones or private companies.

According to Nomani and Rahnema, Islam accepts markets as the basic coordinating mechanism of the economic system. Islamic teaching holds that the market, given perfect competition, allows consumers to obtain desired goods and producers to sell their goods at a mutually acceptable price.

Three necessary conditions for an operational market are said (by Nomani and Rahnema) to be upheld in Islamic primary sources:
* Freedom of exchange: the Qur&#x27;an calls on believers to engage in trade, and rejects the contention that trade is forbidden.
* Private ownership (see above).
* Security of contract: the Qur&#x27;an calls for the fulfillment and observation of contracts. The longest verse of the Qur&#x27;an deals with commercial contracts involving immediate and future payments.

Another author (Nima Mersadi Tabari) claims that the general doctrine of fairness in sharia law creates &quot;an ethical economic model&quot; and forbids market manipulation such as &quot;inflating the price of commodities by creating artificial shortages (&quot;Ihtekar&quot;), overbidding for the sole purpose of driving the prices up (&quot;Najash&quot;) and concealment of vital information in a transaction from the other party (&quot;Ghish&quot;)&quot;.

Further, &quot;uninformed speculation&quot; not based on a proper analysis of available information is forbidden because it is a form of &quot;Qimar&quot;, or gambling, and results in accumulating &quot;Maysir&quot; (unearned income). Commercial contracting under conditions of &quot;excessive uncertainty&quot; (however that is defined) is a form of &quot;Gharar&quot; and so also forbidden.

===Interference===
Proponents such as M. A. Khan, Nomani and Rahnema also contend that the &quot;Islamic economy&quot; forbids or at least discourages market manipulation such as price fixing, hoarding and bribery. Government intervention in the economy is tolerated under specific circumstances.

Another author (Nima Mersadi Tabari) states that in Islam &quot;everything is &quot;Halal&quot; (allowed) unless it has been declared &quot;Haram&quot; (forbidden)&quot;, consequently &quot;the Islamic economic model is based on the freedom of trade and freedom of contract so far as the limits of Shari’ah allow&quot;.

Nomani and Rahnema say that Islam prohibits price fixing by a dominating handful of buyers or sellers. During the days of Muhammad, a small group of merchants met agricultural producers outside the city and bought the entire crop, thereby gaining a monopoly over the market. The produce was later sold at a higher price within the city. Muhammad condemned this practice since it caused injury both to the producers (who in the absence of numerous customers were forced to sell goods at a lower price) and the inhabitants.

The above-mentioned reports are also used to justify the argument that the Islamic market is characterized by free information. Producers and consumers should not be denied information on demand and supply conditions. Producers are expected to inform consumers of the quality and quantity of goods they claim to sell. Some scholars hold that if an inexperienced buyer is swayed by the seller, the consumer may nullify the transaction upon realizing the seller&#x27;s unfair treatment. The Qur&#x27;an also forbids discriminatory transactions.

Bribery is also forbidden in Islam and can therefore not be used to secure a deal or gain favor in a transaction, it was narrated that Muhammad cursed the one who offers the bribe, the one who receives it, and the one who arranges it.

Nomani and Rahnema say government interference in the market is justified in exceptional circumstances, such as the protection of public interest. Under normal circumstances, governmental non-interference should be upheld. When Muhammad was asked to set the price of goods in a market he responded, &quot;I will not set such a precedent, let the people carry on with their activities and benefit mutually.&quot;

==Banking and finance==
Islamic banking has been called &quot;the most visible practical achievement&quot; of Islamic economics, and the &quot;most visible mark&quot; of Islamic revivalism. By 2009, there were over 300 &quot;shariah compliant banks and 250 mutual funds around the world, and around $2 trillion were sharia-compliant by 2014.

However, the domination of the industry by debt-like instruments such as &quot;murabaha&quot; rather than risk-sharing products, has driven even some leading advocates and experts in Islamic banking (such as Muhammad Nejatullah Siddiqi) to talk about &quot;a crisis of identity of the Islamic financial movement.&quot;

===Interest===
The most noticeable and/or important objective of Islamic Banking has been a ban on the charging of interest on loans. The Quran (3: 130) condemns &quot;riba&quot; (which is usually translated as &quot;interest&quot;): &quot;O, you who believe! Devour not &quot;riba&quot;, doubled and redoubled, and be careful of Allah; but fear Allah that you may be successful.&quot;

===Islamic public finance (&quot;Bayt-al-Mal&quot;)===
The only financial institution under Islamic Governance (Prophethood and Caliph Period) was Baitulmaal (public treasury) wherein the wealths were distributed instantly on the basis of need. During Prophethood the last receipt was tribute from Bahrain amounting eight hundred thousands dirham which was distributed in just one sitting. Though the first Caliph earmarked a house for Baitulmaal where all money was kept on receipt. As all money was distributed immediately the treasury generally remained locked up. At the time of his death there was only one dirham in the Baitulmaal. The second caliph besides developing the Central Baitulmaal also opened Baitulmaal at state and headquarters levels. He also carried census during his caliphate; and provisioned salaries to Government employees, stipend to poor and needy people along with social security to unemployed and retirement pensions.

The concept of a public financial institution played a historic role in the Islamic economy. The idea of state collected wealth being made available to the needy general public was relatively new. The resources in the Bayt-al-Mal were considered God&#x27;s resources and a trust, money paid into the shared bank was common property of all the Muslims and the ruler was just the trustee.

The shared bank was treated as a financial institution and therefore subjected to the same prohibitions regarding interest. Caliph Umar spoke on the shared bank saying: &quot;I did not find the betterment of this wealth except in three ways: (i) it is received by right, (ii) it is given by right, and (iii) it is stopped from wrong. As regards my own position vis-a-vis this wealth of yours; it is like that of a guardian of an orphan. If I am well-off, I shall leave it, but if I am hard-pressed I shall take from it as is genuinely permissible.&quot;

===Proposals===
====Savings and investment====
An alternative Islamic savings-investment model can be built around venture capital; investment banks; restructured corporations; and restructured stock market. This model looks at removing the interest-based banking and in replacing market inefficiencies such as subsidization of loans over profit-sharing investments due to double taxation and restrictions on investment in private equity.

====Hybrids====
Islamic banks have grown recently in the Muslim world, but are a very small share of the global economy compared to the Western debt banking paradigm. Hybrid approaches, which applies classical Islamic values but uses conventional lending practices, are much lauded by some proponents of modern human development theory.

==Criticism and dispute==
Islamic economics has been criticised for
*being &quot;constructed on the basis of isolated prescriptions, anecdotes, examples, words of the Prophet, all gathered together and systematized by commentators according to an inductive, casuistic method.&quot;
*its alleged &quot;incoherence, incompleteness, impracticality, and irrelevance&quot;, driven by &quot;cultural identity&quot; rather than problem solving (Timur Kuran, John Foster);
*being &quot;a hodgepodge of populist and socialist ideas&quot; in theory, and &quot;nothing more than inefficient state control of the economy and some almost equally ineffective redistribution policies&quot; in practice (Fred Halliday);
In a political and regional context where Islamist and ulema claim to have an opinion about everything, it is striking how little they have to say about this most central of human activities, beyond repetitious pieties about how their model is neither capitalist nor socialist.
*being little more than a mimicry of conventional economics embellished with verses of the Quran and sunnah (Muhammad Akram Khan);
*claiming to call for a return to Islamic practices that are actually an &quot;invented tradition&quot; (Timur Kuran);
*failing to achieve its goals of abolishing interest on money, establishing economic equality, and a superior business ethic; but nonetheless &quot;spared critical scrutiny out of ignorance, misguided tolerance&quot;, and because its methods and objectives are considered &quot;too unrealistic to threaten prevailing economic structures&quot; (Timur Kuran).

On economic reforms, Timur Kuran said it is a &quot;vehicle for asserting the primacy of Islam&quot; with reforms being a secondary motive.

;Islamic banking and finance
One significant result of Islamic economics (and target of criticism) is the creation of Islamic banking and finance industry. According to several scholars it has bred a new &quot;Power Alliance&quot; of &quot;wealth and Shari&#x27;ah scholarship&quot;,—wealthy banks and clients paying Islamic scholars to provide bank products with Islamic &quot;shariah compliance&quot;. Journalist John Foster, quotes an investment banker based in the Islamic Banking hub of Dubai on the practice of &quot;fatwa shopping&quot;,

We create the same type of products that we do for the conventional markets. We then phone up a Sharia scholar for a Fatwa [seal of approval, confirming the product is Shari&#x27;ah compliant]. If he doesn&#x27;t give it to us, we phone up another scholar, offer him a sum of money for his services and ask him for a Fatwa. We do this until we get Sharia compliance. Then we are free to distribute the product as Islamic.

Foster explains that the fee for services provided by &quot;top&quot; scholars is &quot;often&quot; in six-figures, i.e. over US$100,000.

One critic (Muhammad O. Farooq) argues that this unfortunate situation has arisen because the &quot;preoccupation&quot; among supporters of Islamic Economics that any and all interest on loans is &quot;riba&quot; and forbidden by Islam, and because risk-sharing alternatives to interest bearing loans originally envisioned for Islamic banking have not proven feasible. With the elimination of interest being both the basis of the industry and impractical, shari&#x27;a scholars have become &quot;entrapped in a situation&quot; where they are forced to approve transactions fundamentally similar to conventional loans but using &quot;hiyal&quot; manipulation to &quot;maintain an Islamic veneer&quot;.

;Justice
Instead of &quot;fixating&quot; on interest, Farooq urges a focus on &quot;the larger picture&quot; of &quot;justice&quot;, and in economics on fighting exploitation from &quot;greed and profit,&quot; and the concentration of wealth. He quotes an ayat in support: &quot;What God has bestowed on his Messenger (and taken away) from the people of the townships, - belongs to God, - to his Messenger and to kindred and orphans, the needy and the wayfarer; &quot;in order that it may not (merely) make a circuit between the wealthy among you.&quot; ...&quot; As an example of the neglect of this issue, Farooq complains that one &quot;rather comprehensive&quot; bibliography of Islamic economics and finance, contains &quot;not a single citation for exploitation or injustice&quot; among its 700 entries.

A former director of Pakistan Institute of Development Economics and the head of Pakistan&#x27;s Economic Affairs Division, Syed Nawab Haider Naqvi, also called for &quot;comprehensive Islamic reform to establish an exploitation-free economic system&quot; and not just &quot;mechanical substitution of profit for interest.&quot;

;Zakat
On the issue of &quot;zakat&quot;, one of the pillars of Islam, M.A.Khan also criticizes the conservatism of Islamic Economics, complaining that &quot;the insistence of Muslim scholars in implementing it in the same form as it was common practice in the days of the Prophet and the first four caliphs ... has made it irrelevant to the needs of a contemporary society.&quot;

;Practicality
A supporter of Islamic economics (Asad Zaman) describes a &quot;major difficulty&quot; faced by Islamic reformers of Islamic economics and pointed out by other authors, namely that because a financial system is an &quot;integrated and coherent structure&quot;, to create an Islamic system &quot;based on trust, community and no interest&quot; requires &quot;changes and interventions on several different fronts simultaneously&quot;.

<text>Lynn Fontanne (; 6 December 1887 – 30 July 1983) was an English actress. After early success in supporting roles in the West End, she met the American actor Alfred Lunt, whom she married in 1922 and with whom she co-starred in Broadway and West End productions over the next four decades. They became known as &quot;The Lunts&quot;, and were celebrated on both sides of the Atlantic.

Fontanne was born in what is now the London suburb of Woodford, and received her first training as an actress from Ellen Terry. After building up an acting career in Britain she worked extensively in the US, first appearing in New York in 1910. Although she appeared in classics including &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; and &quot;The Seagull&quot;, experimental drama by Eugene O&#x27;Neill, and dark comedy by Friedrich Dürrenmatt, Fontanne and her husband were best known for their stylish performances in light comedies by Noël Coward, S. N. Behrman, Terence Rattigan and others, and romantic plays by writers such as Robert E. Sherwood.

The Lunts retired from the stage in 1960, and lived at their home in Genesee Depot, Wisconsin, where, after outliving her husband by six years, Fontanne died at the age of 95.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Fontanne was born Lillie Louise Fontanne in Woodford, Essex (now London), on 6 December 1887. She was the youngest of the three daughters of Jules Pierre Antoine Fontanne (1855–1942) and his wife Frances Ellen, &quot;née&quot; Thornley (1858–1921). She was educated in London, after which a family friend introduced her to the leading actress Ellen Terry, who sometimes gave lessons to promising young players. Partly as a result of Terry’s training and influence, Fontanne was given roles in plays in London and on tour throughout England from 1905 to 1916. She made her first appearance at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, at Christmas 1905, in the chorus of the pantomime, &quot;Cinderella&quot;, and subsequently &quot;walked on&quot; (i.e. was a non-speaking extra) in productions in London starring Lewis Waller, Sir Herbert Tree, Lena Ashwell and others.
During 1909, she toured as Rose in &quot;Lady Frederick&quot; with Mabel Love. At the Garrick Theatre, London, in December 1909 she appeared in &quot;Where Children Rule&quot;, and in &quot;Billy&#x27;s Bargain&quot; at the same theatre in June 1910 she played Lady Mulberry. She then made her first visit to America, making her début in New York at Nazimova&#x27;s 39th Street Theatre in November 1910 as Harriet Budgeon in &quot;Mr Preedy and the Countess&quot; with Weedon Grossmith.

After returning to London in 1911 she played at the Criterion Theatre in &quot;The Young Lady of Seventeen&quot; and at the Vaudeville in &quot;A Storm in a Tea Shop&quot;. She then toured in the provinces in 1912–13 as Gertrude Rhead in Arnold Bennett and Edward Knoblock&#x27;s &quot;Milestones&quot;, before playing the part in London. In that role she had to play the same character in youth, middle age and old age. The American star Laurette Taylor saw her in the role and was impressed. At the Royalty Theatre in April 1914 Fontanne scored a success as Liza and Mrs Collison in Knoblock&#x27;s &quot;My Lady&#x27;s Dress&quot;. She played in four other London productions in 1914–15, including the premiere of &quot;The Starlight Express&quot;. She became engaged to marry a young lawyer, Teddy Byrne, but he was killed in action in 1916 during the First World War.

===Broadway===

Shortly before Byrne&#x27;s death, Fontanne accepted an offer to join Laurette Taylor&#x27;s company in New York. Taylor and her husband, Hartley Manners, fostered the young Fontanne&#x27;s career. Taylor later said, &quot;While acting with her I forgot we were actresses&quot;. After five plays with them, Fontanne graduated to leading roles for other managements. Between 1918 and 1920, she succeeded Laura Hope Crews as Mrs Rockingham in &quot;A Pair of Petticoats&quot; in New York, and was the female lead in new plays on Broadway and in Chicago and Philadelphia. During this time, playing in summer stock in Washington DC, she met the actor Alfred Lunt. They fell in love, although at first Lunt&#x27;s wooing was more hesitant than Fontanne would have wished.

In mid-1920 Fontanne appeared once again in the West End, appearing with Taylor in a play by Manners, &quot;One Night in Rome.&quot; She had little chance to shine in what &quot;The Stage&quot; called &quot;a one-part play&quot; written as a vehicle for Taylor. Wanting to be reunited with Lunt, Fontanne quickly returned to the US, where in 1921 she had her first big success, in the lead role of George S. Kaufman and Marc Connelly&#x27;s comedy &quot;Dulcy&quot;. She did not return to the West End for nine years.

In May 1922 Fontanne married Lunt, and in 1923 they made their first appearance together in a Broadway production, a revival of Paul Kester&#x27;s 1900 costume drama &quot;Sweet Nell of Old Drury&quot;. Although Taylor was the female lead, it was Fontanne who impressed the critics. In &quot;The New York Herald&quot;, Alexander Woolcott dismissed the play as &quot;gaudy rubbish&quot;, but added:
===Theatre Guild===

In 1924, the Lunts joined the company of the Theatre Guild, which, in the words of Fontanne&#x27;s biographer Jared Brown, &quot;staged plays on Broadway but defied Broadway conventions by offering serious and innovative plays that were regularly rejected by commercial managements&quot;. The first play in which the couple appeared for the Guild was Ferenc Molnár&#x27;s &quot;The Guardsman,&quot; in which they established a reputation for playing light comedy. They acted together in three plays by Bernard Shaw: &quot;Arms and the Man&quot; (as Raina and Bluntschli, 1925), &quot;Pygmalion&quot; (as Eliza and Higgins, 1926) and &quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Dilemma&quot; (as the Dubedats, 1927). Fontanne had the chance to demonstrate her versatility by switching from comedy to demanding experimental drama in Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;Strange Interlude&quot; (1928), described by Woolcott as &quot;the &quot;Abie&#x27;s Irish Rose&quot; of the pseudo-intelligentsia&quot;.

Fontanne and Lunt introduced a naturalistic new way of delivering dialogue, building on a technique Fontanne had begun to explore in her performances with Laurette Taylor. It was unheard of for an actor to speak while another was still speaking, but, in Brown&#x27;s words:
As a consequence, according to Brown, the Lunts&#x27; scenes together could be &quot;more vivid, more &quot;real&quot; than those of other actors&quot;.

In 1928, Fontanne and Lunt co-starred in what for the Guild was an untypically frothy comedy, &quot;Caprice&quot;. The biographer Margot Peters calls the production a milestone in their careers for two reasons: it was the first production in which they, rather than the play, were the main draw, and it marked the start of their inseparable theatrical partnership: from then on they always appeared together. They took &quot;Caprice&quot; to London in 1930 – Lunt&#x27;s first appearance there – and won the admiration of audiences, critics, and writers including Shaw and J. B. Priestley. For the Guild in New York, Fontanne and Lunt starred in Robert Sherwood&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Reunion in Vienna&quot; which opened in November 1931 and ran throughout the season, before a nationwide tour. The two were strong believers in touring, taking many of their Broadway hits to remote locations as well as the larger American cities. They felt a double responsibility to do so: to ensure that playwrights had their works presented to as many people as possible, and to allow people outside New York to see Broadway productions.

===&quot;Design for Living&quot;===

Fontanne and Lunt had been close friends of the English actor and playwright Noël Coward since they met in New York in 1921, before any of them had achieved success in the theatre. They had resolved then that when they were famous, Coward would write a play for all three of them to star in. The Lunts&#x27; marriage was the subject of much conjecture in theatrical circles: although they were clearly devoted to each other, there were unsubstantiated but persistent rumours that Lunt was bisexual and had gay liaisons; there was also speculation that Fontanne had extramarital interests. Against this background, Coward wrote a comedy for the three of them, &quot;Design for Living&quot; (1932)&quot;,&quot; in which Fontanne&#x27;s character switches back and forth between the two men, who then pair up when she deserts them both, before all three end up together. The combination of the risqué subject and the popularity of the three stars caused box-office records to be broken, and reportedly earned Fontanne and her co-stars the highest salaries paid on Broadway to that time.

The immense success of &quot;Design for Living&quot; led Coward to write another play for his friends, but his &quot;Point Valaine,&quot; in which Fontanne and Lunt starred in 1934, was a failure. Coward set out to write an uncharacteristically serious drama, but the grim plot and unsympathetic characters did not appeal to audiences used to seeing the Lunts in glamorous and romantic roles; Fontanne&#x27;s prediction that the play would only run for a matter of weeks proved correct. It was the only outright failure of the Lunts&#x27; joint career.

=== 1934 to 1945 ===
Between the two Coward plays in New York, Fontanne and Lunt played in London, in &quot;Reunion in Vienna&quot;, repeating their American success with the piece. &quot;The Times&quot; commented:
For the rest of the 1930s Fontanne and her husband appeared in Guild productions. In 1935 they played Katherina and Petruchio in &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;; in 1936 they starred in a new Sherwood play, &quot;Idiot&#x27;s Delight&quot;; in 1937 they took the leading roles in S. N. Behrman&#x27;s adaptation of Jean Giraudoux&#x27;s comedy &quot;Amphitryon 38&quot;; and in 1938 they played Arkadina and Trigorin in &quot;The Seagull&quot; on Broadway and took the production of &quot;Amphitryon 38&quot; to London, before touring it extensively in the US in repertory with &quot;Idiot&#x27;s Delight&quot; and &quot;The Seagull&quot;.

The Lunts had a country estate in Genesee Depot, Wisconsin, close to where Lunt had grown up. It was their summer home, where they entertained a great many theatrical friends and colleagues over the decades. Carol Channing later said &quot;Genesee Depot is to performers what the Vatican is to Catholics&quot;. They gave up their usual summer break there during the latter part of the Second World War, because at Fontanne&#x27;s behest the couple moved to England. She felt she should share the hardships of her family and friends there, and from 1943 to 1945 the Lunts appeared in the West End, and in performances for the troops, including a tour of army camps in France and Germany in 1945.

===Later years and death===
After the war Fontanne and Lunt returned to the US and resumed their association with the Theatre Guild. They appeared in 1946–47 in Terence Rattigan&#x27;s comedy &quot;Love In Idleness&quot; (given on Broadway under the title &quot;O Mistress Mine&quot;), and in 1949–50 in &quot;I Know My Love&quot;, Berhman&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Auprès de ma blonde&quot; by Marcel Achard; these productions ran for 482 and 247 performances respectively. The Lunts toured the latter throughout the US. They returned to England in 1952 for their third and final Coward premiere, &quot;Quadrille&quot;, a romantic comedy set in the 1870s. After a West End run of 329 performances they took the play to Broadway in 1954, where it ran for 159 performances; it could have profitably run for longer, but the Lunts chose to close in March 1955.

Fontanne and Lunt&#x27;s last Broadway premiere was in Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse&#x27;s &quot;melodramatic comedy&quot; &quot;The Great Sebastians&quot; in 1956. After a six-month run in New York they toured the piece throughout the US. Their final production was in 1957: &quot;The Visit&quot;, Maurice Valency&#x27;s adaptation of Friedrich Dürrenmatt&#x27;s &quot;Der Besuch der alten Dame&quot;, in which a rich old woman exacts a terrible revenge on the man who betrayed her fifty years earlier. They toured the play in Britain in 1957–58, initially under the title &quot;Time and Again&quot;, in a production directed by Peter Brook. In May 1958 they opened the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre in New York with the same play (by then renamed &quot;The Visit&quot;) and toured it in the US. In June 1960, in Brook&#x27;s production, they opened the new Royalty Theatre, London in June 1960, running until 19 October. After a final week playing the piece at the Golders Green Hippodrome in November they retired from the stage.

Lunt died on 3 August 1977. Fontanne died at Genesee Depot on 30 July 1983, aged 95, from pneumonia, and was interred next to her husband at Forest Home Cemetery in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

==Cinema and broadcasting==
Fontanne, like her husband, disliked acting for the camera and she made only four films. She appeared in the silent films &quot;Second Youth&quot; (1924) and &quot;The Man Who Found Himself&quot; (1925). For &quot;The Guardsman&quot; (1931) she and Lunt were both nominated for Academy Awards. She and Lunt were in &quot;Stage Door Canteen&quot; (1943) in which they had cameos as themselves. The two starred in four television productions in the 1950s and 1960s with both Lunt and Fontanne winning Emmy Awards in 1965 for &quot;The Magnificent Yankee&quot;. She narrated a 1960 television production of &quot;Peter Pan&quot; starring Mary Martin and received a second Emmy nomination for playing Grand Duchess Marie in the Hallmark Hall of Fame telecast of &quot;Anastasia&quot; in 1967, two of the few productions in which she appeared without her husband. The Lunts also starred in several radio dramas in the 1940s, notably on the Theatre Guild programme. Many of these broadcasts still survive.

==Honours==
In September 1964 Lunt and Fontanne were presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Lyndon Johnson at a White House ceremony. Like Lunt, Fontanne was a member of the American Theater Hall of Fame. She received a Kennedy Center Honor for the Performing Arts in 1980. She received no official British honour, which was a matter of mild regret as she would have liked to be Dame Lynn Fontanne: &quot;They thought I was American. But I was always British. I would have cherished the award&quot;. When she was 90 she received a standing ovation when she attended a performance of &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre.

<doc id="177780" wikidata="Q1247693" url="?curid=177780" title="Laverne &amp; Shirley">
<text>Laverne &amp; Shirley is an American television sitcom that ran for eight seasons on ABC from January 27, 1976, to May 10, 1983. A spin-off of &quot;Happy Days&quot;, &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; stars Penny Marshall and Cindy Williams as Laverne DeFazio and Shirley Feeney, two friends and roommates who work as bottle-cappers in the fictitious Shotz Brewery in late 1950s to early 1960s Milwaukee, Wisconsin. From the sixth season onwards, the series&#x27; setting changed to mid-1960s Burbank, California.

Michael McKean and David Lander co-star as their friends and neighbors Lenny Kosnowski and Andrew &quot;Squiggy&quot; Squiggman, respectively; along with Eddie Mekka as Carmine Ragusa, Phil Foster as Laverne&#x27;s father Frank DeFazio, and Betty Garrett as the girls&#x27; landlady Edna Babish.

Featuring regular physical comedy, &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; became the most-watched American television program by its third and fourth season. It received six Golden Globe nominations and one Emmy nomination.

==History==
The series is a spin-off of &quot;Happy Days&quot;, as the two lead characters were introduced on that series as acquaintances of Fonzie (Henry Winkler). The original working title was &quot;Laverne DeFazio &amp; Shirley Feeney&quot;. The characters were originally &quot;two girls who date the fleet&quot;, but for family hour, they had to be changed and mellowed down, which, in Cindy Williams&#x27; opinion, gave the show more depth. Set in roughly the same period, the timeline started in approximately 1958, when the series began, through 1967, when the series ended. As with &quot;Happy Days&quot;, it was produced by Paramount Television, created by Garry Marshall (along with Lowell Ganz and Mark Rothman) and executive produced by Garry Marshall, Edward K. Milkis, and Thomas L. Miller from Miller-Boyett Productions.

According to former Disney CEO Michael Eisner, Cindy Williams had refused to do the &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; spin-off, so her role was recast with Liberty Williams (no relation), and a seven-minute screen test was filmed. Between that afternoon shoot and the evening, Cindy Williams was eventually talked into doing the role and she re-filmed the scene that night with Penny Marshall, who became her co-star in the series. Executives wanted to see both versions, but Eisner hid the first reel of film in a closet of the building and said at the screening that the film from the first shoot had gotten lost, so they only watched the performance of Cindy Williams with Penny Marshall.&lt;ref name=&quot;televisionacademy/interviews/michael-eisner&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

===Seasons 1–5===
In the opening credits, Laverne and Shirley recite &quot;1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 Schlemiel! Schlimazel! Hasenpfeffer Incorporated,&quot; a Yiddish-American hopscotch chant, which then leads into the series&#x27; theme song, &quot;Making Our Dreams Come True&quot; performed by Cyndi Grecco. In the final season without Cindy Williams, the chant is recited by a group of schoolchildren. The hopscotch chant is from Penny Marshall&#x27;s childhood.
For the first five seasons, from 1976 to 1980, the show was set in Milwaukee (executive producer Thomas L. Miller&#x27;s home town), taking place from roughly 1958–59 through the early 1960s. Shotz Brewery bottle cappers and best friends, Laverne DeFazio and Shirley Feeney live in a basement apartment, where they communicate with upstairs neighbors Lenny and Squiggy by screaming up the dumbwaiter shaft connecting their apartments. Also included in the show are Laverne&#x27;s father, Frank DeFazio, proprietor of the Pizza Bowl, and Edna Babish, the apartment building&#x27;s landlady, who later married Frank. Shirley maintained an off-again on-again romance with dancer/singer/boxer Carmine &quot;The Big Ragu&quot; Ragusa. During this period, characters from &quot;Happy Days&quot; and &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; made occasional guest appearances on each other&#x27;s series.
Michael McKean and David Lander created the characters of Lenny and Squiggy while both were theater students at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Lander told an interviewer in 2006 that they created the characters while high on marijuana. After graduating, they continued to perform the characters in live comedy routines before joining the show&#x27;s cast.

During the fifth season, the girls went into the Army Reserve, and they contended with a tough-as-nails drill sergeant named Alvinia T. &quot;The Frog&quot; Plout (Vicki Lawrence). While their time in the Army Reserve was brief in the live action series, it did inspire an animated series with the duo in the army contending with their immediate superior, a commanding pig named Sgt. Squealy who was voiced by Ron Palillo (best known for his role as Arnold Horshack on &quot;Welcome Back, Kotter&quot;) who is always threatening to report them to Sgt. Turnbuckle (voiced by Kenneth Mars).

===Seasons 6–8===

For the sixth season in 1980, Laverne and Shirley and their friends all moved from Milwaukee to Burbank, California. Laverne and Shirley took jobs at Bardwell&#x27;s department store as gift wrappers. Frank and Edna managed a Texas barbecue restaurant called Cowboy Bill&#x27;s, Carmine delivered singing telegrams and sought work as an actor, and Lenny and Squiggy started a talent agency called Squignowski Talent Agency. From this point until the end of the series&#x27; run, &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; was set in the mid-1960s. In one of the shots in the show&#x27;s new opening sequence, the ladies are seen kissing a 1964 poster of the Beatles. With each season, a new year passed in the timeline of the show, starting with 1965 in the 1980–81 season, and ending in 1967 with Carmine heading off for Broadway to star in the musical &quot;Hair&quot;. When the series&#x27; setting changed to California, two new characters are added: Sonny St. Jacques, a stunt man, landlord of the Burbank apartment building and love interest for Laverne; as well as Rhonda Lee, the ladies&#x27; neighbor and an aspiring actress.

In March 1982, Cindy Williams became pregnant with her first child. In August, two episodes into production of the series&#x27; eighth season, Williams left the show and filed a $20 million lawsuit against Paramount after they demanded Williams work on her scheduled due date. The case was later settled out of court and Williams was released from her contract.

The series&#x27; final season continued with two episodes with Williams still playing Shirley; then it was just Marshall as Laverne, who now worked for an aerospace company. Despite the absence of Williams and her character, the series&#x27; title remained unchanged. Ratings dipped but were strong enough for the show to be considered for a ninth season. Marshall agreed based on the condition that the show would move production to New York City. Faced with the high cost of such an endeavor, ABC opted not to renew the series and it was removed from the schedule in May 1983.

==Characters==
===Main===

* Laverne Marie DeFazio (Penny Marshall) is known for being a tough-talking tomboy. She grew up in Brooklyn, with her Italian immigrant parents. Laverne&#x27;s parents moved to Milwaukee, where her mother died. Laverne works alongside best friend and roommate Shirley. Milk and Pepsi is Laverne&#x27;s favorite drink. Her trademark is the script letter &quot;L&quot; monogrammed on her shirts and sweaters, an idea Marshall got from seeing a vintage sweater in the wardrobe department with an initial sewn in the upper left corner, something that would help the audience remember that she is Laverne. She is the only character to appear in all 178 episodes of the series.
* Shirley Wilhelmina Feeney (Cindy Williams) is the perky, positive one. She also tends to be meek, while Laverne is more outspoken. She later becomes a huge fan of teen-idol Fabian. Her overbearing mother Lily (Pat Carroll) expects more from Shirley than she can give. Shirley is sensitive and tends to overreact. When she tries to hold back a laugh, she bites her knuckle on her index finger. Shirley works at Shotz brewery with Laverne. She has a special relationship with her stuffed cat, Boo Boo Kitty, a name Williams gave the toy after forgetting a line in rehearsal, and was the name of her mother&#x27;s cat.
* Leonard &quot;Lenny&quot; Kosnowski (Michael McKean) is a lovable goofball greaser who pesters Laverne and Shirley, along with his best friend and roommate Squiggy, both of whom live upstairs from Laverne and Shirley&#x27;s lower-level apartment. Lenny works as a truck driver at the Shotz brewery. Lenny says that, while he is not completely sure, he thinks his last name is Polish for &quot;Help, there&#x27;s a hog in my kitchen&quot;. McKean&#x27;s role was shortened in the eighth season due to his filming &quot;This is Spinal Tap&quot;. He appeared in only five episodes, credited as a guest star. As of 2024, McKean is the only surviving original cast member.
* Andrew &quot;Squiggy&quot; Squiggman (David Lander) works and lives with childhood friend Lenny. Squiggy, who is a greaser like Lenny, makes nearly every entrance (as a running gag, they usually enter just as Laverne and/or Shirley are describing something unpleasant) with his trademark &quot;Hello&quot; said in a comically dopey voice. In the final season, Squiggy&#x27;s lookalike sister Squendoline is introduced. Originally created by Lander and McKean as Anthony Squiggliano, the character&#x27;s name was changed to German because the producers believed there were already too many Italians in the show.
* Carmine Ragusa (Eddie Mekka) is Shirley&#x27;s high-school sweetheart and on-again, off-again romance. &quot;The Big Ragu&quot; is a part-time boxer and former Golden Gloves champion who owns a dance studio and is constantly working to make it big as a dancer and singer. In the final episode of the series, he auditions for the musical &quot;Hair&quot;, at last landing a major role on Broadway.
* Fabrizio &quot;Frank&quot; DeFazio (Phil Foster) is Laverne&#x27;s father who runs the Pizza Bowl, a local hang out. In season six, he opens up Cowboy Bill&#x27;s in Burbank, California. Although he can be harsh and lose his temper sometimes, he has a heart of gold. He loves Laverne very much, having been her only parent for years. His pet name for his daughter is &quot;Muffin&quot;. Frank is also protective of Shirley, becoming somewhat of a surrogate father to her since her family was far away.
* Edna Babish DeFazio (Betty Garrett, seasons 2–6) is the five-time-divorced landlady who eventually marries Laverne&#x27;s father. In season 2, she was dressed quite plainly, and Garrett&#x27;s then-long hair was put under a more conservative wig, but in the third season, a new wardrobe worker suggested that she should be more &quot;jazzy&quot;, with her real hair and colorful costumes, and this change fleshed out the character. Edna occasionally sings and dances in the local brewery talent shows. When the series was extended beyond the intended final season, Garrett had already committed to another project necessitating Edna be written out as having left Frank. 
* Rhonda Lee (Leslie Easterbrook, seasons 6–8) is a tall, voluptuous, somewhat ditzy blonde actress/singer/dancer/model trying to get discovered and make it big in Hollywood. She is Laverne and Shirley&#x27;s neighbor and a regular character after they move to Burbank. Rhonda, who also comes off as rather narcissistic about her good looks and self-obsessed, always refers to herself in the third person, by her first name. Rhonda often bursts into Laverne and Shirley&#x27;s apartment (occasionally at inopportune times, much like Lenny and Squiggy often do) to borrow things without really asking and to brag about her social engagements or romantic dates with desirable men with the intention of making the girls envious.
* Sonny St. Jacques (Ed Marinaro, season 6) is a stuntman and Laverne and Shirley&#x27;s landlord in Burbank. A tall, handsome, muscular man, Sonny is often seen with his shirt off or open. He was intended as a love interest for Laverne. After several episodes in Burbank, Sonny was written out of the show and rarely, if ever, mentioned again. (In reality, Marinaro left the series to star in &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;.)

====Notes====
===Recurring===

* (Big) Rosie Greenbaum (Carole Ita White) is Laverne and Shirley&#x27;s childhood nemesis. She married a rich doctor and rubs this in the ladies&#x27; faces, though they make fun of the fact that he is a proctologist. She is Laverne&#x27;s rival and upsets her by calling her a &quot;bimbo&quot;. Big Rosie and fellow Milwaukee classmate Terri Buttefuco both return in the season-seven episode &quot;Class of &#x27;56&quot;.
* Terri Buttefuco (Judy Pioli) is a former classmate of Laverne and Shirley. She is tough and athletic and has a better relationship with Laverne and Shirley than they do with Rosie Greenbaum. Pioli also wrote and acted as a script consultant for the series. 
* Sgt. Alvinia T. Plout (Vicki Lawrence) is a tough-as-nails drill sergeant Laverne and Shirley met when they went into the Army, who&#x27;s known on the base as &quot;The Frog&quot;. She returns in Season 6 having gone AWOL from the Army after falling in love with a four-star general who jilted her.
* Officer Norman Hughes (Bo Kaprall) is a police officer and love interest for Laverne. 
* Mr. Hildebrand (Norman Bartold) is Laverne and Shirley&#x27;s boss at Bardwell&#x27;s Department Store.
* Mrs. Kolchek (Rose Mitchum) is a neighbor living in Laverne and Shirley&#x27;s Milwaukee apartment building and appeared in 5 episodes from 1977 to 1980. She rarely has speaking roles, but when she does speak, she only speaks to Laverne, as she is annoyed at Shirley for always yelling at her because Shirley thinks she is very hard of hearing, which she isn&#x27;t, and because she is also interested in Carmine in spite of their age differences.
* Chuck (Charles Fleischer) is Laverne&#x27;s co-worker in season 8.

==Episodes==

==Broadcast history and ratings==
&quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; debuted in the 1975–76 TV season, with its first episode airing in January 1976, in the Tuesday night time slot after &quot;Happy Days&quot;. By its third season, it had become the most-watched American television program according to Nielsen ratings. In August 1979, before the start of its fifth season, &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; was moved to Thursdays at 8 pm opposite &quot;The Waltons&quot; on CBS and &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot; on NBC. By the end of the fifth season, ratings fell sharply and the sitcom failed to make the list of the top 30 programs. In an effort to improve the show&#x27;s ratings, ABC moved &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; to Mondays at 8 p.m. in December 1979. The ratings fared no better, so in February 1980 the network moved the series back to its familiar Tuesday-night berth, where it remained for the next three years. Between 1980 and 1982, the ratings improved considerably, but, despite having regained its original time slot and changing its format, &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; never regained the popularity it had attained during its first four years on the air, and during its final season struggled against &quot;The A-Team&quot; on NBC. By the time of its cancellation in 1983, the series ranked at number 25 for the season. The show aired in reruns on ABC daytime from April 1979 to June 1980.

==Animated spin-off==

During the run of the main show, an animated spin-off also called &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; began airing on Saturday mornings. The first program was aired on October 10, 1981, and features the voices of Marshall and Williams playing Laverne and Shirley in the Army with a talking pig drill sergeant named &quot;Squealy&quot; (voiced by Ron Palillo). The show was retitled &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley with Special Guest Star The Fonz&quot; when the Fonz began working in the motorpool as the chief mechanic, and then again retitled &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy/Laverne &amp; Shirley/Fonz Hour&quot; when new segments involving a teenaged Mork &amp; Mindy were added to the mix. The series ran until September 3, 1983.

==Merchandise==
The program was so successful at the time that it spawned a merchandise franchise. Mego released two models of Laverne and Shirley dolls, and one model of Lenny and Squiggy dolls. Matchbox created a Shotz Brewery delivery van, and several novelty toys were sold such as Halloween costumes, a board game, jigsaw puzzles, coloring books, video slot machine and other toys.

==Home media==
Paramount Home Entertainment and (starting with season 2) CBS DVD have released the entire series of &quot;Laverne and Shirley&quot; on DVD in Region 1, albeit with music substitutions and scene deletions.

On June 16, 2015, CBS DVD released &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley – The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1.

Season 1 has also been released on DVD in Region 2.

The first three seasons have been released on DVD in Region 4 by Paramount.


===Music===

The theme song from the series (&quot;Making Our Dreams Come True&quot; as performed by Cyndi Grecco) was released as a single from Cyndi&#x27;s LP by the same name and became a radio favorite, becoming a top-30 American hit in 1976.

In 1976, Penny Marshall and Cindy Williams released an album, performed in character, titled &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley Sing&quot;, which contained some original songs along with some 1950s and 1960s standards. The album was originally released on Atlantic Records. On November 11, 2003, Collector&#x27;s Choice released it on CD. The single &quot;Sixteen Reasons&quot; reached #72 in Canada.

In 1979, Michael McKean and David Lander followed suit with the album &quot;Lenny and the Squigtones&quot;, also performed in character, featuring original songs (and some spoken material) penned by McKean and Lander. The album was released on Casablanca Records.

In July 1979, McKean and Lander also appeared together (in character) on &quot;American Bandstand&quot; performing the song &quot;King of the Cars&quot;, the single released from their &quot;Lenny and the Squigtones&quot; album. They also performed &quot;Love Is a Terrible Thing&quot;, another song from the album.

In 1980, Romina Power (of Al Bano and Romina Power fame) recorded a separate theme tune for the show when it was introduced to the Italian market. The track, simply titled &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;, featured verses in English and Italian. Released as a single in the same year, the track failed to chart.

<doc id="177782" wikidata="Q986383" url="?curid=177782" title="Tuen Mun District">
<text>The Tuen Mun District is one of 18 administrative districts of Hong Kong. As of 2021, it had a population of 506,879. Of these people, 64,000 are under the age of 18. Part of the district is the Tuen Mun New Town (or simply Tuen Mun), which contains one of the largest residential areas in the New Territories. 
==History==
===Etymology===
Tuen Mun, (), rumoured to be short for , literally means &quot;the door to the garrison.&quot; Other interpretations of the name include , which means &quot;opening of the water route.&quot; The district was named after the area.

===Before the establishment of the district===
According to the &quot;Old History Book of Tang Dynasty&quot; (), and the &quot;New History Book of Tang Dynasty&quot; () Tuen Mun was a major trading port, and there were garrisons as early as the Tang dynasty (A.D. 618–907). The geological features described by the historical literature match that of modern day Tuen Mun. However, some scholars also dispute the interpretation of the location of Tuen Mun. They suggest the historic Tuen Mun may refer to the Nantou in the modern day Shenzhen (historically the residual part of the Xin&#x27;an County) instead. One scholar, Lau Chi-pang, rebutted this interpretation in an article he wrote.

The area around Tuen Mun, excluding Tai Lam and Lung Kwu Tan, was placed under the Yuen Long &quot;yeuk&quot; () soon after the signing of the Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory in 1898. The convention leased the New Territories and New Kowloon to the British Empire as an extension of the Colony of Hong Kong. Before the lease, Tuen Mun was part of the Xin&#x27;an County. In the &quot;Xin&#x27;an Xianzhi&quot; (literally &quot;Gazetteer of the Xin&#x27;an County&quot;) Kangxi edition, Tuen Mun village was under the administration of &quot;Wu-dou&quot; (). Also under &quot;Wu-dou&quot;, were Kam Tin, Ping Shan, Yuen Long and Shek Kong. They were areas of the modern day Yuen Long District.

Soon after, the District Office North (Northern District, not to be confused with the modern-day Northern District) was established to administer the New Territories including Tuen Mun. After World War II, the Yuen Long District Office was spun off from the District Office North.

Tuen Mun and its surrounding area were administratively part of Yuen Long District Office until 1974. (an author stated Tuen Mun (branch-) office was &quot;established after 1969&quot;)

While originally named Castle Peak New Town during its planning, the new town of the area was finally named Tuen Mun New Town, adopting the historic name of the region in 1972. The new town was built on reclaimed land from the Castle Peak Bay, as well as levelled hillside areas, starting from the 1960s.

The New Town also incorporated Tuen Mun San Hui, a rural market township, as part of the New Town&#x27;s town centre.

===Establishment to present===
Tuen Mun District Office, part of the New Territories Administration, was established in 1974. In 1982, the Tuen Mun District Council (at first known as Tuen Mun District Board) was established as part of the political reform of the district-level government.

The Tuen Mun District included the (New) Town of the same name, Tuen Mun as well as other areas and villages. In the 2010s, the government announced the construction of another new satellite town in Hung Shui Kiu, an area that consists of several villages and administrations spanning between Tuen Mun and Yuen Long Districts.
==Public affairs==
Tuen Mun District Council is one of the 18 district councils of Hong Kong. The Council consists of 37 members with 29 of those elected through a first-past the post system every four years and 1 ex officio member and the remaining members appointed by the chief executive of Hong Kong at the start of a term. The latest election was held in 2019.

==Tourist attractions==
===Tuen Mun Town Centre===
Tuen Mun Town Centre is the main area of the district. It features a range of cultural and entertainment facilities and several government buildings, including Tuen Mun Town Plaza, Tuen Mun Cultural Square, Tuen Mun Town Hall, Tuen Mun Public Library, Tuen Mun Park, Tuen Mun Law Courts, Tuen Mun Central Post Office and Tuen Mun Government Offices.

===Lung Kwu Tan===

Lung Kwu Tan Village has a history of a couple hundred years. It is located at the southwest of Castle Peak and consists of Lung Kwu Tan and Lung Kwu Sheung Tan. It is said that Emperor Bing of Song went south as far as Lung Kwu Tan when he fled from the invading Mongols. There is a cave at Lung Kwu Tan known as the Emperor&#x27;s Cave, which is presumably where Emperor Bing took refuge during his stay. Other famous spots include the Tin Hau Temple and the Bogy&#x27;s Rock. While Lung Kwu Tan is a place of primitive simplicity, the opening of privately run barbecue sites have always drawn crowds of tourists.

===Dragon Boat Racing===
Every year at Tuen Ng Festival (), which is the fifth day of the fifth lunar month, there is dragon boat racing at Castle Peak Bay. The venue is one of the several places where this international cultural and sports event takes place. Every year many people from different companies or organisations join the competition. The event also attracts crowds to watch the race.

===Reptile House===
Located in Tuen Mun Park, the Reptile House is home to 29 species of reptiles. It opened in 1999 and is operated by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department.

===Tsing Chuen Wai===

Tsing Chuen Wai is situated in the northern part of Tuen Mun near Lam Tei Tsuen. Tsing Chuen Wai used to be known as Mak Yuen Wai (i.e. Wheat Field Walled Village). Its present name came from the fact that the village was surrounded by its protective walls made of green bricks. Tsing Chuen Wai is mainly populated by the To Clan. The only surviving portion of the original green-brick boundary wall at the main entrance of the Wai contrasts with the newly constructed archway.

===Tuen Mun Public Riding School===
Opened in 1994, Tuen Mun Public Riding School is located at Lung Mun Road and adjacent to Tuen Mun Ferry Pier. The school, which occupies an area of 3.58 hectares, is the largest public riding school in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Jockey Club, which contributed $50 million for the construction of the school, is also the management agent. The school is well equipped with three paddocks for riding practice, covering a total area of 8,150 square metres. Apart from riding training, the school also organises activities for families.

Take LRT route No. 610, 615 or 615P and alight at Butterfly stop, or KMB route No. 59A or 59M, or Citybus route No. 962.

===Hong Kong Gold Coast===

Hong Kong&#x27;s Gold Coast is the largest tourist resort in Tuen Mun.

===Hung Lau===

Hung Lau is located in Chung Shan Park at Lung Mun Road and adjacent to Castle Peak Farm. Hung Lau faces southeast with Pui To Peak at its back, overlooking the sea off Tuen Mun and facing Lantau Island further across it. The area near the present Butterfly Estate was uninhabited in the late Qing dynasty and was accessible by water transport only. Legends state that Hung Lau became a base for the revolutionaries of the Revive China Society. It was said that secret meetings convened by Dr. Sun Yat-sen and other revolutionaries for planning the Huang Hua-Gang Uprising and the Huizhou Uprising took place at Hung Lau. It was also where they took oath and got their ammunition and food supplies. Thus, Hung Lau has been of great significance to the Nationalist Revolution. A monument to Dr. Sun, a bust of him, a reproduction of his will and a gomuti palm tree planted by the revolutionary martyrs can also be found in Chung Shan Park.

==Places of worship==

===Ching Leung Nunnery===
Situated at Fu Tei, Ching Leung Nunnery was built more than a hundred years ago during the reign of Guang Xu of the Qing dynasty. Lying in its serenity, the Nunnery was initially known as the Garden of Sweet-scented Osmanthus because this species was seen almost everywhere in the area. It was later renamed Ching Leung Nunnery. The Nunnery is famous for its quality vegetarian food. Coupled also with a tearoom, it is a must-go for gourmet visitors to savour vegetarian meals and Chinese tea.
Besides the pavilions and ponds commonly found in most Buddhist retreats and monasteries, there is also a rubbing of the Sixteen Arhats hanging in the worship hall. It is a rubbing of the stone carving that Emperor Qian Long of the Qing dynasty found himself enjoying during his visit to the Sheng Yin Temple in Hangzhou.

===Tsing Shan Monastery===

The Tsing Shan Monastery (青山禪院) nestles at the foot of Castle Peak. There are the Pui To Cave, Tsing Wan Koon and Tsing Shan Temple. These historical monuments, characterised by their simplicity and solemnity, have stood through the ages on the wooded hill in the secluded and scenic surroundings. Upon entering the Monastery, visitors will see the Chinese characters &quot;香海名山&quot; (Fragrant Sea and Prestigious Hill) engraved on the archway. It is an inscription by the then Governor Sir Cecil Clementi. On the other side of the archway are the characters &quot;回頭是岸&quot; (Turn Back and There is the Shore, meaning Repentance is Salvation), an inscription by Master Tit Xim. Both the surroundings and the inscriptions naturally inspire nostalgic thoughts of the Monastery&#x27;s unique past. Originating from Shiwan, the ridge tile of the archway is an exquisite art.
Legend has it that an accomplished Indian Buddhist monk who liked roaming around in a big wooden cup eventually came to Castle Peak. Attracted by the favourable environment for spiritual nurturing, he built a cottage there for practising his religion. Since then, the name of Master Pui To (meaning Traveling in a Cup) has become widely known. In memory of him, his followers made an altar out of a flat rock inside the Cave, and behind the altar a statue of him. However, other legends say the Pui To Cave was built in the Jin dynasty and redeveloped in the Song dynasty. Subsequent maintenance from time to time managed to preserve the relic to this day.
Adjacent to the Mahavira Hall is Ching Wan Koon (青雲觀), which is dedicated to Dou Lao, a Goddess who is believed to be able to free people from their worries.
Tsing Shan Temple is the leading one among the three major ancient temples in Hong Kong. There is the Mahavira Hall in the Temple. Up on the stone steps leading to the Hall are inscribed &quot;一切有情、同登覺地&quot; (May All Sentient Beings Attained Nirvana Together), which speaks of the appealing Buddhist path of Ultimate Liberation.

===Miu Fat Buddhist Monastery===
Based on the principle of practising compassion, Miu Fat Buddhist Monastery (妙法寺), in Lam Tei, has been actively organising activities to promote Buddhism as well as education, culture, charity and welfare for years.
The Miu Fat Buddhist Monastery was first constructed in 1950. Over the following two decades came the construction of the 3-storey Ten Thousand Buddhas Hall at a cost of $60 million. It took six years to complete, with its consecration ceremony held in May 1980. The Mahavira Hall, located on the top storey, has a floor height of about 20 metres. In the middle of the Hall, there are three gold-plated statues of the Buddha Sakyamuni, each of them is about 5 metres tall. Its interior walls are adorned with over 10 thousands of Buddha reliefs and a number of murals featuring a blend of Sino-Thai cultures, which are so magnificent and eye-catching. Higher up in the Hall are the Library of Buddhist Scriptures and the Attic of the Jade Buddha. On each side of the main entrance of the Hall is a 20-metre column carved with a dazzling lifelike giant gold-scaled dragon, making the building prominently imposing. The Monastery also has a kitchen serving mouthwatering vegetarian food for visitors.
Adjoining the existing Ten Thousand Buddha Pagoda, the 45-metre-high and 7-storey main complex of Miu Fat Buddhist Monastery has been built since 1999. It comprises a Buddhist shrine, a community hall, a library and cultural/welfare facilities. The complex is meticulously designed with Lotus Shrine on the top floor resembling a gigantic crystal lotus blossom viewed from afar. A ceremony was held in mid-March in 2010 to mark the completion of this electricity-saving and trendy Shrine. The lookout of the Shrine overlooks the landscape of Tuen Mun rural area.

===Hau Kok Tin Hau Temple===

Hau Kok Tin Hau Temple (后角天后廟) is located in Tin Hau Road, next to Tuen Mun station on West Rail line.
Being a hub of waterway transport, Tuen Mun attracted fishermen communities in ancient times. The fishermen wished to enjoy the protection and blessings of the Heavenly Empress, Goddess Tin Hau and built a temple at Hau Kok in Kau Hui to worship Tin Hau and pray for safety. During the Ming dynasty, the To clansmen, who were engaged in the salt business, migrated to Tuen Mun. They developed close ties with local fishermen and worked together for the expansion of the Temple. People living in the walled villages also helped in financing its renovation on a number of occasions. The Temple has always been well patronised by worshippers. During the Tin Hau Festival (i.e. the 23rd day of the third month in the Chinese calendar) every year, villagers and fishermen hold a series of celebrations in the open space in front of the temple. They pray for prosperity and peace by staging thanksgiving opera performances as well as dragon and lion dances. Every year, Lunar New Year fair will be organised in the square in front of Tin Hau Temple. Besides, it is also a place for earthen pot gathering.

All types of modern psychiatric treatment work are available in hospital, including the use of drugs and other physical methods of treatment, and psychological and social treatment. Multi-disciplinary teamwork is emphasised in the provision of treatment and care for patients. The recent trend is to put emphasis not only on hospital treatment, but also on community psychiatric care.

Altogether there are 16 male wards and 11 female wards and 3 mixed sex wards. Patients of open wards can walk about freely within the hospital compound.

<text>Morning Glory is a 1933 American Pre-Code drama film which tells the story of an eager would-be actress and her journey to stardom, and her gains and losses. The picture stars Katharine Hepburn, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., and Adolphe Menjou, was adapted by Howard J. Green from a then-unproduced stage play of the same name by Zoë Akins, and was directed by Lowell Sherman. Hepburn won her first Academy Award for Best Actress. &quot;Morning Glory&quot; was remade in 1958 under the title &quot;Stage Struck&quot;.

==Plot==
Eva Lovelace is an aspiring performer from a small town who dreams of making it big on Broadway. Despite attending numerous auditions, she hasn&#x27;t been given an opportunity yet. At the management office of the Easton Theatre, star actress Rita Vernon, known for her diva behavior and alcohol problem, negotiates a deal with the theater owner and producer, Louis Easton. Rita accepts a small role in an upcoming play in exchange for her pick of roles in the next production. Eva impresses Robert Hedges, an experienced actor, who agrees to help her. Playwright Joseph Sheridan is also captivated by Eva&#x27;s vibrant personality. Months pass, and Eva struggles to find significant roles while moving frequently due to financial difficulties.

Hedges eventually finds Eva in a desperate situation and takes her to a celebrity party at Easton&#x27;s apartment. Inebriated, Eva makes a scene, but surprises everyone by delivering powerful Shakespearean monologues. She falls asleep and is put to bed by Easton&#x27;s butler. The next morning, Easton, feeling guilty for taking advantage of Eva&#x27;s innocence, confides in Sheridan and asks for his help. Sheridan, who is secretly in love with Eva, decides not to reveal the truth to her, causing her to leave with the belief that her night with Easton marks the start of a committed relationship.

Months go by, and Eva repeatedly tries to see Easton, who ignores her. Sheridan keeps his feelings hidden as well. Easton&#x27;s theater company prepares to showcase Sheridan&#x27;s new play, with Rita as the star. On opening night, Rita demands a written contract with a huge salary increase and half the profits from the play. Feeling cornered, Easton considers complying, but Sheridan suggests bringing in Eva as a surprise understudy instead. Reluctantly, Easton agrees, leading to Rita storming off the set.

In Rita&#x27;s dressing room, Eva and Sheridan find themselves together. Overwhelmed by the sudden opportunity, Eva is filled with doubt and fear. She feels unable to perform in front of Easton, and questions her own talents and inevitable failure. Sheridan reassures her, reminding her of her strength, beauty, and natural acting abilities. Encouraged by his words, Eva regains her confidence and decides to embrace the role.

As predicted by Sheridan, Eva&#x27;s performance is a resounding success. Backstage, Easton reconciles with Eva, offering her his professional friendship and support. After Easton leaves, Sheridan musters the courage to confess his love for Eva, but she remains silent, leaving their relationship uncertain. Left alone with her dresser, an elderly former star known as &quot;morning glory,&quot; Eva is comforted and reminded that true love is the most important thing in life, as her dresser once made the mistake of choosing fame over love.

Renewed and ready to face the challenges ahead, Eva prepares herself for the rocky road to stardom. The film ends on an optimistic note, with Eva confidently declaring to her dresser that she is unafraid to be a &quot;morning glory.&quot;

==Production==
In pre-production, the script had been tailored to fit the talents of Constance Bennett, then RKO&#x27;s biggest attraction. However, when newcomer Katharine Hepburn read the script, she convinced producer Pandro S. Berman that she was born to play the part, and she was given the role over the more popular Bennett, who was thereupon reassigned to &quot;Bed of Roses&quot; (1933).

When RKO bought the rights to the play from Zoë Akins, it still hadn&#x27;t been produced on stage. It eventually saw a limited stage run in 1939. The director Lowell Sherman managed to get the RKO bosses to agree that he was given a week of rehearsal with the actors before the shooting began, in return for promising a shooting schedule of only 18 days (April 21 - May 12, 1933). Unlike most feature films, &quot;Morning Glory&quot; was shot in the same sequence as the script. Katharine Hepburn was paid $2,500 per week for her work on the picture, for which she eventually won her first Academy Award for Best Actress.

==Box office==
After cinema circuits deducted their exhibition share of box office tickets, this film earned a profit of $115,000.

==Radio adaptations==
On September 19, 1938 &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; broadcast a one-hour radio adaptation of the film, starring Barbara Stanwyck, Melvyn Douglas and Ralph Bellamy. On October 12, 1942 a second &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; adaptation was aired, this time starring Judy Garland as Eva Lovelace, with Adolphe Menjou reprising his role of Louis Easton. Garland performed the song &quot;I&#x27;ll Remember April&quot; on the broadcast.

On April 7, 1949 a half-hour radio adaptation was aired on &quot;Hallmark Playhouse&quot; with Elizabeth Taylor in the lead role of Eva Lovelace.

<text>Jakarta XML Registries (JAXR; formerly Java API for XML Registries) defines a standard API for Jakarta EE applications to access and programmatically interact with various kinds of metadata registries. JAXR is one of the Java XML programming APIs. The JAXR API was developed under the Java Community Process as JSR 93.

JAXR provides a uniform and standard Java API for accessing different kinds of XML-based metadata registry. Current implementations of JAXR support ebXML Registry version 2.0, and UDDI version 2.0. More such registries could be defined in the future. JAXR provides an API for the clients to interact with XML registries and a service provider interface (SPI) for the registry providers so they can plug in their registry implementations. The JAXR API insulates application code from the underlying registry mechanism. When writing a JAXR based client to browse or populate a registry, the code does not have to change if the registry changes, for instance from UDDI to ebXML.

Jakarta XML Registries (JAXR) was removed from Jakarta EE 9.

<text>The Java Community Process (JCP), established in 1998, is a formal mechanism that enables interested parties to develop standard technical specifications for Java technology. Becoming a member of the JCP requires solid knowledge of the Java programming language, its specifications, and best practices in software development. Membership in the JCP involves a detailed review of the candidate&#x27;s profile, including an assessment by current members. Typically, professionals are invited to join the JCP based on their contributions and reputation within the Java community.

Once invited, the new member undergoes an evaluation by the JCP Executive Committee, ensuring that they can effectively contribute to the Java Specification Requests (JSRs). These formal documents describe proposed specifications and technologies to be added to the Java platform. New members are encouraged to engage actively and play a crucial role in supporting the Java community and its releases. It is essential that members possess expertise and in-depth technical knowledge, combined with strong professional experience, to significantly contribute to the growth and usage of the Java language.

Membership for organizations and commercial entities requires annual fees, but it is free for individuals. JSRs undergo formal public reviews before becoming final, and the JCP Executive Committee votes on their approval. A finalized JSR provides a reference implementation, which is a free implementation of the technology in source code form, and a Technology Compatibility Kit to verify the API specification.

The JCP itself is described by a JSR. , JSR 387 describes the current version (2.11) of the JCP.

==List of JSRs==

There are hundreds of JSRs. Some of the more visible JSRs include:

==Criticism==

The JCP&#x27;s executive board has been characterized as a &quot;rubber stamp organization&quot; since Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems (the original developer of the Java language). 

The Apache Software Foundation resigned its seat on the board in December 2010 because Oracle was unwilling to license the Technology Compatibility Kit for Apache&#x27;s version of Java.

<doc id="177792" wikidata="Q259600" url="?curid=177792" title="May Robson">
<text>Mary Jeanette Robison (19 April 1858 – 20 October 1942), known professionally as May Robson, was an Australian-born America-based actress whose career spanned 58 years, starting in 1883 when she was 25. A major stage actress of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, she is remembered for the dozens of films she appeared in during the 1930s, when she was in her 70s.

Robson was the earliest-born person, and the first Australian to be nominated for an Academy Award (for her leading role in &quot;Lady for a Day&quot; in 1933).

==Early life==

Mary Jeanette Robison was born 19 April 1858 at Moama, in the Colony of New South Wales, in what she described as &quot;the Australian bush&quot;. She was the fourth child of Julia, née Schlesinger (or Schelesinger) and Henry Robison; her siblings were Williams, James and Adelaide.

Henry Robison was born in Penrith, Cumberland, England and lived in Liverpool. He served 24 years in the foreign trade of the British Merchant Navy as a mate and a sea captain. He retired at half-pay due to his poor health and travelled with Julia Robison to Melbourne, Victoria, Australia in 1853 on the SS &quot;Great Britain&quot;. By April 1855, he was a watchmaker, jeweller, silversmith and ornamental hairworker in Melbourne. According to Robson, her parents both suffered from &quot;phthisis pulmonalis&quot;, and moved to &quot;the bush&quot; for their health. Henry bought a large brick mansion in Moama, New South Wales in August 1857 and opened the Prince of Wales Hotel. From there, he co-operated Robison &amp; Stivens, coach proprietors for the Bendigo-Moama-Deniliquin service. The hotel was Robson&#x27;s first home. Henry died in Moama Maiden&#x27;s Punt on 27 January 1860.

On 19 November 1862, Julia married Walter Moore Miller, solicitor and mayor of Albury, New South Wales, at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, Melbourne. Julia, Walter and the four children moved to Melbourne in 1866. Miller was a partner with De Courcy Ireland in the firm of Miller &amp; Ireland in Melbourne in November 1867, and until 20 January 1870, when it was mutually dissolved.

In 1870, the family moved to London. Robson attended Sacred Heart Convent School at Highgate in north London and studied languages in Brussels. She went to Paris for her examinations in French. According to her obituary, she was also educated in Australia.

==Marriages and children==
Robson ran away from home to marry her first husband, 18 year-old Charles Leveson Gore, in London. They were married on 1 November 1875 at the parish church in Camden Town, London. They traveled on the steamer SS &quot;Vaderland&quot; and arrived in New York on 17 May 1877. They purchased 380 acres of land in Fort Worth, Texas where they built a house and established a cattle ranch. According to Jan Jones, &quot;the Gores survived two years in their prairie manor house before homesickness, rural isolation, and repeated bouts of fever convinced them to sell and try their fortunes in the more settled East.&quot; They moved to New York City with little money and Robson said that Gore died shortly thereafter.

Robson supported her children by crocheting hoods and embroidery, designing dinner cards, and teaching painting. By the time she began her acting career in 1883, two of her three children had died from illnesses, leaving only Edward Hyde Leveson Gore.

Six years after beginning her stage career, Robson married Augustus Homer Brown, a police surgeon, on 29 May 1889. They were together until his death on 1 April 1920. Robson&#x27;s son, Edward Gore, was her business manager.

==Career==


On 17 September 1883, Robison became an actress in &quot;Hoop of Gold&quot; at the Brooklyn Grand Opera House stage. Her name was misspelled &quot;Robson&quot; in the billing, and she used it from that point forward &quot;for good luck&quot;. Over the next several decades, she flourished on the stage as a comedian and character actress. Her success was due partly to her affiliation with powerful manager and producer Charles Frohman and the Theatrical Syndicate. She established her own touring theatrical company in 1911.

Robson&#x27;s initial appearances in film date back as early as 1903 or 1904 with uncredited roles in Edison short film productions. She appeared as herself in a cameo in the 1915 silent film &quot;How Molly Made Good&quot;; which was probably her first feature film and starred in the 1916 silent film &quot;A Night Out&quot;, an adaptation of the play she co-wrote, &quot;The Three Lights&quot;. She picked up another film role in 1916 appearing in the Marguerite Clark version of &quot;Snow White&quot; and in 1919 made a guest appearance in the Jack Pickford &quot;In Wrong&quot;. Respected and firmly established in the theatre Robson&#x27;s fame and recognition allowed her to appear in films uncredited. As so many silent films are missing or lost, she may have appeared in many more.

In 1927, she went to Hollywood, where she began a successful film career as a senior woman often in comedic roles and nearly rivaling her long time friend Marie Dressler. Among her starring roles was in &quot;The She-Wolf&quot; (1931) as a miserly millionaire businesswoman, based on real-life miser Hetty Green.

She also starred in the final segment of the anthology film &quot;If I Had a Million&quot; (1932) as a rest-home resident who gets a new lease on life when she receives a $1,000,000 check from a dying business tycoon. She played the Queen of Hearts in &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1933), Countess Vronsky in &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; (1935), Aunt Elizabeth in &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; (1938), Aunt Polly in &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot; (1938), and a sharp-tongued Granny in &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (1937). She was top-billed as late as 1940, starring in &quot;Granny Get Your Gun&quot; at 82. Her last film was 1942&#x27;s &quot;Joan of Paris&quot;.

==Academy Award nomination==
In 1933, at age 75, Robson was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for &quot;Lady for a Day&quot;, but lost to Katharine Hepburn. Both actresses appeared in the Hepburn–Grant classic &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; (1938).

Robson was the first Australian to be nominated for an acting Oscar, and, for many years, was also the oldest performer nominated.

==Death==
Robson died in 1942 at her Beverly Hills, California, home at age 84. In its obituary, the &quot;Nevada State Journal&quot; said that she died of &quot;a combination of ailments, aggravated by neuritis and advanced age.&quot; Her remains were cremated and buried at the Flushing Cemetery in Queens, New York, next to those of her second husband, Augustus Brown.

The &quot;New York Times&quot; called Robson the &quot;dowager queen of the American screen and stage&quot;.

<text>The great chain of being is a hierarchical structure of all matter and life, thought by medieval Christianity to have been decreed by God. The chain begins with God and descends through angels, humans, animals and plants to minerals.

The great chain of being () is a concept derived from Plato, Aristotle (in his &quot;Historia Animalium&quot;), Plotinus and Proclus. Further developed during the Middle Ages, it reached full expression in early modern Neoplatonism.

== Divisions ==
The chain of being hierarchy has God at the top, above angels, which like him are entirely spirit, without material bodies, and hence unchangeable. Beneath them are humans, consisting both of spirit and matter; they change and die, and are thus essentially impermanent. Lower are animals and plants. At the bottom are the mineral materials of the earth itself; they consist only of matter. Thus, the higher the being is in the chain, the more attributes it has, including all the attributes of the beings below it. The minerals are, in the medieval mind, a possible exception to the immutability of the material beings in the chain, as alchemy promised to turn lower elements like lead into those higher up the chain, like silver or gold.

== The Great Chain ==
The Great Chain of being links God, angels, humans, animals, plants, and minerals. The links of the chain are:

=== God ===
God is the creator of all things. Many religions, such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam believe he created the entire universe and everything in it. He has spiritual attributes found in angels and humans. God has unique attributes of omnipotence, omnipresence, and omniscience. He is the model of perfection in all of creation.

=== Angelic beings ===
In the New Testament, the Epistle to the Colossians sets out a partial list: &quot;everything visible and everything invisible, Thrones, Dominations, Sovereignties, Powers – all things were created through him and for him.&quot; The Epistle to the Ephesians also lists several entities: &quot;Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come&quot;.

In the 5th and 6th centuries, Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite set out a more elaborate hierarchy, consisting of three lists, each of three types:

* Angels of presence, praising God
** Seraphim – spirits of love
** Cherubim – spirits of harmony
** Thrones – record keepers of universal laws
* Angels of government, spreading light
** Dominions – spirits of wisdom and knowledge
** Virtues – angels of movement and free will
** Powers – angels of form and space
* Angels of revelation, able to communicate with humans
** Principalities – angels of time and personality
** Archangels – powerful angels superior to ordinary angels
** Angels – governors of spirits of nature

=== Humanity ===
Humans uniquely share spiritual attributes with God and the angels above them, Love and language, and physical attributes with the animals below them, like having material bodies that experienced emotions and sensations such as lust and pain, and physical needs such as hunger and thirst.

=== Animals ===
Animals have senses, are able to move, and have physical appetites. The apex predator like the lion, could move vigorously, and has powerful senses like keen eyesight and the ability to smell their prey from a distance, while a lower order of animals might wiggle or crawl, or like oysters were sessile, attached to the sea-bed. All, however, share the senses of touch and taste.

=== Plants ===
Plants lacked sense organs and the ability to move, but they could grow and reproduce. The highest plants have important healing attributes within their leaves, buds, and flowers. 
Lower plants included fungi and mosses.

=== Minerals ===
At the bottom of the chain, minerals were unable to move, sense, grow, or reproduce. Their attributes were being solid and strong, while the gemstones possessed magic. The king of gems was the diamond.

== Natural science ==

=== From Aristotle to Linnaeus ===
The basic idea of a ranking of the world&#x27;s organisms goes back to Aristotle&#x27;s biology. In his &quot;History of Animals&quot;, where he ranked animals over plants based on their ability to move and sense, and graded the animals by their reproductive mode, live birth being &quot;higher&quot; than laying cold eggs, and possession of blood, warm-blooded mammals and birds again being &quot;higher&quot; than &quot;bloodless&quot; invertebrates.

Aristotle&#x27;s non-religious concept of higher and lower organisms was taken up by natural philosophers during the Scholastic period to form the basis of the &quot;Scala Naturae&quot;. The &quot;scala&quot; allowed for an ordering of beings, thus forming a basis for classification where each kind of mineral, plant and animal could be slotted into place. In medieval times, the great chain was seen as a God-given and unchangeable ordering. In the Northern Renaissance, the scientific focus shifted to biology; the threefold division of the chain below humans formed the basis for Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturæ&quot; from 1737, where he divided the physical components of the world into the three familiar kingdoms of minerals, plants and animals.

=== In alchemy ===
Alchemy used the great chain as the basis for its cosmology. Since all beings were linked into a chain, so that there was a fundamental unity of all matter, the transformation from one place in the chain to the next might, according to alchemical reasoning, be possible. In turn, the unit of the matter enabled alchemy to make another key assumption, the philosopher&#x27;s stone, which somehow gathered and concentrated the universal spirit found in all matter along the chain, and which &quot;ex hypothesi&quot; might enable the alchemical transformation of one substance to another, such as the base metal lead to the noble metal gold.

=== &quot;Scala Naturae&quot; in evolution ===


The set nature of species, and thus the absoluteness of creatures&#x27; places in the great chain, came into question during the 18th century. The dual nature of the chain, divided yet united, had always allowed for seeing creation as essentially one continuous whole, with the potential for overlap between the links. Radical thinkers like Jean-Baptiste Lamarck saw a progression of life forms from the simplest creatures striving towards complexity and perfection, a schema accepted by zoologists like Henri de Blainville. The very idea of an ordering of organisms, even if supposedly fixed, laid the basis for the idea of transmutation of species, whether progressive goal-directed orthogenesis or Charles Darwin&#x27;s undirected theory of evolution.

The chain of being continued to be part of metaphysics in 19th-century education, and the concept was well known. The geologist Charles Lyell used it as a metaphor in his 1851 &quot;Elements of Geology&quot; description of the geological column, where he used the term &quot;missing links&quot; about missing parts of the continuum. The term &quot;missing link&quot; later came to signify transitional fossils, particularly those bridging the gulf between man and beasts.

The idea of the great chain, as well as the derived &quot;missing link&quot;, was abandoned in early 20th-century science, as the notion of modern animals representing ancestors of other modern animals was abandoned in biology, to be replaced by an evolutionary tree supplemented by horizontal gene transfer, as well as more complex web structures. The idea of a certain sequence from lower to higher complexity and fitness is still popular, as is the idea of progress in biology.

== Political implications ==
Allenby and Garreau propose that the Catholic Church&#x27;s narrative of the great chain of being kept the peace in Europe for centuries. The very concept of rebellion simply lay outside the reality within which most people lived, for to defy the King was to defy God. King James I himself wrote, &quot;The state of monarchy is the most supreme thing upon earth: for kings are not only God&#x27;s Lieutenants upon earth, and sit upon God&#x27;s throne, but even by God himself they are called Gods.&quot;

== Adaptations and similar concepts ==
The American philosopher Ken Wilber described a &quot;Great Nest of Being&quot; which he claims to belong to a culture-independent &quot;perennial philosophy&quot; traceable across 3000 years of mystical and esoteric writings. Wilber&#x27;s system corresponds with other concepts of transpersonal psychology. In his 1977 book &quot;A Guide for the Perplexed&quot;, the economist E. F. Schumacher described a hierarchy of beings, with humans at the top able mindfully to perceive the &quot;eternal now&quot;.

<text>Diana Wynyard (born Dorothy Isobel Cox; 16 January 1906 – 13 May 1964) was an English stage and film actress.

==Life and career==
Born in Lewisham, South London, Wynyard began her career on the stage. After performing in Liverpool and London with the Liverpool Repertory Company and the Hamilton Deane Repertory Company, she performed on Broadway, appearing first in &quot;Rasputin and the Empress&quot; in 1932, with Ethel, John, and Lionel Barrymore. She appeared in the film version, beginning her brief Hollywood career.

Fox Film Corporation then borrowed her for their lavish film version of Noël Coward&#x27;s stage spectacle &quot;Cavalcade&quot; (1933). As the noble wife and mother she aged gracefully against a background of the Boer War, the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot;, the First World War, and the arrival of the Jazz Age. With this performance, she became the first British actress to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. After a handful of film roles, including playing John Barrymore&#x27;s old flame in &quot;Reunion in Vienna&quot;, she returned to Britain, but concentrated on theatre work, including roles as Charlotte Brontë in Clemence Dane&#x27;s &quot;Wild Decembers&quot;, in &quot;Sweet Aloes&quot;, and as Gilda in the British premiere of Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Design for Living&quot;.

She was tempted to return to the screen to play opposite Ralph Richardson in &quot;On the Night of the Fire&quot; (1939), a film directed by Brian Desmond Hurst. Her best remembered success was as the frightened heroine of &quot;Gaslight&quot; (1940), the first film version of Patrick Hamilton&#x27;s play &quot;Gas Light&quot;. This was followed by roles opposite Clive Brook in &quot;Freedom Radio&quot;, John Gielgud in &quot;The Prime Minister&quot; and Michael Redgrave in &quot;Kipps&quot; (all 1941), directed by Carol Reed, later her first husband.

==After World War II==

Her stage career flourished after the war, and as a Shakespearean leading lady at Stratford, in London&#x27;s West End and on tour in Australia, she had her pick of star parts. Between 1948 and 1952, she played Portia, Gertrude, Lady Macbeth, Katherine the shrew, Desdemona, Katherine of Aragon, Hermione in &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, and Beatrice to Gielgud&#x27;s Benedick in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;. In this production, she succeeded her friend Peggy Ashcroft. Wynyard stumbled off the rostrum during the sleepwalking scene in &quot;Macbeth&quot; in 1948. She fell 15 feet, but was able to continue. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s she also had success in the works of several contemporary writers, including the British production of Tennessee Williams&#x27;s &quot;Camino Real&quot;.

She appeared in Alexander Korda&#x27;s version &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; (1947), based on the Oscar Wilde play, but her remaining film appearances were in supporting roles. Usually maternal, these included &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s Schooldays&quot; (1951) and the secretive mother (of James Mason&#x27;s character) in &quot;Island in the Sun&quot; (1957). She played Empress Elisabeth of Austria in &quot;Mayerling&quot; (1957), an early American television film which starred Audrey Hepburn. In 1958 she appeared in the West End in &quot;A Touch of the Sun&quot; by N.C. Hunter.

She was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1953.

==Personal life==

She was married to the English film director Carol Reed from 3 February 1943 until August 1947, and subsequently to a Hungarian physician, Tibor Csato.

She died from renal disease in Holborn, Central London in 1964, aged 58, while rehearsing &quot;The Master Builder&quot; with Michael Redgrave and Maggie Smith as part of the new National Theatre Company. Celia Johnson replaced her.

Her last television performance was in the play &quot;The Man in the Panama Hat&quot; recorded in March 1964. Her death occurred before the intended broadcast in May 1964 and it was eventually shown posthumously on 21 September 1964.

<doc id="177799" wikidata="Q772624" url="?curid=177799" title="Diesis">
<text>In classical music from Western culture, a diesis ( or enharmonic diesis, plural dieses ( , or &quot;difference&quot;; Greek: &quot;leak&quot; or &quot;escape&quot;
is either an accidental (see sharp), or a very small musical interval, usually defined as the difference between an octave (in the ratio 2:1) and three justly tuned major thirds (tuned in the ratio 5:4), equal to 128:125 or about 41.06 cents. In 12-tone equal temperament (on a piano for example) three major thirds in a row equal an octave, but three justly-tuned major thirds fall quite a bit narrow of an octave, and the diesis describes the amount by which they are short.
For instance, an octave (2:1) spans from C to C′, and three justly tuned major thirds (5:4) span from C to B (namely, from C, to E, to G, to B). The difference between C-C′ (2:1) and C-B (125:64) is the diesis (128:125). Notice that this coincides with the interval between B and C′, also called a diminished second.

As a comma, the above-mentioned 128:125 ratio is also known as the lesser diesis, enharmonic comma, or augmented comma.

Many acoustics texts use the term greater diesis or diminished comma for the difference between an octave and four justly tuned minor thirds (tuned in the ratio 6:5), which is equal to three syntonic commas minus a schisma, equal to 648:625 or about 62.57 cents (almost one 63.16 cent step-size in 19 equal temperament). Being larger, this diesis was termed the &quot;greater&quot; while the 128:125 diesis (41.06 cents) was termed the &quot;lesser&quot;.

== Alternative definitions ==
In any tuning system, the deviation of an octave from three major thirds, however large that is, is typically referred to as a diminished second. The diminished second is an interval between pairs of enharmonically equivalent notes; for instance the interval between E and F. As mentioned above, the term &quot;diesis&quot; most commonly refers to the diminished second in quarter-comma meantone temperament. Less frequently and less strictly, the same term is also used to refer to a diminished second of any size. In third-comma meantone, the diminished second is typically denoted as a greater diesis (see below).

In quarter-comma meantone, since major thirds are justly tuned, the width of the diminished second coincides with the above-mentioned value of 128:125. Notice that 128:125 is larger than a unison (1:1). This means that, for instance, C′ is sharper than B. In other tuning systems, the diminished second has different widths, and may be smaller than a unison (e.g. C′ may be flatter than B:

In eleventh-comma meantone, the diminished second is within (0.14%) of a cent above unison, so it closely resembles the 1:1 unison ratio of twelve-tone equal temperament.

The word &quot;diesis&quot; has also been used to describe several distinct intervals, of varying sizes, but typically around 50 cents. Philolaus used it to describe the interval now usually called a &quot;limma&quot;, that of a justly tuned perfect fourth (4:3) minus two whole tones (9:8), equal to 256:243 or about 90.22 cents. Rameau (1722) names 148:125 (, &quot;recte&quot; 128:125)
as a &quot;minor diesis&quot; and 250:243 as a &quot;major diesis&quot;, explaining that the latter may be derived through multiplication of the former by the ratio .
Other theorists have used it as a name for various other small intervals.

The small diesis is or approximately 29.61 cents.

== Septimal and undecimal diesis ==
The septimal diesis (or slendro diesis) is an interval with the ratio of 49:48 , which is the difference between the septimal whole tone and the septimal minor third. It is about 35.70 cents wide.

The undecimal diesis is equal to 45:44 or about 38.91 cents, closely approximated by 31 equal temperament&#x27;s 38.71 cent half-sharp () interval.

<text>John Rhys-Davies (born 5 May 1944) is a Welsh actor best known for portraying Gimli in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy and Sallah in the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; franchise. He has received three Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, with one win, and a Primetime Emmy Award nomination.
Rhys-Davies is also known for his performances in the films &quot;Sahara&quot; (1983), &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; (1987), &quot;Glory Daze&quot; (1995), &quot;The Medallion&quot; (2003) and &quot;One Night with the King&quot; (2006). He is also known for his extensive voice work including &quot;Cats Don&#x27;t Dance&quot; (1997), &quot;&quot; (2000), &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; (2000–2002), and &quot;TripTank&quot; (2015–2016).

Rhys-Davies also gained acclaim for his television roles as Macro in &quot;I, Claudius&quot; (1976), Vasco Rodrigues in &quot;Shōgun&quot; (1980), and Michael Malone in &quot;The Untouchables&quot; (1993). From 1995 to 1997, he portrayed Professor Maximillian Arturo in &quot;Sliders&quot;.

==Early life==
John Rhys-Davies was born in Salisbury on 5 May 1944, the son of Welsh parents. His mother, Phyllis Jones, was a nurse, while his father, Rhys Davies, was a mechanical engineer and colonial officer.

Due to his father&#x27;s work as a colonial police officer, Rhys-Davies was raised in Tanganyika (today part of Tanzania) before his family moved to the Welsh town of Ammanford. While in Tanganyika, his family lived in places such as Dar es Salaam, Kongwa, Moshi, and Mwanza. Rhys-Davies was educated at independent Truro School in Cornwall and then at the University of East Anglia, where he was one of the first 105 students admitted and became a co-founder of its drama club. After a stint teaching at a secondary school in Watton, Norfolk, Rhys-Davies won a place at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London.

==Career==

Rhys-Davies appeared sporadically on UK television in the early 1970s, including his role as the gangster &quot;Laughing Spam Fritter&quot; opposite Adam Faith in &quot;Budgie&quot;. Later, Rhys-Davies played Praetorian officer Naevius Sutorius Macro in &quot;I, Claudius&quot;. He then began to appear more frequently, and not just in the UK, with roles as a Portuguese navigator Rodrigues in the 1980 television miniseries &quot;Shogun&quot;, based on the novel by James Clavell.

In 1989, Rhys-Davies played Marvel Comics character Kingpin in &quot;The Trial of the Incredible Hulk&quot;. He also starred in another Clavell adaption, &quot;Noble House&quot;, set in Hong Kong, where Rhys-Davies plays Ian Dunross&#x27; corporate enemy, Quillan Gornt. He has since appeared in numerous television shows and miniseries, including Agent Michael Malone in the 1993 remake of the 1950s television series &quot;The Untouchables&quot; as well as a leading role in the television series &quot;Sliders&quot; as Professor Maximillian Arturo from 1995 to 1997.
Rhys-Davies also appeared in &quot;Reilly, Ace of Spies&quot; in 1983, made several appearances in &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; as a holodeck version of Leonardo da Vinci, starred as an ally of James Bond in &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;, and appeared in the film &quot;One Night with the King&quot;. Rhys-Davies has played the character Porthos in two separate projects; a two-part episode of &quot;The Secret Adventures of Jules Verne&quot;, and the Hallmark Channel film &quot;La Femme Musketeer&quot;. He appears in the full motion video cut scenes of computer games including &quot;Ripper&quot; (as Vigo Haman) (1996), &quot;Dune 2000&quot; (as Noree Moneo) (1998), and the &quot;Wing Commander&quot; series (as James Taggart, doubling as the voice of Thrakhath nar Kiranka in the third game of the series).

In 2004, Rhys-Davies narrated &quot;The Privileged Planet&quot;, a documentary that makes the case for intelligent design. He also provided narration in the MTV series Wildboyz around this time. In 2013, Rhys-Davies appeared in the family history programme &quot;Coming Home&quot;, in which he discovered information about his grandfather&#x27;s life in the Carmarthenshire coal mines.

In 2014, Rhys-Davies joined the cast of the television show &quot;Metal Hurlant Chronicles&quot; to play Holgarth, an immortal alchemist. The following year, he had a role in the single-player campaign of the PC game &quot;Star Citizen&quot; alongside Mark Hamill and Gary Oldman. The work consisted of full body motion capture, including facial expressions and his voice; it was recorded primarily at the Imaginarium studios in the UK.

===&quot;Indiana Jones movies&quot;===
Rhys-Davies played Sallah in the 1981 film &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. He reprised the role of Sallah in two subsequent &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; films.

===&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; movies===
Rhys-Davies appeared as the dwarf Gimli in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy. The cinematography of the films was aided in that Rhys-Davies is tall – , compared to the actors playing hobbits at around . Therefore, although his character was supposed to be short, Rhys-Davies was properly in proportion compared to the hobbit actors. Had he been of more similar height, shots of the entire fellowship would have required three camera passes rather than two.

Rhys-Davies is the only one of the nine Fellowship of the Ring actors who did not receive a tattoo of the word &quot;nine&quot; written in the Tengwar script; his stunt double, Brett Beattie, was offered the tattoo instead as Rhys-Davies was disinclined to get one himself and Beattie had spent so much time as his double that he almost received co-credit.

Rhys-Davies suffered severe reactions to the prosthetics used during filming, and his eyes sometimes swelled shut. When asked whether Rhys-Davies would consider returning to the role for the film version of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, he said, &quot;I have already completely ruled it out. There&#x27;s a sentimental part of me that would love to be involved again. Really I am not sure my face can take that sort of punishment any more.&quot; Rhys-Davies added that this time around, &quot;[t]hey&#x27;ve got a different set of problems... because you&#x27;ve got 13 dwarves, a whole band of them... You&#x27;re trying to represent a whole race... You&#x27;re trying to do for dwarves what &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; did for hobbits.&quot; He offered help as a dwarf advisor in 2011, but ruled out returning as Gimli in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; because of the punishing makeup required.

===Voice work===

In addition to voicing the Ent Treebeard in &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, Rhys-Davies has lent his distinctive voice to many video games and animated television series, including the role of Hades in &quot;Justice League&quot;, the original voice of Man Ray in &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; (until both roles were recast with Bob Joles), and numerous times in &quot;Gargoyles&quot; (1994–1996), as the character Macbeth. He also lent his vocal talents to the games &quot;Freelancer&quot; (as Richard Winston Tobias) and &quot;Lords of Everquest&quot; (both in 2003) and the game &quot;Quest for Glory IV: Shadows of Darkness&quot;, which was released with his narration on a CD-ROM version in 1995. Rhys-Davies also had a voice role on &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance&quot; as the character Jherek, and narrated a documentary called &quot;The Glory of Macedonia&quot;. Next Generation magazine gave its &quot;Dune 2000&quot; review &#x27;an automatic one-star deduction for featuring John &quot;Multimedia Whore&quot; Rhys-Davies in the FMV.&#x27;

Rhys-Davies&#x27; voice can be heard on the 2009 documentary &quot;Reclaiming The Blade&quot;. In the narration, he explores swords, historical European swordsmanship and fight choreography on film, a topic very familiar to Rhys-Davies from his experiences in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy, where his character wielded an axe in many scenes.

In 2004, Rhys-Davies was the unknowing subject of an internet prank that spread false rumours in several mainstream media sources that he was scheduled to play the role of General Grievous in &quot;Star Wars Episode III&quot;.

Rhys-Davies is the narrator of &quot;The Truth &amp; Life Dramatized audio New Testament Bible&quot;, a 22-hour, celebrity-voiced, fully dramatised audiobook version of the New Testament which uses the Revised Standard Version-Catholic Edition translation. In 2011, he presented &quot;KJB: The Book That Changed The World&quot;, which features Rhys-Davies reading diverse snippets from the King James Version.

Rhys-Davies’ voice work also includes voice-over work with &quot;Breathe Bible&quot;. In 2016, he provided spoken words for &quot;Voices of Fire&quot;, the sixth album by a cappella power metal band van Canto.

A resident of the Isle of Man since 1988, John Rhys-Davies provides the introductory voice-over to the Island&#x27;s Castle Rushen, one of the best-preserved medieval fortresses in the British Isles. In 2018, he lent his voice to the Isle of Man&#x27;s tourism commercial.

Rhys-Davies voice was recorded for some of the callouts in the 1993 Williams SuperPin &quot;Indiana Jones: The Pinball Adventure&quot;.

In the 2023 video game &quot;The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria&quot;, Rhys-Davies reprises the role of Gimli and narrates the opening scene.

==Personal life==
===Relationships===

Rhys-Davies married Suzanne Wilkinson in December 1966, and they had two sons together. Although they legally separated in 1985, they remained married until her death from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in 2010. They remained friends, and Rhys-Davies took care of Wilkinson in her final years.

In 2004, Rhys-Davies began dating Lisa Manning. They have a daughter together, and split their time between homes in the New Zealand region of Waikato and on the Isle of Man.

===Religious views===
While Rhys-Davies identifies as irreligious, he holds Christianity in high regard and has stated that &quot;Christian civilisation has made the world a better place than it ever was.&quot;

In February 2020, Rhys-Davies stated, &quot;All the things that we value, the right of free speech, the right of the individual conscience, these evolved in first and second century Roman Christendom, where the individual Christian said, &#x27;I have a right to believe, what I believe and not what the Emperor tells me.&#x27; From that our whole idea of democracy and the equality that we have has developed. We owe Christianity the greatest debt of thanks that a generation can ever have, and to slight it and to dismiss it as being irrelevant is the detritus of rather ill-read minds, I think.&quot;

===Political views===
Rhys-Davies is not a member of any political party. He was a radical leftist as a university student in the 1960s, but changed his views after heckling Margaret Thatcher, who he said &quot;shot down the first two hecklers in such brilliant fashion that [he] decided [he] ought for once to shut up and listen&quot;.

In 2004, Rhys-Davies said in an interview with &quot;World&quot; magazine: &quot;There is a demographic catastrophe happening in Europe that nobody wants to talk about, that we daren&#x27;t bring up because we are so cagey about not offending people racially. And rightly we should be. But there is a cultural thing as well. By 2020, 50% of the children in Holland under the age of 18 will be of Muslim descent.&quot; In an interview with the conservative journal &quot;National Review&quot;, he said that he is opposed to Islamic extremism because he believes that it violates the Western values of equality, democracy, tolerance, and the abolition of slavery.

Rhys-Davies was vocal in his support for Brexit.

<text>Mary Willie Grace Moore (December 5, 1898January 26, 1947) was an American operatic lyric soprano and actress in musical theatre and film. She was nicknamed the &quot;Tennessee Nightingale.&quot; Her films helped to popularize opera by bringing it to a larger audience. She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in &quot;One Night of Love&quot;.

In 1947, Moore died in a plane crash at the age of 48. She published an autobiography in 1944 titled &quot;You&#x27;re Only Human Once&quot;. In 1953, a film about her life was released titled &quot;So This Is Love&quot; starring Kathryn Grayson.

==Early life==
Moore was born Mary Willie Grace Moore, the daughter of Tessa Jane (née Stokely) and Richard Lawson Moore. She was born in the community of Slabtown (now considered part of Del Rio) in Cocke County, Tennessee. By the time she was two years old, her family had relocated to Knoxville, a move Moore later described as traumatic. She found urban life distasteful at the time. After several years in Knoxville, the family again relocated to Jellico, Tennessee, where Moore spent her adolescence. After high school in Jellico, she studied briefly at Ward-Belmont College in Nashville before moving to Washington, D.C., and New York City to continue her musical training and begin her career. The Black Cat Café in Greenwich Village was where she landed her first professional singing gig. She relocated to New York in 1919 to pursue her singing career and performed there in nightclubs to help pay for singing classes.

==Career==

===Musical theater===

Grace Moore&#x27;s first Broadway appearance was in 1920 in the musical &quot;Hitchy-Koo&quot;, by Jerome Kern. In 1922 and 1923 she appeared in the second and third of Irving Berlin&#x27;s series of four Music Box Revues. In the 1923 edition she and John Steel introduced Berlin&#x27;s song &quot;What&#x27;ll I Do&quot;. When Moore sang &quot;An Orange Grove in California&quot;, orange blossom perfume was wafted through the theater.

In 1932 she appeared on Broadway in the short-lived operetta &quot;The DuBarry&quot; by Karl Millöcker.

===Opera===

After training in France, Moore made her operatic debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City on February 7, 1928, singing the role of Mimì in Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La bohème&quot;. She debuted at the Opéra-Comique in Paris on September 29, 1928 in the same role, which she also performed in a Royal Command Performance at Covent Garden in London on June 6, 1935. During her sixteen seasons with the Metropolitan Opera, she sang in several Italian and French operas as well as the title roles in &quot;Tosca&quot;, &quot;Manon&quot;, and &quot;Louise&quot;. &quot;Louise&quot; was her favorite opera and is widely considered to have been her greatest role.

In the 1930s and 1940s she gave concert performances throughout the United States and Europe, performing a repertoire of operatic selections and other songs in German, French, Italian, Spanish, and English. During World War II, she was active in the USO, entertaining American troops abroad. In 1945 she sang Mimi to Nino Martini&#x27;s Rodolfo in &quot;La bohème&quot; for the inaugural performance of the San Antonio Grand Opera Festival.

She also performed during and after WWII in support of Allied Forces. From the personal memoire of Lt. Gen. John C. H. Lee, on 24 July 1945: &quot;After an early dinner drove in convoy to the Paris Opera House for the gala performance entitled &quot;Pacifique 45&quot; given by the French for the benefit of the families of French war veterans. The program laid particular emphasis on the war in Japan and included the showing of two films - &quot;Fighting Lady&quot; and &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; and the rendition of several songs and the French and American national anthems by Grace Moore. Seated in the box of honor were General Alphonse Juin, the French Minister of Information Jacques Soustelle, and a number of important American and French officers. It seemed to be a great success and was particularly appreciated by the crowd of some 20,000 gathered in the square outside the Opera House.&quot;

===Film===
Attracted to Hollywood in the early years of talking pictures, Moore had her first screen role as Jenny Lind in the 1930 film &quot;A Lady&#x27;s Morals&quot;, produced for MGM by Irving Thalberg and directed by Sidney Franklin. Later that same year she starred with the Metropolitan Opera singer Lawrence Tibbett in &quot;New Moon&quot;, also produced by MGM, the first screen version of Sigmund Romberg&#x27;s operetta &quot;The New Moon&quot;.

After a hiatus of several years, Moore returned to Hollywood under contract to Columbia Pictures, for whom she made six films. In the 1934 film &quot;One Night of Love&quot;, her first film for Columbia, she portrayed a small-town girl who aspires to sing opera. For that role she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress in 1935. She starred in 1936 as Empress Elisabeth of Austria in Josef von Sternberg&#x27;s production &quot;The King Steps Out&quot;.

By this time, she was so popular that MGM was able to insist on equal billing for Moore in a projected film with Maurice Chevalier, who had always enjoyed solo star billing up until then. Chevalier felt so deeply about this blow to his status that he quit Hollywood and the film was never made.

A memorable highlight of &quot;When You&#x27;re in Love&quot; (1937) was a comic scene in which Moore donned flannel shirt and trousers and joined a 5-man band for a flamboyant rendition of Cab Calloway&#x27;s &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot;, complete with gestures and &quot;hi-de-ho&#x27;s&quot;, but with the lyrics slightly altered to conform with Hollywood sensibilities. Also, she performed the popular &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; duet &quot;Vogliatemi bene&quot; with American tenor Frank Forest in the 1937 film &quot;I&#x27;ll Take Romance&quot;.

The last film that Moore made was &quot;Louise&quot; (1939), an abridged version of Gustave Charpentier&#x27;s opera of the same name, with spoken dialog in place of some of the original opera&#x27;s music. The composer participated in the production, authorizing the cuts and changes to the libretto, coaching Moore, and advising director Abel Gance. This production also featured two renowned French singers: dramatic tenor Georges Thill and basse cantante André Pernet.

==Controversies==
She was widely criticized in December 1938 when she curtsied to the Duchess of Windsor, in Cannes. Upon her return to the United States after six months and ten days in Europe (&quot;to save money in income tax&quot;), Moore defended her curtsy, saying:

She would have been a royal duchess long ago if she had not been an American. After all, she gave happiness and the courage of his convictions to one man, which is more than most women can do. She deserves a curtsy for that alone.
According to Joe Laurie Jr., vaudeville performer and historian, Grace Moore would not perform on vaudeville bills that included black performers.

==Honors==
In 1935 Moore received the gold medal award of the Society of Arts and Sciences for &quot;conspicuous achievement in raising the standard of cinema entertainment.&quot; In 1936 King Christian X of Denmark awarded her his country&#x27;s medal of &#x27;Ingenito et Arti.&#x27; In 1937, she was commissioned as a colonel (an honorary position) on the staff of the governor of Tennessee, and was also made a life member of the Tennessee State Society of Washington, D.C. She was decorated as a chevalier of the French Légion d&#x27;honneur in 1939. Moore was also a member of the Peabody Awards Board of Jurors from 1940 to 1942.

==Personal life==
Moore married Valentín Parera, a Spanish movie actor, in Cannes, on July 15, 1931. They had 2 children. During the 1930s they maintained homes in Hollywood, Cannes, and Connecticut.

==Death==

Grace Moore died at the age of 48, along with 21 other people, including Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden, in a plane crash near Copenhagen Airport on January 26, 1947. Moore is buried in Forest Hills Cemetery in Chattanooga.

<text>Richard Gavin Bryars (; born 16 January 1943) is an English composer and double bassist. He has worked in jazz, free improvisation, minimalism, historicism, avant-garde, and experimental music.

==Early life and career==
Born on 16 January 1943 in Goole, in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England, Bryars attended Goole Grammar School. He studied philosophy at Sheffield University but became a jazz bassist during his three years as a philosophy student.

The first musical work for which he is remembered was his role as bassist in the trio Joseph Holbrooke, alongside guitarist Derek Bailey and drummer Tony Oxley. The trio began by playing relatively traditional jazz – they toured with saxophonist Lee Konitz in 1966 – before moving into free improvisation. Bryars became dissatisfied with this when he saw a young bassist (later revealed to be Johnny Dyani) play in a manner that seemed to him to be artificial, and he abandoned improvisation, becoming interested in composition instead. In 1998 the trio reformed briefly, giving two live performances and making recordings.

Bryars&#x27;s first compositions owe much to the New York School of John Cage (with whom he briefly studied), Morton Feldman, Earle Brown and minimalism. One of his earliest pieces, &quot;The Sinking of the Titanic&quot; (1969), is an indeterminist work that allows the performers to take a number of sound sources related to the sinking of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; and make them into a piece of music. The first recording of this piece appeared on Brian Eno&#x27;s Obscure Records in 1975. The 1994 recording was remixed by Aphex Twin as &quot;Raising the Titanic&quot; (later collected on the &quot;26 Mixes for Cash&quot; album). In 2012, the centenary of the Titanic&#x27;s sinking, Bryars made a new extended version, with film projections by Bill Morrison and Laurie Olinder, that included his four children as a low-string ensemble (viola, 2 cellos, bass) and turntablist Philip Jeck, subsequently released on GB records (BCGBCD21 2013)
Another well-known early work is &quot;Jesus&#x27; Blood Never Failed Me Yet&quot; (1971), which has as its basis a recorded loop of a homeless man singing a musical fragment that the old man had improvised. On top of that loop, rich harmonies played by a live ensemble are built, always increasing in density, before the whole thing gradually fades out. A recording of this work was made in 1993 with Tom Waits singing along with the original recording of the vagrant during the final section.

Bryars was a founding member in May 1970 of the Portsmouth Sinfonia, an orchestra whose membership consisted of performers who &quot;embrace the full range of musical competence&quot; – and who played popular classical works. Its members included Brian Eno, whose Obscure Records label would subsequently release works by Bryars. In one of the label&#x27;s first three releases, Eno&#x27;s album &quot;Discreet Music&quot;, Bryars conducted and co-arranged &quot;Three Variations on the Canon in D Major by Johann Pachelbel&quot;, which constitutes the second half of the album.

The 1992 composition &quot;A Man in a Room Gambling&quot; was written on commission from Artangel. Bryars&#x27;s music is heard beneath monologues spoken by the Spanish artist Juan Muñoz, who talks about methods of cheating at card games (drawing on &quot;The Expert at the Card Table&quot; by S. W. Erdnase). The ten short works were played on BBC Radio 3 without any introductory announcements, and Bryars wrote that Muñoz hoped they would appear to the listener in a similar way to the &quot;Shipping Forecast&quot;, &quot;bemused by this fleeting and perhaps enigmatic curiosity.&quot;

Bryars has written many other works, including five operas, and many instrumental pieces, among them four string quartets and several concertos. He has written several pieces for dance, including &quot;Biped&quot; (1999) for Merce Cunningham, as well as works for William Forsythe, Carolyn Carlson, Edouard Lock and David Dawson. In 1981–1984 Bryars participated in &quot;the CIVIL warS&quot;, a vast, never-completed multimedia project by Robert Wilson, who also directed his first opera, &quot;Medea&quot;. His cello concerto &quot;Farewell to Philosophy&quot; was recorded in 1996 by Julian Lloyd Webber. He has also written a large body of vocal and choral music for groups such as the Hilliard Ensemble, the Latvian Radio Choir, the Estonian National Men&#x27;s Choir, Red Byrd, Trio Mediaeval, Singer Pur, Nordic Voices and The Crossing, whose recording of &quot;The Fifth Century&quot; won a Grammy in 2019. He has written a great deal for early music performers including six books of madrigals, several works for viol consort and a collection of 54 &quot;laude&quot; based on a 12th century manuscript. 

Bryars&#x27; &quot;When Harry Met Addie&quot; (a tribute to jazz singer Adelaide Hall and saxophonist Harry Carney) was premiered at the Duke Ellington Memorial Concert at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London, on 1 May 1999. The piece was performed by the London Sinfonietta Big Band and commissioned by the baritone saxophonist/bass clarinettist John Surman. Cristina Zavalloni sang the soprano and the London Sinfonietta Big Band was conducted by Diego Masson·

Bryars founded the music department at Leicester Polytechnic (now De Montfort University), and was Professor of Music there for several years. He left in 1994 to concentrate on composition and performance. He lives in England, and, for part of the year, on the west coast of Canada.

Since 1986 Bryars has run The Gavin Bryars Ensemble with his preferred musicians, consisting chiefly of low strings. Now, in addition, this regularly includes his children (2 cellos, piano and double bass)

Since 1974 Bryars has been a member of the Collège de &#x27;Pataphysique and was elected Regent in 2001. In 2015 he was named Transcendent Satrap, the highest honour in the Collège, a position he shares with Marcel Duchamp, Man Ray, Eugène Ionesco, Umberto Eco, and others.

In 2020, Bryars composed &quot;Altissima Luce&quot; for Sound World’s Coronavirus Fund for Freelance Musicians, a project supporting struggling musicians during the UK’s Covid 19 lockdown. It was included on the album &quot;Reflections&quot; alongside specially written pieces by other composers such as Nico Muhly, Mark-Anthony Turnage, Evelyn Glennie and Sally Beamish.

In 2023, Bryars collaborated with Goole band Sandra&#x27;s Wedding on their new EP, &quot;Another Rugby League Town&quot;.

Also in 2023, Bryars provided a special guest vocal for experimental composer Bill Vine&#x27;s work, &quot;Norwich Under the Water&quot;. The piece premiered at Norwich Cathedral in August 2023.

In November 2024, Bryars received the Ivor Novello Award for Innovation, presented in association with the Musicians&#x27; Union, at The Ivors Classical Awards.

==Personal life==
Bryars is married to Anna Tchernakova, a Russian filmmaker, and has a stepdaughter and son. Bryars has two daughters from his first marriage.

<doc id="177824" wikidata="Q849336" url="?curid=177824" title="Dangerous (1935 film)">
<text>Dangerous is a 1935 American drama film directed by Alfred E. Green and starring Bette Davis in her first Oscar-winning role. The screenplay by Laird Doyle is based on his story &quot;Hard Luck Dame&quot;.

==Plot==
Don Bellows, a prominent architect, is engaged to the beautiful and wealthy Gail Armitage when he meets down-and-out Joyce Heath, who was once the most promising young actress on Broadway. Don feels deeply indebted to Joyce because her performance as Juliet inspired him to become an architect.

While rehabilitating her, Don falls in love with the tempestuous actress. Joyce, convinced she destroys anything and anyone she touches, warns him she is a jinx. Compelled to save her, Don breaks his engagement to Gail and risks his fortune to back the actress in a Broadway show. Before opening night, he insists they marry, but Joyce resists his proposal, hiding the fact she is married to Gordon Heath, an ineffectual but devoted man who was financially ruined by their marriage.

Joyce goes to Gordon and begs him for a divorce. When he refuses, she causes an automobile accident that cripples him for life. Her own injuries keep her from opening in the show, which fails. Don is ruined, and when he learns that Joyce has deceived him, he accuses her of being a completely selfish woman, her only true jinx.

Joyce briefly considers suicide, but eventually sees the truth in Don&#x27;s accusation. She re-opens the show and, although she truly loves Don, sends him away to marry Gail. The show is a success, and Joyce, now dedicated to a responsible life, goes to visit Gordon and salvage her marriage.

==Cast==
* Bette Davis as Joyce Heath
* Franchot Tone as Don Bellows
* Margaret Lindsay as Gail Armitage
* Alison Skipworth as Mrs. Williams
* John Eldredge as Gordon Heath
* Dick Foran as Teddy
* Walter Walker as Roger Farnsworth 
* Richard Carle as Pitt Hanley
* George Irving as Charles Melton 
* Pierre Watkin as George Sheffield 
* Douglas Wood as Elmont 
* William B. Davidson as Reed Walsh (as William Davidson)

==Production==
Bette Davis initially turned down the script, but Warner Bros. studio production chief Hal B. Wallis convinced her she could make something special out of the character, who had been inspired by one of Davis&#x27; idols, actress Jeanne Eagels. In fact, one of the characters in the film mentions how Eagels and Davis character Joyce are the only two actresses who can play the lead in the play &quot;But to Die&quot;. Davis was determined to look like an actress on the skids, and insisted Orry-Kelly design costumes appropriate for a woman who had seen better days. It was for this film Perc Westmore styled her hair in the bob cut she would favor for the rest of her life.

Based on Laird Doyle&#x27;s short story &quot;Hard Luck Dame&quot;, the $194,000 film had six working titles before producer Hal B. Wallis decided on &quot;Dangerous&quot;. The other titles were &quot;Hard Luck Dame&quot;, &quot;Evil Star&quot; (which Davis favored), &quot;The Jinx Woman&quot;, &quot;Forever Ends at Dawn&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow Ends&quot; and &quot;But to Die&quot;.

Franchot Tone, who recently had completed &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot;, was borrowed from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to bolster Davis&#x27; marquee value.

Three songs by Harry Warren - &quot;Forty-Second Street,&quot; &quot;The Little Things You Used to Do,&quot; and &quot;Sweet and Slow&quot; - are heard on the soundtrack. The other song was &quot;Bridal Chorus&quot; by Richard Wagner.

In 1941, the film was remade as &quot;Singapore Woman&quot; as a second feature with Brenda Marshall in the lead role. It coincidentally utilized some of the sets from &quot;The Letter&quot;, the 1940 film starring Davis.

Davis won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance, but always felt it was a consolation prize for not having been nominated for &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; the previous year, and believed that Katharine Hepburn should have won the award for her performance in another 1935 film, &quot;Alice Adams&quot;. In 2002, Steven Spielberg anonymously bought the Oscar Davis had won at auction at Sotheby&#x27;s and returned it to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The statuette had been part of the memorabilia displayed by the Planet Hollywood restaurant chain.

==Critical reception==
Australian film historian John Baxter wrote that Davis’ performance &quot;is an incomparable portrayal of human desolation moderating to hope and triumph...the peak of her performance is a brief scene, in which, to escape a storm, she and Francois Tone run to a barn stacked with bales of hay...the couple face each other in the damp, electrically charged air. Davis moves her arms in a gesture of seductive negligence, offers a mockingly companionable half-smile and we understand immediately the combination of sexual desire and malicious contempt for men that is both her mood at the moment and the key to her entire life.

&quot;Epiphanies are rare in the cinema, and it is to Davis&#x27; genius alone that we owe this brief insight into the complexities of human behavior. Here is a talent beyond comparison, and nowhere is it more advantageous displayed than in her films of the Thirties.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote &quot;That Bette Davis has been unable to match the grim standard she set as Mildred in &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; is not to her discredit. In &quot;Dangerous&quot;, she tries again. Except for a few sequences where the tension is convincing as well as deadly she fails...Say this for Miss Davis: she seldom lets down.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; wrote &quot;Laird&#x27;s dialog is adult, intelligent and has a rhythmic beat. Davis&#x27; performance is fine on the whole, despite a few imperfect moments. When called upon to reach an intense dramatic pitch without hysterics, Davis is capable of turning the trick. Yet there are moments in &quot;Dangerous&quot; when a lighter acting mood would be opportune.&quot;

Writing for &quot;The Spectator&quot; in 1936, Graham Greene gave the film a mixed review. Characterizing the story as &quot;poor, [and] the ending atrociously sentimental&quot;, and criticizing Margaret Lindsay&#x27;s portrayal of Gail, Greene also praised Bette Davis for her portrayal of Joyce, and concluded that the film was &quot;a picture to see for [Bette Davis&#x27;] sake&quot;—&quot;unusual, but only because of Miss Davis.&quot;

<text>Western Washington University (WWU or Western) is a public university in Bellingham, Washington, United States. The northernmost university in the contiguous United States, WWU was founded in 1893 as the state-funded New Whatcom Normal School, succeeding a private school of teaching for women founded in 1886. The university adopted its present name in 1977.

WWU offers bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees and a few doctorates. , there were 14,747 students, 13,801 of whom were undergraduate students, and 664 full-time faculty. Its athletic teams are known as the Vikings, which compete in Division II of the National Collegiate Athletic Association.

The main campus is located on 215 acres in Bellingham. WWU also operates a marine center in Anacortes and academic locations in Everett and the Olympic and Kitsap Peninsulas. The university is accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities.

==History==
Western was established as the Northwest Normal School, a teachers&#x27; school predominantly for women although men also enrolled, by Phoebe Judson in Lynden, Washington, in 1886. Eventually the school moved to Bellingham (then &quot;New Whatcom&quot;), and through the efforts of William R. Moultray and George Judson (Phoebe&#x27;s son). Governor John McGraw signed legislation establishing the New Whatcom Normal School on February 24, 1893. In November 1895, construction began on a permanent school building, now known as Old Main, the current administration building. Designed by prominent Seattle architects Warren Skillings &amp; James Corner, it was completed by early 1897 but could not be opened to students until funds could be secured to install heating, lighting, and to do general grounds maintenance, which were not included in the original contract. The first official class entered in 1899, composed of 88 students.

The institution that is now Western Washington University underwent several name changes. In 1901, the school&#x27;s name was changed to State Normal School at Whatcom to reflect New Whatcom&#x27;s name change. In 1904, the name was changed to Washington State Normal School at Bellingham when the townships of Whatcom and Fairhaven joined, and again in 1937, to Western Washington College of Education when it became a four-year college. Twenty-four years later it became Western Washington State College and finally, in 1977, the institution gained university status and changed to its present name.

The 1960s was a period of especially rapid growth for Western, as its enrollment increased from 3,000 students to over 10,000 during the decade. Also during this time, the Fairhaven College of Interdisciplinary Studies was founded (1967), with non-traditional education methods that would serve as a model for Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington. Two years later, the College of the Environment, the nation&#x27;s first dedicated environmental science college, was founded, continuing Western&#x27;s trend toward &quot;cluster&quot; colleges. That same year, on a spring afternoon, students gained headlines by blocking Interstate 5 to protest the Vietnam War. Also in 1969, the College of Ethnic Studies was established; however, after being met with significant resistance, it was dismantled in 1975.

Since this period, the College of Arts and Sciences was founded (1973) and divided into the College of Humanities &amp; Social Sciences and the College of Science &amp; Engineering (2003); the College of Fine and Performing Arts was formed from several art departments (1975); and the College of Business and Economics was established (1976).

Today, WWU has a student body that currently consists of over 16,000 students. The university is the third largest in Washington after Washington State University and the University of Washington.

<text>Elisabeth Bergner (22 August 1897 – 12 May 1986) was an Austrian-British actress. Primarily a stage actress, her career flourished in Berlin and Paris before she moved to London to work in films. Her signature role was Gemma Jones in &quot;Escape Me Never&quot;, a play written for her by Margaret Kennedy. She played Gemma, first in London and then in the Broadway debut, and in a film version for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. In 1943, Bergner returned to Broadway in the play &quot;The Two Mrs. Carrolls&quot;, for which she won the Distinguished Performance Medal from the Drama League.

==Early life==
She was born Ella vel Ettel Bergner in Drohobych, Austro-Hungarian Empire (present-day Ukraine) to Sara (née Wagner) and Emil ( Schmelke Juda) Bergner, a merchant. She grew up in a secular Jewish home. The Hebrew she heard in her childhood was associated with Yom Kippur and Pesach, and on her visits to Israel, she apologized for not knowing the language.

She first acted on stage at age 14, and appeared in Innsbruck a year later. In Vienna at age 16, she toured Austrian and German provinces with a Shakespearean company. She worked as an artist&#x27;s model, posing for sculptor Wilhelm Lehmbruck, who fell in love with her. She eventually moved to Munich and later Berlin.

==Career==
In 1923, she made her film debut in &quot;Der Evangelimann&quot;. With the rise of Nazism, Bergner moved to London with director Paul Czinner, and they married in 1933. Her stage work in London included &quot;The Boy David&quot; (1936) by J.M. Barrie, his last play, which he wrote especially for her, and &quot;Escape Me Never&quot; by Margaret Kennedy. &quot;Catherine the Great&quot; was banned in Germany because of the government&#x27;s racial policies, according to &quot;Time&quot; on 26 March 1934. She was naturalised as a British subject in 1938.

She was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for the film version of &quot;Escape Me Never&quot; (1935). She repeated her stage role of Rosalind, opposite Laurence Olivier&#x27;s Orlando, in the 1936 film &quot;As You Like It&quot;, the first sound film version of Shakespeare&#x27;s play, and the first sound film of any Shakespeare play filmed in England. Bergner had previously played the role on the German stage, and several critics found that her accent got in the way of their enjoyment of the film, which was not a success. She returned intermittently to the stage, for instance in the title role of John Webster&#x27;s &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot; in 1946.

Bergner temporarily returned to Germany in 1954, where she acted in movies and on the stage; the Berlin district of Steglitz named a city park after her. In 1973, she starred in &quot;Der Fußgänger&quot; (English title: &quot;The Pedestrian&quot;), which was nominated for an Academy Award and which won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign-Language Foreign Film of 1974. In 1980, Austria awarded her the Cross of Merit for Science and Art, and, in 1982, she won the Eleonora Duse Prize Asolo.

==Personal life==
Bergner was married once, to Hungarian-born British writer, film director, and producer Paul Czinner, from 1933 to 1972.

She was the source for the story which became the 1950 Academy Award for Best Picture-winning film &quot;All About Eve&quot;. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot; obituary for writer Mary Orr, Bergner told Orr about an experience that provided her with the inspiration for the short story that gave birth to the character of Eve Harrington. &quot;The Wisdom of Eve&quot; appeared in &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; in 1946. The play based on that story was the basis for Joseph L. Mankiewicz&#x27;s screenplay for the film. The episode occurred when Bergner was performing in the play &quot;The Two Mrs. Carrolls&quot;. Bergner took pity on a &quot;waif-like&quot; young woman who stood outside the theater for days on end. She gave her a job as her secretary, and the young actress tried to &quot;take over&quot; Bergner&#x27;s life.

Bergner was also reputedly the inspiration for the character of Dora Martin in the novel &quot;Mephisto&quot; by Klaus Mann.

==Death==
She later moved to London, where she died, aged 88, from cancer. She was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 15 May 1986, where she is commemorated with an oval memorial tablet in the West Cloister.

<text>Escape Me Never is a 1934 play written by Margaret Kennedy based upon her 1930 novel &quot;The Fool of the Family&quot;.

Set in pre World War I Europe, it tells the story of two brothers (Caryl and Sebastian Durbok) who are composers, share a flat, and are both in love with two women—an heiress and a young innocent.

The original West End run of the play at the Apollo Theatre starred Elisabeth Bergner for whom the play was written. Bergner, in her Broadway debut, starred also in the play&#x27;s 1935 production at the Shubert Theatre.

==Adaptations==

The play was adapted into a British film in 1935 starring Bergner and directed by Paul Czinner, and into an American film in 1947 starring Ida Lupino, directed by Peter Godfrey.

<doc id="177831" wikidata="Q1543107" url="?curid=177831" title="Saturday-morning cartoon">
<text>&quot;Saturday-morning cartoon&quot; is a colloquial term for the original animated series and live-action programming that was typically scheduled on Saturday and Sunday mornings in the United States on the &quot;Big Three&quot; television networks. The genre was a tradition from broadly the mid-1960s to mid-2010s; over time its popularity declined, in the face of changing cultural norms, increased competition from formats available at all times, and heavier media regulations. In the last years of the genre&#x27;s existence, Saturday-morning and Sunday-morning cartoons were primarily created and aired on major networks to meet &quot;educational and informational&quot; (E/I) requirements. Minor television networks, in addition to the non-commercial PBS in some markets, continued to air animated programming on Saturday and Sunday while partially meeting those mandates.

In the United States, the generally accepted times for these and other children&#x27;s programs to air on Saturday mornings were from 8:00 a.m. to approximately 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time Zone. Until the late 1970s, American networks also had a schedule of children&#x27;s programming on Sunday mornings, though most programs at this time were repeats of Saturday-morning shows that were already out of production. In some markets, some shows were pre-empted in favor of syndicated or other types of local programming.

==History==

Beginning in the mid-1960s, the Saturday-morning timeslot would feature a great deal of series appropriate for children, although most of these were reruns of animated series originally broadcast in prime time and adventure series made in the 1950s, as well as telecasts of older cartoons made for movie theaters. Later in the decade, the slot would be dominated by superhero and action cartoon series, influenced by the success of &quot;Space Ghost&quot;. These were heavily criticized by parents for their violence.

By 1972, most action programming had been removed from the Saturday-morning slot, following pressure from parents&#x27; lobbying groups such as the Action for Children&#x27;s Television (ACT). These groups voiced concerns about the presentation of commercialism, violence, anti-social attitudes and stereotypes in Saturday-morning cartoons. By the 1970s, these groups exercised enough influence, especially with the U.S. Congress and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), that the television networks felt compelled to impose more stringent content rules for the animation houses. In 1978, the Federal Trade Commission was openly considering a ban on all advertising during television programming targeting preschoolers, and severe restrictions on other children&#x27;s program advertising, both of which would have effectively killed off the format; the commission ultimately dropped the proposal.

The networks were encouraged to create educational spots that endeavored to use animation and/or live-action for enriching content, including the &quot;Schoolhouse Rock!&quot; series on ABC which became a fondly-remembered television classic. With the 1970s came a wave of animated versions of popular live-action prime time series as well, mainly with the voices of the original casts, as well as imitations of the highly successful &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; combining teen characters and talking animals with supernatural mystery stories.

By 1982, under President Ronald Reagan, the FCC had loosened programming and advertising regulations, leading to the era of &quot;half-hour toy commercials&quot;, starting with &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot; and continuing with such series as &quot;The Transformers&quot; and &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;. These were heavily criticized by ACT, but were nevertheless successful. As well, several more lighthearted series appeared, popularized by Hanna-Barbera’s &quot;The Smurfs&quot; and Jim Henson’s &quot;Muppet Babies&quot;. These included series based on popular video games, such as &quot;Saturday Supercade&quot;.

Despite increased competition from cable television networks (such as Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney Channel), Saturday-morning and weekday cartoon blocks continued to remain popular in the 1990s. Such examples included Disney&#x27;s Disney Afternoon in syndication, Fox&#x27;s Fox Kids, UPN&#x27;s UPN Kids, CBS&#x27;s CBS Saturday, The WB&#x27;s Kids&#x27; WB, and Amazin&#x27; Adventures (later Bohbot Kids Network) in syndication.

From 1992 however, the &quot;Big Three&quot; traditional major networks and their affiliates began replacing their Saturday-morning animated programming with weekend editions of their morning news programs, and live-action teen-oriented series. Multiple factors contributed to the change, among them the introduction of people meters in the mid-1980s that children found difficult to operate, an increasingly competitive market fueled by the multi-channel transition, a boom in first-run syndicated content and the introduction of home video and video games, increasing restrictions on advertising and educational content mandates, and broader cultural changes stemming from an increase in no-fault divorces and the end of the post-World War II baby boom.

Attempting to pair the newscasts with the remaining cartoons was largely unsuccessful because the two program formats drew widely different audiences that did not lend themselves to leading in and out of each other, leading to viewership oddities (such as NBC&#x27;s children&#x27;s block having an average viewership age of over 40 years old); by the late 2010s, all of the major American networks had shifted to live-action documentary programming, ostensibly targeted at teenagers to meet the educational mandates but less likely to cause a clash with the newscasts. This documentary programming also benefited from having less restrictive rules for advertising compared to programming targeted to children.

Saturday-morning and Sunday-morning cartoons were largely discontinued in Canada by 2002. In the United States, The CW continued to air non-E/I cartoons as late as 2014; among the &quot;Big Three&quot; traditional major networks, the final non-E/I cartoon to date (&quot;Kim Possible&quot;) was last aired in 2006.

==Legacy==
This era continues to be satirized and/or spoofed in popular culture. The tribute album &quot;Saturday Morning: Cartoons&#x27; Greatest Hits&quot; was released in 1995, featuring covers of Saturday-morning cartoon themes from the 1960s and 1970s as performed by alternative rock artists. The Netflix animated series &quot;Saturday Morning All Star Hits!&quot; parodies the mid-1980s to early 1990s era of Saturday-morning animation, such as &quot;Thundercats&quot;, &quot;Care Bears&quot;, &quot;ProStars&quot;, and &quot;Denver, the Last Dinosaur&quot;. The science fiction animated series &quot;Futurama&quot; also spoofed 1970s and 1980s Saturday-morning cartoons in the episode &quot;Saturday Morning Fun Pit&quot;.

<text>Ellen Miriam Hopkins (October 18, 1902 – October 9, 1972) was an American actress known for her versatility. She signed with Paramount Pictures in 1930.

She portrayed a pickpocket in Ernst Lubitsch&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Trouble in Paradise&quot;, a bar singer Ivy in Rouben Mamoulian&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;, and the titular character in the controversial drama &quot;The Story of Temple Drake&quot;. She received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress for the 1935 film &quot;Becky Sharp&quot;, becoming the first performer nominated for a color picture. She was nominated for a Golden Globe for &quot;The Heiress&quot;. She co-starred with Joel McCrea in five films.

Her long-running feud with actress Bette Davis was publicized for effect. Hopkins later became a pioneer of TV drama. She was considered a distinguished hostess in Hollywood and moved in intellectual and creative circles.

==Early life==
Hopkins was born in Savannah, Georgia, to Homer Hopkins and Ellen Cutler. Her early childhood home was located at 321 Whitaker St (since demolished). She was raised in Bainbridge, near the Alabama border. She had an older sister, Ruby (1900–1990). Her maternal great-grandfather, the fourth mayor of Bainbridge, had helped establish St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church in the city. Hopkins sang in the choir as a girl.

In 1909, she briefly lived in Mexico with her family. After her parents separated, Hopkins moved as a teen with her mother to Syracuse, New York, to be near her paternal uncle, Thomas Cramer Hopkins, head of the geology department at Syracuse University.

Hopkins attended Goddard Seminary in Plainfield, Vermont (later renamed Goddard College), and Syracuse University in New York State.

==Career==


At age 20, Hopkins became a chorus girl in New York City; she also acted regularly on the stage throughout the 1920s, including in the 1926 stage adaptation of Theodore Dreiser&#x27;s &quot;An American Tragedy&quot;. In 1930, she starred on Broadway in the play &quot;Ritzy&quot; by Sidney Toler. She starred on Broadway in the lead of &quot;Jezebel&quot;, a 1933 play by Owen Davis. When it was adapted as a 1938 film of the same name, Hopkins was bitterly disappointed that Bette Davis was chosen for the role she had played on stage. This began a feud between them, which the motion picture studios publicized.

In 1930, Hopkins signed with Paramount Pictures and made her official film debut in &quot;Fast and Loose&quot;. Her first great success was in the 1931 horror drama film &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;, where she portrayed Ivy Pearson, a prostitute who becomes entangled with Jekyll and Hyde. She received rave reviews, including one from Mordaunt Hall of the &quot;New York Times&quot;, saying she portrayed Ivy &quot;splendidly&quot;.

Her career ascended swiftly. In 1932, she made her breakthrough in Ernst Lubitsch&#x27;s &quot;Trouble in Paradise&quot;, where she proved her charm and wit as a beautiful and jealous pickpocket. During the pre-code Hollywood of the early 1930s, she appeared in &quot;The Smiling Lieutenant&quot;, &quot;The Story of Temple Drake&quot;, and &quot;Design for Living&quot;, all of which were box-office successes and critically acclaimed. &quot;Design for Living&quot; ranked as one of the top ten highest-grossing films of 1933.

Hopkins&#x27; early films were considered sexually risqué; produced in the years before the Motion Picture Production Code was rigorously enforced, they featured issues that would be prohibited after 1934. For instance, &quot;The Story of Temple Drake&quot; depicted a rape scene, and &quot;Design for Living&quot; featured a ménage à trois with Fredric March and Gary Cooper. Her successes continued during the remainder of the decade with the romantic comedy &quot;The Richest Girl in the World&quot; (1934); the historical drama &quot;Becky Sharp&quot; (1935), for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress; &quot;Barbary Coast&quot; (1935); &quot;These Three&quot; (1936) (the first of four films with the director William Wyler); and &quot;The Old Maid&quot; (1939).

Hopkins was one of the early actresses approached to play the role of Ellie Andrews in &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; (1934). She rejected the part, and Claudette Colbert was cast. Hopkins auditioned for the role of Scarlett O&#x27;Hara in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;; she was the only candidate to be a native Georgian, but the part went to British actress Vivien Leigh.

Hopkins had well-publicized fights with Bette Davis. Hopkins and Davis co-starred in &quot;The Old Maid&quot; (1939) and &quot;Old Acquaintance&quot; (1943). In this period, she believed that Davis was having an affair with her husband Anatole Litvak. Davis resented her jealousy and said that she had enjoyed shaking Hopkins in a scene in &quot;Old Acquaintance&quot; after Hopkins&#x27;s character makes unfounded allegations against Davis&#x27;s. Press photos featured the two divas in a boxing ring, gloves up, with the director Vincent Sherman between them like a referee. In later interviews, Davis described Hopkins as a &quot;terribly good actress&quot;, but also &quot;terribly jealous&quot;.

After &quot;Old Acquaintance&quot;, Hopkins did not work in films again until &quot;The Heiress&quot; (1949), where she played the lead character&#x27;s aunt. In Mitchell Leisen&#x27;s 1951 comedy &quot;The Mating Season&quot;, she gave a comic performance as the mother of Gene Tierney&#x27;s character. She also acted in &quot;The Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; (1961), a remake of her film &quot;These Three&quot; (1936). In the remake, she played the aunt to Shirley MacLaine, who took Hopkins&#x27; original role. Her last film roles included Robert Redford&#x27;s mother in &quot;The Chase&quot; (1966) and as an ageing former Hollywood star in the horror film &quot;Savage Intruder&quot; (1970).

Hopkins was a television pioneer. She performed in teleplays from the late 1940s through the late 1960s, in such programs as &quot;The Chevrolet Tele-Theatre&quot; (1949), &quot;Pulitzer Prize Playhouse&quot; (1951), &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot; (1951–1955), and in episodes of &quot;The Investigators&quot; (1961) and &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; (1964), and even in an episode of &quot;The Flying Nun&quot; (&quot;Bertrille and the Silent Flicks&quot;) in 1969.

She has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: one for film at 1709 Vine Street and one for television at 1716 Vine Street.

==Personal life==
Hopkins married four times. Her first marriage was to actor Brandon Peters, second to aviator and screenwriter Austin Parker, third to the director Anatole Litvak, and fourth to war correspondent Raymond B. Brock. In 1932, she adopted a son, Michael T. Hopkins (March 29, 1932 – October 5, 2010), who had a career in the U.S. Air Force.

She was known for hosting elegant parties. John O&#x27;Hara, a frequent guest, noted that

She was a staunch Democrat who strongly supported the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt.

==Death==
Hopkins died in New York City from a heart attack on October 9, 1972. She is buried in Oak City Cemetery in Bainbridge, Georgia.

<text>Becky Sharp is a 1935 American Technicolor historical drama film directed by Rouben Mamoulian and starring Miriam Hopkins, who plays the eponymous protagonist. She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. Other supporting cast were William Faversham, Frances Dee, Cedric Hardwicke, Billie Burke, Alison Skipworth, Nigel Bruce, and Alan Mowbray.

The film is based on the 1899 play of the same name by Langdon Mitchell, which in turn was based on William Makepeace Thackeray&#x27;s 1848 novel &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. The film recounts the tale of a lower-class girl who insinuates herself into an upper-class family, only to see her life and the lives of those around her destroyed. The play was made famous in the late 1890s by actress Minnie Maddern Fiske. The screenplay was written by Francis Edward Faragoh.

The film was considered a landmark in cinema as the first feature film to use the newly developed three-strip Technicolor production throughout, opening the way for a growing number of color films to be made in Britain and the United States in the years leading up to World War II. &quot;Becky Sharp&quot; was, in effect, a &quot;demonstration&quot; picture, which served to showcase and validate this advanced technology in color.

In 2019, the film was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
Becky Sharp (Miriam Hopkins), a socially ambitious young lady, manages to survive during the background years of Napoleon&#x27;s defeat at Waterloo. Becky gradually climbs the British social ladder, overcoming poverty and class distinctions, through her best friend Amelia Sedley (Frances Dee), praising any rich man who will listen.

In her efforts to advance herself, she manages to connect with a number of gentlemen: the Marquis of Steyne (Cedric Hardwicke), Joseph Sedley (Nigel Bruce), Rawdon Crawley (Alan Mowbray), and George Osborne (G. P. Huntley Jr), the husband of Amelia.

She rises to the top of British society but becomes the scourge of the social circle, offending influential ladies such as Lady Bareacres (Billie Burke).

Sharp falls into the humiliation of singing for her meals in a beer hall, but she never stays down for long. At the end, she cons her last man and finally lands Amelia&#x27;s brother, Joseph.

==Production==

John Hay &quot;Jock&quot; Whitney and Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney formed Pioneer Pictures specifically to produce color films, and signed a contract to release Pioneer films through RKO Radio Pictures.

Original director Lowell Sherman began filming on December 3, 1934. The early Technicolor systems required massive lighting, which generated high temperatures on the set. Moving between the hot interior and cool winter temperatures outdoors, Sherman contracted pneumonia and died in late December. Rouben Mamoulian was immediately enlisted to take over as director. Sherman’s footage was retained, and Mamoulian shaped his subsequent Technicolor scenes based the original script.

===Color development===
&quot;Becky Sharp&quot; was the first feature film to use the three-strip Technicolor process, which created a separate film register for each of the three primary colors, for the entirety of the film.

Earlier live action films to use the new Technicolor process for part of the film include the final musical number in the feature &quot;The Cat and the Fiddle&quot; released by MGM in February 1934, and in short sequences filmed for other movies made during 1934, including &quot;The House of Rothschild&quot; (Twentieth Century Pictures/United Artists) with George Arliss and &quot;Kid Millions&quot; (Samuel Goldwyn/United Artists) with Eddie Cantor. Warner Brothers released two Leon Errol shorts, &quot;Service with a Smile&quot; (July 28, 1934) and &quot;Good Morning, Eve!&quot; (September 22, 1934), and RKO Pictures released the short &quot;La Cucaracha&quot; (August 31, 1934).

==Reception==
Writing for &quot;The Spectator&quot;, Graham Greene raved that &quot;colour is everything here&quot; and characterizing its use in the film as &quot;a triumph&quot;. Although Greene complained that the Technicolor &quot;plays havoc with the women&#x27;s faces&quot;, leveled criticism at Hopkins for her &quot;indecisive acting&quot;, and noted that he had found the film&#x27;s climax in Bath to be &quot;absurd&quot; and &quot;silly&quot;, he described these minor complaints as &quot;ungrateful&quot; and his overall impression was that the film gave &quot;delight to the eye&quot;.

==Retrospective appraisal==
Film historian Tom Milne on the new technology in a feature film:
===The opening Waterloo “grand ball” sequence===
This “celebrated” and “famed “ sequence occurs at the estate of the Duchess of Richmond near the tiny Belgian village of Waterloo as French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte approaches at the head of his army.
The Duchess is presiding over a grand ball, the guests members of the European ruling elite. The Duke of Wellington arrives and warns the complacent company that a military engagement with Napoleon is imminent. An ominous rumbling is heard in the distance. The guests hesitate, then continue to dance. A second rumble occurs, closer, then suddenly the windows burst open, and flashes of gunfire and cannon are seen. The color of the film changes from white, to green, to yellow, to red, then is drenched in scarlett as one of the bloodiest and socially significant battles in European history begins to unfold.

Director Rouben Mamoulian wrote in Picturegoer shortly after the film’s release: “Colour, as you know, is symbolic,” adding “It is a sequence in which dialogue is of no moment…the lighting as well as the costumes contrives to accentuate the mounting drama of the scene” culminating in “red all over the action.”

Milne adds: “The Waterloo sequence is the dramatic highlight of the film...elsewhere, color is used less ostentatiously but equally theatrically.”

==Awards and honors==
Wins
* Venice Film Festival: Best Color Film, Rouben Mamoulian, 1935

Nominations
* Academy Awards: Best Actress in a Leading Role, Miriam Hopkins, 1935
* Venice Film Festival: Mussolini Cup, Rouben Mamoulian, 1935

==Preservation status==
For many years, the original three-color Technicolor version of the film was not available for viewing, though a 16 millimeter version was available. This version had been printed (poorly) on two-color Cinecolor stock which did not accurately reproduce the colors of the original film. The smaller film gauge also resulted in a grainier, inferior image.

=== UCLA Film and Television Archive Restoration ===

Beginning in the 1980s, the UCLA Film and Television Archive restored the film, under the supervision of archivist Robert Gitt. Director Rouben Mamoulian appeared at the premiere of the restored print at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences theatre in Beverly Hills.

Stage 1 was completed in 1984. For stage 2 (around 1988), Italian print elements, which allowed the picture on the last reel to be upgraded, while the somewhat splicey English soundtrack, were edited to fit the Italian print material. For stage 3, completed in 2002, a print was obtained from the Netherlands that allowed improvement in both picture and sound quality.

<text>The Dark Angel is a 1935 film that tells the story of three childhood friends, Kitty (Merle Oberon), Alan (Fredric March), and Gerald (Herbert Marshall) who come of age in England during the First World War. The script was written by Lillian Hellman and Mordaunt Shairp, adapted from the play by Guy Bolton. It was directed by Sidney Franklin, produced by Samuel Goldwyn, and released by United Artists. A silent film version of the same play, also produced by Goldwyn, was released in 1925 and is now a lost film.

&quot;The Dark Angel&quot; won the Academy Award for Best Art Direction, and was nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Merle Oberon) and Best Sound, Recording (Thomas T. Moulton). A mixed race woman who passed as white, Oberon became both the first Māori actress, and the first of Asian ancestry, to be nominated for Best Actress.

==Plot==
Kitty Vane, Alan Trent, and Gerald Shannon have been inseparable friends since childhood. Both Alan and Gerald are in love with Kitty, who in turn has been infatuated with Alan her entire life.

Gerald and Alan are drafted into World War I. They return home for ten days, during which time Alan proposes to Kitty and she joyously accepts. Despite his own love for Kitty, Gerald gives the couple his blessing. However, the newly engaged couple&#x27;s happiness is cut short when Gerald and Alan are ordered back to the front the very next day. Kitty and Alan search for somebody to marry them, but there is not enough time. They decide they do not need to marry officially, and agree to spend the night together before Alan must return to the war.

Alan and Kitty book a room in an inn. Kitty&#x27;s cousin Lawrence sees Alan taking champagne and flowers up the room and works out that Alan has a woman there, unaware that it is Kitty. The next day, Lawrence teases Alan about the previous night. Gerald misunderstands and believes Alan has cheated on Kitty. When Gerald confronts him, Alan does not reveal that he spent the evening with Kitty. Even though they are engaged, it would ruin her reputation.

Gerald, furious for Kitty&#x27;s sake, refuses to grant Alan leave so he can return home and marry her properly. Instead, Gerald inadvertently pressures Alan to join him on a dangerous mission. Alan nobly volunteers.

Months later, Gerald returns home to Kitty. They both mourn Alan&#x27;s death, believing that he was killed in an explosion. Together, they work out Gerald&#x27;s misunderstanding and conclude that they are both, in a way, to be blamed for Alan&#x27;s death. Consumed with grief, they grow closer and develop feelings for one another.

Meanwhile, we see that Alan did not die. He lost his eyesight and was cared for in a German hospital, adopting the name “Roger Crane” so that his family could not locate him. Sir George Barton, a physician who specializes in helping blind patients, not only by healing them but also by helping them adjust to their new lives, finds a photograph of Alan, Kitty and Gerald and realises that Alan has changed his name to escape his past. Sir George discharges &quot;Roger&quot;, assigning a specially trained orderly to him.

Alan plans to return to Kitty, but changes his mind at the last minute, believing that people will pity her and that she will only care for him out of duty. He leaves town and stays in an inn. He becomes friendly with the innkeeper&#x27;s children, Betty, Joe and Ginger. Inspired by his friendship with them, he begins to write a series of successful children&#x27;s books, and is eventually able to move into his own home, with a private secretary.

Sir George visits Alan, who is still living as &quot;Roger&quot;, and sees in the paper a photograph of Kitty and Gerald with the announcement that they are to be married. Recognising them as the couple from Alan&#x27;s photograph and realising that Alan is still in love with Kitty, Sir George contacts them. Gerald at first does not recognise the name Roger Crane, but works out who he really is. Gerald and Kitty go to visit Alan, who attempts to conceal his blindness from them. At first, they do not realise he cannot see, and Kitty believes that Alan has distanced himself from her and no longer loves her. Wishing to part as friends, she holds her hand out to him, but he cannot see it. She believes that he has rejected her and leaves, but Gerald realizes the truth and encourages her to go back into the house. Hearing footsteps, Alan believes that his secretary is in the room and begins talking to her. Kitty realizes that Alan is blind. She does not care and hurries over to him. They finally profess their love for each other. Gerald leaves them to their reunion.

==Reception==
It was the 12th most popular film at the British box office in 1935–1936.

In the September 6, 1935 issue of &quot;The New York Times,&quot; Andre Sennwald declared the film to be “… a happy adventure in sentimental romance…(The) highly literate screen adaptation of Guy Bolton&#x27;s play, (skirts) all the more obvious opportunities for tear-jerking and overemphasis, and (tells) the story with feeling and admirable good taste… if you know your cameramen at all, you quickly guess that the superb clarity of the photography is the work of Gregg Toland. If you are thoughtful enough to bring along a spare handkerchief, you will find (this) an engaging sentimental journey into martial romance….It is sad and sweet and brave and very sacrificial. the reunion of the blind man and his two friends… is the high point…Awaiting his visitors, the blind man plans to conceal his affliction from them by memorizing every detail in the room and arranging an elaborate stage business for receiving them. He almost gets away with his deception, but betrays himself in one unexpected detail. It is a high-powered dramatic situation and the film manages it beautifully and effectively. Both Mr. March and Mr. Marshall contribute their best performances in months, and Miss Oberon …plays with skill and feeling. … Sidney Franklin, director of that earlier sentimental masterpiece &quot;Smilin&#x27; Through,&quot; enshrouds the photoplay in the peculiarly warm emotional haze which he manages so well. It promises to be one of the popular pictures of the season.”

In the November 1, 1935, issue of Maclean&#x27;s, Ann Ross observed: “If his picture doesn’t have you sobbing before it is over it isn’t the fault of the producers and director. They don’t go at it, to be sure, in the savage spirit of We’re-going-to-make-you-cry-and-like-it. On the contrary, the whole thing is managed with the greatest tact and modesty, as though everyone concerned, while determined to wring as many tears as possible, was a little ashamed to be caught doing it... The point most likely to break you down is where the hero is discovered by his former sweetheart and pretends that he still has his sight—a trying moment which is handled with great considerateness by Miss Oberon and Mr. March. It’s all reasonably interesting, agony though it is from start to finish; rather as an operation might be interesting when conducted in nice surroundings under circumstances as merciful and competent as possible.” 

At the 8th Academy Awards, Richard Day won Best Art Direction. Merle Oberon was nominated for Best Actress, and Thomas T. Moulton was nominated for Best Sound Recording.

Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 94% from 49 reviews with the consensus: &quot;Led by a trio of powerful performances, &quot;The Dark Angel&quot; offers a well-crafted love story set against the backdrop of World War I.&quot;

==Proposed remake==
In 1962, Ross Hunter announced that he would remake the film from a script by John Lee Mahin, with Rock Hudson in the lead. The action would be relocated to Japan in the post-Korean-War period. Hunter says he paid $100,000 for the rights and only used the last ten minutes of the film. The film was never made.

<doc id="177840" wikidata="Q25191" url="?curid=177840" title="Christopher Nolan">
<text>Sir Christopher Edward Nolan (born 30 July 1970) is a British and American filmmaker. Known for blockbusters with complex storytelling produced for Hollywood studios, he is considered a leading filmmaker of the 21st century. Nolan&#x27;s films have earned over $6.6 billion worldwide, making him the seventh-highest-grossing film director. His accolades include two Academy Awards, a Golden Globe Award and two British Academy Film Awards. Nolan was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2019, and received a knighthood in 2024 for his contributions to film.

Nolan developed an interest in filmmaking from a young age. After studying English literature at University College London, he made several short films before his feature film debut with &quot;Following&quot; (1998). Nolan gained international recognition with his second film, &quot;Memento&quot; (2000), and transitioned into studio filmmaking with &quot;Insomnia&quot; (2002). He became a high-profile director with &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; trilogy (2005–2012), and found further success with &quot;The Prestige&quot; (2006), &quot;Inception&quot; (2010), &quot;Interstellar&quot; (2014), and &quot;Dunkirk&quot; (2017). After the release of &quot;Tenet&quot; (2020), Nolan parted ways with longtime distributor Warner Bros. Pictures, and signed with Universal Pictures for the biographical thriller &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; (2023), which won him Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture.

Nolan&#x27;s work regularly features in the listings of best films of their respective decades. Infused with a metaphysical outlook, his films thematise epistemology, existentialism, ethics, the construction of time, and the malleable nature of memory and personal identity. They feature mathematically inspired images and concepts, unconventional narrative structures, practical special effects, experimental soundscapes, large-format film photography, and materialistic perspectives. He has co-written several of his films with his brother, Jonathan, and runs the production company Syncopy Inc. with his wife, Emma Thomas.
== Early life ==
Christopher Edward Nolan was born on 30 July 1970, in Westminster, London. His father, Brendan James Nolan, was a British advertising executive of Irish descent who worked as a creative director. His mother, Christina Jensen, was an American flight attendant from Evanston, Illinois; she would later work as a teacher of English. He has an elder brother, Matthew, and a younger brother, Jonathan, also a filmmaker. The three brothers were raised Catholic in Highgate and would spend their summers in Evanston. Nolan also spent time living in Chicago during his youth, and he holds both UK and US citizenship.
Growing up, Nolan was particularly influenced by the work of Sir Ridley Scott and the science fiction films &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968) and &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977). He would repeatedly watch the latter film and extensively research its making. Nolan began making films at the age of seven, borrowing his father&#x27;s Super8 camera and shooting short films with his action figures. These films included a stop motion animation homage to &quot;Star Wars&quot; called &quot;Space Wars&quot;. He cast his brother Jonathan and built sets from &quot;clay, flour, egg boxes and toilet rolls&quot;. His uncle, who had worked at NASA building guidance systems for the Apollo rockets, sent him some launch footage: &quot;I re-filmed them off the screen and cut them in, thinking no-one would notice&quot;, Nolan later remarked. From the age of 11, he aspired to be a professional filmmaker. Between 1981 and 1983, Nolan enrolled at Barrow Hills, a Catholic prep school in Witley, Surrey. In his teenage years, Nolan started making films with Adrien and Roko Belic. Nolan and Roko co-directed the surreal 8mm &quot;Tarantella&quot; (1989), which was shown on &quot;Image Union&quot;, an independent film and video showcase on the Public Broadcasting Service. After a fan posted a copy of &quot;Tarantella&quot; online, in 2021, Nolan&#x27;s production company filed a copyright infringement claim, to have the film removed.

Nolan was educated at Haileybury and Imperial Service College, an independent school in Hertford Heath, Hertfordshire, and later studied English literature at University College London (UCL). Opting out of a traditional film education, he pursued &quot;a degree in something unrelated&quot;, which his father suggested &quot;gives a different take on things&quot;. He chose UCL specifically for its filmmaking facilities, which comprised a Steenbeck editing suite and 16mm film cameras. Nolan was president of the Union&#x27;s Film Society, and with Emma Thomas (his girlfriend and future wife) he screened feature films in 35mm during the school year and used the money earned to produce 16mm films over the summers.

== Career ==
=== 1993–2003: Early career and breakthrough ===
After earning his bachelor&#x27;s degree in English literature in 1993, Nolan worked as a script reader, camera operator and director of corporate films and industrial films. He directed, wrote and edited the short film &quot;Larceny&quot; (1996), which was filmed over a weekend in black and white with limited equipment and a small cast and crew. Funded by Nolan and shot with the UCL Union Film society&#x27;s equipment, it appeared at the Cambridge Film Festival in 1996 and is considered one of UCL&#x27;s best shorts. For unknown reasons, the film has since been removed from public view. Nolan filmed a third short, &quot;Doodlebug&quot; (1997), about a man seemingly chasing an insect with his shoe, only to discover that it is a miniature of himself.

Nolan and Thomas first attempted to make a feature in the mid-1990s titled &quot;Larry Mahoney&quot;, which they scrapped. During this period in his career, Nolan had little to no success getting his projects off the ground, facing several rejections; he added, &quot;[T]here&#x27;s a very limited pool of finance in the UK. To be honest, it&#x27;s a very clubby kind of place ... Never had any support whatsoever from the British film industry.&quot;

Shortly after abandoning &quot;Larry Mahoney&quot;, Nolan conceived the idea for his first feature, &quot;Following&quot; (1998), which he wrote, directed, photographed and edited. The film depicts an unemployed young writer (Jeremy Theobald) who trails strangers through London, hoping they will provide material for his first novel, but is drawn into a criminal underworld when he fails to keep his distance. It was inspired by Nolan&#x27;s experience of living in London and having his apartment burgled; he observed that the common attribute between larceny and pursuing someone through a crowd was that they both cross social boundaries. Co-produced by Nolan with Thomas and Theobald, it was made on a budget of around £3,000. Most of the cast and crew were friends of Nolan, and shooting took place on weekends over the course of a year. To conserve film stock, each scene was rehearsed extensively to ensure that the first or second take could be used in the final edit. &quot;Following&quot; won several awards during its festival run and was well-received by critics who labelled Nolan a majorly talented debutant. Scott Timberg of &quot;New Times LA&quot; wrote that it &quot;echoed Hitchcock classics&quot;, but was &quot;leaner and meaner&quot;. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was impressed with its &quot;spare look&quot; and &quot;agile hand-held camerawork&quot;, saying, &quot;As a result, the actors convincingly carry off the before, during and after modes that the film eventually, and artfully, weaves together.&quot;

&quot;Following&quot; success afforded Nolan the opportunity to make &quot;Memento&quot; (2000), which became his breakthrough film. His brother Jonathan pitched the idea to him, about a man with anterograde amnesia who uses notes and tattoos to hunt for his wife&#x27;s murderer. Jonathan worked the idea into a short story, &quot;Memento Mori&quot; (2001), and Nolan developed it into a screenplay that told the story in reverse. Aaron Ryder, an executive for Newmarket Films, said it was &quot;perhaps the most innovative script I had ever seen&quot;. The film was optioned and given a budget of $4.5million, with Guy Pearce and Carrie-Anne Moss in the starring roles. Newmarket also distributed the film after it was rejected by studios who feared that it would not attract a wide audience. Following a positive word of mouth and screenings in 500 theatres, it earned $40million. &quot;Memento&quot; premiered at the Venice Film Festival in September 2000 to critical acclaim. Joe Morgenstern of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote in his review, &quot;I can&#x27;t remember when a movie has seemed so clever, strangely affecting and slyly funny at the very same time.&quot; In the book &quot;The Philosophy of Neo-Noir&quot;, Basil Smith drew a comparison with John Locke&#x27;s &quot;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot;, which argues that conscious memories constitute our identities – a theme Nolan explores in the film. &quot;Memento&quot; earned Nolan many accolades, including nominations for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay, as well as two Independent Spirit Awards: Best Director and Best Screenplay. Six critics listed it as one of the best films of the 2000s. In 2001, Nolan and Emma Thomas founded the production company Syncopy Inc.

Impressed by his work on &quot;Memento&quot;, filmmaker Steven Soderbergh recommended Nolan to Warner Bros. to direct the psychological thriller &quot;Insomnia&quot; (2002), although the studio initially wanted a more seasoned director. A remake of the 1997 Norwegian thriller of the same name, the film is viewed as &quot;the outlier of Nolan&#x27;s filmography&quot; due to its perceived lack of unconventionality he is known for. Starring Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank, &quot;Insomnia&quot; follows two Los Angeles detectives sent to a northern Alaskan town to investigate the murder of a local teenager. It received positive reviews from critics and earned $113million against a budget of $46million. Film critic Roger Ebert praised the film for introducing new perspectives and ideas on the issues of morality and guilt, adding, &quot;Unlike most remakes, the Nolan &quot;Insomnia&quot; is not a pale retread, but a re-examination of the material, like a new production of a good play.&quot; Richard Schickel of &quot;Time&quot; deemed &quot;Insomnia&quot; a &quot;worthy successor&quot; to &quot;Memento&quot; and &quot;a triumph of atmosphere over a none-too-mysterious mystery&quot;.

&quot;Following&quot;, &quot;Memento&quot; and &quot;Insomnia&quot; established Nolan&#x27;s image as an &quot;auteur&quot;. After the lattermost, he wrote a screenplay for a Howard Hughes biopic. Nolan reluctantly tabled his script after learning that Martin Scorsese was already making one such film: &quot;The Aviator&quot; (2004). He was then briefly attached to direct a film adaptation of Ruth Rendell&#x27;s novel &quot;The Keys to the Street&quot; for Fox Searchlight Pictures but chose to direct &quot;Batman Begins&quot; instead. Nolan turned down an offer to direct the historical epic &quot;Troy&quot; (2004). In April 2003, filmmaker David O. Russell put Nolan in a headlock at a Hollywood party after learning that Jude Law, whom Russell wanted to cast, had decided to work with Nolan instead. Russell pressured Nolan to display &quot;artistic solidarity&quot; by relinquishing Law from his cast.

=== 2003–2013: Widespread recognition ===
In early 2003, Nolan approached Warner Bros. with the idea of making a new Batman film, based on the character&#x27;s origin story. Nolan was fascinated by the notion of grounding it in a more realistic world than a comic-book fantasy. He relied heavily on traditional stunts and miniature effects during filming, with minimal use of computer-generated imagery (CGI). &quot;Batman Begins&quot; (2005), the biggest project Nolan had undertaken to that point, was released to critical acclaim and commercial success. Starring Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman—along with Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson—&quot;Batman Begins&quot; revived the franchise. &quot;Batman Begins&quot; was 2005&#x27;s ninth-highest-grossing film and was praised for its psychological depth and contemporary relevance; it is cited as one of the most influential films of the 2000s. Film author Ian Nathan wrote that within five years of his career, Nolan &quot;[went] from unknown to indie darling to gaining creative control over one of the biggest properties in Hollywood, and (perhaps unwittingly) fomenting the genre that would redefine the entire industry&quot;.

Nolan directed, co-wrote and produced &quot;The Prestige&quot; (2006), an adaptation of the Christopher Priest novel about two rival 19th-century magicians. The screenplay was the result of an intermittent, five-year collaboration between him and his brother Jonathan, who had begun writing it already in 2001. Nolan initially intended to make the film as early as 2003, but had postponed the project after agreeing to make &quot;Batman Begins&quot;. Starring Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale in the lead roles of rival magicians, &quot;The Prestige&quot; received critical acclaim and received two Academy Award nominations. Roger Ebert described it as &quot;quite a movieatmospheric, obsessive, almost satanic&quot;, and Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it an &quot;ambitious, unnerving melodrama&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; Philip French wrote: &quot;In addition to the intellectual or philosophical excitement it engenders, &quot;The Prestige&quot; is gripping, suspenseful, mysterious, moving and often darkly funny.&quot; Despite a negative box-office prognosis, the film earned over $109million against a budget of $40million.

&quot;The Dark Knight&quot; (2008), the follow-up to &quot;Batman Begins&quot;, was Nolan&#x27;s next venture. Initially reluctant to make a sequel, he agreed after Warner Bros. repeatedly insisted. Nolan wanted to expand on the noir quality of the first film by broadening the canvas and taking on &quot;the dynamic of a story of the city, a large crime story... where you&#x27;re looking at the police, the justice system, the vigilante, the poor people, the rich people, the criminals&quot;. Continuing to minimise the use of CGI, Nolan employed high-resolution IMAX cameras, making it the first major motion picture to use this technology. &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; has been ranked as one of the best films of the 2000s and one of the best superhero films ever made. Many critics declare &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; to be &quot;the most successful comic book film ever made&quot;. Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; found the film to be of higher artistic merit than many Hollywood blockbusters: &quot;Pitched at the divide between art and industry, poetry and entertainment, it goes darker and deeper than any Hollywood movie of its comic-book kind.&quot; Ebert expressed a similar point of view, describing it as a &quot;haunted film that leaps beyond its origins and becomes an engrossing tragedy&quot;. &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; set many box-office records during its theatrical run, earning over $1billion worldwide. At the 81st Academy Awards, the film was nominated in eight categories, winning two: Best Sound Editing for Richard King and a posthumous Best Supporting Actor award for Heath Ledger. The film&#x27;s failure to garner a Best Picture nomination was criticised by the media. Beginning in 2010, the Academy increased their Best Picture nominees from five to ten, a change known as &quot;The Dark Knight Rule&quot;. Nolan received many awards and nominations for his work on the film. In the late 2000s, Nolan was reported to direct a film adaptation of the 1960s television series &quot;The Prisoner&quot;.

The success of &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; allowed Warner Bros. to sign Nolan to write, direct and co-produce &quot;Inception&quot; (2010) – a film for which he had the idea around nine years before its release. Nolan described the film as &quot;a contemporary sci-fi actioner set within the architecture of the mind&quot;. Starring a large ensemble cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio, the film became a critical and commercial success upon its release. Film critic Mark Kermode named it the best film of 2010, stating &quot;&quot;Inception&quot; is proof that people are not stupid, that cinema is not trash, and that it is possible for blockbusters and art to be the same thing.&quot; Philosophy professor David Kyle Johnson wrote that &quot;&quot;Inception&quot; became a classic almost as soon as it was projected on silver screens&quot;, praising its exploration of philosophical ideas, including leap of faith and allegory of the cave. The film grossed over $836million worldwide. Nominated for eight Academy Awards—including Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay—it won Best Cinematography, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects. Nolan was nominated for a BAFTA Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Director, among other accolades.
Around the release of &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; (2012), Nolan&#x27;s third and final Batman film, Joseph Bevan of the British Film Institute wrote a profile on him: &quot;In the space of just over a decade, Christopher Nolan has shot from promising British indie director to undisputed master of a new brand of intelligent escapism.&quot; After initial hesitation, Nolan agreed to return to direct &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; and worked with his brother and David S. Goyer to develop a story that he felt would end the trilogy on a high note. The film was released to positive reviews. Kenneth Turan found the film &quot;potent, persuasive and hypnotic&quot; and &quot;more than an exceptional superhero movie, it is masterful filmmaking by any standard&quot;. Christy Lemire of &quot;HuffPost&quot; wrote in her review that Nolan concluded his trilogy in a &quot;typically spectacular, ambitious fashion&quot;, but disliked the &quot;overloaded&quot; story and excessive grimness. &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; was a box office success, becoming the thirteenth film to gross $1billion. During a midnight showing of the film in Aurora, Colorado, a gunman opened fire inside the theatre, killing 12 people and injuring 58 others. Nolan released a statement expressing his condolences for the victims of what he described as a &quot;senseless tragedy&quot;.

&quot;The Dark Knight&quot; trilogy inspired a trend in future superhero films seeking to replicate its gritty, realistic tone to little success. The second instalment in particular revitalised the genre at a time when recent superhero films had failed to meet expectations. Ben Child of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that the three films &quot;will remain thrilling totems of the genre for decades to come&quot;. During story discussions for &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;, Goyer told Nolan of his idea about &quot;Man of Steel&quot; (2013), which the latter would produce. Impressed with Zack Snyder&#x27;s work in &quot;300&quot; (2006) and &quot;Watchmen&quot; (2009), Nolan hired him to direct the film. Starring Henry Cavill as Clark Kent who learns that he is a powerful alien, &quot;Man of Steel&quot; received mixed reviews and grossed more than $660million against a budget of $220million.

=== 2014–2019: &quot;Interstellar&quot;, &quot;Dunkirk&quot; and other activities ===
Nolan next directed, wrote and produced the science-fiction film &quot;Interstellar&quot; (2014). The first drafts of the script were written by Jonathan Nolan, and it was originally to be directed by Steven Spielberg. Based on the scientific theories of theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, the film follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole in search of a new home for humanity. In a 2014 discussion of the film&#x27;s physics, Nolan expressed his admiration for scientific objectivity, wishing it were applied &quot;in every aspect of our civilisation&quot;. &quot;Interstellar&quot; – starring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain – was released to positive reviews and grossed $773million worldwide. Observing its &quot;visual dazzle, thematic ambition&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; A. O. Scott wrote that &quot;Interstellar&quot; is a &quot;sweeping, futuristic adventure driven by grief, dread and regret&quot;. Documentary filmmaker Toni Myers called the film &quot;a real work of art&quot; and praised it for exploring a story spanning multiple generations. &quot;Interstellar&quot; was particularly praised for its scientific accuracy, which led to the publication of two academic papers. The &quot;American Journal of Physics&quot; called for it to be shown in school science lessons. At the 87th Academy Awards, the film won Best Visual Effects and received four other nominations. Also in 2014, Nolan and Emma Thomas served as executive producers on &quot;Transcendence&quot;, the directorial debut of his longtime cinematographer Wally Pfister.

In the mid-2010s, Nolan took part in several ventures for film preservation and distribution of the work of lesser-known filmmakers. His production company, Syncopy, formed a joint venture with Zeitgeist Films to release Blu-ray editions of Zeitgeist&#x27;s films. As a part of the Blu-ray release of the animation films of the Brothers Quay, Nolan directed the documentary short &quot;Quay&quot; (2015). He initiated a theatrical tour, showcasing the Quays&#x27; &quot;In Absentia&quot;, &quot;The Comb&quot; and &quot;Street of Crocodiles&quot;. IndieWire wrote that the brothers &quot;will undoubtedly have hundreds, if not thousands more fans because of Nolan, and for that &quot;The Quay Brothers in 35mm&quot; will always be one of [the] latter&#x27;s most important contributions to cinema&quot;. An advocate for the survival of the analogue medium, Nolan and visual artist Tacita Dean invited representatives from leading American film archives, laboratories and presenting institutions to participate in an informal summit entitled &quot;Reframing the Future of Film&quot; at the Getty Museum in March 2015. Subsequent events were held at Tate Modern in London, Museo Tamayo in Mexico City and Tata Theatre in Mumbai. In April 2015, Nolan joined the board of directors of The Film Foundation, a non-profitable organisation dedicated to film preservation, and was appointed, along with Martin Scorsese, by the Library of Congress to serve on the National Film Preservation Board as DGA representatives. Nolan serves on the Motion Picture &amp; Television Fund Board of Governors.

After serving as an executive producer on Zack Snyder&#x27;s &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot; (2016) and &quot;Justice League&quot; (2017), Nolan returned to directing with &quot;Dunkirk&quot; (2017). Based on his own original screenplay and co-produced with Thomas, the film is set amid World War II in 1940 and the evacuation of Allied soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk, France. Describing the film as a survival tale with a triptych structure, Nolan wanted to make a &quot;sensory, almost experimental movie&quot; with minimal dialogue. He said he waited to make &quot;Dunkirk&quot; until he had earned the trust of a major studio to let him make it as a British film but with an American budget. Before filming, Nolan sought advice from Spielberg, who later said in an interview with &quot;Variety&quot;, &quot;knowing and respecting that Chris [Nolan] is one of the world&#x27;s most imaginative filmmakers, my advice to him was to leave his imagination, as I did on &quot;Ryan&quot;, in second position to the research he was doing to authentically acquit this historical drama&quot;. Starring an ensemble cast, &quot;Dunkirk&quot; was released to widespread critical acclaim and strong box office results. It grossed over $526million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing World WarII film of all time. In his review, Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s one of the best war films ever made, distinct in its look, in its approach and in the effect it has on viewers. There are movies—they are rare—that lift you out of your present circumstances and immerse you so fully in another experience that you watch in a state of jaw-dropped awe. &quot;Dunkirk&quot; is that kind of movie.&quot; The film received many accolades, including Nolan&#x27;s first Oscar nomination for Best Director.
In 2018, Nolan supervised a new 70mm print of Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968), made from the original camera negative; he presented it at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival. &quot;USA Today&quot; observed that festival-goers greeted Nolan &quot;like a rock star with a standing ovation&quot;. A year later, Nolan and Thomas received executive producer credits on &quot;The Doll&#x27;s Breath&quot; (2019), an animated short directed by the Quay brothers.

=== 2020–present: &quot;Tenet&quot;, &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; and &quot;The Odyssey&quot; ===
Nolan&#x27;s next film was the science fiction film &quot;Tenet&quot; (2020), described by Tom Shone of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; as &quot;a globe-spinning riff on all things Nolanesque&quot;. Nolan had worked on the screenplay for more than five years after deliberating about its central ideas for over a decade. Delayed three times due to the COVID-19 pandemic, &quot;Tenet&quot; was the first Hollywood tent-pole to open in theatres after the pandemic shutdown. The film tells the story of an unnamed protagonist (played by John David Washington) who travels through time to stop a world-threatening attack. It grossed $363million worldwide on a production budget of $200million, becoming Nolan&#x27;s first to underperform at the box-office. &quot;Tenet&quot; was described as his most polarising film; critics praised the ambition and technical aspects but found its story confusing. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; awarded it five out of five, calling it &quot;a cerebral cadenza, a deadpan flourish of crazy implausibility—but supercharged with steroidal energy and imagination&quot;. Leslie Felperin of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; described it as &quot;a chilly, cerebral film—easy to admire, especially since it&#x27;s so rich in audacity and originality, but almost impossible to love, lacking as it is in a certain humanity&quot;. At the 93rd Academy Awards, the film won Best Visual Effects and was nominated for Best Production Design. Following the release of &quot;Tenet&quot;, Nolan joined the Advisory Board of the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers. He served as an executive producer on &quot;Zack Snyder&#x27;s Justice League&quot; (2021), a director&#x27;s cut of 2017&#x27;s &quot;Justice League&quot;.

Nolan&#x27;s 12th film was &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; (2023), a biopic based on J. Robert Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy) and his role in the development of the atom bomb. It was Nolan&#x27;s first R-rated film since &quot;Insomnia&quot; (2002). The film was financed and distributed by Universal Pictures, making it Nolan&#x27;s first feature film since &quot;Memento&quot; that was not made for Warner Bros. He disagreed with Warner Bros.&#x27; decision to simultaneously release their films in theatres and on HBO Max. Nolan secured the deal with Universal after he was promised a production budget of around $100 million with an equal marketing budget, total creative control, 20 per cent of first-dollar gross, a 100-day theatrical window and a blackout period from the studio wherein the company would not release another film three weeks before or after &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; release. The film received critical acclaim. Matthew Jackson of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Oppenheimer&quot; deserves the title of masterpiece. It&#x27;s Christopher Nolan&#x27;s best film so far, a step up to a new level for one of our finest filmmakers, and a movie that burns itself into your brain.&quot; Terming it &quot;boldly imaginative and [Nolan&#x27;s] most mature work yet&quot;, BBC Culture&#x27;s Caryn James added that it combined the &quot;explosive, commercially-enticing action of &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; trilogy&quot; with the &quot;cerebral underpinnings&quot; of &quot;Memento&quot;, &quot;Inception&quot; and &quot;Tenet&quot;. &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; grossed over $975million worldwide, making it the third-highest-grossing film of 2023. Among the film&#x27;s numerous accolades, Nolan won the Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture.

As of February 2025, Nolan will once again work with Universal Studios on &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, an adaptation of the Ancient Greek epic poem the &quot;Odyssey&quot; by Homer. It is scheduled to be released in July 2026. It follows Odysseus (portrayed by Matt Damon), the legendary Greek king of Ithaca, on his perilous journey to return home following the Trojan War, his encounters with the cyclops Polyphemus, the Sirens, and the witch goddess Circe, and his reunion with his wife, Penelope. With an estimated production budget of $250 million, it is poised to be the most expensive film of Nolan&#x27;s career.

== Personal life and public image ==

Nolan is married to Emma Thomas, whom he met at University College London when he was 19. She has worked as a producer on all of his films since 1997. The couple have four children and reside in Los Angeles.

Nolan prefers to maintain a certain level of mystery about his work. Refusing to discuss his personal life, he feels that too much biographical information about a filmmaker detracts from the experience of his audiences. He stated, &quot;I actually don&#x27;t want people to have me in mind at all when they&#x27;re watching the films.&quot; He does not own a smartphone or have an email address, preferring to hand-deliver his scripts to actors instead and have his wife handle outreach with producers and distributors.

==Filmmaking style==

Nolan&#x27;s films are largely centred in metaphysical themes, exploring the concepts of time, memory and personal identity. His work is characterised by mathematically inspired ideas and images, unconventional narrative structures, materialistic perspectives, and evocative use of music and sound. Filmmaker Guillermo del Toro called Nolan &quot;an emotional mathematician&quot;. BBC&#x27;s arts editor Will Gompertz described him as &quot;an art house auteur making intellectually ambitious blockbuster movies that can leave your pulse racing and your head spinning&quot;. Joseph Bevan wrote, &quot;His films allow arthouse regulars to enjoy superhero flicks and multiplex crowds to engage with labyrinthine plot conceits.&quot; Nolan views himself as &quot;an indie filmmaker working inside the studio system&quot;.
In the sixteen-essay book &quot;The Philosophy of Christopher Nolan&quot;, professional philosophers and writers analysed Nolan&#x27;s work; they identified themes of self-destruction, the nature and value of the truth, and the political mindset of the hero and villain, among others. Robbie B. H. Goh, a professor of English literature, described Nolan as a &quot;philosophical filmmaker&quot; who includes philosophical ideas—existentialism, morality, epistemology and the distinction between appearance and reality—in films that frequently portray suspense, action and violence. Goh appreciated his ability to incorporate such themes in films that possess &quot;elements of the Hollywood blockbuster&quot;—which help keep the audiences engaged—but simultaneously remain &quot;more thoughtful and self-reflexive than the typical consumerist action film&quot;. He further wrote that Nolan&#x27;s body of work reflect &quot;a heterogeneity of conditions of products&quot; extending from low-budget films to lucrative blockbusters, &quot;a wide range of genres and settings&quot; and &quot;a diversity of styles that trumpet his versatility&quot;.

David Bordwell, a film theorist, wrote that Nolan has been able to blend his &quot;experimental impulses&quot; with the demands of mainstream entertainment, describing his oeuvre as &quot;experiments with cinematic time by means of techniques of subjective viewpoint and crosscutting&quot;. Nolan&#x27;s use of practical, in-camera effects, miniatures and models, as well as shooting on celluloid film, has been highly influential in early 21st century cinema. IndieWire wrote in 2019 that Nolan &quot;kept a viable alternate model of big-budget filmmaking alive&quot;, in an era where blockbuster filmmaking has become &quot;a largely computer-generated art form&quot;. Because of Nolan&#x27;s deep involvement in the technical facet of his films, Stuart Joy described him as a &quot;complete filmmaker&quot;, who &quot;oversees all aspects of production while also managing cultural and industrial factors outside of the text&quot;.

== Recognition ==
Nolan has made some of the most influential and popular films of his time. Many of his films have been regarded by critics as among the best of their respective decades, and according to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, his &quot;ability to combine box-office success with artistic ambition has given him an extraordinary amount of clout in the industry&quot;. His films have earned more than $6billion. Nolan&#x27;s films &quot;Memento&quot; and &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; have been selected by the US Library of Congress to be preserved in the National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically&quot; significant. These films and &quot;Inception&quot; appeared in BBC&#x27;s 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century and &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; poll of best films ever made. In 2017, &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;, &quot;Inception&quot; and &quot;Interstellar&quot; featured in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s poll of &quot;The 100 Greatest Movies&quot;. In 2018, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; listed Nolan as one of the 100 most powerful people in entertainment and described him as a &quot;franchise unto himself&quot;. &quot;Parade&quot; ranked Nolan number eight in its 2022 list of 75 Best Movie Directors of All Time.

Nolan&#x27;s work has been as &quot;intensely embraced, analysed and debated by ordinary film fans as by critics and film academics&quot;. Calling him &quot;a persuasively inventive storyteller&quot;, Geoff Andrew of the British Film Institute named Nolan one of the few contemporary filmmakers producing highly personal films within the Hollywood mainstream. Andrew wrote that Nolan&#x27;s films are &quot;not so much [notable] for their considerable technical virtuosity and visual flair as for their brilliant narrative ingenuity and their unusually adult interest in complex philosophical questions&quot;. David Bordwell observed that Nolan is &quot;considered one of the most accomplished living filmmakers&quot;, citing his ability to turn genre movies into both art and event films, as well as his box office numbers, critical acclaim and popularity among cinemagoers. In 2008, Philip French deemed Nolan &quot;the first major talent to emerge this century&quot;. Mark Kermode complimented Nolan for bringing &quot;the discipline and ethics of art-house independent moviemaking and apply[ing] them to Hollywood blockbusters. He&#x27;s living proof that you don&#x27;t have to appeal to the lowest common denominator to be profitable&quot;. &quot;The Observer&quot; Ryan Gilbey described Nolan as a &quot;skillful, stylish storyteller, capable of combining the spectacle of Spielberg with the intellectual intricacy of Nicolas Roeg or Alain Resnais&quot;. Mark Cousins applauded Nolan for embracing big ideas, &quot;Hollywood filmmakers generally shy away from ideas—but not Christopher Nolan&quot;. Scott Foundas of &quot;Variety&quot; declared Nolan &quot;the premier big-canvas storyteller of his generation&quot;, and Justin Chang of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called him &quot;the great proceduralist of 21st century blockbuster filmmaking, a lover of nuts-and-bolts minutiae&quot;.

Nolan has been praised by many of his contemporaries, and his work has influenced them. Kenneth Branagh called Nolan&#x27;s approach to large-scale filmmaking &quot;unique in modern cinema&quot;, adding, &quot;regardless of how popular his movies become, he remains an artist and an auteur. I think for that reason he has become a heroic figure for both the audience and the people working behind the camera.&quot; Michael Mann complimented Nolan for his &quot;singular vision&quot; and credited with &quot;invent[ing] the post-heroic superhero&quot;. Nicolas Roeg said of Nolan, &quot;People talk about &#x27;commercial art&#x27; and the term is usually self-negating; Nolan works in the commercial arena and yet there&#x27;s something very poetic about his work.&quot; Martin Scorsese identified Nolan as a filmmaker creating &quot;beautifully made films on a big scale&quot;.

Damien Chazelle lauded Nolan for his ability &quot;to make the most seemingly impersonal projects—superhero epics, deep-space mind-benders—feel deeply personal&quot;. Discussing the difference between art films and big studio blockbusters, Steven Spielberg referred to Nolan&#x27;s &quot;Dark Knight&quot; series as an example of both; he has described &quot;Memento&quot; and &quot;Inception&quot; as &quot;masterworks&quot;. Denis Villeneuve was impressed by Nolan&#x27;s ability &quot;to keep his identity and create his own universe in that large scope... To bring intellectual concepts and to bring them in that scope to the screen right now—it&#x27;s very rare. Every movie that he comes out with, I have more admiration for his work.&quot; James Cameron expressed disappointment that Nolan was not nominated for an Academy Award as Best Director for &quot;Inception&quot;, calling it &quot;the most astounding piece of film creation and direction of the year, hands down&quot;.

<text>The Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS; ) is a nonprofit consortium that works on the development, convergence, and adoption of projects - both open standards and open source - for computer security, blockchain, Internet of things (IoT), emergency management, cloud computing, legal data exchange, energy, content technologies, and other areas.

== History ==

OASIS was founded under the name &quot;SGML Open&quot; in 1993. It began as a trade association of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) tool vendors to cooperatively promote the adoption of SGML through mainly educational activities, though some amount of technical activity was also pursued including an update of the CALS Table Model specification and specifications for fragment interchange and entity management.

In 1998, with the movement of the industry to XML, SGML Open changed its emphasis from SGML to XML, and changed its name to OASIS Open to be inclusive of XML and reflect an expanded scope of technical work and standards. The focus of the consortium&#x27;s activities also moved from promoting adoption (as XML was getting much attention on its own) to developing technical specifications. In July 2000 a new technical committee process was approved. With the adoption of the process the manner in which technical committees were created, operated, and progressed their work was regularized. At the adoption of the process there were five technical committees; by 2004 there were nearly 70.

During 1999, OASIS was approached by UN/CEFACT, the committee of the United Nations dealing with standards for business, to jointly develop a new set of specifications for electronic business. The joint initiative, called &quot;ebXML&quot; and which first met in November 1999, was chartered for a three-year period. At the final meeting under the original charter, in Vienna, UN/CEFACT and OASIS agreed to divide the remaining work between the two organizations and to coordinate the completion of the work through a coordinating committee. In 2004 OASIS submitted its completed ebXML specifications to ISO TC154 where they were approved as &quot;ISO 15000&quot;.

The consortium has its headquarters in Woburn, Massachusetts, shared with other companies. In December 2020, OASIS moved to its current location, 400 TradeCenter Drive. Previous office locations include 25 Corporate Drive Suite 103 and 35 Corporate Drive, Suite 150, both in Burlington, MA.

== Standards development ==

The following standards are under development or maintained by OASIS technical committees:
* AMQP — Advanced Message Queuing Protocol, an application layer protocol for message-oriented middleware.
* BCM — Business Centric-Methodology, BCM is a comprehensive approach and proven techniques that enable a service-oriented architecture (SOA) and support enterprise agility and interoperability.
* CAM — Content Assembly Mechanism, is a generalized assembly mechanism for using templates of XML business transaction content and the associated rules. CAM templates augment schema syntax and provide implementers with the means to specify interoperable interchange patterns.
* CAMP — Cloud Application Management for Platforms, is an API for managing public and private cloud applications.
* CAP — Common Alerting Protocol, is an XML-based data format for exchanging public warnings and emergencies between alerting technologies.
* CSAF — Common Security Advisory Framework, is the definitive reference for the language which supports creation, update, and interoperable exchange of security advisories as structured information on products, vulnerabilities and the status of impact and remediation among interested parties.
* CDP — Customer Data Platform, is a specification that aims to standardize the exchange of customer data across systems and silos by defining a web-based API using GraphQL.
* CMIS — Content Management Interoperability Services, is a domain model and Web services standard for working with Enterprise content management repositories and systems.
* CIQ — Customer Information Quality, is an XML Specifications for defining, representing, interoperating and managing party information (e.g. name, address).
* DocBook — DocBook, a markup language for technical documentation. It was originally intended for authoring technical documents related to computer hardware and software but it can be used for any other sort of documentation.
* DITA — Darwin Information Typing Architecture, a modular and extensible XML-based language for topic-based information, such as for online help, documentation, and training.
* EML — Election Markup Language, End to End information standards and processes for conducting democratic elections using XML-based information recording.
* EDXL — Emergency Data Exchange Language, Suite of XML-based messaging standards that facilitate emergency information sharing between government entities and the full range of emergency-related organizations
* GeoXACML — Geospatial eXtensible Access Control Markup Language, a geo-specific extension to XACML Version 2.0, mainly the geometric data-type &quot;urn:ogc:def:dataType:geoxacml:1.0:geometry&quot; and several geographic functions such as topological, bag, set, geometric and conversion functions.
* KMIP — The Key Management Interoperability Protocol tries to establish a single, comprehensive protocol for the communication between enterprise key management systems and encryption systems.
* Legal XML Legal Document ML (Akoma Ntoso), LegalRuleML, Electronic Court Filing, and eNotarization standards.
* MQTT — Message Queuing Telemetry Transport, a client-server, publish/subscribe messaging transport protocol. It is lightweight, open, simple, and designed to be easy to implement. These characteristics make it ideal for use in many situations, including constrained environments such as for communication in machine to machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT) contexts where a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium.
* oBIX — open Building Information Exchange, an extensible XML specification for enterprise interaction with building-based (or other) control systems, including HVAC, Access Control, Intrusion Detection, and many others.
*OData — Open Data Protocol (OData), &quot;Simplifying data sharing across disparate applications in enterprise, Cloud, and mobile devices.&quot;
* OpenDocument — OASIS Open Document Format for Office Applications, an open document file format for saving office documents such as spreadsheets, memos, charts, and presentations.
* OSLC — Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration, (OSLC) develops standards that make it easy and practical for software lifecycle tools to share data with one another. 
* PKCS #11 - PKCS #11 standard defines a platform-independent API to cryptographic tokens, such as hardware security modules (HSM) and smart cards, and names the API itself &quot;Cryptoki&quot; (from &quot;cryptographic token interface&quot; and pronounced as &quot;crypto-key&quot; - but &quot;PKCS #11&quot; is often used to refer to the API as well as the standard that defines it).
* SAML — Security Assertion Markup Language, a standard XML-based framework for the secure exchange of authentication and authorization information.
* SARIF - Static Analysis Results Interchange Format, a standard JSON-based format for the output of static analysis tools.
* SDD — Solution Deployment Descriptor, a standard XML-based schema defining a standardized way to express software installation characteristics required for lifecycle management in a multi-platform environment.
* SPML — Service Provisioning Markup Language, a standard XML-based protocol for the integration and interoperation of service provisioning requests.
* STIX - Structured Threat Information eXpression, a language for expressing cyber threat and observable information.
* TAXII - Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information, an application layer protocol for the communication of cyber threat information in a simple and scalable manner. 
* TOSCA — Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications, a Standard to describe cloud services, the relationships between parts of the service, and the operational behavior of the services.
* UBL — Universal Business Language, the international effort to define a royalty-free library of standard electronic business documents (purchase order, invoice, waybill, etc.) in XML. UBL 2.1 was approved as ISO/IEC 19845:2015. UBL serves as the basis for numerous electronic commerce networks and implementations worldwide.
* UDDI — Universal Description Discovery and Integration, a platform-independent, XML-based registry for companies and individuals to list Web Services.

* XLIFF — XML Localization Interchange File Format, a XML-based format created to standardize localization.
* XRI — eXtensible Resource Identifier, a URI-compatible scheme and resolution protocol for abstract identifiers used to identify and share resources across domains and applications.

== Members ==
Adhesion to the consortium requires some fees to be paid, which must be renewed annually, depending on the membership category adherents want to access. Among the adherents are members from Dell, IBM, ISO/IEC, Cisco Systems, KDE e.V., Microsoft, Oracle, Red Hat, The Document Foundation, universities, government agencies, individuals and employees from other less-known companies.

== Member sections ==
Member sections are special interest groups within the consortium that focus on specific topics. These sections keep their own distinguishable identity and have full autonomy to define their work program and agenda. The integration of the member section in the standardization process is organized via the technical committees.

Active member sections are for example:

* Legal XML
* IDTrust

Member sections may be completed when they have achieved their objectives. The standards that they promoted are then maintained by the relevant technical committees directly within OASIS. For example:

* AMQP
* WS-I

== Patent disclosure controversy ==
Like many bodies producing open standards e.g. ECMA, OASIS added a Reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing (RAND) clause to its policy in February 2005. That amendment required participants to disclose intent to apply for software patents for technologies under consideration in the standard. Contrary to the W3C, which requires participants to offer royalty-free licenses to anyone using the resulting standard, OASIS offers a similar Royalty Free on Limited Terms mode, along with a Royalty Free on RAND Terms mode and a RAND (reasonable and non-discriminatory) mode for its committees. Compared to W3C, OASIS is less restrictive regarding obligation to companies to grant a royalty-free license to the patents they own.

Controversy has rapidly arisen because this licensing was added silently and allows publication of standards which could require licensing fee payments to patent holders. This situation could effectively eliminate the possibility of free/open source implementations of these standards. Further, contributors could initially offer royalty-free use of their patent, later imposing per-unit fees, after the standard has been accepted.

On April 11, 2005, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported IBM committed, for free, all of its patents to the OASIS group. Larry Rosen, a software law expert and the leader of the reaction which rose up when OASIS quietly included a RAND clause in its policy, welcomed the initiative and supposed OASIS will not continue using that policy as other companies involved would follow. The RAND policy has still not been removed and other commercial companies have not published such a free statement towards OASIS.

Patrick Gannon, president and CEO of OASIS from 2001 to 2008, minimized the risk that a company could take advantage of a standard to request royalties when it has been established, saying &quot;If it&#x27;s an option nobody uses, then what&#x27;s the harm?&quot;.

Sam Hiser, former marketing lead of the now defunct OpenOffice.org, explained that such patents towards an open standard are counterproductive and inappropriate. He also argued that IBM and Microsoft were shifting their standardization efforts from the W3C to OASIS, in a way to leverage probably their patents portfolio in the future. Hiser also attributed this RAND change to the OASIS policy to Microsoft.

The RAND term could indeed allow any company involved to leverage their patent in the future, but that amendment was probably added in a way to attract more companies to the consortium, and encourage contributions from potential participants. Big actors like Microsoft could have indeed applied pressure and made a sine-qua-non condition to access the consortium, and possibly jeopardize/boycott the standard if such a clause was not present.

== Criticism ==
Doug Mahugh — while working for Microsoft (a promoter of Office Open XML, a Microsoft document format competing with OASIS&#x27;s ISO/IEC 26300, i.e. ODF v1.0) — claimed that &quot;many countries have expressed frustration about the pace of OASIS&#x27;s responses to defect reports that have been submitted on ISO/IEC 26300 and the inability for SC 34 members to participate in the maintenance of ODF.&quot; However, Rob Weir, co-chair of the OASIS ODF Technical Committee noted that at the time, &quot;the ODF TC had received zero defect reports from any ISO/IEC national body other than Japan&quot;. He added that the submitter of the original Japanese defect report, Murata Mokoto, was satisfied with the preparation of the errata. He also self-published a blog post blaming Microsoft of involving people to improve and modify the accuracy of ODF and OpenXML Wikipedia articles.
