<text>In criminology, corporate crime refers to crimes committed either by a corporation (i.e., a business entity having a separate legal personality from the natural persons that manage its activities), or by individuals acting on behalf of a corporation or other business entity (see vicarious liability and corporate liability). For the worst corporate crimes, corporations may face judicial dissolution, sometimes called the &quot;corporate death penalty&quot;, which is a legal procedure in which a corporation is forced to dissolve or cease to exist.

Some negative behaviours by corporations may not actually be criminal; laws vary between jurisdictions. For example, some jurisdictions allow insider trading.

Corporate crime overlaps with:
* white-collar crime, because the majority of individuals who may act as or represent the interests of the corporation are white-collar professionals;
* organized crime, because criminals may set up corporations either for the purposes of crime or as vehicles for laundering the proceeds of crime. The world&#x27;s gross criminal product has been estimated at 20 percent of world trade. (de Brie 2000); and
* state-corporate crime because, in many contexts, the opportunity to commit crime emerges from the relationship between the corporation and the state.

==Definitional issues==
===Legal person===
An 1886 decision of the United States Supreme Court, in &quot;Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad&quot; , has been cited by various courts in the US as precedent to maintaining that a corporation can be defined legally as a &quot;person&quot;, as described in the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The Fourteenth Amendment stipulates that,

In English law, this was matched by the decision in &quot;Salomon v A Salomon &amp; Co Ltd&quot; [1897] AC 22.
In Australian law, under the &quot;Corporations Act 2001 (Cth)&quot;, a corporation is legally a &quot;person&quot;.

===Criminal capacity===
The concepts of crime and punishment, as they apply to individuals, cannot be easily transferred to the corporate domain. International treaties governing corporate malfeasance thus tend to permit but not require corporate criminal liability. Recently a number of countries and the European Union have been working to establish corporate criminal liability for certain offences.
United States law currently recognizes corporate criminal capacity, although it is extremely rare for corporations to be litigated in criminal proceedings.
French law currently recognizes corporate criminal capacity.
German law does not recognize corporate criminal capacity: German corporations are however subject to fining for administrative violations ()

===Enforcement policy===
Corporate crime has become politically sensitive in some countries. In the United Kingdom, for example, following wider publicity of fatal accidents on the rail network and at sea, the term is commonly used in reference to corporate manslaughter and to involve a more general discussion about the technological hazards posed by business enterprises (see Wells: 2001).

In the United States, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was passed to reform business practices, including enhanced corporate responsibility, financial disclosures, and combat fraud, following the highly publicized and extremely harmful (to victims) scandals of Enron, WorldCom, Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers, and Bernie Madoff. Company chief executive officer (CEO) and company chief financial officer (CFO) are required to personally certify financial reports to be accurate and compliant with applicable laws, with criminal penalties for willful misconduct including monetary fines up to $5,000,000 and prison sentence up to 20 years.

The Law Reform Commission of New South Wales offers an explanation of such criminal activities:

Similarly, Russell Mokhiber and Robert Weissman (1999) assert:

== Criminalization ==
Behavior can be regulated by the civil law (including administrative law) or the criminal law. In deciding to criminalize particular behavior, the legislature is making the political judgment that this behavior is sufficiently culpable to deserve the stigma of being labelled as a crime. In law, corporations can commit the same offences as natural persons. Simpson (2002) avers that this process should be straightforward because a state should simply engage in victimology to identify which behavior causes the most loss and damage to its citizens, and then represent the majority view that justice requires the intervention of the criminal law. But states depend on the business sector to deliver a functioning economy, so the politics of regulating the individuals and corporations that supply that stability become more complex. For the views of Marxist criminology, see Snider (1993) and Snider &amp; Pearce (1995), for Left realism, see Pearce &amp; Tombs (1992) and Schulte-Bockholt (2001), and for Right Realism, see Reed &amp; Yeager (1996). More specifically, the historical tradition of sovereign state control of prisons is ending through the process of privatisation. Corporate profitability in these areas therefore depends on building more prison facilities, managing their operations, and selling inmate labor. In turn, this requires a steady stream of prisoners able to work. (Kicenski: 2002)

Bribery and corruption are problems in the developed world, and the corruption of public officials is thought to be a serious problem in developing countries, and an obstacle to development.

Edwin Sutherland&#x27;s definition of white-collar crime also is related to notions of corporate crime. In his landmark definition of white collar crime he offered these categories of crime:
*Misrepresentation in financial statements of corporations
*Manipulation in the stock market
*Commercial bribery
*Bribery of public officials directly or indirectly
*Misrepresentation in advertisement and salesmanship
*Embezzlement and misappropriation of funds
*Misapplication of funds in receiverships and bankruptcies (O&#x27;Grady: 2011).

==Corruption and the private sector review==
One paper discusses some of the issues that arise in the relationship between the private sector and corruption. The findings can be summarized as follows: 
* They present evidence that corruption induces informality by acting as a barrier to entry into the formal sector. Firms that are forced to go underground operate at a smaller scale and are less productive. 
* Corruption also affects the growth of firms in the private sector. This result seems to be independent of the size of the firm. A channel through which corruption may affect the growth prospects of firms is through its negative impact on product innovation. 
* SMEs pay higher bribes as percentage of revenue compared with large companies and bribery seems to be the main form of corruption affecting SMEs. 
* Bribery is not the only form of corruption affecting large firms. Embezzlement by a company&#x27;s own employees, corporate fraud, and insider trading can be very damaging to enterprises too. 
* There is evidence that the private sector has as much responsibility for generating corruption as the public sector. Particular situations such as state capture can be very damaging for the economy. 
* Corruption is a symptom of poor governance. Governance can only be improved via coordinated efforts among governments, businesses, civil society.

==Organi-cultural deviance==
Organi-cultural deviance is a recent philosophical model used in academia and corporate criminology that views corporate crime as a body of social, behavioral, and environmental processes leading to deviant acts. This view of corporate crime differs from that of Edwin Sutherland (1949), who referred to corporate crime as &quot;white-collar crime&quot;, in that Sutherland viewed corporate crime as something done by an individual as an isolated end unto itself. With the Organi-cultural deviance view, corporate crime can be engaged in by individuals, groups, organizations, and groups of organizations, all within an organizational context. This view also takes into account micro and macro social, environmental, and personality factors, using a holistic systems approach to understanding the causation of corporate crime.

The term derives its meaning from the words &quot;organization&quot; (a structured unit) and &quot;culture&quot; (the set of shared attitudes, values, goals, and practices). This reflects the view that corporate cultures may encourage or accept deviant behaviors that differ from what is normal or accepted in the broader society. Organi-cultural deviance explains the deviant behaviors (defined by societal norms) engaged in by individuals or groups of individuals.

Because corporate crime has often been seen as an understudy of common crime and criminology, it is only recently that the study of corporate crime has been included in coursework and degree programs directly related to criminal justice, business management, and organizational psychology. This is partly due to a lack of an official definition for crimes committed in the context of organizations and corporations.

The social philosophical study of common crime gained recognition through Cesare Beccaria during the 18th century, when Beccaria was heralded as the Father of the Classical School of Criminology.

However, corporate crime was not officially recognized as an independent area of study until Edwin Sutherland provided a definition of &quot;white-collar crime&quot; in 1949. Sutherland in 1949, argued to the American Sociological Society the need to expand the boundaries of the study of crime to include the criminal act of respectable individuals in the course of their occupation.

In 2008, Christie Husted found corporate crime to be a complex dynamic of system-level processes, personality traits, macro-environmental, and social influences, requiring a holistic approach to studying corporate crime. Husted, in her 2008 doctoral thesis, &quot;Systematic Differentiation Between Dark and Light Leaders: Is a Corporate Criminal Profile Possible?&quot;, coined the term &quot;organi-cultural deviance&quot; to explain these social, situational and environmental factors giving rise to corporate crime.

===Application===
Renée Gendron and Christie Husted, through their research conducted in 2008-2012, expanded the concept of organi-cultural deviance, in papers presented at the Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences conference Toronto, Canada, the American Association of Behavioral and Social Sciences Annual Conference, Las Vegas, Nevada, the General Meeting of the Administrative Sciences Association of Canada, in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada, and The Humanities conference in Montréal, Canada. The term organi-cultural deviance incorporated the terms group think, and yes-men, to explain decision-related cognitive impairments inherent of corporations engaging in corporate crime. The researchers have found several interconnected dynamics that increase the likelihood of white-collar crime. The researchers have found specific group dynamics involved in white-collar crime are similar to the group dynamics present in gangs, organized crime organizations as well as cults. Moreover, the researchers have found that there are systems-level forces influencing the behaviors and cognitions of individuals.

The subject of organi-cultural deviance was first taught in business management, leadership classes, and in a class titled &quot;Corporate Misconduct&quot; in America, at Casper College during 2008-2009. Organi-cultural deviance was introduced to students as a social philosophical term used to help describe, explain, and understand the complex social, behavioral, and environmental forces, that lead organizations to engage in corporate crime.

===Social dynamics===
The term organi-cultural deviance was later expanded and published in a 2011 paper titled &quot;Socialization of Individuals into Deviant Corporate Culture&quot;. Organi-cultural deviance was used to describe how processes of individual and group socialization, within deviant corporate cultures, serve to invert Abraham Maslow&#x27;s (1954) &quot;Hierarchy of Needs&quot; into a theoretical &quot;Hierarchical Funnel of Individual Needs&quot;.

Organi-cultural deviance was further explored by Gendron and Husted, using a micro-environmental approach, identifying social dynamics within deviant organizations believed to lure and capture individuals. However, through the social processes inherent of organi-cultural deviance, social pressures and influences force the individual to vacate aspirations to reach self-actualization and become complacent on satisfying lower needs, such as belongingness. In organi-cultural deviance, social dynamics and micro-environmental forces are believed, by Gendron and Husted, to result in the individual&#x27;s dependence upon the organization for their basic needs.

Organizations engaging in organi-cultural deviance use manipulation and a façade of honesty, with promises of meeting the individual&#x27;s needs of self-actualization. The social forces such as the use of physical and psychological violence to maintain compliance with organizational goals within deviant organizations secure the individual&#x27;s dependence upon the organization for satisfaction of their basic needs. As the process of organi-cultural deviance escalates, the complacency to meet mid-level needs becomes a dependency on the organization to satisfy the lower needs of the pyramid, the individual&#x27;s basic needs. In the paper &quot;Using Gang and Cult Typologies to Understand Corporate Crimes, Gendron and Husted&quot; found organizations engaging in organi-cultural deviance used coercive power, monetary, physical and/or psychological threats, to maintain their gravitational hold on the individual.

In the 2011 paper, &quot;Using Gang and Cult Typologies to Understand Corporate Crimes&quot;, organi-cultural deviance was used to compare the cultures of: mafias, cults, gangs and deviant corporations, each of which was assumed to be a type of deviant organization. In these types of organizations, organi-cultural deviance was found to be present. In engaging in organi-cultural deviance, these organizations leverage four resources: information, violence, reputation and publicity. These types of organizations engaging in organi-cultural deviance were found to contain toxic leadership. Deviant organizations, engaging in organi-cultural deviance, were found to leverage their reputation through publicity to attract members. The combination of adverse psychological forces, combined with the real need for its employees to survive (earn a living, avoid bullying) act as a type of organizational gravitational pull. The concept of organi-cultural deviance includes both micro (personal, psychological or otherwise internal forces exercising influence over an individual&#x27;s behavior) and macro influences (group dynamics, organizational culture, inter-organizational forces as well as system pressures and constraints, such as a legal system or overall economic environment).

===Environmental influences===
In a 2012 paper titled &quot;Organi-cultural Deviance: Economic Cycles Predicting Corporate Misconduct?&quot;, Gendron and Husted found economic cycles result in strain, seen as a precipitating factor in organi-cultural deviance. Organi-cultural deviance is based on the premise social pressure and economic forces exert strain on organizations to engage in corporate crime. Strain creates motivating tension in organi-cultural deviance. Robert Merton championed strain theorists in the field of criminology, believing there to be &quot;a universal set of goals toward which all Americans, regardless of background and position, strive, chief among these is monetary success&quot;. Economic cycles result in observable patterns which are indicative of organi-cultural deviance.

Organi-cultural deviance is likely to occur at different points in an economic cycle and system. The specific location of an economy in the economic cycle tends to generate specific kinds of leaders. Entrepreneurial leaders tend to be most visible at the bottom of an economic cycle, during a depression or recession. Entrepreneurial leaders are able to motivate their employees to innovate and develop new products. As the economy strengthens, there is a marked increase of bureaucratic leaders who standardise and operationalise the successes of entrepreneurial leaders. As the economy reaches the apex of the economic cycle, pseudo-transformational leaders are likely to emerge, promising the same, if not higher, rates of return in a booming or peaking economy. Often, these pseudo-transformational leaders engage in deviant practices to maintain the illusion of rising rates of return.

<doc id="178755" wikidata="Q76611" url="?curid=178755" title="Nonviolence">
<text>Nonviolence is the personal practice of not causing harm to others under any condition. It may come from the belief that hurting people, animals and/or the environment is unnecessary to achieve an outcome and it may refer to a general philosophy of abstention from violence. It may be based on moral, religious or spiritual principles, or the reasons for it may be strategic or pragmatic. Failure to distinguish between the two types of nonviolent approaches can lead to distortion in the concept&#x27;s meaning and effectiveness, which can subsequently result in confusion among the audience. Although both principled and pragmatic nonviolent approaches preach for nonviolence, they may have distinct motives, goals, philosophies, and techniques. However, rather than debating the best practice between the two approaches, both can indicate alternative paths for those who do not want to use violence. 

Nonviolence has &quot;active&quot; or &quot;activist&quot; elements, in that believers generally accept the need for nonviolence as a means to achieve political and social change. Thus, for example, Tolstoyan and Gandhism nonviolence is both a philosophy and strategy for social change that rejects the use of violence, but at the same time it sees nonviolent action (also called civil resistance) as an alternative to passive acceptance of oppression or armed struggle against it. In general, advocates of an activist philosophy of nonviolence use diverse methods in their campaigns for social change, including critical forms of education and persuasion, mass noncooperation, civil disobedience, nonviolent direct action, constructive program, and social, political, cultural and economic forms of intervention.

In modern times, nonviolent methods have been a powerful tool for social protest and revolutionary social and political change. There are many examples of their use. Fuller surveys may be found in the entries on civil resistance, nonviolent resistance and nonviolent revolution. Certain movements which were particularly influenced by a philosophy of nonviolence have included Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s leadership of a successful decades-long nonviolent struggle for Indian independence, Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s and James Bevel&#x27;s adoption of Gandhi&#x27;s nonviolent methods in their Civil rights movement campaigns to remove legalized segregation in America, and César Chávez&#x27;s campaigns of nonviolence in the 1960s to protest the treatment of Mexican farm workers in California. The 1989 &quot;Velvet Revolution&quot; in Czechoslovakia that saw the overthrow of the Communist government is considered one of the most important of the largely nonviolent Revolutions of 1989. Most recently the nonviolent campaigns of Leymah Gbowee and the women of Liberia were able to achieve peace after a 14-year civil war. This story is captured in a 2008 documentary film &quot;Pray the Devil Back to Hell&quot;.

The term &quot;nonviolence&quot; is often linked with peace or used as a synonym for it. Despite the fact that it is frequently equated with pacifism, this equation is at times rejected by nonviolent advocates and activists. Nonviolence specifically refers to the absence of violence and the choice to do no harm in deed, speech, or intent. For example, if a house is burning down with mice or insects in it, the most harmless appropriate action is to put the fire out, not to sit by and passively and let the fire burn. A confused person may advocate nonviolence in a specific context while advocating violence in others. For example, someone who passionately opposes abortion or meat eating may concurrently advocate violence to kill an abortion care provider or attack a slaughterhouse, which makes that person a violent person.

==Origins==

Nonviolence or &quot;ahimsa&quot; is one of the cardinal virtues and an important tenet of Jainism, Buddhism, and Hinduism. Jain and Buddhist thoughts have explored nonviolence very deeply, not limiting it to humans but extending it to the animal world as well as nature, in a very explicit fashion. In Jainism, it is the very core idea of very &#x27;way of life&#x27; practicing it in mun (thoughts), vachan (spoken word) and karm (action). It is a multidimensional concept, inspired by the premise that all living beings have the spark of the divine spiritual energy; therefore, to hurt another being is to hurt oneself. It has also been related to the notion that any violence has karmic consequences. While ancient scholars of Hinduism pioneered and over time perfected the principles of &quot;ahimsa&quot;, the concept reached an extraordinary status in the ethical philosophy of Jainism.

==Etymology==

According to historian David Hardiman, the English term &quot;nonviolence&quot; first appeared in Britain and the United States in the 19th century as a medical term. Before the Gandhian era, there was only one recorded instance, almost coincidental, of the term &quot;nonviolence&quot; being used as a political concept, which appeared in a Wisconsin newspaper published in 1914. The term spread globally during India&#x27;s first Non-cooperation movement (1919–1922), gaining recognition as a distinct concept. E. Hazama conducted the first comprehensive analysis of Gandhi&#x27;s writings in three languages (Gujarati, Hindi, and English) from three versions of Gandhi&#x27;s Collected Works: &quot;Gāndhījīnō Aksharadēha&quot; (ગાંધીજીનો અક્ષરદેહ), &quot;Sampūrn Gāndhī Vāngmay&quot; (सम्पूर्ण गाँधी वांग्मय), and &quot;Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi&quot;. This analysis revealed that Gandhi began linking the Satyagraha movement with the Gujarati/Hindi term &quot;ahimsa&quot; (અહિંસા/अहिंसा) only after 1915. Furthermore, Gandhi started adopting the English term &quot;nonviolence&quot; only after the Rowlatt Satyagraha in 1919. Before Gandhi, scholars of Oriental studies translated the Sanskrit term &quot;ahimsa&quot; as &quot;non-killing&quot; or &quot;non-injury,&quot; but never as &quot;non-violence.&quot; Thus, &quot;nonviolence&quot; represents a modern concept that emerged in the context of Gandhi&#x27;s political movement.

==Forms of nonviolence==
In the political realm, advocates of nonviolent action believe cooperation and consent are the roots of civil or political power: all regimes, including bureaucratic institutions, financial institutions, and the armed segments of society (such as the military and police); depend on compliance from citizens. On a national level, the strategy of nonviolent action seeks to challenge the power misuse of rulers by organising and encouraging (oppressed) people to withdraw their consent and cooperation. The forms of nonviolence draw inspiration from both religious or ethical beliefs and political analysis. Religious or ethically based nonviolence is sometimes referred to as &quot;principled,&quot; &quot;philosophical,&quot; or &quot;ethical&quot; nonviolence, while nonviolence based on political analysis is often referred to as &quot;tactical,&quot; &quot;strategic,&quot; or &quot;pragmatic&quot; nonviolent action. Commonly, both of these dimensions may be present within the thinking of particular movements or individuals.
===Pragmatic===
The fundamental concept of &quot;pragmatic&quot; (&quot;tactical&quot; or &quot;strategic&quot;) nonviolent action is to create a social dynamic or political movement that can project a national and global dialogue that affects social change without necessarily winning over those who wish to maintain the status quo. Gene Sharp promoted the pragmatic nonviolence approach. Sharp was an American political scientist known for his nonviolent struggle work. Those who follow Sharp&#x27;s pragmatic nonviolence approach believe in practicality rather than the moral aspect of the struggle. They believe that violence is too costly to engage in. The goals are to change their oppressor&#x27;s behavior; end a specific injustice or violent situation; and seek a win for themselves, while opponents they perceive as enemies with conflicting interests should lose. Conflict is seen as inevitable, and the rejection of violence is an effective way to challenge power. Those who follow pragmatic nonviolence ideology are willing to engage in nonviolent coercion, and try to avoid suffering.

Nicolas Walter noted the idea that nonviolence might work &quot;runs under the surface of Western political thought without ever quite disappearing&quot;. Walter noted Étienne de La Boétie&#x27;s &quot;Discourse on Voluntary Servitude&quot; (sixteenth century) and P.B. Shelley&#x27;s &quot;The Masque of Anarchy&quot; (1819) contain arguments for resisting tyranny without using violence. In 1838, William Lloyd Garrison helped found the New England Non-Resistance Society, a society devoted to achieving racial and gender equality through the rejection of all violent actions.

In modern industrial democracies, nonviolent action has been used extensively by political sectors without mainstream political power such as labor, peace, environment and women&#x27;s movements. Lesser known is the role that nonviolent action has played and continues to play in undermining the power of repressive political regimes in the developing world and the former eastern bloc. Susan Ives emphasizes this point by quoting Walter Wink: 

As a technique for social struggle, nonviolent action has been described as &quot;the politics of ordinary people&quot;, reflecting its historically mass-based use by populations throughout the world and history.

Movements most often associated with nonviolence are the non-cooperation campaign for Indian independence led by Mahatma Gandhi, the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, and the People Power Revolution in the Philippines.

Also of primary significance is the notion that just means are the most likely to lead to just ends. When Gandhi said that &quot;the means may be likened to the seed, the end to a tree,&quot; he expressed the philosophical kernel of what some refer to as &quot;prefigurative politics&quot;. Martin Luther King Jr., a student of Gandhian nonviolent resistance, concurred with this tenet, concluding that &quot;nonviolence demands that the means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek.&quot; Proponents of nonviolence reason that the actions taken in the present inevitably re-shape the social order in like form. They would argue, for instance, that it is fundamentally irrational to use violence to achieve a peaceful society.

Respect or love for opponents also has a pragmatic justification, in that the technique of separating the deeds from the doers allows for the possibility of the doers changing their behaviour, and perhaps their beliefs. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote, &quot;Nonviolent resistance... avoids not only external physical violence but also internal violence of spirit. The nonviolent resister not only refuses to shoot his opponent, but he also refuses to hate him.&quot;

Nonviolence has obtained a level of institutional recognition and endorsement at the global level. On November 10, 1998, the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed the first decade of the 21st century and the third millennium, the years 2001 to 2010, as the International Decade for the Promotion of a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World.

===Principled===

The nonviolence approach involves accepting that violence is wrong and nonviolence is the best ethical response to any conflict. The followers of this approach believe in human harmony and a moral rejection of violence and coercion. They accept the total commitment to nonviolence and encourage those who want to use nonviolent actions to reject all forms of violence and coercion. Principled nonviolence has a religious or ideological basis. This type of nonviolence aims to change the opponent&#x27;s heart and mind by showing love to them rather than hatred, partnering with the opponents to bring about social change by ending all violence and social injustices, and seeking a solution whereby all parties win. The techniques they use include persuasion while trying to avoid coercion, and they accept that suffering is part of the means to transform themselves and others.

For many, practicing nonviolence goes deeper than abstaining from violent behavior or words. It means overriding the impulse to be hateful and holding love for everyone, even those with whom one strongly disagrees. In this view, because violence is learned, it is necessary to unlearn violence by practicing love and compassion at every possible opportunity. For some, the commitment to non-violence entails a belief in restorative or transformative justice, an abolition of the death penalty and other harsh punishments. This may involve the necessity of caring for those who are violent.

Nonviolence, for many, involves a respect and reverence for all sentient, and perhaps even non-sentient, beings. This might include abolitionism against animals as property, the practice of not eating animal products or by-products (vegetarianism or veganism), spiritual practices of non-harm to all beings, and caring for the rights of all beings. Mahatma Gandhi, James Bevel, and other nonviolent proponents advocated vegetarianism as part of their nonviolent philosophy. Buddhists extend this respect for life to animals and plants, while Jainism extend this respect for life to animals, plants and even small organisms such as insects. The classical Indian text of the Tirukkuṛaḷ, which is believed to be of Hindu or Jain origin, decrees ahimsa and moral vegetarianism as the most fundamental of all personal virtues. These ideas can also be found in Western mystical and Neoplatonic traditions.

In modern times, several scholars have endeavored to clarify the theoretical intellectual foundations for principled nonviolence and the manner in which such principles might be implemented in practical terms. Included among them are Kevin P. Clements and Robert L. Holmes.

Mahatma Gandhi was one of the most well-known advocates for and practitioners of principled nonviolence. 
==== Semai people ====

The Semai ethnic group living in the center of the Malay Peninsula in Southeast Asia are known for their nonviolence. The Semai punan ethical or religious principle strongly pressures members of the culture towards nonviolent, non-coercive, and non-competitive behaviour. It has been suggested that the Semai&#x27;s non-violence is a response to historic threats from slaving states; as the Semai were constantly defeated by slavers and Malaysian immigrants, they preferred to flee rather than fight and thus evolved into a general norm of non-violence. This does not mean the Semai are incapable of violence however; during the Malayan Emergency, the British enlisted some Semai to fight against MNLA insurgents and according to Robert Knox Dentan the Semai believe that as Malaysia industrialises, it will be harder for the Semai to use their strategy of fleeing and they will have to fight instead.

===Religious===
====Hinduism====

=====Ancient Vedic texts=====
Ahimsa as an ethical concept evolved in Vedic texts. The oldest scripts, along with discussing ritual animal sacrifices, indirectly mention Ahimsa, but do not emphasise it. Over time, the Hindu scripts revise ritual practices and the concept of Ahimsa is increasingly refined and emphasised, ultimately Ahimsa becomes the highest virtue by the late Vedic era (about 500 BCE). For example, hymn 10.22.25 in the Rig Veda uses the words Satya (truthfulness) and Ahimsa in a prayer to deity Indra; later, the Yajur Veda dated to be between 1000 BCE and 600 BCE, states, &quot;may all beings look at me with a friendly eye, may I do likewise, and may we look at each other with the eyes of a friend&quot;.

The term &quot;Ahimsa&quot; appears in the text Taittiriya Shakha of the Yajurveda (TS 5.2.8.7), where it refers to non-injury to the sacrificer himself. It occurs several times in the &quot;Shatapatha Brahmana&quot; in the sense of &quot;non-injury&quot;. The Ahimsa doctrine is a late Vedic era development in Brahmanical culture. The earliest reference to the idea of non-violence to animals (&quot;pashu-Ahimsa&quot;), apparently in a moral sense, is in the Kapisthala Katha Samhita of the Yajurveda (KapS 31.11), which may have been written in about the 8th century BCE.

Bowker states the word appears but is uncommon in the principal Upanishads. Kaneda gives examples of the word &quot;Ahimsa&quot; in these Upanishads. Other scholars suggest &quot;Ahimsa&quot; as an ethical concept that started evolving in the Vedas, becoming an increasingly central concept in Upanishads.

The Chāndogya Upaniṣad, dated to the 8th or 7th century BCE, one of the oldest Upanishads, has the earliest evidence for the Vedic era use of the word &quot;Ahimsa&quot; in the sense familiar in Hinduism (a code of conduct). It bars violence against &quot;all creatures&quot; (&quot;sarvabhuta&quot;) and the practitioner of Ahimsa is said to escape from the cycle of rebirths (CU 8.15.1). Some scholars state that this 8th or 7th-century BCE mention may have been an influence of Jainism on Vedic Hinduism. Others scholar state that this relationship is speculative, and though Jainism is an ancient tradition the oldest traceable texts of Jainism tradition are from many centuries after the Vedic era ended.

Chāndogya Upaniṣad also names Ahimsa, along with Satyavacanam (truthfulness), Arjavam (sincerity), Danam (charity), Tapo (penance/meditation), as one of five essential virtues (CU 3.17.4).

The Sandilya Upanishad lists ten forbearances: Ahimsa, Satya, Asteya, Brahmacharya, Daya, Arjava, Kshama, Dhriti, Mitahara and Saucha. According to Kaneda, the term Ahimsa is an important spiritual doctrine shared by Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. It literally means &#x27;non-injury&#x27; and &#x27;non-killing&#x27;. It implies the total avoidance of harming of any kind of living creatures not only by deeds, but also by words and in thoughts.

=====The Epics=====
The &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, one of the epics of Hinduism, has multiple mentions of the phrase &quot;Ahimsa Paramo Dharma&quot; (अहिंसा परमॊ धर्मः), which literally means: non-violence is the highest moral virtue. For example, Mahaprasthanika Parva has the verse:
&lt;poem&gt;
अहिंसा परमो धर्मस् तथाहिंसा परो दमः।
अहिंसा परमं दानम् अहिंसा परमस् तपः।
अहिंसा परमो यज्ञस् तथाहिंसा परं बलम्।
अहिंसा परमं मित्रम् अहिंसा परमं सुखम्।
अहिंसा परमं सत्यम् अहिंसा परमं श्रुतम्॥
&lt;/poem&gt;
The above passage from &quot;Mahabharata&quot; emphasises the cardinal importance of Ahimsa in Hinduism, and literally means: Ahimsa is the highest virtue, Ahimsa is the highest self-control, Ahimsa is the greatest gift, Ahimsa is the best suffering, Ahimsa is the highest sacrifice, Ahimsa is the finest strength, Ahimsa is the greatest friend, Ahimsa is the greatest happiness, Ahimsa is the highest truth, and Ahimsa is the greatest teaching. Some other examples where the phrase &quot;Ahimsa Paramo Dharma&quot; are discussed include Adi Parva, Vana Parva and Anushasana Parva. The Bhagavad Gita, among other things, discusses the doubts and questions about appropriate response when one faces systematic violence or war. These verses develop the concepts of lawful violence in self-defence and the theories of just war. However, there is no consensus on this interpretation. Gandhi, for example, considers this debate about nonviolence and lawful violence as a mere metaphor for the internal war within each human being, when he or she faces moral questions.

=====Self-defence, criminal law, and war=====
The classical texts of Hinduism devote numerous chapters discussing what people who practice the virtue of Ahimsa, can and must do when they are faced with war, violent threat or need to sentence someone convicted of a crime. These discussions have led to theories of just war, theories of reasonable self-defence and theories of proportionate punishment. Arthashastra discusses, among other things, why and what constitutes proportionate response and punishment.

;War
The precepts of Ahimsa under Hinduism require that war must be avoided, with sincere and truthful dialogue. Force must be the last resort. If war becomes necessary, its cause must be just, its purpose virtuous, its objective to restrain the wicked, its aim peace, its method lawful. War can only be started and stopped by a legitimate authority. Weapons used must be proportionate to the opponent and the aim of war, not indiscriminate tools of destruction. All strategies and weapons used in the war must be to defeat the opponent, not designed to cause misery to the opponent; for example, use of arrows is allowed, but use of arrows smeared with painful poison is not allowed. Warriors must use judgment in the battlefield. Cruelty to the opponent during war is forbidden. Wounded, unarmed opponent warriors must not be attacked or killed, they must be brought to your realm and given medical treatment. Children, women and civilians must not be injured. While the war is in progress, sincere dialogue for peace must continue.

;Self-defence
In matters of self-defence, different interpretations of ancient Hindu texts have been offered. For example, Tähtinen suggests self-defence is appropriate, criminals are not protected by the rule of Ahimsa, and Hindu scriptures support the use of violence against an armed attacker. Ahimsa is not meant to imply pacifism.

Alternate theories of self-defence, inspired by Ahimsa, build principles similar to theories of just war. Aikido, pioneered in Japan, illustrates one such principles of self-defence. Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of Aikido, described his inspiration as Ahimsa. According to this interpretation of Ahimsa in self-defence, one must not assume that the world is free of aggression. One must presume that some people will, out of ignorance, error or fear, attack other persons or intrude into their space, physically or verbally. The aim of self-defence, suggested Ueshiba, must be to neutralise the aggression of the attacker, and avoid the conflict. The best defence is one where the victim is protected, as well as the attacker is respected and not injured if possible. Under Ahimsa and Aikido, there are no enemies, and appropriate self-defence focuses on neutralising the immaturity, assumptions and aggressive strivings of the attacker.

; Criminal law
Tähtinen concludes that Hindus have no misgivings about death penalty; their position is that evil-doers who deserve death should be killed, and that a king in particular is obliged to punish criminals and should not hesitate to kill them, even if they happen to be his own brothers and sons.

Other scholars conclude that the scriptures of Hinduism suggest sentences for any crime must be fair, proportional and not cruel.

=====Non-human life=====
The Hindu precept of &#x27;cause no injury&#x27; applies to animals and all life forms. This precept isn&#x27;t found in the oldest verses of Vedas, but increasingly becomes one of the central ideas between 500 BC and 400 AD. In the oldest texts, numerous ritual sacrifices of animals, including cows and horses, are highlighted and hardly any mention is made of Ahimsa to non-human life.

Hindu scriptures, dated to between 5th century and 1st century BC, while discussing human diet, initially suggest &quot;kosher&quot; meat may be eaten, evolving it with the suggestion that only meat obtained through ritual sacrifice can be eaten, then that one should eat no meat because it hurts animals, with verses describing the noble life as one that lives on flowers, roots and fruits alone.

Later texts of Hinduism declare Ahimsa one of the primary virtues, declare any killing or harming any life as against &quot;dharma&quot; (moral life). Finally, the discussion in Upanishads and Hindu Epics shifts to whether a human being can ever live his or her life without harming animal and plant life in some way; which and when plants or animal meat may be eaten, whether violence against animals causes human beings to become less compassionate, and if and how one may exert least harm to non-human life consistent with ahimsa precept, given the constraints of life and human needs. The Mahabharata permits hunting by warriors, but opposes it in the case of hermits who must be strictly nonviolent. Sushruta Samhita, a Hindu text written in the 3rd or 4th century, in Chapter XLVI suggests proper diet as a means of treating certain illnesses, and recommends various fishes and meats for different ailments and for pregnant women, and the Charaka Samhita describes meat as superior to all other kinds of food for convalescents.

Across the texts of Hinduism, there is a profusion of ideas about the virtue of Ahimsa when applied to non-human life, but without a universal consensus. Alsdorf claims the debate and disagreements between supporters of vegetarian lifestyle and meat eaters was significant. Even suggested exceptions – ritual slaughter and hunting – were challenged by advocates of Ahimsa. In the Mahabharata both sides present various arguments to substantiate their viewpoints. Moreover, a hunter defends his profession in a long discourse.

Many of the arguments proposed in favor of non-violence to animals refer to the bliss one feels, the rewards it entails before or after death, the danger and harm it prevents, as well as to the karmic consequences of violence.

The ancient Hindu texts discuss Ahimsa and non-animal life. They discourage wanton destruction of nature including of wild and cultivated plants. Hermits (sannyasins) were urged to live on a fruitarian diet so as to avoid the destruction of plants. Scholars claim the principles of ecological non-violence is innate in the Hindu tradition, and its conceptual fountain has been Ahimsa as their cardinal virtue.

The dharmic philosophy of ancient India exists in all Indian languages and culture. For example, the &quot;Tirukkuṛaḷ,&quot; written between 200 BCE and 500 CE, and sometimes called the Tamil Veda, is one of the most cherished classics written in a South Indian language. The &quot;Tirukkuṛaḷ&quot; dedicates Chapters 26, 32 and 33 of Book 1 to the virtue of ahimsa, namely, moral vegetarianism, non-harming, and non-killing, respectively. The &quot;Tirukkuṛaḷ&quot; says that ahimsa applies to all life forms.

====Jainism====

In Jainism, the understanding and implementation of &quot;Ahimsā&quot; is more radical, scrupulous, and comprehensive than in any other religion. Killing any living being out of passions is considered &quot;hiṃsā&quot; (to injure) and abstaining from such an act is &quot;ahimsā&quot; (noninjury). The vow of ahimsā is considered the foremost among the &#x27;five vows of Jainism&#x27;. Other vows like truth (Satya) are meant for safeguarding the vow of ahimsā. In the practice of Ahimsa, the requirements are less strict for the lay persons (sravakas) who have undertaken &quot;anuvrata&quot; (Smaller Vows) than for the Jain monastics who are bound by the Mahavrata &quot;Great Vows&quot;. The statement &quot;&quot; is often found inscribed on the walls of the Jain temples. Like in Hinduism, the aim is to prevent the accumulation of harmful karma. When lord Mahaviraswami revived and reorganized the Jain faith in the 6th or 5th century BCE, Rishabhanatha (Ādinātha), the first Jain Tirthankara, whom modern Western historians consider to be a historical figure, followed by Parshvanatha (Pārśvanātha) the twenty-third Tirthankara lived in about the 8th century BCE. He founded the community to which Mahavira&#x27;s parents belonged. Ahimsa was already part of the &quot;Fourfold Restraint&quot; (&quot;Caujjama&quot;), the vows taken by Parshva&#x27;s followers. In the times of Mahavira and in the following centuries, Jains were at odds with both Buddhists and followers of the Vedic religion or Hindus, whom they accused of negligence and inconsistency in the implementation of Ahimsa. According to the Jain tradition either lacto vegetarianism or veganism is mandatory.

The Jain concept of Ahimsa is characterised by several aspects. It does not make any exception for ritual sacrificers and professional warrior-hunters. Killing of animals for food is absolutely ruled out. Jains also make considerable efforts not to injure plants in everyday life as far as possible. Though they admit that plants must be destroyed for the sake of food, they accept such violence only inasmuch as it is indispensable for human survival, and there are special instructions for preventing unnecessary violence against plants. Jains go out of their way so as not to hurt even small insects and other minuscule animals. For example, Jains often do not go out at night, when they are more likely to step upon an insect. In their view, injury caused by carelessness is like injury caused by deliberate action. Eating honey is strictly outlawed, as it would amount to violence against the bees. Some Jains abstain from farming because it inevitably entails unintentional killing or injuring of many small animals, such as worms and insects, but agriculture is not forbidden in general and there are Jain farmers.

Theoretically, all life forms are said to deserve full protection from all kinds of injury, but Jains recognise a hierarchy of life. Mobile beings are given higher protection than immobile ones. For the mobile beings, they distinguish between one-sensed, two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed and five-sensed ones; a one-sensed animal has touch as its only sensory modality. The more senses a being has, the more they care about non-injuring it. Among the five-sensed beings, the precept of non-injury and non-violence to the rational ones (humans) is strongest in Jain Ahimsa.

Jains agree with Hindus that violence in self-defence can be justified, and they agree that a soldier who kills enemies in combat is performing a legitimate duty. Jain communities accepted the use of military power for their defence, there were Jain monarchs, military commanders, and soldiers.

====Buddhism====

In Buddhist texts &quot;Ahimsa&quot; (or its Pāli cognate ) is part of the Five Precepts (), the first of which has been to abstain from killing. This precept of Ahimsa is applicable to both the Buddhist layperson and the monk community.

The Ahimsa precept is not a commandment and transgressions did not invite religious sanctions for layperson, but their power has been in the Buddhist belief in karmic consequences and their impact in afterlife during rebirth. Killing, in Buddhist belief, could lead to rebirth in the hellish realm, and for a longer time in more severe conditions if the murder victim was a monk. Saving animals from slaughter for meat, is believed to be a way to acquire merit for better rebirth. These moral precepts have been voluntarily self-enforced in lay Buddhist culture through the associated belief in karma and rebirth. The Buddhist texts not only recommended Ahimsa, but suggest avoiding trading goods that contribute to or are a result of violence:

Unlike lay Buddhists, transgressions by monks do invite sanctions. Full expulsion of a monk from &quot;sangha&quot; follows instances of killing, just like any other serious offense against the monastic &quot;nikaya&quot; code of conduct.

=====War=====
Violent ways of punishing criminals and prisoners of war was not explicitly condemned in Buddhism, but peaceful ways of conflict resolution and punishment with the least amount of injury were encouraged. The early texts condemn the mental states that lead to violent behavior.

Nonviolence is an overriding theme within the Pali Canon. While the early texts condemn killing in the strongest terms, and portray the ideal king as a pacifist, such a king is nonetheless flanked by an army. It seems that the Buddha&#x27;s teaching on nonviolence was not interpreted or put into practice in an uncompromisingly pacifist or anti-military-service way by early Buddhists. The early texts assume war to be a fact of life, and well-skilled warriors are viewed as necessary for defensive warfare. In Pali texts, injunctions to abstain from violence and involvement with military affairs are directed at members of the sangha; later Mahayana texts, which often generalise monastic norms to laity, require this of lay people as well.

The early texts do not contain just-war ideology as such. Some argue that a sutta in the &quot;Gamani Samyuttam&quot; rules out all military service. In this passage, a soldier asks the Buddha if it is true that, as he has been told, soldiers slain in battle are reborn in a heavenly realm. The Buddha reluctantly replies that if he is killed in battle while his mind is seized with the intention to kill, he will undergo an unpleasant rebirth. In the early texts, a person&#x27;s mental state at the time of death is generally viewed as having a great impact on the next birth.

Some Buddhists point to other early texts as justifying defensive war. One example is the &quot;Kosala Samyutta&quot;, in which King Pasenadi of Kosala, a righteous king favored by the Buddha, learns of an impending attack on his kingdom. He arms himself in defence, and leads his army into battle to protect his kingdom from attack. He lost this battle but won the war. King Pasenadi eventually defeated Emperor Ajatashatru of Magadha and captured him alive. He thought that, although this Emperor of Magadha has transgressed against his kingdom, he had not transgressed against him personally, and Ajatashatru was still his nephew. He released Ajatashatru and did not harm him. Upon his return, the Buddha said (among other things) that Pasenadi &quot;is a friend of virtue, acquainted with virtue, intimate with virtue&quot;, while the opposite is said of the aggressor, Emperor Ajatashatru.

According to Theravada commentaries, there are five requisite factors that must all be fulfilled for an act to be both an act of killing and to be karmically negative. These are: (1) the presence of a living being, human or animal; (2) the knowledge that the being is a living being; (3) the intent to kill; (4) the act of killing by some means; and (5) the resulting death. Some Buddhists have argued on this basis that the act of killing is complicated, and its ethicization is predicated upon intent. Some have argued that in defensive postures, for example, the primary intention of a soldier is not to kill, but to defend against aggression, and the act of killing in that situation would have minimal negative karmic repercussions.

According to Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, there is circumstantial evidence encouraging Ahimsa, from the Buddha&#x27;s doctrine, &quot;Love all, so that you may not wish to kill any.&quot; Gautama Buddha distinguished between a principle and a rule. He did not make Ahimsa a matter of rule, but suggested it as a matter of principle. This gives Buddhists freedom to act.

=====Laws=====
The emperors of Sui dynasty, Tang dynasty and early Song dynasty banned killing in Lunar calendar 1st, 5th, and 9th month. Empress Wu Tse-Tien banned killing for more than half a year in 692. Some also banned fishing for some time each year.

There were bans after death of emperors, Buddhist and Taoist prayers, and natural disasters such as after a drought in 1926 summer Shanghai and an 8 days ban from August 12, 1959, after the August 7 flood (八七水災), the last big flood before the 88 Taiwan Flood.

People avoid killing during some festivals, like the Taoist Ghost Festival, the Nine Emperor Gods Festival, the Vegetarian Festival and many others.
==Methods==
Nonviolent action generally comprises three categories: &quot;Acts of Protest and Persuasion&quot;, &quot;Noncooperation&quot;, and &quot;Nonviolent Intervention&quot;.

===Acts of protest===

Nonviolent acts of protest and persuasion are symbolic actions performed by a group of people to show their support or disapproval of something. The goal of this kind of action is to bring public awareness to an issue, persuade or influence a particular group of people, or to facilitate future nonviolent action. The message can be directed toward the public, opponents, or people affected by the issue. Methods of protest and persuasion include speeches, public communications, petitions, symbolic acts, art, processions (marches), and other public assemblies.

===Noncooperation===

Noncooperation involves the purposeful withholding of cooperation or the unwillingness to initiate in cooperation with an opponent. The goal of noncooperation is to halt or hinder an industry, political system, or economic process. Methods of noncooperation include labour strikes, economic boycotts, civil disobedience, sex strike, tax refusal, and general disobedience.

===Nonviolent intervention===

Compared with protest and noncooperation, nonviolent intervention is a more direct method of nonviolent action. Nonviolent intervention can be used defensively—for example to maintain an institution or independent initiative—or offensively- for example, to drastically forward a nonviolent cause into the &quot;territory&quot; of those who oppose it. Intervention is often more immediate and initially effective than the other two methods, but is also harder to maintain and more taxing to the participants involved. 

Gene Sharp, a political scientist who sought to advance the worldwide study and use of strategic nonviolent action in conflict, wrote extensively about the methods of nonviolent action. In his 1973 book &quot;Waging Nonviolent Struggle&quot; he described 198 methods of nonviolent action, and in it places several examples of constructive program in this category. In early Greece, Aristophanes&#x27; Lysistrata gives the fictional example of women withholding sexual favors from their husbands until war was abandoned (a sex strike). A modern work of fiction inspired by Gene Sharp and by Aristophanes is the 1986 novel &quot;A Door into Ocean&quot; by Joan Slonczewski, depicting an ocean world inhabited by women who use nonviolent means to repel armed space invaders. Other methods of nonviolent intervention include occupations (sit-ins), fasting (hunger strikes), truck cavalcades, and dual sovereignty/parallel government.

Tactics must be carefully chosen, taking into account political and cultural circumstances, and form part of a larger plan or strategy.

Successful nonviolent cross-border intervention projects include the Guatemala Accompaniment Project, Peace Brigades International and Christian Peacemaker Teams. Developed in the early 1980s, and originally inspired by the Gandhian Shanti Sena, the primary tools of these organisations have been nonviolent protective accompaniment, backed up by a global support network which can respond to threats, local and regional grassroots diplomatic and peacebuilding efforts, human rights observation and witnessing, and reporting. In extreme cases, most of these groups are also prepared to do interpositioning: placing themselves between parties who are engaged or threatening to engage in outright attacks in one or both directions. Individual and large group cases of interpositioning, when called for, have been remarkably effective in dampening conflict and saving lives.

Another powerful tactic of nonviolent intervention invokes public scrutiny of the perceived oppressors as a result of the resisters remaining nonviolent in the face of violent repression. If the military or police attempt to repress nonviolent resisters violently, the power to act shifts from the hands of the oppressors to those of the resisters. If the resisters are persistent, the military or police will be forced to accept the fact that they no longer have any power over the resisters. Often, the willingness of the resisters to suffer has a profound effect on the mind and emotions of the oppressor, leaving them unable to commit such a violent act again.

==Revolution==
Some have argued that a relatively nonviolent revolution would require fraternisation with military forces.

==Criticism==
Ernesto Che Guevara, Leon Trotsky, Frantz Fanon and others have argued that violence is a necessary accompaniment to revolutionary change or that the right to self-defense is fundamental. Subhas Chandra Bose supported Gandhi and nonviolence early in his career but became disillusioned with it and became an effective advocate of violence.

In the essay &quot;Reflections on Gandhi&quot;, George Orwell argued that the nonviolent resistance strategy of Gandhi could be effective in countries with &quot;a free press and the right of assembly&quot;, which could make it possible &quot;not merely to appeal to outside opinion, but to bring a mass movement into being, or even to make your intentions known to your adversary&quot;; but he was skeptical of Gandhi&#x27;s approach being effective in the opposite sort of circumstances.

Reinhold Niebuhr similarly affirmed Gandhi&#x27;s approach while criticising aspects of it. He argued, &quot;The advantage of non-violence as a method of expressing moral goodwill lies in the fact that it protects the agent against the resentments which violent conflict always creates in both parties to a conflict, and it proves this freedom of resentment and ill-will to the contending party in the dispute by enduring more suffering than it causes.&quot; However, Niebuhr also held, &quot;The differences between violent and nonviolent methods of coercion and resistance are not so absolute that it would be possible to regard violence as a morally impossible instrument of social change.&quot;

In the midst of repression of radical African American groups in the United States during the 1960s, Black Panther member George Jackson said of the nonviolent tactics of Martin Luther King Jr.:

The concept of nonviolence is a false ideal. It presupposes the existence of compassion and a sense of justice on the part of one&#x27;s adversary. When this adversary has everything to lose and nothing to gain by exercising justice and compassion, his reaction can only be negative.

Malcolm X also clashed with civil rights leaders over the issue of nonviolence, arguing that violence should not be ruled out if no option remained. He noted that: &quot;I believe it&#x27;s a crime for anyone being brutalized to continue to accept that brutality without doing something to defend himself.&quot;

In his book &quot;How Nonviolence Protects the State&quot;, anarchist Peter Gelderloos criticises nonviolence as being ineffective, racist, statist, patriarchal, tactically and strategically inferior to militant activism, and deluded. Gelderloos claims that traditional histories whitewash the impact of nonviolence, ignoring the involvement of militants in such movements as the Indian independence movement and the Civil Rights Movement and falsely showing Gandhi and King as being their respective movement&#x27;s most successful activists. He further argues that nonviolence is generally advocated by privileged white people who expect &quot;oppressed people, many of whom are people of color, to suffer patiently under an inconceivably greater violence, until such time as the Great White Father is swayed by the movement&#x27;s demands or the pacifists achieve that legendary &#x27;critical mass.&#x27;&quot; On the other hand, anarchism also includes a section committed to nonviolence called anarcho-pacifism. The main early influences were the thought of Henry David Thoreau and Leo Tolstoy while later the ideas of Mahatma Gandhi gained importance. It developed &quot;mostly in Holland, Britain, and the United States, before and during the Second World War&quot;.

The efficacy of nonviolence was also challenged by some anti-capitalist protesters advocating a &quot;diversity of tactics&quot; during street demonstrations across Europe and the US following the anti-World Trade Organization protests in Seattle, Washington in 1999. 

Nonviolence advocates see some truth in this argument: Gandhi himself said often that he could teach nonviolence to a violent person but not to a coward and that true nonviolence came from renouncing violence, not by not having any to renounce. This is the meaning of his quote &quot;It is better to be violent, if there is violence in our hearts, than to put on the cloak of nonviolence to cover impotence.&quot;

Advocates responding to criticisms of the efficacy of nonviolence point to the limited success of nonviolent struggles even against the Nazi regimes in Denmark and even in Berlin. A study by Erica Chenoweth and Maria Stephan found that nonviolent revolutions are twice as effective as violent ones and lead to much greater degrees of democratic freedom.

== Research ==
A 2016 study finds that &quot;increasing levels of globalization are positively associated with the emergence of nonviolent campaigns, while negatively influencing the probability of violent campaigns. Integration into the world increases the popularity of peaceful alternatives to achieve political goals.&quot; A 2020 study found that nonviolent campaigns were more likely to succeed when there was not an ethnic division between actors in the campaign and in the government. According to a 2020 study in the &quot;American Political Science Review&quot;, nonviolent civil rights protests boosted vote shares for the Democratic party in presidential elections in nearby counties, but violent protests substantially boosted white support for Republicans in counties near to the violent protests.

<text>Starhawk (born Miriam Simos on June 17, 1951) is an American feminist and author. She is known as a theorist of feminist neopaganism and ecofeminism. In 2013, she was listed in Watkins&#x27; &quot;Mind Body Spirit&quot; magazine as one of the 100 Most Spiritually Influential Living People.

==Early life==
Starhawk was born in 1951 in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Her father, Jack Simos, died when she was five. Her mother, Bertha Claire Goldfarb Simos, was a professor of social work at UCLA. Both of her parents were the children of Jewish immigrants from Ukraine.

During high school, she and feminist Christina Hoff Sommers were best friends. Starhawk received a BA in Fine Arts from UCLA. In 1973, whilst a graduate student in film there, she won the Samuel Goldwyn Writing Award for her novel, &quot;A Weight of Gold&quot;, a story about Venice, California, where she then lived. She received an MA in Psychology, with a concentration in feminist therapy, from Antioch University West in 1982.

==&quot;The Spiral Dance&quot;==

Following her years at UCLA, after a failed attempt to become a fiction writer in New York City, Starhawk returned to California. She became active in the Neopagan community in the San Francisco Bay Area, and trained with Victor Anderson, founder of the Feri Tradition of witchcraft, and with Zsuzsanna Budapest, a feminist separatist involved in Dianic Wicca.

She wrote a book, &quot;The Spiral Dance&quot;, on Goddess religion, which she finished in 1977 but was unable to publish at first. Feminist religious scholar Carol P. Christ included an article on witchcraft and the Goddess movement in the anthology &quot;Womanspirit Rising&quot; (1979). Christ put Starhawk in touch with an editor at Harper &amp; Row, who eventually published the book.

First published in 1979, &quot;The Spiral Dance: A Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess&quot; became a best-selling book about neopagan belief and practice. A 10th-anniversary edition was published in 1989, followed by a 20th-anniversary edition in 1999. The original text of &quot;The Spiral Dance&quot; was left largely intact for these editions, expanded primarily by introductions and commentaries reflecting on the book&#x27;s origins, the rituals described, and the evolution of the author&#x27;s beliefs and practices. Since its publication, &quot;The Spiral Dance&quot; has become a classic resource on Wicca and modern witchcraft, spiritual feminism, the Goddess movement, and ecofeminism. The work is distinguished by its visionary mysticism, &quot;broad philosophy of harmony with nature,&quot; and ecstatic consciousness.

==Beliefs==
Starhawk believes that the Earth is a living entity, and that faith-based activism can reconnect oneself to basic human needs. She posits core religious values of community and self-sacrifice as important to eco-pagan movements, as well as the broader environmental justice movement.

She advocates combining social justice issues with a nature-based spirituality that begins with spending time in the natural world, saying that doing so &quot;...can open up your understanding on deeper and more subtle levels where the natural world will speak to you.&quot;

Starhawk&#x27;s activism is deeply rooted in an anti-war philosophy, as she believes that war teaches one to see people culturally different than themselves as inhuman and dangerous. She has written extensively on activism, including advice for activist organizers, examinations of white privilege within radical communities, and calls for an intersectionality of fighting oppression that includes spirituality, eco-consciousness, and sexual and gender liberation.

==Feminism==

Starhawk&#x27;s feminism and spirituality are closely interconnected. Her ecofeminism links life-giving Mother Nature with the life-giving of women through birth, as well as the link between ecological destruction and patriarchal oppression under male-dominated Western political economies.

She calls for a reconceptualization of the way we think about power that is different from what she posits as our typical understanding of &#x27;power over&#x27; others, and believes that patriarchal systems of oppression are dying out and will be replaced by more egalitarian structures that have existed previously with many women in positions of power, including as priestesses, poets, healers, singers, and seers. Such matrilineal lineages, she argues, have been erased from history because of their &quot;political implications.&quot;

Starhawk argues that our patriarchal culture of domination has confused the erotic with domination and violence. Sexuality, she says, &quot;...is sacred because through it we make a connection with another self — but it is misused and perverted when it becomes an arena of power-over, a means of treating another — or oneself — as an object.&quot; Such analyses of gendered power relations are explored in her books &quot;Webs of Power: Notes from the Global Uprising&quot; (2003) and &quot;Truth or Dare: Encounters with Power, Authority and Mystery&quot; (1988). In the latter, she links the rise of kinship to patriarchal domination, and traces a psychology of liberation in analyzing an oppressor she argues is embedded deeply in all of us, the &#x27;Self-hater.&#x27; She is interested in how such oppressions can be reformed into new sources of power, particularly amongst women, that arise innately and reject dominion over others.

Her feminist writings have been used to analyze the differences between mainstream rhetoric and feminist rhetoric, particularly in relation to her motive of writing rhetoric as revealing immanent truths rather than being utilized for persuasion. She views this latter purpose of mainstream rhetoric as adhering to patriarchal logic, and her vision of &#x27;empowered action&#x27; – which involves rejecting the tenets of the oppressive system and then openly challenging them – attempts to transform persuasive mainstream rhetoric to immanent feminist rhetoric.

==Projects==

In 1979, partly to commemorate the publication of &quot;The Spiral Dance&quot;, Starhawk and her friends staged a public celebration of the neopagan holiday of Samhain (Halloween) incorporating an actual spiral dance. This group became the Reclaiming Collective, and their annual Spiral Dance ritual now draws hundreds of participants.

Starhawk continues to work with Reclaiming, a tradition of Witchcraft that she co-founded. This now-international organization offers classes, workshops, camps, and public rituals in earth-based spirituality, with the goal to &quot;unify spirit and politics&quot;.

She also works internationally as a trainer in nonviolence and direct action, and as an activist within the peace movement, women&#x27;s movement, environmental movement, permaculture, and anti-globalization movement. She travels and teaches widely in North America, Europe and the Middle East, giving lectures and workshops.

She was influential in the decision by the Unitarian Universalist Association to include earth-centered traditions among their sources of faith. She led numerous workshops for, and was an active member of The Covenant of Unitarian Universalist Pagans (CUUPS), an interest group of Unitarians honoring goddess-based, earth-centered, tribal, and pagan spiritual paths.

Starhawk has taught in several San Francisco Bay Area colleges and universities, including John F. Kennedy University, Antioch University West, the Institute of Culture and Creation Spirituality at Holy Names University, and Wisdom University. She is presently adjunct faculty at the California Institute of Integral Studies, and is currently affiliated with United for Peace and Justice, the RANT trainers&#x27; collective, Earth Activist Training, and other groups.

Starhawk has written a number of books, and has also contributed works in other media. Her works have appeared in translation in Spanish, French, German, Danish, Dutch, Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Czech, Greek, Japanese, and Burmese.

<doc id="178758" wikidata="Q12302824" url="?curid=178758" title="Ochroma">
<text>Ochroma pyramidale, commonly known as the balsa tree, is a large, fast-growing tree native to the Americas. It is the sole member of the genus Ochroma. The tree is famous for its wide usage in woodworking, due to its softness and its high strength compared to its low density. The name &quot;balsa&quot; is the Spanish word for &quot;raft&quot; and the Portuguese word for ferry.

A deciduous angiosperm, &quot;Ochroma pyramidale&quot; can grow up to 30 m tall, and is classified as a hardwood despite the wood itself being very soft; it is the softest commercial hardwood and is widely used because of its light weight.

Balsa trees grow extremely fast, often up to 27 metres in 10–15 years, and do not usually live beyond 30 to 40 years. They are often cultivated in dense patches, with Ecuador supplying 95% or more of the commercial balsa. The wood from these trees is highly valuable due to its high strength-to-weight ratio, which is achieved through a kiln-drying process that leaves the wood&#x27;s cells hollow and empty.

Balsa wood is popular for light, stiff structures in model bridge tests, model buildings, and construction of model aircraft. It is also used in the manufacturing of wooden crankbaits for fishing, makeshift pens for calligraphy, composites, surfboards, boats, &quot;breakaway&quot; props for theatre and television, and even in the floor pans of the Chevrolet Corvette. Balsa wood played a historical role in Thor Heyerdahl&#x27;s Kon-Tiki expedition where it was used to build the raft. Balsa wood is also popular in arts such as whittling, and in the making of baroque-style picture frames due to its ease of shaping.

== Biology ==
A member of the mallow family, &quot;Ochroma pyramidale&quot; is native from southern Mexico to southern Brazil, but can now be found in many other countries (Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, Thailand, Solomon Islands). It is a pioneer plant, which establishes itself in clearings in forests, either man-made or where trees have fallen, or in abandoned agricultural fields. It grows extremely rapidly, up to in 10–15 years. The speed of growth accounts for the lightness of the wood, which has a lower density than cork. Trees generally do not live beyond 30 to 40 years.

Flowers are produced from the third year onwards, typically at the end of the rainy season when few other trees are in flower. The large flowers open in the late afternoon and remain open overnight. Each may contain a pool of nectar up to deep. Daytime pollinators include capuchin monkeys. However, most pollination occurs at night. The main pollinators were once thought to be bats, but recent evidence suggests that two nocturnal arboreal mammals, the kinkajou and the olingo, may be the primary pollinators.

It is evergreen or dry-season deciduous, with large , weakly palmately lobed leaves.

Being a deciduous angiosperm, balsa is classified as a hardwood despite the wood itself being very soft; it is the softest commercial hardwood.

== Cultivation ==

Ecuador supplies 70% or more of commercial balsa. In recent years, about 60% of the balsa has been plantation-grown in densely packed patches of around 1000 trees per hectare (compared to about two to three per hectare in nature). The trees are harvested after six to ten years of growth in Ecuador. The remaining volume of balsa is harvested from plantations in Papua New Guinea; the climate is different, therefore harvesting occurs at 4-5 years of age.

== Uses ==
Balsa lumber is very soft and light, with a coarse, open grain. The density of dry balsa wood ranges from 40 to 475 kg/m3, with a typical density around 160 kg/m3. Balsa is the softest wood ever measured using the Janka hardness test (22 to 167 lbf). The wood of the living tree has large cells that are filled with water. This gives the wood a spongy texture. It also makes the wood of the living tree not much lighter than water and barely able to float. For commercial production, the wood is kiln-dried for about two weeks, leaving the cells hollow and empty. The large volume-to-surface ratio of the resulting thin-walled, empty cells gives the dried wood a large strength-to-weight ratio because the cells are mostly air. Unlike naturally rotted wood, which soon disintegrates in the rainforests where balsa trees grow, the cell walls of kiln-seasoned balsa wood retain their strong structure of cellulose and lignin.

Because it is low in density but high in specific strength (strength per weight), balsa is a very popular material for light, stiff structures in model bridge tests, model buildings, and construction of model aircraft; all grades are usable for airworthy control line and radio-controlled aircraft varieties of the aeromodeling sports, with the lightest &quot;contest grades&quot; especially valuable for free-flight model aircraft. However, it is also valued as a component of full-sized light wooden aeroplanes, most notably the World War II de Havilland Mosquito.

Balsa is used to make wooden crankbaits for fishing, especially Rapala lures.

Sticks of dried balsa are useful as makeshift pens for calligraphy when commercial metal nibs of the desired width are not available.

Balsa wood is often selected as a core material in composites. Because O. pyramidale grows quickly and tolerates poor soils it is lower in cost per performance compared to polymer foams like EPS while having better tensile strength than typical foams. For example, the blades of wind turbines are commonly constructed of many balsa plywood cores and internal spars covered with resin infused cloth on both sides. In table tennis rackets, a balsa layer is typically sandwiched between two pieces of thin plywood made from other species of wood. Balsa wood is also used in laminates together with glass-reinforced plastic (fiberglass) for making high-quality balsa surfboards and for the decks and topsides of many types of boats, especially pleasure craft less than 30 m in length. On a boat, the balsa core is usually end-grain balsa, which is much more resistant to compression than if the soft balsa wood were laid lengthwise.

More than 90% of the world&#x27;s Balsa wood volume is prepared into end grain panels for the composites industry, mostly used as structural cores in the wind turbine blades. Where strength, rigidity, durable and environmentally sustainable materials are sought after. 

Balsa is also used in the manufacture of &quot;breakaway&quot; wooden props such as tables and chairs that are designed to be broken as part of theatre, movie, and television productions.

The fifth and sixth generations of the Chevrolet Corvette had floor pans composed of balsa sandwiched between sheets of carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic.

Norwegian scientist and adventurer Thor Heyerdahl, convinced that early contact between the peoples of South America and Polynesia was possible, built the raft &quot;Kon Tiki&quot; from balsa logs, and upon it his crew and he sailed the Pacific Ocean from Peru to the Polynesian Tuamotu Archipelago in 1947. However, the &quot;Kon Tiki&quot; logs were not seasoned and owed much of their (rather slight) buoyancy to the fact that their sap was of lower density than sea water. This serendipitously may have saved the expedition, because it prevented the seawater from the wood and sinking the raft.

Balsa wood is also a popular wood type used in the arts of whittling, and surfing. In the making of picture frames, balsa was often used in a baroque style because of the ease of shaping the design.

In parts of Africa and south America the leaves of the balsa tree are used to enhance the traditional panning method of extracting gold from ore. When mixed with water a soapy solution is produced and this helps the lighter, unwanted material to wash away.

<text>Suzanna Arundhati Roy (; born 24 November 1961) is an Indian author best known for her novel &quot;The God of Small Things&quot; (1997), which won the Booker Prize for Fiction in 1997 and became the best-selling book by a non-expatriate Indian author. She is also a political activist involved in human rights and environmental causes. She was the winner of the 2024 PEN Pinter Prize, given by English PEN, and she named imprisoned British-Egyptian writer and activist Alaa Abd El-Fattah as the &quot;Writer of Courage&quot; with whom she chose to share the award. Roy speaks English, Hindi and Malayalam.

== Early life ==
Suzanna Arundhati Roy was born on 24 November, 1961 in Shillong in Undivided Assam (now in Meghalaya) into a Christian family, to parents Mary Roy, a Malayali Jacobite Syrian Christian women&#x27;s rights activist from Kerala and Rajib Roy, a Bengali Christian tea plantation manager from Kolkata, West Bengal. In September 2020, Roy denied false rumors about her being a Brahmin by caste.

When she was two years old, her parents divorced and she returned to Kerala with her mother and brother. For some time, the family lived with Roy&#x27;s maternal grandfather in Ooty, Tamil Nadu. When she was five, the family moved back to Kerala, where her mother started a school.

Roy attended school at Corpus Christi in Kottayam, Kerala, followed by the Lawrence School in Lovedale, Tamil Nadu. She then studied architecture at the School of Planning and Architecture in New Delhi, where she met architect Gerard da Cunha. They married in 1978 and lived in Delhi and then Goa before divorcing in 1982.

==Personal life==
Roy returned to Delhi, where she obtained a position with the National Institute of Urban Affairs. In 1984, she met independent filmmaker Pradip Krishen, who offered her a role as a goatherd in his award-winning movie &quot;Massey Sahib&quot;. They married the same year. They collaborated on a television series about India&#x27;s independence movement and on two films, &quot;In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones&quot; (1989) and &quot;Electric Moon&quot; (1992). Disenchanted with the film world, Roy experimented with various fields, including running aerobics classes. Roy and Krishen currently live separately but are still married. She became financially secure with the success of her novel &quot;The God of Small Things&quot;, published in 1997.

Roy is a cousin of prominent media personality Prannoy Roy, former head of the Indian television media group NDTV. She lives in Delhi.

==Career==
===Early career: screenplays===
Early in her career, Roy worked in television and movies. She starred in Massey Sahib in 1985. She wrote the screenplays for &quot;In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones&quot; (1989), a movie based on her experiences as a student of architecture, in which she also appeared as a performer, and &quot;Electric Moon&quot; (1992). Both were directed by her husband, Pradip Krishen, during their marriage. Roy won the National Film Award for Best Screenplay in 1988 for &quot;In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones&quot;. She attracted attention in 1994 when she criticised Shekhar Kapur&#x27;s film &quot;Bandit Queen&quot;, which was based on the life of Phoolan Devi. In her film review titled &quot;The Great Indian Rape Trick&quot;, Roy questioned the right to &quot;restage the rape of a living woman without her permission&quot;, and charged Kapur with exploiting Devi and misrepresenting both her life and its meaning.

===&quot;The God of Small Things&quot;===

Roy began writing her first novel, &quot;The God of Small Things&quot;, in 1992, completing it in 1996. The book is semi-autobiographical and a major part captures her childhood experiences in Aymanam.

The publication of &quot;The God of Small Things&quot; catapulted Roy to international fame. It received the 1997 Booker Prize for Fiction and was listed as one of &quot;The New York Times&quot; Notable Books of the Year. It reached fourth position on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Bestsellers list for Independent Fiction. From the beginning, the book was also a commercial success: Roy received a publishing advance of half a million pounds. It was published in May, and the book had been sold in 18 countries by the end of June.

&quot;The God of Small Things&quot; received very favorable reviews in major American newspapers such as &quot;The New York Times&quot; (a &quot;dazzling first novel&quot;, &quot;extraordinary&quot;, &quot;at once so morally strenuous and so imaginatively supple&quot;) and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; (&quot;a novel of poignancy and considerable sweep&quot;), and in Canadian publications such as the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; (&quot;a lush, magical novel&quot;). It was one of the five best books of 1997 according to &quot;Time&quot;. Critical response in the United Kingdom was less favorable, and the awarding of the Booker Prize caused controversy; Carmen Callil, a 1996 Booker Prize judge, called the novel &quot;execrable&quot; and a &quot;Guardian&quot; journalist called the contest &quot;profoundly depressing&quot;. In India, E. K. Nayanar, then the chief minister of Roy&#x27;s home state of Kerala, especially criticised the book&#x27;s unrestrained description of sexuality, and she had to answer charges of obscenity.

===Later career===
Since the success of her novel, Roy has written a television serial, &quot;The Banyan Tree&quot;, and the documentary &quot;DAM/AGE: A Film with Arundhati Roy&quot; (2002).

In early 2007, Roy said she was working on a second novel, &quot;The Ministry of Utmost Happiness&quot;.

Roy contributed to &quot;We Are One: A Celebration of Tribal Peoples&quot;, a book released in 2009 that explores the culture of peoples around the world, portraying their diversity and the threats to their existence. The royalties from the sale of this book go to the indigenous rights organisation Survival International.

Roy has written numerous essays on contemporary politics and culture. In 2014, they were collected by Penguin India in a five-volume set. In 2019, her nonfiction was collected in a single volume, &quot;My Seditious Heart&quot;, published by Haymarket Books.

In October 2016, Penguin India and Hamish Hamilton UK announced that they would publish her second novel, &quot;The Ministry of Utmost Happiness&quot;, in June 2017. The novel was chosen for the Man Booker Prize 2017 longlist, and was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction in January 2018.

==Advocacy==
Since publishing &quot;The God of Small Things&quot; in 1997, Roy has spent most of her time on political activism and nonfiction (such as collections of essays about social causes). She is a spokesperson of the anti-globalization/alter-globalization movement and a vehement critic of neo-imperialism and U.S. foreign policy. She opposes India&#x27;s policies toward nuclear weapons as well as industrialization and economic growth (which she describes as &quot;encrypted with genocidal potential&quot; in &quot;Listening to Grasshoppers: Field Notes on Democracy&quot;). She has also questioned the conduct of the Indian police and administration in the case of the 2001 Indian Parliament attack and the Batla House encounter case, contending that the country has had a &quot;shadowy history of suspicious terror attacks, murky investigations, and fake encounters&quot;.

===Support for Kashmiri separatism===
In an August 2008 interview with &quot;The Times of India&quot;, Roy expressed her support for the independence of Kashmir from India after the massive demonstrations in 2008 in favour of independence took place—some 500,000 people rallied in Srinagar in the Kashmir part of Jammu and Kashmir state of India for independence on 18 August 2008, following the Amarnath land transfer controversy. According to her, the rallies were a sign that Kashmiris desired secession from India, and not union with India. She was criticised by the Indian National Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party for her remarks.

All India Congress Committee member and senior Congress party leader Satya Prakash Malaviya asked Roy to withdraw her &quot;irresponsible&quot; statement, saying that it was &quot;contrary to historical facts&quot;.
 She was charged with sedition along with separatist Hurriyat leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani and others by Delhi Police for their &quot;anti-India&quot; speech at a 2010 convention on Kashmir: &quot;Azadi: The Only Way&quot;. In June 2024, the UAPA Act was invoked against them.

===Sardar Sarovar Project===
Roy has campaigned along with activist Medha Patkar against the Narmada dam project, saying that the dam will displace half a million people with little or no compensation, and will not provide the projected irrigation, drinking water, and other benefits. Roy donated her Booker prize money, as well as royalties from her books on the project, to the Narmada Bachao Andolan. Roy also appears in Franny Armstrong&#x27;s &quot;Drowned Out&quot;, a 2002 documentary about the project. Roy&#x27;s opposition to the Narmada Dam project was criticised as &quot;maligning Gujarat&quot; by Congress and BJP leaders in Gujarat.

In 2002, Roy responded to a contempt notice issued against her by the Supreme Court of India with an affidavit saying that the court&#x27;s decision to initiate contempt proceedings based on an unsubstantiated and flawed petition, while refusing to inquire into allegations of corruption in military contracting deals pleading an overload of cases, indicated a &quot;disquieting inclination&quot; to silence criticism and dissent using the power of contempt. The court found Roy&#x27;s statement, which she refused to disavow or apologise for, constituted criminal contempt, sentenced her to a &quot;symbolic&quot; one day&#x27;s imprisonment, and fined her 2500. Roy served the jail sentence and paid the fine rather than serve an additional three months for default.

Environmental historian Ramachandra Guha has been critical of Roy&#x27;s Narmada dam activism. While acknowledging her &quot;courage and commitment&quot; to the cause, Guha writes that her advocacy is hyperbolic and self-indulgent, and that &quot;Ms. Roy&#x27;s tendency to exaggerate and simplify, her Manichaean view of the world, and her shrill hectoring tone, have given a bad name to environmental analysis&quot;. He faulted Roy&#x27;s criticism of Supreme Court judges who were hearing a petition brought by the Narmada Bachao Andolan as careless and irresponsible.

Roy counters that her writing is intentional in its passionate, hysterical tone: &quot;I &quot;am&quot; hysterical. I&#x27;m screaming from the bloody rooftops. And he and his smug little club are going &#x27;Shhhh... you&#x27;ll wake the neighbours!&#x27; I &quot;want&quot; to wake the neighbours, that&#x27;s my whole point. I want everybody to open their eyes&quot;.

Gail Omvedt and Roy have had fierce yet constructive discussions in open letters on Roy&#x27;s strategy for the Narmada Dam movement. The activists disagree on whether to demand stopping the dam building altogether (Roy) or search for intermediate alternatives (Omvedt).

===US foreign policy, war in Afghanistan===

In a September 2001 opinion piece in &quot;The Guardian&quot; titled &quot;The algebra of infinite justice&quot;, Roy responded to the U.S. military invasion of Afghanistan, finding fault with the argument that this war would be a retaliation for the September 11 attacks: &quot;The bombing of Afghanistan is not revenge for New York and Washington. It is yet another act of terror against the people of the world.&quot; According to her, U.S. president George W. Bush and UK prime minister Tony Blair were guilty of Orwellian doublethink: 
 She disputes U.S. claims of being a peaceful and freedom-loving nation, listing China and 19 Third World &quot;countries that America has been at war with—and bombed—since World War II&quot;, as well as previous U.S. support for the Taliban movement and the Northern Alliance (whose &quot;track record is not very different from the Taliban&#x27;s&quot;). She does not spare the Taliban: 

In the final analysis, Roy sees American-style capitalism as the culprit: 
She puts the attacks on the World Trade Center and on Afghanistan on the same moral level, that of terrorism, and mourns the impossibility of beauty after 2001: &quot;Will it be possible ever again to watch the slow, amazed blink of a newborn gecko in the sun, or whisper back to the marmot who has just whispered in your ear—without thinking of the World Trade Centre and Afghanistan?&quot;

In May 2003, she delivered a speech titled &quot;Instant-Mix Imperial Democracy (Buy One, Get One Free)&quot; at Riverside Church in New York City, in which she described the United States as a global empire that reserves the right to bomb any of its subjects at any time, deriving its legitimacy directly from God. The speech was an indictment of the U.S. actions relating to the Iraq War. In June 2005, she took part in the World Tribunal on Iraq, and in March 2006 she criticised President George W. Bush&#x27;s visit to India, calling him a &quot;war criminal&quot;.

===India&#x27;s nuclear weaponry===
In response to India&#x27;s testing of nuclear weapons in Pokhran, Rajasthan, Roy wrote &quot;The End of Imagination&quot; (1998), a critique of the Indian government&#x27;s nuclear policies. It was published in her collection &quot;The Cost of Living&quot; (1999), in which she also crusaded against India&#x27;s massive hydroelectric dam projects in the central and western states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat.

===Israel===
In August 2006, Roy, along with Noam Chomsky, Howard Zinn and others, signed a letter in &quot;The Guardian&quot; calling the 2006 Lebanon War a &quot;war crime&quot; and accusing Israel of &quot;state terror&quot;. In 2007, Roy was one of more than 100 artists and writers who signed an open letter initiated by Queers Undermining Israeli Terrorism and the South West Asian, North African Bay Area Queers calling on the San Francisco International LGBT Film Festival &quot;to honor calls for an international boycott of Israeli political and cultural institutions, by discontinuing Israeli consulate sponsorship of the LGBT film festival and not cosponsoring events with the Israeli consulate&quot;. During the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis, she defended Hamas&#x27;s rocket attacks, citing Palestinians&#x27; right to resistance. In December 2023, during Israel&#x27;s bombing campaign in Gaza, Roy said: &quot;If we say nothing about Israel&#x27;s brazen slaughter of Palestinians, even as it is live-streamed into the most private recesses of our personal lives, we are complicit in it.&quot; In October 2024, Roy and thousands of other writers signed an open letter pledging to boycott Israeli cultural institutions.

===2001 Indian parliament attack===
Roy has raised questions about the investigation into the 2001 Indian Parliament attack and the trial of the accused. According to her, Mohammad Afzal Guru was being scapegoated. She pointed to irregularities in the judicial and investigative process in the case and maintains that the case remains unsolved. In her book about Guru&#x27;s hanging, she suggests that there is evidence of state complicity in the terrorist attack. In an editorial in &quot;The Hindu&quot;, journalist Praveen Swami wrote that Roy&#x27;s evidence of state complicity was &quot;cherry-picked for polemical effect&quot;.

Roy also called for Guru&#x27;s death sentence to be stayed while a parliamentary enquiry into these questions was conducted, and denounced press coverage of the trial. BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar criticised Roy for calling Afzal a &quot;prisoner of war&quot; and called her a &quot;prisoner of her own dogma&quot;. Afzal was hanged in 2013. Roy called the hanging &quot;a stain on India&#x27;s democracy&quot;.

===The Muthanga incident===
In 2003, the Adivasi Gothra Maha Sabha, a social movement for Adivasi land rights in Kerala, organised a major land occupation of a piece of land of a former Eucalyptus plantation in the Muthanga Wildlife Reserve, on the border of Kerala and Karnataka. After 48 days, a police force was sent into the area to evict the occupants. One participant of the movement and a policeman were killed, and the leaders of the movement were arrested. Roy travelled to the area, visited the movement&#x27;s leaders in jail, and wrote an open letter to the then Chief Minister of Kerala, A. K. Antony, saying: &quot;You have blood on your hands.&quot;

===Comments on 2008 Mumbai attacks===
In an opinion piece for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in December 2008, Roy argued that the 2008 Mumbai attacks cannot be seen in isolation, but must be understood in the context of wider issues in the region&#x27;s history and society such as widespread poverty, the Partition of India (&quot;Britain&#x27;s final, parting kick to us&quot;), the atrocities committed during the 2002 Gujarat violence, and the ongoing Kashmir conflict. Despite this call for context, Roy stated in the article that she believes &quot;nothing can justify terrorism&quot;, and calls terrorism &quot;a heartless ideology&quot;. Roy warned against war with Pakistan, arguing that it is hard to &quot;pin down the provenance of a terrorist strike and isolate it within the borders of a single nation state&quot;, and that war could lead to the &quot;descent of the whole region into chaos&quot;. Salman Rushdie and others strongly criticised her remarks and condemned her for linking the Mumbai attacks with Kashmir and economic injustice against Muslims in India; Rushdie criticised Roy for attacking the iconic status of the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower. Indian writer Tavleen Singh called Roy&#x27;s comments &quot;the latest of her series of hysterical diatribes against India and all things Indian&quot;.

===Criticism of Sri Lankan government===
In an opinion piece in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Roy pleaded for international attention to what she called a possible government-sponsored genocide of Tamils in Sri Lanka. She cited reports of camps into which Tamils were being herded as part of what she called &quot;a brazen, openly racist war&quot;. She also said that the &quot;Government of Sri Lanka is on the verge of committing what could end up being genocide&quot; and described the Sri Lankan IDP camps where Tamil civilians are being held as concentration camps. The Sri Lankan writer Ruvani Freeman called Roy&#x27;s remarks &quot;ill-informed and hypocritical&quot; and criticised her for &quot;whitewashing the atrocities of the LTTE&quot;. Roy has said of such accusations: &quot;I cannot admire those whose vision can only accommodate justice for their own and not for everybody. However, I do believe that the LTTE and its fetish for violence was cultured in the crucible of monstrous, racist, injustice that the Sri Lankan government and to a great extent Sinhala society visited on the Tamil people for decades&quot;.

===Views on the Naxalites===
Roy has criticised the Indian government&#x27;s armed actions against the Naxalite-Maoist insurgency in India, calling it &quot;war on the poorest people in the country&quot;. According to her, the government has &quot;abdicated its responsibility to the people&quot; and launched the offensive against Naxals to aid the corporations with whom it has signed Memoranda of Understanding. While she has received support from various quarters for her views, Roy&#x27;s description of the Maoists as &quot;Gandhians&quot; raised a controversy. In other statements, she has described Naxalites as patriots &quot;of a kind&quot; who are &quot;fighting to implement the Constitution, (while) the government is vandalising it&quot;.
===Sedition charges===
In November 2010, Roy, Syed Ali Shah Geelani, and five others were brought up on charges of sedition by the Delhi Police. The filing of the First Information Report came following a directive from a local court on a petition filed by Sushil Pandit, who alleged that Geelani and Roy had made anti-India speeches at a conference on &quot;Azadi-the Only Way&quot; on 21 October 2010. Roy&#x27;s words were that &quot;Kashmir has never been an integral part of India. It is a historical fact. Even the Indian government has accepted this.&quot; A Delhi city court directed the police to respond to the demand for a criminal case after the central government declined to charge Roy, saying that the charges were inappropriate.

===Criticism of Anna Hazare===
On 21 August 2011, at the height of Anna Hazare&#x27;s anti-corruption campaign, Roy criticised Hazare and his movement in an opinion piece published in &quot;The Hindu&quot;. In the article, she questioned Hazare&#x27;s secular credentials, pointing out the campaign&#x27;s corporate backing, its suspicious timing, Hazare&#x27;s silence on private-sector corruption, expressing her fear that the Lokpal will only end up creating &quot;two oligarchies, instead of just one&quot;. She stated that while &quot;his means may be Gandhian, his demands are certainly not&quot;, and alleged that by &quot;demonising only the Government they&quot; are preparing to call for &quot;more privatisation, more access to public infrastructure and India&#x27;s natural resources&quot;, adding that it &quot;may not be long before Corporate Corruption is made legal and renamed a Lobbying Fee&quot;. Roy also accused the electronic media of blowing the campaign out of proportion. In an interview with &quot;Kindle Magazine&quot;, Roy pointed out the role of media hype and target audience in determining how well hunger strikes &quot;work as a tool of political mobilization&quot; by noting the disparity in the attention Hazare&#x27;s fast has received in contrast to the decade-long fast of Irom Sharmila &quot;to demand the repealing of a law that allows non-commissioned officers to kill on suspicion—a law that has led to so much suffering.&quot; Roy&#x27;s comparison of the Jan Lokpal Bill with the Maoists, claiming both sought &quot;the overthrow of the Indian State&quot;, met with resentment from members of Team Anna. Medha Patkar reacted sharply calling Roy&#x27;s comments &quot;highly misplaced&quot; and chose to emphasise the &quot;peaceful, non-violent&quot; nature of the movement. Roy also has stated that &quot;an &#x27;anti-corruption&#x27; campaign is a catch-all campaign. It includes everybody from the extreme left to the extreme right and also the extremely corrupt. No one&#x27;s going to say they are for corruption after all...I&#x27;m not against a strong anti-corruption bill, but corruption is just a manifestation of a problem, not the problem itself.&quot;

===Views on Narendra Modi===
In 2013, Roy called Narendra Modi&#x27;s nomination as prime minister a &quot;tragedy&quot;. She said business houses were supporting his candidacy because he was the &quot;most militaristic and aggressive&quot; candidate. She has argued that Modi has control over India to a degree unrecognized by most people in the Western world: &quot;He &quot;is&quot; the system. He has the backing of the media. He has the backing of the army, the courts, a majoritarian popular vote... Every institution has fallen in line.&quot; She has expressed deep despair for the future, calling Modi&#x27;s long-term plans for a highly centralized Hindu state &quot;suicidal&quot; for the multicultural subcontinent. On 28 April 2021, &quot;The Guardian&quot; published an article by Roy describing the Indian government&#x27;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic as a &quot;crime against humanity&quot;, in which &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said Roy &quot;slammed Modi for his handling of the pandemic&quot;. Roy&#x27;s op-ed was also published in &quot;The Wire&quot; with the title &quot;It&#x27;s Not Enough to Say the Govt Has Failed. We Are Witnessing a Crime Against Humanity.&quot;

=== Remarks about National Registers ===
On 25 December 2019, while speaking at Delhi University, Roy urged people to mislead authorities during the upcoming enumeration by the National Population Register, which she said can serve as a database for the National Register of Citizens. The remarks were criticized by the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). A complaint against her was registered at Tilak Marg police station, Delhi, under sections 295A, 504, 153 and 120B of the Indian Penal Code. Roy responded, &quot;What I was proposing was civil disobedience with a smile&quot;, and claimed that her remarks were misrepresented.

==Awards and recognition==
Roy was awarded the 1997 Booker Prize for her novel &quot;The God of Small Things&quot;. The award carried a prize of approximately US$30,000 and a citation that noted, &quot;The book keeps all the promises that it makes&quot;. Roy donated the prize money she received, as well as royalties from her book, to human rights causes. Prior to the Booker, Roy won the National Film Award for Best Screenplay in 1989, for the screenplay of &quot;In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones&quot;, in which she captured the anguish among the students prevailing in professional institutions. In 2015, she returned the national award in protest against religious intolerance and the growing violence by rightwing groups in India.

In 2002, she won the Lannan Foundation&#x27;s Cultural Freedom Award for her work &quot;about civil societies that are adversely affected by the world&#x27;s most powerful governments and corporations&quot;, in order &quot;to celebrate her life and her ongoing work in the struggle for freedom, justice and cultural diversity&quot;.

In 2003, she was awarded &quot;special recognition&quot; as a Woman of Peace at the Global Exchange Human Rights Awards in San Francisco with Bianca Jagger, Barbara Lee, and Kathy Kelly.

Roy was awarded the Sydney Peace Prize in May 2004 for her work in social campaigns and her advocacy of non-violence. That same year she was awarded the Orwell Award, along with Seymour Hersh, by the National Council of Teachers of English.

In January 2006, she was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award, a national award from India&#x27;s Academy of Letters, for her collection of essays on contemporary issues, &quot;The Algebra of Infinite Justice&quot;, but she declined to accept it &quot;in protest against the Indian Government toeing the US line by &#x27;violently and ruthlessly pursuing policies of brutalisation of industrial workers, increasing militarisation and economic neo-liberalisation.

In November 2011, she was awarded the Norman Mailer Prize for Distinguished Writing.

Roy was featured in the 2014 list of &quot;Time&quot; 100, the 100 most influential people in the world.

St. Louis University gave Roy the 2022 St. Louis Literary Award, granted to the &quot;most important writers of our time&quot; to celebrate &quot;the contributions of literature in enriching our lives&quot;. The award ceremony was on 28 April 2022.

In September 2023, Roy received the lifetime achievement award at the 45th European Essay Prize for the French translation of her book &quot;Azadi&quot;.

In June 2024, Roy was announced as winner of the annual PEN Pinter Prize, given by human rights organization English PEN to a writer who, in the words of late playwright Harold Pinter, casts an &quot;unflinching, unswerving&quot; gaze on the world and shows &quot;fierce intellectual determination ... to define the real truth of our lives and our societies&quot;. English PEN chair Ruth Borthwick said Roy tells &quot;urgent stories of injustice with wit and beauty&quot;.

In August 2024, Roy and Toomaj Salehi shared the Disturbing the Peace Award, a recognition the Vaclav Havel Center accords to courageous writers at risk. The award committee chair, Bill Shipsey, called them &quot;wonderful exemplars of the spirit of Václav Havel&quot;.

On 10 October 2024, Roy named imprisoned British-Egyptian activist Alaa Abd El-Fattah as the international &quot;writer of courage&quot; with whom she chose to share the 2024 PEN Pinter Prize, announced at a ceremony at the British Library, where Roy delivered her acceptance speech. Author and journalist Naomi Klein also spoke, praising Roy&#x27;s and Abd El-Fattah&#x27;s work, and Lina Attalah, editor-in-chief of independent online Egyptian newspaper &quot;Mada Masr&quot;, accepted the award on Abd El-Fattah&#x27;s behalf.

<text>Bridget Louise Riley (born 24 April 1931) is an English painter known for her op art paintings. She lives and works in London, Cornwall and the Vaucluse in France.

==Early life and education==
Riley was born on 24 April 1931 in Norwood, London. Her father, John Fisher Riley, originally from Yorkshire, had been an Army officer. He was a printer by trade and owned his own business. In 1938, he relocated the printing business, together with his family, to Lincolnshire.

At the beginning of World War II, her father, a member of the Territorial Army, was mobilised, and Riley, together with her mother and sister Sally, moved to a cottage in Cornwall. They shared the cottage with an aunt who had studied at Goldsmiths&#x27; College, London and Riley attended talks given by a range of retired teachers and non-professionals. She attended Cheltenham Ladies&#x27; College (1946–1948) and then studied art at Goldsmiths&#x27; College (1949–52), and later at the Royal College of Art (1952–55).

Between 1956 and 1959, she nursed her father, who had been involved in a serious car crash. She suffered a breakdown due to the deterioration of her father&#x27;s health. After this she worked in a glassware shop. She eventually joined the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency, as an illustrator, where she worked part-time until 1962. The Whitechapel Gallery exhibition of Jackson Pollock in the winter of 1958 had an impact on her.

Her early work was figurative and semi-impressionist. Between 1958 and 1959, her work at the advertising agency showed her adoption of a style of painting based on the pointillist technique. 

In 1959 Riley met the painter and art educator Maurice de Sausmarez at a residential summer school that he ran with Harry Thubron and Diane Thubron. He became her friend and mentor, inspiring her to look closer at Futurism and Divisionism and artists such as Klee and Seurat. Riley and de Sausmarez began an intense romantic relationship later that year and spent the summer of 1960 together painting in Italy where they visited the Venice Biennale which was hosting a large exhibition of Futurist art. Riley painted &quot;Pink landscape&quot; (1960), a pointillist study of the landscape near Radicofani during this holiday. When the relationship ended in autumn of the same year, Riley suffered a personal and artistic crisis, creating paintings that would lead to black and white Op Art works, such as &quot;Kiss&quot; (1961). She began to develop her signature Op Art style consisting of black and white geometric patterns that explore the dynamism of sight and produce a disorienting effect on the eye and produces movement and colour. Riley and de Sausmarez maintained a professional friendship until his death in 1969. Riley has often cited his role as an early mentor and de Sausmarez&#x27;s monograph on Riley and her work was published after his death in 1970.

Early in her career, Riley worked as an art teacher for children from 1957 to 1958 at the Convent of the Sacred Heart, Harrow (now known as Sacred Heart Language College). At the Convent of the Sacred Heart, she began a basic design course. Later she worked at the Loughborough School of Art (1959), Hornsey College of Art, and Croydon College of Art (1962–64).

In 1961, she and her partner Peter Sedgley visited the Vaucluse plateau in the South of France, and acquired a derelict farm which they eventually transformed into a studio. Back in London, in the spring of 1962, Victor Musgrave of Gallery One held her first solo exhibition.

In 1968, Riley, with Sedgley and the journalist Peter Townsend, created the artists&#x27; organisation SPACE (Space Provision Artistic Cultural and Educational), with the goal of providing artists large and affordable studio space.

==Seurat&#x27;s way of seeing==

Riley&#x27;s mature style, developed during the 1960s, was influenced by sources like the French Neo-Impressionist artist Georges Seurat. In 2015–6, the Courtauld Gallery, in its exhibition &quot;Bridget Riley: Learning from Seurat&quot;, made the case for how Seurat&#x27;s pointillism influenced her towards abstract painting. As a young artist in 1959, Riley saw &quot;The Bridge at Courbevoie&quot;, owned by the Courtauld, and decided to paint a copy. The resulting work has hung in Riley&#x27;s studio ever since, barring its loan to the gallery for the exhibition, demonstrating in the opinion of the art critic Jonathan Jones &quot;how crucial&quot; Seurat was to her approach to art. Riley described her copy of Seurat&#x27;s painting as a &quot;tool&quot;, interpreted by Jones as meaning that she, like Seurat, practised art &quot;as an optical science&quot;; in his view, Riley &quot;really did forge her optical style by studying Seurat&quot;, making the exhibition a real meeting of old and new. Jones comments that Riley investigated Seurat&#x27;s pointillism by painting from a book illustration of Seurat&#x27;s &quot;Bridge&quot; at an expanded scale to work out how his technique made use of complementary colours, and went on to create pointillist landscapes of her own, such as &quot;Pink Landscape&quot; (1960), painted soon after her Seurat study and portraying the &quot;sun-filled hills of Tuscany&quot; (and shown in the exhibition poster) which Jones writes could readily be taken for a post-impressionist original. In his view, Riley shares Seurat&#x27;s &quot;joy for life&quot;, a simple but radical delight in colour and seeing.

==Work==

It was during this period that Riley began to paint the black and white works for which she first became known. They present a great variety of geometric forms that produce sensations of movement or colour. In the early 1960s, her works were said to induce a variety of sensations in viewers, from seasickness to the feeling of sky diving. From 1961 to 1965, she worked with the contrast of black and white, occasionally introducing tonal scales of grey. Works in this style comprised her first 1962 solo show at Musgrave&#x27;s Gallery One, as well as numerous subsequent shows. For example, in &quot;Fall&quot;, a single perpendiculars curve is repeated to create a field of varying optical frequencies. Visually, these works relate to many concerns of the period: a perceived need for audience participation (this relates them to the Happenings, which were common in this era), challenges to the notion of the mind-body duality which led Aldous Huxley to experiment with hallucinogenic drugs; concerns with a tension between a scientific future which might be very beneficial or might lead to a nuclear war; and fears about the loss of genuine individual experience in a Brave New World. Her paintings since 1961, have been executed by assistants. She meticulously plans her composition&#x27;s design with preparatory drawings and collage techniques; her assistants paint the final canvases with great precision under her instruction.

Riley began investigating colour in 1967, the year in which she produced her first stripe painting. Following a major retrospective in the early 1970s, Riley began travelling extensively. After a trip to Egypt in the early 1980s, where she was inspired by colourful hieroglyphic decoration, Riley began to explore colour and contrast. In some works, lines of colour are used to create a shimmering effect, while in others the canvas is filled with tessellating patterns. Typical of these later colourful works is &quot;Shadow Play&quot;.

Some works are titled after particular dates, others after specific locations (for instance, Les Bassacs, the village near Saint-Saturnin-lès-Apt in the south of France where Riley has a studio).

Following a visit to Egypt in 1980–81, Riley created colours in what she called her &#x27;Egyptian palette&#x27; and produced works such as the &quot;Ka&quot; and &quot;Ra&quot; series, which capture the spirit of the country, ancient and modern, and reflect the colours of the Egyptian landscape. Invoking the sensorial memory of her travels, the paintings produced between 1980 and 1985 exhibit Riley&#x27;s free reconstruction of the restricted chromatic palette discovered abroad. In 1983, for the first time in fifteen years, Riley returned to Venice to once again study the paintings that form the basis of European colourism. Towards the end of the 1980s, Riley&#x27;s work underwent a dramatic change with the reintroduction of the diagonal in the form of a sequence of parallelograms used to disrupt and animate the vertical stripes that had characterized her previous paintings. In &quot;Delos&quot; (1983), for example, blue, turquoise, and emerald hues alternate with rich yellows, reds and white.

===Murals===

Riley has painted temporary murals for the Tate, the Musée d&#x27;Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris and the National Gallery. In 2014, the Imperial College Healthcare Charity Art Collection commissioned her to make a permanent 56-metre mural for St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, London; the work was installed on the 10th floor of the hospital&#x27;s Queen Elizabeth Queen Mother Wing, joining two others she had painted more than 20 years earlier. Between 2017 and 2019 Riley completed a large wall painting for the Chinati Foundation, Marfa, Texas. This was the largest work she had yet undertaken, covering six of the building&#x27;s eight walls. The mural referenced her &quot;Bolt of Colour&quot; of 1983, for the Royal Liverpool University Hospital and made use of a similar palette of Egyptian colours.

===On the nature and role of the artist===
Riley made the following comments regarding artistic work in her lecture &quot;Painting Now&quot;, 23rd William Townsend Memorial Lecture, Slade School of Fine Art, London, 26 November 1996:
===Writer and curator===
Riley has written on artists from Nicolas Poussin to Bruce Nauman. She co-curated &quot;Piet Mondrian: From Nature to Abstraction&quot; (with Sean Rainbird) at the Tate Gallery in 1996. Alongside art historian Robert Kudielka, Riley also served as curator of the 2002 exhibition &quot;Paul Klee: The Nature of Creation&quot;, an exhibition at the Hayward Gallery in London in 2002. In 2010, she curated an artists choice show at the National Gallery in London, choosing large figure paintings by Titian, Veronese, El Greco, Rubens, Poussin, and Paul Cézanne.

==Exhibitions==

In 1965, Riley exhibited in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City show, &quot;The Responsive Eye&quot; (created by curator William C. Seitz); the exhibition which first drew worldwide attention to her work and the Op Art movement. Her painting &quot;Current&quot;, 1964, was reproduced on the cover of the show&#x27;s catalogue. The absence of copyright protection for artists in the United States at the time, saw her work exploited by commercial concerns which caused her to become disillusioned with such exhibitions. Legislation was eventually passed, following an initiative by New York-based artists, in 1967.

She participated in documentas IV (1968) and VI (1977). In 1968, Riley represented Great Britain in the Venice Biennale, where she was the first British contemporary painter, and the first woman, to be awarded the International Prize for painting. Her disciplined work lost ground to the assertive gestures of the Neo-Expressionists in the 1980s, but a 1999 show at the Serpentine Gallery of her early paintings triggered a resurgence of interest in her optical experiments. &quot;Bridget Riley: Reconnaissance&quot;, an exhibition of paintings from the 1960s and 1970s, was presented at Dia:Chelsea in 2000. In 2001, she participated in Site Santa Fe, and in 2003 the Tate Britain organised a major Riley retrospective. In 2005, her work was featured at Gallery Oldham. Between November 2010 and May 2011, her exhibition &quot;Paintings and Related Work&quot; was presented at the National Gallery, London.

In June and July 2014, the retrospective show &quot;Bridget Riley: The Stripe Paintings 1961–2014&quot; was presented at the David Zwirner Gallery in London. In July and August 2015, the retrospective show &quot;Bridget Riley: The Curve Paintings 1961–2014&quot; was presented at the De La Warr Pavilion in Bexhill-on-Sea.

In November 2015, the exhibition &quot;Bridget Riley&quot; opened at David Zwirner in New York. The show features paintings and works on paper by the artist from 1981 to present; the fully illustrated catalogue features an essay by the art historian Richard Shiff and biographical notes compiled by Robert Kudielka.

A retrospective exhibition at the Scottish National Gallery, in partnership with the Hayward Gallery, ran from June to September 2019. It showed early paintings and drawings, black-and-white works of the 1960s, and studies that reveal her working methods. This major exhibition of her work, spanning her 70-year career, was also shown at Hayward Gallery from October 2019 to January 2020.

Riley&#x27;s work was included in the 2021 exhibition &quot;Women in Abstraction&quot; at the Centre Pompidou.

In May 2023 Riley&#x27;s first ceiling painting, &quot;Verve&quot;, was unveiled at The British School at Rome.

==Influence==
Artists Ross Bleckner and Philip Taaffe made paintings paying homage to the work of Riley in the 80s. In 2013, Riley claimed that a wall-sized, black-and-white checkerboard work by Tobias Rehberger plagiarised her painting &quot;Movement in Squares&quot; and asked for it to be removed from display at the Berlin State Library&#x27;s reading room.

==Recognition==
In 1963, Riley was awarded the AICA Critics Prize as well as the John Moores, Liverpool Open Section Prize. A year later, she received a Peter Stuyvesant Foundation Travel bursary. In 1968, she received an International Painting Prize at the Venice Biennale. In 1974, she was named a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. Riley has been given honorary doctorates by Oxford (1993) and Cambridge (1995). In 2003, she was awarded the Praemium Imperiale, and, in 1998, she became one of only 65 Members of the Order of the Companions of Honour in the Commonwealth. As a board member of the National Gallery in the 1980s, she blocked Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s plan to give an adjoining piece of property to developers and thus helped ensure the eventual construction of the museum&#x27;s Sainsbury Wing. Riley has also received the Goslarer Kaiserring of the city of Goslar in 2009 and the 12th Rubens Prize of Siegen in 2012. Also in 2012, she became the first woman to receive the , the Dutch art prize recognising the use of colour.

== Philanthropy ==
Riley is a Patron of Paintings in Hospitals, a charity established in 1959 to provide art for health and social care in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Between 1987 and 2014, she created three murals across the eighth, ninth and tenth floors of the Queen Elizabeth Queen Mother Wing, St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, London.

Since 2016 the Bridget Riley Art Foundation has funded the Bridget Riley Fellowship at the British School at Rome.

In 2017, alongside Yoko Ono and Tracey Emin, Riley donated artworks to an auction to raise money for Modern Art Oxford.

<text>John Sellers (1728 – February 2, 1804) was an American scientist, politician and surveyor from Pennsylvania. He served in the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly, then a unicameral legislature, representing Chester County from 1767 to 1771. He became a member of the Pennsylvania State Senate after its creation, representing Delaware and Philadelphia counties and the city of Philadelphia from 1790 to 1794. He was a founding member of the American Philosophical Society and observed the Transit of Venus in 1769.

==Early life==
John Sellers was born on September (or November) 19, 1728, at Sellers Hall in Upper Darby Township, Pennsylvania, to Sarah (née Smith) and Samuel Sellers. His grandfather Samuel Sellers worked as a weaver and emigrated from Derbyshire.

==Career==
===Surveying career===
Sellers worked as a weaver. He was appointed surveyor by the governor to run a line from Schuylkill to Lancaster to prepare for the Strasburg Road. He was appointed as road commissioner of the Strasburg Road. He was appointed as a surveying engineer of the Union Canal. He was also involved in the Schuylkill-Susquehanna canal study of 1783 and the boundary commission for the newly created Delaware County in 1789.

===American Philosophical Society===
Sellers was one of the original members of the American Philosophical Society. He joined the organization in 1768. Sellers and David Rittenhouse and others were members of the society&#x27;s committee that observed the Transit of Venus in 1769 and reported their observations for the benefit of science.

===Political career===
Sellers was a Federalist. He was a member of the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly (later the Pennsylvania House of Representatives), representing Chester County, from 1767 to 1771. He was appointed one of the Boston Port Bill Committee and was a deputy in the first Provincial Conference of Representatives at Philadelphia on July 14, 1774. These activities on behalf of the Revolution and particularly Sellers&#x27; role in signing the Continental currency led to his disownment by the Society of Friends.

He was a member of the constitutional convention of 1789, representing Delaware. He served in the first session of the Pennsylvania Senate. He represented Delaware and Philadelphia counties and Philadelphia from 1790 to 1794. He was appointed by Governor Thomas Mifflin as associate judge of the Delaware County Court, but declined the appointment.

==Personal life==
Sellers grandson James Sellers was an inventor and had a wire weaving business. His great-great grandson James C. Sellers was a Philadelphia lawyer.

Sellers died on February 2, 1804, in Upper Darby. He was interred at Darby Friends Cemetery.

<doc id="178765" wikidata="Q7376641" url="?curid=178765" title="Ruckus Society">
<text>The Ruckus Society is a nonprofit organization that sponsors skill-sharing and non-violent direct action training, strategy &amp; consultation for activists and organizers from frontline and impacted communities working on social justice, human rights, migrant rights, workers rights and environmental justice. It was founded by Mike Roselle and Twilly Cannon.

== Background ==
In an interview with John Sellers, former executive director and current president of The Ruckus Society, stated that Roselle and Cannon founded The Ruckus Society in the mid-1990s based on the &quot;direct-action model&quot; they learned from Greenpeace.

The name of the organization, explains Sellers, is not an acronym but refers to the term &quot;ruckus&quot;, meaning &quot;a loud, angry interruption, a hullabaloo, a disruption.&quot;

The Ruckus Society&#x27;s mission is to provide training in classic nonviolent direct action and civil disobedience tactics in the context of community-driven campaigns, including creative resistance, urban rappelling, media &amp; communications, and blockades with and without gear.

The organization consists of a small core group of staff members, and a larger team of volunteers in close contact with the leadership. In 2002, the organization had a staff of four full-time employees, roughly thirty volunteers, over 120 people acting as trainers, and over 2,000 graduates of their training opportunities. Volunteers designs custom trainings and camps based on the specific needs and campaigns of the activists, and use popular education techniques to allow participants to discover the direct action knowledge they already possess. According to leadership, The Ruckus Society provides, &quot;non-violence training, media training, direct action planning and strategy, and scouting.&quot;

==Services and collaborations==
The Ruckus Society has co-sponsored projects including the Not Your Soldier Project (NYS), a counter-recruitment effort with the War Resisters League, and the Indigenous Peoples&#x27; Power Project (IP3), bringing together indigenous youth organizers from all over the country.

In 2006, Ruckus teamed up with Working Assets for an Election Protection project. Together with Global Exchange and Rainforest Action Network, they worked against Ford Motor Company and later other auto-manufacturers.

The Ruckus Society is a member of numerous coalitions efforts, and have performed actions for Wal-Mart Watch and others. The group has provided training to Greenpeace, Patagonia, Inc., the California Faculty Association, United Students Against Sweatshops, Students for Bhopal, Student/Farmworker Alliance, the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition, Students for a Free Tibet and Detroit Summer.

The Ruckus Society helped bottomline organizing for the US Social Forum in Detroit in 2010 and hosted a Migrant Rights Action Camp with NDLON at the Highlander Center in 2011.

==Leadership==
John Sellers was the executive director of the organization for 8 years, through the World Trade Organization protests in Seattle in 1999, the creation of IP3 and NYS and his own $2 million bail. Adrienne Maree Brown came on as executive director in 2006, the first woman of color to lead the organization.

The organization created a co-directorship model in 2010 and in 2013 hired a third co-director. Leadership in the organization comes from the network of trainers and the many movements from which they come.

==Impact==
The Ruckus Society is made up of three staff and a network of over 150 action trainers and strategists located primarily in the United States but also distributed throughout the world.

As a movement support organization, The Ruckus Society has trained thousands of organizers and activists throughout the years in non-violent direct action and creative resistance, including those in environmental justice, migrant rights, education justice, forest defense, indigenous rights, workers rights, youth and criminal justice, and eviction defense.

== Funding ==
According to research conducted by social movement scholar Edouard Morena, &quot;over 95 per cent of the Ruckus Society&#x27;s revenues come from &#x27;direct public support&#x27;&quot; and private grants, not governmental grants. This type of funding includes donations for individuals, foundations, and other organizations. In 2000, the organization had a budget of $370,000. Major funders of The Ruckus Society have included the Turner Foundation, the Ben and Jerry&#x27;s Foundation, and the Ecology Center Inc.

==Criticism==
In its early years, The Ruckus Society was criticized for being composed of largely privileged white activists, which has been acknowledged. This led the leadership to attempt to diversify its causes and leadership. Since the mid-2000s The Ruckus Society has collaborated with numerous groups representing Indigenous environmental concerns, migrant rights, and Detroit-based environmental groups.

The organization has also been critiqued for its lack of transparency around funding sources. This has prompted attempts at investigating the sources of their funding.

The Ruckus Society has been the target of conservative outlets who describe the group as violent anarchists, and as being responsible for training criminal activists who participate in vandalism and destruction of private property.

<doc id="178766" wikidata="Q464271" url="?curid=178766" title="AFL-CIO">
<text>The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) is a national trade union center that is the largest federation of unions in the United States. It is made up of 61 national and international unions, together representing nearly 15 million active and retired workers. The AFL-CIO engages in substantial political spending and activism, typically in support of progressive and pro-labor policies.

The AFL-CIO was formed in 1955 when the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations merged after a long estrangement. Union membership in the US peaked in 1979, when the AFL-CIO&#x27;s affiliated unions had nearly twenty million members. From 1955 until 2005, the AFL-CIO&#x27;s member unions represented nearly all unionized workers in the United States. Several large unions split away from AFL-CIO and formed the rival Change to Win Federation in 2005, although a number of those unions have since re-affiliated, and many locals of Change to Win are either part of or work with their local central labor councils. The largest unions currently in the AFL-CIO are the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), with 2 million members, American Federation of Teachers (AFT) with approximately 1.7 million members, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), with approximately 1.4 million members, and United Food and Commercial Workers with 1.2 million members.

== Membership ==
The AFL-CIO is a federation of international labor unions. As a voluntary federation, the AFL-CIO has little authority over the affairs of its member unions except in extremely limited cases (such as the ability to expel a member union for corruption and enforce resolution of disagreements over jurisdiction or organizing). As of January 2025, the AFL-CIO had 61 member unions representing nearly 15 million members.

== Political activities ==
The AFL-CIO was a major component of the New Deal Coalition that dominated politics into the mid-1960s. Although it has lost membership, finances, and political clout since 1970, it remains a major player on the liberal side of national politics, with a great deal of activity in lobbying, grassroots organizing, coordinating with other liberal organizations, fund-raising, and recruiting and supporting candidates around the country.

In recent years the AFL-CIO has concentrated its political efforts on lobbying in Washington and the state capitals, and on &quot;GOTV&quot; (get-out-the-vote) campaigns in major elections. For example, in the 2010 midterm elections, it sent 28.6 million pieces of mail. Members received a &quot;slate card&quot; with a list of union endorsements matched to the member&#x27;s congressional district, along with a &quot;personalized&quot; letter from President Obama emphasizing the importance of voting. In addition, 100,000 volunteers went door-to-door to promote endorsed candidates to 13 million union voters in 32 states.

== Governance ==
The AFL-CIO is governed by its members, who meet in a quadrennial convention. Each member union elects delegates, based on proportional representation. The AFL-CIO&#x27;s state federations, central and local labor councils, constitutional departments, and constituent groups are also entitled to delegates. The delegates elect officers and vice presidents, debate and approve policy, and set dues.

=== Annual meetings ===
From 1951 to 1996, the Executive Council held its winter meeting in the resort town of Bal Harbour, Florida. The meeting at the Bal Harbour Sheraton has been the object of frequent criticism, including over a labor dispute at the hotel itself.

Citing image concerns, the council changed the meeting site to Los Angeles. However, the meeting was moved back to Bal Harbour several years later. The 2012 meeting was held in Orlando, Florida.

=== State and local bodies ===
The AFL-CIO constitution permits international unions to pay state federation and central labor council (CLC) dues directly, rather than have each local or state federation pay them. This relieves each union&#x27;s state and local affiliates of the administrative duty of assessing, collecting and paying the dues. International unions assess the AFL-CIO dues themselves, and collect them on top of their own dues-generating mechanisms or simply pay them out of the dues the international collects. But not all international unions pay their required state federation and CLC dues.

=== Constitutional departments ===
One of the most well-known departments was the Industrial Union Department (IUD). It had been constitutionally mandated by the new AFL-CIO constitution created by the merger of the AFL and CIO in 1955, as CIO unions felt that the AFL&#x27;s commitment to industrial unionism was not strong enough to permit the department to survive without a constitutional mandate. For many years, the IUD was a &quot;de facto&quot; organizing department in the AFL-CIO. For example, it provided money to the near-destitute American Federation of Teachers (AFT) as it attempted to organize the United Federation of Teachers in 1961. The organizing money enabled the AFT to win the election and establish its first large collective bargaining affiliate. For many years, the IUD remained rather militant on a number of issues.

There are six AFL-CIO constitutionally mandated departments:
* North America&#x27;s Building Trades Unions
* Maritime Trades Department, AFL-CIO
* Metal Trades Department, AFL-CIO
* Department for Professional Employees, AFL-CIO
* Transportation Trades Department, AFL-CIO
* Union Label and Service Trades Department, AFL-CIO

== Constituency groups ==
Constituency groups are nonprofit organizations chartered and funded by the AFL-CIO as voter registration and mobilization bodies. These groups conduct research, host training and educational conferences, issue research reports and publications, lobby for legislation and build coalitions with local groups. Each constituency group has the right to sit in on AFL-CIO executive council meetings, and to exercise representational and voting rights at AFL-CIO conventions.

The AFL-CIO&#x27;s seven constituency groups include the A. Philip Randolph Institute, the AFL-CIO Union Veterans Council, the Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance, the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists, the Coalition of Labor Union Women, the Labor Council for Latin American Advancement and Pride at Work.

== Allied organizations ==
The Working for America Institute started out as a department of the AFL-CIO. Established in 1958, it was previously known as the Human Resources Development Institute (HRDI). John Sweeney renamed the department and spun it off as an independent organization in 1998 to act as a lobbying group to promote economic development, develop new economic policies, and lobby Congress on economic policy. The American Center for International Labor Solidarity started out as the Free Trade Union Committee (FTUC), which internationally promoted free labor-unions.

Other organizations that are allied with the AFL-CIO include:
* Alliance for Retired Americans
* Solidarity Center
* American Rights at Work
* International Labor Communications Association
* Jobs with Justice
* Labor Heritage Foundation
* Labor and Working-Class History Association
* National Day Laborer Organizing Network
* United Students Against Sweatshops
* Working America
* Working for America Institute
* Ohio Organizing Collaborative

== Programs ==
Programs are organizations established and controlled by the AFL-CIO to serve certain organizational goals. Programs of the AFL-CIO include the AFL-CIO Building Investment Trust, the AFL-CIO Employees Federal Credit Union, the AFL-CIO Housing Investment Trust, the National Labor College and Union Privilege.

== International policy ==
The AFL-CIO is affiliated to the Brussels-based International Trade Union Confederation, formed November 1, 2006. The new body incorporated the member organizations of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, of which the AFL-CIO had long been part. The AFL-CIO had had a very active foreign policy in building and strengthening free trade unions. During the Cold War, it vigorously opposed Communist unions in Latin America and Europe. In opposing Communism, it helped split the CGT in France and helped create the anti-Communist Force Ouvrière.

According to the cybersecurity firm Area 1, hackers working for the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Strategic Support Force compromised the networks of the AFL-CIO in order to gain information on negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

== History ==
=== Civil rights ===

The AFL-CIO has a long relationship with civil rights struggles. One of the major points of contention between the AFL and the CIO, particularly in the era immediately after the CIO split off, was the CIO&#x27;s willingness to include black workers (excluded by the AFL in its focus on craft unionism). Later, black workers would also criticize the CIO for abandoning their interests, particularly after the merger with the AFL.

In 1961, Martin Luther King Jr. gave a speech titled &quot;If the Negro Wins, Labor Wins&quot; to the organization&#x27;s convention in Bal Harbour, Florida. King hoped for a coalition between civil rights and labor that would improve the situation for the entire working class by ending racial discrimination. However, King also criticized the AFL-CIO for its tolerance of unions that excluded black workers. &quot;I would be lacking in honesty,&quot; he told the delegates of the 1965 Illinois AFL-CIO Convention during his keynote address, &quot;if I did not point out that the labor movement of thirty years ago did more in that period for civil rights than labor is doing today...Our combined strength is potentially enormous, but we have not used a fraction of it for our own good or the needs of society as a whole.&quot; King and the AFL-CIO diverged further in 1967, when King announced his opposition to the Vietnam War, which the AFL-CIO strongly supported. The AFL-CIO endorsed the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

====Police violence====

In the 21st century, the AFL-CIO has been criticized by campaigners against police violence for its affiliation with the International Union of Police Associations (IUPA). On May 31, 2020, the AFL-CIO offices in Washington, DC, were set on fire during the George Floyd protests taking place in the city. In response, AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka condemned both the murder of George Floyd and the destruction of the offices, but did not address demands to end the organization&#x27;s affiliation with the IUPA.

===Triumph and disaster: the politics of the 1960s and 70s===
After the smashing electoral victory of President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, the heavily Democratic Congress passed a raft of liberal legislation. Labor union leaders claimed credit for the widest range of liberal laws since the New Deal era, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964; the Voting Rights Act of 1965; the War on Poverty; aid to cities and education; increased Social Security benefits; and Medicare for the elderly. The 1966 elections were an unexpected disaster, with defeats for many of the more liberal Democrats. According to Alan Draper, the AFL-CIO Committee on Political Action (COPE) was the main electioneering unit of the labor movement. It ignored the white backlash against civil rights. The COPE assumed falsely that union members were interested in issues of greatest salience to union leadership, but polls showed this was not true. The members were much more conservative. The younger ones were deeply concerned about taxes and crime, and the older ones had more conservative social views. Furthermore, a new issue—the War in Vietnam—was bitterly splitting the New Deal coalition into hawks (led by Johnson and Vice President Hubert Humphrey) and doves (led by Senators Eugene McCarthy and Robert Kennedy). The AFL-CIO continued to experience political defeats in the 1970s, particularly when it came to the Democratic nomination of George McGovern in 1972. The federation leaders were opposed to McGovern&#x27;s stance on issues such as the Vietnam War. Although they attempted to stop the nomination at the Democratic National Convention of 1972, their attempts proved to be futile as they realized the chokehold they had on politics was giving way to a more diverse set of delegates. This marked a turning point in the political power they held as a federation in the U.S.

=== New Unity Partnership ===
In 2003, the AFL-CIO began an intense internal debate over the future of the labor movement in the United States with the creation of the New Unity Partnership (NUP), a loose coalition of some of the AFL-CIO&#x27;s largest unions. This debate intensified in 2004, after the defeat of labor-backed candidate John Kerry in the November 2004 US presidential election. The NUP&#x27;s program for reform of the federation included reduction of the central bureaucracy, more money spent on organizing new members rather than on electoral politics, and a restructuring of unions and locals, eliminating some smaller locals and focusing more along the lines of industrial unionism.

In 2005, the NUP dissolved and the Change to Win Federation (CtW) formed, threatening to secede from the AFL-CIO if its demands for major reorganization were not met. As the AFL-CIO prepared for its 50th anniversary convention in late July, three of the federations&#x27; four largest unions announced their withdrawal from the federation: the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (&quot;The Teamsters&quot;), and the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW). UNITE HERE disaffiliated in mid-September 2005, the United Farm Workers left in January 2006, and the Laborers&#x27; International Union of North America disaffiliated on June 1, 2006.

Two unions later left CtW and rejoined the AFL-CIO. After a bitter internal leadership dispute that involved allegations of embezzlement and accusations that SEIU was attempting to raid the union, a substantial number of UNITE HERE members formed their own union (Workers United) while the remainder of UNITE HERE reaffiliated with the AFL-CIO on September 17, 2009. The Laborers&#x27; International Union of North America said on August 13, 2010, that it would also leave Change to Win and rejoin the AFL-CIO in October 2010. The Service Employees International Union (SEIU) also rejoined the AFL-CIO in January 2025.

=== ILWU disaffiliation ===
In August 2013, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) disaffiliated from the AFL-CIO. The ILWU said that members of other AFL-CIO unions were crossing its picket lines, and the AFL-CIO had done nothing to stop it. The ILWU also cited the AFL-CIO&#x27;s willingness to compromise on key policies such as labor law reform, immigration reform, and health care reform. The longshoremen&#x27;s union said it would become an independent union.

=== Norfolk Southern proxy fight ===
In 2024, AFL-CIO voiced its opposition to an investor-led plan at Norfolk Southern Railway to replace the company&#x27;s top management and several board members. Organized labor is divided on the issue, which is the major sticking point of a proxy battle between NS management and investors ahead of a May 9, 2024 shareholder meeting. AFL-CIO came out and voiced its support for Norfolk&#x27;s CEO Alan Shaw, citing concerns about safety, service, and job losses. The union criticized the proposal to replace Shaw and implement a system known as precision railroading.

<text>Intravenous therapy (abbreviated as IV therapy) is a medical technique that administers fluids, medications and nutrients directly into a person&#x27;s vein. The intravenous route of administration is commonly used for rehydration or to provide nutrients for those who cannot, or will not—due to reduced mental states or otherwise—consume food or water by mouth. It may also be used to administer medications or other medical therapy such as blood products or electrolytes to correct electrolyte imbalances. Attempts at providing intravenous therapy have been recorded as early as the 1400s, but the practice did not become widespread until the 1900s after the development of techniques for safe, effective use.

The intravenous route is the fastest way to deliver medications and fluid replacement throughout the body as they are introduced directly into the circulatory system and thus quickly distributed. For this reason, the intravenous route of administration is also used for the consumption of some recreational drugs. Many therapies are administered as a &quot;bolus&quot; or one-time dose, but they may also be administered as an extended &quot;infusion&quot; or &quot;drip&quot;. The act of administering a therapy intravenously, or placing an intravenous line (&quot;IV line&quot;) for later use, is a procedure which should only be performed by a skilled professional. The most basic intravenous access consists of a needle piercing the skin and entering a vein which is connected to a syringe or to external tubing. This is used to administer the desired therapy. In cases where a patient is likely to receive many such interventions in a short period (with consequent risk of trauma to the vein), normal practice is to insert a cannula which leaves one end in the vein, and subsequent therapies can be administered easily through tubing at the other end. In some cases, multiple medications or therapies are administered through the same IV line.

IV lines are classified as &quot;central lines&quot; if they end in a large vein close to the heart, or as &quot;peripheral lines&quot; if their output is to a small vein in the periphery, such as the arm. An IV line can be threaded through a peripheral vein to end near the heart, which is termed a &quot;peripherally inserted central catheter&quot; or PICC line. If a person is likely to need long-term intravenous therapy, a medical port may be implanted to enable easier repeated access to the vein without having to pierce the vein repeatedly. A catheter can also be inserted into a central vein through the chest, which is known as a tunneled line. The specific type of catheter used and site of insertion are affected by the desired substance to be administered and the health of the veins in the desired site of insertion.

Placement of an IV line may cause pain, as it necessarily involves piercing the skin. Infections and inflammation (termed phlebitis) are also both common side effects of an IV line. Phlebitis may be more likely if the same vein is used repeatedly for intravenous access, and can eventually develop into a hard cord which is unsuitable for IV access. The unintentional administration of a therapy outside a vein, termed extravasation or infiltration, may cause other side effects.
==Uses==
===Medical uses===

Intravenous (IV) access is used to administer medications and fluid replacement which must be distributed throughout the body, especially when rapid distribution is desired. Another use of IV administration is the avoidance of first-pass metabolism in the liver. Substances that may be infused intravenously include volume expanders, blood-based products, blood substitutes, medications and nutrition.

====Fluid solutions====

Fluids may be administered as part of &quot;volume expansion&quot;, or fluid replacement, through the intravenous route. Volume expansion consists of the administration of fluid-based solutions or suspensions designed to target specific areas of the body which need more water. There are two main types of volume expander: crystalloids and colloids. Crystalloids are aqueous solutions of mineral salts or other water-soluble molecules. Colloids contain larger insoluble molecules, such as gelatin. Blood itself is considered a colloid.

The most commonly used crystalloid fluid is normal saline, a solution of sodium chloride at 0.9% concentration, which is isotonic with blood. Lactated Ringer&#x27;s (also known as &quot;Ringer&#x27;s lactate&quot;) and the closely related &quot;Ringer&#x27;s acetate&quot;, are mildly hypotonic solutions often used in those who have significant burns. Colloids preserve a high colloid osmotic pressure in the blood, while, on the other hand, this parameter is decreased by crystalloids due to hemodilution. Crystalloids generally are much cheaper than colloids.

Buffer solutions which are used to correct acidosis or alkalosis are also administered through intravenous access. Lactated Ringer&#x27;s solution used as a fluid expander or base solution to which medications are added also has some buffering effect. Another solution administered intravenously as a buffering solution is sodium bicarbonate.

====Medication and treatment====

Medications may be mixed into the fluids mentioned above, commonly normal saline, or dextrose solutions. Compared with other routes of administration, such as oral medications, the IV route is the fastest way to deliver fluids and medications throughout the body. For this reason, the IV route is commonly preferred in emergency situations or when a fast onset of action is desirable. In extremely high blood pressure (termed a hypertensive emergency), IV antihypertensives may be given to quickly decrease the blood pressure in a controlled manner to prevent organ damage. In atrial fibrillation, IV amiodarone may be administered to attempt to restore normal heart rhythm. IV medications can also be used for chronic health conditions such as cancer, for which chemotherapy drugs are commonly administered intravenously. In some cases, such as with vancomycin, a loading or bolus dose of medicine is given before beginning a dosing regimen to more quickly increase the concentration of medication in the blood.

The bioavailability of an IV medication is by definition 100%, unlike oral administration where medication may not be fully absorbed, or may be metabolized prior to entering the bloodstream. For some medications, there is virtually zero oral bioavailability. For this reason certain types of medications can only be given intravenously, as there is insufficient uptake by other routes of administration, such is the case of severe dehydration where the patient is required to be treated via IV therapy for a quick recovery. The unpredictability of oral bioavailability in different people is also a reason for a medication to be administered IV, as with furosemide. Oral medications also may be less desirable if a person is nauseous or vomiting, or has severe diarrhea, as these may prevent the medicine from being fully absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. In these cases, a medication may be given IV only until the patient can tolerate an oral form of the medication. The switch from IV to oral administration is usually performed as soon as viable, as there is generally cost and time savings over IV administration. Whether a medication can be potentially switched to an oral form is sometimes considered when choosing appropriate antibiotic therapy for use in a hospital setting, as a person is unlikely to be discharged if they still require IV therapy.

Some medications, such as aprepitant, are chemically modified to be better suited for IV administration, forming a prodrug such as fosaprepitant. This can be for pharmacokinetic reasons or to delay the effect of the drug until it can be metabolized into the active form.

====Blood products====

A blood product (or &quot;blood-based product&quot;) is any component of blood which is collected from a donor for use in a blood transfusion. Blood transfusions can be used in massive blood loss due to trauma, or can be used to replace blood lost during surgery. Blood transfusions may also be used to treat a severe anaemia or thrombocytopenia caused by a blood disease. Early blood transfusions consisted of whole blood, but modern medical practice commonly uses only components of the blood, such as packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate.

====Nutrition====
Parenteral nutrition is the act of providing required nutrients to a person through an intravenous line. This is used in people who are unable to get nutrients normally, by eating and digesting food. A person receiving parenteral nutrition will be given an intravenous solution which may contain salts, dextrose, amino acids, lipids and vitamins. The exact formulation of a parenteral nutrition used will depend on the specific nutritional needs of the person it is being given to. If a person is only receiving nutrition intravenously, it is called total parenteral nutrition (TPN), whereas if a person is only receiving some of their nutrition intravenously it is called partial parenteral nutrition (or supplemental parenteral nutrition).

====Imaging====

Medical imaging relies on being able to clearly distinguish internal parts of the body from each other. One way this is accomplished is through the administration of a contrast agent into a vein. The specific imaging technique being employed will determine the characteristics of an appropriate contrast agent to increase visibility of blood vessels or other features. Common contrast agents are administered into a peripheral vein from which they are distributed throughout the circulation to the imaging site.

===Other uses===
====Use in sports====
IV rehydration was formerly a common technique for athletes. The World Anti-Doping Agency prohibits intravenous injection of more than 100 mL per 12 hours, except under a medical exemption. The United States Anti-Doping Agency notes that, as well as the dangers inherent in IV therapy, &quot;IVs can be used to change blood test results (such as hematocrit where EPO or blood doping is being used), mask urine test results (by dilution) or by administering prohibited substances in a way that will more quickly be cleared from the body in order to beat an anti-doping test&quot;. Players suspended after attending &quot;boutique IV clinics&quot; which offer this sort of treatment include footballer Samir Nasri in 2017 and swimmer Ryan Lochte in 2018.

====Use for hangover treatment====
In the 1960s, John Myers developed the &quot;Myers&#x27; cocktail&quot;, a non-prescription IV solution of vitamins and minerals marketed as a hangover cure and general wellness remedy. The first &quot;boutique IV&quot; clinic, offering similar treatments, opened in Tokyo in 2008. These clinics, whose target market was described by &quot;Elle&quot; as &quot;health nuts who moonlight as heavy drinkers&quot;, have been publicized in the 2010s by glamorous celebrity customers. Intravenous therapy is also used in people with acute ethanol toxicity to correct electrolyte and vitamin deficiencies which arise from alcohol consumption.

====Others====

In some countries, non-prescription intravenous glucose is used to improve a person&#x27;s energy, but is not a part of routine medical care in countries such as the United States where glucose solutions are prescription drugs. Improperly administered intravenous glucose (called &quot;ringer&quot; ), such as that which is administered clandestinely in store-front clinics, poses increased risks due to improper technique and oversight. Intravenous access is also sometimes used outside of a medical setting for the self-administration of recreational drugs, such as heroin and fentanyl, cocaine, methamphetamine, DMT, and others.

Intravenous therapy is also used for veterinary patient management.

==Types==
===Bolus===
Some medications can be administered as a bolus dose, which is called an &quot;IV push&quot;. A syringe containing the medication is connected to an access port in the primary tubing and the medication is administered through the port. A bolus may be administered rapidly (with a fast depression of the syringe plunger) or may be administered slowly, over the course of a few minutes. The exact administration technique depends on the medication and other factors. In some cases, a bolus of plain IV solution (i.e. without medication added) is administered immediately after the bolus to further force the medicine into the bloodstream. This procedure is termed an &quot;IV flush&quot;. Certain medications, such as potassium, are not able to be administered by IV push due to the extremely rapid onset of action and high level of effects.

===Infusion===
An infusion of medication may be used when it is desirable to have a constant blood concentration of a medication over time, such as with some antibiotics including beta-lactams. Continuous infusions, where the next infusion is begun immediately following the completion of the prior, may also be used to limit variation in drug concentration in the blood (i.e. between the peak drug levels and the trough drug levels). They may also be used instead of intermittent bolus injections for the same reason, such as with furosemide. Infusions can also be intermittent, in which case the medication is administered over a period of time, then stopped, and this is later repeated. Intermittent infusion may be used when there are concerns about the stability of medicine in solution for long periods of time (as is common with continuous infusions), or to enable the administration of medicines which would be incompatible if administered at the same time in the same IV line, for example vancomycin.

Failure to properly calculate and administer an infusion can result in adverse effects, termed infusion reactions. For this reason, many medications have a maximum recommended infusion rate, such as vancomycin and many monoclonal antibodies. These infusion reactions can be severe, such as in the case of vancomycin, where the reaction is termed &quot;red man syndrome&quot;.

===Secondary===
Any additional medication to be administered intravenously at the same time as an infusion may be connected to the primary tubing; this is termed a secondary IV, or IV piggyback. This prevents the need for multiple IV access lines on the same person. When administering a secondary IV medication, the primary bag is held lower than the secondary bag so that the secondary medication can flow into the primary tubing, rather than fluid from the primary bag flowing into the secondary tubing. The fluid from the primary bag is needed to help flush any remaining medication from the secondary IV from the tubing. If a bolus or secondary infusion is intended for administration in the same line as a primary infusion, the molecular compatibility of the solutions must be considered. Secondary compatibility is generally referred to as &quot;y-site compatibility&quot;, named after the shape of the tubing which has a port for bolus administration. Incompatibility of two fluids or medications can arise due to issues of molecular stability, changes in solubility, or degradation of one of the medications.

==Methods and equipment==
===Access===

The simplest form of intravenous access is by passing a hollow needle through the skin directly into a vein. A syringe can be connected directly to this needle, which allows for a &quot;bolus&quot; dose to be administered. Alternatively, the needle may be placed and then connected to a length of tubing, allowing for an infusion to be administered. The type and location of venous access (i.e. a central line versus peripheral line, and in which vein the line is placed) can be affected by the potential for some medications to cause peripheral vasoconstriction, which limits circulation to peripheral veins.

A peripheral cannula is the most common intravenous access method utilized in hospitals, pre-hospital care, and outpatient medicine. This may be placed in the arm, commonly either the wrist or the median cubital vein at the elbow. A tourniquet may be used to restrict the venous drainage of the limb and make the vein bulge, making it easier to locate and place a line in a vein. When used, a tourniquet should be removed before injecting medication to prevent extravasation. The part of the catheter that remains outside the skin is called the connecting hub; it can be connected to a syringe or an intravenous infusion line, or capped with a or saline lock, a needleless connection filled with a small amount of heparin or saline solution to prevent clotting, between uses of the catheter. Ported cannulae have an injection port on the top that is often used to administer medicine.

The thickness and size of needles and catheters can be given in Birmingham gauge or French gauge. A Birmingham gauge of 14 is a very large cannula (used in resuscitation settings) and 24-26 is the smallest. The most common sizes are 16-gauge (midsize line used for blood donation and transfusion), 18- and 20-gauge (all-purpose line for infusions and blood draws), and 22-gauge (all-purpose pediatric line). 12- and 14-gauge peripheral lines are capable of delivering large volumes of fluid very fast, accounting for their popularity in emergency medicine. These lines are frequently called &quot;large bores&quot; or &quot;trauma lines&quot;.

====Peripheral lines====
A peripheral intravenous line is inserted in peripheral veins, such as the veins in the arms, hands, legs and feet. Medication administered in this way travels through the veins to the heart, from where it is distributed to the rest of the body through the circulatory system. The size of the peripheral vein limits the amount and rate of medication which can be administered safely. A peripheral line consists of a short catheter inserted through the skin into a peripheral vein. This is usually in the form of a cannula-over-needle device, in which a flexible plastic cannula comes mounted over a metal trocar. Once the tip of the needle and cannula are placed, the cannula is advanced inside the vein over the trocar to the appropriate position and secured. The trocar is then withdrawn and discarded. Blood samples may also be drawn from the line directly after the initial IV cannula insertion.


====Central lines====

A central line is an access method in which a catheter empties into a larger, more central vein (a vein within the torso), usually the superior vena cava, inferior vena cava or the right atrium of the heart. There are several types of central IV access, categorized based on the route the catheter takes from the outside of the body to the central vein output.

==== Peripherally inserted central catheter ====

A peripherally inserted central catheter (also called a PICC line) is a type of central IV access which consists of a cannula inserted through a sheath into a peripheral vein and then carefully fed towards the heart, terminating at the superior vena cava or the right atrium. These lines are usually placed in peripheral veins in the arm, and may be placed using the Seldinger technique under ultrasound guidance. An X-ray is used to verify that the end of the cannula is in the right place if fluoroscopy was not used during the insertion. An EKG can also be used in some cases to determine if the end of the cannula is in the correct location.

====Tunneled lines====
A tunneled line is a type of central access which is inserted under the skin, and then travels a significant distance through surrounding tissue before reaching and penetrating the central vein. Using a tunneled line reduces the risk of infection as compared to other forms of access, as bacteria from the skin surface are not able to travel directly into the vein. These catheters are often made of materials that resist infection and clotting. Types of tunneled central lines include the Hickman line or Broviac catheter. A tunnelled line is an option for long term venous access necessary for hemodialysis in people with poor kidney function.
====Implantable ports====

An implanted port is a central line that does not have an external connector protruding from the skin for administration of medication. Instead, a port consists of a small reservoir covered with silicone rubber which is implanted under the skin, which then covers the reservoir. Medication is administered by injecting medication through the skin and the silicone port cover into the reservoir. When the needle is withdrawn, the reservoir cover reseals itself. A port cover is designed to function for hundreds of needle sticks during its lifetime. Ports may be placed in an arm or in the chest area.

===Infusions===
Equipment used to place and administer an IV line for infusion consists of a bag, usually hanging above the height of the person, and sterile tubing through which the medicine is administered. In a basic &quot;gravity&quot; IV, a bag is simply hung above the height of the person and the solution is pulled via gravity through a tube attached to a needle inserted into a vein. Without extra equipment, it is not possible to precisely control the rate of administration. For this reason, a setup may also incorporate a clamp to regulate flow. Some IV lines may be placed with &quot;Y-sites&quot;, devices which enable a secondary solution to be administered through the same line (known as piggybacking). Some systems employ a drip chamber, which prevents air from entering the bloodstream (causing an air embolism), and allows visual estimation of flow rate of the solution.

Alternatively, an infusion pump allows precise control over the flow rate and total amount delivered. A pump is programmed based on the number and size of infusions being administered to ensure all medicine is fully administered without allowing the access line to run dry. Pumps are primarily utilized when a constant flow rate is important, or where changes in rate of administration would have consequences.

===Techniques===
To reduce pain associated with the procedure, medical staff may apply a topical local anaesthetic (such as EMLA or Ametop) to the skin of the chosen venipuncture area about 45 minutes beforehand.
If the cannula is not inserted correctly, or the vein is particularly fragile and ruptures, blood may extravasate into the surrounding tissues; this situation is known as a blown vein or &quot;tissuing&quot;. Using this cannula to administer medications causes extravasation of the drug, which can lead to edema, causing pain and tissue damage, and even necrosis depending on the medication. The person attempting to obtain the access must find a new access site proximal to the &quot;blown&quot; area to prevent extravasation of medications through the damaged vein. For this reason it is advisable to site the first cannula at the most distal appropriate vein.

==Adverse effects==
===Pain===
Placement of an intravenous line inherently causes pain when the skin is broken and is considered medically invasive. For this reason, when other forms of administration may suffice, intravenous therapy is usually not preferred. This includes the treatment of mild or moderate dehydration with oral rehydration therapy which is an option, as opposed to parenteral rehydration through an IV line. Children in emergency departments being treated for dehydration have better outcomes with oral treatment than intravenous therapy due to the pain and complications of an intravenous line. Cold spray may decrease the pain of putting in an IV.

Certain medications also have specific sensations of pain associated with their administration IV. This includes potassium, which when administered IV can cause a burning or painful sensation. The incidence of side effects specific to a medication can be affected by the type of access (peripheral versus central), the rate of administration, or the quantity of drug administered. When medications are administered too rapidly through an IV line, a set of vague symptoms such as redness or rash, fever, and others may occur; this is termed an &quot;infusion reaction&quot; and is prevented by decreasing the rate of administration of the medication. When vancomycin is involved, this is commonly termed &quot;Red Man syndrome&quot; after the rapid flushing which occurs after rapid administration.

===Infection and inflammation===
As placement of an intravenous line requires breaking the skin, there is a risk of infection. Skin-dwelling organisms such as coagulase-negative staphylococcus or &quot;Candida albicans&quot; may enter through the insertion site around the catheter, or bacteria may be accidentally introduced inside the catheter from contaminated equipment. Infection of an IV access site is usually local, causing easily visible swelling, redness, and fever. However, pathogens may also enter the bloodstream, causing sepsis, which can be sudden and life-threatening. A central IV line poses a higher risk of sepsis, as it can deliver bacteria directly into the central circulation. A line which has been in place for a longer period of time also increases the risk of infection.

Inflammation of the vein may also occur, called thrombophlebitis or simply phlebitis. This may be caused by infection, the catheter itself, or the specific fluids or medication being given. Repeated instances of phlebitis can cause scar tissue to build up along a vein. A peripheral IV line cannot be left in the vein indefinitely out of concern for the risk of infection and phlebitis, among other potential complications. However, recent studies have found that there is no increased risk of complications in those whose IVs were replaced only when clinically indicated versus those whose IVs were replaced routinely. If placed with proper aseptic technique, it is not recommended to change a peripheral IV line more frequently than every 72–96 hours.

Phlebitis is particularly common in intravenous drug users, and those undergoing chemotherapy, whose veins can become sclerotic and difficult to access over time, sometimes forming a hard, painful &quot;venous cord&quot;. The presence of a cord is a cause of discomfort and pain associated with IV therapy, and makes it more difficult for an IV line to be placed as a line cannot be placed in an area with a cord.

===Infiltration and extravasation===

Infiltration occurs when a non-vesicant IV fluid or medication enters the surrounding tissue as opposed to the desired vein. It may occur when the vein itself ruptures, when the vein is damaged during insertion of the intravascular access device, or from increased vein porosity. Infiltration may also occur if the puncture of the vein by the needle becomes the path of least resistance—such as a cannula which has been left inserted, causing the vein to scar. It can also occur upon insertion of an IV line if a tourniquet is not promptly removed. Infiltration is characterized by coolness and pallor to the skin as well as localized swelling or edema. It is treated by removing the intravenous line and elevating the affected limb so the collected fluids drain away. Injections of hyaluronidase around the area can be used to speed the dispersal of the fluid/drug. Infiltration is one of the most common adverse effects of IV therapy and is usually not serious unless the infiltrated fluid is a medication damaging to the surrounding tissue, most commonly a vesicant or chemotherapeutic agent. In such cases, the infiltration is termed extravasation, and may cause necrosis.

===Others===
If the solutions administered are colder than the temperature of the body, induced hypothermia can occur. If the temperature change to the heart is rapid, ventricular fibrillation may result. Furthermore, if a solution which is not balanced in concentration is administered, a person&#x27;s electrolytes may become imbalanced. In hospitals, regular blood tests may be used to proactively monitor electrolyte levels.

== History ==
===Discovery and development===
The first recorded attempt at administering a therapeutic substance via IV injection was in 1492, when Pope Innocent VIII fell ill and was administered blood from healthy individuals. If this occurred, the treatment did not work and resulted in the death of the donors while not healing the pope. This story is disputed by some, who claim that the idea of blood transfusions could not have been considered by the medical professionals at the time, or that a complete description of blood circulation was not published until over 100 years later. The story is attributed to potential errors in translation of documents from the time, as well as potentially an intentional fabrication, whereas others still consider it to be accurate. One of the leading medical history textbooks for medical and nursing students has claimed that the entire story was an anti-semitic fabrication.

In 1656 Sir Christopher Wren and Robert Boyle worked on the subject. As stated by Wren, &quot;I Have Injected Wine and Ale in a liveing Dog into the Mass of Blood by a Veine, in good Quantities, till I have made him extremely drunk, but soon after he Pisseth it out.&quot; The dog survived, grew fat, and was later stolen from his owner. Boyle attributed authorship to Wren.

Richard Lower showed it was possible for blood to be transfused from animal to animal and from animal to man intravenously, a xenotransfusion. He worked with Edmund King to transfuse sheep&#x27;s blood into a man who was mentally ill. Lower was interested in advancing science but also believed the man could be helped, either by the infusion of fresh blood or by the removal of old blood. It was difficult to find people who would agree to be transfused, but an eccentric scholar, Arthur Coga, consented and the procedure was carried out by Lower and King before the Royal Society on 23 November 1667. Transfusion gathered some popularity in France and Italy, but medical and theological debates arose, resulting in transfusion being prohibited in France.

There was virtually no recorded success with any attempts at injection therapy until the 1800s, when in 1831 Thomas Latta studied the use of IV fluid replacements for cholera treatment. The first solutions which saw widespread use for IV injections were simple &quot;saline-like solutions&quot;, which were followed by experiments with various other liquids, including milk, sugar, honey, and egg yolk. In the 1830s, James Blundell, an English obstetrician, used intravenous administration of blood to treat women bleeding profusely during or after delivery. This predated the understanding of blood type, leading to unpredictable results.

===Modern usage===
Intravenous therapy was expanded by Italian physician Guido Baccelli in the late 1890s and further developed in the 1930s by Samuel Hirschfeld, Harold T. Hyman and Justine Johnstone Wanger but was not widely available until the 1950s. There was a time, roughly the 1910s–1920s, when fluid replacement that today would be done intravenously was likelier to be done with a Murphy drip, a rectal infusion; and IV therapy took years to increasingly displace that route. In the 1960s, the concept of providing a person&#x27;s complete nutritional needs through an IV solution began to be seriously considered. The first parenteral nutrition supplementation consisted of hydrolyzed proteins and dextrose. This was followed in 1975 with the introduction of intravenous fat emulsions and vitamins which were added to form &quot;total parenteral nutrition&quot;, or that which includes protein, fat, and carbohydrates.

<text>Starbucks Corporation is an American multinational chain of coffeehouses and roastery reserves headquartered in Seattle, Washington. It was founded in 1971 by Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl, and Gordon Bowker at Seattle&#x27;s Pike Place Market initially as a coffee bean wholesaler. Starbucks was converted into a coffee shop serving espresso-based drinks under the ownership of Howard Schultz, who was chief executive officer from 1986 to 2000 and led the aggressive expansion of the franchise across the West Coast of the United States.

 the company had 35,711 stores in 80 countries, 15,873 of which were located in the United States. Of Starbucks&#x27; U.S.-based stores, over 8,900 are company-operated, while the remainder are licensed. It is currently the world&#x27;s largest coffeehouse chain. The company is ranked 120th on the &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 and 303rd on the &quot;Forbes&quot; Global 2000, as of 2022.

The rise of the second wave of coffee culture is generally attributed to Starbucks, which introduced a wider variety of coffee experiences. Starbucks serves hot and cold drinks, whole-bean coffee, micro-ground instant coffee, espresso, caffe latte, full and loose-leaf teas, juices, Frappuccino beverages, pastries, and snacks. Some offerings are seasonal or specific to the locality of the store. Depending on the country, most locations provide free Wi-Fi Internet access. The company has been subject to multiple controversies related to its business practices. Conversely, its franchise has commanded substantial brand loyalty, market share, and company value.

== History ==

=== 20th century ===

==== 1970s ====
Starbucks originally opened in Seattle, Washington, on March 30, 1971. By selling high-quality coffee beans and equipments related, Starbucks became a local coffee bean retailer for the first ten years in Seattle. It was founded by business partners Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl and Gordon Bowker who first met as students at the University of San Francisco: The trio were inspired to sell high-quality coffee beans and equipment by coffee roasting entrepreneur Alfred Peet. Bowker recalls that a business partner of his, Terry Heckler, thought words beginning with the letters &quot;st&quot; were powerful, leading the founders to create a list of words beginning with &quot;st&quot;, hoping to find a brand name. They chose &quot;Starbo&quot;, a mining town in the Cascade Range and from there, the group remembered &quot;Starbuck&quot;, the name of the chief mate in the book &quot;Moby-Dick.&quot; Bowker said, &quot;&quot;Moby-Dick&quot; didn&#x27;t have anything to do with Starbucks directly; it was only coincidental that the sound seemed to make sense&quot;.&quot;&quot;

The first Starbucks store was located in Seattle at 2000 Western Avenue from 1971 to 1976.

They later moved the café to 1912 Pike Place. During this time, Starbucks stores sold just coffee beans and not drinks. In its first two years of operation, Starbucks purchased green coffee beans from Peet&#x27;s Coffee &amp; Tea.

In 1973, Alfred Peet stopped supplying Starbucks and helped train their new Roastmaster, Jim Reynolds.

==== 1980s ====
In 1984, the original owners of Starbucks, led by Jerry Baldwin, purchased Peet&#x27;s Coffee.

By 1986, the company was operating six stores in Seattle and had begun to sell espresso coffee.

In 1987, the original owners sold the Starbucks chain to their former director of marketing Howard Schultz, who rebranded his Il Giornale coffee outlets as Starbucks and began to expand the company. Also in 1987, Starbucks opened its first locations outside of Seattle, in Waterfront Station in Vancouver, British Columbia, and in Chicago, Illinois.

By 1989, there were 46 Starbucks stores located across the Pacific Northwest and Midwest, and the company was roasting more than of coffee annually.

==== 1990s ====
In June 1992, at the time of its initial public offering, Starbucks had 140 outlets, with revenue of US$73.5 million, up from US$1.3 million in 1987. The company&#x27;s market value was US$271 million by this time. The 12% portion of the company that was sold raised around US$25 million for the company, which enabled it to double its number of stores over the next two years.

By September 1992, Starbucks&#x27; share price had risen by 70%.

In 1994, Starbucks acquired The Coffee Connection, gaining the rights to use, make, market, and sell the &quot;Frappuccino&quot; beverage. The beverage was introduced under the Starbucks name in 1995.

In 1999, Starbucks experimented by opening eateries in the San Francisco Bay Area, under the Circadia restaurant brand. At the same time, Starbucks converted its Seattle Circadia restaurant into a Café Starbucks.

In 1999, Starbucks acquired Pasqua Coffee—a San Francisco-based retail coffee chain that had almost 60 locations in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York City.

=== 21st century ===

==== 2000s ====
In April 2003, Starbucks acquired Seattle&#x27;s Best Coffee and Torrefazione Italia from AFC Enterprises for US$72 million. The deal only gained 150 stores for Starbucks, but according to the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer,&quot; the wholesale business was more significant.

As of June 2003, Starbucks Japan had 466 stores and would add another 70 to 75 in the 2003 financial year. Its president, Yuji Tsunoda said it would install ovens in all stores to improve its food offerings.

From 2005 to 2007, Howard Behar was president of Starbucks North America.

In September 2006, rival Diedrich Coffee announced that it would sell most of its company-owned retail stores to Starbucks, including most locations of Oregon-based Coffee People, escalating regional coffee wars. Starbucks converted the Diedrich Coffee and Coffee People locations to Starbucks. The Coffee People locations at Portland International Airport were excluded from the sale.

In early 2008, Starbucks started a community website, My Starbucks Idea, designed to collect suggestions and feedback from customers. Other users could comment and vote on suggestions. Journalist Jack Schofield noted that &quot;My Starbucks seems to be all sweetness and light at the moment, which I don&#x27;t think is possible without quite a lot of censorship.&quot;

In March 2008, Starbucks acquired Coffee Equipment Company, which was the manufacturer of the Clover Brewing System. It began testing the &quot;fresh-pressed&quot; coffee system at several Starbucks locations in Seattle, California, New York, and Boston.

In July 2008, during the Great Recession, Starbucks announced it was closing 600 underperforming company-owned stores and cutting U.S. expansion plans amid growing economic uncertainty. On July 29, 2008, Starbucks also cut almost 1,000 non-retail jobs as part of its bid to re-energize the brand and boost its profit. Of the new cuts, 550 of the positions were layoffs and the rest were unfilled jobs.

Additionally in July 2008, Starbucks announced that it would close 61 of its 84 stores in Australia in the following month. Nick Wailes, an expert in strategic management of the University of Sydney, said that &quot;Starbucks failed to truly understand Australia&#x27;s café culture.&quot;

In January 2009, Starbucks announced the closure of an additional 300 underperforming stores and the elimination of 7,000 positions. CEO Howard Schultz also announced that he had received board approval to reduce his salary. Altogether, from February 2008 to January 2009, Starbucks terminated an estimated 18,400 U.S. jobs and began closing 977 stores worldwide.

In August 2009, Ahold announced closures and rebranding for 43 of its licensed store Starbucks kiosks for their US-based Stop &amp; Shop and Giant supermarkets.

==== 2010s ====
In 2012, Starbucks had annual Frappuccino sales of over US$2 billion.

In August 2012, the largest Starbucks in the US opened at the University of Alabama&#x27;s Ferguson Centre.

On June 25, 2013, Starbucks began to post calorie counts on menus for drinks and pastries in all of its U.S. stores.

In July 2013, more than 10% of in-store purchases were made on customers&#x27; mobile devices via the .

The company once again utilized the mobile platform when it launched the &quot;Tweet-a-Coffee&quot; promotion in October 2013. On this occasion, the promotion also involved Twitter and customers were able to purchase a US$5 gift card for a friend by entering both &quot;@tweetacoffee&quot; and the friend&#x27;s handle in a tweet. Research firm Keyhole monitored the progress of the campaign; a December 2013 media article reported that 27,000 people had participated and US$180,000 of purchases had been made to date.

In January 2014, as part of a change in compact direction, Starbucks management transitioned from a singular brand worldwide to focusing on locally relevant design for each store.

In May 2014, Starbucks announced ongoing losses in the Australian market, which resulted in all remaining stores being sold to the Withers Group.

In July 2017, Starbucks acquired the remaining 50% stake in its Chinese venture from long-term joint venture partners Uni-President Enterprises Corporation (UPEC) and President Chain Store Corporation (PCSC) for US$1.3 billion.

On March 21, 2018, Starbucks announced that it was considering the use of blockchain technology to connect coffee drinkers with coffee farmers who could eventually be able to take advantage of new financial opportunities. The pilot program was planned to start with farmers in Costa Rica, Colombia, and Rwanda in order to develop a new way to track the bean-to-cup journey. In 2019, at the Microsoft Build conference, the coffee company formally announced its &quot;bean to cup&quot; program using the Microsoft&#x27;s Azure-based blockchain service.

Two men were arrested in a Philadelphia Starbucks location after a manager claimed the two were trespassing on April 12, 2018. The arrests led to protests due to their apparently racially-motivated nature. CEO Kevin Johnson later apologized for the incident, and the company declined to press charges. During the company&#x27;s second quarter earnings call on April 26, Johnson indicated that the company had not seen a drop in sales as a result of the event and subsequent coverage. The company reiterated its guidance for full year earnings, and beat consensus expectations of 1.8 percent same-store sales growth, with 2 percent growth.

Johnson announced that the company would close some 8000 locations on May 29 for a seminar about racial bias in order to prevent future events similar to those that occurred in Philadelphia.

On June 19, 2018, Starbucks announced the closing of 150 locations in 2019; three times the number the corporation typically closes in a single year. The closings were to happen in urban areas that already have dense clusters of stores.

In July 2019, Starbucks announced that it would no longer be selling newspapers in its cafés. It was also announced that kiosks for grab-and-go snacks and bags of whole-bean coffee would be removed from stores beginning in September 2019.

In November 2019, Starbucks opened its largest store ever on Michigan Avenue, Chicago, with 200 employees.

==== 2020s ====
On March 20, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Starbucks closed all the café-only stores in the United States for two weeks. During that time, only drive-thru and delivery-only services were to function. According to the company representatives, all workers were to be paid for the next 30 days whether they went to work or stayed home. COVID-19 lockdowns caused Starbucks to suffer a general 10% sales decrease, and a 50% decrease in China where quarantine measures were especially strict.

In May 2020, the company asked for reduced rent from landlords due to the decrease in sales.

In June 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, the company announced that it would close 400 of its locations in the US/Canada region over the subsequent 18 months as it moves from the coffee house concept to what it calls &quot;convenience-led&quot; formats with drive-through and curbside pickup. Starbucks announced that it planned to open 300 stores that will primarily focus on carryout and pickup orders. The new stores will work with the Starbucks mobile app for prepayment by the customer before arrival to pick up the order. The layout of some stores will also be modified with a separate counter for picking up mobile orders.

In December 2020, Starbucks announced that it is planning to increase its store count to about 55,000 by 2030, up from roughly 33,000.

Bloomberg reported in July 2022 that the company was, through investment bank Houlihan Lokey, exploring selling its stores in the United Kingdom.

In August 2022, after months of suspension due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Starbucks sold all its stores in Russia to the Russian rapper Timati. The stores were rebranded as &quot;Stars Coffee&quot;, and are very similar to the former stores. Starbucks said it had no comment on the new owner.

On October 1, 2022, Howard Schultz stepped down as CEO, with Laxman Narasimhan becoming Starbucks&#x27;s next CEO.

On March 23, 2023, Narasimhan told employees that he would work a half-day behind a store counter each month, and he trained as a barista to immerse himself in the brand and stay close to customers.

In June 2023, Starbucks was ordered to pay $25 million in punitive damages and $600,000 compensatory damages to a former regional manager. The court found that Starbucks fired her in 2018 because she was white.

In October 2023, the operator of all of the Starbucks locations in Brazil, SouthRock Capital, declared itself bankrupt. SouthRock will continue to operate Starbucks locations normally while closing a few underperforming ones and will restructure through the bankruptcy procedure.

On August 13, 2024, Starbucks announced it was replacing then CEO Laxman Narasimhan with Brian Nicool. Nicool had served as the CEO of Chipotle since 2018.

In January 2025, Starbucks ended its &#x27;open-door policy&#x27;, and now requires customers to make a purchase in order to use restrooms and the seating area.

=====American unionization efforts=====
Three of the company&#x27;s stores in Buffalo, New York began an attempt to unionize in August 2021. Using Twitter, the workers announced they had formed an organizing committee, Starbucks Workers United, to form a union affiliated with Workers United. Two more stores joined the effort in September, however these petitions were later withdrawn to ensure a speedy process for the original three locations. During the union drive, the company sent other managers and executives, including its North America retail president, to Buffalo to engage with employees about operational issues and participate in their work. Employees were forced to attend captive audience meetings that contained anti-union messages. Starbucks temporarily closed some area stores for remodeling and added excessive staff to one of the stores preparing to vote. Workers said this reduced union support there, while Starbucks said the support was meant to compensate for increased sick leave during the pandemic as it had done elsewhere in the country. On November 9 Workers United filed three more petitions for elections to represent workers at additional Buffalo area stores. On November 10 the National Labor Relations Board mailed out votes for the elections at the original three locations. Votes for the original three stores were counted on December 9. Days before the vote count, the NLRB rejected arguments by Starbucks to halt the election.

Inspired by their colleagues in Buffalo, workers at a Starbucks store in Mesa, Arizona, petitioned the NLRB for a union election on November 18, 2021, to be represented by Workers United. The organizing at the Mesa location stemmed from, in part, a well-liked manager being terminated after whistle-blowing on Starbucks&#x27; anti-union plan.

Starbucks temporarily closed two stores participating in the union drive in October for renovations. The company claimed these closures were unrelated to the unionization efforts. Starbucks began working with Littler Mendelson, a self-described &quot;union-busting firm&quot;, in October. Starbucks requested that the National Labor Relations Board include all Buffalo Starbucks locations in the union vote, however, the NLRB rejected this argument and declared store by store elections. Finally, on December 9, 2021, the workers at the Elmwood Avenue store became the first unionized Starbucks workers at a Starbucks owned location in the United States with a 19–8 vote. The Camp Road location voted 12–8 not to be in the union. Starbucks does have unionized locations in other countries.

On December 13, workers at two Boston area locations petitioned the NLRB for union elections to be unionize with Workers United. The workers cited the win in Buffalo as inspiration for organizing. Workers in at least one location had most cards signed within a day.

In February 2022, Starbucks fired seven workers in Memphis who had led the unionization effort and temporarily closed the store.

In August 2022, the National Labor Relations Board accused the company of illegally discriminating against unionized workers by refusing them wage and benefit increases and requesting restitution. It also asked that the CEO at the time, Howard Schultz, or a board official read a notice about this supposedly unlawful move.

As of August 2022, unions were certified at 211 locations in the US.

On November 17, 2022, Starbucks’ annual Red Cup Day and one of the busiest days for employees, over 100 locations had employees go on strike. The workers were seeking higher staffing levels, better wages, and consistent schedules.

Most unionization efforts are made through SBWU (Starbucks Workers United). Currently, there are over 9,000 American locations, and since the first unionized location in New York in 2021, less than 3% have voted to unionize. SBWU and Starbucks have yet to successfully negotiate a contract. Starbucks claims in a letter and on its website that the Workers United has delayed bargaining, has illegally broadcast bargaining sessions, refused to meet in person, and that Starbucks has reported more than 22 unfair labor practice charges to the NLRB (National Labor Relations Board). By March 2023, the NLRB found no merit in Starbucks&#x27;s complaints and instead ruled that it was Starbucks who refused to bargain.

On June 23, 2023, Starbucks workers at unionized stores went on strike over the company&#x27;s stance on in-store LGBT pride decorations.

=== Economic summary ===

== Products ==
===Coffee cup sizes===
=== Low calorie and sugar-free products ===
In January 2008, Starbucks began a &quot;skinny&quot; line of drinks, offering lower-calorie and sugar-free versions of the company&#x27;s offered drinks that use skim milk, and can be sweetened by a choice of natural sweeteners (such as raw sugar, agave syrup, or honey), artificial sweeteners (such as Sweet&#x27;N Low, Splenda, Equal), or one of the company&#x27;s sugar-free syrup flavors.

=== Non-dairy milk offerings ===
In 1997, Starbucks first offered non-dairy milk at its U.S. stores with the introduction of soy milk.

In 2007, Starbucks stopped using milk originating from rBGH-treated cows. The company also adopted a new dairy standard for all espresso-based drinks, switching from whole to 2% reduced fat milk.

In 2015, Starbucks began serving coconut milk. In 2016, it began serving almond milk. In January 2020, oat milk became available nationally. The company also offers non-dairy creamers at retail in partnership with Nestle SA.

CEO Kevin Johnson said in a 2020 interview that, milk substitutes will be a big part of reducing carbon emissions. That effort has prompted vegans, environmentalists, people with lactose intolerance and others to urge the company to eliminate the upcharge for drinks made with dairy-free milk. PETA encouraged sit-ins at Starbucks locations and purchased Starbucks stock to draw attention to what they believe is an unfair charge. A Starbucks Canada spokesperson told ET Canada that customizations such as added flavours, non-dairy beverages or an additional shot of espresso, will incur an additional charge.

In December 2020, Starbucks announced it will offer Oatly oat milk in all US stores starting in spring 2021.

With the launch of their holiday menu in November 2024, Starbucks ended the upcharge for non-dairy milk additions to drinks.

=== Ethos water ===
Ethos water, a brand of bottled water acquired by Starbucks in 2003, is sold at locations throughout North America. Ethos bottles feature prominent labeling stating &quot;helping children get clean water&quot;, referring to the fact that US$0.05 from each US$1.80 bottle sold (US$0.10 per bottle in Canada) is used to fund clean water projects in underdeveloped areas. Although sales of Ethos water have raised over US$6.2 million for clean water efforts, the brand is not incorporated as a charity. Critics have argued that the claim on the label misleads consumers into thinking that Ethos is primarily a charitable organization when it is actually a for-profit brand and only 5 cents per bottle supports clean-water projects.

The founders of Ethos have stated that the brand is intended to raise awareness of third-world clean water issues and provide socially responsible consumers with an opportunity to support the cause by choosing Ethos over other brands. Starbucks has since redesigned the American version of the Ethos water bottles, stating the amount of money donated per bottle in the description.

=== Instant coffee ===
In March 2009, Starbucks introduced a line of instant coffee packets, called VIA &quot;Ready Brew&quot;. It was first unveiled in New York City with subsequent testing of the product also in Seattle, Chicago, and London. The first two VIA flavors include Italian Roast and Colombia, which were then rolled out in October 2009, across the U.S. and Canada with Starbucks stores promoting the product with a blind &quot;taste challenge&quot; of the instant versus fresh roast, in which many people could not tell the difference between the instant and freshly brewed coffee. Financial analysts speculated that by introducing instant coffee, Starbucks would devalue its own brand.

=== Coffee makers and single-use capsules ===
In September 2012, Starbucks announced plans to introduce the Verismo, a consumer-grade single-serve coffee machine that uses sealed plastic cups of coffee grounds, and a &quot;milk pod&quot; for lattes.

In November 2012, Starbucks Verismo became publicly available, consisting of a line of coffee makers that brew espresso and regular chocolate from coffee capsules, a type of pre-apportioned single-use container of ground coffee and flavourings utilizing the K-Fee pod system.

In a brief review of the 580 model, Consumer Reports described the results of a comparative test of the Verismo 580 against two competitive brands: 

=== Alcoholic drinks ===
In 2010, Starbucks began selling alcoholic beverages at some stores in the United States. In August 2014, Starbucks opened its first store in Williamsburg, Brooklyn which by then was among 30 locations serving beer and wine.

In 2016, three locations within Toronto, Ontario also announced they were going to serve alcohol, including up-scale appetizers like bacon-wrapped dates and truffle mac and cheese.

Starbucks ensures that the selected locations that serve alcohol are able to accommodate the community, as well as have the space for extra seating and storage.

=== Fruit juices, fruit beverages, and sodas ===
On November 10, 2011, Starbucks acquired juice company Evolution Fresh for US$30 million in cash and planned to start a chain of juice bars starting in around the middle of 2012, venturing into territory staked out by Jamba Inc. Its first store released in San Bernardino, California and plans for a store in San Francisco were to be launched in early 2013.

In March 2012, Starbucks began selling a line of iced Starbucks Refresher beverages that contain a green coffee extract. The beverages are fruit flavored and contain caffeine but advertised as having no coffee flavor. Starbucks&#x27;s green coffee extraction process involves soaking the beans in water.

In June 2014, Starbucks began trialing its own line of carbonated sodas, dubbed &quot;Fizzio&quot;. The drinks required a special machine to make.

=== Energy drinks ===
In January 2022, Starbucks launched a line of canned energy drinks, called &quot;Baya&quot;. The drink contains caffeine from the coffee fruit.

=== Seasonal cups ===

Each year between November–January, Starbucks releases new holiday merchandise, including new paper cups with various festive designs.

=== Barrel-aged coffee ===
In March 2017, Starbucks announced the launch of two new limited-edition specialty drinks made from beans aged in whiskey barrels at its Seattle roastery. Starbucks&#x27;s barrel-aged coffee will be sold with a small batch of unroasted Starbucks Reserve Sulawesi beans, which are then hand-scooped into whiskey barrels from Washington state.

=== Oleato coffee ===
In February 2023, Starbucks announced it would introduce a line of coffee drinks made with extra virgin olive oil, including lattes, shaken espresso, and cold brews. This would not be a limited-time offering, but rather &quot;&#x27;one of the biggest launches we’ve had in decades,&#x27;&quot; according to Brady Brewer, the company&#x27;s chief marketing officer. The goal was to create a new category of beverage. Unlike other drinks, this came about because of the habits of then-CEO Howard Schultz, who was introduced to consuming a teaspoon of olive oil each day by an olive oil producer he met in Sicily. The drinks were initially available in Italy and later expanded to stores in Southern California in spring 2023 and then the UK, Middle East, and Japan later the same year. After its launch, &quot;CNN&quot; reported some customers reported digestive distress after drinking the beverages.

In January 2024, the company said it would introduce the beverages nationwide in the US as well as in Canada, France, and China. The Oleato beverages were permanently discontinued in November 2024.

=== Starbucks card and loyalty program ===
In May 2008, a loyalty program was introduced for registered users of the Starbucks Card (previously simply a gift card) offering perks such as free Wi-Fi Internet access, no charge for soy milk and flavored syrups, and free refills on brewed drip coffee, iced coffee, or tea. Each time a customer purchases a drink, they will earn stars if they present their rewards card or scan their card from the mobile app. Eventually, these stars accumulate to allow customers to redeem for perks such as free drinks, free add-ins, free bakery items or selected merchandise.

In 2009, Starbucks began beta testing its mobile app for the Starbucks card, a stored value system in which consumers access pre-paid funds to purchase products at Starbucks. Starbucks released its complete mobile platform in January 2011. By December 2011, the number of mobile transactions exceeded 26 million.

=== Electricity and Wi-Fi ===
In August 2002, Starbucks provided free Wi-Fi in the United Kingdom, although in the past, a Starbucks rewards card was required.

On July 1, 2010, Starbucks offered free Wi-Fi in all of its stores in the U.S. and Canada. 
In August 2010, Starbucks began offering free Wi-Fi in Germany via BT Openzone.

In October 2012, Starbucks and Duracell Powermat announced a pilot program to install Powermat charging surfaces in the tabletops in selected Starbucks stores in the Boston area. Furthermore, Starbucks announced its support in the Power Matters Alliance (PMA) and its membership in the PMA board, along with Google and AT&amp;T, in an effort to create &quot;a real-world ecosystem of wireless power&quot; through a universal wireless charging standard that customers could use to recharge smartphones.

In 2013, it switched providers in the U.S. from AT&amp;T to Google.

In August 2016, startup company FluxPort introduced Qi inductive charging pads at select locations in Germany.

==Locations==

The company&#x27;s headquarters is the Starbucks Center in Seattle, Washington, United States, where 3,501 people worked as of January 2015. The main building in the Starbucks complex in SODO was previously a Sears mail order distribution center until 1987.

In addition to drinks and food, many stores carry Starbucks&#x27; official merchandise, such as mugs, tumblers, scoops, and coffee presses. There are also several select &quot;Starbucks Evenings&quot; locations that offer beer, wine, and appetizers. Starbucks-brand coffee, ice cream, and bottled cold coffee drinks are sold at grocery stores in the United States and other countries. In 2010, the company began its Starbucks Reserve program for single-origin coffees and high-end coffee shops. It planned to open 1,000 Reserve coffee shops by the end of 2017. However, since succeeding Schultz, Johnson has scaled back the Reserve coffee shops to only six to ten shops. Further development on Reserve coffee shops will be dependent on the success of the few already in existence. Currently, Starbucks operates six coffee roasteries with tasting rooms and 43 coffee bars as part of the program.

, Starbucks had 36,171 locations open across 83 countries, with 61% of the locations operating in the U.S. and China, and the rest operating elsewhere. In February 2024, the chain unveiled a new store design aimed at improving accessibility. The first location to use this design is the Washington, D.C. Union Market store. The company plans for all future company-owned stores to adopt a similar design.

However, there are plans to open a restaurant in Toowoomba while the first store in Perth, Western Australia opened on 23 October 2024, with another 11 planned to open by the end of 2025.

==== New Zealand ====
Starbucks operates several locations in New Zealand.

==== Africa ====
In May 2010, Southern Sun Hotels South Africa signed an agreement with Starbucks to brew Starbucks coffees in select Southern Sun and Tsonga Sun hotels in South Africa. The agreement was partially reached so Starbucks coffees could be served in the country in time for the 2010 FIFA World Cup hosted by South Africa.
In April 2016, after TASTE Holdings acquired outlet licensing for South African stores, Starbucks opened its first stores in South Africa in Rosebank, Gauteng, Johannesburg and the Mall of Africa.

==== At sea ====
In December 2010, Starbucks debuted their first-ever Starbucks at sea. In partnership with Royal Caribbean International, Starbucks opened a shop aboard the &quot;Allure of the Seas&quot;, Royal Caribbean&#x27;s second-largest ship and the second-largest ship in the world.

===Licensed and franchise operations===

Stores that independently operate locations include Ahold Delhaize, Barnes &amp; Noble, Target Corporation, Albertsons and, more recently, Publix stores. In the EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) markets, Starbucks operates a franchising program. Different from the licensing program in which existing corporations may apply to operate a Starbucks kiosk within an existing store, franchises can enable new, freestanding stores.

===Automation===
Starbucks has automation systems in some areas. These machines have 280 possible drink combinations to choose from. They have touchscreens, and customers can play games while they wait for their order.

Vending machines are said to possibly be able to replace baristas. Starbucks has said it does not want to replace baristas with robots, but use them as a complementary tool.

===Unbranded stores===

In 2009, at least three stores in Seattle were de-branded to remove the logo and brand name, and remodel the stores as local coffee houses &quot;inspired by Starbucks&quot;. CEO Howard Schultz called the unbranded stores a &quot;laboratory for Starbucks&quot;. The first, 15th Avenue Coffee and Tea, opened in July 2009 on Capitol Hill. It served wine and beer and hosted live music and poetry readings. It has since been remodeled and reopened as a Starbucks-branded store. Another is Roy Street Coffee and Tea at 700 Broadway E., also on Capitol Hill. Although the stores have been called &quot;stealth Starbucks&quot; and criticized as &quot;local-washing&quot;, Schultz says that &quot;It wasn&#x27;t so much that we were trying to hide the brand, but trying to do things in those stores that we did not feel were appropriate for Starbucks.&quot;

===Teavana===
Starbucks entered the tea business in 1999 when it acquired the Tazo brand for . In December 2012, Starbucks paid US$620 million to buy Teavana.
 Starbucks did not market Teavana products in its stores, though the acquisition allowed the expansion of Teavana beyond shopping malls. In January 2015, Starbucks began to roll out Teavana teas into Starbucks stores, both in to-go beverage and retail formats. Starbucks shut down Teavana in early 2018.

==Corporate governance and identity==

Howard Schultz was the CEO of Starbucks from 1986 to 2000. He was succeeded by Orin Smith, who ran the company for five years and positioned Starbucks as a large player in fair trade coffee (fair trade later being overturned during Kevin Johnson&#x27;s leadership in 2022), increasing sales to US$5 billion. Jim Donald was CEO from 2005 to 2008, orchestrating a large-scale earnings expansion. Schultz returned as CEO during the financial crisis of 2007–08 and spent the succeeding decade growing the company&#x27;s market share, expanding its offerings, and reorienting the brand around corporate social responsibility. 

Kevin Johnson, who was president and chief operating officer from 2015 to 2018, succeeded Schultz as CEO in 2017. Myron E. Ullman became chairman of the firm in June 2018. Both Johnson and Ullman succeeded Howard Schultz, who served in both capacities from 2008 to 2017. Since 2018, Schultz has served as the firm&#x27;s first Chairman &quot;emeritus&quot;.

In March 2022, Starbucks announced that Schultz would return as CEO in April 2022 in an interim role. Later that September, Laxman Narasimhan was appointed to succeed him in April 2023, with Schultz remaining a member of the board of directors. Narasimhan assumed the position sooner than planned, in March 2023. In August 2024, he was ousted and replaced with Brian Niccol, who became the chain&#x27;s CEO on September 9 after leaving his position as Chipotle&#x27;s CEO. Niccol received a starting salary of $1.6 million a year and a $10 million starting bonus.

Analysts have long believed that the firm&#x27;s corporate governance must determine how to contend with higher materials prices and enhanced competition from lower-priced fast-food chains, including McDonald&#x27;s and Dunkin&#x27; Donuts. In October 2015, Starbucks hired its first chief technology officer, Gerri Martin-Flickinger, to lead its technology team. Starbucks maintains control of production processes by communicating with farmers to secure beans, roasting its own beans, and managing distribution to all retail locations. Additionally, Starbucks&#x27;s Coffee and Farmer Equity Practices require suppliers to inform Starbucks what portion of wholesale prices paid reaches farmers. Shortly after becoming CEO, Niccol announced a new &#x27;Back to Starbucks&#x27; strategy to win back customers. The plan including simplifying the menu and reversing rules for its cafes in North America that had allowed people to use their facilities even if they had not bought anything. 

=== Ownership ===

===Board of directors===
* Brian Niccol, chair and CEO of Starbucks
* Richard Allison, former CEO of Domino&#x27;s Pizza
* Andrew Campion, COO of Nike, Inc.
* Mellody Hobson, president and co-CEO of Ariel Investments
* Beth Ford, CEO of Land O&#x27;Lakes

===Logo===
In 2006, Valerie O&#x27;Neil, a Starbucks spokeswoman, said that the logo is an image of a &quot;twin-tailed mermaid, or siren as she&#x27;s known in Greek mythology&quot;. The logo has been significantly streamlined over the years. In the first version, the Starbucks siren was topless and had a fully visible double fish tail. The image was said by Starbucks to be based on a 16th-century &quot;Norse&quot; woodcut, although other scholars note that it is apparently based on a 15th-century woodcut in Juan Eduardo Cirlot&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of Symbols&quot;. Some scholars have identified the image as Melusine. The connection to Melusine has been questioned; Melusine was not linked to heraldic images of two-tailed mermaids until the late 19th century, making it possibly a late misidentification. In the second logo, which was used from 1987 to 1992, the siren&#x27;s breasts were covered by her flowing hair, but her navel was still visible. The fish tail was cropped slightly, and the primary color was changed from brown to green, a nod to the Alma Mater of the three founders, the University of San Francisco. In the third version, used between 1992 and 2011, her navel and breasts are not visible at all, and only vestiges remain of the fish tails. The original &quot;woodcut&quot; logo has been moved to the Starbucks&#x27;s Headquarters in Seattle.

At the beginning of September 2006, and then again in early 2008, Starbucks temporarily reintroduced its original brown logo on paper hot-drink cups. Starbucks has stated that this was done to show the company&#x27;s heritage from the Pacific Northwest and to celebrate 35 years of business. The vintage logo sparked some controversy due in part to the siren&#x27;s bare breasts, but the temporary switch garnered little attention from the media. Starbucks had drawn similar criticism when it reintroduced the vintage logo in 2006. The logo was altered when Starbucks entered the Saudi Arabian market in 2000 to remove the siren, leaving only her crown, as reported in a Pulitzer Prize-winning column by Colbert I. King in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 2002. The company announced three months later that it would be using the international logo in Saudi Arabia. In January 2011, Starbucks announced that it would make small changes to the company&#x27;s logo, removing the Starbucks wordmark around the siren, enlarging the siren image, and making it green.

==Environmental and social policies==

===Environmental practices===
In 1999, Starbucks started the &quot;Grounds for your Garden&quot; program. This gives leftover coffee grounds to anyone requesting it for composting. The goal of the program was to make the company environmentally friendlier. Although not all stores and regions participate, customers can request and lobby their local store to begin the practice.

In October 2008, &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper reported that Starbucks was wasting of water a day by leaving a tap constantly running for rinsing utensils in a &#x27;dipper well&#x27; in each of its stores, but this is often required by governmental food safety codes.

In June 2009, in response to concerns over its excessive water consumption, Starbucks re-evaluated its use of the dipper well system. In September 2009, company-operated Starbucks stores in Canada and the United States successfully implemented a new water saving solution that meets government health standards. Different types of milk are given a dedicated spoon that remains in the pitcher and the dipper wells were replaced with push button metered faucets for rinsing. This will reportedly save up to of water per day in every store.

In January 2020, Starbucks shared its new environmental sustainability commitment to become a resource positive company. It announced three preliminary targets: By 2030, Starbucks will aim to reduce its carbon emissions, waste output, and water impact by 50%. It also identified five areas of focus: expanding plant-based menu options; shifting to reusable packaging; investing in regenerative agriculture, reforestation, forest conservation and water replenishment; better ways to manage waste; and more eco-friendly stores, operations, manufacturing, and delivery.

===Recycling===
Starbucks began using 10% recycled paper in its beverage cups in 2006—the company claimed that the initiative was the first time that recycled material had been used in a product that came into direct contact with a food or beverage. Allen Hershkowitz of the Natural Resources Defense Council called the 10% content &quot;minuscule&quot;, but Starbucks received the National Recycling Coalition Recycling Works Award in 2005 for the initiative. In a 2008 media article, Starbucks&#x27;s vice president of corporate social responsibility acknowledged that the company continued to struggle with environmental responsibility, as none of its cups were recyclable and stores did not have recycling bins. At the time that the article was published, Starbucks gave customers who brought in their own reusable cup a 10-cent discount, in addition to using corrugated cup sleeves made from 85% post-consumer recycled fiber, which is 34% less paper than the original. During the same period, Starbucks entered into a partnership with Conservation International—pledging US$7.5 million over three years—to help protect the natural environment of coffee-growing communities in Mexico and Indonesia.

===Plastic straw ban===
On July 9, 2018, Starbucks President and CEO Kevin Johnson announced that Starbucks will ban the single-use plastic straws by January 1, 2020, on all cold drinks from all locations worldwide due to climate change concerns, pollution, and sea turtle endangerment as the single-use plastic straws failed to be designed for recycling when they were invented. Frappucinos will get straws made from a different material that is sustainable and environmentally friendly such as paper or compostable plastic, while other cold drinks will get straw-less lids. These new modified lids contain 9% less plastic than Starbucks&#x27; previous flat lid. The Starbucks locations in Europe, China, Taiwan, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, India, Canada, Hawaii, Alaska, Washington D.C., New Mexico, California, New York, Washington State, New Jersey, Oregon, Maryland, Delaware, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island already eliminated single-use plastic straws by the end of 2018. South Korea is the first country to introduce paper straws to all stores among 78 countries in the world that Starbucks has entered.

===Reusable cups===
Starbucks has publicly committed to reducing waste by 50% by 2030. After successfully completing the campaign to provide the Reusable Cup in Vietnam in 2020, it held the same event in Korea in 2021. Along with a picture of throwing away a cleanly washed recycled PET bottle on Instagram, a hashtag designated by Starbucks was written and uploaded, and a reusable cup was provided instead of a disposable cup.

In April 2013, Starbucks introduced reusable cups where customers would be able to bring their cup into any location and receive a small discount on their drink. When the COVID-19 pandemic first began in 2019, the company halted the use of personal cups due to concerns with the transferring of germs. In June 2021, the company reintroduced personal reusable cups with a contactless new method to eliminate shared touch points between customers and baristas.

Starbucks is phasing out disposable cups in Korea entirely by 2025.

===Farmer equity practices ===
Starbucks began drafting plans for corporate social responsibility in 1994. Since Starbucks has partnered with Conservation International (CI) to draft plans and audit its coffee and farmer equity (C.A.F.E.) program, Starbucks&#x27;s C.A.F.E. practices are based on a rating system of 249 indicators. Farmers who earn high overall scores receive higher prices than those who achieve lower scores. Ratings categories include economic accountability, social responsibility, environmental leadership in coffee growing and processing. Indicators for social responsibility have evolved and now include &#x27;zero tolerance&#x27; indicators that require workers to be paid in cash, check, or direct deposit, ensure that all workers are paid the established minimum wage, that workplaces are free of harassment and abuse, that workplaces are nondiscriminatory and do not employ persons under the age of 14, and several more. Starbucks has moved 90% of its coffee purchases to preferred C.A.F.E. certified providers, and the company is approaching its stated goal to purchase 100% of its coffee through C.A.F.E. or other &#x27;ethically sourced&#x27; certification systems.

Washington State University Assistant Professor Daniel Jaffee argues that Starbucks&#x27;s C.A.F.E. practices merely &#x27;green wash&#x27; &quot;to burnish their corporate image&quot;. Additionally, Professor Marie-Christine Renard of Rural Sociology of Chapingo University in Mexico wrote a case study of Starbucks&#x27;s, Conservation International&#x27;s, and Agro-industries United of Mexico (AMSA)&#x27;s joint conservation effort in Chiapas, Mexico in which she concluded that &quot;[w]hile the CI-Starbucks-AMSA Alliance paid better prices, it did not allow the producers to appropriate the knowledge that was necessary for the organizations to improve the quality of their coffee&quot;.

===Fair trade===

In 2000, the company introduced a line of fair trade products. Of the approximately 300 million pounds (136 million kilograms) of coffee Starbucks purchased in 2006, about or 6% was certified as fair trade. Groups such as Global Exchange called for Starbucks to further increase its sales of fair trade coffees. 

After a long-running dispute between Starbucks and Ethiopia, Starbucks agreed to support and promote Ethiopian coffees. An article in BBC News, states that Ethiopian ownership of popular coffee designations such as Harrar and Sidamo is acknowledged, even if they are not registered. Ethiopia fought hard for this acknowledgement mainly to help give its poverty-stricken farmers a chance to make more money. In 2006, Starbucks said it paid for its coffee, more than 33% higher than the commodity price at the time. However, the coffee Starbucks bought for , had a selling price—after transportation, processing, marketing, store rentals, taxes, and staff salary and benefits—of . As of 2013, the Starbucks website sells only one Ethiopian coffee. In addition, Starbucks is an active member of the World Cocoa Foundation, although targets set in 2005, 2008 and 2010 to reduce child labour that the Foundation has backed have consistently not been met.

In 2019, the non-profit labour justice organisation Fair World Project released an article outling how despite Starbucks had passed coffee producers as slave free in their Brazil production units using their internal C.A.F.E. certification standards, that Brazilian labour inspectors had proof of child slave labour practices being present in their supply chain. In 2022 Starbucks announced that they were going to stop certifying their coffee beans as fairtrade, in favour of their own in-house investigations.

===Food bank donations===
Since 2010, Starbucks has been donating leftover pastries in the United States to local food banks through a food collection service named Food Donation Connection. In March 2016, Starbucks unveiled a five-year plan to donate 100 percent of unsold food from its 7,600 company-operated stores in the U.S. to local food banks and pantries. Perishable food will be transported in refrigerated trucks to area food banks through the company&#x27;s partnerships with the Food Donation Connection and Feeding America. This program, called FoodShare, is expected to provide up to 50 million meals over the next five years. , the program was in 10 different markets, including New York City. In New York, Starbucks works with Feeding America and City Harvest, both non-profits, to donate food from 45 locations. It plans to expand the program to all 305 Manhattan stores. In September 2019, 60% of Starbucks stores are participating in FoodShare. This level of participation contributed to 20 million meals served to those in need.

=== Cage-free eggs ===
In 2008, Starbucks announced a comprehensive new animal welfare policy banning many inhumane farming practices, including the caging of hens. In 2009, they established a buying preference in North America to use industry best practices for animal husbandry and processing, including egg production.

In 2015, Starbucks made a public announcement that they will switch to 100% cage-free eggs by 2020. However, later, the company altered its commitment to just company-owned locations, excluding around 40% of its licensed restaurants.

In 2018, Starbucks committed to reaching the goal of using 100% cage-free eggs and egg products in company-operated stores globally by 2020, including Starbucks branded products and those supplied to licensed partners in the North America. They stated their goal to be for all their products to meet high quality and ethical standards, with a commitment to social responsibility standards with animal welfare as a primary focus

Organizations such as World Animal Protection and Compassion in World Farming have stated that Starbucks has not shown any demonstrable improvement in animal welfare since 2012. According to the Humane Society of the United States, Starbucks no longer qualifies as having an actual cage-free commitment.

==In popular culture==

=== Hear Music ===

Hear Music began as a music catalog company in 1990, adding a few retail locations in the San Francisco Bay Area. Hear Music was purchased by Starbucks in 1999. In 2002, it produced a Starbucks opera album, featuring artists such as Luciano Pavarotti, followed in March 2007 by the hit CD &quot;Memory Almost Full&quot; by Paul McCartney, making McCartney the first artist signed to the new Hear Music label sold in Starbucks outlets. In 2006, the company created Starbucks Entertainment, one of the producers of the 2006 film &quot;Akeelah and the Bee&quot;. Starbucks stores advertised the film before its release and sold the DVD.

Starbucks has become the subject of a protest song, &quot;A Rock Star Bucks a Coffee Shop&quot; by Neil Young and his band, Promise of the Real. This single from the album &quot;The Monsanto Years&quot; criticized both Starbucks&#x27;s alleged use of genetically modified food and the GMO company Monsanto.

=== Upstanders ===
In September 2016, Starbucks announced a debut of its first-ever original content series called &quot;Upstanders&quot;, which aimed to be inspirational. The series featured podcasts, written word, and video, and was distributed via the Starbucks mobile app, online, and through the company&#x27;s in-store digital network.

===Films===
In the 2021 film &quot;&quot;, it is stated by Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) that Starbucks had taken over the Ghostbusters&#x27; firehouse headquarters at North Moore Street after they went out of business and had turned it into a coffeehouse before Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson) bought it back from them.

== Partnerships ==

=== Aeroplan ===

In Canada, Starbucks has partnered with Aeroplan to award Aeroplan points to customers who link their Aeroplan and Starbucks accounts. Aeroplan members receive points for loading money into their Starbucks account.

=== Apple Inc. ===
Starbucks has partnered with Apple Inc. to collaborate on selling music as part of the &quot;coffeehouse experience&quot;. In October 2006, Apple added a Starbucks Entertainment area to the iTunes Store, selling music similar to that played in Starbucks stores. In September 2007, Apple announced that customers would be able to browse the iTunes Store at Starbucks via Wi-Fi in the US—with no requirement to log into the Wi-Fi network—targeted at iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad, and MacBook users. The iTunes Store automatically detects recent songs playing in a Starbucks and offer users the opportunity to download the tracks. Some stores feature LCD screens with the artist name, song, and album information of the current song playing. This feature was rolled out in Seattle, New York City, and the San Francisco Bay Area, and was offered in limited markets during 2007–2008. During the fall of 2007, Starbucks also began to sell digital downloads of certain albums through iTunes. Starbucks gave away 37 different songs for free download through iTunes as part of the &quot;Song of the Day&quot; promotion in 2007, and a free &quot;Pick of the Week&quot; download is available from the App Store.

=== MSNBC ===
Starting on June 1, 2009, the MSNBC morning news program &quot;Morning Joe&quot; has been presented as &quot;brewed by Starbucks&quot; and the show&#x27;s logo changed to include the company logo. Although the hosts have previously consumed Starbucks coffee on air &quot;for free&quot; in the words of MSNBC president Phil Griffin, it was not paid placement at that time. The move was met with mixed reactions from rival news organizations, viewed as both a clever partnership in an economic downturn and a compromise of journalistic standards. The endorsement deal ended in August 2013.

=== Kraft Foods ===
Starbucks and Kraft Foods entered into a partnership in 1998 to sell Starbucks products in the Mondelez grocery stores owned by the latter. Starbucks claimed that Kraft did not sufficiently promote its products and offered Kraft US$750 million to terminate the agreement; however, Kraft declined the offer, but Starbucks proceeded with the termination anyway. Starbucks wanted to terminate the agreement because at the time, single coffee packs were beginning to become popular. In their agreement, Starbucks was confined to selling packs that only worked in Kraft&#x27;s Tassimo machines. Starbucks did not want to fall behind in the market opportunities for K-Cups. In mid-November 2013, an arbitrator ordered Starbucks to pay a fine of US$2.8 billion to Mondelez International, a corporate spin-off of Kraft, for its premature unilateral termination of the agreement.

=== Arizona State University ===
In June 2014, Starbucks announced a partnership with Arizona State University (ASU) that would allow Starbucks employees in their Junior and Senior years of college to complete four years of college at Arizona State University&#x27;s online program for only around US$23,000. Starbucks employees admitted into the program will receive a scholarship from the college, that will cover 44% of their tuition. The remaining balance and all other expenses would be paid by the student or through traditional financial aid. In April 2015, Starbucks and ASU announced an expansion of the College Achievement Program. The program would now allow all eligible part-time and full-time employees working in a U.S. Starbucks to enroll in the program for full-tuition reimbursement. After the completion of each semester, Starbucks reimburses the student their portion of the tuition. The student can then use the reimbursement to pay any loans or debt incurred during the semester.

=== PepsiCo ===
In 2015, Starbucks signed a deal with PepsiCo to market and distribute Starbucks products in several Latin American countries.

=== Spotify ===
In May 2015, Starbucks entered a partnership with music streaming service Spotify. The partnership entailed giving U.S.-based employees a Spotify premium subscription and to help influence the music played in store via playlists made using Spotify. Starbucks was also given its own curated Spotify playlist to be featured on Spotify&#x27;s mobile app.

=== Disney ===
On June 19, 2015, a Starbucks opened at Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom on Discovery Island. Since the park does not allow plastic straws due to the animals, this location features special green eco-friendly straws with their cold drinks. This was the sixth Starbucks to open in Walt Disney World, following locations in the Magic Kingdom (Main Street, U.S.A.), Epcot (Future World), Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios (Hollywood Boulevard), and two in Disney Springs (Marketplace and West Side). In addition to these six, there are locations in Disneyland (Main Street, U.S.A.), Disney California Adventure (Buena Vista Street), Anaheim&#x27;s Downtown Disney, and Disney Village at Disneyland Paris. The Downtown Disney and Disney Springs locations are Starbucks-operated, while the locations inside of the theme parks are Disney-operated.

=== Uber Eats ===
In December 2018, Starbucks expanded its partnership with Uber Eats to bring its beverages to U.S. customers&#x27; doorsteps, as it had already done for some time in China.

=== Lyra Health Inc. ===
In March 2020, Starbucks announced that starting from April 6, all U.S. employees and their eligible family members could use up to 20 free mental health therapy or coaching sessions per year. They can meet with a counselor face-to-face or video call and will also have unlimited access to self-care apps through Lyra Health Inc.

PayPal/Bakkt

Through partnerships with financial technology company PayPal and digital asset manager Bakkt, Starbucks customers can reload their Starbucks cards with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether.

===Arla Foods===
Starbucks have a range of ready-to-drink iced coffee products in shops and supermarkets, which are produced under license by Danish-Swedish dairy cooperative Arla Foods.

==Reviews and reception==
Kevin Knox, who was in charge of doughnuts food quality at Starbucks from 1987 to 1993, recalled on his blog in 2010 how George Howell, coffee veteran and founder of the Cup of Excellence, had been appalled at the dark roasted beans that Starbucks was selling in 1990. Talking to &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2008, Howell stated his opinion that the dark roast used by Starbucks does not deepen the flavor of coffee, but instead can destroy purported nuances of flavor.

The March 2007 issue of &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; compared American fast-food chain coffees and ranked Starbucks behind McDonald&#x27;s Premium Roast in the middle of a coffee war. The magazine called Starbucks coffee &quot;strong, but burnt and bitter enough to make your eyes water instead of open&quot;.

As reported by &quot;Time&quot; in 2010, third wave coffee proponents generally criticize Starbucks for over-roasting beans. As a result, Starbucks retrained its baristas and changed its roasting methods in 2010 in order to &quot;standardize quality over quantity&quot;. &quot;The Atlantic&quot; reported that this push for higher-quality coffee slowed down orders, but stated &quot;[they] move their product pretty quickly, and with surprising accuracy&quot;. &quot;Forbes&quot; corroborated this trade off between efficiency and quality at Starbucks.

In 2018, &quot;Business Insider&quot; conducted a test of Starbucks coffee judged by 100 coffee experts. It concluded that although staples of the menu were &quot;too sugary&quot;, coffee quality materially improved with particularly strong showings in the firm&#x27;s iced coffee and nitro cold brew coffee offerings. &quot;Insider&quot; experts, however, did note that the coffee quality in Starbucks Reserves far surpassed that of the typical retail store.

== Criticisms and controversies ==
=== Response to Russian invasion of Ukraine ===
Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, a number of companies have faced growing pressure to halt operations in Russia, but have not yet done so. This includes Starbucks. On March 4, Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson stated that the company has no business operations in Ukraine, but does have 130 licensed Starbucks locations in Russia that are wholly owned by a &quot;licensed partner&quot;. While Johnson did not comment on their future, he condemned the Russian invasion and did say that the company &quot;will donate any royalties we receive from our business operations in Russia to humanitarian relief efforts for Ukraine&quot;.

=== Racial controversies ===
Starbucks has been accused of racial bias and discrimination on several occasions. In 1994, Starbucks settled a lawsuit after two employees were dismissed because of their race, age, and sex. A black woman filed a suit after her direct supervisor, a regional vice president, said he would like to call her Toby, a slave name which was given to African Kunta Kinte in the TV miniseries &quot;Roots&quot;. Her co-worker spoke on her behalf, after which she was fired. In 2008, a former African American Starbucks engineer sued the company for discrimination after his supervisor failed to address racist bullying he was experiencing at the workplace, instead giving him extra work due to his complaining. Starbucks settled the suit in 2009. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has raised allegations against Starbucks for racial bias in its promotions, allegedly based on workforce data from 2007 to 2011 that showed that minority retail partners in the United States received fewer promotions than statistically expected.

The 2015 Starbucks &quot;Race Together&quot; campaign, when baristas were instructed to write the phrase &quot;Race Together&quot; on customer&#x27;s cups with the aim to start a national dialogue about race, was heavily criticized and received backlash. In 2020, employees were prohibited from wearing Black Lives Matter symbols or phrases on their clothing or accessories.

Individual Starbucks cafes have faced criticism over incidents of racial bias, leading the company to close 8,000 cafes for a day in 2018 for racial bias training. In 2014, a Milwaukee Starbucks employee called the police when they noticed a black man sleeping in a park, which resulted in the police officer killing the man by shooting him 14 times, prompting protests. In 2018, two black men were arrested and escorted out of a Philadelphia Starbucks after the staff called the police because they refused to leave. The video of the incident quickly became viral and sparked widespread outrage. In another 2018 incident, a black man was denied the code for the restroom for not being a customer, even though at the same time a white man was given that code before ordering anything. In 2021, a Starbucks in Ireland was fined €12,000 after an Irish Thai customer received her order with a racist drawing on the cup.

===Union busting===
In 2022, over a period of a few months, Starbucks terminated more than 85 workers in the U.S. who had been involved in organizing worker unions against unfair labor practices. The workers had also accused Starbucks of creating a culture of fear and surveillance in the store.

In November 2022, the chain announced it would close a location in Seattle that was the first to unionize. It said the closure was due to safety concerns.

On December 18, 2022, workers at over 100 stores across the U.S. undertook a three-day strike in response to alleged union busting and to demand better working conditions.

=== Pride/LGBTQ+ ===

In June 2023, Starbucks attracted controversy for allegedly not allowing workers at some locations in 22 states to put up Pride Month decorations. It came during an ongoing public furor over the direction of LGBTQ+ rights in the US, with other major corporations, like Target and AB-InBev, which manufactures Bud Light, also receiving heightened criticism and scrutiny. A strike at some stores was announced as a result.

=== Boycott amidst the 2023 Israel-Hamas war ===
In late 2023, Starbucks faced boycotts following the company&#x27;s decision to sue the Starbucks Workers United (SWU) union for making a social media post stating &quot;Solidarity with Palestine&quot; shortly after the 7 October 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel. Starbucks alleged that the post harmed its reputation, and sued for trademark infringement for the use of the Starbucks name and a related logo. The SWU made a filing in response, requesting the continued use of the name and logo, and alleging defamation from Starbucks that it endorsed violence or terrorism. According to SWU President Lynne Fox the post was written by a single person, shortly deleted, and not authorized by other members of the SWU. CEO Laxman Narasimhan wrote a year-ending letter addressed to employees, writing: &quot;Our stance is clear. We stand for humanity.&quot;

<text>The Independent Television Authority (ITA) was an agency created by the Television Act 1954 (2 &amp; 3 Eliz. 2. c. 55) to supervise the creation of &quot;Independent Television&quot; (ITV), the first commercial television network in the United Kingdom. The ITA existed from 1954 until 1972. It was responsible for determining the location, constructing, building, and operating the transmission stations used by the ITV network, as well as determining the franchise areas and awarding the franchises for each regional commercial broadcaster. The authority began its operations on 4 August 1954, a mere four days after the Television Act 1954 received royal assent, under the chairmanship of Sir Kenneth Clark. The authority&#x27;s first director general, Sir Robert Fraser was appointed by Clark a month later on 14 September.

The physics of VHF broadcasting meant that a comparatively small number of transmitters could cover the majority of the population of Britain, if not the bulk of the area of the country. The ITA determined that the first three franchise areas would cover the London area, the English Midlands, and Northern England (the Lancashire/Yorkshire belt of industrial cities from Liverpool to Hull and the surrounding countryside). All three franchise areas would be awarded on a divided weekday/weekend basis, and it was planned that the franchise holders for these areas would produce the great bulk of network programmes, while the companies given the smaller franchises would produce mainly local programmes for their area only.

==Franchises==
The ITA awarded franchises to applicant companies, selecting between applicants on the basis of the financial soundness and structure of the company, the proposals for the service to be offered, and often on connections between the applicant company and the area to be served.

Franchises were awarded initially between 1954 and 1961, with the new television stations usually beginning their broadcasting one-to-two years later. During September 1963 the ITA invited new applications for franchises to operate from July 1964 for three years or until the arrival of a second commercial channel, whichever came first, but in fact no changes were made to any franchise holders at that time, except for confirming the merger of the &quot;South Wales and the West&quot; franchise held by TWW and the &quot;Wales West and North&quot; franchise held by WWN following the financial collapse of WWN. (In the event, a second commercial channel did not begin until 1982, under the guise of Channel 4.)

===Initial franchises awarded in 1954===
* The London (Monday to Friday) franchise was awarded to Associated-Rediffusion. 
* The London (Saturday and Sunday) and Midlands (Monday to Friday) franchises were awarded to the Associated Broadcasting Company, later renamed Associated TeleVision (ATV). 
* The Midlands (Saturday and Sunday) and North of England (Saturday and Sunday) franchises were awarded to Kemsley-Winnick Television (which subsequently collapsed; the franchise was reallocated in 1955 to the Associated British Picture Corporation as ABC Weekend Television). 
* The North of England (Monday to Friday) franchise was awarded to Granada Television.

In January 1955 the ITA authorised the creation of ITN (Independent Television News), a company owned and operated by the ITV companies collectively, to provide a news service for the new network.

On 22 September 1955 the ITV service opened in the London area, where the ITA transmitter could reach a population of nearly 12 million. The first commercial on British television was for &quot;Gibbs SR&quot; toothpaste.

===Franchises awarded in 1956===
* The Central Scotland franchise was awarded to Scottish Television (STV), from three applications.
* The South Wales and West of England franchise (on both sides of the Severn Estuary) was awarded to Television Wales and the West, TWW, from ten applications.

===Franchises awarded in 1957===
* The South of England franchise was awarded to Southern Television, from thirteen applications.
* The North East England franchise was awarded to Tyne Tees Television, from eleven applications.

===Franchises awarded in 1958===
* The East of England franchise was awarded to Anglia Television, from eight applications.
* The Northern Ireland franchise was awarded to Ulster Television (UTV), from four applications.

===Franchise awarded in 1959===
* The South West England franchise was awarded to Westward Television, from fifteen applications.

===Franchises awarded in 1960===
* The franchise for the Channel Islands was awarded to Channel Television, from two applications, following the extension of the Television Act 1954 to the Islands by the Television Act 1954 (Channel Islands) Order 1961 (SI 1961/2039), as it normally would not apply there.
* The franchise for the English-Scottish Border and the Isle of Man was awarded to Border Television, from two applications, following the Television Act 1954 (Isle of Man) Order 1957 (SI 1957/602)
* The franchise for North East Scotland was awarded to Grampian Television, from seven applications.

===Franchise awarded in 1961===
* The franchise for West and North Wales was awarded to the Wales Television Association, Teledu Cymru, transmitting as WWN, Wales (West and North) Television.

When WWN went on the air on 14 September 1962, the ITV network was completed. However, due to the late commissioning of two of WWN&#x27;s three transmitters, the company never received more than half the projected income and the company failed in January 1964; the two Welsh franchises were consequently merged, with TWW broadcasting to the whole of Wales.

===Franchise review 1967===
The 1967 franchise review involved substantial changes: 
* All weekday/weekend split franchises were ended except in London.
* The &quot;North of England&quot; franchise was split between &quot;North West England&quot;, awarded to Granada Television, and the &quot;three Ridings of Yorkshire&quot; to create Yorkshire Television.
* The new seven-day franchise in the Midlands was awarded to (ATV).
* The ITA asked ABC and Associated-Rediffusion to merge, forming Thames Television which was awarded the London Weekday franchise.
* LWT was awarded the London Weekend franchise (from 7 pm on Fridays).
* Most controversially, TWW lost its franchise for Wales and the West of England to &quot;Harlech Television&quot;, which soon became known as HTV.

The 1967 franchises were subsequently extended in stages to expire in 1976, then 1979, and finally to expire on 31 December 1981. See the entry for the IBA for details of the 1981 and 1991–2 franchise rounds.

==Changes from 1972==
The Sound Broadcasting Act 1972 gave the ITA responsibility for organising commercial radio in the UK, and reconstituted the ITA as the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) with effect from Wednesday 12 July 1972. The IBA was subsequently replaced by the Independent Television Commission (ITC) and the Radio Authority under the provisions of the Broadcasting Act 1990, which themselves were replaced by the Office of Communications (Ofcom) at the end of 2003.

<text>The Acorn Atom is a home computer made by Acorn Computers Ltd from 1980 to 1982, when it was replaced by the BBC Micro. The BBC Micro began life as an upgrade to the Atom, originally known as the Proton.

The Atom was a progression of the MOS Technology 6502-based machines that the company had been making from 1979. The Atom was a cut-down Acorn System 3 without a disk drive but with an integral keyboard and cassette tape interface, sold in either kit or complete form. In 1980 it was priced between £120 in kit form, £170 () ready assembled, to over £200 for the fully expanded version with 12 KB of RAM and the floating-point extension ROM.

== Hardware ==

The minimum Atom had 2 KB of RAM and 8 KB of ROM, with the maximum specification machine having 12 KB of each. An additional floating-point ROM was also available. The 2 KB of RAM was divided between 1 KB of Block Zero RAM (including the 256 bytes of &quot;zero page&quot;) and 512 bytes for the screen (text mode) and only 512 bytes for programs (presumably in text mode, mode 0, and graphics not available), i.e. written in the BASIC language. When expanded up to a total of 12 KB RAM, the split is 1 KB, 5 KB for programs, and up to 6 KB for the high-resolution graphics (the screen memory could be expanded independently from the lower part of the address space). If the high-resolution graphics were not required then up to 5½ KB of the upper memory could additionally be used for program storage. The first 1 KB, i.e. Block Zero, was used by the CPU for stack storage, by the OS, and by the Atom BASIC for storage of the 27 variables.

It had an MC6847 Video Display Generator (VDG) video chip, allowing for both text and graphics modes. It could be connected to a TV or modified to output to a video monitor. Basic video memory was 1 KB but could be expanded to 6 KB. Since the MC6847 could only output at 60 Hz, meaning that the video could not be resolved on a large proportion of European TV sets, a 50 Hz PAL colour card was later made available. Six video modes were available, with resolutions from 64×64 in 4 colours, up to 256×192 in monochrome. At the time, 256×192 was considered to be high resolution.

The case was designed by industrial designer Allen Boothroyd of Cambridge Product Design Ltd.

== Software ==

It had a built-in minor variation of Acorn System BASIC, a fast but idiosyncratic version of the BASIC programming language developed by Sophie Wilson, which included indirection operators (similar to PEEK and POKE) for bytes and words (of 4 bytes each); the use of a semi-colon to separate statements on the same line of code (instead of the colon used by most if not all other versions of BASIC); and the option of labels rather than line numbers for GOTO and GOSUB commands. Assembly code could be included within a BASIC program, because the BASIC interpreter also contained an assembler for the 6502 assembly language which assembled the inline code during program execution and then executed it. This was unusual.

String handling was based on arrays of characters. A byte vector to could be ensioned and then referred to with the string operator to be treated as a string. This sample program, adapted from &quot;Atomic Theory and Practice&quot;, demonstrates some of Atom BASIC&#x27;s peculiarities:
 1 REM Encoder/Decoder
 10 S=TOP; ?12=0
 20 INPUT&#x27;&quot;CODE NUMBER&quot;T; REM Use code number to seed random number generator
 30 !8=ABS(T)
 40 INPUT&#x27;$S
 50 FOR P=S TO S+LEN(S); REM For each character, if it is a letter add the next random number to it, modulo 26.
 60 IF ?P&lt;#41 GOTO 100
 70 R=ABS(RND)%26
 80 IF T&lt;0 THEN R=26-R
 90 ?P=(?P-#41+R)%26+#41
 100 NEXT P
 110 PRINT $S
 120 GOTO 40
In late 1982, Acorn released an upgrade board for the Atom which allowed users to switch between Atom BASIC and the more advanced &quot;BBC BASIC&quot; used by the BBC Micro. The upgrade was purely to the programming language; the Atom&#x27;s hardware capabilities remained unchanged, and hence, contrary to some pre-release beliefs, the BBC BASIC ROM did not allow Atom users to run commercial BBC Micro software, since nearly all of it took advantage of the BBC machine&#x27;s much more advanced graphics and sound hardware and greater RAM capacity. Commercial BBC Micro cassettes could not have been loaded anyway, as they ran at a transfer rate of 1200 baud and the Atom&#x27;s cassette interface only supported 300 baud.

The following is the memory map for the Atom. Shaded areas indicate those present on the minimal system.
The manual for the Atom was called Atomic Theory and Practice and was written by David Johnson-Davies, subsequently Managing Director of Acornsoft.

The Acorn LAN, Econet, was first configured on the Atom.

== Specifications ==

* CPU: MOS Technology 6502
* Speed: 1 MHz
* RAM: 2 KB, expandable to 12 KB
* ROM: 8 KB, expandable to 12 KB with various Acorn and 3rd party ROMs
* Sound: 1 channel, integral loudspeaker
* Size: 381×241×64 mm
* I/O Ports: Computer Users&#x27; Tape Standard (CUTS) interface, TV connector, Centronics parallel printer
* Storage: Kansas City standard audio cassette interface
* Power: standard 2.1 mm power jack connector for 8 volts unregulated DC, providing 5 volts regulated inside the Atom

The Acorn 8V power supply was only rated to 1.5 amps, which was not enough for an Atom with fully populated RAM sockets. The Atom&#x27;s two internal LM7805 regulators (each regulating the +5V for a section of the digital logic independently) also got uncomfortably hot. Therefore, some Atom enthusiasts removed and bypassed the internal regulators and powered their Atoms from an external 5V regulated power supply. Three amps were typically needed for a fully populated Atom.

There has never been a &quot;de facto&quot; standard for external 5V connections, but using the same 7-pin DIN connectors as the Atari 800XL allowed an Atari 5V linear power supply to drive an Atom, so long as the current was less than the Atari PSU rating (1 or 1.5 amps, depending on the model). These are now uncommon, but 5V wall-wart switch-mode power supplies capable of supplying several amps are a readily and cheaply available alternative.

== Variants and applications ==

The Atom was incorporated into a &quot;complete dedicated spreadsheet system&quot; known as the Prophet by a company called Busicomputers, with the second edition of this product, the Prophet 2, consisting of a modified Atom, Ferguson 12-inch black-and-white television, and a Pearlcorder microcassette recorder, all housed in a &quot;robust metal case&quot;. Powered by a single mains plug, the system was effectively a &quot;turnkey&quot; solution, emphasising the built-in spreadsheet as its primary function. Although regarded as worth considering as an &quot;inexpensive way of obtaining a sound and reasonably well-presented spreadsheet system&quot;, being priced at £795 plus VAT, the use of cassette storage to reduce the system&#x27;s cost was regarded as impacting its usability, with the slow data transfer rate causing waits of 30 minutes or more to save spreadsheet data and limiting the effective storage capacity of the microcassettes, whereas more expensive disk-based systems would be able to transfer similar volumes of data in a matter of seconds and store tens of spreadsheets on each disk. Regarded as &quot;low-tech&quot; later in 1983, the Prophet II was apparently being given away to participants of one- or two-day business-related training courses, these costing £600 and £700 respectively, with this initiative considered &quot;a nice way of moving old stock&quot;. A subsequent model, the Prophet 3, featured a built-in floppy disk drive.

<text>This is a page on the history of the island of [[Martinique]].

==100–1450==
The island was originally inhabited by Arawak and Carib peoples. Circa 130 AD, the first Arawaks are believed to have arrived from South America. In 295 A.D, an eruption of Mount Pelée resulted in the decimation of the island&#x27;s population. Around 400 A.D, the Arawaks returned and repopulated the island. Around 600 A.D, the Caribs arrived. They exterminated the Arawaks and proceeded to settle on the island over the next few centuries.

==1450–1600==
Christopher Columbus charted the island in 1493, making the region known to European interests, but it was not until June 15, 1502, on his fourth voyage, that he actually landed, leaving several pigs and goats on the island. However, the Spaniards ignored the island as other parts of the New World were of greater interest to them. 

==17th century==

In 1635, after 133 years of Spanish rule, Spain was forced to cede Martinica to the French under Cardinal Richelieu who created the Compagnie des Îles de l&#x27;Amérique (Company of the Isles of America, the successor to the Compagnie de Saint-Christophe). The company contracted with Messrs l&#x27;Olive and Duplessis to occupy and govern on its behalf the Caribbean islands belonging to the French crown. This led on September 1, 1635, to Pierre Bélain d&#x27;Esnambuc landing on Martinique with eighty to one hundred French settlers from Saint Cristophe. They met some resistance that they were able to dispatch quickly because of their far superior weaponry and armor. They settled in the northwestern region that later became known as St. Pierre at the mouth of the Roxelane River, where they built Fort Saint Pierre. The first governor was Jean Dupont.

The following year, d&#x27;Esnambuc fell ill and passed the command of the settlement to his nephew, Jacques Dyel du Parquet. At this time the colony&#x27;s population numbered some 700 men. The settlers cleared the land around St. Pierre to grow crops. They grew manioc and potatoes to live on and rocou, indigo, tobacco, and later cacao and cotton, for export. French and foreign merchants frequently came to the island to buy these exotic products, transforming Martinique into a modestly prosperous colony. The colonists also established another fort, Fort Saint Louis in 1638. This fort, like Fort Saint Pierre, was little more than a wooden stockade. In 1640, the fort was improved to include a ditch, high stone walls and 26 cannons.

Over the next quarter of a century the French established full control of the island. They systematically killed the fiercely resisting Caribs as they expanded, forcing the survivors back to the Caravelle Peninsula in the Cabesterre (the eastern side of the island).

Although labor-intensive, sugar was a lucrative product to trade, and cultivation on Martinique soon focused only on growing and trading sugar. In 1685, King Louis XIV proclaimed &quot;Le Code Noir&quot;, which aimed to provide a legal framework for the removal of Africans from their homeland and their transport to work as slaves on the French sugar plantations. Ever since, a strong theme of Martinican culture has been creolization or interaction between the French colonial settlers, known locally as &quot;békés&quot;, and the Africans they imported. For over two hundred years, slavery, and slave revolts, would be a major influence on the economy and politics of the island.

The French colonial settlers were peasants attracted by propaganda promising fortune and a life under the sun. The &quot;volunteers&quot; were indentured servants who had to work for their master for three years, after which they were promised their own land. However, the tiring work and hot climate resulted in few of the workers surviving their three years, with the result that constant immigration was necessary for maintaining the workforce. Still, under the directorship of du Parquet, Martinique&#x27;s economy developed as it exported products to France and the neighboring English and Dutch colonies. In 1645, the Sovereign council was established with several powers, among them the right to grant titles of nobility to families in the islands. In 1648, the Company of the Isles of America started to wind up its affairs and in 1650 du Parquet bought the island.

In 1650 Father Jacques du Tetre built a still for converting the waste from the sugarcane mills into molasses, which became a major export industry.

In 1654, du Parquet allowed 250 Dutch Jews, who were fleeing Brazil following the Portuguese taking back their territory in that colony, to settle Martinique, where they engaged in the sugar trade. This was by far the most sought after product in Europe and the crop soon became Martinique&#x27;s biggest export.

After the death of du Parquet, his widow ruled on behalf of his children until 1658, when Louis XIV resumed sovereignty over the island, paying an indemnity of £120,000 to the du Parquet children. At this time, Martinique&#x27;s population numbered some 5,000 settlers and a few surviving Carib Indians. The Caribs were eventually exterminated or exiled in 1660.

In 1658, Dominican Fathers built an estate at Fonds Saint-Jacques. From 1693 to 1705, this was the home of Père Labat, the French Dominican priest who improved the distillery. A colorful character, he was also an explorer, architect, engineer, and historian, and fought as a soldier against the English.

In 1664, Louis transferred the island, this time to the newly established Compagnie des Indes Occidentales. The next year, during the Second Anglo-Dutch War, a Dutch fleet under Admiral Michiel de Ruyter retired to Martinique to refit after the fleet&#x27;s indecisive encounter with an English force off Barbados. Two years later a hurricane devastated Martinique and Guadelope, killing some 2,000 people. This was the first of several natural disasters that would devastate the population of Martinique over the next few centuries.

The French buccaneer François l&#x27;Ollonais (&quot;Jean-David Nau&quot;) spent part of his early life as a servant on Martinique before joining the buccaneers based in Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti). Martinique is a home port to for French buccaneers as well as pirates like Captain Crapeau, Étienne de Montauban and Mathurin Desmarestz which earned a notorious reputation for their violent tactics against Spanish captives, often referred to as &quot;Fléau des Espagnols&quot; (&quot;Flail of the Spanish&quot;). It allowed the French to operate in the Caribbean against Spanish ships in both Hispaniola and Martinique. 

In 1666 and 1667 the English unsuccessfully attacked. The Treaty of Breda (1667) ended the Second Anglo-Dutch War and hence the hostilities.

In 1672, Louis XIV ordered the construction of a citadel, Fort Saint Louis, at Fort Royal Bay to defend Martinique. The next year, the Compagnie des Indes Occidentales decided to establish a town at Fort Royal, even though the location was a malarial swamp. The Compagnie des Indes Occidentales failed in 1674, and the colony reverted to the direct administration of the French crown. Martinique&#x27;s administration was in the hands of council. The King appointed two members: the Lieutenant-general and the administrator. They chose the other council members (the governor, the Attorney General and the ordinary judge). This organization lasted until 1685.

During the Third Anglo-Dutch War, de Ruyter returned to Martinique in 1674, this time with the intent to capture Fort Royal. Calm winds and French booms prevented him from sailing his fleet of 30 warships, nine supply ships, and 15 transports into the harbor. The French repulsed his attempt to land his 3,400 troops, causing him to lose 143 men, at a cost of 15 French lives.

In 1675 the first Governor General of the West Indies, Jean-Charles de Baas-Castelmore, arrived in Martinique and served until 1677. His successor was Charles de La Roche-Courbon, comte de Blénac, who served for the first time from 1677 to 1683. He drew up a plan for the city of Fort Royal and improving the fortifications of Fort Saint Louis. de Blénac was responsible for the 10-year effort that resulted in the building of a 487-meter wall around the peninsula on which the Fort stood, the wall being four meters high and two meters thick, and cutting a ditch that separated from the town. de Blénac served as Governor General again from June 1684 to February 1691, and again from 24 Nov 1691 until his death in 1696.

The growth of the town resulted in the progressive clearing and draining of the mangrove swamp. By 1681, Fort-Royal was the administrative, military and political capital of Martinique. Still, Saint Pierre, with its better harbor, remained the commercial capital.

In 1685, in France King Louis XIV promulgated the &quot;Code Noir&quot; (literally, &quot;Black Code&quot;), a collection of law texts whose 60 articles would regulate slavery in the colonies, and which was partially inspired by Jean-Baptiste Colbert. The code forbade some cruel acts, but institutionalized others and slavery itself, relegating the status of slaves to that of chattel. It also ordered the expulsion of the Jews from all the French islands. These Jews then moved to the Dutch island of Curaçao, where they prospered.

In 1692, Charles de La Roche-Courbon, Count of Blénac, the Governor and Lieutenant General of the French colonies in America, named Fort Royal as the capital city of Martinique. In 1693 the English again unsuccessfully attacked Martinique.

==1700–1788==

In 1720, a French naval officer, Gabriel de Clieu, procured a coffee plant seedling from the Royal Botanical Gardens in Paris and transported it to Martinique. He transplanted it on the slopes of Mount Pelée and was able to harvest his first crop in 1726, or shortly thereafter. By 1736, the number of slaves in Martinique had risen to 60,000 people. In 1750, Saint Pierre had about 15,000 inhabitants, and Fort Royal only about 4,000.

During the Seven Years&#x27; War the British 76th Regiment of Foot under William Rufane captured Martinique in early 1762.
Following Britain&#x27;s victory in the war there was a strong possibility the island would be annexed by them. However, the sugar trade made the island so valuable to the royal French government that at the Treaty of Paris (1763), which ended the Seven Years&#x27; War, they declined to regain Canada in order to regain Martinique and the neighboring island of Guadeloupe. During the British occupation, Marie Josèph Rose Tascher de la Pagerie, the future Empress Joséphine was born to a noble family living on Les Trois-Îlets across the bay from Fort Royal. Also, 1762 saw a yellow fever epidemic and in 1763 the French established separate governments for Martinique and Guadeloupe.

August 2, 1766 saw the birth of Saint-Pierre de Louis Delgrès, a mixed-race free black who would serve in the French army and fight the British in 1794, before becoming the leader of the unsuccessful resistance in Guadeloupe against General Richepance, whom Napoleon had sent to restore slavery to that colony. On August 13 (in either 1766 or 1767) a hurricane – apparently accompanied by an earthquake – struck the island; 600–1600 were killed. Monsieur de la Pagerie, the father of the future Empress, was almost ruined. At the time, there were some 450 sugar mills in Martinique, and molasses was a major export. Four years later an earthquake shook the island. By 1774, when a decree ended indentured servitude for whites, there were some 18 to 19 million coffee trees on the island.

In 1779, the future Joséphine de Beauharnais, first Empress of the French, sailed for France to meet her husband for the first time. In the following year the Great Hurricane of 1780, one of the most damaging hurricanes in Western history, struck the island, killing 9000. Over 100 French and Dutch merchantmen were lost. In 1782, Admiral de Grasse sailed from Martinique to rendezvous with Spanish forces in order to attack Jamaica. The subsequent battle of the Saintes resulted in a massive defeat for the French at the hands of the Royal Navy.

==French Revolution==
The French Revolution (1789) also affected Trinidad when Martiniquan planters and their slaves emigrated there and started to grow sugar and cocoa. Médéric Louis Élie Moreau de Saint-Méry, the deputy to the National Constituent Assembly for Martinique opposed representation for Free people of color.

On 4 April 1792, the French Legislative Assembly extended citizenship to all men of color. Donatien-Marie-Joseph de Vimeur, vicomte de Rochambeau was sent to Martinique to apply this law. The Constituent Assembly of Martinique agreed to promulgate this law. However they refused to allow Rochambeau to disembark with his troops. In 1793 there was a small, unsuccessful slave rebellion in Saint Pierre. The French executed six of the ringleaders. On 4 February 1793, Louis-Francois Dubuc signed the Whitehall Accord, putting Martinique under British jurisdiction until the French monarchy was reestablished. In doing so he forestalled the spread of the French Revolution to Martinique, preventing the Republican regime in France from acquiring control over the colony. Notably, the accord guaranteed all French colonists in Martinique the right to continue owning slaves.

In 1794 the French Convention issued a decree abolished slavery. However, before the decree could be transmitted to Martinique and implemented, the British invaded the island and occupied it. A British force under Admiral Sir John Jervis and Lieutenant-General Sir Charles Grey captured Fort Royal and Fort Saint Louis on 22 March and Fort Bourbon two days later. At that point all French resistance ceased. On 30 March 1794, the British occupation reinstated the &quot;ancien regime&quot;, including the French Monarchy&#x27;s Supreme Council and the seneschal&#x27;s courts of Trinité, Le Marin, and St Pierre. French Royalists regained possession of their properties and positions, including their slaves, and emancipation was forbidden by the Royalist authorities, who also promulgated an ordinance banning all gatherings of blacks or meetings by slaves, and forbade Carnival.

==Napoleonic Wars==
Six years later, in 1800, Jean Kina, an ex-slave from Saint Domingue and aide-de-camp to a British officer, fled to Morne Lemaître and called on free blacks and slaves to join him in a rebellion in support of the rights of the free blacks against the Royalist government. When Kina&#x27;s small force marched on Fort-Royal, British troops quickly responded and negotiated his surrender in return for amnesty. The British transported Kina to England, where they held him in Newgate Prison.

In 1802, the British returned the island to the French under the Treaty of Amiens. Napoléon Bonaparte reinstated slavery in the French colonies, though in Martinique it had never been abolished in practice, due to the British occupation. In 1796, he had married Martiniquan Joséphine de Beauharnais and in 1804 she became Empress of France.

During the Napoleonic Wars, in 1804 the British established a fort at Diamond Rock, outside Fort de France, and garrisoned it with some 120 sailors and five cannons. The Royal Navy commissioned the fort &quot;HMS Diamond Rock&quot; and from there were able for 17 months to harass vessels coming into the port. The French eventually sent a fleet of sixteen vessels that retook the island after a fierce bombardment.

The British again captured Martinique in 1809, and held it until 1814. In 1813, a hurricane killed 3,000 people in Martinique. During Napoleon&#x27;s Hundred Days in 1815, he abolished the slave trade. At the same time the British briefly re-occupied Martinique. The British, who had abolished the slave trade in their empire in 1807, forced Napoleon&#x27;s successor, Louis XVIII to retain the proscription, though it did not become truly effective until 1831.

==1815–1899==
A slave insurrection in 1822 resulted in two dead and seven injured. The government condemned 19 slaves to death, 10 to the galleys, six to whipping, and eight to helping with the executions.

Martinique has suffered from earthquakes as well as hurricanes. In 1839, an earthquake believed to have measured 6.5 on the Richter magnitude scale killed some 400 to 700 people, caused severe damage in Saint Pierre, and almost totally destroyed Fort Royal. Fort Royal was rebuilt in wood, reducing the risk from earthquakes, but increasing the risk from fire. That same year, there were 495 sugar producers in Martinique, who produced some 25,900 tons of &quot;white gold&quot;.

In February 1848, François Auguste Perrinon became head of the Committee of Colonists of Martinique. He was a member of the Commission for the abolition of slavery, led by Victor Schœlcher. On April 27, Schœlcher obtained a decree abolishing slavery in the French Empire. Perrinon was appointed Commissioner General of Martinique, and charged with the task of abolishing slavery there. However, he and the decree did not arrive in Martinique until June 3, by which time Governor Claude Rostoland had already abolished slavery. The imprisonment of a slave at Le Prêcheur had led to a slave revolt on May 20; two days later Rostoland, under duress, had abolished slavery on the island to quell the revolt. That same year, following the establishment of the Second Republic, Fort Royal became Fort-de-France. In 1981, May 22 was declared a national holiday in celebration of emancipation.

In 1851 a law was passed authorizing the creation of two colonial banks with the authority to issue banknotes. This led to the founding of the Bank of Martinique in Saint Pierre, and the Bank of Guadeloupe. (These banks would merge in 1967 to form the present-day Banque des Antilles Française).

Indentured laborers from India started to arrive in Martinique in 1853. Plantation owners recruited the Indians to replace the slaves, who once free, had fled the plantations. This led to the creation of the small but continuing Indian community in Martinique. This immigration repeated on a smaller scale the importation of Indians to such British colonies as British Guiana and Trinidad and Tobago following the abolition of slavery in the British Empire in 1833. Towards the end of the century, 1000 Chinese also came as earlier they had come to Cuba.

The city government in 1857-58 cleared and filled the flood channel encircling Fort de France. The channel had become an open sewer and hence a health hazard. The filled-in channel, La Levee, marked the northern boundary of the city.

Martinique got its second enduring financial institution in 1863 when the Crédit Foncier Colonial opened its doors in Saint Pierre. Its objective was to make long-term loans for the construction or modernization of sugar factories. It replaced the Crédit Colonial, which had been established in 1860, but seems hardly to have gotten going.

In 1868 construction work on the Radoub Basin port facilities at Fort de France finally was completed. The improvements to the port would enable Fort de France better to compete in trade and commerce with Saint Pierre.

In 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War, rising racial tensions led to the short-lived insurrection in southern Martinique and proclamation in Fort-de-France of a Martiniquan Republic. The insurrection started with an altercation between a local béké (white) and a black tradesman. A crowd lynched the béke and during the insurrection many sugar factories were torched. The authorities restored order by temporarily imprisoning some 500 rebels in Martinique&#x27;s forts. Seventy-four were tried and found guilty, and the twelve principal leaders were shot to death. The authorities deported the rest to French Guiana or New Caledonia.

By this time sugar cane fields covered some 57% of Martinique&#x27;s arable land. Unfortunately, falling prices for sugar forced many small sugar works to merge. Producers turned to rum production in an attempt to improve their fortunes.

When France established the Third Republic in 1871, the colonies, Martinique among them, gained representation in the National Assembly.

In 1887, after visiting Panama, Paul Gauguin spent some months with his friend Charles Laval, also a painter, in a cabin some two kilometers south of Saint Pierre. During this period Gauguin produced several paintings featuring Martinique. There is now a small Gauguin museum in Le Carbet that has reproductions of his Martinique paintings. That same year &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; sent the author and translator Lafcadio Hearn to Martinique for a short visit; he ended up staying for some two years. After his return to the United States he would publish two books, one an account of his daily life in Martinique and the other the story of a slave.

By 1888, the population of Martinique had risen from about 163,000 people a decade earlier to 176,000. At the same time, natural disasters continued to plague the island. Much of Fort de France was devastated by a fire in 1890, and then the next year a hurricane killed some 400 people.

In the 1880s, the Paris architect Pierre-Henri Picq built the Schœlcher Library, an iron and glass structure that was exhibited in the Tuileries Gardens during the 1889 Paris Exposition Universelle, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. After the Exposition the building was shipped to Fort de France and reassembled there, the work being completed by 1893. Initially, the library contained the 10,000 books that Victor Schœlcher had donated to the island. Today it houses over 250,000 and stands as a tribute to the man who led the movement to abolish slavery in Martinique. In 1895, Picq also built the Saint-Louis Cathedral in Fort-de-France.

== 20th century ==
The abolition of slavery did not end racially charged labor strife. In 1900, a strike at a sugar factory owned by a Frenchman led to the police shooting dead 10 agricultural workers.

=== Mount Pelée eruption ===
On May 8, 1902, a blast from the volcano Mont Pelée destroyed the town of St. Pierre, killing almost all of its 29,000 inhabitants. The only survivors were a shoemaker and a prisoner who was saved by his position in a jail dungeon with only a single window. Because Saint Pierre was the commercial capital of the island, there were four banks in the city—the Banque de la Martinique, Banque Transatlantique, a branch of the Colonial Bank of London, and the Crédit Foncier Colonial. All were destroyed. The town had to be completely rebuilt and lost its status as the commercial capital, a title which shifted to Fort-de-France. Due to the eruption, refugees from Martinique arrived in boats to the southern villages of Dominica and some remained permanently on the island.

===Return to normality===
A hurricane in 1903 killed 31 people and damaged the sugar crop and a strong earthquake off Saint Lucia in 1906 caused further damage in Martinique, but mercifully no deaths. As construction began on the Panama Canal, more than 5,000 Martiniquans left to work on the project.

Resettlement of Saint Pierre began in 1908. Even so, two years later the City of Saint Pierre was removed from the map of France with jurisdiction over the ruins transferring to Le Carbet. Elsewhere, political opponents assassinated the mayor of Fort de France, Antoine Seger in 1908.

With war with Germany looming, in 1913 France enacted compulsory military service in the colony, and called on Martinique to send 1,100 men per year to France for training. When World War I finally came, 18,000 Martiniquans took part, of whom 1,306 died. During the war, the French government requisitioned Martinique&#x27;s rum production for the use of the French Army. Production doubled as sugar mills converted to distilleries, helping the recovery of the local economy.

=== Between the World Wars ===
In 1923 Saint Pierre was reestablished as a municipality. Two years later, in Fort de France, the municipal council approved the Mayor&#x27;s proposal to redevelop the slum district of Terres Sainvilles as a &quot;workers city&quot;. The council would sell the new housing to the residents for 40 semi-annual interest-free payments.

With the collapse of the world market for sugar in 1921–22, cultivators sought a new crop. In 1928 they introduced bananas.

Mont Pelée became active in 1929, forcing the temporary evacuation of Saint Pierre. The Volcanological Observatory there did not get its first seismometer until some three years later.

In 1931, the Martiniquan Aimé Césaire moved to Paris to attend the Lycée Louis-le-Grand, the École Normale Supérieure, and finally the Sorbonne. While in Paris, Césaire met Léopold Senghor, then a poet but later Senegal&#x27;s first President. Césaire, Senghor, and Léon Damas, with whom Césaire had gone to school in Martinique at the Lycée Schœlcher, together formulated the concept of &quot;négritude&quot;, defined as an affirmation of pride in being black, and promoted it as a movement.

In 1933, André Aliker, the editor of &quot;Justice&quot;, the Communist newspaper, documented that a M. Aubéry, the wealthy, white owner of the Lareinty Company, had bribed the judges of the Court of Appeal to dismiss charges of tax fraud against him. That same year, Félix Eboué became the Acting Governor of the island, and an American, Frank Perret, established &quot;Le Musée Volcanologique&quot; at Saint Pierre.

In 1934, persons unknown kidnapped and murdered André Aliker; his body washed up on the beach with his arms tied behind him. Aimé Césaire, Senghor, Damas, and others, founded &quot;L&#x27;Etudiant&quot;, a Black student review.

In 1939, the French cruiser &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot; arrived late in the year with Admiral Georges Robert, High Commissioner of the Republic to the Antilles and Guiana. Aimé Césaire returned to Martinique. He became a teacher at the Lycée Schœlcher in Fort de France, where his students included Frantz Fanon and Édouard Glissant.

=== World War II ===

Until mid-1943, Martinique was officially pro-Vichy, with the US and Great Britain seeking to limit any effect of that stance on the war. The US did prepare plans for an invasion by an expeditionary force to capture the island, and at various times the US and Britain established blockades. For instance, from July to November 1940, the British cruisers and maintained a watch to ensure that the French aircraft carrier &quot;Béarn&quot; and the other French naval vessels in Martinique did not slip away to Europe.

In June 1940, the French cruiser &quot;Émile Bertin&quot; arrived in Martinique with 286 tons of gold from the Bank of France. The original intent was that Bank&#x27;s gold reserve go to Canada for safekeeping, and a first shipment did go there. When France signed an armistice with Germany, plans changed and the second shipment was rerouted to Martinique. When it arrived in Martinique, Admiral Robert arranged for the storage of the gold in Fort Desaix. The island was blockaded by the Royal Navy and the British used the gold as collateral for Lend-Lease facilities from the US, on the basis it could be &quot;acquired&quot; at any time if needed.

In late 1941, Admiral Robert agreed to keep the French naval vessels, including the &quot;Émile Bertin&quot; immobilized, in return for the Allies not bombarding and invading the French Antilles. In mid-1943, Admiral Robert returned to France via Puerto Rico and Lisbon, and Free French sympathizers took control of the gold at Fort Desaix and the French fleet.

In 1944, the American film director Howard Hawks directed Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Hoagy Carmichael and Walter Brennan in the film &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot;. Hawks more-or-less based the film on a novel that Ernest Hemingway had written in 1937. The essence of the plot is the conversion from neutrality to the Free French side of an American fishing boat captain operating out of Vichy-controlled Fort de France in 1940.

In 1945, Aimé Césaire succeeded in getting elected Mayor of Fort de France and Deputy from Martinique to the French National Assembly as a member of the Communist Party. Césaire remained mayor for 56 years. However, the Communist suppression of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 disillusioned him, causing him to quit the Communist Party. As a member of the Assembly, he was one of the principal drafters of the 1946 law on departmentalizing former colonies, a role for which politicians favoring independence have often criticized him.

In 1947 the High Court of Justice in Versailles tried Admiral Robert for collaboration. He received a sentence of 10 years at hard labor and national degradation for life. The Court released him from the hard labor after six months, and he received a pardon in 1957.

=== Departmental era ===
In 1946, the French National Assembly voted unanimously to transform Martinique from a colony of France into a department, known in French as a Département d&#x27;outre-mer or DOM. Along with its fellow DOMs of Guadeloupe, Réunion, and French Guiana, Martinique was intended to be legally identical to any department in the metropole. However, in reality, several key differences remained, particularly within social security payments and unemployment benefits.

Some think that French funding to the DOM has somewhat made up for the social and economic devastation of the slave trade and sugar crop monoculture. With French funding to Martinique, the island had one of the highest standards of living in the Caribbean. However, it remained, somewhat constrained, dependent upon French aid, as when measured by what Martinique actually produced, it was one of the poorer islands. Martinique being one of the poorer islands is due to everything costing on average 12.3% more than in France while salaries being on average lower. Many inequalities and political issues are also at cause.

<text>Earth First! is a radical environmental advocacy group that originated in the Southwestern United States. It was founded in 1980 by Dave Foreman, Mike Roselle, Howie Wolke, Bart Koehler, and Ron Kezar. Today there are Earth First groups around the world including ones in Australia, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Nigeria, New Zealand, the Philippines, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

Inspired by several environmental writings, including Rachel Carson&#x27;s &quot;Silent Spring&quot;, Aldo Leopold&#x27;s land ethic, and Edward Abbey&#x27;s &quot;The Monkey Wrench Gang&quot;, a small group of environmental activists composed of Dave Foreman, ex-Yippie Mike Roselle, Wyoming Wilderness Society representatives Bart Koehler and Howie Wolke, and Bureau of Land Management employee Ron Kezar, united to form Earth First. While traveling in Foreman&#x27;s VW bus from the El Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar Biosphere Reserve in northern Mexico to Albuquerque, New Mexico, the group pledged, &quot;No compromise in defense of Mother Earth!&quot;.

The co-founders of the group were called to action during the second &quot;Roadless Area Review and Evaluation&quot; (RARE II) by the U.S. Forest Service, which they considered a sell-out by mainstream environmental advocates. The activists envisioned a revolutionary movement, with the goal to set aside multi-million-acre ecological preserves all across the United States. Their ideas drew upon the concepts of conservation biology, which had been developing for over twenty years by notable scientists like E. O. Wilson; however, mainstream environmental groups were slow to embrace the new science. These events and ideologies coalesced after a grueling hike, as the men were headed toward Albuquerque. After &quot;Foreman called out &#x27;Earth First!&#x27;, Roselle drew a clenched fist logo, passed it up to the front of the van, and there was Earth First!&quot;.

== Early years, from 1980–1989 ==
Earth First was founded on April 4, 1980, by Dave Foreman, Mike Roselle, Howie Wolke, Bart Koehler, and Ron Kezar.

During the group&#x27;s early years (1980–1986), Earth First mixed publicity stunts (such as rolling a plastic &quot;crack&quot; down Glen Canyon Dam) with far-reaching wilderness proposals that reportedly surpassed the actions that mainstream environmental groups were willing to take (relying on conservation biology research from a biocentric perspective). The group&#x27;s proposals were published in a periodical, &quot;Earth First! The Radical Environmental Journal&quot;, informally known as the &quot;Earth First! Journal&quot;. Edward Abbey often spoke at early gatherings, and his inspirational writings led him to be revered by the early movement. An annual gathering of the group was known as the Round River Rendezvous, with the name taken from an Ojibwa myth about a continuous river of life flowing into and out of itself and sustaining all relations. The rendezvous is a celebration with art and music, as well as an activist conference with workshops and recounts of past actions. Musicians such as Dana Lyons, Judi Bari, Daryl Cherney, Joanne Rand, Bart Koehler, Casey Neill and others performed regularly on Earth First! promotional roadshows as well as at gatherings, protests and blockades. Another project led by the organization at this time was the creation of &quot;Earth First! Foundation&quot;, a tax-deductible fund which was established to provide financial support for research, advocacy and education by Earth First activists. The fund was later renamed the Fund for Wild Nature in 1991.

In the spring of 1985, a nationwide call to action against the logging company Willamette Industries, published in the &quot;Earth First! Journal&quot; brought Earth First members from around the United States to the Willamette National Forest of Western Oregon. After finding road blockades (carried out by Corvallis-based Cathedral Forest Action Group) were not an efficient form of protection against logging, Marylander Ron Huber and Washingtonian Mike Jakubal devised tree sitting as a more effective civil disobedience alternative.

On May 23, 1985, Mike Jakubal led the first Earth First tree sit. When U.S. Forest Service law enforcement official Steve Slagowski arrived, Mike Roselle, Ron Huber, and others were arrested for sitting at the base of the tree in support. The first &quot;tree-sitting&quot; lasted less than a day—Jakubal came down in the evening to look over the remains of the forest that had been cut down around him, and was arrested by a hidden Forest Service officer—but the tree-sitting concept was deemed sound by Earth First! members. Huber, Jakubal, and Roselle demonstrated the concept at the June 14 Washington EF Rendezvous; on June 23, a convoy of activists arrived at Willamette National Forest and set up tree platforms in &quot;Squaw/Three timbersale&quot;, a location the group thought was threatened with imminent destruction. While at one point, up to a dozen trees were occupied, on July 10 a clash took down all the trees with platforms except for Ron Huber&#x27;s after the other sitters had left for an overnight meeting elsewhere. Huber remained at his tree, dubbed Yggdrasil, until July 20 when two Linn County sheriff&#x27;s deputies were lifted in a crane box and wrestled him from the tree.

=== Direct action ===
After 1987, Earth First became primarily associated with direct action to prevent logging, building of dams, and other forms of development which may cause severe destruction of wildlife habitats or the despoliation of wild places. The change in direction attracted many new members to Earth First, some of whom came from a leftist or anarchist political background or were involved in the counterculture. Dave Foreman has suggested that this led to the introduction of activities such as a &quot;puke-in&quot; at a shopping mall, a flag burning, the heckling of Edward Abbey at the 1987 Earth First rendezvous, and back-and-forth debates in the &quot;Earth First! Journal&quot; on topics such as anarchism, with which Foreman and other Earth First members did not wish to be associated. Most of the group&#x27;s older members, including Dave Foreman, Howie Wolke, Bart Koehler, Christopher Manes, George Wuerthner, and &quot;Earth First! Journal&quot; editor John Davis, became increasingly uncomfortable with this new direction. This tension reportedly led several of the founders to sever their ties to Earth First in 1990. Many of them went on to launch the magazine, &quot;Wild Earth&quot;, as well as the environmental group, the Wildlands Project. On the other hand, Roselle, along with activists such as Judi Bari, welcomed the new direct-action tactics and leftist direction of Earth First.

Starting in the mid-1980s, Earth First increasingly promoted and identified with &quot;deep ecology&quot;, a philosophy put forth by Arne Næss, Bill Devall, and George Sessions, which holds that all forms of life on Earth have equal value in and of themselves, without regard for their utility to human beings.

== From 1990–present ==

Since 1990, action within the Earth First movement has become increasingly influenced by anarchist political philosophy. This change brought a rotation of the primary media organ in differing regions, an aversion to organized leadership or administrative structure, and a new trend of identifying Earth First as a mainstream movement rather than an organization. In 1992, Earth First&#x27;s push toward the mainstream movement led to the creation of an offshoot group called Earth Liberation Front. The Earth Liberation Front was formally introduced during the 1992 &quot;Earth First! Round River Rendezvous&quot;, where young activists debated the effectiveness of civil disobedience activism tactics in light of the ever-increasing destruction of the planet by human activity. Elders of the Earth First movement gave their blessing to this newly formed strike team known as ELF. ELF became the extremists of the environmental movement, just as the Earth First movement itself had been when it was created a decade earlier.

Earth First protests commonly involved occupations of forested timber sale areas and other threatened natural areas. In these protests, dozens of people physically locked their bodies to trees, bulldozers, and desks using specially created lock boxes (metal tubes reinforced with rebar) through which protesters threaded their arms, or using bicycle U-locks in order to lock their necks to other objects.

=== HeadWaters ===
The HeadWaters campaign in Northern California aimed to protect the last old-growth redwood forests, Headwaters Grove (now known as Headwaters Forest Reserve) of forest from logging by the Pacific Lumber Company. Charles Hurwitz and his company Maxxam, Inc. purchased Pacific Lumber Company in 1985, and planned to liquidate its assets including these old-growth forests.

In May 1987, sawmill worker George Alexander lost several teeth and fractured his jaw when the saw he was operating struck an 11-inch spike and fragmented, sending shrapnel into his face. This incident, which occurred at the Cloverdale Louisiana-Pacific mill in northern California, is alleged to have been caused by tree-spiking by Earth First! members, but no conclusive evidence has been found to prove this.

In 1997, as part of the ongoing HeadWaters Redwoods protests, activists locked themselves to a redwood stump which was carried into California Congressman Frank Riggs&#x27; office in Eureka. HeadWaters was an ongoing protest lasting over a decade, and ending in 2009.

The 1990s lawsuit, Headwaters Forest Defense vs. Humboldt County, charged that police officers were using excessive force, including chemical weapons.

The first acknowledged death of an Earth First activist occurred on September 18, 1998, in Northern California&#x27;s Redwood forests. Earth First activist David Nathan &quot;Gypsy&quot; Chain attempted to protect the forest by trespassing inside an active logging site. During the logging operations, a large redwood was cut down by a Pacific Lumber logger and fell upon Chain, who died instantly.

=== Cove-Mallard Timber ===
Between 1992 and 1998 took place the largest timber sale in United States Forest Service history, the Cove-Mallard timber sale of 6,000 acres in Idaho near the Nez Perce National Forest. The group of EarthFirst activists focused on this area were called the &quot;Cove-Mallard Coalition&quot;.

With the aid of a nearby landowner, a former land developer turned activist, Earth First occupied the forest. As a result, Earth First succeeded in saving most of the threatened wilderness area. Over 350 people from 12 countries were arrested and the project was reduced from its initial plan of 200 clear-cuts and the construction of seven new roads, to 37 clear-cuts and two new roads.
In June 1993, Earth First halted the construction of the Noble Road by erecting elaborate multi-layered barricades, which included U.S. Forest Service vehicles. These barricades were constructed in one night, during which activists traveled 17 miles through the mountains dodging law enforcement patrols who had been informed of the planned demonstration. The first tripod lockdowns occurred at this incident, which involved three 30 foot logs, tied together and placed upright, with an activist tied to a platform between them 20 feet in the air. The tripod was placed over trenches in which four activists were buried in quick-drying cement. Two additional activists used U-locks to lock their necks to the front axles of responding vehicles. U.S. Forest Service shot at activists and raided the land with a SWAT team armed with M-16s. 27 activists were arrested.

William &quot;Avalon&quot; Rodgers, a member of the Earth Liberation Front, who alongside the rest of his ELF group was also arrested and were serving life sentences in federal prison for crimes that involved property damage. Rodgers was a long term Earth First activist, and one of the occupation activists of Free Cascadia/Warner Creek Oregon and the Cove/Mallard Idaho protests for years and one of four who constantly camped out in snow-caves monitoring the only logging of Noble Road in the winter of January to March 1995 in 12-foot deep snow and sub-zero temps.

=== Free Cascadia ===
During Free Cascadia, a mass occupation organized by Earth First at the Warner Creek timber sale in Oregon, 50-plus activists continuously occupied the burnt forested mountains of Oregon for a year in 1994-1995. They endured bad weather and law enforcement raids. Their barricades which were dug in reinforced trenches, forts with watchtowers, and tree-sits enabled a constant occupation of the land while lawsuits and political actions locally and in Washington D.C., ultimately saved the land. Warner Creek is often seen an example of how the Earth First movement was successful, though most Earth First occupations of timber sales failed.

In the summer of 1995, environmental activists attempted to occupy the old-growth timber sale area of Sugarloaf Mountain in Southern Oregon. The Sugarloaf Mountain had been in legal battles for over a decade when the &quot;Rider from Hell&quot; was added in committee to the congressional Crime Bill of 1994, which mandated the logging of thousands of acres of old-growth forest. The United States Forest Service declared an exclusionary zone of 30 square miles in southern Oregon and arrested anyone in the area, including a local woman walking her dog. Over 100 federal agents, supported by helicopters and the elite US Army Ranger-trained law enforcement squad known as &quot;Camo-Feddies,&quot; arrested hundreds of activists. The environmental activists engaged at all levels of protest with numerous public and illegal demonstrations by Earth First, protests at government offices locally and in Washington D.C., tree-sits in active logging zones, and even an attempted helicopter pad lock-down to immobilize logging helicopters. One tree from Sugarloaf timber sale, which was a four day long tree-sit by a local father and son Earth First team, required 9 log trucks to carry it out in sections. This tree was estimated to be over 400 years old and took twenty-seven minutes to cut down using a 7-foot chainsaw.

Earth First responded by immediately occupying the nearby timber sale known as China Left in early October 1995 to defend the old-growth forest and the last wild salmon spawning grounds in Oregon. EF activists used dragon lock-boxes on both ends of the valley&#x27;s only road to protect the area. A female Earth First activist known as &quot;Ocean&quot; held the road for a day as police attempted to remove this human-and-cement blockade, allowing Earth First to dig in farther down the valley. This was the start of two-year-long occupation protest, during which a pickup truck was turned into a lock box to block the only bridge to the valley.

=== Judi Bari car bombing ===
In 1990, a bomb exploded in the car of Earth First activist Judi Bari, injuring Bari and fellow activist Darryl Cherney. Bari and Cherney were arrested due to suspicions by the police and Federal Bureau of Investigation that they had been transporting a bomb that had accidentally exploded. Bari contended that extremists opposed to her pro-environmental actions had placed the bomb in her car in order to kill her. The case against them was eventually dropped due to lack of evidence.

Bari died of cancer in 1997, but her federal lawsuit against the FBI and Oakland, California police resulted in a 2002 jury verdict awarding her estate and Darryl Cherney a total of $4.4 million.

A documentary movie about the court case, entitled &quot;The Forest for the Trees&quot;, was released in 2006. It was directed by Bernadine Mellis, whose father is one of the lawyers featured in the documentary. The documentary &quot;Who Bombed Judi Bari?&quot;, directed by Mary Liz Thomson, was released in 2012. The filmmakers are offering a $50,000 reward for information leading the arrest of the bomber.

On March 21, 2011, a U.S. federal judge in California ordered the FBI to preserve evidence related to the car bombing. The FBI was planning to destroy all evidence in the case. The bombing remains unsolved.

== Protest and ecodefense ==
Most activists of Earth First have previously participated in more moderate forms of environmental and political activism, including protest marches and writing letters to politicians. &#x27;Fawn&quot;, an Earth Firster in the United States, grew up as a Republican, in a middle-class family. Most members of Earth First identify as decentralized, locally informed activists whose ideas stem from communitarian ethics. One of the early critics of Earth First&#x27;s change in tactics later accused the FBI of deliberately introducing the concept of Non-Violence to the group.

In various parts of the United States, individual citizens and small groups form the base for grassroots political actions. These may take the form of legal actions, including protests, timber sale appeals, and educational campaigns or civil disobedience, including tree sitting, road blockades, and sabotage (also called &quot;ecotage&quot; by some Earth First members, who claim it is a form of ecodefense). Often, disruptive direct action is used primarily as a stalling tactic in an attempt to prevent possible environmental destruction while Earth First lawsuits try to secure long-term victories. Reported tactics include road blockades, activists locking themselves to heavy equipment, tree-sitting, and sabotage of machinery.

Earth First was known for providing information in the &quot;Earth First! Journal&quot; on the practice of tree-spiking and monkeywrenching (or ecotage), although there is no evidence that Earth First was involved in related activity. In 1990, Judi Bari convinced Earth First in the Northern California and Southern Oregon region to renounce the practice of tree-spiking, calling them counterproductive to an effort to form a coalition with workers and small logging businesses to defeat large-scale corporate logging in Northern California.

Police used non-lethal weapons and tactics against Earth First protesters including pepper spray, pain compliance holds, police dogs, and the threat of guns in attempts to coerce the protesters to abandon their lock downs.

== United Kingdom ==
The movement in the United Kingdom started in 1990, when a group in Hastings, Sussex organised an action at Dungeness nuclear power station in Kent. It grew rapidly, and many groups formed, with or without the EF name, over the next years.

The first major Earth First action happened in December 1991 at Port of Tilbury and focused around the importation of tropical hardwood. The second major action, the &quot;Merseyside Dock Action&quot;, attracted between 200–600 people who occupied Liverpool docks for two days. This action coincided with the Earth First roadshow, in which a group of UK &amp; US Earth Firsters toured the country. Other early campaigns also focused on timber-yards, most notably the Timbmet yard in Oxford.

There are now various regional Earth First groups, the &quot;EF! Action Update&quot; has been joined by the &quot;EF! Action Reports website&quot; and a yearly Earth First national gathering. At the first gathering in Sussex the debate focused on the use of criminal damage as a protest technique. Earth First decided to neither &#x27;condemn nor condone&#x27; criminal damage, instead it focused more on non-violent direct action techniques. Some people at the gathering coined the term Earth Liberation Front (ELF), which became a separate movement and spread back to the US. Actions involving criminal damage often happened under cover of night, typically done under an ELF banner and attributed to elves and pixies, or the Earth Liberation Faeries, giving a distinctly British feel to the movement.

Major growth in the direct action movement started with a concurrent focus on roads, and a protest camp at Twyford Down was started, against the M3 in Hampshire. Whilst Earth First groups still played an essential part, other groups such as the Dongas tribe soon formed. Alongside SchNEWS, such publications as the &quot;Earth First! Action Update&quot;, and &quot;Do or Die&quot; were means of communication between the groups. The movement grew to other road protest camps including the Newbury bypass, the A30 and the M11 link road protest in London, where whole streets were squatted in order to slow down the construction work. Later the focus widened to other campaigns including Reclaim the Streets, anti-genetics campaigns, and Rising Tide. More recently, there have been groups such as Peat Alert! and Plane Stupid.

The UK Earth First groups differed considerably from the U.S. groups as reported in a ten-year retrospective of the Earth First by two of the founders Jake Bowers and Jason Torrance:

Seeing ecological and social justice as one and the same, in addition to organizing along anarchist lines and bringing in other radical and militant struggles, mixed with audacious actions and real radicalism spread the EF ideal to other countries and helped morph the US movement.

== Sabotage ==
=== Fairfield Snowbowl Ski Resort ===
Earth First member Mark Davis was sentenced in Federal court to six years in prison for malicious destruction of property at the Fairfield Snowbowl Ski Resort near Flagstaff, Arizona, in concert with David Foreman, Ilse Asplund, Margaret Millett, and Mark Baker. Davis had been charged with &quot;using a torch to cut around the base of the top pylon of the main chair lift at Snowbowl on October 25, 1988.&quot;

The resort attack, sabotage at Energy Fuels&#x27; Canyon uranium mine (6 miles southeast of Tusayan, Arizona), and attempting to cut down power-line towers leading to the Central Arizona Project aqueduct, were characterized as dress rehearsals for attacks on nuclear plants.

=== Telluride Ski Resort ===
On August 10, 1991, vandals identifying themselves as members of Earth First forced the closing of the Telluride Ski Resort in Mountain Village, Colorado using a chemical to write messages on 11 greens, such as &quot;Earth First!&quot;, &quot;Hayduke lives&quot; and &quot;Ron you pig&quot;. In relation to the incident, the &quot;Telluride Times Journal&quot; received a letter signed &quot;Earth First&quot; stating that the ski lift had been sabotaged with a welding gas applied to the lift cable that weakens the metal.

=== Aspen Pipeline Sabotage ===
A gas pipeline in Aspen Colorado was sabotaged turning off heat to 3,500 people on December 29, 2020. The perpetrators wrote &quot;Earth First!&quot; on the pipeline.

<text>Francis August Schaeffer (January 30, 1912 – May 15, 1984) was an American evangelical theologian, philosopher, and Presbyterian pastor. He co-founded the L&#x27;Abri community in Switzerland with his wife Edith Schaeffer, , a prolific author in her own right. Opposed to theological modernism (which prefers, e.g., rational thought and religious experience over doctrinal pronouncements by leaders or following religious traditions), Schaeffer promoted what he claimed was a more historic Protestant faith and a presuppositional approach to Christian apologetics, which he believed would answer the questions of the age.

== Biography ==

Schaeffer was born on January 30, 1912, in Germantown, Pennsylvania, to Franz A. Schaeffer III and Bessie Williamson. He was of German and English ancestry.

In 1935, Schaeffer graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; from Hampden–Sydney College. The same year he married Edith Seville, the daughter of missionary parents who had been with the China Inland Mission founded by Hudson Taylor. Schaeffer then enrolled at Westminster Theological Seminary in the fall and studied under Cornelius Van Til (presuppositional apologetics) and J. Gresham Machen (doctrine of inerrancy).

In 1937, Schaeffer transferred to Faith Theological Seminary, graduating in 1938. This seminary was newly formed as a result of a split between the Presbyterian Church of America (now the Orthodox Presbyterian Church) and the Bible Presbyterian Church, a Presbyterian denomination more identified with Fundamentalist Christianity and premillennialism. Schaeffer was the first student to graduate and the first to be ordained in the Bible Presbyterian Church. He served pastorates in Pennsylvania (Grove City and Chester) and St. Louis, Missouri. Schaeffer eventually sided with the Bible Presbyterian Church Columbus Synod following the BPC Collingswood and BPC Columbus split in 1956. BPC Columbus reorganized as the Evangelical Presbyterian Church in 1961, and Schaeffer followed the EPC into the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Evangelical Synod when the Bible Presbyterian Church&#x27;s Columbus Synod merged with the Reformed Presbyterian Church, General Synod in 1965, a denomination which would merge with the Presbyterian Church in America, in 1982.

In 1948, the Schaeffer family moved to Switzerland and in 1955 established the community called (French for ). Serving as both a philosophy seminar and a spiritual community, L&#x27;Abri attracted thousands of young people, and was later expanded into Sweden, France, the Netherlands, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States.

Schaeffer received numerous honorary degrees. In 1954, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree from Highland College in Long Beach, California. In 1971, he received an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from Gordon College in Wenham, Massachusetts. In 1982, John Warwick Montgomery nominated Schaeffer for an honorary Doctor of Laws degree, which was conferred in 1983 by the Simon Greenleaf School of Law, Anaheim, California in recognition of his apologetic writings and ministry.

Schaeffer died of lymphoma on May 15, 1984, in Rochester, Minnesota. He opened a L&#x27;Abri branch there before his death. Schaeffer Academy, a private K-12 school in Rochester, is named after him.

== Family relationships ==
In &quot;Crazy for God&quot;, Schaeffer&#x27;s son Frank presents a portrait of his father that is far more nuanced and multi-dimensional than was suggested by his public persona. He states, for example, that Schaeffer&#x27;s primary passions in life were not the Bible and theology but rather art and culture. &quot;And what moved him was not theology but beauty&quot;. Schaeffer&#x27;s son claims he had frequent bouts with depression and a verbally and physically abusive relationship with his wife, Edith. Those in the inner circle at L&#x27;Abri challenge Frank&#x27;s account. Os Guinness, who lived with the Schaeffers and was a close friend of both the younger and elder Schaeffer, described &quot;Crazy for God&quot; as a &quot;scurrilous caricature&quot; and said, &quot;[N]o one should take Frank&#x27;s allegations at face value.&quot;

Frank Schaeffer initially supported his father&#x27;s ideas and political program, but has since distanced himself from many of those views, first converting to the Eastern Orthodox Church and later becoming a liberal and a self-described &quot;atheist who believes in God.&quot;

== Apologetics ==

Schaeffer&#x27;s approach to Christian apologetics was primarily influenced by Herman Dooyeweerd, Edward John Carnell, and Cornelius Van Til, but he was not known to be a strict presuppositionalist in the Van Tillian tradition. His approach to culture was heavily influenced by his friendship with Hans Rookmaaker. In a 1948 article in &quot;The Bible Today&quot;, Schaeffer explained his own apologetics and how he walked a middle path between evidentialism and presuppositionalism, noting that &quot;If the unsaved man was consistent he would be an atheist in religion, an irrationalist in philosophy (including a complete uncertainty concerning &#x27;natural laws&#x27;), and completely a-moral in the widest sense.&quot; J. Budziszewski summarizes the article about this &quot;middle path&quot; approach by writing:

Schaeffer came to use this &quot;middle path&quot; as the basis for his method of evangelism which he called &quot;Taking the roof off&quot;. An example of &quot;Taking the roof off&quot; in written form can be found in Schaeffer&#x27;s work entitled &quot;Death in the City.&quot; Nancy Pearcey also describes two books by Schaeffer, &quot;Escape From Reason&quot; and &quot;The God Who Is There&quot; in this way:

=== Influence of Rushdoony ===

In the 1960s Schaeffer read the works of Reconstructionist theologian Rousas John Rushdoony with appreciation, and according to Barry Hankins, &quot;it is quite likely that Schaeffer&#x27;s belief that the United States was founded on a Christian base came in part from Rushdoony.&quot; Schaeffer later lost this fervor because Rushdoony was a postmillennialist (holding the doctrine that the kingdom of God will be built on earth before the second coming of Jesus) while Schaeffer was a premillennialist (holding that the kingdom of God will only be ushered in with the second coming). Further Schaeffer thought that Rushdoony&#x27;s system would require a merger of church and state, which he opposed. He held that the principles, not the actual details, of Old Testament civil law were applicable under the New Covenant of Jesus. He wrote &quot;The moral law [of the Old Testament], of course, is constant, but the civil law only was operative for the Old Testament theocracy. I do not think there is any indication of a theocracy in the New Testament until Christ returns as king.&quot;

== Legacy ==
The Francis A. Schaeffer Foundation in Gryon, Switzerland is led by one of his daughters and sons-in-law as a small-scale alternative to the original L&#x27;Abri Fellowship International, which is still operating in nearby Huemoz-sur-Ollon and other places in the world. Covenant Theological Seminary has established the Francis A. Schaeffer Institute directed by a former English L&#x27;Abri member, Jerram Barrs. The purpose of the school is to train Christians to demonstrate compassionately and defend reasonably what they see as the claims of Christ on all of life.

According to Michael Hamilton of &quot;Christianity Today&quot;, &quot;Perhaps no intellectual save C. S. Lewis affected the thinking of evangelicals more profoundly [than Francis Schaeffer]; perhaps no leader of the period save Billy Graham left a deeper stamp on the movement as a whole.&quot;

=== Institute of Church Leadership ===

In 1978, Schaeffer asked a group of Reformed Episcopal Clergy to research his thoughts and current trends, forming a church guild called &quot;The Society of Reformed Philosophical Thinkers&quot;. This was merged in 1988 with &quot;Into Thy Word Ministries&quot;, which was then transformed into &quot;The Francis A. Schaeffer Institute of Church Leadership Development&quot; in 1998. Its purpose is to strategize how to reach and train pastors and church leaders to focus on Christ centered principles. Its aim is to point the church back to &quot;true-Truth&quot; and &quot;true spirituality&quot;. The foundation develops comprehensive curriculum for pastors, church planters and church leaders.

=== Seven Constituents Mandate ===
In 1975, along with fellow evangelists Bill Bright (founder of Campus Crusade for Christ) and Loren Cunningham (founder of Youth With a Mission), Schaeffer was one of the founders of what would later be termed the Seven Mountain Mandate. The idea would later go on to be popularized by Bethel Church pastor Bill Johnson and Lance Wallnau, among others. The concept centers around Christians taking dominion of seven societal spheres of influence: &quot;family, religion, education, media, art, economics, and government.&quot;

=== Political activism ===

Francis Schaeffer is credited with helping spark a return to political activism among Protestant evangelicals and fundamentalists in the late 1970s and early 1980s, especially in relation to the issue of abortion. In his memoir &quot;Crazy for God,&quot; Schaeffer&#x27;s son Frank takes credit for pressing his father to take on the abortion issue, which Schaeffer initially considered &quot;too political&quot;. Schaeffer called for a challenge to what he saw as the increasing influence of secular humanism. Schaeffer&#x27;s views were expressed in two works, his book entitled &quot;A Christian Manifesto&quot;, as well as the book and film series, &quot;Whatever Happened to the Human Race?&quot;.

=== &quot;A Christian Manifesto&quot; ===
Schaeffer&#x27;s book &quot;A Christian Manifesto&quot; was published in 1981 and later delivered as a sermon in 1982. It was intended as a Christian answer to &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot; of 1848 and the &quot;Humanist Manifesto&quot; documents of 1933 and 1973. Schaeffer&#x27;s diagnosis is that the decline of Western Civilization is due to society having become increasingly pluralistic, resulting in a shift &quot;away from a world view that was at least vaguely Christian in people&#x27;s memory… toward something completely different.&quot; Schaeffer argues that there is a philosophical struggle between the people of God and the secular humanists. In the sermon version of the book, Schaeffer defines secular humanism as the worldview where &quot;man is the measure of all things&quot;. He claims that critics of the Christian right miss the mark by confusing the &quot;humanist religion&quot; with humanitarianism, the humanities, or love of humans. He describes the conflict with secular humanism as a battle in which &quot;these two religions, Christianity and humanism, stand over against each other as totalities.&quot; He writes that the decline of commitment to objective truth that he perceives in the various institutions of society is &quot;not because of a conspiracy, but because the church has forsaken its duty to be the salt of the culture.&quot;

He then suggests that similar tactics be used to stop abortion. But Schaeffer argues he is not talking about a theocracy:

Christian Reconstructionists Gary North and David Chilton were highly critical of &quot;A Christian Manifesto&quot; and Schaeffer. Their critical comments were prompted, they wrote, by the popularity of Schaeffer&#x27;s book. They suggested that Schaeffer supports pluralism because he sees the First Amendment as freedom of religion for all; and they themselves reject pluralism. Pointing out negative statements Schaeffer made about theocracy, North and Chilton then explain why they promote it. They extend their criticism of Schaeffer:

=== Influence on Christian conservatives ===
Christian conservative leaders such as Tim LaHaye have credited Schaeffer for influencing their theological arguments urging political participation by evangelicals.

Beginning in the 1990s, critics began exploring the intellectual and ideological connection between Schaeffer&#x27;s political activism and writings of the early 1980s to contemporary religious-political trends in the Christian Right, sometimes grouped under the name Dominionism, with mixed conclusions.

Sara Diamond and Frederick Clarkson have written articles tracing the activism of numerous key figures in the Christian Right to the influence of Francis Schaeffer. According to Diamond: &quot;The idea of taking dominion over secular society gained widespread currency with the 1981 publication of...Schaeffer&#x27;s book &quot;A Christian Manifesto&quot;. The book sold 290,000 copies in its first year, and it remains one of the movement&#x27;s most frequently cited texts.&quot;
Diamond summarizes the book and its importance to the Christian Right:

: In &quot;A Christian Manifesto&quot;, Schaeffer&#x27;s argument is simple. The United States began as a nation rooted in Biblical principles. But as society became more pluralistic, with each new wave of immigrants, proponents of a new philosophy of secular humanism gradually came to dominate debate on policy issues. Since humanists place human progress, not God, at the center of their considerations, they pushed American culture in all manner of ungodly directions, the most visible results of which included legalized abortion and the secularization of the public schools. At the end of -- A Christian Manifesto, Schaeffer calls for Christians to use civil disobedience to restore Biblical morality, which explains Schaeffer&#x27;s popularity with groups like Operation Rescue. Randall Terry has credited Schaeffer as a major influence in his life.

Frederick Clarkson explains that this had practical applications:

: &quot;Francis Schaeffer is widely credited with providing the impetus for Protestant evangelical political action against abortion. For example, Randall Terry, the founder of Operation Rescue, says: &quot;You have to read Schaeffer&#x27;s Christian Manifesto if you want to understand Operation Rescue.&quot; Schaeffer, a longtime leader in Rev. Carl McIntire&#x27;s splinter denomination, the Bible Presbyterian Church, was a reader of Reconstructionist literature but has been reluctant to acknowledge its influence. Indeed, Schaeffer and his followers specifically rejected the modern application of Old Testament law.&quot;

Analyses of Schaeffer as the major intellectual influence on Dominionism can be found in the works of authors such as Diamond and Chip Berlet. Other authors argue against a close connection with dominionism, for example Irving Hexham of the University of Calgary, who maintains that Schaeffer&#x27;s political position has been misconstrued as advocating the Dominionist views of R. J. Rushdoony, who is a Christian Reconstructionist. Hexham indicates that Schaeffer&#x27;s essential philosophy was derived from Herman Dooyeweerd, not Rushdoony, and that Hans Rookmaaker introduced Schaeffer to his writings. Dooyeweerd was a Dutch legal scholar and philosopher, following in the footsteps of Neo-Calvinist Abraham Kuyper.

Congresswoman and 2012 United States presidential candidate Michele Bachmann has cited Schaeffer&#x27;s documentary series &quot;How Should We Then Live?&quot; as having a &quot;profound influence&quot; on her life and that of her husband Marcus.

== Writings ==

Francis A. Schaeffer wrote twenty-two books, which covering a range of issues. They can be roughly split into five sections, as in the edition of his &quot;Complete Works&quot; ():

* A Christian View of Philosophy and Culture: The first three books in this block are known as Schaeffer&#x27;s &quot;trilogy&quot;, laying down the apologetical, philosophical, epistemological, and theological foundation for all his work.
** &quot;The God Who Is There&quot;: Deals with the existence and relevance of God, and how modern man came to first distance himself from, and ultimately disbelieve, God as revealed by the Bible.
** &quot;Escape from Reason&quot;: How the rejection of the biblical God causes man to lose contact with reality and reason.
** &quot;He Is There and He Is Not Silent&quot;: How God speaks to man through the Bible on the three philosophically fundamental areas of metaphysics, morals, and epistemology.
** &quot;Back to Freedom and Dignity&quot;: An answer to B.F. Skinner&#x27;s &quot;Beyond Freedom and Dignity&quot;, arguing that freedom and dignity of man are God-given and therefore can&#x27;t be left aside without dire consequences.
* A Christian View of the Bible as Truth
** &quot;Genesis in Space and Time&quot;: Argues that the historical (as opposed to literalist or figurative) view of Genesis as historically true is fundamental to the Christian faith.

In addition to his books, one of the last public lectures Schaeffer delivered was at the Law Faculty, University of Strasbourg. It was published as &quot;Christian Faith and Human Rights&quot;, &quot;The Simon Greenleaf Law Review&quot;, 2 (1982–83) pp. 3–12. Most of his writings during his Bible Presbyterian days have not been collected, nor reprinted in decades.

In addition to the five volume &quot;Complete Works&quot; listed above there were also two books by Dr. Schaeffer published after his death:

* Dennis, Lane T. (ed) &quot;Letters of Francis A. Schaeffer&quot;, Crossway Books, Westchester, 1985.
* Schaeffer, Francis A. &quot;The Finished Work of Christ: The Truth of Romans 1–8&quot;, Crossway Books, Wheaton, 1998.

Schaeffer was persuaded to adapt his book &quot;How Should We Then Live? The Rise and Decline of Western Thought and Culture&quot; to film by Gospel Films, Inc. CEO and executive evangelical media producer Billy Zeoli who pitched the idea of hiring Schaeffer&#x27;s then recently married son, teenage father, and painter Frank Schaeffer as a producer for the film project. Zeoli was instrumental in providing the Schaeffers with introductions to wealthy American evangelicals who would eventually bankroll the &quot;How We Should Then Live&quot; film project. This book is still being read and used today in American Universities as well as in various small group studies to help shed light on the contemporary cultural problems of the past and how they have led to many of the issues that America is facing today. Issues such as race, apathy, abortion, and the non-compassionate use of wealth are topics still relevant today. Schaeffer argues that the humanist base for morals is fundamentally a weak base upon which to build a moral framework for society. By contrast, the Bible, understood as the revealed revelation from God is able to provide a fundamentally sound basis for societal norms as well as a base for science. The president of Christian Leaders Institute (CLI), Henry Reyenga Jr., secured rights to post this film series in an ethics class at CLI. This freemium ministry training school lists &quot;deceased&quot; Francis Schaeffer on its faculty.

The American distribution of the book and film was responsible for bringing many evangelical Protestants into the then largely Roman Catholic public protest movement against the United States Supreme Court &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; decision, supporting legal abortion in the United States.

* &quot;How Should We Then Live? The Rise and Decline of Western Thought and Culture&quot; (1976). Frank Schaeffer produced his father Francis Schaeffer&#x27;s film series, which was released with a book by the same title.
* &quot;Whatever Happened to the Human Race? &quot; (1979). A Christian response to abortion, euthanasia, and infanticide, narrated by Francis Schaeffer and future Surgeon General Dr. C. Everett Koop; it was released with a book by the same title.

<text>Islamic fundamentalism has been defined as a revivalist and reform movement of Muslims who aim to return to the founding scriptures of Islam. The term has been used interchangeably with similar terms such as Islamism, Islamic revivalism, Qutbism, Islamic activism, and has been criticized as pejorative.

Some of the beliefs attributed to Islamic fundamentalists are that the primary sources of Islam (the Quran, Hadith, and Sunnah), should be interpreted in a literal and originalist way; that corrupting non-Islamic influences should be eliminated from every part of Muslims&#x27; lives; and that the societies, economies, and governance of Muslim-majority countries should return to the fundamentals of Islam, the system of Islam, and become Islamic states.

==Definitions and descriptions==

The term fundamentalism has been deemed misleading by those who suggest that all mainstream Muslims believe in the literal divine origin and perfection of the Quran and are therefore &quot;fundamentalists&quot;, and others who believe it is a term that is used by outsiders in order to describe perceived trends within Islam. A professor of religious studies at Georgetown University, John L. Esposito, criticized the usage of the term &quot;Islamic Fundamentalism&quot; due to its ambiguous nature; asserting that the linguistic deployment of the term has been heavily influenced through Western-centric lens of Christian presuppositions. According to him, the more appropriate terms would be &quot;Islamic revivalism&quot; and &quot;Islamic activism&quot;, since the traditions of &quot;Tajdid&quot; (revival) and &quot;Islah&quot; (reform) are rooted within the Islamic religious history, from the early Islamic centuries to the contemporary times. During the 1990s, the post-Soviet states used &quot;Islamic fundamentalism&quot; as a synonym for &quot;Wahhabism&quot;.

Some 20th century preachers and writers sometimes dubbed Islamic fundamentalist include Sayyid Qutb, Ibn Saud, Abul Ala Mawdudi, and Israr Ahmed. The Wahhabi movement and its funding by Saudi Arabia is often described as being responsible for the popularity of contemporary Islamic fundamentalism.

Definitions vary as to what Islamic fundamentalism exactly is and how it differs from Islamism (or political Islam) or Islamic revivalism.

* Form of Islamism – Graham Fuller believes that Islamic fundamentalism is a subset of Islamism rather than a distinctive form of it, and to him, Islamic fundamentalists are &quot;the most conservative element among Islamists&quot;. Its &quot;strictest form&quot; includes &quot;Wahhabism, which is sometimes referred to as salafiyya. ... For fundamentalists the law is the most essential component of Islam, and it leads to an overwhelming emphasis upon jurisprudence, usually narrowly conceived.&quot; Author Olivier Roy takes a similar line, describing &quot;neo-fundamentalists&quot;, (i.e. contemporary fundamentalists) as being more passionate than earlier Islamists in their opposition to the perceived &quot;corrupting influence of Western culture&quot;, avoiding Western dress, &quot;neckties, laughter, the use of Western forms of salutation, handshakes, applause&quot;, discouraging but not forbidding other activities such as sports, ideally limiting the Muslim public space to &quot;the family and the mosque&quot;. In this fundamentalists have &quot;drifted&quot; away from the stand of the Islamists of the 1970s and 1980s, such as [Abul A&#x27;la Maududi] who:

* Umbrella term – Another American observer, Robert Pelletreau, Jr., Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, believes it the other way around, Islamism being the subset of Muslims &quot;with political goals ... within&quot; the &quot;broader fundamentalist revival&quot;. American historian Ira Lapidus sees Islamic fundamentalism as &quot;an umbrella designation for a very wide variety of movements, some intolerant and exclusivist, some pluralistic; some favourable to science, some anti-scientific; some primarily devotional and some primarily political; some democratic, some authoritarian; some pacific, some violent.&quot; 
* Synonym – Still another, Martin Kramer, sees little difference between the two terms (at least in usage in one country): &quot;To all intents and purposes, Islamic fundamentalism and Islamism have become synonyms in contemporary American usage.&quot;
* Scriptural literalism – According to another academic, Natana J. Delong-Bas, the contemporary use of the term Islamic fundamentalism applies to Muslims who seek not just &quot;to return to the primary sources&quot;, but who use &quot;a literal interpretation of those sources&quot;.
* Use of &quot;ijtihad&quot; in Islamic law – According to academic John Esposito, one of the most defining features of Islamic fundamentalism is belief in the &quot;reopening&quot; of the gates of &quot;ijtihad&quot; (&quot;independent reasoning&quot; used in reaching a legal decision in Sunni law).

===Differences with Islamism===
According to Roy distinctions between Fundamentalism and Islamism (or at least pre-1990 Islamism) are in the fields of:

* Politics and economics. Islamists often talk of &quot;revolution&quot; and they believe &quot;that the society will only be Islamized through social and political action: it is necessary to leave the mosque ...&quot; Fundamentalists are primarily interested in Islamic practice, less interested in &quot;modernity or Western models of politics or economics&quot;, and less willing to associate with non-Muslims.
* Sharia. While both Islamists and fundamentalists are committed to implementing Sharia law, Islamists &quot;tend to consider it more a project than a corpus.&quot;
* Issue of women. &quot;Islamists generally tend to favour the education of women and their participation in social and political life: the Islamist woman militates, studies, and has the right to work, but in a chador. Islamist groups include women&#x27;s associations.&quot; While the fundamentalist preaches that women should return to their homes, Islamism believes that it is sufficient if &quot;the sexes are separated in public&quot;.
* Variety and diversity within Islamic social movements has been highlighted by Husnul Amin in his work by referring to plurality within these movements.

Historian Ervand Abrahamian (who essentially devoted a book—&quot;Khomeinism: Essays on the Islamic Republic&quot;—to why Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, leader of the Iranian Revolution, was not a fundamentalist but a populist, and calls the term &quot;Islamic fundamentalism&quot; in general &quot;not only confusing but also misleading and even downright wrong&quot;), notes that in the Islamic Republic of Iran, supporters of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini &quot;finding no equivalent in Persian or Arabic&quot; for fundamentalist, &quot;have proudly coined a new word, &quot;bonyadegar&quot;, by translating literally the English term fundamental-ist.&quot;

===Differences with Christian fundamentalism===

Differences between Christian fundamentalism and Islamic fundamentalism include (according to Bernard Lewis):
===Types===
Islamic fundamentalism (at least among Sunni Muslims) traditionally tends to fall into &quot;traditionalist&quot; and &quot;reformist&quot; tendencies:
* Traditionalists accept &quot;the continuity&quot; between the founding Islamic &quot;texts&quot;—the &quot;Quran&quot; and the &quot;Sunnah&quot;—and their commentaries. Traditionalists take &quot;imitation&quot; (&quot;taqlid&quot;), accepting what was said before and refusing to innovate (&quot;bidah&quot;), as a &quot;basic principle, They follow one of the great schools of religious jurisprudence (Shafi&#x27;i, Maliki, Hanafi, Hanbali). Their vision of the &quot;sharia&quot; is essentially legalistic and used to determine what is religiously right or wrong for Enjoining good and forbidding wrong. Traditionalists are sometimes connected to the popular forms of Sufism such as the Barelvi school in Pakistan).&quot;
* &quot;Renewalist&quot; fundamentalism, in contrast, &quot;criticizes the tradition, the commentaries, popular religious practices&quot; (Maraboutism, the cult of saints), &quot;deviations, and superstitions&quot;; it aims to purify Islam by returning to the &quot;Quran&quot; and the &quot;Sunnah&quot;. 18th-century examples are Shah Waliullah Dehlawi in India and Ibn Abdul Wahhab in the Arabian Peninsula. This reformism is often &quot;developed in response to an external threat&quot; such as &quot;the influence of Hinduism on Islam&quot;. In the late 19th century, the &quot;salafiyya&quot; movement spread throughout the Arab countries; &quot;marking a phase between Fundamentalism and Islamism&quot;. Sayyid Rashid Rida (1865–1935), a major scholar of the early &quot;Salafiyya&quot;, believed that the triumphs of early generations of Muslims (&quot;Salaf&quot;) were God&#x27;s reward for them being faithful followers and blamed contemporary decline of Muslims on four major factors: i) European imperialism ii) Western philosophy iii) neglect of the correct practice of Islam iv) &quot;Raafidi&quot; doctrines

===Controversy===
====Criticism of the term====
The term &quot;Islamic fundamentalism&quot; has been criticized by Bernard Lewis, Khaled Abou El Fadl, Eli Berman, and John Esposito, among others. Many have proposed replacing it with another term, such as &quot;puritanical&quot;, &quot;Islamic revivalism&quot; or &quot;activism&quot;, and &quot;radical Islam&quot;.

Lewis, a leading historian of Islam, believes that although &quot;the use of this term is established and must be accepted&quot;:

John Esposito has attacked the term for its association &quot;with political activism, extremism, fanaticism, terrorism, and anti-Americanism&quot;, saying &quot;I prefer to speak of Islamic revivalism and Islamic activism.&quot;

Khaled Abou El Fadl of UCLA, a critic of those who are called Islamic fundamentalists, also finds fault with the term because:

Eli Berman argues that &quot;radical Islam&quot; is a better term for many post-1920s movements starting with the Muslim Brotherhood, because these movements are seen as practicing &quot;unprecedented extremism&quot;, thus, they do not qualify as movements which are returning to the practice of historic fundamentals.

====Defense====
In contrast, American author Anthony J. Dennis accepts the widespread usage and relevance of the term and calls Islamic fundamentalism &quot;more than a religion today, it is a worldwide movement.&quot; He notes the intertwining of social, religious and political goals found within the movement and states that Islamic fundamentalism &quot;deserves to be seriously studied and debated from a secular perspective as a revolutionary ideology.&quot;

At least two Muslim academics, Syrian philosopher Sadiq Jalal al-Azm and Egyptian philosopher Hassan Hanafi, have defended the use of the phrase. Surveying the doctrines of the new Islamic movements, Al-Azm found them to consist of &quot;an immediate return to Islamic &#x27;basics&#x27; and &#x27;fundamentals&#x27;. ... It seems to me quite reasonable that calling these Islamic movements &#x27;Fundamentalist&#x27; (and in the strong sense of the term) is adequate, accurate, and correct.&quot;

Hassan Hanafi reached the same conclusion: &quot;It is difficult to find a more appropriate term than the one recently used in the West, &#x27;fundamentalism,&#x27; to cover the meaning of what we name Islamic awakening or revival.&quot;

===Study===
In 1988, the University of Chicago, backed by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, launched The Fundamentalism Project, devoted to researching fundamentalism in the worlds major religions, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism and Confucianism. It defined fundamentalism as &quot;approach, or set of strategies, by which beleaguered believers attempt to preserve their distinctive identity as a people or group ... by a selective retrieval of doctrines, beliefs, and practices from a sacred past.&quot; A 2013 study by Wissenschaftszentrums Berlin für Sozialforschung finds that Islamic fundamentalism is widespread among European Muslims with the majority saying religious rules are more important than civil laws and three quarters rejecting religious pluralism within Islam. A recent study shows that some European Muslims perceive Western governments as inherently hostile towards Islam as a source of identity. This perception, however, declined significantly after the emergence of ISIS, especially among young and educated European Muslims.

==Origins==
The modern Islamic fundamentalist movements have their origins in the late 19th century. According to the Arab poet Adunis, the Islamic World experienced an influx of European ideas, values and thoughts during the late nineteenth century. The thinkers in the Muslim world reacted to modernity in three major ways. Secularists like Mirza Aqa Khan Kermani, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, etc. considered Islam to be responsible for the backwardness of Muslims; gradually abandoning religion and adopted Western ideas. Meanwhile, Modernists like Muhammad Abduh in Egypt advocated reforms to reconcile with modernity; while emphasizing adherence to basic Islamic ideals. A third current; widely known as Islamic fundamentalism, pioneered by Rashid Rida across the Arab world and Abul A&#x27;ala Mawdudi (1903–1979 CE) in South Asia, asserted that Islam is relevant for all times and must reign supreme. They idealised the era of Muhammad and his companions, and sought to revive its &quot;purity&quot; and early Islamic power. For them, the economic, political and military problems of the Islamic World are due to Muslim negligence in strictly adhering to the tenets of &quot;sharia&quot;.

The trajectory of Islamic fundamentalism was marked by four phases. The first phase of proto-fundamentalism emerged during the late 19th century in wake of backlash against the Western colonial onslaught. Its main representatives were the &quot;ulema&quot; of &quot;Ahl-i Hadith&quot; movement in South Asia and religious revivalists of the Arab &quot;Salafiyya&quot; and various anti-colonial trends. The anti-colonial religious activists consisted of two factions: the reformists who kept to scriptural religious discourse, and modernists who campaigned to adopt Western ideals and institutions. The religious endeavours of the Syrian-Egyptian Salafi scholar Rashid Rida (1865–1935 CE) marks the transition from proto-fundamentalism to the second phase of Islamic fundamentalism. Rida became the first major theologian to comprehensively elucidate the foundational principles of an Islamic state in its modern iteration, and these doctrines would be readily adopted by later Islamic fundamentalists. The Wahhabi movement, an Arabian fundamentalist movement that began in the 18th century, had also gained traction and spread during the 19th and 20th centuries.

After the First World War, Rashid Rida would be highly influenced by the Hanbali puritanical and revivalist doctrines of the 13th century Hanbalite theologian Ibn Taymiyya and the Wahhabi movement; and began to ardently campaign against Western influence and modernist ideas. The ideas of Rashid Rida, who is widely regarded as the spiritual father of the &quot;Salafiyya&quot; movement, marks the rise of Islamic fundamentalist movements. He advocated fundamentalist causes through the early Islamic journal &quot;Al-Manar&quot; that operated for about thirty-five years and popularised his political theory of Islamic state after the First World War; as an alternative model against rising currents of secularism and nationalism. Influenced by Rida&#x27;s ideals that campaigned for the establishment of an Islamic state in the aftermath of the abolition of the Ottoman Caliphate, popular Islamist movements such as the Muslim Brotherhood and Jamaat-e Islami carried the banner of fundamentalism during the interwar period. The Brothers incorporated the &quot;Salafiyya&quot; message into a comprehensive political programme, while the Jamaʿat envisioned an all-out battle against Western influence and culture. The combination of religion and politics offered by these movements established contemporary Islamic fundamentalism.

The emergence of the next phase occurred in the context of the de-colonialisation era following the Second World War, during which Islamic fundamentalists were persecuted by authoritarian regimes and became radicalized. The radical new teachings were epitomized in the treatises of Egyptian Islamist scholar Sayyid Qutb, which elucidated notions such as the return of the &quot;Jahiliyya&quot; (pre-Islamic barbarity). Influenced by Qutb, a number of vanguard groups sprang up which turned to violence and terror in their struggle against &quot;apostate&quot; regimes. In Iran, a radical Shiʿa combination of Khomeini&#x27;s doctrine of &quot;wilayat-i faqih&quot; (guardianship of the jurist) and ʿAli Shariʿati&#x27;s modernist social reinterpretations of the &quot;Qur’an&quot; would form the ideological basis of the 1979 Iranian revolution.

During the Cold War following World War II, some NATO governments, particularly those of the United States and the United Kingdom, launched covert and overt campaigns to encourage and strengthen fundamentalist groups in the Middle East and southern Asia. These groups were seen as a hedge against potential expansion by the Soviet Union, and as a means to prevent the growth of nationalistic movements that were not necessarily favorable toward the interests of the Western nations. By the 1970s, the Islamists had become important allies in supporting governments, such as Egypt, which were friendly to U.S. interests. By the late 1970s, however, some fundamentalist groups had become militaristic leading to threats and changes to existing regimes. The overthrow of the Shah in Iran and rise of the Ayatollah Khomeini was one of the most significant signs of this shift. Subsequently, fundamentalist forces in Algeria caused a civil war, caused a near-civil war in Egypt, and caused the downfall of the Soviet occupation in Afghanistan.

In the contemporary era, the term &quot;fundamentalism&quot; is usually applied to denote these militant Islamist vanguards; although historians like Itzchak Weismann argue that it is more accurate to describe them as its radical offshoots. Osama b. Ladin and Al-Qaʾida belong to a fourth phase of Islamic fundamentalism, known as Salafi-jihadism, a movement that strives to move the battle against &quot;infidelity&quot; on an international scale; since the turn of the twenty-first century.

Muslim critics of Islamic fundamentalism often draw a parallel between the modern fundamentalist movement and the 7th century Khawarij sect. From their essentially political position, the Kharijites developed extreme doctrines that set them apart from both mainstream Sunni and Shia Muslims. The Kharijites were particularly noted for adopting a radical approach to Takfir, whereby they declared other Muslims to be unbelievers and therefore deemed them worthy of death.

==Goals==
===Interpretation of texts===
Islamic fundamentalists, or at least &quot;reformist&quot; fundamentalists, believe that Islam is based on the Qur&#x27;an, Hadith and Sunnah and &quot;criticize the tradition, the commentaries, popular religious practices (maraboutism, the cult of saints), deviations, and superstitions. They aim to return to the founding texts.&quot; Examples of individuals who adhere to this tendency are the 18th-century Shah Waliullah in India and Muhammad ibn Abd-al-Wahhab in the Arabian Peninsula. This view is commonly associated with Salafism today.

===Social and political ===
Along with adherents of other fundamentalist movements, Islamic fundamentalists hold the view that the problems of the world stem from secular influences.

Some scholars of Islam, such as Bassam Tibi, believe that, contrary to their own message, Islamic fundamentalists are not actually traditionalists. He refers to &quot;fatwahs&quot; which have been issued by fundamentalists such as the fatwa which states that &quot;every Muslim who pleads for the suspension of the shari&#x27;a is an apostate and can be killed. The killing of those apostates cannot be prosecuted under Islamic law because this killing is justified&quot; as going beyond, and unsupported by, the Qur&#x27;an. Tibi asserts, &quot;The command to slay reasoning Muslims is un-Islamic, an invention of Islamic fundamentalists&quot;.

==Conflicts with the secular state==
Islamic fundamentalism&#x27;s push for &quot;sharia&quot; and an Islamic state has come into conflict with conceptions of the secular, democratic state, such as the internationally supported Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Anthony J. Dennis notes that &quot;Western and Islamic visions of the state, the individual and society are not only divergent, they are often totally at odds.&quot; Among human rights fundamentalist Muslims oppose are:
* Freedom from religious police
* Equality issues between men and women (And thus fundamentalist muslims are not feminists)
* Separation of religion and state
* Freedom of speech
* Freedom of religion

==Islamic fundamentalist states==
The 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran is seen by some scholars as a success of Islamic fundamentalism. Some scholars argue that Saudi Arabia is also largely governed by fundamentalist principles (see Wahhabi movement) but Johannes J.G. Jansen disagrees, arguing that it is more akin to a traditional Muslim state, where a power separation exists between &quot;princes&quot; (&quot;umarā&quot;) and &quot;scholars&quot; (&quot;ulama&quot;). In contrast, Jansen argues that Khomeini came to power by advocating the formation of a system of Islamic government where the highest level of authority is in the hands of the &quot;ulamā&quot; (see &quot;Wilayat al Faqih&quot;).

==Islamic fundamentalist groups==

===ISIL/ISIS/Daesh===

===Caucasus Emirate===

Caucasus Emirate is a fundamentalist Islamic terrorist group residing primarily in the North Caucasus of Russia. Created from the remnants of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria (ChRI) in October 2007, it adheres to an ideology of Salafist-takfiri jihad that seeks to establish an Islamic caliphate within the North Caucasus and Volga region (primarily the republics of Tatarstan and Bashkortostan). Many of their fighters are also present in jihadist battlegrounds such as Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, and throughout Central Asia. Many plots involving Chechen and other indigenous ethnic groups of the North Caucasus have also been thwarted in Europe over the recent years.

==Human rights controversy==

Some states and movements that are perceived or claimed to be Islamic fundamentalists have been criticized for their human rights record by international organizations. The acceptance of international law on human rights has been somewhat limited even in Muslim countries that are not seen as fundamentalist. Ann Elizabeth Mayer writes that states with a predominantly Muslim population, even when they adopt laws along European lines, are influenced by Islamic rules and precepts of &quot;sharia&quot;, which cause conflict with international law on human rights. According to Mayer, features found in conflict include severe deficiencies in criminal procedure, harsh criminal penalties causing great suffering, discrimination against women and non-Muslims, and prohibition against abandoning the Islamic religion. In 1990, under Saudi leadership, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, a group representing all Muslim majority nations, adopted the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam, which substantially diverges from the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). The Cairo declaration lacks provisions for democratic principles, protection for religious freedom, freedom of association and freedom of the press, as well as equality in rights and equal protection under the law. Further it stipulates that &quot;all the rights and freedoms stipulated in this Declaration are subject to the Islamic &quot;shari&#x27;a&quot;&quot;.

The Cairo declaration followed years of limited acceptance of the Universal declaration by predominantly Muslim states. As an example, in 1984, Iran&#x27;s UN representative, Said Raja&#x27;i Khorasani, said the following amid allegations of human rights violations, &quot;[Iran] recognized no authority ... apart from Islamic law... Conventions, declarations and resolutions or decisions of international organizations, which were contrary to Islam, had no validity in the Islamic Republic of Iran... The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which represented secular understanding of the Judaeo-Christian tradition, could not be implemented by Muslims and did not accord with the system of values recognized by the Islamic Republic of Iran; this country would therefore not hesitate to violate its provisions.&quot; These departures, both theoretical and practical, have resulted in a multitude of practices and cases criticized by international human rights groups. See human rights in Iran, human rights in Saudi Arabia, and Taliban treatment of women for specific examples.

==Opinion polling==

In a 2005 Lowy Institute for International Policy Poll 57% of Australians indicated they are worried about the rise of Islamic fundamentalism. Amos N. Guiora noted that this is equivalent to the number of Australians who perceived American Foreign Policy as a threat, he further noted that not just Muslim countries have an unfavourable opinion of the United States but a large number of western countries such as: France, Germany, Great Britain and Spain and concluded that Australia was not an outlier on this regard. The Lowy Institute claimed that the result &quot;raised eyebrows&quot;.

* A &quot;New York Times&quot; poll found that 33% of Americans think that Muslim Americans were more &quot;sympathetic to terrorists than other Citizens&quot; Rik Coolsaet analysed this as indicating a high level of distrust directed at the American Muslim community. The &quot;Times&quot; did this survey during the Park51 Ground Zero Mosque incident. The &quot;Times&quot; called the findings &quot;appalling&quot; and also analysed the data as showing a very high level of distrust of Muslim Americans and robust disapproval of the Park51 Mosque proposal. &quot;The New Republic&quot; stated that it does not trust the poll carried out by the New York Times and that the figures would be higher than 33%. They further claimed that New York residents are tolerant and if the figures were 33% in New York then &quot;non-New Yorker fellow citizens are far more deeply biased and warped than the Gotham locals&quot;.

<text>Jupiter Cantab Limited was a Cambridge based home computer company. Its main product was the 1983 Forth-based Jupiter Ace.

The company was founded in 1982 by two ex-Sinclair Research staffers, Richard Altwasser and Steven Vickers. Their machine was, externally, remarkably similar to the ZX Spectrum, with a copycat rubber keyboard. It also used the same Z80 processor. The Ace&#x27;s video output was limited to monochrome like the ZX-81.

The £90 Ace was a flop in both the UK and US markets. In the US it was intended to be sold as the &quot;Ace 4000&quot;, although only 800 were ever made.
The Forth language, although considered powerful, was not as popular or accessible as the already well-established BASIC language featured in competing microcomputers. Although the Ace&#x27;s price at £89.95 when the successor to Sinclair&#x27;s ZX80, the ZX81, was £39.95 was more likely the primary reason for slow sales.

The company went bankrupt in November 1983 and its assets were sold to Boldfield Computing Ltd in 1984. The remaining hardware was sold-off into 1985. Boldfield Computing Ltd also commissioned some software for it, including various games, database, and spread sheet software. Documentation to this exists and is held by the current owners of the brand.

The sale of Boldfield’s IT solution business in 2006, excluded the rights to the Jupiter Ace IP and brand, but this was later sold to Andrews UK Limited in 2015.

<doc id="178788" wikidata="Q1318451" url="?curid=178788" title="Transfusion medicine">
<text>Transfusion medicine (or transfusiology) is the branch of medicine that encompasses all aspects of the transfusion of blood and blood components including aspects related to hemovigilance. It includes issues of blood donation, immunohematology and other laboratory testing for transfusion-transmitted diseases, management and monitoring of clinical transfusion practices, patient blood management, therapeutic apheresis, stem cell collections, cellular therapy, and coagulation. Laboratory management and understanding of state and federal regulations related to blood products are also a large part of the field.

==Overview==
In most countries, immunohematology and transfusion medicine specialists provide expert opinion on massive transfusions, difficult/incompatible transfusions and rational use of specialised blood product therapy like irradiated blood/leukodepleted/washed blood products.

The blood donor center is the facility that collects blood components from screened blood donors, either whole blood or separate components such as plasma or platelets only via apheresis. These blood components are then transported to a central location for processing such as fractionation, testing and redistribution. The testing includes determining blood type and testing for infectious diseases. Whole blood is fractionated into red blood cells, platelets and plasma whilst plasma can be further refined into separate components such as albumin, clotting factor concentrates and immunoglobulin.

The blood bank is the section of the clinical laboratory where laboratory scientists store and distribute blood components. Both areas are typically overseen by a specialist in transfusion medicine. Transfusion medicine was earlier a branch of clinical pathology, however the field has now expanded into a clinical, hospital-based specialty. The practice of transfusion medicine involves both laboratory and clinical aspects of transfusion as communication between blood bank and patients, treating specialists and other medical staff is vital in situations such as massive transfusions or transfusion reactions.

To ensure the safety of blood components, regimented procedures and quality assurance systems must be in place covering all aspects of the transfusion chain, from donation to transfusion outcomes. Within hospitals, transfusion committees are established to ensure safe hospital transfusion practice such as compliance with standards and guidelines, reviewing transfusion reactions and management of blood supply. These multidisciplinary committees are composed of transfusion medicine specialists, transfusion nurses, laboratory scientists, clinicians and staff from hospital management and the quality team.

==History==
In 1628, English physician William Harvey discovered that blood circulates around the body. Soon thereafter, the first blood transfusion was attempted. In 1665 another English doctor Richard Lower successfully used blood transfusion between dogs to keep them alive.

Karl Landsteiner is recognized as the father of transfusion medicine. Landsteiner is credited with the first classification of human blood into the four types (A, B, AB, O) of the ABO blood group system.

==National differences and how to specialise==
Australia

In Australia, transfusion medicine is a sub-specialty of haematology. Training in transfusion medicine is covered by the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia (RCPA).

Australia has national blood services operated by the Australian Red Cross Blood Service. There are a series of guidelines and standards relevant to the laboratory released by the National Association of Testing Authorities, Australia (NATA), Australian and New Zealand Society of Blood Transfusion (ANZSBT) and RCPA. Similarly, there are a series of clinical practice, patient blood management guidelines by the National Blood Authority.

In Australia, the Serious Transfusion Incident Reporting (STIR) system is in place to capture serious transfusion incidents and near-miss incidents.

;Denmark

In Denmark, the subject is covered by the specialty, &quot;Clinical Immunology&quot;.

;Germany
In Germany, transfusion medicine is an independent specialty. Physicians complete a three-year residency in transfusion medicine and two years in another relevant clinical settings like internal medicine or surgery.

;India

In India, Immunohematology and Transfusion Medicine is a medical post graduate specialty (MD) recognized by Medical Council of India since 2009.

;Malaysia

Physicians completing their internship may pursue a four-year Master of Medicine (Transfusion Medicine) programme to specialize in transfusion medicine in Malaysia. They are eligible for registration with National Specialist Registry as transfusion medicine specialists after completion of gazettement upon graduation. Transfusion medicine specialists in Malaysia may further their sub-specialty training in the field of immunohaematology, cord blood, patient blood management, cellular therapy, and regenerative medicine.

;Norway

In Norway, the subject is covered by the specialty, &quot;Immunology and Transfusion medicine&quot;

;United Kingdom

In the United Kingdom, transfusion medicine is a sub-speciality of hematology.

Serious Hazards of Transfusion (SHOT) collects and analyses reports of adverse events related to transfusion, aiming to improve patient safety. Its reports have led to wider training for medical staff in the UK and a central reporting scheme to allow errors to be reported.

There is the Better Blood Continuing Education Programme, which is organised by the EUB which is part of the SNBTS. The EUB consists of many specialist healthcare professionals. The programme&#x27;s aim is to improve transfusion medicine practise. The programme is reviewed each annually in January.

In the UK, there are restrictions in place to decrease the risk of the transmission of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease.

;United States

Physicians from a wide range of backgrounds, including pathology, internal medicine, anesthesiology and pediatrics, are eligible for board certification in Transfusion Medicine following a 1–2 year fellowship. It is a board-certified sub-specialty recognized by the American Board of Pathology. These specialists are often considered consultants for physicians who require expert advice on the subjects listed above. Transfusiology is not a recognized term in the US.

<doc id="178789" wikidata="Q1384383" url="?curid=178789" title="Experimental Aircraft Association">
<text>The Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) is an international organization of aviation enthusiasts based in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. Since its inception, it has grown internationally with over 300,000 members and nearly 1,000 chapters worldwide. It hosts the largest aviation gathering of its kind in the world, EAA AirVenture Oshkosh.

==History==
The EAA was founded in 1953 by veteran aviator Paul Poberezny along with other aviation enthusiasts. The organization began as more or less a flying club. Poberezny explains the nature of the organization&#x27;s name, &quot;Because the planes we flew were modified or built from scratch, they were required to display an EXPERIMENTAL placard where it could be seen on the door or cockpit, so it was quite natural that we call ourselves the &quot;Experimental Aircraft Association&quot;. The EAA was incorporated in Wisconsin on 22 March 1955. Homebuilding is still a large part of EAA, but the organization has grown over the years to include almost every aspect of aviation and aeronautics.

EAA&#x27;s first location was in the basement of Poberezny&#x27;s Hales Corners, Wisconsin home. In the early 1960s, the association&#x27;s first headquarters was built in the Milwaukee suburb of Franklin. That was the headquarters for the organization until 1983, when EAA combined its headquarters and fly-in site in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. The EAA Aviation Center also includes the EAA Aviation Museum, with more than 200 aircraft, approximately 130 of which are on display at any given time.

In 1953, the Experimental Aircraft Association released a two-page newsletter named &quot;The Experimenter&quot;. The newsletter was written and published by founding members Paul and Audrey Poberezny along with other volunteers. The newsletter transitioned to a magazine format and was renamed &quot;Sport Aviation&quot; and became a membership benefit. The &quot;Experimenter&quot; name lives on, however, in an online magazine specifically for amateur-built and light plane enthusiasts that debuted in 2012. It was folded into the monthly Sport Aviation print magazine in 2015.

In 2010, the United States&#x27; national aeromodeling organization, the Academy of Model Aeronautics, was involved in negotiations with the EAA homebuilt aviation organization, that resulted in a &quot;memorandum of understanding&quot; that is intended to encourage collaboration between the two American-based sport aviation organizations, in developing, in the words of the AMA&#x27;s then-President Dave Mathewson, &quot;the creation of new concepts that will promote aviation, both full-scale and modeling, as a perfect family recreational and educational activity&quot;. This link with the AMA has further strengthened in the face of unprecedented FAA concern of aeromodeling as a form of UAS activity they now have a reason to regulate, and are now tasked with regulating - the EAA, in late November 2019, stated that &quot;We see model aviation as an important pathway to manned flight,&quot; adding that &quot;Our goal in this risk assessment process is to represent the safety concerns of our members while allowing the highest degree of freedom for legacy model aircraft, which have flown alongside us in the airspace for decades.&quot;

In 2015, the EAA and EAA Young Eagles were inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.

== Museum ==


First opened in 1983 and located adjacent to EAA&#x27;s headquarters in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, the EAA Aviation Museum is an extensive collection of aircraft and aviation displays. The Museum is home to EAA&#x27;s collection of more than 200 aircraft, of which more than 90 are on display inside the museum at any time. The museum&#x27;s Pioneer Airport is a re-creation of a vintage aerodrome, with more than 40 additional airplanes on display. From May through mid-October (daily Memorial Day through Labor Day), flights are offered in vintage aircraft.

==Programs and activities==

=== Technical Counselor program ===
To help ensure that all amateur-built aircraft are well-constructed, safe aircraft, the EAA organizes a group of volunteers, known as Technical Counselors, who will visit the construction project to identify any areas of concern. Technical Counselors are EAA members who volunteer their time and who have met at least one of the following criteria:

* Have built an experimental category aircraft
* Have restored an antique/classic aircraft
* Hold an A&amp;P, IA, DAR, DER or Aerospace Engineer rating in the United States, an equivalent international rating or have the qualifications for those ratings.

There is no charge for this on-site review. The program is strictly voluntary. The recommendations of the Technical Counselor are advisory only. The EAA recommends a minimum of three Technical Counselor visits over the course of construction.

=== Flight Advisor program ===
The Flight Advisor Program is designed to increase homebuilt aircraft safety by developing a corps of volunteers who have demonstrated expertise in specific areas of flying and making them available to EAA members who may be preparing to fly an unfamiliar aircraft. A Flight Advisor helps the pilot conduct a self-evaluation as well as evaluate the flying characteristics of the aircraft. Pilots use that evaluation to decide whether they are capable of flying that airplane. If not capable, the Flight Advisor explains where and how the pilot can get the proper instruction, or alternatively find someone to make the initial flights.

Under the EAA Flight Advisor Program, the Advisor does not fly or decide whether or not the pilot is capable of flying the airplane to be tested. The Advisor provides the pilot with the pros and cons as they relate to this specific combination of pilot and airplane. The pilot makes the final decision on how to proceed with the flight testing program.

===EAA AirVenture Oshkosh===

Each summer EAA presents the largest annual general aviation event in the world, EAA AirVenture Oshkosh, also commonly known as the &quot;Oshkosh Airshow&quot;. During the event, the city&#x27;s airport, Wittman Regional Airport, named after Steve Wittman, is the busiest airport in the world (in terms of traffic movements). The week-long event annually attracts around 10,000-12,000 planes and a total attendance of more than 500,000. The event also attracts more than 800 exhibitors, hosts nearly 1,000 forums, seminars and workshops, and welcomes more than 700 journalists each year.

The annual fly-in was first held in 1953 at what is now Timmerman Field in Milwaukee. In 1959, the growing event moved to the Rockford, Illinois airport. Attendance at the fly-in continued to grow until the Rockford airport (now Chicago Rockford International Airport) was too small to accommodate the crowds, and so it was moved to Oshkosh in 1970. A study conducted in 2008 by the University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh determined that the 500,000 annual fly-in attendance generates $110 million of tourist income for the three counties surrounding the airport. In 2017, that economic impact was estimated at over $170 million and a total attendance of nearly 600,000 people.

===Young Eagles===

The EAA also sponsors the Young Eagles program, which was started in 1992 by Tom Poberezny and others, with the aim of giving one million children an airplane ride by 17 December 2003, the Centennial of Flight (&quot;see Wright brothers and Wright Flyer&quot;). The program reached that goal, and has continued, with more than 2 million young people flown as of July 2016 and more introduced to and educated around the benefits of general aviation.

The Young Eagles program has been overseen by a series of nationally famous chairmen:
* Cliff Robertson - founding chairman, film and stage actor (1992–1994)
* Chuck Yeager - USAF General and first man to fly faster than the speed of sound (1994–2004)
* Harrison Ford - film and stage actor (2004–2009)
* Chesley Sullenberger and Jeffrey B. Skiles - pilots of US Airways Flight 1549 (2009–2013)
* Sean D. Tucker - aerobatic pilot (2013–present)
* Jimmy Graham - NFL tight end (2018–present)

===Sun &#x27;N Fun Airshow===

The other major yearly airshow attended by EAA members and staff is Sun &#x27;n Fun, held every April in Lakeland, Florida. Sun &#x27;n Fun has been an independent organization from the EAA since its first show in 1975, although the event has always involved significant EAA participation.
The two organizations signed an agreement in January 1989 recognizing their independence. On 30 March 2005 Sun &#x27;n Fun issued a press release affirming the independence of the two organizations but assuring the aviation public that they would continue to work together. As such Sun &#x27;n Fun remains a show with participation from EAA chapters and a presence from the national EAA staff, but it is not an EAA event.

==Organizational structure==
The organization is overseen by a chairman, a president, a CEO and a board of directors. Paul Poberezny assumed the duties of president and CEO at the 1953 founding. In 1989 he assumed the (newly created) position of chairman of the board, and his son, aerobatic pilot Tom Poberezny, became president and CEO. In March 2009, Paul Poberezny resigned, and the board voted to elevate Tom Poberezny to chairman of the board. At AirVenture 2010, it was announced that businessman Rod Hightower would succeed Tom Poberezny as president of the organization, effective September 2010.

Hightower resigned on 22 October 2012 &quot;effective immediately&quot;, directly after a board of directors meeting during which former Cessna chairman, president and CEO Jack J. Pelton was elected chairman. Hightower indicated he was resigning to spend more time with his family and would not relocate from St. Louis to Oshkosh. Pelton was named acting CEO and will oversee the hiring process for Hightower&#x27;s permanent replacement. In response to questions about Hightower&#x27;s resignation, Mac McClellan, EAA vice president of publications, stated that it was due to Hightower failing to relocate himself from his home in St. Louis to EAA headquarters in Oshkosh, as the board had expected him to. McClellan said, &quot;I know there&#x27;s all kinds of complaints, but that&#x27;s not it. [The residency] was the unsolvable requirement. The board sees the president/CEO living in the Fox Valley as essential to the mission.&quot;

Dec 2022 The EAA Board of Directors welcomed Shelly deZevallos, Ed. D., as a Class III Director.

Local chapters may be formed whenever ten or more EAA members reside in a given area.

Chapters are encouraged to meet monthly. The first chapter meeting occurred at Flabob Airport in California, with noted aircraft designer and builder Ray Stits presiding.

==EAA Freedom of Flight Award==
In addition to the Dr. August Raspet Memorial Award, EAA also presents the Freedom of Flight Award, which the organization considers its highest honor. The award is &quot;bestowed annually to recognize contributions to aviation who closely mirror the integrity, entrepreneurship, and innovativeness of EAA members.&quot;

<text>Arqa (; ) is a Lebanese village near Miniara in Akkar Governorate, Lebanon, 22 km northeast of Tripoli, near the coast.

The town was a notable city-state during the Iron Age. The city of &quot;Irqata&quot; sent 10,000 soldiers to the coalition against the Assyrian king in the Battle of Qarqar. The former bishopric became a double Catholic titular see (Latin and Maronite). The Roman Emperor Alexander Severus was born there. It is significant for the [[Tell (archaeology)|Tell]] Arqa, an archaeological site that goes back to Neolithic times, and during the Crusades there was a strategically significant castle.

==Names==
It is mentioned in Antiquity in the Amarna letters of Egypt-(as &quot;Irqata&quot;), as well as in Assyrian documents.

The Roman town was named Caesarea-ad-Libanum (of Lebanon/Phoenicia) or Arca Caesarea.

==History==
===Early Bronze===
In the Early Bronze IV, the Akkar Plain had three major sites in Tell Arqa, Tell Kazel, and Tell Jamous. The cultural focus had been towards the south and southern Levant, but now changed with more influence from Inner Syria and the use of copper.
===Middle Bronze===
In the MB I the Akkar Plain still saw smaller settlements being added near Tell Arqa and the region reach its highest population density in MB II.
===Late Bronze===
====Amarna Period &quot;Irqata&quot; (c. 1350 BC)====

Arqa has the distinction of being a city-state that wrote one of the 382 Amarna letters to the Pharaoh of Ancient Egypt.

The city-state Irqata was the 3rd city of the Rib-Hadda letters, (68 letters), that were the last hold-outs against the (H)Apiru invasion. Sumur(u)-(Zemar) was the 2nd hold-out city besides Rib-Hadda&#x27;s Byblos, (named Gubla). Eventually, the king of Irqata, Aduna was killed along with other city kings, and also the &#x27;mayor&#x27; of Gubla, Rib-Hadda. Rib-Hadda&#x27;s brother, Ili-Rapih, became the successor mayor of Gubla, and Gubla never fell to the Hapiru.

During Rib-Hadda&#x27;s lengthy opposition to the Habiru, even the city-state of Irqata and its elders, wrote to the Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaten for assistance. (EA 100, EA for el Amarna).

The letter is entitled: &quot;The city of Irqata to the king&quot;.

:This tablet-(i.e. tablet letter) is a tablet from Irqata. To the King, our Lord: Message from Irqata and its el[d]ers. We fall at the feet of the king, our lord, 7 times and 7 times. To our lord, the Sun: Message from Irqata. May the heart of the king, (our) lord, know that we guard Irqata for him.
:When the [ki]ng, our lord, sent D[UMU]-Bi-ha-a, he said to [u]s, &quot;Message of the king: &quot;Guard Irqata&quot;! &quot; The sons of the traitor to the king seek our harm; Irqata see[ks] loyalty to the king. As to [ silver ] having been given to S[u]baru al[ong with] horses and cha[riots], may you know the mind of Irqata. When a tablet from the king arrived (saying) to ra[id] the land that the &#x27;A[piru] had taken [from] the king,&#x27;they wa[ged] war with us against the enemy of our lord, the man whom you pla[ced] over us. Truly—we are guarding the l[and]. May the king, our lord, heed the words of his loyal servants.
:May he grant a gift to his servant(s) so our enemies will see this and eat dirt. May the breath of the king not depart from us. We shall keep the city gate barred until the breath of the king reaches us. Severe is the war against us—terribly! terribly! -EA 100, lines 1-44 (complete)
===Hellenistic and Roman period===

After the death of Alexander the Great Arca came under the control first of the Lagids then of the Seleucids. When the Romans gained control over this part of western Asia, they entrusted Arca as a client tetrarchy or vassal principality to a certain Sohaimos, who died in AD 48 or 49. It was then incorporated in the Roman province of Syria, but was soon entrusted to Herod Agrippa II. Pliny the Elder counts it among the tetrarchies of Syria. It was at this time that its name was changed to Caesarea, distinguished from other cities of that name by being called Caesarea ad Libanum or Arca Caesarea. Under Septimius Severus (193–211) it was made part of the province of Syria Phoenicia and so became known as Arca in Phoenicia. Under his son Caracalla (198–217) it became a &quot;colonia&quot; and in 208 Alexander Severus was born at Arca during a stay of his parents there.
===Crusades period===
At the time of the First Crusade, Arca became an important strategic point of control over the roads from Tripoli to Tartus and Homs. Raymond of Toulouse unsuccessfully besieged it for three months in 1099. In 1108, his nephew William II Jordan conquered it and it became part of the County of Tripoli. It resisted an attack by Nur ad-Din, atabeg of Aleppo, in 1167 and another in 1171.

It finally fell to Muslim forces of the Sultan Baibars in 1265 or 1266. When Tripoli itself fell in 1289 to the army of Sultan Qalawun and was razed to the ground, Arca lost its strategic importance and thereafter is mentioned only in ecclesiastical chronicles.
===Later period===
In 1838, Eli Smith noted the village, whose inhabitants were Greek Orthodox, located west of esh-Sheikh Mohammed.

==Demographics==
In 2014, Muslims made up 100% of registered voters in Arqa, all of them being Sunni Muslims.

==Ecclesiastical history==
Arca in Phoenicia became the seat of a Christian bishop in the Roman province of Phoenicia Prima, a suffragan of the capital&#x27;s metropolitan see of Tyre.
Of its bishops, Lucianus professed the faith of the First Council of Nicaea at a synod held in Antioch in 363, Alexander was at the First Council of Constantinople in 381, Reverentius became archbishop of Tyre, Marcellinus was a participant at the Council of Ephesus in 431, Epiphanius took part in a synod at Antioch in 448, and Heraclitus participated in the Council of Chalcedon in 451 and was a signatory of the letter that the bishops of the province of Syria Phoenicia sent in 458 to Byzantine Emperor Leo I the Thracian to protest about the murder of Proterius of Alexandria.

No longer a residential bishopric, Arca in Phoenicia is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see, in two traditions: Latin and Maronite (Eastern Catholic, Antiochian Rite in Syriac).

<text>Sarah Hrdy (née Blaffer; born July 11, 1946) is an American anthropologist and primatologist who has made major contributions to evolutionary psychology and sociobiology. She is considered &quot;a highly recognized pioneer in modernizing our understanding
of the evolutionary basis of female behavior in both nonhuman and human primates&quot;. In 2013, Hrdy received a Lifetime Career Award for Distinguished Scientific Contribution from the Human Behavior and Evolution Society.

Hrdy is a Professor Emerita of the Department of Anthropology at the University of California, Davis. She has also been an Associate at the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University. She has been selected as one of the 21 &quot;Leaders in Animal Behavior&quot; (2009). In acknowledgment of her achievements, &quot;Discover&quot; magazine recognized her in 2002 as one of the 50 most important women in science.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Sarah Blaffer was born on July 11, 1946, in Dallas, Texas. She was a granddaughter of Sarah Campbell Blaffer and Robert Lee Blaffer, a co-founder of Humble Oil. She was raised in Houston and attended St. John&#x27;s School before enrolling in St. Timothy&#x27;s School in Stevenson, Maryland, graduating in 1964.

===Education===
At age 18, Blaffer enrolled in her mother&#x27;s alma mater, Wellesley College in Massachusetts. At the end of her sophomore year, she transferred to Radcliffe College, then the women&#x27;s part of Harvard, in order to study under the great Mayanist Evon Vogt.

Majoring in anthropology there her undergraduate honors thesis was on the Maya demon H&#x27;ik&#x27;al published as her first book, &quot;The Black-man of Zinacantan&quot;, published in 1972.
She was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, and graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot; from Radcliffe in 1969 with a BA.

Interested in making public health films for people in developing countries, Hrdy took film-making courses at Stanford, but was disappointed with them. Instead she was inspired by a Stanford lecture of Paul Ehrlich&#x27;s about overpopulation. His lecture reminded her of something a Harvard professor, Irven DeVore, had said about a species of Indian monkey called langurs among whom males, supposedly because they were crowded, killed infants.

Hrdy changed course in mid-year and entered Harvard as a graduate student in 1970 to study primate behavior so she could go to India and find out why these male Hanuman langurs were killing infants. She worked under the supervision of anthropology professor Irven DeVore and evolutionary biologist Robert L. Trivers and E. O. Wilson earning a Ph.D. in Anthropology in 1975.

===Family===
Sarah Blaffer met Daniel Hrdy at Harvard. He accompanied her on early visits to Mount Abu, and they married in 1972 in Kathmandu. They have three children: Katrinka (born 1977); Sasha (born 1982), a week before Hrdy was scheduled to present a paper at Cornell University; and Niko (born 1986). Sarah Blaffer Hrdy now lives with her husband in northern California, where they are engaged in walnut farming and habitat restoration at Citrona Farms.

==Career==
Hrdy alternated research work in India with time at Harvard until 1979. Between 1974 and 1984, she taught for brief periods at University of Massachusetts, Boston; Harvard and Rice University, and worked as a volunteer at her daughter&#x27;s daycare center until 1984 when she joined the University of California at Davis as a professor of anthropology. Hrdy retired in 1996, becoming a professor emerita of anthropology at UC Davis, where she continues to be involved with the Animal Behavior Graduate Group.

==Research==

===&quot;The Langurs of Abu&quot;===
Sarah Hrdy first heard of langurs during an undergraduate primate behavior class taught by anthropologist Irven DeVore in 1968. DeVore commented on the relationship between crowding and the killing of infants in langur colonies. After graduation, Hrdy returned to Harvard for graduate studies, with the goal of better understanding the phenomenon of infanticide in primates. Working under the supervision of DeVore, Trivers and Wilson provided Hrdy with an introduction to the emerging science of sociobiology—which crystallized at Harvard in the early 1970s. Sociobiology&#x27;s comparative evolutionary perspective would shape Hrdy&#x27;s work for years to come.

Although Hrdy had initially gone to Mount Abu to explore the hypothesis that crowding was responsible for infanticide, soon she realized her starting hypothesis was wrong. Infants were only attacked when males entered the breeding system from outside it. This led her to what she termed the sexual selection hypothesis for explaining infanticide. Males are eliminating unweaned infants sired by rival males and in doing so inducing the mother to resume cycling and ovulate again sooner than had she continued to lactate. Turnover in her langur troupes occurred roughly on average every 27 months leaving the usurping male only a brief window of opportunity to breed and pass on his genes. If the females are nursing infants, it is likely that they will not ovulate for another year. Killing their dependent infants rendered females fertile again sooner than they otherwise would be.

Female choice is subverted, as females are put under pressure to ovulate and are forced to breed with the infanticidal males. This is where the idea of sexual counter-strategies comes into play. Hrdy hypothesized that by mating with a male who might take over her troupe ahead of time, they protect their infants subsequently born since males were unlikely to kill an infant if there was a chance that it might be their own, a behavior that would be rapidly selected against.

While infanticide by males has since been reported across the primate order in prosimians, New and Old World monkeys, and ape, Hrdy found no evidence to suggest a &#x27;genetic imperative&#x27; for infanticide in humans.

In 1975, Hrdy was awarded her PhD for her research on langurs. In 1977 it was published in her second book, &quot;The Langurs of Abu: Female and Male Strategies of Reproduction&quot;. However her proposal that infanticide might be an evolved reproductive strategy in primates proved highly controversial, running counter to the then current conviction that primates act for the good of the group rather than to promote the reproductive interests of any individual. Nevertheless, her findings have since been replicated in many animals and her explanations are widely accepted. Even Trivers, who once dismissed her ideas about female sexual solicitations of multiple males, admits that her theory regarding female counter strategies to infanticide have &quot;worn well.&quot;

===&quot;The Woman That Never Evolved&quot;===
Hrdy&#x27;s third book came out in 1981: &quot;The Woman That Never Evolved&quot;. She begins chapter one with a sentence indicating that the results of her work suggest female agency should be given a lot more credit than previously assumed. &quot;Biology, it is sometimes thought, has worked against women.&quot; Here, Hrdy expands upon female reproductive strategies. The book was selected as one of &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; Notable Books of 1981.

In 1984, Hrdy co-edited &quot;Infanticide: Comparative and Evolutionary Perspectives&quot;. It was selected as a 1984–1985 &quot;Outstanding Academic Book&quot; by &quot;Choice&quot;, the journal of the Association of College and Research Libraries.

===&quot;Mother Nature&quot;===
In 1999, Hrdy published &quot;Mother Nature: A history of mothers, infants, and natural selection&quot;. She examines &quot;human mothers and infants in a broader comparative and evolutionary framework,&quot; informing and forming views of mother-infant interdependence from a sociobiological viewpoint.

In it she described the trade-offs between subsistence and reproduction that mothers have to juggle, sometimes leading to difficult maternal investment &quot;decisions&quot;. Rather than assuming automatic maternal responses, Hrdy views &quot;maternal instinct&quot; as a process unfolding in line with local conditions and cues from the infant. She stresses that an ape producing such costly offspring as humans could not have evolved unless mothers had had help from others, and had been what sociobiologists term cooperative breeders.

Humans evolved to rely on assistance from group members other than the mother, using the term &quot;allomother&quot; she first used in her 1975 PhD thesis describing infant-sharing in langurs (from the Greek &quot;allo&quot; for &quot;other than&quot;) to refer to any female or male other than the mother who helps to care for an infant. In the human case allomothers are often a father, grandparents, or older siblings, as well as genetically unrelated helpers, including nannies, and child care groups, who help care for and provision infants, freeing the mother to meet her own needs and in the case of early humans, breed again sooner.

===&quot;Mothers and Others: The evolutionary origins of mutual understanding&quot;===
In &quot;Mother Nature&quot; Hrdy argued that apes with the life history attributes of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; could not have evolved unless alloparents in addition to parents had helped to care for and provision offspring, &quot;the Cooperative Breeding Hypothesis&quot;.

In 2009 in &quot;Mothers and Others&quot;, Hrdy explored cognitive and emotional implications for infants growing up in what was (for an ape) a novel developmental context. Instead of relying on the single-minded dedication of their mothers, youngsters had to monitor and engage multiple caretakers as well. Other apes possess cognitive wiring for rudimentary Theory of Mind, but with cooperative rearing, relevant potentials for mentalizing would have become more fully expressed, and thus rendered more visible to natural selection. Over generations, those youngsters better at inter-subjective engagement would have been best cared for and fed, leading to directional Darwinian selection favoring peculiarly human capacities for intersubjective engagement.

In 2014, &quot;Mothers and Others&quot;, together with earlier work, earned Hrdy the National Academy&#x27;s Award for Scientific Reviewing in honor of her &quot;insightful and visionary synthesis of a broad range of data and concepts from across the social and biological sciences to illuminate the importance of biosocial processes among mothers, infants, and other social actors in forming the evolutionary crucible of human societies.&quot;

Because of her research on parenting, Hrdy is a strong advocate for making affordable child care a priority.

==Philanthropy==
Together with Daniel Hrdy, Sarah Hrdy has endowed fellowships at the Radcliffe Institute as well as The Sarah and Daniel Hrdy Visiting Fellowship in Conservation Biology in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University, followed in 2021 by endowment of the Daniel and Sarah Hrdy Fund for University of California Cooperative Extension research in sustainable agriculture and habitat restoration.

<doc id="178794" wikidata="Q15204126" url="?curid=178794" title="Braehead">
<text>Braehead (, Gaelic: &quot;Ceann a&#x27; Bhruthaich&quot;) is a commercial development located at the former site of Braehead Power Station in Renfrew on the south bank of the River Clyde in Renfrew, Renfrewshire. It is particularly notable for its large shopping centre, arena and leisure facilities.

The area is known for its shopping centre of the same name, which was rebranded as Intu Braehead in 2013 and kept that name until 2020. The rebranding was done as part of a corporate rebranding exercise by Capital Shopping Centres plc, which itself was renamed as Intu Properties PLC.

==King&#x27;s Inch==
Until at least the 18th century, the site was an island in the River Clyde known as King&#x27;s Inch (a name that is still reflected in the road that divides the site).

The initial castle at Renfrew was constructed on King&#x27;s Inch in the 12th century by Walter Fitz-Alan, High Steward of Scotland.however It was deserted in the 13th century and substituted by a stone castle in what currently stands as the centre of Renfrew. By the latter portion of the 15th century, Sir John Ross was obtained the lands of Inch along with the remains of this castle, where he erected a three-storey castle known as the Inch Castle.

In 1769, the King&#x27;s Inch was purchased by Glasgow tobacco merchant Alexander Speirs, who demolished Inch Castle in order to build a country mansion, Elderslie House. Completed in 1782 (demolished in 1924), Elderslie House was designed by Robert Adam.

==Braehead power station==

The power station was built after World War II, originally coal-fired but later converted to oil to reduce emissions. It was located on the north side of King&#x27;s Inch Road, and remained operational into the 1980s, undergoing demolition in the 1990s.

==The Braehead explosion==
On 4 January 1977, a serious fire and explosion occurred at a warehouse in the Braehead Container Clearance Depot, adjacent to the Power Station. The fire was started accidentally by three boys who had lit a fire to warm themselves at a den that they had made, during the New Year holiday, from cardboard cartons stacked beside the warehouse. The fire detonated 70 tonnes of sodium chlorate weedkiller stored in the warehouse, producing a blast estimated by HM Inspectorate of Explosives as being equivalent to up to 820 kg of TNT.

About 200 stores and homes in Renfrew and Clydebank had their windows shattered by the explosion, which was heard throughout the entire Greater Glasgow region and sent flying debris as far as 2.8 kilometres away. The explosion is estimated to have cost £6 million in damage. In large part due to the National Bank Holiday in observance of Hogmanay celebrations, there were no deaths. Twelve people required treatment for shock and minor injuries.

==Renfrew Riverside redevelopment==
Braehead forms part of the Renfrew Riverside redevelopment area, a part of the wider Clyde Waterfront Regeneration project. The Braehead area includes:
*an indoor shopping centre;
*ice skating / curling facilities;
*Krispy Kreme doughnuts;
*The Braehead Arena - along with extensive covered and open-air car parking);
*A Xsite (formerly Xscape and Soar) adventure complex;
*A small business park.

==Braehead shopping centre==

The shopping centre opened in September 1999 and comprises of retail and leisure floorspace. The centre has 110 shops in the main covered mall, and a further 10 in a retail park of larger stores. Braehead is also home to Glasgow&#x27;s IKEA store, which opened in September 2001 and sits near the King George V Dock. At , it is the largest IKEA store in Scotland and at the time of opening was the largest in the United Kingdom. Since opening, the centre has proved popular with consumers, and it has even been blamed for a downturn in the fortunes of shops in nearby Paisley, Govan and Renfrew.

Sited within the same building as the shopping centre is the Braehead Arena and other facilities including an ice rink. In 2000, its curling facilities hosted the World Championships, and in 2005 they were used as training facilities when the Women&#x27;s World Championships were being held in Paisley.

On 7 October 2011, a father was stopped by security and questioned by police under anti-terror legislation after photographing his daughter at an ice-cream stall. This resulted in a social media backlash and statements from both Braehead&#x27;s management and Strathclyde Police.

As of January 2013, a planning application was submitted to Renfrewshire Council for &#x27;permission in principle&#x27; to build a new mixed-use development at the centre.

In 2018, Braehead was named the top Scottish shopping centre in a GlobalData report.

Following Intu Properties plc entering administration in June 2020, a subsidiary of the company called Intu SGS received funding to take full control of the centre along with Lakeside, Victoria Centre and Intu Watford. The transfer from Intu to Intu SGS is expected to take place by the end of 2020, and will involve Global Mutual becoming asset manager of the centres and Savills serving as property manager.

In 2020, it was reported that Braehead Shopping Centre was trialling the use of full-body security scanners at the entrance.

==Clydebuilt, Braehead==
From September 1999 to October 2010, the Scottish Maritime Museum operated Clydebuilt at Braehead, a museum which explored the history of the Clyde shipbuilding industry and the industrial development of Glasgow and the River Clyde.

The museum had been built by and was subsidised by the owners of the shopping centre, but after they withdrew support the museum became financially unviable and Scottish Maritime Museum were forced to close it and transfer its exhibits to their other sites at Irvine and Dumbarton.

The building is now occupied by Krispy Kreme.

==Xsite Braehead==
Xsite Braehead (formerly known as Intu Braehead Soar and Xscape Braehead) () began construction in November 2004 and was opened in March 2006 with its main use to teach people how to ski or snowboard. The building has a conventional shape, with the ski slope accommodated by a sloped cuboid structure projecting out the roof. The complex features a variety of entertainment activities, including an indoor ski slope, rock climbing, an Odeon, bowling, RoboCoaster, mini golf and laser tag, as well as a variety of shops, restaurants, and bars.

The Snow Factor indoor snow slope featured a 168 m (551 ft) main slope with an additional dedicated beginners&#x27; area for ski and snowboard lessons. On the main slope, two Poma button lifts gave a drag tow to the top and could be exited either at the halfway point on the slope or at the top. Rope tows were used on the beginners slope.

In December 2011, SNO! Zone Braehead was acquired by the Ice Factor Group and renamed Snow Factor. Snow Factor closed permanently in 2023 due to rising costs and the age of the facility.

In March 2006, weeks before the complex was scheduled to open, the roof of screen seven of the Odeon fell in and required extensive re-building.
The mini-golf (which is housed below the cinema) opened in July 2006. The cinema opened on 19 October 2007, 18 months later than planned. &quot;Stardust&quot; was the first film shown. The cinema is fitted with RealD 3D (also known as Disney Digital 3-D technology) in screen 7, and is also capable of showing IMAX films. The cinema held the Scottish Pink Carpet Premiere of Universal Pictures film &quot;Wild Child&quot; on 30 July 2008. Both stars of the film, Emma Roberts and Alex Pettyfer, attended.

In March 2018, an 18-metre (59 ft) high slide, known as The Big Slide, opened to the general public. It is the tallest indoor slide in the UK. 

It has been announced that the ski slope structure is to being removed by the owners to create a multi level indoor ekarting track that is scheduled to open in 2025. at over 1,000m the track will be one of the largest indoor tracks in the world.

==Further development==
To the west of Braehead and adjacent to the town of Renfrew is the Renfrew Riverside area. Between the residential area and the shopping centre an Xscape complex (now named Xsite), providing an indoor ski slope and other entertainments and leisure facilities opened in early 2006.

To the south of the shopping centre is a small development called Braehead Business Park.

==Transport==
Braehead can be reached from Junctions 25a (westbound) and 26 (eastbound) of the M8 motorway, and has extensive public transport connections including its own bus station. Buses run from many areas linking Braehead to Largs, Greenock, Paisley, Glasgow, Erskine and Johnstone. The &quot;Pride of the Clyde&quot; ferry service ran from Glasgow City Centre to Braehead&#x27;s pier down the River Clyde regularly until October 2007.

A road bridge between Renfrew and Yoker on the north bank of the Clyde was constructed in 2024, providing easier access to Braehead for residents in that sector of the city.

==Boundary dispute==
After opening in 1999, Braehead was the subject of a boundary dispute between the Glasgow and Renfrewshire council areas, as originally the council boundary line divided the shopping centre in two. In 2002, a Local Government Boundary Commission ruling eventually redrew the boundary to include all of the centre in Renfrewshire, as this was the original ancient boundary. The boundary runs along Kings Inch Drive and is marked by a chain linked fence at this point.

<doc id="178796" wikidata="Q10566" url="?curid=178796" title="Saskatoon">
<text>Saskatoon () is the largest city in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. It straddles a bend in the South Saskatchewan River in the central region of the province. It is located along the Trans-Canada Yellowhead Highway, and has served as the cultural and economic hub of central Saskatchewan since its founding in 1882 as a Temperance colony.

With a 2021 census population of 266,141, Saskatoon is the largest city in the province, and the 17th largest Census Metropolitan Area in Canada, with a 2021 census population of 317,480. 

Saskatoon is home to the University of Saskatchewan, the Meewasin Valley Authority—which protects the South Saskatchewan River and provides for the city&#x27;s popular riverbank park spaces—and Wanuskewin Heritage Park, a National Historic Site of Canada and UNESCO World Heritage applicant representing 6,000 years of First Nations history. The Rural Municipality of Corman Park No. 344, the most populous rural municipality in Saskatchewan, surrounds the city and contains many of the developments associated with it, including Wanuskewin. Saskatoon is named after the saskatoon berry, which is native to the region and is itself derived from the Cree &quot;&quot;. The city has a significant Indigenous population and several urban Reserves. The city has nine river crossings and is nicknamed &quot;Paris of the Prairies&quot; and &quot;Bridge City&quot;.

Historic neighbourhoods of Saskatoon include Nutana and Riversdale, which were separate towns before amalgamating with the town of Saskatoon and incorporating as a city in 1906. Nutana, Riversdale, their historic main streets of Broadway Avenue and 20th Street, as well as the downtown core and other central neighbourhoods are seeing significant reinvestment and redevelopment. Sutherland was a rail town beyond the University of Saskatchewan lands, annexed by the city in 1956.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Saskatoon&quot; (in , &quot;Saskatoon&quot; or the locatives: &quot;misâskwatôminihk&quot; , lit: &quot;at the saskatoon berry&quot;, &quot;misâskwatôminiskâhk&quot; , &quot;at the place of many saskatoon berries&quot;, &quot;mînisihk&quot; &quot;at the berry&quot;) comes from the Cree inanimate noun &quot;misâskwatômina&quot; &quot;saskatoon berries&quot;, which refers to the sweet, violet-coloured serviceberry that grows in the area. However, the exact origin of the naming of the settlement is unclear. Founder John Lake apparently told multiple stories, including the most famous, where in August, 1883 he was handed a handful of berries, told their name, and exclaimed, &quot;Arise Saskatoon Queen of the North!&quot; It is considered most likely that the name in fact derived from one already in use: &quot;manemesaskwatan&quot;, or &quot;the place where willows are cut,&quot; referring to the Cree practice of cutting saskatoon berry willows for arrow shafts.

==History==
In 1882, the Toronto-based Temperance Colonization Society was granted 21 sections of land straddling the South Saskatchewan River, between what is now Warman and Dundurn. The aim of the group was to escape the liquor trade in Toronto and set up a &quot;dry&quot; community in the Prairie region. The following year settlers, led by John Neilson Lake, arrived on the site of what is now Saskatoon and established the first permanent settlement. The settlers travelled by railway from Ontario to Moose Jaw and then completed the final leg via horse-drawn cart, as the railway had yet to be completed to Saskatoon.

In 1885 the North-West Rebellion affected the tiny community in a variety of ways. Chief Whitecap and Charles Trottier passed through the present day University campus on their way to join Louis Riel&#x27;s armed forces at Batoche, Saskatchewan. Following the fighting at the Battle of Fish Creek, and the Battle of Batoche, wounded Canadian soldiers convalesced at the Marr Residence which is today a historic site. A few died in care and were buried in the Pioneer Cemetery near the Exhibition Grounds.

A town charter for the west side of the river was obtained in 1903, and this settlement adopted the name Saskatoon; the original townsite, which became a village that year, was renamed Nutana. In 1906 Saskatoon became a city with a population of 4,500, which included the communities of Saskatoon, Riversdale and Nutana. In 1955, a newly established community west of the city, Montgomery Place, was annexed, followed by the neighbouring town of Sutherland in 1956. Saskatoon serves as regional center for the northern prairies and for central and northern Saskatchewan.

==Geography==
Saskatoon lies on a long belt of rich, potassic chernozem in middle-southern Saskatchewan and is found in the aspen parkland biome. The lack of surrounding mountainous topography gives the city a relatively flat grid, though the city does sprawl over a few hills and into a few valleys. The lowest point in the city is the river, while the highest point is in the Sutherland-College Park area. Saskatoon, on a cross-section from west to east, has a general decline in elevation above sea level heading towards the river, and on the east bank of the river, the terrain is mostly level until outside the city, where it begins to decrease in elevation again.

Saskatoon is divided into east and west sides by the South Saskatchewan River. It is then divided into Suburban Development Areas (SDA) which are composed of neighbourhoods. Street addresses are demarcated into north and south (for avenues aligned in those directions) and similar east and west (for streets aligned in those directions). West of the river, the demarcation line for north and south addresses is 22nd Street, while east and west are divided by Idylwyld Drive (north of 20th Street) and Avenue A (south of 20th). On the east side, in order to line up with 22nd/Idylwyld, Lorne Avenue demarcates east and west while Aird Street, a minor residential road, marks the north–south boundary, except in the Sutherland community where a separate east/west demarcation takes place with Central Avenue as the boundary (there is, however, no separate north–south divide). As a result of the unusual demarcation on the east side, few streets there actually carry a &quot;North&quot; or &quot;West&quot; designation, and only a few streets in Sutherland are demarcated &quot;East&quot; and &quot;West&quot;.

A second major water feature aside from the river is the Hudson Bay Slough, a remnant of a glacier-formed body of water that at one time dominated the northern end of the city. Industrial development has resulted in most of the slough being drained, however a large remnant has been preserved off Avenue C as part of RCAF Memorial Park, and another portion remains intact within the Hudson Bay Industrial area. Several residential communities also feature &quot;man-made lakes,&quot; with Lakeview (developed from the early 1980s) being the first.

Pike Lake and Blackstrap Provincial Parks are both approximately south of the city on Highway 60 and Highway 11, respectively. Batoche, a national historic site associated with the North-West Rebellion of 1885, is north of the city. Both Blackstrap and Batoche are popular destinations for school field trips.

===Climate===
Saskatoon experiences a borderline cold semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSk&quot;) to humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;), with typically warm summers and long, cold winters. Climate data from University of Saskatchewan, in the inner city meets semi-arid criteria. This is due to slightly higher average annual temperature and slightly lower average annual precipitation than the Airport, on the city&#x27;s northwest periphery.

The city has four distinct seasons and is in plant hardiness zone 3b. Saskatoon has a dry climate and sees of precipitation per year on average, with the summer being the wettest season. Saskatoon is sunnier than average in Canada as a result, averaging 2,350.4 hours of bright sunshine annually. The extreme temperatures are typically accompanied by below average levels of humidity. Thunderstorms are common in the summer months and can be severe with torrential rain, hail, high winds, intense lightning and, on occasion, tornadoes. The frost-free growing season lasts from May 21 to September 15, but due to Saskatoon&#x27;s northerly location, damaging frosts have occurred as late as June 14 and again as early as August. The average daytime high temperature peaks at from July 31 to August 8.

The &quot;Blizzard of 2007&quot; was described by many residents as the worst they had seen and paralyzed the city with its low visibility, extreme cold and large volume of snow. Winds rose to over and an estimated of snow fell throughout the day. Many area residents took refuge overnight at area work places, shopping centres, hospitals and the university.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Saskatoon was on 6 June 1988. The lowest temperature ever recorded was on 1 February 1893.

=== Ethnicity ===
The Saskatoon area was inhabited long before any permanent settlement was established, to which the ongoing archaeological work at Wanuskewin Heritage Park and other locations bears witness. Canada&#x27;s First Nations population has been increasingly urbanized, and nowhere is that more apparent than in Saskatoon, where the First Nations population increased by 382% from 1981 to 2001; however, a portion of this increase, possibly as much as half, is believed to be due to more people identifying themselves as Indigenous in the census rather than migration or birth rate.

Saskatoon has the second highest percentage of Indigenous population among major Canadian cities at approximately 11.5%, behind Winnipeg at 12.4% and Regina close by with 10.4%; in certain neighbourhoods such as Pleasant Hill, this percentage exceeds 40%. Most First Nations residents are of Cree or Dakota cultural background although to a lesser extent Saulteaux, Assiniboine, and Dene communities also exist.

Saskatoon also has a substantial Métis population and is close to the historically significant Southbranch Settlements to the north, as well as the Prairie Ronde settlement near Dundurn, Saskatchewan.

==Culture==
===Events and festivals===
Saskatoon&#x27;s major arts venue is TCU Place, which is next to Midtown Plaza downtown. Since opening in 1967, it has hosted scores of concerts, theatrical performances, live events such as the Telemiracle telethon, high school graduation and university convocation ceremonies, and conventions. It is also home to the Saskatoon Symphony Orchestra. It recently underwent a multimillion-dollar renovation to its main theatre (named in honour of former mayor and senator Sidney Buckwold).

For rock concerts and major shows, SaskTel Centre is the main venue. It is Saskatchewan&#x27;s
largest arena, with a capacity of 15,195 for sporting events and 14,000 for concerts. Musical acts from Saskatoon include Joni Mitchell, Kyle Riabko, Wide Mouth Mason, The Northern Pikes, The Sheepdogs, One Bad Son and The Deep Dark Woods, as well as countless others popular at both local and regional levels. The facility was the 2007 host for the Juno Awards, Canada&#x27;s foremost music industry honours.

Saskatoon hosts many festivals and events in the summer, including the Shakespeare on the Saskatchewan Festival, The Great Plains Comedy Festival, the Jazz Festival, the Saskatchewan Children&#x27;s Festival, the Saskatoon Fringe Theatre Festival (a showcase of alternative theatre), Saskatoon Folkfest (a cultural festival), Doors Open Saskatoon, Fairy Door Tours Saskatoon and the Canada Remembers Airshow.

For over 25 years, Saskatoon has hosted a gathering of antique automobiles, (mainly from the 1960s) that has grown into an event called &quot;Cruise Weekend&quot;. The event is usually held on the last weekend (Friday, Saturday and Sunday) in August. Activities include a poker derby, dances, and a show &#x27;N&#x27; shine with over 800 cars from all over western Canada. No admission is charged and everyone is free to walk around and enjoy the atmosphere.

The city&#x27;s annual exhibition (now called the Saskatoon Exhibition but also known in previous years as Pioneer Days and &quot;The Ex&quot;) is held every August at Prairieland Park. In the late 1990s, the Saskatoon Exhibition was rescheduled to August so that it no longer was in direct competition with the Calgary Stampede, which frequently overlapped the event.

Saskatoon&#x27;s Sikh community celebrates the festival of Vaisakhi with a parade held in May.

The francophone community is represented by the Fédération des francophones de Saskatoon which organizes many cultural events.

===Galleries and museums===

Art museums in Saskatoon include the Remai Modern, located at River Landing, a development along the shoreline of the South Saskatchewan River, in the Central Business District. The art museum is situated in a building designed by Bruce Kuwabara, and houses over 8,000 works in its collection. The design for the museum won the Award of Excellence from the Canadian Architect magazine in 2011. Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque and other 20th-century artists have a home in the Remai Modern museum. Opened on October 21, 2017, the Remai Modern has been listed at no. 18 in the New York Times &quot;52 places to go in 2018: A starter kit for escaping into the world.&quot; The Remai Modern inherited the collection of the defunct Mendel Art Gallery, which operated in City Park from 1964 to 2015.

The Saskatchewan Craft Council Gallery is on the main floor of the Saskatchewan Craft Council building in the Broadway Avenue area. It is Saskatchewan&#x27;s only public exhibition gallery dedicated to fine craft as an art form. Saskatchewan Craft Council Gallery presents seven to eight exhibitions each year. The SCC Fine Craft Boutique, located in the gallery, features the work of over 75 SCC fine craft artists.

The Ukrainian Museum of Canada is on the banks of the South Saskatchewan River. It was founded in 1941 by the Ukrainian Women&#x27;s Association of Canada.

The Meewasin Valley Centre, in Friendship Park, has information on Saskatoon&#x27;s history, the South Saskatchewan River, and the future of the Meewasin Valley.

Saskatoon is also home of the Saskatchewan Western Development Museum. This museum, one of four throughout the province, documents early pioneer life in Saskatchewan. It is noted for its interior recreation of a &quot;Boom Town&quot; main street, including one original building relocated from its original site. The Saskatchewan Railway Museum is just outside the city and includes displays of rolling stock and historic railway buildings from various parts of the province.

The Forestry Farm Park and Zoo is a National Historic Site situated in the northeast region of the city. The Forestry Farm was a historic nursery (dating from 1913) responsible for growing many of the trees planted within the prairie provinces. In 1966 the nursery operations were discontinued and part of the region turned into a municipal park. The city zoo is also housed within the park and features over 80 species of animals.
Wanuskewin Heritage Park is a National Historic Site situated five km to the north of Saskatoon. It is an Indigenous archaeological site and features displays, special events, and activities, recent renovations are on hold due to a lack of funds during the renovations.

===Theatres===
Live theatre is a central, vibrant part of Saskatoon&#x27;s culture. Saskatoon is host to a number of live theatre venues such as the Persephone Theatre, which is in the Remai Arts Centre at River Landing in downtown Saskatoon, The Refinery and the Saskatchewan Native Theatre Company.

The Broadway Theatre primarily shows arthouse films – while the two-screen Roxy Theatre is an &quot;atmospheric-style&quot; second-run theatre that reopened in 2005 after sitting unused for over a decade. The remainder of the city&#x27;s theatres are multiplexes. The only movie theatre in the downtown core is the Scotia Bank VIP Theatre; the Capitol 4 shut down on April 3, 2008. The city&#x27;s other movie theatres are The Landmark Theatre in the new subdivision of Brighton, Rainbow Cinemas (a second-run cinema) and the Cineplex Cinemas at The Centre mall on the city&#x27;s east side.

Among the many movie theatres of the past that have come and gone was the Capitol Theatre, which opened in 1929 with a showing of the first talkie to be exhibited in Saskatoon. The Capitol closed in the early 1980s to make way for the Scotia Centre office tower; its name was transferred to the aforementioned Capitol 4 a block away.

===Other attractions===
One of the city&#x27;s landmarks is the Delta Bessborough Hotel, known to locals as the &quot;Bez&quot;. Built by the Canadian National Railway, it was among the last railway hotels to be started before the Great Depression of the 1930s brought their era to a close. Although the building was completed in 1932, it did not open its doors until 1935 due to the Depression. The Bessborough and the Mendel Art Gallery are the only major structures on the river side of Spadina Crescent. One of the most frequently circulated photographs of Saskatoon is of the hotel framed in one of the arches of the Broadway Bridge.

The Meewasin Valley Trail follows the South Saskatchewan River through Saskatoon. Summer activities include cycling, jogging and walking through parks and natural areas. Cross-country skiing is popular during the winter months, along with skating in Kiwanis Memorial Park. Access points are found throughout the city with interpretive signage and washrooms along the route. There are parks throughout the Meewasin Valley, with washrooms, picnic facilities, and lookout points along the river bank. In the winter the Meewasin Skating Rink is open free to the public; it is in Kiwanis Memorial Park beside the Delta Bessborough hotel. The outdoor rink has been open since 1980.

For years, a parcel of land west of the Traffic Bridge, south of 19th Street, and east of Avenue C has been the subject of on-again, off-again redevelopment plans. The site formerly held the Saskatoon Arena, a power plant, a branch of the Royal Canadian Legion, and the head offices of the Saskatoon Public School Division; all these structures have been demolished to make way for redevelopment, with plans for same dating back to the 1980s. The most recent version of the plan called River Landing is ongoing. Calgary developer Lake Placid has proposed a 200 million dollar mega hotel/condo project to be built on the site although Lake Placid had difficulty securing financing and missed an October 30, 2009, deadline to submit a 4.5 million dollar payment for the parcel of land which seemingly killed the deal. On November 16, 2009, it was revealed by Lake Placid that the financing should be secure within a week. In April 2010, Saskatoon City Council voted in favour of entering new negotiations with Lake Placid over the site.
November 2010, Victory Majors Investments buys out Lake Placid&#x27;s interest in the project and in
August 2011 of the next year proposed a major overhaul to original design which would later include building a 20-story residential and 14-story hotel towers, and an 18-story and a 13-story office tower as part of River Landing Village completed in 2021.

The Saskatoon Farmers&#x27; Market and some commercial sites have also been developed. Future plans separate from Lake Placid include the development of a new art gallery to replace the Mendel Art Gallery by 2014. Other landmarks in the city include the iconic Traffic Bridge (which was demolished in 2016 and is currently being replaced by a new structure evoking the appearance of the original), the University of Saskatchewan campus, and the large Viterra grain terminal which has dominated the western skyline of the city for decades and is large enough to be visible from Pike Lake Provincial Park 32 km away.

==Economy==


The economy of Saskatoon has been associated with potash, oil and agriculture (specifically wheat), resulting in the moniker &quot;POW City&quot;. Various grains, livestock, oil and gas, potash, uranium, gold, diamond, coal and their spin off industries fuel the economy. The world&#x27;s largest publicly traded uranium company, Cameco, and the world&#x27;s largest potash producer, Nutrien, have corporate headquarters in Saskatoon. Saskatoon is also the new home of BHP Billiton&#x27;s Diamonds and Specialty Products business unit.

Nearly two-thirds of the world&#x27;s recoverable potash reserves are in the Saskatoon region. Innovation Place founded in 1980 brings together almost 150 agriculture, information technology, and environmental, life sciences and agricultural biotechnology industries in a science park or technology park setting. Saskatoon is also home to the Canadian Light Source, Canada&#x27;s national synchrotron facility.

Saskatoon&#x27;s digital media scene is growing with start-up tech companies such as Noodlecake, Point2, Vendasta Technologies, and Zu.

One of Saskatoon&#x27;s nicknames, &quot;Hub City&quot;, refers to its ideal central location within Canada for distribution and logistics. Saskatoon John G. Diefenbaker International Airport with 105,620 aircraft movements in 2008 was listed as the 19th busiest airport in Canada, 12th busiest in passenger traffic.

Saskatoon is developing the South Central Business District, or block 146, which is called the River Landing Project. Long range planning is underway for an expected city population of 325,000 by 2028 (2011 MXD report).

Saskatoon was expected to see a 4.2 percent growth in gross domestic product for the year 2012. The city saw a 3.4% growth in 2004, 5.1% increase in 2005 and a 2.8% increase in 2006. Saskatoon held Canada&#x27;s No. 1 economic growth spot for Canada in 2005 according to the Conference Board of Canada. The Conference Board again predicted the city would rate first for economic increase in 2012, showing a growth rate of 4.2%. The Saskatoon Regional Economic Development Authority (SREDA) has also been ranked amongst Canada&#x27;s top ten economic development organizations by &quot;Site Selection&quot; magazine.

From 1988 to 2016 Hitachi Canadian Industries operated a power equipment manufacturing plant. It was closed and assets acquired by Brandt Group in 2017.

==Government and politics==
===Municipal===

Saskatoon is governed by a City Council comprising ten councillors elected to represent ten separate wards, and a mayor elected city-wide. Historically, councillors have at times been elected at-large, and term lengths for both councillors (known as aldermen until 1991) and mayors have varied over time; council has operated on a ward-basis continuously since 1994, while both mayors and councillors have served four-year terms since 2012. Municipal elections are held in the fall. As of 2025, 209 individuals have served on the town or city council, and 29 individuals have served as mayor, with 24 of those individuals having first served as a councillor. The city&#x27;s current mayor, elected in the 2024 municipal election, is Cynthia Block.

===Provincial===

Saskatoon is represented in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan by 15 of the province&#x27;s 61 MLAs, including the riding of Martensville-Blairmore, which contains one of the city&#x27;s neighbourhoods. Following the 2024 Saskatchewan general election in October 2024, thirteen of the city&#x27;s MLAs are members of the New Democratic Party, and two, including the MLA for Martensville-Blairmore, are members of the governing Saskatchewan Party.
===Federal===
Saskatoon is represented by three MPs in the Canadian House of Commons. Following the 2021 Canadian federal election, all three seats belong to members of the Conservative Party.
==Infrastructure==
===Health care===
The Saskatchewan Health Authority is responsible for health care delivery in the area. They operate three hospitals within the city boundaries, these include Royal University Hospital, Saskatoon City Hospital, and St. Paul&#x27;s Hospital (Saskatoon). Royal University Hospital is a teaching and research hospital that operates in partnership with the University of Saskatchewan. The health authority also operates hospitals in smaller neighbouring communities. In addition to hospitals the health authority operates long-term care facilities, clinics and other health care services. Jim Pattison Children&#x27;s Hospital began construction in 2014 and opened in 2019 under the auspices of what was then the Saskatoon Health Region, since absorbed into the Saskatchewan Health Authority.

===Policing===

The Saskatoon Police Service is the primary police service for the city of Saskatoon and holds both Municipal and Provincial Jurisdiction. The following services also have jurisdiction in Saskatoon: Corman Park Police Service, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Canadian National Railway Police Service and the Canadian Pacific Railway Police Service. As of December 31, 2012, the SPS had 442 sworn members, 59 Special Constables, and 136 civilian positions.

====Crime====
The 2006 census crime data, released July 18, 2007, showed Saskatoon leading Canada in violent crime, with 1,606 violent crimes per 100,000 residents annually. However, crime statistics produced by the Saskatoon Police Service shows that crime is on the decline. In 2010, total crimes against people went up 1.28% but total crimes against property fell by 11.75%. In 2014, Saskatoon dropped to fourth highest in Canada for its CSI after being in second place for several years. Crime in Canada uses Crime Severity Index calculated using the crime rate and the severity of those crimes. 2019 saw a record 16 homicides reported in Saskatoon, giving the city a homicide rate of around 6.5 murders per 100,000 people.

In the early 1990s, the Saskatoon police were found to engage in &quot;starlight tours,&quot; where officers would arrest Indigenous men and drive them out of the city in the dead of winter to abandon them.

===Transportation===
==== Roads and bridges ====
Saskatoon is on the Yellowhead Highway spur of the Trans-Canada Highway system, also known as Highway 16, which connects Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Alberta, and British Columbia. Highways 5, 7, 11, 12, 14, 41, 219, 684, and 762 all meet at Saskatoon, with Highway 60 terminating just outside the southwestern city limits. The following bridges cross the South Saskatchewan River in Saskatoon (in order from upstream):

* Grand Trunk Bridge (rail)
* Gordie Howe Bridge
* Senator Sid Buckwold Bridge
* Traffic Bridge
* Broadway Bridge
* University Bridge
* CPR Bridge (rail)
* Circle Drive Bridge
* Chief Mistawasis Bridge

Construction of Saskatoon&#x27;s ring road, Circle Drive, began in the mid-1960s (after first being proposed in 1913), and was completed on July 31, 2013, with the opening of the $300 million South Circle Drive project.
==== Rail ====
The Canadian Pacific Railway and the Canadian National Railway have connections to Saskatoon. Both railways operate intermodal facilities and trans-load centres; while Canadian National Railway also operates an automotive transfer facility. Saskatoon is a stop on The Canadian passenger transcontinental rail route operated by Via Rail. The Saskatoon railway station is in the city&#x27;s west end; it opened in the late 1960s as a replacement for Saskatoon&#x27;s original main station which was on 1st Avenue downtown—the relocation of the station sparked a major redevelopment of the downtown that included the construction of the Midtown Plaza, TCU Place (originally named the Centennial Auditorium) and other developments. The many provincial transportation connections and geographic location of Saskatoon give it one of its nicknames &quot;The Hub City&quot;. The Saskatchewan Railway Museum is just outside the city. In the early 2000s, talk about moving all the railways out of the city raised questions about a future LRT system, but the city&#x27;s then-Mayor said the population is too small. The Canadian Pacific rails in particular run close to the city centre, with at-grade crossings with the main throughfares at 3rd Avenue/Warman Road, Idylwyld Drive, 22nd Street, Avenue H, 20th Street, and Avenue P. As of the city&#x27;s &quot;2021 Transportation Study,&quot; there seems to be no progress on improvements to the railway network around Saskatoon.

==== Air ====
Saskatoon/John G. Diefenbaker International Airport, located in the city&#x27;s northwest, provides scheduled and charter airline service for the city, and is a significant hub for mining and remote locations in Northern Saskatchewan. Non-stop scheduled destinations include Calgary, Edmonton, Las Vegas, Minneapolis, Prince Albert, Regina, Toronto, Vancouver, and Winnipeg. Seasonal and Charter service is provided to Mexico, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Phoenix and Churchill, MB. Air Canada, WestJet and Purolator Courier all have cargo facilities at the airport. Saskatoon/Corman Air Park is a general aviation airport 15 km southeast of Saskatoon.
==== Bus ====
Transit operations in Saskatoon are provided by Saskatoon Transit. The route system was revamped in 2018, creating high-frequency corridors on 22nd Street, 8th Street, and College Drive. An up-to-date schedule is posted at Saskatoon Transit Route &amp; Schedule Adjustments. Saskatoon was serviced by STC for bus service connecting across the province until May 2017, and Greyhound Canada for inter-provincial bus service between Manitoba and Alberta until Greyhound discontinued service on October 31, 2018.

==Education==

Saskatoon has a number of higher education institutions:
* University of Saskatchewan
* St. Thomas More College is a Catholic federated college of the University of Saskatchewan. Affiliated with the University of Saskatchewan are the Lutheran Theological Seminary, College of Emmanuel and St. Chad (Anglican Church of Canada), and St. Andrew&#x27;s College (United Church of Canada). All three are on the university campus.
* The First Nations University of Canada – Saskatoon campus.
* Saskatchewan Polytechnic
* Gabriel Dumont Institute
* Saskatchewan Indian Institute of Technologies

Saskatoon has 78 elementary schools and 14 high schools, serving about 37,000 students. Saskatoon has three main school boards, the Saskatoon Public School Division, the Saskatoon Catholic School Division and the Conseil des Ecoles Fransaskoises.

The western annexation of what is now called the Blairmore SDA also brought the Yarrow Youth Farm within the city limits; operated by the Province of Saskatchewan, this was a correction facility for at-risk youth. The facility was subsequently closed in March 2015 and the land, located within the under-development Kensington community, was out up for sale the following autumn.

==Sports and recreation==
Ice hockey is a popular sport in Saskatoon and the city is home to numerous amateur teams, including the Saskatoon Blades of the Western Hockey League (WHL). Saskatoon was a major league hockey city from 1921 to 1926 when the Saskatoon Sheiks played in the Western Canada Hockey League. Major professional hockey appeared poised to return to the city in 1982. Bill Hunter, a local sports promoter, attempted to purchase the St. Louis Blues of the National Hockey League (NHL) and move them to Saskatoon. The city built a new arena to support the move, but the relocation was prevented by the league. In the early 1990s, Hunter made a bid for a Saskatoon expansion NHL franchise, but ultimately failed to secure adequate funding.

The city is home to two professional franchises, the Saskatchewan Rush of the National Lacrosse League (NLL), and the Saskatchewan Rattlers of the Canadian Elite Basketball League (CEBL). The Rush relocated to Saskatoon from Edmonton in 2016; already the defending NLL Champions, the Rush made it to the NLL final in its first three seasons in Saskatoon, winning in 2016 and 2018. The Rattlers were a charter CEBL franchise and won the league&#x27;s inaugural championship in 2019. Saskatoon is also home to the semi-professional Saskatchewan Heat of the National Ringette League (NRL).
Canadian football is another popular sport in Saskatoon, and the city is home to a number of successful football teams. The University of Saskatchewan Huskies are one of the top University football programs in Canada, with three Vanier Cup national championships and 19 Hardy Trophy Canada West championships. The Huskies have made nine Vanier Cup appearances since 1990, and were the first team from outside of Ontario to host the Vanier Cup, doing so in 2006. The Saskatoon Hilltops of the Canadian Junior Football League have won 22 national junior championships throughout their history, the most in the country. The Saskatoon Valkyries are the Western Women&#x27;s Canadian Football League&#x27;s most successful club, having won 8 WWCFL Championships since play began in 2011.

The Huskies play U Sports league games at the University campus. Their facilities include Griffiths Stadium, Merlis Belsher Place, and the Physical Activity Complex. The Huskies participate in twelve sports at the national level and have been most successful in football, men&#x27;s volleyball, women&#x27;s basketball, and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s Track and Field.

Baseball is also popular in Saskatoon. The city has been home to a variety of amateur teams including the Saskatoon Yellow Jackets, Saskatoon Stallions, and Saskatoon Legends. The Saskatoon Berries joined the Western Canadian Baseball League as an expansion team for the 2024 season.

Saskatchewan International Raceway has been in operation for over 40 years and is home to 1/4 mile IHRA drag racing and holds racing events from May to September. North of the city lies Wyant Group Raceway, a paved oval track home to local stock car racing as well as races for several different Western Canadian series. In 2009, the NASCAR Canadian Tire Series made its inaugural stop there, signalling a move to a larger profile track in Saskatoon. Marquis Downs at Prairieland Park hosted horse racing from 1969 until 2020; the owners hope to build a soccer-specific stadium on the site.

The city is home to a number of sports and recreation centres. Saskatoon has three curling clubs: Sutherland, Nutana, and CN. The city has two indoor soccer facilities under the control of the non-profit Saskatoon Soccer Centre organization. Lions Skatepark was built in the Riversdale area in 2003. Saskatoon is home to several golf courses and various parks which include tennis courts, ball diamonds, and soccer pitches for spring, summer, and fall use, and outdoor rinks for winter use.

=== Major sports events hosted ===
==The Canadian Crown in Saskatoon==
Saskatoon has welcomed members of the Royal Family since 1919. The Queen most recently visited for a gala concert at Credit Union Centre, before a live audience of 12,000 and television viewers nationwide in 2005. The Queen was presented with the key to the city on the same visit, after touring the Canadian Light Source synchrotron and greeting thousands of well-wishers on a walkabout at the University of Saskatchewan (the Queen traditionally stayed at the on-campus residence of the President of the University of Saskatchewan when she visited the city). Sovereigns and consorts who have visited include Edward VIII as Prince of Wales in 1919, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in 1939, and Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh, as Princess Elizabeth in 1951 and afterwards as Queen in 1959, 1978, 1987 and 2005.

Other members of the Royal Family who have visited include Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon in 1980, the Prince of Wales Charles (now Charles III) in 2001, the Princess Anne in 1982 and (as Princess Royal) in 2004, the Duke and Duchess of York (Andrew and Sarah) in 1989, and the Prince Edward in 1978. Governors General and Lieutenant Governors also pay regular visits to Saskatoon. Saskatonian Ray Hnatyshyn is credited with popularising his office as Governor General from 1990 to 1995. Saskatchewan Lieutenant Governors Barnhart, Fedoruk, McNab, Monroe, Porteous and Worobetz were all former residents of Saskatoon.

Connections to the crown include the royal namesakes of about one hundred neighbourhoods, parks, streets, schools and other places. These include King George, Queen Elizabeth and Massey Place neighbourhoods, and Victoria, Coronation and Princess Diana parks. It was at one time considered that Saskatoon&#x27;s Broadway Bridge would be renamed George V Bridge. Landmarks and institutions also have connections and these include the Royal University Hospital, one of four royal designations in Saskatchewan. Grade schools named for royals include Ecole Victoria School, King George School, Queen Elizabeth School, Prince Philip School and Princess Alexandra School.

Existing and historic hotels with royal namesakes include the King George Hotel which has been recently converted to ultra-luxury condominiums, the King Edward Hotel, the Queen&#x27;s Hotel and the Patricia Hotel. The Hotel Bessborough was named for a Canadian Governor General who visited the landmark under construction in the 1930s. The Queen Elizabeth Power Station is within the city and named after Queen Elizabeth. The Prince of Wales Promenade along the South Saskatchewan River is a focal point on the riverfront trails. In 2002, 378 Saskatoon residents were presented with Canada&#x27;s Golden Jubilee Medal by vice-regals to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Queen&#x27;s accession to the throne.

== Sister cities ==
Saskatoon has partnered itself with three cities around the world. It has not taken on a new partnership since joining with Chernvitsi in 1991. The city says it is working on a proper policy and management framework for handling new applications as Madison, Wisconsin applied to be a twin in 2018, but was told Saskatoon had no intention to move forward with the plan &quot;at this time.&quot;

<doc id="178802" wikidata="Q313683" url="?curid=178802" title="Jack Bruce">
<text>John Symon Asher Bruce (14 May 1943 – 25 October 2014) was a Scottish musician. He gained popularity as the primary lead vocalist and ‍bassist ‍of rock band Cream. After the group disbanded in 1968, he pursued a solo career and also played with several bands.

In the early 1960s, Bruce joined the Graham Bond Organisation (GBO), where he met future Cream bandmate Ginger Baker. After leaving the band, he briefly joined John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers, where he met Eric Clapton. In 1966, after a short time with Manfred Mann, he formed Cream with lead guitarist Clapton and drummer Baker. He co-wrote many of their songs (including &quot;Sunshine of Your Love&quot;, &quot;White Room&quot; and &quot;I Feel Free&quot;) with poet/lyricist Pete Brown. After the group disbanded in the late 1960s, he began recording solo albums. Bruce put together a band of his own to perform material live and subsequently formed the blues rock band West, Bruce and Laing in 1972, with ex-Mountain guitarist Leslie West and drummer Corky Laing. His solo career spanned several decades. From the 1970s to the 1990s he played with several bands as a touring member. He reunited with Cream in 2005 for concerts at the Royal Albert Hall and at Madison Square Garden in New York.

Bruce is considered one of the most important and influential ‍bassists ‍of all time. ‍&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine readers ranked him number eight on their list of &quot;10 ‍Greatest ‍Bassists ‍of All Time&quot;. He was inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993, and was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2006, both as a member of Cream.

==Life and career==
===1943–1962: Early life===
Bruce was born on 14 May 1943 in Bishopbriggs, Lanarkshire, Scotland, to Betty (&quot;née&quot; Asher) and Charlie Bruce, musical parents who moved frequently, resulting in the young Bruce attending 14 different schools, ending up at Bellahouston Academy. He began playing jazz bass in his teens and won a scholarship to study cello and musical composition at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama while playing in Jim McHarg&#x27;s Scotsville Jazzband to support himself.

===1962–1966: Early career===
Jack&#x27;s playing in jazz combos was disapproved of by his school and he was forced to leave. After leaving school, he toured Italy, playing double bass with the Murray Campbell Big Band. 

In 1962, Bruce became a member of the London-based band Blues Incorporated, led by Alexis Korner, in which he played the upright bass. The band also included organist Graham Bond, saxophonist Dick Heckstall-Smith and drummer Ginger Baker. In 1963 the group broke up. In March, 1963, Bruce played in the Johnny Burch Octet. Bruce would go on to form the Graham Bond Quartet with Bond, Baker and guitarist John McLaughlin. They played an eclectic range of music genres, including bebop, blues and rhythm and blues. As a result of session work, Bruce switched from the upright bass to the electric bass guitar. The move to electric bass happened as McLaughlin left the band; he was replaced by Heckstall-Smith on saxophone, and the band pursued a more concise R&amp;B sound and changed their name to the Graham Bond Organisation. The group released two studio albums and several singles but were not commercially successful.

During the time that Bruce and Baker played with the Graham Bond Organisation, they were known for their hostility towards each other. There were numerous stories of the two sabotaging each other&#x27;s equipment and fighting on stage. Relations grew so bad between the two that Bruce left the band in August 1965. 

After leaving, Bruce recorded a solo single, &quot;I&#x27;m Gettin Tired&quot;, for Polydor Records. He joined John Mayall and his Bluesbreakers band, which featured guitarist Eric Clapton. Bruce&#x27;s stay in the band was brief, and he did not contribute to any releases at the time, but recordings featuring him were later released, initially on &quot;Looking Back&quot; and &quot;Primal Solos&quot;.

After the Bluesbreakers, Bruce had his first commercial success as a member of Manfred Mann in 1966, including &quot;Pretty Flamingo&quot;, which reached number one in the UK singles chart (one of two number one records of his career – the other being an uncredited bass part on The Scaffold&#x27;s &quot;Lily the Pink&quot;) as well as the freewheeling and groundbreaking jazz rock of &quot;Instrumental Asylum&quot;. When interviewed on the edition of the VH1 show &quot;Classic Albums&quot; which featured &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot;, Mayall said that Bruce had been lured away by the lucrative commercial success of Manfred Mann, while Mann himself recalled that Bruce played his first gig with the band without any rehearsal, playing the songs straight through without error, commenting that perhaps the chord changes seemed obvious to Bruce.

While with Manfred Mann, Bruce again collaborated with Clapton as a member of Powerhouse, which also featured Spencer Davis Group members Steve Winwood credited as &quot;Steve Anglo&quot;, on vocals and Pete York on drums (Apparently, Ginger Baker was originally to have played the session), Ben Palmer on piano, and Manfred Mann vocalist Paul Jones on harmonica. Three tracks were featured on the Elektra sampler album &quot;What&#x27;s Shakin&#x27;&quot;. Two of the songs, &quot;Crossroads&quot; and &quot;Steppin&#x27; Out&quot;, became staples in the live set of his next band, Cream.

===1966–1968: Cream===

In July 1966, Bruce, Eric Clapton and Ginger Baker founded the power trio Cream, which gained international recognition playing blues-rock and jazz-inflected rock music. Bruce either penned or co-penned the majority of the band&#x27;s tunes and sang most of the lead vocals, with Clapton backing him up and eventually assuming some leads himself.

With his Gibson EB-3 or Fender VI electric basses, Bruce became one of the most famous bassists in rock, winning musicians&#x27; polls and influencing the next generation of bassists such as Sting, Jim Shaw, Geddy Lee, Geezer Butler and Jeff Berlin. Bruce co-wrote most of Cream&#x27;s single releases with lyricist Pete Brown, including the hits &quot;Sunshine of Your Love&quot;, &quot;White Room&quot; and &quot;I Feel Free&quot;. Cream broke up in 1968.

===1970s: Post-Cream===
Collaborative efforts with musicians, in many genres – hard rock, jazz, blues, R&amp;B, fusion, avant-garde, world music, third stream classical – continued as a theme of Bruce&#x27;s career. Alongside these he produced a long line of highly regarded solo albums. In contrast to his collaborative works, the solo albums usually maintain a common theme: melodic songs with a complex musical structure, songs with lyrics frequently penned by Pete Brown and a core band of world-class musicians. This structure was loosened on his live solo albums and DVDs, where extended improvisations similar to those employed by Cream in live performance were sometimes still used.

In August 1968, before Cream officially disbanded, Bruce recorded a semi-acoustic free jazz album with John McLaughlin, Dick Heckstall-Smith and Jon Hiseman. This was issued in 1970 as Bruce&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;Things We Like&quot;. The album was a precursor to the jazz fusion boom in the early 1970s.

Bruce&#x27;s first solo release, &quot;Songs for a Tailor&quot;, was issued in September 1969; it too featured Heckstall-Smith and Hiseman. It was a worldwide hit and also showcased Jack&#x27;s ability as a gifted pianist, but after a brief supporting tour backed by Larry Coryell and Mitch Mitchell, Bruce joined the jazz fusion group Lifetime, with drummer Tony Williams, guitarist McLaughlin, and organist Larry Young, for its second album, &quot;Turn It Over&quot; (1970). For the group&#x27;s third album, &quot;Ego&quot; (1971), Ron Carter replaced Bruce on bass, but Bruce contributed a guest vocal. Bruce then recorded his third solo album &quot;Harmony Row&quot;, but this was not as commercially successful as &quot;Songs for a Tailor&quot;. The song &quot;The Consul at Sunset&quot; from &quot;Harmony Row&quot;, which was inspired by the Malcolm Lowry novel &quot;Under the Volcano&quot;, was released as a single in 1971 (Polydor 2058–153, b/w &quot;A Letter of Thanks&quot;), but did not chart.
In 1972 Bruce formed a blues rock power trio, West, Bruce &amp; Laing. Besides Bruce, the group included singer/guitarist Leslie West and drummer Corky Laing, both formerly of the Cream-influenced American band Mountain. West, Bruce &amp; Laing produced two studio albums, &quot;Why Dontcha&quot; and &quot;Whatever Turns You On&quot;, and one live album, &quot;Live &#x27;n&#x27; Kickin&#x27;&quot;.

The band&#x27;s breakup was announced shortly before &quot;Live &#x27;n&#x27; Kickin&quot;″s release in early 1974, and Bruce released his fourth solo album &quot;Out of the Storm&quot; later that year. Also in 1974 he featured on the title track of Frank Zappa&#x27;s album &quot;Apostrophe (&#x27;)&quot;, recorded in November 1972. Bruce was credited with bass and co-authorship on the improvised track. When asked about Zappa in a 1992 interview, Bruce tried to change the subject and jokingly insisted that he had played only cello parts. Outtakes from the session were released on the archival release &quot;The Crux Of The Biscuit&quot; in 2016. In 1973 Bruce recorded bass guitar for Lou Reed&#x27;s &quot;Berlin&quot; album, playing on all but two tracks.

A 1975 tour was lined up to support the &quot;Out of the Storm&quot; album with a band featuring former Rolling Stones guitarist Mick Taylor and jazz keyboard player Carla Bley, with whom he had collaborated in 1971 on &quot;Escalator over the Hill&quot;. The tour was belatedly documented on &quot;Live at Manchester Free Trade Hall &#x27;75&quot; (2003), but it ended with Taylor&#x27;s departure, and sessions for a studio album were abandoned. During the next year, Bruce only resurfaced to play on Charlie Mariano&#x27;s &quot;Helen 12 Trees&quot; album.

In 1976, Bruce formed a new band (The Jack Bruce Band) with drummer Simon Phillips and keyboardist Tony Hymas. The group recorded an album, called &quot;How&#x27;s Tricks&quot;. A world tour followed, but the album was a commercial failure. The follow-up album, &quot;Jet Set Jewel&quot;, was rejected at the time by Bruce&#x27;s record label RSO as not being marketable, and RSO ultimately dropped Bruce from their roster. In 1979 he toured with members from the Mahavishnu Orchestra, reuniting him with John McLaughlin, and introducing him to drummer Billy Cobham. A 3-CD collection of his 1970s BBC recordings, entitled &quot;Spirit&quot;, was released in 2008.

===1980s===
By 1979, Bruce&#x27;s drug habit had reached such a level that he had lost most of his money. Bruce contributed as a session musician to recordings by Cozy Powell, Gary Moore and Jon Anderson to raise money. By 1980 his career was back on track with his new band, Jack Bruce &amp; Friends, consisting of drummer Billy Cobham, guitarist Clem Clempson and keyboardist/guitarist David Sancious. After releasing an album, &quot;I&#x27;ve Always Wanted to Do This&quot;, at the end of 1980, they undertook a long tour to support the record, but it was not a commercial success and they disbanded. In the early 1980s, he also joined up to play with friends from his Alexis Korner days in Rocket 88, the back-to-the-roots band that Ian Stewart had arranged, and Bruce appears on the album of the same name, recorded live in Germany in 1980. They also recorded a &quot;live in the studio&quot; album called &quot;Blues &amp; Boogie Explosion&quot; for the German audiophile record label Jeton. That year he also collaborated on the Soft Machine album &quot;Land of Cockayne&quot; (1981).

In 1981, Bruce collaborated with guitarist Robin Trower and released two power trio albums, &quot;B.L.T.&quot; and &quot;Truce&quot;, the first of which was a minor hit in the US. He also played for Trevor Rabin on the album Wolf. By 1983, Bruce was no longer contracted to a major record company and released his next solo album, &quot;Automatic&quot;, on a minor German label, Intercord. A European tour followed to promote the album enlisting Bruce Gary from The Knack (who had also played in Bruce&#x27;s 1975 band) on drums and Sancious from his 1980 band (Jack Bruce &amp; Friends) on guitar and keyboards. In 1982, Bruce played with a short-lived ensemble &quot;A Gathering of Minds&quot;, composed of Billy Cobham, Allan Holdsworth, Didier Lockwood and David Sancious at Montreux. In 1983, Bruce sang on tracks 5 and 6 of the Allan Holdsworth album &quot;Road Games&quot;.

In 1983, Bruce began working with the Latin/world music producer Kip Hanrahan, and released the collaborative albums &quot;Desire Develops an Edge&quot;, &quot;Vertical&#x27;s Currency&quot;, &quot;A Few Short Notes from the End Run&quot;, &quot;Exotica&quot; and &quot;All Roads Are Made of the Flesh&quot;. They were all critically successful, and in 2001 he went on to form his own band using Hanrahan&#x27;s famous Cuban rhythm section. Other than his partnership with lyricist Pete Brown, Bruce&#x27;s musical relationship with Hanrahan was the most consistent and long-lasting of his career.

In 1985, he sang lead and played blues harp on the song &quot;Silver Bullet&quot; with Anton Fier&#x27;s Golden Palominos. It appears on the album &quot;Visions of Excess&quot;. In 1986 he re-recorded the Cream song &quot;I Feel Free&quot; and released it as a single to support an advertising campaign for the Renault 21 motor car.

In 1989, Bruce secured his first major record deal in a decade, with Epic, and recorded &quot;A Question of Time&quot;. This included two tracks with Ginger Baker on drums, their first collaboration since Cream. Baker then joined Bruce&#x27;s live band and toured the United States at the turn of the decade.

===1990s===
Bruce played at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1990, and was invited by the Irish blues rock performer Rory Gallagher (who had a long-standing relationship with Bruce, having supported Cream&#x27;s farewell concert in the band Taste in 1968) to perform a couple of songs together on stage. In 1991 he was one of the supporting musicians for Vivian Stanshall&#x27;s solo show &quot;Rawlinson Dog-ends&quot;, but quit over a lack of adequate rehearsals.

On April 25, 1991, Bruce performed with Uli Jon Roth, Simon Phillips, Randy Hansen, John Wetton, Zeno Roth, and others at E-Werk in Cologne, Germany. This performance featured a tribute to Jimi Hendrix, and a concert video of 22 tracks was released on Laserdisc in 1994 as &quot;The Spirit of Jimi Hendrix Live in Concert&quot; in Japan.

In 1993, a solo album, &quot;Somethin Els&quot;, reunited him with Eric Clapton and brought belated, but widespread, critical acclaim.

Later that year, Ginger Baker and a host of former Bruce band colleagues joined him for two special 50th birthdays concerts in Cologne, Germany, hosted by the TV show Rockpalast. Selections from these were released as the live double CD &quot;Cities of the Heart&quot;, and much later as the DVD set &quot;Rockpalast: The 50th Birthdays Concerts&quot;. One special guest was the Irish blues-rock guitarist Gary Moore, who joined Bruce and Baker for a set of Cream classics. Inspired by this performance, the three formed the power trio BBM and their subsequent (and only) album, &quot;Around the Next Dream&quot;, was a top ten hit in the UK. However, the old arguments between Bruce and Baker arose again, and the subsequent tour was cut short and the band broke up. A low-key solo album, &quot;Monkjack&quot;, followed in 1995, featuring Bruce on piano and vocals, accompanied only by the Funkadelic organist Bernie Worrell.

Bruce then began work producing and arranging the soundtrack to the independently produced Scottish film &quot;The Slab Boys&quot;, with; Lulu, Edwyn Collins, Eddi Reader and the Proclaimers. The soundtrack album appeared in 1997. In 1997 he returned to touring as a member of Ringo Starr&#x27;s All-Starr Band, which also featured Peter Frampton on guitar. At the gig in Denver, Colorado, the band was joined onstage by Ginger Baker, and Bruce, Baker and Frampton played a short set of Cream classics. Bruce continued to tour with Starr through 2000.

===2000s===

In 2001, Bruce reappeared with a band featuring Bernie Worrell, Vernon Reid of Living Colour on guitar and Kip Hanrahan&#x27;s three-piece Latin rhythm section. Hanrahan also produced the accompanying album &quot;Shadows in the Air&quot;, which included a reunion with Eric Clapton on new versions of the Cream classics &quot;Sunshine of Your Love&quot; and &quot;White Room&quot;. The band released another Hanrahan produced studio album, &quot;More Jack than God&quot;, in 2003, and a live DVD, &quot;Live at the Canterbury Fayre&quot;.

Bruce had suffered a period of declining health, after many years of addictions which he finally beat with clinical treatment, and in 2003 was diagnosed with liver cancer. In September 2003, he underwent a liver transplant, which was almost fatal, as his body initially rejected the new organ. He recovered, and in 2004 re-appeared to perform &quot;Sunshine of Your Love&quot; at a Rock Legends concert in Germany organised by Leslie Mandoki.

In May 2005, he reunited with former Cream bandmates Clapton and Baker for a series of well-received concerts at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall, released as the album &quot;Royal Albert Hall London May 2-3-5-6, 2005&quot;, and New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden.

In between the UK and U.S. Cream dates, he also played live with Gary Moore and drummer Gary Husband at the Dick Heckstall-Smith tribute concert in London.

Subsequent concert appearances by Bruce were sparse because of recovery after the transplant, but in 2006 he returned to the live arena with a show of Cream and solo classics performed with the German HR (Hessischer Rundfunk) Big Band. This was released on CD in Germany in 2007. In 2007, he made a brief concert appearance, opening a new rehearsal hall named in his honour at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, Glasgow with Clem Clempson, keyboard player Ronnie Leahy and Husband.

In 2008, Bruce collaborated again with guitarist Robin Trower on the album &quot;Seven Moons&quot;. It also featured Husband.

In May 2008, Bruce was 65 years old and to commemorate this milestone two box sets of recordings were released. &quot;Spirit&quot; is a three-CD collection of Bruce&#x27;s BBC recordings from the 1970s. &quot;Can You Follow?&quot; is a six-CD retrospective anthology released by the Esoteric label in the UK. This anthology is a wide-ranging collection covering his music from 1963 to 2003 and, aside from his work with Kip Hanrahan, is a comprehensive overview of his career.

Improved health led to Bruce playing a series of live outdoor concerts across the US starting in July 2008 as part of the Hippiefest Tour. He was supported by members of the late Who bassist John Entwistle&#x27;s the John Entwistle Band, and headlined at a tribute concert to the bassist.

In November 2008, he recorded a concert in Birmingham, England for Radio Broadcast with the BBC Big Band, where he again played the Big Band arrangements of his classic songs. In December he was reunited with Ginger Baker at the drummer&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award concert in London. They played jazz classics with saxophonist Courtney Pine and for the first time in 40 years played the Graham Bond–Cream classic &quot;Traintime&quot;.

The same month, Bruce, with guitarist Vernon Reid, drummer Cindy Blackman and organist John Medeski played a series of Blue Note Club tribute concerts to the Tony Williams Lifetime in Japan. These shows were broadcast in high definition on television in Japan.

In 2009, Bruce performed in a series of concerts with Trower and Husband in Europe. Proposed dates in the U.S. in April were cancelled because of a further bout of ill health. Bruce recovered and the band played summer concerts in Italy, Norway and the UK during 2009. This promoted the release of the &quot;Seven Moons&quot; live CD and DVD, recorded in February during the European leg of the tour in Nijmegen, Netherlands.

During the Scottish dates of the 2009 tour Bruce was presented with an Honorary Doctorate of Letters from Glasgow Caledonian University for services to the culture of Glasgow and music in general.

In August 2009, the 1983 Bruce solo album &quot;Automatic&quot; was re-released, making his entire solo catalogue available on CD. In addition, all of the discs up to and including &quot;How&#x27;s Tricks&quot; contain previously unreleased material.

In October 2009, Bruce performed at the 50th anniversary of Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Club with the Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Blues Band.

===2010s===
&quot;Jack Bruce – Composing Himself: The Authorized Biography&quot; by Harry Shapiro was released by Jawbone Press in February 2010. Shapiro had previously written biographies of Bruce collaborators Alexis Korner, Graham Bond and Eric Clapton. The book followed memoirs from his Cream bandmates Clapton (&quot;Clapton&quot;, 2007) and Baker (&quot;Hellraiser&quot;, 2009). His songwriting partner, Pete Brown&#x27;s, biography &quot;White Rooms &amp; Imaginary Westerns&quot; was published in September 2010. They each have differing recollections of forming Cream, playing and writing together.

On 14 January, at the 2011 North American Music Merchants Show, Bruce became only the third recipient of the International Bassist Award, a lifetime achievement award for bassists, after Jaco Pastorius and Nathan Watts.

His first independent CD release, &quot;Live at the Milky Way, Amsterdam 2001&quot;, featuring The Cuicoland Express, his Latin-based band of the time, was issued in October 2010. The double album received an official worldwide release, distributed by EMI in February 2011. To support this release Bruce again played four dates in London at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club with the Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Blues Experience, followed by a further ten dates across the UK with the band. On 4 June 2011, Bruce played a special concert at the Royal Festival Hall in London, which was celebrating its 60th anniversary. The evening celebrated the 50th anniversary of the blues in Great Britain, and Bruce played with his Big Blues Band and special guest Joe Bonamassa.

Bruce started 2012 playing the Gerry Rafferty tribute concert in Glasgow, followed by a date with the traditional Celtic band Lau. BBC Scotland recorded a one-hour special on Bruce, which also included a performance with Lau. The completed documentary &quot;Jack Bruce – The Man Behind the Bass&quot; was transmitted in February 2012 by BBC Scotland. It featured new interviews with Bruce, Clapton, Baker and Brown. It was transmitted again on 9 November 2014 on BBC2 Scotland and on 17 November 2014 on BBC4 in the UK.

February 2012 saw Bruce playing in Havana, Cuba, along with guitarist Phil Manzanera, supporting the mambo band of Augusto Enriquez. March saw another residency at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s in London supported by his Big Blues Band, followed by a UK tour. The concert at the Stables, Milton Keynes on 18 March was due to be recorded as an Instant Live CD release, but technical issues prevented this. The following evenings&#x27; performance at the same location was recorded and a 2CD version issued by Instant Live.

&quot;Spectrum Road&quot;, a collaboration with Vernon Reid, Cindy Blackman and John Medeski in tribute to The Tony Williams Lifetime, was released in June 2012 by the US jazz record label Palmetto Records and was accompanied by a series of dates at large jazz festivals in North America and Europe throughout June and July.

In March 2014, Bruce released &quot;Silver Rails&quot; on the Esoteric Antenna label, his first solo studio album in over a decade. &quot;Silver Rails&quot; was recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London, produced and mixed by Rob Cass and features contributions from Cream lyricist, Pete Brown, Kip Hanrahan and wife Margrit Seyffer as well as musicians Robin Trower, Cindy Blackman, Phil Manzanera, Uli Jon Roth, John Medeski and Bernie Marsden. The deluxe version of the album featured a behind the scenes documentary &quot;The Making of Silver Rails&quot; which was filmed on location at the studios and directed by Bruce&#x27;s daughter Kyla Simone Bruce. Bruce&#x27;s son Malcolm Bruce pre-produced the album and played guitar on several tracks, while Bruce&#x27;s daughter Aruba Red was featured on &quot;Hidden Cities&quot; singing backing vocals.

===Secondary instruments===

In addition to his primary instruments, Bruce is known to have played the following instruments during his career: 
* Cello – &quot;Rope Ladder to the Moon&quot; (documentary)
* Guitar 
* Harmonica – &quot;Traintime&quot;
*Mellotron – &quot;Silver Rails&quot; 
* Organ – &quot;Rope Ladder to the Moon&quot; 
* Piano – &quot;Theme for an Imaginary Western&quot;

==Personal life==
In 1964, Bruce married Janet Godfrey, who had been the secretary of the Graham Bond Organisation fan club and had collaborated with Bruce on two songs written for the band. The couple had two sons together, Jonas (Jo) Bruce, who grew up to play keyboards in his father&#x27;s band and played with Afro Celt Sound System, and Malcolm Bruce, who grew up to play the guitar with his father and played with Ginger Baker&#x27;s son, Kofi. Jonas died in 1997 from respiratory problems.

In 1982, he married his second wife, Margrit Seyffer, with whom he had two daughters, Natascha, known professionally as Aruba Red and Kyla, and a son, Corin.

==Death==
Bruce died of liver disease on 25 October 2014, in Sudbury, Suffolk, England, aged 71. He was survived by his wife Margrit and four children. Bruce&#x27;s liver cancer was caused by cross addiction to both heroin and alcohol.

His funeral was held in London on 5 November 2014 and was attended by Clapton, Baker and noted musicians Phil Manzanera, Gary Brooker, Vernon Reid and Nitin Sawhney among others. Dozens assembled at the Golders Green Crematorium paying a last tribute singing &quot;Morning Has Broken&quot;, &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; and &quot;Theme for an Imaginary Western&quot;. Bruce&#x27;s remains were later cremated and then interred at a private family ceremony on 31 December 2014 at the crematorium.

==Influence==
Steve Anderson, writing in &quot;The Independent&quot; said: &quot;he became one of the most famous and influential bass players in rock.&quot; Eric Clapton posted on Facebook about Bruce: &quot;He was a great musician and composer, and a tremendous inspiration to me&quot; and composed an acoustic song in his honour. Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi said on Twitter that Bruce had been his favourite bass player, saying &quot;He was a hero to so many&quot; and Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler regarded him as his &quot;biggest influence and favourite bass player&quot;. Rush bassist and singer Geddy Lee wrote: &quot;One of the greatest rock bassists to ever live and a true and profound inspiration to countless musicians. He was one of my first bass heroes and was a major influence on my playing and my music.&quot;

Writing in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in 2008, Dan Cairns had suggested: &quot;many consider him to be one of the greatest bass players of all time.&quot; Writing in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Neil McCormick said, &quot;There was a time when Jack Bruce was synonymous with the bass guitar in rock history, when he was widely revered as the best there was on four strings.&quot; Roger Waters of Pink Floyd described Bruce as &quot;probably the most musically gifted bass player who&#x27;s ever been.&quot;

<text>A Federal Reserve Bank is a regional bank of the Federal Reserve System, the central banking system of the United States. There are twelve in total, one for each of the twelve Federal Reserve Districts that were created by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. The banks are jointly responsible for implementing the monetary policy set forth by the Federal Open Market Committee, and are divided as follows:

Some banks also possess branches, with the whole system being headquartered at the Eccles Building in Washington, D.C.

==History==


The Federal Reserve Banks are the most recent institutions that the United States government has created to provide functions of a central bank. Prior institutions have included the First (1791–1811) and Second (1818–1824) Banks of the United States, the Independent Treasury (1846–1920) and the National Banking System (1863–1935). Several policy questions have arisen with these institutions, including the degree of influence by private interests, the balancing of regional economic concerns, the prevention of financial panics, and the type of reserves used to back currency.

A financial crisis known as the Panic of 1907 threatened several New York banks with failure, an outcome avoided through loans arranged by banker J. P. Morgan. Morgan succeeded in restoring confidence to the New York banking community, but the panic revealed weaknesses in the U.S. financial system, such that a private banker could dictate the terms of a bank&#x27;s survival. In other parts of the country, clearing houses briefly issued their own money notes to carry on business. In response, Congress formed the National Monetary Commission to investigate options for providing currency and credit in future panics. Based on the Commission&#x27;s findings and other proposals, Congress established the Federal Reserve System in which several Federal Reserve Banks would provide liquidity to banks in different regions of the country. The Federal Reserve Banks opened for business in November 1914.

==Legal status==
The Reserve Banks are organized as self-financing corporations and empowered by Congress to distribute currency and regulate its value under policies set by the Federal Open Market Committee and the Board of Governors. Their corporate structure reflects the concurrent interests of the government and the member banks, but neither of these interests amounts to outright ownership.

Legal cases involving the Federal Reserve Banks have concluded that they are &quot;private&quot;, but can be held or deemed as &quot;governmental&quot; depending on the particular law at issue. In &quot;United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation v. Western Union Telegraph Co.&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court stated, &quot;Instrumentalities like the national banks or the federal reserve banks, in which there are private interests, are not departments of the government. They are private corporations in which the government has an interest.&quot; The United States has an interest in the Federal Reserve Banks as tax-exempt federally created instrumentalities whose profits belong to the federal government, but this interest is not proprietary. In &quot;Lewis v. United States&quot;, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit stated that: &quot;The Reserve Banks are not federal instrumentalities for purposes of the FTCA [the Federal Tort Claims Act], but are independent, privately owned and locally controlled corporations.&quot; The opinion went on to say, however, that: &quot;The Reserve Banks have properly been held to be federal instrumentalities for some purposes,&quot; such as anti-bribery law. Another relevant decision is &quot;Scott v. Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City&quot;, in which the distinction is made between Federal Reserve Banks, which are federally created instrumentalities, and the Board of Governors, which is a federal agency.

The original Federal Reserve Act provided starting capital for the Reserve Banks by requiring the participating banks to purchase stock in a Reserve Bank in proportion to their assets. This stock pays a dividend out of the Reserve Bank&#x27;s earnings but otherwise is quite different from common stock in a private corporation. It may not be traded, transferred or borrowed against, and it grants no ownership of the Reserve Bank&#x27;s surplus. A bank&#x27;s stock ownership does not give it proportional voting power to choose the Reserve Bank&#x27;s directors; instead, each member bank receives three ranked votes for six of the Reserve Bank&#x27;s nine directors, who are subject to qualifications defined in the Federal Reserve Act. If a Reserve Bank were ever dissolved or liquidated, the Act states that members would be eligible to redeem their stock up to its purchase value, while any remaining surplus would belong to the federal government.

Regarding the structural relationship between the twelve Federal Reserve banks and the commercial (member) banks, political science professor Michael D. Reagan explains that,

==Function==
The Federal Reserve Banks offer various services to the federal government and the private sector:

* Acting as depositories for bank reserves
* Lending to banks to cover short-term fund deficits, seasonal business cycles, or extraordinary liquidity demands (i.e. runs)
* Collecting and clearing payments between banks
* Issuing banknotes for general circulation as currency
* Administering the deposit accounts of the federal government
* Conducting auctions and buybacks of federal debt
* Purchasing obligations of non-bank entities via emergency credit facilities authorized by the Board of Governors

Historically the Reserve Banks compensated member banks for keeping reserves on deposit (and therefore unavailable for lending) by paying them a dividend from earnings, limited by law to 6 percent. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA) of 2008 additionally authorized the Reserve Banks to pay interest on member bank reserves, while the FAST Act of 2015 imposed an additional dividend limit equal to the yield determined in the most recent 10-year Treasury Note auction.

Although all Reserve Banks have the legal authority to conduct open-market operations, in practice only the Reserve Bank of New York does so. It manages the System Open Market Account (SOMA), a portfolio of government-issued or government-guaranteed securities that is shared among all of the Reserve Banks.

==Finances==
The Federal Reserve Banks fund their own operations, primarily by distributing the earnings from the System Open Market Account. Expenses and dividends paid are typically a small fraction of a Federal Reserve Bank&#x27;s revenue each year. The banks may retain part of their earnings in their own surplus funds that are limited to $7.5 billion, system-wide. The rest must be transferred via the Board of Governors to the Secretary of the Treasury, who then deposits it to the Treasury&#x27;s general fund. When a Reserve Bank&#x27;s earnings are insufficient to cover its expenses and dividends, it introduces a deferred asset on its books to be realized from future earnings.

The Reserve Banks were historically capitalized through deposits of gold, and in 1933 all privately held monetary gold was transferred to them under Executive Order 6102. This gold was in turn transferred to the Treasury under the Gold Reserve Act of 1934 in exchange for gold certificates that may not be redeemed under current law. The Reserve Banks continue to report these certificates as assets, but they do not represent direct gold ownership and the Board of Governors has stated that &quot;the Federal Reserve does not own gold.&quot;

Although the Reserve Banks operate as distinct financial entities, they participate each April in an interdistrict settlement process that has three purposes: settling the payment balances that the Reserve Banks owe each other; allocating ownership of the SOMA portfolio; and establishing uniform gold certificate backing for Federal Reserve Notes. This process connects the Reserve Banks&#x27; different functions – monetary policy, payment clearing and currency issue – as an integrated system.

The Federal Reserve Banks conduct ongoing internal audits of their operations to ensure that their accounts are accurate and comply with the Federal Reserve System&#x27;s accounting principles. The banks are also subject to two types of external auditing. Since 1978 the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has conducted regular audits of the banks&#x27; operations. The GAO audits are reported to the public, but they may not review a bank&#x27;s monetary policy decisions or disclose them to the public. Since 1999 each bank has also been required to submit to an annual audit by an external accounting firm, which produces a confidential report to the bank and a summary statement for the bank&#x27;s annual report. Some members of Congress continue to advocate a more public and intrusive GAO audit of the Federal Reserve System, but Federal Reserve representatives support the existing restrictions to prevent political influence over long-range economic decisions.

The Federal Reserve officially identifies Districts by number and Reserve Bank city.

* 1st District (A): Federal Reserve Bank of Boston
* 2nd District (B): Federal Reserve Bank of New York
* 3rd District (C): Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia
* 4th District (D): Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, with branches in Cincinnati, Ohio and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
* 5th District (E): Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, with branches in Baltimore, Maryland and Charlotte, North Carolina
* 6th District (F): Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, with branches in Birmingham, Alabama; Jacksonville, Florida; Miami, Florida; Nashville, Tennessee; and New Orleans, Louisiana
* 7th District (G): Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, with a branch in Detroit, Michigan.
* 8th District (H): Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, with branches in Little Rock, Arkansas; Louisville, Kentucky; and Memphis, Tennessee
* 9th District (I): Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, with a branch in Helena, Montana
* 10th District (J): Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, with branches in Denver, Colorado; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and Omaha, Nebraska
* 11th District (K): Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, with branches in El Paso, Texas; Houston, Texas; and San Antonio, Texas
* 12th District (L): Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, with branches in Los Angeles, California; Portland, Oregon; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Seattle, Washington

The New York Federal Reserve district is the largest by asset value. San Francisco, followed by Kansas City and Minneapolis, represent the largest geographical districts. Missouri is the only state to have two Federal Reserve Banks (Kansas City and St. Louis). California, Florida, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Texas are the only states which have two or more Federal Reserve Bank branches seated within their states, with Missouri, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee having branches of two different districts within the same state. In the 12th District, the Seattle Branch serves Alaska, and the San Francisco Bank serves Hawaii. New York, Richmond, and San Francisco are the only banks that oversee non-U.S. state territories. The System serves these territories as follows: the New York Bank serves the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands; the Richmond Bank serves the District of Columbia; the San Francisco Bank serves American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The Board of Governors last revised the branch boundaries of the System in February 1996.

<text>Egersund is a town in Eigersund municipality in Rogaland county, Norway. The town is located along the southwestern coast of Norway, about south of the city of Stavanger. The town is situated along a strait which separates the mainland from the island of Eigerøya. From 1838 until 1964, the town was also an independent municipality.

The town has a population (2019) of 11,433 and a population density of .

Egersund has one of the best natural harbours in Norway, and it used to be the largest harbour in Norway when measured in quantity of fish brought in each year (surpassed by Ålesund in 2006). The tidal range, the difference in height between high tide and low tide, is practically zero due to the presence of an amphidromic point. Several internationally known companies have divisions here, like Navico (earlier Robertson autopilots) and Jeppesen Norway formerly C-MAP Norway (producer of electronic sea-maps). In addition, the Aker Solutions corporation owns and runs a large installation here which specializes in the building of parts for oil platforms. Most of the industry is related to the sea and to boats.

==History==
===Early history===
People have lived around the area of Egersund since the Stone Age. There are several places around Egersund where one can find ruins of settlements dating back to the age of migrations in Norway (400–600 BC).

===Middle Ages===
There used to be a church here, the Church of St. Mary, mentioned in 1292 in a privilege of indulgence issued in Rome on 5 February 1292 by Pope Nicholas IV as &quot;Ecclesia beatæ Mariæ de Eikundarsund&quot;. It was the first church in Egersund, and was the parish church of the St. Mary parish. It is believed to have been located where the present Egersund Church stands today. Old folklore from Egersund also says that before the Church of St. Mary, an altar where people sacrificed to the old Norse gods was placed here, but this has not been verified from any sources except old stories.

There was also a chapel, the chapel of St. Laurenti, mentioned in a letter issued on 5 February 1308 as &quot;Ecclesia beati Laurentii de Eikundarsund&quot;, where Pope Clement V gives King Håkon V Magnusson extensive privileges concerning the King&#x27;s 14 chapels (including the chapel of St. Laurenti), which was founded by himself or his father, King Magnus Lagabøte, and his grandfather, King Håkon Håkonson. Since these chapels often were built on the king&#x27;s estates, it is presumed to have been on grounds owned by the Husaby estate. An old tradition says it was located at what is now &quot;Strandgata 43&quot;, but the exact position is somewhat uncertain.

===17th and 18th centuries===

In 1623 the old church (probably the Church of St. Mary) was demolished and a new Egersund Church was erected. This building still stands today.

On 18 July 1798, the village of Egersund was established as a ladested with its own customs office.

===19th and 20th centuries===
The ladested of Egersund was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 under the new formannskapsdistrikt law. This effectively gave Egersund the municipal self-government that was now uniformly given to all areas of Norway.

In 1843, a fire destroyed two thirds of the town, allowing a major redesign of streets. In 1847, Johan Feyer founded A/S Egersunds Fayancefabriks Co., which became the town&#x27;s major employer until closing in 1979.

On 7 July 1859, there was another major fire, and another again on 20 October 1862. This was the last major town fire, since town planners finally understood wooden structures&#x27; vulnerability and reconstructed buildings using extra wide streets to prevent fires from spreading.

In 1878, the Jærensbanen railway line between Egersund and the city of Stavanger opened with Egersund Station in the center of the town. In 1905, Egersund became the first town in Rogaland county to get electrical lighting.

On 9 April 1940, the German military invaded Norway and they occupy Egersund during World War II. Egersund had strategic importance because of its harbour, as well as because the telegraph line between Norway and England was situated there. The Germans built large camps in the area. The occupation lasted until the end of the war.

In 1947, the town was growing rapidly, and an area of the neighboring municipality of Eigersund (population: 515) was transferred into the town of Egersund.

During the 1960s, the Schei Committee met in Norway to discuss the municipal structure in the nation. It was decided that the number of cities and municipalities in Norway was too large, so on 1 January 1965, the town of Egersund lost its status as a self-governing municipality. On that date, the following places were all merged into the new, larger municipality of Eigersund, with the town of Egersund as the new administrative centre:
*the town of Egersund (population: 3,787)
*the municipality of Eigersund (population: 4,664)
*the municipality of Helleland (population: 851)
*the Gyadalen and Grøsfjell areas in the municipality of Heskestad (population: 114)

===Name===
The town (originally the parish) is named after the Eigersundet strait (). The first element is the genitive case of the name of the island of &quot;Eikund&quot; (now Eigerøya). The name of the island comes from the word which means &quot;oak&quot; followed by the suffix which means &quot;plentiful of&quot; (i.e. &quot;the island covered with oak trees&quot;). The last element is which means &quot;strait&quot; or &quot;sound&quot;. The name is among the oldest place names in Norway. It can already be found in the form &quot;Eikundarsund&quot; in the Norse saga of Olav the Holy, written by Icelandic author Snorri Sturlasson in the 13th century. From around the year 1000 Olav the Holy&#x27;s fleet was here often. We can also find the name in texts and scaldic poems from Olav&#x27;s saga.

;&quot;Egersund&quot; vs. &quot;Eigersund&quot;
During the 1910s, the name of the municipality was changed from &quot;Egersund&quot; to &quot;Eigersund&quot;, but the town of Egersund within Eigersund Municipality kept the old spelling. The form of the name spelled without the diphthong [ei] (&quot;Egersund&quot;) is the Danish language form of the name and at that time the municipal name was changed to use the Norwegian language form. The town kept the old spelling for historic purposes.

==Municipal self-government (1838-1964)==
From 1838 until 1964 when the town of Egersund was an independent municipality, it was responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment, social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. During its existence, this municipality was governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor was indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council.

===Municipal council===
The municipal council of Egersund was made up of representatives that were elected to four year terms. The party breakdown of the final municipal council was as follows:
