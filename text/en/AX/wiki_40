<text>The Fourmost are an English Merseybeat band that recorded in the 1960s. Their biggest UK hit single was &quot;A Little Loving&quot; in 1964.

==Biography==
Guitarist/vocalist Brian O&#x27;Hara and best friend guitarist/vocalist Joey Bower (born Joseph Bower, 17 November 1939, Dingle, Liverpool, Lancashire) formed the Two Jays in 1957. The group changed its name to the Four Jays in September 1959 when bass guitarist/singer Billy Hatton and drummer Brian Redman (born 21 June 1941, Huyton, Liverpool, Lancashire) joined the group. The Four Jays played at the Cavern Club on 1 March 1961. Rhythm guitarist/singer Mike Millward (ex-the Undertakers) joined the Four Jays in November 1961, followed by drummer/singer Dave Lovelady in September 1962. The band changed its name to the Fourmost in October 1962. On 30 June 1963, the group signed a management contract with Brian Epstein. This led to their being auditioned by George Martin and signed to EMI&#x27;s Parlophone record label.

With Epstein as their manager, the Fourmost had access to early Lennon–McCartney compositions. The Fourmost&#x27;s first two singles were written by John Lennon. &quot;Hello Little Girl&quot;, one of the earliest Lennon songs, was released on 30 August 1963 and reached No. 9 in the UK Singles Chart. Their follow-up single, &quot;I&#x27;m in Love&quot; (Lennon–McCartney), was released on 15 November 1963 and reached No. 17 in the UK. It was also notable as one of the earliest Beatles-penned songs to be released in the United States but, as with the Fourmost&#x27;s other singles, it failed to chart there.

Their biggest hit followed. &quot;A Little Loving&quot;, written by Russ Alquist, reached No. 6 in the UK Singles Chart in mid-1964. From then on, none of the group&#x27;s singles cracked the Top 20 in the UK. &quot;How Can I Tell Her&quot; was followed by a cover version of the Four Tops&#x27; &quot;Baby I Need Your Loving&quot;, sung by Millward, while Hatton took lead vocal on &quot;Everything in the Garden&quot; and &quot;Girls Girls Girls&quot; (first recorded by the Coasters and a hit for Elvis Presley). O&#x27;Hara composed most of their songs, which were used as B-sides including &quot;Waitin&#x27; for You&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s Only What They Say&quot;, &quot;He Could Never&quot;, and &quot;You Got That Way&quot;.

On the group&#x27;s only 1960s album, &quot;First and Fourmost&quot;, from September 1965, they covered Jackie DeShannon&#x27;s, &quot;Till You Say You&#x27;ll Be Mine&quot;. Other tracks included &quot;My Block&quot; sung by Hatton and written by Jimmy Radcliffe, Carl Spencer and Bert Berns (originally a hit for the Chiffons in 1963), Millward sang a re-make of &quot;The In Crowd&quot;, which featured the brass section from Sounds Incorporated, and Hatton sang cover versions of Little Richard&#x27;s &quot;The Girl Can&#x27;t Help It&quot; and &quot;Heebie-Jeebies&quot;. The band appeared in the 1965 film &quot;Ferry Cross the Mersey&quot; and on the soundtrack album of the same name singing &quot;I Love You Too&quot; (which appeared in two differing versions from mono to stereo).

In early 1966, the band was rocked by the sudden death of rhythm guitarist/vocalist Mike Millward from leukaemia. They recruited George Peckham as replacement. In August 1966, the Fourmost covered another Beatles song, &quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot;, followed by a cover of George Formby&#x27;s &quot;Auntie Maggie&#x27;s Remedy&quot; in November 1966. The latter song was representative of a comedic element to some of the group&#x27;s recordings. Peckham wrote and sang the country-influenced &quot;Turn the Lights Down Low&quot; (the B-side of &quot;Auntie Maggie&#x27;s Remedy&quot;), a short-lived effort to branch out to less pop-oriented fare.

In 1968, now on the CBS record label, they recorded &quot;Apples, Peaches And Pumpkin Pie&quot;, an R&amp;B hit by Jay &amp; the Techniques, followed by &quot;Rosetta&quot; (suggested by Paul McCartney, who played piano on it), and &quot;Easy Squeezy&quot;. The group soon stopped recording, and became popular on the cabaret circuit. Peckham left the band in 1969 to run a recording studio. Joey Bower returned to the band as replacement. A later private pressing album, &quot;The Fourmost&quot; – featuring O&#x27;Hara, Hatton, Lovelady and Bower – included covers such as &quot;Without You&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got You Under My Skin&quot;, &quot;Rag Doll&quot; and &quot;Save the Last Dance for Me&quot;; it was sold at their shows in 1975.

Hatton, Lovelady and Bower all left in 1980 while O&#x27;Hara continued the group with new members, although a version of the band featuring O&#x27;Hara with Hatton and Lovelady did once perform at the new Cavern Club. O&#x27;Hara eventually dropped out, selling the band&#x27;s name. A later line-up featuring longtime bassist/singer Bill Haisman (who had been in the later group alongside O&#x27;Hara) plus John Richards (lead guitar, vocals), Gary Pearson (guitar, vocals) and Kevin Clarkson (drums, vocals) released a DVD and CD titled &quot;The Fourmost Live at The Club Tropicana&quot;, featuring a recording of a show in Skegness on 7 April 2007. They performed both &quot;Hello Little Girl&quot; and &quot;A Little Loving&quot; among other covers of 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s hit songs. Charley Records later issued a 20-track compilation album also titled &quot;First and Fourmost&quot;, while EMI Records later released a CD stereo/mono version of the original 1965 album in 1999. Brian O&#x27;Hara took his own life the same year. In 2005, they also released a 33-track CD compilation &quot;The Best of The Fourmost&quot;, which included the stereo version of &quot;I Love You Too&quot;, and four previously unreleased songs with booklet notes written by Hatton. 

In 2008, Hatton and Lovelady lost a court case to own the trademark on &quot;The Fourmost&quot; name, to the iteration of the band dating back to when they both left in 1978. In the following years afterwards, the two toured as &quot;The Original Fourmost&quot;.

Hatton died in 2017.

In 2018, the Fourmost completed a 59-date theatre tour on the Sensational 60s Experience Tour along with other acts from that period.

<text>Floaters or eye floaters are sometimes visible deposits (e.g., the shadows of tiny structures of protein or other cell debris projected onto the retina) within the eye&#x27;s vitreous humour (&quot;the vitreous&quot;), which is normally transparent, or between the vitreous and retina. 
They can become particularly noticeable when looking at a blank surface or an open monochromatic space, such as blue sky.
Each floater can be measured by its size, shape, consistency, refractive index, and motility. They are also called &quot;muscae volitantes&quot; (Latin for &#x27;flying flies&#x27;), or &quot;mouches volantes&quot; (from the same phrase in French). The vitreous usually starts out transparent, but imperfections may gradually develop as one ages. The common type of floater, present in most people&#x27;s eyes, is due to these degenerative changes of the vitreous. The perception of floaters, which may be annoying or problematic to some people, is known as myodesopsia, or, less commonly, as &quot;myodaeopsia&quot;, &quot;myiodeopsia&quot;, or &quot;myiodesopsia&quot;. It is not often treated, except in severe cases, where vitrectomy (surgery), laser vitreolysis, and medication may be effective.

Floaters are visible either because of the shadows that imperfections cast on the retina, or because of the refraction of light that passes through them, and can appear alone or together with several others as a clump in one&#x27;s visual field. They may appear as spots, threads, or fragments of &quot;cobwebs&quot;, which float slowly before the observer&#x27;s eyes, and move especially in the direction the eyes move. As these objects exist within the eye itself, they are not optical illusions but are entoptic phenomena (caused by the eye itself). They are not to be confused with visual snow, which is similar to the static on a television screen, although these two conditions may co-exist as part of a number of &quot;visual disturbances&quot; which include starbursts, trails, and afterimages.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Floaters are from objects in pockets of liquid within the vitreous humour, the thick fluid or gel that fills the eye, or between the vitreous and the retina. The vitreous humour, or vitreous body, is a jelly-like, transparent substance that fills the majority of the eye. It lies within the vitreous chamber behind the lens, and is one of the four optical components of the eye. Thus, floaters follow the rapid motions of the eye, while drifting slowly within the pocket of liquid. When they are first noticed, the natural reaction is to attempt to look directly at them. However, attempting to shift one&#x27;s gaze toward them can be difficult because floaters follow the motion of the eye, remaining to the side of the direction of gaze. Floaters are, in fact, visible only because they do not remain perfectly fixed within the eye. Although the blood vessels of the eye also obstruct light, they are invisible under normal circumstances because they are fixed in location relative to the retina, and the brain &quot;tunes out&quot; stabilized images through neural adaptation.

Floaters are particularly noticeable when looking at a blank surface or an open monochromatic space, such as blue sky. Despite the name &quot;floaters&quot;, many of these specks have a tendency to sink toward the bottom of the eyeball, in whichever way the eyeball is oriented; the supine position (looking up or lying back) tends to concentrate them near the fovea, which is the center of gaze, while the textureless and evenly lit sky forms an ideal background against which to view them. The brightness of the daytime sky also causes the eyes&#x27; pupils to contract, reducing the aperture, which makes floaters less blurry and easier to see.

Floaters present at birth usually remain lifelong, while those that appear later may disappear within weeks or months. They are not uncommon, and do not cause serious problems for most people. A survey of optometrists in 2002 suggested that an average of 14 patients per month per optometrist presented with symptoms of floaters in the UK. However, floaters are more than a nuisance and a distraction to those with severe cases, especially if the spots seem constantly to drift through the field of vision. The shapes are shadows projected onto the retina by tiny structures of protein or other cell debris discarded over the years and trapped in the vitreous humour or between the vitreous and retina. Floaters can even be seen when the eyes are closed on especially bright days, when sufficient light penetrates the eyelids to cast the shadows. It is not, however, only elderly persons who are troubled by floaters; they can also become a problem to younger people, especially if they are myopic. They are also common after cataract or clear lens extraction operations or after trauma.

Floaters are able to catch and refract light in ways that somewhat blur vision temporarily until the floater moves to a different area. Often they trick persons who are troubled by floaters into thinking they see something out of the corner of their eye that really is not there. Most people come to terms with the problem, after a time, and learn to ignore their floaters. For persons with severe floaters it is nearly impossible to ignore completely the large masses that constantly stay within almost direct view.

In the case of young people, particularly those under 35, symptomatic floaters are likely suspended within a posterior region of the eye known as the pre-macular bursa. Such floaters appear well-defined and usually bear the appearance of a &#x27;crystal worm&#x27; or cobweb. Due to their proximity to the retina, the floaters have a significant effect on the visual field for patients. In addition, such floaters are often in the central visual axis as it moves with the intravitreal currents of the eye. Research on floaters of the pre-macular bursa is minimal, and safe treatment for patients with this disturbance that does not warrant major vitrectomy has yet to be discovered. Moreover, the cause and prognosis for such floaters also remains to be found. Some doctors suggest such floaters may resolve over time, should the floaters move away from the retina.

== Causes ==
There are various causes for the appearance of floaters, of which the most common are described here.

Floaters can occur when eyes age; in rare cases, floaters may be a sign of retinal detachment or a retinal tear.

=== Vitreous syneresis ===
Vitreous syneresis (liquefaction) and contraction with age can cause vitreous floaters. Additionally, trauma or injury to the globe can cause them.

=== Vitreous detachments ===

As part of the normal human aging process the liquefied vitreous body loses support and contracts. This leads to posterior vitreous detachment in which the vitreous membrane is released from the sensory retina. During this detachment, the shrinking vitreous can stimulate the retina mechanically, causing the patient to see random flashes across the visual field, sometimes referred to as &quot;flashers&quot;, a symptom more formally referred to as photopsia. The ultimate release of the vitreous around the optic nerve head sometimes makes a large floater appear, usually in the shape of a ring (&quot;Weiss ring&quot;).

Posterior vitreous detachment is more common in people who:
* are nearsighted;
* have undergone cataract surgery or clear lens extraction;
* have had surgery of the eye;
* have had inflammation inside the eye.

=== Retinal detachment ===
As a complication of Vitreous detachment, part of the retina might be torn off by the departing vitreous membrane causing a retinal detachment. A retinal tear may also allow fluid to leak behind the retina, causing it to detach. This will often leak blood into the vitreous, which is seen by the patient as a sudden appearance of numerous small black dots or ribbons moving across the field of vision. Sometimes a gray curtain may appear to partially block vision in one eye. Retinal detachment requires immediate medical attention, as it can easily cause blindness. Consequently, both the appearance of flashes and the sudden onset of numerous small floaters should be rapidly investigated by an eye care provider, preferably a retinal ophthalmologist.

=== Regression of the hyaloid artery ===
The hyaloid artery, an artery running through the vitreous humour during the fetal stage of development, regresses in the third trimester of pregnancy. Its disintegration can sometimes leave cell matter.

=== Other common causes ===
Patients with retinal tears may experience floaters if red blood cells are released from leaky blood vessels, and those with uveitis or vitritis, as in toxoplasmosis, may experience multiple floaters and decreased vision due to the accumulation of white blood cells in the vitreous humour.

Other causes for floaters include cystoid macular edema and asteroid hyalosis. The latter is an anomaly of the vitreous humour, whereby calcium clumps attach themselves to the collagen network. The bodies that are formed in this way move slightly with eye movement, but then return to their fixed position.

== Diagnosis ==
Floaters are often readily observed by an ophthalmologist or an optometrist with the use of an ophthalmoscope or slit lamp. However, if the floater is near the retina, it may not be visible to the observer even if it appears large to the patient.

Increasing background illumination or using a pinhole to effectively decrease pupil diameter may allow a person to obtain a better view of his or her own floaters. The head may be tilted in such a way that one of the floaters drifts towards the central axis of the eye. In the sharpened image the fibrous elements are more conspicuous.

The presence of retinal tears with new onset of floaters was surprisingly high (14%; 95% confidence interval, 12–16%) as reported in a meta-analysis published as part of the Rational Clinical Examination Series in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Patients with new onset flashes and/or floaters, especially when associated with visual loss or restriction in the visual field, should seek more urgent ophthalmologic evaluation.

== Treatment ==
While surgeries do exist to correct for severe cases of floaters, there are no medications (including eye drops) that can correct for this vitreous deterioration. Floaters are often caused by the normal aging process and will usually become less bothersome as a person learns to ignore them. Looking up/down and left/right will cause the floaters to leave the direct field of vision as the vitreous humour swirls around due to the sudden movement. If floaters significantly increase in numbers and/or severely affect vision, then one of the treatments below may be necessary.

, insufficient evidence is available to compare the safety and efficacy of surgical vitrectomy with laser vitreolysis for the treatment of floaters. A 2017 Cochrane Review did not find any relevant studies that compared the two treatments.

Aggressive marketing campaigns have promoted the use of laser vitreolysis for the treatment of floaters. No strong evidence currently exists for the treatment of floaters with laser vitreolysis. The strongest available evidence comparing these two treatment modalities are retrospective case series.

=== Surgery ===
Vitrectomy may be successful in treating more severe cases. The technique usually involves making three openings through the part of the sclera known as the pars plana. Of these small gauge instruments, one is an infusion port to resupply a saline solution and maintain the pressure of the eye, the second is a fiber optic light source, and the third is a vitrector. The vitrector has a reciprocating cutting tip attached to a suction device. This design reduces traction on the retina via the vitreous material. A variant sutureless, self-sealing technique is sometimes used.

Like most invasive surgical procedures, however, vitrectomy carries a risk of complications, including: retinal detachment, anterior vitreous detachment and macular edema – which can threaten vision or worsen existing floaters (in the case of retinal detachment).

=== Laser vitreolysis ===
Laser vitreolysis is a possible treatment option for the removal of vitreous strands and opacities (floaters). In this procedure an ophthalmic laser (usually a yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG) laser) applies a series of nanosecond pulses of low-energy laser light to evaporate the vitreous opacities and to sever the vitreous strands. When performed with a YAG laser designed specifically for vitreolysis, reported side effects and complications associated with vitreolysis are rare. However, YAG lasers have traditionally been designed for use in the anterior portion of the eye, i.e. posterior capsulotomy and iridotomy treatments. As a result, they often provide a limited view of the vitreous, which can make it difficult to identify the targeted floaters and membranes. They also carry a high risk of damage to surrounding ocular tissue. Accordingly, vitreolysis is not widely practised, being performed by very few specialists. One of them, John Karickhoff, has performed the procedure more than 1,400 times and claims a 90 percent success rate. However, the MedicineNet web site states that &quot;there is no evidence that this [laser treatment] is effective. The use of a laser also poses significant risks to the vision in what is otherwise a healthy eye.&quot;

=== Medication ===
Enzymatic vitreolysis has been trialed to treat vitreomacular adhesion (VMA) and anomalous posterior vitreous detachment. Although the mechanism of action may have an effect on clinically significant floaters, there are no clinical trials being undertaken to determine whether this may be a therapeutic alternative to either conservative management or vitrectomy.

=== Atropine ===
Dropping low doses of atropine onto the eye dilates the pupil, thus reducing shadow formation on the retina by floaters.

== Research ==
The VDM project aims to find an effective, low-risk treatment for floaters. So far, there have been studies using colloidal gold or indocyanine green (ICG) injected into the eye followed by a low-energy laser to target problematic floaters, and this has shown to be successful on vitreous opacities obtained during vitrectomy and in rabbits.

==Epidemiology==
A vitreous detachment typically affects patients older than the age of 50 and increases in prevalence by age 80. Individuals who are myopic or nearsighted have an increased risk of vitreous floaters. Additionally, eyes with an inflammatory disease after direct trauma to the globe or have recently undergone eye surgery have an increased chance of developing a vitreous floater. Men and women appear to be affected equally.

==In other animals==
It has been theorized that non-human animals are capable of seeing floaters, as most mammals have anatomically similar eye structures to humans. However, floaters in animals are capable of damaging their vision. Animals with synchysis have an increased risk for retinal detachment and may also require surgery.

<doc id="179638" wikidata="Q5433125" url="?curid=179638" title="Family Fortunes">
<text>Family Fortunes is a British television game show based on the American game show &quot;Family Feud&quot;. The programme ran on ITV from 6 January 1980 to 6 December 2002. A celebrity version, &quot;All Star Family Fortunes&quot;, followed from 2006 to 2015. In 2020, the original version of the show returned after 17 years with Gino D&#x27;Acampo as host which ran until 2023. A third series of 10 episodes was planned for broadcast but was shelved in February 2025 following sexual allegations aimed towards D&#x27;Acampo on other ITV shows. It was later replaced by the 2024 reboot of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, hosted by Graham Norton. On 17 February 2025, it was rumored that comedian, television presenter and actor Joel Dommett wants to replace D&#x27;Acampo as the new presenter of &quot;Family Fortunes&quot;.

The game involves two families each consisting of five members providing answers to &#x27;everyday questions&#x27; that were surveyed by 100 members of the British public before the show to win prizes (mainly cash). The top answers to the surveys are displayed on a large electronic board, christened by Bob Monkhouse as &quot;Mr. Babbage&quot;.

Monkhouse was responsible for changing the name of the show to &quot;Family Fortunes&quot; as he felt that &quot;feud&quot; sounded too aggressive.

==Hosts and presentation==
&quot;Family Fortunes&quot; was first hosted by comedian Bob Monkhouse (1980–83), followed by singer and entertainer Max Bygraves (1983–85). The show returned on 27 June 1987 with Les Dennis as presenter and remained on air for the next 15 years. It was then moved to a daily daytime slot, hosted by Andy Collins.

The most well-known aspects of the show are the large computer screen (named &quot;Mr Babbage&quot; by original host Bob Monkhouse) and the famous computerised sound used when wrong answers are given. The computer screen name, &quot;Mr Babbage&quot;, was in recognition of the English mathematician, philosopher, inventor and mechanical engineer Charles Babbage, who originated the concept of a programmable computer. During the Monkhouse and Bygraves era, the board was also used to show the closing credits at the end of the episode. In 1987, a completely different board was used for the first Dennis series, however a board similar to the original Mr Babbage one was used from the following year until its end in 2002. Both the All-Star and 2020 versions use a video wall for the board.

==Format==
Two family teams, each consisting of five members, are asked to guess the results of surveys in which 100 people would be asked open-ended questions (e.g., &quot;We asked 100 people to name any animal that lives wild in the United Kingdom&quot; or &quot;We asked 100 people to name a food you smell to be sure it&#x27;s fresh&quot;). Although rarely acknowledged during the programme, the 100 people surveyed are invariably audience members who have volunteered before the show or the families themselves who would be asked questions for the next series.

Each round begins with a member of each family (in rotation, meaning all players do this at least once) approaching the podium. As the question is read, the first of the two nominees to hit the buzzer gives an answer. If it is not the most popular answer, the other nominee is asked. If both nominees fail to give an answer that is on the board, the next members of each family are chosen to answer the question, starting in the same order as the first two nominees. The family with the more popular answer then chooses whether to &quot;play&quot; the question or &quot;pass&quot; control to the other family.

The host then passes down the line of the controlling team, asking for an answer from each member. After each answer, the board reveals whether it features. If not or if they can not come up with an answer in time, the family is charged with a strike (marked with an X), losing control of the board upon their third strike (officially known as striking out in the official rules) in the round. If a family manages to come up with all the answers before striking out, they win the amount in pounds of the total number of people who had given the answers.

If a family strikes out, the opponent is given the chance to &quot;steal&quot; by coming up with an answer that may be amongst those missing. Only the head family member (the first family member or the designated captain) may give the answer after consultation. If the answer is present, this family wins the round and is said to have &quot;stolen&quot; the money. Otherwise, the family that plays the board keeps the money.

On celebrity specials, each top answer adds a bonus of £200 (later £250) to that family&#x27;s charity.

===Double Money===
Following three rounds before a commercial break (two rounds in series 1), &quot;Double Money&quot; is played. Gameplay is the same as in the first rounds, but each answer is now worth £2 for each person who said it, and there are generally fewer possible answers. The family who passed £300 (£200 in series 1) first goes through to play &quot;Big Money&quot; (known in some overseas versions as &quot;Fast Money&quot;) for the jackpot. On the 2020 revival, the fifth and sixth questions score double points (for the sixth question, each family nominates one person to answer the question from the podium) and the losing family receives £2 per point and a &quot;Family Fortunes buzzer&quot; doorbell. The winning family would be guaranteed ten times their winning score.

===Big Money===
This involves two contestants (out of the five in the family team) answering five questions that fit with those given by the 100 people surveyed each within a narrow time limit. The first contestant answers the five questions within 15 seconds (20 in the revival). Then the second contestant (who was out of earshot) answers within 20 seconds (25 in the revival), the extra time being to allow for the likelihood of them repeating the first contestant&#x27;s answer. If this happens, they are asked for another one. Each point gives the family £2 (£10 per point in the revival), up to £398 (£1,990 in the revival), and those points would be added to their earlier winnings. If they get 200 points or more from the ten answers, they then win the top cash prize.

From 1994 onwards, a bonus star prize was available for naming all five &quot;top&quot; (most popular) answers and scoring 200 points. The star prize couldn&#x27;t be won if they failed to score at least 200 points even if all five top answers had been named.

In the 2020 revival, the top answers were not revealed until after the second contestant gave their answers and their point values were shown, an element that was previously seen in the &quot;All-Stars&quot; version of the show.

==Cash and prizes==
The top cash prize in &quot;Big Money&quot; during the first series (1980) was £1,000. From the second series (1981), the prize started at £1,000, then rose by £500 weekly if no one won, to a limit of £3,000 (£2,500 from 1981 to 1982), which it could stay at for more than one week if it still was not won. Once the prize was won, it reverted to £1,000 for the next edition. In the 1987 series, it started at £1,000 and, if not won, rose by £1,000 per week to a maximum of £3,000. From the 1988 series, the prize was fixed at £3,000. After the abolition of the IBA&#x27;s prize limits, the top prize rose to £5,000 from 1996. The money had to be shared out between contestants.

The bonus star prize was always a family car between 1994 and 1998. From 1998 to 2002, contestants had the choice of either a car or a holiday for up to twelve people. The car suppliers were Honda in 1994, SEAT in 1995 and Daewoo between 1996 and 2002. On the all-star specials, 200 points along with all five top responses donated £5,000 to both teams.

During the programme&#x27;s brief daytime run in 2002, the prize values were reduced significantly. If the contestants scored over 200 points, they won £1,000 and if they found five top answers, it was increased to £3,000. As with the previous prizes, the £3,000 could only be won if the family scored 200+ points.

In the 2020 revival, the top cash prize is £10,000, which would be tripled to £30,000 if one or both contestants named all of the top answers.

From the second series in 1981 onward, spot prizes were available in the main game, turning up seemingly at random when certain answers were found. These ranged from household appliances like washing machines, vacuum cleaners and toasters, to home entertainment goods such as televisions, video cassette recorders and camcorders. During the two series hosted by Bygraves, if a contestant won a music prize such as a record player, he would usually throw in one of his own LP&#x27;s as a bonus. In later series, when prize limits were lifted, some of the spot prizes on offer included short weekend breaks away or shopping vouchers.

====Series 18====

==&quot;All Star Family Fortunes&quot;==
A celebrity revival of the show presented by Vernon Kay began airing on 28 October 2006 and ended on 14 June 2015 after its eleventh series.

===Format===
In this version, the game ends after four rounds (five during the hour-long series with two or three Single and two Double), ignoring the &#x27;first to 300 points&#x27; rule that the previous incarnations employed, and the losing family receives a consolation prize of the greater of £1,000 or £10 times their score (£3 per point in series 1). Also in Big Money, the celebrity automatically plays the final, meaning that only one other member needs to be picked. If they get 200 points or more from the ten answers, they win £10,000 for their chosen charity, which would be tripled if they get all five top answers, and if they score less than 200 points, those points plus their earlier score would be multiplied by £10 (£3 per point in series 1).

<doc id="179643" wikidata="Q286525" url="?curid=179643" title="Cilla Black">
<text>Priscilla Maria Veronica Willis (27 May 1943 – 1 August 2015), better known as Cilla Black, was an English singer and television presenter.

Championed by her friends the Beatles, Black began her career as a singer in 1963. Her singles &quot;Anyone Who Had a Heart&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re My World&quot; both reached number one in the UK in 1964. She had 11 top 10 hits on the UK Singles Chart between then and 1971 and an additional eight hits that made the top 40. In May 2010, new research published by BBC Radio 2 showed that her version of &quot;Anyone Who Had a Heart&quot; was the UK&#x27;s biggest-selling single by a female artist in the 1960s. &quot;You&#x27;re My World&quot; reached No. 14 in Canada and was also a modest hit in the U.S., peaking at No. 26 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Along with a successful recording career in the 1960s and early 1970s, Black hosted her own BBC variety show, &quot;Cilla&quot; (1968–1976). After a brief time as a comedy actress, she became a prominent television presenter in the 1980s and 1990s, hosting hit entertainment shows such as &quot;Blind Date&quot; (1985–2003), &quot;Surprise Surprise&quot; (1984–2001) and &quot;The Moment of Truth&quot; (1998–2001). In 2013, Black celebrated 50 years in show business. ITV honoured this milestone with a one-off entertainment special which aired on 16 October 2013, &quot;The One and Only Cilla Black&quot;, featuring Black herself and hosted by Paul O&#x27;Grady.

Black died on 1 August 2015 aged 72, after a fall in her holiday villa in Estepona, in Spain. The day after her funeral, the compilation album &quot;The Very Best of Cilla Black&quot; (2013) went to number one on the UK Albums Chart and the New Zealand Albums Chart; it was her first number one album. In 2017, a statue of Black commissioned by her sons was unveiled outside the Cavern Club&#x27;s original entrance.

==Early life==
Black was born Priscilla Maria Veronica White in the Vauxhall district of Liverpool on 27 May 1943, the daughter of Priscilla Blythen (1911–1996) and John Patrick White (1904–1971). She grew up in the Scotland Road area of Vauxhall. Her maternal grandfather, Joseph Henry Blythen (1883–1966), was born to Irish parents in the Welsh town of Wrexham; all of Black&#x27;s great-grandparents were also Irish. She was raised in a Roman Catholic household and attended St Anthony&#x27;s School in Scotland Road. She later attended Anfield Commercial College, where she learned office skills. Determined to become an entertainer, Black gained a part-time job as a cloakroom attendant at Liverpool&#x27;s Cavern Club, best known for its connection with the Beatles. Her impromptu performances impressed the Beatles and others. She was encouraged to begin singing by a Liverpool promoter, Sam Leach, who booked her first gig at the Zodiac Club on Duke Street, where she appeared as Swinging Cilla, backed by the Big Three. She later also became a guest singer with the Merseybeat bands Rory Storm and the Hurricanes and Kingsize Taylor and the Dominoes. Meanwhile, she worked as a waitress at the Zodiac coffee lounge, where she met her future husband Bobby Willis. She was featured in an article in the first edition of the local music newspaper &quot;Mersey Beat&quot; by the paper&#x27;s publisher, Bill Harry, who mistakenly referred to her as &quot;Cilla Black&quot; rather than her real name. She subsequently decided to keep the name.

==Music career==
===Early fame – the Brian Epstein years===
Black signed her first contract with longtime friend and neighbour Terry McCann, but this contract was never honoured as it was made when she was underage (the age of majority was then 21) and her father subsequently signed her with Brian Epstein.

She was introduced to Epstein by John Lennon, who persuaded him to audition her. Lennon was encouraged by his Aunt Mimi to introduce Black to Epstein. Epstein had a portfolio of local artists but initially showed little interest in her. Her first audition was a failure, partly because of nerves, and partly because the Beatles (who supported her) played the songs in their usual vocal key rather than re-pitching them for Black&#x27;s voice.

In her autobiography &quot;What&#x27;s It All About?&quot; she wrote:I&#x27;d chosen to do &quot;Summertime&quot;, but at the very last moment I wished I hadn&#x27;t. I adored this song, and had sung it when I came to Birkenhead with the Big Three, but I hadn&#x27;t rehearsed it with the Beatles and it had just occurred to me that they would play it in the wrong key. It was too late for second thoughts, though. With one last wicked wink at me, John set the group off playing. I&#x27;d been right to worry. The music was not in my key and any adjustments that the boys were now trying to make were too late to save me. My voice sounded awful. Destroyed—and wanting to die—I struggled on to the end.But after seeing her another day, at the Blue Angel jazz club, Epstein contracted with Black as his only female client on 6 September 1963. Epstein introduced Black to George Martin who signed her to Parlophone Records and produced her début single, &quot;Love of the Loved&quot; (written by Lennon and McCartney), which was released only three weeks after she joined Epstein. Despite an appearance on ABC Weekend TV&#x27;s popular &quot;Thank Your Lucky Stars&quot;, the single peaked at a modest No. 35 in the UK, a relative failure compared to the débuts of Epstein&#x27;s most successful artists (the Beatles, Gerry and the Pacemakers and Billy J. Kramer with the Dakotas).
Black&#x27;s second single, released at the beginning of 1964, was a cover of the Burt Bacharach–Hal David composition &quot;Anyone Who Had a Heart&quot;, which had been written for Dionne Warwick. The single beat Warwick&#x27;s recording into the UK charts and rose to No. 1 in Britain in February 1964 (spending three weeks there), selling 800,000 UK copies in the process. Her second UK No. 1 success, &quot;You&#x27;re My World&quot;, was an English-language rendition of the Italian popular song &quot;Il Mio Mondo&quot; by composer Umberto Bindi. She also enjoyed chart success with the song in America, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, South Africa and Canada. Both songs sold over one million copies worldwide, and were awarded gold discs.

Black&#x27;s two No. 1 successes were followed by the release of another Lennon–McCartney composition, &quot;It&#x27;s for You&quot;, as her fourth UK single. Paul McCartney played piano at the recording session, and the song proved to be another success for Black, peaking at No. 7 on the UK charts. In Canada it reached No. 39.

Black belonged to a generation of British female singers which included Dusty Springfield, Helen Shapiro, Petula Clark, Sandie Shaw, Marianne Faithfull, and Lulu. Other than Clark, these artists were not singer-songwriters but interpreters of 1960s contemporary popular music by songwriters and producers. Black recorded much material during this time, including songs written by Phil Spector, Tim Hardin and Burt Bacharach. All were produced by George Martin at Abbey Road Studios. Randy Newman, writer and composer of &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Wrong Before&quot; which Cilla Black recorded in 1965, was quoted as saying: &quot;Cilla Black&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Wrong Before&quot; is about the best cover record anyone has ever done of my songs.&quot;

Black&#x27;s version of &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feelin&#x27;&quot; (1965) reached No. 2 on the UK charts. A week later the Righteous Brothers&#x27; original version of the same song went to No. 1 while Black&#x27;s version dropped to No. 5. The single wasn&#x27;t critically well received, however; the Rolling Stones&#x27; manager Andrew Loog Oldham took out an advert in the &quot;Melody Maker&quot; to deride Black&#x27;s efforts compared with the original.

Being so closely associated with the Beatles, Black became one of a select group of artists in the 1964–65 period (the others being Billy J. Kramer &amp; the Dakotas and Peter and Gordon) to record more than one Lennon–McCartney composition. Black continued to record Lennon–McCartney compositions throughout her time with Parlophone (1963–1973) and her recordings of &quot;Yesterday&quot;, &quot;For No One&quot; and &quot;Across the Universe&quot; became radio favourites. McCartney said Black&#x27;s 1972 interpretation of &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; was the definitive version of the song.

Black&#x27;s career in the United States, although enthusiastically supported by Epstein and his PR team, was limited to a few television appearances (&quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; among them), a 1965 cabaret season at the Plaza Hotel in New York City, and success with &quot;You&#x27;re My World&quot;, which made it to No. 26 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The song was to be her only American Top 30 chart success, and Elvis Presley had a copy on his personal jukebox at his Graceland home. Black recognised that to achieve popular status in the USA she would need to devote much time to touring there. But she was plagued by homesickness and a sense of loneliness and returned to the UK.

In 1966 Black recorded the Bacharach-David song &quot;Alfie&quot;, written as the signature song to the 1966 feature film of the same name. While Cher sang &quot;Alfie&quot; on the closing credits of the American release of the film and Black on the UK version, Black was the only artist to have a hit with the song in the UK (No. 9). The next year, &quot;Alfie&quot; would become a success for Dionne Warwick in the US. Black&#x27;s version of &quot;Alfie&quot; was arranged and conducted by Bacharach himself at the recording session at Abbey Road. Bacharach insisted on 31 separate takes, and Black cited the session as one of the most demanding of her recording career. For Bacharach&#x27;s part, he said &quot;... there weren&#x27;t too many white singers around, who could convey the emotion that I felt in many of the songs I wrote but that changed with people like Cilla Black&quot;.

By the end of 1966, Black had been a guest on Peter Cook and Dudley Moore&#x27;s show &quot;Not Only... But Also&quot;, had appeared on &quot;The Eamonn Andrews Show&quot;, and in a Ray Galton–Alan Simpson revue in London&#x27;s West End—&quot;Way Out in Piccadilly&quot;—alongside Frankie Howerd, and had starred in the television special &quot;Cilla at the Savoy&quot;, which was one of the most watched music specials of the 1960s.

Epstein&#x27;s attempts to make Black a film actress were less successful. A brief appearance in the beat film &quot;Ferry &#x27;Cross the Mersey&quot; (1965) and a leading role alongside David Warner in the psychedelic comedy &quot;Work Is a Four-Letter Word&quot; (1968) were largely ignored by film critics. In a 1997 interview with &quot;Record Collector&quot; magazine, Black revealed she was asked to appear in the film &quot;The Italian Job&quot; (1969), playing the part of Michael Caine&#x27;s girlfriend, but negotiations fell through between producers and her management over her fee.

Epstein died of an accidental drug overdose in August 1967, not long after negotiating a contract with the BBC for Black to appear in a television series of her own. Relations between Epstein and Black had somewhat soured during the year prior to his death, largely because she felt he was not paying her career enough attention and the fact that her singles &quot;A Fool Am I&quot; (UK No. 13, 1966) and &quot;What Good Am I?&quot; (UK No. 24, 1967) were not big successes.

In her autobiography, Black said that Epstein had tried to pacify her by negotiating a deal that would see her representing the UK in the 1968 Eurovision Song Contest. However, Black refused on the basis that Sandie Shaw had won the previous year&#x27;s contest and that the chances of another British female artist winning were few.

===After Epstein===

Black&#x27;s boyfriend and songwriter Bobby Willis assumed management responsibilities after Epstein died. After the relatively disappointing performance of &quot;I Only Live to Love You&quot; (UK No. 26, 1967), Black hit a new purple patch in her recording career, starting with &quot;Step Inside Love&quot; in 1968 (UK No. 8), which McCartney wrote especially for her as the theme for her new weekly BBC television variety series. Other successes followed in 1969: &quot;Conversations&quot; (UK No. 7), &quot;Surround Yourself with Sorrow&quot; (written by Bill Martin, Phil Coulter, UK No. 3), &quot;If I Thought You&#x27;d Ever Change Your Mind&quot; (No. 20). Black had a further big hit with &quot;Something Tells Me (Something&#x27;s Gonna Happen Tonight)&quot; (UK No. 3) in 1971.

Black&#x27;s association with the Beatles continued. At the 1971 Cannes Film Festival she joined George Harrison, Ringo Starr and singer Marc Bolan to attend a screening of the John Lennon–Yoko Ono experimental film &quot;Erection&quot;. She also holidayed with Harrison and Starr on a trip aboard a yacht chartered by Starr. &quot;Photograph&quot; was written on this trip—originally intended for Black—but Starr decided to record it himself. George Harrison also wrote two songs for Black: &quot;The Light that has Lighted the World&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Still Love You (When Every Song is Sung)&quot;. The latter she recorded during 1974 with her then-producer David Mackay, but it was not heard publicly until 2003 when it was included on a retrospective collection entitled &quot;Cilla: The Best of 1963–78&quot;.

Writing in 1969, the rock music journalist Nik Cohn wrote:
===Later music career===
In 1993 she released &quot;Through the Years&quot;, an album of new material featuring duets with Dusty Springfield, Cliff Richard and Barry Manilow. Ten years later, in 2003, she released the album &quot;Beginnings ... Greatest Hits and New Songs&quot;.

During 2006–07, Black&#x27;s 1971 single &quot;Something Tells Me (Something&#x27;s Gonna Happen Tonight)&quot; was used as the soundtrack to a new British advertising campaign for Ferrero Rocher chocolates. During the 2008–09 pantomime season, Black returned to live musical performance in the pantomime &quot;Cinderella&quot;, appearing as the Fairy Godmother. Black was part of an all-Scouse cast assembled in this three-hour stage spectacular to mark the end of Liverpool&#x27;s year as European Capital of Culture. The show incorporated a number of Black&#x27;s successes, which she performed live, including &quot;You&#x27;re My World&quot;, &quot;Something Tells Me&quot;, &quot;Step Inside Love&quot; and &quot;I Can Sing a Rainbow&quot;. Black received rave reviews for her singing and overall performance.

On 7 September 2009, a total of 13 original studio albums (the first seven produced by George Martin) recorded by Black between 1963 and 2003 were released for digital download. These albums featured an array of musical genres. Also released by EMI at the same time was a double album and DVD set, &quot;The Definitive Collection (A Life in Music)&quot;, featuring rare BBC video footage; a digital download album of specially commissioned re-mixes &quot;Cilla All Mixed Up&quot;; a remixed single on digital download of &quot;Something Tells Me&quot;.

For the 2010 winter pantomime season, Black appeared in &quot;Cinderella&quot; at the Waterside Theatre in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire.

In October 2013, Parlophone (the record label which launched her career in 1963) released the career-spanning CD &quot;The Very Best of Cilla Black&quot;—containing all 19 of her UK Top 40 singles, new club remixes plus a bonus DVD of her 1966 TV music special &quot;Cilla at the Savoy&quot;.

Black was the best-selling British female recording artist in the UK during the 1960s, releasing a total of 15 studio albums and 37 singles.

On 14 February 2020, a previously unreleased Black track titled &quot;You&#x27;re Sensational&quot; was released via Warner Music.

==Television career==
===&quot;Cilla&quot; (BBC TV series)===

Black was offered her own show on the BBC by Bill Cotton, then assistant head of light entertainment. The show would simply be titled &quot;Cilla&quot; and aired from January 1968 to April 1976. Cotton considered Black to take over from Bruce Forsyth as host of &quot;The Generation Game&quot; in 1978, but after a brief conversation, Cotton learned that Black wanted to maintain her singing career and was not ready to change course so drastically to light entertainment hostess. Cotton believed she would have been &quot;perfect&quot; for the show.

===Comedy===

On 15 January 1975 Black performed as the main entertainer of the first of six half-hour situation comedy plays. The series, broadcast by ITV, was entitled &quot;Cilla&#x27;s Comedy Six&quot; and was written by Ronnie Taylor. During May 1975 the Writers&#x27; Guild of Great Britain named Black as Britain&#x27;s Top Female Comedy Star. The following year, ATV was commissioned to film six more plays as the initial series had accrued healthy viewing figures and remained constantly among the highest-scoring three shows of the week. During August 1976 Black reprised her role as a comedy actress in &quot;Cilla&#x27;s World of Comedy&quot; which featured her theme song and new single &quot;Easy in Your Company&quot;.

In 2013 it was announced that Black was set to co-star in a new BBC sitcom &quot;Led Astray&quot;, alongside her friend Paul O&#x27;Grady — the pilot episode was recorded on 31 October 2013. However, the show was shelved because the pair were unable to cope with the long hours of filming.

===London Weekend Television===
By the beginning of the 1980s Black was performing mainly in cabaret and concerts; television appearances were rare. She sang the Gracie Fields song &quot;Walter, Walter (Lead Me to the Altar)&quot; on &quot;The Green Tie on the Little Yellow Dog&quot;, which was recorded in 1982, and broadcast by Channel 4 in 1983.

According to Christopher Biggins&#x27;s autobiography she &quot;stormed back into the public consciousness with a barnstorming performance as a guest on &quot;Wogan&quot; in 1983, proving that we can all have second chances&quot; and after her appearance, people were &quot;desperately trying to find her the right comeback vehicle&quot;. She presented &quot;Cilla Black&#x27;s Christmas&quot; (1983), performing a comedy-duet with Frankie Howerd.

Black signed a contract with London Weekend Television, becoming the host of two of the most popular and long-running evening entertainment shows of the 1980s and 1990s—&quot;Blind Date&quot; (1985–2003) and &quot;Surprise Surprise&quot; (1984–2001). She also presented the game show &quot;The Moment of Truth&quot; (1998–2001). All programmes were mainstream ratings winners and consolidated her position as the highest-paid female performer on British television.

Her television appearances made her spoken mannerisms (&quot;Lorra lorra laughs&quot;, for example) and her habit of referring familiarly to her fellow presenters (&quot;Our Graham&quot;) well known.

===Later television work===
Black&#x27;s most notable television performances after her resignation from London Weekend Television included &quot;Parkinson&quot;, &quot;So Graham Norton&quot;, &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot;, &quot;Room 101&quot; twice (once with Paul Merton and once with his successor as host, Frank Skinner), and a one-off show titled &quot;Cilla Live!&quot; for Living TV. Black was a judge on the first series of the reality TV series &quot;Soapstar Superstar&quot;, featured in an episode of the series &quot;Eating with...&quot; and guest-presented editions of &quot;The Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot; in 2006 and &quot;The Friday Night Project&quot; for Channel 4 in 2007.

In 2006, Black took part in the BBC Wales programme &quot;Coming Home&quot; about her Welsh family history, with roots in Wrexham and Holywell.

In 2008 Black recorded a pilot for the Sky 1 dating show &quot;Loveland&quot;. The show was to be a 10-part &quot;21st-century&quot; dating programme for the following year. Unlike &quot;Blind Date&quot;, contestants would not sit in front of a studio audience, but would be &#x27;hidden&#x27; behind real-time animations as they dated each other. Each episode would conclude with the contestant picking their preferred animated character before meeting the real-life person. Production costs, however, were too high and the show was pulled.

In October 2009 Black guest-anchored &quot;Loose Women&quot; and on 28 November 2009 appeared on Sky 1 to present &quot;TV&#x27;s Greatest Endings&quot;.

Between September 2010 and June 2011 she made guest panellist appearances and in 2011 also appeared, as herself, in the first episode of series 4 of ITV&#x27;s &quot;Benidorm&quot;.

===50 years in showbusiness===
ITV honoured Black&#x27;s 50 years in show business with a one-off entertainment special which aired on 16 October 2013. The show, called &quot;The One and Only Cilla Black&quot;, starred Black alongside Paul O&#x27;Grady, who hosted the show. The show celebrated Black&#x27;s career and included a special trip back to her home city of Liverpool, a host of celebrity friends and some surprise music guests. Black paid homage to &quot;Blind Date&quot; with the return of its most popular contestants and saw her star in a special edition of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;.

===Television biopic===

In 2014, Black was the subject of a three-part television drama series, &quot;Cilla&quot;, focusing especially on her rise to fame in 1960s Liverpool and her relationship with Bobby Willis. ITV aired the first instalment on 15 September 2014, starring actress Sheridan Smith as Black.

===&quot;The Lost Tapes&quot;===
A documentary titled &quot;Cilla – The Lost Tapes&quot; aired on Wednesday 19 February 2020 on ITV, featuring previously unseen career and private family film. Celebrity friends such as Cliff Richard and Christopher Biggins also featured in it.

==Politics==
Black was at one time a staunch supporter of the Conservative Party and publicly voiced her admiration for Margaret Thatcher, stating in 1993 that Thatcher had &quot;put the &#x27;great&#x27; back into Great Britain&quot; during her 11 years as prime minister from 1979 until 1990—despite the widespread unpopularity of Thatcher and her government in Black&#x27;s native Liverpool. In April 1992, she appeared on stage at a Conservative Party rally and made prominent calls for the party&#x27;s re-election under the leadership of Thatcher&#x27;s successor John Major, who went on to win the election. However, in a 2004 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Black said that she was &quot;apolitical&quot;. The &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot; also quoted her as saying, &quot;As for the politics thing, I&#x27;m not a Conservative.&quot;

Cilla Black attended fund raising events for the Conservative party.

In August 2014, Black was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

==Personal life==
Black married her manager, Bobby Willis, at Marylebone Town Hall in January 1969; they were married for 30 years until he died from cancer on 23 October 1999. They had three sons together: Robert (born 1970), Ben (born 1974), and Jack (born 1980). Their daughter Ellen (born 4 October 1975) lived for only two hours.

==Death==

On 1 August 2015, Black died at her holiday home in the Spanish town of Estepona, aged 72. A spokesperson for the High Court of Justice in Andalusia suggested that an accident may have been a contributing factor in Black&#x27;s death. Following the results of an autopsy, her sons confirmed that she had died from a stroke following a fall in her home. A pathologist&#x27;s report confirmed that Black had suffered a subarachnoid haemorrhage after falling backwards and hitting her head, presumably on a terrace wall. It was believed she had not been found for at least four hours.

In 2014, she had stated that she wanted to die when she reached 75, as her mother, who suffered from progressive osteoporosis, had lived to 84 and her final years were difficult. According to a friend, she had recently said that she was approaching death, complaining of failing eyesight and hearing as well as arthritis. Black had been suffering with rheumatoid arthritis for years and was in &quot;considerable agony&quot; towards the end of her life.

In the days following her death, a book of condolence was opened at the Liverpool Town Hall. Then-Prime Minister David Cameron stated, &quot;Cilla Black was a huge talent who made a significant contribution to public life in Britain. My thoughts are with her family.&quot; Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Sheridan Smith, Holly Johnson, Cliff Richard, and Paul O&#x27;Grady were among friends and colleagues in the entertainment industry who expressed their sorrow at Black&#x27;s death. Comedian Jimmy Tarbuck, who had been a friend for decades, said, &quot;She was the girl next door that everybody loved and would have loved as a daughter, a daughter-in-law.&quot; Songwriter Burt Bacharach said, &quot;It will always be a most special memory for me of recording her on &#x27;Alfie&#x27; in Abbey Road Studios in 1965.&quot; Broadcaster Noel Edmonds said that she &quot;captured the hearts of the British people&quot; because &quot;she was our Cilla—there were no airs and graces&quot;.

Black&#x27;s funeral service was held on 20 August 2015 at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Woolton. Tom Williams, the Roman Catholic Auxiliary Bishop of Liverpool, led the service; Cliff Richard sang at the service and Paul O&#x27;Grady gave a eulogy. Spoken tributes, prayers and readings were made by Black&#x27;s sons Robert and Ben, Jimmy Tarbuck and Christopher Biggins. The Beatles song &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; was played as the coffin left the church. She was buried in a private ceremony at Allerton Cemetery in Allerton on the same day.

On 21 August 2015, the day after her funeral, &quot;The Very Best of Cilla Black&quot; (2013), a compilation album of her most popular songs in her career, went to number one on the UK Albums Chart. It was Black&#x27;s first number one album.

Black&#x27;s headstone has been the target of vandalism on several occasions. In 2015, thieves stole a bronze plaque inscribed with her name from the site, and in 2020, Black&#x27;s gravestone was vandalised with graffiti.

==Awards and honours==

Black was appointed OBE for services to entertainment in the 1997 New Year Honours.

In 2014, Black was the recipient of the British Academy Television Awards&#x27; Special Award and the first Royal Television Society Legends Award in honour of her 50 years in entertainment.

In 2017, a statue of Black commissioned by her sons was unveiled outside the Cavern Club&#x27;s original entrance as the venue celebrated its 60th anniversary. &quot;The sculpture shows a young Cilla performing one of her early songs and the design of her dress on the statue features images of her legendary career.&quot; The statue divided Liverpudlians owing to Black&#x27;s support of the Conservative Party and admiration for Margaret Thatcher.

<doc id="179645" wikidata="Q539918" url="?curid=179645" title="Ash'arism">
<text>Ash&#x27;arism (; ) is a school of theology in Sunni Islam named after Abu al-Hasan al-Ash&#x27;ari, a Shāfiʿī jurist, reformer (&quot;mujaddid&quot;), and scholastic theologian, in the 9th–10th century. It established an orthodox guideline, based on scriptural authority, rationality, and theological rationalism. It is one of the three main schools alongside Maturidism and Atharism.

Al-Ash&#x27;aris Knowledge was based both on reliance on the sacred scriptures of Islam and theological rationalism concerning the agency and attributes of God. Ashʿarism eventually became the predominant school of theological thought within Sunnī Islam, and is regarded as the single most important school of Islamic theology in the history of Islam.

The disciples of the Ash&#x27;ari school are known as Ashʿarites, and the school is also referred to as the Ashʿarite school, which became one of the dominant theological schools within Sunnī Islam. Ash&#x27;ari theology is considered one of the orthodox creeds of Sunnī Islam, alongside the Atharī and Māturīdī.

Amongst the most famous Ashʿarite theologians are al-Nawawi, Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani, Ibn al-Jawzi, al-Ghazali, al-Suyuti, Izz al-Din ibn &#x27;Abd al-Salam, Fakhr al-Din al-Razi, Ibn &#x27;Asakir, al-Subki, al-Taftazani, al-Baqillani, and al-Bayhaqi. Scholars and scientists who were affiliated with the Ash&#x27;ari school included al-Biruni, Ibn al-Haytham, Ibn al-Nafis, Ibn Battuta, and Ibn Khaldun.

== History ==
=== Founder ===

Abū al-Ḥasan al-Ashʿarī was born in Basra, Iraq, and was a descendant of Abū Mūsa al-Ashʿarī, which belonged to the first generation of Muhammad&#x27;s closest companions (&quot;ṣaḥāba&quot;). As a young man he studied under al-Jubba&#x27;i, a renowned teacher of Muʿtazilite theology and philosophy. He was noted for his teachings on atomism, among the earliest Islamic philosophies, and for al-Ashʿarī this was the basis for propagating the view that God created every moment in time and every particle of matter. He nonetheless believed in free will and predestination, elaborating the thoughts of Dirar ibn &#x27;Amr and Abu Hanifa into a &quot;dual agent&quot; or &quot;acquisition&quot; (&quot;iktisab&quot;) account of free will.

While Al-Ashʿarī opposed the views of the rival Muʿtazilite school, he was also opposed to the view which rejected all debate, held by certain schools such as the Zahiri (&quot;literalist&quot;), Mujassimite (anthropotheist), schools for their over-emphasis on &quot;taqlid&quot; (imitation) in his &quot;Istihsan al‑Khaud&quot;: But instead, Imam Al-Ash&#x27;ari affirmed the ambiguous verses in the Qur&#x27;an (such as those about the hand and eyes) without a &quot;how&quot; (modality) and without a meaning (meaning, he consigned the meaning to God), a practice known as &quot;tafwid&quot;. He also allowed another orthodox way of dealing with the ambiguous verses in the Qur&#x27;an called &quot;ta&#x27;wil&quot; (interpretation based on the Arabic language and revelation). 

=== Development ===
Ashʿarism became the main school of early Islamic philosophy whereby it was initially based on the foundations laid down by al-Ashʿarī, who founded the Ashʿarite school in the 10th century based on the methodology taught to him by the Kullabi movement that used rational argumentation to defend Sunni creed. However, the Ashʿarite school underwent many developments throughout history, resulting in the term &quot;Ashʿarī&quot; being extremely broad in its modern usage (e.g., differences between Ibn Furak (d. AH 406) and al-Bayhaqi (d. AH 384)).

For example, the Ashʿarite view was that comprehension of the unique nature and characteristics of God were beyond human capability. The solution proposed by al-Ashʿarī to solve the problems of &quot;tashbih&quot; and &quot;ta&#x27;til&quot; concedes that the Supreme Being possesses in a real sense the divine attributes and names mentioned in the Quran. In so far as these names and attributes have a positive reality, they are distinct from the essence, but nevertheless they don&#x27;t have either existence or reality apart from it.

The inspiration of al-Ashʿarī in this matter was on the one hand to distinguish essence and attribute as concepts, and on the other hand to see that the duality between essence and attribute should be situated not on the quantitative but on the qualitative level—something which Muʿtazilite thinking had failed to grasp. Ashʿarite theologians were referred to as the &quot;muthbita&quot; (&quot;those who make firm&quot;) by the Muʿtazilites.

== Beliefs ==

Two popular sources for Ash&#x27;ari creeds are &quot;Maqalat al-Islamiyyin&quot; and &quot;Ibana&#x27;an Usul al-Diyana&quot;.

=== God and God&#x27;s attributes ===
Ashʿarites also hold beliefs about God&#x27;s attributes that are unique to them, such as:
* Existence;
* Permanence without beginning;
* Endurance without end;
* Absoluteness and independence;
* Dissimilarity to created things;
* Oneness;
* God is all-powerful, willful, knowing, living, seeing, hearing, and speaking (signifying attributes).

=== God and relationship with humans ===
The Ashʿarī school of Islamic theology holds that:
* God is all-powerful (omnipotent).
* Good is what God commands—as revealed in the Quran and the &quot;ḥadīth&quot;—and is by definition just; evil is what God forbids and is likewise unjust. Right and wrong are in no way determined intuitively or naturally, they are not objective realities. (Divine command theory)
* Because of Divine omnipotence, there are no &quot;natural laws&quot; (of things like thermodynamics or gravity), because such laws would put limitations on His actions. There are, however, Divine &quot;customs&quot;, whereby &quot;certain so-called &#x27;effects usually follow certain &quot;causes&quot; in the natural world.
* Also because of Divine power, all human acts—even the decision to raise a finger—are created by God. This had caused controversy earlier in Islamic history because human acts are what humans are judged for when being sent to heaven (&quot;jannah&quot;) or hell (&quot;jahannam&quot;). Ashʿaris reconciled the doctrines of free will, justice, and divine omnipotence, with their own doctrine of &quot;kasb&quot; (&quot;acquisition&quot;), by which human beings &quot;acquire&quot; responsibility for their actions, although these &quot;actions are willed and created by God&quot;. Humans still possess free will (or, more accurately, freedom of intention) under this doctrine, although their freedom is limited to the power to decide between the given possibilities God has created. (This doctrine is now known in Western philosophy as occasionalism.)
* The Quran is the uncreated word of God, that is, it was not created &quot;by&quot; God, but like God has always been. It can also be said to be &quot;created&quot; when it takes on a form in letters or sound.
* The unique nature and attributes of God cannot be understood fully by human reason and the physical senses.
* Reason is God-given and must be employed over the source of knowledge.
* Intellectual inquiry is decreed by the Quran and the Islamic prophet Muhammad, therefore the interpretation (&quot;tafsīr&quot;) of the Quran and the &quot;ḥadīth&quot; should keep developing with the aid of older interpretations.
* Only God knows the heart, who belongs to the faithful and who does not.
* God has &quot;absolute freedom&quot; to &quot;punish or reward as He wills&quot;, and so may forgive the sins of those in Hell.
* Support of &quot;kalām&quot; (rationalistic Islamic theology).

=== Prophets and &quot;the unseen&quot; ===
Ashʿarites further affirm that Muslims beliefs include:
* In all the prophets and messengers of Islam, from Adam to Muhammad.
* Jesus will return to earth and defeat the Dajjal.
* Belief in the angels.
* Including the angels of the grave (Munkar and Nakir).
* That Satan tempts man, contrarily to the Mu&#x27;tazila and Jahmiyya (the mention of the latter two branches only appears in &quot;Ibana&quot;).
* The reality of Paradise and Hell.
* That prayers for dead Muslims and almsgiving reach them.
* During sleep, visions can be seen and they have an interpretation (&quot;interpretation&quot; only found in &quot;Ibana&quot;).
* The existence of sorcerers and that magic is a reality in the world.
* That jinn are real and able to physically possess people, although not mentioned in the works above, many Ash&#x27;arites consider this as part of the &quot;aqida&quot;.

== Ashʿarism and reason ==
It is said that in the early period, Ash&#x27;arites followed a method that combined reason and revelation. This is in contrast to the assertion by some Ash&#x27;arites that those who believe without thinking (&quot;muqallidoon&quot;) cannot be true believers. This view indicates that believing in religion without using reason and thought is considered invalid according to them.
Contrary to this, some within the school, such as al-Taftazani, have sometimes stated that revelation also represents knowledge, while Ibn al-Tilimsanī criticized al-Razī, asking what grounds legal rulings if all revelation were mere conjecture, stating that revelation cannot entirely be based on conjecture.

== Later Ashʿarism ==

Nicholas Heer writes that later Ashʿarite theologians &quot;increasingly attempted to rationalize Islamic doctrine&quot; from about the 12th century onwards. Theologians such as al-Taftāzānī and al-Jurjānī argued that the Islamic sacred scriptures (the Quran and the &quot;ḥadīth&quot;) &quot;must be proven to be true by rational arguments&quot; before being &quot;accepted as the basis of the religion&quot;. Educated Muslims &quot;must be convinced on the basis of rational arguments&quot;. A series of rational proofs were developed by these Ashʿarite theologians, including proofs for &quot;the following doctrines or propositions&quot;:
# The universe is originated;
# The universe has an originator or creator;
# The creator of the universe is knowing, powerful and willing;
# Prophecy is possible;
# Miracles are possible;
# Miracles indicate the truthfulness of one who claims to be a prophet;
# Muhammad claimed to be a prophet and performed miracles.

== Criticism ==

The medieval Muslim scholar Ibn Taymiyyah criticised the Ashʿarī theology as (in the words of one historian, Jonathan A. C. Brown) &quot;a Greek solution to Greek problems&quot; that should &quot;never&quot; have concerned Muslims. Both Ibn Taymiyyah and Shah Waliullah Dehlawi rejected the lack of literalism in Ashʿarī &quot;speculative theology&quot; and advocated &quot;literal acceptance of God&#x27;s description of Himself&quot;.

In contrast, German orientalist scholar Eduard Sachau says that the Ashʿarī theology and its biggest defender, al-Ghazali, was too literal and responsible for the decline of Islamic science starting in the 10th century. Sachau stated that the two clerics were the only obstacle to the Muslim world becoming a nation of &quot;Galileos, Keplers, and Newtons&quot;.

Ziauddin Sardar states that some of the greatest Muslim scientists of the Islamic Golden Age, such as Ibn al-Haytham and Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī, who were pioneers of the scientific method, were themselves followers of the Ashʿarī school of Islamic theology. Like other Ashʿarites who believed that faith or &quot;taqlid&quot; should be applied only to Islam and not to any ancient Hellenistic authorities, Ibn al-Haytham&#x27;s view that &quot;taqlid&quot; should be applied only to the prophets and messengers of Islam and not to any other authorities formed the basis for much of his scientific skepticism and criticism against Ptolemy and other ancient authorities in his &quot;Doubts Concerning Ptolemy&quot; and &quot;Book of Optics&quot;.

<text>The Merseybeats (sometimes written as the Mersey Beats) are an English band that emerged from the Liverpool Merseybeat scene in the early 1960s, performing at the Cavern Club along with the Beatles, Gerry and the Pacemakers, and other similar artists.

The group&#x27;s original members were Tony Crane (vocals, lead guitar), John Banks (drums), Aaron Williams (rhythm guitar) and Billy Kinsley (vocals, bass). Kinsley left the group at the beginning of 1964 and was replaced by John Gustafson, though Kinsley returned at the end of that year. The group split in 1966, with Crane and Kinsley continuing as a duo dubbed the Merseys. The Merseys ended in 1969. During the 1970s and 1980s, the Merseybeats would stage several occasional reunions before reforming permanently in 1993.

The current line-up is Tony Crane and his son Adrian Crane on keyboards and lead guitar.

==History==
===The Merseybeats===
Originally called the Mavericks, the band was formed by singer/guitarist Tony Crane and singer/bassist Billy Kinsley in late 1960. They became the Pacifics in September 1961. They were renamed the Mersey Beats in February 1962 by Bob Wooler, MC at the Cavern Club. In April 1962, they became the Merseybeats. By now Crane and Kinsley had joined up with guitarist Aaron Williams and drummer John Banks. Pete Best was offered a position in the group by Brian Epstein after being dismissed from the Beatles, but turned it down.

They signed a recording contract with Fontana Records and had their first hit single in 1963 with &quot;It&#x27;s Love That Really Counts&quot;, followed in 1964 by their million-selling record &quot;I Think of You&quot;, which gained them their first gold disc. They suffered a setback in February 1964 when Kinsley left to form his own band, the Kinsleys. He was temporarily replaced by Bob Garner (later of the Creation) and permanently by Johnny Gustafson, formerly of the Big Three.

With Gustafson they had two more major hits during 1964, &quot;Don&#x27;t Turn Around&quot; and &quot;Wishin&#x27; and Hopin&#x27;, and released their only album in the latter part of that year. Kinsley returned to the group at the end of 1964.

The Merseybeats appeared regularly at Liverpool&#x27;s Cavern Club, and they claim to have appeared there with the Beatles on more occasions than any other band from that era. They were also successful abroad, touring in Germany and the US in 1964, and having their own Merseybeats Show on Italian television.

===The Merseys===
During 1965 their initial success waned, and after a few more singles the band folded in early 1966. Crane and Kinsley continued as a vocal duo called the Merseys. They had a major hit with their first single, a cover of the McCoys&#x27; &quot;Sorrow&quot;, which reached Number 4 in the UK Singles Chart. The introduction on the record featured a bowed bass played by Jack Bruce. A line from this song, &quot;with your long blonde hair and eyes of blue,&quot; is included in the Beatles&#x27; &quot;It&#x27;s All Too Much&quot;, released in 1969 as part of the &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; soundtrack album. David Bowie recorded a single version in 1973 which reached Number 3 in the UK Singles Chart. The duo split in 1969, with Crane and Kinsley both going on to front a number of other bands.

===Tony Crane and The Merseybeats===
During the 1970s, Crane continued to tour and perform live as Tony Crane and the Merseybeats with various line-ups.

===The Merseybeats re-formed===
The Merseybeats&#x27; original drummer John Banks died on 20 April 1988, at the age of 44.

Kinsley and Crane re-formed the Merseybeats in 1993, and after celebrating 45 years in the music industry in 2006, they continued to tour and perform on the &#x27;sixties circuit&#x27;, and at venues in the UK, and across Europe. Kinsley departed in 2020, leaving the band in the hands of Crane and his son Adrian.

Former bassist and vocalist John Gustafson died on 12 September 2014, at the age of 72.

<text>The Mojos were a British beat group from the 1960s, best known for their hit UK single, &quot;Everything&#x27;s Alright&quot;, with two other singles charting low in the UK Singles Chart in 1964.

==Biography==
The band formed under the name the Nomads as a duo in 1962 and originally consisted of bassist Keith Karlson (born Keith Alcock) and drummer Jon &quot;Bob&quot; Conrad. Before Conrad, Snowy Fleet was the drummer, when he was replaced by Conrad when he emigrated to Australia. After that the band was joined in September 1962 by lead singer, pianist Stu James (born Stuart Slater), rhythm guitarist, vocalist Adrian Lord (born Adrian Wilkinson). 

The band continued without a lead guitarist when Wood left. At the suggestion of Beatle George Harrison, pianist Terry O&#x27;Toole was added to the lineup in August 1963; Harrison having heard him play at the Blue Angel jazz club. The band also changed their name in August 1963 to the Mojos and Lord changed from rhythm guitarist to lead guitarist. This lineup recorded &quot;My Whole Life Through&quot;, which was featured on the Oriole Records &quot;This is Merseybeat&quot; compilation album, and the debut single &quot;They Say&quot;.

&quot;They Say&quot; achieved some popularity; amongst other things, it was used for the party scene in the 1964 film &quot;The Comedy Man&quot;.

Despite having written the single&#x27;s b-side, Lord (Wilkinson) left the group soon after its release in October 1963 and was replaced by Nicky Crouch (formerly of Faron&#x27;s Flamingos) (born Nicholas Crouch, Aintree). This was the line-up that was to continue until October 1964, recording the group&#x27;s three charting singles - &quot;Everything&#x27;s Alright&quot; (no. 9), &quot;Why Not Tonight&quot; (no. 25) and &quot;Seven Daffodils&quot; (no. 30) - as well as an EP. They appeared in the movie &quot;Every Day&#x27;s a Holiday&quot; and like many of their contemporaries the group played at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany.

In October 1964, Karlson, Conrad and O&#x27;Toole left the group and James and Crouch were joined by drummer Aynsley Dunbar and bassist Lewis Collins (26 May 1946 – 27 November 2013). This line-up recorded the singles &quot;Comin&#x27; On to Cry&quot; and &quot;Wait A Minute&quot; (the latter released as by &quot;Stu James and the Mojos&quot;), for Decca - before disbanding in September 1966.

James and Crouch formed a new version with Birmingham bass player Deke Vernon and Southampton drummer Martin Smith and released a further single &quot;Good-Bye, Dolly Gray&quot; in February 1967 which also failed to chart. They then spent several months playing at a luxury hotel in the Ivory Coast later that year.

James moved back to Southampton and reformed the Mojos in late 1967 with local musicians Eddie Harnett on lead guitar, Duncan Campbell on bass and Tony House on drums, and recorded &quot;Until My Baby Comes Home&quot;, for Liberty.

Collins became an actor, starring in &quot;The Professionals&quot;, and Dunbar became a noted session musician, playing with Frank Zappa, David Bowie and John Mayall, among others. Stu James stayed in the music business taking management roles at Bradley&#x27;s Records and later Chrysalis Records. Crouch currently plays in a group called Nicky Crouch&#x27;s Mojos, which features members of other 1960s Merseybeat acts, including the Swinging Blue Jeans, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes and Faron&#x27;s Flamingos.

The Mojos were reformed as a touring band in the 1970s by the Hal Carter Organisation with various professional musicians including lead guitarist Antz Cowell (the Tornados, Billy Fury, Marty Wilde), bass guitarist Dave Cowell (Fusion Orchestra) and drummer Jon Werrell (the Tornados, Heinz, Dustin Gee, Carl Simmons). They supported Mud and Showaddywaddy on some UK tour dates. Whilst in Jersey during a break in touring, Jon Werrell loaned his silver Premier drumkit to John Bonham for Led Zeppelin&#x27;s impromptu club gigs in St.Helier.

Martin Smith died on 2 March 1997, aged 50. John Conrad died on 2 January 2001, aged 56. Lewis Collins died on 27 November 2013, aged 67. Lead singer Stu James died on 10 May 2023, at the age of 77.

<doc id="179657" wikidata="Q542292" url="?curid=179657" title="Coxsone Dodd">
<text>Clement Seymour &quot;Coxsone&quot; Dodd (26 January 1932 – 4 May 2004) was a Jamaican record producer who was influential in the development of ska and reggae in the 1950s, 1960s and beyond.

He was nicknamed &quot;Coxsone&quot; at school due to his talent as a cricketer (his friends compared him to Alec Coxon, a member of the 1940s Yorkshire County Cricket Club team).

== Biography ==
The Kingston-born Dodd used to play records to the customers in his parents&#x27; shop. During a spell in the American South he became familiar with the rhythm and blues music popular there at the time. In 1954, back in Jamaica, he set up the Downbeat Sound System, being the owner of an amplifier, a turntable, and some US records, which he would import from New Orleans and Miami.

With the success of his sound system, and in a competitive environment, Dodd would make trips through the US looking for new tunes to attract the Jamaican public. While he did, his mother Doris Darlington would run the sound system and play the tunes. Dodd opened five different sound systems, each playing every night. To run his sound systems, Dodd appointed people such as Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry, who was Dodd&#x27;s right-hand man during his early career, U-Roy and Prince Buster. Perry would later leave Dodd in 1966 due to Perry feeling disrespected by Dodd. This is documented in the 1966 song &quot;The Upsetter&quot;.

=== Recording career ===
When the R&amp;B craze ended in the United States, Dodd and his rivals were forced to begin recording their own Jamaican music in order to meet the local demand for new music.

In 1959, he founded a record company called Worldisc. In 1962, he produced the jazz record &quot;I Cover the Waterfront&quot; on the Port-O-Jam label, two of the musicians who played on the album, Roland Alphonso and Don Drummond became founding members of the Skatalites one year later. In 1963, he opened Studio One on Brentford Road, Kingston. It was the first black-owned recording studio in Jamaica. He held regular Sunday evening auditions in search of new talent, and it was here that Dodd auditioned Bob Marley, singing as a part of The Wailers.

In the early 1960s, Dodd was producing ska hits by Toots and the Maytals, the Gaylads, and the Skatalites.

Dodd&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;re Wondering Now&quot;, was initially recorded in 1964 by Andy &amp; Joey in Jamaica and later covered by The Skatalites, The Specials and Amy Winehouse; it was also used as the theme tune for the British-French crime drama television series &quot;Death in Paradise&quot;.

During the late 1960s and 1970s, the &quot;Studio One sound&quot; was synonymous with the sound of ska, rocksteady and reggae, and Dodd attracted some of the Jamaican new musicians, including Burning Spear, Ras Michael, Delroy Wilson, Horace Andy, Sound Dimension, and Sugar Minott.

In the mid-1980s, Dodd closed his studio and moved his base of operations to New York City.

== Honours ==
In 2002 he was awarded a Gold Musgrave Medal by the Institute of Jamaica.

== Last years and death ==
He continued to be active in the music industry into his seventies, and on 1 May 2004, Kingston&#x27;s Brentford Road was renamed Studio One Boulevard in a ceremony which paid tribute to his accomplishments as a producer. He died suddenly of a heart attack three days later, aged 72, while working at Studio One. He was survived by his wife, Norma, who passed in 2010.

Dodd was posthumously awarded the Order of Distinction, in the rank of Commander on 15 October 2007, for service to the Jamaica music industry.

<doc id="179660" wikidata="Q2120608" url="?curid=179660" title="Function word">
<text>In linguistics, function words (also called functors) are words that have little lexical meaning or have ambiguous meaning and express grammatical relationships among other words within a sentence, or specify the attitude or mood of the speaker. They signal the structural relationships that words have to one another and are the glue that holds sentences together. Thus they form important elements in the structures of sentences.

Words that are not function words are called &quot;content words&quot; (or open class words, &quot;lexical words,&quot; or &quot;autosemantic words&quot;) and include nouns, most verbs, adjectives, and most adverbs, although some adverbs are function words (like &quot;then&quot; and &quot;why&quot;). Dictionaries define the specific meanings of content words but can describe only the general usages of function words. By contrast, grammars describe the use of function words in detail but treat lexical words only in general terms.

Since it was first proposed in 1952 by C. C. Fries, the distinguishing of function/structure words from content/lexical words has been highly influential in the grammar used in second-language acquisition and English-language teaching.

==Overview==
Function words might be prepositions, pronouns, auxiliary verbs, conjunctions, grammatical articles or particles, all of which belong to the group of closed-class words. Interjections are sometimes considered function words but they belong to the group of open-class words. Function words might or might not be inflected or might have affixes.

Function words belong to the closed class of words in grammar because it is very uncommon to have new function words created in the course of speech. In the open class of words, i.e., nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs, new words may be added readily, such as slang words, technical terms, and adoptions and adaptations of foreign words.

Each function word either: gives grammatical information about other words in a sentence or clause, and cannot be isolated from other words; or gives information about the speaker&#x27;s mental model as to what is being said.

Grammatical words, as a class, can have distinct phonological properties from content words. For example, in some of the Khoisan languages, most content words begin with clicks, but very few function words do. In English, very few words other than function words begin with the voiced &quot;th&quot; . English function words may be spelled with fewer than three letters; e.g., &#x27;I&#x27;, &#x27;an&#x27;, &#x27;in&#x27;, while non-function words usually are spelled with three or more (e.g., &#x27;eye&#x27;, &#x27;Ann&#x27;, &#x27;inn&#x27;).

The following is a list of the kind of words considered to be function words with English examples. They are all uninflected in English unless marked otherwise:
*articles — &quot;the&quot; and &quot;a&quot;. In some inflected languages, the articles may take on the case of the declension of the following noun.
*pronouns — &quot;he&quot; :: &quot;him&quot;, &quot;she&quot; :: &quot;her&quot;, etc. — inflected in English
*adpositions — &quot;in&quot;, &quot;under&quot;, &quot;towards&quot;, &quot;before&quot;, &quot;of&quot;, &quot;for&quot;, etc. 
*conjunctions — &quot;and&quot; and &quot;but&quot;
*subordinating conjunctions — &quot;if&quot;, &quot;then&quot;, &quot;well&quot;, &quot;however&quot;, &quot;thus&quot;, etc.
*auxiliary verbs — &quot;would&quot;, &quot;could&quot;, &quot;should&quot;, etc. — inflected in English
*particles — &quot;up&quot;, &quot;on&quot;, &quot;down&quot;
*interjections — &quot;oh&quot;, &quot;ah&quot;, &quot;eh&quot;, sometimes called &quot;filled pauses&quot; 
*expletives — take the place of sentences, among other functions.
*pro-sentences — &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;okay&quot;, etc.

<doc id="179661" wikidata="Q1264438" url="?curid=179661" title="Duke Reid">
<text>Arthur &quot;Duke&quot; Reid CD (21 July 1915 – 1 January 1975) was a Jamaican record producer, DJ and record label owner.

He ran one of the most popular sound systems of the 1950s called Reid&#x27;s Sound System, whilst Duke himself was known as The Trojan, possibly named after the British-made trucks used to transport the equipment. In the 1960s, Reid founded the record label Treasure Isle (named after his liquor store), which produced ska and rocksteady music. He was still active in the early 1970s, working with toaster U-Roy. He died in early 1975 after having suffered from a severe illness for the last year.

==Biography==
Reid was born in Portland, Jamaica. After serving ten years as a Jamaican police officer, Reid left the force to help his wife Lucille run the family business, The Treasure Isle Grocery and Liquor Store at 33 Bond Street in Kingston.

He made his way into the music industry first as a sound system (outdoor mobile discothèque) owner, promoter and disc jockey in 1953. He quickly overtook Tom the Great Sebastian as the most popular sound system in Kingston. Soon he was also sponsor and presenter of a radio show, Treasure Isle Time. A jazz and blues man at heart, Reid chose &quot;My Mother&#x27;s Eyes&quot; by Tab Smith as his theme tune. Other favourites of his included Fats Domino, a noticeable influence on the early Reid sound.

He began producing recordings in the late 1950s. Early Reid productions were recorded in studios owned by others, but when the family business moved from Pink Lane, Kingston to Bond Street, Reid set up his own studio above the store. He became proprietor of a number of labels, chiefly Treasure Isle and Dutchess (his spelling). Much of his income derived from licensing agreements with companies in the UK, some of which set up specialist Duke Reid labels. He was known to carry his pistols and rifle with him in the studio and would sometimes fire them to celebrate a successful audition.

He dominated the Jamaican music scene of the 1960s, specialising in ska and rocksteady, though his love of American jazz, blues and soul was evident. Reid had several things going for him that helped him to rise to prominence. He made a concerted effort to be in the studio as much as possible, something his counterparts did not do. He was known as a perfectionist and had a knack for adding symphonic sounds to his recordings and producing dense arrangements. Furthermore, his records were considerably longer than those being produced by his rivals. His tunes often broke the four-minute barrier, while most ska songs were barely longer than two minutes. The material that Treasure Island issued exemplified the cool and elegant feel of the rocksteady era. In an interview for Kool 97 FM, Jackie Jackson along with Paul Douglas and Radcliffe &quot;Dougie&quot; Bryan were asked about the many recordings they did together as the rhythm section for Treasure Isle Records, and working with Sonia Pottinger and Duke Reid.

Duke Reid made an impact with his presence at toasting battles, trying to out play other DJs. He was dressed in a long ermine cloak and a gilt crown on his head, with a pair of Colt 45s in cowboy holsters, a cartridge belt strapped across his chest and a loaded shotgun over his shoulder. It was not uncommon for things to get out of hand and it was said that Duke Reid would bring the crowd under control by firing his shotgun in the air.

Reid initially disliked ska for being too simple and having too much focus on drums rather than on guitar. However, he eventually got behind ska and produced numerous hits. Reid&#x27;s ska productions in the 1960s &quot;epitomized the absolute peak of the style&quot;, according to music historian Colin Larkin. He had a long string of hits with performers like Stranger Cole, the Techniques, Justin Hinds and the Dominoes, Alton Ellis and the Flames, the Paragons, the Jamaicans, and the Melodians.

Reid held a fierce, mutual professional rivalry with Coxsone Dodd starting in the late 1950s and through the 1960s. Reid&#x27;s Trojan and Coxsone&#x27;s Downbeat were the top two sound systems in Jamaica when active, and the competition extended to their Treasure Isle and Studio One labels, respectively. According to singer Brent Dowe of The Melodians, &quot;When they were playing records, they were playing against each other...If you were singing for one, you couldn&#x27;t go and sing for the other, or if you did you couldn&#x27;t go back to the first one for a long time.&quot;

By the 1970s, Reid&#x27;s poor health and the trend towards Rastafarian influenced roots reggae, noticeably reducing the number of releases from Treasure Isle. Reid forbade Rasta lyrics from being recorded in his studio and thus Coxsone Dodd was able to dominate the Jamaican recording industry. Reid maintained his high-profile largely by recording the &quot;toasting&quot; of DJs U-Roy and Dennis Alcapone as well as vaguely Rasta-influenced oddities such as Cynthia Richards&#x27; &quot;Aily-I&quot;.

At around this time, Reid protégé Justin Hinds noticed his boss appeared unwell and recommended a doctor. Cancer was diagnosed and Reid decided to sell Treasure Isle to Sonia Pottinger, widow of his friend Lenford &quot;Lennie the King&quot; Pottinger and already owner of High Note Records, which was one of the largest record labels on the Island. He remained involved for a while acting as a Magistrate but died in 1975.

Reid was posthumously awarded the Order of Distinction in the rank of Commander on 15 October 2007.

<doc id="179664" wikidata="Q272942" url="?curid=179664" title="Lesley Gore">
<text>Lesley Gore (Born Lesley Sue Goldstein, May 2, 1946 – February 16, 2015) was an American singer and songwriter. At the age of 16, she recorded her first hit song &quot;It&#x27;s My Party&quot;, a US number one in 1963. She followed it up with ten further US &quot;Billboard&quot; top 40 hits including &quot;Judy&#x27;s Turn to Cry&quot; and &quot;You Don&#x27;t Own Me&quot;. Gore said she considered &quot;You Don&#x27;t Own Me&quot; her signature song.

Gore later worked as an actress and television personality. She composed songs with her brother Michael Gore for the 1980 film &quot;Fame&quot;, and received an Academy Award nomination for &quot;Out Here On My Own&quot;. She hosted several editions of the LGBT-oriented public television show &quot;In the Life&quot; on American TV in the 2000s.

==Early life and education==
Gore was born Lesley Sue Goldstein in Brooklyn, New York City, into a middle-class 
Jewish family. Her parents were Leo Goldstein and Ronny Gore. The family changed their surname to &quot;Gore&quot; soon after Leslie&#x27;s birth. Her father was the owner of Peter Pan, a children&#x27;s swimwear and underwear manufacturer, and later became a leading brand licensing agent in the apparel industry. She was raised in Tenafly, New Jersey, and attended the Dwight School for Girls in nearby Englewood. She also attended Sarah Lawrence College, graduating with a degree in American literature.

==Career==

===1963–1979: Commercial success===

Gore was discovered after her uncle gave Joe Glaser a tape of her singing that he forwarded to Irving Green, president of Mercury Records. Green gave the tape to Quincy Jones for evaluation and Jones, recognizing her talent, became her producer. She was 16 years old. When she recorded her version of &quot;It&#x27;s My Party&quot; in 1963, she was a junior in high school. It became a number-one, nationwide hit. Gore&#x27;s version was certified as a Gold record. It also marked the beginning of a time when fans would show up on her front lawn.

&quot;It&#x27;s My Party&quot; was followed by many other hits for Gore, including the sequel, &quot;Judy&#x27;s Turn to Cry&quot; (US number five); &quot;She&#x27;s a Fool&quot; (US number five); the feminist-themed million-selling &quot;You Don&#x27;t Own Me&quot;, which held at number two for three weeks behind the Beatles&#x27; &quot;I Want To Hold Your Hand&quot;; &quot;That&#x27;s the Way Boys Are&quot; (US No. 12); &quot;Maybe I Know&quot; (US No. 14/UK No. 20); &quot;Look of Love&quot; (US No. 27); and &quot;Sunshine, Lollipops and Rainbows&quot; (US number 13), which she sang during a bus scene from the 1965 movie, &quot;Ski Party.&quot; In 1965, she also appeared in the beach party film &quot;The Girls on the Beach&quot; in which she performed three songs: &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Gotta Be You&quot;, and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Be a Loser&quot;.

Gore was given first shot at recording &quot;A Groovy Kind of Love&quot; by songwriters Carole Bayer and Toni Wine with a melody borrowed from a sonatina by Muzio Clementi, but Shelby Singleton, a producer for Mercury subsidiary Smash Records, refused to let Gore record a song with the word &quot;groovy&quot; in its lyrics. The Mindbenders went on to record it, and it reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts.
Gore recorded composer Marvin Hamlisch&#x27;s first hit composition, &quot;Sunshine, Lollipops and Rainbows&quot;, on May 21, 1963, while &quot;It&#x27;s My Party&quot; was climbing the charts. Her record producer from 1963 to 1965 was Quincy Jones. Jones&#x27;s dentist was Marvin Hamlisch&#x27;s uncle, and Hamlisch asked his uncle to convey several songs to Jones. &quot;Sunshine, Lollipops and Rainbows&quot; was released on the LP &quot;Lesley Gore Sings of Mixed-Up Hearts&quot;, but did not surface as a single until June 1965. Hamlisch composed three other Gore associated songs: &quot;California Nights&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s the Way the Ball Bounces&quot; and &quot;One by One&quot;. &quot;That&#x27;s the Way the Ball Bounces&quot; was recorded September 21, 1963, at A&amp;R Studios in New York; it was released as the B-side of &quot;That&#x27;s the Way Boys Are&quot; and appeared on the LP &quot;Boys Boys Boys&quot;. &quot;One by One&quot; was an unreleased track recorded on July 31, 1969, in New York and produced by Paul Leka; it first appeared on the Bear Family five-CD anthology of Gore&#x27;s Mercury work entitled &quot;It&#x27;s My Party&quot; (1994).

Gore was one of the featured performers in the &quot;T.A.M.I. Show&quot; concert film, which was recorded and released in 1964 by American International Pictures, and placed in the National Film Registry in 2006. Gore had one of the longest sets in the film, performing six songs, including &quot;It&#x27;s My Party&quot;, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Own Me&quot;, and &quot;Judy&#x27;s Turn to Cry&quot;.

Gore performed on two consecutive episodes of the &quot;Batman&quot; television series (January 19 and 25, 1967), in which she guest-starred as Pussycat, one of Catwoman&#x27;s minions. In the January 19 episode &quot;That Darn Catwoman&quot;, she lip-synched to the Bob Crewe-produced &quot;California Nights&quot;, and in the January 25 episode &quot;Scat! Darn Catwoman&quot;, she lip-synched to &quot;Maybe Now&quot;. &quot;California Nights&quot;, which Gore recorded for her 1967 album of the same name, returned her to the top twenty of the Hot 100. The single peaked at number 16 in March 1967 (14 weeks on the chart). It was her first top-40 hit since &quot;My Town, My Guy and Me&quot; in late 1965 and her first top-20 since &quot;Sunshine, Lollipops, and Rainbows&quot;. Gore also performed &quot;It&#x27;s My Party&quot; and &quot;We Know We&#x27;re in Love&quot; 10 months earlier on the final episode of &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;, which aired on March 19, 1966.

After high school, while continuing to make appearances as a singer, Gore attended Sarah Lawrence College, studying English and American literature. At college, folk music was popularly lauded as &quot;chic&quot;, whereas pop music was often derided as &quot;uncool&quot;. &quot;Had I been tall with blonde hair, had I been Mary Travers, I would have gotten along fine.&quot; She graduated in 1968.

Gore signed a contract with Mercury Records with a five-year term that carried her obligations to the company through the spring of 1968. Her last big hit had been 12 months prior to this time, but Mercury still saw promise in her as an artist and believed that one of her singles would make it, as they had in the past. They offered a one-year extension on the initial contract, and Gore was formally contracted to Mercury for a sixth year. During this time, &quot;He Gives Me Love (La La La)&quot;, a single release based on a Eurovision Song Contest winner, rose to number 96 on the Music Business charts, while bubbling under the Hot 100 in &quot;Billboard&quot;. Mercury took out a full-page ad in the trades to support the single, but its airplay was spotty, becoming a hit in only a few major markets. She was then paired with the successful soul producers Kenny Gamble, Leon Huff, and Thom Bell for two singles that took her into the &quot;soul&quot; genre: &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Standing By&quot; and &quot;Take Good Care (Of My Heart)&quot;. These songs did not fit the image Mercury had crafted for her, and the singles were not played. Her contract with Mercury ended after the release of &quot;98.6/Lazy Day&quot; and &quot;Wedding Bell Blues&quot; failed to make headway on the charts.

In 1970, she signed with Crewe Records and was reunited with producer Bob Crewe, who had produced her album &quot;California Nights.&quot; Her first release under the label, &quot;Why Doesn&#x27;t Love Make Me Happy&quot;, was a moderate hit on the Adult Contemporary chart, but none of her other singles would prove to be successful. She left Crewe Records in 1971 when the label went bankrupt.

In 1972, Gore signed with MoWest Records, a subsidiary of Motown, and in July of that year released her first studio album in five years, &quot;Someplace Else Now&quot;. All of the songs were either written or co-written by Gore, with collaborators Ellen Weston and her brother Michael. Due to the failure of the album&#x27;s sole single, &quot;She Said That&quot;, along with poor promotion, &quot;Someplace Else Now&quot; died on the shelf.

===1980–2014: As composer===
Gore composed songs for the soundtrack of the 1980 film &quot;Fame&quot;, for which she received an Academy Award nomination for &quot;Out Here on My Own,&quot; written with her brother, Michael Gore. Michael won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for the theme song of the same film. Gore played concerts and appeared on television throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

Gore co-wrote a song, &quot;My Secret Love&quot;, for the 1996 film &quot;Grace of My Heart&quot;. The film includes a subplot about a young singer named Kelly Porter, who is based in part on Gore and is played by Bridget Fonda. The character, who is a closeted lesbian, performs &quot;My Secret Love&quot; in the film.

In 2005, Gore recorded &quot;Ever Since&quot; (her first album of new material since &quot;Love Me By Name&quot; in 1976), with producer/songwriter Blake Morgan, with the label Engine Company Records. The album received favorable reviews from &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Billboard&quot;, and other national press. The album also included a revised version of &quot;You Don&#x27;t Own Me&quot;, about which the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; wrote: &quot;In Lesley Gore&#x27;s new version of &#x27;You Don&#x27;t Own Me&#x27;—cut more than 40 years after its initial recording—she lends a pop classic new life.&quot; Gore commented: &quot;Without the loud backing track, I could wring more meaning from the lyric&quot;. And: &quot;It&#x27;s a song that takes on new meaning every time you sing it.&quot;

==Personal life==
Beginning in 2003, Gore hosted several editions of the PBS television series &quot;In the Life&quot;, which focused on LGBT issues. In a 2005 interview with &quot;AfterEllen&quot;, she stated she was a lesbian and had been in a relationship with luxury jewelry designer Lois Sasson since 1982. She had known about her attraction to women from the time she was 20 and stated that although the music business was &quot;totally homophobic&quot;, she never felt she had to pretend she was straight. &quot;I just kind of lived my life naturally and did what I wanted to do,&quot; she said. &quot;I didn&#x27;t avoid anything, I didn&#x27;t put it in anybody&#x27;s face.&quot;

Gore had been working on a memoir and a Broadway show based on her life when she died of lung cancer on February 16, 2015, at the NYU Langone Medical Center in Manhattan, New York City, at the age of 68. At the time of her death, Gore and Sasson had been together for 33 years.

Her &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary stated &quot;with songs like &#x27;It&#x27;s My Party,&#x27; &#x27;Judy&#x27;s Turn to Cry&#x27;, and the indelibly defiant 1964 single &#x27;You Don&#x27;t Own Me&#x27; — all recorded before she was 18 — Gore made herself the voice of teenaged girls aggrieved by fickle boyfriends, moving quickly from tearful self-pity to fierce self-assertion.&quot;

==Awards and recognition==
In 1964, &quot;It&#x27;s My Party&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for rock-and-roll recording.

National Public Radio named &quot;Lesley Gore Sings of Mixed-Up Hearts&quot;, Gore&#x27;s second album, as forebearer of one of the top 150 albums recorded by women. The album missed the official list (1964–present) because it was released in 1963. &quot;She is a forebearer for her assertion of feminine power in pop, and her validation of a female perspective.&quot;

Lesley Gore&#x27;s papers were donated to the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts and became accessible to the public in 2022. Catalogued by the library and her partner Lois Sasson, it includes family photos, scrapbook pages, annotated music and lyrics, business files, an unfinished memoir, and sound and video recordings.

<doc id="179669" wikidata="Q4791091" url="?curid=179669" title="Aristotle's theory of universals">
<text>Aristotle&#x27;s theory of universals is Aristotle&#x27;s classical solution to the problem of universals, sometimes known as the hylomorphic theory of immanent realism. universals are the characteristics or qualities that ordinary objects or things have in common. They can be identified in the types, properties, or relations observed in the world. For example, imagine there is a bowl of red apples resting on a table. Each apple in that bowl will have many similar qualities, such as their red coloring or &quot;redness&quot;. They will share some degree of the quality of &quot;ripeness&quot; depending on their age. They may also be at varying degrees of age, which will affect their color, but they will all share a universal &quot;appleness&quot;. These qualities are the universals that the apples hold in common.

The problem of universals asks three questions. Do universals exist? If they exist, where do they exist? Also, if they exist, how do we obtain knowledge of them? In Aristotle&#x27;s view, universals are incorporeal and universal, but only exist only where they are instantiated; they exist only in things. Aristotle said that a universal is &quot;identical in each of its instances&quot;. All red things are similar in that there is the &quot;same universal&quot;, redness, in each thing. There is no Platonic Form of redness, standing apart from all red things; instead, each red thing has a copy of the same property, redness. For the Aristotelian, knowledge of the universals is not obtained from a supernatural source. It is obtained from experience by means of active intellect.

==Overview==
In Aristotle&#x27;s view, universals can be instantiated multiple times. He states that &quot;one and the same universal&quot;, such as applehood, appears in every real apple. A common sense challenge would be to inquire what remains &quot;exactly the same&quot; in all these different things, since the theory is claiming that something remains the same. Stating that different beautiful things, such as the Pacific Ocean, The Eiffel Tower, or the nighttime sky is beautiful is just to say that each thing is the same (qualitatively) in terms of beauty. Aristotle is talking about a category of being here that is not a thing but a quality. A common defense of Aristotle&#x27;s realism is therefore that we should not expect universals to behave like ordinary physical objects. To say the same universal, beautiful, occurs simultaneously in all these things is no more strange than saying that each thing is beautiful.

A second issue is whether Aristotelian universals are abstract: if they are, then the theory must deal with how to abstract the concept of redness from one or more red things. Aristotle argued that people form concepts and make generalizations in the manner of a young child, who is just on the verge of grasping a generic concept such as &quot;human being&quot;. In his view, the child is gathering his or her memories of various encounters with individual humans, searching for the essential similarity that stands out, on reflection, in every instance. Today, it might be said that one mentally extracts from each thing the quality that they all have in common. When the child grasps the concept of a human being, he or she has learnt to ignore the accidental details of each person&#x27;s past experiences and individual differences, and has paid attention to the relevant quality that &quot;they all have in common&quot;, namely, humanity. In Aristotle&#x27;s view, the universal &quot;humanity&quot; is a &quot;natural kind&quot; defined by the essential properties that all humans have in common.

<text>A panel show or panel game is a radio or television game show in which a panel of celebrities participate. Celebrity panelists may compete with each other, such as on &quot;The News Quiz&quot;; facilitate play by non-celebrity contestants, such as on &quot;Match Game&quot; and &quot;Blankety Blank&quot;; or do both, such as on &quot;Wait Wait Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot;. The genre can be traced to 1938, when &quot;Information Please&quot; debuted on U.S. radio. The earliest known television panel show is &quot;Play the Game&quot;, a charades show in 1946. The modern trend of comedy panel shows can find early roots with &quot;Stop Me If You&#x27;ve Heard This One&quot; in 1939 and &quot;Can You Top This?&quot; in 1940. While panel shows were more popular in the past in the U.S., they are still very common in the United Kingdom.

==Format==
While many early panel shows stuck to the traditional quiz show format in which celebrities tried to get the right answers and win, the primary goal of modern panel shows is to entertain the audience with comedy, with the game or quiz structure providing subjects for the comedians to joke about. Panel shows also feature comedic banter, friendly ribbing and camaraderie among the panelists. Scoring is often deemphasised in panel shows. The American version of &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; acknowledged this with the introduction, &quot;Welcome to &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway&quot;, the show where everything&#x27;s made up and the points don&#x27;t matter.&quot; &quot;QI&quot;&#x27;s opaque scoring system is purportedly a mystery even to its creator, &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t A Clue&quot; dispenses with points altogether, and many other shows mention points only occasionally or at the end, instead of continuously displaying scores in front of players.

Panel shows can have any number of themes. Many are topical and satirical, such as &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot;, &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, &quot;The News Quiz&quot; and &quot;Mock the Week&quot;. &quot;8 Out of 10 Cats&quot; is based on opinion polling; &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; is about occupations; &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; and &quot;Face the Music&quot; center on music; &quot;A League of Their Own&quot;, &quot;A Question of Sport&quot; and &quot;They Think It&#x27;s All Over&quot; are sports-themed; &quot;Was It Something I Said?&quot;, &quot;Quote... Unquote&quot; and &quot;Who Said That?&quot; feature quotations; &quot;My Word!&quot; involves wordplay; &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot; is about secrets; &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, &quot;Would I Lie to You?&quot; and &quot;The Unbelievable Truth&quot; deal with lies; and &quot;It Pays to Be Ignorant&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot; are parodies.

Some panel shows are variations of classic parlor games. &quot;Twenty Questions&quot; is based on the parlor game of the same name, &quot;Give Us a Clue&quot; is modelled after charades, and &quot;Call My Bluff&quot; and &quot;Balderdash&quot; are based on fictionary.

Frequently, a panel show features recurring panelists or permanent team captains, and some panelists appear on multiple panel shows. Most shows are recorded before a studio audience.

==International production==

===United States===
The first known example of a panel show in the world is the radio program &quot;Information Please&quot;, which debuted on 17 May 1938 on the NBC Blue Network. An evolution of the quiz show format, &quot;Information Please&quot; added the key element of a panel of celebrities, largely writers and intellectuals, but also actors and politicians. Listeners would mail in questions, winning prizes for stumping the panel.

U.S. panel shows transferred to television early in the medium&#x27;s history, with the first known example being &quot;Play the Game&quot;, a charades show that aired on DuMont and ABC beginning in 1946. The celebrity charades concept has been replicated numerous times since then. The most popular adaptation was &quot;Pantomime Quiz&quot;, airing from 1947 to 1959, and having runs on each of the four television networks operating at the time. Other charades shows have included &quot;Stump the Stars&quot;; &quot;Movietown, RSVP&quot;; &quot;Celebrity Charades&quot;; &quot;Showoffs&quot; and &quot;Body Language&quot;.

TV panel shows saw their peak of popularity in the 1950s and &#x27;60s, when CBS ran the three longest-running panel shows in prime time: &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot; and &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;. At times, they were among the top ten shows on U.S. television, and they continue to experience occasional revivals. All three Goodson-Todman primetime shows were cancelled by CBS in 1967 amid ratings declines and trouble attracting younger viewers, although the programs were consistently profitable by being among the cheapest television shows to produce. Their cancellations came as attention to demographics and a focus on younger viewers gained currency among advertisers. The departures of these three New York–based shows were also part of a mass migration of television production to Los Angeles, leaving only one primetime show produced on the East Coast.

Later years saw several successes in the format, with &quot;Match Game&quot;; &quot;The Hollywood Squares&quot;; &quot;Win, Lose or Draw&quot;; &quot;Celebrity Sweepstakes&quot;; &quot;Password&quot; and &quot;Pyramid&quot; primarily running in the daytime and airing in their greatest numbers during the &#x27;70s and &#x27;80s. These panel shows marked a shift in the format: whereas CBS&#x27; primetime shows had panelists guessing secrets about the guests, these new shows largely featured civilian contestants playing games with celebrity partners, or competing to either predict how the panelists will respond to a prompt or question, or determine whether the panelist answered a question correctly. Later, Nickelodeon premiered the youth-oriented panel game &quot;Figure it Out&quot; in 1997, the American version of &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; had a primetime run from 1998 to 2004 on ABC and a revival in 2013 by The CW, while &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot; has become a popular weekend show on NPR since 1998.

Since 2002, the sports channel ESPN has broadcast &quot;Around the Horn&quot; as part of its daytime block of sports news and discussion shows. While presented as being a roundtable debate show, the series does contain some game show-like elements; the panel of sports journalists earn points from the host based on the strength of their points and arguments in specific topics (and may also mute panelists, if needed), with the lowest scorers eliminated at points throughout the show. The winner receives 30 seconds at the end of the show to discuss any topic unopposed.

In 2015, ABC announced primetime revivals for &quot;Match Game&quot;, which ran from 2016 until 2021, and &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, which ran from 2016 to 2022. From 2013 to 2017, Comedy Central aired &quot;@midnight&quot;, an internet culture and social media-themed panel game which used a more quiz show-styled presentation—with the celebrity guests buzzing in to earn points from the host for punchlines and responses in various segments. In 2024, a reboot of the show, now titled &quot;After Midnight&quot; and hosted by Taylor Tomlinson, premiered on CBS.

The streaming service Dropout has received attention for many of its shows&#x27; similarities to panel shows, notably &quot;Game Changer&quot;.

===United Kingdom===

Panel shows are particularly popular in the United Kingdom, where they have found continued success since the BBC adapted its first radio panel shows from classic parlor games. Perhaps the earliest UK panel show is the BBC radio adaptation of &quot;Twenty Questions&quot;, which debuted on 28 February 1947. Panel shows can have decades-long runs in the UK: &quot;Twenty Questions&quot; lasted until 1976, while &quot;Just a Minute&quot; has remained on the air, and had Nicholas Parsons as host from 1967 until 2019. Other long-running games on radio include &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot; since 1972, &quot;The News Quiz&quot; since 1977, &quot;My Word!&quot; from 1956 to 1988, and &quot;My Music&quot; from 1967 to 1994.

The British version of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; may have been the first television panel show in the UK, with an original run from 1951 to 1963 and several remakes in later years. The word game &quot;Call My Bluff&quot; aired from 1965 to 2005, the charades show &quot;Give Us a Clue&quot; ran from 1979 to 1992, and the improv game &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; aired from 1988 to 1998. Current British panel shows have become showcases for the nation&#x27;s top stand-up and improv comedians, as well as career-making opportunities for new comedians. Regular comics on panel shows often go on to star in sitcoms and other TV shows.

The modern British panel show format of TV comedy quizzes started with &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, a loose adaptation of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;The News Quiz&quot;. &quot;HIGNFY&quot;, as the show is sometimes known, began airing in 1990, and has been the most-viewed show of the night, regularly attracting as much as a 20% audience share. The show&#x27;s success grew after its transfer from BBC Two to the flagship BBC One in 2000.

After &quot;HIGNFY&quot;&#x27;s success, panel shows proliferated on British TV. Notable example include &quot;QI&quot; on various BBC channels since 2003, &quot;Mock the Week&quot; on BBC Two from 2005 to 2022, &quot;8 Out of 10 Cats&quot; on Channel 4 since 2005, &quot;Would I Lie to You?&quot; on BBC One since 2007, and the annual special, &quot;The Big Fat Quiz of the Year&quot; on Channel 4 since 2004. 

On the radio, &quot;The News Quiz&quot;, &quot;Just a Minute&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot; and &quot;The Unbelievable Truth&quot; are among the most popular and long-running panel shows, all of which air on BBC Radio 4.

British comedy panel shows feature mainly male guests. A 2016 study that analysed 4,700 episodes from 1967 to 2016 found that 1,488 of them had an all-male lineup, and only one an all-female cast. The proportion of women rose from 3% in 1989 to 31% in 2016. 

===Australia===
Australian panel shows include advertising-focused &quot;The Gruen Transfer&quot; and its various spinoffs on ABC1 since 2008, the music quiz &quot;Spicks and Specks&quot; on ABC1 from 2005 to 2011 and again since 2014, news quiz &quot;Have You Been Paying Attention?&quot; on Network Ten since 2013, and tabloid quiz &quot;Dirty Laundry Live&quot; on ABC1 and ABC2 since 2013. News quiz &quot;Good News Week&quot; aired on ABC1 from 1996 to 1998 and on Network Ten from 1999-2000 and again from 2008 to 2012, sports quiz &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; aired on Network Ten in 2013, and pop culture quiz &quot;Tractor Monkeys&quot; aired on ABC1 in 2013.

===New Zealand===
Currently running New Zealand panel shows include the news quiz &quot;7 Days&quot; since 2009, &quot;Have You Been Paying Attention? New Zealand&quot; since 2019, &quot;Taskmaster New Zealand&quot; since 2020, and &quot;Guy Montgomery&#x27;s Guy Mont-Spelling Bee&quot; since 2023.

===Canada===
CBC Radio One currently broadcasts two long-running radio panel shows: &quot;The Debaters&quot;, which debuted in 2006, and &quot;Because News&quot;, which debuted in 2015.

In 2022, Noovo began broadcasting &quot;Le maître du jeu&quot;, a local French language adaptation of &quot;Taskmaster&quot;.

====Former shows====
In 2014, Super Channel ordered 36 episodes of a panel show called &quot;Too Much Information&quot;. A revival of &quot;Match Game&quot; aired on The Comedy Network from 2012 to 2014, the news quiz &quot;Front Page Challenge&quot; aired on CBC Television from 1957 to 1995, and the charades show &quot;Party Game&quot; aired in syndication from 1970 to 1981.

===France===
French panel shows include &#x27; (&quot;Friday, Everything Goes&quot;), an improv game on TF1 since 2011. Earlier panel shows include &#x27;, a linguistic game on ORTF and TF1 from 1969 to 1981; &#x27; (&quot;The Academy of Nine&quot;), based on &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; on Antenne 2 from 1982 to 1987; &quot;Cluedo&quot;, based on the board game Cluedo/Clue on France 3 from 1994 to 1995; &quot;Burger Quiz&quot; on Canal + from 2001 to 2002; &#x27; (&quot;Incredible Experiences&quot;), about scientific experiments on France 2 and France 3 from 2008 to 2012; and &quot;&quot; (&quot;Sofa Quiz&quot;), an adaptation of Hollywood Game Night on TMC in 2014.

===Germany===
German panel shows include &quot;7 Tage, 7 Köpfe&quot; (&quot;7 Days, 7 Heads&quot;), &quot;Genial daneben&quot; (&quot;Idiot Savant&quot;), &quot;Kopfball&quot; (&quot;Headball&quot;), &quot;Die Montagsmaler&quot; (&quot;Pictionary&quot;), &quot;Noch Besserwissen&quot; (&quot;Even Better Knowledge&quot;), &quot;Pssst …&quot; (similar to &quot;I&#x27;ve Got A Secret&quot;), &quot;Die Pyramide&quot; (the German version of &quot;Pyramid&quot;), &quot;Quizfire&quot;, &quot;Sag die Wahrheit&quot; (&quot;Tell the Truth&quot;, the German version of &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;), &quot;Typisch Frau – Typisch Mann&quot; (&quot;Typical Woman – Typical Man&quot;), &quot;Was bin ich?&quot; (&quot;What am I?&quot;, the German version of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;) and &quot;Was denkt Deutschland?&quot; (&quot;What Does Germany Think?&quot;).

===Japan===
Early Japanese panel shows include 話の泉 (&quot;Source of the Story&quot;), based on &quot;Information Please&quot; on NHK Radio 1 from 1946 to 1964; 二十の扉 (&quot;Twenty Doors&quot;), based on &quot;Twenty Questions&quot; on NHK Radio 1 from 1947 to 1960; ジェスチャー (&quot;Gestures&quot;), a charades show on NHK General TV from 1953 to 1968; and 私の秘密 (&quot;My Secret&quot;), based on &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot; on NHK General TV from 1956 to 1967.

Currently, a wide variety of Japanese variety shows are popular, and many of them feature owarai comedians, Japanese idols, and other celebrities playing games.

Some games involve bizarre physical stunts. &quot;Brain Wall&quot;, adapted in English-speaking countries as &quot;Hole in the Wall&quot;, has comedians attempt to jump through oddly shaped holes in moving walls without falling into water, &quot;DERO&quot; and its successor &quot;TORE&quot; have celebrities solve mental and physical challenges to escape traps and hazards or presumably die trying, &quot;VS Arashi&quot; has a team of celebrities compete against J-pop group Arashi and their Plus One guest(s) in physical games, &quot;Nep League&quot; has various celebrity teams competing in various quizzes that test their combined brainpower in the fields of Japanese, English, General Knowledge, Etc., and &quot;AKBingo!&quot; similarly features members of pop group AKB48 and others competing in physical challenges and quizzes.

Other shows include 日本語探Qバラエティ クイズ!それマジ!?ニッポン (&quot;Is it really!?&quot;), a celebrity word game; くりぃむクイズ ミラクル9 (&quot;Miracle 9&quot;), a show somewhat similar to Hollywood Squares; &quot;Numer0n&quot;, a celebrity numbers game; and オールスター感謝祭 (&quot;All Star Thanksgiving&quot;), a semi-annual celebrity quiz. There are many other games featuring celebrities within Japan&#x27;s variety genre.

&quot;Prime Minister Ōta&quot; is a show featuring many comedians and politicians debating fictional proposals in a sort of game show version of a legislative chamber.

<doc id="179693" wikidata="Q1378083" url="?curid=179693" title="Red Lady of Paviland">
<text>The Red &quot;Lady&quot; of Paviland () is an Upper Paleolithic partial male skeleton dyed in red ochre and buried in Wales 33,000 BP (approximately 31,000 BCE). The bones were discovered in 1823 by William Buckland in an archaeological dig at Goat&#x27;s Hole Cave (Paviland cave) which is a limestone cave between Port Eynon and Rhossili on the Gower Peninsula, near Swansea in south Wales. Buckland believed the skeleton was a Roman era female. Later, William Solace examined Goat&#x27;s Cave Paviland in 1912. There, Solace found flint arrow heads and tools and correctly concluded that the skeleton was in fact a male hunter-gatherer or warrior during the last Ice Age.

Goat&#x27;s Hole was occupied throughout prehistory. Artefacts are predominantly Aurignacian, but also include examples from the earlier Mousterian, and later Gravettian and Creswellian periods. The site is the oldest known ceremonial burial in Western Europe.

There have been calls to return the red skeleton of Paviland to Wales where it was discovered and also specifically to Swansea.

==History==

=== Discovery ===
In 1822, Daniel Davies and the Rev John Davies found animal bones, including the tusk of a mammoth. The Talbot family of Penrice Castle was informed and found &quot;bones of elephants&quot; on 27 December 1822. William Buckland, Professor of Geology at Oxford University arrived on 18 January 1823 and spent a week at the location site, Goat&#x27;s Hole. Later that year, writing about his find in his book &quot;Reliquiae Diluvianae&quot; (Remains or relics of the Flood), Buckland stated: 

Buckland&#x27;s treatise misjudged both its age and sex. He believed that human remains could not be older than the Biblical Great Flood, and thus wildly underestimated its true age, believing the remains to date to the Roman era. Buckland believed the skeleton was female largely because it was discovered with decorative items, including perforated seashell necklaces and jewellery thought to be of elephant ivory but now known to be carved from the tusk of a mammoth.

=== Later findings ===

William Solace made an expedition to Goat&#x27;s Cave Paviland in 1912. There, Solace found flint arrow heads and tools and correctly concluded that the skeleton was, in fact, a male hunter-gatherer or warrior during the last Ice Age. Over the last 100 years the date estimated by Solace has been shifted from the Mesolithic period (4-10,000 BCE) to the Palaeolithic era (35,000/10,000 BCE) of the last Ice Age. However, before radiocarbon dating was invented in the 1950s, there was no existing scientific method for the determination of the age of any prehistoric remains. 

In the 1960s, Kenneth Oakley published a radiocarbon determination of 18,460 ± 340 BP. Results published in 1989 and 1995 suggest that the individual from the cave lived about 26,000 years ago (26,350 ± 550 BP, OxA-1815), during the later periods of the Upper Paleolithic. A 2007 examination by Thomas Higham of Oxford University and Roger Jacobi of the British Museum suggested a dating of 29,000 years ago. A recalibration of the results in 2009 suggest an age of 33,000 years.

Although now on the coast, at the time of the burial, the cave would have been located approximately 110 km (70 miles) inland, overlooking a plain. When the remains were dated to some 26,000 years ago, it was thought the &quot;Red Lady&quot; lived at a time when an ice sheet of the most recent glacial period in the British Isles, called the Devensian Glaciation, would have been advancing towards the site, and that consequently the weather would have been more like that of present-day Siberia, with maximum temperatures of perhaps 10°C in summer, −20° in winter, and a tundra vegetation. The new dating, however, indicates he lived during a warmer period.

Bone protein analysis indicates that he lived on a diet of between 15% and 20% fish, which, together with the distance from the sea, suggests that the people may have been semi-nomadic, or that the tribe transported the body from a coastal region for burial.

When the skeleton was discovered, Wales lacked a museum to house it, so it was moved to Oxford University, where Buckland was a professor. The bones are currently on display at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. In December 2007, it was loaned for a year to the National Museum Cardiff. Subsequent excavations yielded more than 4,000 flints, teeth and bones, needles and bracelets, which are on exhibit at Swansea Museum and the National Museum in Cardiff.

==Evidence of earliest modern humans==
Analysis of the evidence from the two excavations at Long Hole Cave on the Gower Peninsula, including sediment and pollen as well as the lithic evidence, has identified Long Hole as an Aurignacian site contemporary with and related to the site at Paviland, evidence of the first modern humans in Britain.

== Proposed return to Wales ==
The Red Lady of Paviland (which is actually a man) was discovered in 1823 by William Buckland a geology professor at Oxford University, and it was quickly transported to Oxford thereafter (some other artefacts were later repatriated). This prompted a two-century campaign for it to be repatriated.

In January 2023, the artefact was nicknamed the &quot;Welsh Elgin Marbles&quot;, after another artefact with calls for repatriation from the British Museum to Greece. The Red Lady is currently on display in the University of Oxford’s Museum of Natural History, and is described to be &quot;well cared for&quot;. It has been stated by academics at Cardiff University, that if it were to return, it would enhance Wales&#x27;s national collection and draw attention to its archaeology and caves.

University of Liverpool and Coimbra University in Portugal Prof George Nash says, &quot;Some have attempted to portray the remains as some sort of ancient Welsh ancestor, which is palpable nonsense. Whoever he was, he was almost certainly of African or Arabian distinction, fleeing conflict or over-crowding in his more hospitable homeland. What&#x27;s more, after the brief thaw of the Palaeolithic era, Wales was cut off again for several thousand years, so there&#x27;s absolutely no chance of these remains having any genetic or cultural relationship to any modern Welsh person&quot;. However, he also acknowledged that the Red Lady &quot;is a significant part of Welsh history&quot;, and stated that if the remains could be safely returned to Wales then that &quot;would definitely be the right thing to do&quot;.

<doc id="179706" wikidata="Q34233" url="?curid=179706" title="Okinawan language">
<text>Okinawan (, , , ), or more precisely Central Okinawan, is a Northern Ryukyuan language spoken primarily in the southern half of the island of Okinawa, as well as in the surrounding islands of Kerama, Kumejima, Tonaki, Aguni and a number of smaller peripheral islands. Central Okinawan distinguishes itself from the speech of Northern Okinawa, which is classified independently as the Kunigami language. Both languages are listed by UNESCO as endangered.

Though Okinawan encompasses a number of local dialects, the Shuri–Naha variant is generally recognized as the &quot;de facto&quot; standard, as it had been used as the official language of the Ryukyu Kingdom since the reign of King Shō Shin (1477–1526). Moreover, as the former capital of Shuri was built around the royal palace, the language used by the royal court became the regional and literary standard, which thus flourished in songs and poems written during that era.

Today, most Okinawans speak Okinawan Japanese, although a number of people still speak the Okinawan language, most often the elderly. Within Japan, Okinawan is often not seen as a language unto itself but is referred to as the , or more specifically the . Okinawan speakers are undergoing language shift as they switch to Japanese, since language use in Okinawa today is far from stable. Okinawans are assimilating and accenting standard Japanese due to the similarity of the two languages, the standardized and centralized education system, the media, business and social contact with mainlanders and previous attempts from Japan to suppress the native languages. Okinawan is still kept alive in popular music, tourist shows and in theaters featuring a local drama called , which depict local customs and manners.

==History==

===Pre-Ryukyu Kingdom===
Okinawan is a Japonic language, derived from Proto-Japonic and is therefore related to Japanese. The split between Old Japanese and the Ryukyuan languages has been estimated to have occurred as early as the 1st century AD to as late as the 12th century AD. Chinese and Japanese characters were first introduced by a Japanese missionary in 1265.

===Ryukyu Kingdom era===
====Pre-Satsuma====
 was a much more popular writing system than kanji; thus, Okinawan poems were commonly written solely in or with little kanji. Okinawan became the official language under King Shō Shin. The Omoro Sōshi, a compilation of ancient Ryukyuan poems, was written in an early form of Okinawan, known as Old Okinawan.

====Post-Satsuma to annexation====
After Ryukyu became a vassal of Satsuma Domain, kanji gained more prominence in poetry; however, official Ryukyuan documents were written in Classical Chinese. During this time, the language gradually evolved into Modern Okinawan.

In 1609, the Ryukyu Kingdom was colonized by the Satsuma Domain in the south of Japan. However, Satsuma did not fully invade the Ryukyu in fear of colliding with China, which had a stronger trading relationship with the Ryukyu at the time.

===Japanese annexation to end of World War II===
When Ryukyu was annexed by Japan in 1879, the majority of people on Okinawa Island spoke Okinawan. Within 10 years, the Japanese government began an assimilation policy of Japanization, where Ryukyuan languages were gradually suppressed. The education system was the heart of Japanization, where Okinawan children were taught Japanese and punished for speaking their native language, being told that their language was just a &quot;dialect&quot;.

Language shift to Japanese in Ryukyu/Okinawa began in 1879 when the Japanese government annexed Ryukyu and established Okinawa Prefecture. The prefectural office mainly consisted of people from Kagoshima Prefecture where the Satsuma Domain used to be. This caused the modernization of Okinawa as well as language shift to Japanese. As a result, Japanese became the standard language for administration, education, media, and literature.

In 1902, the began the linguistic unification of Japan to Standard Japanese. This caused the linguistic stigmatization of many local varieties in Japan including Okinawan. As the discrimination accelerated, Okinawans themselves started to abandon their languages and shifted to Standard Japanese.

Okinawan dialect cards, similar to Welsh Not in Wales, were adopted in Okinawa, Japan.

By 1945, many Okinawans spoke Japanese, and many were bilingual. During the Battle of Okinawa, some Okinawans were killed by Japanese soldiers for speaking Okinawan.

==== American occupation ====
Under American administration, there was an attempt to revive and standardize Okinawan, but this proved difficult and was shelved in favor of Japanese. General Douglas MacArthur attempted to promote Okinawan languages and culture through education. Multiple English words were introduced.

===Return to Japan to present day===
After Okinawa&#x27;s reversion to Japanese sovereignty, Japanese continued to be the dominant language used, and the majority of the youngest generations only speak Okinawan Japanese. There have been attempts to revive Okinawan by notable people such as Byron Fija and Seijin Noborikawa, but few native Okinawans know the language.

===Outside of Japan===
The Okinawan language is still spoken by communities of Okinawan immigrants in Brazil. The first immigrants from the island of Okinawa to Brazil landed in the Port of Santos in 1908 drawn by the hint of work and farmable land. Once in a new country and far from their homeland, they found themselves in a place where there was no prohibition of their language, allowing them to willingly speak, celebrate and preserve their speech and culture, up to the present day. Currently the Okinawan-Japanese centers and communities in the State of São Paulo are a world reference to this language helping it to stay alive. Courses in Okinawan language and literature are offered at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa and books in Uchinaaguchi have been published in Hawaii.

==Classification==

Okinawan is sometimes grouped with Kunigami as the Okinawan languages; however, not all linguists accept this grouping, some claiming that Kunigami is a dialect of Okinawan. Okinawan is also grouped with Amami (or the Amami languages) as the Northern Ryukyuan languages.

===Dialect of the Japanese language===

Since the creation of Okinawa Prefecture, Okinawan has been labeled a dialect of Japanese as part of a policy of assimilation. Later, Japanese linguists, such as Tōjō Misao, who studied the Ryukyuan languages argued that they are indeed dialects. This is due to the misconception that Japan is a homogeneous state (one people, one language, one nation), and classifying the Ryukyuan languages as such would discredit this assumption. The present-day official stance of the Japanese government remains that Okinawan is a dialect, and it is common within the Japanese population for it to be called or , which means &quot;Okinawa dialect (of Japanese)&quot;. The policy of assimilation, coupled with increased interaction between Japan and Okinawa through media and economics, has led to the development of Okinawan Japanese, which is a dialect of Japanese influenced by the Okinawan and Kunigami languages. Japanese and Okinawan only share 60% of the same vocabulary, despite both being Japonic languages.

===Dialects of the Ryukyuan language===

Okinawan linguist Seizen Nakasone states that the Ryukyuan languages are in fact groupings of similar dialects. As each community has its own distinct dialect, there is no &quot;one language&quot;. Nakasone attributes this diversity to the isolation caused by immobility, citing the story of his mother who wanted to visit the town of Nago but never made the 25 km trip before she died of old age.

The contemporary dialects in Ryukyuan language are divided into three large groups: Amami-Okinawa dialects, Miyako-Yaeyama dialects, and the Yonaguni dialect. All of them are mutually unintelligible. Amami is located in the Kagoshima prefecture but it belongs to the Ryukyuan group linguistically. The Yonaguni dialect is very different in phonetics from the other groups but it comes closest to the Yaeyama dialect lexically.

===Its own distinct language===
Outside Japan, Okinawan is considered a separate language from Japanese. This was first proposed by Basil Hall Chamberlain, who compared the relationship between Okinawan and Japanese to that of the Romance languages. UNESCO has marked it as an endangered language.

== Sociolinguistics ==
UNESCO listed six Okinawan language varieties as endangered languages in 2009. The endangerment of Okinawan is largely due to the shift to Standard Japanese. Throughout history, Okinawan languages have been treated as dialects of Standard Japanese. For instance, in the 20th century, many schools used &quot;dialect tags&quot; to punish the students who spoke in Okinawan. Consequently, many of the remaining speakers today are choosing not to transmit their languages to younger generations due to the stigmatization of the languages in the past.

There have been several revitalization efforts made to reverse this language shift. However, Okinawan is still poorly taught in formal institutions due to the lack of support from the Okinawan Education Council: education in Okinawa is conducted exclusively in Japanese, and children do not study Okinawan as their second language at school. As a result, at least two generations of Okinawans have grown up without any proficiency in their local languages both at home and school.

Okinawan vocabulary is about 39% lexically similar with Japanese and The Okinawan language is only 71% lexically similar to, or cognate with, standard Japanese. Even the southernmost Japanese dialect (Kagoshima dialect) is only 72% cognate with the northernmost Ryukyuan language (Amami). The Kagoshima dialect of Japanese, however, is 80% lexically similar to Standard Japanese.

== Phonology ==

=== Vowels ===

The Okinawan language has five vowels, all of which may be long or short, though the short vowels and are quite rare, as they occur only in a few native Okinawan words with heavy syllables with the pattern or , such as &quot;mensōrē&quot; &quot;welcome&quot; or &quot;tonfā&quot;. The close back vowels and are truly rounded, rather than the compressed vowels of standard Japanese.

=== Consonants ===

The Okinawan language counts some 20 distinctive segments shown in the chart below, with major allophones presented in parentheses.

The only consonant that can occur as a syllable coda is the . Many analyses treat it as an additional phoneme , the moraic nasal, though it never contrasts with or .

The consonant system of the Okinawan language is fairly similar to that of standard Japanese, but it does present a few differences on the phonemic and allophonic level. Namely, Okinawan retains the labialized consonants and which were lost in Late Middle Japanese, possesses a glottal stop , features a voiceless bilabial fricative distinct from the aspirate , and has two distinctive affricates which arose from a number of different sound processes. Additionally, Okinawan lacks the major allophones and found in Japanese, having historically fronted the vowel to after the alveolars , consequently merging &quot;tsu&quot; into &quot;chi&quot;, &quot;su&quot; into &quot;shi&quot;, and both &quot;dzu&quot; and &quot;zu&quot; into &quot;ji&quot;. It also lacks as a distinctive phoneme, having merged it into .

====Bilabial and glottal fricatives====
The bilabial fricative has sometimes been transcribed as the cluster , since, like Japanese, allophonically labializes into before the high vowel , and does not occur before the rounded vowel . This suggests that an overlap between and exists, and so the contrast in front of other vowels can be denoted through labialization. However, this analysis fails to take account of the fact that Okinawan has not fully undergone the diachronic change → → as in Japanese, and that the suggested clusterization and labialization into is unmotivated. Consequently, the existence of must be regarded as independent of , even though the two overlap. Barring a few words that resulted from the former change, the aspirate also arose from the odd lenition of and , as well as words loaned from other dialects. Before the glide and the high vowel , it is pronounced closer to , as in Japanese.

====Palatalization====
The plosive consonants and historically palatalized and affricated into before and occasionally following the glide and the high vowel : → &quot;chiri&quot; &quot;fog&quot;, and → &quot;chura-&quot; &quot;beautiful&quot;. This change preceded vowel raising, so that instances where arose from did not trigger palatalization: → &quot;kī&quot; &quot;hair&quot;. Their voiced counterparts and underwent the same effect, becoming under such conditions: → &quot;nnaji&quot; &quot;eel&quot;, and → &quot;nukujiri&quot; &quot;saw&quot;; but → &quot;kagin&quot; &quot;seasoning&quot;.

Both and may or may not also allophonically affricate before the mid vowel , though this pronunciation is increasingly rare. Similarly, the fricative consonant palatalizes into before the glide and the vowel , including when historically derives from : → &quot;shikē&quot; &quot;world&quot;. It may also palatalize before the vowel , especially so in the context of topicalization: &quot;dushi&quot; → &quot;dusē&quot; or &quot;dushē&quot; &quot;(&quot;topic&quot;) friend&quot;.

In general, sequences containing the palatal consonant are relatively rare and tend to exhibit depalatalization. For example, tends to merge with ( &quot;myāku&quot; → &quot;nāku&quot; &quot;Miyako&quot;); has merged into and ( → &quot;rū&quot; ~ &quot;dū&quot; &quot;dragon&quot;); and has mostly become ( &quot;shui&quot; → &quot;sui&quot; &quot;Shuri&quot;).

====Flapping and fortition====
The voiced plosive and the flap tend to merge, with the first becoming a flap in word-medial position, and the second sometimes becoming a plosive in word-initial position. For example, &quot;rū&quot; &quot;dragon&quot; may be strengthened into &quot;dū&quot;, and &quot;hashidu&quot; &quot;door&quot; conversely flaps into &quot;hashiru&quot;. The two sounds do, however, still remain distinct in a number of words and verbal constructions.

====Glottal stop====
Okinawan also features a distinctive glottal stop that historically arose from a process of glottalization of word-initial vowels. Hence, all vowels in Okinawan are predictably glottalized at the beginning of words ( → &quot;ami&quot; &quot;rain&quot;), save for a few exceptions. High vowel loss or assimilation following this process created a contrast with glottalized approximants and nasal consonants. Compare → &quot;wa&quot; &quot;pig&quot; to &quot;wa&quot; &quot;I&quot;, or → &quot;nni&quot; &quot;rice plant&quot; to → &quot;nni&quot; &quot;chest&quot;.

====Moraic nasal====
The moraic nasal has been posited in most descriptions of Okinawan phonology. Like Japanese, (transcribed using the small capital ) occupies a full mora and its precise place of articulation will vary depending on the following consonant. Before other labial consonants, it will be pronounced closer to a syllabic bilabial nasal , as in &quot;nma&quot; &quot;horse&quot;. Before velar and labiovelar consonants, it will be pronounced as a syllabic velar nasal , as in &quot;bingata&quot;, a method of dying clothes. And before alveolar and alveolo-palatal consonants, it becomes a syllabic alveolar nasal , as in &quot;kanda&quot; &quot;vine&quot;. In some varieties, it instead becomes a syllabic uvular nasal . Elsewhere, its exact realization remains unspecified, and it may vary depending on the first sound of the next word or morpheme. In isolation and at the end of utterances, it is realized as a velar nasal .

=== Correspondences with Japanese ===

== Orthography ==

The Okinawan language was historically written using an admixture of kanji and hiragana. The hiragana syllabary is believed to have first been introduced from mainland Japan to the Ryukyu Kingdom some time during the reign of king Shunten in the early thirteenth century. It is likely that Okinawans were already in contact with &quot;hanzi&quot; (Chinese characters) due to extensive trade between the Ryukyu Kingdom and China, Japan and Korea. However, hiragana gained more widespread acceptance throughout the Ryukyu Islands, and most documents and letters were exclusively transcribed using this script, in contrast to in Japan where writing solely in hiragana was considered &quot;women&#x27;s script&quot;. The &quot;Omoro Sōshi&quot; (), a sixteenth-century compilation of songs and poetry, and a few preserved writs of appointments dating from the same century were written solely in Hiragana. Kanji were gradually adopted due to the growing influence of mainland Japan and to the linguistic affinity between the Okinawan and Japanese languages. However, it was mainly limited to affairs of high importance and to documents sent towards the mainland. The oldest inscription of Okinawan exemplifying its use along with Hiragana can be found on a stone stele at the Tamaudun mausoleum, dating back to 1501.

After the invasion of Okinawa by the Shimazu clan of Satsuma in 1609, Okinawan ceased to be used in official affairs. It was replaced by standard Japanese writing and a form of Classical Chinese writing known as kanbun. Despite this change, Okinawan still continued to prosper in local literature up until the nineteenth century. Following the Meiji Restoration, the Japanese government abolished the domain system and formally annexed the Ryukyu Islands to Japan as the Okinawa Prefecture in 1879. To promote national unity, the government then introduced standard education and opened Japanese-language schools based on the Tokyo dialect. Students were discouraged and chastised for speaking or even writing in the local &quot;dialect&quot;, notably through the use of &quot;dialect cards&quot; (). As a result, Okinawan gradually ceased to be written entirely until the American takeover in 1945.

Since then, Japanese and American scholars have variously transcribed the regional language using a number of ad hoc romanization schemes or the katakana syllabary to demarcate its foreign nature with standard Japanese. Proponents of Okinawan tend to be more traditionalist and continue to write the language using hiragana with kanji. In any case, no standard or consensus concerning spelling issues has ever been formalized, so discrepancies between modern literary works are common.

===Syllabary===
Technically, they are not syllables, but rather morae. Each mora in Okinawan will consist of one or two kana characters. If two, then a smaller version of kana follows the normal sized kana. In each cell of the table below, the top row is the kana (hiragana to the left, katakana to the right of the dot), the middle row in rōmaji (Hepburn romanization), and the bottom row in IPA.

== Grammar ==
Okinawan follows a subject–object–verb word order and makes large use of particles as in Japanese. Okinawan retains a number of Japonic grammatical features also found in Old Japanese but lost (or highly restricted) in Modern Japanese, such as a distinction between the terminal form () and the attributive form (), the genitive function of &quot;ga&quot; (lost in the Shuri dialect), the nominative function of &quot;nu&quot; (cf. Japanese: &quot;no&quot;), as well as honorific/plain distribution of &quot;ga&quot; and &quot;nu&quot; in nominative use.
One etymology given for the &quot;-un&quot; and &quot;-uru&quot; endings is the continuative form suffixed with &quot;uri&quot; (&quot;to be; to exist&quot;, cf. Classical Japanese: &quot;wori&quot;): &quot;-un&quot; developed from the terminal form &quot;uri&quot;; &quot;-uru&quot; developed from the attributive form &quot;uru&quot;, i.e.:
* &quot;kachuru&quot; derives from &quot;kachi-uru&quot;;
* &quot;kachun&quot; derives from &quot;kachi-uri&quot;; and
* &quot;yumun&quot; (&quot;to read&quot;, cf. Japanese: &quot;yomu&quot;) derives from &quot;yumi&quot; + &quot;uri&quot;.

A similar etymology is given for the terminal &quot;-san&quot; and attributive &quot;-saru&quot; endings for adjectives: the stem suffixed with &quot;sa&quot; (nominalises adjectives, i.e. high → height, hot → heat), suffixed with &quot;ari&quot; (&quot;to be; to exist; to have&quot;, cf. Classical Japanese: &quot;ari&quot;), i.e.:

* &quot;takasan&quot; (&quot;high; tall&quot;, cf. Japanese: &quot;takai&quot;) derives from &quot;taka-sa-ari&quot;;
* &quot;achisan&quot; (&quot;hot; warm&quot;, cf. Japanese: &quot;atsui&quot;) derives from &quot;atsu-sa-ari&quot;; and
* &quot;yutasaru&quot; (&quot;good; pleasant&quot;, cf. Japanese: 豊かな &quot;yutakana&quot; &quot;abundant; plentiful&quot;) derives from &quot;yuta-sa-aru&quot;.

===Parts of speech===

====Nouns (名詞)====

Nouns are classified as independent, non-conjugating part of speech that can become a subject of a sentence

====Pronouns (代名詞)====
Pronouns are classified the same as nouns, except that pronouns are more broad.

====Adverbs (副詞)====

Adverbs are classified as an independent, non-conjugating part of speech that cannot become a subject of a sentence and modifies a declinable word (用言; verbs, adverbs, adjectives) that comes after the adverb. There are two main categories to adverbs and several subcategories within each category, as shown in the table below.

====Prenominal adjectives (連体詞)====

====Conjunctions (接続詞)====

====Interjections and exclamations (感動詞)====

====Verbs (動詞)====

Verbs are classified as an independent, conjugating part of speech that shows movements. The conclusive form ends in .

====Adjectives (形容詞)====

Adjectives are classified as an independent, conjugating part of speech that shows property or state. The conclusive form ends in .

====(存在動詞)====

存在動詞 are classified as an independent, conjugating part of speech that shows existence or decision of a certain thing. attaches to a substantive.

====Adjectival verbs (形容動詞)====

Adjectival verbs are classified as an independent, conjugating part of speech that shows the state of existence of events. attaches to words that shows state.

====Auxiliary verbs (助動詞)====

====Particles (助詞)====


====Prefixes (接頭語)====
====Suffixes (接尾語)====

===Others===
====Copula====

====Question words (疑問詞)====

===Syntax===
The basic word order is subject–object–verb.

Okinawan is a marked nominative language (with the accusative being unmarked) that also shows minor active–stative variation in intransitive verbs relating to existence or emergence. In existence or emergence verbs, the subject may be optionally unmarked (except for pronouns and proper names, which must be marked with &quot;ga&quot;), and marked human subjects cannot use &quot;ga&quot; anymore, but rather always with the often-inanimate marker &quot;nu&quot;.

==Example==
=== Sample text in Standard Okinawan (Shuri-Naha dialect) ===
==== In Kanji ====
人間ー誰ん生まりやぎーなー自由やい、また、胴大切に思ゆる肝とぅ胴守らんでぃる肝ー、誰やてぃんゆぬ如授かとーるむんやん。人間ー元からいー矩ぬ備わとーくとぅ、互ーに兄弟やんでぃる考ーさーに事に当たらんだれーならん。(without ruby)

==== Transliteration ====
&quot;Ninjinō tā n &#x27;nmariyagīnā jiyu yai, mata, dū tēshichi ni umuyuru chimu tu dū mamurandiru chimō, tā yatin yunugutu sajakatōru mun yan. Ninjinō mūtu kara īka ni nu sunawatōkutu, tagē ni chōdēyandiru kangēsā ni kutu ni atarandarē naran.&quot;

<text>Saul Lieberman (, May 28, 1898 – March 23, 1983), also known as Rabbi Shaul Lieberman or, among some of his students, the Gra&quot;sh (&quot;Gaon Rabbeinu Shaul&quot;), was a rabbi and a Talmudic scholar. He served as Professor of Talmud at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTSA) for over 40 years, and for many years was dean of the Harry Fischel Institute in Israel and also president of the American Academy for Jewish Research.

==Early life==
Born in Motal, near Pinsk, Russian Empire (now Belarus), he studied at the Orthodox yeshivot of &quot;Malch,&quot; Slobodka, and Novardok, where, at age 18, he received his smicha&quot;,&quot; the Jewish equivalent of ordination. While studying at the Slobodka yeshiva, he befriended Rabbis Yitzchak Ruderman and Yitzchak Hutner, both of whom would become leaders of great Rabbinical seminaries in America.

In the 1920s he attended the Kyiv Gymnasium and University of Kyiv, and, following a short stay in Palestine, continued his studies in France. In 1928, he settled in Jerusalem. He studied Talmudic philology and Greek language and literature at the Hebrew University.

==Career==
After completing his master&#x27;s degree at Hebrew University, he was appointed lecturer there in Talmud in 1931 or 1932. The position was terminated in 1937 due to poor enrollment. He also taught at the &quot;Mizrachi Teachers Seminary,&quot; and from 1935 was dean of the Harry Fischel Institute for Talmudic Research in Jerusalem.

In 1940, he was invited both by Rabbi Yitzchak Hutner to teach in the Orthodox Yeshiva Chaim Berlin, and by the Jewish Theological Seminary of America to serve as professor of Hellenism and Jewish literature. Lieberman chose the offer by JTS. Lieberman&#x27;s decision was motivated by a desire to &quot;train American Jews to make a commitment to study and observe the mitzvot.&quot; In Chaim Dalfin&#x27;s &quot;Conversations with the Rebbe&quot; (LA: JEC, 1996), pp. 54–63, Prof. Haim Dimitrovski relates that when he was newly hired at JTSA, he asked Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson of Lubavitch whether he should remain in the Seminary, and the response was &quot;as long as Lieberman is there.&quot; In 1949, he was appointed dean, and in 1958 rector, of the Seminary&#x27;s rabbinical school.

Lieberman died on March 23, 1983, while flying to Jerusalem for Passover.

===Work===

In 1929, Lieberman published &quot;Al ha-Yerushalmi&quot;, in which he suggested ways of emending corruptions in the text of the Jerusalem Talmud and offered variant readings to the text of the tractate of Sotah. This was followed by: a series of text studies of the Jerusalem Talmud, which appeared in Tarbiz; by &quot;Talmudah shel Keisaryah&quot; (1931), in which he expressed the view that the first three tractates of the order Nezikin in the Jerusalem Talmud had been compiled in Caesarea about the middle of the fourth century C.E.; and by &quot;Ha-Yerushalmi ki-Feshuto&quot; (1934), a commentary on the treatises Shabbat, Eruvin, and Pesahim of the Jerusalem Talmud (this was the first volume of a series that was never finished). His preoccupation with the Jerusalem Talmud impressed him with the necessity of clarifying the text of the tannaitic sources (rabbis of the first two centuries of the common era), especially that of the Tosefta, on which no commentaries had been composed by the earlier authorities (Rishonim), and to whose elucidation few scholars had devoted themselves in later generations.

He published the four-volume &quot;Tosefeth Rishonim&quot;, a commentary on the entire Tosefta with textual corrections based on manuscripts, early printings, and quotations found in early authorities. He also published &quot;Tashlum Tosefta&quot;, an introductory chapter to the second edition of M. S. Zuckermandel&#x27;s Tosefta edition (1937), dealing with quotations from the Tosefta by early authorities that are not found in the text.

Years later, Lieberman returned to the systematic elucidation of the Tosefta. He undertook the publication of the Tosefta text, based on manuscripts and accompanied by brief explanatory notes, and of an extensive commentary called &quot;Tosefta ki-Fshuṭah&quot;. The latter combined philological research and historical observations with a discussion of the entire talmudic and rabbinic literature in which the relevant Tosefta text is either commented upon or quoted. Between 1955 and 1973, ten volumes of the new edition were published, representing the text and the commentaries on the entire orders of Zera&#x27;im, Mo&#x27;ed and Nashim. Furthermore, in 1988, three volumes were published posthumously on the order of Nezikin, including tractates Bava Kama, Bava Metzia, and Bava Basra. The entire set was republished in the 1990s in thirteen volumes, and again in 2001 in twelve volumes.

In &quot;Sifrei Zuta&quot; (1968), Lieberman advanced the view that this halakhic Midrash was in all likelihood finally edited by Bar Kappara in Lydda.

Other books of his were &quot;Sheki&#x27;in&quot; (1939), on Jewish legends, customs, and literary sources found in Karaite and Christian polemical writings, and &quot;Midreshei Teiman&quot; (1940), wherein he showed that the Yemenite Midrashim had preserved exegetical material which had been deliberately omitted by the rabbis. He edited a variant version of Midrash Debarim Rabbah (1940, 19652). In his view that version had been current among Sephardi Jewry, while the standard text had been that of Ashkenazi Jewry. In 1947 he published &quot;Hilkhot ha-Yerushalmi&quot; which he identified as a fragment of a work by Maimonides on the Jerusalem Talmud in a similar vein as the Rif is to the Babylonian Talmud. Lieberman also edited the hitherto unpublished Tosefta commentary &quot;Hasdei David&quot; by David Pardo on the order Tohorot; the first part of this work appeared in 1970.

His two English volumes, &quot;Greek in Jewish Palestine&quot; (1942) and &quot;Hellenism in Jewish Palestine&quot; (1950), which also appeared in a Hebrew translation, illustrate the influence of Hellenistic culture on Jewish Palestine in the first centuries C.E.

A number of his works have appeared in new and revised editions. Lieberman served as editor in chief of a new critical edition of Maimonides&#x27; Mishneh Torah (vol. 1, 1964), and as an editor of the Judaica series of Yale University, where he worked closely with Herbert Danby, the Anglican scholar of the Mishnah. He also edited several scholarly miscellanies. He contributed numerous studies to scholarly publications as well as notes to books of fellow scholars. In these he dwelt on various aspects of the world of ideas of the rabbis, shed light on events in the talmudic period, and elucidated scores of obscure words and expressions of talmudic and midrashic literature.

He also published a heretofore unknown Midrashic work that he painstakingly pieced together by deriving its text from an anti-Jewish polemic written by Raymond Martini, and various published lectures of Medieval Rabbis. Lieberman&#x27;s work was published while he headed Machon Harry Fishel.

Jacob Neusner, a leading scholar of the history of rabbinic Judaism, criticized the bulk of Lieberman&#x27;s work as idiosyncratic in that it lacked a valid methodology and was prone to other serious shortcomings (&quot;see&quot; Sources below). However, ten years earlier, in an article published shortly after his death, Lieberman strongly criticized Neusner&#x27;s lack of scholarship in the latter&#x27;s translation of three tractates of the Yerushalmi. Meir Bar-Ilan, Lieberman&#x27;s nephew, accused Neusner of being biased against Lieberman due to &quot;a personal issue.&quot;

==Paradox in affiliation==
Perhaps because he was so deeply involved in the Seminary, Lieberman was often accused (esp. post-mortem) of being on the very right wing of Conservative Judaism. Personally fully observant of Halacha, he would not pray in a synagogue which did not have separate seating for men and women. Lieberman insisted that all services at the Seminary&#x27;s Stein Hall, where he prayed daily, have a mechitzah even though the great majority of Conservative synagogues did not. Additionally, Lieberman saw to it that the Seminary synagogue in which he prayed used an Orthodox prayer book, rather than siddurim produced by the Rabbinical Assembly.

==The Lieberman clause==

The Lieberman clause is a clause included in a &quot;ketubah&quot; (Jewish wedding document), created by and named after Saul Lieberman, that stipulates that divorce will be adjudicated by a modern &quot;bet din&quot; (rabbinic court) in order to prevent the problem of the agunah, a woman not allowed to remarry religiously because she had never been granted a religious divorce. It was first introduced in the 1950s by rabbis in Judaism&#x27;s Conservative movement.

==Personal life==
The Chazon Ish, Rabbi Avrohom Yeshaya Korelitz was a first cousin. Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky and Rabbi Joseph Soloveitschik were both his first cousins once removed.

Lieberman married Rachel Rabinowitz in 1922. She was the daughter of Rabbi Laizer Rabinowitz, the rabbi of Minsk, and granddaughter of Yerucham Yehuda Leib Perelmann. They moved to Mandatory Palestine in 1927, but she died three years later, in 1930.

Lieberman studied at Hebrew University and received a Masters degree in Talmudic studies and ancient Palestiniology.

He remarried in 1932, to Judith Berlin (August 14, 1904 – 1978), a daughter of Rabbi Meir Berlin (Bar-Ilan) – leader of the Mizrachi (Religious Zionism) movement; granddaughter of the Netziv; and niece of Rabbi Baruch Epstein. Judith Lieberman studied at Hunter College and then at Columbia University under Professor Moses Hadas and Professor Muzzey. From 1941, she served as Hebrew principal and then as dean of Hebrew studies of Orthodox Shulamith School for Girls in New York, the first Jewish day school for girls in North America. Among her publications were &quot;Robert Browning and Hebraism&quot; (1934), and an autobiographical chapter which was included in &quot;Thirteen Americans, Their Spiritual Autobiographies&quot; (1953), edited by Louis Finkelstein.

The Liebermans had no children.

<doc id="179714" wikidata="Q384596" url="?curid=179714" title="Mobile workstation">
<text>A mobile workstation, also known as a desktop replacement computer (DTR) or workstation laptop, is a personal computer that provides the full capabilities of a workstation-class desktop computer while remaining mobile. They are often larger, bulkier laptops or in some cases 2-in-1 PCs with a tablet-like form factor and interface. Because of their increased size, this class of computer usually includes more powerful components and a larger display than generally used in smaller portable computers and can have a relatively limited battery capacity (or none at all). Some use a limited range of desktop components (DToM) to provide better performance at the expense of battery life. These are sometimes called desknotes, a blend of &quot;desktop&quot; and &quot;notebook&quot;, though the term is also applied to desktop replacement computers in general. Other names being monster notebooks or musclebooks in reference to muscle cars.

==Origins==
The forerunners of the mobile workstation were the portable computers of the early to mid-1980s, such as the Portal R2E CCMC, the Osborne 1, Kaypro II, the Compaq Portable and the Commodore Executive 64 (SX-64) computers. These computers contained the CPU, display, floppy disk drive and power supply all in a single briefcase-like enclosure. Similar in performance to the desktop computers of the era, they were easily transported and came with an attached keyboard that doubled as a protective cover when not in use. They could be used wherever space and an electrical outlet were available, as they had no battery.

The development of the laptop form factor gave new impetus to portable computer development. Many early laptops were feature-limited in the interest of portability, requiring such mobility-limiting accessories as external floppy drives or clip-on trackball pointing devices. One of the first laptops that could be used as a standalone computer was the EUROCOM 2100 based on Intel&#x27;s 8088 CPU architecture, it duplicated the functionality of the desktop models without requiring an external docking station.

The development of the modern mobile workstation came with the realization that many laptops were used in a semi-permanent location, often remaining connected to an external power source at all times. This suggested that a market existed for a laptop-style computer that would take advantage of the user&#x27;s reduced need for portability, allowing for higher-performance components, greater expandability, and higher-quality displays. Mobile workstations are also often used with a port replicator, to full enjoy the desktop comfort.

==Design features==
Modern mobile workstations generally perform better than traditional laptop-style computers as their size allows the inclusion of more powerful components. The larger body means more efficient heat-dissipation, allowing manufacturers to use components that would otherwise overheat during normal use. Furthermore, their increased size allows for more modularity, which allows for a greater expandability and features, as well as larger and brighter displays. However, these advantages generally come at a price premium, with many computers in this class costing as much as two desktop computers with similar specifications.

Using a laptop form factor, however, mobile workstations still often suffer from limitations similar to those of more mobile laptops. They usually lack the ability to accept standard PCIe expansion cards, somewhat limiting their expandability. While mobile workstations can offer better cooling than other laptops, they rarely dissipate heat efficiently enough to allow for high-end desktop-class components, and thus may not reach the same performance levels as desktop computers. 

Mobile workstations computers are, with a few exceptions, difficult to upgrade compared to desktop computers, with many of their major components (such as the display) integral to the design of the machine, and others (such as the CPU and GPU) often being hard to access and replace.
A small segment of mobile workstations do not include a battery as a standard feature, while some do not include ExpressCard support. They have the same limitations on serviceability as laptops, and can rarely use identical components to a desktop computer.

<doc id="179716" wikidata="Q615925" url="?curid=179716" title="Uppsala General Catalogue">
<text>The [[Uppsala]] General Catalogue of Galaxies (UGC) is a catalogue of 12,921 galaxies visible from the northern hemisphere. It was first published in 1973.

The catalogue includes essentially all galaxies north of declination −02°30′ and to a limiting diameter of 1.0 arcminute or to a limiting apparent magnitude of 14.5. The primary source of data is the blue prints of the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS). It also includes galaxies smaller than 1.0 arcminute in diameter but brighter than 14.5 magnitude from the Catalogue of Galaxies and of Clusters of Galaxies (CGCG).

The catalogue contains descriptions of the galaxies and their surrounding areas, plus conventional system classifications and position angles for flattened galaxies. Galaxy diameters are included and the classifications and descriptions are given in such a way as to provide as accurate an account as possible of the appearance of the galaxies on the prints. The accuracy of coordinates is only what is necessary for identifications purposes. The catalogue was edited by Peter Nilson, at the time Doctor of Astronomy and a researcher at Uppsala, who had already published some essays about the history of his science; a couple of years later he left his career as a professional astronomer behind and became a full-time writer, novelist and essayist, although the relationship of humans to space and cosmology, and the history of science, remained powerful themes in his later writing.

==Addendum==
There is an addendum to the catalogue called Uppsala General Catalogue Addendum, which is abbreviated as UGCA.

<doc id="179727" wikidata="Q287665" url="?curid=179727" title="Isabella Beeton">
<text>Isabella Mary Beeton ( Mayson; 14 March 1836 – 6 February 1865), known as Mrs Beeton, was an English journalist, editor and writer. Her name is particularly associated with her first book, the 1861 work &quot;Mrs Beeton&#x27;s Book of Household Management&quot;. She was born in London and, after schooling in Islington, north London, and Heidelberg, Germany, she married Samuel Orchart Beeton, an ambitious publisher and magazine editor.

In 1857, less than a year after the wedding, Beeton began writing for one of her husband&#x27;s publications, &quot;The Englishwoman&#x27;s Domestic Magazine&quot;. She translated French fiction and wrote the cookery column, though all the recipes were plagiarised from other works or sent in by the magazine&#x27;s readers. In 1859 the Beetons launched a series of 48-page monthly supplements to &quot;The Englishwoman&#x27;s Domestic Magazine&quot;; the 24 instalments were published in one volume as &quot;Mrs Beeton&#x27;s Book of Household Management&quot; in October 1861, which sold 60,000 copies in the first year. Beeton was working on an abridged version of her book, which was to be titled &quot;The Dictionary of Every-Day Cookery&quot;, when she died of puerperal fever in February 1865 at the age of 28. She gave birth to four children, two of whom died in infancy, and had several miscarriages. Two of her biographers, Nancy Spain and Kathryn Hughes, posit the theory that Samuel had unknowingly contracted syphilis in a premarital liaison with a prostitute, and had unwittingly passed the disease on to his wife.

The &quot;Book of Household Management&quot; has been edited, revised and enlarged several times since Beeton&#x27;s death and is still in print as at 2016. Food writers have stated that the subsequent editions of the work were far removed from and inferior to the original version. Several cookery writers, including Elizabeth David and Clarissa Dickson Wright, have criticised Beeton&#x27;s work, particularly her use of other people&#x27;s recipes. Others, such as the food writer Bee Wilson, consider the censure overstated, and that Beeton and her work should be thought extraordinary and admirable. Her name has become associated with knowledge and authority on Victorian cooking and home management, and the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; states that by 1891 the term &quot;Mrs Beeton&quot; had become used as a generic name for a domestic authority. She is also considered a strong influence in the building or shaping of a middle-class identity of the Victorian era.

==Biography==
===Early life, 1836–1854===

Isabella Mayson was born on 14 March 1836 in Marylebone, London. She was the eldest of three daughters to Benjamin Mayson, a linen factor (merchant) and his wife Elizabeth (&quot;&quot; Jerrom). Shortly after Isabella&#x27;s birth the family moved to Milk Street, Cheapside, from where Benjamin traded. He died when Isabella was four years old, and Elizabeth, pregnant and unable to cope with raising the children on her own while maintaining Benjamin&#x27;s business, sent her two elder daughters to live with relatives. Isabella went to live with her recently widowed paternal grandfather in Great Orton, Cumberland, though she was back with her mother within the next two years.
Three years after Benjamin&#x27;s death Elizabeth married Henry Dorling, a widower with four children. Henry was the Clerk of Epsom Racecourse, and had been granted residence within the racecourse grounds. The family, including Elizabeth&#x27;s mother, moved to Surrey and over the next twenty years Henry and Elizabeth had a further thirteen children. Isabella was instrumental in her siblings&#x27; upbringing, and collectively referred to them as a &quot;living cargo of children&quot;. The experience gave her much insight and experience in how to manage a family and its household.

After a brief education at a boarding school in Islington, in 1851 Isabella was sent to school in Heidelberg, Germany, accompanied by her stepsister Jane Dorling. Isabella became proficient in the piano and excelled in French and German; she also gained knowledge and experience in making pastry. She had returned to Epsom by the summer of 1854 and took further lessons in pastry-making from a local baker.

===Marriage and career, 1854–1861===
Around 1854 Isabella Mayson began a relationship with Samuel Orchart Beeton. His family had lived in Milk Street at the same time as the Maysons—Samuel&#x27;s father still ran the Dolphin Tavern there—and Samuel&#x27;s sisters had also attended the same Heidelberg school as Isabella. Samuel was the first British publisher of Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; in 1852 and had also released two innovative and pioneering journals: &quot;The Englishwoman&#x27;s Domestic Magazine&quot; in 1852 and the &quot;Boys&#x27; Own&quot; magazine in 1855. The couple entered into extensive correspondence in 1855—in which Isabella signed her letters as &quot;Fatty&quot;—and they announced their engagement in June 1855. The marriage took place at St Martin&#x27;s Church, Epsom, in July the following year, and was announced in &quot;The Times&quot;. Samuel was &quot;a discreet but firm believer in the equality of women&quot; and their relationship, both personal and professional, was an equal partnership. The couple went to Paris for a three-week honeymoon, after which Samuel&#x27;s mother joined them in a visit to Heidelberg. They returned to Britain in August, when the newlyweds moved into 2 Chandos Villas, a large Italianate house in Pinner.
Within a month of returning from their honeymoon Beeton was pregnant. A few weeks before the birth, Samuel persuaded his wife to contribute to &quot;The Englishwoman&#x27;s Domestic Magazine&quot;, a publication that the food writers Mary Aylett and Olive Ordish consider was &quot;designed to make women content with their lot inside the home, not to interest them in the world outside&quot;. The magazine was affordable, aimed at young middle class women and was commercially successful, selling 50,000 issues a month by 1856. Beeton began by translating French fiction for publication as stories or serials. Shortly afterwards she started to work on the cookery column—which had been moribund for the previous six months following the departure of the previous correspondent—and the household article. The Beetons&#x27; son, Samuel Orchart, was born towards the end of May 1857, but died at the end of August that year. On the death certificate, the cause of death was given as diarrhoea and cholera, although Hughes hypothesises that Samuel senior had unknowingly contracted syphilis in a premarital liaison with a prostitute, and had unwittingly passed the condition on to his wife, which would have infected his son.

While coping with the loss of her child, Beeton continued to work at &quot;The Englishwoman&#x27;s Domestic Magazine&quot;. Although she was not a regular cook, she and Samuel obtained recipes from other sources. A request to receive the readers&#x27; own recipes led to over 2,000 being sent in, which were selected and edited by the Beetons. Published works were also copied, largely unattributed to any of the sources. These included Eliza Acton&#x27;s &quot;Modern Cookery for Private Families&quot;, Elizabeth Raffald&#x27;s &quot;The Experienced English Housekeeper&quot;, Marie-Antoine Carême&#x27;s &quot;Le Pâtissier royal parisien&quot;, Louis Eustache Ude&#x27;s &quot;The French Cook&quot;, Alexis Soyer&#x27;s &quot;The Modern Housewife or, Ménagère&quot; and &quot;The Pantropheon&quot;, Hannah Glasse&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy&quot;, Maria Rundell&#x27;s &quot;A New System of Domestic Cookery&quot;, and the works of Charles Elmé Francatelli. Suzanne Daly and Ross G. Forman, in their examination of Victorian cooking culture, consider that the plagiarism makes it &quot;an important index of mid-Victorian and middle-class society&quot; because the production of the text from its own readers ensures that it is a reflection of what was actually being cooked and eaten at the time. In reproducing the recipes of others, Beeton was following the recommendation given to her by Henrietta English, a family friend, who wrote that &quot;Cookery is a Science that is only learnt by Long Experience and years of study which of course you have not had. Therefore my advice would be compile a book from receipts from a Variety of the Best Books published on Cookery and Heaven knows there is a great variety for you to choose from.&quot;
The Beetons partly followed the layout of Acton&#x27;s recipes, although with a major alteration: whereas the earlier writer provided the method of cooking followed by a list of the required ingredients, the recipes in &quot;The Englishwoman&#x27;s Domestic Magazine&quot; listed the components before the cooking process. Beeton &#x27;s standardised layout used for the recipes also showed the approximate costs of each serving, the seasonality of the ingredients and the number of portions per dish. According to the twentieth-century British cookery writer Elizabeth David, one of the strengths of Beeton&#x27;s writing was in the &quot;clarity and details of her general instructions, her brisk comments, her no-nonsense asides&quot;. Margaret Beetham, the historian, sees that one of the strengths of the book was the &quot;consistent principle of organisation which made its heterogeneous contents look uniform and orderly&quot;, and brought a consistent style in presentation and layout. Whereas Daly and Forman consider such an approach as &quot;nothing if not formulaic&quot;, Hughes sees it as &quot;the thing most beloved by the mid Victorians, &quot;a system&quot;&quot;.

During the particularly bitter winter of 1858–59 Beeton prepared her own soup that she served to the poor of Pinner, &quot;Soup for benevolent purposes&quot;; her sister later recalled that Beeton &quot;was busy making [the] soup for the poor, and the children used to call with their cans regularly to be refilled&quot;. The recipe would become the only entry in her &quot;Book of Household Management&quot; that was her own. After two years of miscarriages, the couple&#x27;s second son was born in June 1859; he was also named Samuel Orchart Beeton. Hughes sees the miscarriages as further evidence of Samuel&#x27;s syphilis.

As early as 1857 the Beetons had considered using the magazine columns as the basis of a book of collected recipes and homecare advice, Hughes believes, and in November 1859 they launched a series of 48-page monthly supplements with &quot;The Englishwoman&#x27;s Domestic Magazine&quot;. The print block for the whole series of the supplements was set from the beginning so the break between each edition was fixed at 48 pages, regardless of the text, and in several issues the text of a sentence or recipe is split between the end of one instalment and the beginning of the next.

The Beetons decided to revamp &quot;The Englishwoman&#x27;s Domestic Magazine&quot;, particularly the fashion column, which the historian Graham Nown describes as &quot;a rather drab piece&quot;. They travelled to Paris in March 1860 to meet Adolphe Goubaud, the publisher of the French magazine &quot;Le Moniteur de la Mode&quot;. The magazine carried a full-sized dress pattern outlined on a fold-out piece of paper for users to cut out and make their own dresses. The Beetons came to an agreement with Goubaud for the Frenchman to provide patterns and illustrations for their magazine. The first edition to carry the new feature appeared on 1 May, six weeks after the couple returned from Paris. For the redesigned magazine, Samuel was joined as editor by Isabella, who was described as &quot;Editress&quot;. As well as being co-editors, the couple were also equal partners. Isabella brought an efficiency and strong business acumen to Samuel&#x27;s normally disorganised and financially wasteful approach. She joined her husband at work, travelling daily by train to the office, where her presence caused a stir among commuters, most of whom were male. In June 1860 the Beetons travelled to Killarney, Ireland, for a fortnight&#x27;s holiday, leaving their son at home with his nurse. They enjoyed the sightseeing, although on the days it rained, they stayed inside their hotel and worked on the next edition of &quot;The Englishwoman&#x27;s Domestic Magazine&quot;. Beeton was impressed with the food they were served, and wrote in her diary that the dinners were &quot;conducted in quite the French style&quot;.

In September 1861 the Beetons released a new, weekly publication called &quot;The Queen, the Ladies&#x27; Newspaper&quot;. With the Beetons busy running their other titles, they employed Frederick Greenwood as the editor.

===&quot;Mrs Beeton&#x27;s Book of Household Management&quot; and later, 1861–1865===

The complete version of &quot;Mrs Beeton&#x27;s Book of Household Management&quot;, consisting of the 24 collected monthly instalments, was published on 1 October 1861; it became one of the major publishing events of the nineteenth century. Beeton included an extensive 26-page &quot;Analytical Index&quot; in the book. Although not an innovation—it had been used in &quot;The Family Friend&quot; magazine since 1855—Hughes considers the index in the &quot;Book of Household Management&quot; to be &quot;fabulously detailed and exhaustively cross-referenced&quot;. Of the 1,112 pages, over 900 contained recipes. The remainder provided advice on fashion, child care, animal husbandry, poisons, the management of servants, science, religion, first aid and the importance in the use of local and seasonal produce. In its first year of publication, the book sold 60,000 copies. It reflected Victorian values, particularly hard work, thrift and cleanliness. Christopher Clausen, in his study of the British middle classes, sees that Beeton &quot;reflected better than anyone else, and for a larger audience, the optimistic message that mid-Victorian England was filled with opportunities for those who were willing to learn how to take advantage of them&quot;. The food writer Annette Hope thinks that &quot;one can understand its success. If ... young ladies knew nothing of domestic arrangements, no better book than this could have been devised for them.&quot;
The reviews for &quot;Book of Household Management&quot; were positive. The critic for the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot; considered that Beeton had earned herself a household reputation, remarking that she had &quot;succeeded in producing a volume which will be, for years to come, a treasure to be made much of in every English household&quot;. The critic for the &quot;Saturday Review&quot; wrote that &quot;for a really valuable repertory of hints on all sorts of household matters, we recommend Mrs Beeton with few misgivings&quot;. The anonymous reviewer for &quot;The Bradford Observer&quot; considered that &quot;the information afforded ... appears intelligible and explicit&quot;; the reviewer also praised the layout of the recipes, highlighting details relating to ingredients, seasonality and the times needed. Writing in &quot;The Morning Chronicle&quot;, an anonymous commentator opined that &quot;Mrs Beeton has omitted nothing which tends to the comfort of housekeepers, or facilitates the many little troubles and cares that fall to the lot of every wife and mother. She may safely predict that this book will in future take precedence of every other on the same subject.&quot; For the 1906 edition of the book, &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot;″s reviewer considered the work &quot;a formidable body of domestic doctrine&quot;, and thought that &quot;the book is almost of the first magnitude&quot;.

Samuel&#x27;s business decisions from 1861 were unproductive and included an ill-advised investment in purchasing paper—in which he lost £1,000—and a court case over unpaid bills. His hubris in business affairs brought on financial difficulties and in early 1862 the couple had moved from their comfortable Pinner house to premises over their office. The air of central London was not conducive to the health of the Beetons&#x27; son, and he began to ail. Three days after Christmas his health worsened and he died on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1862 at the age of three; his death certificate gave the cause as &quot;suppressed scarlatina&quot; and &quot;laryngitis&quot;. In March 1863 Beeton found that she was pregnant again, and in April the couple moved to a house in Greenhithe, Kent; their son, who they named Orchart, was born on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1863. Although the couple had been through financial problems, they enjoyed relative prosperity during 1863, boosted by the sale of &quot;The Queen&quot; to Edward Cox in the middle of the year.

In the middle of 1864 the Beetons again visited the Goubauds in Paris—the couple&#x27;s third visit to the city—and Beeton was pregnant during the visit, just as she had been the previous year. On her return to Britain she began working on an abridged version of the &quot;Book of Household Management &quot;, which was to be titled &quot;The Dictionary of Every-Day Cookery&quot;. On 29 January 1865, while working on the proofs of the dictionary, she went into labour; the baby—Mayson Moss—was born that day. Beeton began to feel feverish the following day and died of puerperal fever on 6 February at the age of 28.
Beeton was buried at West Norwood Cemetery on 11 February. When &quot;The Dictionary of Every-Day Cookery&quot; was published in the same year, Samuel added a tribute to his wife at the end:

==Legacy==
In May 1866, following a severe downturn in his financial fortunes, Samuel sold the rights to the &quot;Book of Household Management &quot; to Ward, Lock and Tyler (later Ward Lock &amp; Co). The writer Nancy Spain, in her biography of Isabella, reports that, given the money the company made from the Beetons&#x27; work, &quot;surely no man ever made a worse or more impractical bargain&quot; than Samuel did. In subsequent publications Ward Lock suppressed the details of the lives of the Beetons—especially the death of Isabella—in order to protect their investment by letting readers think she was still alive and creating recipes—what Hughes considers to be &quot;intentional censorship&quot;. Those later editions continued to make the connection to Beeton in what Beetham considers to be a &quot;fairly ruthless marketing policy which was begun by Beeton but carried on vigorously by Ward, Lock, and Tyler&quot;. Those subsequent volumes bearing Beeton&#x27;s name became less reflective of the original. Since its initial publication the &quot;Book of Household Management &quot; has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages and has never been out of print.
Beeton and her main work have been subjected to criticism over the course of the twentieth century. Elizabeth David complains of recipes that are &quot;sometimes slapdash and misleading&quot;, although she acknowledges that Prosper Montagné&#x27;s &quot;Larousse Gastronomique&quot; also contains errors. The television cook Delia Smith admits she was puzzled &quot;how on earth Mrs Beeton&#x27;s book managed to utterly eclipse ... [Acton&#x27;s] superior work&quot;, while her fellow chef, Clarissa Dickson Wright, opines that &quot;It would be unfair to blame any one person or one book for the decline of English cookery, but Isabella Beeton and her ubiquitous book do have a lot to answer for.&quot; In comparison, the food writer Bee Wilson opines that disparaging Beeton&#x27;s work was only a &quot;fashionable&quot; stance to take and that the cook&#x27;s writing &quot;simply makes you want to cook&quot;. Christopher Driver, the journalist and food critic, suggests that the &quot;relative stagnation and want of refinement in the indigenous cooking of Britain between 1880 and 1930&quot; may instead be explained by the &quot;progressive debasement under successive editors, revises and enlargers&quot;. David comments that &quot;when plain English cooks&quot; were active in their kitchens, &quot;they followed plain English recipes and chiefly those from the Mrs Beeton books or their derivatives&quot;. Dickson Wright considers Beeton to be a &quot;fascinating source of information&quot; from a social history viewpoint, and Aylett and Ordish consider the work to be &quot;the best and most reliable guide for the scholar to the domestic history of the mid-Victorian era&quot;.

Despite the criticism, Clausen observes that &quot;&#x27;Mrs. Beeton&#x27; has ... been for over a century the standard English cookbook, frequently outselling every other book but the Bible&quot;. According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the term &quot;Mrs Beeton&quot; became used as a generic name for &quot;an authority on cooking and domestic subjects&quot; as early as 1891, and Beetham opines that &quot;&#x27;Mrs. Beeton&#x27; became a trade mark, a brand name&quot;. In a review by Gavin Koh published in a 2009 issue of &quot;The BMJ&quot;, &quot;Mrs Beeton&#x27;s Book of Household Management&quot; was labelled a medical classic. In Beeton&#x27;s &quot;attempt to educate the average reader about common medical complaints and their management&quot;, Koh argues, &quot;she preceded the family health guides of today&quot;. Robin Wensley, a professor of strategic management, believes that Beeton&#x27;s advice and guidance on household management can also be applied to business management, and her lessons on the subject have stood the test of time better than some of her advice on cooking or etiquette.

Following the radio broadcast of &quot;Meet Mrs. Beeton&quot;, a 1934 comedy in which Samuel was portrayed in an unflattering light, and &quot;Mrs Beeton&quot;, a 1937 documentary, Mayston Beeton worked with H. Montgomery Hyde to produce the biography &quot;Mr and Mrs Beeton&quot;, although completion and publication were delayed until 1951. In the meantime Nancy Spain published &quot;Mrs Beeton and her Husband&quot; in 1948, updated and retitled in 1956 to &quot;The Beeton Story&quot;. In the new edition Spain hinted at, but did not elucidate upon, on the possibility that Samuel contracted syphilis. Several other biographies followed, including from the historian Sarah Freeman, who wrote &quot;Isabella and Sam&quot; in 1977; Nown&#x27;s &quot;Mrs Beeton: 150 Years of Cookery and Household Management&quot;, published on the 150th anniversary of Beeton&#x27;s birthday, and Hughes&#x27;s &quot;The Short Life and Long Times of Mrs Beeton&quot;, published in 2006. Beeton was ignored by the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; for many years: while Acton was included in the first published volume of 1885, Beeton did not have an entry until 1993.

There have been several television broadcasts about Beeton. In 1970 Margaret Tyzack portrayed her in a solo performance written by Rosemary Hill, in 2006 Anna Madeley played Beeton in a docudrama, and Sophie Dahl presented a documentary, &quot;The Marvellous Mrs Beeton&quot;, in the same year.

The literary historian Kate Thomas sees Beeton as &quot;a powerful force in the making of middle-class Victorian domesticity&quot;, while the Oxford University Press, advertising an abridged edition of the &quot;Book of Household Management&quot;, considers Beeton&#x27;s work a &quot;founding text&quot; and &quot;a force in shaping&quot; the middle-class identity of the Victorian era. Within that identity, the historian Sarah Richardson sees that one of Beeton&#x27;s achievements was the integration of different threads of domestic science into one volume, which &quot;elevat[ed] the middle-class female housekeeper&#x27;s role ... placing it in a broader and more public context&quot;. Nown quotes an unnamed academic who thought that &quot;Mrs Beetonism has preserved the family as a social unit, and made social reforms a possibility&quot;, while Nicola Humble, in her history of British food, sees &quot;The Book of Household Management &quot; as &quot;an engine for social change&quot; which led to a &quot;new cult of domesticity that was to play such a major role in mid-Victorian life&quot;. Nown considers Beeton

<doc id="179735" wikidata="Q486371" url="?curid=179735" title="Anarcho-pacifism">
<text>Anarcho-pacifism, also referred to as anarchist pacifism and pacifist anarchism, is an anarchist school of thought that advocates for the use of peaceful, non-violent forms of resistance in the struggle for social change. Anarcho-pacifism rejects the principle of violence which is seen as a form of power and therefore as contradictory to key anarchist ideals such as the rejection of hierarchy and dominance. Many anarcho-pacifists are also Christian anarchists, who reject war and the use of violence.

Anarcho-pacifists do not reject the use of non-violent revolutionary action against capitalism and the state with the purpose of establishing a peaceful voluntarist society. The main early influences were the philosophies of Henry David Thoreau and Leo Tolstoy while later the ideas of Mahatma Gandhi gained significance. Anarcho-pacifist movements primarily emerged in the Netherlands, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States before and during World War II.

== History ==

Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862) was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the United States and Europe. Thoreau&#x27;s essay &quot;Civil Disobedience&quot; (&quot;Resistance to Civil Government&quot;) was named as an influence by Leo Tolstoy, Martin Buber, Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. due to its advocacy of nonviolent resistance. According to the Peace Pledge Union of Britain, it was also the main precedent for anarcho-pacifism. Thoreau himself did not subscribe to pacifism, and did not reject the use of armed revolt. He demonstrated this with his unqualified support for John Brown and other violent abolitionists, writing of Brown that &quot;The question is not about the weapon, but the spirit in which you use it.&quot;

In the 1840s, the American abolitionist and advocate of nonresistance Henry Clarke Wright and his English follower Joseph Barker rejected the idea of governments and advocated a form of pacifist individualist anarchism. At some point anarcho-pacifism had as its main proponent Christian anarchism. The Tolstoyan movement in Russia was the first large-scale anarcho-pacifist movement.
Violence has always been controversial in anarchism. While many anarchists embraced violent propaganda of the deed during the nineteenth century, anarcho-pacifists directly opposed violence as a means for change. Tolstoy argued that anarchism must be nonviolent since it is, by definition, opposition to coercion and force, and that since the state is inherently violent, meaningful pacifism must likewise be anarchistic. Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis was also instrumental in establishing the pacifist trend within the anarchist movement. In France anti-militarism appeared strongly in individualist anarchist circles, as Émile Armand co-founded &quot;Ligue Antimilitariste&quot; in December 1902 with fellow anarchists Georges Yvetot, Henri Beylie, Paraf-Javal, Albert Libertad and Émile Janvion. The &quot;Ligue antimilitariste&quot; was to become the French section of the &quot;Association internationale antimilitariste&quot; (AIA) founded in Amsterdam in 1904.

Tolstoy&#x27;s philosophy was cited as a major inspiration by Mohandas Gandhi, an Indian independence leader and pacifist who self-identified as an anarchist. &quot;Gandhi&#x27;s ideas were popularised in the West in books such as Richard Gregg&#x27;s &quot;The Power of Nonviolence&quot; (1935), and Bart de Ligt&#x27;s &quot;The Conquest of Violence&quot; (1937). The latter is particularly important for anarchists since, as one himself, de Ligt specifically addressed those who lust for revolution. &#x27;The more violence, the less revolution,&#x27; he declared. He also linked Gandhian principled nonviolence with the pragmatic nonviolent direct action of the syndicalists. (The General Strike is an expression of total noncooperation by workers, though it should be added that most syndicalists believed that the revolution should be defended by armed workers.)&quot; &quot;The Conquest of Violence&quot; alludes to Kropotkin&#x27;s &quot;The Conquest of Bread&quot;.
As a global movement, anarchist pacifism emerged shortly before World War II in the Netherlands, United Kingdom and United States and was a strong presence in the subsequent campaigns for nuclear disarmament. The American writer Dwight Macdonald endorsed anarcho-pacifist views in the 1940s and used his journal &quot;politics&quot; to promote these ideas. For Andrew Cornell &quot;Many young anarchists of this period departed from previous generations both by embracing pacifism and by devoting more energy to promoting avant-garde culture, preparing the ground for the Beat Generation in the process. The editors of the anarchist journal &quot;Retort&quot;, for instance, produced a volume of writings by WWII draft resistors imprisoned at Danbury, Connecticut, while regularly publishing the poetry and prose of writers such as Kenneth Rexroth and Norman Mailer. From the 1940s to the 1960s, then, the radical pacifist movement in the United States harbored both social democrats and anarchists, at a time when the anarchist movement itself seemed on its last legs.&quot; A leading British anarcho-pacifist was Alex Comfort who considered himself &quot;an aggressive anti-militarist,&quot; and he believed that pacifism rested &quot;solely upon the historical theory of anarchism.&quot; He was an active member of CND.

Among the works on anarchism by Comfort is &quot;Peace and Disobedience&quot; (1946), one of many pamphlets he wrote for &quot;Peace News&quot; and the Peace Pledge Union, and &quot;Authority and Delinquency in the Modern State&quot; (1950). He exchanged public correspondence with George Orwell defending pacifism in the open letter/poem &quot;Letter to an American Visitor&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;Obadiah Hornbrooke.&quot;

In the 1950s and 1960s, anarcho-pacifism &quot;began to gel, tough-minded anarchists adding to the mixture their critique of the state, and tender-minded pacifists their critique of violence&quot;. Within the context of the emergence of the New Left and the Civil Rights Movement, &quot;several themes, theories, actions, all distinctly libertarian, began to come to the fore and were given intellectual expression by the American anarcho-pacifist, Paul Goodman.&quot;
Other notable anarcho-pacifist historical figures include Ammon Hennacy, Dorothy Day and Jean-Paul Sartre, albeit the latter only for a brief period between 1939 and 1940 . Dorothy Day, (8 November 1897 – 29 November 1980) was an American journalist, social activist and devout Catholic convert; she advocated the Catholic economic theory of distributism. She was also considered to be an anarchist, and did not hesitate to use the term. In the 1930s, Day worked closely with fellow activist Peter Maurin to establish the Catholic Worker movement, a nonviolent, pacifist movement that continues to combine direct aid for the poor and homeless with nonviolent direct action on their behalf. The cause for Day&#x27;s canonization is open in the Catholic Church. Ammon Hennacy (24 July 1893 – 14 January 1970) was an American pacifist, Christian anarchist, vegetarian, social activist, member of the Catholic Worker Movement and a Wobbly. He established the &quot;Joe Hill House of Hospitality&quot; in Salt Lake City, Utah and practiced tax resistance. Charles-Auguste Bontemps was a prolific author mainly in the anarchist, freethinking, pacifist and naturist press of the time. His view on anarchism was based around his concept of &quot;Social Individualism&quot; on which he wrote extensively. He defended an anarchist perspective which consisted on &quot;a collectivism of things and an individualism of persons.&quot; Gérard de Lacaze-Duthiers was a French writer, art critic, pacifist and anarchist. Lacaze-Duthiers, an art critic for the Symbolist review journal &quot;La Plume&quot;, was influenced by Oscar Wilde, Nietzsche and Max Stirner. His (1906) &quot;L&#x27;Ideal Humain de l&#x27;Art&quot; helped found the &#x27;Artistocracy&#x27; movement – a movement advocating life in the service of art. His ideal was an anti-elitist aestheticism: &quot;All men should be artists&quot;. Jean-René Saulière (also René Saulière) (Bordeaux, 6 September 1911 – 2 January 1999) was a French anarcho-pacifist, individualist anarchist and freethought writer and militant who went under the pseudonym André Arru. During the late 1950s he establishes inside the Fédération des Libres Penseurs des Bouches du Rhône, the Group Francisco Ferrer and in 1959 he joins the Union des Pacifistes de France (Union of Pacifists of France). From 1968 to 1982, Arru alongside the members of the Group Francisco Ferrer publishes &quot;La Libre Pensée des Bouches du Rhône&quot;.
&quot;Movement for a New Society (MNS), a national network of feminist radical pacifist collectives that existed from 1971 to 1988&quot;, is sometimes identified as anarchist, although they did not identify themselves as such. For Andrew Cornell &quot;MNS popularized consensus decision-making, introduced the spokescouncil method of organization to activists in the United States, and was a leading advocate of a variety of practices – communal living, unlearning oppressive behavior, creating co-operatively owned businesses – that are now often subsumed under the rubric of &quot;prefigurative politics.&quot; MNS leader George Lakey stated that &quot;anarchists claim me but I&#x27;m always a little surprised when they do because I&#x27;m fond of social democracy as it&#x27;s been developed in Norway.&quot; Lakey has supported electoral politics, including the re-election of Barack Obama as U.S. president.

== Thought ==
According to the authors of &quot;An Anarchist FAQ&quot;, &quot;the attraction of pacifism to anarchists is clear. Violence is authoritarian and coercive, and so its use does contradict anarchist principles... (Errico) Malatesta is even more explicit when he wrote that the &quot;main plank of anarchism is the removal of violence from human relations&quot;.
Anarcho-pacifists tend to see the state as &#x27;organised violence&#x27; and so they see that &quot;it would therefore seem logical that anarchists should reject all violence&quot;. Anarcho-pacifism criticizes the separation between means and ends. &quot;Means... must not merely be consistent with ends; this principle, though preferable to &#x27;the end justifies the means&#x27;, is based on a misleading dichotomy. Means are ends, never merely instrumental but also always expressive of values; means are end-creating or ends-in-the making&quot;.

An anarcho-pacifist critique of capitalism was provided by Bart de Ligt in his &quot;The Conquest of Violence&quot;. A report in &quot;An Anarchist FAQ&quot; describes how &quot;all anarchists would agree with de Ligt on, to use the name of one of his book&#x27;s chapters, &quot;the absurdity of bourgeois pacifism.&quot; For de Ligt, and all anarchists, violence is inherent in the capitalist system and any attempt to make capitalism pacifistic is doomed to failure. This is because, on the one hand, war is often just economic competition carried out by other means. Nations often go to war when they face an economic crisis, what they cannot gain in economic struggle they attempt to get by conflict. On the other hand, &quot;violence is indispensable in modern society... [because] without it the ruling class would be completely unable to maintain its privileged position with regard to the exploited masses in each country. The army is used first and foremost to hold down the workers... when they become discontented.&quot; [Bart de Ligt, Op. Cit., p. 62] As long as the state and capitalism exist, violence is inevitable and so, for anarcho-pacifists, the consistent pacifist must be an anarchist just as the consistent anarchist must be a pacifist&quot;.

A main component of anarcho-pacifist strategy is civil disobedience as advocated by the early anarchist thinker Henry David Thoreau in the essay of the same name from 1849 (although Thoreau strongly supported the gun rights and self-defense). Leo Tolstoy was influenced by it and he saw that a &quot;great weapon for undermining (rather than overthrowing) the state was the refusal by individuals to cooperate with it and obey its immoral demands&quot;. Also the concepts of passive and active resistance have relevance as they were developed later by Mohandas Gandhi.

For anarchist historian George Woodcock &quot;the modern pacifist anarchists...have tended to concentrate their attention largely on the creation of libertarian communities – particularly farming communities – within present society, as a kind of peaceful version of the propaganda by deed. They divide, however, over the question of action.&quot;. Anarcho-pacifists can even accept &quot;the principle of resistance and even revolutionary action (nonviolent revolution), provided it does not incur violence, which they see as a form of power and therefore nonanarchist in nature. This change in attitude has led the pacifist anarchists to veer toward the anarcho-syndicalists, since the latter&#x27;s concept of the general strike as the great revolutionary weapon made an appeal to those pacifists who accepted the need for fundamental social change but did not wish to compromise their ideal by the use of negative (i.e., violent) means.&quot;

== Ideological variance ==

Anarcho-pacifism is frequently associated with various forms of religious anarchism such as Tolstoyan Christian anarchism and Buddhist anarchism. Notably, Christian anarchism places emphasis on Jesus Christ&#x27;s blessing of peacemakers and teachings involving non-violent resistance. Concerning the anarchistic characteristics of Christianity, Greek author Alexandre Christoyannopoulos argues that the concept of the state should be rejected by Christians due to its inherent contradiction of the teachings of the religion. Following the definition of the state posited by Max Weber in his 1921 essay Politik als Beruf, Christoyannopoulos contends that the state is founded upon a monopoly over the use of violent force in order to enforce law and order, and is therefore directly at odds with the fundamental teachings of Jesus Christ. Reflecting on the implications of this contradictory relationship, Christoyannopoulos invokes the Tolstoyan notion that the force utilized by the justice system to enforce the outcomes of legal proceedings is also at odds with the teachings of Christianity. Aylmer Maude (the friend, biographer and translator of Leo Tolstoy) states that Christianity involves anarchism as it necessitates the &quot;abolition of all compulsory legislation, law courts, police, and prisons, as well as all forcible restraint of man by man&quot;. Due to Tolstoy&#x27;s religious views combined with his advocacy for the total dismantlement of the state and its apparatus in favour of the establishment of a voluntarist society, he is seen as a prominent instigator of Christian anarchism.

Anarcho-pacifism is often combined with socialist criticism of capitalism regarding economic class. The anarcho-pacifist ideal of a peaceful classless society is claimed to be incompatible with the competitive nature of capitalism which can ultimately lead to violent conflict. Anarcho-pacifists frequently denounce the perceived tendency of the capitalist economic system to perpetuate systematic violence in the forms of exploitation, hierarchies of political and economic power as well as dispossession. However, the socialist criticism of capitalism that often appear within the movement does not imply that anarcho-pacifism is inherently social anarchist in nature. Anarchist schools of thought can be generally distinguished from one another by their perspectives on two key elements, namely revolutionary methods and economic organisation. Anarcho-pacifism differs from social anarchism in rejecting the use of violent revolutionary methods to achieve social change and the abolition of the state.

Irreligious or even anti-religious tendencies have emerged such as the French individualist anarchist anarcho-pacifist tendency exemplified by authors and activists such as Charles-Auguste Bontemps, André Arru and Gérard de Lacaze-Duthiers which aligned itself with atheism and freethought. The anarcho-punk band Crass polemicised a variant of anarcho-pacifism whilst at the same time explicitly rejecting all religions, especially the symbols of establishment Christian theology. Opposition to the use of violence has not prohibited anarcho-pacifists from accepting the principle of resistance or even revolutionary action provided it does not result in violence. It was their approval of such forms of opposition to power that led some anarcho-pacifists to endorse the anarcho-syndicalist concept of the general strike as the great revolutionary weapon.

<doc id="179746" wikidata="Q7696983" url="?curid=179746" title="Television Wales and the West">
<text>Television Wales and the West (TWW) was the British Independent Television (commercial television) contractor for a franchise area that initially served South Wales and West of England (franchise awarded 26 October 1956, started transmissions on 14 January 1958, the eighth franchise to launch) until 1968.

For the first six years, TWW&#x27;s service was provided from a single VHF transmitter serving both south east Wales and the west of England. The later acquisition of Teledu Cymru in 1964 allowing TWW to extend its coverage across most of Wales and to provide separate services for the Welsh and English parts of the resulting &#x27;dual region&#x27; franchise.

After losing their franchise to Harlech in 1967, TWW ended their service early in protest long before Harlech was ready to take over. This caused the Independent Television Authority to organise an emergency transitional service run by Harlech but using TWW&#x27;s staff, leftover programming, and some assets.

==History==

===Launch===
Television Wales and the West opened transmission at 4:45 pm on 14 January 1958 with a live, 15-minute opening ceremony by station chairman Lord Derby, programming director Sir Ifan ab Owen Edwards and Alfred Francis. The master of ceremonies was chief continuity announcer, Bruce Lewis.

At 6:00 pm, &quot;Youth Wants to Know&quot;, a children&#x27;s interview programme produced by Granada Television, became the first programme to be broadcast by TWW. In the programme, Lady Megan Lloyd George and Raymond Gower fielded questions from Welsh school children. Following &quot;Youth Wants to Know&quot;, ITN&#x27;s early evening news at 6:30 pm was read by Huw Thomas from TWW&#x27;s studios at Pontcanna.

The main opening programme came at 7:00 pm with &quot;The Stars Rise in the West&quot;, a filmed special introduced by &quot;It&#x27;s That Man Again&quot; regular Jack Train. The programme, produced in association with ITN, featured appearances from Ralph Richardson, Stanley Baker (later a founder of TWW&#x27;s successors, Harlech Television), Naunton Wayne, Donald Sinden, Tessie O&#x27;Shea, Donald Houston, Petula Clark, Tommy Cooper and Ralph Reader. Harry Secombe also appeared in a short film clip, performing &quot;Nessun Dorma&quot;.

===Takeover of WWN===
Another company, Wales West and North Television (WWN), originally held a separate franchise licence for a much larger but, critically, less densely populated part of Wales, and broadcast under the on-screen name of &quot;Teledu Cymru&quot;. In January 1964, WWN became the only ITV company to fail financially. TWW was required to take over the franchise of its neighbour, which it ran as a separate service under the banner &quot;Teledu Cymru, TWW Network for Wales&quot;. The two franchises were merged into a single Wales and West franchise.

===Franchise loss===
Partly because its regional programming was so well regarded it came as a great shock when TWW lost its franchise in the 1967 franchise review, in favour of the Harlech Consortium, whose bid promised a glittering future of star-filled entertainment and quality documentaries.

No reason was given for the dismissal (as is common practice for franchise changes) but it was believed that TWW&#x27;s decision to keep its corporate headquarters in London and not move them to within the region was a significant factor. A darker explanation proffered at the time was that it was &quot;government revenge&quot; against the broadcaster&#x27;s major shareholder the &quot;News of the World&quot; newspaper, which had printed a series of critical articles about the then Prime Minister Harold Wilson. This does appear unlikely as although the ITA was answerable to Parliament it was a wholly independent body.

Despite there being many months left on the contract, TWW quit its franchise early in protest, selling the last five months to Harlech for £500,000 even though the new company was not yet ready to start broadcasting at the time. Following the intervention of the ITA, a temporary service was set up — Independent Television Service for Wales and the West, broadcasting from the old TWW Pontcanna studios in Cardiff, and staffed by former TWW workers, until Harlech (soon renamed &quot;HTV&quot;) was ready to take over its franchise early, on 20 May 1968.

===Closure===
Much of the station&#x27;s closing night was made up of in-house produced output including &quot;Live Like A Lord&quot; (a music and comedy show with mainstay TWW personality Ivor Emmanuel and Clive Dunn), teenybopper music show &quot;Discs a Go-Go&quot; (with future Radio Caroline/United DJs presenter Tony Prince) and &quot;Sing Me A Fantasy&quot; (a musical film). The feature programme of the night was TWW&#x27;s penultimate production, &quot;All Good Things&quot;, a late night variety special presented by Bernard Braden and featuring amongst others, Tessie O&#x27;Shea, Stan Stennett, Ivor Emmanuel, Manfred Mann, Clifford Evans, Anita Harris and Morecambe &amp; Wise. The programme was preceded by an introduction from company chairman Lord Derby.

Having felt desperately hard-done-by the ITA, and in the fits of a corporate tantrum, the company showed their final display of anger by closing down with &quot;Come To An End&quot;, a reflective epilogue with John Betjeman, who had made several films for the station, paying tribute to the personnel, programmes and achievements of TWW (which Betjeman affectionately referred to as &quot;Tellywelly&quot;).

Ironically recorded at the Granville Theatre in London, Betjeman closed the epilogue and the station with these words:

&quot;The new firm, Harlech, which will be centred in Cardiff, must build up its own personality. Tellywelly, you had a warm, friendly and inspiring one. Like many others, I&#x27;m very grateful to you. I&#x27;m sorry to see you go. It&#x27;s like the death of an old friend.&quot;

As Betjeman walked out of the theatre and the credits rolled, the camera tilted up to the &quot;EXIT&quot; sign on the wall, and TWW ended its transmission for the last time. An interim service, Independent Television Service for Wales and the West, managed by TWW on behalf of the incoming Harlech Television, replaced it.

==Studios==
TWW operated from two sites – a converted farm at Pontcanna, near Cardiff (now demolished and replaced by a housing estate) and similar facilities at Bath Road in Bristol.

Although TWW inherited Teledu Cymru&#x27;s studios in Western Avenue, Cardiff it was decided to sell these and base both operations at Pontcanna. To accommodate this dual presentation and general increase in production the takeover created, £2 million was spent on updating and extending the studios at Pontcanna, including a new studio and separate transmission control suites.

TWW was also a player in the development of 625-line colour transmission for the ITV network. Although the bulk of test transmissions and research were conducted for the Independent Television Authority (ITA) at the ABC studios at Teddington, TWW leased two prototype EMI colour cameras and associated equipment in 1966 and began running trials, with shows being transmitted on internal networks for viewing by employees.

==Transmitters and sub-regions==
Until 1965, viewers in both south east Wales and the English West parts of the franchise received ITV on VHF channel 10 from the ITA transmitter at St Hilary located on Stalling Down, near Cowbridge in south Wales. This did not accommodate separate programme services and so a combined service was provided to viewers in both the Welsh and English parts of the single licence area. Although TWW had studios in both Cardiff and Bristol, the outputs of these were combined at Cardiff into a single programme stream to feed the single transmitter at St Hilary. Hence, for example, local news bulletins involved an on-air switch or handover between the two studios and viewers would alternately see items from both sources.

Whilst the original service provided by TWW from St Hilary had to carry a mix of content for viewers on each side of the Bristol Channel, the west and north of Wales were served by other VHF transmitters which carried a more specific Welsh programme service branded Teledu Cymru. TWW had acquired the licence to broadcast to the west and north of Wales following the commercial failure of WWN.

Following the acquisition of WWN, a second VHF transmitter (using VHF channel 7) was added at St Hilary in 1965 to effectively extend the Teledu Cymru network into SE Wales thus permitting programmes of specific interest in Wales to be broadcast exclusively to Wales whilst running a separate schedule for English and South Wales viewers on channel 10. This was the first significant step in providing two distinct and separate programme services for Wales and for West and effectively established TWW&#x27;s area as a &#x27;dual region&#x27; during the last few years of their tenure.

==Identity==
TWW&#x27;s on screen identity consisted, originally, of a circle containing the letters TWW, with a large &#x27;T&#x27; in the centre and a small &#x27;W&#x27; to either side. This apparently static caption was used for the first few years of the station&#x27;s existence before the familiar box logo appeared. This logo was animated and formed when the boxes rotated revealing one letter at a time, accompanied by a twelve-note fanfare.

Following the acquisition of WWN, their Teledu Cymru branding was utilised by TWW for the North and West Wales service. The TWW logo was added beneath the Teledu Cymru dragon, along with the caption &#x27;Network for Wales&#x27;.

==Programmes==
TWW did not produce many programmes for the ITV network, although the monthly Sunday evening Welsh musical entertainment show, &quot;Land of Song&quot;, proved very popular during its six-year run 1958–64; TWW&#x27;s news and local programming were well regarded (it won many plaudits for its sensitive coverage of the Aberfan Disaster).

Its Welsh magazine programme was called &quot;Amser Te&quot; (&quot;Tea Time&quot;). Amongst other items, it featured a regular cookery item hosted by Myfanwy Howell and the popular Welsh music show &quot;Gwlad y Gan&quot;.

TWW also launched the careers of many famous faces, who appeared on their early broadcasts. These include John Humphrys and Claire Rayner. TWW was the first to showcase Adge Cutler – his appearances on the TWW programme &#x27;The Cider Apple&#x27; led to Adge&#x27;s fame spreading and the formation of The Wurzels. Michael Palin was one of the presenters of TWW&#x27;s pop show &#x27;NOW!&#x27;. Bruce Lewis was one of TWW&#x27;s main news presenters; he went on to write various books about his experience during the Second World War, &quot;Aircrew, a Few of the First&quot;, plus other titles such as &quot;How to be A TV Presenter&quot; – his son, Peter Lewis, hosted &quot;Movie Magazine&quot; and went on to announce for TWW, HTV West, and most famously, LWT.

<text>The Pennyroyal Plateau or Pennyroyal Region, often spelled Pennyrile, is a large physiographic region of Kentucky that features rolling hills, caves, and karst topography in general. It is named for &quot;Hedeoma pulegioides&quot; (the American pennyroyal), a wild mint that grows in the area. It is also called the &quot;Mississippian Plateau,&quot; for the Mississippian geologic age in which it was formed.

The Pennyroyal is bordered by the Pottsville Escarpment in the east. The Pottsville Escarpment is the transition zone from the central part of Kentucky to the higher and geologically younger Cumberland Plateau in the eastern part of the state. 
The Pennyroyal is bordered on the north by Muldraugh Hill, the geological escarpment that forms the transition from the geologically older Bluegrass to the Pennyroyal. This is a series of knobs and ridges based on hard siltstones.

The Pennyroyal is bordered on the west by the younger Jackson Purchase. The Pennyroyal is often thought by non-geologists to include the West Kentucky Coal Field of Pennsylvanian age, located in the northwestern area of the state, as the southeastern part of the Illinois Basin. The coalfield and the Pennyroyal are of different geologic ages and are separated by the Clifty Region, largely of Pennsylvanian sandstone, occasionally bituminous; the boundary with the Pennyroyal is the Dripping Springs Escarpment.

To the south, the Pennyroyal continues as the Highland Rim of Middle Tennessee.

The Pennyroyal is largely in farmland where the bedrock is limestone, and most of the Pennyroyal is based on Mississippian limestone, particularly the St. Louis Limestone or Ste. Genevieve Limestone. In some areas, the limestone is capped with a soft sandstone. This kind of formation is featured in the Mammoth Cave area, and has enabled the formation of the world&#x27;s most extensive cave system. Numerous other caves exist in the Pennyroyal, where some of the most intensely cave-forming limestones of the world are to be found.

Where the capping sandstone is intact, the land surface is usually forested, rugged hills.

<doc id="179750" wikidata="Q122723" url="?curid=179750" title="Osaka Prefecture">
<text>is a prefecture of Japan located in the Kansai region of Honshu. Osaka Prefecture has a population of 8,778,035 () and has a geographic area of . Osaka Prefecture borders Hyōgo Prefecture to the northwest, Kyoto Prefecture to the north, Nara Prefecture to the southeast, and Wakayama Prefecture to the south.

Osaka is the capital and largest city of Osaka Prefecture, and the third-largest city in Japan, with other major cities including Sakai, Higashiōsaka, and Hirakata. Osaka Prefecture is located on the western coast of the Kii Peninsula, forming the western is open to Osaka Bay. Osaka Prefecture is the third-most-populous prefecture, but by geographic area the second-smallest; at it is the second-most densely populated, below only Tokyo. Osaka Prefecture is one of Japan&#x27;s two &quot;urban prefectures&quot; using the designation &quot;fu&quot; (府) rather than the standard &quot;ken&quot; for prefectures, along with Kyoto Prefecture. Osaka Prefecture forms the center of the Keihanshin metropolitan area, the second-most-populated urban region in Japan after the Greater Tokyo area and one of the world&#x27;s most productive regions by GDP.

== History ==
Prior to the Meiji Restoration, the modern-day area of Osaka Prefecture was split between Kawachi, Izumi, and Settsu provinces.

Osaka Prefecture was created on June 21, 1868, at the very beginning of the Meiji era. During the instigation of Fuhanken Sanchisei in 1868, the prefecture received its suffix &quot;fu&quot;, designating it as a prefecture.

On September 1, 1956, the city of Osaka was promoted to a city designated by government ordinance and thereby divided into 24 wards. Sakai became the second city in the prefecture to be promoted to a city designated by government ordinance on April 1, 2006, and was divided into seven wards.

In 2000, Fusae Ota became Japan&#x27;s first female governor when she replaced Knock Yokoyama, who resigned after prosecution for sexual harassment. Tōru Hashimoto, previously famous as a counselor on television, was elected in 2008 at the age of 38, becoming the youngest governor in Japan.

On June 18, 2018, an earthquake struck the northern region of the prefecture. It killed 4 people and caused minor damage across Greater Osaka.

===Proposed reorganisation===
In 2010, the Osaka Restoration Association was created with backing by Governor Tōru Hashimoto, with hopes of reforming Osaka Prefecture into the Osaka Metropolis and merging with the City of Osaka. In the 2011 local elections, the association was able to win the majority of the prefectural seats and Hashimoto was elected as mayor of Osaka.

A referendum on the issue was held in 2015 and was defeated with 50.38% of voters opposed to the plan. A second referendum in 2020 was rejected by 50.6% of voters.

== Geography ==
Osaka Prefecture neighbors the prefectures of Hyōgo and Kyoto in the north, Nara in the east and Wakayama in the south. The Yodo and Yamato Rivers flow through the prefecture.

Prior to the construction of Kansai International Airport, Osaka was the smallest prefecture in Japan. The artificial island on which the airport was built added enough area to make it slightly larger than Kagawa Prefecture.

As of 1 April 2012, 11% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks, namely Kongō-Ikoma-Kisen and Meiji no Mori Minō Quasi-National Parks and Hokusetsu and Hannan-Misaki Prefectural Natural Parks.

=== Municipalities ===

Since 2005, Osaka consists of 43 municipalities: 33 cities, nine towns and one village. As of 2021, the 33 cities include two designated major cities, seven core cities and two (transitional) special case cities (after legal abolition in 2015, to be replaced with the core city system in the 2020s).
=== Mergers ===

After the modern reactivation of districts in 1878/79, Osaka, including Sakai which was only merged into Osaka in 1881, consisted of 5 urban districts &quot;(-ku)&quot; and 27 rural districts &quot;(-gun)&quot;, excluding 15 districts in Yamato Province which was later separated from Osaka as Nara Prefecture in 1887. When the prefectures were subdivided into modern municipalities in 1889, the five urban districts were turned into two district-independent cities: Osaka City and Sakai City, and Osaka&#x27;s [rural] districts were subdivided into 12 towns and 310 villages. After Osaka City had absorbed many surrounding municipalities in the interwar/Taishō period, the number of municipalities in Osaka had already dropped to 149 by 1953. The Great Shōwa mergers of the 1950s reduced the total to 47 by 1961, including 26 cities by then. The current total of 43 was reached during the Great Heisei mergers in 2005.

== Economy ==
 


The gross prefecture product of Osaka for the fiscal year 2004 was ¥38.7 trillion, second after Tokyo with an increase of 0.9% from the previous year. This represented approximately 48% of the Kinki region. The per capita income was ¥3.0 million, seventh in the nation. Commercial sales the same year was ¥60.1 trillion.

Overshadowed by such globally renowned electronics giants as Panasonic and Sharp, the other side of Osaka&#x27;s economy can be characterized by its Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) activities. The number of SMEs based in Osaka in 2006 was 330,737, accounting for 99.6% of the total number of businesses in the prefecture. While this proportion is similar to other prefectures (the average nationwide was 99.7%), the manufactured output of the SMEs amounted to 65.4% of the total within the prefecture, a rate significantly higher than Tokyo&#x27;s 55.5%, or Kanagawa&#x27;s 38.4%. One model from Osaka of serving the public interest and restimulating the regional economy, combined with industry-education cooperation efforts, is the Astro-Technology SOHLA, with its artificial satellite project. Having originally started from a gathering of Higashiosaka based SMEs, Astro-Technology SOHLA has not only grown into a Kansai region-wide group but has also won support from the government, through technology and material support from Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), and financial support from NEDO.

The Osaka Securities Exchange, specializing in derivatives such as Nikkei 225 Futures, is based in Osaka.

There are many electrical, chemical, pharmaceutical, heavy industry, food, and housing companies in Osaka Prefecture.

As of 2022 this prefecture has about 93,000 ethnic Korean persons, the largest such population of any prefecture in Japan. Osaka City. As of 2013 most ethnic Korean children attend ordinary Japanese public schools, although some Korean schools operated by the Chongryon and classes for ethnic Koreans had opened in the prefecture. During the Japanese rule of Korea many ethnic Koreans came to the Osaka area to look for work. Many people from Jeju came to the Osaka area after a 1922 ferry line between Osaka and Jeju opened.

<doc id="179757" wikidata="Q471839" url="?curid=179757" title="Science fiction film">
<text>Science fiction (or sci-fi) is a film genre that uses speculative, fictional science-based depictions of phenomena that are not fully accepted by mainstream science, such as extraterrestrial lifeforms, spacecraft, robots, cyborgs, mutants, interstellar travel, time travel, or other technologies. Science fiction films have often been used to focus on political or social issues, and to explore philosophical issues like the human condition.

The genre has existed since the early years of silent cinema, when Georges Méliès&#x27; &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot; (1902) employed trick photography effects. The next major example (first in feature-length in the genre) was the film &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1927). From the 1930s to the 1950s, the genre consisted mainly of low-budget B movies. After Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s landmark &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968), the science fiction film genre was taken more seriously. In the late 1970s, big-budget science fiction films filled with special effects became popular with audiences after the success of &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977) and paved the way for the blockbuster hits of subsequent decades.

Screenwriter and scholar Eric R. Williams identifies science fiction films as one of eleven super-genres in his screenwriters’ taxonomy, stating that all feature-length narrative films can be classified by these super-genres.  The other ten super-genres are action, crime, fantasy, horror, romance, slice of life, sports, thriller, war, and western.

==Characteristics of the genre==
According to Vivian Sobchack, a British cinema and media theorist and cultural critic:

Science fiction film is a film genre which emphasizes actual, extrapolative, or 2.0 speculative science and the empirical method, interacting in a social context with the lesser emphasized, but still present, transcendentalism of magic and religion, in an attempt to reconcile man with the unknown.
:— Vivian Carol Sobchack, p. 63
This definition suggests a continuum between (real-world) empiricism and (supernatural) transcendentalism, with science fiction films on the side of empiricism, and happy films and sad films on the side of transcendentalism. However, there are numerous well-known examples of science fiction horror films, epitomized by such pictures as &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;Alien&quot;.

The visual style of science fiction film is characterized by a clash between alien and familiar images. This clash is implemented when alien images become familiar, as in &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, when the repetitions of the Korova Milkbar make the alien decor seem more familiar. As well, familiar images become alien, as in the films &quot;Repo Man&quot; and &quot;Liquid Sky&quot;. For example, in &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, the distortion of the humans make the familiar images seem more alien. Finally, alien images are juxtaposed with the familiar, as in &quot;The Deadly Mantis&quot;, when a giant praying mantis is shown climbing the Washington Monument.

Cultural theorist Scott Bukatman has proposed that science fiction film allows contemporary culture to witness an expression of the sublime, be it through exaggerated scale, apocalypse or transcendence.

==History==

===1900–1920s===

Science fiction films appeared early in the silent film era, typically as short films shot in black and white, sometimes with colour tinting. They usually had a technological theme and were often intended to be humorous. In 1902, Georges Méliès released &quot;Le Voyage dans la Lune&quot;, generally considered the first science fiction film, and a film that used early trick photography to depict a spacecraft&#x27;s journey to the Moon. Several early films merged the science fiction and horror genres. Examples of this are &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1910), a film adaptation of Mary Shelley&#x27;s novel, and &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; (1920), based on the psychological tale by Robert Louis Stevenson. Taking a more adventurous tack, &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; (1916) is a film based on Jules Verne’s famous novel of a wondrous submarine and its vengeful captain. In the 1920s, European filmmakers tended to use science fiction for prediction and social commentary, as can be seen in German films such as &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1927) and &quot;Frau im Mond&quot; (1929). Other notable science fiction films of the silent era include &quot;The Impossible Voyage&quot; (1904), &quot;The Motorist&quot; (1906), &quot;The Conquest of the Pole&quot; (1912), &quot;Himmelskibet&quot; (1918; which with its runtime of 97 minutes generally is considered the first feature-length science fiction film in history), &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot; (1920), &quot;The Mechanical Man&quot; (1921), &quot;Paris Qui Dort&quot; (1923), &quot;Aelita&quot; (1924), &quot;Luch Smerti&quot; (1925), and &quot;The Lost World&quot; (1925).

===1930s–1950s===
In the 1930s, there were several big budget science fiction films, notably &quot;Just Imagine&quot; (1930), &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933), &quot;Things to Come&quot; (1936), and &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; (1937). Starting in 1936, a number of science fiction comic strips were adapted as serials, notably &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; and &quot;Buck Rogers&quot;, both starring Buster Crabbe. These serials, and the comic strips they were based on, were very popular with the general public. Other notable science fiction films of the 1930s include &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1931), &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; (1935), &quot;Doctor X&quot; (1932), &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; (1931), &quot;F.P.1&quot; (1932), &quot;Island of Lost Souls&quot; (1932), &quot;Deluge&quot; (1933), &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; (1933), &quot;Master of the World&quot; (1934), &quot;Mad Love&quot; (1935), &quot;Trans-Atlantic Tunnel&quot; (1935), &quot;The Devil-Doll&quot; (1936), &quot;The Invisible Ray&quot; (1936), &quot;The Man Who Changed His Mind&quot; (1936), &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; (1936), &quot;Non-Stop New York&quot; (1937), and &quot;The Return of Doctor X&quot; (1939). The 1940s brought us &quot;Before I Hang&quot; (1940), &quot;Black Friday&quot; (1940), &quot;Dr. Cyclops&quot; (1940), &quot;The Devil Commands&quot; (1941), &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; (1941), &quot;Man Made Monster&quot; (1941), &quot;It Happened Tomorrow&quot; (1944), &quot;It Happens Every Spring&quot; (1949), and &quot;The Perfect Woman&quot; (1949). The release of &quot;Destination Moon&quot; (1950) and &quot;Rocketship X-M&quot; (1950) brought us to what many people consider &quot;the golden age of the science fiction film&quot;.

In the 1950s, public interest in space travel and new technologies was great. While many 1950s science fiction films were low-budget B movies, there were several successful films with larger budgets and impressive special effects. These include &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; (1951), &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot; (1951), &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot; (1951), &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; (1953), &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; (1954), &quot;This Island Earth&quot; (1955), &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; (1956), &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; (1956), &quot;The Curse of Frankenstein&quot; (1957), &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; (1959) and &quot;On the Beach&quot; (1959). There is often a close connection between films in the science fiction genre and the so-called &quot;monster movie&quot;. Examples of this are &quot;Them!&quot; (1954), &quot;The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms&quot; (1953) and &quot;The Blob&quot; (1958). During the 1950s, Ray Harryhausen, protege of master King Kong animator Willis O&#x27;Brien, used stop-motion animation to create special effects for the following notable science fiction films: &quot;It Came from Beneath the Sea&quot; (1955), &quot;Earth vs. the Flying Saucers&quot; (1956) and &quot;20 Million Miles to Earth&quot; (1957).

The most successful monster movies were Japanese film studio Toho&#x27;s &quot;kaiju&quot; films directed by Ishirō Honda and featuring special effects by Eiji Tsuburaya. The 1954 film &quot;Godzilla&quot;, with the title monster attacking Tokyo, gained immense popularity, spawned multiple sequels, led to other kaiju films like &quot;Rodan&quot;, and created one of the most recognizable monsters in cinema history. Japanese science fiction films, particularly the tokusatsu and kaiju genres, were known for their extensive use of special effects, and gained worldwide popularity in the 1950s. Kaiju and tokusatsu films, notably &quot;Warning from Space&quot; (1956), sparked Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s interest in science fiction films and influenced &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968). According to his biographer John Baxter, despite their &quot;clumsy model sequences, the films were often well-photographed in colour ... and their dismal dialogue was delivered in well-designed and well-lit sets.&quot;

===1960s-present===
With the Space Race between the USSR and the US going on, documentaries and illustrations of actual events, pioneers and technology were plenty. Any movie featuring realistic space travel was at risk of being obsolete at its time of release, rather fossil than fiction. There were relatively few science fiction films in the 1960s, but some of the films transformed science fiction cinema. Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968) brought new realism to the genre, with its groundbreaking visual effects and realistic portrayal of space travel and influenced the genre with its epic story and transcendent philosophical scope. Other 1960s films included &quot;Planet of the Vampires&quot; (1965) by Italian filmmaker Mario Bava, that is regarded as one of the best movies of the period, &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; (1968) and &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; (1966), which provided social commentary, and the campy &quot;Barbarella&quot; (1968), which explored the comical side of earlier science fiction. Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s French &quot;new wave&quot; film &quot;Alphaville&quot; (1965) posited a futuristic Paris commanded by an artificial intelligence which has outlawed all emotion.

The era of crewed trips to the Moon in 1969 and the 1970s saw a resurgence of interest in the science fiction film. Andrei Tarkovsky&#x27;s &quot;Solaris&quot; (1972) and &quot;Stalker&quot; (1979) are two widely acclaimed examples of the renewed interest of film &quot;auteurs&quot; in science fiction. Science fiction films from the early 1970s explored the theme of paranoia, in which humanity is depicted as under threat from sociological, ecological or technological adversaries of its own creation, such as George Lucas&#x27;s directional debut &quot;THX 1138&quot; (1971), &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot; (1971), &quot;Silent Running&quot; (1972), &quot;Soylent Green&quot; (1973), &quot;Westworld&quot; (1973) and its sequel &quot;Futureworld&quot; (1976), and &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot; (1976). The science fiction comedies of the 1970s included Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Sleeper&quot; (1973), and John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Dark Star&quot; (1974). The sports science fiction genre can be seen in films such as Rollerball (1975).

&quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977) and &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; (1977) were box-office hits that brought about a huge increase in science fiction films. In 1979, &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; brought the television series to the big screen for the first time. It was also in this period that the Walt Disney Company released many science fiction films for family audiences such as &quot;The Black Hole&quot;, &quot;Flight of the Navigator&quot;, and &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot;. The sequels to &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980) and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983), also saw worldwide box office success. Ridley Scott&#x27;s films, such as &quot;Alien&quot; (1979) and &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982), along with James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;The Terminator&quot; (1984), presented the future as dark, dirty and chaotic, and depicted aliens and androids as hostile and dangerous. In contrast, Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (1982), one of the most successful films of the 1980s, presented aliens as benign and friendly, a theme already present in Spielberg&#x27;s own &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;. James Bond also entered the science fiction genre in 1979 with &quot;Moonraker&quot;.

The big budget adaptations of Frank Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; and Alex Raymond&#x27;s &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, as well as Peter Hyams&#x27;s sequel to &quot;2001&quot;, &quot;2010: The Year We Make Contact&quot; (based on &quot;2001&quot; author Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s sequel novel &quot;2010: Odyssey Two&quot;), were box office failures that dissuaded producers from investing in science fiction literary properties. Disney&#x27;s &quot;Tron&quot; (1982) turned out to be a moderate success. The strongest contributors to the genre during the second half of the 1980s were James Cameron and Paul Verhoeven with &quot;The Terminator&quot; and &quot;RoboCop&quot; entries. Robert Zemeckis&#x27; film &quot;Back to the Future&quot; (1985) and its sequels were critically praised and became box office successes, not to mention international phenomena. James Cameron&#x27;s sequel to &quot;Alien&quot;, &quot;Aliens&quot; (1986), was very different from the original film, falling more into the action/science fiction genre, it was both a critical and commercial success and Sigourney Weaver was nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role at the Academy Awards. The Japanese cyberpunk anime film &quot;Akira&quot; (1988) also had a big influence outside Japan when released.

In the 1990s, the emergence of the World Wide Web and the cyberpunk genre spawned several movies on the theme of the computer-human interface, such as &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; (1991), &quot;Total Recall&quot; (1990), &quot;The Lawnmower Man&quot; (1992), and &quot;The Matrix&quot; (1999). Other themes included disaster films (e.g., &quot;Armageddon&quot; and &quot;Deep Impact&quot;, both 1998), alien invasion (e.g., &quot;Independence Day&quot; (1996)) and genetic experimentation (e.g., &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; (1993) and &quot;Gattaca&quot; (1997)). Also, the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequel trilogy began with the release of &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;, which eventually grossed over one billion dollars.

As the decade progressed, computers played an increasingly important role in both the addition of special effects (thanks to &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; and &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;) and the production of films. As software developed in sophistication it was used to produce more complicated effects. It also enabled filmmakers to enhance the visual quality of animation, resulting in films such as &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; (1995) from Japan, and &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; (1999) from the United States.

During the first decade of the 2000s, superhero films abounded, as did earthbound science fiction such as the &quot;Matrix&quot; trilogy. In 2005, the &quot;Star Wars&quot; saga was completed (although it was later continued, but at the time it was not intended to be) with the darkly themed &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot;. Science-fiction also returned as a tool for political commentary in films such as &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot;, &quot;Minority Report&quot;, &quot;Sunshine&quot;, &quot;District 9&quot;, &quot;Children of Men&quot;, &quot;Serenity&quot;, &quot;Sleep Dealer&quot;, and &quot;Pandorum&quot;. The 2000s also saw the release of &quot;Transformers&quot; (2007) and &quot;&quot; (2009), both of which resulted in worldwide box office success. In 2009, James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Avatar&quot; garnered worldwide box office success, and would later become the highest-grossing movie of all time. This movie was also an example of political commentary. It depicted humans destroying the environment on another planet by mining for a special metal called unobtainium. That same year, &quot;Terminator Salvation&quot; was released and garnered only moderate success.

The 2010s saw new entries in several classic science fiction franchises, including &quot;Predators&quot; (2010), &quot;&quot; (2010), a resurgence of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; series, and entries into the &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; and &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchises. Several more cross-genre films have also been produced, including comedies such as &quot;Hot Tub Time Machine&quot; (2010), &quot;Seeking a Friend for the End of the World&quot; (2012), &quot;Safety Not Guaranteed&quot; (2013), and &quot;Pixels&quot; (2015), romance films such as &quot;Her&quot; (2013), &quot;Monsters&quot; (2010), and &quot;Ex Machina&quot; (2015), heist films including &quot;Inception&quot; (2010) and action films including &quot;Real Steel&quot; (2011), &quot;Total Recall&quot; (2012), &quot;Edge of Tomorrow&quot; (2014), &quot;Pacific Rim&quot; (2013), &quot;Chappie&quot; (2015), &quot;Tomorrowland&quot; (2015), and &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; (2017). The superhero film boom has also continued, into films such as &quot;Iron Man 2&quot; (2010) and &quot;Iron Man 3&quot; (2013), several entries into the X-Men film series, and &quot;The Avengers&quot; (2012), which became the fourth-highest-grossing film of all time. New franchises such as &quot;Deadpool&quot; and &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; also began in this decade.

Further into the decade, more realistic science fiction epic films also become prevalent, including &quot;Battleship&quot; (2012), &quot;Gravity&quot; (2013), &quot;Elysium&quot; (2013), &quot;Interstellar&quot; (2014), &quot;Mad Max: Fury Road&quot; (2015), &quot;The Martian&quot; (2015), &quot;Arrival&quot; (2016), &quot;Passengers&quot; (2016), and &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot; (2017). Many of these films have gained widespread accolades, including several Academy Award wins and nominations. These films have addressed recent matters of scientific interest, including space travel, climate change, and artificial intelligence.

Alongside these original films, many adaptations were produced, especially within the young adult dystopian fiction subgenre, popular in the early part of the decade. These include the &quot;Hunger Games&quot; film series, based on the trilogy of novels by Suzanne Collins, &quot;The Divergent Series&quot; based on Veronica Roth&#x27;s Divergent trilogy, and the &quot;Maze Runner&quot; series, based on James Dashner&#x27;s &quot;The Maze Runner&quot; novels. Several adult adaptations have also been produced, including &quot;The Martian&quot; (2015), based on Andy Weir&#x27;s 2011 novel, &quot;Cloud Atlas&quot; (2012), based on David Mitchell&#x27;s 2004 novel, &quot;World War Z&quot;, based on Max Brooks&#x27; 2006 novel, and &quot;Ready Player One&quot; (2018), based on Ernest Cline&#x27;s 2011 novel.

Independent productions also increased in the 2010s, with the rise of digital filmmaking making it easier for filmmakers to produce movies on a smaller budget. These films include &quot;Attack the Block&quot; (2011), &quot;Source Code&quot; (2011), &quot;Looper&quot; (2012), &quot;Upstream Color&quot; (2013), &quot;Ex Machina&quot; (2015), and &quot;Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets&quot; (2017). In 2016, &quot;Ex Machina&quot; won the Academy Award for Visual Effects in a surprising upset over the much higher-budget &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; (2015).

==Themes, imagery, and visual elements==
Science fiction films are often speculative in nature, and often include key supporting elements of science and technology. However, as often as not the &quot;science&quot; in a Hollywood science fiction movie can be considered pseudo-science, relying primarily on atmosphere and quasi-scientific artistic fancy than facts and conventional scientific theory. The definition can also vary depending on the viewpoint of the observer.

Many science fiction films include elements of mysticism, occult, magic, or the supernatural, considered by some to be more properly elements of fantasy or the occult (or religious) film. This transforms the movie genre into a science fantasy with a religious or quasi-religious philosophy serving as the driving motivation. The movie &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; employs many common science fiction elements, but the film carries a profound message - that the evolution of a species toward technological perfection (in this case exemplified by the disappeared alien civilization called the &quot;Krell&quot;) does not ensure the loss of primitive and dangerous urges. In the film, this part of the primitive mind manifests itself as monstrous destructive force emanating from the Freudian subconscious, or &quot;Id&quot;.

Some films blur the line between the genres, such as films where the protagonist gains the extraordinary powers of the superhero. These films usually employ quasi-plausible reason for the hero gaining these powers.

Not all science fiction themes are equally suitable for movies. Science fiction horror is most common. Often enough, these films could just as well pass as Westerns or World War II films if the science fiction props were removed. Common motifs also include voyages and expeditions to other planets, and dystopias, while utopias are rare.

===Imagery===
Film theorist Vivian Sobchack argues that science fiction films differ from fantasy films in that while science fiction film seeks to achieve our belief in the images we are viewing, fantasy film instead attempts to suspend our disbelief. The science fiction film displays the unfamiliar and alien in the context of the familiar. Despite the alien nature of the scenes and science fictional elements of the setting, the imagery of the film is related back to humankind and how we relate to our surroundings. While the science fiction film strives to push the boundaries of the human experience, they remain bound to the conditions and understanding of the audience and thereby contain prosaic aspects, rather than being completely alien or abstract.

Genre films such as westerns or war movies are bound to a particular area or time period. This is not true of the science fiction film. However, there are several common visual elements that are evocative of the genre. These include the spacecraft or space station, alien worlds or creatures, robots, and futuristic gadgets. Examples include movies like &quot;Lost in Space&quot;, &quot;Serenity&quot;, &quot;Avatar&quot;, &quot;Prometheus&quot;, &quot;Tomorrowland&quot;, &quot;Passengers&quot;, and &quot;Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets&quot;. More subtle visual clues can appear with changes of the human form through modifications in appearance, size, or behavior, or by means a known environment turned eerily alien, such as an empty city &quot;The Omega Man&quot; (1971).

===Scientific elements===
While science is a major element of this genre, many movie studios take significant liberties with scientific knowledge. Such liberties can be most readily observed in films that show spacecraft maneuvering in outer space. The vacuum should preclude the transmission of sound or maneuvers employing wings, yet the soundtrack is filled with inappropriate flying noises and changes in flight path resembling an aircraft banking. The filmmakers, unfamiliar with the specifics of space travel, focus instead on providing acoustical atmosphere and the more familiar maneuvers of the aircraft.

Similar instances of ignoring science in favor of art can be seen when movies present environmental effects as portrayed in &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Entire planets are destroyed in titanic explosions requiring mere seconds, whereas an actual event of this nature takes many hours.

The role of the scientist has varied considerably in the science fiction film genre, depending on the public perception of science and advanced technology. Starting with Dr. Frankenstein, the mad scientist became a stock character who posed a dire threat to society and perhaps even civilization. Certain portrayals of the &quot;mad scientist&quot;, such as Peter Sellers&#x27;s performance in &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, have become iconic to the genre. In the monster films of the 1950s, the scientist often played a heroic role as the only person who could provide a technological fix for some impending doom. Reflecting the distrust of government that began in the 1960s in the United States, the brilliant but rebellious scientist became a common theme, often serving a Cassandra-like role during an impending disaster.

Biotechnology (e.g., cloning) is a popular scientific element in films as depicted in &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; (cloning of extinct species), &quot;The Island&quot; (cloning of humans), and (genetic modification) in some superhero movies and in the &quot;Alien&quot; series. Cybernetics and holographic projections as depicted in &quot;RoboCop&quot; and &quot;I, Robot&quot; are also popularized. Interstellar travel and teleportation is a popular theme in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; series that is achieved through warp drives and transporters while intergalactic travel is popular in films such as &quot;Stargate&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot; that is achieved through hyperspace or wormholes. Nanotechnology is also featured in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; series in the form of replicators (utopia), in &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; in the form of grey goo (dystopia), and in &quot;Iron Man 3&quot; in the form of extremis (nanotubes). Force fields is a popular theme in &quot;Independence Day&quot; while invisibility is also popular in &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Arc reactor technology, featured in &quot;Iron Man&quot;, is similar to a cold fusion device. Miniaturization technology where people are shrunk to microscopic sizes is featured in films like &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot; (1966), &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot; (1989), and Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Ant-Man&quot; (2015).

The late Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s third law states that &quot;any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic&quot;. Past science fiction films have depicted &quot;fictional&quot; (&quot;magical&quot;) technologies that became present reality. For example, the Personal Access Display Device from &quot;Star Trek&quot; was a precursor of smartphones and tablet computers. Gesture recognition in the movie &quot;Minority Report&quot; is part of current game consoles. Human-level artificial intelligence is also fast approaching with the advent of smartphone A.I. while a working cloaking device / material is the main goal of stealth technology. Autonomous cars (e.g. KITT from the &quot;Knight Rider&quot; series) and quantum computers, like in the movie &quot;Stealth&quot; and &quot;Transcendence&quot;, also will be available eventually. Furthermore, although Clarke&#x27;s laws do not classify &quot;sufficiently advanced&quot; technologies, the Kardashev scale measures a civilization&#x27;s level of technological advancement into types. Due to its exponential nature, sci-fi civilizations usually only attain Type I (harnessing all the energy attainable from a single planet), and strictly speaking often not even that.

===Alien lifeforms===
The concept of life, particularly intelligent life, having an extraterrestrial origin is a popular staple of science fiction films. Early films often used alien life forms as a threat or peril to the human race, where the invaders were frequently fictional representations of actual military or political threats on Earth as observed in films such as &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot;, &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, the &quot;Alien&quot; series, the &quot;Predator&quot; series, and &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick&quot; series. Some aliens were represented as benign and even beneficial in nature in such films as &quot;Escape to Witch Mountain&quot;, &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;, &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;, &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;, &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, &quot;Avatar&quot;, &quot;Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets&quot;, and the &quot;Men in Black&quot; series.

In order to provide subject matter to which audiences can relate, the large majority of intelligent alien races presented in films have an anthropomorphic nature, possessing human emotions and motivations. In films like &quot;Cocoon&quot;, &quot;My Stepmother Is an Alien&quot;, &quot;Species&quot;, &quot;Contact&quot;, &quot;The Box&quot;, &quot;Knowing&quot;, &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;, and &quot;The Watch&quot;, the aliens were nearly human in physical appearance, and communicated in a common earth language. However, the aliens in &quot;Stargate&quot; and &quot;Prometheus&quot; were human in physical appearance but communicated in an alien language. A few films have tried to represent intelligent aliens as something utterly different from the usual humanoid shape (e.g. An intelligent life form surrounding an entire planet in &quot;Solaris&quot;, the ball shaped creature in &quot;Dark Star&quot;, microbial-like creatures in &quot;The Invasion&quot;, shape-shifting creatures in &quot;Evolution&quot;). Recent trends in films involve building-size alien creatures like in the movie &quot;Pacific Rim&quot; where the CGI has tremendously improved over the previous decades as compared in previous films such as &quot;Godzilla&quot;.

===Disaster films===
A frequent theme among science fiction films is that of impending or actual disaster on an epic scale. These often address a particular concern of the writer by serving as a vehicle of warning against a type of activity, including technological research. In the case of alien invasion films, the creatures can provide as a stand-in for a feared foreign power.

Films that fit into the Disaster film typically also fall into the following general categories:

* Alien invasion: Hostile extraterrestrials arrive and seek to supplant humanity. They are either overwhelmingly powerful or very insidious. Typical examples include &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; (1953), &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; (1956), &quot;Daleks&#x27; Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.&quot; (1966), &quot;Independence Day&quot; (1996), &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; (2005), &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; (2008), &quot;Skyline&quot; (2010), &quot;The Darkest Hour&quot; (2011), &quot;&quot; (2011), &quot;Battleship&quot; (2012), &quot;The Avengers&quot; (2012), &quot;Man of Steel&quot; (2013), &quot;Pacific Rim&quot; (2013), &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; (2013), &quot;Pixels&quot; (2015), &quot;Independence Day: Resurgence&quot; (2016), and &quot;Justice League&quot; (2017). &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; (1999) takes an alternative look at the subject, involving an extraterrestrial political entity invading planet Naboo for commercial reasons.
* Environmental disaster: such as major climate change, or an asteroid or comet strike. Movies that have employed this theme include &quot;Soylent Green&quot; (1973), &quot;Waterworld&quot; (1995), &quot;Deep Impact&quot; (1998), &quot;Armageddon&quot; (1998), &quot;The Core&quot; (2003), &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; (2004), &quot;2012&quot; (2009), &quot;Snowpiercer&quot; (2013) and &quot;Geostorm&quot; (2017).
* Man supplanted by technology: Typically in the form of an all-powerful computer, advanced robots or cyborgs, or else genetically modified humans or animals. Among the films in this category are the &quot;Terminator&quot; series, &quot;The Matrix&quot; trilogy, &quot;I, Robot&quot; (2004), and the &quot;Transformers&quot; series.
* Nuclear war: Usually in the form of a dystopic, post-holocaust tale of grim survival. Examples of such a storyline can be found in the movies &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; (1964), &quot;Dr. Who and the Daleks&quot; (1965), &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; (1968; remade in 2001), &quot;A Boy and His Dog&quot; (1975), &quot;Mad Max&quot; (1979), &quot;City of Ember&quot; (2008), &quot;The Book of Eli&quot; (2010), &quot;Oblivion&quot; (2013), &quot;Mad Max: Fury Road&quot; (2015), and &quot;Friend of the World&quot; (2020).
* Pandemic: A highly lethal disease, often one created by man, threatens or wipes out most of humanity in a massive plague. This topic has been treated in such films as &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot; (1971), &quot;The Omega Man&quot; (1971), &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; (1995), &quot;28 Weeks Later&quot; (2007), &quot;I Am Legend&quot; (2007), and the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; series. This version of the genre sometimes mixes with zombie films or other monster movies.

===Monster films===
While monster films do not usually depict danger on a global or epic scale, science fiction film also has a long tradition of movies featuring monster attacks. These differ from similar films in the horror or fantasy genres because science fiction films typically rely on a scientific (or at least pseudo-scientific) rationale for the monster&#x27;s existence, rather than a supernatural or magical reason. Often, the science fiction film monster is created, awakened, or &quot;evolves&quot; because of the machinations of a mad scientist, a nuclear accident, or a scientific experiment gone awry. Typical examples include &quot;The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms&quot; (1953), &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; films, &quot;Cloverfield&quot;, &quot;Pacific Rim&quot;, the &quot;King Kong&quot; films, and the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise or the many films involving Frankenstein&#x27;s monster.

===Mind and identity===
The core mental aspects of what makes us human has been a staple of science fiction films, particularly since the 1980s. Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982), an adaptation of Philip K. Dick&#x27;s novel &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot;, examined what made an organic-creation a human, while the &quot;RoboCop&quot; series saw an android mechanism fitted with the brain and reprogrammed mind of a human to create a cyborg. The idea of brain transfer was not entirely new to science fiction film, as the concept of the &quot;mad scientist&quot; transferring the human mind to another body is as old as &quot;Frankenstein&quot; while the idea of corporations behind mind transfer technologies is observed in later films such as &quot;Gamer&quot;, &quot;Avatar&quot;, and &quot;Surrogates&quot;.

Films such as &quot;Total Recall&quot; have popularized a thread of films that explore the concept of reprogramming the human mind. The theme of brainwashing in several films of the sixties and seventies including &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; and &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; coincided with secret real-life government experimentation during Project MKULTRA. Voluntary erasure of memory is further explored as themes of the films &quot;Paycheck&quot; and &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot;. Some films like &quot;Limitless&quot; explore the concept of mind enhancement. The anime series &quot;Serial Experiments Lain&quot; also explores the idea of reprogrammable reality and memory.

The idea that a human could be entirely represented as a program in a computer was a core element of the film &quot;Tron&quot;. This would be further explored in the film version of &quot;The Lawnmower Man&quot;, &quot;Transcendence&quot;, and &quot;Ready Player One&quot; and the idea reversed in &quot;Virtuosity&quot; as computer programs sought to become real persons. In &quot;The Matrix&quot; series, the virtual reality world became a real-world prison for humanity, managed by intelligent machines. In movies such as &quot;eXistenZ&quot;, &quot;The Thirteenth Floor&quot;, and &quot;Inception&quot;, the nature of reality and virtual reality become intermixed with no clear distinguishing boundary.

&quot;Telekinesis&quot; and &quot;telepathy&quot; are featured in movies like &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;The Last Mimzy&quot;, &quot;Race to Witch Mountain&quot;, &quot;Chronicle&quot;, and &quot;Lucy&quot; while precognition is featured in &quot;Minority Report&quot; as well as in &quot;The Matrix&quot; saga (in which precognition is achieved by knowing the artificial world).

===Robots===
Robots have been a part of science fiction since the Czech playwright Karel Čapek coined the word in 1921. In early films, robots were usually played by a human actor in a boxy metal suit, as in &quot;The Phantom Empire&quot;, although the female robot in &quot;Metropolis&quot; is an exception. The first depiction of a sophisticated robot in a United States film was Gort in &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;.

Robots in films are often sentient and sometimes sentimental, and they have filled a range of roles in science fiction films. Robots have been supporting characters, such as Robby the Robot in &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;, Huey, Dewey and Louie in &quot;Silent Running&quot;, Data in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, sidekicks (e.g., C-3PO and R2-D2 from &quot;Star Wars&quot;, JARVIS from &quot;Iron Man&quot;), and extras, visible in the background to create a futuristic setting (e.g., &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot; (1989), &quot;Total Recall&quot; (2012), &quot;RoboCop&quot; (2014)). As well, robots have been formidable movie villains or monsters (e.g., the robot Box in the film &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot; (1976), HAL 9000 in &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, ARIIA in &quot;Eagle Eye&quot;, robot Sentinels in &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot;, the battle droids in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequel trilogy, or the huge robot probes seen in &quot;Monsters vs. Aliens&quot;). In some cases, robots have even been the leading characters in science fiction films; in the film &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982), many of the characters are bioengineered android &quot;replicants&quot;. This is also present in the animated films &quot;WALL-E&quot; (2008), &quot;Astro Boy&quot; (2009), &quot;Big Hero 6&quot; (2014), &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; (2017) and in &quot;Next Gen&quot; (2018).

Films like &quot;Bicentennial Man&quot;, &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot;, &quot;Chappie&quot;, and &quot;Ex Machina&quot; depicted the emotional fallouts of robots that are self-aware. Other films like &quot;The Animatrix (The Second Renaissance)&quot; present the consequences of mass-producing self-aware androids as humanity succumbs to their robot overlords.

One popular theme in science fiction film is whether robots will someday replace humans, a question raised in the film adaptation of Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;I, Robot&quot; (in jobs) and in the film &quot;Real Steel&quot; (in sports), or whether intelligent robots could develop a conscience and a motivation to protect, take over, or destroy the human race (as depicted in &quot;The Terminator&quot;, &quot;Transformers&quot;, and in &quot;&quot;). Another theme is remote telepresence via androids as depicted in &quot;Surrogates&quot; and &quot;Iron Man 3&quot;. As artificial intelligence becomes smarter due to increasing computer power, some sci-fi dreams have already been realized. For example, the computer Deep Blue beat the world chess champion in 1997 and a documentary film, &quot;Game Over: Kasparov and the Machine&quot;, was released in 2003. Another famous computer called Watson defeated the two best human &quot;Jeopardy&quot; (game show) players in 2011 and a NOVA documentary film, &quot;Smartest Machine on Earth&quot;, was released in the same year.

Building-size robots are also becoming a popular theme in movies as featured in &quot;Pacific Rim&quot;. Future live action films may include an adaptation of popular television series like &quot;Voltron&quot; and &quot;Robotech&quot;. The CGI robots of &quot;Pacific Rim&quot; and the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; (2017) reboot was greatly improved as compared to the original &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie&quot; (1995). While &quot;size does matter&quot;, a famous tagline of the movie &quot;Godzilla&quot;, incredibly small robots, called nanobots, do matter as well (e.g. Borg nanoprobes in &quot;Star Trek&quot; and nanites in &quot;I, Robot&quot;).

===Time travel===
The concept of time travel—travelling backwards and forwards through time—has always been a popular staple of science fiction film and science fiction television series. Time travel usually involves the use of some type of advanced technology, such as H. G. Wells&#x27; classic &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, the commercially successful 1980s-era &quot;Back to the Future&quot; trilogy, the &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&quot; trilogy, the &quot;Terminator&quot; series, &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; (2006), &quot;Source Code&quot; (2011), &quot;Edge of Tomorrow&quot; (2014), and &quot;Predestination&quot; (2014). Other movies, such as the &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; series, &quot;Timeline&quot; (2003) and &quot;The Last Mimzy&quot; (2007), explained their depictions of time travel by drawing on physics concepts such as the special relativity phenomenon of time dilation (which could occur if a spaceship was travelling near the speed of light) and wormholes. Some films show time travel not being attained from advanced technology, but rather from an inner source or personal power, such as the 2000s-era films &quot;Donnie Darko&quot;, &quot;Mr. Nobody&quot;, &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot;, and &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot;.

More conventional time travel movies use technology to bring the past to life in the present, or in a present that lies in our future. The film &quot;Iceman&quot; (1984) told the story of the reanimation of a frozen Neanderthal. The film &quot;Freejack&quot; (1992) shows time travel used to pull victims of horrible deaths forward in time a split-second before their demise, and then use their bodies for spare parts.

A common theme in time travel film is the paradoxical nature of travelling through time. In the French New Wave film &quot;La jetée&quot; (1962), director Chris Marker depicts the self-fulfilling aspect of a person being able to see their future by showing a child who witnesses the death of his future self. &quot;La Jetée&quot; was the inspiration for &quot;12 Monkeys&quot;, (1995) director Terry Gilliam&#x27;s film about time travel, memory and madness. The &quot;Back to the Future&quot; trilogy and &quot;The Time Machine&quot; go one step further and explore the result of altering the past, while in &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot; (1996) and &quot;Star Trek&quot; (2009) the crew must rescue the Earth from having its past altered by time-travelling cyborgs and alien races.

==Genre as commentary on social issues==
The science fiction film genre has long served as useful means of discussing sensitive topical issues without arousing controversy, and it often provides thoughtful social commentary on potential unforeseen future issues. The fictional setting allows for a deeper examination and reflection of the ideas presented, with the perspective of a viewer watching remote events. Most controversial issues in science fiction films tend to fall into two general storylines, Utopian or dystopian. Either a society will become better or worse in the future. Because of controversy, most science fiction films will fall into the dystopian film category rather than the Utopian category.

The types of commentary and controversy presented in science fiction films often illustrate the particular concerns of the periods in which they were produced. Early science fiction films expressed fears about automation replacing workers and the dehumanization of society through science and technology. For example, &quot;The Man in the White Suit&quot; (1951) used a science fiction concept as a means to satirize postwar British &quot;establishment&quot; conservatism, industrial capitalists, and trade unions. Another example is &quot;HAL 9000&quot; from &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968). He controls the shuttle, and later harms its crew. &quot;Kubrick&#x27;s vision reveals technology as a competitive force that must be defeated in order for humans to evolve.&quot; Later films explored the fears of environmental catastrophe, technology-created disasters, or overpopulation, and how they would impact society and individuals (e.g. &quot;Soylent Green&quot;, &quot;Elysium&quot;).

The monster movies of the 1950s—like &quot;Godzilla&quot; (1954)—served as stand-ins for fears of nuclear war, communism and views on the Cold War. In the 1970s, science fiction films also became an effective way of satirizing contemporary social mores with &quot;Silent Running&quot; and &quot;Dark Star&quot; presenting hippies in space as a riposte to the militaristic types that had dominated earlier films. Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; presented a horrific vision of youth culture, portraying a youth gang engaged in rape and murder, along with disturbing scenes of forced psychological conditioning serving to comment on societal responses to crime.

&quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot; depicted a futuristic swingers&#x27; utopia that practiced euthanasia as a form of population control and &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot; anticipated a reaction to the women&#x27;s liberation movement. &quot;Enemy Mine&quot; demonstrated that the foes we have come to hate are often just like us, even if they appear alien.

Contemporary science fiction films continue to explore social and political issues. One recent example is &quot;Minority Report&quot; (2002), debuting in the months after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and focused on the issues of police powers, privacy and civil liberties in a near-future United States. Some movies like &quot;The Island&quot; (2005) and &quot;Never Let Me Go&quot; (2010) explore the issues surrounding cloning.

More recently, the headlines surrounding events such as the Iraq War, international terrorism, the avian influenza scare, and United States anti-immigration laws have found their way into the consciousness of contemporary filmmakers. The film &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; (2006) drew inspiration from controversial issues such as the Patriot Act and the War on Terror, while science fiction thrillers such as &quot;Children of Men&quot; (also 2006), &quot;District 9&quot; (2009), and &quot;Elysium&quot; (2013) commented on diverse social issues such as xenophobia, propaganda, and cognitive dissonance. &quot;Avatar&quot; (2009) had remarkable resemblance to colonialism of native land, mining by multinational-corporations and the Iraq War.

===Future noir===
Lancaster University professor Jamaluddin Bin Aziz argues that as science fiction has evolved and expanded, it has fused with other film genres such as gothic thrillers and film noir. When science fiction integrates film noir elements, Bin Aziz calls the resulting hybrid form &quot;future noir&quot;, a form which &quot;... encapsulates a postmodern encounter with generic persistence, creating a mixture of irony, pessimism, prediction, extrapolation, bleakness and nostalgia.&quot; Future noir films such as &quot;Brazil&quot;, &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, &quot;12 Monkeys&quot;, &quot;Dark City&quot;, and &quot;Children of Men&quot; use a protagonist who is &quot;...increasingly dubious, alienated and fragmented&quot;, at once &quot;dark and playful like the characters in Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, yet still with the &quot;... shadow of Philip Marlowe...&quot;

Future noir films that are set in a post-apocalyptic world &quot;...restructure and re-represent society in a parody of the atmospheric world usually found in noir&#x27;s construction of a city—dark, bleak and beguiled.&quot; Future noir films often intermingle elements of the gothic thriller genre, such as &quot;Minority Report&quot;, which makes references to occult practices, and &quot;Alien&quot;, with its tagline &quot;In space, no one can hear you scream&quot;, and a space vessel, Nostromo, &quot;that hark[s] back to images of the haunted house in the gothic horror tradition&quot;. Bin Aziz states that films such as James Cameron’s &quot;The Terminator&quot; are a subgenre of &quot;techno noir&quot; that create &quot;...an atmospheric feast of noir darkness and a double-edged world that is not what it seems.&quot;

==Film versus literature==
When compared to science-fiction literature, science-fiction films often rely less on the human imagination and more upon action scenes and special effect-created alien creatures and exotic backgrounds. Since the 1970s, film audiences have come to expect a high standard for special effects in science-fiction films. In some cases, science fiction-themed films superimpose an exotic, futuristic setting onto what would not otherwise be a science-fiction tale. Nevertheless, some critically acclaimed science-fiction movies have followed in the path of science-fiction literature, using story development to explore abstract concepts.

===Influence of science fiction authors===
Jules Verne (1828–1905) became the first major science-fiction author whose works film-makers adapted for the screen - with Méliès&#x27; &quot;Le Voyage dans la Lune&quot; (1902) and &quot;20,000 lieues sous les mers&quot; (1907), which used Verne&#x27;s scenarios as a framework for fantastic visuals. By the time Verne&#x27;s work fell out of copyright in 1950, the adaptations were generally adapted as costume dramas with a Victorian aesthetic. Verne&#x27;s works have been adapted a number of times since then, including &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; (1954), &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; (1958), and two film versions of &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; in 1959 and 2008.

H. G. Wells&#x27;s novels &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;, &quot;Things to Come&quot; and &quot;The Island of Doctor Moreau&quot; were all adapted into films during his lifetime (1866–1946), while &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, updated in 1953 and again in 2005, was adapted to film at least four times altogether. &quot;The Time Machine&quot; has had two film versions (1960 and 2002) while &quot;Sleeper&quot; in part is a pastiche of Wells&#x27;s 1910 novel &quot;The Sleeper Awakes&quot;.

With the drop-off in interest in science-fiction films during the 1940s, few of the &quot;golden age&quot; science-fiction authors made it to the screen. A novella by John W. Campbell provided the basis for &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot; (1951). Robert A. Heinlein contributed to the screenplay for &quot;Destination Moon&quot; (1950), but none of his major works were adapted for the screen until the 1990s: &quot;The Puppet Masters&quot; (1994) and &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; (1997). The fiction of Isaac Asimov (1920–1992) influenced the &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Star Trek&quot; films, but it was not until 1988 that a film version of one of his short stories (&quot;Nightfall&quot;) was produced. The first major motion-picture adaptation of a full-length Asimov work was &quot;Bicentennial Man&quot; (1999) (based on the short stories &quot;Bicentennial Man&quot; (1976) and &quot;The Positronic Man&quot; (1992), the latter co-written with Robert Silverberg), although &quot;I, Robot&quot; (2004), a film loosely based on Asimov&#x27;s book of short stories by the same name, drew more attention.

The 1968 film adaptation of some of the stories of science-fiction author Arthur C. Clarke as &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; won the Academy Award for Visual Effects and offered thematic complexity not typically associated with the science-fiction genre at the time. Its sequel, &quot;2010: The Year We Make Contact&quot; (inspired to Clarke&#x27;s &quot;2010: Odyssey Two&quot;), was commercially successful but less highly regarded by critics. Reflecting the times, two earlier science-fiction works by Ray Bradbury were adapted for cinema in the 1960s: &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; (1966) and &quot;The Illustrated Man&quot; (1969). Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; was filmed in 1971 and &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; in 1998.

Philip K. Dick&#x27;s fiction has been used in a number of science-fiction films, in part because it evokes the paranoia that has been a central feature of the genre. Films based on Dick&#x27;s works include &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982), &quot;Total Recall&quot; (1990), &quot;Impostor&quot; (2001), &quot;Minority Report&quot; (2002), &quot;Paycheck&quot; (2003), &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot; (2006), and &quot;The Adjustment Bureau&quot; (2011). These films represent loose adaptations of the original stories, with the exception of &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot;, which is more inclined to Dick&#x27;s novel.

The estimated North American box-office market-share of science fiction comprised 4.77%.

<text>Min (; BUC: &quot;Mìng-ngṳ̄&quot;) is a broad group of Sinitic languages with about 75 million native speakers. These languages are spoken in Fujian province as well as by the descendants of Min-speaking colonists on the Leizhou Peninsula and Hainan and by the assimilated natives of Chaoshan, parts of Zhongshan, three counties in southern Wenzhou, the Zhoushan archipelago, Taiwan and scattered in pockets or sporadically across Hong Kong, Macau, and several countries in Southeast Asia, particularly Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Brunei. The name is derived from the Min River in Fujian, which is also the abbreviated name of Fujian Province. Min varieties are not mutually intelligible with one another nor with any other variety of Chinese (such as Mandarin, Cantonese, Wu, Gan, Xiang, or Hakka).

There are many Min speakers among overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. The most widely spoken variety of Min outside of mainland China is Hokkien, a variety of Southern Min which has its origin in southern Fujian. Amoy Hokkien is the prestige dialect of Hokkien in Fujian, while a majority of Taiwanese speak a dialect called Taiwanese Hokkien or simply Taiwanese. The majority of Chinese Singaporeans, Chinese Malaysians, Chinese Filipinos, Chinese Indonesians, Chinese Thais, and Chinese Cambodians are of Southern Min-speaking background (particularly Hokkien and/or Teochew), although the rise of Mandarin has led to a decline in the use of Min Chinese. Communities speaking Eastern Min, Pu-Xian Min, Haklau Min, Leizhou Min, and Hainanese can also be found in parts of the Chinese diaspora, such as in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia.

Many Min languages have retained notable features of the Old Chinese language, and there is linguistic evidence that not all Min varieties are directly descended from Middle Chinese of the Sui and Tang dynasties. The Min languages are believed to have a significant linguistic substrate from the languages of the inhabitants of the region before its sinicization.

==History==
The Min homeland of Fujian was opened to Han Chinese settlement by the defeat of the Minyue state by the armies of Emperor Wu of Han in 110 BC.
The area features rugged mountainous terrain, with short rivers that flow into the South China Sea.
Most subsequent migration from north to south China passed through the valleys of the Xiang and Gan rivers to the west, so that Min varieties have experienced less northern influence than other southern groups.
As a result, whereas most varieties of Chinese can be treated as derived from Middle Chinese—the language described by rhyme dictionaries such as the &quot;Qieyun&quot; (601 AD)—Min varieties contain traces of older distinctions.
Linguists estimate that the oldest layers of Min dialects diverged from the rest of Chinese around the time of the Han dynasty.
However, significant waves of migration from the North China Plain occurred:
* The Upheaval of the Five Barbarians during the Jin dynasty, particularly the Disaster of Yongjia in 311 AD, caused a tide of immigration to the south.
* In 669, Chen Zheng and his son Chen Yuanguang from Gushi County in Henan set up a regional administration in Fujian to suppress an insurrection by the She people.
* Wang Chao was appointed governor of Fujian in 893, near the end of the Tang dynasty, and brought tens of thousands of troops from Henan. In 909, following the fall of the Tang dynasty, his son Wang Shenzhi founded the Min Kingdom, one of the Ten Kingdoms in the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period.
Jerry Norman identifies four main layers in the vocabulary of modern Min varieties:
# A non-Chinese substratum from the original languages of Minyue, which Norman and Mei Tsu-lin believe were Austroasiatic.
# The earliest Chinese layer, brought to Fujian by settlers from Zhejiang to the north during the Han dynasty (compare Eastern Han Chinese).
# A layer from the Northern and Southern dynasties period, which is largely consistent with the phonology of the &quot;Qieyun&quot; dictionary (Early Middle Chinese).
# A literary layer based on the koiné of Chang&#x27;an, the capital of the Tang dynasty (Late Middle Chinese).
Laurent Sagart (2008) disagrees with Norman and Mei Tsu-lin&#x27;s analysis of an Austroasiatic substratum in Min. The hypothesis proposed by Jerry Norman and Mei Tsu-lin arguing for an Austroasiatic homeland along the middle Yangtze has been largely abandoned in most circles and left unsupported by the majority of Austroasiatic specialists. Rather, recent movements of analyzing archeological evidence, posit an Austronesian layer, rather than an Austroasiatic one.

==Geographic location and subgrouping==
Min is usually described as one of seven or ten groups of varieties of Chinese but has greater dialectal diversity than any of the other groups. The varieties used in neighbouring counties, and in the mountains of western Fujian even in adjacent villages, are often mutually unintelligible.

Early classifications, such as those of Li Fang-Kuei in 1937 and Yuan Jiahua in 1960, divided Min into Northern and Southern subgroups.
However, in a 1963 report on a survey of Fujian, Pan Maoding and colleagues argued that the primary split was between inland and coastal groups. A key discriminator between the two groups is a group of words that have a lateral initial in coastal varieties, and a voiceless fricative or in inland varieties, contrasting with another group having in both areas. Norman reconstructs these initials in Proto-Min as voiceless and voiced laterals that merged in coastal varieties.

===Coastal Min===
The coastal varieties have the vast majority of speakers, and have spread from their homeland in Fujian and eastern Guangdong to the islands of Taiwan and Hainan, to other coastal areas of southern China, and to Southeast Asia.
Pan and colleagues divided them into three groups:
* Eastern Min (Min Dong), centered around the city of Fuzhou, the capital of Fujian province, with Fuzhou dialect as the prestige form, also including the Fuqing dialect, etc.
** The Longdu and Nanlang dialect of Zhongshan Min in Guangdong province
* Pu-Xian Min is spoken in the city of Putian and the county of Xianyou County. Li Rulong and Chen Zhangtai examined 214 words, finding 62% shared with Quanzhou dialect (Southern Min) and 39% shared with Fuzhou dialect (Eastern Min), and concluded that Pu-Xian was more closely related to Southern Min.
* Southern Min (Min Nan) originates from the south of Fujian and the eastern corner of Guangdong. 
** In popular usage, Southern Min usually refers to dialects of the Quanzhang type, which originated in southern Fujian (around Quanzhou, Zhangzhou and Xiamen) and spread to Southeast Asia, particularly Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Brunei, Myanmar, Cambodia, Thailand, and Southern Vietnam, where they are known as Hokkien, and Taiwan, where they are known as Taiwanese. 
** The dialects of the Teoswa / Chaoshan region of eastern Guangdong, including Teochew and Swatow dialects, have difficult mutual intelligibility with the Amoy dialect of Hokkien. Teochew varieties are the most commonly spoken by Thai Chinese and Chinese Cambodians, and second-most common among Hoa Vietnamese.
** Zhenan Min of Cangnan County in southern Zhejiang is also of this type. 
** Haklau Min (Hai Lok Hong / Hailufeng) spoken in eastern Guangdong to the west of Teoswa (Chaoshan Min). 
** Datian Min of Datian County in Sanming, Fujian 
** Potentially, also the Sanxiang dialect of Zhongshan Min in Guangdong province 
The &quot;Language Atlas of China&quot; (1987) distinguished two further groups, which had previously been included in Southern Min:
* Leizhou Min, spoken on the Leizhou Peninsula in southwestern Guangdong.
* Hainanese, spoken on the island of Hainan. These dialects feature drastic changes to initial consonants, including a series of implosive consonants, that have been attributed to contact with the Tai–Kadai languages spoken on the island.
Coastal varieties feature some uniquely Min vocabulary, including pronouns and negatives.
All but the Hainan dialects have complex tone sandhi systems.

===Inland Min===
Although they have far fewer speakers, the inland varieties show much greater variation than the coastal ones.
Pan and colleagues divided the inland varieties into two groups:
* Northern Min (Min Bei) is spoken in Nanping prefecture in Fujian, with Jian&#x27;ou dialect taken as typical.
* Central Min (Min Zhong), spoken in Sanming prefecture.
The &quot;Language Atlas of China&quot; (1987) included a further group:
* Shao-Jiang Min, spoken in the northwestern Fujian counties of Shaowu and Jiangle, were classified as Hakka by Pan and his associates. However, Jerry Norman suggested that they were inland varieties of Min that had been subject to heavy Gan or Hakka influence.

Although coastal varieties can be derived from a proto-language with four series of stops or affricates at each point of articulation (e.g. , , , and ), inland varieties contain traces of two further series, which Norman termed &quot;softened stops&quot; due to their reflexes in some varieties. Inland varieties use pronouns and negatives cognate with those in Hakka and Yue. Inland varieties have little or no tone sandhi.

==Vocabulary==
Most Min vocabulary corresponds directly to cognates in other Chinese varieties, but there are also a significant number of distinctively Min words that may be traced back to proto-Min.
In some cases a semantic shift has occurred in Min or the rest of Chinese:

* *tiaŋB 鼎 &quot;wok&quot;. The Min form preserves the original meaning &quot;cooking pot&quot;, but in other Chinese varieties this word (MC &gt; &quot;dǐng&quot;) has become specialized to refer to ancient ceremonial tripods.
* *dzhənA &quot;rice field&quot;. In Min, this form has displaced the common Chinese term &quot;tián&quot; 田. Many scholars identify the Min word with &quot;chéng&quot; 塍 (MC ) &quot;raised path between fields&quot;, but Norman argues that it is cognate with &quot;céng&quot; 層 (MC &quot;dzong&quot;) &quot;additional layer or floor&quot;, reflecting the terraced fields commonly found in Fujian.
* *tšhioC 厝 &quot;house&quot;. Norman argues that the Min word is cognate with &quot;shù&quot; 戍 (MC syuH) &quot;to guard&quot;.
* *tshyiC 喙 &quot;mouth&quot;. In Min this form has displaced the common Chinese term &quot;kǒu&quot; 口. It is believed to be cognate with &quot;huì&quot; 喙 (MC &quot;xjwojH&quot;) &quot;beak, bill, snout; to pant&quot;.

Norman and Mei Tsu-lin have suggested an Austroasiatic origin for some Min words:

* *-dəŋA &quot;shaman&quot; may be compared with Vietnamese &quot;đồng&quot; (/ɗoŋ2/) &quot;to shamanize, to communicate with spirits&quot; and Mon doŋ &quot;to dance (as if) under demonic possession&quot;.
* *kiɑnB 囝 &quot;son&quot; appears to be related to Vietnamese &quot;con&quot; (/kɔn/) and Mon kon &quot;child&quot;.

However, Norman and Mei Tsu-lin&#x27;s suggestion is rejected by Laurent Sagart (2008), with some linguists arguing that the Austroasiatic predecessor of the modern Vietnamese language originated in the mountainous region in Central Laos and Vietnam, rather than in the region north of the Red River delta.

In other cases, the origin of the Min word is obscure. Such words include:
* *khauA 骹 &quot;foot&quot;
* *-tsiɑmB 䭕 &quot;insipid&quot;
* *dzyŋC 𧚔 &quot;to wear&quot;

==Writing system==

When using Chinese characters to write a non-Mandarin form, a common practice is to use characters that correspond etymologically to the words being represented, and for words with no evident etymology, to either invent new characters or borrow characters for their sound or meaning. Written Cantonese has carried this process out to the farthest extent of any non-Mandarin variety, to the extent that pure Cantonese vernacular can be unambiguously written using Chinese characters. Contrary to popular belief, a vernacular written in this fashion is not in general comprehensible to a Mandarin speaker, due to significant changes in grammar and vocabulary and the necessary use of a large number of non-Mandarin characters.

For most Min varieties, a similar process has not taken place. For Hokkien, competing systems exist. Given that Min combines the Chinese of several different periods and contains some non-Chinese substrate vocabulary, an author literate in Mandarin (or even Classical Chinese) may have trouble finding the appropriate Chinese characters for some Min vocabulary. In the case of Taiwanese, there are also indigenous words borrowed from Formosan languages (particularly for place names), as well as a substantial number of loan words from Japanese. The Min (Hokkien, Teochew, Hainanese, Luichow, Hinghwa, Hokchew, Hokchia, Haklau / Hai Lok Hong) spoken in Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia has borrowed heavily from Malay (or Indonesian for Indonesia) and, to a lesser extent, from Singaporean or Malaysian English and other languages. Meanwhile, the Hokkien spoken in the Philippines has also borrowed a few terms from Spanish, Tagalog (Filipino), and English over the recent centuries. In Kelantan Peranakan Hokkien, spoken in Kelantan state of Malaysia to Pattani province of Thailand, a mix of Southern Thai and Kelantan Malay is also used with the local Kelantan Hokkien of Peranakans and Chinese Malaysians in Northern Malaya. The result is that adapting Chinese characters to write Min requires a substantial effort to choose characters for a significant portion of the vocabulary.

Other approaches to writing Min rely on romanization or phonetic systems such as Taiwanese Phonetic Symbols or historically during Japanese rule over Taiwan, Taiwanese kana was also used for Taiwanese Hokkien in some Taiwanese-Japanese dictionaries made during that time. Since 1987, Taiwanese Hangul also exists for Taiwanese Hokkien. Some Min speakers use the Church Romanization (). For Hokkien the romanization is called Pe̍h-ōe-jī (POJ). For Fuzhounese it is called Foochow Romanized (&quot;Bàng-uâ-cê&quot;, BUC). For the Putian dialect it is called Hinghwa Romanized (&quot;Hing-hua̍ Báⁿ-uā-ci̍&quot;). For the Jian&#x27;ou dialect it is called Kienning Colloquial Romanized &quot;(Gṳ̿ing-nǎing Lô̤-mǎ-cī&quot;). For Hainanese it is called Bǽh-oe-tu (BOT). These systems were developed by British, Irish, Danish, and American Protestant Christian missionaries over the course of the 19th century. In 2006, Tâi-lô (&quot;Tâi-uân Lô-má-jī Phing-im Hong-àn&quot;) which was derived from Pe̍h-ōe-jī (POJ) was officially promoted by Taiwan&#x27;s Ministry of Education (MOE). Some publications use mixed writing, with mostly Chinese characters but using the Latin alphabet to represent words that cannot easily be represented by Chinese characters. In Taiwan, a mix of Chinese characters and Latin letters written in Pe̍h-ōe-jī (POJ) or Tâi-lô has recently been practised. In Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Indonesia, some also occasionally write Hokkien and/or Teochew using Latin letters via ad-hoc means using the writer&#x27;s knowledge of the local mainstream orthography they grew up being literate in, such as Singaporean or Malaysian English orthography (descended from British English), Malay orthography / Indonesian orthography, Mandarin Pinyin for those in Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia, then Philippine English orthography (descended from American English), Filipino orthography, Mandarin Pinyin, and sometimes Spanish orthography (for older writings), for those in the Philippines.

<text>The Hitachi H8 is a large family of 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers made by Renesas Technology, originating in the early 1990s within Hitachi Semiconductor. The original design, the H8/300, was an 8-bit processor that had a 16-bit registers and ALU that allowed some 16-bit operations. Two upgraded versions were introduced, the H8/300L that expanded the instructions to become a full 16-bit machine while being optimized for low cost, and the H8/300H which further expanded the registers to allow 32-bit operations and was optimized for low-power/high-performance roles. Many variations exist.

The entire line was sold to Renesas in 2003. Renesas continues to sell the designs , but only to existing customers. An administrator on the Renesas user community boards commented in 2011 that there are no plans for further development of H8 based products. H8 was supported in the Linux kernel starting with version 4.2 but support was removed in version 5.19.

For higher performance needs, Hitachi introduced its SuperH family of 32-bit RISC-like microcontrollers, which have largely replaced the H8.

==Variants==
Subfamilies include the 8/16-bit H8/300 and H8/500, the 16/32-bit H8/300H and H8S and the 32-bit H8SX series, each with dozens of different variants, varying by speed, selection of built-in peripherals such as timers, interrupts and serial ports, and amounts of ROM, flash memory and RAM. Built-in ROM and flash memory tends to range from 16 KB to 1024 KB, and RAM from 512 B to 512 KB.

The basic architecture of the H8 is patterned after the DEC PDP-11 architecture, with eight 16-bit registers (the H8/300H and H8S have an additional bank of eight 16-bit registers), and a variety of addressing modes. Unlike the PDP-11 however, the H8 architecture employs big-endian byte ordering.

Both H8/300H and H8S have eight 32-bit registers, each of which can be treated as one 32-bit register, two 16-bit registers, or two 8-bit registers, with the H8S having an internal 32-bit configuration. Several companies provide compilers for the H8 family, and there is a complete GCC port, including a simulator. There are also various hardware emulators available.

The family is continued with the H8SX 32-bit controllers.

==Applications==

H8S may be found in digital cameras, the Cybiko handheld computers, some ThinkPad notebooks, printer controllers, smart cards, chess computers, music synthesizers such as the Yamaha FS1R, Roland SC-55 and Roland JV880 and in various automotive subsystems. The LEGO Mindstorms RCX, an advanced robot toy/educational tool, uses the H8/300. An H8/3002 was used as a sound processor by Namco for various games it made in the late 1990s, notably those using its System 12 architecture and by Yamaha for the DB50XG and DB60XG daughterboards and the SW60XG ISA bus sound card.

H8/500 was being also used on a Nokia 2110 phone.

<doc id="179765" wikidata="Q131287" url="?curid=179765" title="Nara Prefecture">
<text>is a prefecture of Japan located in the Kansai region of Honshu. Nara Prefecture has a population of 1,321,805 and has a geographic area of . Nara Prefecture borders Kyoto Prefecture to the north, Osaka Prefecture to the northwest, Wakayama Prefecture to the southwest, and Mie Prefecture to the east.

Nara is the capital and largest city of Nara Prefecture, with other major cities including Kashihara, Ikoma, and Yamatokōriyama. Nara Prefecture is located in the center of the Kii Peninsula on Japan&#x27;s Pacific Ocean coast, and is one of only eight landlocked prefectures. Nara Prefecture has the distinction of having more UNESCO World Heritage listings than any other prefecture in Japan.

==History==

Nara Prefecture region is considered one of the oldest regions in Japan, having been in existence for thousands of years, and is widely viewed as the Japanese cradle of civilization. Like Kyoto, Nara was one of Imperial Japan&#x27;s earliest capital cities. The current form of Nara Prefecture was officially created in 1887 when it became independent of Osaka Prefecture.

Historically, Nara Prefecture was also known as Yamato-no-kuni or Yamato Province.

===Up to Nara period===
From the third century to the fourth century, a poorly documented political force existed at the foot of Mount Miwa, east of Nara Basin. It sought unification of most parts in Japan. Since the historical beginning of Japan, Yamato was its political center.

Ancient capitals of Japan were built on the land of Nara, namely Asuka-kyō, Fujiwara-kyō (694–710) and Heijō-kyō (most of 710–784). The capital cities of Fujiwara and Heijō are believed to have been modeled after Chinese capitals at the time, incorporating grid layout patterns. The royal court also established relations with Sui and then Tang dynasty China and sent students to the Middle Kingdom to learn high civilization. By 7th century, Nara accepted the many immigrants including refugees of Baekje who had escaped from war disturbances of the southern part of the Korean Peninsula. The first high civilization with royal patronage of Buddhism flourished in today&#x27;s Nara city (710–784 AD).

===Nara in the Heian period===
In 784, Emperor Kanmu decided to relocate the capital to Nagaoka-kyō in Yamashiro Province, followed by another move in 794 to Heian-kyō, marking the start of the Heian period. The temples in Nara remained powerful beyond the move of political capital, thus giving Nara a synonym of &quot;Nanto&quot; (meaning &quot;South Capital&quot;) as opposed to Heian-kyō, situated in the north. Close to the end of Heian period, Taira no Shigehira, a son of Taira no Kiyomori, was ordered by his father to depress the power of various parties, mainly Kōfuku-ji and Tōdai-ji, who were backing up an opposition group headed by Prince Mochihito. The movement led to a collision between the Taira and the Nara temples in 1180. This clash eventually led to Kōfuku-ji and Tōdai-ji being set on fire, resulting in vast destruction of architectural heritage.

===Medieval Nara===
At the rise of the Minamoto to its ruling seat and the opening of Kamakura shogunate, Nara enjoyed the support of Minamoto no Yoritomo toward restoration. Kōfuku-ji, being the &quot;home temple&quot; to the Fujiwara since its foundation, not only regained the power it had before but became a &quot;de facto&quot; regional chief of Yamato Province. With the reconstruction of Kōfuku-ji and Tōdai-ji, a town was growing again near the two temples.

The Nanboku-chō period, starting in 1336, brought more instability to Nara. As Emperor Go-Daigo chose Yoshino as his base, a power struggle arose in Kōfuku-ji with a group supporting the South and another siding the North court. Likewise, local clans were split into two. Kōfuku-ji recovered its control over the province for a short time at the surrender of the South Court in 1392, while the internal power game of the temple itself opened a way for the local samurai clans to spring up and fight with each other, gradually acquiring their own territories, thus diminishing the influence of Kōfuku-ji overall.

===The Sengoku and Edo periods ===
Later, the whole province of Yamato got drawn into the confusion of the Sengoku period. Tōdai-ji was once again set on fire in 1567, when Matsunaga Hisahide, who was later appointed by Oda Nobunaga to the lord of Yamato Province, fought for supremacy against his former master Miyoshi family. Followed by short appointments of Tsutsui Junkei and Toyotomi Hidenaga by Toyotomi Hideyoshi to the lord, the Tokugawa shogunate ultimately ruled the city of Nara directly, and most parts of Yamato province with a few feudal lords allocated at Kōriyama, Takatori and other places. With industry and commerce developing in the 18th century, the economy of the province was incorporated into prosperous Osaka, the commercial capital of Japan at the time.

=== From the establishment of Nara Prefecture to the present===
A first prefecture (briefly &quot;-fu&quot; in 1868, but &quot;-ken&quot; for most of the time) named Nara was established in the Meiji Restoration in 1868 as successor to the shogunate administration of the shogunate city and shogunate lands in Yamato. After the 1871 Abolition of the han system, Nara was merged with other prefectures (from former han, see List of Han#Yamato Province) and cleared of ex-/enclaves to encompass all of Yamato province. In 1876, Nara was merged into Sakai which in turn became part of Osaka in 1881. In 1887, Nara became independent again, with Saisho Atsushi as the first governor. The first prefectural assembly of Nara was elected in the same year and opened its first session in 1888 in the gallery of the main hall of Tōdai temple.

In the 1889 Great Meiji mergers which subdivided all (then 45) prefectures into modern municipalities, Nara prefecture&#x27;s 16 districts were subdivided into 154 municipalities: 10 towns and 144 villages. The first city in Nara was only established in 1898 when Nara Town from Soekami District was made district-independent to become Nara City (see List of mergers in Nara Prefecture and List of mergers in Osaka Prefecture).

The economic dependency to Osaka even characterizes today&#x27;s Nara Prefecture, for many inhabitants commute to Osaka to work or study there.

==Geography==

Nara Prefecture is part of the Kansai, or Kinki, region of Japan, and is located in the middle of the Kii Peninsula on the western half of Honshu. Nara Prefecture is landlocked. It is bordered to the west by Wakayama Prefecture and Osaka Prefecture; on the north by Kyoto Prefecture and on the east by Mie Prefecture.

Nara Prefecture is from east to west and from north to south.

Most of the prefecture is covered by mountains and forests, leaving an inhabitable area of only . The ratio of inhabitable area to total area is 23%, ranked 43rd among the 47 prefectures in Japan.

Nara Prefecture is bisected by the Japan Median Tectonic Line (MTL) running through its territory east to west, along the Yoshino River. On the northern side of the MTL is the so-called Inner Zone, where active faults running north to south are still shaping the landscape. The Ikoma Mountains in the northwest form the border with Osaka Prefecture. The Nara Basin, which lies to the east of these mountains, contains the highest concentration of population in Nara Prefecture. Further east are the Kasagi Mountains, which separate the Basin from the Yamato Highlands.

South of the MTL is the Outer Zone, comprising the Kii Mountains, which occupy about 60% of the land area of the prefecture. The Ōmine Range is in the center of the Kii Mountains, running north to south, with steep valleys on both sides. The tallest mountain in Nara Prefecture, and indeed in the Kansai region, is Mount Hakkyō. To the west, separating Nara Prefecture from Wakayama Prefecture, is the Obako Range, with peaks around . To the east, bordering Mie Prefecture, is the Daikō Range, including Mount Ōdaigahara. This mountainous region is also home to a World Heritage Site, the Sacred Sites and Pilgrimage Routes in the Kii Mountain Range&quot;.

About 17% of the total land area of the prefecture is designated as National Park land, comprising the Yoshino-Kumano National Park, Kongō-Ikoma-Kisen, Kōya-Ryūjin, Murō-Akame-Aoyama, and Yamato-Aogaki Quasi-National Parks; and the Tsukigase-Kōnoyama, Yata, and Yoshinogawa-Tsuboro Prefectural Natural Parks.

===Climate===
In the Nara Basin, the climate has inland characteristics, as represented in the bigger temperature variance within the same day, and the difference of summer and winter temperatures. Winter temperatures average about , and in the summer with highest reaching close to . There is not a single year over the last decade (since 1990, up to 2007) with more than 10 days of snowfall recorded by Nara Local Meteorological Observatory.

The climate in the rest of the prefecture are mountainous, and especially in the south, with below being the extreme minimum in winter. Heavy rainfall is observed in summer. The annual accumulated rainfall ranges as much as , which is among the heaviest in Japan.

Spring and fall are temperate. The mountainous region of Yoshino has been popular both historically and presently for its cherry blossoms in the spring. In the fall, the southern mountains are equally striking with the changing of the oak trees.

===Municipalities===

Since 2006, there are 39 municipalities in Nara Prefecture: twelve [by definition: district-independent] cities and seven remaining districts containing 15 towns and twelve villages:

Kansai Science City is located in the northwest.

==Demographics==

According to the 2005 Census of Japan, Nara Prefecture has a population of 1,421,310, which is a decrease of 1.5%, since the year 2000.

The decline continued in 2006, with another decrease of 4,987 people compared to 2005. This includes a natural decrease from previous year of 288 people (11,404 births minus 11,692 deaths) and a decrease due to net domestic migration of 4,627 people outbound from the prefecture, and a decrease of 72 registered foreigners. Net domestic migration has turned into a continuous outbound trend since 1998. The largest destinations of migration in 2005 were the prefectures of Kyoto, Tokyo, and Hyōgo, with respectively a net of 1,130,982 and 451 people moving over. The largest inbound migration was from Niigata Prefecture, contributing to a net increase of 39 people. 13.7% of its population were reported as under 15, 65.9% between 15 and 64, and 20.4% were 65 or older. Females made up approximately 52.5% of the population.

As of 2004, the average density of the prefecture is 387 people per km2. By districts, the Yamato flat inland plain holds as much as about 90% of total population within the approximately 23% size of area in the north-west, including the Nara
Basin, representing a density of 1,531 people per km2. To the contrast, the combined district Gojō and Yoshino District occupies almost 64% of the land, while only 6% of people lives there, resulting in a density of 39 people km2.

Nara prefecture had the highest rate in Japan of people commuting outbound for work, at 30.9% in 2000. A similar tendency is seen in prefectures such as Saitama, Chiba, and Kanagawa, all three of them having over 20% of people commuting for other prefectures.

==Politics==
* A governor and members of prefectural assembly is elected by citizens in accordance with the Local Autonomy Law.
* Shōgo Arai was governor between 2007 and 2023, a former LDP member of the national House of Councillors. In the April 2019 gubernatorial election, he was re-elected to a fourth term with major party support (LDP, DPFP, Kōmeitō) with 47.5% of the vote against former Democratic Diet member and vice-minister Kiyoshige Maekawa (32.3%) and independent physician Minoru Kawashima (20.2%).
* In 2023, Makoto Yamashita was elected governor. This was the first time Nippon Ishi gained a governor outside of Osaka.
* As of 2019, there are 43 seats in the Nara Prefectural Assembly, elected in 16 constituencies (4 single-member, 12 multi-member). After the April 2019 assembly election, the LDP is by far the largest party with 21 members while no other party won more than four seats, but its members are split between several parliamentary groups; by group, the composition as of May 2019 was: LDP 10, LDP Nara 9, Sōsei Nara [of independents] 5, Shinsei Nara [mainly DPFP] 5, JCP 4, Nippon Ishin no Kai 4, Kōmeitō 3, LDP Kizuna 2.
* There was a clear tendency seen through the results of Lower House election in 2005, that the younger generation executes its voting right much less compared to the older. Only 48.8% of citizens age 20–29 voted, whereas all older generations (grouped by decades) votes more than its younger, reaching the highest voting rate of 86.3% at ages 60–69. The only exception was the 72.1% voting right executed by citizens of 70 or older. The overall average of the prefecture who voted was yet higher, at 70.3%, than that of nationwide average, 67.5%.
* As of October 2019, Nara&#x27;s directly elected delegation to the National Diet is all-LDP, namely:
** in the House of Representatives where Nara has lost one district in a 2017 reapportionment
*** for the 1st district in the North consisting of most of Nara City and Ikoma City: Shigeki Kobayashi (LDP, 2nd term) who narrowly defeated long-time incumbent Sumio Mabuchi in the 2017 House of Representatives election,
*** for the 2nd district with southern suburbs (and a small part) of the capital: Sanae Takaichi (LDP, 8th term) who has served as minister in several cabinets and was re-elected with 60% of the vote in 2017,
*** for the 3rd district which covers the less urbanized, central and Southern parts of Nara: Taidō Tanose (LDP, 3rd term), member for the now-abolished 4th district before 2017,
** in the House of Councillors where the Nara district is one of the often decisive FPTP single-member districts
*** in the 2016–2022 class: Kei Satō (LDP, 1st term) who defeated incumbent Kiyoshige Maekawa in 2016 by a twelve-point-margin in a three-way contest with an Osaka Ishin no Kai challenger,
*** in the 2019–2025 class: Iwao Horii (LDP, 2nd term) who defended the seat 55% to 40% against an &quot;independent&quot;, joint centre-left (CDP, DPFP, SDP) challenger in 2019.

<doc id="179770" wikidata="Q120730" url="?curid=179770" title="Kyoto Prefecture">
<text>is a prefecture of Japan located in the Kansai region of Honshu. Kyoto Prefecture has a population of 2,561,358 () and has a geographic area of . Kyoto Prefecture borders Fukui Prefecture to the northeast, Shiga Prefecture to the east, Mie Prefecture to the southeast, Nara Prefecture and Osaka Prefecture to the south, and Hyōgo Prefecture to the west.

Kyoto, the capital and largest city, accommodates 57% of the prefecture&#x27;s total population, with other major cities including Uji, Kameoka, and Maizuru. Kyoto Prefecture is located on the Sea of Japan coast and extends to the southeast towards the Kii Peninsula, covering territory of the former provinces of Yamashiro, Tamba, and Tango. Kyoto Prefecture is centered on the historic Imperial capital of Kyoto, and is one of Japan&#x27;s two &quot;prefectures&quot; using the designation &quot;fu&quot; rather than the standard &quot;ken&quot; for prefectures. Kyoto has made Kyoto Prefecture one of the most popular tourism destinations in Japan for national and international tourists, and 21% of the prefecture&#x27;s land area was designated as Natural Parks. Kyoto Prefecture forms part of the Keihanshin metropolitan area, the second-most-populated region in Japan after the Greater Tokyo area and one of the world&#x27;s most productive regions by GDP.

== History ==

Until the Meiji Restoration, the area of Kyoto Prefecture was known as Yamashiro.

For most of its history, the city of Kyoto was Japan&#x27;s Imperial capital. The city&#x27;s history can be traced back as far as the 6th century. In 544, the Aoi Matsuri was held in Kyoto to pray for good harvest and good weather.

Kyoto did not start out as Japan&#x27;s capital. A noteworthy earlier capital was Nara. In 741, Emperor Shōmu moved the capital briefly to Kuni-kyo, between the cities of Nara and Kyoto, in present-day Kyoto Prefecture. In 784, the capital was moved to Nagaokakyō, also in present-day Kyoto Prefecture. In 794, Emperor Kanmu moved the capital to Heian-kyō, and this was the beginning of the current-day city of Kyoto. Even today, almost all of the streets, houses, stores, temples and shrines in Kyoto exist where they were placed in this year.

Although in 1192 real political power shifted to Kamakura, where a samurai clan established the shogunate, Kyoto remained the imperial capital as the powerless emperors and their court continued to be seated in the city. Imperial rule was briefly restored in 1333, but another samurai clan established a new shogunate in Kyoto three years later.

In 1467, a great civil war, the Ōnin War, took place inside Kyoto, and most of the town was burned down. Japan plunged into the age of warring feudal lords. A new strong man, Tokugawa Ieyasu, established the shogunate at Edo (today&#x27;s Tokyo) in 1603.

In the 15th century AD, tea-jars were brought by the &quot;shōguns&quot; to Uji in Kyoto from the Philippines which was used in the Japanese tea ceremony.

The Meiji Restoration returned Japan to imperial rule in 1868. Emperor Meiji, who was now the absolute sovereign, went to stay in Tokyo during the next year. The imperial court has not returned to Kyoto since then. During the instigation of Fuhanken Sanchisei in 1868, the prefecture received its suffix &quot;fu&quot;. The subsequent reorganization of the old provincial system merged the former Tango Province, Yamashiro Province and the eastern part of Tanba Province into today&#x27;s Kyoto Prefecture.

Although many Japanese major cities were heavily bombed during World War II, the old capital escaped such devastation. During the occupation, the U.S. Sixth Army and I Corps were headquartered in Kyoto.

== Geography ==
Kyoto Prefecture is almost in the center of Honshu and of Japan. It covers an area of , which is 1.2% of Japan. Kyoto is the 31st largest prefecture by size. To the north, it faces the Sea of Japan and Fukui Prefecture. To the south, it faces Osaka and Nara Prefectures. To the east, it faces Mie and Shiga Prefectures. To its west is Hyōgo Prefecture. The prefecture is separated in the middle by the Tanba Mountains. This makes its climate very different in the north and south.

 21% of the prefecture&#x27;s land area was designated as Natural Parks, namely Sanin Kaigan National Park; Biwako, Kyoto Tamba Kogen, Tango-Amanohashidate-Ōeyama and Wakasa Wan Quasi-National Parks; and Hozukyō, Kasagiyama, and Rurikei Prefectural Natural Parks.

At least initially, its primary sensor will be a mobile X-band radar used to gather data on ballistic missile launches which will then be relayed by the station to warships equipped with Aegis air defense systems and to ground-based interceptor missile sites. A hundred and sixty personnel will be based at the station.

<doc id="179772" wikidata="Q128196" url="?curid=179772" title="Mie Prefecture">
<text>is a prefecture of Japan located in the Kansai region of Honshu. Mie Prefecture has a population of 1,781,948 () and has a geographic area of . Mie Prefecture is bordered by Gifu Prefecture to the north, Shiga Prefecture and Kyoto Prefecture to the northwest, Nara Prefecture to the west, Wakayama Prefecture to the southwest, and Aichi Prefecture to the east.

Tsu is the capital and Yokkaichi is the largest city of Mie Prefecture, with other major cities including Suzuka, Matsusaka, Ise, and Kuwana. Mie Prefecture is located on the eastern coast of the Kii Peninsula, forming the western side of Ise Bay which features the mouths of the Kiso Three Rivers. Mie Prefecture is a popular tourism destination home to Nagashima Spa Land, Suzuka International Racing Course, and some of the oldest and holiest sites in Shinto, the traditional religion of Japan, including the Ise Grand Shrine and the Tsubaki Grand Shrine.

== History ==
Until the Meiji Restoration, the area that is now Mie Prefecture was made up of Ise Province, Shima Province, Iga Province, and part of Kii Province.

Evidence of human habitation in Mie dates back more than 10,000 years. During the Jōmon and Yayoi periods, agricultural communities began to form along the river and coastal areas of the region. Ise Shrine is said to have been established during the Yayoi period, and in the 7th century the Saikū Imperial Residence was built in what is now Meiwa Town to serve as both a residence and administrative centre for the Saiō, an Imperial Princess who served as High Priestess of Ise Shrine.

During the Edo period, the area now known as Mie Prefecture consisted of several feudal domains, each ruled by an appointed lord. Transport networks, including the Tokaido and Ise Roads, were built. Port towns such as Ohminato, Kuwana and Anōtsu, posting stations and castle towns flourished. Pilgrimages to Ise Shrine also became very popular.

After the Meiji Restoration, the former provinces of Ise, Shima and Iga as well as a portion of eastern Kii, were organized and reorganized repeatedly. In 1871, the area from the Kiso Three Rivers in the north to present-day Tsu became Anōtsu Prefecture, and the area south of that became Watarai Prefecture. In 1872, the Anōtsu prefectural seat moved from Tsu to Yokkaichi, and the prefecture itself was renamed Mie. For a variety of reasons, including the strong likelihood that Mie would eventually merge with Watarai, the prefectural seat returned to Tsu the following year, and Mie Prefecture took its present-day form in 1876, when it merged with its southern neighbor.

The name Mie supposedly was taken from a comment about the region made by Yamato Takeru on his way back from conquering the eastern regions.

In 1959, many people died as parts of Mie were devastated by the Ise-wan Typhoon, the strongest typhoon to hit Japan in recorded history. Crops were destroyed, sea walls ruined, roads and railways damaged and a substantial number of people were injured or left homeless.

In May 2016, the city of Shima hosted the 42nd G7 summit, the third summit without the presence of Russia.

== Geography ==

Mie Prefecture forms the eastern part of the Kii Peninsula, and borders on Aichi, Gifu, Shiga, Kyoto, Nara, and Wakayama. It is considered part of the Kansai and Tōkai regions due to its geographical proximity to Aichi Prefecture and its cultural influence from Kansai, such as the fact that Kansai dialect is spoken in Mie. Traditionally, though, the Iga region of Mie is considered to have always been a part of Kansai.

Mie Prefecture measures from north to south, and from east to west, and includes five distinct geographical areas:

# the north-west of Mie consists of the Suzuka Mountains
# along the coast of Ise Bay from the Aichi border to Ise City lies the Ise Plain, where most of the population of Mie live
# south of the Ise Plain is the Shima Peninsula
# bordering Nara in the central-west is the Iga Basin
# running from central Mie to its southern borders is the Nunobiki Mountainous Region.



Mie has a coastline that stretches and, as of 2000, Mie&#x27;s landmass is 64.8 percent forest, 11.5 percent agriculture, 6 percent residential area, 3.8 percent roads, and 3.6 percent rivers. The remaining 10.3 percent are not classified.

The Ise Plain has a relatively moderate climate, averaging for the year. The Iga Basin has more daily temperature variance and averages temperatures 1 to 2 degrees cooler than the Ise Plain. Southern Mie, south of the Shima Peninsula, has a warmer Pacific marine climate, with Owase Region having one of the heaviest rainfall figures for all of Japan.

 36% of the total area of the prefecture comprised designated Natural Parks, namely:

* Akame Ichishikyō Prefectural Natural Park
* Ise-no-Umi Prefectural Natural Park
* Ise-Shima National Park
* Kahadakyō Prefectural Natural Park
* Murō-Akame-Aoyama Quasi-National Park
* Okuise Miyagawakyō Prefectural Natural Park
* Suigō Prefectural Natural Park
* Suzuka Quasi-National Park
* Yoshino-Kumano National Park

=== Municipalities ===

Since 2006, Mie consists of 29 municipalities: 14 cities and 15 towns.
=== Mergers ===
When the modern municipalities were introduced in 1889, Mie initially consisted of 336 municipalities: 1 (by definition: district-level) city and 21 districts with 18 towns and 317 villages. With the Great Shōwa mergers of the 1950s, the number of municipalities in Mie had dropped to 88 by 1956. The Great Heisei mergers of the 2000s reduced the total from 69 to 29 between 2000 and 2006.

== Economy ==
Mie Prefecture has traditionally been a link between east and west Japan, thanks largely to the Tokaido and Ise Pilgrimage Roads. Traditional handicrafts such as Iga Braid, Yokkaichi Banko Pottery, Suzuka Ink, Iga Pottery and Ise Katagami flourished. With 65% of the prefecture consisting of forests and with over of coastline, Mie has a long been associated with forestry and seafood industries. Mie also produces tea, beef, cultured pearls and fruit, mainly mandarin oranges. Food production companies include Azuma Foods.

Northern Mie is home to a number of manufacturing industries, mainly transport machinery manufacturing (vehicles and ships) and heavy chemical industries such as oil refineries. As well as this, Mie Prefecture is expanding into more advanced industries including the manufacture of semiconductors and liquid crystal displays. In Suzuka, the Honda Motor Company maintains a factory established in 1960 that built the Honda Civic, as well as other vehicles.

== Government and politics ==

The prefectural government was briefly moved to Yokkaichi Town in Mie District in 1872 (hence the name Mie), but the capital moved back to Anotsu, Anō District (present-day Tsu City) in 1873 and has remained there since. Ignoring small changes through cross-prefectural municipal mergers, neighbourhood transfers and coastline variations, Mie reached its present borders in 1876 when it absorbed Watarai Prefecture. After the modern reactivation of districts in 1878/79, Mie consisted of 21 districts (merged down to 15 in the 1890s). The first prefectural assembly was elected in March 1879 and convened in April. In the introduction of modern cities, towns and villages in 1889, Anotsu became district-independent as Tsu City and the districts were subdivided into 18 towns and 317 villages (see the List of mergers in Mie Prefecture for changes since then).

As in all prefectures except Okinawa, the governor of Mie is directly elected since 1947. The prefectural assembly has 51 members. Both prefectural elections in Mie are currently held as part of unified local elections. In the last round in 2019, governor Eikei Suzuki easily won a third term with broad support from LDP, &quot;Shinsei Mie&quot; (see below) and Kōmeitō, against only one, JCP-supported challenger; Suzuki was originally elected narrowly in 2011 as centre-right candidate against centre-left supported Naohisa Matsuda, former mayor of Tsu City. In the Mie assembly, the LDP is strongest party; but it is distributed across several parliamentary groups, and the strongest group is &quot;Shisei Mie&quot; (新政みえ; &quot;Renewal Mie&quot;) around members of several local parties of former Democrats.

In the National Diet, Mie is represented by four directly elected members of the House of Representatives and two (one per class) in the House of Councillors. After the national elections of 2016, 2017 and 2019, Mie&#x27;s directly elected delegation was evenly split between Liberal Democrats (HR district #1: Norihisa Tamura, #4: Noriyo Mitsuya, HC 2019–25 class: Yūmi Yoshikawa) and ex-Democrats (HR #2: Masaharu Nakagawa, #3: Katsuya Okada, HC 2016–22 class: Hirokazu Shiba) in both houses of the Diet.

<doc id="179773" wikidata="Q131358" url="?curid=179773" title="Shiga Prefecture">
<text>is a landlocked prefecture of Japan located in the Kansai region of Honshu. Shiga Prefecture has a population of 1,412,916 as of 1 October 2015 and has a geographic area of . Shiga Prefecture borders Fukui Prefecture to the north, Gifu Prefecture to the northeast, Mie Prefecture to the southeast, and Kyoto Prefecture to the west.

Ōtsu is the capital and largest city of Shiga Prefecture, with other major cities including Kusatsu, Nagahama, and Higashiōmi. Shiga Prefecture encircles Lake Biwa, the largest freshwater lake in Japan, and 37% of the total land area is designated as Natural Parks, the highest of any prefecture. Shiga Prefecture&#x27;s southern half is located adjacent to the former capital city of Kyoto and forms part of Greater Kyoto, the fourth-largest metropolitan area in Japan. Shiga Prefecture is home to Ōmi beef, the Eight Views of Ōmi, and Hikone Castle, one of four national treasure castles in Japan.

== History ==

Shiga was known as Ōmi Province or Gōshū before the prefectural system was established. Omi was a neighbor of Nara and Kyoto, at the junction of western and eastern Japan. During the period 667 to 672, Emperor Tenji founded a palace in Otsu. In 742, Emperor Shōmu founded a palace in Shigaraki. In the early Heian period, Saichō was born in the north of Otsu and founded Enryaku-ji, the center of Tendai and a UNESCO World Heritage Site and monument of Ancient Kyoto now.

During the Heian period, the Sasaki clan ruled Omi, and afterward, the Rokkaku clan, Kyōgoku clan, and Azai clans ruled Omi. While during the Azuchi-Momoyama period, Oda Nobunaga subjugated Omi and built Azuchi Castle on the eastern shores of Lake Biwa in 1579. Tōdō Takatora, Gamō Ujisato, Oichi, Yodo-dono, Ohatsu, and Oeyo were Omi notables during this period.

In 1600, Ishida Mitsunari, born in the east of Nagahama and based in Sawayama Castle, made war against Tokugawa Ieyasu in Sekigahara, Gifu. After the battle, Ieyasu made Ii Naomasa a new lord of Sawayama. Naomasa established the Hikone Domain, later famous for Ii Naosuke. Ii Naosuke became the Tokugawa shogunate&#x27;s Tairō and concluded commercial treaties with the Western powers and thus ended Japan&#x27;s isolation from the world in the 19th century. Besides the Hikone Domain, many domains ruled Omi such as Zeze.

With the abolition of the han system, eight prefectures were formed in Omi. They were unified into Shiga Prefecture in September 1872. &quot;Shiga Prefecture&quot; was named after &quot;Shiga District&quot; because Otsu belonged to the district until 1898. From August 1876 to February 1881, southern Fukui Prefecture had been incorporated into Shiga Prefecture.

In 2015, Shiga Governor Taizō Mikazuki conducted a survey asking citizens whether they felt it necessary to change the name of the prefecture, partly to raise its profile as a destination for domestic tourism.

== Geography ==
Shiga borders Fukui Prefecture in the north, Gifu Prefecture in the east, Mie Prefecture in the southeast, and Kyoto Prefecture in the west.

Lake Biwa, Japan&#x27;s largest, is located at the center of this prefecture. It occupies one-sixth of its area. The Seta River flows from Lake Biwa to Osaka Bay through Kyoto. This is the only natural river that flows out from the lake. Most other natural rivers flow into the lake. There were many lagoons around Lake Biwa, but most of them were reclaimed in 1940s. One of the preserved lagoons is the in Omihachiman, and it was selected as the first Important Cultural Landscapes in 2006.

The lake divides the prefecture into four different areas: &quot;Kohoku&quot; (湖北, north of lake) centered Nagahama, &quot;Kosei&quot; (湖西, west of lake) centered Imazu, &quot;Kotō&quot; (湖東, east of lake) centered Hikone and &quot;Konan&quot; (湖南, south of lake) centered Otsu.

Plains stretch to the eastern shore of Lake Biwa. The prefecture is enclosed by mountain ranges with the Hira Mountains and Mount Hiei in the west, the Ibuki Mountains in the northeast, and the Suzuka Mountains in the southeast. Mount Ibuki is the highest mountain in Shiga. In Yogo, a small lake is famous for the legend of , which is similar to a western Swan maiden.

Shiga&#x27;s climate sharply varies between north and south. Southern Shiga is usually warm, but northern Shiga is typically cold with high snowfall and hosts many skiing grounds. In Nakanokawachi, the northernmost village of Shiga, snow reached a depth of in 1936.

As of 1 April 2014, 37% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks (the highest total of any prefecture), namely the Biwako and Suzuka Quasi-National Parks; and Kotō, Kutsuki-Katsuragawa, and Mikami-Tanakami-Shigaraki Prefectural Natural Parks.

== Politics ==

The current governor of Shiga is Taizō Mikazuki, a former member of the House of Representatives from Shiga (DPJ, 3rd district), who was narrowly elected in July 2014 with center-left support against ex-METI-bureaucrat Takashi Koyari (supported by the center-right national-level ruling parties) to succeed governor Yukiko Kada. In June 2018, he was overwhelmingly reelected to a second term against only one, Communist challenger.

The prefectural assembly has 44 members from 16 electoral districts, and is still elected in unified local elections (last round: 2019). As of July 2019, the assembly was composed by caucus as follows: LDP 20 members, Team Shiga (CDP, DPP, former Kada supporters etc.) 14, JCP 4, Sazanami Club (of independents) 3, Kōmeitō 2, &quot;independent&quot;/non-attached 1.

In the National Diet, Shiga is represented by four directly elected members of the House of Representatives and two (one per ordinary election) of the House of Councillors. For the proportional representation segment of the lower house, the prefecture forms part of the Kinki block. After the national elections of 2016, 2017 and 2019, the directly elected delegation to the Diet from Shiga consists of (as of August 1, 2019):
* in the House of Representatives

** for the 2nd district in the northeast: Ken&#x27;ichirō Ueno, LDP, 4th term,
** for the 3rd district on the southern shores of Lake Biwa: Nobuhide Takemura, LDP, 3rd term,
** for the 4th district in the southeast: Hiroo Kotera, LDP, 1st term,
* in the House of Councillors (Shiga At-large district)

** in the class of 2019 (term ends 2025): Yukiko Kada, independent sitting with the Hekisuikai caucus, 1st term.

== Economy ==
Cultivated areas occupy nearly one-sixth of the prefecture. Rice is the principal crop: over 90 percent of the farmlands are rice fields. Most farms are small, producing only a slight income. Most farmers depend on income from other sources. Eastern Shiga is famous for cattle breeding and southeastern Shiga is famous for green tea. On Lake Biwa, some people are engaged in fishery and freshwater pearl farming.

Since the Medieval Period, especially in Edo period, many Shiga people were active in commerce and were called , sometimes by other envious merchants. For example, Nippon Life, Itochu, Marubeni, Takashimaya, Wacoal and Yanmar were founded by people from Shiga. In their home towns such as Omihachiman, Hino, Gokashō and Toyosato, their mansions were preserved as tourist attractions.

Beginning in the 1960s, Shiga developed industry, supporting major factories owned by companies such as IBM Japan, Canon, Yanmar Diesel, Mitsubishi, and Toray. According to Cabinet Office&#x27;s statistics in 2014, the Manufacturing sector accounted for 35.4% of Gross Shiga Product, the highest proportion in Japan. Traditional industries include textiles, Shigaraki ware, Butsudan in Hikone and Nagahama, medicines in Koka, and fan ribs in Adogawa.

== Demographics ==
The population is concentrated along the southern shore of Lake Biwa in Otsu city (adjacent to Kyoto) and along the lake&#x27;s eastern shore in cities such as Kusatsu and Moriyama, which are within commuting distance to Kyoto. The lake&#x27;s western and northern shores are more rural and resort-oriented with white sand beaches. In recent years, many Brazilians settled in Shiga to work in nearby factories. 25,040 foreigners live in Shiga and 30% of foreigners were Brazilians as of December 2016.

== Culture ==

Biwa Town (now a part of Nagahama) is a home of The Tonda Traditional Bunraku Puppet Troupe. Founded in the 1830s, the group is one of the most active traditional &quot;Bunraku&quot; puppet theaters in Japan outside the National Theater in Osaka. Toyosato and Higashiomi are known to a mecca of Goshu ondo.

Museums include the Sagawa Art Museum in Moriyama, the Lake Biwa Museum in Kusatsu and the Miho Museum in Kōka. In Kōka, a ninja house is preserved as a visitor center.

=== Cuisine ===
Since ancient times, Shigans have eaten fish from Lake Biwa. The most famous lake-food is . It retains the ancient style of sushi and has a pungent odor. Shiga is also famous for high quality wagyū, Ōmi beef. The Hikone Domain presented beef as medicinal food to shōguns. In addition, &quot;tsukemono&quot; of root crops, in northern Shiga, in Omihachiman, in Nagahama, and lightly seasoned champon in Hikone are examples of specific cuisine in Shiga.

=== Mass media ===

== Tourism ==


Shiga has many tourism resources, but Shiga is overshadowed by its much more famous neighbor Kyoto. Over four million foreign tourists visited Japan in 2000, but only sixty-five thousand visited Shiga.

The main gateways to Shiga are the Maibara Station in northern Shiga and the city of Ōtsu in the south. The Maibara Station is about 2 hours and 20 minutes away from the Tokyo Station by the Tokaido Shinkansen. It is easy to go to Ōtsu from Kyoto and Osaka by high-speed trains.

Shiga&#x27;s most prominent feature is Lake Biwa. The northern shore is especially scenic, such as the cherry blossoms of Kaizu Osaki in spring and the sacred island Chikubu-shima. The western shore has white sand beaches, popular among Kyotoites during the summer. The scenery of the southern shore, particularly around Otsu, was selected as &quot;Ōmi Hakkei&quot; or Eight Views of Ōmi, popularized by Hiroshige&#x27;s ukiyo-e. Most of the original eight views are now almost gone or changed from centuries ago. One remaining view is the Ukimidō &quot;floating temple&quot; building at Mangetsu-ji temple in Katata, northern Ōtsu. It was reconstructed with concrete in 1937, but a small temple still stands on the lake near the shore, accessible by a short bridge. Another scene features Ishiyama-dera temple in southern Otsu, which is also renowned for having a room where Murasaki Shikibu thought up the plan for some chapters of &quot;Tale of Genji&quot;.

The mountains around the lake offer extensive views. Mount Hira is a picnic spot. Mountain roads like the Oku-Biwako Parkway road up north and the Hiei-zan Driveway and Oku-Hiei Driveway overlooking the southwestern shore. In Ōtsu, the Ōtsu Prince Hotel&#x27;s Top of Otsu restaurant provides views of the lake and city. The &quot;Michigan&quot; paddlewheel boat offers lake cruises.

Besides the natural environment, historical buildings, and festivals, several persons of national importance hail from Shiga prefecture. Shiga has 807 National Treasures and Important Cultural Properties, making it the prefecture with the fourth largest number of such properties in Japan. Shiga&#x27;s most famous historical building is Hikone Castle, one of four national treasure castles in the country. The castle tower is well-preserved and has many cherry trees. The neighboring city of Nagahama has tourism in addition to its hikiyama festival. Nearby shrines include Hiyoshi Taisha in Otsu and Taga-taisha in Taga, which respectively head the seventh and twentieth largest shrine networks in Japan, at about 4,000 shrines and 260 shrines, respectively.

Festivals include the hikiyama festival (floats parade festival), held in ten areas such as Nagahama, Otsu, Maibara, Hino and Minakuchi. The Nagahama hikiyama festival held each April is one of the three major hikiyama festivals in Japan and was designated an Important Intangible Cultural Property in 1979. During this festival ornate floats are mounted with miniature stages on which boys (playing both male and female roles) act in kabuki plays. Higashiomi (formerly Yōkaichi) city holds a Giant Kite Festival every May along the riverbank. Ordinary people are invited to pull the rope that sends the kites aloft.

<doc id="179774" wikidata="Q7538052" url="?curid=179774" title="M51 Skysweeper">
<text>The M51 Skysweeper (Gun, M51, Antiaircraft or Gun automatic, 75-mm T83E6, and E7, recoil mechanism, and loader rammer) was an anti-aircraft gun deployed in the early 1950s by both the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force. It was the first such gun to combine a gun laying radar, analog computer (director) and an autoloader on a single carriage.

The Skysweeper was introduced just as surface-to-air missiles were being deployed in the long-range role, replacing earlier anti-aircraft artillery systems. These missiles were very large and slow to react, which left short-range engagements to guns. The Army&#x27;s existing guns were a motley collection of World War II-era systems that were barely effective then and were considered largely useless against jet-powered aircraft. Missiles replaced all of the larger weapons, while Skysweeper replaced all the smaller ones.

The Skysweeper system was used for a relatively short period of time, from the mid to late 1950s in the US, and into the 1960s and 1970s in some overseas locations. By that time newer missile systems were closing the range gap, and the Army was busy developing new weapons like the MIM-46 Mauler for this role.

==Development==
Anti-aircraft guns naturally fall into several categories, each for a different altitude and speed requirement. High-altitude targets require very large guns to get the needed power into the shell to reach those altitudes, but at the same time have the advantage of not needing to move very fast because at that range the change in angle of the target was small—consider the seemingly slow motion of an airliner at cruise altitude. At very low altitudes there were only seconds in which to react when spotting an aircraft over local terrain, so a hand-swung weapon was the only possibility, no matter how inaccurate. The short ranges meant that accuracy was not needed, nor was a large gun needed to cover the range.

This left an intermediate altitude at which a small gun could not be used because the range to the aircraft was too far, and a larger gun could not be used because the targets were moving too fast. During World War II this niche had been covered by the Bofors 40 mm and similar weapons, but against modern jet-powered aircraft these were effectively useless because they simply didn&#x27;t have the speed and weight of fire to be effective against targets that would be within range for only seconds. This led to the need for a new gun to address this intermediate-range role, and the Army defined this to be a weapon able to defeat aircraft flying at 1,000 mph (1,600 km/h) at altitudes up to 20,000 feet (6 km).

The Sperry Gyroscope Company developed the radar and computer, and development of what would become the Skysweeper started in 1948. A new 75 mm gun, known as the T83E1 or M35, was developed that had excellent muzzle velocity, along with two ten-round revolver-type magazines and an auto-loader that allowed it to reach 45 rounds/minute—about one third of what the much lighter Bofors had managed. This was mounted on a large square platform with powered traverse, which also mounted the box-shaped computer and manual gunsights on the right side, and the T-38 radar unit on the left. The T-38 radar had a range of about 30 km and could track aircraft traveling at up to 700 mph (1100 km/h).

The Army publicly announced the Skysweeper system in the Spring of 1953.

==Deployment==
Skysweeper deployment began in the early 1950s. Skysweeper was also part of the Army Anti-Aircraft Command (ARAACOM) in the U.S near targets that would have to be attacked by low-altitude aircraft. During the 1950s the Army formed the Army Anti-Aircraft Command (ARAACOM) to operate batteries of anti-aircraft guns and missiles. Most ARAACOM deployments were around cities and used the 90 mm and 120 mm guns, as well as the Nike Ajax missile defense.

CONUS had 896 120mm and 75mm &quot;Sky Sweepers&quot; in service in 1953. Most were along the NE Corridor from Boston to District of Columbia and in Washington State.

In 1957, ARAACOM was renamed to US Army Air Defense Command (USARADCOM, ARADCOM in 1961) and, ARAACOM started to dramatically replace gun sites with fewer missile sites (ARADCOM ended in 1975).

By the end of 1957 Skysweeper battalions remained at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, to protect the Soo Locks (one battalion), Savannah River Site (two), and one 90mm and two Skysweeper battalions at Thule Air Base, Greenland (all were removed by 1959). The last overseas Skysweeper were deactivated in the mid-1970s, being wholly replaced by other more advanced anti-air missile systems.

<doc id="179779" wikidata="Q6394419" url="?curid=179779" title="Kerrison Predictor">
<text>The Kerrison Predictor was one of the first fully automated anti-aircraft fire-control systems. It was used to automate the aiming of the British Army&#x27;s Bofors 40 mm guns and provide accurate lead calculations through simple inputs on three main .

The predictor could aim a gun at an aircraft based on simple inputs like the observed speed and the angle to the target. Such devices had been used on ships for gunnery control for some time, and versions such as the Vickers Predictor were available for larger anti-aircraft guns intended to be used against high-altitude bombers. Kerrison&#x27;s analog computer was the first to be fast enough to be used in the demanding high-speed low-altitude role, which involved very short engagement times and high angular rates.

The design was also adopted for use in the United States, where it was produced by Singer Corporation as the M5 Antiaircraft Director, later updated as the M5A1 and M5A2. The M6 was mechanically identical, differing only in running on UK-style 50 Hz power.

==History==
By the late 1930s, both Vickers and Sperry had developed predictors for use against high-altitude bombers. However, low-flying aircraft presented a very different problem, with very short engagement times and high angular rates of motion, but at the same time less need for ballistic accuracy. Machine guns had been the preferred weapon against these targets, aimed by eye and swung by hand, but these no longer had the performance needed to deal with the larger and faster aircraft of the 1930s.

The British Army&#x27;s new Bofors 40 mm guns were intended as their standard low-altitude anti-aircraft weapons. However, existing gunnery control systems were inadequate for the purpose; the range was too far to &quot;guess&quot; the lead, but at the same time close enough that the angle could change faster than the gunners could turn the traversal handles. Trying to operate a calculating gunsight at the same time was an added burden on the gunner. Making matters worse was that these ranges were exactly where the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;″s dive bombers, which were quickly proving to be a decisive weapon in the &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot;, were attacking from.

The problem was taken up by Major A.V. Kerrison of the British Army, who had been working as the Army liaison at the Admiralty Research Laboratory, Teddington, through 1930s. Kerrison had worked on several of the Royal Navy&#x27;s gunnery computers and took up the problem in the late 1930s. After the war, Kerrison went on to become Director of Aeronautical and Engineering Research at the British Admiralty.

His solution was a calculator that dispensed with many of the corrections and timing issues seen in devices like the Vickers Predictor which were intended for high-altitude fire. Instead, it made a relatively simple calculation of the impact point based on relative motion as provided by the operator. Key to the concept was the use of two ball-and-disk integrators, used in this case to maintain a constant rate of motion. On top of the motorized disk were two metal balls, set one on top of the other with the bottom one in contact with the disk and the second in contact with mechanisms that drove the Predictor&#x27;s laying handwheels.

The two balls were clutched so they could be separated or forced together. For the initial setup, the operator would declutch the balls and use the handwheels to bring the Predictor&#x27;s telescope onto the target. This also moved the two balls across the surface of the disk, although they were not in contact with it. Once they had begun tracking it, the clutch would be moved to bring the two balls into contact with the disk, at which point the rotation of the disk would cause the balls to rotate and thus automatically move the telescope to stay aligned with the target.

As the original inputs from the handwheels were unlikely to be perfectly accurate, the system would normally begin to &quot;drift&quot; away from the target. The operators would then move the handwheel to bring the target back into the center, which also slid the balls over the disk to a new location, changing their rotation speed, and thereby adjusting the rate of motion to properly track the target again. The position of the balls over the disk directly represents the rate of angular motion of the target. A third setting in the clutch reset the system to begin tracking a different target.

The two rates, in azimuth and altitude, were used to calculate the angular rate of the target, and from that, the vector along which the target was moving relative to the gun. This does not provide a complete solution; the shell from the gun takes a certain time to fly to the target, during which time it moves. This requires the gun to &quot;lead&quot; the target to account for the motion during this time. Since the range to the target is independent of its motion, this value had to be input separately, initially by a separate crewman simply estimating the range or using some form of optical rangefinder, although small Gun Laying radars for this task became common during World War II.

The &quot;output&quot; of the device drove hydraulic servo-motors attached to the traversal and elevation gears of the otherwise unmodified Bofors gun, allowing it to follow the predictor&#x27;s indications automatically without manual intervention. The gunners simply kept the gun loaded, while the three aimers simply had to point the Predictor, mounted on a large tripod, at the target. The Kerrison predictor did not calculate fuse settings, as the shells fired by the 40 mm Bofors gun, with which it was designed to work, were contact-fused.

The Predictor proved to be able to hit practically anything that flew in a straight line, and it was particularly effective against dive bombers. It was also very complex, including over 1,000 precision parts and weighing over , even though much of it was made of aluminium to reduce weight. With the demands of the RAF for almost all light metals and machinists, the Predictor was far too difficult for the Army to produce in any quantity.

While the Predictor proved to be an excellent addition to the Bofors, it was not without its faults. The main problem was that the system required a fairly large electrical generator in order to drive the gun, increasing the logistics load in supplying the generators with fuel. Setting the system up was also a fairly complex task, and not something that could be done &quot;on the fly&quot;. In the end, they were used almost entirely for static emplacements, field units continuing to rely on their original iron sights or the simple Stiffkey-Stick sights that were introduced in late 1943.

The No.7 anti-aircraft composite predictor, also designed by Kerrison was similar in some ways. It was originally developed for the 6-pounder naval gun, for close-in defence and also against targets at intermediate altitudes of . It was later adapted for use with the 40 mm Bofors.

Although it was more accurate than the Kerrison predictor, Sperry was unable to keep up with production of its more expensive and complex M-7 director. In September 1940, General George C. Marshall asked the British for the loan of four Bofors 40 mm guns with Kerrison Predictors for testing.

During testing the Kerrison Predictor provided accurate fire control to a range in excess of , and the Bofors gun was reliable. In the fall of 1940, the Ordnance Department standardized the Kerrison Predictor for use with their 37 mm gun. By February 1941, the U.S. Navy had adopted the Bofors for use on their ships. To ease production problems, the Army reluctantly standardized on the 40 mm in February 1941; the U.S. was building the Bofors for the British under the Lend-Lease Program.

The Predictor&#x27;s plans were passed to Sperry Corporation, who were just commencing production of their own complex high-altitude system, the M7 Computing Sight, and had no excess capacity to produce the new design as well. Instead, they completed changes needed to adapt the Predictor to U.S. production and sent the plans back to the Army for production elsewhere. In December 1940 the Singer Corporation was contracted to produce 1,500 predictors per month to equip the Army&#x27;s existing 37 mm guns while production of the 40 mm Bofors was ramped up. Two models were built initially, the M5 running on US-standard 115 V 60 Hz power, and the M6 for British use, running on 50 V 50 Hz power. The original M5 was designed to use an external torque amplifier, which added to the complexity. This was addressed in the M5A1, which used a more powerful ball-and-disk system that eliminated the need for an external amplifier.

To produce the devices rapidly enough, Singer implemented massive changes in the company, including building new factories and the switching of a foundry from steel to aluminium. Production did not begin until January 1943, but the entire order was filled by the middle of 1944. For a brief time, some of the U.S. Army&#x27;s Bofors guns were equipped with the Sperry M7, but these were replaced in the field as soon as M5s became available.

With aircraft speeds increasing dramatically during the war, even the speed of the Kerrison Predictor proved lacking by the end. Nevertheless, the Predictor demonstrated that effective gunnery required some sort of reasonably powerful computing support, and in 1944 Bell Labs started delivery of a new system based around an electronic analog computer. The timing proved excellent; late that summer, the Germans started attacking London with the V-1 flying bomb, which flew at high speeds at low altitudes. After a month of limited success against them, every available anti-aircraft gun was moved to the strip of land on the approach to London, and the new sights proved to be more than capable against them. Daytime attacks were soon abandoned.

Long after the war, U.S. M5s started appearing in surplus shops in the late 1950s. John Whitney purchased one (and later a Sperry M7) and connected the electrical outputs to servos controlling the positioning of small lit targets and light bulbs. He then modified the &quot;mathematics&quot; of the system to move the targets in various mathematically controlled ways, a technique he referred to as &quot;incremental drift&quot;. As the power of the systems grew, they eventually evolved into motion control photography, a widely used technique in special effects filming.

<text>is a landlocked prefecture of Japan located in the Chūbu region of Honshū. Nagano Prefecture has a population of 2,007,682 () and has a geographic area of . Nagano Prefecture borders Niigata Prefecture to the north, Gunma Prefecture to the northeast, Saitama Prefecture to the east, Yamanashi Prefecture to the southeast, Shizuoka Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture to the south, and Gifu Prefecture and Toyama Prefecture to the west.

Nagano is the capital and largest city of Nagano Prefecture, with other major cities including Matsumoto, Ueda, and Iida. Nagano Prefecture has impressive highland areas of the Japanese Alps, including most of the Hida Mountains, Kiso Mountains, and Akaishi Mountains which extend into the neighbouring prefectures. The area&#x27;s mountain ranges, natural scenery, and history has gained Nagano Prefecture international recognition as a winter sports tourist destination, and hosted the 1998 Winter Olympics. It is served by the Hokuriku Shinkansen line, with direct services to Tokyo, Toyama, and Kanazawa.

== History ==
== Geography ==
Nagano is an inland prefecture and it borders more prefectures than any other in Japan, bordering Gunma Prefecture, Saitama Prefecture, Yamanashi Prefecture, and Shizuoka Prefecture to the east, Niigata Prefecture to the north, Toyama Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture to the west, and Aichi Prefecture to the south. Nagano contains the point furthest from the sea in the whole of Japan—this point lies within the city of Saku. The province&#x27;s mountains have made it relatively isolated, and many visitors come to Nagano for its mountain resorts and hot springs. Nine of the twelve highest mountains in Japan can be found in Nagano and one of its lakes, Lake Kizaki, is a beach resort popular for its water attractions and games. The climate is predominantly alpine with warm summers, cold snowy winters and less intense humidity than the lower lying coastal areas. 

, 21% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks; namely the Chichibu Tama Kai, Chūbu-Sangaku, Jōshin&#x27;etsu-kōgen, and Minami Alps National Parks; Myōgi-Arafune-Saku Kōgen, Tenryū-Okumikawa, and Yatsugatake-Chūshin Kōgen Quasi-National Parks; and Chūō Alps, Enrei Ōjō, Hijiriyama Kōgen, Mibugawa Suikei, Ontake, and Tenryū Koshibu Suikei Prefectural Natural Parks.

<doc id="179794" wikidata="Q678321" url="?curid=179794" title="Dive bomber">
<text>A dive bomber is a bomber aircraft that dives directly at its targets in order to provide greater accuracy for the bomb it drops. Diving towards the target simplifies the bomb&#x27;s trajectory and allows the pilot to keep visual contact throughout the bomb run. This allows attacks on point targets and ships, which were difficult to attack with conventional level bombers, even &quot;en masse&quot;.

After World War II, the rise of precision-guided munitions and improved anti-aircraft defences—both fixed gunnery positions and fighter interception—led to a fundamental change in dive bombing. New weapons, such as rockets, allowed for better accuracy from smaller dive angles and from greater distances. They could be fitted to almost any aircraft, including fighters, improving their effectiveness without the inherent vulnerabilities of dive bombers, which needed air superiority to operate effectively.

== Method ==
A dive bomber dives at a steep angle, normally between 45 and 60 degrees or even up to a near vertical dive of 80 degrees with the Junkers Ju 87, and thus requires an abrupt pull-up after dropping its bombs. This puts great strains on both the pilot and aircraft. It demands an aircraft of strong construction, with some means to slow its dive. This limited the class to light bomber designs with ordnance loads in the range of although there were larger examples. The most famous examples are the Junkers Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot;, which was widely used during the opening stages of World War II, the Aichi D3A &quot;Val&quot; dive bomber, which sank more Allied warships during the war than any other Axis aircraft, and the Douglas SBD Dauntless, which sank more Japanese shipping than any other allied aircraft type. The SBD Dauntless helped win the Battle of Midway, was instrumental in the victory at the Battle of the Coral Sea, and fought in every US battle involving carrier aircraft.

An alternative technique, glide-bombing, allowed the use of heavier aircraft, which faced far greater difficulties in recovering from near-vertical approaches, though it required greater use of sophisticated bombsights and aiming techniques, by a specialised member of aircrews, namely a bombardier/bomb aimer. The crews of multi-engined dive-bombers, such as variants of the Junkers Ju 88 and Petlyakov Pe-2, frequently used this technique. The heaviest aircraft to have dive-bombing included in its design and development, the twin engine Heinkel He 177, also utilised a glide-bombing approach; the requirement that the He 177 be able to dive/glide-bomb delayed its development and impaired its overall performance.

Dive bombing was most widely used before and during World War II; its use declined during the war, when its vulnerability to enemy fighters became apparent. In the post-war era, this role was replaced with a combination of improved and automated bombsights, larger weapons and even nuclear warheads that greatly reduced the need for accuracy, and finally by precision guided weapons as they became available in the 1960s. Most tactical aircraft today allow bombing in shallow dives to keep the target visible, but true dive bombers have not been a part of military forces since the start of the jet age.

== Accuracy ==
When released from an aircraft, a bomb carries with it the aircraft&#x27;s trajectory. In the case of a bomber flying horizontally, the bomb will initially only be travelling forward. This forward motion is opposed by the drag of the air, so the forward motion decreases over time. Additionally, gravity causes the bomb to accelerate after it is dropped. The combination of these two forces, drag and gravity, results in a complex pseudo-parabolic trajectory.

The distance that the bomb moves forward while it falls is known as its range. If the range for a given set of conditions is calculated, simple trigonometry can be used to find the angle between the aircraft and the target. By setting the bombsight to this &quot;range angle&quot;, the aircraft can time the drop of its bombs at the instant when the target is lined up in the sight. This was only effective for &quot;area bombing&quot;, however, since the path of the bomb is only roughly estimated. Large formations could drop bombs on an area hoping to hit a specific target, but there was no guarantee of success, and huge areas around the target would also be hit. The advantage to this approach, however, was that it is easy to build such an aircraft and fly it at high altitude, keeping it out of range of ground-based defences.

The horizontal bomber was thus ill-suited for tactical bombing, particularly in close support. Attempts at using high-altitude bombing in near-proximity to troops often ended in tragedy, with bombs both hitting their targets and friendly troops indiscriminately. In attacking shipping, the problems of inaccuracy were amplified by the fact that the target could be moving, and could change its direction between the time that the bombs were released and the time that they arrived. Successful strikes on marine vessels by horizontal bombers were extremely rare. An example of this problem can be seen in the attempts to attack the Japanese carriers using B-17s at altitude in the Battle of Midway, with no hits scored. The German battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot; was subjected to countless attacks, many while in dock and immobile, but was not sunk until the British brought in enormous Tallboy bombs to ensure that even a near miss would be effective.

An aircraft diving vertically minimises its horizontal velocity component. When the bomb is dropped, the force of gravity simply increases its speed along its nearly vertical trajectory. The bomb travels a virtually straight line between release and impact, eliminating the need for complex calculations. The aircraft simply aims at the target and releases its bombs. The primary source of error is the effect of wind on the bomb&#x27;s flight path after release. As bombs are streamlined and heavy, wind has only a slight effect on them and the bomb is likely to fall within its lethal radius of the target.

Bomb sighting becomes trivial, requiring only a straight line of sight to the target. This was simplified as the aircraft was pointed directly at the target, making sighting over the nose much easier. Differences in the path of different bombs due to differing ballistics can be corrected by selecting a standardised bombing altitude and then adjusting the dive angle slightly for each case. As the bomber dives, the aim could be continually adjusted. In contrast, when a horizontal bomber veers offline while approaching the bomb release point, turning to the angle that would correct this also changes the speed of the aircraft over the ground (when there is a wind) and thereby changes the range as well.

In the 1930s and early 1940s, dive bombing was the best method for attacking high-value compact targets, like bridges and ships, with accuracy. The forces generated when the aircraft levels out at the bottom of the dive are considerable. The drawback of modifying and strengthening an aircraft for near-vertical dives was the loss of performance. Aside from the greater strength requirements, during normal horizontal flight, aircraft are normally designed to return to fly straight and level, but when put into a dive the changes in forces affecting the aircraft now cause the aircraft to track across the target unless the pilot applies considerable force to keep the nose down, with a corresponding decrease in accuracy. To compensate, many dive bombers were designed to be trimmed out, either through the use of special dive flaps (such as Fairey Youngman flaps) or through changes in tailplane trim that must be readjusted when the dive is completed.

The Vultee Vengeance, which was mostly used by the RAF and RAAF in Burma, was designed to be trimmed for diving, with no lift to distort the dive. The drawback was that it flew nose up in level flight, increasing drag. Failure to re-adjust trim made the aircraft difficult or impossible to pull out of a dive.

A dive bomber was vulnerable to low-level ground fire as it dived towards its target, since it was often headed in a straight line directly towards the defenders. At higher levels, this was less of a problem, as larger AA (anti-aircraft) shells were fused to explode at specific altitudes, which is impossible to determine while the plane is diving. In addition, most higher-altitude gunners and gunnery systems were designed to calculate the lateral movement of a target; while diving, the target appears almost stationary. Also, many AA mounts lacked the ability to fire directly up, so dive bombers were almost never exposed to fire from directly ahead.

Dive brakes were employed on many designs to create drag which slowed the aircraft in its dive and increased accuracy. Air brakes on modern aircraft function in a similar manner in bleeding off excessive speed.

== Origins ==
It is difficult to establish how dive bombing originated. During World War I, the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) found its biplane two-seat bombers insufficiently accurate in operations on the Western Front. Commanders urged pilots to dive from their cruising altitude to under to have a better chance of hitting small targets, such as gun emplacements and trenches. As this exposed the aircraft and crew to destructive ground fire in their unprotected open cockpits, few followed this order. Some recorded altitude at the top and bottom of their dive in log books and in squadron records, but not the steepness of the dive. It was certainly not near-vertical, as these early aircraft could not withstand the stresses of a sustained vertical dive.

The Royal Naval Air Service was bombing the Zeppelin sheds in Germany and in occupied Belgium and found it worthwhile to dive onto these sheds to ensure a hit, despite the increased casualties from ground fire. Again, the angle of dive in these attacks was not recorded.

Beginning on 18 June 1918, the Royal Air Force (RAF), successor to the RFC, ordered large numbers of the Sopwith TF.2 Salamander, a single-seat biplane. The &quot;TF&quot; stood for &quot;Trench Fighter&quot;, and the aircraft was designed to attack enemy trenches both with Vickers .303 machine guns and with bombs. Of the 37 Salamanders produced before the end of October 1918, only two were delivered to France, and the war ended before those saw action. Whether the Salamander counts in more modern parlance as a fighter-bomber or as a dive bomber depends on the definition of &quot;dive&quot;. It had armoured protection for the pilot and a fuel system to attack at low level, but lacked dive brakes for a vertical dive.

Heavy casualties resulting from air-to-ground attack on trenches set the minds of senior officers in the newly formed RAF against dive bombing. So not until 1934 did the Air Ministry issue specifications for both land-based and aircraft carrier-based dive bombers. The RAF cancelled its requirement and relegated the Hawker Henley dive bomber to other roles, while the Fleet Air Arm&#x27;s Blackburn Skua was expected to do double duty: as a fighter when out of reach of land-based fighter support, and as a dive bomber. It had dive brakes that doubled as flaps for carrier landings. The Hawker Henley had a top speed only slower than the Hawker Hurricane fighter from which it was derived. The American and Japanese navies and the Luftwaffe chose vertical dive bombers whose low speed had dire consequences when they encountered modern fighters.

== World War I ==
The Royal Naval Air Service developed dive bombing as a tactic against Zeppelin hangars and formed and trained a squadron at Manchester for this task. On 8 October 1914, a Sopwith Tabloid with two bombs attacked a hangar at Düsseldorf after a dive to . On 14 November 1914, four Avro 504s attacked the Zeppelin factory at Friedrichshafen on Lake Constance, diving from to to ensure hits. As Zeppelins were tethered close to stores of hydrogen, results were often spectacular.

The first use of dive bombing by the RFC, which had been urging its pilots to drop bombs at heights below in order to hit within of the target since February 1915, was later that year. On 27 November 1915, Lieutenant Duncan Grinnell-Milne arrived in his Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2c over railway marshalling yards near Lys in Northern France, to find the target already crowded by other bombers. He dived from to before releasing his bombs. A few weeks later, Lieutenant Arthur Gould dived to just to hit buildings near Arras.

The Royal Flying Corps developed strafing with diving aircraft using both machine guns and small bombs as a deliberate tactic. At the Battle of Cambrai on 20 November 1917, 320 Mark IV tanks and 300 aircraft, mostly Sopwith Camels and Airco DH 5s with bombs, were used to suppress artillery and machine guns. The cost in pilots was very high, with casualties on some days reaching 30 percent. The initial impact at Cambrai was highly successful. The staff officer to the Royal Tank Corps Lieutenant-Colonel J. F. C. Fuller published findings which were later taken up by Heinz Guderian to form the basis for the blitzkrieg tactics of using dive bombers with tanks employed by the Germans in 1939–40.

Second Lieutenant William Henry Brown, a Canadian from British Columbia serving with the RFC and flying a Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5a, made the first attack on a vessel on 14 March 1918, destroying an ammunition barge on a canal at Bernot near St Quentin, diving to to release his bombs. He was awarded the Military Cross for this and other exploits. Brown&#x27;s technique was emulated by other British squadrons. But the heavy casualties to unprotected pilots cast a pall over the results and influenced RAF thinking for 20 years.

== Interwar era ==
The Royal Flying Corps was initially impressed with the potential of the dive bomber, but was aware of its suicidal nature. It ran a series of tests at the Armament Experimental station at Orfordness in Suffolk. Sopwith Camels and Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5as were used in early 1918 to dive bomb targets from various heights, with different bombs and with and without the use of the Aldis gunsight, which had been invented in 1916 to aid pilots to calculate the deflection required to hit a traversing enemy aircraft. In principle, it obviated the need for a vertical dive. The results showed that a vertical dive into the wind sighting along the top of rather than through the sight was best. But they were not considered good enough to justify the expected casualties. The Royal Air Force, which took over both army and naval aviation in April 1918, retired its Sopwith Salamander dive bombers at the end of the war.
Colonel, later general, Billy Mitchell arrived in France with the first US Army and Air Force units soon after 6 April 1917 and began to organise the US Army Air Force flying French Salmson 2s, a spotter plane. The later Salmson 4 was to be a ground attack and dive bomber, but production was cancelled at the end of the war. Mitchell became a strong advocate of dive bombers after witnessing British and French aerial attacks. Mitchell, by now assistant chief of the Air Service United States Army, arranged tests with captured German and obsolete US ships in June and July 1921 and repeated over the next two years using Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5as as dive bombers and Handley Page O/400s and Martin NBS-1s as level bombers carrying bombs of different weights up to . The SMS &quot;Ostfriesland&quot; was sunk and so later were the USS &quot;Alabama&quot;, USS &quot;Virginia&quot; and USS &quot;New Jersey&quot;.

Opposite conclusions were drawn by the RAF and USAS, from two very different tests regarding the usefulness of dive bombers, with the RAF concluding that the cost in pilots was too high to justify the results and the USAS considering it as a potent anti-ship weapon. Both naval staffs opposed the view taken by the respective airmen.

In 1919, United States Marine Corps (USMC) pilot Lt. L. H. Sanderson mounted a rifle in front of the windshield of his Curtiss JN-4 (a training aircraft) as an improvised bomb sight, loaded a bomb in a canvas bag attached to the aircraft&#x27;s underside, and made a solo attack in support of USMC troops trapped by Haitians during the United States occupation of Haiti. Sanderson&#x27;s bomb hit its target and the raids were repeated. During 1920, Sanderson familiarised aviators of USMC units on the Atlantic coast with dive bombing techniques. Dive bombing was also used during the United States occupation of Nicaragua.

As aircraft grew more powerful, dive bombing became a favoured tactic, particularly against small targets such as ships. The United States Navy overcame its hostility to Mitchell&#x27;s findings and deployed the Curtiss F8C Falcon biplane from 1925 on carriers, while the Marine Corps operated them from land bases as the Helldiver, a name later reused by Curtiss for other dive bombers.

The Imperial Japanese Navy ordered the Heinkel He 50 in 1931 as a floatplane and carrier-based dive bomber and embarked some on new carriers from 1935 in a developed form as the Heinkel He 66, from which the Aichi D1A was further developed in Japan. The Luftwaffe confiscated a Chinese export shipment and ordered more.

Navies increasingly operated carriers, which had a limited number of aircraft available for attack, each with only a small bomb load. Targets were often likely to be small or fast-moving and the need for accuracy made dive bombers essential.

Ernst Udet, a German First World War ace, persuaded Hermann Göring to buy two Curtiss Hawk IIs for the newly reformed Luftwaffe. Udet, then a stunt pilot, flew one in aerobatic displays during the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games. Due to his connections with the Nazi party, he became the development director of the Ministry of Aviation, where he pushed for dive bomber development.

Dive bombing would allow a low-cost Luftwaffe to operate effectively in the tactical role. Against small targets, a single-engine dive bomber could achieve four times the accuracy at one tenth of the cost of a four-engine heavy bomber, such as the projected Ural bomber, and it could reach the battlefield well ahead of field artillery. Soon the Luftwaffe issued a contract for its own dive bomber design, resulting in the Junkers K 47, which, following extensive trials, would in turn result in the Junkers Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; (a contraction of &quot;Sturzkampfflugzeug&quot;, literally &#x27;diving combat airplane&#x27;).

Several early Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers, which first flew on 13 September 1935, were shipped secretly from Germany to Spain to assist General Francisco Franco&#x27;s Nationalist rebels in the Spanish Civil War. Several problems appeared, including the tendency of the fixed undercarriage to sink into soft ground and an inability to take-off with a full bomb load. Condor Legion&#x27;s experience in Spain demonstrated the value of dive bombers, especially on the morale of troops or civilians unprotected by air cover. The aircraft did not encounter opposing modern fighters, which concealed its vulnerability from the Luftwaffe. Udet was impressed with the Stuka&#x27;s performance in Spain, so he ordered that the Junkers Ju 88 medium bomber should also be retrofitted as a dive bomber. He also insisted, against the advice of Ernst Heinkel, that the Heinkel He 177 bomber, ordered in November 1937, be able to dive bomb. Lack of a sufficiently powerful, reliable powerplant fatally compromised its utility, it never performed in the dive bomber role, and the requirement was eventually dropped.

Some 23 Breda Ba 65s were flown by Italian pilots also in support of Nationalist forces. First flown in 1935, it was a single-seat dive bomber carrying the same bomb load as the Stuka with a speed advantage in level flight.
As the Royal Navy again took control of the Fleet Air Arm, it began to receive the Fairey Swordfish from 1936 and Blackburn Skuas from November 1938. The Skua had a secondary function of intercepting attacks by unescorted long-range bombers. With four .303 Browning guns and another rear-facing gun, it was expected to defend against air attack with a top speed of at sea level, which was a low-altitude speed comparable with other navies&#x27; carrier borne fighters in 1938–39. The Royal Navy&#x27;s dedicated, pre- and early-war, fleet fighter was the Gloster Sea Gladiator. The Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) Mitsubishi A5M and USN Grumman F3F were nominally faster than the Skua but this speed was achieved at much higher altitudes; at low altitudes the Skua was quite comparable in speed and was also better armed. The Swordfish was also capable of operating as a dive-bomber and in 1939 HMS &quot;Glorious&quot; used her Swordfish for a series of dive-bombing trials, during which 439 practise bombs were dropped at dive angles of 60, 67 and 70 degrees, against the target ship HMS &quot;Centurion&quot;. Tests against a stationary target showed an average error of from a release height of and a dive angle of 70 degrees. Tests against a manoeuvring target showed an average error of from a drop height of and a dive angle of 60 degrees. The Fairey Albacore was also designed to act as a dive bomber and was used extensively in this role during World War Two.

The British Air Ministry issued Specification 4/34 in 1934 for a ground attack aircraft with dive bombing capability. The Hawker Henley was a two-seat version of the Battle of Britain-winning Hawker Hurricane. It was fast, at almost at sea level and in a dive, but development was delayed when Hurricane development took priority. Just 200 were built and it was relegated to target towing. The RAF ordered the US-built Vultee A-31 Vengeance in 1943, but it, too, was similarly relegated to target towing after a brief operation period in secondary theatres.
The Curtiss SBC Helldiver was a biplane dive bomber that had been taken aboard the in 1934, but it was slow, at . Fifty ex-US Navy examples were flown to Halifax, Nova Scotia, by Curtiss pilots and embarked on the French aircraft carrier &quot;Béarn&quot; in a belated attempt to help France, which surrendered while they were mid-Atlantic. Five airframes left behind in Halifax later reached the RAF, which quickly relegated them to the status of ground instructional airframes for the training of mechanics.

The Japanese introduced the Aichi D3A Val monoplane as a successor to the biplane Aichi D1A in 1940, with trials aboard the carriers &quot;Kaga&quot; and &quot;Akagi&quot;. It was to prove a potent weapon against surface ships.

Only the Wehrmacht learned from the Battle of Cambrai (1917) in using dive bombers in conjunction with tanks. The writings of Britain&#x27;s Colonel J. F. C. Fuller, a staff officer, and Basil Liddell-Hart (a military journalist) propounded the concept of mobile tank forces supported by ground-attack aircraft creating a breakthrough. These were eagerly studied by the German army officer Heinz Guderian, who created the combination of Panzers and dive bombers that later proved so potent in Poland and France. The Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; could be used as aerial artillery moving far ahead of the main forces with Panzers to smash enemy strong points without waiting for the horse-drawn artillery to catch up. It was central to the concept of Blitzkrieg, which required close co-ordination between aircraft and tanks by radio.

The RAF had chosen the single-engined Fairey Battle and the twin-engined Bristol Blenheim as its tactical bombers. Both were level bombers with similar bomb-loads and entered service in 1937. The US Army Air Corps (USAAC) adopted the Douglas A-20 Havoc, first flying in January 1939, for a similar role, although originally ordered by France. Many were also supplied to the Soviet Air Force, which also used the Ilyushin Il-2 Sturmovik ground-attack aircraft in huge numbers. None of these were dive bombers. No Allied air force operated a modern dive bomber at the outbreak of the Second World War, although both the Royal Navy and the US Navy had shipboard dive bombers.

On 10 April 1940, 16 British Royal Navy Blackburn Skuas flying at extreme range from the naval air station at Hatston in Orkney led by Lieutenant Commander William Lucy sank the German cruiser &quot;Königsberg&quot; in Bergen harbour, whilst trying to prevent the German invasion of Norway. On the German side Stukas augmented or replaced artillery support for the Wehrmacht&#x27;s lightly armed parachute and airborne troops.

The invasion of Poland (September to October 1939) and the Battle of France (May to June 1940) saw the Stuka used to devastating effect. German &quot;blitzkrieg&quot; tactics used dive bombers in place of artillery to support highly mobile ground troops. The British Expeditionary Force had set up strong defensive positions on the west bank of the Oise River to block rapidly advancing German armour. Stukas quickly broke the defences, and the Wehrmacht forced a crossing long before German artillery arrived.

On 12/13 May 1940, Stukas flew 300 sorties against strong French defensive positions at the Battle of Sedan. This enabled German forces to make a fast and unexpected breakthrough of the French lines, eventually leading to the German advance to the Channel and the cutting off of much of the Allied army.

The skies over Sedan also showed the Stuka&#x27;s weakness when met with fighter opposition; six French Curtiss H-75s attacked a formation of unescorted Ju 87s and shot down 11 out of 12 without loss. The Stuka was even more vulnerable to the Hawker Hurricane with its speed edge and eight machine guns, which it first met over France and then in larger numbers in the Battle of Britain (July to October 1940). Losses were such that the Luftwaffe rapidly withdrew Stukas from operations over the United Kingdom. A similar fate befell unescorted RAF Fairey Battles over France.

The Stuka had 7.92mm machine guns or 20mm cannons mounted in the wings. Some were modified to destroy tanks with heavy calibre, 37mm &quot;Bordkanone&quot; BK 3,7 autocannons mounted in gun pods below the wings. They were very successful in this role in the early days (1941) of Operation Barbarossa before the Red Army Air Force countered with modern fighters, such as the Yakovlev Yak-1 and later the Yakovlev Yak-3.

The most successful dive-bomber pilot, Hans-Ulrich Rudel, made 2,530 sorties. He contributed to the sinking of the Soviet battleship &quot;Marat&quot; at Kronstadt on 23 September 1941 using bombs. Later, flying a tank-buster Stuka with 20mm cannon, he claimed over 100 Soviet tanks destroyed, mostly at the Battle of Kursk in July 1943. The Ju 87G &quot;Kanonenvogel&quot;, equipped with two 37mm BK 3,7 anti-tank guns, as suggested by Rudel, proved to be a lethal weapon in skilled hands. In the Soviet counter-offensive, Operation Kutuzov (July to August 1943), which concluded Kursk, the Luftwaffe claimed 35 tanks destroyed in a single day. Rudel co-wrote a post-war book about his experiences and consulted with the US Air Force.

When Italy joined the war (10 June 1940) on the Axis side, the Regia Aeronautica shipped Breda Ba.65s to North Africa for use against the British but they also proved vulnerable. By February 1941 British fighters had shot down most of the Italian planes. In Morocco on 11 November 1942, American Curtiss P-40 Warhawks shot down 15 Ju 87Ds in one encounter.

The United States Army Air Forces took delivery of a few North American P-51 Mustangs from a British order but, as there were no funds to buy more fighters, they were modified as dive bombers with a new wing and with dive brakes. First flown in October 1942 as the North American A-36 Apache, they arrived in Morocco in April 1943 to assist with driving the Afrika Korps out of Africa. The aircraft was very fast at low altitude. It was also accident-prone, achieving the highest casualty-rate during training of any USAAF aircraft and was officially restricted to no more than a 70-degree dive. The Apache did not fly with the RAF, but served with US squadrons in Sicily, Italy and, by late summer of 1943, was based in India for use over Burma and China. It proved to be an excellent dive-bomber and a good fighter: one ace in Italy shot down five German fighters.
The Royal Navy&#x27;s Fairey Swordfish and Fairey Albacore torpedo-dive bombers and Blackburn Skua fighter-bombers were replaced by Fairey Barracuda torpedo-dive bombers, which made repeated diving attacks on the German battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot; which lay protected by torpedo nets in a Norwegian fjord during 1944. On 3 April 1944, in Operation Tungsten, 42 aircraft flying from the carriers HMS &quot;Victorious&quot; and HMS &quot;Furious&quot; scored 14 hits with and bombs and put the battleship out of action for over two months.

The Soviet Union Armed Forces deployed the Arkhangelsky Ar-2 from 1940 to 1944 and the Petlyakov Pe-2 from 1941 to 1954.

The Vultee Vengeance was developed in the US as a private venture dive bomber for export. It first flew in March 1941. It had a zero incidence wing, which was perfect for vertical dives as there was no lift from wing or tailplane in a dive. But it had to fly in a nose up attitude to maintain level flight, which made landings difficult. Initial orders were 300 for France, but France fell before they could be delivered. The RAF, with the cancellation of the Hawker Henley and having noted the success of Stukas in Poland, took delivery instead. It was considered too vulnerable to German fighters for use in Europe or North Africa, but large numbers flew in Burma from March 1943. It flew close support for General William Slim&#x27;s Burma campaign bombing Japanese supply routes, bridges and artillery. It operated in the Royal Australian Air Force and Indian Air Force as well as the RAF. Some were held back for the United States Army Air Forces after the attack on Pearl Harbor, but did not see combat.

Both the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) and the United States Navy invested considerable effort on dive bombers. Japan started the war with a very good design, the carrier-borne Aichi D3A (&quot;Val&quot;). As the war progressed, the design became outdated due to its limited speed, due in part to the limited horsepower of its power plant and to the greater drag of its fixed main landing gear (a shortcoming shared by the Stuka).

The main American dive bomber, the Douglas SBD Dauntless, had similar performance to the D3A Val. From December 1942, the Dauntless was replaced with the faster, but more complex and trouble-prone Curtiss SB2C Helldiver. Both American aeroplanes were ubiquitous, with 6,000 Dauntlesses and over 7,000 Helldivers built. Both the SBD and D3A were used at Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. The Japanese sent 54 D3A Vals carrying bombs to attack parked aircraft at Wheeler Field and Ford Island. A flight of 18 Dauntlesses from arrived over Pearl Harbor just as the Japanese attacked. Seven were shot down and many others destroyed on the ground at Marine Corps Air Station Ewa At the Battle of the Coral Sea, Dauntlesses sank the light carrier &quot;Shoho&quot; and damaged the fleet carrier &quot;Shokaku&quot; together with Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bombers.

On 5 April 1942, the heavy cruisers and were leaving Colombo, Ceylon to join the British Eastern Fleet, but had been spotted by Japanese reconnaissance aircraft. They were attacked by a large number of Aichi D3As and both were sunk. On 9 April 1942 the Royal Navy aircraft carrier escorted by the destroyer were attacked by more than 32 Aichi D3As and both were sunk shortly before eight defending RN FAA Fairey Fulmars, of 806 Squadron, could reach them. The Fulmars shot down four D3As and damaged two while losing two Fulmars to the more numerous D3As.

At the Battle of Midway on 4 June 1942, after most of the torpedo bombers had been shot down without a single hit, Dauntlesses from and found four Japanese carriers, in the vulnerable stage of refuelling and rearming aircraft for a second strike. The Combat Air Patrol of formidable Mitsubishi A6M Zeros had been drawn away, chasing torpedo bombers and escorting fighters, leaving a clear sky. &quot;Soryu&quot; and &quot;Kaga&quot; were ablaze within six minutes, while &quot;Akagi&quot;, hit only once, suffered fatal damage as the single bomb ignited fuel and bombs in the hangar.

Later on 4 June, &quot;Yorktown&quot; and &quot;Enterprise&quot; dive bombers inflicted fatal damage on the fourth Japanese carrier &quot;Hiryu&quot;. Within hours the Imperial Japanese Navy had lost four of its aircraft carriers and many experienced naval airmen, both of which Japan would have difficulty in replacing. Further follow-up raids by SBDs and SB2Us from &quot;Midway&quot; and SBDs from &quot;Yorktown&quot;, &quot;Enterprise&quot; and on 5–6 June sank the IJN heavy cruiser &quot;Mikuma&quot; and heavily damaged her sister ship &quot;Mogami&quot; and two escorting destroyers.

The United States Army Air Forces took a version of the Dauntless with a different tailwheel tire and no arrester hook as the Douglas A-24 Banshee. In crates headed for the Philippines, they were diverted to Australia and operated from Charters Towers in Queensland. The Banshee was unable to contend with Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zeros. On 26 July 1942, just seven Banshees were sent to intercept a Japanese convoy supplying forces occupying New Guinea. Six were shot down.

The Japanese Yokosuka D4Y Suisei, code-name Judy, began to replace the Vals after a very troublesome development on surviving larger Japanese carriers from March 1943. With a sleek fuselage, retracting landing gear and a powerful licensed Daimler-Benz 601 engine, it could outpace pursuing Grumman F4F Wildcats. To maximise speed and range, the Japanese had dispensed with armour protection and self-sealing fuel tanks, which proved to be very costly when the US Navy deployed the new &quot;Essex&quot;-class aircraft carriers, which each carried 36 of the faster Grumman F6F Hellcats. The Battle of the Philippine Sea on 19–20 June 1944 was a failure in terms of Japanese carriers hit, but the losses of Vals and Judies and their crews were enough to destroy the Japanese navy&#x27;s ability to strike by air ever again.

Henceforward attacks were mostly confined to kamikaze. The Japanese were now on the defensive. Japan&#x27;s industrial output dropped from a peak in 1942, while that of the US increased by a quarter in two years from 1942 to 1944. Japanese wartime production of bombers of all types was just 16% of the US output.

==Decline==
When the RAF were attempting to stop the Panzers of Erwin Rommel&#x27;s Afrika Korps in early 1942, a lack of dive bombers proved to be an impediment. However, the British Government&#x27;s Chief Scientist, Henry Tizard, formed a panel of experts, which recommended using rockets. A rocket has a much flatter trajectory than a bomb, allowing it to be launched with reasonable accuracy from a shallow dive, and could be fitted on existing aircraft. The RAF used them on Hurricanes in June 1942 against Rommel&#x27;s tanks. The British Army had used rockets against low-flying bombers during the Battle of Britain by enlarging the tube from to and fitting high explosive warheads; it became an anti-tank weapon. The more powerful Hawker Typhoon, originally developed as a fighter, proved even more effective, carrying eight RP-3 rockets and producing a similar effect to a naval destroyer&#x27;s broadside.

On 23 May 1943, a Fairey Swordfish destroyed &quot;U-752&quot; in the Atlantic, and five days later, a Lockheed Hudson of RAF Coastal Command sank &quot;U-755&quot; in the Mediterranean, using specialised rockets fitted with iron spikes which were fired at a shallow angle into the sea. Once under water, they curved upwards and punctured the pressure hull below the waterline, disabling or sinking the submarine.

Caltech developed the High Velocity Aircraft Rocket (HVAR) with a warhead for the US Navy. It was rushed to Europe for use on D-Day and later used by Navy aircraft in the Pacific. By January 1943, American pilots who had been flying in RAF Eagle Squadrons before the US entered the war, converted from Supermarine Spitfires to Republic P-47 Thunderbolts to form the USAAF 4th Air Fighter Group. At over unladen, one of the biggest single engine fighter bombers of the war, it could carry ten HVARs.

By late 1944, the RAF was able to hit stationary targets with greater accuracy from greater heights inflicting far more damage with less risk. On 12 November 1944, two Tallboy bombs were dropped by Avro Lancasters from and hit the German battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot; at supersonic speeds, sinking it. The Tallboy was developed by Vickers designer Barnes Wallis who followed it up with the even larger Grand Slam earthquake bomb which was used to destroy railway viaducts and bridges, targets that could previously only be damaged in diving attacks. Wallis also designed a bomb that bounced across water to destroy the Eder and Moehne dams, which needed to be hit repeatedly at the same spot under water to be breached but had nets to protect against torpedoes.

Pilots in the Pacific later developed a technique of skip bombing which required flying at low level and dropping a spherically nosed conventional bomb onto the sea, at a shallow angle, which then bounced back into the air.

Although new aircraft could still dive towards their targets, they were no longer optimised for steep diving attacks. Through the pioneering efforts by the Luftwaffe&#x27;s Fritz X and the USAAF&#x27;s Azon, controlled-trajectory bombs evolved into today&#x27;s smart bombs. A bomb can be dropped far from a target&#x27;s air defences using a guidance system to hit the target, ensuring greater accuracy and minimising risk to the crew.

Jet engines allowed higher speeds which made &quot;toss bombing&quot; possible, a reverse dive bombing method where an aircraft snaps up from low altitude as a bomb is released, throwing it upwards like a shot put.
