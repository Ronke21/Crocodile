<text>Philosophy of history is the philosophical study of history and its discipline. The term was coined by the French philosopher Voltaire.

In contemporary philosophy a distinction has developed between the &quot;speculative&quot; philosophy of history and the &quot;critical&quot; philosophy of history, now referred to as &quot;analytic&quot;. The split between these approaches may be approximately compared, by analogy and on the strength of regional and academic influences, to the schism in commitments between analytic and continental philosophy wherein the analytic approach is pragmatic and the speculative approach attends more closely to a metaphysics (or anti-metaphysics) of determining forces like language or the phenomenology of perception at the level of background assumptions.

At the level of practice, the analytic approach questions the meaning and purpose of the historical process whereas the speculative approach studies the foundations and implications of history and the historical method. The names of these are derived from C. D. Broad&#x27;s distinction between critical philosophy and speculative philosophy.

The divergence between these approaches crystallizes in the disagreements between Hume and Kant on the question of causality. Hume and Kant may be viewed in retrospect—by expressive anachronism—as analytic and speculative, respectively. Historians like Foucault or Hannah Arendt, who tend to be spoken of as theorists or philosophers before they are acknowledged as historians, may largely be identified with the speculative approach whereas generic academic history tends to be cleave to analytic and narrative approaches.

== Origins ==
In his &quot;Poetics&quot;, Aristotle (384–322 BCE) maintained the superiority of poetry over history because poetry speaks of what &quot;ought&quot; or &quot;must&quot; be true rather than merely what &quot;is&quot; true.

Herodotus, a fifth-century BCE contemporary of Socrates, broke from the Homeric tradition of passing narrative from generation to generation in his work &quot;Investigations&quot; (Ancient Greek: Ἱστορίαι; Istoríai), also known as &quot;Histories&quot;. Herodotus, regarded by some as the first systematic historian, and, later, Plutarch (46–120 CE) freely invented speeches for their historical figures and chose their historical subjects with an eye toward morally improving the reader. History was supposed to teach good examples for one to follow. The assumption that history &quot;should teach good examples&quot; influenced how writers produced history.

From the Classical period to the Renaissance, historians&#x27; focus alternated between subjects designed to improve mankind and a devotion to fact. History was composed mainly of hagiographies of monarchs and epic poetry describing heroic deeds such as &quot;The Song of Roland&quot;—about the Battle of Roncevaux Pass (778) during Charlemagne&#x27;s first campaign to conquer the Iberian Peninsula.

In the fourteenth century, Ibn Khaldun, whom George Sarton considered one of the first philosophers of history, discussed his philosophy of history and society in detail in his &quot;Muqaddimah&quot; (1377). His work represents a culmination of earlier works by medieval Islamic sociologists in the spheres of Islamic ethics, political science, and historiography, such as those of al-Farabi (c. 872 – c. 950), Ibn Miskawayh, al-Dawani, and Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (1201–1274). Ibn Khaldun often criticized &quot;idle superstition and uncritical acceptance of historical data&quot;. He introduced a scientific method to the philosophy of history (which Dawood considers something &quot;totally new to his age&quot;) and he often referred to it as his &quot;new science&quot;,
which is now associated with historiography. His historical method also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of the state, communication, propaganda, and systematic bias in history.

By the eighteenth century historians had turned toward a more positivist approach—focusing on fact as much as possible, but still with an eye on telling histories that could instruct and improve. Starting with Fustel de Coulanges (1830–1889) and Theodor Mommsen (1817–1903), historical studies began to move towards a more modern scientific form. In the Victorian era, historiographers debated less whether history was intended to improve the reader, and more on what causes turned history and how one could understand historical change.

== Concepts ==
=== Philosophy of chronology ===

Many ancient cultures held mythical and theological concepts of history and of time that were not linear. Such societies saw history as cyclical, with alternating Dark and Golden Ages. Plato taught the concept of the Great Year, and other Greeks spoke of aeons. Similar examples include the ancient doctrine of eternal return, which existed in Ancient Egypt, in the Indian religions, among the Greek Pythagoreans&#x27; and in the Stoics&#x27; conceptions. In his &quot;Works and Days&quot;, Hesiod described five Ages of Man: the Golden Age, the Silver Age, the Bronze Age, the Heroic Age, and the Iron Age, which began with the Dorian invasion. Some scholars identify just four ages, corresponding to the four metals, with the Heroic age as a description of the Bronze Age. A four-age count would match the Vedic or Hindu ages known as Satya Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga and Kali Yuga, which together make one Yuga Cycle that repeats. According to Jainism, this world has no beginning or end but goes through cycles of upturns (utsarpini) and downturns (avasarpini) constantly. Many Greeks believed that just as mankind went through four stages of character during each rise and fall of history so did government. They considered democracy and monarchy as the healthy régimes of the higher ages; and oligarchy and tyranny as corrupted régimes common to the lower ages.

In the East, cyclical theories of history developed in China (as a theory of dynastic cycle) and in the Islamic world in the Muqaddimah of Ibn Khaldun (1332–1406).

During the Renaissance, cyclical conceptions of history would become common, with proponents illustrating decay and rebirth by pointing to the decline of the Roman Empire. Machiavelli&#x27;s &quot;Discourses on Livy&quot; (1513–1517) provide an example. The notion of Empire contained in itself ascendance and decadence, as in Edward Gibbon&#x27;s &quot;The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; (1776), which the Roman Catholic Church placed on the &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot; (List of Prohibited Books).

During the Age of Enlightenment, history began to be seen as both linear and irreversible. Condorcet&#x27;s interpretations of the various &quot;stages of humanity&quot; and Auguste Comte&#x27;s positivism were among the most important formulations of such conceptions of history, which trusted social progress. As in Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1762) treatise on education (or the &quot;art of training men&quot;), the Enlightenment conceived the human species as perfectible: human nature could be infinitely developed through a well-thought pedagogy.

Cyclical conceptions continued in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in the works of authors such as Oswald Spengler (1880–1936), Correa Moylan Walsh (1862–1936), Nikolay Danilevsky (1822–1885), Claude Lévi-Strauss (1908–2009), and Paul Kennedy (1945– ), who conceived the human past as a series of repetitive rises and falls. Spengler, like Butterfield, when writing in reaction to the carnage of the First World War of 1914–1918, believed that a civilization enters upon an era of Caesarism
after its soul dies. Spengler thought that the soul of the West was dead and that Caesarism was about to begin.

=== Philosophy of causality ===

Narrative and causal approaches to history have often been contrasted or even opposed to one another, yet they can also be viewed as complementary. Some philosophers of history such as Arthur Danto have claimed that &quot;explanations in history and elsewhere&quot; describe &quot;not simply an event—something that happens—but a change&quot;. Like many practicing historians, they treat causes as intersecting actions and sets of actions which bring about &quot;larger changes&quot;, in Danto&#x27;s words: to decide &quot;what are the elements which persist through a change&quot; is &quot;rather simple&quot; when treating an individual&#x27;s &quot;shift in attitude&quot;, but &quot;it is considerably more complex and metaphysically challenging when we are interested in such a change as, say, the break-up of feudalism or the emergence of nationalism&quot;.

Much of the historical debate about causes has focused on the relationship between communicative and other actions, between singular and repeated ones, and between actions, structures of action or group and institutional contexts and wider sets of conditions. John Gaddis has distinguished between exceptional and general causes (following Marc Bloch) and between &quot;routine&quot; and &quot;distinctive links&quot; in causal relationships: &quot;in accounting for what happened at Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, we attach greater importance to the fact that President Truman ordered the dropping of an atomic bomb than to the decision of the Army Air Force to carry out his orders.&quot; He has also pointed to the difference between immediate, intermediate and distant causes. For his part, Christopher Lloyd puts forward four &quot;general concepts of causation&quot; used in history: the &quot;metaphysical idealist concept, which asserts that the phenomena of the universe are products of or emanations from an omnipotent being or such final cause&quot;; &quot;the empiricist (or Humean) regularity concept, which is based on the idea of causation being a matter of constant conjunctions of events&quot;; &quot;the functional/teleological/consequential concept&quot;, which is &quot;goal-directed, so that goals are causes&quot;; and the &quot;realist, structurist and dispositional approach, which sees relational structures and internal dispositions as the causes of phenomena&quot;.

There is disagreement about the extent to which history is ultimately deterministic. Some argue that geography, economic systems, or culture prescribe laws that determine the events of history. Others see history as a sequence of consequential processes that act upon each other. Even determinists do not rule out that, from time to time, certain cataclysmic events occur to change the course of history. Their main point is, however, that such events are rare and that even apparently large shocks like wars and revolutions often have no more than temporary effects on the evolution of the society.

=== Philosophy of neutrality ===

The question of neutrality concerns itself foremost with analysis of historiography and the biases of historical sources. One prominent manifestation of this analysis is the idea that &quot;history is written by the victors&quot;.

G. W. F. Hegel adopts the expression &quot;Die Weltgeschichte ist das Weltgericht&quot; (&quot;World history is a tribunal that judges the world&quot;, a quote from Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s poem &quot;Resignation&quot;, published in 1786) and asserts that history is what judges men and women, their actions, and their opinions. Since the twentieth century, Western historians have disavowed the aspiration to provide a judgement of history. The goals of historical judgements or interpretations are separate from those of legal judgements, which need to be formulated quickly after the events and be final.

In his &quot;Collège de France&quot; lectures published as &quot;Society Must Be Defended&quot;, Michel Foucault posits that the victors of a social struggle use their political dominance to suppress a defeated adversary&#x27;s version of historical events in favor of their own propaganda, which may go so far as historical negationism. Wolfgang Schivelbusch&#x27;s &quot;Culture of Defeat&quot; takes an opposing approach that defeat is a major driver for the defeated to reinvent himself, while the victor, confirmed in his attitudes and methods, dissatisfied by the high losses and paltry gains made, may be less creative and fall back.

Related to the issues of historical judgement are those of the pretension to neutrality and objectivity. Analytic and critical philosophers of history have debated whether historians should express judgements on historical figures, or if this would infringe on their supposed role. In general, positivists and neopositivists oppose any value-judgement as unscientific.

== Operative theories ==

=== Teleological approaches ===
Early teleological approaches to history can be found in theodicies, which attempted to reconcile the problem of evil with the existence of God—providing a global explanation of history with belief in a progressive directionality organized by a superior power, leading to an eschatological end, such as a Messianic Age or Apocalypse. However, this transcendent teleological approach can be thought as immanent to human history itself. Augustine of Hippo, Thomas Aquinas, Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet, in his 1679 &quot;Discourse On Universal History&quot;, and Gottfried Leibniz, who coined the term, formulated such philosophical theodicies. Leibniz based his explanation on the principle of sufficient reason, which states that anything that happens, does happen for a specific reason. Thus, if one adopts God&#x27;s perspective, seemingly evil events in fact only take place in the larger divine plan. In this way theodicies explained the necessity of evil as a relative element that forms part of a larger plan of history. However, Leibniz&#x27;s principles were not a gesture of fatalism. Confronted with the antique problem of future contingents, Leibniz developed the theory of compossible worlds, distinguishing two types of necessity, in response to the problem of determinism.

G. W. F. Hegel may represent the epitome of teleological philosophy of history. Hegel&#x27;s teleology was taken up by Francis Fukuyama in his &quot;The End of History and the Last Man&quot;. Thinkers such as Nietzsche, Michel Foucault, Althusser, or Deleuze deny any teleological sense to history, claiming that it is best characterized by discontinuities, ruptures, and various time-scales, which the Annales School claimed to have demonstrated.

Schools of thought influenced by Hegel also see history as progressive, but they see progress as the outcome of a dialectic in which factors working in opposite directions are over time reconciled. History was best seen as directed by a , and traces of the could be seen by looking backward. Hegel believed that history was moving man toward civilization, and some also claim he thought that the Prussian state incarnated the &quot;end of history&quot;. In his &quot;Lessons on the History of Philosophy&quot;, he explains that each epochal philosophy is in a way the whole of philosophy; it is not a subdivision of the Whole but this Whole itself apprehended in a specific modality.

=== Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel ===
&quot;Lectures on the Philosophy of World History&quot; bring together the theses of the philosophy of history that Hegel developed during his classes at the University of Berlin taught in the years 1822–1823, 1828 and 1830–1831. Editions of the work by Eduard Gans in 1837, Charles Hegel in 1840 and Georg Lasson in 1917 stand out. Hegel&#x27;s work presents a complex exposition of his theses, which can lead to more than one mistake. For this reason, a series of works have been written aimed at interpreting the writings of the German philosopher, including his philosophy of history, which has been considered one of his clearest works.

Hegel&#x27;s philosophy of history aimed for a philosophical reflection on world history, thinking about the history of humanity in all its spatial and temporal breadth. This Hegelian particularity, versus the works of historians, rests on the fact that the German philosopher sought to determine what the teleology of history was, particularly what the end of history was, and how that process would develop. With this end in mind, Hegel applied his philosophical system, both metaphysical and logical, to develop the thesis that the history of humanity consists of a rational process of constant progress towards freedom.

According to Hegelian philosophy, reason made a spatial transition from east to west, that is, from Asia to Europe. This transition of reason, says Hegel, is made explicit in the concept of freedom that each civilization developed in these spaces has had. Thus, in the east, the Chinese civilization, India, and the various civilizations of Mesopotamia were characterized by considering that freedom belonged to a single subject, that person being understood as the emperor or empress, the king or queen. The rest of the individuals in these civilizations are, according to Hegel, like children under the tutelage of a father. The second stage of this transition of freedom overcame the paternal stage. Greece and Rome, civilizations where freedom no longer belonged only to the head of the state, but also to a limited number of people who met certain requirements, that is, the citizens. Finally, the third stage, German-Christian Europe, reached a level of consciousness about freedom that maintains that it no longer belonged to one or a few; on the contrary, freedom was good for all human beings.

The reactions that Hegel&#x27;s thesis generated have been diverse. On the one hand, it is argued that Hegel&#x27;s contribution consisted of consolidating the philosophy of history as an independent and formal discipline of philosophy. On the other hand, it is argued that Hegel&#x27;s philosophy of history is an example of totalitarianism, racism, and Eurocentrism, widely debated criticisms.

=== Thomas Carlyle ===

After Hegel, who insisted on the role of &quot;great men&quot; in history, with his famous statement about Napoleon, &quot;I saw the Spirit on his horse&quot;, Thomas Carlyle argued that history was the biography of a few central individuals, heroes, such as Oliver Cromwell or Frederick the Great, writing that &quot;The History of the world is but the Biography of great men.&quot; His view of heroes included not only political and military figures, the founders or topplers of states, but artists, poets, theologians and other cultural leaders. His history of great men, of geniuses, sought to organize change in the advent of greatness.

Explicit defenses of Carlyle&#x27;s position have been rare since the late twentieth century. Most philosophers of history contend that the motive forces in history can best be described only with a wider lens than the one he used for his portraits. A.C. Danto, for example, wrote of the importance of the individual in history, but extended his definition to include &quot;social individuals&quot;, defined as &quot;individuals we may provisionally characterize as containing individual human beings amongst their parts. Examples of social individuals might be social classes [. . .], national groups [. . .], religious organizations [. . .], large-scale events [. . .], large-scale social movements [. . .], etc.&quot; The great man theory of history was most popular with professional historians in the nineteenth century; a popular work of this school is the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition&quot; (1911), which contains lengthy and detailed biographies about the great men of history.

After Marx&#x27;s conception of a materialist history based on the class struggle, which raised attention for the first time to the importance of social factors such as economics in the unfolding of history, Herbert Spencer wrote &quot;You must admit that the genesis of the great man depends on the long series of complex influences which has produced the race in which he appears, and the social state into which that race has slowly grown. . . . Before he can remake his society, his society must make him.&quot;

=== Social evolutionism ===
Inspired by the Enlightenment&#x27;s ideal of progress, social evolutionism became a popular conception in the nineteenth century. Auguste Comte&#x27;s (1798–1857) positivist conception of history, which he divided into the theological stage, the metaphysical stage and the positivist stage, brought upon by modern science, was one of the most influential doctrines of progress. The Whig interpretation of history, as it was later called, associated with scholars of the Victorian and Edwardian eras in Britain, such as Henry Maine or Thomas Macaulay, gives an example of such influence, by looking at human history as progress from savagery and ignorance toward peace, prosperity, and science. Maine described the direction of progress as &quot;from status to contract,&quot; from a world in which a child&#x27;s whole life is pre-determined by the circumstances of his birth, toward one of mobility and choice.

The publication of Darwin&#x27;s &quot;The Origin of Species&quot; in 1859 introduced human evolution. However, it was quickly transposed from its original biological field to the social field, in social Darwinist theories. Herbert Spencer, who coined the term &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;, or Lewis Henry Morgan in &quot;Ancient Society&quot; (1877) developed evolutionist theories independent from Darwin&#x27;s works, which would be later interpreted as social Darwinism. These nineteenth-century unilineal evolution theories claimed that societies start out in a primitive state and gradually become more civilised over time, and equated the culture and technology of Western civilisation with progress.

Arthur Gobineau&#x27;s &quot;An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races&quot; (1853–55) argued that race is &quot;the&quot; primary force determining world events, that there are intellectual differences between human races, and that civilizations decline and fall when the races are mixed. Gobineau&#x27;s works had a large popularity in the so-called scientific racism theories that developed during the New Imperialism period.

After the first world war, and even before Herbert Butterfield (1900–1979) harshly criticized it, the Whig interpretation had gone out of style. The bloodletting of that conflict had indicted the whole notion of linear progress. Paul Valéry famously said: &quot;We civilizations now know ourselves mortal.&quot;

However, the notion itself didn&#x27;t completely disappear. &quot;The End of History and the Last Man&quot; (1992) by Francis Fukuyama proposed a similar notion of progress, positing that the worldwide adoption of liberal democracies as the single accredited political system and even modality of human consciousness would represent the &quot;End of History&quot;. Fukuyama&#x27;s work stems from a Kojevian reading of Hegel&#x27;s &quot;Phenomenology of Spirit&quot; (1807).

Unlike Maurice Godelier who interprets history as a process of transformation, Tim Ingold suggests that history is a movement of autopoiesis.

A key component to making sense of all of this is to simply recognize that all these issues in social evolution merely serve to support the suggestion that how one considers the nature of history will impact the interpretation and conclusions drawn about history. The critical under-explored question is less about history as content and more about history as process.

In 2011 Steven Pinker wrote a history of violence and humanity from an evolutionary perspective in which he shows that violence has declined statistically over time.

== Contextual theories ==

As early as the 18th century, philosophers began focusing on contextual factors contributing to the course of history. Historians of the Annales School, founded in 1929 by Lucien Febvre and Marc Bloch, were a major landmark in the shift from a history centered on individual subjects to studies concentrating in geography, economics, demography, and other social forces. Fernand Braudel&#x27;s studies on the Mediterranean Sea as &quot;hero&quot; of history and Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie&#x27;s history of climate were inspired by this school.

=== Karl Marx ===
Karl Marx is often thought to be an exponent of economic determinism. For him social institutions like religion, culture and the political system were merely by-products of the underlying economic system. However, he did not see history as completely deterministic. His essay &quot;The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon&quot; contains the most famous formulation of Marx&#x27;s view of the role of the individual in history:

=== Michel Foucault ===
The historico-political discourse analyzed by Michel Foucault in &quot;Society Must Be Defended&quot; (1975–76) considers truth as the fragile product of a historical struggle, first conceptualized as race struggle—understood not in the modern sense of biological race but closer to that of a people or nation. Boulainvilliers, for example, was an exponent of nobility rights. He claimed that the French nobility were the racial descendants of the Franks who invaded France (while the Third Estate was descended from the conquered Gauls), and had right to power by virtue of right of conquest. He used this approach to formulate a historical thesis of the course of French political history—a critique of both the monarchy and the Third Estate. Foucault regards him as the founder of the historico-political discourse as political weapon.

In Great Britain, this historico-political discourse was used by the bourgeoisie, the people and the aristocracy as a means of struggle against the monarchy—cf. Edward Coke or John Lilburne. In France, Boulainvilliers, Nicolas Fréret, and then Sieyès, Augustin Thierry, and Cournot reappropriated this form of discourse. Finally, at the end of the nineteenth century, this discourse was incorporated by racialist biologists and eugenicists, who gave it the modern sense of race and, even more, transformed this popular discourse into a state racism in Nazism. Foucault also presents that Marxists too seized this discourse and took it in a different direction, transforming the essentialist notion of race into the historical notion of class struggle, defined by socially structured position. This displacement of discourse constitutes one of the bases of Foucault&#x27;s thought—that discourse is not tied to the subject, rather the subject is a construction of discourse. Moreover, discourse is not the simple ideological and mirror reflexion of an economic infrastructure, but is a product and the battlefield of multiples forces—which may not be reduced to the simple dualist contradiction of two energies.

Foucault shows that what specifies this discourse from the juridical and philosophical discourse is its conception of truth—that truth is no longer absolute, it is the product of race struggle. History itself, which was traditionally the sovereign&#x27;s science, the legend of his glorious feats and monument building, ultimately became the discourse of the people, thus a political stake. The subject is not any more a neutral arbitrator, judge, or legislator, as in Solon&#x27;s or Kant&#x27;s conceptions. Therefore, what became the historical subject must search in history&#x27;s furor, under the &quot;juridical code&#x27;s dried blood&quot;, the multiple contingencies from which a fragile rationality temporarily finally emerged. This may be, perhaps, compared to the sophist discourse in Ancient Greece. Foucault warns that it has nothing to do with Machiavelli&#x27;s or Hobbes&#x27;s discourse on war, for to this popular discourse, the sovereign is nothing more than &quot;an illusion, an instrument, or, at the best, an enemy. It is a discourse that beheads the king, anyway that dispenses itself from the sovereign and that denounces it&quot;.

== Other approaches ==

=== Narrative history ===
A current popular conception considers the value of narrative in the writing and experience of history. Important thinkers in this area include Paul Ricœur, Louis Mink, W.B. Gallie, and Hayden White. Some have doubted this approach because it draws fictional and historical narrative closer together, and there remains a perceived &quot;fundamental bifurcation between historical and fictional narrative&quot; (Ricœur, vol. 1, 52). In spite of this, most modern historians such as Barbara Tuchman or David McCullough consider narrative writing important to their approaches. The theory of narrated history (or historicized narrative) holds that the structure of lived experience, and such experience narrated in both fictional and non-fictional works (literature and historiography) have in common the figuration of &quot;temporal experience.&quot; In this way narrative can &quot;&#x27;grasp together&#x27; and integrate . . . into one whole and complete story&quot; the &quot;composite representations&quot; of historical experience (Ricœur x, 173). Louis Mink writes that &quot;the significance of past occurrences is understandable only as they are locatable in the ensemble of interrelationships that can be grasped only in the construction of narrative form&quot; (148). Marxist theorist Fredric Jameson also analyzes historical understanding this way, and writes that &quot;history is inaccessible to us except in textual form . . . it can be approached only by way of prior (re)textualization&quot; (82).

== Education and propaganda ==

Since Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;, civic education and instruction has had a central role in politics and the constitution of a common identity. History has thus sometimes become the target of propaganda, for example in historical revisionist attempts. Plato&#x27;s insistence on the importance of education was relayed by Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1762), a counterpart to &quot;The Social Contract&quot; (1762). Public education has been seen by republican regimes and the Enlightenment as a prerequisite of the masses&#x27; progressive emancipation, as conceived by Kant in &quot;Was Ist Aufklärung?&quot; (&quot;What Is Enlightenment?&quot;, 1784).

Modern education systems, instrumental in the construction of nation states, also involved the elaboration of a common, national history. History textbooks are one way through which this common history was transmitted. &quot;Le Tour de France par deux enfants&quot;, for example, was the French Third Republic&#x27;s classic textbook for elementary school: it described the story of two French children who, following the German annexation of the Alsace-Lorraine region in 1870, go on a &quot;tour de France&quot; during which they become aware of France&#x27;s diversity and the existence of the various &quot;patois&quot;.

<text>Cecil Percival Taylor (March 25, 1929April 5, 2018) was an American pianist and poet.

Taylor was classically trained and was one of the pioneers of free jazz. His music is characterized by an energetic, physical approach, resulting in complex improvisation often involving tone clusters and intricate polyrhythms. His technique has been compared to percussion. Referring to the number of keys on a standard piano, Val Wilmer used the phrase &quot;eighty-eight tuned drums&quot; to describe Taylor&#x27;s style. He has been referred to as &quot;Art Tatum with contemporary-classical leanings&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Cecil Percival Taylor was born on March 25, 1929, in Long Island City, Queens, and raised in Corona, Queens. As an only child to a middle-class family, Taylor&#x27;s mother Almeda Ragland Taylor encouraged him to play music at an early age. He began playing piano at age six and went on to study at the New York College of Music and New England Conservatory in Boston. At the New England Conservatory, Taylor majored in popular music arrangement. During his time there, he also became familiar with contemporary European art music. Bela Bartók and Karlheinz Stockhausen notably influenced his music.

In 1955, Taylor moved back to New York City from Boston. He formed a quartet with soprano saxophonist Steve Lacy, bassist Buell Neidlinger, and drummer Dennis Charles. Taylor&#x27;s first recording, &quot;Jazz Advance&quot;, featured Lacy and was released in 1956. The recording is described by Richard Cook and Brian Morton in the &quot;Penguin Guide to Jazz&quot;: &quot;While there are still many nods to conventional post-bop form in this set, it already points to the freedoms in which the pianist would later immerse himself.&quot; Taylor&#x27;s quartet featuring Lacy also appeared at the 1957 Newport Jazz Festival, which was made into the album &quot;At Newport&quot;. Taylor collaborated with saxophonist John Coltrane in 1958 on &quot;Stereo Drive&quot;, now available as &quot;Coltrane Time&quot;.

== 1950s and early 1960s ==
Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Taylor&#x27;s music grew more complex and moved away from existing jazz styles. Gigs were often hard to come by, and club owners found that Taylor&#x27;s approach of playing long pieces tended to impede business. His 1959 LP record &quot;Looking Ahead!&quot; showcased his innovation as a creator as compared to the jazz mainstream. Unlike others at the time, Taylor utilized virtuosic techniques and made swift stylistic shifts from phrase to phrase. These qualities, among others, still remained notable distinctions of his music for the rest of his life.

Landmark recordings, such as &quot;Unit Structures&quot; (1966), also appeared. Within the Cecil Taylor Unit (a distinction that was often used at performances and recordings between 1962 and 2006 for a shifting group of sidemen), musicians were able to develop new forms of conversational interplay. In the early 1960s, an uncredited Albert Ayler worked with Taylor, jamming and appearing on at least one recording, &quot;Four&quot;, which was unreleased until appearing on the 2004 Ayler box set &quot;Holy Ghost: Rare &amp; Unissued Recordings (1962–70)&quot;.

By 1961, Taylor was working regularly with alto saxophonist Jimmy Lyons, who would become one of his most important and consistent collaborators. Taylor, Lyons, and drummer Sunny Murray (and later Andrew Cyrille) formed the core personnel of the Cecil Taylor Unit, Taylor&#x27;s primary ensemble until Lyons&#x27; death in 1986. Lyons&#x27; playing, strongly influenced by jazz icon Charlie Parker, retained a strong blues sensibility and helped keep Taylor&#x27;s increasingly avant garde music tethered to the jazz tradition.

== Late 1960s and 1970s ==
Taylor began to perform solo concerts in the latter half of the 1960s. The first known recorded solo performance was &quot;Carmen With Rings&quot; (59 minutes) in De Doelen concert hall in Rotterdam on July 1, 1967. Two days earlier, Taylor had played the same composition in the Amsterdam Concertgebouw. Many of his later concerts were released on album and include &quot;Indent&quot; (1973), side one of &quot;Spring of Two Blue-J&#x27;s&quot; (1973), &quot;Silent Tongues&quot; (1974), &quot;Garden&quot; (1982), &quot;For Olim&quot; (1987), &quot;Erzulie Maketh Scent&quot; (1989), and &quot;The Tree of Life&quot; (1998). He began to garner critical and popular acclaim, playing for Jimmy Carter on the White House Lawn, lecturing as an artist-in-residence at universities, and eventually being awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1973.

In 1976, Taylor directed a production of Adrienne Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;A Rat&#x27;s Mass&quot; at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club in the East Village of Manhattan. His production combined the original script with a chorus of orchestrated voices used as instruments. Jimmy Lyons, Rashid Bakr, Andy Bey, Karen Borca, David S. Ware, and Raphe Malik performed in the production as the Cecil Taylor Unit, among other musicians and actors.

== 1980s, 1990s, and the Feel Trio ==
Following Lyons&#x27; death in 1986, Taylor formed the Feel Trio in the late 1980s with William Parker on bass and Tony Oxley on drums. The group can be heard on &quot;Celebrated Blazons&quot;, &quot;Looking (Berlin Version) The Feel Trio&quot; and the 10-disc set &quot;2 Ts for a Lovely T&quot;. Compared to his prior groups with Lyons, the Feel Trio had a more abstract approach, tethered less to jazz tradition and more aligned with the ethos of European free improvisation. He also performed with larger ensembles and big band projects.

Taylor&#x27;s extended residence in Berlin in 1988 was documented by the German label FMP, resulting in a box set of performances in duet and trio with a large number of European free improvisors, including Oxley, Derek Bailey, Evan Parker, Han Bennink, Tristan Honsinger, Louis Moholo, and Paul Lovens. Most of his later recordings have been released on European labels, with the exception of &quot;Momentum Space&quot; (a meeting with Dewey Redman and Elvin Jones) on Verve/Gitanes. The classical label Bridge released his 1998 Library of Congress performance &quot;Algonquin&quot;, a duet with violinist Mat Maneri.

Taylor continued to perform for capacity audiences around the world with live concerts, usually playing his favored instrument, a Bösendorfer piano featuring nine extra lower-register keys. In 1987, he toured England with Australian pianist Roger Woodward, presenting recitals on which Woodward played solo works by Xenakis, Takemitsu, and Feldman, followed by Taylor, also playing solo. A documentary on Taylor, entitled &quot;All the Notes&quot;, was released on DVD in 2006 by director Chris Felver. Taylor was also featured in a 1981 documentary film entitled &quot;Imagine the Sound&quot;, in which he discusses and performs his music, poetry, and dance. In 1993, he was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship.

== 2000s ==
Taylor recorded sparingly in the 2000s, but continued to perform with his own ensembles (the Cecil Taylor Ensemble and the Cecil Taylor Big Band) and with other musicians such as Joe Locke, Max Roach, and Amiri Baraka. In 2004, the Cecil Taylor Big Band at the Iridium Jazz Club was nominated a best performance of 2004 by All About Jazz. The Cecil Taylor Trio was nominated for the same at the Highline Ballroom in 2009. The trio consisted of Taylor, Albey Balgochian, and Jackson Krall. In 2010, Triple Point Records released a deluxe limited-edition double LP titled &quot;Ailanthus/Altissima: Bilateral Dimensions of 2 Root Songs&quot;, a set of duos with Taylor&#x27;s longtime collaborator Tony Oxley that was recorded live at the Village Vanguard.

In 2013, he was awarded the Kyoto Prize for Music. He was described as &quot;An Innovative Jazz Musician Who Has Fully Explored the Possibilities of Piano Improvisation&quot;. In 2014, his career and 85th birthday were honored at the Painted Bride Art Center in Philadelphia with the tribute concert event &quot;Celebrating Cecil&quot;. In 2016, Taylor received a retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art entitled &quot;Open Plan: Cecil Taylor&quot;.

In 2008, Taylor performed with Pauline Oliveros at the Curtis R Priem Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The concert was recorded and is available on a DVD which also features a 75-minute video of a Taylor poetry recital entitled &quot;Floating Gardens: The Poetry Of Cecil Taylor&quot;. Taylor, along with dancer Min Tanaka, was the subject of Amiel Courtin-Wilson&#x27;s 2016 documentary film &quot;The Silent Eye&quot;.

== Ballet and dance ==
In addition to piano, Taylor was always interested in ballet and dance. His mother, who died while he was young, was a dancer and played the piano and violin. Taylor once said: &quot;I try to imitate on the piano the leaps in space a dancer makes.&quot; He collaborated with dancer Dianne McIntyre from the mid 1970s to the early 1980s. In 1979, he composed and played the music for a 12-minute ballet, &quot;Tetra Stomp: Eatin&#x27; Rain in Space&quot;, featuring Mikhail Baryshnikov and Heather Watts.

== Poetry ==
Taylor was a poet, and cited Robert Duncan, Charles Olson, and Amiri Baraka as major influences. He often integrated his poems into his musical performances, and they frequently appear in the liner notes of his albums. The album &quot;Chinampas&quot;, released by Leo Records in 1987, is a recording of Taylor reciting several of his poems while accompanying himself on percussion. His poetry was likened to his music primarily by the ways in which Taylor alteres and transforms material both linguistic and musical.

== Musical style and legacy ==
According to Steven Block, free jazz originated with Taylor&#x27;s performances at the Five Spot Cafe in 1957 and with Ornette Coleman in 1959. In 1964, Taylor co-founded the Jazz Composers Guild to enhance opportunities for avant-garde jazz musicians.

Taylor&#x27;s style and methods have been described as &quot;constructivist&quot;. Despite Scott Yanow&#x27;s warning regarding Taylor&#x27;s &quot;forbidding music&quot; (&quot;Suffice it to say that Cecil Taylor&#x27;s music is not for everyone&quot;), he praises Taylor&#x27;s &quot;remarkable technique and endurance&quot;, and his &quot;advanced&quot;, &quot;radical&quot;, &quot;original&quot;, and uncompromising &quot;musical vision&quot;.

This musical vision is a large part of Taylor&#x27;s legacy:
== Personal life and death ==
Taylor moved to Fort Greene, Brooklyn, in 1983. He died at his Brooklyn residence on April 5, 2018, at the age of 89. At the time of his death, Taylor was working on an autobiography and future concerts, among other projects.

<text>Jumbo (December 25, 1860 – September 15, 1885), also known as Jumbo the Elephant and Jumbo the Circus Elephant, was a 19th-century male African bush elephant born in Sudan. Jumbo was exported to Jardin des Plantes, a zoo in Paris, and then transferred in 1865 to London Zoo in England. Despite public protest, Jumbo was sold to P. T. Barnum, who took him to the United States for exhibition in March 1882.

The elephant&#x27;s name spawned the common word &quot;&quot;, meaning large in size. Examples of his lexical impact are phrases like &quot;jumbo jet&quot;, &quot;jumbo shrimp&quot;, and &quot;jumbotron&quot;. Jumbo&#x27;s shoulder height has been estimated to have been at the time of his death, and was claimed to be about by Barnum. &quot;Jumbo&quot; has been the mascot of Tufts University for over one hundred years.

==History==
Jumbo was born around December 25, 1860, in Sudan, and after his mother was killed by poachers, the infant Jumbo was captured by Sudanese elephant poacher Taher Sheriff and German big-game poacher Johann Schmidt. The calf was sold to Lorenzo Casanova, an Italian animal dealer and explorer. Casanova transported the animals that he had bought from Sudan north to Suez, and then across the Mediterranean Sea to Trieste.
This collection was sold to Gottlieb Christian Kreutzberg&#x27;s &quot;Menagerie Kreutzberg&quot; in Germany. Soon after, the elephant was imported to France and kept in the Paris zoo Jardin des Plantes. In 1865, he was transferred to the London Zoo and arrived on 26 June. In the following years, Jumbo became a crowd favorite due to his size, and would give rides to children on his back, including those of Queen Victoria.

While in London, Jumbo broke both tusks, and when they regrew, he ground them down against the stonework of his enclosure. His keeper in London was Matthew Scott, whose 1885 autobiography details his life with Jumbo.
In 1882, Abraham Bartlett, superintendent of the London zoo, sparked national controversy with his decision to sell Jumbo to the American entertainer Phineas T. Barnum of the Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus for £2,000 (US$10,000). This decision came as a result of concern surrounding Jumbo&#x27;s growing aggression and potential to cause a public disaster. The sale of Jumbo, however, sent the citizens of London into a panic, because they viewed the transaction as an enormous loss for the British empire. 100,000 school children wrote to Queen Victoria begging her not to sell the elephant. 
John Ruskin, a fellow of the Zoological Society, wrote in &quot;The Morning Post&quot; in February 1882: &quot;I, for one of the said fellows, am not in the habit of selling my old pets or parting with my old servants because I find them subject occasionally, perhaps even &quot;periodically,&quot; to fits of ill temper; and I not only &quot;regret&quot; the proceedings of the council, but disclaim them utterly, as disgraceful to the city of London and dishonourable to common humanity.&quot; Despite a lawsuit against the Zoological Gardens alleging the sale was in violation of multiple zoo bylaws, and the zoo&#x27;s attempt to renege on the sale, the court upheld the sale. Matthew Scott elected to go with Jumbo to the United States. The London-based newspaper &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; begged Barnum to lay down terms on which he would return Jumbo; however, no such terms existed in the eyes of Barnum.

In New York, Barnum exhibited Jumbo at Madison Square Garden, earning enough in three weeks from the enormous crowds to recoup the money he spent to buy the animal. In the 31-week season, the circus earned $1.75M, largely due to its star attraction. On May 17, 1884, Jumbo was one of Barnum&#x27;s 21 elephants that crossed the Brooklyn Bridge to demonstrate that it was safe, a year after 15 people died during a stampede precipitated by fear that the bridge might collapse. On July 6, 1885, Jumbo was paraded in Saint John, New Brunswick, celebrating his first appearance in Canada.

==Death==


Jumbo died at a railway classification yard in St. Thomas, Ontario, Canada, on September 15, 1885. In those days, the circus crisscrossed North America by train. St. Thomas was the perfect location for a circus because many rail lines converged there. Jumbo and the other animals had finished their performances that night, and as they were being led to their box car, a train came down the track. Jumbo was hit and mortally wounded, dying within minutes.

Barnum told the (possibly fictional) story that Tom Thumb, a young circus elephant, was walking on the railroad tracks and Jumbo was attempting to lead him to safety. Barnum claimed that the locomotive hit and killed Tom Thumb before it derailed and hit Jumbo, and other witnesses supported Barnum&#x27;s account. According to newspapers, the freight train hit Jumbo directly, killing him, while Tom Thumb suffered a broken leg.

Many metallic objects were found in the elephant&#x27;s stomach, including English pennies, keys, rivets, and a police whistle.

Ever the showman, Barnum had portions of his star attraction separated, to have multiple sites attracting curious spectators. After touring with Barnum&#x27;s circus, the skeleton was donated to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, where it remains. The elephant&#x27;s heart was sold to Burt Green Wilder of Cornell University, and had been lost by the 1940s. Jumbo&#x27;s hide was stuffed by William J. Critchley and Carl Akeley, both of Ward&#x27;s Natural Science, who stretched it during the mounting process; the mounted specimen traveled with Barnum&#x27;s circus for two years.

Barnum eventually donated the stuffed Jumbo to Tufts University, where it was displayed at P.T. Barnum Hall there for many years. The hide was destroyed in a fire in April 1975. Ashes from that fire, which are believed to contain the elephant&#x27;s remains, are kept in a 14-ounce Peter Pan Crunchy Peanut Butter jar in the office of the Tufts athletic director, while his taxidermied tail, removed during earlier renovations, resides in the holdings of the Tufts Digital Collections and Archives. Jumbo is the official Tufts University athletic mascot.

==Legacy==

Remaining in the United Kingdom are statues and other memorabilia of Jumbo. The elephant – or rather his statuette in the Natural History Museum – was made holotype of Richard Lydekker&#x27;s proposed subspecies (&quot;Loxodonta africana rothschildi&quot;) for the large elephants of the eastern Sahel. Modern authorities do not recognize this (or any other subspecies of African bush elephants), considering its purportedly diagnostic large size and peculiarly shaped ears to be individual variation.

While Jumbo&#x27;s hide resided at Tufts&#x27; P.T. Barnum Hall, a superstition held that dropping a coin into a nostril of the trunk would bring good luck on an examination or sports event. Although the hide was destroyed by a major fire, Jumbo remains the mascot of Tufts, and representations of the elephant are featured prominently throughout the campus.
A life-sized statue of the elephant was erected in 1985 in St. Thomas, Ontario, to commemorate the centennial of the elephant&#x27;s death. It is located on Talbot Street on the west side of the city. In 2006 the Jumbo statue was inducted into the North America Railway Hall of Fame in the category of &quot;Railway Art Forms &amp; Events&quot; as having local significance.
St. Thomas&#x27;s Railway City Brewery sells an IPA beer named Dead Elephant.

Jumbo was the inspiration of the nickname of the 19th-century Jumbo Water Tower in the town of Colchester in Essex, England.

Jumbo is referenced by a plaque outside the old Liberal Hall, now a Wetherspoons pub, in Crediton, United Kingdom.

Lucy the Elephant, a six-story structure in Margate City, New Jersey, was modeled after Jumbo. Built by James V. Lafferty in 1881, Lucy is the oldest surviving roadside tourist attraction in America and a National Historic Landmark. Lafferty also made other Jumbo-shaped structures, including Elephantine Colossus, on Coney Island.

Jumbo has been lionized on a series of sheet-music covers from roughly 1882–83. The four-colour lithograph of Jumbo was created by Alfred Concanen of England, with the music title &quot;Why Part With Jumbo&quot;, a song by the &quot;lion comique&quot; of Victorian British music halls, G. H. MacDermott. It pictured children zoo visitors riding, somewhat precariously, on Jumbo&#x27;s back. Multiple American lithographic music covers were done, including by J. H. Bufford&#x27;s Sons.

Canadian folk singer James Gordon wrote the song &quot;Jumbo&#x27;s Last Ride&quot;, which recounts the story of Jumbo&#x27;s life and death. It is on his 1999 CD &quot;Pipe Street Dreams&quot;.

Canadian professional ice hockey player Joe Thornton (b. 1979) from St. Thomas, Ontario is nicknamed Jumbo Joe as a homage to Jumbo.

The 1941 animated film &quot;Dumbo&quot; released by Walt Disney Animation Studios was inspired by the story of Jumbo and is regarded as one of the greatest animated films of all time. Despite the film being fictional, many people have speculated that Jumbo might have been the title character&#x27;s father.

==Examination of Jumbo&#x27;s skeleton==

A television program about Jumbo, &quot;Attenborough and the Giant Elephant&quot;, presented by the naturalist and broadcaster David Attenborough, was transmitted on BBC One in the United Kingdom on 10 December 2017. An international team of scientists examined the skeleton and found:
* Jumbo&#x27;s molar teeth were malformed and out of line as a result of a long-term soft diet that did not wear his molar teeth down enough, obstructing the forward eruptive movement of the next molar.
* Jumbo&#x27;s nightly rages were probably caused by toothache, rather than musth, as his keeper thought at the time.
* A &quot;post mortem&quot; photograph of Jumbo shows skin abrasions consistent with an illustration produced just after his death of the freight train hitting him on a hip from behind as he was being led across to his traveling carriage, and said that the likeliest cause of death was internal bleeding from his injuries.
* Examination of Jumbo&#x27;s limb bones showed overgrown tendon attachment areas consistent with a long-term history of being overloaded at his work.
* Jumbo was still growing at the time of his death, as is normal for African male elephants of his age, and might eventually have attained the size claimed by Barnum.

<doc id="177451" wikidata="Q277188" url="?curid=177451" title="Spetsnaz">
<text>Spetsnaz () are special forces in many post-Soviet states. Historically, this term referred to the Soviet Union&#x27;s Spetsnaz GRU, special operations units of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Soviet General Staff (GRU). Today it refers to special forces branches and task forces subordinate to ministries including defence, internal affairs, or emergency situations in countries that have inherited their special purpose units from the now-defunct Soviet security agencies.

As &quot;spetsnaz&quot; is a Russian term, it is typically associated with the special units of Russia, but other post-Soviet states often refer to their special forces units by the term as well, since these nations also inherited their special purpose units from the now-defunct Soviet security agencies.

==Etymology==
The Russian abbreviations &quot;spetsnaz&quot; and &quot;osnaz&quot; are syllabic abbreviations of Soviet era Russian, for &quot;spetsialnogo naznacheniya&quot; and &quot;osobogo naznacheniya&quot;, both of which may be interpreted as &quot;special purpose&quot;. As syllabic acronyms they are not normally capitalized.

In Ukrainian they are known as &quot;spetspryz&quot; (), an abbreviation of &quot;viiska spetsiialnoho pryznachennia&quot; ().

They are general terms that were used for a variety of Soviet special operations (&quot;spetsoperatsiya&quot;) units. In addition, many &quot;Cheka&quot; and Internal Troops units (such as &quot;OMSDON&quot; and &quot;ODON&quot;) also included &quot;osobovo naznacheniya&quot; in their full names. Regular forces assigned to special tasks were sometimes also referred to by terms such as &quot;Spetsnaz&quot; and &quot;osnaz&quot;.

&quot;Spetsnaz&quot; later referred specifically to special (&quot;spetsialnogo&quot;) purpose (&quot;naznacheniya&quot;) or special operations (spetsoperatsiya; &quot;spec ops&quot;) forces, and the word&#x27;s widespread use is a relatively recent, post-&quot;perestroika&quot; development in Russian language. The Soviet public used to know very little about their country&#x27;s special forces until many state secrets were disclosed under the &quot;glasnost&quot; (&quot;openness&quot;) policy of Mikhail Gorbachev during the late 1980s. Since then, stories about &quot;spetsnaz&quot; and their purportedly incredible prowess, from the serious to the highly questionable, have captivated the imagination of Russians. A number of books about the Soviet military special forces, such as 1987&#x27;s &quot;Spetsnaz: The Story Behind the Soviet SAS&quot; by defected GRU agent Viktor Suvorov, helped introduce the term to the Western public.

==History and known operations==
The Imperial Russian Army had hunter-commando units, formed by a decree of Emperor Alexander III in 1886, which saw action in World War I prior to the Russian Revolution of 1917. Also, during World War I, General Aleksei Brusilov became one of the first senior commanders to use the tactics of fast action shock troops for assaults following concentrated accurate artillery fire in what would later be known as the Brusilov Offensive of 1916. Such tactics, considered revolutionary at the time, would later inspire people like Prussian Captain Willy Rohr in the development of the Prussian Stormtroopers (founded in 1915).

===Early Soviet Union===

The origins of the Spetsnaz can be found in the Russian Civil War. To act against anti-Communist workers and farmers, the Soviet regime set up so called &quot;Tschasti Osobogo Nasatschenia&quot; (Units for special use) in 1918. In the next year they were expanded to the so-called &quot;Cheka&quot; (The All-Russian Extraordinary Commission), fighting counterrevolution and (alleged) sabotage. They took part in the Kronstadt rebellion 1921, setting up machine guns behind units of the Red Army, to &quot;increase their motivation&quot;. The &quot;GRU&quot; and &quot;NKVD&quot; descended from the &quot;Cheka.&quot; Since 1927 Russians were experimenting with parachutes. Airborne units were used against central Asian and Afghan insurgents.

===Second World War and Spanish Civil War===

GRU and NKVD derived from the &quot;Cheka&quot; and participated in the Spanish Civil War fighting fascists behind their lines using guerilla strategies. Fighting Germany, Japan, Poland and Finland in the Second World War, new units of storm pioneers, parachuters, NKVD and GRU were set up. Thereby the soviets merged existing experiences and started to unify different military branches.

==== Navy ====
The Soviet leadership had an urgent need for intelligence on German land forces in northern Norway and Finland. On 5 July 1941 Admiral Arseniy Golovko of the Northern Fleet authorized the formation of a ground reconnaissance detachment. This unit, the 4th Special Volunteer Detachment, was to be recruited from the fleet&#x27;s athletes and have an initial size of 65 to 70 personnel. Later the unit was renamed the 181st Special Reconnaissance Detachment. They were trained as frogmen. The most prominent of these new recruits was Viktor Leonov, who joined the Soviet Navy in 1937. He was assigned to a submarine training detachment and then transferred to a repair station in the Northern Fleet at Polyarnyy. Leonov had trained as a scuba diver, after which he joined 4th Special Volunteer Detachment, where he proved his daring and leadership skills conducting numerous clandestine operations and twice being awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.

Initially the unit was confined to performing small scale reconnaissance missions, platoon sized insertions by sea and on occasion on land into Finland and later Norway. They began conducting sabotage missions and raids to snatch prisoners for interrogation. They would also destroy German ammunition and supply depots, communication centers, and harass enemy troop concentrations along the Finnish and Russian coasts. When the European conflict ended, the Naval Scouts were sent to fight the Japanese. Leonov along with Capt. Kulebyakin and 140 men, landed on a Japanese airfield at Port Vonsan, unaware that they were opposed by over 3,500 enemy soldiers. A tense standoff ensued, until the commanding officers of the unit managed to bluff the Japanese forces into surrendering.

==== Army ====
Each Soviet front/army up to 1942 had their own independent guard-battalion (&quot;Otdelnly Gwardieskij Batalion Minerow), OGBM,&quot; so called miners, for reconnaissance and commando missions. The soldiers had to be younger than 30, were mostly athletes or hunters and had to identify 100% with their mission. Many exhausted and wounded soldiers were, even in training, left to their own devices. The selection methods qualified the troops as elite but caused high numbers of casualties. The &quot;miners&quot; infiltrated foreign-occupied areas by air and land, and cooperated with, and trained, local partisans.

Immediately before the major Russian offensive at Smolesk in 1943, 316 &quot;OGBM&quot; were dropped by parachute in nine groups. Up to 300 km behind the enemy lines, they blew up 700 km of railways in cooperation with local partisans, using 3,500 explosive charges.

=== Cold War ===

By the end of the Second World War the Soviet Union dissolved most of the special units. At the end of the 1950s the KGB and GRU set new special forces units up. The 3rd guard special-reconnaissance-brigade was founded in 1966, being stationed with the Soviet forces in East Germany in Fürstenberg/Havel.

==== The Crabb Affair ====
Lieutenant-Commander Lionel Crabb was a British Royal Navy frogman and MI6 diver who vanished during a reconnaissance mission around a Soviet cruiser berthed at Portsmouth Dockyard in 1956. In November 2007 the BBC and the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; reported that Eduard Koltsov, a former Soviet frogman, claimed to have caught Crabb placing a mine on the &quot;Ordzhonikidze&quot; hull near the ammunition depot and cut his throat. In an interview for a Russian documentary film, Koltsov showed the dagger he allegedly used, as well as an Order of the Red Star medal that Koltsov claimed to have been awarded for the deed. Koltsov, 74 at the time of the interview, stated that he wanted to clear his conscience and uncover what exactly had happened to Crabb. Peter Mercer of the Special Boat Service describes this incident in his autobiography: &quot;The cruiser [Ordzhonikidze] was carrying the two Soviet leaders, Khrushchev and Bulganin, on a goodwill visit to Britain. His [Crabb&#x27;s] task was to measure the cruiser&#x27;s propeller and to discover how the ship managed to travel at twice the speed originally estimated by British naval intelligence.&quot;

==== Prague Spring ====

The Warsaw pact invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968 to stop the &quot;Socialism with a Human Face&quot; movement. Spetsnaz units secured key points in the capital, Prague, seizing the airport, bridges, radio stations and the president&#x27;s palace.

==== Spetsnaz in Vietnam and Laos ====

Some 3,300 Soviet military experts, among them spetsnaz, were sent to Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War. Within South Vietnam, rumors persisted for years that men with blue eyes were reportedly spotted doing recon missions and testing their new SVD Dragunov sniper rifles. John Stryker Meyer was with Studies and Observation Group RT Idaho and had two encounters with what they believed were spetsnaz units operating in Laos in 1968.

Their mission was twofold: first of all, to help a communist nation defeat an American ally, and secondly, test and evaluate their most sophisticated radars and missiles directly against the best aircraft America could deploy. Soviets recovered at least two very important pieces of American equipment, a cryptographic code machine, and an F-111A escape capsule, which now sits in a Moscow Museum.

==== Soviet–Afghan War ====
Soviet Spetsnaz forces took part in the Soviet–Afghan War of 1979–1989 in Afghanistan, usually fighting fast insertion/extraction-type warfare with helicopters. Their most famous operation, Operation Storm-333, was executed on 27 December 1979 which saw Soviet special forces storming the Tajbeg Palace in Afghanistan and killing Afghan President Hafizullah Amin, his son and over 300 of his personal guards in 40 minutes. The Soviets then installed Babrak Karmal as Amin&#x27;s successor.

The operation involved approximately 660 Soviet operators dressed in Afghan uniforms, including ca. 50 KGB and GRU officers from the &quot;Alpha Group&quot; and &quot;Zenith Group&quot;. The Soviet forces occupied major governmental, military and media buildings in Kabul, including their primary target – the Tajbeg Palace.

In the first one and a half years of the war, Spetsnaz units in the form of the 459th special forces company, were exclusively responsible for reconnaissance missions and intelligence gathering for the 40th Army. Aside from reconnaissance, the 459th was also tasked with capturing prisoners, kidnapping enemy agents, and targeted assassination of leaders and field commanders of the Mujahideen.

===== Caravan war =====
By 1985, the GRU had expanded its special forces footprint to two Spetsnaz brigades in Afghanistan, comprising just under 5,000 troops. These were the:

15th Special Purpose Brigade – paired up and supported by 239th Helicopter Squadron equipped with Mi-24 (16 units), Mi-8 (16 units), deployment in Ghazni.
* 154th Oospn
* 177th Oospn

The Spetsnaz often conducted missions to ambush and destroy enemy supply convoys. The Mujahideen had great respect for the Spetsnaz, seeing them as a much more difficult opponent than the typical Soviet conscript soldier. They said that the Spetsnaz-led air assault operations had changed the complexion of the war. They also credited the Spetsnaz with closing down all the supply routes along the Afghan-Pakistani border in 1986. In April 1986, the rebels lost one of their biggest bases, at Zhawar in Paktia Province, to a Soviet spetsnaz air-assault. The Spetsnaz achieved victory by knocking out several rebel positions above the base, a mile-long series of fortified caves in a remote canyon. A successful long-term campaign codenamed Operation &quot;Curtain&quot; or &quot;Veil&quot;, lasted from 1984 to 1988, which aimed to close off the Afghan-Pakistani border and cut off supply routes coming in from Pakistan. The operation caused great distress to the mujahedin war effort, with Spetsnaz units intercepting 990 supply caravans and killing 17,000 insurgents. For their role in &quot;Operation Curtain&quot;, the Spetsnaz suffered a total of 570 killed with a further 11 missing. Casualty breakdown by unit was:
* 15th Spetsnaz Brigade – 355 killed and 10 missing.
* 22nd Spetsnaz Brigade – 199 killed and one missing.
* 459th Spetsnaz Company – 16 killed.
In May 1986, the Spetsnaz also succeeded in inserting air-assault forces into remote regions in Konar Valley near Barikot which were previously considered inaccessible to Soviet forces.

===== Alleged conflict with Pakistani commandos =====

It is believed that during the war in Afghanistan, Soviet special forces came in direct conflict with Pakistan Army&#x27;s special forces, the Special Service Group. This unit was deployed disguised as Afghans, supporting the Mujahideen fighting the Soviets. A battle reported as having been fought between the Pakistanis and Soviet troops took place in Kunar Province in March 1986. According to Soviet sources, the battle was actually fought between the GRU&#x27;s 15th Spetsnaz Brigade, and the Usama Bin Zaid regiment of Afghan Mujahideen under Commander Assadullah, belonging to Abdul rub a-Rasul Sayyaf&#x27;s faction.
Fighting is also alleged to have taken place during Operation Magistral where over 200 Mujahideen were killed in a failed attempt to capture the strategic Hill 3234 near the Pakistani border from a 39-man Soviet Airborne company.

==== The Beirut hostage crisis ====
In October 1985, specialist operators from the KGB&#x27;s Group &quot;A&quot; (&quot;Alpha&quot;) were dispatched to Beirut, Lebanon. The Kremlin had been informed of the kidnapping of four Soviet diplomats by the militant group, the Islamic Liberation Organization (a radical offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood). It was believed that this was retaliation for the Soviet support of Syrian involvement in the Lebanese Civil War. However, by the time the Alpha group arrived, one of the hostages had already been killed. In a tit-for-tat response, Alpha group operators first identified the terrorists using local sources, then moved into the Lebanese villages where the terrorists were from and took their relatives as hostages. Some of the hostages were dismembered, and their body parts sent to the hostage takers, with the threat that their relatives were next. The remaining hostages were released immediately.

Russian sources indicate that the release of the Soviet hostages was the result of extensive diplomatic negotiations with the spiritual leader of Hezbollah, Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah, who appealed to King Hussein of Jordan and the leaders of Libya and Iran to use their influence on the kidnappers.

Either way, the show of brutal force had its effect, and for the next 20 years no Soviet or Russian officials were taken captive, until June 2006.

===After the breakup of Soviet Union===

After the collapse of the USSR, spetsnaz forces of the Soviet Union&#x27;s newly formed republics took part in many local conflicts such as the Tajikistani Civil War, Chechen Wars, Russo-Georgian War and the Russo-Ukrainian War. Spetsnaz forces also have been called upon to resolve several high-profile hostage situations such as the Moscow theatre hostage crisis and the Beslan school hostage crisis.

====Budyonnovsk hospital hostage crisis====

The crisis took place from 14 to 19 June 1995, when a group of 80 to 200 Chechen terrorists led by Shamil Basayev attacked the southern Russian city of Budyonnovsk, where they stormed the main police station and the city hall. After several hours of fighting and Russian reinforcements imminent, the Chechens retreated to the residential district and regrouped in the city hospital, where they took between 1,500 and 1,800 hostages, most of them civilians (including about 150 children and a number of women with newborn infants).

After three days of siege, the Russian authorities ordered the security forces to retake the hospital compound. The forces deployed were elite personnel from the Federal Security Service&#x27;s Alpha Group, alongside MVD militsiya and Internal Troops. The strike force attacked the hospital compound at dawn on the fourth day, meeting fierce resistance. After several hours of fighting in which many hostages were killed by crossfire, a local ceasefire was agreed, and 227 hostages were released; 61 others were freed by the Russian forces.

A second Russian attack on the hospital a few hours later also failed and so did a third, resulting in even more casualties. The Russian authorities accused the Chechens of using the hostages as human shields.

According to official figures, 129 civilians were killed and 415 were injured in the entire event (of whom 18 later died of their wounds). This includes at least 105 hostage fatalities. However, according to an independent estimate 166 hostages were killed and 541 injured in the special forces attack on the hospital. At least 11 Russian police officers and 14 soldiers were killed. Basayev&#x27;s force suffered 11 men killed and one missing; most of their bodies were returned to Chechnya in a special freezer truck. In the years following the hostage-taking, more than 40 of the surviving attackers were tracked down and have been assassinated, including Aslambek Abdulkhadzhiev in 2002 and Shamil Basayev in 2006, and more than 20 were sentenced, by the Stavropol territorial court, to various terms of imprisonment.

====Kizlyar-Pervomayskoye hostage crisis====

The mass sieges which saw people taken in the thousands also involved FSB&#x27;s Alpha Group and the Spetsnaz GRU in attempted rescuing of the hostages.

==== Second Chechen War ====

Russian special forces were instrumental in Russia&#x27;s and the Kremlin backed government&#x27;s success in the Second Chechen War after learning lessons from the mishandling of the first war. Under joint command of &quot;Unified Group of Troops (OGV)&quot; formed on 23 September 1999. GRU, FSB and MVD spetsnaz operators conducted a myriad of counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism operations, including targeted killings of separatist leadership, in the meantime inflicting heavy casualties among Islamist separatists. Some of these successful missions were directed against separatist leaders such as Aslan Maskhadov, Abdul Halim Sadulayev, Dokka Umarov, Akhmadov brothers, Turpal-Ali Atgeriyev, Akhmed Avtorkhanov, Ibn al-Khattab, Abu al-Walid, Abu Hafs al-Urduni, Muhannad, Ali Taziev, Supyan Abdullayev, Shamil Basayev, Ruslan Gelayev, Salman Raduyev, Sulim Yamadayev, Rappani Khalilov, Yassir al-Sudani. During these missions, many operators received honors for their courage and prowess in combat, including with the title Hero of the Russian Federation. At least 106 FSB and GRU operators died during the conflict.

====Moscow theatre hostage crisis====
The crisis was the seizure of the crowded Dubrovka Theatre on 23 October 2002 by 40 to 50 armed Chechens who claimed allegiance to the Islamist militant separatist movement in Chechnya. They took 850 hostages and demanded the withdrawal of Russian forces from Chechnya and an end to the Second Chechen War. The siege was officially led by Movsar Barayev.

Due to the disposition of the theatre, special forces would have had to fight through of corridor and attack up a well defended staircase, before they could reach the hall in where the hostages were held. The terrorists also had explosive devices. The most powerful of these was in the center of the auditorium; if detonated, it could have brought down the ceiling and caused casualties in excess of 80% of the auditorium&#x27;s occupants. After a two-and-a-half-day siege and the execution of two hostages, spetsnaz operators from the Federal Security Service (FSB) Alpha and Vympel a.k.a. Vega Groups, supported by the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) SOBR unit, pumped an undisclosed chemical agent into the building&#x27;s ventilation system and raided it.

During the raid, all of the attackers were killed, with no casualties among spetsnaz, but about 130 hostages, including nine foreigners, died due to poor first aid after falling unconscious from the gas. Most died after being evacuated from the theatre and laid outside on their backs instead of in the approved recovery position and then choking to death. Russian security agencies refused to disclose the gas used in the attack leading to doctors in local hospitals being unable to respond adequately to the influx of casualties. All but two of the hostages who died during the siege were killed by the toxic substance pumped into the theatre to subdue the militants. The use of the gas was widely condemned as heavy-handed.

Physicians in Moscow condemned the refusal to disclose the identity of the gas that prevented them from saving more lives. Some reports said the drug naloxone was used to save some hostages.

====Beslan school siege====
Also referred to as the Beslan massacre started on 1 September 2004, lasted three days and involved the capture of over 1,100 people as hostages (including 777 children), ending with the death of 334 people. The event led to security and political repercussions in Russia; in the aftermath of the crisis, there has been an increase in Ingush–Ossetian ethnic hostility, while contributing to a series of federal government reforms consolidating power in the Kremlin and strengthening of the powers of the President of Russia.

The crisis began when a group of armed radical Islamist combatants, mostly Ingush and Chechen, occupied School Number One (SNO) in the town of Beslan, North Ossetia (an autonomous republic in the North Caucasus region of the Russian Federation) on 1 September 2004. The hostage-takers were the Riyadus-Salikhin Battalion, sent by the Chechen terrorist warlord Shamil Basayev, who demanded recognition of the independence of Chechnya at the United Nations and the withdrawal of Russian forces from Chechnya.

On the third day of the standoff, counter terrorism units stormed the building using heavy weapons after several explosions rocked the building and children started escaping. It was in this chaos most of the officers were killed, trying to protect escaping children from gun fire. At least 334 hostages were killed as a result of the crisis, including 186 children. Official reports on how many members of Russia&#x27;s special forces died in the fighting varied from 11, 12, 16 (7 Alpha and 9 Vega) to more than 20 killed. There are only 10 names on the special forces monument in Beslan. The fatalities included all three commanders of the assault group: Colonel Oleg Ilyin, Lieutenant Colonel Dmitry Razumovsky of Vega, and Major Alexander Perov of Alpha. At least 30 commandos suffered serious wounds.

== 2000&#x27;s-present ==

By the mid-2000s, the special forces gained a firm upper hand over separatists and terrorist attacks in Russia dwindled, falling from 257 in 2005 to 48 in 2007. Military analyst Vitaly Shlykov praised the effectiveness of Russia&#x27;s security agencies, saying that the experience learned in Chechnya and Dagestan had been key to the success. In 2008, the American Carnegie Endowment&#x27;s Foreign Policy magazine named Russia as &quot;the worst place to be a terrorist&quot;, particularly highlighting Russia&#x27;s willingness to prioritize national security over civil rights. By 2010, Russian special forces, led by the FSB, had managed to eliminate the top leadership of the Chechen insurgency, except for Dokka Umarov.

From 2009, the level of terrorism in Russia increased again. Particularly worrisome was the increase in suicide attacks. While between February 2005 and August 2008, no civilians were killed in such attacks, in 2008 at least 17 were killed and in 2009 the number rose to 45. In March 2010, Islamist militants organised the 2010 Moscow Metro bombings, which killed 40 people. One of the two blasts took place at Lubyanka station, near the FSB headquarters. Militant leader Doku Umarov—dubbed &quot;Russia&#x27;s Osama bin Laden&quot;—took responsibility for the attacks. In July 2010, President Dmitry Medvedev expanded the FSB&#x27;s powers in its fight against terrorism.

In 2011, Federal Security Service exposed 199 foreign spies, including 41 professional spies and 158 agents employed by foreign intelligence services. The number has risen in recent years: in 2006 the FSB reportedly caught about 27 foreign intelligence officers and 89 foreign agents. Comparing the number of exposed spies historically, the then-FSB Director Nikolay Kovalyov said in 1996: &quot;There has never been such a number of spies arrested by us since the time when German agents were sent in during the years of World War II.&quot; The 2011 figure is similar to what was reported in 1995–1996, when around 400 foreign intelligence agents were uncovered during the two-year period.

===Anti terrorist operations prior to 2014 Sochi Olympics===
Olympic organizers received several threats prior to the Games. In a July 2013 video release, Chechen Islamist commander Dokka Umarov called for attacks on the Games, stating that the Games were being staged &quot;on the bones of many, many Muslims killed ...and buried on our lands extending to the Black Sea.&quot; Threats were received from the group Vilayat Dagestan, which had claimed responsibility for the Volgograd bombings under the demands of Umarov, and a number of National Olympic Committees had also received threats via e-mail, threatening that terrorists would kidnap or &quot;blow up&quot; athletes during the Games.

In response to the insurgent threats, Russian special forces cracked down on suspected terrorist organizations, making several arrests and claiming to have curbed several plots, and killed numerous Islamist leaders including Eldar Magatov, a suspect in attacks on Russian targets and alleged leader of an insurgent group in the Babyurt district of Dagestan. Dokka Umarov himself was poisoned on 6 August 2013, and died on 7 September 2013.

===Insurgency in the Caucasus===
Although crime has been markedly reduced and stability increased throughout Russia compared to the previous year, about 350 militants in the North Caucasus have been killed in anti-terror operations in the first four months of 2014, according to an announcement by Interior Minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev in the State Duma.

On 23 September 2014, Russian news agencies marked the 15th anniversary of the formation of the &quot;Unified Group of Troops (&quot;OGV&quot;, or &quot;ОГВ&quot;)&quot; in the North Caucasus. The OGV is the inter-service headquarters established at Khankala, Chechnya to command all Russian (MOD, MVD, FSB) operations from the start of the second Chechen war in 1999.

Since its inception, the OGV combined operations has conducted 40,000 special missions, destroyed 5,000 bases and caches, confiscated 30,000 weapons, and disarmed 80,000 explosive devices and in the process has killed over 10,000 insurgents in the time frame of 15 years. The Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) noted that the decoration Hero of the Russian Federation has been awarded to 93 MVD servicemen in the OGV (including 66 posthumously). Overall, more than 23,000 MVD troops have received honors for their conduct during operations.

Russian spetsnaz forces participated in the 2014 Grozny clashes.

===Russo-Ukrainian War===
According to multiple Western sources and Ukraine, Spetsnaz unit of the VDV RF took part in the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation. Several hundred members of the 45th Detached Guards Spetsnaz Regiment and the 22nd Spetsnaz brigade were sent in, disguised as civilians.

====Russian invasion of Ukraine====
Russian Spetsnaz units have been used in the Russian invasion of Ukraine beginning in early 2022, they were initially tasked with going after high-ranking Ukrainian officials, including president Volodymyr Zelenskyy in order to decapitate the Ukrainian command and control structure, with the objective being to foster chaos. Like other Russian plans during the start of the invasion, the Russian Spetsnaz failed to take out Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian leadership.

The Russian military was not dissuaded by the failure, and continued to use spetsnaz in the conflict, particularly deploying them when conventional Russian forces faced significant resistance. This caused the heavy attrition rate suffered by the Russian forces to also reach the Russian Spetsnaz, according to a Pentagon leak in April 2023, all but one of five Spetsnaz brigades that had participated in the war had suffered significant losses by late summer 2022. According to the estimate, one of the separate Spetsnaz brigades in question had only ″125 personnel active out of 900 deployed.″ The casualties were expected to have increased following the Ukrainian counteroffensive in September 2022 that liberated hundreds of square miles of territory in a few days, during this offensive, the GRU&#x27;s Third Guards Spetsnaz Brigade, considered one of the most elite Russian units, was caught in the retreat and had to fight a defensive action in the town of Lyman. A report by the BBC assessed that the Spetsnaz unit lost up to 75% of its men during this action.

The high amount of losses suffered in Ukraine are expected to leave a strategic capability gap, since special forces unlike conventional units cannot be ″mass-produced″, the leaked Pentagon documents estimated that it would take Russia up to ten years to reconstitute its special operations capability, and this estimate referred to outdated 2022 figures. Although there are no figures concerning Spetsnaz losses after the summer of 2022, the extremely heavy losses suffered by the entire Russian forces suggest that Spetsnaz units have continued to take significant losses in the invasion.

===Syrian Civil War===
&quot;War on the Rocks&quot; reports that various Russian special missions units have been openly supporting Syrian army units, and along with the Russian Aerospace Forces, have been invaluable in pushing back anti-government forces.

At the peak of the deployment, there was a detachment of approximately 250 GRU spetsnaz soldiers, probably drawn from several units, including naval spetsnaz from the 431st Naval Reconnaissance Point, while SOF operators from the KSSO, reportedly conducted mainly sniper/counter-sniper, sabotage and reconnaissance missions behind enemy lines.

==Structure==

=== Soviet Union ===

The Russian military theorist Colonel Mikhail Svechnykov originally proposed the concept of using special tactics and strategies. Svechnykov (executed during the Great Purge in 1938), envisaged the development of unconventional warfare capabilities to overcome disadvantages faced by conventional forces in the field. In the 1930s the &quot;grandfather of the &quot;spetsnaz&quot;&quot;, Ilya Starinov,
began the implementation of the idea.

During World War II, Red Army reconnaissance and sabotage detachments formed under the supervision of the Second Department of the General Staff of the Soviet Armed Forces. These forces were subordinate to front commanders. The infamous NKVD internal-security and espionage agency also had their own special purpose (&quot;osnaz&quot;) detachments, including many saboteur teams who were airdropped into enemy-occupied territories to work with (and often take over and lead) the Soviet Partisans.

In 1950 Georgy Zhukov advocated the creation of 46 military &quot;spetsnaz&quot; companies, each consisting of 120 servicemen. This was the first use of &quot;spetsnaz&quot; to denote a separate military branch since World War II. These companies were later expanded to battalions and then to brigades. However, some separate companies (orSpN) and detachments (ooSpN) existed with brigades until the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

The special-purpose forces of the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union included fourteen land brigades, two naval brigades and a number of separate detachments and companies, operating under the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) and collectively known as Spetsnaz GRU. These units and formations existed in the highest possible secrecy, disguised as Soviet paratroopers (Army spetsnaz) or naval infantrymen (Naval spetsnaz) by their uniforms and insignia.

Twenty-four years after the birth of spetsnaz, the Chairman of the KGB General Yuri Andropov (in that office from 1967 to 1982) established the first counter-terrorist unit. From the late 1970s through to the 1980s, a number of special-purpose units were founded in the KGB (1954–1991) and in the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) (1946–1954).

==== KGB ====
Spetsgruppa &#x27;A&#x27; (Alpha Group) counter-terrorist unit was created in 1974.

Spetsgruppa &quot;V&quot;, abbreviation of the Directorate в (Russian Cyrillic for V), also known as &quot;Vega&quot; in period 1993–1995, was formed in 1981, merging two elite Cold War-era KGB special units—Cascade (&quot;Kaskad&quot;) and Zenith (&quot;Zenit&quot;)—which were similar to the CIA&#x27;s Special Activities Division (responsible for clandestine / covert operations involving sabotage and assassination in other countries) and re-designated for counter-terrorist and counter-sabotage operations.

==== MVD ====
These were special forces of the MVD Internal Troops.

=== Post-Soviet ===
During the 1990s special detachments were established within the Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) and the Airborne Troops (VDV). Some civil agencies with non-police functions have formed special units also known as &quot;spetsnaz&quot;, such as the Leader special centre in the Ministry of Emergency Situations (MChS).

In total, by December 1991, at the time of the collapse of the USSR, the GRU reconnaissance and sabotage formations had:
* 14 special purpose brigades
* 2 special purposes regiments
* 29 independent special purpose companies
* 5 naval reconnaissance point

In Russia, in 2013 a Special Operations Forces Command was established for Special Operations Forces which had earlier been established from around 2009 following a study of Western special-operations forces units and commands. The Command was not under the control of the GRU but reported directly to the General Staff – as did the GRU.

== Belarusian spetsnaz ==

The 5th Spetsnaz Brigade is a special forces brigade of the Armed Forces of Belarus, formerly part of the Soviet spetsnaz. In addition, the State Security Committee (KGB) of Belarus that was formed from the inherited personnel and operators after the break up of the Soviet Union. KGB of Belarus has its own Spetsgruppa &quot;A&quot; (Alpha Group), which is the country&#x27;s primary counter-terrorism unit.

== Kazakh spetsnaz ==
As with many post Soviet states, Kazakhstan adopted the term Alpha Group to be used by its special forces. The Almaty territorial unit of Alpha was turned into the special unit Arystan (meaning &quot;Lions&quot; in Kazakh) of the National Security Committee (KNB) of Kazakhstan. In 2006, five members of Arystan were arrested and charged with the kidnapping of the opposition politician Altynbek Sarsenbayuly, his driver, and his bodyguard; the three victims were then allegedly delivered to the people who murdered them.

Kokhzal (meaning wolf pack in Kazakh language) is a special forces unit of Kazakhstan responsible for carrying out anti terror operations as well as serving as a protection detail for the President of Kazakhstan.

== Russian spetsnaz after 2010 ==

=== Administrative history ===
The elite units of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation are controlled, for the most part, by the military-intelligence GRU (Spetsnaz GRU) under the General Staff. They were heavily involved in secret operations and training pro-Russian forces in the civil war in Chechnya during the 1990s and 2000s. In 2010, as a result of the 2008 Russian military reform, GRU special forces came under the control of the Russian Ground Forces, being &quot;directly subordinated to commanders of combined strategic commands.&quot; However, in 2013, these spetsnaz forces were placed back under the GRU. The Russian Airborne Troops (VDV, a separate branch of the Soviet and Russian Armed Forces) includes the 45th Guards Spetsnaz Brigade. In 2009, a Directorate of Special Operations was established that reported directly to the General Staff not the GRU to establish the Special Operations Forces which in 2013 became the Special Operations Forces Command. Most Russian military special forces units are known by their type of formation (company, battalion or brigade) and a number, like other Soviet or Russian military units. Two exceptions were the ethnic Chechen Special Battalions &quot;Vostok&quot; and &quot;Zapad&quot; (East and West) that existed during the 2000s. The &quot;Structure&quot; chapter contains the list of special purpose units of the Russian Armed Forces.

=== Training ===
The FSB Spetsnaz maintain a training base near the village of Averkyevo. There is a &quot;killing house&quot; providing training similar to the SAS close to Moscow.

=== Uniform ===
Russian special forces wear different berets depending on the branch of the armed forces they belong to. These include:
* Ground Forces and Airborne Forces – Blue beret
* Navy and Marines – Black beret
* National Guard – Maroon beret

==== Federal Security Service (FSB) ====
The Centre of Special Operations of the FSB TsSN FSB, &quot;центр специального назначения ФСБ&quot;) is officially tasked with combating terrorism and protecting the constitutional order of the Russian Federation. The TsSN FSB consists of estimated 8,000 operators and personnel in at least 7 operative divisions:
* Directorate &quot;A&quot; (&quot;Spetsgruppa Alpha&quot;)
* Directorate &quot;V&quot; (&quot;Spetsgruppa Vympel&quot;)
* Directorate &quot;S&quot; (&quot;Spetsgruppa Smerch&quot; – Special Operations Executive – SOE) – TsSN of Moscow city and Moscow Oblast
* Directorate &quot;K&quot; (&quot;Spetsgruppa Kavkaz&quot;) – formerly Special Purpose unit for the city of Yessentuki
* Directorate &quot;T&quot; (&quot;Spetsgruppa Tavrida&quot;) (Crimea, previously – 2nd service &quot;SN&quot; of FSB)
* Special Weapons Combat Use Service (SV) - testing of new weapons in high-risk conditions
* Directorate &quot;X&quot; (Hacker) - ensuring cybersecurity of structures

TsSN FSB headquarters is a large complex of buildings and training areas, with dozens of hectares of land and scores of training facilities. The average training period for a TsSN officer is about five years.

Spetsgruppa &#x27;A&#x27; (Alpha Group) is the premier counter-terrorism unit of the FSB. Consisting of about 720 personnel, of which about 250–300 are trained for assault operations and the rest are support personnel. These are dispersed in five operational detachments, including one permanent detachment in the Chechen Republic. Other units are stationed in Moscow, Krasnodar, Yekaterinburg and Khabarovsk. All Alpha operators undergo airborne, mountain and counter-sabotage dive training. Alpha has operated in other countries, most notably Operation Storm-333 on a mission to overthrow and kill Afghan president Hafizullah Amin).

Spetsgruppa &quot;V&quot;, abbreviation of the Directorate в (Russian Cyrillic for V), also known as &quot;Vega&quot; in period 1993–1995, was formed in 1981, continues the lineage of two elite Cold War-era KGB special units—Cascade (Kaskad) and Zenith (Zenit). Its modern function is the protection of strategic installations, such as factories and transportation centers. With its Alpha counterparts, it is heavily used in the North Caucasus. Vympel has four operative units in Moscow, with branch offices in nearly every city containing a nuclear power plant.

Spetsgruppa &quot;S&quot;, abbreviation of the Directorate C (Russian Cyrillic for S), also known as Smerch, but also known as the Special Operations Executive (SOE), is a relatively new unit formed in July 1999. Officers from Smerch are frequently involved with the capture and transfer of various bandit and criminal leaders who help aid disruption in the North Caucasus and throughout Russia. Operations include both direct action against bandit holdouts in Southern Russia as well as high-profile arrests in more densely populated cities and guarding government officials. Because of its initials, this group is casually referred to as &quot;Smerch&quot;. With the Centre of Special Operations and its elite units, many FSB special forces units operate at the regional level. These detachments are usually known as ROSN or ROSO (Regional Department of Special Designation), such as Saint Petersburg&#x27;s &quot;Grad&quot; (Hail) or Murmansk&#x27;s &quot;Kasatka&quot; (Orca).

==== Foreign Intelligence Service ====
The SVR RF, formerly the First Chief Directorate of the KGB of the USSR, has its own top secret elite special force within the Operations Department of Directorate Z known as (Заслон) (meaning Screen, Barrier or Shield) about which extremely little is known. Formerly in PGU KGB SSSR called Vympel (e.g. French counterpart; Action Division).

However, mere existence of such group within SVR is denied by Russian authorities. Nevertheless, there were some rumors that such group does indeed exist and is assigned to execute very specific special operations abroad primarily for protection of Russian embassy personnel and internal investigations. It is believed that the group is deep undercover and consists of approximately 300–500 highly experienced operatives speaking several languages and having extensive record of operations while serving in other secret units of the Russian military.

==== National Guard ====

The Russian government established the National Guard of Russia in 2016. The Guard&#x27;s special forces (consolidating and replacing the forces of the MVD Internal Troops, SOBR, and OMON) includes a number of Russian Internal Troops (VV, , successors to the Soviet Internal Troops) paramilitary units to combat internal threats to the government, such as insurgencies and mutinies. These units usually have a unique name and an official OSN (previously known as OSNAZ () or Отряд особого назначения (&quot;Otryad osobogo naznacheniya&quot;) meaning &quot;special purpose unit&quot;) number, and some are part of the ODON (also known as the Dzerzhinsky Division). OBrON (Independent Special Designation Brigade) VV special groups (&quot;spetsgruppa&quot;) were deployed to Chechnya.

The following is a list of National Guard OSNs (&quot;отряды специального назначения&quot;, otryady spetsial&#x27;novo naznacheniya or &quot;special purpose detachments&quot;) in 2012:
* Dzerzhinsky Division (&quot;O.D.O.N.&quot;)
** 604th Special Purpose Center
* 7th OSN &quot;Rosich&quot; (Novocherkassk)
* 12th OSN &quot;Ural&quot; (Nizhny Tagil)
* 15th OSN &quot;Vyatich&quot; (Armavir)
* 17th OSN &quot; Edelveys&quot; (Mineralnye Vody)
* 19th OSN &quot;Ermak&quot; (Novosibirsk)
* 21st OSN &quot;Tayfun&quot; (Sosnovka)
* 23rd OSN &quot;Mechel&quot; (Chelyabinsk)
* 25th OSN &quot;Merkuriy&quot; (Smolensk)
* 26th OSN &quot;Bars&quot; (Kazan)
* 27th OSN &quot;Kuzbass&quot; (Kemerovo)
* 28th OSN &quot;Ratnik&quot; (Arkhangelsk)
* 29th OSN &quot;Bulat&quot; (Ufa)
* 30th OSN &quot;Svyatogor&quot; (Stavropol)
* 33rd OSN &quot;Peresvet&quot; (Moscow)
* 34th OSN &quot;Skif&quot; (Grozny)
* 35th OSN &quot;Rus&quot; (Simferopol)

Furthermore, the Internal Troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the USSR/Russia also had numerous naval detachments that conducted maritime operations. These include:
* 1st Marine Detachment of the MVD (Khabarovsk);
* 2nd Marine Detachment of the MVD (Murmansk);
* 31st Marine Training Detachment of the MVD (Severobaikalsk);
* 32nd Marine Detachment of the MVD (Ozersk)

These detachments today form the National Guard Naval Service Corps and report to the National Guard HQ.

==== Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) ====
The vast majority of MVD special forces were transferred to the National Guard in 2016.

Previously, the MVD had Politsiya (police, formerly Militsiya) special forces stationed in nearly every Russian city. Most of Russia&#x27;s special-police officers belong to OMON units, which are primarily used as riot police and not considered an elite force—unlike the SOBR (known as the OMSN from 2002 to 2011) rapid-response units consisting of experienced, better-trained and -equipped officers. The Chechen Republic has unique and highly autonomous special-police formations, supervised by Ramzan Kadyrov (who has served as Head of the Chechen Republic since 2007) and formed from the Kadyrovtsy, including the (Akhmad or Akhmat) Kadyrov Regiment (&quot;Kadyrov&#x27;s &quot;spetsnaz&quot;&quot;).
From 2003 until 2016 The Federal Drug Control Service of Russia has operated the OSN &quot;Grom&quot;, which became part of the Federal Police in April 2016, and now is subordinate to the MVD&#x27;s Main Directorate for Drugs Control.

==== Ministry of Justice ====

The Russian Ministry of Justice maintains several spetsnaz organizations:

The following is a list of Federal Penitentiary Service OSNs:
* OSN &quot;Fakel&quot;
* OSN &quot;Rossy&quot;
* OSN &quot;Akula&quot;
* OSN &quot;Ajsberg&quot;
* OSN &quot;Gyurza&quot;
* OSN &quot;Korsar&quot;
* OSN &quot;Rosomakha&quot;
* OSN &quot;Sokol&quot;
* OSN &quot;Saturn&quot;
* OSN &quot;Tornado&quot;
* OSN &quot;Kondor&quot;
* OSN &quot;Yastreb&quot;
* OSN &quot;Berkut&quot;
* OSN &quot;Grif&quot;
* OSN &quot;Titan&quot;
* OSN &quot;Gepard&quot;
* OSN Saturn.

== Ukrainian spetsnaz ==

Like many other post-Soviet states, Ukraine inherited its spetsnaz units from the remnants of the Soviet armed forces, GRU and KGB units. Ukraine now maintains its own spetsnaz structure under the control of the Ministry of Interior, and under the Ministry of Defence, while the Security Service of Ukraine maintains its own spetsnaz force, the Alpha group. The term &quot;Alpha&quot; is also used by many other post Soviet states such as Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan as these units are based on the Soviet Union&#x27;s Alpha Group. Ukraine&#x27;s Berkut special police force gained mainstream attention during the 2014 Revolution of Dignity as it was alleged to have been used by the government to quell the uprising. However, this is disputed as many officers were also wounded and killed in the action.
Current Ukrainian spetsnaz units with Soviet lineage:
* 3rd Spetsnaz Regiment - formed on the basis of the 10th Spetsnaz Brigade
* 8th Spetsnaz Regiment - formed on the basis of the 8th Spetsnaz Brigade
* 73rd Maritime Special Operations Center - formed on the basis of the 17th Naval Spetsnaz Brigade
* Ukraine&#x27;s Alpha Group (SBU) - formed on the basis of Kyiv-based 10th Group of the KGBs Alpha Group

==In popular culture==
The video game, &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six Siege&quot; features five spetsnaz operators named Glaz, Fuze, Kapkan, Tachanka, and Finka. In another Tom Clancy game, Endwar, Spetsnaz Guard Brigades is the name of the élite branch of the Russian army. 
The spetsnaz have also been referenced and featured multiple times in the video game series Call of Duty, mainly in the Modern Warfare titles. Spetsnaz are also featured in multiple entries in the ARMA series.

Two gangsters in the Guy Ritchie film &quot;RocknRolla&quot; have a &#x27;scar competition&#x27; in which they show healed wounds (and describe how they occurred) from injuries they incurred whilst on several spetsnaz operations.

Season 1, Episode 4 of MacGyver (2016 TV series) focuses on stopping spetsnaz agents from activating a Cold War era bomb.

<text>The Drummer of Tedworth is the case of an alleged poltergeist manifestation in the West Country of England, recorded by Joseph Glanvill in his book &quot;Saducismus Triumphatus&quot; (1681).

==History==

Early accounts reported that in 1661 a local landowner, John Mompesson, owner of a house in the town of Tedworth (now called Tidworth, in Wiltshire), had brought a lawsuit against an unlicensed vagrant drummer William Drury, whom he accused of collecting money by false pretences. After he had won judgment against the drummer, the drum was turned over to Mompesson by the local bailiff. Mompesson then found his house plagued by nocturnal drumming noises. It was alleged that the drummer had brought these plagues of noise upon Mompesson&#x27;s head by witchcraft. Drury was said to have been associated with a band of gypsies.

Glanvill, who visited the house in 1663, had claimed to have heard strange scratching noises under a bed in the children&#x27;s room.

On Christmas Day 1667, Samuel Pepys, in his diary, records his wife, Elizabeth, reading the story to him. He found it to be &quot;a strange story of spirits and worth reading indeed.&quot;

In 1668, Glanvill published one of the earlier versions of &quot;Saducismus Triumphatus,&quot; his &quot;A Blow at Modern Sadducism&quot; ... To which is added, &quot;The Relation of the Fam&#x27;d Disturbance by the Drummer, in the House of Mr. John Mompesson.&quot;

John Wesley made reference to the Drummer at Tedworth in his journal: 
==Critical reception==
In 1716 the Whig writer and politician Joseph Addison wrote a play &quot;The Drummer&quot; inspired by events at Tedworth. However, he updated the story to the recent War of the Spanish Succession and gave a rational explanation for the ghostly drumming; a returning veteran thought killed in action does it to scare off two suitors from his now wealthy &quot;widow&quot;.

Charles Mackay, in his &quot;Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds&quot; (1841), considered the phenomena to be undoubtedly fraudulent produced by confederates of the drummer and suggested Mompesson was easily deceived.

Amos Norton Craft (1881) also suggested that the phenomena were the result of trickery:

Addington Bruce (1908) has argued that the phenomenon was fraudulently manufactured by Mompesson&#x27;s own children, especially his oldest daughter, a girl of ten. Bruce wrote that the noises and movement of objects were reminiscent of pranks and often occurred in the children&#x27;s bedroom. Bruce noted that Glanvill &quot;passed only one night in the haunted house, and of his several experiences there is none that cannot be set down to fraud plus imagination, with the children the active agents.&quot;

Andrew Lang of the Society for Psychical Research wrote that &quot;the Drummer was suspected, but, consciously or not, the children were probably the agents.&quot;

<doc id="177453" wikidata="Q4707284" url="?curid=177453" title="Trow (folklore)">
<text>A trow (also trowe, drow, or dtrow) is a malignant or mischievous fairy or spirit in the folkloric traditions of the Orkney and Shetland islands. Trows may be regarded as monstrous giants at times, or quite the opposite, short-statured fairies dressed in grey.

Trows are nocturnal creatures, like the troll of Scandinavian legend with which the trow shares many similarities. They venture out of their &#x27;trowie knowes&#x27; (earthen mound dwellings) solely in the evening, and often enter households as the inhabitants sleep. Trows traditionally have a fondness for music, and folktales tell of their habit of kidnapping musicians or luring them to their dens.

== Terminology ==
The trow , in the Scots language, is defined as a ‘sprite or fairy’ of mischievous nature in dictionaries of Scots, particularly Orcadian and Shetland dialects.

=== Etymology ===
The standard etymology derives the term trow from &quot;troll&quot; (; ) of Scandinavian folklore. Norwegian &quot;trold&quot; (&quot;troll&quot;) can signify not just a &#x27;giant&#x27;, but a &#x27;specter, ghost&#x27; () as well.

As an alternate etymology, John Jamieson&#x27;s Scottish dictionary conjectured that the word &quot;trow&quot; may be a corruption of Scandinavian &quot;draug&quot;. It may be worth noting that the Norwegian &quot;sea-&quot;draug&quot;&quot; (; , ) was either a sub-type or equivalent to the sea-troll/sea-trold, according to 18th century tracts by Dano-Norwegians.

=== drow ===
The trow is also called drow under its variant spelling in the Insular dialects of Scots; the &quot;drow&quot; being mentioned by Walter Scott. However, the term &quot;drow&quot; could also be used in the sense of ‘the devil’ in Orkney.

The word &quot;drow&quot; also occurs in the Shetland Norn language, where it means ‘&quot;huldrefolk&quot;’(&quot;the hidden people&quot;, fairies), ‘troll-folk’, or ‘ghost’. As &quot;drow&quot; is not a Norse language spelling, linguist Jakob Jakobsen proposed it was taken from the common (Scots) term &quot;trow&quot; altered to &quot;drow&quot; by assimilation with Old Norse or Norwegian . The reconstructed Shetland word would be *drog if it did descend from Old Norse &quot;draugr&quot;, but this is unattested, nor was it adopted into the Nynorn vocabulary to supersede the known form.

== General description ==

It was considered taboo to speak about trows. It was also considered unlucky to catch sight of a trow, though auspicious to hear one speaking.

Their portrayed appearance can vary greatly: in some telling gigantic and even multi-headed, as are some giants in English lore; else small or human-sized, like ordinary fairies, but dressed in grey.

Trows consist of two kinds, the hill-trows (land trows) and sea-trows, and the two kinds are said to be mortal enemies.

Of the hill-dwelling types, it is said they can only appear out of their dwellings (&quot;knowes&quot;=knolls; &quot;trowie knowes&quot;) after sunset, and if they miss the opportunity to return before sunrise, they do not perish but must await above ground and bide his time until &quot;the Glüder (the sun) disappears again&quot;.

The trows are fond of music and constantly play the fiddle themselves. Sometimes a human learns such tunes, and there are traditional tunes purported to have been learned from the supernatural creatures (cf. §Trowie tunes below).

Tales are also told of human fiddlers being abducted by trows to their mounds, and although released after what seems a brief stay, many long years have elapsed in the outside world, and the victim turns to dust, or chooses to die.

== Sea-trow ==
There are varying descriptions concerning the sea-trow.

An early account is that of the trow ( &#x27; &quot;&#x27;) of Stronsay, as described by Jo. Ben (i.e., John or Joseph Ben)&#x27;s &quot;Description of the Orkney Islands&quot; (1529); it was a maritime monster resembling a colt whose entire body was cloaked in seaweed, with a coiled or matted coat of hair, sexual organs like a horse&#x27;s, and known to engage in sexual intercourse with the women of the island.

The sea-trow of Orkney is &quot;the ugliest imaginable&quot; according to W. Traill Dennison, who says that it has been represented as a scaly creature with matted hair, having monkey-like face and sloping head. It was said to be frail-bodied with disproportionately huge sets of limbs, disc-shaped feet (&quot;round as a millstone&quot;) with webbings on their hands and feet, causing them to move with a lumbering and &quot;wabbling&quot; slow gait.

However, in Shetland, &quot;da mokkl sea-trow&quot;, a great evil spirit that dwelled in the depths, was said to take on the shape of a woman, at least in some instances.

It is blamed for awaiting in the depths and stealing from the fish caught on fishermen&#x27;s lines, and otherwise feared for causing storms or causing ill luck to fishermen. In the form of the wailing woman, she portends some misfortune befalling the witness/audience.

According to Samuel Hibbert the sea-trow was a local version of the &quot;neckar&quot;, and he specified that it was reputed to be decked with various stuff from out of the sea, especially &quot;fuci&quot; (&quot;Fucus&quot; spp. of seaweed), whose larger forms near shore are known as &quot;tang&quot; in Shetland. And though Hibbert does not make the connection, E. Marwick equated the sea-trow with the &quot;tangy&quot;, as already noted.

== Landmarks ==

Most mounds in Orkney are associated with &quot;mound-dweller[s]&quot; (&quot;hogboon&quot;; ; ) living inside them, and though local lore does always specify, the dweller is commonly the trow.

A reputedly trow-haunted mound may not in fact be a burial mound. The Long Howe in Tankerness, a glacial mound, was believed to contain trows, and thus avoided after dark. A group of mounds around Trowie Glen in Hoy are also geological formations, but feared for its trows throughout the valley, and also unapproached after dark.

The stone circle on Fetlar has been dubbed the Haltadans (meaning ‘Limping Dance’) since according to legend, they represent a group of petrified music-loving trows who were so engrossed by dancing to the trowie fiddler&#x27;s tunes that they failed to hide before dawn&#x27;s break.

On the mainland in Canisbay, Caithness is a &quot;Mire of Trowskerry&quot; associated with trows.

== Trowie tunes ==
Some Shetland fiddle tunes are said to have come to human fiddlers when they heard the trows playing, and are known as &quot;Trowie Tunes&quot;. A selection is offered in the anthology &quot;Da Mirrie Dancers&quot; (1985).

&quot;Da Trøila Knowe&quot; (&#x27;The Knoll of the Trolls&#x27;) is one example. &quot;Da Trowie Burn&quot; is also an alleged trowie tune, though its composition is attributed to Friedemann Stickle. This apparent contradiction is resolved in the case of &quot;Da Trow&#x27;s Reel&quot;, which was allegedly a tune that another man reputedly obtained from a trow, and he had whistled the tune over to Stickle on a different boat for him to set down the score. &quot;Da Peerie Hoose in under da Hill&quot; (&#x27;The Little House under the Hill&#x27;) is yet another trowie tune as well.

Another trowie tune &quot;Winyadepla&quot;, performed by Tom Anderson on his album with Aly Bain, &quot;The Silver Bow&quot;.

== Kunal trows ==

A Kunal-Trow (or King-Trow) is a type of trow in the lore of Unst, Shetland. The Kunal-Trow is alleged to be a race without females, and said to wander after dark and sometimes found weeping due to the lack of companionship. But they do take human wife, once in their lives, and she invariably dies after giving birth to a son. The Kunal-Trow would subsequently require the service of a human wet-nurse, and may abduct a midwife for this purpose.

They are said to consume earth formed into shapes of fish and fowl, even babies, which taste and smell like the real thing.

One (a King-Trow) famously haunted a broch ruin. Another married a witch who extracted all the trow&#x27;s secrets, and gave birth to Ganfer (astral body) and Finis (an apparition who appears in the guise of someone whose death is imminent), yet she has cheated death with her arts.

== Parallels ==
Ben&#x27;s sea-trow (&quot;trowis&quot;) bore resemblance to the anciently known incubus, as it &quot;seems to have occupied the visions of the female sex&quot;, as noted by John Graham Dalyell (1835).

The learning of music from fairies is recognized as a recurring theme in Scandinavian and Celtic folklore. Examples in Irish tradition relate how a &quot;lutharachán&quot; (dialect form of leprechaun) or &quot;púca&quot; teaches tunes, like the Shetlandic trow who lets his music be heard from his fairy mound or otherwise; such tales classifiable as Migratory Legends &quot;Type 4091, Music Taught by Fairie (Fiddle on the Wall)&quot; under Bo Almqvist&#x27;s modified system

The tale of a fiddler being taken to a fairy mound by fairies or trows is known by several versions in Shetland, but has also been collected from Orkney and the Scottish mainland (Inverness), and the group is assigned &quot;F24. Fiddler Enlisted to Play for Fairy Dancers&quot; under Alan Bruford&#x27;s provisional classification scheme.

== Origins ==

Book author Joan Dey (1991) speculates that the tradition concerning the trows may be based in part on the Norse invasions of the Northern Isles. She states that the conquest by the Vikings sent the indigenous, dark-haired Picts into hiding and that &quot;many stories exist in Shetland of these strange people, smaller and darker than the tall, blond Vikings who, having been driven off their land into sea-caves, emerged at night to steal from the new land owners&quot;.

Shetland folklore spoke of the presence of the Pechs (mythologized version of the Picts) inside the fairy knolls (&quot;trowie knowe&quot;), who could be heard clinking their tools on silver and gold.

<text>The Russian Airborne Forces () is the airborne separate combat arm of the Russian Armed Forces. It is a rapid response force and strategic reserve that is under the President of Russia, reporting directly to the Chief of the General Staff, and is organized into airborne and air assault units. It was formed in 1992 from divisions of the Soviet Airborne Forces that came under Russian control following the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

Troops of the Russian Airborne Forces have traditionally worn a blue beret and blue-striped &quot;telnyashka&quot; undershirt and are called &quot;desant&quot; (Russian: Десант), from the French &quot;Descente&quot;.

The Russian Airborne Forces utilizes a range of specialist airborne warfare vehicles and are fully mechanized. Traditionally they have had a larger complement of heavy weaponry than most contemporary airborne forces.

==Mission==
According to an order of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation in 1997, the Airborne Forces form the strategic reserve of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, under the direct command of the Chief of the General Staff, and as a rapid response force may be tasked with carrying out operations either independently or within larger army groups alongside units of the Ground Forces. The Airborne Forces can also participate in peacekeeping missions under the mandate of the United Nations (UN) or the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO).

The Airborne Forces are organized into three types of units, consisting of Airborne, Air Assault, and Mountain Air Assault. The airborne units can be parachuted into a combat zone, while the air assault units are airlifted there by aircraft or helicopter. Specifically designated mountain units were created after the Airborne Forces were frequently used in conflicts in the North Caucasus region in the immediate post-Soviet years. The structure of the Airborne Forces uses airborne or air assault divisions for the operational level, airborne or air assault brigades for the operational-tactical level, and regiments for the tactical level. This structure can be augmented with the addition of Ground Forces motorized rifle, artillery, aviation, or other units, depending on the situation.

After studying airborne operations during World War II, the Soviet leadership concluded they were largely unsuccessful, with only a few exceptions. They recognized the potential for an airborne force to attack targets behind enemy lines, but the main problems that were identified included a lack of firepower. An effort to resolve this was the introduction of the BMD series of armored vehicles in 1970, which were eventually issued to every regiment of an airborne division. Up to the present, the Russian Airborne Forces are more heavily armed than their Western counterparts, with the usage of armored personnel carriers.

==History==
===Founding and reorganization===
The dissolution of the Soviet Union led to the dividing up of the former Soviet Armed Forces by the newly independent states. The Russian Airborne Forces were established on 7 May 1992 by a decree from the President of the Russian Federation, Boris Yeltsin, and he held a meeting with the heads of state of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan to determine the distribution of former Soviet military assets. During 1992 and 1993 many of the airborne units were transferred to the territory of Russia, as only two of the seven Soviet airborne divisions had been located in the former Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. During this process the Russian General Staff wanted to prioritize maintaining control over the strategic assets of the Soviet military, which besides the Strategic Rocket Forces also included the Airborne Forces. There was initially an attempt to keep them under the joint command of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). But the concept of the CIS unified forces fell apart by the summer of 1993, as the independent states took control over the units on their territories.

The Russian Federation kept six of the seven divisions, which as of 1993 included:
*7th Guards Airborne Division – moved from Lithuania to Novorossiysk.
*44th Training Airborne Division – moved from Lithuania to Omsk.
*76th Guards Airborne Division (Pskov Oblast)
*98th Guards Airborne Division – moved from Ukraine to Ivanovo. Part of it stayed and became the nucleus of the 1st Airmobile Division, Ukrainian Airmobile Forces.
*104th Guards Airborne Division – moved from Azerbaijan to Ulyanovsk.
*106th Guards Airborne Division (Tula and Ryazan)

The remaining division, the 103rd Guards Airborne Division, became part of the Belarusian Ground Forces.

Russia also received seven of the sixteen Soviet airborne and air assault brigades, and some additional units, which included:
*11th Guards Air Assault Brigade (Ulan-Ude)
*13th Air Assault Brigade (Magdagachi and Zavitinsk)
*21st Air Assault Brigade (Stavropol)
*36th Air Assault Brigade (Garbolovo)
*37th Airborne Brigade (Chernyakhovsk)
*56th Guards Air Assault Brigade (Kamyshin)
*83rd Guards Air Assault Brigade (Ussuriysk)
*345th Guards Airborne Regiment (Gudauta, Abkhazia)
*196th Communications Regiment (Moscow Oblast)

In the early 1990s the active Russian Airborne Forces had five divisions and eight brigades, and a total strength of 64,300 personnel. Each division had a strength of 6,000 men. 
The two main training establishments of the VDV were in Ryazan and Omsk: the Ryazan Guards Higher Airborne Command School and the 242nd Training Center of the Airborne Forces, which was formed in Omsk on the basis of the training division.

===Early developments and wars===
In 1992, during the fall of Kabul to the mujahadeen, elements of the 106th Guards Airborne Division carried out the successful evacuation of the former Soviet embassy staff from Kabul, Afghanistan, along with the Chinese and Mongolian embassy staffs. A paratrooper of the VDV who was involved in the mission became one of the first recipients of the title Hero of Russia. Several units of the VDV were also used to maintain order in Moldova after the Transnistria War, and the former Soviet forces in that country were commanded by General Alexander Lebed, an airborne officer. Before the withdrawal of the 104th GAD from Azerbaijan in 1993, its members had been involved in skirmishes with the local Azeri population, and some members of another VDV unit joined Armenian militias that fought in the First Nagorno-Karabakh War. One airborne battalion in Georgia fought off an attack by local nationalists during the Georgian Civil War, and other airborne units were involved in helping maintain ceasefires during and after the Georgian-Ossetian and Georgian-Abkhazian wars between 1992 and 1993.

In the early 1990s, General Pavel Grachev, an Airborne Forces general who served as the first Russian Defence Minister from 1992 to 1996, planned for the VDV to form the core of the planned Mobile Forces. This was announced in &quot;Krasnaya Zvezda&quot;, the Ministry of Defence&#x27;s daily newspaper, in July 1992. From December 1993, the Mobile Forces were to consist of an Immediate Reaction Force that could be deployed in 4-10 hours, and a Rapid Response Force that could be deployed in three days. It was expected that the VDV, which Grachev saw as the reliable core of the Russian military, would provide 60 percent of these forces. However, the Mobile Forces plan was never enacted. The number of formations available for the force was far less than anticipated, since much of the Airborne Forces had been &#x27;nationalised&#x27; by the republics their units had been previously based in, and other arms of service, such as the GRU and Military Transport Aviation, who were to provide the airlift component, were adamantly opposed to ceding control of their forces.

The end of the Cold War brought up questions about the continued role and purpose of the Airborne Forces. With the possibility of large airborne operations unlikely (the VDV had not carried out a parachute assault since World War II), there were proposals to disband it or absorb its units into other service branches. As a strategic reserve, the VDV was also outside the control of military district commanders. It did provide a rapid response force that could quickly be deployed to conflict zones by aircraft faster than regular Ground Forces units. Another role of the VDV in the 1990s was also peacekeeping. In 1992 the 554th Separate Russian Battalion was formed from the 137th Guards Airborne Regiment and underwent training in Ryazan before being deployed to eastern Croatia as a peacekeeping unit with the UN mission during the Croatian War of Independence. It became the first Russian unit created for peacekeeping operations and consisted entirely of contract soldiers rather than conscripts. A new VDV formation was also established in 1994, the 45th Spetsnaz Regiment.

The Airborne Forces took part in the First Chechen War from December 1994 to August 1996. The joint army groups that carried out the ground campaign in the Battle of Grozny at the start of the war had elements of the 76th, 98th, 104th, and 106th GAD. They and the other Russian forces took significant casualties in the urban combat. One of the groups was commanded by the VDV general Nikolai Staskov, who was nearly killed by a grenade during the fighting in Grozny. The Battle of Vedeno, in late May and early June 1995, saw an airborne assault that was deployed by helicopter, and resulted in the capture of positions held by Chechen militants. In August 1999 a group of rebels led by the Chechen commander Shamil Basayev attempted to invade neighboring Dagestan, but Interior Ministry troops supported by the Ministry of Defense, with VDV units being the first to arrive, repelled the attack. The Second Chechen War from September 1999 to August 2000 also involved the VDV and was much more successful than the first war. On this occasion, all of the airborne troops involved were part their own army group.

At the end of the Bosnian War in late 1995 the United States wanted Russia to participate in the NATO Implementation Force (IFOR) that was deployed to ensure that the Dayton Accord was followed. The 1st Separate Airborne Brigade was established for this purpose, from units of the 76th and 98th GAD, and arrived in Bosnia in January 1996, to be part of Multi-National Division North. The Russian brigade, led by Colonel Alexander Lentsov, was under the tactical control of William L. Nash, U.S. 1st Armored Division commander, and the operational control of NATO supreme commander George Joulwan through a Russian general, Leonty Shevtsov, his deputy for Russian forces. Russian and American soldiers worked alongside each other in the first joint operation between Russia and the countries of NATO since World War II. The brigade participate in the NATO mission, which became the Stabilization Force (SFOR), until 2003.

Although during Pavel Grachev&#x27;s tenure as Minister of Defense the Russian armed forces had been reduced by 1.1 million troops, these changes had no effect on the VDV. But in December 1995 he ordered two airborne divisions and four air assault brigades to be put under the command of military districts, and when Grachev was replaced by Igor Rodionov in 1996, a Ground Forces officer, he tried to reduce the size of the VDV. In 1998 the 104th Division was reorganized as the 31st Separate Guards Air Assault Brigade. The 76th Division was converted into an air assault from an airborne division in 1998, and the 7th Division also was made an air assault division in 2006, in addition to getting a &quot;mountain&quot; designation. Several brigades were also disbanded: the 13th, 36th, and 37th Brigades in 1996 and the 21st and 56th Brigades in 1997. The remaining brigades – 11th, 31st, 83rd – were transferred to the command of the Ground Forces from 1996 until 2013. In 2009 the 56th Brigade was restored. The reforms in the second half of the 1990s brought the total strength of the VDV from 64,300 to 48,500, and by the late 2000s it was down to 35,000. 

Georgy Shpak, who was the commander of the Russian Airborne Forces from 1996 to 2003, prevented the Chief of the General Staff, Anatoly Kvashnin, from making the VDV part of the Ground Forces. One of his successors, Valery Yevtukhovich, the commander from 2007 to 2009, was forced to retire early over his disagreement with the Chief at that time, Nikolai Makarov, about the Airborne Forces. 

During the Russo-Georgian War in 2008, two regiments of the 76th GAAD and one from the 98th GAD were involved. The 76th was rapidly deployed into Georgia&#x27;s South Ossetia region ahead of the Russian main force, the 58th Army of the Ground Forces, along with the 45th Spetsnaz Regiment. Elements of the 7th Division entered Abkhazia. Despite some problems with their equipment, the VDV achieved its objectives.

===Post-2008 reform===

In May 2009 Lieutenant General Vladimir Shamanov became the commander of the VDV. He was a veteran of the Soviet-Afghan War and had overseen the successful second Chechen campaign. Under the 2008 reform programme, the four existing two-regiment divisions should have been transformed into 7–8 air-assault brigades. However, once General Shamanov became commander of the Airborne Forces, it was decided to keep the original structure. The divisions were strengthened, becoming four independent airborne/air-assault brigades, one for each military district. In 2010, the VDV deputy commander, Major General Alexander Lentsov, said that the service would remain a separate combat arm, but there was a possibility that it would become part of the Special Operations Forces after 2016.

In October 2013 it was reported that the three airborne brigades under military district control (apparently the 11th and 83rd (Ulan-Ude and Ussuriysk) in the Eastern Military District and the 56th at Kamyshin in the Southern Military District) would be returned to VDV command. The process was completed by July 2015. In October 2013, Commander of the VDV Vladimir Shamanov announced that a new air assault brigade would be formed in Voronezh in 2016 with the number of the 345th Guards Airborne Regiment. The establishment of the brigade was postponed to 2017–18, according to a June 2015 announcement. It was announced in July 2015 that plans called for the 31st Airborne Brigade to be expanded into the 104th Guards Airborne Division by 2023, and for an additional airborne regiment to be attached to each division.

In the mid-2010s, the Russian Airborne Forces consisted of four divisions and six brigades, including:
*7th Guards Mountain Air Assault Division
*76th Guards Air Assault Division
*98th Guards Airborne Division
*106th Guards Airborne Division
*11th Guards Air Assault Brigade
*31st Guards Air Assault Brigade
*56th Guards Air Assault Brigade
*83rd Guards Air Assault Brigade
*45th Guards Spetsnaz Brigade
*38th Guards Communications Brigade 

By 2021 the total personnel of the VDV was 45,000.

Elements of the 76th Guards Air Assault Division&#x27;s 104th Guards Air Assault Regiment allegedly participated in the war in Donbas. These units allegedly were used as spearhead forces during the August 2014 DPR and LPR counteroffensive. During the August 2014 counteroffensive, battalion tactical groups of the 7th Guards Airborne Division&#x27;s 247th Guards Air Assault Regiment, the 98th Guards Airborne Division&#x27;s 331st Guards Airborne Regiment, the 106th Guards Airborne Division&#x27;s 137th Guards Airborne Regiment, and the 31st Guards Air Assault Brigade allegedly were sent into Ukraine. Reconnaissance teams from the 45th Guards Spetznaz Brigade and the 106th&#x27;s 173rd Guards Separate Reconnaissance Company were previously deployed to Ukraine alongside Ground Forces units.

In February 2016, it was reported that an airborne battalion would be permanently deployed to Dzhankoy, Crimea, in 2017–18, and upgraded to a regiment in 2020. In May 2017, Shamanov announced that the battalion would be formed at Feodosiya by 1 December 2017 as part of the 7th Guards Mountain Air Assault Division, and would be expanded into the 97th Air Assault Regiment with three battalions by late 2019. Since the 2014 annexation, the status of Crimea is under dispute between Russia and Ukraine; Ukraine and the majority of the international community considers Crimea an integral part of Ukraine, while Russia considers Crimea to be an integral part of Russia.

In August 2016, Russian paratroopers placed 1st place in the Airborne Platoon competition during the International Army Games in Russia, defeating teams from China, Iran, Belarus, and Kazakhstan.

On 4 October 2016, Colonel General Andrey Serdyukov was appointed commander of the Russian Airborne Forces, replacing Shamanov, who became chief of the Duma Committee on Defense.

State tests of a new Bakhcha-U-PDS parachute platform for the BMD-4M and BTR-MDM vehicles were completed in May 2018. Deliveries of new &#x27;heavy drop&#x27; systems PBS-950U and PBS-955 began in 2020. In 2019, two battalion sets of BMD-4M airborne combat vehicles and BTR-MDM Rakushka armored personnel carriers, more than 200 units of various automotive equipment, including special armored vehicles, army snowmobiles, four-wheelers and buggies and more than 9,000 parachute systems D-10 and &quot;Arbalet-2&quot; were delivered to the troops.

In April 2020, military personnel from the Russian Airborne Forces, performed the world&#x27;s first HALO paradrop from the lower border of the Arctic stratosphere. The Russian commando group used &quot;next-generation special-purpose parachute system&quot;, military-tested oxygen equipment, navigation devices, special equipment, and uniforms. This was the first high-altitude landing in the Arctic latitudes over 10 km in the history of Russian aviation.

As part of its mission in the Arctic region, the aircrew provided landing of airborne units from altitudes of between 10 and 1.8 kilometres, as well as landing of cargo with a total weight of about 18 tons. After conducting practical combat training, the Il-76 aircrews landed at the Nagurskoe airfield in the northern part of the island of Franz Josef Land. The high-altitude landing was dedicated to the 75th anniversary of victory in the Great Patriotic war of 1941–1945, and the 90th anniversary of the formation of the Airborne troops.

In 2020, the VDV continued to modernize and re-equip its command posts, started to receive the Stayer high-altitude parachute system which enable airdrops from up to 10 km altitude, and completed receiving special-purpose controllable parachute systems.

Two air assault regiments were set up in Pskov and Crimea as part of air assault divisions in 2021. The Russian Defense Ministry also accepted the Zavet-D artillery fire control vehicle for the Airborne Forces. In 2021-2022, the Airborne Forces received about 30,000 sets of landing equipment and parachute systems. Sergey Shoigu claimed in September 2023 that VDV have received more than 2,000 hardware units and 5,500 landing means and also a new airborne regiment formed since the beginning of the year. The Russian Ministry of Defense said on 1 January 2024 that the VDV received during the past year over 2,500 units of weapons, military and special equipment, including more than 780 samples of &quot;newest and contemporary ones&quot;. Among the newest samples were T-90M tanks and BMD-4M IFVs as well as BTR-MDM &quot;Rakushka&quot; and BTR-82A APCs. It was also reported on 3 January that 20 military units were created in 2023, including the Ulyanovsk air assault division. About 16,000 landing means were also reportedly delivered and 1,000 more in the first quarter of 2024.

=== Russian invasion of Ukraine ===

The VDV participated heavily in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In the opening hours of the invasion the VDV attempted to secure key airports and support assaults around Ukraine. These paratroopers were recognizable by the orange-and-black Saint George ribbons decorating their helmets and arms.

The VDV attempted to paradrop and transport troops with Mi-8 and Mi-17 helicopters and take the Hostomel Airport in northern Kyiv, in order to use the airport to airlift more troops and heavy equipment to take Kyiv as a form of forward &quot;air bridge&quot; that would enable rapid deployment of Russian forces far in advance of the Russian land front, in an action that became known as the Battle of Antonov Airport. The VDV troops at the airport then engaged the Ukrainian National Guard&#x27;s 4th Rapid Reaction Brigade, which with the help of the Ukrainian Air Force encircled the unsupported VDV troops and recaptured the airport, with the Russians escaping to nearby woods.

The next day battle resumed, and the VDV again attempted to land troops at the airport. Deploying around 200 helicopters and with support from the Ground Forces arriving from the north (Belarus and Chernobyl), they finally broke through the Ukrainian defenses and established Russian control over the airport. In the end, however, the Ukrainians claimed that the airport became too damaged from the battle to be used as an airstrip.

40 kilometers south of Kyiv in Vasylkiv, VDV paratroopers also dropped in an attempt to secure the Vasylkiv Air Base. Without any support from air or ground forces, the VDV troops in Vasylkiv were eventually encircled and were unsuccessful in achieving their objectives, giving victory in the Battle of Vasylkiv to the Ukrainians.

On February 27, VDV troops with BMD-2s and BTR-Ds were seen advancing south of Hostomel in Bucha. The VDV and Ground Forces&#x27; units were hit on the same day by Bayraktar air strikes. The Ukrainian government claimed that &quot;more than 100 units of enemy equipment were destroyed”. On the following weeks the VDV served as mechanized infantry and light infantry during the Kyiv offensive.

During the Battle of Kharkiv, VDV paratroopers landed in Kharkiv on March 2 in an attempt to capture the contested city. They attempted a raid on a local military hospital but were repelled by local Ukrainian forces.

As of August 2022, according to the Airborne Forces commander Colonel General Mikhail Teplinsky, over 5,000 VDV paratroopers have been decorated for distinguished service during operations in Ukraine, and 17 of them became Heroes of the Russian Federation.

According to the UK Ministry of Defence in June 2023, Russia was redeploying regular military units to the Bakhmut sector following withdrawal of Wagner forces. These included elements of the 76th and 106th VDV divisions and two additional brigades. The MoD added that the VDV was much degraded from its pre-invasion &quot;elite&quot; status.

==== Analysis of losses ====

On 3 March 2022, it was reported that Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky of the VDV&#x27;s 7th Guards Mountain Air Assault Division, who was the appointed deputy commander of the 41st Combined Arms Army, was killed in action in Ukraine. His death is attributed to sniper fire either near Mariupol (which was besieged by Russian forces) or Hostomel during the Kyiv offensive. Ukrainian sources said he was killed on 2 March and his death was first confirmed on VKontakte by &quot;Combat Brotherhood&quot;, a Russian veterans group, and later by President Vladimir Putin. The VDV suffered similar losses in Bucha and Irpin with poor command and control being cited. The VDV also joined the assault on the city of Mykolaiv during the Battle of Mykolaiv, but were pushed back by a Ukrainian counter-offensive.

On 18 March it was reported that Colonel Sergei Sukharev along with deputy Major Sergei Krylov of the 331st Guards Airborne Regiment had been killed during fighting in Mariupol.

In late April, Bellingcat journalist Christo Grozev claimed that he &quot;personally checked&quot; and that Russia had lost &quot;almost 90% of its best paratroopers&quot; in the first echelon of the invasion. Many helicopters were shot down by Ukrainian defenses, and the paratroopers were stranded without armored vehicles or air support. In early May, the UK MoD stated that the VDV units and other elite forces had suffered high losses and that it would &quot;probably take years for Russia to reconstitute these forces.&quot; 

On 19 June 2022, it was reported by Odesa military-civilian spokesperson Serhiy Bratchuk that Putin had sacked Serdyukov for his doomed bid to take Hostomel airfield, which few of the invading soldiers survived. This was confirmed by Russian media reports. He was replaced by Colonel General Mikhail Teplinsky.

According to BBC News Russian and the Mediazona news website, 1,937 VDV deaths had been documented by the end of August 2023, which included 340 officers, accounting for 6% of the 31,665 Russian fatalities who had been identified by name, and 8% of those who could identified by both name and service branch.

UK intelligence estimate that around 30,000 paratroop forces were deployed to Ukraine in 2022 and that 50% of those have been killed or wounded by summer 2023. A Russian General in August 2023 stated that 3,500 wounded paratroopers had refused to leave the front for treatment and 5,000 had returned to the front after treatment.

As of 21 December 2023 at least 248 BMD-2, 101 BMD-4M, 83 BTR-D and 11 unknown BTR-D/BMD-2 have been lost in the invasion.

==== Wartime expansion ====
Despite claims of &#x27;devastating&#x27; and &#x27;crippling&#x27; losses, the VDV expanded during the war. After the invasion it was announced that the Airborne Forces would create two new divisions. Teplinsky announced on August 2, 2023 that the VDV is expanding the 31st Air Assault Brigade into the 104th Guards Air Assault Division. The 299th and 119th Parachute Airborne Regiments were also reestablished, expanding two other divisions from two to three regiments. 

Also reported was the creation of a new 52nd Artillery Brigade, the first unit of its type in the VDV, and the 44th Air Assault Division, created on the basis of the 111th and 387th Motor Rifle Regiments of the 1st Army Corps of the Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic. The 44th Air Assault Division recalls the number of the Soviet-era 44th Training Airborne Division, but being from newly-formed motor rifle regiments, it was described as being an air assault unit &quot;in name only&quot; by military analysts.

== Structure ==

The Airborne Forces Command answers to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and is responsible for the organization, development, training of the VDV, as well as the planning and implementation of operations involving VDV units. The Command includes the following senior officials, and the titles and the number of the deputy commanders have changed over the years, but as of June 2023 they include:

* Commander Airborne Forces – Colonel-General Mikhail Teplinsky
* Chief of Staff and First Deputy Commander Airborne Forces – Lieutenant-General Anatoly Kontsevoy
* Deputy Commander Airborne Forces for Peacekeeping Operations and Collective Rapid Reaction Forces – Lieutenant-General Andrei Kholzakov
* Deputy Commander Airborne Forces – Major-General Alexei Naumets
* Deputy Commander Airborne Forces for Airborne Training – Major-General Alexander Vyaznikov
* Deputy Commander Airborne Forces for Armaments – Major-General Alexei Ragozin
* Deputy Commander Airborne Forces for Combat Training – Major-General Sergei Volyk
* Deputy Commander Airborne Forces for Military-Political Work – Major-General Viktor Kupshichin
* Deputy Commander Airborne Forces for Material-Technical Support - Major-General Nariman Timergazin
* Deputy Commander Airborne Forces for Construction and Quartering – Major-General Leonid Shevchenko

===Organization===
The Air Landing Forces combine Parachute Landing (&quot;парашютно-десантние&quot;) and Landing Assault (&quot;десантно-штурмовие&quot;) units. The difference between the two is that while both were airborne qualified and mechanised with BMD, BTR-D, 2S9 Nona, the parachute landing units are lighter (only quarter mechanised) and play the role of entry element, while landing assault units were fully mechanised and were intended to develop the breach opened by the parachute landing forces.

The VDV are fully equipped with Barmitsa and Ratnik infantry combat suits as of 2018. Andromeda-D, Barnaul-T and Dozor automated control systems, AS-1 snowmobiles, four wheelers, a specially-created uniform for hot climates and Nanuk Arctic gear, reconnaissance-control and planning modules and the REX-1 counter-unmanned aerial vehicle rifle-like, man-portable jammer developed by Kalashnikov Group subsidiary ZALA Aero Group are also being introduced into service. Portable versions of the Garmony air defence radar, modernized reconnaissance and artillery fire control posts and Aistyonok and Sobolyatnik radars are being supplied to the VDV. The Russian Airborne Forces have also received new special-purpose controlled wing-type parachutes. VDV servicemen performing tasks in Ukraine received VKPO 3.0 all-season field uniform kits in 2023. The automatic cargo parachute system Junker-DG-250 passed acceptance trials and began to be supplied in November 2023. VDV also reportedly use the Lesochek EW system.

=== Armoured vehicles ===
There are over 1,800 armored fighting vehicles, mostly BMD-1 (since 1969), of which all but around 100 are in storage, and at least several hundred BMD-2 (since 1985). There are over 100 BMD-3 (1990) that were partially upgraded to BMD-4 level. All of them are amphibious, moving at around 10 km/h in water. The BMD-4 is capable of full, continuous fire while in deep water, unlike any other vehicle with such heavy weaponry (100 mm gun and 30 mm auto cannon). However, some units (such as those who served on peacekeeping duties in the Balkans) are known to have used BTR armored personnel carriers rather than BMD&#x27;s. T-72B3 tanks supplied to the Russian Airborne Forces in 2018 have been upgraded and are equipped with Andromeda automatic control system and some of them with top-attack defence screens. As of 2021, the Russian Airborne Forces have 150 T-72B3 and 10 T-72B3 mod. 2016. T-90M tanks are also attached to VDV units as of August 2023.

There is a turret-less variant of the BMD-1, the BTR-D, which is used as troop carrier and serves as the basis for specialised versions such as anti-tank, command and signals. The BTR-D will be partially replaced by the new multi-purpose APC BTR-MD &quot;Rakushka&quot; that will also come in several different versions. Approximately 280 vehicles in all BTR-D configurations are in service. As part of the 2011 state defence order (GOZ), 10 BMD-4M and 10 &quot;Rakushka&#x27;s&quot; have been ordered, but according to the VDV&#x27;s CinC General Colonel Shamanov, Kurganmashzavod did not give a guarantee it would produce them.

The Russian Defense Ministry adopted the BMD-4M in April 2016. The first production batch of the new armored vehicles BMD-4M and BTR-MDM &quot;Shell&quot; in the amount of 24 units (12 each) transferred to the Russian Airborne Forces in 2015. The VDV equipped the first regiment with BMD-4Ms and BTR-MDMs in 2016. In 2017, they received two battalion sets of BMD-4M combat airborne vehicles and BTR-MDM APCs, over 80 Rys’ and UAZ Pickup armored automobiles.

Russian airborne brigade-level units have received SPM-2 GAZ-233036 Tigr armored cars. They have ordered Kamaz Typhoon armored infantry transports, following modifications to meet the demands of the airborne troops and accepted them for supply in August 2021. The Russian Airborne Forces have received about 100 Tigr and Rys special armored vehicles, 200 Snegohod A-1 snow-going and AM-1 all-terrain vehicles, UAZ Patriot light motor vehicles, Toros 4x4 armored vehicles and Kamaz trucks that can be air-dropped.

The VDV currently receives Berkyt protected snowmobiles for personnel transportation and fire support in arctic conditions. Infauna and Leer-2 EW systems alongside Aileron-3SV UAVs and P-230T command vehicles are also received. The RKhM-6 chemical reconnaissance vehicle based on the BTR-80 armored personnel carrier, the BTR-D airborne assault armored personnel carrier with a ZU-23 anti-aircraft gun and the R-149MA1 and the R-142DA command and staff vehicles were demonstrated in August 2021. The Sarmat-2 light tactical buggy participated in the Zapad-2021 drill.

On 1 August 2013, it was reported that the Russian Airborne Forces will develop a hybrid combat vehicle that combines features of an airborne infantry fighting vehicle and a helicopter. To meet the demands of future armed conflicts, a combat module that combines a light combat vehicle and an attack helicopter is being considered, with a crew of three-four people. The vehicle will be developed for the VDV by 2030.

=== Artillery ===

The airborne self-propelled artillery guns ASU-57 and ASU-85 have been withdrawn. They had light armour and limited anti-tank capability, but provided invaluable fire support for paratroopers behind enemy lines (the caliber of the gun in mm is the number next to the ASU designation).

Also withdrawn were the multiple rocket launch systems RPU-14 (8U38) of 140 mm and the BM-21V &quot;Grad-V&quot; (9P125) of 122 mm on GAZ-66, as well as the 85 mm gun SD-44.

Today the VDV operates the following systems:
* 2S9 Nona and modernized 2S9M 120 mm self-propelled gun-mortar. Currently being replaced by the 2B23 Nona-M1 120 mm towed mortar and 2S31 Vena 120 mm self-propelled gun-mortar/2S12A modernized 120 mm self-propelled mortar
* 2S25 Sprut-SD 125 mm self-propelled artillery/anti-tank gun based on BMD-3 hull
* D-30 (2A18) 122 mm howitzer and anti-tank weapon, towed by truck, not amphibious, able to make 360 degree turns as it is deployed on a tripod
* ZU-23-2 23 mm air-defence gun, is either mounted on the BTR-D, or can be towed by a jeep or truck as it has wheels. Since 2011, some ZU-23s are being replaced by the Strela-10M3/MN and since 2016 by the newest versions of the Buk missile system.
* TOS-1A 220 mm self-propelled 24-barrel thermobaric/incendiary unguided rocket launcher since 2022.
* 2S36 Zauralets-D – future 120 mm self-propelled gun-howitzer based on the BMD-4
* 2S37 – future 152 mm self-propelled gun-howitzer based on the BMD-4

The VDV is equipped with numerous types of airborne capable trucks and jeeps, for example the Ural-4320, the GAZ-66V and the GAZ-2975 &quot;Tigr&quot; for transporting cargo, specialist crews and equipment (e.g. mortars, ammunitions), but not infantry (all fighting paratroopers are transported in armoured vehicles). Currently, the GAZ-66 is being replaced by the KamAZ-43501.

=== UAVs ===

* Compact recon complex &quot;Iskatel&quot; (The Seeker) with 2 UAVs
* UAV complex Orlan-10
* UAV complex Granat
* UAV complex Takhion
* Kamikaze FPV drone Boomerang
* ZALA Lancet kamikaze drone
* Albatross M5 reconnaissance drone

As late as 1999 many members of the Airborne Forces still wore old the old patch of the Soviet VDV on their uniform, either by itself or along with the Russian Armed Forces patch, which had been issued in 1994.

=== Paratroopers&#x27; Day celebrations ===

Russian airborne troops had their own holiday during the Soviet era, which continues to be celebrated on 2 August. Their most emblematic mark of distinction is a blue beret. VDV soldiers are often called &quot;blue berets&quot;. Each year, current and former paratroopers, often in an inebriated state, celebrate by meeting up and wandering city streets and parks. The day is notorious for two common sights: paratroopers frolicking in fountains and picking fights with hapless passers-by. On Airborne Forces Day in many Russian cities, it is customary to turn off the fountains and hold veteran reunions near those fountains.

=== Bands ===

The Combined Military Band of the Airborne Forces is an integral part of all the solemn events of the Airborne Forces. Every year, the band&#x27;s personnel take part in the Victory Parade on Red Square, as well as the opening ceremony of the International Army Games. In the ranks of the combined band were musicians of the military bands of the airborne and assault formations of the Airborne Forces. There were six other military bands in the airborne forces.

The Song and Dance Ensemble of the Airborne Forces is the theatrical troupe of the VDV. It began its creative activity in 1937, as the Red Army Song and Dance Ensemble of the Kiev Military District, numbering only 18 people. On 3 May 1945, three days after the signing of the German armistice, the ensemble gave a concert on the steps of the destroyed Reichstag.

During the Cold War, the unit was known as the Song and Dance Ensemble of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany. During this time, it had participated in concerts in the cities of East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. It gained its current status in 1994. The Song and Dance Ensemble also contains the Blue Berets musical group.

<doc id="177456" wikidata="Q1570367" url="?curid=177456" title="Problem of induction">
<text>The problem of induction is a philosophical problem that questions the rationality of predictions about unobserved things based on previous observations. These inferences from the observed to the unobserved are known as &quot;inductive inferences&quot;. David Hume, who first formulated the problem in 1739, argued that there is no non-circular way to justify inductive inferences, while he acknowledged that everyone does and must make such inferences.

The traditional inductivist view is that all claimed empirical laws, either in everyday life or through the scientific method, can be justified through some form of reasoning. The problem is that many philosophers tried to find such a justification but their proposals were not accepted by others. Identifying the inductivist view as the scientific view, C. D. Broad once said that induction is &quot;the glory of science and the scandal of philosophy&quot;. In contrast, Karl Popper&#x27;s critical rationalism claimed that inductive justifications are never used in science and proposed instead that science is based on the procedure of conjecturing hypotheses, deductively calculating consequences, and then empirically attempting to falsify them.

== Formulation of the problem ==
In inductive reasoning, one makes a series of observations and infers a claim based on them. For instance, from a series of observations that a woman walks her dog by the market at 8 am on Monday, it seems valid to infer that next Monday she will do the same, or that, in general, the woman walks her dog by the market every Monday. That next Monday the woman walks by the market merely adds to the series of observations, but it does not prove she will walk by the market every Monday. First of all, it is not certain, regardless of the number of observations, that the woman always walks by the market at 8 am on Monday. In fact, David Hume even argued that we cannot claim it is &quot;more probable&quot;, since this still requires the assumption that the past predicts the future.

Second, the observations themselves do not establish the validity of inductive reasoning, except inductively. Bertrand Russell illustrated this point in &quot;The Problems of Philosophy&quot;:

===Ancient and early modern origins===

====Pyrrhonism====
The works of the Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus contain the oldest surviving questioning of the validity of inductive reasoning. He wrote:
The focus upon the gap between the premises and conclusion present in the above passage appears different from Hume&#x27;s focus upon the circular reasoning of induction. However, Weintraub claims in &quot;The Philosophical Quarterly&quot; that although Sextus&#x27;s approach to the problem appears different, Hume&#x27;s approach was actually an application of another argument raised by Sextus:
Although the criterion argument applies to both deduction and induction, Weintraub believes that Sextus&#x27;s argument &quot;is precisely the strategy Hume invokes against induction: it cannot be justified, because the purported justification, being inductive, is circular.&quot; She concludes that &quot;Hume&#x27;s most important legacy is the supposition that the justification of induction is not analogous to that of deduction.&quot; She ends with a discussion of Hume&#x27;s implicit sanction of the validity of deduction, which Hume describes as intuitive in a manner analogous to modern foundationalism.

====Indian philosophy====
The Cārvāka, a materialist and skeptic school of Indian philosophy, used the problem of induction to point out the flaws in using inference as a way to gain valid knowledge. They held that since inference needed an invariable connection between the middle term and the predicate, and further, that since there was no way to establish this invariable connection, that the efficacy of inference as a means of valid knowledge could never be stated.

The 9th century Indian skeptic, Jayarasi Bhatta, also made an attack on inference, along with all means of knowledge, and showed by a type of reductio argument that there was no way to conclude universal relations from the observation of particular instances.

====Medieval philosophy====
Medieval writers such as al-Ghazali and William of Ockham connected the problem with God&#x27;s absolute power, asking how we can be certain that the world will continue behaving as expected when God could at any moment miraculously cause the opposite. Duns Scotus, however, argued that inductive inference from a finite number of particulars to a universal generalization was justified by &quot;a proposition reposing in the soul, &#x27;Whatever occurs in a great many instances by a cause that is not free, is the natural effect of that cause. Some 17th-century Jesuits argued that although God could create the end of the world at any moment, it was necessarily a rare event and hence our confidence that it would not happen very soon was largely justified.

=== David Hume ===
David Hume, a Scottish thinker of the Enlightenment era, is the philosopher most often associated with induction. His formulation of the problem of induction can be found in &quot;An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding&quot;, §4. Here, Hume introduces his famous distinction between &quot;relations of ideas&quot; and &quot;matters of fact&quot;. Relations of ideas are propositions which can be derived from deductive logic, which can be found in fields such as geometry and algebra. Matters of fact, meanwhile, are not verified through the workings of deductive logic but by experience. Specifically, matters of fact are established by making an inference about causes and effects from repeatedly observed experience. While relations of ideas are supported by reason alone, matters of fact must rely on the connection of a cause and effect through experience. Causes of effects cannot be linked through a priori reasoning, but by positing a &quot;necessary connection&quot; that depends on the &quot;uniformity of nature&quot;.

Hume situates his introduction to the problem of induction in &quot;A Treatise of Human Nature&quot; within his larger discussion on the nature of causes and effects (Book I, Part III, Section VI). He writes that reasoning alone cannot establish the grounds of causation. Instead, the human mind imputes causation to phenomena after repeatedly observing a connection between two objects. For Hume, establishing the link between causes and effects relies not on reasoning alone, but the observation of &quot;constant conjunction&quot; throughout one&#x27;s sensory experience. From this discussion, Hume goes on to present his formulation of the problem of induction in &quot;A Treatise of Human Nature&quot;, writing &quot;there can be no &quot;demonstrative&quot; arguments to prove, &quot;that those instances, of which we have had no experience, resemble those, of which we have had experience&quot;.&quot;

In other words, the problem of induction can be framed in the following way: we cannot apply a conclusion about a particular set of observations to a more general set of observations. While deductive logic allows one to arrive at a conclusion with certainty, inductive logic can only provide a conclusion that is probably true. It is mistaken to frame the difference between deductive and inductive logic as one between general to specific reasoning and specific to general reasoning. This is a common misperception about the difference between inductive and deductive thinking. According to the literal standards of logic, deductive reasoning arrives at certain conclusions while inductive reasoning arrives at probable conclusions. Hume&#x27;s treatment of induction helps to establish the grounds for probability, as he writes in &quot;A Treatise of Human Nature&quot; that &quot;probability is founded on the presumption of a resemblance betwixt those objects, of which we have had experience, and those, of which we have had none&quot; (Book I, Part III, Section VI).

Therefore, Hume establishes induction as the very grounds for attributing causation. There might be many effects which stem from a single cause. Over repeated observation, one establishes that a certain set of effects are linked to a certain set of causes. However, the future resemblance of these connections to connections observed in the past depends on induction. Induction allows one to conclude that &quot;Effect A2&quot; was caused by &quot;Cause A2&quot; because a connection between &quot;Effect A1&quot; and &quot;Cause A1&quot; was observed repeatedly in the past. Given that reason alone can not be sufficient to establish the grounds of induction, Hume implies that induction must be accomplished through imagination. One does not make an inductive reference through a priori reasoning, but through an imaginative step automatically taken by the mind.

Hume does not challenge that induction is performed by the human mind automatically, but rather hopes to show more clearly how much human inference depends on inductive—not a priori—reasoning. He does not deny future uses of induction, but shows that it is distinct from deductive reasoning, helps to ground causation, and wants to inquire more deeply into its validity. Hume offers no solution to the problem of induction himself. He prompts other thinkers and logicians to argue for the validity of induction as an ongoing dilemma for philosophy. A key issue with establishing the validity of induction is that one is tempted to use an inductive inference as a form of justification itself. This is because people commonly justify the validity of induction by pointing to the many instances in the past when induction proved to be accurate. For example, one might argue that it is valid to use inductive inference in the future because this type of reasoning has yielded accurate results in the past. However, this argument relies on an inductive premise itself—that past observations of induction being valid will mean that future observations of induction will also be valid. Thus, many solutions to the problem of induction tend to be circular.

===Nelson Goodman&#x27;s new riddle of induction===

Nelson Goodman&#x27;s &quot;Fact, Fiction, and Forecast&quot; (1955) presented a different description of the problem of induction in the chapter entitled &quot;The New Riddle of Induction&quot;. Goodman proposed the new predicate &quot;grue&quot;. Something is grue if and only if it has been (or will be, according to a scientific, general hypothesis) observed to be green before a certain time &quot;t&quot;, and blue if observed after that time. The &quot;new&quot; problem of induction is, since all emeralds we have ever seen are both green and grue, why do we suppose that after time &quot;t&quot; we will find green but not grue emeralds? The problem here raised is that two different inductions will be true and false under the same conditions. In other words:

* Given the observations of a lot of green emeralds, someone using a common language will inductively infer that all emeralds are green (therefore, he will believe that any emerald he will ever find will be green, even after time &quot;t&quot;).
* Given the same set of observations of green emeralds, someone using the predicate &quot;grue&quot; will inductively infer that all emeralds, which will be observed after &quot;t&quot;, will be blue, despite the fact that he observed only green emeralds so far.

One could argue, using Occam&#x27;s razor, that greenness is more likely than grueness because the concept of grueness is more complex than that of greenness. Goodman, however, points out that the predicate &quot;grue&quot; only appears more complex than the predicate &quot;green&quot; because we have defined grue in terms of blue and green. If we had always been brought up to think in terms of &quot;grue&quot; and &quot;bleen&quot; (where bleen is blue before time &quot;t&quot;, and green thereafter), we would intuitively consider &quot;green&quot; to be a crazy and complicated predicate. Goodman believed that which scientific hypotheses we favour depend on which predicates are &quot;entrenched&quot; in our language.

Willard Van Orman Quine offers a practical solution to this problem by making the metaphysical claim that only predicates that identify a &quot;natural kind&quot; (i.e. a real property of real things) can be legitimately used in a scientific hypothesis. R. Bhaskar also offers a practical solution to the problem. He argues that the problem of induction only arises if we deny the possibility of a reason for the predicate, located in the enduring nature of something. For example, we know that all emeralds are green, not because we have only ever seen green emeralds, but because the chemical make-up of emeralds insists that they must be green. If we were to change that structure, they would not be green. For instance, emeralds are a kind of green beryl, made green by trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium. Without these trace elements, the gems would be colourless.

==Notable interpretations==

===Hume===

Although induction is not made by reason, Hume observes that we nonetheless perform it and improve from it. He proposes a descriptive explanation for the nature of induction in §5 of the &quot;Enquiry&quot;, titled &quot;Skeptical solution of these doubts&quot;. It is by custom or habit that one draws the inductive connection described above, and &quot;without the influence of custom we would be entirely ignorant of every matter of fact beyond what is immediately present to the memory and senses&quot;. The result of custom is belief, which is instinctual and much stronger than imagination alone.

===John Maynard Keynes===
In his &quot;Treatise on Probability&quot;, John Maynard Keynes notes:
An inductive argument affirms, not that a certain matter of fact is so, but that relative to certain evidence there is a probability in its favour. The validity of the induction, relative to the original evidence, is not upset, therefore, if, as a fact, the truth turns out to be otherwise.
This approach was endorsed by Bertrand Russell.

===David Stove and Donald Williams===
David Stove&#x27;s argument for induction, based on the statistical syllogism, was presented in the &quot;Rationality of Induction&quot; and was developed from an argument put forward by one of Stove&#x27;s heroes, the late Donald Cary Williams (formerly Professor at Harvard) in his book &quot;The Ground of Induction&quot;. Stove argued that it is a statistical truth that the great majority of the possible subsets of specified size (as long as this size is not too small) are similar to the larger population to which they belong. For example, the majority of the subsets which contain 3000 ravens which you can form from the raven population are similar to the population itself (and this applies no matter how large the raven population is, as long as it is not infinite). Consequently, Stove argued that if you find yourself with such a subset then the chances are that this subset is one of the ones that are similar to the population, and so you are justified in concluding that it is likely that this subset &quot;matches&quot; the population reasonably closely. The situation would be analogous to drawing a ball out of a barrel of balls, 99% of which are red. In such a case you have a 99% chance of drawing a red ball. Similarly, when getting a sample of ravens the probability is very high that the sample is one of the matching or &quot;representative&quot; ones. So as long as you have no reason to think that your sample is an unrepresentative one, you are justified in thinking that probably (although not certainly) that it is.

===Biting the bullet: Keith Campbell and Claudio Costa===
An intuitive answer to Hume would be to say that a world inaccessible to any inductive procedure would simply not be conceivable. This intuition was taken into account by Keith Campbell by considering that, to be built, a concept must be reapplied, which demands a certain continuity in its object of application and consequently some openness to induction. Claudio Costa has noted that a future can only be a future of its own past if it holds some identity with it. Moreover, the nearer a future is to the point of junction with its past, the greater are the similarities tendentially involved. Consequently – &quot;contra&quot; Hume – some form of principle of homogeneity (causal or structural) between future and past must be warranted, which would make some inductive procedure always possible.

===Karl Popper===
Karl Popper, a philosopher of science, sought to solve the problem of induction. He argued that science does not use induction, and induction is in fact a myth. Instead, knowledge is created by conjecture and criticism. The main role of observations and experiments in science, he argued, is in attempts to criticize and refute existing theories.

According to Popper, the problem of induction as usually conceived is asking the wrong question: it is asking how to justify theories given they cannot be justified by induction. Popper argued that justification is not needed at all, and seeking justification &quot;begs for an authoritarian answer&quot;. Instead, Popper said, what should be done is to look to find and correct errors. Popper regarded theories that have survived criticism as better corroborated in proportion to the amount and stringency of the criticism, but, in sharp contrast to the inductivist theories of knowledge, emphatically as less likely to be true. Popper held that seeking for theories with a high probability of being true was a false goal that is in conflict with the search for knowledge. Science should seek for theories that are most probably false on the one hand (which is the same as saying that they are highly falsifiable and so there are many ways that they could turn out to be wrong), but still all actual attempts to falsify them have failed so far (that they are highly corroborated).

Wesley C. Salmon criticizes Popper on the grounds that predictions need to be made both for practical purposes and in order to test theories. That means Popperians need to make a selection from the number of unfalsified theories available to them, which is generally more than one. Popperians would wish to choose well-corroborated theories, in their sense of corroboration, but face a dilemma: either they are making the essentially inductive claim that a theory&#x27;s having survived criticism in the past means it will be a reliable predictor in the future; or Popperian corroboration is no indicator of predictive power at all, so there is no rational motivation for their preferred selection principle.

David Miller has criticized this kind of criticism by Salmon and others because it makes inductivist assumptions. Popper does not say that corroboration is an indicator of predictive power. The predictive power is in the theory itself, not in its corroboration. The rational motivation for choosing a well-corroborated theory is that it is simply easier to falsify: Well-corroborated means that at least one kind of experiment (already conducted at least once) could have falsified (but did not actually falsify) the one theory, while the same kind of experiment, regardless of its outcome, could not have falsified the other. So it is rational to choose the well-corroborated theory: It may not be more likely to be true, but if it is actually false, it is easier to get rid of when confronted with the conflicting evidence that will eventually turn up. Accordingly, it is wrong to consider corroboration as a reason, a justification for believing in a theory or as an argument in favor of a theory to convince someone who objects to it.

<doc id="177459" wikidata="Q4354575" url="?curid=177459" title="Adam–God doctrine">
<text>The Adam–God doctrine (or Adam–God theory) was a theological idea taught in mid-19th century Mormonism by Brigham Young, a president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Although the doctrine is rejected by the LDS Church today, it is still an accepted part of the modern theology of some Mormon fundamentalists.

According to Young, he was taught by Joseph Smith that Adam is &quot;our Father and our God, and the only God with whom we have to do.&quot;

According to the doctrine, Adam was once a mortal man who became resurrected and exalted. From another planet, he then came as Michael to form Earth. Adam then was given a physical body and a spouse, Eve, where they became mortal by eating the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden. After bearing mortal children and establishing the human race, Adam and Eve returned to their heavenly thrones, where Adam serves as God and is the Heavenly Father of humankind. Later, Adam returned to the Earth to the ancient prophets and to become the literal biological father of Jesus.

During the 19th century and the early 20th century, the Adam–God doctrine was featured as part of the church&#x27;s endowment ceremony. However, the notion was startling to many people when it was introduced and remained controversial, even within the Church. Many Latter Day Saints and some breakoff groups, the most notable being apostle Orson Pratt, rejected the doctrine in favor of more traditional understanding of Adam and Eve. Both he and other members, such as the Bunker family, would face the prospect of ecclesiastical punishment for their public opposition. Despite the objection of many, the doctrine persisted even after the administration of Brigham Young. His successor, John Taylor, privately affirmed his belief in the idea prior to his death in 1887. It wasn’t until about 1905 that the Adam-God doctrine was fully removed from the endowment ceremony. By this time, the doctrine fell out of favor within the LDS Church and was replaced by a theology more similar to Orson Pratt&#x27;s, as expounded by turn-of-the century Latter Day Saint theologians James E. Talmage, B. H. Roberts, and John A. Widtsoe. In 1976, church president Spencer W. Kimball stated the LDS Church does not support the doctrine. Most Latter Day Saints accept Adam as &quot;the Ancient of Days,&quot; &quot;father of all,&quot; and Michael the Archangel but do not recognize him as being God the Father. 

In contrast, many Mormon Fundamentalists have retained this doctrine as a chief principle of their faith. Several Fundamentalist authors, such as Ogden Kraut and Joseph W. Musser have written books on the subject highlighting the prominent role of Adam continues to play.

==Background==

Though Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, never used the term &quot;Adam–God&quot; in any of his recorded public statements, he provided several teachings from which the doctrine&#x27;s adherents draw support. For example, Smith taught in an 1839 sermon that Adam was actually the archangel Michael, who held the First Presidency in the premortal life. In the same sermon, Smith taught that Adam holds &quot;the keys of the universe,&quot; and so it is through his authority that all priesthood &quot;keys,&quot; the abilities to unlock particular priesthood powers, are revealed from heaven. In 1840, Smith taught that Adam is the one &quot;through whom Christ has been revealed from heaven, and will continue to be revealed from henceforth.&quot; Finally, Smith taught in his 1844 King Follett discourse that God was once a man &quot;like one of us.&quot;

Young and other adherents of the doctrine claim that Smith was its originator and that Smith privately taught it to them before his death, in 1844. However, the prevailing academic view is that the doctrine taught by Young and others was an elaboration of Smith&#x27;s vague references to Adam&#x27;s unique role in Latter Day Saint doctrine. Although Young is generally credited with originating the doctrine, the original source may also have been Young&#x27;s counselor in the First Presidency, Heber C. Kimball.

==Description==
The Adam–God doctrine teaches that Adam is the father of both the spirits and physical bodies of all humans born on Earth, including Jesus.

Under the doctrine, Adam had a number of roles. First, he was a creator god. He and his wife, Eve, had become gods by living a mortal life, becoming resurrected, and receiving their exaltation. As a god before the creation of the Earth, he was known as Michael, or the &quot;Ancient of Days.&quot; Michael was not the only creator god, however, as he was a member of a council of Earth&#x27;s creator gods, which also included the gods &quot;Elohim&quot; and &quot;Jehovah.&quot; In Smith&#x27;s original endowment ceremony, the gods involved in the creation were called &quot;Elohim, Jehovah, and Michael,&quot; but unlike in modern Latter Day Saint theology, &quot;Jehovah&quot; was not identified as Jesus. Rather, it was explained by Joseph F. Smith that &quot;Elohim, Jehovah and Michael are Father, Son, and Grandson. They made this Earth and Michael became Adam.&quot; Within the council, Jehovah and Michael were subordinate to Elohim and created the Earth, under the direction of Elohim. Michael was selected by the heads of this council of gods to be the Father of this Earth.

Also, the doctrine teaches that Michael was the father of the spirits in heaven who are associated with this Earth. With Eve, and possibly his other wives, Michael had fathered the spirits of spirit offspring in the preexistence. 

Next, the doctrine teaches that Michael came to the Earth with one of his wives, where they became known as Adam and Eve, and became the progenitor of the human race and the father of mortal bodies of all his spirit offspring so that they could progress and achieve godhood like themselves. The names &quot;Adam&quot; and &quot;Eve&quot; are titles that reflect their roles as the parents of humanity, Adam meaning man or &quot;[father] of mankind&quot; and Eve meaning the &quot;mother[s] of all living.&quot;The privilege of peopling the Earth was part of Adam and Eve&#x27;s eternal purpose as exalted beings and eternal parents of their spirit children. To bear mortal children, Adam and Eve had to take on mortal bodies. The bodies of Adam and Eve fell to a mortal state when they ate the fruit of tree of knowledge of good and evil in the Garden of Eden.

Then, the doctrine teaches that after his mortal existence, Adam returned to his throne and reigned as the immortal God of this Earth. He is thus considered to be the Biblical God of Israel. Smith stated that Adam&#x27;s ascension to godhood took place at or after a gathering at a holy place of the same name. Smith taught that a similar gathering is to prelude the second coming of Christ.

Finally, the doctrine teaches that Michael/Adam was the literal, biological father of the mortal body of Jesus.

==History==
===Brigham Young&#x27;s 1852 explanation ===
Whether or not Smith had taught the doctrine, the first recorded explanation of the doctrine using the term &quot;Adam–God&quot; was by Young, who first taught the doctrine at the church&#x27;s spring general conference on April 9, 1852. This sermon was recorded stenographically by George D. Watt, Young&#x27;s private secretary, who was an expert in Pitman shorthand. Watt published the sermon in 1854 in the British periodical &quot;Journal of Discourses&quot;, which was endorsed by Young and his counselors in the church&#x27;s First Presidency.

In Watt&#x27;s transcript of the sermon, Young said he intended to discuss &quot;who it was that begat the Son of the Virgin Mary,&quot; a subject which he said &quot;has remained a mystery in this kingdom up to this day.&quot; The transcript reads:
When our father Adam came into the garden of Eden, he came into it with a &quot;celestial body&quot;, and brought Eve, &quot;one of his wives&quot;, with him. He helped to make and organize this world. He is MICHAEL, &quot;the Archangel&quot;, the ANCIENT OF DAYS! about whom holy men have written and spoken—He is &quot;our&quot; FATHER &quot;and our&quot; GOD, &quot;and the only God with whom&quot; WE &quot;have to do&quot;. Every man upon the earth, professing Christians or non-professing, must hear it, and &quot;will know it sooner or later&quot;.

The transcript then reads: &quot;When the Virgin Mary conceived the child Jesus, the Father had begotten him in his own likeness. He was &quot;not&quot; begotten by the Holy Ghost. And who is the Father? He is the first of the human family.&quot; Young explained that Adam &quot;was begotten by &quot;his Father&quot; in heaven&quot; in the same way that Adam begat his own sons and daughters, and that there were &quot;three distinct characters, namely, Eloheim, Yahovah, and Michael.&quot; Then, reiterating, he said that &quot;Jesus, our elder brother, was begotten in the flesh by the same character that was in the Garden of Eden, and who is our Father in Heaven.&quot;

Young concluded, &quot;I could tell you much more about this; but were I to tell you the whole truth, blasphemy would be nothing to it, in the estimation of the superstitious and overrighteous mankind. Now, let all who may hear these doctrines, pause before they make light of them, or treat them with indifference, for they will prove their salvation or damnation.&quot;

===Further development by Young===
In a special conference on August 28, 1852, Young explained in greater detail the mechanism by which celestial beings like Adam and Eve could give birth to mortal offspring. According to Young, when a couple first become gods and goddesses, they first begin to create spiritual offspring. Then, they begin creating &quot;mortal tabernacles&quot; in which those spirits can dwell, by going to a newly created world, where they: &quot;eat and drink of the fruits of the corporal world, until this grosser matter is diffused sufficiently through their celestial bodies, to enable them according to the established laws to produce mortal tabernacles for their spiritual children.&quot; This is what Adam and Eve did, Young said, and &quot;Adam is my Father.&quot; 

On February 19, 1854, Young reiterated the doctrine in a sermon. He also reiterated the doctrine at the October 1854 general conference, in a sermon that was reported to have &quot;held the vast audience as it were spellbound.&quot; In the October conference, Young is reported as clarifying that Adam and Eve were &quot;natural father and mother of every spirit that comes to this planet, or that receives tabernacles on this planet, consequently we are brother and sisters, and that Adam was God, our Eternal Father.&quot;

When Young discussed the doctrine again in early 1857, he emphasized again that &quot;to become acquainted with our Father and our God&quot; was &quot;one of the first principles of the doctrine of salvation&quot;, and that &quot;no man can enjoy or be prepared for eternal life without that knowledge.&quot; Nevertheless, he later said:
Whether Adam is the personage that we should consider Our Heavenly Father, or not, is considerable of a mystery to a good many. I do not care for one moment how that is; it is no matter whether we are to consider Him our God, or whether His Father, or his Grandfather, for in either case we are of one species of one family and Jesus Christ is also of our species.

===Initial reactions to the doctrine===
The reaction within the Latter Day Saint community to Young&#x27;s Adam–God teachings was mixed. While many accepted the doctrine, others regarded it as misguided, or interpreted it to adhere to their prior understanding.

Young&#x27;s initial 1852 announcement of the doctrine was greeted by some as prophetic. For example, the clerk of the conference, Thomas Bullock, recorded that during Young&#x27;s sermon, &quot;the Holy Ghost rest[ed] upon him with great power.&quot; In a session of general conference the next day, Heber C. Kimball stated his agreement that &quot;the God and Father of Jesus Christ was Adam.&quot; Another apostle, Franklin D. Richards, accepted the doctrine &quot;that Adam is our Father and our God&quot; as well, stating in a conference held in June 1854 that &quot;the Prophet and Apostle Brigham has declared it, and that it is the word of the Lord.&quot;

Kimball readily adopted Young&#x27;s views, and preached on June 29, 1856, that &quot;I have learned by experience that there is but one God that pertains to this people, and He is the God that pertains to this earth—the first man. That first man sent his own Son to redeem the world.&quot;

A number of hymns acknowledging this doctrine were sung in local congregations of the LDS Church. One published in 1856, entitled &quot;We Believe in Our God&quot;, stated: &quot;We believe in our God the great Prince of His race, / The Archangel Michael, the Ancient of Days, / Our own Father Adam, earth&#x27;s Lord, as is plain.&quot; This hymn was not found in subsequent editions.

The first line of a poem published in 1861, titled &quot;Sons of Michael&quot;, stated: &quot;Sons of Michael, he approaches! / Rise; the Eternal Father greet.&quot; The poem is included as a hymn in the current LDS Church hymnal, but the wording has been altered from &quot;Eternal Father&quot; to &quot;ancient father&quot;.

Acceptance of the doctrine by the LDS Church continued through the 19th century. George Q. Cannon, a member of the First Presidency, when asked by his son about the conception of Jesus by Mary, asked &quot;What was to prevent Father Adam from visiting and overshadowing the mother of Jesus[?]&quot;

===Resistance to the doctrine===
However, some prominent members of the church took issue with the doctrine. Most significantly, apostle and philosopher Orson Pratt disagreed with the doctrine, and expressed that disagreement publicly and in private meetings with other apostles. Pratt also published his disagreement in his publication &quot;The Seer&quot; for which he was censured.

Pratt did, however, teach similar doctrines in the same publication. For example, he stated that on the way to exaltation, one would have to &quot;pass by&quot; and &quot;pay tribute to&quot; various apostles and prophets, then Jesus, and &quot;at length ... Father Adam.&quot; He said many would be surprised and humiliated, after passing by Jesus, to find &quot;Father Adam&quot; standing there; however, he said, &quot;those are ideas which do not concern us at present, although it is written in the Bible—&#x27;This is eternal life, to know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.&#x27;&quot;

Pratt continued to debate the issue in public forums for months, despite being rebuked privately and publicly by Young on more than one occasion , until 1860, when faced with possible disfellowshipment from the church for teaching false doctrine, Pratt agreed to the language of a public confession affirming the doctrine as &quot;the doctrine of the church.&quot; This confession was negotiated during a series of meetings among the church hierarchy .

A less open opposition to the doctrine may have been carried out by Latter Day Saint editors Samuel W. Richards and Franklin D. Richards who, according to one researcher, interpreted the idea of Adam being &quot;our God&quot; or &quot;our Father&quot; as meaning merely that Adam, as the first mortal man, stands at the head of the human family. For instance, &quot;the Lord made Moses a god to Pharaoh&quot; (Exodus 7:1) and as Paul was &quot;as Christ Jesus&quot; to the Galatians (4:14). In this way, Adam as our great progenitor, will preside over the human family as &quot;father and God.&quot;

===Adam–God in Young&#x27;s later administration===
After the public debates between Young and Pratt subsided in 1860, Young continued to maintain his belief in the doctrine, but may have been disappointed that the people did not give the doctrine universal acceptance. In 1861, he stated:
Some years ago, I advanced a doctrine with regard to Adam being our father and God, that will be a curse to many of the Elders of Israel because of their folly. With regard to it they yet grovel in darkness and will. It is one of the most glorious revealments of the economy of heaven, yet the world hold derision. Had I revealed the doctrine of baptism from [&quot;sic&quot;] the dead instead [of] Joseph Smith there are men around me who would have ridiculed the idea until dooms day [&quot;sic&quot;?]. But they are ignorant and stupid like the dumb ass.

Nevertheless, Young and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles continued to discuss the doctrine. In 1873, Young again taught the doctrine publicly, and indicated that when Adam came to the Earth, he left behind many wives other than Eve at the place from which Adam came; however, he said he was &quot;not disposed to give any farther knowledge concerning ... the great and glorious doctrine that pertains to this.&quot; &quot;How much unbelief exists in the minds of the Latter-day Saints in regard to one particular doctrine which is revealed to them, and which God revealed to me—namely that Adam is our father and God ... Our Father Adam is the man who stands at the gate and holds the keys of everlasting life and salvation to all his children who have or ever will come upon the earth.&quot;

Just before his death, Young took steps to ensure that the Adam–God doctrine was taught in the church&#x27;s temples as part of the endowment ceremony. In 1877, while he was standardizing the endowment for use in the St. George Temple, Young introduced as part of the endowment the &quot;lecture at the veil.&quot; The final draft of the lecture is today kept private in the St. George Temple. L. John Nuttall, Young&#x27;s secretary, recorded in his journal a transcription of Young&#x27;s temple lecture regarding the Adam-God doctrine. A portion of that journal entry reads as follows:

Adam was an immortal being when he came on this earth he had lived on an earth similar to ours … and had begotten all the spirit that was to come to this earth and Eve our common Mother who is the mother of all living bore those spirits in the celestial world ... Father Adam&#x27;s oldest son (Jesus the Saviour) who is the heir of the family is Father Adams first begotten in the spirit World. who according to the flesh is the only begotten as it is written. In his divinity he having gone back into the spirit World and come in the spirit [glory] to Mary and she conceived for when Adam and Eve got through with their Work in this earth. They did not lay their bodies down in the dust, but returned to the spirit World from whence they came.

===After Young&#x27;s death===
There is some controversy as to whether or not Young considered Adam–God to be official church doctrine. At the end of his 1852 sermon, he stated, &quot;Now, let all who may hear these doctrines, pause before they make light of them, or treat them with indifference, for they will prove their salvation or damnation.&quot; Nevertheless, in 1854, after a great deal of controversy concerning the doctrine, Young minimized the importance of the doctrine, stating that the &quot;subject ... does not immediately concern yours or my welfare ... I do not pretend to say that the items of doctrine and ideas I shall advance are necessary for the people to know.&quot;

After Young&#x27;s death, church leaders began to cast the various interpretations of this teaching as mere speculation and denied that any particular interpretation was binding on the church. In 1897, Joseph F. Smith, then an apostle and counselor in the First Presidency, wrote a private letter concerning Young&#x27;s teachings on Adam, stating:

The doctrine was never submitted to the councils of the Priesthood nor to the church for approval or ratification, and was never formally or otherwise accepted by the church. It is therefore in no sense binding upon the Church. Brigham Young&#x27;s &quot;bare mention&quot; was &quot;without indubitable evidence and authority being given of its truth.&quot; Only the scripture, the &quot;accepted word of God,&quot; is the Church&#x27;s standard.

Beginning around 1892, church leaders privately decided to no longer publicly teach the doctrine. In a private meeting held on April 4, 1897, church president Wilford Woodruff said. &quot;Adam is our father and God and no use to discuss it with [the] Josephites [Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints] or any one else.&quot;

In 1892, the doctrine was publicly opposed in St. George, Utah, by Edward Bunker. The First Presidency—Woodruff, George Q. Cannon, and Joseph F. Smith—traveled to St. George to address the issue. Records of the meeting state that Bunker was corrected: &quot;Pres Woodruff and Cannon showed ... that Adam was an immortal being when he came to this earth and was made the same as all other men and Gods are made.&quot; &quot;The doctrine preached and contended for by Father Edward Bunker of Bunkerville was investigated, condemned and Father Bunker set right. Presidents Woodruff and Cannon present.&quot;

After the start of the 20th century, church leaders openly took the position that the doctrine should no longer to be taught publicly.

As early as 1902, apostle Charles W. Penrose claimed, &quot;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has never formulated or adopted any theory concerning the subject treated upon by President Young as to Adam.&quot;

=== Current position of the LDS Church ===
Eventually, the doctrine was publicly denounced as false by LDS Church leaders. In 1976, church president Spencer W. Kimball stated, &quot;We denounce that theory and hope that everyone will be cautioned against this and other kinds of false doctrine.&quot;

In 1980, apostle Bruce R. McConkie gave a speech elaborating upon the church&#x27;s position towards the Adam–God theory:

There are those who believe or say they believe that Adam is our father and our god, that he is the father of our spirits and our bodies, and that he is the one we worship.

The devil keeps this heresy alive as a means of obtaining converts to cultism. It is contrary to the whole plan of salvation set forth in the scriptures, and anyone who has read the Book of Moses, and anyone who has received the temple endowment and who yet believes the Adam–God theory does not deserve to be saved.* Those who are so ensnared reject the living prophet and close their ears to the apostles of their day. &quot;We will follow those who went before.&quot; they say. And having so determined, they soon are ready to enter polygamous relationships that destroy their souls.

We worship the Father, in the name of the Son, by the power of the Holy Ghost; and Adam is their foremost servant, by whom the peopling of our planet was commenced.

Later the same year, apostle Mark E. Petersen stated:

Adam was not our God, nor was he our Savior. But he was the humble servant of both in his status as an angel.

God had only one begotten son in the flesh. But Adam had many, including Cain and Abel and Seth. He lived nearly a thousand years. He could have had hundreds of children in that time.

Then how could it be said by anyone that he had &quot;an only begotten&quot; son? How could all of his other children be accounted for? Were they not all begotten in the flesh?

Were Cain and Abel and Seth and their brothers and sisters all orphans? Was any child ever begotten without a father? Adam was their father, and he had many sons. In no way whatever does he qualify as a father who had only one son in the flesh.

Yet God our Eternal Father had only one son in the flesh, who was Jesus Christ.

Then was Adam our God, or did God become Adam? Ridiculous!

Adam was neither God nor the Only Begotten Son of God. He was a child of God in the spirit as we all are (see Acts 17:29). Jesus was the firstborn in the spirit, and the only one born to God in the flesh.

If any of you have been confused by false teachers who come among us, if you have been assailed by advocates of erroneous doctrines, counsel with your priesthood leaders. They will not lead you astray, but will direct you into paths of truth and salvation.

===Acceptance by Mormon fundamentalists===
Today, few Latter Day Saint denominations still believe in the Adam-God Doctrine because it has been repudiated by many leaders and theologians. However, adherents of Mormon fundamentalism generally accept the Adam–God doctrine. 

The mainstream LDS Church&#x27;s disavowal of the doctrine contributes to what fundamentalists perceive to be a general intellectual or spiritual retreat from important principles that were rejected due to unpopularity. Along with the practice of plural marriage, belief in the Adam–God doctrine became a defining aspect of the Mormon fundamentalist movement. The main belief of the Mormon fundamentalist (FLDS) is plural marriage. Mormon fundamentalists generally believe they are adhering to original church doctrines.

====Apostolic United Brethren====
The Apostolic United Brethren (AUB), a fundamentalist Mormon group, accepts the Adam–God teaching. Their leader Joseph W. Musser wrote a book on the topic the 1930s, titled &quot;Michael, Our Father and Our God&quot;. In the book, Musser contended that the rejection of the doctrine by the LDS Church can be linked to its rejection of plural marriage, which occurred around the same time:

And let us here remind the reader that as long as belief in the Patriarchal order of marriage and other advanced principles of the Gospel was maintained, the minds of the Saints were open and receptive. ... But with the surrender of the glorious principle of Celestial Marriage—a union for time and eternity—came darkness, mental drowsiness, a detour from the Gospel path, until all sorts of speculation pertaining to the plan of Salvation was indulged in.
====School of the Prophets====
The School of the Prophets a small branch led by Robert Crossfield and headquartered in Salem, Utah, claims revelation showing that Young was inaccurate in some points of his Adam–God teachings, but otherwise he was correct. The understanding from these revelations is that Jesus was the Only Begotten Son in the flesh of the Savior of the previous Earth where the father of all Spirits, Michael/Adam, had his mortal probation. The lineage of Michael/Adam, which includes all but Jesus on this Earth, will never become saviors of worlds. Thus the Adam–God doctrine of Young is simply a fuller understanding of the New Testament doctrine of joint-heirs with Christ. The Crossfield denomination was described in the book &quot;Under the Banner of Heaven&quot;, among other works.

<doc id="177464" wikidata="Q161723" url="?curid=177464" title="T.A.T.u.">
<text>t.A.T.u. (, ) were a Russian pop duo consisting of Lena Katina and Julia Volkova. The two started out as part of the children&#x27;s musical group Neposedy before being managed by producer and director Ivan Shapovalov and signing with Russian record label Neformat. t.A.T.u.&#x27;s debut album &quot;200 Po Vstrechnoy&quot; (2001) was a commercial success in Eastern Europe, and that resulted in the duo signing with Interscope Records to release its English-language counterpart, &quot;200 km/h in the Wrong Lane&quot; (2002). The album was certified platinum by the IFPI for one million copies sold in Europe and became the first album by a foreign group to reach number one in Japan. It was also certified gold in the United States and included the international hits &quot;All the Things She Said&quot; and &quot;Not Gonna Get Us&quot;. The duo represented Russia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2003 with the song &quot;Ne ver, ne boysya&quot;, finishing third. t.A.T.u. is one of the few Russian performers who have achieved international success along with Alla Pugacheva and Anna Netrebko.

t.A.T.u. released their second international album, &quot;Dangerous and Moving&quot;, alongside its Russian equvalent, &quot;Lyudi Invalidy&quot;, in 2005, with the group reaching moderate success after parting ways with Shapovalov. The former was promoted with the international hit &quot;All About Us&quot;. The duo ventured into other projects, such as creating their own production company T.A. Music and promoting the film inspired by their story, &quot;You and I&quot; (2008). Their last pair of albums, &quot;Vesyolye Ulybki&quot; and &quot;Waste Management&quot;, followed between 2008 and 2009, respectively. t.A.T.u. officially broke up in 2011, with Katina and Volkova pursuing solo careers. They reunited to perform at special occasions, such as the opening ceremony of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, in subsequent years.

==History==

===1999: Formation===

Before production of t.A.T.u. began, the pair were in a group named Neposedi. Both Lena Katina and Julia Volkova were part of the band, along with members Sergey Lazarev and Vlad Topalov. Katina was also in a band named &quot;Avenue&quot; between 1994 and 1997. It was reported that Volkova was banned from being in Neposedi, amid claims she was misbehaving and disrupting other members in the group, along with being accused of smoking, swearing and drinking. However, Neposedi denied the claims and said that Volkova aged out of the group.

t.A.T.u. were formed in 1999 by Ivan Shapovalov and his friend/business partner Alexander Voitinskiy, who developed plans to create a musical project in Russia. With this idea in mind, Shapovalov and Voitinskiy organized auditions in Moscow in early 1999 for teenage female vocalists. By the end of auditioning, the partners narrowed their search down to ten girls, including the members that finally became t.A.T.u., Lena Katina and Julia Volkova. Katina and Volkova knew each other before the auditions. Both girls stood out among the others because of their appearance and vocal experience, but the producers decided to start with 14-year-old Katina, who sang &quot;It Must Have Been Love&quot; by Roxette. Katina began recording demos, including &quot;Yugoslavia&quot;, a protest song about NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. After the demos were cut, Shapovalov insisted that another girl be added to the project. Thus, in late 1999, 14-year-old Julia Volkova was added to the group to complete the duo. She also started recording not long after Katina&#x27;s &quot;Yugoslavia&quot; demo was finished.

According to Katina, Shapovalov was inspired to create the duo after the release of the Swedish film &quot;Show Me Love&quot; which focused on the romance between two school girls. After completing the duo, the producers decided on the name &quot;Тату&quot; (Tatu). Sounding like the English word &quot;tattoo&quot;, it is also a shortened version of the Russian phrase &quot;Та любит ту&quot; (&quot;ta lyubit tu&quot;), meaning &quot;This [girl] loves that [girl]&quot;. For the release of their first English-language album, they decided to go by t.A.T.u., using uppercase letters and periods to distinguish themselves from an already existing Australian band, Tatu.

=== 2000–2001: &quot;200 Po Vstrechnoy&quot; ===
Over the next year, Katina and Volkova recorded songs with their producers. Voitinskij left the project, and Shapovalov signed Elena Kiper as co-producer and co-writer for their debut album. 

The first single was completed in 2000, titled &quot;Ya Soshla S Uma&quot; (later released in English as &quot;All the Things She Said&quot;). The song describes the turmoil in a girl&#x27;s soul because she is in love with another girl, but is afraid, as society frowns upon this. She asks her parents for forgiveness. Elena Kiper has been credited with the song, explaining that the idea came to her when she fell asleep at her dentist&#x27;s office and had a dream in which she kissed another woman. She woke up saying out loud, &quot;Я сошла с ума!&quot; (Ya soshla s uma, meaning &quot;I&#x27;ve lost my mind&quot;). Ivan Shapovalov is said to have added the second phrase of the chorus, &quot;Мне нужна она&quot; (Mne nuzhna ona, meaning &quot;I need her&quot;).

Their first album, &quot;200 Po Vstrechnoy&quot; was released on 21 May 2001. Their second single, &quot;Nas Ne Dogonyat&quot;, which was only released in music video form rather than as an official CD single, although a promotional conjoined &quot;Ya Soshla s Uma/Nas Ne Dagonyat&quot; was released in Poland. This was followed by the third single &quot;30 Minut&quot;, only available as a music video. The album was eventually released in Japan, where it was certified gold by RIAJ. The group went on tour in 2001, where their routines were described as &quot;precise&quot; and featured routines where the girls had to strip. The tour appeared in countries including Germany, Bulgaria, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and Israel.

===2002–2003: &quot;200 km/h in the Wrong Lane&quot; and Eurovision===
The American music executive Jimmy Iovine asked the English producer Trevor Horn to create English-language versions of Tatu&#x27;s songs. Horn wrote new lyrics for &quot;All the Things She Said&quot; and &quot;Not Gonna Get Us&quot; and coached t.A.T.u. to sing them in English. He also rerecorded the instruments, as he did not have access to the original multitracks. He described Shapovalov as &quot;awful&quot; and removed him from the sessions after he made the girls cry. Horn said later: &quot;There&#x27;s no shortcut, you can&#x27;t bully people.&quot; The group was &quot;controlled&quot; by Shapovalov and it was reported that he was &quot;strict&quot; during the process of making the album.

The English version of the album was released in December 2002 as &quot;200 km/h in the Wrong Lane&quot;. The first single from the album was &quot;All the Things She Said&quot; which was released in late summer 2002. The song peaked at the top spot in Australia, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The music video caused controversy worldwide, due to the members, who were both 17 at the time of the video&#x27;s production, kissing behind a fence. Some believed the video promoted lesbianism and pedophilia and some branded the group&#x27;s music as &quot;paedophilic pop&quot;. 

The group announced their &quot;Show Me Love Tour&quot;, which was to commence in the United Kingdom. However, both of their proposed concerts in the UK were cancelled due to poor ticket sales. In July 2002, &quot;Blender&quot; praised the group by saying &quot;We have seen the future of rock &amp; roll ... to say you&#x27;ve never seen or heard anything quite like it is a colossal understatement.&quot; t.A.T.u. were then heralded by &quot;The Face&quot; magazine as &quot;The hottest popstars in the world right now.&quot;
On 25 February 2003 the women mocked NBC&#x27;s insistence that they neither kiss nor comment on the Iraq war by performing &quot;All the Things She Said&quot; in white &quot;T-shirts that bore the Russian language message Khuy Voyne! (Fuck the war!) across the front, and by blocking their faces with their hands as they kissed during a break in their performance.&quot;

The &quot;Fuck the War!&quot; T-shirts were banned on the &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; show and replaced with T-shirts that said &quot;Censored&quot;. They still wrote the term on Jimmy Kimmel&#x27;s hand.

The next single &quot;Not Gonna Get Us&quot; was released in February 2003. Though not as popular as their debut single, it managed to have success in most record charts. The group then released their third single &quot;30 Minutes&quot;, which premiered only in Europe. A music video followed after the release. The fourth single, &quot;How Soon Is Now?&quot;, was a cover of the song by the Smiths and came out in May 2003. The same month, Shapovalov was arrested after arranging filming for the group&#x27;s music video &quot;Show Me Love&quot; in Moscow&#x27;s Red Square despite his application for filming being refused. Shapovalov also attempted to film near London&#x27;s Big Ben and various other locations. The footage that was recorded was later used for a music video for the song &quot;Show Me Love&quot;, despite the song not being released in any country other than Poland.

Also in May 2003, t.A.T.u. represented Russia at Eurovision Song Contest 2003, where they placed third. After the contest, Russia&#x27;s Channel One complained that Irish broadcaster RTÉ (Ireland&#x27;s national television broadcaster) had used a back-up jury, and that it had cost them victory; RTÉ did not use the televoting results after some network problems. A statement by Channel One suggested that there were grounds to believe that the contest results could be much different for Russia. RTÉ responded by publishing the unused results of the Irish televote, which showed that had the jury not been used, Turkey, whose entry was also overlooked by the Irish Jury, would still have won. The group&#x27;s record label, Universal Music Russia, were originally against the group&#x27;s participation saying that the Eurovision contest was for &quot;young artists&quot; and said &quot;artists of Tatu&#x27;s level will not get much out of the participation in it, We [Universal] would much rather prefer the group to work on their new album, and not to participate in contests for rising stars [...]&quot;

The same month, the group postponed their German promo tour due to a late invitation to the 2003 MTV Movie Awards, where they performed. The following month they also cancelled their Riga concert and Japan concert in June, which led to a lawsuit from Pasadena Group Promotion, asking for $180,000 in damages.

On 26 September 2003, the group released a remix compilation, titled &quot;Remixes&quot;. In November 2003, the CD was released in Russia, with two new tracks and videos. The two new tracks were &quot;Prostiye Dvizheniya&quot;, a controversial single that came out in Russia in summer 2002,
and &quot;Ne ver, ne boysya&quot;, their entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2003. The DVD compilation &quot;Screaming for More&quot; was released on 24 November 2003, featuring music videos and behind-the-scenes. &quot;Anatomy of t.A.T.u.&quot; aired on Russian television on 12 December 2003. The documentary revealed that the girls were not lesbians and chronicled the group as they took part in Eurovision earlier in the year.

===2004–2006: &quot;Dangerous and Moving&quot; and &quot;Lyudi Invalidy&quot;===
In early 2004, t.A.T.u. legally broke their contract with Ivan Shapovalov and Neformat. In the months before the split, t.A.T.u. and Shapovalov were being filmed for a reality show on STS in Russia titled &quot;Podnebesnaya&quot;. The show followed the group as they were recording their second album, to little success, with their producer Ivan Shapovalov. The documentary aired on Russian television from January to March 2004.

There were many rumors around the split until the show aired, which depicted the group leaving due to a lack of interest and care from their producer. They also claimed the quality of the music being produced was too low, and that Shapovalov was only interested in creating scandals. Volkova stated, &quot;He [Ivan] spends his time thinking up scandals instead of planning our artistic work. I&#x27;m sure our fans would rather hear new songs and new albums than new scandals.&quot; Katina then stated, &quot;He made us out to BE lesbians when we were just singing FOR lesbians. We wanted people to understand them and not judge them. That they are as free as anyone else.&quot; In one of the final episodes, Volkova mentioned returning to the United States in spring of 2004 to record with new producers. However, she became pregnant soon thereafter, and recording was delayed.

Volkova soon joined Katina and previous producer Sergio Galoyan in the studio. The group was backed by their record label, Universal Music International, in finding adequate songs and production to release a new album. In August 2005, &quot;All About Us&quot; and &quot;Lyudi Invalidy&quot; were announced to be the first singles from the English and Russian albums, respectively. &quot;All About Us&quot; was a worldwide hit, charting in the top ten in the majority of European charts. The group released their second English album on 5 October 2005 titled &quot;Dangerous and Moving&quot;. Its Russian counterpart was released on 19 October, titled &quot;Lyudi Invalidy&quot;. The second single was &quot;Friend or Foe&quot;. Soon after the video was released, the group&#x27;s management replaced drummer Roman Ratej with Steve &quot;Boomstick&quot; Wilson, and appointed a new bassist, Domen Vajevec. On 25 March 2006, t.A.T.u. received the award for Best Group at the first edition of the &quot;TRL Awards&quot;.

On 17 April 2006, t.A.T.u. returned to reality TV in Russia with &quot;t.A.T.u. Expedition&quot;, which was broadcast on the Russian music channel Muz TV. It chronicled the release of their second album, and the recording of the video for their third single, &quot;Gomenasai&quot;, which was released during the airing of the show. The video, as well as the actual song, is quite a departure from t.A.T.u.&#x27;s usual style and leaves many of their fans cold. t.A.T.u. performed in Saint Petersburg, Russia on 28 April kicking off their Dangerous and Moving Tour. On 30 August 2006, the official website announced that the girls had left their record company, Universal/Interscope.

On 21 November 2006, the region of the Komi Republic in Russia filed a lawsuit against t.A.T.u. over the album and song &quot;Lyudi Invalidy&quot; due to the title translating to &quot;disabled people&quot;. Leonid Vakuev, a human rights representative for the Komi Republic, interpreted the song as being directed towards disabled people and cited words written in the booklet for the album, which said: &quot;[Lyudi Invalidy] do not know what it means to be a human being. They are fakes inside the human form. They do not live, but — function&quot;. Katina said, &quot;Of course, we meant moral invalids, people who do not have [a] soul and human feelings.&quot; When asked if they had anything against disabled people, she stated that she finds it offensive to refer to people by that term, and added, &quot;We take pictures together and make sure they have priority seats [at concerts].&quot;

In 2006, Russian politician Aleksey Mitrofanov proposed t.A.T.u. to be awarded the Order of Friendship, but the State Duma vetoed his idea. Mitrofanov came to write a novel inspired by the duo, &quot;t.A.T.u. Come Back&quot; (Russian: ТАТУ КАМ БЭК), which was also adapted into the film &quot;You and I&quot;.

===2007–2010: &quot;Vesyolye Ulybki&quot; and &quot;Waste Management&quot;===
On 17 May 2007, t.A.T.u. issued a statement directed to their gay fans: &quot;When t.A.T.u.&#x27;s second album came out, many of our fans of alternative sexual orientation thought that we lied and betrayed them. This is not true! We’ve never done that and we’ve always advocated love without boundaries.&quot; On 26 May, they flew out to Moscow to take part in the Moscow Gay Pride demonstration.

On 12 September 2007, the group released the concert DVD &quot;Truth&quot;. It was the group&#x27;s first release since leaving Universal. In late 2007, &quot;Белый Плащик&quot;, &quot;Beliy Plaschik&quot;, the lead single from their upcoming Russian-language album, was released. The project was then known as &quot;Управление Отбросами&quot;, &quot;Upravleniye Otbrosami&quot;, which translates to &quot;Waste Management&quot;. The second single, &quot;220&quot; (&quot;Двести Двадцать&quot;, Dvesti Dvadtsat&#x27;), made its radio premiere in May 2008 and the music video was released on their official YouTube channel on 5 June 2008. &quot;Beliy Plaschik&quot; and &quot;220&quot; were the main attractions on a special release known as &quot;Hyperion-Plate&quot;, the first-ever EP from the duo. The EP was released on 8 May 2008 and featured multimedia content including music, video, ringtones and wallpapers.
At the time of the &quot;Hyperion-Plate&quot; release, &quot;Upravleniye Otbrosami / Управление отбросами&quot; was scheduled to hit the stores in June 2008. The EP featured a poster which advertised that date, as well as a coupon redeemable for a discount on the album that expired on 30 June 2008. However, the release schedule abruptly stalled on 5 June 2008, when t.A.T.u.&#x27;s manager Boris Renski announced that Julia Volkova was seriously ill. Volkova&#x27;s illness forced the cancellation of a concert in Santa Clara, CA, and the singer was not seen in public until the wedding of producer Sergey Konov on 5 July 2008. The duo returned to work in late August, when it was reported that t.A.T.u. would be the face of fashion designer Marc Jacobs&#x27;s fall and winter campaigns in Russia.

On 9 September 2008, a press release appeared on the duo&#x27;s official website that declared that the forthcoming album would be titled &quot;Веселые Улыбки&quot;, &quot;Vesyolye Ulybki&quot; (&quot;Happy Smiles&quot;) instead of &quot;Upravleniye Otbrosami&quot; (&quot;Waste Management&quot;). The name change reflected sarcastic comments about the state of the Russian music business made by Volkova and Katina in an interview with Moscow&#x27;s Time Out Magazine. The press release also provided the track list of the album and an early version of its cover art, but still no confirmed release date was given. On 12 September, the album&#x27;s third single, &quot;You and I&quot; made its debut on Love Radio. The press release disappeared from the site shortly afterward, only to re-appear on 8 October with a change made to the cover art --- where there was once the face of a smiling astronaut on the original design, a black square now appeared.

On 15 October, t.A.T.u.&#x27;s website announced that &quot;Vesyolye Ulybki&quot; would be released on 21 October 2008, beginning with a special event at two Soyuz record stores in Moscow where fans could meet the girls and get their autographs. The album also went on pre-sale at the official t.A.T.u. web shop on 18 October, with a small number of buyers receiving a limited-edition postcard set as a prize. The songs were also made available internationally through the iTunes digital music store. Upon its release, it became apparent that the album essentially had two covers --- the astronaut cover was a slipcase, while the original design used for &quot;Upravleniye Otbrosami&quot; appeared inside. The black square from the press release had been hiding a Mars scene.

On 23 October, t.A.T.u. appeared on Vladimir Polupanov&#x27;s &quot;The 7 Premieres&quot; to promote their new album. They were also the subjects of an ongoing mini-reality series on the website Russia.ru. On 21 October 2008 &quot;Vesyolye Ulybki&quot; was released internationally on online music stores. On 28 November t.A.T.u. were awarded the Legend of MTV at the MTV Russia Music Awards 2008.

In March 2009, a statement was released on the duo&#x27;s site and MySpace stating that the duo will no longer be a &quot;full-time&quot; project and that Katina and Volkova were working on solo projects. They also mentioned that the third video will be released on 17 April on MTV Russia. The album&#x27;s single &quot;Snegopady&quot; was eventually released, along with its music video.

The girls performed a special concert at the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 on 10 May. They were also included as an interval act on the 12th at the first semifinals, performing Not Gonna Get Us with the Russian Army Choir.

On 13 July, the group released their single &quot;Snowfalls&quot;. The song was released digitally worldwide, along with its music video. The group&#x27;s second single for the album, &quot;White Robe&quot;, was released by Coqueiro Verde Records online and premiered on t.A.T.u.&#x27;s YouTube account. t.A.T.u.&#x27;s official website announced that the video was up for voting on MTV Brazil on 10 November 2009. On 3 December, the &quot;White Robe&quot; video reached the number one position on MTV Brazil. It was announced via Twitter that Coqueiro Verde Records would release the album in Brazil on 25 January 2010. The album was eventually released worldwide digitally, and received favorable reception from critics. The album did not sell very well and was reported to have only sold over 1000 copies in the United States, as of December 2010.
The third single off the album was &quot;Sparks&quot;, which was the English version of &quot;220&quot;. It was released in Brazil and on t.A.T.u.&#x27;s official YouTube account on 13 April 2010. On 31 March 2010, a contest was to be launched in which fans will be able to remix their favorite t.A.T.u. songs from the new album. The winning mixes would be included on an upcoming remix album.

Volkova made headlines in Russia with an interview where she expressed her opinion on Katina&#x27;s solo career, &quot;She has the right to [sing t.A.T.u. songs], but it&#x27;s so stupid, absolutely stupid. If you do a solo career, it means that you do your own work. Her stuff, that she makes, I think, is silly and very soon her career will wither away and disappear.&quot; Katina responded to this interview via her YouTube Page, &quot;I saw Julia&#x27;s interview. Of course I got upset. But I want to tell everybody that I have a completely opposite attitude towards the whole situation, Julia&#x27;s project included. I believe she&#x27;s a very talented person and I sincerely hope that she&#x27;ll be successful in all the things she plans.&quot;

In July, Katina made an appearance on a radio station where she was asked about the future of the duo. She responded by saying, &quot;Life has changed a lot. Julia and I are working on our projects now. I, for one, will be traveling to Los Angeles this Saturday, where I will keep working on my album. And I&#x27;m preparing a big show in San Francisco in September, so now we are not planning to reform t.A.T.u., certainly not in the near future. Now we really want to concentrate only on our own projects.&quot; Lena Katina and her full band performed her first live major solo show in San Francisco on 17 September 2010.

===2011: Disbandment===
At the end of March 2011, t.A.T.u. management released a press release on their official website declaring t.A.T.u. over. Due to conflicts between the two women, and them both wanting to pursue solo careers, the duo was officially announced as disbanded. They finalised the duo&#x27;s discography with a double remix album for &quot;Waste Management&quot;. The management thanked fans for their loyalty over the past twelve years of the duo&#x27;s history.

After the split, the group decided to focus on their solo careers, both musically and in film. In August 2011, Katina revealed her debut solo single &quot;Never Forget&quot; which eventually charted at number one on the US Hot Dance Club Songs for a sole week. Volkova was also working on her studio album and released two singles; &quot;All Because of You&quot; and &quot;Didn&#x27;t Wanna Do It&quot;, but failed to generate interest on the music charts. The following year she confirmed she would be starring in the dark comedy zombie film &quot;9 1/2 Zombies&quot;.

===2012–2021: Aftermath with Volkova and Katina arguments===
On 2 October 2012, Cherrytree Records/Universal Russia announced that they would be issuing a special re-release of t.A.T.u&#x27;s &quot;200 km/h in the Wrong Lane.&quot; The &quot;10th Year Anniversary Edition&quot; featured all new artwork, a never-before-released song from the 2002 sessions, &quot;A Simple Motion&quot;, a brand new remix of &quot;All the Things She Said&quot; from producer Fernando Garibay, in addition to newly mastered songs. On 24 October 2012, Cherrytree Records released the official track listing for the album; it was a note addressed to fans handwritten and signed by Katina and Volkova themselves. The album was released on 12 November 2012.

On 11 December 2012, the duo reunited as musical guests on &quot;The Voice of Romania&quot;. It was their first performance together in three years. The duo t.A.T.u performed &quot;All About Us&quot; and &quot;All the Things She Said&quot; during the show. They also appeared in radio and on another television show before.

After the re-release, the group were interviewed by Bradley Stern on MuuMuse, and was asked about a reunion and relationship together. Volkova stated &quot;We don&#x27;t keep in touch&quot;, while Katina stated &quot;Only when we see each other. We have very different lives in different countries now. We are not in a fight though.&quot; As for a reunion, Katina said &quot;I believe that there is always a chance for anything in this life. Maybe….&quot; Volkova stated that, while she is not &quot;ready for it&quot;, she said &quot;But this won&#x27;t stop us from reuniting for joint performances. We’ll see what happens!&quot;

In April 2013, the group announced they would perform one live show at a Russian VIP Club. Katina also stated that &quot;The t.A.T.u. comeback is very possible, we are talking about that right now.&quot; After Volkova had her second surgery for her ligaments, she officially confirmed that she and Katina were planning to reunite t.A.T.u. However, soon Volkova told an interviewer that they were not reuniting after all. Katina also stated that her solo career was the number one goal at that time and if t.A.T.u. was going to reunite, it would only be for small things like commercials and concerts.

On 27 September 2013, t.A.T.u. performed a concert in Kyiv, Ukraine. Shortly thereafter they wore their schoolgirls outfits from their first album again for a Snickers Japanese advertisement. Whilst in Japan they also performed &quot;All the Things She Said&quot; live in Tokyo.

The duo performed before the opening ceremony of the 2014 Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony in Sochi, along with piano virtuoso Denis Matsuev and opera soprano Anna Netrebko, who also performed the Olympic anthem. Media reports expressed confusion at this performance, given that there is a lack of LGBT rights in Russia, especially since the much politicized Russian law banning gay propaganda aimed at minors that is being used to promote family values. The ceremony&#x27;s director, Konstantin Ernst, said t.A.T.u.&#x27;s &quot;Not Gonna Get Us&quot; was chosen because it&#x27;s one of the few Russian pop songs that international viewers might recognize.

Shortly after performing at the Olympics, the group announced a new single, &quot;Lyubov v Kazhdom Mgnovenii&quot; (&quot;Love in Every Moment&quot;). The song features Russian rapper Ligalize and Canadian musician Mike Tompkins.

On 17 February 2014, Katina posted a video message on her official YouTube channel stating that she would no longer be working with Volkova and that t.A.T.u. was once again no longer a group. However, on 20 February, Volkova posted a video message saying that there is &quot;no big reunion&quot; but t.A.T.u. were having &quot;joint projects&quot;. She also criticized Katina&#x27;s &quot;meaning&quot; behind the video and confirmed that they would be shooting the video for the new single. On 5 March 2014, Volkova posted another video message on her official YouTube channel in response to Katina&#x27;s video. She stated that despite &quot;reasons of severe trepidation on the part of Lena about [Volkova] and [her] behavior,&quot; collaboration between the two was possible, referring to the release of their new single as well as their music video.

On 6 April 2014, the music video to &quot;Love in Every Moment&quot; was released to the Cornetto Ru page on YouTube, in which Katina and Volkova filmed their scenes apart. Towards the end of the video, Volkova is shown interacting with a body double of Katina, with the latter&#x27;s face obscured. The song is part of the &quot;A Sight of Cupid&quot; project which contains several short films about love. In the short film &quot;Together Apart&quot; the duo were portrayed as cupids. On 22 May 2014, both singers introduced the film at the Cannes Film Festival. Due to their conflict and in keeping with Katina&#x27;s wishes to not interact with Volkova, both singers had separate interviews with reporters. Volkova announced during an interview with the Italian press that the film would be the last collaborative work between her and Katina. Despite tensions, a petition dubbed &quot;#tATuComeback&quot; was circulated throughout popular social media websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, in the hopes that the former duo would resolve their conflicts and return with their long-awaited comeback as they had originally planned.

On 16 May 2016, the duo met publicly again at the 25th anniversary celebration of the children&#x27;s musical group Neposedy, which both were a part of before the formation of t.A.T.u. There, together with the children, Katina sang her song &quot;All Around the World&quot; and, together with Volkova, everybody sang &quot;Nas Ne Dogonyat” (&quot;Not Gonna Get Us&quot;).

On 8 June 2021, a lengthy interview and documentary about t.A.T.u.&#x27;s story titled &quot;ТАТУ: 20 лет спустя! Главная российская группа в мире&quot; was published on YouTube on journalist Ksenia Sobchak&#x27;s channel. The documentary discussed the formation of the group, its past controversies and Katina&#x27;s and Volkova&#x27;s personal and career developments after t.A.T.u. It also included interviews of former t.A.T.u. producer Ivan Shapovalov and Lena Katina&#x27;s mother. Katina and Volkova were interviewed separately, as Katina rejected a common interview. The interview/documentary was the most trending video on Russian YouTube the day after it was published.

===2022–present: Return to the stage===

Katina announced that t.A.T.u. would return to the stage in 2022. They had participated in the t.A.T.u. tribute concert which was originally supposed to be in 2021. However, due to persistent issues with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, they decided to postpone until spring 2022. In September 2022, Katina and Volkova performed together under the name t.A.T.u. at the Dinamo Stadium in Minsk as part of the Ovion Show event. This was followed by another performance at a sporting event at the Gazprom Stadium in Saint-Petersburg in May 2023.

==Artistry and controversies==

===Public image===

Throughout their career, the group received criticism, particularly after the release of &quot;All the Things She Said&quot;. In his AllMusic review of &quot;200 km/h in the Wrong Lane&quot;, Stephen Thomas Erlewine labelled the band as an &quot;exceptionally tawdry gimmick&quot;. In 2003, after the release of their video of &quot;All the Things She Said&quot;, some UK presenters campaigned to ban the video worldwide. Despite subsequent reports that the BBC had banned the video from their pre-watershed programme &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, the BBC quickly denied the ban, stating only that they had better footage to show.

Just before the recording of their third studio album &quot;Dangerous and Moving&quot;, it was announced that Volkova was pregnant. This led to critics accusing the girls of being &quot;fake&quot; lesbians, although Katina and Volkova had said in the past they were not &quot;together&quot; or &quot;in a relationship&quot;.

The group have appeared on &quot;Forbes&quot;″s Top 50 Richest Stars of Russia twice, ranking sixth in 2006, with an estimated income of $3.3 million, and thirty-sixth in 2007, with an income of $1.4 million. The group received the FHM Special Award for being the Top 100 Sexiest Woman. Both Katina and Volkova have been ranked on &quot;Maxim&quot; Russia&#x27;s Top 100 Sexiest Girls, with Katina at fifty-three and Volkova at fifteen. The group also appeared on the cover of &quot;Maxim&quot;.

===Cancellations of concerts controversy===
Between the years of 2002 and 2004, t.A.T.u. caused controversy for cancelling several concerts and tours around the world. In March 2003, the group announced dates for their &quot;Show Me Love Promo Tour&quot; in the United Kingdom. However the next month, just days before they were due to perform, the group dropped the dates and did not perform at the concert, due to poor ticket sales. BBC News stated that only a fraction of the tickets were sold for the concert and said the stadiums (held in London and Manchester) had capacities of around 10,000. A spokesman from their label, Interscope, did not understand why the cancellation took place.

In May 2003, t.A.T.u.&#x27;s management were sued by the promoters EEM Group for the cancellations of the concerts. EEM sued their management for £300,000, claiming they put &quot;unachievable and numerous obstacles&quot; in the way of ticket sales for the shows. They also claimed that Volkova&#x27;s illness was a reason for the cancellation; however, due to the lack of evidence, the lawsuit was discarded. After the lawsuit, the group also cancelled their Asian promo tour for Japan and China, due to Volkova&#x27;s sickness, stating that she needed urgent surgery. The same month, the group postponed their German Promo tour, due to a late invitation to the 2003 MTV Movie Awards, where they performed. The following month they also cancelled their Riga concert and Japan concert in June, which led to a lawsuit from Pasadena Group Promotion, asking $180,000 in damages, as they did not receive any official letters regarding the cancellation.

While promoting their studio album &quot;Dangerous and Moving&quot;, the group cancelled their appearances in Chile due to poor ticket sales and the withdrawal of one of the Chilean sponsors. One month later, the group cancelled their tour at the last minute, due to inadequate stage preparation and poor ticket sales. In September 2009, several dates in Russia were cancelled due to the 22 July Tupolev Tu-154 plane crash.

===Legacy===
&quot;All the Things She Said&quot; was ranked at number 452 in &quot;Blender&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born&quot;. The song was listed at number 8 on the &quot;AOL&quot;&#x27;s Top 100 Pop Songs of the Decade. Rebecca Bary from &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; listed the song at number five on their Top Ten Best Singles of 2003. Bill Lamb from &quot;About.com&quot; listed the song on his Top 100 Pop Songs of 2003 at number 31 and on his Top 10 Contemporary Girl Group Songs at number ten.

In 2008, the group received the MTV Legend award by MTV Russia. The group is the most successful Russian musical export of all time. Katina stated to &quot;Billboard&quot; Magazine; &quot;People will remember us for great songs, being free, taking life as it is and not being afraid of anything, [There were] provocative images of two girls kissing each other, but the second thing was the really great music.&quot; In 2006, both women were awarded &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; by GQ&#x27;s Person of the Year Awards, but were not awarded under the band name.

==Productions and T.A. Music==
When t.A.T.u. was first formed by Shapovalov, &quot;Neformat&quot; was created as the group&#x27;s production company, with Shapovalov and Renski at the head. In 2004, the company was dissolved when t.A.T.u. left Shapovalov.

Since 2005, T.A. Music has been the Moscow-based production company of t.A.T.u. The liner notes that accompanied the release of &quot;Dangerous and Moving&quot; said that the company was composed of t.A.T.u., Boris Renski, Dasha Mischenko, and Andrey Artischev. After t.A.T.u. broke ties with Universal Music in 2006, it was announced in 2008 that T.A. Music would become the duo&#x27;s record label, although only currently in the Russian market. &quot;Vesyolye Ulybki&quot; was released internationally on iTunes through the T.A. Music label. T.A. Music also now acts as the label and management company for Lena Katina&#x27;s solo project.

<text>The term professional student has two uses in the university setting:

*In the United States and Canada, if not elsewhere, a professional student is a student majoring in what are considered the professional degrees. These include Doctor of Education (Ed.D.), Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (D.V.M.), Law (J.D. or LL.B.), Dentistry (D.D.S. or D.M.D.), Medicine (M.D. or D.O.), Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT), Engineering, Business Administration (M.B.A.), Nursing (B.Sc.N.), and Pharmacy (Pharm.D. or B.Sc.Phm.), as well as many others.
*&quot;Professional student&quot; is a slang term commonly used in colleges to describe a student who stays in school for many years rather than embarking on a career. To avoid these types, some four-year colleges have imposed limits on the length of time students can be enrolled in order to open up their limited slots to new students. However, those colleges allow for demonstrated exceptions (e.g., a student who holds down a full-time occupation or has a family to raise, who is clearly demonstrating progress toward a degree). See: perpetual student.
*A less common meaning for &quot;professional student&quot; is an individual who makes a living writing papers and doing college work in exchange for pay from other people.</text><links>

<doc id="177472" wikidata="Q1065792" url="?curid=177472" title="WonderSwan">
<text>The is a handheld game console released in Japan by Bandai. It was developed by Gunpei Yokoi&#x27;s company Koto Laboratory and Bandai, and was the last piece of hardware Yokoi developed before his death in 1997. Released in 1999 in the sixth generation of video game consoles, the WonderSwan and its two later models, the WonderSwan Color and SwanCrystal, were officially supported until being discontinued by Bandai in 2003. During its lifespan, no variation of the WonderSwan was released outside of Japan.

Powered by a 16-bit processor, the WonderSwan took advantage of a low price point and long battery life in comparison to its competition, Nintendo&#x27;s Game Boy Color and SNK&#x27;s Neo Geo Pocket Color. Later improvements took advantage of quality upgrades to the handheld&#x27;s screen and added color. The WonderSwan is playable both vertically and horizontally, and features a unique library of games, including numerous first-party titles based on licensed anime properties, as well as significant third-party support from developers such as Squaresoft, Namco, Capcom and Banpresto.

Overall, the WonderSwan in all its variations combined to sell an estimated 3.5 million units and managed to obtain as much as 8% of the Japanese handheld video game console market before being marginalized by Nintendo&#x27;s Game Boy Advance. Retrospective feedback praises the potential of the WonderSwan despite its low sales and briefly holding its own against Nintendo in the marketplace.

==History==
Founded in 1950 by Naoharu Yamashina, Bandai was originally a manufacturer of toy cars and plastic models, but became a major player in the toy industry through the licensing of popular anime characters beginning with &quot;Tetsuwan Atomu&quot; in 1963. In the 1970s, Bandai manufactured both LCD games based on television programs and dedicated consoles. In 1982, the company released the Intellivision in Japan, and in 1985 it became one of the first third-party licensees on the Family Computer. However, the company&#x27;s greatest success in electronic games, was the Tamagotchi virtual pet first released in 1996. Despite plans for Bandai to merge with Sega to form Sega Bandai Ltd. in 1997, the merger was called off suddenly. Bandai&#x27;s board of directors decided to oppose the merger less than a week after approving it, and Sega in turn decided to accept Bandai&#x27;s actions at an emergency board meeting later that day. Bandai president Makoto Yamashina took responsibility for failing to gain the support of his company for the merger. As a result, Bandai entered the market without outside support.

Engineer Gunpei Yokoi is known for creating the Game Boy handheld system at Nintendo. After the failure of the Virtual Boy, however, he left the company in 1996 in order to create his own engineering firm, Koto Laboratory. It was then that Bandai approached Yokoi to create the WonderSwan to compete with the Game Boy. Yokoi was involved in development of the new handheld, but died in 1997 in a car accident before it was released.

The WonderSwan was officially unveiled in Tokyo on October 8, 1998. Bandai chose the name of the system to highlight its aesthetics and technical capabilities because the swan is recognized as an elegant bird with powerful legs that aid its graceful swimming. The company promised a 30-hour battery life, a low retail price, and a launch lineup of roughly fifty games.
The WonderSwan launched on March 4, 1999 and was available in nine casing colors: pearl white, skeleton green, silver metallic, skeleton pink, blue metallic, skeleton blue, skeleton black, camouflage, and gold. Three limited edition two-tone models were also released in frozen mint, sherbet melon and soda blue. These colors were chosen through an online poll at Bandai’s website, with the metallic and pearl white models being discontinued on July 22 to make room for the special two-tone editions. Despite Nintendo&#x27;s release of the Game Boy Color five months before, Bandai remained confident that the WonderSwan and its monochromatic screen would perform well because the original black-and-white Game Boy had previously been more successful than its color-screen competitors, the Game Gear and Atari Lynx, on the basis of its battery life and the quality of its game library. With a retail price , the WonderSwan was also cheaper than its competition. In 2000, Bandai signed an agreement with Mattel to bring the handheld to North America, but ultimately decided against a Western release. The exact reason for this is unknown, but the crowded handheld video game console market has been suggested as a factor.

Later that year, Bandai announced the which would incorporate a color screen while retaining backward compatibility with the original WonderSwan. It was released on December 9 in Japan and was available in pearl blue, pearl pink, crystal black, crystal blue, and crystal orange. The launch was a moderate success, with the system selling 270,632 units in under a month after its release. Before the WonderSwan Color could be released, however, Nintendo announced the Game Boy Advance, which featured superior hardware. The WonderSwan Color still retailed at a lower price point at compared to the Advance at , but despite peaking at 8% of the handheld market share in Japan, the WonderSwan&#x27;s sales never recovered after the Game Boy Advance reached store shelves in March 2001.

A redesign of the WonderSwan Color, titled , was released in Japan on July 12, 2002 for , less than the Game Boy Advance. Once again, Bandai held a poll on its website to determine casing colors and released the system in blue violet, wine red, crystal blue, and crystal black. Despite its low price and an improved LCD screen, the SwanCrystal was unable to compete, so Bandai discontinued the WonderSwan line in 2003 due to low demand and backed out of producing video game hardware altogether. In all, the handheld sold 3.5 million units, of which 1.55 million were of the original WonderSwan and at least 1.1 million were of the WonderSwan Color.

==Technical specifications==

The main CPU of the WonderSwan is a 16-bit NEC V30 MZ, a variant of the Intel 8086. The original model&#x27;s screen is capable of displaying up to eight shades of gray, in contrast to the four displayed by the WonderSwan&#x27;s main competitor, the Game Boy. Similar to the Atari Lynx, the handheld has an extra set of buttons allowing the console to be played at different angles; for the WonderSwan, these buttons were used to allow gamers to play games in both the portrait and landscape orientations. The WonderSwan series are all powered by a single AA battery, with the original monochrome version having a battery life of 40 hours. It also allows players to record their personal information, such as their name, birth date, and blood type, which can then be accessed and used by the game. Its LCD screen is and displays at a resolution of 224 × 144. Its sound capabilities consist of four PCM channels, each of which can play 32-sample, 4-bit sounds at selectable volume and pitch levels.

The physical measurements of the WonderSwan Color are , slightly larger than the original WonderSwan, and it weighs . Its CPU is a 3.072 MHz NEC V30 MZ, and it includes 512 kbit of RAM, which is shared between the video RAM and the work RAM. The screen on the WonderSwan Color can display up to 241 colors out of a palette of 4096, and up to 28 sprites per line. It offers backward compatibility with all previous WonderSwan titles. Its LCD screen is also larger than that of the original WonderSwan, measuring . The WonderSwan Color has an approximate battery life of 20 hours. The SwanCrystal improves upon the design of the WonderSwan Color through the use of a TFT LCD monitor, which has a superior response time to the FSTN monitor used in the former system. This helped to reduce motion blur in the handheld&#x27;s graphics. The unit&#x27;s case was also redesigned to be more durable. Its approximate battery life is 15 hours. The original WonderSwan&#x27;s cartridges were solid black, while the WonderSwan Color&#x27;s cartridges were clear. Games for the original WonderSwan would not display additional coloring on a WonderSwan Color and retain its original grayscale.

Several features and accessories were developed for the WonderSwan. The WonderWitch is an official software development kit aimed at amateur programmers that was released by Qute Corporation. It sold at a cost of and allows for games to be developed in the C programming language. An adapter was created to connect headphones to the handheld, as the WonderSwan lacks a headphone port. A remote-controlled robot known as the WonderBorg can be operated through the unit. In addition, the handheld can be connected to a PocketStation, a memory card peripheral for the PlayStation console, through a device known as the WonderWave. The WonderSwan and its later models were also capable of connecting to the internet via a mobile phone network.

==Game library==
Koto Laboratories claims that the WonderSwan sold 10 million game cartridges in all. In developing games for the WonderSwan, Bandai leveraged the assistance of several developers. Banpresto—part-owned by Bandai at the time—added support by way of anime licenses and licensed titles, while Namco and Capcom also developed titles for the handheld. Squaresoft contributed remakes of &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot;, and &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;, which later also came to the Game Boy Advance. Taito contributed well-received ports such as &quot;Space Invaders&quot; and &quot;Densha de Go!&quot;. Bandai augmented these releases with games of its own, including exclusive titles in the &quot;Digimon&quot; and &quot;Gundam&quot; franchises. To compete with &quot;Tetris&quot;, Gunpei Yokoi developed a puzzle game for the system ultimately named &quot;Gunpey&quot; in his honor. A sequel known as &quot;Gunpey EX&quot; was a launch title for the WonderSwan Color. Certain games produced through the WonderWitch kit, such as &quot;Judgement Silversword&quot;, have also been noted as excellent titles.

Support for the WonderSwan has been considered underwhelming. Although some well known third-party developers supported the console, most publishers continued to exclusively support Nintendo&#x27;s handhelds. The departure of Squaresoft as a developer and its return to Nintendo has been cited as a factor in the WonderSwan&#x27;s diminishing sales in later years. After the discontinuation of the WonderSwan in 2003, several developers ported WonderSwan games to the Game Boy Advance.

==Reception==
Selling 3.5 million units, the WonderSwan only picked up 8% of the marketshare in Japan and was ultimately outperformed by Nintendo&#x27;s Game Boy Advance. Due to its brightly colored screen and deep game library, the Game Boy Advance ensured Nintendo would have a near-monopoly on the handheld console market in Japan until the release of the PlayStation Portable by Sony in 2004.

Retrospective feedback to the handheld praises its accomplishments but defines it as a &quot;niche&quot; device that appeals to only certain gamers. Writing for &quot;USgamer&quot;, Jeremy Parish considers the WonderSwan the ultimate expression of Gunpei Yokoi&#x27;s design philosophy and notes its modest impact on the market, but blames Bandai for its lack of success: &quot;While WonderSwan ultimately will be remembered as a highly localized blip in the history of handheld games, as a platform it genuinely held its own... the system&#x27;s obscurity resulted more from poor timing and Bandai&#x27;s strangely meek strategy, not from any inherent flaws in the design of the machine itself&quot;. Parish also goes on to hypothesize on the lack of a WonderSwan release in North America, stating, &quot;given how hard it was to find Neo Geo Pocket systems and games at U.S. retail, it&#x27;s hard to imagine they were clamoring for yet another niche portable from Japan&quot;. Luke Plunkett from &quot;Kotaku&quot; praised the WonderSwan&#x27;s challenge to Nintendo, saying that &quot;it tried some pretty unique and interesting things, and put up a much sterner fight than most other handhelds ever managed&quot;. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot;&#x27;s Kim Wild criticizes some aspects of the handheld, including its lack of a headphone and AC port, as well as its poor control scheme for left-handed individuals and inability to play multiplayer link games with the headphone adapter connected. Wild offers some praise for the handheld, however, stating &quot;what [Bandai] managed with the WonderSwan was impressive given the competition. The low price even today makes it more than worthy of consideration&quot;.

<text>Vietglish, Vinglish or Vietlish, is an informal term for a mixture of elements from Vietnamese and English.

The term &quot;Vietglish&quot; is first recorded in 1969. Other colloquial portmanteau words for Vietlish include (chronologically): &quot;Vietglish&quot; (1992), &quot;Vinish&quot; (2003), &quot;Vinglish&quot; (2010) and &quot;Vietnamiglish&quot; (2016).

This usage is said to be found in Vietnamese immigrant communities in majority-English-speaking countries. Borrowed English words are also commonly used in everyday Vietnamese both inside and outside Vietnam in informal contexts.

<text>Spanglish (a blend of the words &quot;Spanish&quot; and &quot;English&quot;) is any language variety (such as a contact dialect, hybrid language, pidgin, or creole language) that results from conversationally combining Spanish and English. The term is mostly used in the United States and refers to a blend of the words and grammar of the two languages. More narrowly, Spanglish can specifically mean a variety of Spanish with heavy use of English loanwords. 

Since different Spanglish arises independently in different regions of varying degrees of bilingualism, it reflects the locally spoken varieties of English and Spanish. Different forms of Spanglish are not necessarily mutually intelligible.

The term &quot;Spanglish&quot; was first recorded in 1933. It corresponds to the Spanish terms Espanglish (from &quot;Español&quot; + &quot;English&quot;, introduced by the Puerto Rican poet Salvador Tió in the late 1940s), &quot;Ingléspañol&quot; (from &quot;Inglés&quot; + &quot;Español&quot;), and &quot;Inglañol&quot; (&quot;Inglés&quot; + &quot;Español&quot;).

There is no single, universal definition of Spanglish. The term Spanglish has been used in reference to the following phenomena, all of which are distinct from each other: 

* The use of integrated English loanwords in Spanish
* Nonassimilated Anglicisms (i.e., with English phonetics) in Spanish
* Calques and loan translations from English
* Code switching, particularly intra-sentential (i.e., within the same clause) switches
* Grammar mistakes in Spanish found among transitional bilingual speakers 
* Second-language Spanish, including poor translations
* Mock Spanish

==History and distribution==
In the late 1940s, the Puerto Rican journalist, poet, and essayist Salvador Tió coined the terms &quot;Espanglish&quot; for Spanish spoken with some English terms, and the less commonly used &quot;Inglañol&quot; for English spoken with some Spanish terms.

After Puerto Rico became a United States territory in 1898, Spanglish became progressively more common there as the United States Army and the early colonial administration tried to impose the English language on island residents. Between 1902 and 1948, the main language of instruction in public schools (used for all subjects except for Spanish class) was English. Currently Puerto Rico is nearly unique in having both English and Spanish as its official languages (see also New Mexico). Consequently, many American English words are now found in the vocabulary of Puerto Rican Spanish. &quot;Spanglish&quot; may also be known by different regional names.

Spanglish does not have one unified dialect—specifically, the varieties of Spanglish spoken in New York, Florida, Texas, and California differ. Monolingual speakers of standard Spanish may have difficulty in understanding it.
It is common in Panama, where the 96-year (1903–1999) U.S. control of the Panama Canal influenced much of local society, especially among the former residents of the Panama Canal Zone, the Zonians.

Many Puerto Ricans living on the island of St. Croix speak in informal situations a unique Spanglish-like combination of Puerto Rican Spanish and the local Crucian dialect of Virgin Islands Creole English, which is very different from the Spanglish spoken elsewhere. A similar situation exists in the large Puerto Rican-descended populations of New York City and Boston.

Spanglish is spoken commonly in the modern United States. According to the Pew Research Center, the population of Hispanics grew from 35.3 million to 62.1 million between 2000 and 2020. Hispanics have become the largest minority ethnic group in the US. More than 60% are of Mexican descent. Mexican Americans form one of the fastest-growing groups, increasing from 20.9 million to 37.2 million between 2000 and 2021. Around 58% of this community chose California, especially Southern California, as their new home. Spanglish is widely used throughout the heavily Mexican-American and other Hispanic communities of Southern California.
The use of Spanglish has become important to Hispanic communities throughout the United States in areas such as Miami, New York City, Texas, and California. In Miami, the Afro-Cuban community makes use of a Spanglish familiarly known as &quot;Cubonics,&quot; a portmanteau of the words &quot;Cuban&quot; and &quot;Ebonics&quot;, a slang term for African American Vernacular English that is itself a portmanteau of &quot;Ebony&quot; and &quot;phonics&quot;.&quot;

Many Mexican-Americans (&quot;Chicanos&quot;), immigrants and bilinguals express themselves in various forms of Spanglish. For many, Spanglish serves as a basis for self-identity, but others believe that it should not exist.
Spanglish is difficult, because if the speaker learned the two languages in separate contexts, they use the &quot;conditioned system&quot;, in which the referential meanings in the two languages differ considerably. Those who were literate in their first language before learning the other, and who have support to maintain that literacy, are sometimes those least able to master their second language. Spanglish is part of &quot;receptive bilingualism.&quot; Receptive bilinguals are those who understand a second language but don&#x27;t speak it. That is when they use Spanglish. Receptive bilinguals are also known as &quot;productively bilingual&quot;, since, to give an answer, the speaker exerts much more mental effort to answer in English, Spanish, or Spanglish. Without first understanding the culture and history of the region where Spanglish evolved as a practical matter an in depth familiarizing with multiple cultures. This knowledge, indeed the mere fact of one&#x27;s having that knowledge, often forms an important part of both what one considers one&#x27;s personal identity and what others consider one&#x27;s identity.

Other places where similar mixed codes are spoken are Gibraltar (&quot;Llanito&quot;), Belize (&quot;Kitchen Spanish&quot;), Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao (along with Dutch and Papiamento). 

In Australasia, forms of Spanglish are used among Spanish-speaking migrants and diasporic communities. In particular, Hispanophone Australians frequently use loanwords/phrases from Australian English, in conversations that are otherwise in Spanish; examples include &quot;&quot;el&quot; rubbish bin&quot;, &quot;&quot;la&quot; vacuum cleaner&quot;, &quot;&quot;el&quot; mobile&quot;, &quot;&quot;el&quot; toilet&quot;, &quot;&quot;vivo en un&quot; flat &quot;pequeño&quot;, &quot;voy a correr con mis&quot; runners&quot;, and &quot;&quot;la librería de la&quot; city &quot;es grande&quot;&quot;. Similar phenomena occur amongst native Spanish speakers in New Zealand.

==Usage==

===Spanglish patterns===
Spanglish is informal, although speakers can consistently judge the grammaticality of a phrase or sentence. From a linguistic point of view, Spanglish often is mistakenly labeled many things. Spanglish is not a creole or dialect of Spanish because, though people claim they are native Spanglish speakers, Spanglish itself is not a language on its own, but speakers speak English or Spanish with a heavy influence from the other language. The definition of Spanglish has been unclearly explained by scholars and linguists, contributing to misconceptions. Spanglish is the fluid exchange of language between English and Spanish, present in the heavy influence in the words and phrases used by the speaker. Spanglish is currently considered a hybrid language practice by linguists. Some linguists refer to Spanglish as &quot;Spanish-English code-switching&quot;, though there is some influence of borrowing, and lexical and grammatical shifts as well.

The inception of Spanglish is due to the influx of native Spanish speaking Latin American people into North America, specifically the United States of America. As mentioned previously, the phenomenon of Spanglish can be separated into two different categories: code-switching, and borrowing, lexical and grammatical shifts. Code-switching has sparked controversy because it is seen &quot;as a corruption of Spanish and English, a &#x27;linguistic pollution&#x27; or &#x27;the language of a &quot;raced&quot;, underclass people&#x27;&quot;. For example, a fluent bilingual speaker addressing another bilingual speaker might engage in code-switching with the sentence, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry I cannot attend next week&#x27;s meeting &quot;porque tengo una obligación de negocios en Boston, pero espero que&quot; I&#x27;ll be back for the meeting the week after&quot;—which means, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry I cannot attend next week&#x27;s meeting because I have a business obligation in Boston, but I hope to be back for the meeting the week after&quot;.

===Calques===
Calques are translations of entire words or phrases from one language into another. They represent the simplest forms of Spanglish, as they undergo no lexical or grammatical structural change. The use of calques is common throughout most languages, evident in the calques of Arabic exclamations used in Spanish.

Examples:
* &quot;to call back&quot; → (llamar pa&#x27; atrás, llamar para atrás) (, )
* &quot;It&#x27;s up to you.&quot; → (Está pa&#x27; arriba de ti, Está para arriba de ti) ( (You decide))
* &quot;to be up to ...&quot; → (estar pa&#x27; arriba de ..., estar para arriba de ...) (depender de ... or X decida (X decides))
* &quot;to run for governor&quot; → ()
A well-known calque is or in expressions such as &#x27;to call back&#x27;. Here, reflects the particle &quot;back&quot; in various English phrasal verbs.
Expressions with are found in every stable English-Spanish contact situation: the United States, including among the isolated Isleño and Sabine River communities, Gibraltar, and sporadically in Trinidad and along the Caribbean coast of Central America where the local English varieties are heavily creolized. Meanwhile, they&#x27;re unattested in
non-contact varieties of Spanish.
 expressions are unique as a calque of an English verbal particle, since other phrasal verbs and particles are almost never calqued into Spanish.
Because of this, and because they&#x27;re consistent with existing Spanish grammar, argues they are likely a result of a conceptual, not linguistic loan.
That is, the notion of &quot;backness&quot; has been expanded in these contact varieties.

===Semantic extensions===
Semantic extension or reassignment refers to a phenomenon where speakers use a word of language A (typically Spanish in this case) with the meaning of its cognate in language B (typically English), rather than its standard meaning in language A. In Spanglish this usually occurs in the case of &quot;false friends&quot; (similar to, but technically not the same as false cognates), where words of similar form in Spanish and English are thought to have like meanings based on their cognate relationship.

Examples:
An example of this lexical phenomenon in Spanglish is the emergence of new verbs when the productive Spanish verb-making suffix &quot;-ear&quot; is attached to an English verb. For example, the Spanish verb for &quot;to eat lunch&quot; (&quot;almorzar&quot; in standard Spanish) becomes &quot;lonchear&quot; (occasionally &quot;lunchear&quot;). The same process produces &quot;watchear&quot;, &quot;parquear&quot;, &quot;emailear&quot;, &quot;twittear&quot;, etc.

===Loanwords===
Loanwords occur in any language due to the presence of items or ideas not present in the culture before, such as modern technology. The increasing rate of technological growth requires the use of loan words from the donor language due to the lack of its definition in the lexicon of the main language. This partially deals with the &quot;prestige&quot; of the donor language, which either forms a dissimilar or more similar word from the loan word. The growth of modern technology can be seen in the expressions: &quot;hacer click&quot; (to click), &quot;mandar un email&quot; (to send an email), &quot;faxear&quot; (to fax), &quot;textear&quot; (to text-message), or &quot;hackear&quot; (to hack). Some words borrowed from the donor languages are adapted to the language, while others remain unassimilated (e. g. &quot;sandwich&quot;, &quot;jeans&quot; or &quot;laptop&quot;). The items most associated with Spanglish refer to words assimilated into the main morphology. Immigrants are usually responsible for &quot;Spanishizing&quot; English words. According to The New York Times, &quot;Spanishizing&quot; is accomplished &quot;by pronouncing an English word &#x27;Spanish style&#x27; (dropping final consonants, softening others, replacing M&#x27;s with N&#x27;s and V&#x27;s with B&#x27;s), and spelled by transliterating the result using Spanish spelling conventions.&quot;

====Examples====
*&quot;Aseguranza&quot; (insurance; &quot;seguros&quot; is insurance in standard Spanish, aseguranza is literally &quot;assurance&quot; which is similar to the Prudential Insurance company&#x27;s slogan, &quot;peace of mind&quot;)
*&quot;Biles&quot; (bills)
*&quot;Chorcha&quot; (church)
*&quot;Ganga&quot; (gang)
*&quot;Líder&quot; (leader) – considered an established Anglicism 
*&quot;Lonchear/Lonchar&quot; (to have lunch)
*&quot;Marqueta&quot; (market)
*&quot;Taipear/Tipear&quot; (to type)
*&quot;Troca&quot; (truck) – Widely used in most of northern Mexico as well
*”Mitin” (meeting) – An outdoors gathering of people mostly for political purposes.
*”Checar” (to check)
*”Escanear” (to scan) – To digitalize (e.g. a document).
*”Chatear” (to chat) 
*“Desorden” (disorder) – incorrectly used as “disease”.
*”Condición” (condition) – incorrectly used as “sickness”.
*&quot;Viaje de las Estrellas&quot; - &quot;Star Trek&quot;; the television shows such as &quot;King of the Hill&quot; and &quot;MadTV&quot; sometimes used standard Spanish but in an elementary manner.

===&quot;So&quot;-insertion===
Within the US, the English word &quot;so&quot; is often inserted into Spanish discourse. This use of &quot;so&quot; is found in conversations that otherwise take place entirely in Spanish. Its users run the gamut from Spanish-dominant immigrants to native, balanced bilinguals to English-dominant semi-speakers and second-language speakers of Spanish, and even people who reject the use of Anglicisms have been found using &quot;so&quot; in Spanish.
Whether &quot;so&quot; is a simple loanword, or part of some deeper form of language mixing, is disputed. Many consider &quot;so&quot; to simply be a loanword, although borrowing short function words is quite abnormal.
In stressed positions, &quot;so&quot; is usually pronounced with English phonetics, and speakers typically identify it as an English word and not an established English loan such as . This is unusual, since code-switched or lexically inserted words typically aren&#x27;t as common and recurring as &quot;so&quot; is.

&quot;So&quot; is always used as a coordinating conjunction in Spanish. It can be used phrase-internally, or at the beginning or end of a sentence. In Spanish discourse, &quot;so&quot; is never used to mean &quot;in order that&quot; as it often is in English. As a sociolinguistic phenomenon, speakers who subconsciously insert &quot;so&quot; into their Spanish usually spend most of their time speaking English. This and other facts suggest that the insertion of &quot;so&quot; and similar items such as &quot;you know&quot; and &quot;I mean&quot; are the result of a kind of &quot;metalinguistic bracketing&quot;. That is, discourse in Spanish is circumscribed by English and by a small group of English functional words. These terms can act as punctuation for Spanish dialogue within an English-dominant environment.

=== Fromlostiano ===

Fromlostiano is a type of artificial and humorous wordplay that translates Spanish idioms word-for-word into English. The name &quot;fromlostiano&quot; comes from the expression &quot;From Lost to the River&quot;, which is a word-for-word translation of &quot;de perdidos al río&quot;; an idiom that means that one is prone to choose a particularly risky action in a desperate situation (this is somewhat comparable to the English idiom &quot;in for a penny, in for a pound&quot;). 
The humor comes from the fact that while the expression is completely grammatical in English, it makes no sense to a native English speaker. Hence it is necessary to understand both languages to appreciate the humor.

This phenomenon was first noted in the book &quot;From Lost to the River&quot; in 1995. The book describes six types of &quot;fromlostiano&quot;:
# Translations of Spanish idioms into English: &quot;With you bread and onion&quot; (&quot;Contigo pan y cebolla&quot;), &quot;Nobody gave you a candle in this burial&quot; (&quot;Nadie te ha dado vela en este entierro&quot;), &quot;To good hours, green sleeves&quot; (&quot;A buenas horas mangas verdes&quot;).
# Translations of American and British celebrities&#x27; names into Spanish: &quot;Vanesa Tumbarroja&quot; (&quot;Vanessa Redgrave&quot;).
# Translations of American and British street names into Spanish: &quot;Calle del Panadero&quot; (&quot;Baker Street&quot;).
# Translations of Spanish street names into English: &quot;Shell Thorn Street&quot; (&quot;Calle de Concha Espina&quot;).
# Translations of multinational corporations&#x27; names into Spanish: &quot;Ordenadores Manzana&quot; (&quot;Apple Computers&quot;).
# Translations of Spanish minced oaths into English: &quot;Tu-tut that I saw you&quot; (&quot;Tararí que te vi&quot;).
The use of Spanglish has evolved over time. It has emerged as a way of conceptualizing one&#x27;s thoughts whether it be in speech or on paper.

==Identity==

The use of Spanglish is often associated with the speaker&#x27;s expression of identity (in terms of language learning) and reflects how many minority-American cultures feel toward their heritage. Commonly in ethnic communities within the United States, the knowledge of one&#x27;s heritage language tends to assumably signify if one is truly of a member of their culture. Individuals of Hispanic descent living in America face living in two very different worlds. Spanglish is used to facilitate communication with others in both worlds. The dialect continues to evolve, influenced by the way new generations are educated, culture change, and the production of media. Living within the United States creates a synergy of culture and struggles for many Mexican-Americans. The hope to retain their cultural heritage/language and their dual-identity in American society is one of the major factors that lead to the creation of Spanglish.

== Intergenerational Spanglish ==

Immigrant youth in the United States have become prevalent social actors to sociologists because of their role as moderators and translators in their homes and the community. Orellana centers the ethnographic study around youth who have worked as translators in different spheres of societal issues for their communities. It showcases the division of labor passed onto members of the immigrant population and the navigational skills obtained by those obliged to utilize their bilingualism and Spanglish as a means of survival. Intergenerational skills like Spanglish can then be used as a ‘Fund of Knowledge’ to promote literacy in the classroom. ‘Funds of Knowledge’ encourages the use of Spanglish and other languages between familial relations in the classroom to bridge the skills used at home and welcome them to a classroom. This allows the development of Spanglish skills passed between generations to be viewed as equally valuable at home and in academia. It dismantles the idea that specific languages need to be segregated from the educational realm of society.

==Arts and culture==

=== Literature ===
Books that feature Spanglish in a significant way include the following:
* Giannina Braschi&#x27;s &quot;Yo-Yo Boing!&quot; (1998) is the first Spanglish novel.
*Guillermo Gómez-Peña uses Spanglish in his performances.
*Matt de la Peña&#x27;s novel &quot;Mexican WhiteBoy&quot; (2008) features flourishes of Spanglish.
*Junot Díaz&#x27;s &quot;The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao&quot; also uses Spanglish words and phrases.
* Pedro Pietri wrote the poem &quot;El Spanglish National Anthem.&quot; (1993)
*Ilan Stavans &quot;Spanglish: The Making of a New American Language.&quot; (2004)
*Piri Thomas wrote the autobiography &quot;Down These Mean Streets&quot; (1967) using Spanglish phrases.
*Yoss&#x27; science fiction novel &quot;Super Extra Grande&quot; (2009) is set in a future where Latin Americans have colonized the galaxy and Spanglish is the lingua franca among the galaxy&#x27;s sentient species.
*H. G. Wells&#x27;s future history &quot;The Shape of Things to Come&quot; (1933) predicted that in the 21st century English and Spanish would &quot;become interchangeable languages&quot;.
*Germán Valdés, a Mexican comedian, (known as Tin Tan) made heavy use of Spanglish. He dressed as a pachuco.

=== Music ===

==== Overview ====
The use of Spanglish by incorporating English and Spanish lyrics into music has risen in the United States over time. In the 1980s 1.2% of songs in the Billboard Top 100 contained Spanglish lyrics, eventually growing to 6.2% in the 2000s. The lyrical emergence of Spanglish by way of Latin American musicians has grown tremendously, reflective of the growing Hispanic population within the United States.
* Mexican rock band Molotov, whose members use Spanglish in their lyrics.
* American progressive rock band The Mars Volta, whose song lyrics frequently switch back and forth between English and Spanish.
* Ska punk pioneers Sublime, whose singer Bradley Nowell grew up in a Spanish-speaking community, released several songs in Spanglish.
* American nu metal band Ill Niño frequently mix Spanish and English lyrics in their songs.
* Shakira (born Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll), a Colombian singer-songwriter, musician and model.
* American singer, actress, producer, director, dancer, model, and businesswoman Jennifer Lopez.
* Sean Paul (born Sean Paul Ryan Francis Henriques), a Jamaican singer and songwriter.
* Ricky Martin (born Enrique Martín Morales), a Puerto Rican pop musician, actor and author.
* Pitbull (born Armando Christian Pérez), a successful Cuban-American rapper, producer and Latin Grammy Award-winning artist from Miami, Florida that has brought Spanglish into mainstream music through his multiple hit songs.
* Enrique Iglesias, a Spanish singer-songwriter with songs in English, Spanish and Spanglish; Spanglish songs include Bailamos and Bailando.
* Rapper Silentó, famous for his song &quot;Watch Me (Whip/Nae Nae)&quot;, recorded a version in Spanglish.
* Likewise, Mexican pop rock band Reik released a song called &quot;Spanglish&quot; in their album Secuencia.

==== History ====
The rise of Spanglish in music within the United States also creates new classifications of Latin(o) music, as well as the wider Latin(o) music genre. In some growing music scenes, it is noted that for artists go beyond music and bring in political inclinations as a way to make wider commentary. Although Los Angeles Chicano bands from the 1960s and 1970s are often remembered as part of the Chicano-movement as agents for social chance, Latin(o) music has long been a way for artists to exercise political agency, including the post-World War II jazz scene, the New York City salsa of the 1970s, and the hip-hop movement of the 80s. Some of the topics addressed in these movements include: redlining and housing policies; immigration; discrimination; and transnationalism.

==== Commercialization ====
Over time, however, this more explicit show of political nature might have been lessened due to the desire to compete in the music business of the English speaking world. This however, did not stop the a change in U.S. music, where English-speaking musicians have moved towards collaborative music, and bilingual duets are growing in popularity, indicating an audience demand for multi-language entertainment, as well as a space for traditional Latino artists to enter the mainstream and find chart success beyond the Spanish-speaking world. This is despite the slower-growing opportunities for Latino musicians to occupy higher-up positions such as promoters, business owners, and producers.

==== Present-day ====
With this growing demand for Spanglish duets, there has also been a rise in indie Latino artists who incorporate Spanglish lyrics in their music. One such artist is Omar Apollo, who combines Spanglish lyrics with music influenced by traditional corridos. Other up and coming Latino artists, such as Kali Uchis, Empress Of, and Ambar Lucid, have also led to a greater prominence of Hispanic performers and lyricism in the contemporary top charts. These types of artists, also being second-generation Spanish speakers, suggest that there is less fear or feelings of intimidation of using Spanish in public spaces. Moreover, this lack of negative connotation with public use of Spanglish and heritage-language language tools point to a subconscious desire to challenge negative rhetoric, as well as the racism that may go along with it. Given the fact that Spanglish has been the language of communication for a growing Hispanic-American population in the United States, its growing presence in Latino music is considered, by some scholars, a persistent and easily identifiable marker of an increasingly intersectional Latino identity.

<doc id="177475" wikidata="Q11762795" url="?curid=177475" title="Lou Duva">
<text>Louis Duva (May 28, 1922 – March 8, 2017) was a boxing trainer, manager and boxing promoter who handled nineteen world champions. The Duva family promoted boxing events in over twenty countries on six continents. Duva was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame, the New Jersey Boxing Hall of Fame, the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame, and The Meadowlands Sports Hall of Fame.

==Early years==
Duva was born in New York City to Italian immigrants, the sixth of seven children. After spending time growing up in Little Italy, New York, his family then moved to Saint James Place in Totowa, a suburb of Paterson, New Jersey. Duva&#x27;s childhood was an impoverished one and he had to do many jobs to try to help his family.

Duva&#x27;s 23-year-old brother, Carl Duva, introduced him to boxing when he was 10 years old, and by age 12 he was both an amateur and barroom brawler. However as a boxer he did not have much luck, although that might have been due to the fact he barely had time to train, having to go out to the street and perform many types of jobs to try to help his family make ends meet.

In 1938 Duva tried to join the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). Applicants were required to be at least 18, but he was only 16, so he changed his birth certificate and all his personal information and they accepted him, believing that he had been born in 1920. The CCC sent him to Boise, Idaho, and then to Walla Walla, Washington, where he learned to drive trucks.

Duva went to the U.S. Army after World War II broke out. He went to Jackson, Mississippi, to train, but was dismissed from the base after many fistfights with fellow soldiers. After that, he was sent to Camp Hood in Texas, where he was given a job as a boxing instructor.

He went back home in 1944 to help run a restaurant and to begin a career as a professional boxer, compiling a record of 6 wins, 10 losses and one draw. After retiring, he started a trucking company. Soon after, he met his wife Enes while he was performing as a clown at a ministry. They married in 1949.

Duva spent a good portion of the early 1950s at Stillman&#x27;s Boxing Gym, which attracted a large number of celebrities from Hollywood and the boxing world. It was here Lou began friendships with Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., Frankie Valli, and other celebrities.

Duva&#x27;s trucking business was doing well, so he opened his own gym, named &quot;Garden Gym&quot;. After he sold his fleet of 32 trucks, he became a bail bondsman. Around this time he also worked as a union representative in North Jersey.

== Rise to fame ==
By 1963, Duva had become close friends with former world heavyweight champion Rocky Marciano, one of the people who rejoiced when Duva crowned his first world boxing champion, middleweight Joey Giardello, who dethroned Dick Tiger that year to become world middleweight champion. Duva was one of the last persons that Marciano spoke to before Marciano&#x27;s plane crashed in 1969.

Lou&#x27;s son, Dan Duva, was a lawyer who was also involved in boxing. When Leon Spinks&#x27; management came for help in 1978, Dan gladly helped them. With his earning of $500,000, Dan formed &quot;Main Events&quot; in April 1978. The company still exists today, and is managed by Dan&#x27;s widow Kathy Duva.

Also during that period, Main Events put on boxing cards at the Ice World facility in Totowa, New Jersey. The Duvas used tactics resembling those used by the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) when promoting a card, once even going as far as selling a truck driver from New Jersey as a Prince from Zaire just to hype the show and sell tickets.

In 1979, ESPN began showing Main Events shows from Ice World. Rocky Lockridge, Bobby Czyz and Livingstone Bramble all signed up with &quot;Main Events&quot;. Duva suffered his first heart attack during that year. Doctors told him he needed to step off some of his activities, so he dropped any activities which weren&#x27;t related to boxing. He became a full-time boxing manager and trainer.

Dan formed a friendship with Shelly Finkel, a powerful boxing power broker who convinced middleweight contender Alex Ramos, future world light welterweight champion Johnny Bumphus, future world heavyweight champion Tony Tucker, the late light middleweight prospect Tony Ayala Jr. and heavyweight prospect Mitch Green to join &quot;Main Events&quot;. Duva was trainer and manager.

In 1981, &quot;Main Events&quot; became the promoter of the first bout between Sugar Ray Leonard and Thomas Hearns, won by Leonard by a knockout in round 14. It was the largest grossing non-heavyweight bout until then, making $40 million. Duva’s wife Enes was diagnosed with Multiple sclerosis.

1984 was a highly successful year for Duva and &quot;Main Events&quot;. He had Bumphus, Lockridge, Bramble and Mike McCallum crowned as world champions, and he signed future world champions Mark Breland, Evander Holyfield, Pernell Whitaker and Meldrick Taylor right after their participation in the Olympics in Los Angeles. He also signed Olympian Tyrell Biggs.

In 1985 he was named &quot;manager of the year&quot; by the American Boxing Writer&#x27;s Association. Holyfield was the next to be crowned world champion, when he beat Dwight Muhammad Qawi in 1986. That was the year that his wife Enes died after fighting her disease for five years.

Breland and Vinny Pazienza followed the championship route for &quot;Main Events&quot;, winning their first world titles in 1987, year in which he was named &quot;Trainer of The Year&quot; by the WBA. Taylor followed Whitaker and Pazienza by beating Buddy McGirt in 1988 for the world light welterweight title.

In 1989 Whitaker, Darrin Van Horn and Puerto Rico&#x27;s John John Molina crowned themselves champions, adding to the &quot;Main Events&quot; line of world champion boxers.

Holyfield gave &quot;Main Events&quot; another championship, when he knocked out Buster Douglas in three rounds to win the world heavyweight title with Duva as his co trainer along with George Benton.

After that, Duva attained mainstream fame, appearing in cameos at different television series and even visiting the &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; show as a guest. He also acted as wrestler Rowdy Roddy Piper&#x27;s trainer at the World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s WrestleMania 2 pay-per-view in 1986; coincidentally, Duva was a distant cousin to WWF manager &quot;Captain&quot; Lou Albano, who had instigated the story line involving Piper. In 1992, Eddie Hopson became Duva&#x27;s 13th world champion.

In 1996, Dan died of cancer. His widow, Kathy, became chairman of the Board and Dan&#x27;s brother, Dino Duva, became president. After four years Dino left the company and Kathy became the chief executive officer. Dino went on to form Duva Boxing.

Duva has worked with such other former or future world champions as Michael Moorer and Arturo Gatti among others. On the night of the infamous riot after the first Andrew Golota-Riddick Bowe bout, Duva was lifted out of the ring on a stretcher after his defibrillator went off. He was found out to be ok after testing was done to his heart later that night.

For a period during the 1980s Duva was involved in a restaurant named &quot;Lou Duva&#x27;s Seafood Grille and Sports Club&quot; in Totowa, New Jersey.

Duva was inducted into the International Boxing Hall Of Fame in 1998 and lived in Wayne, New Jersey, just a few miles from where his family once lived in Paterson, New Jersey. Duva remained active as an advisor and manager for a few select fighters and was also involved in his son Dino&#x27;s company, Duva Boxing. He was an outspoken advocate of fighter&#x27;s rights and of helping inner city kids get &quot;off the streets and into the ring&quot;.

Duva died of natural causes on March 8, 2017, after a period of declining health.

<doc id="177476" wikidata="Q1421439" url="?curid=177476" title="Bust a Groove">
<text>Bust a Groove is a 1998 rhythm video game developed by Metro and published by Enix for the PlayStation. It was released by 989 Studios in North America and Sony Computer Entertainment in Europe.

One of the first rhythm games to follow in the wake of &quot;PaRappa the Rapper&quot;″s unexpected popularity, the game combined &quot;PaRappa the Rapper&quot;-inspired rhythm-based gameplay with elements of fighting games, including special moves designed to damage the opponent and head-to-head competitive play. The Japanese version is titled , but in all other regions it was released as &quot;Bust a Groove&quot;, to avoid a trademark conflict with the Japanese puzzle game &quot;Puzzle Bobble&quot;, which was released in North America and Europe as &quot;Bust-A-Move&quot;.

The sequel, &quot;Bust a Groove 2&quot;, unlike its predecessor, was never planned to be released in Europe, and &quot;Dance Summit 2001&quot;, the third game in the series, was released only in Japan on the PlayStation 2.

==Gameplay==
The game play revolves around the beat of the music playing, displaying arrows that correspond to directions on the D-Pad, as well as the symbols for the circle and X button. By every fourth beat of the song, the player must match the commands on the screen, causing their character to complete a dance move, or else it is considered a miss. When the player performs a combo of eight dance moves, advanced paths with more complex moves allows the player to earn more points.

The player also uses a &quot;Jammer&quot; as an attack to interrupt rivals, which can also be dodged by a somersault move. This was used by pressing the square button by causing the player to do the back flip, and avoid the &quot;Jammer&quot;.

==Characters==

===Main===
===Hidden===
==Music==

† In addition to the song, there was an instrumental version—in which titled &quot;blue knife (start G move mix)&quot; from the soundtrack—was used for the opening cutscene for the game. There is also a different version, calling it &quot;blue knife dream (orchestra stall mix)&quot;, it was used for the staff credits.

==Release==
In Japan a premium version was released containing a &quot;premium disc&quot; with four movies. Accomplishing certain tasks in the game unlocks certain movies. One of the movies features Hatsumi Morinaga, the artist responsible for singing the theme of Kitty-N&#x27;s stage. This feature contains shots of the artist singing the song in the studio, an interview with the artist, and a live-action version of the game, with costumed Japanese dancers taking the parts of the various characters. The other three movies contained within the disc were all for other Enix games: &quot;Astronōka&quot;, &quot;Star Ocean: The Second Story&quot;, and &quot;Hello Charlie&quot; (released as &quot;Eggs of Steel&quot; in the U.S.). The premium version is otherwise identical to the game-only version.

The following changes were made in the English localization of the game:

* Hiro&#x27;s cigarette smoking was removed.
* Hamm&#x27;s general appearance was changed from a ganguro into a Caucasian.
* In Hamm&#x27;s song, &quot;McDonald&#x27;s, Burger King, or any other place&quot; was replaced with &quot;Hamburger lovers, let me hear you say ho&quot;.
* A line in Strike&#x27;s song referring to alcohol was removed, leaving an instrumental break following the line &quot;Like Arnold Schwarzenegger, I&#x27;m the only true Eraser&quot;.
* During gameplay, Strike drinks from a hip flask in the Japanese version. This was changed to a can of soda pop.
* The songs &quot;Transform, &quot;Waratte Pon&quot;, &quot;Aozora no KNIFE&quot; and &quot;Uwasa no KAPOEIRA&quot; were and re-recorded to English for the American and European market. Transform kept its title, and the other three were retitled as &quot;SHORTY and the EZ MOUSE&quot;, &quot;Bust a Groove&quot; and &quot;CAPOEIRA&quot;.

==Other versions==

=== Arcade ===
An arcade edition of &quot;Bust a Groove&quot;, although released only in Japan, held the title of &quot;Bust a Groove&quot;. The controls are the same as the PlayStation version but the controller is significantly different. The player now has to press the giant Left, Up and Right buttons in a giant pad and step on a footpedal for the &#x27;Down&#x27; command while the action buttons (Square, X etc.), are replaced by a giant &quot;Dance!&quot; button. The buttons also have to be pressed in a rhythmic manner or still be counted as a &quot;miss&quot;. A Jammer button is also included.

The arcade version features only five stages (Robo-Zs stage always being the last one).

=== Mobile ===
&quot;Bust a Move: Mobile Edition&quot; is a mobile version that was released in Japan only on April 19, 2004. It requires the software &quot;Square Enix Pocket Action&quot; and a compatible phone such as DoCoMo models P505i/is, SO505i/is, and 900 series. People could use the network to connect to the software and play against each other. The software shut down in the late 2000s.

==Reception==
===PlayStation===
&quot;Hyper&quot; magazine reviewed the PlayStation game and gave it a 91% score. &quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the Japanese release as an import, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that &quot;&quot;Bust-A-Move&quot; is definitely an idea whose time has come, and it helps bridge the gap between hardcore gaming and mass culture appeal. It doesn&#x27;t hurt that it&#x27;s also a serious blast to play.&quot; &quot;Next Generation&quot; also reviewed the U.S. PlayStation version, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that &quot;Overwhelmingly infectious tunes that have been translated to English for the U.S., hordes of secret dancers, and stages, charming touches such as secondary animations in stages for players who execute tough movies, and a clever, though not entirely unique, concept make &quot;Bust-A-Groove&quot; a game that deserves to find an audience in the U.S.&quot;

===Arcade===
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Bust a Groove&quot; on their April 1, 1999 issue as being the third most-successful dedicated arcade game of the month.

<doc id="177483" wikidata="Q256922" url="?curid=177483" title="Aestheticism">
<text>Aestheticism (also known as the aesthetic movement) was an art movement in the late 19th century that valued the appearance of literature, music, fonts and the arts over their functions. According to Aestheticism, art should be produced to be beautiful, rather than to teach a lesson, create a parallel, or perform another didactic purpose, a sentiment best illustrated by the slogan &quot;art for art&#x27;s sake.&quot; Aestheticism flourished in the 1870s and 1880s, gaining prominence and the support of notable writers such as Walter Pater and Oscar Wilde.

Aestheticism challenged the values of mainstream Victorian culture, as many Victorians believed that literature and art fulfilled important ethical roles. Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Fiona McCarthy states that &quot;the aesthetic movement stood in stark and sometimes shocking contrast to the crass materialism of Britain in the 19th century.&quot;

Aestheticism was named by the critic Walter Hamilton in &quot;The Aesthetic Movement in England&quot; in 1882. By the 1890s, decadence, a term with origins in common with aestheticism, was in use across Europe.

== Origin ==
Aestheticism has its roots in German Romanticism. Though the term &quot;aesthetic&quot; derives from Greek, Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten&#x27;s &quot;Aesthetica&quot; (1750) made important use of it in German before Immanuel Kant incorporated it into his philosophy in the &quot;Critique of Judgment&quot; (1790). Kant, in turn, influenced Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s &quot;Aesthetic Letters&quot; (1794) and his concept of art as &quot;Spiel&quot; (Play): &quot;Man is never so serious as when he plays; man is wholly man only when he plays&quot;. In the &quot;Letters&quot;, Schiller proclaimed salvation through art:Man has lost his dignity, but Art has saved it, and preserved it for him in expressive marbles. Truth still lives in fiction, and from the copy the original will be restored.These ideas were imported to the English-speaking world largely through the efforts of Thomas Carlyle, whose &quot;Life of Friedrich Schiller&quot; (1825), &quot;Critical and Miscellaneous Essays&quot; and &quot;Sartor Resartus&quot; (1833–1834) introduced and advocated aestheticism while also, if not marking the earliest use of the word &quot;aesthetic&quot; in the English language, certainly popularising it. Ruth apRoberts declared him the &quot;apostle of aesthetics in England, 1825–1827&quot;, in recognition of his pioneering influence on the subsequent development of the aesthetic movement.

==Aesthetic literature==
The British decadent writers were much influenced by the Oxford professor Walter Pater and his essays published during 1867–1868, in which he stated that one had to live life intensely, and seek beauty. His text &quot;Studies in the History of the Renaissance&quot; (1873) was very popular among art-oriented young men of the late 19th century. Writers of the Decadent movement used the slogan &quot;Art for Art&#x27;s Sake&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;art pour l&#x27;art&quot;), the origin of which is debated. Some claim that it was created by the philosopher Victor Cousin, although Angela Leighton notes that it was used by Benjamin Constant as early as 1804 in the work &quot;On Form: Poetry, Aestheticism and the Legacy of a Word&quot; (2007). It is generally accepted to have been popularised by Théophile Gautier in France, who used the phrase to suggest that art and morality were separate.
The artists and writers of Aesthetic style tended to profess that the Arts should provide refined sensuous pleasure, rather than convey moral or sentimental messages. As a consequence, they did not accept John Ruskin, Matthew Arnold, and George MacDonald&#x27;s conception of art as something moral or useful, &quot;Art for truth&#x27;s sake&quot;. Instead, they believed that Art did not have any didactic purpose; it only needed to be beautiful. The Aesthetes developed a cult of beauty, which they considered the basic factor of art. Life should copy Art, they asserted. They considered nature as crude and lacking in design when compared to art. The main characteristics of the style were: suggestion rather than statement, sensuality, great use of symbols, and synaesthetic/Ideasthetic effects—that is, correspondence between words, colours and music. Music was used to establish mood.

Predecessors of the Aesthetes included John Keats and Percy Bysshe Shelley, and some of the Pre-Raphaelites who themselves were a legacy of the Romantic spirit. There are a few significant continuities between the Pre-Raphaelite philosophy and that of the Aesthetes: Dedication to the idea of &#x27;Art for Art&#x27;s Sake&#x27;; admiration of, and constant striving for, beauty; escapism through visual and literary arts; craftsmanship that is both careful and self-conscious; mutual interest in merging the arts of various media. This final idea is promoted in the poem &quot;L&#x27;Art&quot; by Théophile Gautier, who compared the poet to the sculptor and painter. Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Edward Burne-Jones are most strongly associated with Aestheticism. However, their approach to Aestheticism did not share the creed of &#x27;Art for Art&#x27;s Sake&#x27; but rather &quot;a spirited reassertion of those principles of colour, beauty, love, and cleanness that the drab, agitated, discouraging world of the mid-nineteenth century needed so much.&quot; This reassertion of beauty in a drab world also connects to Pre-Raphaelite escapism in art and poetry.

In Britain the best representatives were Oscar Wilde, Algernon Charles Swinburne (both influenced by the French Symbolists), James McNeill Whistler and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. These writers and their style were satirised by Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s comic opera &quot;Patience&quot; and other works, such as F. C. Burnand&#x27;s drama &quot;The Colonel&quot;, and in comic magazines such as &quot;Punch,&quot; particularly in works by George Du Maurier.

Compton Mackenzie&#x27;s novel &quot;Sinister Street&quot; makes use of the type as a phase through which the protagonist passes as he is influenced by older, decadent individuals. The novels of Evelyn Waugh, who was a young participant of aesthete society at Oxford University, describe the aesthetes mostly satirically, but also as a former participant. Some names associated with this assemblage are Robert Byron, Evelyn Waugh, Harold Acton, Nancy Mitford, A.E. Housman and Anthony Powell.

==Aesthetic fine art==
Artists associated with the Aesthetic style include Simeon Solomon, James McNeill Whistler, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Albert Joseph Moore, GF Watts and Aubrey Beardsley. Although the work of Edward Burne-Jones was exhibited at the Grosvenor Gallery which promoted the movement, it is narrative and conveys moral or sentimental messages hence falling outside the movement&#x27;s purported programme.

Artists such as Rossetti focused more on simply painting beautiful women than aiming for a moral message, as is apparent in the famous “Lady Lilith” and “Mona Vanna.” John Ruskin, a former friend of Rossetti&#x27;s, said that Rossetti was “lost in the Inferno of London.” Rossetti painted many more aestheticism paintings in his life, including “Venus Verticordia” and “Proserpine.”

==Aesthetic decorative arts==

According to Christopher Dresser, the primary element of decorative art is utility. The maxim &quot;art for art&#x27;s sake,&quot; identifying art or beauty as the primary element in other branches of the Aesthetic Movement, especially fine art, cannot apply in this context. That is, decorative art must first have utility, but may also be beautiful. However, according to Michael Shindler, the decorative art branch of the Aesthetic Movement, was less the utilitarian cousin of Aestheticism&#x27;s main &#x27;pure&#x27; branch, and more the very means by which aesthetes exercised their fundamental design strategy. Like contemporary art, Shindler writes that aestheticism was born of &quot;the conundrum of constituting one’s life in relation to an exterior work&quot; and that it &quot;attempted to overcome&quot; this problem &quot;by subsuming artists within their work in the hope of yielding—more than mere objects—lives which could be living artworks.&quot; Thus, &quot;beautiful things became the sensuous set pieces of a drama in which artists were not like their forebears a sort of crew of anonymous stagehands, but stars. Consequently, aesthetes made idols of portraits, prayers of poems, altars of writing desks, chapels of dining rooms, and fallen angels of their fellow men.&quot;

Government Schools of Design were founded from 1837 onwards in order to improve the design of British goods. Following the Great Exhibition of 1851 efforts were intensified and oriental objects were purchased for the schools teaching collections. Owen Jones, architect and orientalist, was requested to set out key principles of design and these became not only the basis of the schools teaching but also the propositions that preface &quot;The Grammar of Ornament&quot; (1856), which is still regarded as the finest systematic study or practical sourcebook of historic world ornament.

Jones identified the need for a new and modern style that would meet the requirements of the modern world, rather than the continual re-cycling of historic styles, but saw no reason to reject the lessons of the past. Christopher Dresser, a student and later Professor at the school worked with Owen Jones on &quot;The Grammar of Ornament&quot;, as well as on the 1863 decoration of the oriental courts (Chinese, Japanese, and Indian) at the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum), advanced the search for a new style with his two publications &quot;The Art of Decorative Design&quot; 1862, and &quot;Principles of Design&quot; 1873.

Production of Aesthetic style furniture was limited to approximately the late 19th century. Aesthetic style furniture is characterized by several common themes:
* Ebonized wood with gilt highlights.
* Far Eastern influence.
* Prominent use of nature, especially flowers, birds, ginkgo leaves, and peacock feathers.
* Blue and white on porcelain and other fine china.

Ebonized furniture means that the wood is painted or stained to a black ebony finish. The furniture is sometimes completely ebony-colored. More often however, there is gilding added to the carved surfaces of the feathers or stylized flowers that adorn the furniture.

As aesthetic movement decor was similar to the corresponding writing style in that it was about sensuality and nature, nature themes often appear on the furniture. A typical aesthetic feature is the gilded carved flower, or the stylized peacock feather. Colored paintings of birds or flowers are often seen. Non-ebonized aesthetic movement furniture may have realistic-looking three-dimensional-like renditions of birds or flowers carved into the wood.
Contrasting with the ebonized-gilt furniture is use of blue and white for porcelain and china. Similar themes of peacock feathers and nature would be used in blue and white tones on dinnerware and other crockery. The blue and white design was also popular on square porcelain tiles. It is reported that Oscar Wilde used aesthetic decorations during his youth. This aspect of the movement was also satirised by &quot;Punch&quot; magazine and in &quot;Patience&quot;.

In 1882 Oscar Wilde visited Canada, where he toured the town of Woodstock, Ontario and gave a lecture on 29 May titled &quot;The House Beautiful&quot;. In this lecture Wilde exposited the principles of the Aesthetic Movement in decorative and applied design, also known at the time as the &quot;Ornamental Aesthetic&quot; style, according to which local flora and fauna were celebrated as beautiful and textured, layered ceilings were popular. An example of this can be seen in Annandale National Historic Site, located in Tillsonburg, Ontario, Canada. The house was built in 1880 and decorated by Mary Ann Tillson, who happened to attend Oscar Wilde&#x27;s lecture in Woodstock. Since the Aesthetic Movement was only prevalent in the decorative arts from about 1880 until about 1890, there are not many surviving examples of this particular style but one such example is 18 Stafford Terrace, London, England, which provides an insight into how the middle classes interpreted its principles. Olana, the home of Frederic Edwin Church in upstate New York, is an important example of exoticism in the Aesthetic Movement decorative arts.

==Influence on advertising==
The aesthetic movement in England became directly involved in advertising, and Pears soap (under advertising pioneer Thomas J. Barratt) recruited English actress and socialite Lillie Langtry—who had been painted by aesthete artists and was also a friend of Oscar Wilde—to promote their products in 1882, making her the first celebrity to endorse a commercial product.

<text>Crime statistics refer to systematic, quantitative results about crime, as opposed to crime news or anecdotes. Notably, crime statistics can be the result of two rather different processes:
* scientific research, such as criminological studies, victimisation surveys;
* official figures, such as published by the police, prosecution, courts, and prisons.
However, in their research, criminologists often draw on official figures as well.

== Methods ==
There are several methods for the measuring of crime. Public surveys are occasionally conducted to estimate the amount of crime that has not been reported to police. Such surveys are usually more reliable for assessing trends. However, they also have their limitations and generally don&#x27;t procure statistics useful for local crime prevention, often ignore offenses against children and do not count offenders brought before the criminal justice system.

Law enforcement agencies in some countries offer compilations of statistics for various types of crime.

Two major methods for collecting crime data are law enforcement reports, which only reflect crimes that are reported, recorded, and not subsequently canceled; and victim study (victimization statistical surveys), which rely on individual memory and honesty. For less frequent crimes such as intentional homicide and armed robbery, reported incidents are generally more reliable, but suffer from under-recording; for example, no criming in the United Kingdom sees over one third of reported violent crimes being not recorded by the police. Because laws and practices vary between jurisdictions, comparing crime statistics between and even within countries can be difficult: typically only violent deaths (homicide or manslaughter) can reliably be compared, due to consistent and high reporting and relative clear definition.

The U.S. has two major data collection programs, the Uniform Crime Reports from the FBI and the National Crime Victimization Survey from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. However, the U.S. has no comprehensive infrastructure to monitor crime trends and report the information to related parties such as law enforcement.

Research using a series of victim surveys in 18 countries of the European Union, funded by the European Commission, has reported (2005) that the level of crime in Europe has fallen back to the levels of 1990, and notes that levels of common crime have shown declining trends in the U.S., Canada, Australia and other industrialized countries as well. The European researchers say a general consensus identifies demographic change as the leading cause for this international trend. Although homicide and robbery rates rose in the U.S. in the 1980s, by the end of the century they had declined by 40%.

However, the European research suggests that &quot;increased use of crime prevention measures may indeed be the common factor behind the near universal decrease in overall levels of crime in the Western world&quot;, since decreases have been most pronounced in property crime and less so, if at all, in contact crimes.

==Counting rules==
Relatively few standards exist and none that permit international comparability beyond a very limited range of offences. However, many jurisdictions accept the following:
* There must be a &quot;prima facie&quot; case that an offence has been committed before it is recorded. That is either police find evidence of an offence or receive a believable allegation of an offense being committed. Some jurisdictions count offending only when certain processes happen, such as an arrest is made, ticket issued, charges laid in Court or only upon securing a conviction.
* Multiple reports of the same offence usually count as one offence. Some jurisdictions count each report separately, others count each victim of offending separately.
* Where several offences are committed at the same time, in one act of offending, only the most serious offense is counted. Some jurisdictions record and count each and every offense separately, others count cases, or offenders, that can be prosecuted.
* Where multiple offenders are involved in the same act of offending only one act is counted when counting offenses but each offender is counted when apprehended.
* Offending is counted at the time it comes to the attention of a law enforcement officer. Some jurisdictions record and count offending at the time it occurs.
* As &quot;only causing pain&quot; is counted as assault in some countries, it let higher assault rates except in Austria, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal and Sweden. But there are exceptions, like Czech Republic and Latvia. France was the contrasting exception having a high assault ratio without counting minor assaults.
Offending that is a breach of the law but for which no punishment exists is often not counted. For example: Suicide, which is technically illegal in most countries, may not be counted as a crime, although attempted suicide and assisting suicide are.

Also traffic offending and other minor offending that might be dealt with by using fines rather than imprisonment, is often not counted as &quot;crime&quot;. However separate statistics may be kept for this sort of offending.

==Surveys==
Because of the difficulties in quantifying how much crime actually occurs, researchers generally take two approaches to gathering statistics about crime.

However, as officers can only record crime that comes to their attention and might not record a matter as a crime if the matter is considered minor and is not perceived as a crime by the officer concerned.

For example, when faced with a domestic violence dispute between a couple, a law enforcement officer may decide it is far less trouble to arrest the male party to the dispute, because the female may have children to care for, despite both parties being equally culpable for the dispute. This sort of pragmatic decisionmaking asked if they are victims of crime, without needing to provide any supporting evidence. In these surveys it is the participant&#x27;s perception, or opinion, that a crime occurred, or even their understanding about what constitutes a crime that is being measured.

As a consequence differing methodologies may make comparisons with other surveys difficult.

One way in which, while other types of crime are under reported. These surveys also give insights as to why crime is reported, or not. The surveys show that the need to make an insurance claim, seek medical assistance, and the seriousness of an offence tend to increase the level of reporting, while the inconvenience of reporting, the involvement of intimate partners and the nature of the offending tend to decrease reporting.

This allows degrees of confidence to be assigned to various crime statistics. For example: Motor vehicle thefts are generally well reported because the victim may need to make the report for an insurance claim, while domestic violence, domestic child abuse and sexual offences are frequently significantly under-reported because of the intimate relationships involved, embarrassment and other factors that make it difficult for the victim to make a report.

Attempts to use victimisation surveys from different countries for international comparison had failed in the past. A standardised survey project called &quot;the International Crime Victims Survey&quot; Results from this project have been briefly discussed earlier in this article. In 2019, the Global Organized Crime Index found that DRC had the highest rate of criminality. 

Annual estimates of crimes committed in the United States range from eleven to thirty million as many acts go unreported.

An estimated hundred million Americans have a criminal record.

==Classification==
While most jurisdictions could probably agree about what constitutes a murder, what constitutes a homicide may be more problematic, while a crime against the person could vary widely. Legislation differences often means the ingredients of offences vary between jurisdictions.

The International Crime victims Survey has been done in over 70 countries to date and has been a &#x27;de facto&#x27; standard for defining common crimes. Complete list of countries participating and the 11 defined crimes can be found at the project web site.

In March 2015 the UNODC published the first version of the &quot;International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes&quot; (ICCS). According to the UNODC, there have been more than three million homicides in Africa since the year 2000.

==Measures==
More complex measures involve measuring the numbers of discrete victims and offenders as well as repeat victimisation rates and recidivism. Repeat victimisation involves measuring how often the same victim is subjected to a repeat occurrence of an offence, often by the same offender. Repetition rate measures are often used to assess the effectiveness of interventions.

<doc id="177496" wikidata="Q333336" url="?curid=177496" title="Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey">
<text>Albert Henry George Grey, 4th Earl Grey, (28 November 185129 August 1917) was a British peer and politician who served as Governor General of Canada from 1904 to 1911, the ninth since Canadian Confederation. He was a radical Liberal aristocrat and a member of a string of liberal high society clubs in London. An active and articulate campaigner in late Victorian England, he was associated with many of the leading Imperialists seeking change.

Albert Grey was born into a noble and political family, though at birth not in direct line to inherit the earldom. His father, General Charles Grey, was a younger brother of the 3rd Earl, who died without issue. As General Grey was deceased, the titles descended to his eldest living son Albert, then in his forties. Albert was educated at Harrow School before going up to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated MA and LLM. &quot;His grandfather was the 2nd Earl Grey, who was prime minister of the United Kingdom from 1830 to 1834 and, reputedly, the recipient of a diplomatic gift from China of black tea scented with bergamot oil, which became known as Earl Grey tea.&quot;

In 1878, Albert Grey entered into politics as a member of the Liberal Party and, after relinquishing a tied vote to his opponent, eventually won a place in the British House of Commons in 1880. In 1894 Grey inherited an earldom from his uncle, the third Earl, and thereafter took his place in the House of Lords, while simultaneously undertaking business ventures around the British Empire as Director of the British South Africa Company from 1898, he experienced a steep learning curve during high tension with the Boers. As administrator in Rhodesia he was directly responsible to Cecil Rhodes for conduct of the colony&#x27;s business from 1894 to 1897. On his return in 1899 he was appointed Lord Lieutenant of his native Northumberland.

Grey was appointed as Governor General of Canada by King Edward VII in 1904, on the recommendation of Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Arthur Balfour, to replace the Earl of Minto as viceroy and occupied that post until succeeded by Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, in 1911. Grey travelled extensively in Canada and was active in Canadian political affairs, including national unity, leaving behind him a number of legacies, the most prominent being the Grey Cup.

==Youth, education, and early career==
Grey was the younger and only surviving son of General Sir Charles Grey—a younger son of former British prime minister the second Earl Grey and later the private secretary to Prince Albert and later still to Queen Victoria—and his wife, Caroline Eliza Farquhar, eldest daughter of Sir Thomas Harvie Farquhar, Bt. He was born at Cadogan House, Middlesex. Many members of the family had enjoyed successful political careers based on reform, including to colonial policies; Grey&#x27;s grandfather, while prime minister, championed the Reform Act 1832 and in 1846, Grey&#x27;s uncle, the third Earl Grey, as Secretary of State for War and the Colonies during the first ministry of Lord John Russell, was the first to suggest that colonies should be self-sustaining and governed for the benefit of their inhabitants, instead of for the benefit of the United Kingdom.

Grey was educated at Harrow School and then Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied history and law. After graduating in 1873, Grey became private secretary to Sir Henry Bartle Frere and, as Frere was a member of the Council of India, Grey accompanied Prince Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, on his tour of India. In 1877, Grey married Alice Holford, daughter of Robert Stayner Holford, the Member of Parliament for East Gloucestershire. Together, they had five children, one of whom died in early childhood.

==Parliamentary and administrative career==
Grey stood for parliament at South Northumberland in 1878 (at the age of 28). He received the same number of votes as his opponent Edward Ridley, but Grey declined a scrutiny and was not returned. It was not until the general election of 1880 that Grey, the Liberal Party candidate, was elected as a member of parliament (MP) for South Northumberland, a seat he held until it was replaced under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 and he moved to be the MP for Tyneside, following that year&#x27;s election. In 1884 he wrote to the Manchester-based &quot;Women&#x27;s Suffrage Journal&quot; declaring his support for women&#x27;s suffrage, writing that &quot;[t]here are no questions which receive so little attention, or which, in my opinion, so urgently call for the close and serious consideration of social reformers, as those affecting the condition of women. The possession of a vote by women who are heads of households will lead to the formation of associations and unions for the protection and advancement of the interests of their sex.&quot;

Another reform he supported was electoral reform, favoring proportional representation and Single transferable voting. He was active in the Proportional Representation Society of Britain. (At the time of his passing, he was its president). He organized a model STV election in Northumberland in 1885, remarkably using untrained coal miners as staff to conduct it successfully.

Inspired by the theories of Giuseppe Mazzini, Grey became an advocate of imperialism and was one of the founders of the Imperial Federation League, which sought to transform the British Empire into an Imperial Federation. Grey thus split with Prime Minister William Gladstone in 1886 over Irish home rule and became a Liberal Unionist, but the shift was short-lived as Grey failed to win his constituency again in the 1886 general election.

Eight years later, in October 1894, Grey succeeded his uncle, the 3rd Earl Grey, as the 4th Earl Grey and returned to Parliament when taking his seat in the House of Lords. As a friend of Cecil Rhodes, Lord Grey became one of the first four trustees responsible for the administration of the scholarship funds which established the Rhodes Scholarship and he was invited by Rhodes to be a member of the board of directors and director of the British South Africa Company, coming to serve as the main liaison between Rhodes and the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Joseph Chamberlain, in the periods immediately before and after the Jameson Raid on the Transvaal. As the Administrator of Southern Rhodesia, Sir Leander Starr Jameson, was disgraced by the Jameson Raid, the British government, then headed by the Marquess of Salisbury, in 1896 asked Lord Grey to serve as Jameson&#x27;s immediate replacement, staying in that role until 1897. Two years later, Grey was also appointed as Lord Lieutenant of Northumberland and published a brief biography of a young relative, Hubert Hervey, who was killed in the Second Matabele War.

==Governor General of Canada==
===In office===
On 4 October 1904 announcement made that King Edward VII had, by commission under the royal sign-manual and signet, approved the recommendation of his British prime minister, Arthur Balfour, to appoint Grey as his representative to Canada, replacing Grey&#x27;s brother-in-law, the Earl of Minto. (Minto was married to Grey&#x27;s sister, Mary Caroline Grey.) The appointment came at a good time for Grey, as a series of failed investments in South Africa had left him penniless; a gift from his wife&#x27;s aunt, Lady Wantage (widow of the Lord Wantage), was used to supplement his salary as governor general.

On 16 June 1905 Grey was designated as &quot;Governor General of Canada and Commander-in-Chief of the Dominion of Canada,&quot; which followed on the passing of the Militia Act in 1904. At the request of Sir Robert Baden-Powell, Grey also undertook the role of Chief Scout of Canada. 

During the time Grey occupied the viceregal office (1904-1911) Canada experienced large-scale immigration, industrialisation, and economic development, and secured increased independence from the United Kingdom.

It was with Grey&#x27;s granting of Royal Assent to the appropriate Acts of Parliament that Alberta and Saskatchewan were separated from the North-West Territories to become provinces, The Governor General, writing to the King at the time, stated &quot;[each one] a new leaf in Your Majesty&#x27;s Maple Crown.&quot;

As Governor General, he travelled extensively around the ever-growing country. He journeyed abroad to the Dominion of Newfoundland (then not yet a part of Canada) and several times to the United States to visit President Theodore Roosevelt, with whom Grey developed a strong bond.
Grey often exercised his right, as representative of a constitutional monarch, to advise, encourage, and warn. He desired social reform and cohesion. He put his support behind prison reforms in Canada to provide greater social justice. He was also an advocate for electoral reform, endorsing proportional representation. His past calls for political equality for Irish Catholics were relevant to Canada&#x27;s internal politics, divided as the population was between Catholics and Protestants, Francophones and Anglophones.

As governor General, Grey also encouraged his prime minister, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, to support the Imperial Federation he had long championed, but Laurier was uninterested. Grey suggested the construction of a railway hotel in the federal capital - the outcome was the palatial Château Laurier, completed in 1912.
Grey&#x27;s years of urging Laurier to get the Cabinet and Parliament to agree to the idea of a Canadian navy were more fruitful. At the Governor General&#x27;s urging, the Canadian and British governments agreed to have Canada assume control of the former British garrisons at Halifax, Nova Scotia, and Esquimalt, British Columbia, after which the Royal Canadian Navy was created by the &quot;Naval Service Act&quot;. The Act was so identified with Grey that, in Quebec, it was referred to as &quot;Grey&#x27;s Bill&quot; and opposed by Henri Bourassa and his &quot;Ligue nationaliste canadienne&quot;. 

Although Grey strongly promoted national unity among French and English Canadians, as well as advocating unity within the entire British Empire, his pronouncements frequently raised the ire of Bourassa and the Quebec nationalists. Grey helped plan the tercentennial of Quebec in 1908. This event marked the 300th anniversary of the landing of Samuel de Champlain at what later became Quebec City. The Cabinet agreed to Grey&#x27;s suggestion to have the Plains of Abraham designated as a national park. this was to be done to coincide with the Quebec celebrations, and Grey believed the official ceremony would promote Franco-Anglo-American friendship. The government arranged for the attendance of the Prince of Wales (later King George V), American and French warships, and a host of visiting dignitaries. The Ligue saw the ceremony as solely a tribute to the Empire. Bourassa and other Quebec nationalists complained that Grey had transformed a day intended to celebrate Samuel de Champlain into a celebration of James Wolfe.

At other times, and unlike future viceroys, the Governor General&#x27;s influence expanded blatantly into government policy. Grey initially supported Asian immigration to Canada. He opposed the head tax imposed by the Chinese Immigration Act of 1885 on Chinese immigrants to Canada. He was invited to visit the province of British Columbia but declined as protest against the exclusionary measures implemented by the BC government under premier Richard McBride. However, following the Japanese victory in the Russo-Japanese War, he expressed concerned about the so-called Yellow Peril and worked with the federal Cabinet to explore restrictions on Asian immigration other than the head tax. He was nevertheless appalled by the 1907 anti-Asian riots in Vancouver, organized by BC&#x27;s Asiatic Exclusion League. Later that same year, he arranged a visit to Canada by Prince Fushimi Sadanaru of the Empire of Japan.

===Legacy===

Throughout his tenure as governor general, Grey supported the arts and, when he departed Canada in 1911, he left behind him the Grey Competition for Music and Drama, first held in 1907. Grey also donated trophies to the Montreal Horse Show and for figure skating. 

He was a patron of sport, his feelings on health and fitness a part of his broader desire for a reform movement. He supported Canadian football and established the Grey Cup, which is awarded to the winner of the Senior Amateur Football Championship of Canada; it is today presented to the champions of the professional-level Canadian Football League. In 1963 Grey was elected to the Canadian Football Hall of Fame for his contributions to the game. 

He gave to the Crown a horse-drawn carriage he had purchased from the Governor-General of Australia, which is still today used as the state landau, and added a study and conservatory to Rideau Hall, the sovereign&#x27;s and governor general&#x27;s Ottawa residence; the latter was torn down in 1924. 

Grey and his wife were commended for their work in Canada and for their championing social reforms. Laurier said Lord Grey gave &quot;his whole heart, his whole soul, and his whole life to Canada.&quot;

==Final years==
On leaving office in 1911 Earl Grey and his family returned to the United Kingdom, where he became president of the Royal Colonial Institute (now the Royal Commonwealth Society).

He did not retire from public affairs. He lobbied and organized toward several goals:

1. to help those who are endeavoring to fight the slums. 

2. to help the worker forward in the path of his natural evolution from the status of worker to that of partner.

3. proportional representation – by &quot;the removal of the disparity between Parliamentary constituencies with 40,000 electors, on the one hand, and on the other, other constituencies with less than as many hundreds.&quot; (through creation of equal-sized single-member districts. Earl Grey was also a proponent of PR in the sense of elected representation reflecting how votes are cast. In 1916, he was honorary president of the Proportional Representation Society of Canada and president of the British PR Society.

4. Public House Trust [temperance refreshment houses], which is &quot;a necessary adjunct to the first two items of his programme.&quot;

On 28 March 1916, he was appointed by King George V as Chancellor of the Order of St. Michael and St. George. 

Grey died in August 1917 at his family residence. (On his deathbed, he penned a &quot;stirring&quot; letter to the editor of the London Times on the need to retain the adoption of proportional representation in the Electoral Reform Bill, being debated by British Parliament at the time.)

== Family ==
Grey married Alice Holford (d. 22 September 1944), daughter of Robert Stayner Holford, of Westonbirt House (Gloucestershire) and Dorchester House (London) on 9 June 1877 and had five children, one of whom died in early childhood:
# Lady Victoria Mary Sybil Grey (9 June 1878 – 3 February 1907) married Lt-Col. Arthur Morton Grenfell, of Wilton Park in 1901, and had children.
# Charles Robert Grey, 5th Earl Grey (15 December 1879 – 2 April 1963), who had two daughters by his wife Lady Mabel Laura Georgiana Palmer, daughter of William Palmer, 2nd Earl of Selborne. The elder daughter Mary (1907–2002) married the 1st Baron Howick of Glendale.
# Lady Sybil Grey (15 July 1882 – 4 June 1966) O.B.E. married Lambert William Middleton (1877–1941) of Lowood House, Melrose, Scottish Borders, nephew of Sir Arthur Middleton, 7th Baronet and Frederick Edmund Meredith. She was invested as an Officer, Order of the British Empire in 1918, having served as the Commandant of the Dorchester House Hospital for Officers. She was well known for her work with the Red Cross in Russia during WWI, and for her work with tuberculosis sufferers (founding the Lady Grey Society). She was an amateur photographer and filmmaker of note, and recorded village life at Darnick and St. Boswells. After her husband died she sold Lowood House and moved to Burley, Hampshire. They had a son and a daughter.
# Lady Evelyn Alice Grey (14 Mar 1886–15 Apr 1971) married Sir Lawrence Evelyn Jones, 5th Bt. M.C., grandson of Sir Willoughby Jones.
# Lady Lillian Winifred Grey (11 June 1891 – 7 April 1895)

<text>Burial, also known as interment or inhumation, is a method of final disposition whereby a dead body is placed into the ground, sometimes with objects. This is usually accomplished by excavating a pit or trench, placing the deceased and objects in it, and covering it over. A funeral is a ceremony that accompanies the final disposition. Evidence suggests that some archaic and early modern humans buried their dead. Burial is often seen as indicating respect for the dead. It has been used to prevent the odor of decay, to give family members closure and prevent them from witnessing the decomposition of their loved ones, and in many cultures it has been seen as a necessary step for the deceased to enter the afterlife or to give back to the cycle of life.

Methods of burial may be heavily ritualized and can include natural burial (sometimes called &quot;green burial&quot;); embalming or mummification; and the use of containers for the dead, such as shrouds, coffins, grave liners, and burial vaults, all of which can slow decomposition of the body. Sometimes objects or grave goods are buried with the body, which may be dressed in fancy or ceremonial garb. Depending on the culture, the manner in which the body is positioned may have great significance.

The location of the burial may be determined by taking into account concerns surrounding health and sanitation, religious concerns, and cultural practices. Some cultures keep the dead close to provide guidance to the living, while others &quot;banish&quot; them by locating burial grounds at a distance from inhabited areas. Some religions consecrate special ground to bury the dead, and some families build private family cemeteries. Most modern cultures document the location of graves with headstones, which may be inscribed with information and tributes to the deceased. However, some people are buried in anonymous or secret graves for various reasons. Sometimes multiple bodies are buried in a single grave either by choice (as in the case of married couples), due to space concerns, or in the case of mass graves as a way to deal with many bodies at once.

Alternatives to burial include cremation (and subsequent interment), burial at sea and cryopreservation. Some human cultures may bury the remains of beloved animals. 
== History ==

Intentional burial, particularly with grave goods, may be one of the earliest detectable forms of religious practice since, as Philip Lieberman suggests, it may signify a &quot;concern for the dead that transcends daily life&quot;. Evidence points to the Neanderthals as the first human species known to practice burial behavior and to intentionally bury their dead; they did so using shallow graves furnished with stone tools and animal bones. Exemplary sites include Shanidar in Iraq, Kebara Cave in Israel and Krapina in Croatia. Some scholars, however, argue that such &quot;buried&quot; bodies may have been disposed of for secular reasons.

Though there is ongoing debate regarding the reliability of the dating method, some scholars believe the earliest human burial dates back 100,000 years. Archeological expeditions have discovered human skeletal remains stained with red ochre in the Skhul cave at Qafzeh in Israel. A variety of grave goods were present at the site, including the mandible of a wild boar in the arms of one of the skeletons. The remains of a 3-year-old child at Panga ya Saidi cave in Kenya dating to 78,000 years ago also show signs suggestive of a burial, such as the digging of a pit, laying of the body in a fetal position and intentional rapid covering of the corpse.

In ancient Egypt, burial customs developed during the Predynastic period. Round graves with one pot were used in the Badarian Period (4400–3800 B.C.E.), continuing the tradition of Omari and Maadi cultures.

Archeologists refer to unmarked prehistoric cemeteries using the neutral term &quot;grave field&quot;. Grave fields are one of the chief sources of information on prehistoric cultures, and numerous archaeological cultures are labelled and defined by their burial customs, such as the Urnfield culture of the European Bronze Age.

During the Early Middle Ages, the reopening of graves and manipulation of the corpses or artifacts contained within them was a widespread phenomenon and a common part of the life course of early medieval cemeteries across Western and Central Europe. The reopening of furnished or recent burials occurred especially from the 5th to the 8th centuries CE over the broad zone of European row-grave-style furnished inhumation burial, which comprised the regions of Romania, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Switzerland, Austria, Germany, the Low Countries, France, and South-eastern England.

Medieval European Christianity sometimes developed complex burial rituals and attached great importance to their correct performance: the fate of the soul of the deceased might depend on observing the proper ceremonial. For example:
If you were to make it to heaven [...] you had to be interred correctly, for burial was the passage out of this world. The body had to be shrouded in the expectation that it would be reborn into eternal life. Then, on the eve of burial, the corpse had to be taken to church on a torch-lit bier and placed in the darkness of the nave, then laid in front of the high altar, surrounded by candles. The next day, in front of the whole community, a requiem mass was to be sung and the paschal candle lit [...]. Following this, there were prayers, hymns, special masses, and the body was borne to the grave, sprinkled with holy water and buried in consecrated ground. It must be laid head up with its feet to the east, for it was from this direction that Christ would return, from New Jerusalem, at the Apocalypse, when the worthy dead would be resurrected. [...] If burial rituals went awry, one&#x27;s immortal soul was jeopardised. [...] Personal salvation – breaking free from the corporeal prison and ascending to a spiritual sphere unencumbered by materiality – is the logical culmination of the myth of humanity&#x27;s supposed dominion over nature.


==Reasons for human burial==
After death, a body will decay. Burial is not necessarily a public health requirement. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the World Health Organization advises that only corpses carrying an infectious disease strictly require burial.

Human burial practices are the manifestation of the human desire to demonstrate &quot;respect for the dead&quot;. Cultures vary in their mode of respect.

Some reasons follow:
* Respect for the physical remains. If left lying on top of the ground, scavengers may eat the corpse, considered disrespectful to the deceased in many (but not all) cultures. In Tibet, sky burials deliberately encourage scavenging of human remains in the interest of returning them to nature, just as within Zoroastrianism, where burial and cremation were often seen as impure (as human remains are polluted, while the earth and fire are sacred).
* Burial can be seen as an attempt to bring closure to the deceased&#x27;s family and friends. Psychologists in some Western Judeo-Christian quarters, as well as the US funeral industry, claim that by interring a body away from plain view the pain of losing a loved one can be lessened.
* Many cultures believe in an afterlife. Burial is sometimes believed to be a necessary step for an individual to reach the afterlife.
* Many religions prescribe a particular way to live, which includes customs relating to disposal of the dead.
* A decomposing body releases unpleasant gases related to decomposition. As such, burial is seen as a means of preventing smells from expanding into open air.

==Burial methods==
In many cultures, human corpses were usually buried in soil. The roots of burial as a practice reach back into the Middle Palaeolithic and coincide with the appearance of &quot;Homo neanderthalensis&quot; and &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, in Europe and Africa respectively. As a result, burial grounds are found throughout the world. Through time, mounds of earth, temples, and caverns were used to store the dead bodies of ancestors. In modern times, the custom of burying dead people below ground, with a stone marker to indicate the burial place, is used in most cultures; although other means such as cremation are becoming more popular in the West (cremation is the norm in India and mandatory in big metropolitan areas of Japan).

Some burial practices are heavily ritualized; others are simply practical.

===Burial depth===
It is a common misconception that graves must be dug to a depth of six feet (1.8 metres). This is reflected in the common euphemism for death of &quot;six feet under&quot;. In fact, graves are rarely dug to this depth except when it is intended to later bury a further coffin or coffins on top of the first one. In such cases, more than six feet may be dug, to provide the required depth of soil above the top coffin.

In the United States, there is no nationwide regulation of burial depth. Each local authority is free to determine its own rules. Requirements for depth can vary according to soil type and by method of burial. California, for instance, requires only 19 inches of soil above the top of the coffin, but more commonly 30 to 36 inches are required in other places. In some areas, such as central Appalachia, graves were indeed once dug to a depth of six feet to prevent the body being disturbed by burrowing animals. However, this was unnecessary once metal caskets and concrete vaults started to be used.

In the United Kingdom, soil is required to be to a depth of three feet above the highest point of the coffin, unless the burial authority consider the soil to be suitable for a depth of only two feet.

The earliest known reference to a requirement for a six-foot burial occurred in 1665 during the Great Plague of London. John Lawrence, the Lord Mayor of London, ordered that the bodies of plague victims &quot;...shall be at least six foot deep.&quot; The city officials apparently believed this would inhibit the spread of the disease, not realising that the true vector was fleas living on rats in the streets. In the event, there were so many victims that very few were buried in individual graves. Most were placed in massive plague pits so it is unlikely that this event alone gave rise to the &quot;six feet&quot; tradition.

===Natural burial===
Natural burial—also called &quot;green burial&quot;—is the process by which a body is returned to the earth to decompose naturally in soil, and in some cases even protect native and endangered wildlife. Natural burial became popularized in the UK in the early 1990s by Ken West, a professional cremator operator for the city of Carlisle, responding to the U.K&#x27;s call for changes in government that aligned with the United Nations&#x27; Environmental Program Local Agenda 21. In addition, there are multiple green burial sites in the U.S. Green burials are developing in Canada (Victoria, BC, and Cobourg, Ontario), as well as in Australia and Ireland.

The increase in popularity of alternative burials can be seen as a direct choice of the individual&#x27;s want to distance themselves from religious practices and spiritual locations as well as an opportunity to exercise their act of choice. The desire to live through nature as well as concern for the environment have been the backbone of the green burial movement. The use of coffins made from alternative materials such as wicker and biodegradable materials as well as trees and other flora are being used in place of headstones. Both practices provide sustainable alternatives to traditional burial practices.

Natural burials have been attracting people for reasons outside of environmental and sustainability factors as well. With the expansion of urban centres, ecological corridors gradually disappear. Cemeteries for burial plots preclude alternative uses of the land for a long time. By combining these two aspects (need for connectivity and land take imposed by cemeteries), two positive results can be achieved: protecting memories of the past and connecting ecosystems with multiple-use corridors. Green burials appeal to people for economic reasons. Traditional burial practices can be a financial burden causing some to turn to green burials as a cheaper alternative. Some people view green burials as more meaningful, especially for those who have a connection to a piece of land, such as current residence or other places that hold meaning for them.

====Types====
=====Conservation burial=====
Conservation burial is a type of burial where burial fees fund the acquisition and management of new land to benefit native habitat, ecosystems and species. This usually involves a legal document such as a conservation easement. Such burials go beyond other forms of natural burial, which aim to prevent environmental damage caused by conventional burial techniques, by actually increasing benefits for the environment. The idea is for the burial process to be a net positive for the earth rather than just neutral. Scientists have argued that such burials could potentially generate enough funds to save every endangered species on the planet. The Green Burial Council certifies natural and conservation burial grounds in the U.S. and Canada.

=====Memorial reef=====
The memorial reef is a natural, alternative approach to burial. The cremated remains of a person are mixed in with concrete and then placed into a mold to make the memorial reef or eternal reef. After the concrete sets, family members are allowed to customize the reef with writing, hand prints and chalk drawings. After this, the eco-friendly reefs are placed into the ocean among other coral reefs where they help to repair damage to the reefs while also providing new habitats for fish and other sea communities. It has become a new way to memorialize the passing person while also protecting the marine environment. The high cost of the memorial reefs has caused this alternative form of burial to remain minimal and uncommon. This kind of natural burial is practiced in permitted oceans in the U.S., specifically in locations around Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Maryland, New Jersey, Texas and Virginia.

=====Alkaline hydrolysis=====
Alkaline hydrolysis, also referred to as resomation, is another approach to natural burial. It uses high temperature water mixed with potassium hydroxide to dissolve human remains. During this process, the body is put into an enclosed, stainless steel chamber. The chamber fills with the chemical and water solution and is then lightly circulated. After a couple of hours, the body is worn down and bone is the only thing that remains. The bones are then pressed down into a powder and returned to the associated family. The outcome is comparable to cremation, but results in an environmentally friendly process that does not release chemical emissions and greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, as was confirmed after a review by the Health Council of the Netherlands. After this process, the water used goes to a regular water treatment facility where it is filtered and cleaned and returned to the water cycle. At this time, resomation is permitted for commercial use in areas throughout the U.S. However, several other countries, including the UK are considering using this technology within their medical schools and universities.

=====Mushroom burial=====
Mushroom burial has been developed by Jae Rhim Lee and her colleagues to address the impact traditional burial approaches have on the environment. It is an eco-friendly process which consists of dressing the cadaver in a bodysuit with mushroom spores woven into it, nicknamed the Infinity Burial Suit. Rhim developed her own mushrooms by feeding them her hair, skin, and nails to create a mushroom variety that will best decompose human remains. As the mushrooms grow, they consume the remains within the suit as well as the toxins that are being released by the body. Rhim and her colleagues created this suit as a symbol of a new way for people to think about the relationship between their body after death and the environment.

===== Tree pod burials =====
Another method of natural burial is being developed to plant the human body in fetal position inside an egg shaped pod. The pod containing the body will form a biodegradable capsule that will not harm the surrounding earth. The biodegradable capsule doubles as a seed which can be customized to grow into either a birch, maple, or eucalyptus tree. The goal of this method is to create parks full of trees that loved ones can walk through and mourn, as opposed to a graveyard full of tombstones. This method aims to return the body to the earth in the most environmentally friendly way possible.

The tree pod method originated in the UK but is now becoming a more popular method of burial. The definition of natural burial grounds suggests that people are being buried without any kind of formaldehyde-based embalming fluid or synthetic ingredients, and that the bodies that are being returned to the earth will also be returning nutrients to the environment, in a way that is less expensive than other available burial methods. Not only are tree pods a more cost effective and environmentally friendly way to memorialize loved ones, this method also offers emotional support. The memories of loved ones will be immortalized through the concept of a deceased person having a medium (trees) that will continue to live and grow.

===Prevention of decay===

Embalming is the practice of preserving a body against decay and is used in many cultures. Mummification is a more extensive method of embalming, further delaying the decay process.

Bodies are often buried wrapped in a shroud or placed in a coffin (or in some cases, a &quot;casket&quot;). A larger container may be used, such as a ship. In the U.S., coffins are usually covered by a grave liner or a burial vault, which prevents the coffin from collapsing under the weight of the earth or floating away during a flood.

These containers slow the decomposition process by (partially) physically blocking decomposing bacteria and other organisms from accessing the corpse. An additional benefit of using containers to hold the body is that if the soil covering the corpse is washed away by a flood or some other natural process then the corpse will still not be exposed to open air.

===Inclusion of clothing and personal effects===
The body may be dressed in fancy and/or ceremonial clothes. Personal objects of the deceased, such as a favorite piece of jewelry or photograph, may be included with the body. This practice, also known as the inclusion of grave goods, serves several purposes:
* In funeral services, the body is often put on display. Many cultures feel that the deceased should be presented looking his or her finest. Others dress the deceased in burial shrouds, which range from very simple to elaborate depending on the culture.
* The inclusion of ceremonial garb and sacred objects is sometimes viewed as necessary for reaching the afterlife.
* The inclusion of personal effects may be motivated by the beliefs that in the afterlife people will wish to have with them what was important to them on earth. Alternatively, in some cultures, it is felt that, when a person dies, their possessions (and sometimes people connected to them such as wives) should go with them out of loyalty or ownership.
* Although not generally a motivation for the inclusion of grave goods with a corpse, it is worth considering that future archaeologists may find the remains (compare time capsule). Artifacts such as clothing and objects provide insight into how the individual lived. This provides a form of immortality for the deceased. In general, however, clothing buried with a body decays more rapidly than the same buried alone.

==Traditions==
=== Body positioning ===
Burials may be placed in a number of different positions. Bodies with the arms crossed date back to ancient cultures such as Chaldea in the 10th century BC, where the &quot;X&quot; symbolized their sky god. Later ancient Egyptian gods and royalty, from approximately 3500 B.C. are shown with crossed arms, such as the god Osiris, the Lord of the Dead, or mummified royalty with crossed arms in high and low body positions, depending upon the dynasty. The burial of bodies in the &quot;extended&quot; position, i.e., lying flat with arms and legs straight, or with the arms folded upon the chest, and with the eyes and mouth closed. Extended burials may be &quot;supine&quot; (lying on the back) or &quot;prone&quot; (lying on the front). However, in some cultures, being buried face down shows marked disrespect like in the case of the Sioux. Other ritual practices place the body in a &quot;flexed&quot; position with the legs bent or &quot;crouched&quot; with the legs folded up to the chest. Warriors in some ancient societies were buried in an &quot;upright&quot; position. In Islam, the body is placed in supine position, hands along the sides and the head is turned to its right with the face towards the Qibla. Many cultures treat placement of dead people in an appropriate position to be a sign of respect even when burial is impossible.

In nonstandard burial practices, such as mass burial, the body may be positioned arbitrarily. This can be a sign of disrespect to the deceased, or at least nonchalance on the part of the inhumer, or due to considerations of time and space.

====Orientation====
Most often, a burial will be oriented to a specific direction for religious purposes, as are the case for persons of the Abrahamic faiths. Standard Jewish burials are made supine east–west, with the head at the western end of the grave, in order to face Jerusalem. In other cases, the body may be buried on a north–south axis, or, simply facing towards the exit of the cemetery or burial grounds. This is done in order to facilitate the return to Israel foretold of all those who are resurrected at the end of time following the coming of the Messiah. Historically, Christian burials followed similar principles, where the body was placed east–west, to mirror the layout of Christian churches, which were themselves oriented as such for much the same reason; to view the coming of Christ on Judgment day (Eschaton). In many Christian traditions, ordained clergy are traditionally buried in the opposite orientation, and their coffins carried likewise, so that at the General Resurrection they may rise facing, and ready to minister to, their people.

In an Islamic funeral, the grave should be aligned perpendicular to the Qibla (the direction to the Kaaba in Mecca) with the face turned to the right along the Qibla.

====Inverted burial====
For humans, maintaining an &quot;upside-down&quot; position, with the head vertically below the feet, is highly uncomfortable for any extended period of time, and consequently burial in that attitude (as opposed to attitudes of rest or watchfulness, as above) is highly unusual and generally symbolic. Occasionally suicides and assassins were buried upside down, as a post-mortem punishment and (as with burial at cross-roads) to inhibit the activities of the resulting undead.

In &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, the Lilliputians buried their dead upside down:
Swift&#x27;s notion of inverted burial might seem the highest flight of fancy, but it appears that among English millenarians the idea that the world would be &quot;turned upside down&quot; at the Apocalypse enjoyed some currency. There is at least one attested case of a person being buried upside down by instruction; a Major Peter Labilliere of Dorking (d. 4 June 1800) lies thus upon the summit of Box Hill. Similar stories have attached themselves to other noted eccentrics, particularly in southern England, but not always with a foundation in truth.

=== Burial traditions throughout the world ===

==== South Korea ====
South Korea&#x27;s funeral arrangements have drastically changed in the course of only two decades according to Chang-Won Park. Park states that around the 1980s at home funeral ceremonies were the general norm, straying away from anywhere that was not a family home. Dying close to home, with friends and family, was considered a &#x27;good death&#x27;, while dying away from home was considered a &#x27;bad death&#x27;. This gradually changed as the upper and middle class started holding funerals in the mortuaries of hospitals. This posed an issue for hospitals because of the rapid increase in funerals being held and maxing occupancy. This resolved when a law was passed to allow the civilian population to hold funerals in the mortuaries of hospitals. The lower class then followed suit, copying the newly set traditions of the upper classes. With this change, the practice of cremation became viewed more as an alternative to traditional burials. Cremation was first introduced by Buddhism, but was banned in 1470. It was not until the Japanese colonization period that cremation was reintroduced in 1945 and later lifted the ban. It took until 1998 for cremation to rapidly grow in popularity.

==== Tana Toraja ====
A TED Talk by Kelli Swazey discusses how Tana Toraja, a Sulawesi province in Eastern Indonesia, experiences death as a process, rather than an event. The culture of Tana Toraja views funerals as the most important event in a person&#x27;s life. Because of this importance placed on death, Tana Toraja landscape is covered in the rituals and events transpired after death. The hierarchy of an individual&#x27;s life is based on the sacrifices of animals made after their death. Funerals tend to be celebrated by Tana Toraja people, typically lasting days to even weeks long. Death is seen as a transformation, rather than a private loss. A Torajan is not considered &#x27;dead&#x27; until their family members are able to collect the resources necessary to hold a funeral that expresses the status of the deceased. Until these funerals are upheld the deceased are held in Tongkonan, built to house corpses that are not considered &#x27;dead&#x27;. The deceased can be held in Tongkonan for years, waiting for their families to collect the necessary resources to hold a funeral. The Tongkonan represents both the identity of the family and the process of birth and death. The process of birth and death is shown by having the houses that individuals are born in be the same structure as the Tongkonan, houses that individuals die in. Up until the funeral the deceased being housed in the Tongkonan are symbolically treated as members of the family, still being cared for by family members.

==== Australian Aboriginals (Northern Territory) ====
Northern Territory Australian Aboriginals have unique traditions associated with a loved one&#x27;s death. The death of a loved one sparks a series of events such as smoking out the spirit, a feast, and leaving out the body to decompose. Immediately after death, a smoking ceremony is held in the deceased&#x27;s home. The smoking ceremonies purpose is to expel the spirit of the deceased from their living quarters. A feast is held where mourners are covered in ochre, an earthy pigment associated with clay, while they eat and dance. The traditional corpse disposal of the Aboriginals includes covering the corpse in leaves on a platform. The corpse is then left to decompose.

==== Iranian people ====
Graves are free if the owner is poor, some ancient people colored the dead body while others feed the body to vultures and birds or burned the bodies. Body parts cut during the procedure are sometimes buried separately.
===Burial among African-American slaves===

In the African-American slave community, slaves quickly familiarized themselves with funeral procedures and the location of gravesites of family and friends. Specific slaves were assigned to prepare dead bodies, build coffins, dig graves, and construct headstones. Slave funerals were typically at night when the workday was over, with the master present to view all the ceremonial procedures. Slaves from nearby plantations were regularly in attendance.

At death, a slave&#x27;s body was wrapped in cloth. The hands were placed across the chest, and a metal plate was placed on top of their hands. The reasoning for the plate was to hinder their return home by suppressing any spirits in the coffin. Often, personal property was buried with slaves to appease spirits. The coffins were nailed shut once the body was inside, and carried by hand or wagon, depending on the property designated for slave burial site.

Slaves were buried oriented East to West, with feet at the Eastern end (head at the Western end, thus raising facing East). According to Christian doctrine, this orientation permitted rising to face the return of Christ without having to turn around upon the call of Gabriel&#x27;s trumpet. Gabriel&#x27;s trumpet would be blown near the Eastern sunrise.

===Burial in the Baháʼí Faith===
In the Baháʼí Faith, burial law prescribes both the location of burial and burial practices and precludes cremation of the dead. It is forbidden to carry the body for more than one hour&#x27;s journey from the place of death. Before interment the body should be wrapped in a shroud of silk or cotton, and a ring should be placed on its finger bearing the inscription &quot;I came forth from God, and return unto Him, detached from all save Him, holding fast to His Name, the Merciful, the Compassionate&quot;. The coffin should be of crystal, stone or hard fine wood. Also, before interment, a specific Prayer for the Dead is ordained. The body should be placed with the feet facing the Qiblih. The formal prayer and the ring are meant to be used for those who have reached 15 years of age.

==Locations==

===Where to bury===
Apart from sanitary and other practical considerations, the site of burial can be determined by religious and socio-cultural considerations.

Thus in some traditions, especially with an animistic logic, the remains of the dead are &quot;banished&quot; for fear their spirits would harm the living if too close; others keep remains close to help surviving generations.

Religious rules may prescribe a specific zone, e.g. some Christian traditions hold that Christians must be buried in consecrated ground, usually a cemetery; an earlier practice, burial in or very near the church (hence the word churchyard), was generally abandoned with individual exceptions as a high posthumous honour; also many existing funeral monuments and crypts remain in use.

Royalty and high nobility often have one or more &quot;traditional&quot; sites of burial, generally monumental, often in a palatial chapel or cathedral.

In North America, private family cemeteries were common among wealthy landowners during the 18th and 19th centuries. Many prominent people were buried in private cemeteries on their respective properties, sometimes in lead-lined coffins. Many of these family cemeteries were not documented and were therefore lost to time and abandoned; their grave markers having long since been pilfered by vandals or covered by forest growth. Their locations are occasionally discovered during construction projects.

===Marking the location of the burial===

Most modern cultures mark the location of the body with a headstone. This serves two purposes. First, the grave will not accidentally be exhumed. Second, headstones often contain information or tributes to deceased. This is a form of remembrance for loved ones; it can also be viewed as a form of immortality, especially in cases of famous people&#x27;s graves. Such monumental inscriptions may subsequently be useful to genealogists and family historians.

In many cultures graves will be grouped, so the monuments make up a necropolis, a &quot;city of the dead&quot; paralleling the community of the living.

====Unmarked grave====
In many cultures graves are marked with durable markers, or monuments, intended to help remind people of the buried person. An unmarked grave is a grave with no such memorial marker.

====Anonymous burial====
Another sort of unmarked grave is a burial site with an anonymous marker, such as a simple cross; boots, rifle and helmet; a sword and shield; a cairn of stones; or even a monument. This may occur when identification of the deceased is impossible. Although many unidentified deceased are buried in potter&#x27;s fields, some are memorialized, especially in smaller communities or in the case of deaths publicized by local media. Anonymous burials also happen in poorer or disadvantaged populations&#x27; communities in countries such as South Africa, where in the past the non-white population was simply too poor to afford headstones. At the cemetery in the small rural town of Harding, KwaZulu-Natal, many grave sites have no identification and just have a border of stones which mark out the dimensions of the grave site itself.

Many countries have buried an unidentified soldier (or other member of the military) in a prominent location as a form of respect for all unidentified war dead. The UK memorializes &#x27;the Unknown Warrior&#x27; in Westminster Abbey; France&#x27;s is buried underneath the Arc de Triomphe; Italy&#x27;s is buried within the Monumento al Milite Ignoto in Rome; Canada&#x27;s is buried at the National War Memorial in Ottawa; Australia&#x27;s is located at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra; New Zealand&#x27;s is located in Wellington; Russia&#x27;s memorial is in Alexander Garden in Moscow, and the U.S.&#x27;s is located at Arlington National Cemetery.

Many cultures practice anonymous burial as a norm, not an exception. For instance, in 2002 a survey for the Federal Guild of German Stonemasons found that, depending on the location within Germany, from 0% to 43% of burials were anonymous. According to &quot;Christian Century&quot; magazine, the perspective of the Roman Catholic Church is that anonymous burials reflect a dwindling belief in God. Others claim that this trend is mainly driven by secularism and the high costs of traditional burials.

====Secret burial====
In rare cases, a known person may be buried without identification, perhaps to avoid desecration of the corpse, grave robbing, or vandalism of the burial site. This may be particularly the case with infamous or notorious figures. In other cases, it may be to prevent the grave from becoming a tourist attraction or a destination of pilgrimage. Survivors may cause the deceased to be buried in a secret location or other unpublished place, or in a grave with a false name (or no name at all) on the marker.

Following Walt Disney&#x27;s cremation, his ashes were buried in a secret location in Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery, California. Some burial sites at Forest Lawn, such as those of Humphrey Bogart, Mary Pickford and Michael Jackson, are secluded in private gated gardens or mausoleums with no public access. A number of tombs are also kept from the public eye. Forest Lawn&#x27;s Court of Honor indicates that some of its crypts have plots which are reserved for individuals who may be &quot;voted in&quot; as &quot;Immortals&quot;; no amount of money can purchase a place. Photographs taken at Forest Lawn are not permitted to be published, and their information office usually refuses to reveal exactly where the remains of famous people are buried.

====Multiple bodies per grave====
Some couples or groups of people (such as a married couple or other family members) may wish to be buried in the same plot. In some cases, the coffins (or urns) may simply be buried side by side. In others, one casket may be interred above another. If this is planned for in advance, the first casket may be buried more deeply than is the usual practice so that the second casket may be placed over it without disturbing the first. In many states in Australia all graves are designated two or three depth (depending on the water table) for multiple burials, at the discretion of the burial rights holder, with each new interment atop the previous coffin separated by a thin layer of earth. As such all graves are dug to greater depth for the initial burial than the traditional six feet to facilitate this practice.

Mass burial is the practice of burying multiple bodies in one location. Civilizations attempting genocide often employ mass burial for victims. However, mass burial may in many cases be the only practical means of dealing with an overwhelming number of human remains, such as those resulting from a natural disaster, an act of terrorism, an epidemic, or an accident. This practice has become less common in the developed world with the advent of genetic testing, but even in the 21st century remains which are unidentifiable by current methods may be buried in a mass grave.

Individuals who are buried at the expense of the local authorities and buried in potter&#x27;s fields may be buried in mass graves. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was once believed to have been buried in such a manner, but today it is known that such burials were never allowed in Mozart&#x27;s Vienna, whose magistrates refused to agree to the burial regulations decreed by Joseph II. In some cases, the remains of unidentified individuals have been buried in mass graves in potter&#x27;s fields, making exhumation and future identification troublesome for law enforcement.

Naval ships sunk in combat are also considered mass graves by many countries. For example, U.S. Navy policy declares such wrecks a mass grave (such as the USS Arizona Memorial) and forbids the recovery of remains. In lieu of recovery, divers or submersibles may leave a plaque dedicated to the memory of the ship or boat and its crew, and family members are invited to attend the ceremony.

Sites of large former battlefields may also contain one or more mass graves. Douaumont ossuary is one such mass grave, and it contains the remains of 130,000 soldiers from both sides of the Battle of Verdun.

Catacombs also constitute a form of mass grave. Some catacombs, for example those in Rome, were designated as a communal burial place. Some, such as the catacombs of Paris, only became a mass grave when individual burials were relocated from cemeteries marked for demolition.

Judaism does not generally allow multiple bodies in a grave. An exception to this is a grave in the military cemetery in Jerusalem, where there is a &quot;kever achim&quot; (Hebrew: &quot;grave of brothers&quot;) where two soldiers were killed together in a tank and are buried in one grave. As the bodies were so fused together with the metal of the tank that they could not be separately identified, they were buried in one grave (along with parts of the tank).

===Live burial===
Sometimes people are buried alive. Having no way of escaping interment, they die in place, typically by asphyxiation, dehydration, starvation, or exposure to climate. People may come to be buried alive in a number of different ways;
* &quot;Intentional&quot;: buried alive as a method of execution or murder, called &quot;immurement&quot; when the person is entombed within walls. In ancient Rome, Vestal Virgins who broke their vows were punished in this way.
* &quot;Accidental&quot;: A person or group of people in a cave, mine, or other underground area may be sealed underground by an earthquake, cave in, avalanche or other natural disaster or accident.
* &quot;Inadvertent&quot;: People have been buried alive because they were mistakenly pronounced dead by a coroner or other official.

Edgar Allan Poe wrote a number of stories and poems about premature burial, including a story called &quot;The Premature Burial&quot;. These works inspired a widespread popular fear of this appalling but unlikely event. Various expedients have been devised to prevent it, including burying telephones or sensors in graves.

===Burial at cross-roads===
Historically, burial at cross-roads was the method of disposing of executed criminals and suicides. In Great Britain this tradition was altered by the Burial of Suicide Act 1823, which abolished the legal requirements of burying suicides and other people at crossroads. Cross-roads form a crude cross shape and this may have given rise to the belief that these spots were selected as the next best burying-places to consecrated ground. Another possible explanation is that the ancient Teutonic (Germanic) ethnic groups often built their altars at the cross-roads, and since human sacrifices, especially of criminals, formed part of the ritual, these spots came to be regarded as execution grounds. Hence after the introduction of Christianity, criminals and suicides were buried at the cross-roads during the night, to assimilate as far as possible their funeral to that of the pagans. An example of a cross-road execution-ground was the famous Tyburn in London, which stood on the spot where the Roman road to Edgware and beyond met the Roman road heading west out of London.

Superstition also played a part in the selection of crossroads in the burial of suicides. Folk belief often held such individuals could rise as some form of undead (such as a vampire) and burying them at crossroads would inhibit their ability to find and wreak havoc on their living relations and former associates.

==Burial of animals==

=== By humans ===

In addition to burying human remains, many human cultures also regularly bury animal remains.

Pets and other animals of emotional significance are often ceremonially buried. Most families bury deceased pets on their own properties, mainly in a yard, with a shoe box or any other type of container served as a coffin. The ancient Egyptians are known to have mummified and buried cats, which they considered deities.

=== By other animals ===
Humans are not always the only species to bury their dead. Chimpanzees and elephants are known to throw leaves and branches over fallen members of their family groups. In a particularly odd case, an elephant which trampled a human mother and child buried its victims under a pile of leaves before disappearing into the bushes. In 2013, a viral video caught a dog burying a dead puppy by pushing sand with its own nose. It is presumed, however, that since dogs retain the instinct to bury food, this is what is being depicted in the video. In social insects, ants and termites also bury their dead nestmates depending on the properties of the corpse and the social context. Laboratory rats had been observed using bedding material to bury dead conspecifics placed in their test chamber.

==Exhumation==
Exhumation, or disinterment, is the act of digging something up, especially a corpse. This is most often done to relocate a body to a different burial spot; families may make this decision to locate the deceased in a more pertinent or convenient place. In shared family burial sites (e.g. a married couple), if the previously deceased person has been buried for an insufficient period of time, the second body may be buried elsewhere until it is safe to relocate it to the shared grave.

Exhumation of human remains occur for a number of other reasons, including body identification or as part of a criminal investigation. If an individual dies in suspicious circumstances, police may request exhumation to determine the cause of death. Exhumations may also occur via grave robbery or as an act of desecration. In rare, historical cases (e.g. Pope Formosus or Oliver Cromwell), a body may be exhumed for posthumous execution, dissection, or gibbeting. Notable individuals may be exhumed to answer historical questions. Exhumation by archaeologists enables the study of remains, as with many ancient Egyptian mummies that have been put on public display.

In most jurisdictions, a legal exhumation usually requires a court order or permission by the next of kin of the deceased. U.S. law allows disinterment &quot;only for the most compelling of reasons&quot; and with the permission of close relatives and the cemetery official. Also in many countries, permits are required by some governing agency to legally conduct a disinterment.

In folklore and mythology, exhumation has also been frequently associated with the performance of rites to banish undead manifestations. A historical example is the 1892 Mercy Brown vampire incident of Rhode Island.

===Changing burial location===
Remains may be exhumed for reinterment at a more appropriate location for various reasons.
* The passing of time may mean political situations change and a burial can take place in different circumstances. Roger Casement was executed at Pentonville Prison in London on 3 August 1916 and buried in the prison grounds but his body was exhumed and given a state funeral in Dublin on 1 March 1965.
* Deceased individuals who were either not identified or misidentified at the time of burial may be reburied if survivors so wish. For example, when the remains of MIA soldiers are discovered, or the case of Nicholas II of Russia and his family, who were exhumed from unmarked graves near Yekaterinburg to be reinterred in the Peter and Paul Fortress in St. Petersburg.
* Cemeteries sometimes have a limited number of plots in which to bury the dead. Once all plots are full, older remains may be moved to an ossuary to accommodate more bodies, in accordance with burial contracts, religious and local burial laws. In Hong Kong where real estate is at a premium, burials in government-run cemeteries are disinterred after six years under exhumation order. Remains are either collected privately for cremation or reburied in an urn or niche. Unclaimed burials are exhumed and cremated by the government. Permanent burial in privately run cemeteries is allowed. In Singapore, cremation is preferred by most Singaporeans because burials in Singapore is limited to 15 years. After 15 years, Singaporean graves will be exhumed and the remains will either be cremated or re-interred.
* Remains may be exhumed and reburied en masse when a cemetery is relocated, once local planning and religious requirements are met. It also enables construction agencies to clear the way for new constructions. One example of this is cemeteries in Chicago next to O&#x27;Hare International Airport to expand the runways. The remains of the Venerable or the Blessed are sometimes exhumed to ensure their bodies lie in their correctly marked graves, as their gravesites usually become places for devotees to gather, and also to collect relics. The bodies may also be transferred to a more dignified place. It also serves the purpose to see if they are supernaturally Incorrupt. An incorrupt corpse is no longer considered miraculous, but it is a characteristic of several known saints. Exhumation is no longer a requirement in the beatification process, but still may be carried out.
* For ethical and cultural reasons, repatriation and reburial of human remains may be carried out when museums and academic institutions return remains to their place of origin.

===Cultural aspects of exhumation===
Frequently, cultures have different sets of exhumation taboos. Occasionally these differences result in conflict, especially in cases where a culture with more lenient exhumation rules wishes to operate on the territory of a different culture. For example, U.S. construction companies have run into conflict with Native American groups that have wanted to preserve their burial grounds from disturbance.

In Southern Chinese culture, graves are opened after a period of years. The bones are removed, cleaned, dried, and placed in a ceramic pot for reburial (in Taiwan), or in a smaller coffin and to be reburied in another location (in Vietnam). The practice is called &quot;jiǎngǔ&quot;(撿骨) in Taiwan, or &quot;Bốc mộ&quot;(卜墓) in Vietnam &quot;digging up bones&quot; and is an important ritual in the posthumous &quot;care&quot; of children for their deceased parents and ancestors.

Jewish law forbids the exhumation of a corpse.

The majority of Muslim jurors maintain that an individual buried in a mosque must be exhumed and that offering prayers in such a mosque renders the prayer invalid. Jurists, however, hold that mosques built around already existing graves are to be demolished.

In England and Wales once the top of a coffin has been lowered below ground level in a burial if it is raised again, say for example the grave sides are protruding and need further work, this is considered an exhumation and the Home Office are required to be notified and a full investigation undertaken. Therefore, grave diggers in England and Wales are particularly careful to ensure that grave sites are dug with plenty of room for the coffin to pass.

==Reinterment==
Reinterment refers to the reburial of a corpse.

==Secondary burial==

Secondary burial is a burial, cremation, or inhumation that is dug into a barrow or grave any time after its initial construction. It is often associated with the belief that there is a liminal phase between the time that a person dies and finally decays.

==Alternatives to burial==
Alternatives to burial variously show respect for the dead, accelerate decomposition and disposal, or prolong display of the remains.
* Burial at sea is the practice of depositing the body or scattering its ashes in an ocean or other large body of water instead of soil. The body may be disposed in a coffin, or without one.
* Funerary cannibalism is the practice of eating the remains. This may be done for many reasons: for example to partake of their strength, to spiritually &quot;close the circle&quot; by reabsorbing their life into the family or clan, to annihilate an enemy, or due to pathological mental conditions. The Yanomami have the practice of cremating the remains and then eating the ashes with banana paste.
* Cremation is the incineration of the remains. This practice is common amongst Hindus and is becoming increasingly common in other cultures as well. If a family member wishes, the ashes can now be turned into a gem, similar to creating synthetic diamonds.
* Whether cryonics constitutes a method of interment, rather than a form of medical treatment, remains under debate. See also information-theoretic death and clinical death.
* Excarnation is the practice of removing the flesh from the corpse without interment. The Zoroastrians have traditionally left their dead on Towers of Silence, where the flesh of the corpses is left to be devoured by vultures and other carrion-eating birds. Alternatively, it can also mean butchering the corpse by hand to remove the flesh (also referred to as &quot;defleshing&quot;).
* Gibbeting was the semi-ancient practice of publicly displaying remains of criminals.
* Hanging coffins are coffins placed on cliffs, found in various locations, including China and the Philippines.
* Ossuaries were used for interring human skeletal remains by Second Temple Jews and early Christians.
* Promession is a method of freeze drying human remains before burial to increase the rate of decomposition.
* Resomation accelerates disposal through the process of alkaline hydrolysis.
* Sky burial places the body on a mountaintop, where it decomposes in the elements or is scavenged by carrion eaters, particularly vultures.

=== Adapting traditions ===

==== Burial ====
As the human population progresses, cultures and traditions change with it. Evolution is generally slow, sometimes more rapid. South Korea&#x27;s funeral arrangements have drastically changed in the course of only two decades according to Chang-Won Park. Around the 1980s at home funeral ceremonies were the general norm, straying away from anywhere that was not a family home. Dying close to home, with friends and family, was considered a &#x27;good death&#x27;, while dying away from home was considered a &#x27;bad death&#x27;. This gradually changed as the upper and middle class started holding funerals in the mortuaries of hospitals. This posed an issue for hospitals because of the rapid increase in funerals being held and maxing occupancy. This quickly resolved when a law was passed to allow the civilian population holding funerals in the mortuaries of hospitals. The lower class quickly followed suit, copying the newly set traditions of the upper classes. With this change, cremation also practice more as an alternative to traditional burials. Cremation was first introduced by Buddhism, and was quickly banned in 1470. It was not until the Japanese colonization period that cremation was reintroduced in 1945 and later on lifted the ban. It took until 1998 for cremation to rapidly grow in popularity.

==== Funeral ceremonies ====
According to Margaret Holloway, funerals are believed to be driven by the consumer&#x27;s choice, personalisation, secularization, and stories that place individual traditional meta-narratives. It has been studied that funeral homes in the UK are most concerned with comforting the grieving, rather than focusing on the departed. This study found that modern day funerals focus on the psycho-social-spiritual event. Modern day funerals also help the transition of the recently passed transitioning to the social status of &#x27;the deceased&#x27;. The article found that funeral homes do not adhere to traditional religious beliefs, but do follow religious traditions.

<doc id="177512" wikidata="Q187097" url="?curid=177512" title="Economic geography">
<text>Economic geography is the subfield of human geography that studies economic activity and factors affecting it. It can also be considered a subfield or method in economics.

Economic geography takes a variety of approaches to many different topics, including the location of industries, economies of agglomeration (also known as &quot;linkages&quot;), transportation, international trade, development, real estate, gentrification, ethnic economies, gendered economies, core-periphery theory, the economics of urban form, the relationship between the environment and the economy (tying into a long history of geographers studying culture-environment interaction), and globalization.

== Theoretical background and influences ==
There are diverse methodological approaches in the field of location theory. Neoclassical location theorists, following in the tradition of Alfred Weber, often concentrate on industrial location and employ quantitative methods. However, since the 1970s, two major reactions against neoclassical approaches have reshaped the discipline. One is Marxist political economy, stemming from the contributions of scholars like David Harvey, which offers a critical perspective on spatial economics. The other is the new economic geography, which considers social, cultural, and institutional factors alongside economic aspects in understanding spatial phenomena.

Economists like Paul Krugman and Jeffrey Sachs have contributed extensively to the analysis of economic geography. Krugman, in particular, referred to his application of spatial thinking to international trade theory as the &quot;new economic geography,&quot; which presents a competing perspective to a similarly named approach within the discipline of geography. This overlap in terminology can lead to confusion. As an alternative, some scholars have proposed using the term &quot;geographical economics&quot; to differentiate between the two approaches.

==History==

Early approaches to economic geography are found in the seven Chinese maps of the State of Qin, which date to the 4th century BC and in the Greek geographer Strabo&#x27;s &quot;Geographika&quot;, compiled almost 2000 years ago. As cartography developed, geographers illuminated many aspects used today in the field; maps created by different European powers described the resources likely to be found in American, African, and Asian territories. The earliest travel journals included descriptions of the native people, the climate, the landscape, and the productivity of various locations. These early accounts encouraged the development of transcontinental trade patterns and ushered in the era of mercantilism.

Lindley M. Keasbey wrote in 1901 that no discipline of economic geography existed, with scholars either doing geography or economics. Keasbey argued for a discipline of economic geography, writing,On the one hand, the economic activities of man are determined from the first by the phenomena of nature; and, on the other hand, the phenomena of nature are subsequently modified by the economic activities of man. Since this is the case, to start the deductions of economics, the inductions of geography are necessary; and to continue the inductions of geography, the deductions of economics are required. Logically, therefore, economics is impossible without geography, and geography is incomplete without economics.World War II contributed to the popularization of geographical knowledge generally, and post-war economic recovery and development contributed to the growth of economic geography as a discipline. During environmental determinism&#x27;s time of popularity, Ellsworth Huntington and his theory of climatic determinism, while later greatly criticized, notably influenced the field. Valuable contributions also came from location theorists such as Johann Heinrich von Thünen or Alfred Weber. Other influential theories include Walter Christaller&#x27;s Central place theory, the theory of core and periphery. 

Fred K. Schaefer&#x27;s article &quot;Exceptionalism in geography: A Methodological Examination&quot;, published in the American journal &quot;Annals of the Association of American Geographers&quot;, and his critique of regionalism, made a large impact on the field: the article became a rallying point for the younger generation of economic geographers who were intent on reinventing the discipline as a science, and quantitative methods began to prevail in research. Well-known economic geographers of this period include William Garrison, Brian Berry, Waldo Tobler, Peter Haggett and William Bunge.

Contemporary economic geographers tend to specialize in areas such as location theory and spatial analysis (with the help of geographic information systems), market research, geography of transportation, real estate price evaluation, regional and global development, planning, Internet geography, innovation, social networks.

==Approaches to study==
As economic geography is a very broad discipline, with economic geographers using many different methodologies in the study of economic phenomena in the world some distinct approaches to study have evolved over time:
*&quot;Theoretical economic geography&quot; focuses on building theories about spatial arrangement and distribution of economic activities.
*&quot;Regional economic geography&quot; examines the economic conditions of particular regions or countries of the world. It deals with economic regionalization as well as local economic development.
*&quot;Historical economic geography&quot; examines the history and development of spatial economic structure. Using historical data, it examines how centers of population and economic activity shift, what patterns of regional specialization and localization evolve over time and what factors explain these changes.
*&quot;Evolutionary economic geography&quot; adopts an evolutionary approach to economic geography. More specifically, Evolutionary Economic Geography uses concepts and ideas from evolutionary economics to understand the evolution of cities, regions, and other economic systems. 
*&quot;Critical economic geography&quot; is an approach taken from the point of view of contemporary critical geography and its philosophy.
*&quot;Behavioral economic geography&quot; examines the cognitive processes underlying spatial reasoning, locational decision making, and behavior of firms and individuals.

Economic geography is sometimes approached as a branch of anthropogeography that focuses on regional systems of human economic activity. An alternative description of different approaches to the study of human economic activity can be organized around spatiotemporal analysis, analysis of production/consumption of economic items, and analysis of economic flow. Spatiotemporal systems of analysis include economic activities of region, mixed social spaces, and development.

Alternatively, analysis may focus on production, exchange, distribution, and consumption of items of economic activity. Allowing parameters of space-time and item to vary, a geographer may also examine material flow, commodity flow, population flow and information flow from different parts of the economic activity system. Through analysis of flow and production, industrial areas, rural and urban residential areas, transportation site, commercial service facilities and finance and other economic centers are linked together in an economic activity system.

===Branches===
Thematically, economic geography can be divided into these subdisciplines:
* Geography of agriculture
It is traditionally considered the branch of economic geography that investigates those parts of the Earth&#x27;s surface that are transformed by humans through primary sector activities. It thus focuses on structures of agricultural landscapes and asks for the processes that lead to these spatial patterns. While most research in this area concentrates rather on production than on consumption,[1] a distinction can be made between nomothetic (e.g. distribution of spatial agricultural patterns and processes) and idiographic research (e.g. human-environment interaction and the shaping of agricultural landscapes). The latter approach of agricultural geography is often applied within regional geography.
* Geography of industry
* Geography of international trade
* Geography of resources
* Geography of transport and communication
* Geography of finance

These areas of study may overlap with other geographical sciences.

===Economists and economic geographers===
Generally, spatially interested economists study the effects of space &quot;on the economy&quot;. Geographers, on the other hand, are interested in the economic processes&#x27; impact &quot;on spatial structures&quot;.

Moreover, economists and economic geographers differ in their methods in approaching spatial-economic problems in several ways. An economic geographer will often take a more holistic approach to the analysis of economic phenomena, which is to conceptualize a problem in terms of space, place, and scale as well as the overt economic problem that is being examined. The economist approach, according to some economic geographers, has the main drawback of homogenizing the economic world in ways economic geographers try to avoid.

===The New Economic Geography===

With the rise of the New Economy, economic inequalities are increasing spatially. The New Economy, generally characterized by globalization, increasing use of information and communications technology, the growth of knowledge goods, and feminization, has enabled economic geographers to study social and spatial divisions caused by the rising New Economy, including the emerging digital divide.

The new economic geographies consist of primarily service-based sectors of the economy that use innovative technology, such as industries where people rely on computers and the internet. Within these is a switch from manufacturing-based economies to the digital economy. In these sectors, competition makes technological changes robust. These high technology sectors rely heavily on interpersonal relationships and trust, as developing things like software is very different from other kinds of industrial manufacturing—it requires intense levels of cooperation between many different people, as well as the use of tacit knowledge. As a result of cooperation becoming a necessity, there is a clustering in the high-tech new economy of many firms.

Diane Perrons argues that in Anglo-American literature, the New Economy Geography consists of two distinct types. 
* New Economic Geography 1 (NEG1) is characterized by sophisticated spatial modelling. It seeks to explain uneven development and the emergence of industrial clusters. It does so through the exploration of linkages between centripetal and centrifugal forces, especially those of economies of scale.
* New Economic Geography 2 (NEG2) also seeks to explain the apparently paradoxical emergence of industrial clusters in a contemporary context, however, it emphasizes relational, social, and contextual aspects of economic behaviour, particularly the importance of tacit knowledge. The main difference between these two types is NEG2&#x27;s emphasis on aspects of economic behaviour that NEG1 considers intangible.

Both New Economic Geographies acknowledge transport costs, the importance of knowledge in a new economy, possible effects of externalities, and endogenous processes that generate increases in productivity. The two also share a focus on the firm as the most important unit and on growth rather than development of regions. As a result, the actual impact of clusters on a region is given far less attention, relative to the focus on clustering of related activities in a region.

However, the focus on the firm as the main entity of significance hinders the discussion of New Economic Geography. It limits the discussion in a national and global context and confines it to a smaller scale context. It also places limits on the nature of the firm&#x27;s activities and their position within the global value chain. Further work done by Bjorn Asheim (2001) and Gernot Grabher (2002) challenges the idea of the firm through action-research approaches and mapping organizational forms and their linkages. In short, the focus on the firm in new economic geographies is undertheorized in NEG1 and undercontextualized in NEG2, which limits the discussion of its impact on spatial economic development.

Spatial divisions within these arising New Economic geographies are apparent in the form of the digital divide, as a result of regions attracting talented workers instead of developing skills at a local level (see Creative Class for further reading). Despite increasing inter-connectivity through developing information communication technologies, the contemporary world is still defined through its widening social and spatial divisions, most of which are increasingly gendered. Danny Quah explains these spatial divisions through the characteristics of knowledge goods in the New Economy: goods defined by their infinite expansibility, weightlessness, and nonrivalry. Social divisions are expressed through new spatial segregation that illustrates spatial sorting by income, ethnicity, abilities, needs, and lifestyle preferences. Employment segregation is evidence by the overrepresentation of women and ethnic minorities in lower-paid service sector jobs. These divisions in the new economy are much more difficult to overcome as a result of few clear pathways of progression to higher-skilled work.
== Influence of Geography on Economic History ==
The study of geography, in terms of how it has shaped or impacted on the settlement, location of resources, trade routes, shows how geography has shaped economic history. One of the reasons why interactions between geographic characteristics and economic activity can be convoluted is because the said characteristics are the primary cause by which the emergence or decline of civilizations.
Transportation and Trade 

In the past rivers and water ways have remained critical transport channels. In the Nile, river, one of the first civilization icons of Egypt benefited from transport of goods and farming. Similarly it proliferated economic unification across the entire China with its influence on Yangtze River. The present is still true for a river like the Mississippi in order to efficiently transport products. 
Meanwhile geographical hindrances which include deserts, mountains among others make trade challenging. Sahara Desert needed some trade routes that were strictly depended on the oases while Himalayas separated some places like Tibet.
However, there are some well-developed mountain passes, which play an essential role in the commercial experience, for example Khyber Pass.
Agriculture and the Climate
Climate too plays a very important role in determining the pace of economic development. The results also indicated that the level of productivity in agriculturally dominated regions was higher where the weather was moderate. For instance, the Mediterranean environment creates employment in the Southern Europe through the promotion of the sale of olive oil and wines. On the other hand, in desert region, creativity in matters concerning the use of water as a resource is well hammered when there is no innovation in the use of water..
Historical Background
Historically, geography has influenced whether some parts of the world are indeed capable of supporting civilization at any one point in time. Colonial powers during the period of exploration were able to take advantages of the geographical opportunities, while the initial farm based communities were found to be developed in the Fertile Crescent. Sea channels connected continents for the primary aim of the acquisition of resources in the Atlantic Slave trade.
Contemporary Consequences
Geographical barriers continue to impact the economic outcomes in the present situation. Maritime trade benefits countries that are bordering the ocean.
But the cost of transport is comparatively higher in the land locked countries. Despite what technology has made geography do to us, it is possible to weigh in on the future course that our future economic plans are to take through gaining an understanding of geography’s far reaching implications.

<text>Molecular engineering is an emerging field of study concerned with the design and testing of molecular properties, behavior and interactions in order to assemble better materials, systems, and processes for specific functions. This approach, in which observable properties of a macroscopic system are influenced by direct alteration of a molecular structure, falls into the broader category of “bottom-up” design.

Molecular engineering is highly interdisciplinary by nature, encompassing aspects of chemical engineering, materials science, bioengineering, electrical engineering, physics, mechanical engineering, and chemistry. There is also considerable overlap with nanotechnology, in that both are concerned with the behavior of materials on the scale of nanometers or smaller. Given the highly fundamental nature of molecular interactions, there are a plethora of potential application areas, limited perhaps only by one&#x27;s imagination and the laws of physics. However, some of the early successes of molecular engineering have come in the fields of immunotherapy, synthetic biology, and printable electronics (see molecular engineering applications).

Molecular engineering is a dynamic and evolving field with complex target problems; breakthroughs require sophisticated and creative engineers who are conversant across disciplines. A rational engineering methodology that is based on molecular principles is in contrast to the widespread trial-and-error approaches common throughout engineering disciplines. Rather than relying on well-described but poorly-understood empirical correlations between the makeup of a system and its properties, a molecular design approach seeks to manipulate system properties directly using an understanding of their chemical and physical origins. This often gives rise to fundamentally new materials and systems, which are required to address outstanding needs in numerous fields, from energy to healthcare to electronics. Additionally, with the increased sophistication of technology, trial-and-error approaches are often costly and difficult, as it may be difficult to account for all relevant dependencies among variables in a complex system. Molecular engineering efforts may include computational tools, experimental methods, or a combination of both.

==History==

Molecular engineering was first mentioned in the research literature in 1956 by Arthur R. von Hippel, who defined it as &quot;… a new mode of thinking about engineering problems. Instead of taking prefabricated materials and trying to devise engineering applications consistent with their macroscopic properties, one builds materials from their atoms and molecules for the purpose at hand.&quot; This concept was echoed in Richard Feynman&#x27;s seminal 1959 lecture &quot;There&#x27;s Plenty of Room at the Bottom&quot;, which is widely regarded as giving birth to some of the fundamental ideas of the field of nanotechnology. In spite of the early introduction of these concepts, it was not until the mid-1980s with the publication of &quot;Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology&quot; by Drexler that the modern concepts of nano and molecular-scale science began to grow in the public consciousness.

The discovery of electrically conductive properties in polyacetylene by Alan J. Heeger in 1977 effectively opened the field of organic electronics, which has proved foundational for many molecular engineering efforts. Design and optimization of these materials has led to a number of innovations including organic light-emitting diodes and flexible solar cells.

==Applications==
Molecular design has been an important element of many disciplines in academia, including bioengineering, chemical engineering, electrical engineering, materials science, mechanical engineering and chemistry. However, one of the ongoing challenges is in bringing together the critical mass of manpower amongst disciplines to span the realm from design theory to materials production, and from device design to product development. Thus, while the concept of rational engineering of technology from the bottom-up is not new, it is still far from being widely translated into R&amp;D efforts.

Molecular engineering is used in many industries. Some applications of technologies where molecular engineering plays a critical role:

=== Consumer Products ===

* Antibiotic surfaces (e.g. incorporation of silver nanoparticles or antibacterial peptides into coatings to prevent microbial infection) 
* Cosmetics (e.g. rheological modification with small molecules and surfactants in shampoo)
* Cleaning products (e.g. nanosilver in laundry detergent)
* Consumer electronics (e.g. organic light-emitting diode displays (OLED))
* Electrochromic windows (e.g. windows in the Boeing 787 Dreamliner) 
* Zero emission vehicles (e.g. advanced fuel cells/batteries)
* Self-cleaning surfaces (e.g. super hydrophobic surface coatings)

=== Energy Harvesting and Storage ===

* Flow batteries - Synthesizing molecules for high-energy density electrolytes and highly-selective membranes in grid-scale energy storage systems.
* Lithium-ion batteries - Creating new molecules for use as electrode binders, electrolytes, electrolyte additives, or even for energy storage directly in order to improve energy density (using materials such as graphene, silicon nanorods, and lithium metal), power density, cycle life, and safety.
* Solar cells - Developing new materials for more efficient and cost-effective solar cells including organic, quantum dot or perovskite-based photovoltaics.
* Photocatalytic water splitting - Enhancing the production of hydrogen fuel using solar energy and advanced catalytic materials such as semiconductor nanoparticles

=== Environmental Engineering ===

* Water desalination (e.g. new membranes for highly-efficient low-cost ion removal)
* Soil remediation (e.g. catalytic nanoparticles that accelerate the degradation of long-lived soil contaminants such as chlorinated organic compounds)
* Carbon sequestration (e.g. new materials for CO2 adsorption)

<text>Jacqueline Pascal (4 October 1625 – 4 October 1661), sister of Blaise Pascal and Gilberte Périer, was born at Clermont-Ferrand, Auvergne, France.

Like her brother she was a prodigy, composing verses when only eight years old, and a five-act comedy at eleven. In 1646, the influence of her brother converted her to Jansenism. Then in 1652, she took the veil, and entered Port-Royal Abbey, Paris, despite the strong opposition of her brother, and subsequently was largely instrumental in the latter&#x27;s own final conversion. She vehemently opposed the attempt to compel the assent of the nuns to the Papal bulls condemning Jansenism, but was at last compelled to yield. This blow, however, hastened her death, which occurred at Paris on 4 October 1661, the same day she turned 36.

<text>EAA AirVenture Oshkosh (formerly the EAA Annual Convention and Fly-In), or just Oshkosh, is an annual air show and gathering of aviation enthusiasts held each summer at the Wittman Regional Airport and adjacent Pioneer Airport in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, United States. The southern part of the show grounds, as well as &quot;Camp Scholler&quot;, are located in the town of Nekimi and a base for seaplanes is located on Lake Winnebago in the town of Black Wolf.

The airshow is arranged by the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA), an international general aviation organization based in Oshkosh, and is the largest of its kind in the world. The show lasts a week, usually beginning on the Monday of the last full week in July. During the gathering, the airport&#x27;s control tower, frequency 118.5, is the busiest in the world.

== History ==

EAA was founded in Hales Corners, Wisconsin in 1953 by aircraft designer and military aviator veteran Paul Poberezny, who originally started the organization in the basement of his home for builders and restorers of recreational aircraft. Although homebuilding is still a large part of the organization&#x27;s activities, it has grown to include almost every aspect of recreational, commercial and military aviation, as well as aeronautics and astronautics. The first EAA fly-in was held in September 1953 at what is now Timmerman Field as a small part of the Milwaukee Air Pageant, fewer than 150 people registered as visitors the first year and only a handful of airplanes attended the event. In 1959, the EAA fly-in grew too large for the Air Pageant and moved to Rockford, Illinois. In 1970, when it outgrew its facilities at the Rockford airport (now Chicago Rockford International Airport), it moved to Oshkosh, Wisconsin. Much of the convention&#x27;s growth and prominence on the world stage is credited to founder Paul Poberezny&#x27;s son, aerobatic world champion and longtime EAA president Tom Poberezny, who became chairman of the event in 1977.

For many years, its official name was &quot;The EAA Annual Convention and Fly-In&quot;. In 1998, the name was changed to &quot;AirVenture Oshkosh&quot;, but many regular attendees still call it as &quot;The Oshkosh Airshow&quot; or just &quot;Oshkosh&quot;. For many years, access to the flight line was restricted to EAA members. In 1997, the fee structure for the show was changed allowing all visitors access to the entire grounds. EAA AirVenture holds nearly 1,000 forums and workshops, in addition to their many vendors which bring a variety of aircraft supplies, general merchandise, and name brand sponsors such as Piper, Cessna, Cirrus, and many others. 

The 2020 AirVenture convention and air show was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Historical aircraft debuts===

AirVenture has hosted the debut of numerous revolutionary designs. Richard VanGrunsven debuted his Van&#x27;s RV-3 at the 1972 AirVenture Oshkosh, a homebuilt that defined new ways of aircraft performance. VanGrunsven would eventually go on to build more homebuilts than anyone else in the world, exceeding the annual production of all commercial general aviation companies combined. In 1975, aircraft designer Burt Rutan introduced his VariEze canard aircraft at Oshkosh, pioneering the use of moldless glass-reinforced plastic construction in homebuilts, a technique that several aircraft went on to adopt in the ensuing years including composite commercial airliners. At the 1987 AirVenture, Cirrus Aircraft&#x27;s founders, the Klapmeier brothers, unveiled the Cirrus VK-30 kit aircraft, which later led to the creation of the successful SR20 and SR22, the first designs to incorporate all-composite fiberglass construction, glass-panel cockpits and airframe ballistic parachutes for use in manufactured light aircraft.

Other past notable designs introduced at AirVenture include Frank Christensen&#x27;s Christen Eagle II aerobatic kit biplane in 1978, Tom Hamilton&#x27;s Glasair 1 in 1980, and Lance Neibauer&#x27;s Lancair 200 in 1985.

At the 2018 AirVenture, Jack Bally introduced his Bally Bomber B-17, a one-third scale, single seat homebuilt intended as a replica of the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, and Mike Patey introduced DRACO, a highly modified PZL-104 Wilga made for STOL and bush flying.

==Attendance==

The EAA estimated the attendance in 2021 at 608,000 people. In 2018, 2,714 international visitors registered from 87 nations. There were approximately 10,000 aircraft, 2,979 show planes, and 976 media representatives on-site from six continents, along with 867 commercial exhibitors.

In the past, attendance at the event was tabulated on a daily basis rather than on an individual basis. It is unclear whether this practice still exists at EAA Airventure. For example, in 2006 the Oshkosh Northwestern reported that attendance was estimated at 625,000 by the EAA. The estimate was for total attendees each day, so one person attending 7 days would count as 7 attendees. The paper estimated that between 200,000 and 300,000 individuals attended the event.

The large number of aircraft arrivals and departures during the fly-in week makes the Wittman Field FAA control tower the busiest in the world for that week in number of movements. To accommodate the huge flow of aircraft around the airport and the nearby airspace, a special NOTAM is published each year, choreographing the normal and emergency procedures to follow. More than 4,000 volunteers contribute approximately 250,000 hours before, during and after the event.

==Economic impact==
The EAA AirVenture fly-in has a large economic impact on the Oshkosh area as well as the state of Wisconsin. In 1982, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that the fly-in had a large economic benefit to the Fox Valley region. At the time EAA estimated the benefit to be around $30 million ($ in ) and the Oshkosh Convention and Tourism bureau estimated it to be lower, at $21 million ($ in ). In 1989, the Oshkosh Chamber of Commerce said that Winnebago County had a $47 million benefit from the fly in. Additionally, a 1987 UW-Oshkosh study reported a $65 million ($ in ) benefit to the entire state of Wisconsin.

In 2008, a UW-Oshkosh Center for Community Partnerships study showed a $110 million economic impact for the Oshkosh area. Of that, $84 million was direct impact with a $26 million multiplier from secondary spending. Additionally, the fly in provided 1,700 jobs and $39 million in labor income for Winnebago, Outagamie, and Fond du Lac counties. In 2017, it was estimated that the event had an over $170 million economic impact on the surrounding area.

==Air-traffic operation==

In 1961, The Rockford EAA airshow had 10,000 aircraft movements. In 1971, the EAA airshow at Oshkosh brought in 600 planes and 31,653 movements. Today AirVenture brings in more than 10,000 airplanes. Special air traffic procedures are used to ensure safe, coordinated operations. For example, in 2014 the special flight procedures NOTAM was 32 pages long.

FAA air traffic staff, including controllers, supervisors, and managers, compete throughout the FAA&#x27;s 17-state Central Terminal Service Area to work the event. In 2008, 172 air traffic professionals representing 56 facilities volunteered to staff the facilities at Oshkosh (OSH), Fond du Lac (FLD), and Fisk. They wear bright pink shirts to stand out in the crowd.

Due to the budget sequestration in 2013, the Federal Aviation Administration announced that it was not able to send resources to support the AirVenture. Rather than cancelling the event, the Experimental Aircraft Association was forced to sign a $447,000 contract to repay the government for FAA resources during the AirVenture. EAA filed a petition in Federal court arguing that the FAA could not withhold services without specific Congressional action. However, in March 2014 EAA signed a settlement agreement agreeing to pay the 2013 costs and a further agreement that guaranteed FAA participation for another nine years. The agreement required the association to reimburse the government for AirVenture specific costs that had been provided at government expense in the years prior to 2013.

===Technical operations===
Several days prior to the event, members of the FAA&#x27;s Technical Operation team from around the Central Service Area arrive in Oshkosh to set up the temporary communication facilities (mobile communication platforms, Fisk VFR approach control and Fond du Lac (FLD) tower). These technicians maintain the facilities during the event and tear down and store the equipment after AirVenture ends.

==Volunteering==
EAA AirVenture relies heavily on volunteers who arrive in the weeks leading up to the air show. The tasks they perform range from parking cars and airplanes, to painting buildings, to helping set up and tear down concerts and shows presented by the EAA. Long-time volunteers receive free meals, tee-shirts, embroidered patches, and free admission into the EAA AirVenture event.

==National Blue Beret==
National Blue Beret (NBB) is a National Cadet Special Activity in the Civil Air Patrol. The event is two weeks long and is set up so that the second week will overlap with the AirVenture airshow. Participants are Civil Air Patrol cadet and senior members who must go through a competitive selection process in order to attend the event. Participants help conduct event operations, including flight marshaling, crowd control, and emergency services.

<text>The Messerschmitt Me 410 &quot;Hornisse&quot; (Hornet) is a heavy fighter and Schnellbomber (&quot;Fast Bomber&quot; in English) designed and produced by the German aircraft manufacturer Messerschmitt. It was flown by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; during the latter half of the Second World War.

Work began on producing a successor to the Bf 110 in 1937, however, the resulting Me 210 proved to be unsatisfactory, leading to production being halted in April 1942. Various options were considered, including the ambitious Me 310 derivative. Officials favoured an incremental improvement which was represented by the Me 410. Although visually similar to the preceding Me 210, and was sharing sufficient design similarities that incomplete Me 210s could be converted into Me 410s, there were key differences between the two aircraft. Chiefly, the Me 410 was powered by larger Daimler-Benz DB 603 engines, had a lengthened fuselage, and automatic leading edge slats.

During late 1942, the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (RLM) were sufficiently convinced by the programme to proceed with quantity production of the type, the first Me 410s being delivered during January 1943. Various models were produced, including the Me 410A-1 light bomber, the A-1/U1 aerial reconnaissance aircraft, the A-1/U2 bomber destroyer, and the A-2/U4 night fighter. Upon their entry to service, the type was promptly flown on night time bombing missions in the British Isles, where the night fighters of the Royal Air Force (RAF) typically struggled to intercept it. The Me 410 was also used as a bomber destroyer against the daylight bomber formations of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF); it was moderately successful against unescorted bombers through 1943, but proved to be no match in a dogfight with the lighter Allied single-engine fighters, such as the North American P-51 Mustang and Supermarine Spitfire. Following the Normandy landings, Me 410s were amongst the numerous Axis aircraft sent against the incoming Allied forces.

From mid-1944, all Me 410s were withdrawn from Defence of the Reich duties and production was phased out in favour of heavily armed single-engine fighters as dedicated bomber destroyers. The final role of the Me 410 was aerial reconnaissance. Only two Me 410s have survived in preservation into the twenty-first century.

== Design and development ==
===Background===

The origins of the Me 410 are closely associated with the preceding Me 210. Development of this aircraft had been projected back in 1937 as a multi-purpose successor to the Bf 110, which had some identified shortcomings even prior to seeing combat service. Early on, confidence in the Me 210 had been high, to the extent that 1,000 aircraft were ordered off the drawing board; however, it would be a troubled programme. Flight testing revealed poor longitudinal stability and, despite modifications, was considered to be unsatisfactory. While quantity production of the type proceeded, the Me 210 had a relatively high rate of accidents. This heavily contributed to production being halted on 14 April 1942; officials were keen to remedy the Me 210&#x27;s problems and return it to production to minimise the economic loss incurred.

Various modifications to the design were explored, including the Me 310, a radical high-altitude derivative that incorporated a pressurised cockpit and more powerful engines. This option was not favoured by many officials, who sought a less ambitious remediation of the Me 210. It was this preference that led to the emergence of the Me 410, which was visually almost identical to that of the Me 210.

===Design===
The principal difference between the Me 210 and Me 410 was the adoption of the larger (at displacement) and more powerful Daimler-Benz DB 603A engines. These engines each provided compared to the of the DB 605s used on the Me 210C. The extra power increased the Me 410&#x27;s maximum speed to , greatly improved rate of climb, service ceiling, and the cruising speed, the latter being raised to .

The more powerful engines also improved payload capability to the point where the aircraft could lift a war-load greater than could fit into the bomb bay under the nose. Consequently, shackles were added under the wings for four bombs. The changes added an extra to the Me 210 design, but the extra engine power more than made up for the difference. As with the Me 210, the Me 410&#x27;s rear gunner used the same pair of &quot;Ferngerichtete Drehringseitenlafette&quot; FDSL 131/1B turrets mounted on each side of the aircraft, each still armed with a 13 mm (.51 in) MG 131 machine gun, retaining the same pivoting handgun-style grip, trigger and gunsight to aim and fire the ordnance as the Me 210 did.

The new version included a lengthened fuselage and new, automatic leading edge slats. Both features had been tested on Me 210s and were found to dramatically improve handling. The slats had originally been featured on the earliest Me 210 models, but had been removed on production models due to poor handling. When entering a steep turn, the slats had a tendency to open due to the high angle of attack, analogous to the opening of the slats during the landing approach. (This problem was first observed on the Bf 109V14 and V15 prototypes for the Bf 109E), which added to the difficulty in keeping the aircraft flying smoothly. However, when the problems with the general lateral instability were addressed, this was no longer a real problem. While the Me 410 came to be regarded as a relatively stable aircraft, it had a poorer rate of turn than the Bf 110 it was intended to replace.

The wing panels of the earlier Me 210 had been designed with a planform geometry that placed the aerodynamic center farther back compared with the earlier Bf 110, giving the outer sections of the wing planform beyond each engine nacelle a slightly greater, 12.6° leading edge sweepback angle than the inner panels&#x27; 6.0° leading edge sweep angle. This resulted in unsuitable handling characteristics in flight for the original Me 210 design. The new Me 410 outer wing panels had their planform geometry revised to bring the aerodynamic centre farther forward in comparison with the Me 210, thus making the leading edge sweepback of the outer panels identical to the inner wing panels with both having identical 5.5° sweepback angles, which improved handling.

===Into flight===
During late 1942, six Me 210As were taken off the assembly line for conversion to Me 410 standard. Near the end of that year, the Me 410 V1 prototype performed its maiden flight. Shortly thereafter, the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (RLM) was suitably convinced by its performance to place a sizable production order for the Me 410.
Deliveries of the Me 410 began in January 1943, two years late and continued until September 1944, by which point a total of 1,160 of all versions had been produced by Messerschmitt&#x27;s facility in Augsburg and Dornier plant in München. There were various models produced to serve in distinct roles, including the Me 410A-1 light bomber, the A-1/U1 aerial reconnaissance platform, the A-1/U2 bomber destroyer, the A-2/U4 night fighter. When the Me 410 arrived, it was typically appreciated by its crews, even though its improved performance was not enough to protect it from the waves of high performance Allied fighters that it routinely confronted at this stage of the conflict.

== Operational history ==

When performing night bomber missions against the British Isles, the Me 410A-1 proved to be an elusive target for the opposing night fighters of the Royal Air Force (RAF). The first unit to operate over the UK was V./KG 2, which lost its first Me 410 on the night of 13 – 14 July 1943, when it was shot down by a de Havilland Mosquito of No. 85 Squadron. Nevertheless, the Me 410 played a prominent role in the bombing of London during early 1944.

The Me 410 was also used as a bomber destroyer against the daylight bomber formations of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), upgraded with &quot;Umrüst-Bausätze&quot; factory conversion kits, all bearing a /U suffix, for the design—these suffixes could vary in meaning between subtypes. As one example, the earlier Me 410 A-1/U1 designation signified a camera-fitting in the under-nose ordnance bay for reconnaissance use (as the A-3 was meant to do from its start), while the Me 410 B-2/U1 designation signified a mount of a pair of the long barreled, 30 mm MK 103 cannon in the undernose ordnance bay. The /U2 suffix designated a fitment of two additional 20 mm MG 151/20 cannons in the under-nose ordnance bay instead—the A-1/U4 subtype fitted the massive, &quot;Bordkanone&quot; series 50 mm (2 in) BK 5 cannon, loaded with 21 rounds in the same under-nose ordnance bay in place of either the /U1&#x27;s cameras or MK 103s, or the /U2&#x27;s added pair of MG 151/20 autocannon. For breaking up the bomber formations, many Me 410s also had four underwing tubular launchers, two per wing panel, firing converted 21 cm (8 in) &quot;Werfer-Granate&quot; 21 infantry barrage rockets. Two &quot;Geschwader&quot;, &quot;Zerstörergeschwader&quot; 26 and 76, were thus equipped with the Me 410 by late 1943.

The type was moderately successful against unescorted bombers through 1943, achieving a considerable number of kills against USAAF day bomber formations. However, the Me 410 proved to be no match in a dogfight with the lighter Allied single-engine fighters such as the North American P-51 Mustang and Supermarine Spitfire. In early 1944, the Me 410 formations encountered swarms of Allied fighters protecting the bomber streams, usually flying far ahead of the combat box formations as an air supremacy move in clearing the skies of any Luftwaffe opposition, resulting in the Me 410&#x27;s previous successes against escorted bombers now often being offset by their losses. An example of this—as part of a campaign started two days earlier by the USAAF—was on 6 March 1944 during an attack on Berlin by 750 8th AF heavy bombers, when 16 Me 410s were shot down in return for eight B-17 Flying Fortresses and four P-51s (which were destroyed by Bf 109 and Fw 190 fighters escorting the Me 410s). The following month on 11 April, with 8th AF raids hitting Sorau, Rostock and Oschersleben, II./ZG 26&#x27;s Me 410s accounted for a rare clear success, initially bringing down 10 B-17s without any losses. During the course of the same raid, their second sortie was intercepted by P-51s that destroyed eight Me 410s and three Bf 110s. Sixteen crewmen were killed and three wounded.

During April 1944, the first Me 410Bs were delivered. Units commonly converted to the type from bomber aircraft, such as the Junkers Ju 88. In response to the Normandy landings, Me 410s were repeatedly dispatched against the incoming Allied forces.

From mid-1944, despite being known to be the favourite bomber destroyer of Adolf Hitler, the Me 410 units were taken from Defence of the Reich duties and production was phased out in favour of heavily armed single-engine fighters as dedicated bomber destroyers, with the Me 410s remaining in service flying on reconnaissance duties only.

== Variants ==

A-series aircraft were armed with two 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17 machine guns and two 20 mm MG 151/20 cannons in the nose and delivered as the Me 410 A-1 light bomber. The Me 410 A-2 heavy fighter was cancelled because the dual 30 mm (1.18 in) MK 103 cannon mount, also available for the later Me 410 B-2 subtype as the &quot;Umrüst-Bausatz&quot; /U1 factory kit available by 1944, was not ready in time.

The Me 410 A featured a bomb bay for carrying bombs. Though by fitting conversion kits, this could be used for other equipment. Initially, three &quot;Umrüst-Bausätze&quot; (factory conversion kits) were available: the U1 which contained cameras for photo-reconnaissance, the U2 with two 20 mm MG 151/20 cannon with 250 rounds-per-gun for the heavy fighter. And the U4 with a 50 mm (2 in) &quot;Bordkanone&quot;, BK-5 cannon with 22 rounds (21 rounds to load and 1 extra round in the breech). The purpose of this was to convert either an Me 410 A or B-series aircraft into a bomber destroyer.

The BK 5 cannon – derived from the 50 mm (2 in) KwK 39 L/60 of the Panzer III tank – allowed Me 410s to shoot at their targets from over 914 m (1,000 yd), a distance far greater than the range of the bombers&#x27; defensive machine-guns. However, in practice frequent problems with jamming, the limited ammunition supply and with the extra weight of the large-calibre gun under the nose made the other anti-bomber versions of Me 410, especially those with extra 20 mm MG 151/20s, much more useful.

The reconnaissance version Me 410 A-3 received a deeper fuselage for additional cameras and fuel. The Me 410 A-3 entered service in small numbers in early 1944 and equipped three long-range reconnaissance squadrons, usually grouped larger, three or four-squadron (one &quot;Gruppe&quot; on the Western Front and the other two on the Eastern Front).
The Me 410 B-series was similar to the A-series but replaced the pair of 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17s with 13 mm (.51 in) MG 131 machine guns. The originally planned 1,900 hp (1,400 kW) DB 603G engine had been cancelled in early 1944, so all Me 410 Bs used DB 603A or DB 603AA engines. The DB 603G would have increased the maximum speed to and cruising speed to , although the weight increased once again. The versions were the same as with the A-series, the Me 410 B-1 and Me 410 B-3 filling the same roles as the earlier A-1 and A-3 versions, also with the option of using the same &quot;Umrüst-Bausätze&quot; factory conversion kits as the A-series.

Several experimental models were also developed. The Me 410 B-5 added shackles under the fuselage to carry a torpedo, and removed the MG 131s in the nose to make room for the FuG 200 &quot;Hohentwiel&quot; 550 MHz UHF-band maritime patrol radar. The bomb bay was not used in this version in order to make room for a fuel tank, and the rearward-firing remote turrets were replaced by another fuel tank for long-range missions. The Me 410 B-6 was a similar anti-shipping conversion, but intended for the short-range coastal defence role only. For this mission, it did not use a torpedo, and was instead a simple modification of the B-1 with the FuG 200 radar. The Me 410 B-7/B-8 were updated B-3 reconnaissance models that were never actually built.

The Me 410 C was a high-altitude version drawn up in early 1944, with two new wing designs that increased span to . The larger wings allowed the gear to retract directly to the rear. A new universal engine mount would allow for the use of any of the DB 603JZ or BMW 801J turbocharged engines or the Jumo 213E two-stage mechanically supercharged engines, driving a new four-blade propeller with very wide blades. The BMW 801 radials were air-cooled and the DB 603 and Jumo 213 used an annular radiator, all &quot;Kraftei&quot; (power-egg) engine &quot;modules&quot; onto an airframe for ease of installation and field maintenance, so the normal under-wing radiators were removed. None were ever built, as Me 410 production was cancelled before the engines matured.

The Me 410 D was a simpler upgrade to the B-series to improve altitude performance than the C-series. It would be powered by the DB 603JZ engines, and had a revised forward fuselage to increase the field of view of the pilot and reduce drag. It also replaced portions of the outer wing panels with ones made of wood to conserve strategic materials. Several were built, but like many other attempts at wood construction by the German aviation industry late in World War II, the loss of the Goldschmitt Tego film factory in Wuppertal, in a Royal Air Force night bombing raid, meant the acidic replacement adhesives available were too corrosive to the materials being bonded, and the wooden portions tended to fail. Production was eventually cancelled to concentrate on Bf 109Gs in August 1944, after 1,160 Me 410s had been built, the month after the &quot;Jägernotprogramm&quot; had gone into effect.

== Surviving aircraft ==

Two Me 410s survive:

; Me 410 A-1/U1 (W.Nr.10018, converted from Me 210 airframe)
: This aircraft held by the American National Air and Space Museum and stored awaiting restoration, at the Paul E. Garber Preservation, Restoration, and Storage Facility, located in Suitland Maryland. It was found intact at an airfield in Trapani, Sicily, in August 1943 bearing the markings of the Luftwaffe&#x27;s 2.&quot;Staffel&quot;/&quot;Fernaufklärungsgruppe&quot; 122 and was shipped to the United States in 1944; it was given the US serial number &quot;FE499&quot;,

; Me 410 A-1/U2 (W.Nr.420430)
: This aircraft is part of the collection of the RAF Museum and is publicly displayed at the Royal Air Force Museum Cosford. It was built in late 1943 by Messerschmitt in Augsburg. There is evidence it served with Zerstörergeschwader 26 before being surrendered at Vaerlose, Denmark in May 1945. It was one of six Me 410s that were taken to the UK in 1945 for evaluation, but the only one to be later selected for preservation and to avoid being scrapped. It underwent restoration in 1986, after which both engines were successfully run on the ground. It was moved to Cosford in 1989 and has remained there since.

<text>The 1930 British Empire Games were the inaugural edition of what is now known as the Commonwealth Games, and was held in Hamilton, Ontario, from 16 to 23 August 1930.

The event was organized by &quot;Hamilton Spectator&quot; sportswriter Bobby Robinson after he attended the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam as manager of the Canadian track and field team and was inspired to create a similar event for the British Empire. After campaigning for the idea among contacts he met at the Olympics, he was asked to organise the first British Empire Games in Hamilton. Fellow Hamilton journalist Ivan Miller helped with the organizing committee.

The sports included athletics, boxing, lawn bowls, rowing, swimming, and wrestling. Women competed only in aquatic events. The opening ceremony and many events were held at Civic Stadium (later renamed Ivor Wynne Stadium) in east Hamilton.

The event was opened by the Governor General of Canada, Lord Willingdon, on 16 August. Canadian triple jumper Gordon Smallacombe claimed the debut gold medal a few hours later.

The 1930 British Empire Games made use of pedestals for dignitaries to present medals to winning athletes, as proposed by Bobby Robinson. This inspired the Olympic medal podium ceremonies which began at the 1932 Winter Olympics.

<doc id="177521" wikidata="Q314467" url="?curid=177521" title="Aenesidemus">
<text>Aenesidemus ( or Αἰνεσίδημος) was a 1st-century BC Greek Pyrrhonist philosopher from Knossos who revived the doctrines of Pyrrho and introduced ten skeptical &quot;modes&quot; (&quot;tropai&quot;) for the suspension of judgment. He broke with the Academic Skepticism that was predominant in his time, synthesizing the teachings of Heraclitus and Timon of Phlius with philosophical skepticism. Although his primary work, the &quot;Pyrrhonian Discourses&quot;, has been lost, an outline of the work survives from the later Byzantine empire, and the description of the modes has been preserved by a few ancient sources.

== Life ==
There is no definitive evidence about the life of Aenesidemus. What little we know is from a description of his &quot;Pyrrhonian Discourses&quot; in the &quot;Myriobiblion&quot; of Photius from the 9th century, as well as a few mentions in the works of Sextus Empiricus, and to a lesser extent by Diogenes Laërtius.

Whether Aenesidemus re-founded the Pyrrhonist school or merely revitalized it is unknown: while Diogenes claims an unbroken lineage of teachers of Pyrrhonism from Pyrrho through Sextus, with Aenesidemus&#x27; teacher being Heraclides of Tarentum, little is known about several of the names between Timon of Phlius and Aenesidemus, so this lineage is suspect. Photius says that Aenesidemus dedicated his &quot;Pyrrhonian Discourses&quot; to Lucius Aelius Tubero, a friend of Cicero and member of the academy, whom Photius described as a colleague of Aenesidemus. Based on this information, scholars have assumed that Aenesidemus himself was also a member of the academy. Furthermore, it has been assumed that he took part under the leadership of Philo of Larissa and probably adopted Pyrrhonism either in reaction to Antiochus of Ascalon&#x27;s Middle Platonist introduction of Stoic and Peripatetic dogma into the Academy, or Philo&#x27;s acceptance of provisional beliefs.

== Philosophy ==
Aenesidemus&#x27; philosophy consisted of four main parts, the reasons for scepticism and doubt, the attack on causality and truth, a physical theory, and a theory of morality. Having disposed of the ideas of truth and causality, he undermines the ethical criterion, and denies that any one can aim at Good, Pleasure or Happiness as an absolute, concrete ideal, but that all actions are product of pleasure and pain, good and evil.

=== The ten modes of Aenesidemus ===
The reasons for doubt are given in the form of the ten &quot;tropes&quot; (also known as ten modes of Aenesidemus or ten tropes of Aenesidemus) that represent reasons for &quot;epoché&quot; (suspension of judgment). :

*(1) different animals manifest different impressions; 
*(2) similar differences are seen among individual people; 
*(3) even for the same person, sense-given data are self-contradictory, 
*(4) sense data vary from time to time with physical changes, and 
*(5) sense-data vary according to local relations; 
*(6) and (7) objects are known only indirectly through the medium of air, moisture, &amp;c., and are in a condition of perpetual change in colour, temperature, size and motion; 
*(8) all perceptions are relative and interact one upon another; 
*(9) Our impressions become less deep by repetition and custom; and 
*(10) all people are brought up with different beliefs, under different laws and social conditions.

Aenesidemus argues that truth varies infinitely under circumstances whose relative weight cannot be accurately gauged. There is, therefore, no absolute knowledge, for everyone has different perceptions, and, further, arranges and groups data in methods peculiar to themselves; so that the sum total is a quantity with a purely subjective validity.

=== Attack on causality ===

The second part of his work consists in the attack upon the theory of causality, in which he adduces almost entirely those considerations which are the basis of modern scepticism. Cause has no existence apart from the mind which perceives; its validity is ideal, or, as Kant would have said, subjective. The relation between cause and effect is unthinkable. If the two things are different, they are either simultaneous or in succession. If simultaneous, cause is effect and effect cause. If not, since effect cannot precede cause, cause must precede effect, and there must be an instant when cause is not effective, that is, is not itself. By these and similar arguments he arrives at the fundamental principle of Scepticism, the radical and universal opposition of causes; παντὶ λόγῳ λόγος ἀντίκειται.

=== Heraclitean view ===
According to Sextus Empiricus, Aenesidemus either assimilated the theories of Heraclitus, or gave an account of them, stating that Aenesidemus was able to assert the co-existence of contrary qualities in the same object by admitting that contraries co-exist for the perceiving subject. John Burnet discusses the question of Sextus Empiricus&#x27; ambiguous reproduction of Aenesidemus account of the theories of Heraclitus:

&quot;Sextus quotes &quot;Ainesidemos according to Herakleitos.&quot; Natorp holds (&quot;Forschungen&quot;, p. 78) that Ainesidemos really did combine Herakleiteanism with Scepticism. Diels (&quot;Dox&quot;. pp. 210, 211), insists that he only gave an account of the theories of Herakleitos. The locus classicus on this is a passage of Sextus Empiricus, which reproduces the account given by Ainesidemos. It is as follows (Ritter and Preller (1898) &quot;Historia Philosophiae Graecae&quot; section 41):

&quot;The natural philosopher is of opinion that what surrounds us is rational and endowed with consciousness. According to Herakleitos, when we draw in this divine reason by means of respiration, we become rational. In sleep we forget, but at our waking we become conscious once more. For in sleep, when the openings of the senses close, the mind which is in us is cut off from contact with that which surrounds us, and only our connexion with it by means of respiration is preserved as a sort of root (from which the rest may spring again); and, when it is thus separated, it loses the power of memory that it had before. When we awake again, however, it looks out through the openings of the senses, as if through windows, and coming together with the surrounding mind, it assumes the power of reason. Just, then, as embers, when they are brought near the fire, change and become red-hot, and go out when they are taken away from it again, so does the portion of the surrounding mind which sojourns in our body become irrational when it is cut off, and so does it become of like nature to the whole when contact is established through the greatest number of openings.&quot;

In this passage there is clearly a large admixture of later ideas. In particular, the identification of &quot;that which surrounds us&quot; with the air cannot be Herakleitean; for Herakleitos knew nothing of air except as a form of water (§ 27). The reference to the pores or openings of the senses is probably foreign to him also; for the theory of pores is due to Alkmaion (§ 96). Lastly, the distinction between mind and body is far too sharply drawn. On the other hand, the important role assigned to respiration may very well be Herakleitean; for we have met with it already in Anaximenes. And we can hardly doubt that the striking simile of the embers which glow when brought near the fire is genuine (cf. fr. 77). The true doctrine doubtless was, that sleep was produced by the encroachment of moist, dark exhalations from the water in the body, which cause the fire to burn low. In sleep, we lose contact with the fire in the world which is common to all, and retire to a world of our own (fr. 95). In a soul where the fire and water are evenly balanced, the equilibrium is restored in the morning by an equal advance of the bright exhalation.&quot;

== &quot;Pyrrhonian Discourses&quot; ==
His chief work, the &quot;Pyrrhonian Discourses&quot; () dealt primarily with man&#x27;s need to suspend judgment due to our epistemological limitations. Although it has not survived, we have a summary of its contents from Photius (in his &quot;Myriobiblion&quot;). The work, which was divided into eight books, detailed Pyrrhonist philosophy, described the differences between the Pyrrhonists and the Academic Skeptics, and set out ten &quot;tropes&quot;, or &quot;modes&quot; for producing suspension of judgment.

== Legacy ==
Philo of Alexandria outlined the modes in his work &quot;On Drunkenness.&quot;

In the 18th century, Gottlob Ernst Schulze wrote a book named after Aenesidemus in which he criticizes the defense of Immanuel Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; made by Karl Leonhard Reinhold. The book is a fictionalized dialogue between Aenesidemus and &quot;Hermias&quot;, an adherent of Kantianism.

<doc id="177526" wikidata="Q60749" url="?curid=177526" title="Ferdinand Christian Baur">
<text>Ferdinand Christian Baur (21 June 1792 – 2 December 1860) was a German Protestant theologian and founder and leader of the (new) Tübingen School of theology (named for the University of Tübingen where Baur studied and taught). Following Hegel&#x27;s theory of dialectic, Baur argued that second century Christianity represented the synthesis of two opposing theses: Jewish Christianity (Petrine Christianity) and Gentile Christianity (Pauline Christianity). This and the rest of Baur&#x27;s work had a profound impact upon higher criticism of biblical and related texts.

Adolf Hilgenfeld followed Baur&#x27;s lead and edited the Tübingen School&#x27;s journal, though he was less radical than Baur. A patristic scholar and philosopher at Tübingen, Albert Schwegler, gave the School&#x27;s theories their most vigorous expression. The School&#x27;s influence peaked in the 1840s, but was waning by the early twentieth century.

Baur&#x27;s views were radical, but &quot;one thing is certain: New Testament study, since his time, has had a different colour&quot; (H.S. Nash). He had a number of followers, who in many cases modified his positions, and the groundwork laid by Baur continues to be built upon in the twenty-first century.

==Early years==
Baur was born at Schmiden, near Cannstatt. After training at the theological seminary of Blaubeuren, he went in 1809 to the University of Tübingen. Here he studied for a time under Ernst Bengel, grandson of the eminent New Testament critic, Johann Albrecht Bengel, and at this early stage in his career he seems to have been under the influence of the old Tübingen School. But at the same time the philosophers Johann Gottlieb Fichte and Friedrich Schelling were creating a wide and deep impression. In 1817 Baur returned to the theological seminary at Blaubeuren as professor. This move marked a turning-point in his life, for he now set to work on the investigations on which his reputation rests. He had already, in 1817, written a review of G. Kaiser&#x27;s &quot;Biblische Theologie&quot; for Bengel&#x27;s &quot;Archiv für Theologie&quot; (ii. 656); its tone was moderate and conservative.

==Early works==
When, a few years after his appointment at Blaubeuren, he published his first important work, &quot;Symbolik und Mythologie oder die Naturreligion des Altertums&quot; (&quot;Symbol and mythology: the natural religion of Antiquity&quot;, 1824–1825), it became evident that he had made a deeper study of philosophy, and had come under the influence of Schelling and more particularly of Friedrich Schleiermacher. The learning of the work was fully recognized, and in 1826 the author was called to Tübingen as professor of theology. It is with Tübingen that his greatest literary achievements are associated. His earlier publications here treated of mythology and the history of dogma. &quot;Das manichäische Religionssystem&quot; (&quot;The Manichaean religious system&quot;) appeared in 1831, &quot;Apollonius von Tyana&quot; in 1832, &quot;Die christliche Gnosis&quot; (&quot;Christian Gnosis&quot;) in 1835, and &quot;Über das Christliche im Platonismus oder Socrates und Christus&quot; (&quot;On Christianity in Platonism: Socrates and Christ&quot;) in 1837. As Otto Pfleiderer (Pflederer 1890 p. 285) observes, &quot;the choice not less than the treatment of these subjects is indicative of the large breadth of view and the insight of the historian into the comparative history of religion.&quot;

==Simon Magus and Paul==

Baur rested his ideas about the New Testament on the Clementines, and his ideas about the Clementines on St. Epiphanius, who found the writings used by an Ebionite sect in the 4th century. This Judeo-Christian sect at that date rejected St. Paul as an apostate. It was assumed that this 4th century opinion represented the Christianity of the Twelve Apostles; Paulinism was originally a heresy, and a schism from the Jewish Christianity of James and Peter and the rest; Marcion was a leader of the Pauline sect in its survival in the 2nd century, using only the Pauline Gospel, St. Luke (in its original form), and the Epistles of St. Paul (without the Pastoral Epistles). The Clementine literature had its first origin in the Apostolic Age, and belonged to the original Jewish, Petrine, legal Church. It is directed wholly against St. Paul and his sect. Simon Magus never existed; it is a nickname for St. Paul. The Acts of the Apostles, compiled in the 2nd century, have borrowed their mention of Simon from the earliest form of the Clementines. Catholicism under the presidency of Rome was the result of the adjustment between the Petrine and Pauline sections of the Church in the second half of the 2nd century. The Fourth Gospel is a monument of this reconciliation, in which Rome took a leading part, having invented the fiction that both Peter and Paul were the founders of her Church, both having been martyred at Rome, and on the same day, in perfect union.

Throughout the middle of the 19th century this theory, in many forms, was dominant in Germany. The demonstration, mainly by English scholars, of the impossibility of the late dates ascribed to the New Testament documents (four Epistles of St. Paul and the Apocalypse were the only documents generally admitted as being of early date), and the proofs of the authenticity of the Apostolic Fathers and of the use of St. John&#x27;s Gospel by Justin, Papias, and Ignatius, gradually brought Baur&#x27;s theories into discredit. Of the original school, Adolf Hilgenfeld may be considered the last survivor (died 1907). He was induced to admit that Simon Magus was a real personage, though he persisted that in the Clementines he is meant for St. Paul. In 1847 Hilgenfeld dated the original nucleus of the Clementine literature (Kerygmata Petrou) soon after the Jewish war of 70; successive revisions of it were anti-Basilidian, anti-Valentinian, and anti-Marcionite respectively. Baur placed the completed form, ‘‘H’’, soon after the middle of the 2nd century, and Schliemann (1844) agreed, placing ‘‘R’’, as a revision, between 211 and 230. Other writers dated both ‘‘H’’ and ‘‘R’’ to between the 2nd and 4th centuries:

* R. 2nd century: Sixtus Senensis (Sixtus of Siena) (1520-1569), David Blondel (David Blondellus Catalaunensis) (1590-1655), Jean-Baptiste Cotelier (1629-1686), William Cave (1637-1713), Casimir Oudin (1638-1717), Noël Alexandre (Natalis Alexander) (1639-1724), Denis-Nicolas Le Nourry (Nourri) (1647-1724), Johann Georg Heinsius (d. 1733), Ernst Friedrich Karl Rosenmüller (1768-1835), Christian Wilhelm Flügge (1773-1828), Karl Gottlieb Bretschneider (1776-1848), Johann Georg Veit Engelhardt (1791-1855), Johann Karl Ludwig Gieseler (1792-1854), Friedrich August Gottreu Tholuck (1799-1877), and August Friedrich Gfrörer (1803-1861).
* R. 2nd or 3rd century: Schröck, Stark, Lumper, Krabbe, Locherer, Gersdorf.
* R. 3rd century: Strunzius (on Bardesanes, 1710), Weismann (17l8), Mosheim, Kleuker, Schmidt (Kirchengesch.)
* R. 4th century: Corrodi, Lentz (Dogmengesch.).
* H. 2nd century (beginning): Credner, Bretschneider, Kern, Rothe.
* H. 2nd century: Clericus, Beausobre, Flügge, Münscher, Hoffmann, Döllinger, Hilgers; (middle of 2nd) Hase.
* H. end of 2nd century: Schröck, Cölln, Gieseler (3rd ed.), Schenkel, Gfrörer, Lücke.
* H. 3rd century: Mill, Mosheim, Gallandi, Gieseler (2nd ed.).
* H. 2nd or 3rd century: Neander, Krabbe, Baur, Ritter, Paniel, Dähne.
* H. 4th century: Lentz.

==Hegel&#x27;s influence==
Meantime Baur had exchanged one master in philosophy for another, Schleiermacher for Hegel. In doing so, he had adopted completely the Hegelian philosophy of history. &quot;Without philosophy,&quot; he has said, &quot;history is always for me dead and dumb.&quot; The change of view is illustrated clearly in the essay, published in the &quot;Tübinger Zeitschrift&quot; for 1831, on the Christ-party in the Corinthian Church, &quot;Die Christuspartei in der korinthischen Gemeinde, der Gegensatz des paulinischen und petrinischen Christentums in der ältesten Kirche, der Apostel Petrus in Rom&quot;, the trend of which is suggested by the title (in English, &#x27;The Christ Party in the Corinthian Community, the Opposition of Pauline and Petrine Christianity in the earliest Church, the apostle Peter in Rome&#x27;). Baur contends that the apostle Paul was opposed in Corinth by a Jewish Christian party that wished to set up its own form of Christian religion instead of his universal Christianity. He found traces of a keen conflict of parties in the post-apostolic age, which have passed into the mainstream of Early Christian historiography.

==Pauline epistles==
The theory is further developed in a later work (1835, the year in which David Strauss&#x27; &quot;Leben Jesu&quot; was published), &quot;Über die sogenannten Pastoralbriefe&quot;. In this Baur attempts to prove that the false teachers mentioned in the Second Epistle to Timothy and Epistle to Titus are the Gnostics, particularly the Marcionites, of the 2nd century, and consequently that the Pastoral Epistles were produced in the middle of the 2nd century in opposition to Gnosticism.

He next proceeded to investigate other Pauline epistles and the &quot;Acts of the Apostles&quot; in the same manner, publishing his results in 1845 under the title &quot;Paulus, der Apostel Jesu Christi, sein Leben und Wirken, seine Briefe und seine Lehre&quot;. In this he contends that only the Epistle to the Galatians, First and Second Epistle to the Corinthians and Epistle to the Romans are genuinely Pauline, and that the Paul of the Acts of the Apostles is a different person from the Paul of these genuine Epistles, the author being a Paulinist who, with an eye to the different parties in the Church, is at pains to represent Peter as far as possible as a Paulinist and Paul as far as possible as a Petrinist.

==Early Christian conflicts==

Baur was prepared to apply his theory to the whole of the New Testament; in the words of H. S. Nash, &quot;he carried a sweeping hypothesis into the examination of the New Testament.&quot; He considers those writings alone genuine in which the conflict between Jewish-Christians and Gentile-Christians is clearly marked. In his &quot;Kritische Untersuchungen über die kanonischen Evangelien, ihr Verhältniss zu einander, ihren Charakter und Ursprung&quot; (1847) he turns his attention to the Gospels, and here again finds that the authors were conscious of the conflict of parties; the Gospels reveal a mediating or conciliatory tendency (&quot;Tendenz&quot;) on the part of the writers or redactors. The Gospels, in fact, are adaptations or redactions of an older Gospel, such as the Gospel of the Hebrews, of Peter, of the Egyptians, or of the Ebionites. The Petrine Matthew bears the closest relationship to this original Gospel (&quot;Urevangelium&quot;); the Pauline Luke is later and arose independently; Mark represents a still later development according to Baur; the account in John is idealistic: it &quot;does not possess historical truth, and cannot and does not really lay claim to it.&quot;

Baur&#x27;s theory starts with the supposition that Christianity was gradually developed out of Judaism, see also List of events in early Christianity. Before it could become a universal religion, it had to struggle with Jewish limitations and to overcome them. The early Christians were Jewish-Christians, to whom Jesus was the Messiah. Paul, on the other hand, represented a breach with Judaism, the Temple, and the Law. Thus there was some antagonism between the Jewish apostles Peter, James and John, and Paul the &quot;Apostle to the Gentiles&quot;, and this struggle continued down to the middle of the 2nd century. In short, the conflict between Petrinism and Paulinism is, as Karl Schwarz puts it, the key to the literature of the 1st and 2nd centuries.

==Theology==
Baur was a theologian and historian as well as a Biblical critic. As early as 1834 he published a strictly theological work, &quot;Gegensatz des Katholicismus und Protestantismus nach den Prinzipien und Hauptdogmen der beiden Lehrbegriffe&quot;, a strong defence of Protestantism on the lines of Schleiermacher&#x27;s &quot;Glaubenslehre&quot;, and a vigorous reply to J. Möhler&#x27;s &quot;Symbolik&quot; (1833). This was followed by his larger histories of dogma, &quot;Die christliche Lehre von der Versöhnung in ihrer geschichtlichen Entwicklung bis auf die neueste Zeit&quot; (1838), &quot;Die christliche Lehre von der Dreieinigkeit und Menschwerdung Gottes in ihrer geschichtlichen Entwicklung&quot; (3 vols., 1841–1843), and the &quot;Lehrbuch der christlichen Dogmengeschichte&quot; (1847). The value of these works is impaired somewhat by Baur&#x27;s habit of making the history of dogma conform to the formulae of Hegel&#x27;s philosophy, a procedure &quot;which only served to obscure the truth and profundity of his conception of history as a true development of the human mind&quot; (Pfleiderer). Baur, however, soon came to attach more importance to personality, and to distinguish more carefully between religion and philosophy.
The change is noticeable in his &quot;Epochen der kirchlichen Geschichtschreibung&quot; (1852), &quot;Das Christenthum und die christliche Kirche der drei ersten Jahrhunderte&quot; (1853), and &quot;Die christliche Kirche von Anfang des vierten bis zum Ende das sechsten Jahrhunderts&quot; (1859), works preparatory to his &quot;Kirchengeschichte&quot;, in which the change of view is specially pronounced.

==Death and posthumous publication==
Baur died, aged 68, in Tübingen. The &quot;Kirchengeschichte&quot; was published in five volumes during the years 1853-1863, partly by Baur himself, partly by his son, Ferdinand Baur, and his son-in-law, Eduard Zeller, from notes and lectures which the author left behind him. Pfleiderer describes this work, especially the first volume, as a classic for all time. &quot;Taken as a whole, it is the first thorough and satisfactory attempt to explain the rise of Christianity and the Church on strictly historical lines, i.e. as a natural development of the religious spirit of our race under the combined operation of various human causes&quot; (&quot;Development of Theology&quot;, p. 288). Baur&#x27;s lectures on the history of dogma, &quot;Ausführlichere Vorlesungen uber die christliche Dogmengeschichte&quot;, were published later by his son (1865–1868).

==Tübingen School==
The Tübingen School was at the height of its influence in the 1840s, but lost ground to later historical analysis. Since Adolf von Harnack proposed very early dates for the synoptics and Acts (c. 1910), the Tübingen School has been generally abandoned.

<text>The Heinkel He 112 is a German fighter aircraft designed by Walter and Siegfried Günter. It was one of four aircraft designed to compete for the 1933 fighter contract of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, in which it came second behind the Messerschmitt Bf 109. Small numbers were used for a short time by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; and some were built for other countries, with around 100 being completed.

==Design and development==
In the early 1930s, the German authorities started placing orders for new aircraft, initially training and utility aircraft. Heinkel, as one of the most experienced firms in the country, received contracts for a number of two-seat aircraft, including the He 45, He 46, and He 50. The company also worked on single-seat fighter designs, which culminated in the He 49 and later with the improved He 51.

When the He 51 was tested in combat in the Spanish Civil War, it was shown that speed was far more important than maneuverability. The Luftwaffe took this lesson to heart and started a series of design projects for much more modern aircraft.

In October 1933, Hermann Göring sent out a letter requesting aircraft companies consider the design of a &quot;high-speed courier aircraft&quot; – a thinly veiled request for a new fighter. Each company was asked to build three prototypes for run-off testing. By spring 1935, both the Arado and Focke-Wulf aircraft were ready, the BFW arriving in March, and the He 112 in April.

In early May 1934, despite Germany being under a prohibition from the development of new military aircraft, the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM) issued a request for a new single-seat monoplane fighter under the guise that the proposal was for creating a new &#x27;sports plane&#x27;. The Technisches Amt outlined specifications, for the supply of a new fighter aircraft, those submissions for the competition had to meet certain characteristics, including; a) having an all-metal construction, b) having a monoplane configuration, c) having retractable landing gear, d) be capable of achieving a top speed of at least at an altitude of , e) endure ninety minutes at full throttle at f) reach an altitude of in seven minutes and have a service ceiling of g) be able to be fitted with a Junkers Jumo 210 engine h) be armed with either two 7.92mm fixed machine guns or one 20mm cannon and i) have a wing loading of less than 100 kg/m2.

In February 1934 three companies, Arado, Bayerische Flugzeugwerke (BFW), and Heinkel were awarded contracts to develop prototypes for the competition, with a fourth company, Focke-Wulf, being awarded the contract more than six months later in September 1934. The prototypes that were eventually submitted for the competition were the Arado Ar 80, Focke-Wulf Fw 159, Heinkel He 112, and Messerschmitt Bf 109. Heinkel had begun development of its submission in late 1933 in anticipation of the announcement. At the helm of its design project were the Günter brothers, Siegfried and Walter, designers of the He 111, who were then working on the design for the He 112. The first prototype had its first flight in September 1935.

===Heinkel&#x27;s design===

Heinkel&#x27;s design was created primarily by twin brothers Walter and Siegfried Günter, whose designs would dominate most of Heinkel&#x27;s work. They started work on &quot;Projekt&quot; 1015 in late 1933 under the guise of the original courier aircraft, based around the BMW XV inline engine. Work was already underway when the official request went out on 2 May, and on 5 May the design was renamed the He 112.

The primary source of inspiration for the He 112 was their earlier He 70 &quot;Blitz&quot; (&quot;Lightning&quot;) design. The &quot;Blitz&quot; was a single-engine, four-passenger aircraft originally designed for use by Lufthansa, and it, in turn, was inspired by the famous Lockheed Model 9 Orion mail plane. Like many civilian designs of the time, the aircraft was pressed into military service and was used as a two-seat bomber (although mostly for reconnaissance) and served in this role in Spain. The &quot;Blitz&quot; introduced a number of new construction techniques to the Heinkel company; it was its first low-wing monoplane, its first with retractable landing gear, its first all-metal monocoque design and its elliptical, reverse-gull wing would be seen on a number of later projects. The &quot;Blitz&quot; could almost meet the new fighter requirements itself, so it is not surprising that the Günters would choose to work with the existing design as much as possible.

Ernst Heinkel&#x27;s He 112 submission was a scaled-down version of the He 70, a fast mail plane, sharing numerous features with it including; an all-metal construction – including its oval cross-section fuselage and two spar monoplane wings which were covered with flush-head rivets and stressed metal skin-, similar inverted semi-elliptical gull wings and retractable landing gear. The wide track of the undercarriage, a result of having outward retraction from the low point of the wing&#x27;s gull-bend, gave the aircraft excellent ground handling for take-off and landing. The open cockpit and fuselage spine behind the headrest mounted into the deep-section fuselage offered the pilot a good view when taxiing and were included to provide excellent vision and make biplane-trained pilots feel more comfortable.

===Prototypes===

The first prototype, V1, was completed on 1 September 1935. Specifications of the Technisches Amt required that the competing aircraft be fitted with the Junkers Jumo 210, however, as the engine was unavailable, a Rolls-Royce Kestrel V was fitted instead. The V1 prototype of the Heinkel had comparatively large wings and was heavier than its contemporaries, however, due to the wing size, the mass was more evenly spread out resulting in lower wing loading. The upshot of this was that the aircraft had better turn performance; the down shot was that it generated more drag than expected and had a slowed roll rate.

The second prototype, V2, was completed in November. It was powered by a Jumo 210C engine and fitted with a three-blade propeller but was otherwise identical to the V1. Meanwhile, the data from the V1 factory flights was studied to discover where the unexpected drag was coming from. The Günter brothers identified the large, thick wing as the main culprit, and designed an entirely new smaller, and thinner wing with an elliptical planform. As a stop-gap measure, the V2 had its wings clipped by to allow it to compete with the 109. This made the He 112 creep over the wing loading requirements in the specifications, but with the 109 way over the limit, this was not seen as a problem, and the V2 was sent off for testing. The V2, like its predecessor, had problems with spin stability and eventually crashed and was destroyed when test pilot Gerhard Nitschke bailed from the aircraft after losing control during a set of spin tests.

The V3 took to the air in January. Largely similar to the V2 and powered with the same engine, the V3 had minor changes including having a larger radiator, fuselage spine, and vertical stabilizer, having a single cover over the exhaust ports instead of the more common &quot;stack&quot;, and also including modifications to allow armament to be installed in the cowling. The V3 was the first prototype fitted with armament in the form of two MG17 machine guns. It was later modified once more to include a sliding canopy and a new fully elliptical wing. It was expected to join the V2 in testing but instead was assigned back to Heinkel in early 1937 for tests with rocket propulsion. During a test, the rocket exploded and the aircraft was destroyed, but in an amazing effort, the V3 was rebuilt with several changes, including an enclosed cockpit.

===The contest===
Trials of the competing aircraft for the RLM began at Reichlin in October 1935. The thick high-lift aerofoil and open cockpit of the He 112 generated more drag than the Bf 109, causing its performance to suffer despite being equipped with an identical engine. The Bf 109 prototype was able reach a top speed of but the He 112 slower at ). The He 112 had better ground handling and wingloading. The other two competing aircraft, the Arado Ar 80 and the parasol wing Focke-Wulf Fw 159, had problems and performed badly compared to the Bf 109 and the He 112; they were eliminated from any serious consideration. At the end of the trials, the aircraft were judged similar enough that both Messerschmitt and Heinkel were awarded contracts to produce ten prototypes for further testing and competitive trials.

At this point, the He 112 was the favorite over the Bf 109, but opinions changed when the Bf 109 V2 arrived on 21 March. All the competitor aircraft had initially been equipped with the Rolls-Royce Kestrel engine due to the lack of the intended Jumo, but the Bf 109 V2 had the Jumo. From that point on, it started to outperform the He 112 in almost every way, including the Jumo-engined He 112 V2 from 15 April.

The He 112 had better turn performance due to its larger wing, but the Bf 109 was faster at all altitudes and had considerably better agility and aerobatic abilities. During spin tests on 2 March, the Bf 109 V2 showed no problems while the He 112 V2 crashed. Repairs were made to the aircraft and it was returned in April, but it crashed again and was written off. The V1 was then returned to Heinkel on 17 April and fitted with the V2&#x27;s clipped wings.

Meanwhile, news came in that Supermarine had received a contract for full-scale production of the Spitfire. The Spitfire was far more advanced than any existing German aircraft and this caused a wave of concern in the high command of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. Time now took on as much importance as any quality of the winning aircraft itself, and the RLM was ready to put any reasonable design into production. That design was the Bf 109, which in addition to demonstrating better performance, was considerably easier to build due to fewer compound curves and simpler construction throughout. On 12 March RLM produced a document called &quot;Bf 109 Priority Procurement&quot; which indicated which aircraft was now preferred. There were some within the RLM who still favored the Heinkel design, and as a result the RLM then sent out contracts for 10 &quot;zero series&quot; aircraft from both companies.

Testing continued until October, at which point some of the additional zero series aircraft had arrived. At the end of September, there were four He 112s being tested, yet none was a match for the Bf 109. From October on, the Bf 109 appears to have been selected as the winner of the contest. Although no clear date is given, in &quot;Stormy Life&quot; Ernst Udet himself delivered the news to Heinkel that the Bf 109 had entered series production in 1936. He is quoted as saying, &quot;Pawn your crate off on the Turks or the Japanese or the Romanians. They&#x27;ll lap it up.&quot; With a number of air forces looking to upgrade from biplanes and various designs from the early 1930s, the possibility for foreign sales was promising.

==He 112A==

===Prototypes===

Heinkel had expected orders for additional aircraft beyond the initial three prototypes and was able to respond quickly to the new contract for the 10 zero series aircraft. The new aircraft would be given the series designation &quot;He 112 A-0&quot;.

The first of these new versions, V4, was completed in June 1936. It featured a new elliptical wing, a more powerful 210D engine with a two-speed supercharger that brought the power to for takeoff and a smaller tailplane. Like the V3, it also sported two fuselage-mounted MG 17 machine guns, unlike the V3, it featured two wing-mounted Oerlikon MG FF cannons that earned it the nickname &quot;kanonenvogel&quot; (literally, cannon bird).

A prototype, known as the V5, was designed and built by engineer Wernher von Braun, who would later design the V-2 rocket. This variant of the fighter He 112 was powered by an additional rocket engine. First flown in early 1937, the He 112 V5 demonstrated the feasibility of rocket power for aircraft.

In July, both V5 and V6 were completed. V5 was identical to V4, with the Jumo 210D engine. V6, on the other hand, was completed as the pattern aircraft for the A series production run, and thus included the 210C engine instead of the more powerful, but less available 210D. The only other change was a modification to the radiator, but this would not appear on later A-0 series models. V6 suffered a forced landing on 1 August and was repaired and joined V4 for testing in October.

The last of the prototype A-0 series was V8, which was completed in October. It switched engines entirely and mounted the Daimler-Benz DB 600Aa, along with a three-bladed, fully adjustable, all-metal propeller. The engine was a huge change for the aircraft, producing 716 kW (960 hp) for takeoff and had 33.9 L (2,069 in3) displacement at 686 kg (1,510 lb), compared that to the Jumo 210D&#x27;s from 19.7 L (1,202 in3) at about the same weight. V8 was seen primarily as a testbed for the new engine, and more importantly, its cooling systems. The DB used a dry liner in the engine that resulted in poor heat flow, so more of the heat was removed by oil as opposed to water, requiring changes to the cooling systems.

In March 1937, the aircraft was assigned to rocket propulsion tests at Peenemünde. It completed these tests later that summer and was returned to the factory, where it was converted back into a normal model. At the end of the year, it was sent to Spain, where it was seriously damaged on 18 July 1938. Once again, it was put back together and was flying four months later. Its fate after this time is not recorded.

===Production models===

At this point, the prototype stage was ostensibly over, and Heinkel continued building the A-0 as production line models. The naming changed, adding a production number to the end of the name, so the next six examples were known as He 112 A-01 through A-06. All of these included the 210C engine and were essentially identical to V6, with the exception of the radiator.

These aircraft were used in just as varied a manner as the earlier V series had been. A-01 flew in October 1936 and was used as the prototype for a future 112 C-0 carrier-based aircraft. It was later destroyed during rocket tests. A-02 flew in November, and then joined the earlier V models at Rechlin-Lärz Airfield for further testing in the contest. A-03 and A-04 were both completed in December, A-03 was a show aircraft and was flown by Heinkel pilots at various air shows and exhibitions, A-04 was kept at Heinkel for various tests.

The last two models of the A-0 series, A-05 and A-06, were completed in March 1937. They were both shipped to Japan as the initial machines of the 30 for the Imperial Japanese Navy.

==He 112B==

===Prototypes===
In October 1936, the RLM changed the orders for the zero series 112s, instructing Heinkel to complete any A-0s already under construction and then switch the remaining aircraft to an updated design. This gave Heinkel a chance to improve the He 112, which it did by completely redesigning it into an almost entirely new aircraft called the He 112B. It is at this point that it became a modern design that could compete head-to-head with the Bf 109.

The He 112B had a redesigned and cut-down rear fuselage, a new fin and rudder and a completely enclosed cockpit with a bubble-style canopy. The canopy was somewhat more complex than later bubble designs; instead of having two pieces with the majority sliding to the rear, the He 112B canopy was in three pieces, the middle sliding back and over a fixed rear section. Even with the additional framing, the He 112 had excellent visibility for its day. Armament was also standardized on the B model with two 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17 machine guns in the sides of the cowling with 500 rpg and two 20 mm MG FF cannons in the wings with 60 rpg. For aiming, the cockpit included the new Revi 3B reflector gunsight.

The first B series airframe to be completed was V7 in October 1936. V7 used the DB 600Aa engine like the A-series V8, and it also used the original V1 style larger wing. This wing was later replaced with a smaller one but instead of the clipped version from the earlier V models, a new single-spar fully elliptical wing was produced. This design became standard for the entire B series. V7 was turned over to von Braun in April 1937 for yet more rocket tests and managed to survive the experience. It was then returned in the summer and sent to Rechlin where it was used as a test aircraft.

The next type was V9 which flew in July 1937, powered by the Jumo 210D engine. V9 can be considered to be the &quot;real&quot; B series prototype, as V7 had received the DB 600Aa originally for experimental reasons. The entire surface was now flush riveted and the aircraft had several other aerodynamic refinements. The radiator was changed again, this time to a semi-retractable design for reduced drag in flight. The aircraft also underwent a weight reduction program which reduced the empty weight to 1,617 kg (3,565 lb).

As a result of all of these changes, the V9 had a maximum speed of 485 km/h (301 mph) at 4,000 m (13,120 ft), and 430 km/h (270 mph) at sea level. This was a full 20 km/h (10 mph) faster than the contemporary Bf 109B. Nevertheless, by this time, the Bf 109 was already being mass-produced and the RLM saw no need for another similar aircraft. It is also worth noting that users of the aircraft generally found it impossible to reach this speed and rarely managed to exceed 418 km/h (260 mph).

The RLM had already contracted for another six He 112s, so production of the prototypes continued. V10 was supposed to receive the 670 kW (960 hp) Junkers Jumo 211A (Junker&#x27;s new DB 600 competitor) but the engine was not available in time and V10 instead received the new 876 kW (1,175 hp) DB 601Aa. The engine drove V10 to 570 km/h (350 mph) and increased climb rate significantly. V11 was also supposed to get the Jumo 211A but instead received the DB 600Aa.

The last prototype, V12, was actually an airframe taken off the B-1 series production line (which had started by this point). The Jumo 210D was replaced with the new fuel-injected 210Ga, which improved performance of the engine to 522 kW (700 hp) for takeoff, and a sustained output of 503 kW (675 hp) at the reasonably high altitude of 4,700 m (15,420 ft). Better yet, the Ga also decreased fuel consumption, thus increasing the aircraft&#x27;s endurance. The new engine gave V12 such a boost that it became the pattern aircraft for the planned B-2 series production.

With all of these different versions and experimental engine fits, it might seem like every aircraft differed significantly but with the exception of the engines, the Bs were identical. Due to the shortage of just about any German engine at the time and the possibility that advanced versions could be blocked for export, various models had to be designed with different installations. Thus the B models were different only in their engine, the Jumo 210C in the He 112 B-0, the Jumo 210D in the B-1, and the Jumo 210Ga for the B-2.

===Production models===
In order to show off the He 112, V9 spent much of the later half of 1937 being flown by pilots from all over the world. It was also sent around Europe for tours and air shows. The effort was a success and orders quickly started coming in. However, a variety of problems meant few of these were ever delivered.

The first order was from the Imperial Japanese Navy, which had a requirement for a fast-climbing interceptor to deal with Tupolev SB bombers over China. After seeing V9 in flight, it quickly placed an order for 24 112Bs, with an option for 48 more. The first four were shipped in December 1937, another eight in the spring, and promises for the rest to arrive in May. Before delivery, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; unexpectedly took over 12 of the aircraft to bolster its forces during the Sudetenland Crisis. The aircraft were then returned to Heinkel in November, but the Japanese, who were unhappy with the high maintenance workload and lower manoeuvrability compared with fighters like the Mitsubishi A5M, refused to accept them this late and Heinkel was left holding the aircraft.

In November 1937, an Austrian delegation came to see the aircraft, led by &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Alexander Löhr, Command-in-Chief of the &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot; (Austrian Air Force). Test pilot Hans Schalk flew both the Bf 109 and the He 112V9 back to back. Although he felt that both models performed the same, the Heinkel had more balanced steering pressures and better equipment possibilities. They placed an order on 20 December for 42 He 112Bs. Pending the license for the MG FF cannon, these aircraft would remove the cannon and add six THM 10/I bomb shackles which carried small 10 kg (22 lb) anti-personnel bombs. The order was later reduced to 36 examples due to a lack of funds (the He 112B cost ), but the aircraft were never delivered due to the annexation of Austria in the March 1938 Anschluss.

Spain was so impressed with the He 112&#x27;s performance during evaluation in the civil war that the Spanish Air Force purchased the 12 aircraft in early 1938, and later increased the order by another six (some sources say five). Of the first 12, two were shipped in November, another six in January, and the rest in April.

In April, it looked like Yugoslavia would be the next user of the He 112. It placed an order for 30 aircraft but later cancelled the order and decided to produce other designs under license.

Finland appeared to be another potential customer. From January–March 1938, the famous Finnish pilot Gustaf Erik Magnusson travelled to Germany to gain experience in new tactics. He had been on similar tours in France in the past and was interested to see how the Germans were training their pilots. On a visit to the Heinkel plant in Marienehe, he flew the He 112 and reported it to be the best aircraft he had flown. In May, Heinkel sent the first of the He 112 B-1s to Finland to join an air show. It remained for the next week and was flown by a number of pilots, including Magnusson, who had since returned to Finland. Although all of the pilots liked the aircraft, the cost was so high that the &quot;Suomen Ilmavoimat&quot; (Finnish Air Force) decided to stick with the much less expensive Fokker D.XXI.

A similar setback would accompany sales efforts targeting the Dutch Air Force, which was looking to purchase 36 fighters to form two new squadrons. A He 112 B-1 arrived for testing on 12 July and quickly proved to be the best aircraft in the competition. Nevertheless, it decided to purchase the locally built (and rather outdated) Koolhoven F.K.58 instead. In the end, the F.K.58s were never delivered because the factory was bombed on 10 May 1940.

Fortunes would seem to be reversed with Hungary. In June 1938, three pilots of the &quot;Magyar Királyi Honvéd Légierö&quot; (Royal Hungarian Home Defense Air Force or MKHL) were sent to Heinkel to study V9. They were impressed with what they saw, and on 7 September, an order was placed for 36 aircraft, as well as an offer to license the design for local construction. Through a variety of political mishaps, only three aircraft were ever delivered and licensed production never happened.

The final and perhaps most successful customer for the He 112B was Romania. The &quot;Forţã Aeronauticã Regalã Românã&quot; (Royal Romanian Air Force) ordered 24 aircraft in April 1939 and increased the order to 30 on 18 August. Deliveries started in June, with the last being delivered on 30 September.

By this point, the war had broken out and with better models on the market – including Heinkel&#x27;s own He 100 – no one else was interested in purchasing the design. The production line was closed after a total of only 98 aircraft, 85 of those being the B series models.

==He 112R==

===Early experiments with rocket propulsion===
In 1931, the Army Weapons Office testing ground at Kummersdorf had taken over research into liquid-fuel rockets. In 1932, Wernher von Braun designed a rocket of this kind which used high percentage spirit and liquid oxygen. von Braun was interested in evaluating an aircraft with a rocket motor propulsion system. Initially the highest levels at the Army High Command and the Reich Air Ministry (RLM) were opposed to such &quot;fantasies&quot;, as they called them. Many maintained that an aircraft driven by a tail thrust would experience a change in the centre of gravity and flip over but Ernst Heinkel offered support and provided an He 112 fuselage shell less wings for standing tests.

In 1936 von Braun began trials. Late in 1936 Erich Warsitz was seconded by the RLM to Wernher von Braun and Ernst Heinkel, because he had been recognized as one of the most experienced test pilots of the time, and because he also was technically proficient. For tests, the RLM lent Neuhardenberg, a large field about 70 kilometres east of Berlin, listed as a reserve airfield in the event of war. Since Neuhardenberg had no buildings or facilities, a number of marquees were erected to house the aircraft. In the spring of 1937, the Kummersdorf Club transferred to Neuhardenberg and continued the standing trials with the He 112 fuselage. In June 1937 Erich Warsitz undertook the initial flight testing of the He 112 fitted with the rocket engine. Despite a wheels-up landing with the fuselage on fire, it proved that the aircraft could be flown satisfactorily.

Hellmuth Walter at Kiel had been commissioned by the RLM to build a rocket engine for the He 112, so there were two different new rocket motor designs at Neuhardenberg; whereas von Braun&#x27;s engines were powered by alcohol and liquid oxygen, Walter engines used hydrogen peroxide with calcium permanganate catalyst. Instead of a flame, the Walter produced a hot vapour from a chemical reaction generating thrust and giving high speed. The subsequent flights with the He 112 used the Walter-rocket instead of von Braun&#x27;s; it was more reliable, simpler to operate and the dangers to test pilot Erich Warsitz and the machine were less. After the conclusion of the He 112 tests using both rocket motors, the marquees at Neuhardenberg were dismantled at the end of 1937. This coincided with the construction of Peenemünde.

==Operational service==
===Condor Legion===
When it was clear the 112 was losing the contest to the Bf 109, Heinkel offered to re-equip V6 with 20 mm cannon armament as an experimental aircraft. She was then broken down and shipped to Spain on 9 December and assigned to &quot;Versuchsjagdgruppe&quot; 88, a group within the Condor Legion devoted to testing new aircraft and joined three V-series Bf 109s which were also in testing.

Wilhelm Balthasar, later a Battle of Britain ace pilot used it to attack an armoured train and an armoured car. Other pilots flew it, but the engine seized during landing in July and she was written off.

For the annexation of the Sudetenland, every flight-worthy fighter was pressed into service. The batch of He 112Bs for the Japanese Navy was taken over but not used before the end of the crisis and shipped to Japan to fulfill orders.

The Japanese rejected the He 112 as a fighter but took 30 for training duties and V11 with its DB 600Aa was used for testing.

===Spain===

The Spanish government purchased 12 He 112Bs. This increased to 19. The He 112s were to operate as top cover for Fiat fighters in the opening stages of the Civil War, the Fiat having considerably worse altitude performance. In the event, only a single kill was made with the He 112 as a fighter and it was moved onto ground-attack work.

During World War II, when Allied forces landed in North Africa, Spanish forces in Morocco intercepted stray aircraft of both Allied and German forces. None of these incidents resulted in losses. In 1943, one He 112 of &quot;Grupo&quot; nº27 attacked the tail-end aircraft of 11 Lockheed P-38s forcing it down in Algeria after they re-entered French territory having crossed into Spanish Morocco. By 1944, the aircraft were largely grounded due to a lack of fuel and maintenance.

===Hungary===


Like the Germans, Hungary had stiff regulations imposed on its armed forces with the signing of the Treaty of Trianon. In August 1938, the armed forces were re-formed, and with Austria (historically her partner for centuries) being incorporated into Germany, Hungary found herself in the German sphere.

One of the highest priorities for the forces was to re-equip the Hungarian Air Force (Magyar Királyi Honvéd Légierő or MKHL) as soon as possible. Of the various aircraft being considered, the He 112B eventually won out over the competition, and on 7 September, an order was placed for 36 aircraft. The Heinkel production line was just starting, and, with Japan and Spain in the queue, it would be some time before the aircraft could be delivered. Repeated pleas to be moved to the top of the queue failed.

Germany had to refuse the first order at the beginning of 1939 because of its claimed neutrality in the Hungarian/Romanian dispute over Transylvania. In addition, the RLM refused to license the 20 mm MG FF cannon to the Hungarians, likely as a form of political pressure. This later insult did not cause a problem, because they planned to replace it with the locally designed 20 mm Danuvia cannon anyway.
V9 was sent to Hungary as a demonstrator after a tour of Romania and arrived on 5 February 1939. It was test flown by a number of pilots over the next week, and on 14 February, they replaced the propeller with a new three-bladed Junkers design (licensed from Hamilton). While being tested against a CR.32 that day, V9 crashed. On 10 March, a new He 112 B-1/U2 arrived to replace the V9 and was flown by a number of pilots at different fighter units. It was during this time that the Hungarian pilots started to complain about the underpowered engine, as they found that they could reach a top speed of only 430 km/h (270 mph) with the Jumo 210Ea.

With the Japanese and Spanish orders filled, things were looking up for Hungary. However, at that point, Romania placed its order and was placed at the front of the queue. It appeared that the Hungarian production machines might never arrive, so the MKHL started pressing for a license to build the aircraft locally. In May, the Hungarian Manfréd Weiss company in Budapest received the license for the aircraft, and on 1 June, an order was placed for 12 aircraft. Heinkel agreed to deliver a Jumo 210Ga-powered aircraft to serve as a pattern aircraft.

As it turns out, the He 112 B-2 was never delivered; two more of the B-1/U2s with the Jumo 210Ea were sent instead. On arrival in Hungary, the 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17 machine guns were removed and replaced with the local 8 mm (.315 in) Gebauer 1939.M machine guns, and bomb racks were added. The resulting fit was similar to those originally ordered by Austria. Throughout this time, the complaints about the engines were being addressed by continued attempts to license one of the newer 30 L (1,831 in3)-class engines, the Junkers Jumo 211A or the DB 600Aa.

On 30 March 1939, the He 100 V8 took the world absolute speed record, but in stories about the record attempt, the aircraft was referred to as the He 112U. Upon hearing of the record, the Hungarians decided to switch production to this &quot;new version&quot; of the 112, which was based on the newer engines. Then in August, the commander-in-chief of the MKHL recommended that the 112 be purchased as the standard fighter for Hungary (although likely referring to the earlier versions, not the &quot;112U&quot;).

At this point, the engine issue came to a head. It was clear that no production line aircraft would ever reach Hungary, and now that the war was underway, the RLM was refusing to allow their export anyway. Shipments of the Jumo 211 or DB 601 were not even able to fulfil German needs; export of the engine for locally built airframes was likewise out of the question.

By September, the ongoing negotiations with the RLM for the license to build the engines locally stalled, and as a result, the MKHL ordered Manfred-Weiss to stop tooling up for the production line aircraft. The license was eventually canceled in December. The MKHL turned to the Italians and purchased the Fiat CR.32 and Reggiane Re.2000. The latter would be modified into the MÁVAG Héja, becoming the backbone of the MKHL for the early part of the war. From October 1942, the Messerschmitt Bf 109 (F-4 and G variants) would become the backbone of the MKHL.

Nevertheless, the three He 112 B-1/U2 aircraft continued to serve. In the summer of 1940, tensions with Romania over Transylvania started to heat up again and the entire MKHL was placed on alert on 27 June. On 21 August, the He 112s were moved forward to the Debrecen airfield to protect a vital railway link. The next week, a peaceful resolution was found, and the settlement was signed in Vienna on 30 August. The He 112s returned home the following week.

By 1941, the aircraft were ostensibly assigned to defend the Manfréd Weiss plant but were actually used for training. When Allied bomber raids started in the spring of 1944, the aircraft were no longer airworthy, and it appears all were destroyed in a massive raid on the Budapest-Ferihegy airport on 9 August 1944.

In the summer of 1939, possibly as a result of the He 112B deal having difficulties, it was planned to switch the production lines to build a Hungarian-designed aircraft called the Weiss Manfréd WM-23 &quot;Ezüst Nyíl&quot; (&quot;Silver Arrow&quot;). This aircraft&#x27;s wing design likely took some inspiration from the He 112, as it also had an elliptical shape and a slight inverted-gull wing design. Unlike the He 112&#x27;s wings, the WM-23&#x27;s wings would be made of wood skinned with plywood. The fuselage was made of plywood over a welded steel tube frame, and the engine was a 768 kW (1,030 hp) Weiss Manfréd WM K-14B; a licensed derivative of the Gnome-Rhône Mistral-Major radial. It would be armed with a pair of 12.7 mm Gebauer 1940.M GKM machine guns in the upper cowling and two 8 mm Gebauer 1939.M machine guns in the wings.

The higher-powered engine made the WM-23 considerably faster than the He 112. It also performed well during testing and was said to have great acceleration and manoeuvrability. Nevertheless, work proceeded slowly as indigenous fighter development was still new in Hungary and several issues such as vibrations had to be fixed. Only one prototype was built and the project was eventually cancelled outright when the prototype crashed on 21 April 1942 due to intense vibrations breaking off an aileron. Instead of further developing and finishing the WM-23 project, it was decided to stop it and focus on producing the MÁVAG Héja and later the Messerschmitt Bf 109G.

===Japan===
The Imperial Japanese Navy purchased twelve Heinkel He 112B-0 fighters, which it designated both as the Heinkel A7He1 and as the Navy Type He Air Defense Fighter. The Japanese flew the A7He1 briefly during the Second Sino-Japanese War but phased it out of service before the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 in favor of the Mitsubishi A6M Zero. Assuming it still to be in Japanese use, however, the Allies assigned the reporting name Jerry to the A7He1 during World War II.

===Romania===
Germany looked on Romania as an important supplier of war materials notably oil and grain. Looking to secure Romania as an ally, throughout the middle of the 1930s, Germany applied increasing pressure in a variety of forms, best summed up as the &quot;carrot and stick&quot; approach. The carrot came in the form of generous trade agreements for a variety of products and by the late 1930s, Germany formed about ½ of all of Romania&#x27;s trade. The stick came in the form of Germany siding with Romania&#x27;s enemies in various disputes.

On 26 June 1940, the Soviet Union gave Romania a 24-hour ultimatum to return Bessarabia and cede northern Bukovina, even though the latter had never even been a part of Russia. Germany&#x27;s ambassador to Romania advised the king to submit, and he did. In August, Bulgaria reclaimed southern Dobruja, with German and Soviet backing. Later that month, German and Italian foreign ministers met with Romanian diplomats in Vienna and presented them with an ultimatum to accept the ceding of northern Transylvania to Hungary.

Romania was placed in an increasingly bad position as its local allies were gobbled up by Germany, and its larger allies&#x27; (Britain and France) assurances of help proved empty, as demonstrated by their lack of action during the German-Soviet Invasion of Poland. Soon the king was forced from the throne and a pro-German government was formed.

With Romania now firmly in the German sphere of influence, its efforts to re-arm for the coming war were suddenly strongly backed. Romania&#x27;s primary concern was its air force, the ARR. Its fighter force at the time consisted of just over 100 Polish PZL P.11 aircraft, primarily the P.11b or the locally built f model, and 30 more modern PZL P.24E. Although these aircraft were among the most advanced fighters in the world at the time Romania acquired them in the mid-1930s, by 1940 they were outclassed by latest designs.

In April 1939, the ARR was offered the Bf 109 as soon as production was meeting German demands. In the meantime, it could take over 24 He 112Bs that were already built. The ARR jumped at the chance and then increased the order to 30 aircraft.

Late in April, a group of Romanian pilots arrived at Heinkel for conversion training, which went slowly because of the advanced nature of the He 112 in comparison to the PZL P.11. When the training was complete, the pilots returned home in the cockpits of their new aircraft. The aircraft, all of them B-1s or B-2s, were &quot;delivered&quot; in this manner starting in July and ending in October. Two of the aircraft were lost, one in a fatal accident during training in Germany on 7 September, and another suffered minor damage on landing while being delivered and was later repaired at SET in Romania.

When the first aircraft started arriving, they were tested competitively against the locally designed IAR 80 prototype. The Romanian fighter proved to be superior to the He 112B in almost every way. At the same time, the test flights revealed a number of disadvantages of the He 112, notably the underpowered engine and poor speed. The result of the fly-off was that the IAR 80 was ordered into immediate production, and orders for any additional He 112s were cancelled.

By 15 September, enough of the aircraft had arrived to re-equip &quot;Escadrila&quot; 10 and 11. The two squadrons were formed into the &quot;Grupul 5 vânãtoare&quot; (5th Fighter Group) within the &quot;Flotila 1 Vânătoare&quot; (1st Fighter Flotilla), responsible for the defense of Bucharest. In October, they were renamed as the 51st and 52nd squadrons, still forming the 5th. The pilots had not been a part of the group that had been trained at Heinkel, so they started working their way toward the He 112 using Nardi FN.305 monoplane trainers. The training lasted until the spring of 1940 when a single additional He 112 B-2 was delivered as a replacement for the one that crashed in Germany the previous September.

During the troubles with Hungary, Hungarian Ju 86s and He 70s started making reconnaissance flights over Romanian territory. Repeated attempts to intercept them failed because of the low speed of the PZL P.11 aircraft that equipped the 2nd Fighter Flotilla. In order to combat this, the 51st Fighter Squadron deployed to Transylvania to aid the 2nd Fighter Flotilla. Six He 112s were deployed to the Someșeni airfield, and another six to the Nușfalău airfield. On 28 August, a Romanian He 112 attacked and damaged a Hungarian Ca.135bis bomber under controversial circumstances. The Hungarian version of events claims that the bomber was on a training mission in Hungarian airspace and the Romanian He 112 had entered Hungarian airspace and damaged the bomber which landed safely at an airfield in Debrecen. This incident caused outrage among Hungarian aviators. According to the Romanian version of events, Hungarian aircraft entered Romanian airspace, so Romanian fighters intervened and &quot;Locotenent&quot; engaged the bomber over Săcueni. Several of his 20 mm rounds hit the bomber, which was forced down and crash-landed near Berveni, north of Carei. The crew of the bomber consisting of Captain Ghenos Janosz and Lieutenant Toldes Gyula were taken prisoner.

When Germany prepared to invade the USSR in 1941, Romania joined it in an effort to regain the territories lost the year before. The ARR, with the Air Combat Group, worked with &quot;Luftflotte 4&quot;, and in preparation for the invasion, &quot;Grupul 5 Vânãtoare&quot; was sent to Moldavia. At the time, 24 of the He 112s were flyable. Three were left at their home base at Pipera to complete repairs, two others had been lost to accidents, and the fate of the others is unknown. On 15 June, the aircraft were moved again, to Foscani-North in northern Moldavia.

With the opening of the war on 22 June, the He 112s were in the air at 1050 supporting an attack by Potez 63s of &quot;Grupul 2 bombardment&quot; on the Soviet airfields at Bolgrad and Bulgãrica. Although some &quot;flak&quot; was encountered on the way to and over Bolgrad, the attack was successful and a number of Soviet aircraft were bombed on the ground. By the time they reached Bulgãrica, fighters were in the air waiting for them, and as a result the 12 He 112s were met by about 30 I-16s. The results of this combat were mixed; &quot;Sublocotenent&quot; Teodor Moscu shot down one of a pair of I-16s still taking off. When he was pulling out, he hit another in a head-on pass and it crashed into the Danube. He was set upon by several I-16s and received several hits, his fuel tanks were punctured but did not seal. Losing fuel rapidly, he formed up with his wingman and managed to put down at the Romanian airfield at Bârlad. His aircraft was later repaired and returned to duty. Of the bombers, three of the 13 dispatched were shot down.

Over the next few days, the He 112s would be used primarily as ground-attack aircraft, where their heavy armament was considered to be more important than their ability to fight in the air. Typical missions would start before dawn and would have the Heinkels strafe Soviet airbases. Later in the day, they would be sent on search and destroy missions, looking primarily for artillery and trains.

Losses were heavy, most not due to combat, but simply because the aircraft were flying an average of three missions a day and were not receiving adequate maintenance. This problem affected all of the ARR, which did not have the field maintenance logistics worked out at the time. On 29 July, a report on the readiness of the air forces listed only 14 He 112s in flyable condition and another eight repairable. As a result, the aircraft of the 52nd were folded into the 51st to form a full-strength squadron on 13 August. The men of the 52nd were merged with the 42nd who flew IAR.80s and were soon sent home to receive IAR.80s of their own. A report from August on the He 112 rated it very poorly, once again noting its lack of power and poor speed.

For a time, the 51st continued in a front-line role, although it saw little combat. When Odessa fell on 16 October, the Romanian war effort ostensibly ended, and the aircraft were considered to be no longer needed at the front. 15 were kept at Odessa and the rest were released to Romania for training duty (although they seem to have seen no use). On 1 November, the 51st moved to Tatarka and then returned to Odessa on the 25th, performing coastal patrol duties all the while. On 1 July 1942, the 51st returned to Pipera and stood down after a year in action.

On 19 July one of the He 112s took to the air to intercept Soviet bombers in what was the first night mission by a Romanian aircraft. As the Soviets were clearly gearing up for a night offensive on Bucharest, the 51st was then re-equipped with Bf 110 night fighters and became the only Romanian night fighter squadron.

By 1943, the IAR.80 was no longer competitive, and the ARR started an overdue move to a newer fighter. The fighter in this case was the Bf 109G. The He 112s found themselves actively being used in the training role at last. The inline engine and general layout of the German designs were considered similar enough to make it useful in this role, and as a result the He 112s came under the control of the &quot;Corpul 3 Aerian&quot; (3rd Air Corps). Several more of the He 112s were destroyed in accidents during this time. It soldiered on in this role into late 1944, even after Romania had changed sides and joined the Allies.

<text>Horace Mann (May 4, 1796August 2, 1859) was an American educational reformer, slavery abolitionist and Whig politician known for his commitment to promoting public education, he is thus also known as &quot;The Father of American Education&quot;. In 1848, after public service as Secretary of the Massachusetts State Board of Education, Mann was elected to the United States House of Representatives (1848–1853). From September 1852 to his death in 1859, he served as President of Antioch College.

Arguing that universal public education was the best way to turn unruly American children into disciplined, judicious republican citizens, Mann won widespread approval from modernizers, especially in the Whig Party, for building public schools. Most U.S. states adopted a version of the system Mann established in Massachusetts, especially the program for normal schools to train professional teachers. Educational historians credit Horace Mann, along with Henry Barnard and Catharine Beecher, as one of the major advocates of the Common School Movement.

==Early years, family and education==
Horace Mann was born in Franklin, Massachusetts. His father was a farmer without much money. Mann was the great-grandson of Samuel Man.

From age ten to age twenty, he had no more than six weeks&#x27; schooling during any year, but he made use of the Franklin Public Library, the first public library in America. He enrolled at Brown University when he was twenty years old and graduated in three years as valedictorian (1819). The theme of his oration was &quot;The Progressive Character of the Human Race.&quot; He learned Greek and Latin from Samuel Barrett, who later became a famous Unitarian minister.

==Early career==
===Legal career===
Mann studied law for a short time in Wrentham, Massachusetts and was a tutor of Latin and Greek (1820–1822) and a librarian (1821–1823) at Brown. During 1822, he also studied at Litchfield Law School and, in 1823, was admitted to the bar in Dedham, Massachusetts.

Mann defended James Allen in a robbery trial by placing a reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury by pointing out that the victim had previously identified someone else as the man who robbed him. The strategy worked, and there was a hung jury.

===Massachusetts legislature===
Mann was elected to the Massachusetts legislature in 1827, and in that role was active in the interests of education, public charities, and laws for the suppression of alcoholic drinks and lotteries. He established an asylum in Worcester, and in 1833 was chairman of its board of trustees. Mann continued to be returned to the legislature as a representative from Dedham until his removal to Boston in 1833. While in the legislature, he was a member and part of the time chairman of the committee for the revision of the state statutes, and a large number of salutary provisions were incorporated into the code at his suggestion. After their enactment, he was appointed one of the editors of the work and prepared its marginal notes and its references to judicial decisions. He was elected to the Massachusetts State Senate from Boston in 1835 and was its president in 1836–1837. As a member of the Senate, he spent time as the majority leader, and aimed his focus at infrastructure, funding the construction of railroads and canals.

==Personal life==
In 1830, Mann married Charlotte Messer, the daughter of former Brown University president Asa Messer. She died two years later on August 1, 1832; he never fully recovered from the intense grief and shock that accompanied her death.

In 1843, he married Mary Tyler Peabody. Afterward, the couple accompanied Samuel Gridley Howe and Julia Ward Howe on a dual honeymoon to Europe. They subsequently purchased a home in West Newton, Massachusetts, at the corner of Chestnut and Highland Streets. Horace and Mary had three sons: Horace Mann Jr., George Combe Mann, and Benjamin Pickman Mann.

==Education reform==

It was not until he was appointed Secretary in 1837 of the newly created Massachusetts Board of Education that he began the work which was to make him one of America&#x27;s most influential educational reformers. Upon starting his duties, he withdrew from all other professional or business engagements as well as politics.

As Secretary of Education, Mann held teachers&#x27; conventions, delivered numerous lectures and addresses, carried on an extensive correspondence, and introduced numerous reforms. Mann persuaded his fellow modernizers, especially those in the Whig Party, to legislate tax-supported elementary public education in their states and to feminize the teaching force. To justify the new taxes Mann assured businessmen that more education in the work force made for a richer and more profitable economy.

Most northern states adopted one version or another of the system he established in Massachusetts, especially the program for &quot;normal schools&quot; to train professional teachers.

Mann traveled to every School in the state so he could physically examine each school ground. He planned and inaugurated the Massachusetts normal school system in Lexington (which shortly thereafter moved to Framingham), Barre (which shortly thereafter moved to Westfield) and Bridgewater, and began preparing a series of annual reports, which had a wide circulation and were considered as being &quot;among the best expositions, if, indeed, they are not the very best ones, of the practical benefits of a common school education both to the individual and to the state&quot;. By his advocacy of the disuse of corporal punishment in school discipline, he was involved in a controversy with some of the Boston teachers that resulted in the adoption of his views.

In 1838, he founded and edited &quot;The Common School Journal&quot;. In this journal, Mann targeted the public school and its problems. His six main principles were:

# the public should no longer remain ignorant; 
# that such education should be paid for, controlled, and sustained by an interested public; 
# that this education will be best provided in schools that embrace children from a variety of backgrounds; 
# that this education must be non-sectarian; 
# that this education must be taught using the tenets of a free society; and 
# that education should be provided by well-trained, professional teachers.

Under the auspices of the board, but at his own expense, he went to Europe in 1843 to visit schools, especially in Prussia, and his seventh annual report, published after his return, embodied the results of his tour. Many editions of this report were printed, not only in Massachusetts but in other states, in some cases by private individuals and in others by legislatures; several editions were issued in England.

Mann hoped that by bringing all children of all classes together, they could have a common learning experience. This would also allow the less fortunate to advance in the social scale and education would &quot;equalize the conditions of men.&quot; Moreover, it was viewed also as a road to social advancement by the early labor movement and as a goal of having common schools. Mann also suggested that having schools would help those students who did not have appropriate discipline in the home. Building a person&#x27;s character was just as important as reading, writing, and arithmetic. Instilling values such as obedience to authority, promptness in attendance, and organizing the time according to bell ringing helped students prepare for future employment.

Mann faced some resistance from parents who did not want to give up the moral education to teachers and bureaucrats. The normal schools trained mostly women, giving them new career opportunities as teachers. Mann believed that women were better suited for teaching, regardless of their status as a mother, and used his position to push for a feminization of the profession.

The practical result of Mann&#x27;s work was a revolution in the approach used in the common school system of Massachusetts, which in turn influenced the direction of other states. In carrying out his work, Mann met with bitter opposition by some Boston schoolmasters who strongly disapproved of his innovative pedagogical ideas, and by various religious sectarians, who contended against the exclusion of all sectarian instruction from the schools.

===Secular nature===
As the &quot;Old Deluder Satan Act&quot; and other 17th-century Massachusetts School Laws attest, early education in Massachusetts had a clear religious intent. However, by the time of Mann&#x27;s leadership in education, various developments (including a vibrant populist Protestant faith and increased religious diversity) fostered a secular school system with a religiously passive stance.

While Mann affirmed that &quot;our Public Schools are not Theological Seminaries&quot; and that they were &quot;debarred by law from inculcating the peculiar and distinctive doctrines of any one religious denomination amongst us ... or all that is essential to religion or salvation,&quot; he assured those who objected to this secular nature that &quot;our system earnestly inculcates all Christian morals; it founds its morals based on religion; it welcomes the religion of the Bible; and, in receiving the Bible, it allows it to do what it is allowed to do in no other system—to speak for itself. But here it stops, not because it claims to have compassed all truth; but because it disclaims to act as an umpire between hostile religious opinions.&quot;

Mann stated that this position resulted in a near-universal use of the Bible in the schools of Massachusetts and that this served as an argument against the assertion by some that Christianity was excluded from his schools, or that they were anti-Christian. A devotee of the pseudoscience of phrenology, Mann believed education could eliminate or reduce human failings and compensate for any biological flaws.

Mann also once stated that &quot;it may not be easy theoretically, to draw the line between those views of religious truth and of Christian faith which is common to all, and may, therefore, with propriety be inculcated in schools, and those which, being peculiar to individual sects, are therefore by law excluded; still it is believed that no practical difficulty occurs in the conduct of our schools in this regard.&quot;

Rather than sanctioning a particular church as was often the norm in many states, the Legislature proscribed books &quot;calculated to favor the tenets of any particular set of Christians.&quot;

===Reading instruction===
Like many nineteenth century reformers, Horace Mann believed that &quot;children would find it far more interesting and pleasurable to memorize words and read short sentences and stories without having to bother to learn the names of the letters&quot;. According to Diane Ravitch, he condemned the alphabet method, claiming that it was &quot;repulsive and soul-deadening to children&quot;. He described the letters of the alphabet as &quot;skeleton-shaped, bloodless, ghostly apparitions&quot;. To him, teaching the alphabet was entirely illogical: &quot;When we wish to give a child the idea of a new animal, we do not present successively the different parts of it,—an eye, an ear, the nose, the mouth, the body, or a leg: but we present a whole animal, as one object&quot;.

Mann believed that &quot;children&#x27;s earliest books should teach whole words, skipping the alphabet and the sounds of the letters&quot;, though he may have been confused between &quot;the alphabet method of learning letters through words and a word method, now called the look-and-say method, or learning to read through saying the word as a whole&quot;.

Mann&#x27;s endorsement of &quot;word method&quot; for reading instruction made a lasting impression on other reformers of the period, and &quot;by 1890 the alphabet method had virtually died out&quot;. Francis Parker and John Dewey used the &quot;word method&quot; as one of the features of the &quot;Progressive&quot; system of education. As Nancy Millichap notes, &quot;Despite the enthusiasm of educators for their new methods of teaching, the illiteracy rate remained high. Among American soldiers enlisted in World War I, 24.9 percent proved unable to read or write, and during World War II approximately the same percentage of British servicemen [who were taught using the same method] were found to be similarly handicapped. In 1940, one-third of high school students were incapable of mastering reading and writing well enough to profit from textbook instruction, and one half of the adult population in the United States was functionally illiterate&quot;.

The backlash against &quot;word method&quot; culminated in a 1955 book &quot;Why Johnny Can&#x27;t Read&quot; by Rudolf Flesch, in which he condemned this method for &quot;treating children as if they were dogs&quot; and recommended returning to teaching phonics. Nevertheless, the &quot;ill-informed, ineffective reading instruction&quot; remains the norm in American colleges of education and, accordingly, in American elementary schools.

===Emulation of the Prussian system ===
Upon becoming the secretary of education of Massachusetts in 1837, Mann worked to create a statewide system of professional teachers, based on the Prussian model of &quot;common schools.&quot; Prussia was attempting to develop a system of education by which all students were entitled to the same content in their public classes. Mann initially focused on elementary education and on training teachers. The common-school movement quickly gained strength across the North. Connecticut adopted a similar system in 1849, and Massachusetts passed a compulsory attendance law in 1852. Mann&#x27;s crusading style attracted wide middle-class support. Historian Ellwood P. Cubberley asserts:

No one did more than he to establish in the minds of the American people the conception that education should be universal, non-sectarian, free, and that its aims should be social efficiency, civic virtue, and character, rather than mere learning or the advancement of sectarian ends.

An important technique which Mann had learned in Prussia and introduced in Massachusetts in 1848 was to place students in grades by age. They were assigned by age to different grades and progressed through them, regardless of differences of aptitude. In addition, he used the lecture method common in European universities, which required students to receive professional instruction rather than teach one another. Previously, schools had often had groups of students who ranged in age from 6 to 14 years. With the introduction of age grading, multi-aged classrooms all but disappeared. Some students progressed with their grade and completed all courses the secondary school had to offer. These were &quot;graduated,&quot; and were awarded a certificate of completion. This was increasingly done at a ceremony imitating college graduation rituals.

Arguing that universal public education was the best way to turn the nation&#x27;s unruly children into disciplined, judicious republican citizens, Mann won widespread approval for building public schools from modernizers, especially among fellow Whigs. Most states adopted one version or another of the system he established in Massachusetts, especially the program for &quot;normal schools&quot; to train professional teachers. This quickly developed into a widespread form of school which later became known as the &quot;factory model school&quot;.

==A Whig in Congress==
In the spring of 1848 he was elected to the United States Congress as a Whig to fill the vacancy caused by the death of John Quincy Adams. His first speech in that role was in advocacy of its right and duty to exclude slavery from the territories, and in a letter, in December of that year, he said: &quot;I think the country is to experience serious times. Interference with slavery will excite civil commotion in the South. But it is best to interfere. Now is the time to see whether the Union is a rope of sand or a band of steel.&quot; Again he said: &quot;I really think if we insist upon passing the Wilmot proviso for the territories that the south—a part of them—will rebel; but I would pass it, rebellion or not. I consider no evil so great as the extension of slavery.&quot;

During the first session, he volunteered as counsel for Drayton and Sayres, who were indicted for stealing 76 slaves in the District of Columbia, and at the trial was engaged for 21 successive days in their defense. In 1850, he was engaged in a controversy with Daniel Webster concerning the extension of slavery and the Fugitive Slave Law, calling Webster&#x27;s support for the Compromise of 1850 a &quot;vile catastrophe&quot;, and comparing him to &quot;Lucifer descending from Heaven&quot;. Mann was defeated by a single vote at the ensuing nominating convention by Webster&#x27;s supporters; but, on appealing to the people as an independent anti-slavery candidate, he was re-elected, serving from April 1848 until March 1853.

==Abolitionism==

Mann was a staunch opponent of slavery as a member of Congress; in a written address to an 1852 &quot;Convention of the Colored Freemen of Ohio&quot; he stated: In the same address he opposed plans to forcibly deport freedmen from the United States to other nations: 
 Mann considered there to be three legitimate methods by which the Africans in captivity in the US could emancipate themselves, including, as a last resort, that Mann&#x27;s preferred method for the self-emancipation of the slaves was that free blacks should voluntarily form all-black communities of their own - either in Jamaica or in another Caribbean nation - or perhaps in the American West - in which men like Frederick Douglass, Henry Bibb and Henry Box Brown &quot;instead of making speeches might be making laws. Instead of commanding the types of a newspaper press [...] might be commanding armies and navies&quot; and could more effectively organize the liberation of their enslaved brethren in the U.S. from these strongholds.

==Leadership of Antioch College and last years==

In September 1852, he was nominated for governor of Massachusetts by the Free Soil Party, and the same day was chosen president of the newly established Antioch College at Yellow Springs, Ohio. Failing in the election for governor, he accepted the presidency of the college, which he continued until his death. There he taught economics, philosophy, and theology; he was popular with students and with lay audiences across the Midwest who attended his lectures promoting public schools. Mann also employed the first female faculty member to be paid on an equal basis with her male colleagues, Rebecca Pennell, his niece. His commencement message to the class of 1859 was to &quot;Be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity&quot;.

Antioch College was founded by the Christian Connexion, which later withdrew its financial support causing the college to struggle for many years with meager financial resources due to sectarian infighting. Mann himself was charged with nonadherence to sectarianism because, previously a Congregationalist by upbringing, he joined the Unitarian Church.

Mann was also drawn to Antioch because it was a coeducational institution, among the first in the country to teach men and women in the same classes, Mann and his wife had conflicts with female students, however, who came to Yellow Springs in search of greater equality. The young women chafed at restrictions on their behavior, and wanted to meet with men in literary societies, which Mann and his wife opposed.

He collapsed shortly after the 1859 commencement and died that summer of typhoid fever. Antioch historian Robert Straker wrote that Mann had been &quot;crucified by crusading sectarians.&quot; Ralph Waldo Emerson lamented &quot;what seems the fatal waste of labor and life at Antioch.&quot; Mann&#x27;s wife, who wrote in anguish that &quot;the blood of martyrdom waters the spot,&quot; later disinterred his body from Yellow Springs. He is buried in the North Burial Ground in Providence, Rhode Island, next to his first wife.

==Legacy==
Historians treat Mann as one of the most important leaders of education reform in the antebellum period.

=== Commemoration ===

Many places around the world are named after Mann. Among them are more than 50 public schools in the United States.

Horace Mann&#x27;s statue stands in front of the Massachusetts State House along with that of Daniel Webster.

At Antioch College, a monument carries his quote, which has been recently adopted as the college motto: &quot;Be Ashamed to Die Until You Have Won Some Victory for Humanity.&quot;

The University of Northern Colorado named the gates to their campus in his dedication, a gift of the Class of 1910.

The Springfield, Illinois-based Illinois Education Association Mutual Insurance Company, was renamed in honor of Mann in 1950 as the Horace Mann Educators Corporation.

Pittsburg State University in Pittsburg, Kansas, has a building named Horace Mann School. It currently houses the Student Welcoming Center.

In Massachusetts, public charter schools that are authorized by local school districts are known as Horace Mann charters.
Brown University Graduate School awards an annual &quot;Horace Mann Medal&quot; to one of its alumni.

<text>STS-107 was the 113th flight of the Space Shuttle program, and the 28th and final flight of Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;. The mission ended on February 1, 2003, with the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster which killed all seven crew members and destroyed the space shuttle. It was the 88th post-&quot;Challenger&quot; disaster mission.

The flight launched from Kennedy Space Center in Florida on January 16, 2003. It spent 15 days, 22 hours, 20 minutes, 32 seconds in orbit. The crew conducted a multitude of international scientific experiments. The disaster occurred during reentry while the orbiter was over Texas.

Immediately after the disaster, NASA convened the &quot;Columbia&quot; Accident Investigation Board to determine the cause of the disintegration. The source of the failure was determined to have been caused by a piece of foam that broke off during launch and damaged the thermal protection system (reinforced carbon-carbon panels and thermal protection tiles) on the leading edge of the orbiter&#x27;s left wing. During re-entry the damaged wing slowly overheated and came apart, eventually leading to loss of control and disintegration of the vehicle. The cockpit window frame is now exhibited in a memorial inside the Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; Pavilion at the Kennedy Space Center.

The damage to the thermal protection system on the wing was similar to that of &quot;Atlantis&quot; which had also sustained damage in 1988 during STS-27, the second mission after the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster. However, the damage on STS-27 occurred at a spot that had more robust metal (a thin steel plate near the landing gear), and that mission survived the re-entry.

STS-107 carried the SPACEHAB Research Double Module (RDM) on its inaugural flight, the Freestar experiment (mounted on a Hitchhiker Program rack), and the Extended Duration Orbiter pallet. SPACEHAB was first flown on STS-57.

On the day of the experiment, a video taken to study atmospheric dust may have detected a new atmospheric phenomenon, dubbed a &quot;TIGER&quot; (Transient Ionospheric Glow Emission in Red).

On board &quot;Columbia&quot; was a copy of a drawing by Petr Ginz, the editor-in-chief of the magazine &quot;Vedem&quot;, who depicted what he imagined the Earth looked like from the Moon when he was a 14-year-old prisoner in the Terezín concentration camp. The copy was in the possession of Ilan Ramon and was lost in the disintegration. Ramon also traveled with a dollar bill received from the Lubavitcher Rebbe.

An Australian experiment, created by students from Glen Waverley Secondary College, was designed to test the reaction of zero gravity on the web formation of the Australian garden orb weaver spider.

===Major experiments===

Examples of some of the experiments and investigations on the mission.

In SPACEHAB RDM:
*9 commercial payloads with 21 investigations;
*4 payloads for the European Space Agency with 14 investigations;
*1 payload for ISS Risk Mitigation;
*18 payloads NASA&#x27;s Office of Biological and Physical Research (OBPR) with 23 investigations.

In the payload bay attached to RDM:
*Combined Two-Phase Loop Experiment (COM2PLEX);
*Miniature Satellite Threat Reporting System (MSTRS);
*Star Navigation (STARNAV).

FREESTAR
*Critical Viscosity of Xenon-2 (CVX-2);
*Space Experiment Module (SEM-14);
*Mediterranean Israeli Dust Experiment (MEIDEX);
*Low Power Transceiver (LPT);
*Solar Constant Experiment-3 (SOLCON-3);
*Shuttle Ozone Limb Sounding Experiment (SOLSE-2);

Additional payloads
*Shuttle Ionospheric Modification with Pulsed Local Exhaust Experiment (SIMPLEX);
*Ram Burn Observation (RAMBO).

Because much of the data was transmitted during the mission, there was still large return on the mission objectives even though &quot;Columbia&quot; was lost on re-entry. NASA estimated that 30% of the total science data was saved and collected through telemetry back to ground stations. Around 5-10% more data was saved and collected through recovering samples and hard drives intact on the ground after the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster, increasing the total data of saved experiments despite the disaster from 30% to 35-40%.

About five or six &quot;Columbia&quot; payloads encompassing many experiments were successfully recovered in the debris field. Scientists and engineers were able to recover 99% of the data for one of the six FREESTAR experiments, Critical Viscosity of Xenon-2 (CVX-2), that flew unpressurized in the payload bay during the mission after recovering the viscometer and hard drive damaged but fully intact in the debris field in Texas. NASA recovered a commercial payload, Commercial Instrumentation Technology Associates (ITA) Biomedical Experiments-2 (CIBX-2), and ITA was able to increase the total data saved from STS-107 from 0% to 50% for this payload. This experiment studied treatments for cancer, and the micro-encapsulation experiment part of the payload was completely recovered, increasing from 0% data to 90% data after recovering the samples fully intact for this experiment. In this same payload were numerous crystal-forming experiments by hundreds of elementary and middle school students from all across the United States. Miraculously most of their experiments were found intact in CIBX-2, increasing from 0% data to 100% fully recovered data. The BRIC-14 (moss growth experiment) and BRIC-60 (&quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot; roundworm experiment) samples were found intact in the debris field within a radius in east Texas. 80-87% of these live organisms survived the catastrophe. The moss and roundworms experiments&#x27; original primary mission was not nominal due to the lack of having the samples immediately after landing in their original state (they were discovered many months after the crash), but these samples helped the scientific community greatly in the field of astrobiology and helped form new theories about microorganisms surviving a long trip in outer space while traveling on meteorites or asteroids.

===Re-entry===

&quot;Columbia&quot; began re-entry as planned, but the heat shield was compromised due to damage sustained during the ascent. The heat of re-entry was free to spread into the damaged portion of the orbiter, ultimately causing its disintegration and the death of all seven astronauts.

The accident triggered a 7-month investigation and a search for debris, and over 85,000 pieces were collected throughout the initial investigation. This amounted to roughly 38 percent of the orbiter vehicle.
==Insignia==

The mission insignia itself is the only patch of the shuttle program that is entirely shaped in the orbiter&#x27;s outline. The central element of the patch is the microgravity symbol, &quot;μg&quot;, flowing into the rays of the astronaut symbol.

The mission inclination is portrayed by the 39-degree angle of the astronaut symbol to the Earth&#x27;s horizon. The sunrise is representative of the numerous experiments that are the dawn of a new era for continued microgravity research on the International Space Station and beyond. The breadth of science and the exploration of space is illustrated by the Earth and stars. The constellation Columba (the dove) was chosen to symbolize peace on Earth and the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;. The seven stars also represent the mission crew members and honor the original astronauts who paved the way to make research in space possible. Six stars have five points, the seventh has six points like a Star of David, symbolizing the Israeli Space Agency&#x27;s contributions to the mission.

An Israeli flag is adjacent to the name of Payload Specialist Ramon, who was the first Israeli in space. The crew insignia or &#x27;patch&#x27; design was initiated by crew members Dr. Laurel Clark and Dr. Kalpana Chawla. First-time crew member Clark provided most of the design concepts as Chawla led the design of her maiden voyage STS-87 insignia. Clark also pointed out that the dove in the Columba constellation was mythologically connected to the explorers the Argonauts who released the dove.

==Wake-up calls==
Throughout the shuttle program, sleeping astronauts were often awakened each morning by songs and short pieces of music chosen by their families, friends, and Mission Control, a tradition dating back to the Gemini and Apollo programs. While the crew of STS-107 worked shifts in &quot;red&quot; and &quot;blue&quot; teams to work around the clock, on this mission each shift was still awoken with a &quot;wake-up call&quot;; the only other two-shift shuttle mission to do so was STS-99.

<text>Ilan Ramon (; , born Ilan Wolfferman (); June 20, 1954 – February 1, 2003) was an Israeli fighter pilot and later the first Israeli astronaut. He served as a Space Shuttle payload specialist on STS-107, the fatal mission of &quot;Columbia&quot;, in which he and the six other crew members were killed when the spacecraft disintegrated during re-entry. At 48, Ramon was the oldest member of the crew. He is the only foreign recipient of the United States Congressional Space Medal of Honor, which was awarded posthumously.

==Biography==
Born in Ramat Gan, Israel, to Tonya (1929–2003) and Eliezer Wolfferman (1923–2006), a family of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, Ramon grew up in Beersheba. His father was from Germany, and his family fled Nazi persecution in 1935. His mother and grandmother were from Poland, and were Holocaust survivors, having been in Auschwitz. They emigrated to Israel in 1949. Ramon&#x27;s first name, Ilan, means &quot;tree&quot; in Hebrew. Ramon Hebraizied his surname from Wolfferman to Ramon, a more &quot;Israeli (Sabra)&quot; name, when he joined the Israeli Air Force (IAF). This was customary and expected of IAF pilots, as well as among IDF senior officers at the time.

Ramon graduated from high school in 1972. In 1987, he graduated with a B.Sc. degree in electronics and computer engineering from Tel Aviv University.

==Air Force career==
Ramon was a Colonel (&quot;Aluf Mishne&quot;) and a fighter pilot in the Israeli Air Force, with thousands of hours of flying experience. He began the fighter pilot&#x27;s course at the Israeli Air Force Flight Academy in 1972, but was forced to suspend his studies after breaking his hand. Ramon served in an electronic warfare unit in the Sinai during the Yom Kippur War, and afterwards, returned to the flight academy. He graduated from the fighter pilots&#x27; course in 1974. From 1974 to 1976, Ramon participated in A-4 Skyhawk Basic Training and Operations. From 1976 to 1980, he participated in training and operations for the Mirage IIIC. In 1980, as one of the IAF&#x27;s establishment team of the first F-16 Squadron in Israel, Ramon attended the F-16 Training Course at Hill Air Force Base, Utah. From 1981 to 1983, he served as the Deputy Squadron Commander B, F-16 Squadron.

In 1981, Ramon was the youngest pilot taking part in Operation Opera, Israel&#x27;s strike against Iraq&#x27;s unfinished Osiraq nuclear reactor. The facility was destroyed, killing ten Iraqi soldiers and one French researcher. Ramon also participated in the 1982 Lebanon War.

After attending the Tel Aviv University, Ramon served as Deputy Squadron Commander A, 119 Squadron, flying the F-4 Phantom (1988–1990). In 1990, he attended the Squadron Commanders Course and between 1990 and 1992, commanded 117 Squadron, flying the F-16. From 1992 to 1994, Ramon was head of the Aircraft Branch in the Operations Requirement Department. In 1994, he was promoted to the rank of colonel and assigned as head of the Department of Operational Requirement for Weapon Development and Acquisition. Ramon stayed at this post until 1998.

Ramon accumulated over 3,000 flight hours on the A-4, Mirage IIIC, and F-4, and over 1,000 flight hours on the F-16.

==NASA experience==
===NASA on-ground trainings===
In 1997, Ramon was selected as a Payload Specialist. He was designated to train as prime for a space shuttle mission with a payload that included a multispectral camera for recording desert aerosol (dust). In July 1998, Ramon reported for training at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, where he trained until 2003. Ramon flew aboard STS-107, logging 15 days, 22 hours and 20 minutes in space.

===Space flight: STS-107, Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;===

STS-107 &quot;Columbia&quot; (January 16 – February 1, 2003), a 16-day flight, was a dedicated science and research mission. Working 24 hours a day, in two alternating shifts, the crew successfully conducted approximately 80 experiments.

Personally nonreligious, Ramon performed traditional observance while in orbit: &quot;I feel I am representing all Jews and all Israelis.&quot; He was the first astronaut to request kosher food and marked the Sabbath. Ramon, whose mother and grandmother were survivors of Auschwitz, was asked by S. Isaac Mekel, director of development at the American Society for Yad Vashem, to take an item from Yad Vashem aboard STS-107. Ramon carried with him a pencil sketch, &quot;Moon Landscape&quot;, drawn by 16-year-old Petr Ginz, who was murdered in Auschwitz. Ramon also took with him a microfiche copy of the Torah given to him by Israeli president Moshe Katsav and a miniature Torah scroll (from the Holocaust) that was given to him by Prof. Yehoyachin Yosef, a Bergen Belsen survivor. Ramon asked the 1939 Club, a Holocaust survivor organization in Los Angeles, for a symbol of the Holocaust to take into outer space with him. A barbed wire mezuzah by the San Francisco artist Aimee Golant was selected. Ramon also took with him a dollar of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson. 

Ramon and the rest of the &quot;Columbia&quot; crew died over East Texas in the Southern United States during entry into Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, 16 minutes before scheduled landing.

===Diary===
Among the recovered 40% from the contents of the &quot;Columbia&quot; Space Shuttle that crashed outside Palestine, Texas, were 37 pages of Ramon&#x27;s diary, which NASA returned to his wife. His widow, Rona, shared an excerpt with the Israeli public in a display at Jerusalem&#x27;s Israel Museum. Rona Ramon brought it to Israel Museum forensic experts. Only two pages were displayed, one containing Ramon&#x27;s notes, and the other is a copy of the Kiddush prayer. Curator Yigal Zalmona said the diary was partially restored in one year, and needed four more, for police scientists to decipher 80% of the text. Zalmona stated: &quot;The diary survived extreme heat in the explosion, extreme atmospheric cold, and then was attacked by microorganisms and insects. It&#x27;s almost a miracle that it survived — it&#x27;s incredible. There is &#x27;no rational explanation&#x27; for how it was recovered when most of the shuttle was not.&quot; Ramon wrote on the last day of the journal: 
Inscribed in black ink and pencil, it covered the first six days of the 16-day mission.

==Family==
Ramon was survived by his wife, Rona, and their four children: Assaf, Tal, Yiftah, and Noa, who were in Florida at the time of the accident.

===Assaf Ramon===
Ramon&#x27;s eldest son, Assaf (February 10, 1988 – September 13, 2009), died at age 21 during a routine training flight while piloting his F-16A, three months after graduating from the IAF flight school Hatzerim Airbase as the top cadet in his class. Assaf lost consciousness during a spell of vertigo, as a result of the high speed and G-force conditions to which he was subjected. This led to the plane crash and Assaf&#x27;s subsequent death. He was considered an excellent pilot. A lieutenant of the Israeli Air Force, he was posthumously promoted to the rank of captain.

===Rona Ramon===
Ramon&#x27;s widow, Rona Ramon, served in the Israel Defense Forces as a paramedic and later earned a BA at the Wingate Institute. After Assaf&#x27;s death, she returned to university and graduated with a master&#x27;s degree in holistic health at Lesley University, Massachusetts. She also lectured about dealing with grief and finding coping mechanisms. Rona served as founding CEO of the nonprofit Ramon Foundation for youth academic excellence and social leadership through science and technology. She died of pancreatic cancer on December 17, 2018. She was posthoumosly awarded the Israel Prize for lifetime achievement.

===Tal Ramon===
On November 10, 2013, the American Society for Yad Vashem held a special event with the participation of Ramon&#x27;s son, Tal, who performed a song he wrote in memory of his father. Tal Ramon performed his debut album, &quot;Dmut&quot;, at the club Zappa Tel Aviv in 2016.

===Yiftach Ramon===
Ramon’s third son, Yiftach, participated in reality show Hamerotz LaMillion 9 with his friend Sahar, they placed 5th out of 13.

<text>The Arado Ar 80 was a pre-World War II fighter aircraft, designed by Arado Flugzeugwerke to compete for the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;″s first major fighter contract. The Ar 80 was uninspiring in terms of performance and also suffered a number of failures. The contest was eventually won by the Messerschmitt Bf 109, and the Ar 80 prototypes ended their days as test aircraft.

==Design and development==
With the Nazi rise to power in February 1933, a plan was put into place to dramatically expand the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. The new and highly-political &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (RLM) demanded that the large industrial firms cooperate, keeping construction as secret as possible. Arado Flugzeugwerke, under the direction of Erich Serno and Felix Wagenführ, largely stopped being a designer of aircraft and increasingly became a production facility for other companies.

However, the company had just completed the Ar 65 biplane fighter. Several orders were placed for the Ar 65, and a follow-on Ar 68 model. This made Arado one of the few companies with actual fighter design experience, and they were considered for future developments

In 1933, the &quot;Technisches Amt&quot;, the technical department of the RLM, concluded a series of research projects into the future of air combat. One of these was &quot;Rüstungsflugzeug IV&quot; for an all-metal monoplane single-seat fighter aircraft, replacing the Ar 64 and Heinkel He 51 biplanes then in service. The plane needed to have a top speed of 400 km/h (250 mph) at 6,000 m (19,590 ft) which it could maintain for 20 minutes, while staying in the air for a total of 90 minutes. It was to be powered by the new Junkers Jumo 210 engine. It also needed to be armed with at least three machine guns with 1,000 rounds each, or one 20 mm cannon with 200 rounds. The plane needed to keep wing loading below 100 kg/m2, which is a way of defining its ability to turn and climb. The priorities for the plane were level speed, rate of climb, and maneuverability, in that order. Hermann Göring sent out a letter in October 1933 asking for a &quot;high speed courier aircraft&quot; in order to start the work, and in May 1934, the actual R-IV request was sent out and made official. In addition to Heinkel and Arado, Focke-Wulf, and Bayerische Flugzeugwerke competed. They had to deliver three prototypes for head-to-head testing in late 1934.

Although Blume was officially the director of design at Arado, it was Rethel who did most of the early work on the design. Rethel was well aware of the advantages and disadvantages of the monocoque technique, but the company had never built such a design and was thus at a distinct disadvantage in relation to Heinkel who had used it on their He 70 &quot;Blitz&quot; design from 1932.

However he felt that he could not only design a successful monocoque aircraft, but in fact make one that was both lighter and easier to build than the techniques being used at other companies. His solution was to use two sets of skinning plates formed in long strips running front to back along the plane.

The first set of plates was formed roughly into the shape of a C, which a small flange at the open ends of the C where they could be easily riveted to the hoop bulkheads. Using this system he was able to eliminate one more piece of internal structure, the stringers that would normally run between the bulkheads. He used a second set of sheets that were flat, so they could easily bend front-to-back. They were cut into teardrop shapes, which exactly fit into the gaps between the main stringers. Not only did this system allow for the &quot;perfect&quot; aerodynamic shape, but in theory it was also lighter and easier to build. The system looked so hopeful that other parts of the aircraft&#x27;s design were allowed to be heavier and less risky as the weight savings in the fuselage should compensate.

The rest of the plane was conventional. The forward fuselage and inner wings were formed up from steel tubing with removable aluminium sheeting over it, the outer wings were aluminium formers and skinned with aluminium on top and fabric on the bottom. Like the Heinkel designs, the wing included a reverse-gull bend to shorten the landing gear legs, but unlike the Heinkel it was almost straight on the leading and trailing edges instead of the more complex elliptical planform favoured by the Günter brothers.

In order to avoid cutting the outer wing formers with outward retracting gear, Rether decided to have the landing gear retract directly to the rear. To lie flat, the wheel would have to be rotated through 90° as it retracted, with its mainwheel resting atop the lower end of the strut as with the contemporary American Curtiss P-36 Hawk fighter design. To do this, Rethel placed the main oleo strut inside a larger tube that was mounted to the pivot point on the lower leading edge of the box-spar. As the gear retracted a small arm would pull on a lever mounted to the oleo, turning the leg inside the larger tube.

==Prototypes and testing==

The design, now known as the Ar 80, was completed without the aid of Rethel; he left the company in 1934 to join BFW leaving Blume in charge of the project.

The plane was designed to mount the Jumo 210 engine, driving a wooden two-blade fixed-pitch propeller. However, this engine was not going to be ready until the contest was supposed to be over, so all of the contestants looked for other engines to fill the hole. In this case Arado proved to have the advantage, as they had already purchased a 391 kW (525 hp) Rolls-Royce Kestrel VI engine for use on their Ar 67 design. The engine had less than optimal supercharging which led to poor performance for the Ar 67.

The V1 prototype first took to the air in the spring of 1935, one of the first of the planes in the contest to do so. However, one of the company test pilots lost control at low altitude only weeks later, and V1 was written off.

The landing gear had already proven to be a real problem in these few short weeks. It continued to stick half-closed when retracted, although luckily it returned to the down position for landing. Repeated attempts to find the problem were fruitless, when they put the plane on blocks in the hangar it would always work flawlessly. Eventually, it was found that the air pressure on the front of the strut in flight made the oleo jam in its tube so it couldn&#x27;t rotate.

Another problem discovered during construction of the V1 was that Rethel&#x27;s monocoque technique in fact turned out to be much heavier than expected. Some of this was a problem in the actual design; since the sheets ran the length of the plane, they had to be as thick as the thickest point on the entire plane. More traditional designs could use lighter or heavier gauges in various places. The main problem, however, was that the design required considerably more rivets than expected, and as a result the plane was overweight.

V2 was rushed to completion but the Jumo was still unavailable. In order to give the contestants some sort of realistic engine, the RLM had traded Rolls-Royce an He 70 for four 518 kW (695 hp) Kestrel V engines. Although the V was the same basic engine as the VI, it had much better supercharging and was in fact the most powerful inline engine of the day. The various companies competed heavily for access to these engines for their prototypes. Perhaps some idea of the future outcome can be seen in the fact that BFW received two, Arado and Heinkel one each, and Focke-Wulf none at all.

V2 was completed with the Kestrel by autumn of 1937, and started company testing. Once again, the gear proved to be a problem. Blume immediately blamed all of the problems on Rethel, after noting that he was always skeptical of the design. He decided that the performance problems of having fixed gear would be offset by its lighter weight, and the Ar 80 then reverted to using a well-spatted and faired set of gear similar to those used on their various biplane designs. Several months were lost in the conversion.

The use of the fixed gear didn&#x27;t save as much weight as expected and the plane was still 16% over the design weight at 1,630 kg (3,590 lb) empty. Fully loaded the plane was 2,100 kg (4,630 lb) even without armament, which made it underpowered even with the Kestrel V. Drag was also higher than expected. Thus, the plane proved to have very disappointing performance, reaching only 410 km/h (255 mph).

In early 1936, the Jumo engines finally arrived. The 210 had even less takeoff power than the Kestrel, but its altitude performance was comparable. Speed did increase with this engine at higher altitudes, but low-level speed and climb performance both dropped. Arado argued that the fitting of a constant speed propeller would boost both, with the speed climbing to 425 km/h (264 mph), but this was not attempted before the plane was sent off to the contest.

Although the Ar 80 had been one of the first planes to fly, the continued problems with the gear and engine supply meant it was one of the last to arrive for the head-to-head fly-off. It was delivered to Travemünde on 8 February 1936, and later moved to meet the rest of the planes at Rechlin-Lärz Airfield in March. It was clear all along that the plane had no chance against the Heinkel and BFW designs, a fact that Arado was made officially aware of after only one month.

By this point, V3 was already finished. In order to try to save weight, the design had removed the gull-wing and replaced it with a &quot;flat&quot; one, requiring slightly longer gear legs. It also mounted the Jumo 210C with the constant-speed propeller, which boosted speed to 410 km/h (255 mph). By this time, the RLM had already given up on the design, so the plane was not sent for testing and instead hangared at the Arado plant.

In 1937, the V3 was resurrected as a flying testbed for several experiments. It was fitted with a second seat behind the pilot for an observer, and also added an enclosed canopy. The plane was first used for testing a 20 mm cannon firing through the spinner, making it the first German cannon-armed fighter. This system, called the &quot;motorkanone&quot; - an armament format pioneered with the 37 mm cannon-armed French SPAD S.XII in World War I - would become a standard feature of most German inline engined fighter designs during the war.

In 1938, the V3 was rebuilt once again, this time to test a new Fowler Flap design Arado was intending to use on their Ar 198 and Ar 240. Testing showed that the flap was so effective that the lift distribution along the wing changed radically, so a further modification was added to &quot;droop&quot; the ailerons along with the flaps. Testing continued for some time in this form, resulting in the &quot;Arado traveling aileron&quot; and &quot;Arado landing flap&quot;.

<text>Kalpana Chawla (March 17, 1962 – February 1, 2003) was an Indian American astronaut and aerospace engineer who was the first woman of Indian origin to fly to space. Chawla expressed an interest in aerospace engineering from an early age and took engineering classes at Dayal Singh College and Punjab Engineering College in India. She then traveled to the United States, where she earned her MSc and PhD, becoming a naturalized United States citizen in the early 1990s.

She first flew on Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; in 1997 as a mission specialist and robotic arm operator aboard STS-87. Her role in the flight caused some controversy due to the failed deployment of the Shuttle-Pointed Autonomous Research Tool for Astronomy (&quot;Spartan&quot;) module. Chawla&#x27;s second flight was in 2003 on STS-107, the final flight of &quot;Columbia&quot;. She was one of the seven crew members who died in the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster when the spacecraft disintegrated during its reentry into the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere on February 1, 2003.

Chawla was posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor, the NASA Space Flight Medal, and the NASA Distinguished Service Medal. Several buildings, spacecraft, and extraterrestrial landmarks are named in her honor.

==Early life and education==
Kalpana Chawla was born on March 17, 1962, in Karnal, Haryana, India to Banarsi Lal Chawla, the owner of a tire manufacturing plant, and Sanjogta Kharbanda. Her family were Punjabi Hindus originally from Gujranwala, Pakistan who traveled to India as refugees during partition. She had three siblings: sisters Sunita and Dipa and brother Sanjay. As a child, she expressed interest in aerospace engineering, but was dismissed by her father, who said that &quot;only guys want to do [aerospace engineering]&quot; and instead recommended that she become a doctor or teacher. She attended the Tagore Baal Niketan Senior Secondary School in Karnal, graduating in 1976 “near the top of her class”. 

Chawla took basic engineering courses at Dayal Singh College in Karnal. She then attended the aeronautical engineering school at the Punjab Engineering College in Chandigarh, where she learned the principles of theoretical aerodynamics. She was one of four women in the program and the first female student to take aerospace engineering classes at the college. Some professors discouraged her from studying aerospace engineering, claiming that it was not suitable for women and suggesting electrical engineering instead. She graduated from the college in 1982 with a Bachelor of Engineering (BEng).

Because she could not take further specialized aerospace engineering courses in India, Chawla traveled to the United States to continue her education in 1982, again facing opposition from her father. She earned her MSc from the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) in 1984 with her thesis &quot;Optimization of cross flow fan housing for airplane wing installation&quot;. She met her husband, pilot Jean-Pierre Harrison, while at UTA, and the two married on December 2, 1983. 

Chawla then attended the University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder), where she first decided that she wanted to join the space program, receiving her PhD in 1988 with the thesis &quot;Computation of dynamics and control of unsteady vortical flows&quot;. Her thesis director was Chuen-Yen Chow. While attending CU Boulder, Chawla began taking flying lessons at the Boulder Municipal Airport, eventually receiving commercial pilot&#x27;s licenses permitting her to fly various types of land and seaplanes as well as gliders. She later became certified as a flight instructor for single-engine airplanes and flight instruments.

==Career==
===Before NASA===
In 1988, Chawla began working at NASA&#x27;s Ames Research Center, where she initially conducted computational fluid dynamics research on vertical and/or short take-off and landing (V/STOL) concepts. She subsequently studied how to use multiple computers to solve fluid flow problems, testing these methods by calculating powered lift effects. Sometime in the early 1990s, she became a naturalized United States citizen, a requirement for becoming an astronaut.

Chawla joined Overset Methods, Inc, a non-profit research organization based in Los Altos, California, as both a research scientist and the organization&#x27;s vice president in 1993. Her work focused on simulating problems involving multiple moving objects. While in Los Altos, she joined the West Valley Flying Club at the Palo Alto Airport and learned Bharatanatyam from the Abhinaya Dance Company in San Jose. In December 1994, she returned to NASA to undergo training as a candidate astronaut at the Johnson Space Center as part of NASA Astronaut Group 15, eventually being assigned to the EVA and robotics division of the NASA Astronaut Corps in 1995.

===First space mission===

Chawla&#x27;s first space mission began on November 19, 1997, as part of the six-astronaut crew that flew the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; flight STS-87. She served as a mission specialist and a backup flight engineer during takeoff. When STS-87 launched, Chawla became the first woman of Indian origin to go into space. Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral called her to congratulate her on her flight, expressing pride on behalf of the people of India and lauding Chawla for inspiring Indian women and children.

During the mission, Chawla was assigned to deploy one of the shuttle&#x27;s payloads: the Spartan research module. Due to a power surge that damaged its control system, Spartan failed to perform its expected pirouette movement. Chawla attempted to grapple the satellite with the shuttle&#x27;s robotic arm, but did not get a clear signal on the control panel showing it was secured, causing her to move the arm back. In the process, she accidentally hit the Spartan, causing it to spin at two degrees per second. Fellow astronaut Kevin R. Kregel also attempted to grapple the payload by matching its spin with the shuttle&#x27;s, but this movement was ultimately aborted. In the end, a spacewalk was required to retrieve the payload.

Chawla also supervised and performed experiments as part of the fourth United States Microgravity Payload mission (USMP-4). As part of this mission, Chawla studied how to mix liquids evenly to make specific metal combinations that could be used in future computer chips. Using the &quot;Columbia&quot;&#x27;s Middeck Glovebox, she worked with to understand the causes behind their separation.

Some members of the press criticized Chawla for her handling of the Spartan payload, but Kregel refused to assign blame in an interview with the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot;, stating that: 

NASA formed a team to investigate the deployment failure on December 4, 1997. The investigation initially attributed the failure to &quot;crew error&quot;, but Chawla was ultimately exonerated, with the investigators citing insufficient training, errors in software interfaces, and poor communication with ground control as the causes for the incident. In all, as part of the STS-87 mission, Chawla traveled 10.4 million miles in 252 orbits of the Earth, logging more than 376 hours (15 days and 16 hours) in space. 

After the mission, in January 1998, Chawla was given a technical assignment advising shuttle engineers on different aspects of payload development and the astronaut experience. Soon after, she was selected to head the Astronaut Corps&#x27;s Crew Systems and Habitability department.

===Second space mission and death===

On July 27, 2000, Chawla was selected for her second flight as part of the crew of STS-107. STS-107 was delayed 13 times over two years for a variety of reasons, including orbiter maintenance and the discovery of cracks in the shuttle engine flow liners on July 19, 2002. The mission finally launched on January 16, 2003. As the mission&#x27;s flight engineer, she provided assistance to pilot William C. McCool during takeoff. 

STS-107 was a multidisciplinary scientific mission modeled after the previous STS-90. The crew was assigned to two teams working in shifts to ensure that experiments were being conducted nonstop. Chawla worked on the Red Team alongside fellow astronauts Ilan Ramon, Laurel Clark, and Rick Husband. She performed a variety of experiments while in orbit, researching astroculture as well as the properties of combustion, crystal growth, granular materials, and mist. Overall, the crew of STS-107 performed over 80 experiments in a variety of disciplines.

As the flight engineer, Chawla was tasked, alongside mission specialist Clark, with assessing the shuttle&#x27;s system before reentry on February 1. &quot;Columbia&quot; began reentry on 8:44 a.m. on February 1. At 8:54 a.m, four sensors on the shuttle&#x27;s wing failed, and at 9:00 a.m, the shuttle began disintegrating in the sky above Texas, killing all seven crew members aboard. In 2003, a report by the &quot;Columbia&quot; Accident Investigation Board found that a piece of insulating foam broke off of the shuttle&#x27;s external tank during liftoff, striking the left wing of the orbiter. When the &quot;Columbia&quot; began reentry, hot gases entered the damaged wing, leading to the shuttle&#x27;s destruction.

NASA established a team near Hemphill, Texas to search for the remains of the crew. On February 4 or 5, NASA began transporting the recovered remains to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology at Dover Air Force Base. By February 11, all crew member&#x27;s remains had been recovered, including Chawla&#x27;s. A memorial service was held in Hemphill that afternoon. Her remains were ultimately cremated and scattered at Zion National Park.

==Legacy==
Chawla was the recipient of numerous posthumous honors. On February 3, 2003, it was announced that the girls&#x27; hostel at Punjab Engineering College, where Chawla obtained her BEng, would be named after her. A prize consisting of INR ₹25,000, a medal, and a certificate was also created to reward the top students in the aeronautical engineering department. Also in February, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee of India announced that the satellite &quot;MetSat-1&quot; would be renamed &quot;Kalpana-1&quot;. Then in August, Asteroid 51826 Kalpanachawla was named after her, one of seven asteroids named after the &quot;Columbia&quot;&#x27;s crew. The Florida Institute of Technology named one of its residence buildings after Chawla in 2003 as part of &quot;Columbia Village&quot;, which was dedicated to the seven &quot;Columbia&quot; astronauts. Steve Morse of the band Deep Purple released the song &quot;Contact Lost&quot; in 2003 in memory of the &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster. Chawla took three Deep Purple albums on STS-107, using their song &quot;Space Truckin&#x27;&quot; as a wakeup call. One of their albums was found in the shuttle&#x27;s wreckage.

Seven peaks in the Columbia Hills were named after the &quot;Columbia&quot; astronauts on February 2, 2004, with one of them being named after Chawla. Two days later, on February 4, Chawla was posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor by President George W. Bush. She was also awarded the NASA Space Flight Medal, and the NASA Distinguished Service Medal. In March, the Government of Karnataka instituted the &quot;Kalpana Chawla Award&quot; to recognize young female scientists. Then in September, UTA, where Chawla obtained her MSc in 1984, opened &quot;Kalpana Chawla Hall&quot;, also known as &quot;KC Hall&quot;. Chawla&#x27;s father was present for the hall&#x27;s dedication. The lunar crater &quot;Chawla&quot; was named after her in 2006. The Kalpana Chawla Planetarium in Haryana was also dedicated to her in 2007 by Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda. Novelist Peter David named a shuttlecraft, the &quot;Chawla&quot;, after her in his 2007 Star Trek novel, &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation: Before Dishonor&quot;. In 2010, a memorial display was dedicated to Chawla in UTA&#x27;s Nedderman Hall. 

In 2017, the Kalpana Chawla Government Medical College was established in Karnal. Then in 2020, she became the focus of the second season of the National Geographic documentary series &quot;Mega Icons&quot; alongside musician A. R. Rahman, actress Deepika Padukone, and industrialist Ratan Tata. The fourteenth contracted Northrop Grumman Cygnus spacecraft mission, which was launched in October 2020 to deliver supplies to the International Space Station was named the S.S. &quot;Kalpana Chawla&quot; in her honor. A fictionalized version of Chawla appears in the 2023 movie &quot;A Million Miles Away&quot;, where she is played by actress Sarayu Blue.
