<text>Julia Jean &quot;Lana&quot; Turner ( ; February 8, 1921June 29, 1995) was an American actress. Over a career spanning nearly five decades, she achieved fame as both a pin-up model and a film actress, as well as for her highly publicized personal life. In the mid-1940s, she was one of the highest-paid American actresses, and one of MGM&#x27;s biggest stars, with her films earning approximately one billion dollars in 2024 currency for the studio during her 18-year contract with them. Turner is frequently cited as a popular culture icon due to her glamorous persona, and a screen legend of the Golden Age of Hollywood. She was nominated for numerous awards.

Born to working-class parents in Idaho, Turner spent her childhood there before her family relocated to California. In 1936, at the age of 15, she was discovered by a talent scout, while shopping at the Top Hat malt shop in Hollywood. At the age of 16, she was signed to a personal contract by Warner Bros. director Mervyn LeRoy, who took her with him when he transferred to MGM in 1938. She soon attracted attention by playing a murder victim in her screen debut, LeRoy&#x27;s film &quot;They Won&#x27;t Forget&quot; (1937), and she later moved into supporting roles that often cast her as an &quot;ingénue&quot;.

During the early 1940s, Turner established herself as a leading lady, and one of MGM&#x27;s top stars, appearing in such films as the film noir &quot;Johnny Eager&quot; (1941), the musical &quot;Ziegfeld Girl&quot; (1941), the horror &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; (1941), and the romantic war drama &quot;Somewhere I&#x27;ll Find You&quot; (1942), the latter being one of several films in which she starred opposite Clark Gable. Her reputation as a glamorous &quot;femme fatale&quot; was enhanced by her critically acclaimed performance in the film noir &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot; (1946), a role which established her as a serious dramatic actress. Her popularity continued through the 1950s, in dramas such as &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot; (1952) and &quot;Peyton Place&quot; (1957), the latter for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress.

In 1958, intense media scrutiny surrounded Turner when her lover, Johnny Stompanato, was stabbed to death by her teenage daughter, Cheryl Crane, during a domestic struggle in their home. Her next film, &quot;Imitation of Life&quot; (1959), proved to be one of the greatest commercial successes of her career, and her starring role in &quot;Madame X&quot; (1966) earned her a David di Donatello Award for Best Foreign Actress. She spent most of the 1970s in semi-retirement, making her final film appearance in 1980. She accepted a much-publicized, and lucrative, recurring guest role in the television series &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; in 1982, with the series subsequently garnering notably high ratings. She was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1992, and died three years later, at the age of 74.

==Life and career==

===1921–1936: Early life and education===

Julia Jean Turner was born on February 8, 1921, at Providence Hospital in Wallace, Idaho. She was the only child of Mildred Frances Cowan, who hailed from Lamar, Arkansas, and John Virgil Turner, a miner from Montgomery, Alabama. Her mother had English, Irish, and Scottish ancestry, while her father was of Dutch descent. She was born four days before her mother&#x27;s 17th birthday. Her parents had first met while her mother was 14 and her father was 24; Mildred was the daughter of a mine inspector and was visiting Picher, Oklahoma, a trip that was taken so her father could inspect the mines there. Mildred&#x27;s father objected to the courtship, but she and John eloped and moved west before settling in Idaho.

The family lived in Burke, Idaho, at the time of Turner&#x27;s birth, and relocated to nearby Wallace in 1925, where her father opened a dry cleaning service and worked in the local silver mines. As a child, Turner was known to family and friends as Judy. She expressed interest in performance at a young age, performing short dance routines at her father&#x27;s Elks chapter in Wallace. When she was three, she performed an impromptu dance routine at a charity fashion show in which her mother was modeling.

The Turner family struggled financially and relocated to San Francisco when she was six years old, after which her parents separated. On December 14, 1930, her father won some money at a traveling craps game; he stuffed his winnings in his sock and headed home, but was later found bludgeoned to death on the corner of Minnesota and Mariposa Streets, on the edge of San Francisco&#x27;s Potrero Hill and the Dogpatch District, with his left shoe and sock missing. His robbery and homicide were never solved, and his death had a profound effect on Turner. She later said, &quot;I know that my father&#x27;s sweetness and gaiety, his warmth and his tragedy, have never been far from me. That, and a sense of loss and of growing up too fast.&quot;

Turner sometimes lived with family friends or acquaintances so that her impoverished mother could save money. They also frequently moved, for a time living in Sacramento and throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. Following her father&#x27;s death, Turner lived for a period in Modesto with a family who physically abused her and &quot;treated her like a servant&quot;. Her mother worked 80 hours per week as a beautician to support herself and her daughter, and Turner recalled sometimes &quot;living on crackers and milk for half a week&quot;.

While baptized a Protestant at birth, Turner attended Mass with the Hislops, a Catholic family with whom her mother had temporarily boarded her in Stockton, California. She became &quot;thrilled&quot; by the ritual practices of the church, and when she was seven, her mother allowed her to formally convert to Roman Catholicism. Turner subsequently attended the Convent of the Immaculate Conception in San Francisco, hoping to become a nun. In the mid-1930s, Turner&#x27;s mother developed respiratory problems and was advised by her doctor to move to a drier climate, upon which the two moved to Los Angeles in 1936.

===1937–1939: Discovery and early films===
Turner&#x27;s discovery is considered a show-business legend and part of Hollywood mythology among film and popular cultural historians. One version of the story erroneously has her discovery occurring at Schwab&#x27;s Pharmacy, which Turner claimed was the result of a reporting error that began circulating in articles published by columnist Sidney Skolsky. By Turner&#x27;s own account, she was a junior at Hollywood High School when she skipped a typing class and bought a Coca-Cola at the Top Hat Malt Shop located on the southeast corner of Sunset Boulevard and McCadden Place. While in the shop, she was spotted by William R. Wilkerson, publisher of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;. Wilkerson was attracted by her beauty and physique, and asked her if she was interested in appearing in films, to which she responded: &quot;I&#x27;ll have to ask my mother first.&quot; With her mother&#x27;s permission, Turner was referred by Wilkerson to the actor/comedian/talent agent Zeppo Marx. In December 1936, Marx introduced Turner to film director Mervyn LeRoy, who signed her to a $50 weekly contract with Warner Bros. on February 22, 1937 ($ in dollars ). She soon became a protégée of LeRoy, who suggested that she take the stage name Lana Turner, a name she would come to legally adopt several years later.

Turner made her feature film debut in LeRoy&#x27;s &quot;They Won&#x27;t Forget&quot; (1937), a crime drama in which she played a teenage murder victim. Though Turner only appeared on screen for a few minutes, Wilkerson wrote in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; that her performance was &quot;worthy of more than a passing note&quot;. The film earned her the nickname of the &quot;Sweater Girl&quot; for her form-fitting attire, which accentuated her bust. Turner always detested the nickname, and upon seeing a sneak preview of the film, she recalled being profoundly embarrassed and &quot;squirming lower and lower&quot; into her seat. She stated that she had &quot;never seen myself walking before… [It was] the first time [I was] conscious of my body.&quot; Several years after the film&#x27;s release, &quot;Modern Screen&quot; journalist Nancy Squire wrote that Turner &quot;made a sweater look like something Cleopatra was saving for the next visiting Caesar&quot;. Shortly after completing &quot;They Won&#x27;t Forget&quot;, she made an appearance in James Whale&#x27;s historical comedy &quot;The Great Garrick&quot; (1937), a biographical film about British actor David Garrick, in which she had a small role portraying an actress posing as a chambermaid.

In late 1937, LeRoy was hired as an executive at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), and asked Jack L. Warner to allow Turner to relocate with him to MGM. Warner obliged, as he believed Turner would not &quot;amount to anything&quot;. Turner left Warner Bros. and signed a contract with MGM for $100 a week ($ in dollars ). The same year, she was loaned to United Artists for a minor role as a maid in &quot;The Adventures of Marco Polo&quot;. Her first starring role for MGM was scheduled to be an adaptation of &quot;The Sea-Wolf&quot;, co-starring Clark Gable, but the project was eventually shelved. Instead, she was assigned opposite teen idol Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland in the Andy Hardy film &quot;Love Finds Andy Hardy&quot; (1938). During the shoot, Turner completed her studies with an educational social worker, allowing her to graduate high school that year. The film was a box-office success, and her appearance in it as a flirtatious high school student convinced studio head Louis B. Mayer that Turner could be the next Jean Harlow, a sex symbol who had died six months before Turner&#x27;s arrival at MGM.

Mayer helped further Turner&#x27;s career by giving her roles in several youth-oriented films in the late 1930s, such as the comedy &quot;Rich Man, Poor Girl&quot; (1938) in which she played the sister of a poor woman romanced by a wealthy man, and &quot;Dramatic School&quot; (1938), in which she portrayed Mado, a troubled drama student. In the former, she was billed as the &quot;Kissing Bug from the Andy Hardy film&quot;. Upon completing &quot;Dramatic School&quot;, Turner screen-tested unsuccessfully for the role of Scarlett O&#x27;Hara in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939). She was then cast in a supporting part as a &quot;sympathetic bad girl&quot; in &quot;Calling Dr. Kildare&quot; (1939), MGM&#x27;s second entry in the Dr. Kildare series. This was followed by &quot;These Glamour Girls&quot; (1939), a comedy in which she portrayed a taxi dancer invited to attend a dance with a male coed at his elite college. Turner&#x27;s onscreen sex appeal in the film was reflected by a review in the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; in which she was characterized as &quot;the answer to &#x27;oomph. In her next film, &quot;Dancing Co-Ed&quot; (1939), Turner was given first billing portraying Patty Marlow, a professional dancer who enters a college as part of a rigged national talent contest. The film was a commercial success, and led to Turner appearing on the cover of &quot;Look&quot; magazine.

In February 1940, Turner garnered significant publicity when she eloped to Las Vegas with 28-year-old bandleader Artie Shaw, her co-star in &quot;Dancing Co-Ed&quot;. Though they had only briefly known each other, Turner recalled being &quot;stirred by his eloquence&quot;, and after their first date, the two spontaneously decided to get married. Their marriage only lasted four months, but was highly publicized, and led MGM executives to grow concerned over Turner&#x27;s &quot;impulsive behavior&quot;. In the spring of 1940, after the two had divorced, Turner discovered she was pregnant, and had an abortion. In contemporaneous press, it was noted she had been hospitalized for &quot;exhaustion&quot;. She would later recall that Shaw treated her &quot;like an untutored blonde savage, and took no pains to conceal his opinion&quot;. In the midst of her marriage to Shaw, she starred in &quot;We Who Are Young&quot;, a drama in which she played a woman who, against their employer&#x27;s policy, marries her co-worker.

===1940–1945: War years and film stardom===

In 1940, Turner appeared in her first musical film, &quot;Two Girls on Broadway&quot;, in which she received top billing over established co-stars Joan Blondell and George Murphy. A remake of &quot;The Broadway Melody&quot;, the film was marketed as featuring Turner&#x27;s &quot;hottest, most daring role&quot;. The following year, she had a lead role in her second musical, &quot;Ziegfeld Girl&quot;, opposite James Stewart, Judy Garland and Hedy Lamarr. In the film, she portrayed Sheila Regan, an alcoholic aspiring actress based on Lillian Lorraine. &quot;Ziegfeld Girl&quot; marked a personal and professional shift for Turner; she claimed it as the first role that got her &quot;interested in acting&quot;, and the studio, impressed by her performance, marketed the film as featuring her in &quot;the best role of the biggest picture to be released by the industry&#x27;s biggest company&quot;. The film&#x27;s high box-office returns elevated Turner&#x27;s profitability, and MGM gave her a weekly salary raise to $1,500 as well as a personal makeup artist and trailer ($ in dollars ). After completing the film, Turner and co-star Garland remained lifelong friends, and lived in houses next to one another in the 1950s.

Following the success of &quot;Ziegfeld Girl&quot;, Turner took a supporting role as an ingénue in &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; (1941) – a sanitized remake of the original pre-Code film from a decade earlier – remade as a Freudian-influenced horror film, opposite Spencer Tracy and Ingrid Bergman. MGM had initially cast Turner in the lead, but Tracy specifically requested Bergman for the part. The studio recast Turner in the smaller role, though she was still given top billing. While the film was financially successful at the box office, &quot;Time&quot; magazine panned it, calling it &quot;a pretentious resurrection of Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s ghoulish classic ... As for Lana Turner, fully clad for a change, and the rest of the cast ... they are as wooden as their roles.&quot;

Turner was then cast in the Western &quot;Honky Tonk&quot; (1941), the first of four films in which she would star opposite Clark Gable. The Turner-Gable films&#x27; successes were often heightened by gossip-column rumors about a relationship between the two. In January 1942, she began shooting her second picture with Gable, titled &quot;Somewhere I&#x27;ll Find You&quot;; however, the production was halted for several weeks after the death of Gable&#x27;s wife, Carole Lombard, in a plane crash. Meanwhile, the press continued to fuel rumors that Turner and Gable were romantic offscreen, which Turner vehemently denied. &quot;I adored Mr. Gable, but we were [just] friends&quot;, she later recalled. &quot;When six o&#x27;clock came, he went his way and I went mine.&quot; Her next project was &quot;Johnny Eager&quot; (1941), a violent mobster film in which she portrayed a socialite. James Agee of &quot;Time&quot; magazine was critical of co-star Robert Taylor&#x27;s performance and noted: &quot;Turner is similarly handicapped: Metro has swathed her best assets in a toga, swears that she shall become an actress, or else. Under these adverse circumstances, stars Taylor and Turner are working under wraps.&quot;

At the advent of US involvement in World War II, Turner&#x27;s increasing prominence in Hollywood led to her becoming a popular pin-up girl, and her image appeared painted on the noses of U.S. fighter planes, bearing the nickname &quot;Tempest Turner&quot;. In June 1942, she embarked on a 10-week war bond tour throughout the western United States with Gable. During the tour, she began promising kisses to the highest war bond buyers; while selling bonds at the Pioneer Courthouse in Portland, Oregon, she sold a $5,000 bond to a man for two kisses, and another to an elderly man for $50,000. Arriving to sell bonds in her hometown of Wallace, Idaho, she was greeted with a banner that read &quot;Welcome home, Lana&quot;, followed by a large celebration during which the mayor declared a holiday in her honor. Upon completing the tour, Turner had sold $5.25 million in war bonds. Throughout the war, Turner continued to make regular appearances at U.S. troop events and area bases, though she confided to friends that she found visiting the hospital wards of injured soldiers emotionally difficult. During World War II, the Royal Canadian Air Force 427 Lion Squadron had been &quot;adopted&quot; by MGM. Many of the aircraft had dedications or nose art honoring MGM&#x27;s stars. A Handley-Page Halifax bomber &quot;London&#x27;s Revenge&quot; DK186 ZL L carried the name of Lana Turner into battle over Germany.

In July 1942, Turner met her second husband, actor-turned-restaurateur Joseph Stephen &quot;Steve&quot; Crane, at a dinner party in Los Angeles. The two eloped to Las Vegas a week after they began dating. The marriage was annulled by Turner four months later upon discovering that Crane&#x27;s previous divorce had not yet been finalized. After discovering she was pregnant in November 1942, Turner remarried Crane in Tijuana in March 1943. During her early pregnancy, she filmed the comedy &quot;Marriage Is a Private Affair&quot;, in which she starred as a carefree woman struggling to balance her new life as a mother. Though she wanted multiple children, Turner had Rh-negative blood, which caused fetal anemia and made it difficult to carry a child to term. Turner was urged by doctors to undergo a therapeutic abortion to avoid potentially life-threatening complications, but she managed to carry the child to term. She gave birth to a daughter, Cheryl, on July 25, 1943. Turner&#x27;s blood condition resulted in Cheryl being born with near-fatal erythroblastosis fetalis.

Meanwhile, publicity over Turner&#x27;s remarriage to Crane led MGM to play up her image as a sex symbol in the comedy &quot;Slightly Dangerous&quot; (1943), with Robert Young, Walter Brennan and Dame May Whitty, in which she portrayed a woman who moves to New York City and poses as the long-lost daughter of a millionaire. Released in the midst of Turner&#x27;s pregnancy, the film was financially successful but received mixed reviews, with Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; writing: &quot;No less than four Metro writers must have racked their brains for all of five minutes to think up the rags-to-riches fable ... Indeed, there is cause for suspicion that they didn&#x27;t even bother to think.&quot; Critic Anita Loos praised Turner&#x27;s performance in the film, writing: &quot;Lana Turner typifies modern allure. She is the vamp of today as Theda Bara was of yesterday. However, she doesn&#x27;t look like a vamp. She is far more deadly because she lets her audience relax.&quot;

In August 1944, Turner divorced Crane, citing his gambling and unemployment as primary reasons. Turner was among 250 film notables listed by the Hollywood Democratic Committee as supporting the re-election of Democratic Party incumbent President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the 1944 presidential election. In 1945, she co-starred with Laraine Day and Susan Peters in &quot;Keep Your Powder Dry&quot;, a war drama about three disparate women who join the Women&#x27;s Army Corps. She was then cast as the female lead in &quot;Week-End at the Waldorf&quot;, a loose remake of &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; (1932) in which she portrayed a stenographer (a role originated by Joan Crawford). The film was a box-office hit.

===1946–1948: Expansion to dramatic roles===

After the war, Turner was cast in a lead role opposite John Garfield in &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot; (1946), a film noir based on James M. Cain&#x27;s debut novel of the same name. She portrayed Cora, an ambitious woman married to a stodgy, older owner of a roadside diner, who falls in love with a drifter and their desire to be together motivates them to murder her husband. The classic film noir marked a turning point in Turner&#x27;s career as her first femme fatale role. Reviews of the film, including Turner&#x27;s performance, were glowing, with Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; writing it was &quot;the role of her career&quot;. &quot;Life&quot; magazine named the film its &quot;Movie of the Week&quot; in April 1946, and noted that both Turner and Garfield were &quot;aptly cast&quot; and &quot;take over the screen, [creating] more fireworks than the Fourth of July&quot;. Turner commented on her decision to take the role:

&quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot; became a major box office success, which prompted the studio to take more risks on Turner, casting her outside of the glamorous sex-symbol roles for which she had come to be known. In August 1946, it was announced she would replace Katharine Hepburn in the big-budget historical drama &quot;Green Dolphin Street&quot; (1947), a role for which she darkened her hair and lost 15 pounds. The film was produced by Carey Wilson, who insisted on casting Turner based on her performance in &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot;. In the film, she portrayed the daughter of a wealthy patriarch who pursues a relationship with a man in love with her sister. Turner later recalled she was surprised about replacing Hepburn, saying: &quot;I&#x27;m about the most un-Hepburnish actress on the lot. But it was just what I wanted to do.&quot; It was her first starring role that did not center on her looks. In an interview, Turner said: &quot;I even go running around in the jungles of New Zealand in a dress that&#x27;s filthy and ragged. I don&#x27;t wear any make-up and my hair&#x27;s a mess.&quot; Nevertheless, she insisted she would not give up her glamorous image. In the midst of filming &quot;Green Dolphin Street&quot;, Turner began an affair with actor Tyrone Power, whom she considered to be the love of her life. She discovered she was pregnant by him in the fall of 1947, but chose to have an abortion. During this time, she also had romantic affairs with Frank Sinatra and Howard Hughes, the latter of which lasted for 12 weeks in late 1946.

Turner&#x27;s next film was the romantic drama &quot;Cass Timberlane&quot;, in which she played a young woman in love with an older judge – a role for which Jennifer Jones, Vivien Leigh, and Virginia Grey had also been considered. As of early 1946, Turner was set for the role, but schedules with &quot;Green Dolphin Street&quot; almost prohibited her from taking it, and by late 1946, she was nearly recast. Production of &quot;Cass Timberlane&quot; was exhausting for Turner, because it was shot in between retakes of &quot;Green Dolphin Street&quot;. &quot;Cass Timberlane&quot; earned Turner favorable reviews, with &quot;Variety&quot; noting: &quot;Turner is the surprise of the picture via her top performance thespically. In a role that allows her the gamut from tomboy to the pangs of childbirth and from being another man&#x27;s woman to remorseful wife, she seldom fails to acquit herself creditably.&quot;

In August 1947, immediately upon completion of &quot;Cass Timberlane&quot;, Turner agreed to appear as the female lead in the World War II-set romantic drama &quot;Homecoming&quot; (1948), in which she was again paired with Clark Gable, portraying a female army lieutenant who falls in love with an American surgeon (Gable). She was the studio&#x27;s first choice for the role, but it was reluctant to offer her the part, considering her overbooked schedule. &quot;Homecoming&quot; was well received by audiences, and Turner and Gable were nicknamed &quot;the team that generates steam&quot;. By this period, Turner was at the zenith of her film career, and was not only MGM&#x27;s most popular star, but also one of the ten highest-paid women in the United States, with annual earnings of $226,000.

===1948–1952: Studio rebranding and personal struggles===
In late 1947, Turner was cast as Lady de Winter in &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;, her first Technicolor film. Around this time, she began dating Henry J. &quot;Bob&quot; Topping Jr., a millionaire socialite and brother of New York Yankees owner Dan Topping, and a grandson of tin-plate magnate Daniel G. Reid. Topping proposed to her at the 21 Club in New York City by dropping a diamond ring into her martini, and they married shortly after in April 1948 at the Topping family mansion in Greenwich, Connecticut. Turner&#x27;s wedding celebrations interfered with her filming schedule for &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;, and she arrived to the set three days late. Studio head Louis B. Mayer threatened to suspend her contract, but Turner managed to leverage her box-office draw with MGM to negotiate an expansion of her role in the film, as well as a salary increase amounting to $5,000 per week ($ in dollars ). &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; went on to become a box-office success, earning $4.5 million ($ in dollars ), but Turner&#x27;s contract was put on temporary suspension by Mayer after production finished. After the release of &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;, Turner discovered she was pregnant; in early 1949, she went into premature labor and gave birth to a stillborn baby boy in New York City.

In 1949, Turner was to star in &quot;A Life of Her Own&quot; (1950), a George Cukor-directed drama about a woman who aspires to be a model in New York City. The project was shelved for several months, and Turner told journalists in December 1949: &quot;Everybody agrees that the script is still a pile of junk. I&#x27;m anxious to get started. By the time this one comes out, it will be almost three years since I was last on the screen, in &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s healthy to stay off the screen that long.&quot; Although unenthusiastic about the screenplay, Turner agreed to appear in the film after executives promised her suspension would be lifted upon doing so. &quot;A Life of Her Own&quot; was among the least successful of Cukor&#x27;s films, receiving unfavorable reviews and low box-office sales. On May 24, 1950, Turner left her handprints and footprints in cement in front of Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre.

In response to the poor reception for &quot;A Life of Her Own&quot;, MGM attempted to rebrand Turner by casting her in musicals. The first, &quot;Mr. Imperium&quot;, released in March 1951, was a box-office flop, and had Turner starring as an American woman who is wooed by a European prince. &quot;The script was stupid,&quot; she recalled. &quot;I fought against doing the picture, but I lost.&quot; It earned her unfavorable reviews, with one critic from the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; writing: &quot;Without Lana Turner, &quot;Mr. Imperium&quot; ... would be a better picture.&quot;

During this period, Turner&#x27;s personal finances were in disarray, and she was facing bankruptcy. Suffering from depression over her career and financial problems, she attempted suicide in September 1951 by slitting her wrists in a locked bathroom. She was saved by her business manager, Benton Cole, who broke down the bathroom door and called emergency medical services. The following year, she began filming her second musical, &quot;The Merry Widow&quot;. During the shoot, Turner began an affair with her co-star Fernando Lamas, which ended after Lamas physically assaulted her; the incident also caused Lamas to lose his MGM contract upon the production&#x27;s completion. &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; proved more commercially successful than Turner&#x27;s previous musical, &quot;Mr. Imperium&quot;, despite receiving unfavorable critical reviews.

Turner&#x27;s next project was opposite Kirk Douglas in Vincente Minnelli&#x27;s &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot; (1952), a drama focusing on the rise and fall of a Hollywood film mogul, in which Turner portrayed an alcoholic movie star. &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot; was both a critical and commercial success, and earned her favorable reviews. A little over a week before the film&#x27;s release in December 1952, Turner divorced her third husband, Bob Topping. She later claimed Topping&#x27;s drinking problem and excessive gambling as her impetus for the divorce. Her next film project was &quot;Latin Lovers&quot; (1953), a romantic musical in which Lamas had originally been cast. He was replaced by Ricardo Montalbán.

===1953–1957: MGM departure and film resurgence===
In the spring of 1953, Turner relocated to Europe for 18 months to make two films under a tax credit for American productions shot abroad. The films were &quot;Flame and the Flesh&quot;, in which she portrayed a manipulative woman who takes advantage of a musician, and &quot;Betrayed&quot;, an espionage thriller set in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands; the latter marked Turner&#x27;s fourth and final film appearance opposite Clark Gable. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Bosley Crowther wrote of &quot;Betrayed&quot;: &quot;By the time this picture gets around to figuring out whether the betrayer is Miss Turner or Mr. Mature, it has taken the audience through such a lengthy and tedious amount of detail that it has not only frayed all possible tension but it has aggravated patience as well.&quot; Upon returning to the United States in September 1953, Turner married actor Lex Barker, whom she had been dating since their first meeting at a party held by Marion Davies in the summer of 1952.

In 1955, MGM&#x27;s new studio head Dore Schary had Turner star as a pagan temptress in the Biblical epic &quot;The Prodigal&quot; (1955), her first CinemaScope feature. She was reluctant to appear in the film because of the character&#x27;s scanty, &quot;atrocious&quot; costumes and &quot;stupid&quot; lines, and during the shoot struggled to get along with co-star Edmund Purdom, whom she later described as &quot;a young man with a remarkably high opinion of himself&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; deemed the film &quot;a big-scale spectacle ...End result of all this flamboyant polish, however, is only fair entertainment.&quot; Turner was next cast in John Farrow&#x27;s &quot;The Sea Chase&quot; (1955), an adventure film starring John Wayne, in which she portrayed a femme fatale spy aboard a ship. The film, released one month after &quot;The Prodigal&quot;, was a commercial success.

MGM then gave Turner the titular role of Diane de Poitiers in the period drama &quot;Diane&quot; (1956), which had originally been optioned by the studio in the 1930s for Greta Garbo. After completing &quot;Diane&quot;, Turner was loaned to 20th Century-Fox to headline &quot;The Rains of Ranchipur&quot; (1955), a remake of &quot;The Rains Came&quot; (1939), playing the wife of an aristocrat in the British Raj opposite Richard Burton. The production was rushed to accommodate a Christmas release and was completed in only three months, but it received unfavorable reviews from critics. Meanwhile, &quot;Diane&quot; was given a test screening in late December 1955, and was met with poor response from audiences. Though an elaborate marketing campaign was crafted to promote the film, it was a box-office flop, and MGM announced in February 1956 that it was opting not to renew Turner&#x27;s contract. Turner gleefully told a reporter at the time that she was &quot;walking around in a daze. I&#x27;ve been sprung. After 18 years at MGM, I&#x27;m a free agent ...I used to go on a bended knee to the front office and say, please give me a decent story. I&#x27;ll work for nothing, just give me a good story. So what happened? The last time I begged for a good story they gave me &quot;The Prodigal&quot;.&quot; At the time of her contract termination, Turner&#x27;s films had earned the studio more than $50 million.
In 1956, Turner discovered she was pregnant with Barker&#x27;s child, but gave birth to a stillborn baby girl seven months into the pregnancy. In July 1957, she filed for divorce from Barker after her daughter Cheryl alleged that he had regularly molested and raped her over the course of their marriage. According to Cheryl, Turner confronted Barker before forcing him out of their home at gunpoint. Weeks after her divorce, Turner began filming 20th Century-Fox&#x27;s &quot;Peyton Place&quot;, in which she had been cast in the lead role of Constance MacKenzie, a New England mother struggling to maintain a relationship with her teenage daughter. The film, directed by Mark Robson, was adapted from Grace Metalious&#x27; best-selling novel of the same name. Released in December 1957, &quot;Peyton Place&quot; was a major blockbuster success, which worked in Turner&#x27;s favor as she had agreed to take a percentage of the film&#x27;s overall earnings instead of a salary. She also received critical acclaim, with &quot;Variety&quot; noting that &quot;Turner looks elegant&quot; and &quot;registers strongly&quot;, and, for the first and only time, she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Though grateful for the nomination, Turner would later state that she felt it was not &quot;one of my better roles&quot;.

===1958–1959: Johnny Stompanato homicide scandal===
In January 1958, Paramount Pictures released &quot;The Lady Takes a Flyer&quot;, a romantic comedy in which Turner portrayed a female pilot. While shooting the film the previous spring, she had begun receiving phone calls and flowers on the set from mobster Johnny Stompanato, using the name &quot;John Steele&quot;. Stompanato had close ties to the Los Angeles underworld and gangster Mickey Cohen, which he feared would dissuade her from dating him. He pursued Turner aggressively, sending her various gifts. Turner was &quot;thoroughly intrigued&quot; and began casually dating him. After a friend informed her of who Stompanato actually was, she confronted him and tried to break off the affair. Stompanato was not easily deterred, and over the course of the following year, they carried on a relationship filled with violent arguments, physical abuse and repeated reconciliations. Turner would also claim that on one occasion he drugged her and took nude photographs of her while unconscious, potentially to use as blackmail.

In September 1957, Stompanato visited Turner in London, where she was filming &quot;Another Time, Another Place&quot;, co-starring Sean Connery. Their meeting was initially happy, but they soon began fighting. Stompanato became suspicious when Turner would not allow him to visit the set and, during one fight, he violently choked her. To avoid further confrontation, Turner and her makeup artist, Del Armstrong, called Scotland Yard in order to have Stompanato deported. Stompanato got wind of the plan and showed up on the set with a gun, threatening her and Connery. Connery answered by grabbing the gun out of Stompanato&#x27;s hand and twisting his wrist, causing him to run off the set. Turner and Armstrong later returned with two Scotland Yard detectives to the rented house where she and Stompanato were staying. The detectives advised Stompanato to leave and escorted him out of the house and to the airport, where he boarded a plane back to the U.S.

On the evening of March 26, 1958, Turner attended the Academy Awards to observe her nomination for &quot;Peyton Place&quot; and present the award for Best Supporting Actor. Stompanato, angered that he did not attend with her, awaited her return home that evening, whereupon he physically assaulted her. Around 8:00 p.m. on Friday, April 4, Stompanato arrived at Turner&#x27;s rented home at 730 North Bedford Drive in Beverly Hills. The two began arguing heatedly in the bedroom, during which Stompanato threatened to kill Turner, her daughter Cheryl and her mother. Fearing that her mother&#x27;s life was in danger, Cheryl – who had been watching television in an adjacent room – grabbed a kitchen knife and ran to Turner&#x27;s defense.

According to testimony provided by Turner, Stompanato died at the scene when Cheryl, who had been listening to the couple&#x27;s fight behind the closed door, stabbed Stompanato in the stomach when Turner attempted to usher him out of the bedroom. Turner testified that she initially believed Cheryl had punched him, but realized Stompanato had been stabbed when he collapsed and she saw blood on his shirt.

Because of Turner&#x27;s fame and the fact that the killing involved her teenage daughter, the case quickly became a media sensation. More than 100 reporters and journalists attended the April 12, 1958 inquest, described by attendees as &quot;near-riotous&quot;. After four hours of testimony and approximately 25 minutes of deliberation, the jury deemed the killing a justifiable homicide. Cheryl remained a temporary ward of the court until April 24, when a juvenile court hearing was held, during which the judge expressed concerns over her receiving &quot;proper parental supervision&quot;. She was ultimately released to the care of her grandmother, and was ordered to regularly visit a psychiatrist alongside her parents.

Though Turner and her daughter were exonerated of any wrongdoing, public opinion on the event was varied, with numerous publications intimating that Turner&#x27;s testimony at the inquest was a performance; &quot;Life&quot; magazine published a photo of Turner testifying in court along with stills of her in courtroom scenes from three of her films. The scandal also coincided with the release of &quot;Another Time, Another Place&quot;, and the film was met with poor box-office receipts and a lackluster critical response. Stompanato&#x27;s family sought a wrongful death suit of $750,000 in damages against both Turner and her ex-husband, Steve Crane. In the suit, Stompanato&#x27;s son alleged that Turner had been responsible for his death, and that her daughter had taken the blame. The suit was settled out of court for a reported $20,000 in May 1962. A 1962 novel by Harold Robbins entitled &quot;Where Love Has Gone&quot; and its subsequent film adaptation were inspired by the event.

===1959–1965: Financial successes===
In the wake of negative publicity related to Stompanato&#x27;s death, Turner accepted the lead role in Ross Hunter&#x27;s remake of &quot;Imitation of Life&quot; (1959) under the direction of Douglas Sirk. She portrayed a struggling stage actress who makes personal sacrifices to further her career. The production was difficult for Turner given the recent events of her personal life, and she suffered a panic attack on the first day of filming. Her co-star Juanita Moore recalled that Turner cried for three days after filming a scene in which Moore&#x27;s character dies. When she returned to the set, &quot;her face was so swollen, she couldn&#x27;t work&quot;, Moore said.
Released in the spring of 1959, &quot;Imitation of Life&quot; was among the year&#x27;s biggest successes, and the biggest of Turner&#x27;s career; by opting to receive 50% of the film&#x27;s earnings rather than receiving a salary, she earned more than two million dollars. &quot;Imitation of Life&quot; made more than $50 million in box office receipts. Reviews were mixed, although &quot;Variety&quot; praised her performance, writing: &quot;Turner plays a character of changing moods, and her changes are remarkably effective, as she blends love and understanding, sincerity and ambition. The growth of maturity is reflected neatly in her distinguished portrayal.&quot; Critics and audiences could not help noticing that the plots of &quot;Peyton Place&quot; and &quot;Imitation of Life&quot; both seemed to mirror certain parts of Turner&#x27;s private life, resulting in comparisons she found painful. Both films depicted the troubled, complicated relationship between a single mother and her teenage daughter. During this time, Turner&#x27;s daughter Cheryl privately came out as a lesbian to her parents, who were both supportive of her. Despite this, Cheryl ran away from home multiple times and the press wrote about her rebelliousness. Worried she was still suffering from the trauma of Stompanato&#x27;s death, Turner sent Cheryl to the Institute of Living in Hartford, Connecticut.

Shortly before the release of &quot;Imitation of Life&quot; in the spring of 1959, Turner was cast in a lead role in Otto Preminger&#x27;s &quot;Anatomy of a Murder&quot;, but walked off the set over a wardrobe disagreement, effectively dropping out of the production. She was replaced by Lee Remick. Instead, Turner took a lead role as a disturbed socialite in the film noir &quot;Portrait in Black&quot; (1960) opposite Anthony Quinn and Sandra Dee, which was a box-office success despite bad reviews. Ray Duncan of the &quot;Independent Star-News&quot; wrote that Turner &quot;suffers prettily through it all, like a fashion model with a tight-fitting shoe&quot;.

In November 1960, Turner married her fifth husband, Frederick &quot;Fred&quot; May, a rancher and member of the May department-store family whom she had met at a beach party in Malibu shortly after filming &quot;Imitation of Life&quot;. Turner moved in with him on his ranch in Chino, California, where the two took care of horses and other animals. The following year, she made her final film at MGM with Bob Hope in &quot;Bachelor in Paradise&quot; (1961), a romantic comedy about an investigative writer (Hope) working on a book about the wives of a lavish California community; the film received a mostly positive critical reception. Upon completing filming, Turner collected the remaining $92,000 from her pension fund with MGM. The same year, she starred in &quot;By Love Possessed&quot; (1961), based on a bestselling novel by James Gould Cozzens. The film became the first in-flight movie to be shown on a regular basis on a scheduled airline flight when TWA showed it to its first-class passengers.

In mid-1962, Turner filmed &quot;Who&#x27;s Got the Action?&quot;, a comedy in which she portrayed the wife of a gambling addict opposite Dean Martin. In September of that year, Turner and May separated, divorcing shortly after in October. They remained friends throughout her later life. In 1965, she met Hollywood producer and businessman Robert Eaton, who was ten years her junior, through business associates. The two married in June of that year at his family&#x27;s home in Arlington County, Virginia.

===1966–1985: Later films, television and theatre===

In 1966, Turner had her last major starring role in the courtroom drama film &quot;Madame X&quot;, based on the 1904 play by Alexandre Bisson, in which Turner portrayed a lower-class woman who marries into a wealthy family. A review in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; praised her performance, noting: &quot;when she takes the stand in the final (with Keir Dullea) courtroom scene, her face resembling a dust bowl victory garden, it&#x27;s the most devastating denouement since Barbara Fritchie poked her head out the window.&quot; Kaspar Monahan of the &quot;Pittsburgh Press&quot; lauded her performance, writing: &quot;Her performance, I think, is far and away her very best, even rating Oscar consideration in next year&#x27;s Academy Award race, unless the culture snobs gang up against her.&quot; The role earned Turner a David di Donatello Golden Plaque Award for Best Foreign Actress that year.

In late 1968, she began filming the low-budget thriller &quot;The Big Cube&quot;, in which she portrayed a glamorous heiress being dosed with LSD by her stepdaughter in hopes of driving her insane and receiving the family estate. One critic deemed Turner&#x27;s acting in the film &quot;strained and amateurish&quot;, and declared it &quot;one of her poorest performances&quot;. In April 1969, Turner filed for divorce from Eaton after four years of marriage upon discovering he had been unfaithful to her. Weeks later, on May 9, 1969, she married Ronald Pellar, a nightclub hypnotist whom she had met at a Los Angeles disco. According to Turner, Pellar (also known as Ronald Dante or Dr. Dante) falsely claimed to have been raised in Singapore and to have a Ph.D. in psychology.
With few film offers coming in, Turner signed on to appear in the television series &quot;Harold Robbins&#x27; The Survivors&quot;. Premiering in September 1969, the series was given a major national marketing campaign, with billboards featuring life-sized images of Turner. Despite ABC&#x27;s extensive publicity campaign and the presence of other big-name stars, the program fared badly, and it was canceled halfway into the season after a 15-week run in 1970. Meanwhile, after six months of marriage, Turner discovered Pellar had stolen $35,000 she had given him for an investment. In addition, she later accused him of stealing $100,000 worth of jewelry from her. Pellar denied the accusations and no charges were filed against him. She filed for divorce in January 1970, after which she claimed to be celibate for the remainder of her life. Turner married a total of eight times to seven different husbands, and later famously said: &quot;My goal was to have one husband and seven children, but it turned out to be the other way around.&quot;

Turner returned to feature films with a lead role in the 1974 British horror film &quot;Persecution&quot;, in which she played a disturbed wealthy woman tormenting her son. &quot;Variety&quot; noted of her performance: &quot;Under the circumstances, Turner&#x27;s performance as Carrie, the perverted dame of the English manor, has reasonable poise.&quot; In April 1975, Turner spoke at a retrospective gala in New York City examining her career, which was attended by Andy Warhol, Sylvia Miles, Rex Reed and numerous fans. Her next film was &quot;Bittersweet Love&quot; (1976), a romantic drama in which she portrayed the mother of a woman who unwittingly marries her half-brother. Lawrence Van Gelder of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film served &quot;as a reminder that Miss Turner was never one of our subtler actresses&quot;.

In the early 1970s, Turner transitioned to theater, beginning with a production of &quot;Forty Carats&quot;, which toured various East Coast cities in 1971. A review in &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; noted: &quot;Miss Turner always could wear clothes well, and her &quot;Forty Carats&quot; is a fashion show in the guise of a frothy, little comedy. It wasn&#x27;t much of a play even when Julie Harris was doing it, and it all but disappears under the old-time Hollywood glamor of Miss Turner&#x27;s star presence.&quot; In 1975, Turner gave a single performance as Jessica Poole in &quot;The Pleasure of His Company&quot; opposite Louis Jourdan at the Arlington Park Theater in Chicago. From 1976 to 1978, she starred in a touring production of &quot;Bell, Book and Candle&quot;, playing Gillian Holroyd. Critic Elaine Matas noted of a 1977 performance that Turner was &quot;brilliant&quot; and &quot;the bright spot in an otherwise mediocre play&quot;. In the fall of 1978, she appeared in a Chicago production of &quot;Divorce Me, Darling&quot;, an original play in which she portrayed a San Francisco divorce attorney. During rehearsals, a stagehand told reporters that Turner was &quot;the hardest working broad I&#x27;ve known&quot;. Richard Christiansen of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; praised her performance, writing that, &quot;though she is still a very nervous and inexpert actress, she is giving by far her most winning performance&quot;.

Between 1979 and 1980, Turner returned to theater, appearing in &quot;Murder Among Friends&quot;, a murder-mystery play that showed in various U.S. cities. During this time, Turner was in the midst of a self-described &quot;downhill slide&quot;. She was suffering from an alcohol addiction that had begun in the late 1950s, was missing performances and weighed only . In 1980, Turner made her final feature film appearance, in the comedy horror film &quot;Witches&#x27; Brew&quot;, alongside Teri Garr. The same year, she had what she referred to as a &quot;religious awakening&quot;, and again began practicing her Catholic faith. On October 25, 1981, the National Film Society presented Turner with an Artistry in Cinema award. In December 1981, it was announced that Turner would appear as the mysterious Jacqueline Perrault in an episode of &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;, marking her first television role in 12 years. Her appearance was a ratings success, and her character returned for an additional five episodes.

In January 1982, Turner reprised her role in &quot;Murder Among Friends&quot;, which toured throughout the U.S. that year; paired with Bob Fosse&#x27;s &quot;Dancin&#x27;&quot;, the play earned a combined gross of $400,000 during one week at Pittsburgh&#x27;s Heinz Hall in June 1982. In September, Turner released an autobiography entitled &quot;&quot;. She subsequently guest-starred on an episode of &quot;The Love Boat&quot; in 1985, which marked her final on-screen appearance.

==Death==
Turner was a regular drinker and cigarette smoker for most of her life. During her contract with MGM, photographs that showed her holding cigarettes had to be airbrushed at the studio&#x27;s request in an effort to conceal her smoking. In her early sixties Turner stopped drinking to preserve her health, but she was unable to quit smoking. She was diagnosed with throat cancer in the spring of 1992. In a press release, she stated that the cancer had been detected early and had not damaged her vocal cords or larynx. She underwent exploratory surgery to remove the cancer, but it had metastasized to her jaw and lungs. After undergoing radiation therapy, Turner announced that she was in full remission in early 1993. The cancer was found to have returned in July 1994.

In September 1994, Turner made her final public appearance at the San Sebastián International Film Festival in Spain to accept a Lifetime Achievement Award, and used a wheelchair for much of the event. She died nine months later at the age of 74 on June 29, 1995, of complications from the cancer, at her home in Century City, Los Angeles, with her daughter by her side. According to Cheryl, Turner&#x27;s death was a &quot;total shock&quot;, as she had appeared to be in better health and had recently completed seven weeks of radiation therapy.

Turner&#x27;s remains were cremated and given to Cheryl. Multiple accounts have the ashes still in Cheryl&#x27;s possession, while other accounts say the ashes were scattered in the ocean, but which ocean and location varies by the sources. Cheryl and her partner Joyce LeRoy, whom Turner said she accepted &quot;as a second daughter&quot;, inherited some of Turner&#x27;s personal effects and $50,000 in Turner&#x27;s will. Her estate was estimated in court documents to be worth $1.7 million. Turner left the majority of her estate to her maid, Carmen Lopez Cruz, who had been her companion for 45 years and caregiver during her final illness. Cheryl challenged the will, and Cruz said that the majority of the estate was consumed by probate costs, legal fees and medical expenses.

==Public and screen persona==
When Turner was discovered, MGM executive Mervyn LeRoy envisioned her as a replacement for the recently deceased Jean Harlow, and began developing her image as a sex symbol. In &quot;They Won&#x27;t Forget&quot; (1937) and &quot;Love Finds Andy Hardy&quot; (1938), she embodied an &quot;innocent sexuality&quot; portraying ingénues. Film historian Jeanine Basinger notes that she &quot;represented the girl who&#x27;d rather sit on the diving board to show off her figure than get wet in the water ... the girl who&#x27;d rather kiss than kibbitz&quot;. In her early films, Turner did not color her auburn hair — see &quot;Dancing Co-Ed&quot; (1939), in which she was billed &quot;the red-headed sensation who brought &quot;it&quot; back to the screen&quot;. 1941&#x27;s &quot;Ziegfeld Girl&quot; was the first film to showcase Turner with platinum blonde hair, which she wore for much of the remainder of her life, and for which she came to be known.
After Turner&#x27;s first marriage in 1940, columnist Louella Parsons wrote: &quot;If Lana Turner will behave herself, and not go completely berserk she is headed for a top spot in motion pictures. She is the most glamorous actress since Jean Harlow.&quot; She also likened her to Clara Bow, adding: &quot;Both of them, trusting and lovable, use their hearts, instead of their heads. Lana ... has always acted hastily and been guided more by her own ideas than by any advance any studio gave her.&quot; By the mid-1940s, Turner had been married and divorced three times, had given birth to her daughter, Cheryl, and had numerous publicized affairs. However, her image in 1946&#x27;s &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot; marked a departure from her strictly-sex symbol screen persona to that of a full-fledged femme fatale.

By the 1950s, both critics and audiences began noting parallels between Turner&#x27;s rocky personal life and the roles she played. The likeness was most evident in &quot;Peyton Place&quot; and &quot;Imitation of Life&quot;, both films in which Turner portrayed single mothers struggling to maintain relationships with their teenage daughters. Film scholar Richard Dyer cites Turner as an example of one of Hollywood&#x27;s earliest stars whose publicized private life perceptibly inflected their careers: &quot;Her career is marked by an unusually, even spectacularly, high degree of inter-penetration between her publicly available private life and her films ... not only do her vehicles furnish characters and situations in accord with her off-screen image, but frequently, incidents in them echo incidents in her life, so that, by the end of her career, films like &quot;Peyton Place&quot;, &quot;Imitation of Life&quot;, &quot;Madame X&quot;, and &quot;Love Has Many Faces&quot; seem in parts like mere illustrations of her life.&quot;

Basinger echoes similar sentiments, noting that Turner was often &quot;cast only in roles that were symbolic of what the public knew — or thought they knew — of her life from headlines she made as a person, not as a movie character ... Her person became her persona.&quot; In addition, Basinger credits Turner as the first mainstream female star to &quot;take the male prerogative openly for herself&quot;, publicly indulging in romances and affairs that, in turn, fueled the publicity surrounding her. Film scholar Jessica Hope Jordan considers Turner an &quot;implosion&quot; of both a &quot;real-life image and star image&quot;, and suggests that she utilized one to mask the other, thus rendering her representative of the &quot;ultimate femme fatale&quot;. Columnist Dorothy Kilgallen took note of the intersections between Turner&#x27;s life and screen persona early in her career, writing in 1946:


Historians have cited Turner as one of the most glamorous film stars of all time, an association that was made both during her lifetime and after her death. Commenting on her image, she once told a journalist: &quot;Forsaking glamour is like forsaking my identity. It&#x27;s an image I&#x27;ve worked too hard to obtain and to preserve.&quot; Michael Gordon, who directed Turner in &quot;Portrait in Black&quot;, remembered her as &quot;a very talented actress whose chief reliability was what I regarded as impoverished taste ... Lana was not a dummy, and she would give me wonderful rationalizations why she should wear pendant earrings. They had nothing to do with the role, but they had to do with her particular self-image.&quot;

According to her daughter, Turner&#x27;s obsessive attention to detail often resulted in dressmakers storming out during dress fittings. No matter the setting, Turner also took care to ensure she was always &quot;camera-ready&quot;, wearing jewelry and make-up even while lounging in sweatpants. Turner often purchased her favorite styles of shoes in every available color, at one time accumulating 698 pairs. She favored the designers Salvatore Ferragamo, Jean Louis, Helen Rose, and Nolan Miller. Film historians Joe Morella and Edward Epstein have observed that, unlike many female stars, Turner &quot;wasn&#x27;t resented by female fans&quot;, and that women made up a large part of her fan base in later years. Turner maintained her glamorous image into her late career; a 1966 film review characterized her as &quot;the glitter and glamour of Hollywood&quot;. While she consistently embraced her glamorous persona, she was also vocal about her dedication to acting, and attained a reputation as a versatile, hard-working performer. She was an admirer of Bette Davis, whom she cited as her favorite actress.

==Legacy==

Turner has been noted by historians as a sex symbol, a popular culture icon and &quot;a symbol of the American Dream fulfilled ... Because of her, being discovered at a soda fountain has become almost as cherished an ideal as being born in a log cabin.&quot; Critic Leonard Maltin noted in 2005 that Turner &quot;came to crystallize the opulent heights to which show business could usher a small-town girl, as well as its darkest, most tragic and narcissistic depths&quot;. She has also been cited by scholars as a gay icon because of her diva persona and triumphs over personal struggles. While discussions surrounding Turner have largely been based on her cultural prevalence, little scholarly study has been undertaken on her career, and opinion of her legacy as an actress has divided critics. Upon Turner&#x27;s death, John Updike wrote in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that she &quot;was a faded period piece, an old-fashioned glamour queen whose fifty-four films, over four decades didn&#x27;t amount, retrospectively to much ... As a performer, she was purely a studio-made product.&quot;

Defenders of Turner&#x27;s acting ability, such as Jessica Hope Jordan and James Robert Parish, cite her performance in &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot; as an argument for the value of her work. Turner&#x27;s role in the film has also caused her to be frequently associated with film noir and the femme fatale archetype in critical circles. In a 1973 &quot;Films in Review&quot; retrospective on her career, Turner was referred to as &quot;a master of the motion picture technique and a hardworking craftsman&quot;. Jeanine Basinger has similarly championed Turner&#x27;s acting, writing of her performance in &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot;: &quot;None of the sex symbols who have been touted as actresses—not Hayworth or Gardner or Taylor or Monroe—have ever given such a fine performance.&quot;

Because of the intersections between Turner&#x27;s high-profile, glamorous persona, and storied, often troubled personal life, she is included in critical discussions about the Hollywood studio system, specifically its capitalization on its stars&#x27; private travails. Basinger considers her the &quot;epitome of the Hollywood machine-made stardom&quot;. Turner has also been cited in scholarly discussions of women&#x27;s sexuality.

Turner has been depicted and referenced in numerous works across literature, film, music and art. She was the subject of the poem &quot;Lana Turner has collapsed&quot; by Frank O&#x27;Hara, and was depicted as a minor character in James Ellroy&#x27;s novel &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; (1990). The Stompanato murder and its aftermath were also the basis of the Harold Robbins novel &quot;Where Love Has Gone&quot; (1962). In popular music, Turner was referenced in songs recorded by Nina Simone and Frank Sinatra, and was the source of the stage name of singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey. In 2002, artist Eloy Torrez included Turner in an outdoor mural, &quot;Portrait of Hollywood&quot;, painted on the auditorium of Hollywood High School, her alma mater. Turner has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6241 Hollywood Boulevard. In 2012, &quot;Complex&quot; named her the eighth-most infamous actress of all time.

<text>Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher (; ; 21 November 1768 – 12 February 1834) was a German Reformed theologian, philosopher, and biblical scholar known for his attempt to reconcile the criticisms of the Enlightenment with traditional Protestant Christianity. He also became influential in the evolution of higher criticism, and his work forms part of the foundation of the modern field of hermeneutics. Because of his profound effect on subsequent Christian thought, he is often called the &quot;Father of Modern Liberal Theology&quot; and is considered an early leader in liberal Christianity. The neo-orthodoxy movement of the twentieth century, typically (though not without challenge) seen to be spearheaded by Karl Barth, was in many ways an attempt to challenge his influence. As a philosopher he was a leader of German Romanticism. 

== Biography ==

=== Early life and development ===
Born in Breslau in Prussian Silesia as the grandson of Daniel Schleiermacher, a pastor at one time associated with the Zionites, and the son of Gottlieb Schleiermacher, a Reformed Church chaplain in the Prussian army, Schleiermacher started his formal education in a Moravian school at Niesky in Upper Lusatia, and at Barby near Magdeburg. However, pietistic Moravian theology failed to satisfy his increasing doubts, and his father reluctantly gave him permission to enter the University of Halle, which had already abandoned pietism and adopted the rationalist spirit of Christian Wolff and Johann Salomo Semler. As a theology student, Schleiermacher pursued an independent course of reading and neglected the study of the Old Testament and of Oriental languages. However, he attended the lectures of Semler and became acquainted with the techniques of historical criticism of the New Testament, and of Johann Augustus Eberhard from whom he acquired a love of the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle. At the same time, he studied the writings of Immanuel Kant and Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi and began to apply ideas from the Greek philosophers to a reconstruction of Kant&#x27;s system.

Schleiermacher developed a deep-rooted skepticism as a student and soon rejected orthodox Christianity.

Brian Gerrish, a scholar of the works of Schleiermacher, wrote:

Schleiermacher confessed: &quot;Faith is the regalia of the Godhead, you say. Alas! dearest father, if you believe that without this faith no one can attain to salvation in the next world, nor to tranquility in this—and such, I know, is your belief—oh! then pray to God to grant it to me, for to me it is now lost. I cannot believe that he who called himself the Son of Man was the true, eternal God; I cannot believe that his death was a vicarious atonement.&quot;

=== Tutoring, chaplaincy and first works ===

At the completion of his course at Halle, Schleiermacher became the private tutor to the family of Friedrich Alexander Burggraf und Graf zu Dohna-Schlobitten (1741–1810), developing in a cultivated and aristocratic household his deep love of family and social life. Two years later, in 1796, he became chaplain to the Charité Hospital in Berlin. Lacking scope for the development of his preaching skills, he sought mental and spiritual satisfaction in the city&#x27;s cultivated society and in intensive philosophical studies, beginning to construct the framework of his philosophical and religious system. Here Schleiermacher became acquainted with art, literature, science and general culture. He was strongly influenced by German Romanticism, as represented by his friend Karl Wilhelm Friedrich von Schlegel. That interest is borne out by his &quot;Confidential Letters on Schlegel&#x27;s Lucinde&quot; as well as by his seven-year relationship (1798–1805) with Eleonore Christiane Grunow (née Krüger) (1769/1770–1837), the wife of Berlin clergyman August Christian Wilhelm Grunow (1764–1831).

Though his ultimate principles remained unchanged, he placed more emphasis on human emotion and the imagination. Meanwhile, he studied Spinoza and Plato, both of whom were important influences. He became more indebted to Kant though they differed on fundamental points. He sympathised with some of Jacobi&#x27;s positions, and took some ideas from Fichte and Schelling. The literary product of that period of rapid development was his influential book, &quot;Reden über die Religion&quot; (&quot;On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured Despisers&quot;), and his &quot;new year&#x27;s gift&quot; to the new century, the &quot;Monologen&quot; (&quot;Soliloquies&quot;).

In the first book, Schleiermacher gave religion an unchanging place among the divine mysteries of human nature, distinguished it from what he regarded as current caricatures of religion and described the perennial forms of its manifestation. That established the programme of his subsequent theological system. In the &quot;Monologen&quot;, he revealed his ethical manifesto in which he proclaimed his ideas on the freedom and independence of the spirit and on the relationship of the mind to the sensual world, and he sketched his ideal of the future of the individual and of society.

=== Pastorship ===
From 1802 to 1804, Schleiermacher served as a pastor of a small Reformed church in the Pomeranian town of Stolp. He relieved Friedrich Schlegel entirely of his nominal responsibility for the translation of Plato, which they had together undertaken (vols. 1–5, 1804–1810; vol. 6, Repub. 1828). Another work, &quot;Grundlinien einer Kritik der bisherigen Sittenlehre&quot; [Outlines of a Critique of the Doctrines of Morality to date] (1803), the first of his strictly critical and philosophical productions, occupied him; it is a criticism of all previous moral systems, including those of Kant and Fichte: Plato&#x27;s and Spinoza&#x27;s find most favour. It contends that the tests of the soundness of a moral system are the completeness of its view of the laws and ends of human life as a whole and the harmonious arrangement of its subject-matter under one fundamental principle. Although it is almost exclusively critical and negative, the book announces Schleiermacher&#x27;s later view of moral science, attaching prime importance to a &quot;Güterlehre&quot;, or doctrine of the ends to be obtained by moral action. The obscurity of the book&#x27;s style and its negative tone prevented immediate success.

=== Professorship ===
In 1804, Schleiermacher moved to become university preacher and professor of theology to the University of Halle, where he remained until 1807. He quickly obtained a reputation as professor and preacher and exercised a powerful influence in spite of charges of atheism, Spinozism and pietism. In this period, he began his lectures on hermeneutics (1805–1833) and he also wrote his dialogue the &quot;Weihnachtsfeier&quot; (&quot;Christmas Eve: Dialogue on the Incarnation&quot;, 1806), which represents a midway point between his &quot;Speeches&quot; and his great dogmatic work, &quot;Der christliche Glaube&quot; (&quot;The Christian Faith&quot;); the speeches represent phases of his growing appreciation of Christianity as well as the conflicting elements of the theology of the period. After the Battle of Jena, he returned to Berlin (1807), was soon appointed pastor of the Trinity Church and, on 18 May 1809, married Henriette von Willich (née von Mühlenfels; 1788–1840), the widow of his friend Johann Ehrenfried Theodor von Willich (1777–1807).

At the foundation of the University of Berlin (1810), in which he took a prominent part, Schleiermacher obtained a theological chair and soon became secretary to the Prussian Academy of Sciences. He took a prominent part in the reorganization of the Prussian church and became the most powerful advocate of the union of the Lutheran and Reformed divisions of German Protestantism, paving the way for the Prussian Union of Churches (1817). The 24 years of his professional career in Berlin began with his short outline of theological study (&quot;Kurze Darstellung des theologischen Studiums&quot;, 1811) in which he sought to do for theology what he had done for religion in his &quot;Speeches&quot;.

While he preached every Sunday, Schleiermacher also gradually took up in his lectures in the university almost every branch of theology and philosophy: New Testament exegesis, introduction to and interpretation of the New Testament, ethics (both philosophic and Christian), dogmatic and practical theology, church history, history of philosophy, psychology, dialectics (logic and metaphysics), politics, pedagogy, aesthetics and translation.

In politics, Schleiermacher supported liberty and progress, and in the period of reaction that followed the overthrow of Napoleon, he was charged by the Prussian government with &quot;demagogic agitation&quot; in conjunction with the patriot Ernst Moritz Arndt.

At the same time, Schleiermacher prepared his chief theological work, &quot;Der christliche Glaube nach den Grundsätzen der evangelischen Kirche&quot; (1821–1822; 2nd ed., greatly altered, 1830–1831; 6th ed., 1884; &quot;The Christian faith according to the principles of the evangelical church&quot;). Its fundamental principle is that the source and the basis of dogmatic theology are the religious feeling, the sense of absolute dependence on God as communicated by Jesus through the church, not the creeds or the letter of Scripture or the rationalistic understanding. The work is therefore simply a description of the facts of religious feeling, or of the inner life of the soul in its relations to God, and the inward facts are looked at in the various stages of their development and presented in their systematic connection. The aim of the work was to reform Protestant theology, to put an end to the unreason and superficiality of both supernaturalism and rationalism, and to deliver religion and theology from dependence on perpetually changing systems of philosophy.

Though the work added to the reputation of its author, it aroused the increased opposition of the theological schools it was intended to overthrow, and at the same time, Schleiermacher&#x27;s defence of the right of the church to frame its own liturgy in opposition to the arbitrary dictation of the monarch or his ministers brought him fresh troubles. He felt isolated although his church and his lecture-room continued to be crowded.

Schleiermacher continued with his translation of Plato and prepared a new and greatly-altered edition of his &quot;Christlicher Glaube&quot;, anticipating the latter in two letters to his friend Gottfried Lücke (in the &quot;Studien und Kritiken&quot;, 1829) in which he defended his theological position generally and his book in particular against opponents on both the right and the left.

The same year, Schleiermacher lost his only son, Nathaniel (1820–1829), a blow that he said &quot;drove the nails into his own coffin&quot;, but he continued to defend his theological position against Hengstenberg&#x27;s party and the rationalists Daniel Georg Konrad von Cölln (1788–1833) and David Schulz (1779–1854), protesting against both subscription to the ancient creeds and the imposition of a new rationalistic formulary.

=== Death ===

Schleiermacher died at 65 of pneumonia on 12 February 1834.

== Work ==

=== Doctrine of knowledge ===
Schleiermacher&#x27;s psychology takes as its basis the phenomenal dualism of the ego and the non-ego, and regards the life of man as the interaction of these elements with their interpenetration as its infinite destination. The dualism is therefore not absolute, and, though present in man&#x27;s own constitution as composed of body and soul, is relative only even there. The ego is itself both body and soul — the conjunction of both constitutes it. Our &quot;organization&quot; or sense nature has its intellectual element, and our &quot;intellect&quot; its organic element, and there is no such thing as &quot;pure mind&quot; or &quot;pure body.&quot; The one general function of the ego, thought, becomes in relation to the non-ego either receptive or spontaneous action, and in both forms of action its organic, or sense, and its intellectual energies co-operate; and in relation to man, nature and the universe the ego gradually finds its true individuality by becoming a part of them, &quot;every extension of consciousness being higher life.&quot;

The specific functions of the ego, as determined by the relative predominance of sense or intellect, are either functions of the senses (or organism) or functions of the intellect. The former fall into the two classes of feelings (subjective) and perceptions (objective); the latter, according as the receptive or the spontaneous element predominates, into cognition and volition. In cognition, thought is ontologically oriented to the object; and in volition it is the teleological purpose of thought. In the first case we receive (in our fashion) the object of thought into ourselves. In the latter we plant it out into the world. Both cognition and volition are functions of thought as well as forms of moral action.

It is in those two functions that the real life of the ego is manifested, but behind them is self-consciousness permanently present, which is always both subjective and objective — consciousness of ourselves and of the non-ego. This self-consciousness is the third special form or function of thought — which is also called feeling and immediate knowledge. In it we cognize our own inner life as affected by the non-ego. As the non-ego helps or hinders, enlarges or limits, our inner life, we feel pleasure or pain. Aesthetic, moral and religious feelings are respectively produced by the reception into consciousness of large ideas — nature, mankind and the world; those feelings are the sense of being one with these vast objects. Religious feeling therefore is the highest form of thought and of life; in it we are conscious of our unity with the world and God; it is thus the sense of absolute dependence.

Schleiermacher&#x27;s doctrine of knowledge accepts the fundamental principle of Kant that knowledge is bounded by experience, but it seeks to remove Kant&#x27;s skepticism as to knowledge of the &quot;ding an sich&quot; (the &quot;noumenon&quot;) or &quot;Sein&quot;, as Schleiermacher&#x27;s term is. The idea of knowledge or scientific thought as distinguished from the passive form of thought — of aesthetics and religion — is thought which is produced by all thinkers in the same form and which corresponds to being. All knowledge takes the form of the concept (&quot;Begriff&quot;) or the judgment (&quot;Urteil&quot;), the former conceiving the variety of being as a definite unity and plurality, and the latter simply connecting the concept with certain individual objects.

In the concept, therefore, the intellectual and in the judgment the organic or sense element predominates. The universal uniformity of the production of judgments presupposes the uniformity of our relations to the outward world, and the uniformity of concepts rests similarly on the likeness of our inward nature. This uniformity is not based on the sameness of either the intellectual or the organic functions alone, but on the correspondence of the forms of thought and sensation with the forms of being. The essential nature of the concept is that it combines the general and the special, and the same combination recurs in being; in being the system of substantial or permanent forms answers to the system of concepts and the relation of cause and effect to the system of judgments, the higher concept answering to &quot;force&quot; and the lower to the phenomena of force, and the judgment to the contingent interaction of things.

The sum of being consists of the two systems of substantial forms and interactional relations, and it reappears in the form of concept and judgment, the concept representing being and the judgment being in action. Knowledge has under both forms the same object, the relative difference of the two being that when the conceptual form predominates we have speculative science and when the form of judgment prevails we have empirical or historical science. Throughout the domain of knowledge the two forms are found in constant mutual relations, another proof of the fundamental unity of thought and being or of the objectivity of knowledge. Plato, Spinoza and Kant had contributed characteristic elements of their thought to this system, and directly or indirectly it was largely indebted to Schelling for fundamental conceptions.

=== Hermeneutics ===
While Schleiermacher did not publish extensively on hermeneutics during his lifetime, he lectured widely on the field. His published and unpublished writings on the subject were collected together after his death and published in 1838 as &quot;Hermeneutik und Kritik mit besonderer Beziehung auf das Neue Testament&quot;. However, it was not until Heinz Kimmerle&#x27;s 1959 edition &quot;based on a careful transcription of the original handwritten manuscripts, that an assured and comprehensive overview of Schleiermacher&#x27;s theory of hermeneutics became possible.&quot; 

Schleiermacher wanted to shift hermeneutics away from specific methods of interpretation (e.g. methods for interpreting biblical or classical texts) and toward a focus on how people understand texts in general. He was interested in interpreting Scripture, but he thought one could do so properly only after establishing a system of interpretation that was applicable to all texts. This process was not a systematic or strictly philological approach, but what he called &quot;the art of understanding.&quot; Schleiermacher viewed a text as a vehicle that an author used to communicate thoughts that he had had before creating the text. These thoughts were what caused the author to produce the text; at the moment of text creation, these &quot;inner thoughts&quot; become &quot;outer expression&quot; in language. In order to interpret a text, then, the interpreter must consider both the inner thoughts of the author and the language that s/he used in writing the text. In other words, the reader must submerge himself in the realities of the object of understanding (the text). This approach to interpreting texts involves both &quot;grammatical interpretation&quot; and &quot;psychological (or technical) interpretation.&quot; The former deals with the language of the text; the latter with the thoughts, emotions, intentions and aims of the author.

The language used by an author &quot;is what mediates sensuously and externally between utterer and listener&quot;. The ultimate goal of hermeneutics for Schleiermacher is &quot;understanding in the highest sense&quot;— experiencing the same thoughts that the author experienced when writing the text which he identified as submerging Understanding is a historical process involving learning about the context in which the author wrote, and how the text&#x27;s original readership understood its language. Understanding is also a psychological process drawing upon intuition and a connection between interpreter and the author. Reader and author are both human. As humans, they have some degree of shared understanding. That shared understanding is what makes it possible for a reader to understand an author. 

Part of the art of understanding is the art of avoiding misunderstanding. Schleiermacher identifies two forms of misunderstanding. &quot;Qualitative misunderstanding&quot; is a failure of grammatical interpretation— failing to understand the language of the text— &quot;the confusion of the meaning of a word for another.&quot; &quot;Quantitative misunderstanding&quot; a failure of technical/psychological interpretation— misunderstanding the nuance in the author’s own &quot;sphere.&quot; 

In studying the language that an author uses to present his/her thoughts, an interpreter may be able to understand these thoughts even better than the author him/herself. This can be done by discovering why a particular work was produced, and by discovering unity within other works produced in a similar genre by others, or unity in other works by the same author in any genre. 

Despite Schleiermacher’s claim to the possibility of understanding of the author’s thoughts better than the author, he grants that &quot;good interpretation can only be approximated&quot; and that hermeneutics is not a &quot;perfect art.&quot; The art puts the interpreter in the best position by &quot;putting oneself in possession of all the conditions of understanding.&quot; However, the extent of an interpreter’s understanding of a text is limited by the possibility of misunderstanding the text.

Schleiermacher&#x27;s work had a profound impact on the field of hermeneutics, so much so that he is often referred to as &quot;the father of modern hermeneutics as a general study.&quot; His work marks the beginning of hermeneutics as a general field of inquiry, separate from specific disciplines (e.g. law or theology). In the twentieth century, philosophers such as Heidegger, Gadamer, and Ricoeur would expand hermeneutics even further, from a theory of interpretation of textual expressions into a theory of interpretation of lived experiences.

=== Ethics ===

Next to religion and theology, Schleiermacher devoted himself to the moral world, of which the phenomena of religion and theology were, in his systems, only constituent elements. In his earlier essays he endeavoured to point out the defects of ancient and modern ethical thinkers, particularly of Kant and Fichte, with only Plato and Spinoza finding favour in his eyes. He failed to discover in previous moral systems any necessary basis in thought, any completeness as regards the phenomena of moral action, any systematic arrangement of its parts and any clear and distinct treatment of specific moral acts and relations.

Schleiermacher&#x27;s own moral system is an attempt to supply these deficiencies. It connects the moral world by a deductive process with the fundamental idea of knowledge and being; it offers a view of the entire world of human action which at all events aims at being exhaustive; it presents an arrangement of the matter of the science which tabulates its constituents after the model of the physical sciences; and it supplies a sharply defined treatment of specific moral phenomena in their relation to the fundamental idea of human life as a whole. Schleiermacher defines ethics as the theory of the nature of the reason, or as the scientific treatment of the effects produced by human reason in the world of nature and man.

As a theoretical or speculative science it is purely descriptive and not practical, being correlated on the one hand to physical science and on the other to history. Its method is the same as that of physical science, being distinguished from the latter only by its matter. The ontological basis of ethics is the unity of the real and the ideal, and the psychological and actual basis of the ethical process is the tendency of reason and nature to unite in the form of the complete organization of the latter by the former. The end of the ethical process is that nature (i.e. all that is not mind, the human body as well as external nature) may become the perfect symbol and organ of mind.

Conscience, as the subjective expression of the presupposed identity of reason and nature in their bases, guarantees the practicability of our moral vocation. Nature is preordained or constituted to become the symbol and organ of mind, just as mind is endowed with the impulse to realize this end. But the moral law must not be conceived under the form of an &quot;imperative&quot; or a &quot;Sollen&quot;; it differs from a law of nature only as being descriptive of the fact that it ranks the mind as conscious will, or &quot;Zweckdenken&quot;, above nature. Strictly speaking, the antitheses of good and bad and of free and necessary have no place in an ethical system, but simply in history, which is obliged to compare the actual with the ideal, but as far as the terms &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; are used in morals they express the rule or the contrary of reason, or the harmony or the contrary of the particular and the general. The idea of free as opposed to necessary expresses simply the fact that the mind can propose to itself ends, though a man cannot alter his own nature.

In contrast to Kant and Fichte and modern moral philosophers, Schleiermacher reintroduced and assigned pre-eminent importance to the doctrine of the &quot;summum bonum&quot;, or highest good. It represents in his system the ideal and aim of the entire life of man, supplying the ethical view of the conduct of individuals in relation to society and the universe, and therewith constituting a philosophy of history at the same time. Starting with the idea of the highest good and of its constituent elements (&quot;Güter&quot;), or the chief forms of the union of mind and nature, Schleiermacher&#x27;s system divides itself into the doctrine of moral ends, the doctrine of virtue and the doctrine of duties; in other words, as a development of the idea of the subjection of nature to reason it becomes a description of the actual forms of the triumphs of reason, of the moral power manifested therein and of the specific methods employed. Every moral good or product has a fourfold character: it is individual and universal; it is an organ and symbol of the reason, that is, it is the product of the individual with relation to the community, and represents or manifests as well as classifies and rules nature.

The first two characteristics provide for the functions and rights of the individual as well as those of the community or race. Though a moral action may have these four characteristics at various degrees of strength, it ceases to be moral if one of them is quite absent. All moral products may be classified according to the predominance of one or the other of these characteristics. Universal organizing action produces the forms of intercourse, and universal symbolizing action produces the various forms of science; individual organizing action yields the forms of property and individual symbolizing action the various representations of feeling, all these constituting the relations, the productive spheres, or the social conditions of moral action. Moral functions cannot be performed by the individual in isolation but only in his relation to the family, the state, the school, the church, and society — all forms of human life which ethical science finds to its hand and leaves to the science of natural history to account for. The moral process is accomplished by the various sections of humanity in their individual spheres, and the doctrine of virtue deals with the reason as the moral power in each individual by which the totality of moral products is obtained.

Schleiermacher classifies the virtues under the two forms of &quot;Gesinnung&quot; (&quot;disposition, attitude&quot;) and &quot;Fertigkeit&quot; (&quot;dexterity, proficiency&quot;), the first consisting of the pure ideal element in action and the second the form it assumes in relation to circumstances, each of the two classes falling respectively into the two divisions of wisdom and love and of intelligence and application. In his system the doctrine of duty is the description of the method of the attainment of ethical ends, the conception of duty as an imperative, or obligation, being excluded, as we have seen. No action fulfills the conditions of duty except as it combines the three following antitheses: reference to the moral idea in its whole extent and likewise to a definite moral sphere; connection with existing conditions and at the same time absolute personal production; the fulfillment of the entire moral vocation every moment though it can only be done in a definite sphere. Duties are divided with reference to the principle that every man make his own the entire moral problem and act at the same time in an existing moral society. This condition gives four general classes of duty: duties of general association or duties with reference to the community (&quot;Rechtspflicht&quot;), and duties of vocation (&quot;Berufspflicht&quot;) — both with a universal reference, duties of the conscience (in which the individual is sole judge), and duties of love or of personal association.

It was only the first of the three sections of the science of ethics — the doctrine of moral ends — that Schleiermacher handled with approximate completeness; the other two sections were treated very summarily. In his Christian Ethics he dealt with the subject from the basis of the Christian consciousness instead of from that of reason generally; the ethical phenomena dealt with are the same in both systems, and they throw light on each other, while the Christian system treats more at length and less aphoristically the principal ethical realities — church, state, family, art, science and society. Rothe, amongst other moral philosophers, bases his system substantially, with important departures, on Schleiermacher&#x27;s. In Beneke&#x27;s moral system his fundamental idea was worked out in its psychological relations.

Schleiermacher held that an eternal hell was not compatible with the love of God. Divine punishment was rehabilitative, not penal, and designed to reform the person. He was one of the first major theologians of modern times to teach Christian Universalism.

=== Writings concerning society ===
&quot;On Religion: Speeches to its Cultured Despisers&quot; is a book written by Schleiermacher dealing with the gap he saw as emerging between the cultural elite and general society. Schleiermacher was writing when the Enlightenment was in full swing and when the first major transition into modernity was simultaneously occurring. With the fall of the late Middle Ages and a vigorous discourse taking hold of Western European intellectuals, the fields of art and natural philosophy were flourishing. However, the discourse of theologians, arguably the primary and only discourse of intellectuals for centuries, had taken to its own now minor corner in the universities. &quot;On Religion&quot; is divided into five major sections: the Defense (&quot;Apologie&quot;), the Nature of Religion (&quot;Über das Wesen der Religion&quot;), the Cultivation of Religion (&quot;Über die Bildung zur Religion&quot;), Association in Religion (&quot;Über das Gesellige in der Religion, oder über Kirche und Priesterthum&quot;), and the Religions (&quot;Über die Religionen&quot;). Schleiermacher initiates his speeches on religion in its opening chapter by asserting that the contemporary critique of religion is often over-simplified by the assumption that there are two supposed &quot;hinges&quot; upon which all critiques of religion(s) are based. These two over-simplifications are given by Schleiermacher as first, that their conscience shall be put into judgement, and second, the &quot;general idea turns on the fear of an eternal being, or, broadly, respect for his influence on the occurrences of this life called by you providence, or expectation of a future life after this one, called by you immortality.&quot;

=== Religious thought ===
From Leibniz, Lessing, Fichte, Jacobi and the Romantic school, Schleiermacher had imbibed a profound and mystical view of the inner depths of the human personality. His religious thought found its expression most notably in &quot;The Christian Faith&quot;, one of the most influential works of Christian theology of its time.

Schleiermacher saw the ego, the person, as an individualization of universal reason; and the primary act of self-consciousness as the first conjunction of universal and individual life, the immediate union or marriage of the universe with incarnated reason. Thus every person becomes a specific and original representation of the universe and a compendium of humanity, a microcosmos in which the world is immediately reflected. While therefore we cannot, as we have seen, attain the idea of the supreme unity of thought and being by either cognition or volition, we can find it in our own personality, in immediate self-consciousness or (which is the same in Schleiermacher&#x27;s terminology) feeling. Feeling in this higher sense (as distinguished from &quot;organic&quot; sensibility, &quot;Empfindung&quot;), which is the minimum of distinct antithetic consciousness, the cessation of the antithesis of subject and object, constitutes likewise the unity of our being, in which the opposite functions of cognition and volition have their fundamental and permanent background of personality and their transitional link. Having its seat in this central point of our being, or indeed consisting in the essential fact of self-consciousness, religion lies at the basis of all thought, feeling and action.

At various periods of his life Schleiermacher used different terms to represent the character and relation of religious feeling. In his earlier days he called it a feeling or intuition of the universe, consciousness of the unity of reason and nature, of the infinite and the eternal within the finite and the temporal. In later life he described it as the feeling of absolute dependence, or, as meaning the same thing, the consciousness of being in relation to God. In his &quot;Addresses on Religion&quot; (1799), he wrote:
Schleiermacher&#x27;s concept of church has been contrasted with J.S. Semler&#x27;s.

== Reception ==
The Dutch Reformed theologian Herman Bavinck, deeply concerned with the problem of objectivism and subjectivism in the doctrine of revelation, employs Schleiermacher’s doctrine of revelation in his own way and regards the Bible as the objective standard for his theological work. Bavinck also stresses the importance of the church, which forms the Christian consciousness and experience. In so doing, he attempts to overcome the latent weakness of Schleiermacher’s doctrine of revelation through his emphasis on the ecclesiological doctrine of revelation.

<text>Émile Nelligan (December 24, 1879 – November 18, 1941) was a Canadian Symbolist poet from Montreal who wrote in French. Even though he stopped writing poetry after being institutionalized at the age of 19, Nelligan remains an iconic figure in Quebec culture and was considered by Edmund Wilson to be the greatest Canadian poet in any language.

==Biography==
Nelligan was born in Montreal on December 24, 1879, at 602, rue de La Gauchetière (Annuaire Lovell&#x27;s de 1879). He was the first son of David Nelligan, who arrived in Quebec from Dublin, Ireland at the age of 12. His mother was Émilie Amanda Hudon, from Rimouski, Quebec. He had two sisters, Béatrice and Gertrude.

A follower of Symbolism, he produced poetry profoundly influenced by Octave Crémazie, Louis Fréchette, Charles Baudelaire, Paul Verlaine, Georges Rodenbach, Maurice Rollinat and Edgar Allan Poe. A precocious talent like Arthur Rimbaud, he published his first poems in Montreal at the age of 16.

In 1899, Nelligan began to exhibit odd behavior. He was said to have loudly recited poetry to passing strangers and slept in chapels. He was also experiencing hallucinations and he attempted suicide. He was committed to a mental hospital at the request of his parents. There he was diagnosed with dementia praecox (now more commonly referred to as schizophrenia). He did not write any poetry after being hospitalized.

At the time, rumor and speculation suggested that he went insane because of the vast cultural and language differences between his mother and father. In recent years, however, a number of literary critics have theorized that Nelligan may have been gay. Some of these sources allege that he became mentally ill due to inner conflict between his sexual orientation and his Catholic faith, while others suggest that he was never insane at all, but was dishonestly committed to the asylum by his family to escape the stigma of his alleged sexual orientation. No biographical sources published during Nelligan&#x27;s lifetime contain any confirmed record of Nelligan having had any sexual or romantic relationships with either men or women, although some posthumous biographers have suggested that he may have been the lover of poet Arthur de Bussières. Within the &quot;École littéraire de Montréal&quot; circle with which both Nelligan and Bussières were associated, it was believed that Nelligan was confined to the asylum because his mother discovered him and Bussières in bed together, although this allegation was not widely publicized until the late 20th century and remains unproven. Conversely, the 1991 biographical film &quot;Nelligan&quot; depicts Nelligan as a celibate bisexual, portraying him as sexually ambivalent in the face of romantic attractions to both Bussières and feminist activist Idola Saint-Jean, and implying that his mother attempted to commit incest with him.

In 1903, his collected poems were published to great acclaim in Canada. He may not have been aware that he was counted among French Canada&#x27;s greatest poets.

On his death in 1941, Nelligan was interred in the Cimetière Notre-Dame-des-Neiges in Montreal, Quebec. Following his death, the public became increasingly interested in Nelligan. His incomplete work spawned a kind of romantic legend. He was first translated into English in 1960 by P.F. Widdows. In 1983, Fred Cogswell translated all his poems in &quot;The Complete Poems of Émile Nelligan&quot;. In the fall of 2017, Montreal&#x27;s Vehicle Press will be releasing Marc di Saverio&#x27;s English translations of Nelligan, Ship of Gold: The Essential Poems of Emile Nelligan.

Nelligan is considered one of the greatest poets of French Canada. Several schools and libraries in Quebec are named after him, and Hotel Nelligan is a four-star hotel in Old Montreal at the corner of Rue St. Paul and Rue St. Sulpice.

In her 2013 book &quot;Le Naufragé du Vaisseau d&#x27;or&quot;, Yvette Francoli claimed that Louis Dantin, the publisher of Nelligan&#x27;s poems, was in fact their real author. This claim was also previously advanced by Claude-Henri Grignon in his 1936 essay &quot;Les Pamphlets de Valdombre&quot;, although Dantin himself denied having had anything more than an editing role in the poems&#x27; creation. In 2016, the University of Ottawa&#x27;s literary journal &quot;Analyses&quot; published an article by Annette Hayward and Christian Vandendorpe which rejected the claim, based on textual comparisons of the poetry credited to Nelligan with the writings of Dantin.

==&quot;Le Vaisseau d&#x27;Or &quot;==




English-language translation/adaptation for &quot;Nelligan, the Musical&quot; by Michel Tremblay and Andre Gagnon

A vessel of great might /
Was hewn of solid gold /
Masts billowed in the air /
On seas beyond compare

There Venus came in sight /
Bare-skinned with tousled hair /
Spread upon the prow for sunlight to behold

But then came fateful night /
A great reef sealed her doom /
In the deceiving ocean /
Wherein sirens sing

Her hull was tilted forth /
The wreck slipped tapering /
Down to the chasm&#x27;s depths /
Toward a silent tomb

A vessel hewn of gold /
Diaphanous as air /
Revealed its treasure hold /
To vulgar sailors, there

Disgust and Hate and Fear /
Amongst themselves did rage /

The vessel&#x27;s gone amiss /
In sudden storm it seems /
What&#x27;s happened to my heart, lost on the thankless waves? /

Alas! It sank into the dark abyss... of dreams

==&quot;Christ en Croix&quot;==

Je remarquais toujours ce grand Jésus de plâtre
Dressé comme un pardon au seuil du vieux couvent,
Échafaud solennel à geste noir, devant
Lequel je me courbais, saintement idolâtre.

Or, l&#x27;autre soir, à l&#x27;heure où le cri-cri folâtre,
Par les prés assombris, le regard bleu rêvant,
Récitant Eloa, les cheveux dans le vent,
Comme il sied à l&#x27;Éphèbe esthétique et bellâtre,

J&#x27;aperçus, adjoignant des débris de parois,
Un gigantesque amas de lourde vieille croix
Et de plâtre écroulé parmi les primevères;

Et je restai là, morne, avec les yeux pensifs,
Et j&#x27;entendais en moi des marteaux convulsifs
Renfoncer les clous noirs des intimes Calvaires!

Translation by Konrad Bongard

&quot;The gypsum Jesus always stalled me in my stepsLike a curse at the old convent door;Crouching meekly, I bend to exalt an idolWhose forgiveness I do not implore.&quot;

&quot;Not long ago, at the crickets&#x27; hour, I roamed dimMeadows in a restful reverieReciting &#x27;Eloa&#x27;, with my hair worn by the windAnd no audience save for the trees.&quot;

&quot;But now, as I lie with knees bent beneath Christ&#x27;s scaffold,I see his crumbling mortar crossWith its plaster buried in the roses, and am saddened -&quot;

&quot;For if I listen close enough, I can almost hearThe sound of coal-black nails being wrung inTo his wrists, the savage piercing of Longinus&#x27; spear.&quot;

== Tribute ==

Several schools and libraries of Quebec bear the name of Émile Nelligan. Since 1979 the Prix Émile-Nelligan has rewarded the authors of a French-language poetry book written by a young poet in North America.

On June 7, 2005, the Fondation Émile-Nelligan and the City of Montreal inaugurated a bust to his memory in the Carré Saint-Louis. Another monument to his memory stands in Quebec City.

<doc id="179115" wikidata="Q2871" url="?curid=179115" title="Hagen">
<text>Hagen () is a city in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, on the southeastern edge of the Ruhr area, 15 km south of Dortmund, where the rivers Lenne and Volme meet the Ruhr. In 2023, the population was 197,677.

The city is home to the FernUniversität Hagen (University of Hagen), the only state-funded distance education university in Germany.

== Geography ==
The largest extension of Hagen&#x27;s municipal area is 17.1 km in a north-south direction and 15.5 km in a west-east direction. The city boundary of 89.7 km is made up of 3.3 km to Dortmund, 9 km to the district of Unna, 56.6 km to the Ennepe-Ruhr district and 20.8 km to the Märkisch district. The area of the city (160.36 km²) is roughly the size of the Principality of Liechtenstein.

42 per cent of Hagen&#x27;s municipal area consists of forest. The four rivers in Hagen stretch over a length of 52.2 km: Ruhr 11.5 km, Lenne 13.1 km, Volme 21.3 km and Ennepe 6.3 km. The difference in altitude from the lowest point on the Ruhr near Vorhalle (86 metres above sea level) to the highest point east of Bölling ♁51° 18′ N, 7° 34′ E (438 metres above sea level) is 352 metres.

=== Geology and palaeontology ===
Since the early 19th century, the Hagen area has been regarded as a classic discovery region for palaeontology and archaeology

There are various rocks and deposits from the Devonian to the Carboniferous in the municipal area. Marine and terrestrial deposits from the Cretaceous, Tertiary and Holocene periods have been preserved in karst caves in the mass limestone.

Other fossil sites with animal and plant remains from the Palaeozoic to the Mesozoic have also made important contributions to geoscientific research. In the area around Hagen, for example, the bones of land dinosaurs and early mammals as well as plant remains from the Lower Cretaceous period were found.

The former Hagen-Vorhalle brickworks quarry is considered an important site for the discovery of fossilised insects and other fossils, including early large dragonflies with wingspans of 40 cm, extinct primordial web-footed butterflies and giant centipedes and millipedes from the Upper Carboniferous period. The Hagen-Vorhalle quarry is considered a geotope of global importance for palaeontological research. Finds from the quarry and from the entire region can be seen in the Museum of Prehistory and Early History in Werdringen moated castle.

In a side valley of the Lenne near Holthausen, the remains of Stone Age people were discovered in the ‘Blätterhöhle’ cave. With a C14 age of up to 11,300 years, they date from the beginning of the Mesolithic period. This makes them the oldest evidence to date of anatomically modern humans in the post-glacial period on the European continent.

==History==

=== Medieval times ===

The Hagen region first appears in historical records in the Lorsch Annals (): In 775, Charlemagne&#x27;s troops conquered the Saxon Hohensyburg (then called ) castle located near the city limits of Dortmund above the Ruhr-Lenne estuary.

Hagen itself was first mentioned around the year 1200, and is presumed to have been the name of a farm at the confluence of the Volme and the Ennepe rivers. After the conquest of in 1324, Hagen passed to the County of Mark. 

=== Early modern period ===
After the Treaty of Xanten in 1614, it was granted to the Margraviate of Brandenburg, which became part of the newly founded Kingdom of Prussia in 1701.

A major fire destroyed a significant part of Hagen&#x27;s buildings in 1724. With the help of the Prussian state administration, Hagen was rebuilt within a short time.

Hagen was granted town privileges on 3 September 1746.

=== 19th and early 20th Century ===
After the defeat of Prussia in the Fourth Coalition, Hagen was incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Berg founded by France from 1807 to 1813. It became part of the new Prussian province of Westphalia after the Congress of Vienna in 1815.

From 1817, Hagen was the seat of an office and a district within the administrative district of Arnsberg. In 1837, the revised town regulations and a magistrate were introduced. 

In the course of industrialisation, Hagen was connected to the network of the Bergisch-Märkische Eisenbahngesellschaft in 1848 and developed into an important railway junction.

By 1865, Hagen had overtaken Iserlohn, which had previously been the leading town in South Westphalia in terms of population and economic power.

During the German Empire from 1871 to 1914, Hagen experienced a period of prosperity. Through urbanisation and industrialisation of the 19th century, the city developed into the main centre for the entire region south of the river Ruhr. In 1887, Hagen was administratively separated from the district of Hagen and became an independent city (urban district).

In the years following the turn of the century, the banker and patron Karl Ernst Osthaus brought many later important architects to the city, including Henry van de Velde, Peter Behrens and Walter Gropius. They established Hagen&#x27;s reputation as a link between Art Nouveau and Modernism (). The centrepiece of this initiative was the Folkwang Museum and the (only partially built) garden city of Hohenhagen ().

In reaction to the Kapp Putsch in March 1920, when rightists tried to overthrow the elected government and set up an authoritarian regime, tens of thousands of leftist workers in the Ruhr Valley, Germany&#x27;s most important industrial area, used the opportunity for a revolutionary uprising from the Left. In the Ruhr uprising of 13 March – 2 April 1920, the 50,000-man Ruhr Red Army took control of the industrial district. Government and paramilitary forces were ordered against the workers, suppressing the uprising, and killing an estimated 1,000 workers. A memorial to the uprising was installed in Hagen.

By 1928, Hagen had developed into a city of more than 100,000 inhabitants.

=== During the nazi regime ===
During World War II, Hagen was bombed repeatedly, by both the Royal Air Force and the United States Eighth Air Force. On the night of 1 October 1943, 243 Lancasters and 8 Mosquitoes from the Royal Air Force&#x27;s Bomber Command attacked the city. According to the Bomber Command Campaign Diary, &quot;This raid was a complete success achieved on a completely cloud-covered target of small size, with only a moderate bomber effort and at trifling cost.&quot; Hagen sustained severe damage from that raid, and hundreds of civilians were killed. After the war, the city centre was almost completely destroyed, so that only the surrounding districts still partially reflect the city&#x27;s Wilhelminian architectural character. 

The victims of the Second World War and National Socialism in Hagen: more than 2,200 people died in Allied bombing raids between 1940 and 1945. Over 10,000 Hagen citizens died on the various fronts of the Second World War. Dozens of Hagen citizens were murdered in concentration camps and prisons for racial, religious, ideological and political reasons.

In August 2021, discovery of a cache of Nazi artifacts from a house was announced. A history teacher revealed a painted portrait of Adolf Hitler and medals decorated with eagles and swastikas, a newspaper from 1945, a pistol, gas masks, brass knuckles, and stacks of documents. It is also found out that the house once served as the headquarters of the Nationalsozialistische Volkswohlfahrt.

=== Post-war period ===
In April 1945, the US Army liberated the city, which was later part of the British occupation zone. In August 1948, Hagen was included in the new state of North Rhine-Westphalia and soon became part of the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG, also known as West Germany), founded in 1949.

In the 1950s and 1960s, Hagen experienced another stormy growth and mainly elted into the flatter, northern plain.

=== Late 20th century to the present ===
At the beginning of the 1970s, the decline of heavy industry in Hagen began in the wake of the steel crisis. Hasper Hütte was completely shut down between 1972 and 1982, Gussstahlwerke Wittmann went bankrupt and two of the three plants of Stahlwerke Südwestfalen were closed. Further job losses affected the food industry with the breweries Bettermann and Andreas, the confectionery manufacturers Villosa and Grothe and the production plant of Zwieback Brandt.

The pedestrian zone in the city centre was opened in the 1970s.

In the early 1980s, Hagen made a name for itself as the ‘Liverpool of New German Wave (Neue Deutsche Welle)’. Many well-known musicians and bands of this musical genre (including Nena, Extrabreit and the sisters Annette and Inga Humpe) have their roots in Hagen.

Economically, Hagen came under renewed pressure in the 1990s due to increasing globalisation. A further wave of deindustrialisation began in the steel sector, while Hagen&#x27;s population declined at the same time. Hagen&#x27;s debt level was €1.383 billion on 31 December 2012.

Since the 2000s, major new construction and renovation projects have been realised that have significantly shaped Hagen&#x27;s cityscape today. Examples include the Volme- and Rathaus-Galerie, the redesign of Friedrich-Ebert-Platz and the station forecourt (Berliner Platz) as well as the construction of the new town hall on the riverside.

In mid-July 2021, Hagen was affected by a flood disaster caused by heavy rainfall. In particular, damage was caused in the Volme valley and Hohenlimburg.

==Economy==
Owing to the extensive use of water power along the rivers Ruhr, Lenne, Volme and Ennepe, metal processing played an important role in the region of Hagen in and even before the 15th century.
In the 17th and 18th centuries, textile and steel industries, as well as paper production were developed here.

In the early 21st century, Hagen is the home of the Suedwestfaelische Industrie- und Handelskammer, as well as Sparkasse Hagen, the local public savings bank. The bank&#x27;s former headquarters, the Sparkasse Hagen Tower, was a regional landmark until its demolition in 2004.

The city is heavily indebted and in the process of cutting city services in order to balance its budget.

The city has capitalized on the export of a wide variety of breads, most notably &quot;Hagenschmagenbrot&quot;, a traditional dark bread.

==Education==

One of the five branches of South Westphalia University of Applied Sciences is located in the city (also: Fachhochschule Südwestfalen (FH SWF)), which offers various engineering programmes. This institution was founded in the city in 1824.

==Attractions==
Hagen is home to the &quot;LWL-Freilichtmuseum Hagen&quot;, or Hagen Westphalian Open-Air Museum, a collection of historic industrial facilities. Trades such as printing, brewing, smithing, milling, and many others are represented, not only with static displays, but as living, working operations that visitors may in some cases participate in. It is located near the Hagen community of Eilpe.

The Historisches Centrum Hagen includes the city museum and Werdringen castle. In the Blätterhöhle cave in Hagen, the oldest fossils of modern people in Westphalia and the Ruhr were found. Some date to the early Mesolithic, 10,700 years B.C.E. It seems that the descendants of Mesolithic people in this area maintained a foraging lifestyle for more than 2000 years after the arrival of farming societies.

==Transport==

The Autobahnen A1, A45 and A46 pass by Hagen.

Hagen has been an important rail junction for the southeastern Ruhr valley since the first rail line opened in 1848. The marshalling yard of Hagen-Vorhalle is among Germany&#x27;s largest, and the central station offers connections to the ICE network of Deutsche Bahn as well as to local and S-Bahn services. Since December 2005, Hagen has also been the starting point for a service into Essen, the Ruhr-Lenne-Express, operated by Abellio Deutschland. Since 2022, it has been operated by DB Regio.

Local traffic is handled by Hagener Straßenbahn (Hagen Tramways), which, despite its name, offers only bus services, as the last tramway route in Hagen was abandoned in May 1976. All in all there is a large-scale network of 36 bus lines in Hagen. All local rail and bus services operate under the transport association VRR.

<text>William Roscoe Kintner (21 April 1915 – 1 February 1997) was an American soldier, foreign policy analyst, and diplomat.

Kintner was born in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania to Joseph and Florence Kintner, the eighth of nine children. He was appointed to the United States Military Academy in 1936, and was commissioned a second lieutenant upon graduating in 1940. A career Army officer, he landed at Omaha Beach for Operation Overlord during the invasion of Normandy in 1944. He served during the Korean War as an infantry battalion commander during the Battle of Pork Chop Hill. He retired from the U.S. Army as a colonel in 1961, having earned the Bronze Star Medal and Legion of Merit, both with oak leaf clusters.

While in the service, he earned an M.A. and Ph.D. from Georgetown University in 1948. His doctoral dissertation, a study of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, was published in 1950 as &quot;The Front is Everywhere&quot;. Upon retiring from the Army, he taught political science at the University of Pennsylvania, where he remained as professor until 1985. He was deputy director of the Foreign Policy Research Institute until 1969, when he became director. In 1973, President Gerald Ford appointed him U.S. Ambassador to Thailand, a post in which he served from 1973 to 1975. After his diplomatic stint, he returned to Philadelphia in 1975 to serve as president as FPRI and as editor of its journal, &quot;Orbis&quot;. In that capacity he initiated a joint project with Soviet Institute for the Study of the United States in Canada which permitted the yearly exchange of top non-governmental scholars despite strained Cold War diplomatic relations.

In 1986, President Ronald Reagan appointed him to the board of directors of the United States Institute of Peace.

Kintner was a prolific author, writing on foreign policy, arms control, and strategic planning until his death in 1997 of cancer at the age of 81. He is interred at Bryn Athyn Cemetery in Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania.

==Personal life==
Kintner married Xandree Hyatt in 1940, and the couple had three daughters and a son. Widowed in 1986, he married Faith Child Halterman in 1987.

<text>Jean Moréas (; born Ioannis A. Papadiamantopoulos, Ιωάννης Α. Παπαδιαμαντόπουλος; 15 April 1856 – 31 March 1910) was a Greek poet, essayist, and art critic, who wrote mostly in the French language but also in Greek during his youth.

==Biography==
Moréas was born into a distinguished Athenian family on April 15, 1856. His ancestors included two well-known men of the Greek War of Independence, namely his paternal grandfather and namesake Ioannis Papadiamantopoulos, born in Corinth but of ultimately Epirote ancestry (he was executed after the fall of Missolonghi), and his maternal great uncle Iakovos Tombazis (c. 1782–1829), from Hydra, who became one of the first admirals of the Greek navy. Moreas&#x27;s father was Adamantios Papadiamantopoulos from Patras; a judge, scholar, and poet. 

Moreas received a French education, and went to Paris in 1875 to study law at the University of Paris. While in France, he began associating with literary circles, and became acquainted with Les Hydropathes, a group of French writers that included Alphonse Allais, Charles Cros, Guy de Maupassant, and Léon Bloy. He was also an acquaintance of the Greek artist Demetrios Galanis and the Romanian poet Ion Minulescu.

Moréas died in Paris, France, on March 31, 1910.

==Works==
Moréas published poetry in his publications &quot;Lutèce&quot; and &quot;Le Chat noir&quot;, and collected his poems into two editions, &quot;Les Syrtes&quot; (&quot;The Sandbanks&quot;) and &quot;Cantilènes&quot;, which were strongly influenced by Paul Verlaine.

He was initially a practitioner of the style of Symbolism, and wrote the &quot;Symbolist Manifesto&quot; (1886), which he published in the newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, partly to redeem the reputation of the new generation of young writers from the charge of &quot;decadence&quot; that the press had implied. He was considered one of the most important Symbolist poets until the early 1890s.

In 1891, as Symbolism became more openly associated with anarchism and as the French culture of the Belle Époque became increasingly dominated by revanchism and anti-German sentiment, Moréas published &quot;Le Pèlerin passionné&quot; which rejected Northern European and Germanic influences, such as Romanticism (as well as some aspects of Symbolism), in favor of solely Classical, Ancient Roman and Ancient Greek, influences. This work helped initiate the &quot;École Romane&quot;, the aesthetic of which provided Charles Maurras with the ideology necessary for the far-right philosophy &quot;Action Française&quot;.

Moréas also wrote &quot;Les Demoiselles Goubert&quot;, a novel, in association with Paul Adam. His most important publications were:

*&quot;Les Syrtes&quot; (1884)
*&quot;Les Cantilènes&quot; (1886)
*&quot;Le Pèlerin passionné&quot; (1891)
*&quot;Stances&quot; (1893)
*&quot;Contes de la vielle France&quot; (1904)

<text>Gottfried Christian Friedrich Lücke (24 August 1791 – 4 February 1855) was a German theologian.

Luecke was born at Egeln near Magdeburg, where his father was a merchant. He studied theology at Halle and Göttingen. In 1814 he received the degree of doctor in philosophy from Halle; in 1816 he moved to the Friedrich Wilhelm University, Berlin, where he became licentiate in theology, and qualified as &quot;Privatdozent&quot;.

He soon became friendly with Friedrich Schleiermacher and de Wette, and was associated with them in 1819 in the redaction of the &quot;Theologische Zeitschrift&quot;. Meanwhile, his lectures and publications (among the latter a &quot;Grundriss der Neutestamentlichen Hermeneutik&quot;, 1817) had brought him into considerable repute, and he was appointed professor extraordinarius at the new University of Bonn in the spring of 1818; in the following autumn he became professor ordinarius. From Bonn, where he had JCW Augusti (1772–1841), JKL Gieseler, and Karl Immanuel Nitzsch for colleagues, he was called in 1827 to Göttingen to succeed KF Staudlin (1761-1826). In that year he helped to found the &quot;Theologische Studien und Kritiken&quot;, the chief organ of the &quot;mediation&quot; theology (&quot;Vermittelungstheologie&quot;). At Göttingen he remained, declining all further calls elsewhere, as to Erlangen, Kiel, Halle, Tübingen, Jena and Leipzig, until his death.

Lücke, who was one of the most learned, multilateral and influential of the so-called &quot;mediation&quot; school of evangelical theologians (&quot;Vermittelungstheologie&quot;), is now chiefly known by his &quot;Commentar über die Schriften des Evangelisten Johannes&quot; (4 vols., 1820–1832). He is an intelligent maintainer of the Johannine authorship of the Fourth Gospel; in connection with this thesis he was one of the first to argue for the early date and non-apostolic authorship of the Apocalypse. His &quot;Einleitung in die Offenbarung Johannes&quot; was published in 1832. He also published a &quot;Synopsis evangeliorum Matthaei, Marci et Lucae cum parallelis Joannis pericopis&quot;, jointly with W. M. L. de Wette (1818).

<text>The threshold pledge or fund and release system is a way of making a fundraising pledge as a group of individuals, often involving charitable goals or financing the provision of a public good. An amount of money is set as the goal or &quot;threshold&quot; to reach for the specified purpose and interested individuals will pitch in, but the money at first either remains with the pledgers or is held in escrow.

When the threshold is reached, the pledges are called in (or transferred from the escrow fund) and a contract is formed so that the collective good is supplied; a variant is that the money is collected when the good is actually delivered. If the threshold is not reached by a certain date (or perhaps if no contract is ever signed, etc.), the pledges are either never collected or, if held in escrow, are simply returned to the pledgers. In economics, this type of model is known as an assurance contract.

This system is most often applied to creative works, both for financing new productions and for buying out existing works; in the latter cases, it is sometimes known as ransom publishing model or Street Performer Protocol (SPP).

==History==
The Street Performer Protocol is a natural extension of the much older idea of funding the production of written or creative works through agreements between groups of potential readers or users.

The first illustrated edition of John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; was published under a subscription system; and Mozart and Beethoven, among other composers, used subscriptions to premiere concerts and first print editions of their works. Unlike today&#x27;s meaning of &quot;subscription&quot;, this meant that a fixed number of people had to sign up and pay some amount before the concert could take place or the printing press started.

These three (piano) concertos K413-415 ... formed an important milestone in his career, being the first in the series of great concertos that he wrote for Vienna, and the first to be published in a printed edition. Initially, however, he followed the usual practice of making them available in manuscript copies. Mozart advertised for subscribers in January 1783: &quot;These three concertos, which can be performed with full orchestra including wind instruments, or only a quattro, that is with 2 violins, 1 viola and violoncello, will be available at the beginning of April to those who have subscribed for them (beautifully copied, and supervised by the composer himself).&quot; Six months later, Mozart complained that it was taking a long time to secure enough subscribers. This was despite the fact that he had meanwhile scored a great success on two fronts:...

However, there are a number of differences between this traditional model and the SPP. The most important difference is that traditionally, the subscribers would be among the first to get access and would do so with the understanding that the work would likely always be a &quot;rare&quot; good; thus, there was some status in owning a copy, as well as the prestige of being among the patrons. Additionally, subscriptions were generally sold at a set price, but some wealthy subscribers may have given more in order to be a patron. In the modern Street Performer Protocol, each funder chooses the amount they want to pay, and the work is released to the public and freely reproduced.

In 1970, Stephen Breyer argued for the importance of this model in &quot;The Uneasy Case for Copyright&quot;.

The Street Performer Protocol was successfully used to release the source code and brand name of the Blender 3D animation program. After NaN Technologies BV went bankrupt in 2002, the copyright and trademark rights to Blender went to the newly created NaN Holding BV. The newly created Blender Foundation campaigned for donations to obtain the right to release the software as free and open source under the GNU General Public License. NaN Holding BV set the price tag at 100,000 euros. More than 1,300 users became members and donated more than 50 euros each, in addition to anonymous users, non-membership individual donations and companies. On October 13, 2002, Blender was released on the Internet as free software.

Variations of the SPP include the Rational Street Performer Protocol and the Wall Street Performer Protocol.

==Street Performer Protocol==
Street Performer Protocol is an early description of a type of threshold pledge system. SPP is the threshold pledge system encouraging the creation of creative works in the public domain or copylefted, described by Steven Schear and separately by cryptographers John Kelsey and Bruce Schneier. This assumes that current forms of copyright and business models of the creative industries will become increasingly inefficient or unworkable in the future, because of the ease of copying and distribution of digital information.

Under the Street Performer Protocol, the artist announces that when a certain amount of money is received in escrow, the artist will release a work (book, music, software, etc.) into the public domain or under a free content license. Interested donors make their donations to a publisher, who contracts with the artist for the work&#x27;s creation and keeps the donations in escrow, identified by their donors, until the work is released.

If the artist releases the work on time, the artist receives payment from the escrow fund. If not, the publisher repays the donors, possibly with interest. As detailed above, contributions may also be refunded if the threshold is not reached within a reasonable expiring date. The assessed threshold also includes a fee which compensates the publisher for costs and assumption of risks.

The publisher may act like a traditional publisher, by soliciting sample works and deciding which ones to support, or it may serve only as an escrow agent and not care about the quality of the works (like a vanity press). 

==Ransom model in software==
In software, source code escrow is a publishing model that applies the SPP to source code (often involving existing proprietary software) which is eventually released under an open source or free software license.

In 1939, 1968 and 1975 Hamm incorporated several towns and municipalities: in 1939 the village Mark (which the Counts and the county took the name of) and in 1968 the villages of Berge and Westtünnen. In the reorganisation of 1975, the following towns and municipalities were incorporated into the City of Hamm: 

#The town of Bockum-Hövel, Lüdinghausen district

The number of citizens more than doubles from 83.000 in 1974 to 173.000 in 1975.

===City structure===

Hamm has seven quarters (&quot;&quot;), each divided into residential areas like City, which actually means the center of the city around the Pauluschurch or like Hövel-Radbod near the former entrance to the coalmine Radbod in the quarter Bockum-Hövel. The following table shows the situation in 2006. Every quarter is named with the prefix Hamm, like Hamm-Bockum-Hövel or Hamm-Mitte.
The former town Bockum-Hövel today forms the quarter with the largest number of inhabitants, closely followed by the centre of the city &quot;Hamm-Mitte&quot;. The latter is the smallest quarter by metric size.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Hamm is twinned with:

* Neufchâteau, France (1967)
* Santa Monica, United States (1969)
* Bradford, England, UK (1976)
* Chattanooga, United States (1977)
* Mazatlán, Mexico (1978)
* Toul, France (1987)
* Oranienburg, Germany (1990)
* Kalisz, Poland (1991)
* Afyonkarahisar, Turkey (2006)
==Miscellaneous==
In 2006 Hamm was the first city to accomplish a &quot;Ratsbürgerentscheid&quot; (literally: &quot;council&#x27;s citizens decision&quot;). Subject of the plebiscite was a plan to build a 43 ha city lake (2007–2010) near the city centre. 136,521 citizens were entitled to vote, 57,563 used that possibility and 56.9% refused their approbation for the project. As minimal vote 20% (of the total 136,521 voters) had to decide between one of the possibilities (20% for Yes or 20% for NO). The city council accepted the voting and stopped the plans. 
This procedure is planned for future projects in NRW.
Also in Hamm established was the &quot;Baugerichtstag e. V.&quot; a society organizing a congress about the German building law. The congress is held in a two years term.

==Health==
The largest health facility is the Marien Hospital with its two separate buildings, Marien Hospital I the old building within the centre of the city and Marien Hospital II together 587 beds. Then there is the (EVK Hamm) Evangelisches Krankenhaus Hamm (Protestant Hospital) combined with the children&#x27;s hospital south of the centre together 493 beds, the St. Barbara Klinik (Clinic) in Heessen with 422 beds and the Malteser Krankenhaus (Hospital) St. Josef in Bockum-Hövel with 260 beds. Additional there are the Klinik für manuelle Therapie (Clinic for manual therapy) within the quarter (138 beds), the spa district. The Westfälisches Institut Hamm für Kinder- und Jugendpsychiatrie und psychotherapie (Westphalian Institute Hamm for Children&#x27;s- and Youth psychiatry and psychotherapy) as an Institute of the federal state (158 beds) and the private Klinik (clinic) am Bärenbrunnen. (All Hospitals together have 2058 beds.)
Former Hospitals are: 
* The BWK Bundeswehrkrankenhaus Hamm (Hospital of the Federal Defence Forces) closed in 2007 after a reform of the German forces
* Knappschaftskrankenhaus (Hospital operated by the health fund for miners (Bundesknappschaft) now Marien Hospital II)

* St. Elisabeth Kinderklinik (Children&#x27;s Hospital combined with the Märkische Kinderklinik and now part of the EVK Hamm as &quot;Klinik für Kinder- und Jugendmedizin&quot;)

==Education==
Hamm has six Gymnasien (grammar schools), two comprehensive schools and several Realschulen, Hauptschulen and Grundschulen (elementary schools). The oldest Gymnasium in Hamm is the Gymnasium Hammonense which was established as academic school (small university) with three faculties in 1657. The school declined in its importance and in 1781 merged with the local Latin school and got reformed by Prussia. The new combined school was humanist Gymnasium. In 1867 the &quot;Märkisches Gymnasium&quot; followed as the second Gymnasium of Hamm, in 1902 the &quot;Freiherr vom Stein Gymnasium&quot;, in 1924 the &quot;Beisenkamp Gymnasium&quot; – first as &quot;Oberlyceum&quot; (Gymnasium for girls) – and in 1968 the &quot;Galilei-Gymnasium&quot; was established as an offspring of the Gymnasium Hammonense. Additionally in Schloss Heessen there is a private school including the Gymnasium. Both comprehensive schools in Hamm are younger foundations by the city during school reforms of NRW.
Hamm is also well known for its many vocational schools: 
* &quot;Eduard Spranger Berufskolleg für Technik&quot; a vocational school for mostly industrial jobs
* &quot;Elisabeth Lüders Berufskolleg für Sozialwesen, Gesundheit, Hauswirtschaft und Kinderpflege&quot; a vocational school for social welfare, health, home economics and child care, and several other schools.
* &quot;Friederich List Berufskolleg für Wirtschaft&quot; a trade and economical school
In 2005 a small private university of applied sciences was established, the &quot;SRH Fachhoschule Hamm&quot;.
The private university of applied sciences started with two study programs ending with degrees of Bachelor and Master of Science for logistic engineering.
The &quot;Klinik für Psychatrie und Psychotherapie of the Marienhospital&quot; cooperates with Witten/Herdecke University in education and science.
During the summer 2009 another university of applied sciences was founded by the federal state NRW, named Hochschule Hamm-Lippstadt. The university is divided in two departments, each with its own small Campus area, one in Hamm and another in Lippstadt.

== Industry and economy ==

Major industrial branches are the coal-mining industry, steel industry, chemical industry and the car component supplier industry.
In the last century there were four coal-mines within the urban district. Today the Bergwerk Ost in Herringen is the last operating coal mine with about 3,000 employees.
Mannesmann Hoesch Präzisrohr, Westfälische Draht Industrie (WDI) and Böhler Thyssen Welding are the major representatives of the steel industry, the chemical industry is represented by DuPont in Uentrop and the car supplier industry by Hella KGaA Hueck &amp; Co. factory 4 in Bockum-Hövel with about 1000 employees.
The energy industry is represented by a RWE coal power plant and a further power plant (Trianel) in Uentrop. A new coal power plant is currently under construction. The THTR-300, also in Uentrop-Schmehhausen, was decommissioned in 1989.
Alongside the A2, in the southern part of the urban district, a new business park inhabits the growing logistics business.
Hamm is also known as &quot;City of Law&quot; (Stadt des Rechts) because of the greatest German regional appeal court (Oberlandesgericht), the local court (Amtsgericht), the industrial court (Arbeitgericht) and the industrial appeal court (Landesarbeitsgericht). The Chamber of Notaries and bar association of the regional appeal court Hamm and the courts are of greater influence on the appearance of the city.
Several hospitals in the urban district are also important employers, for example the EVK Hamm has about 1000 employees.

===Media===
The only daily newspaper of Hamm printed there, is the &quot;Westfälischer Anzeiger&quot;. At first, a weekly newspaper in Hamm was the &quot;Kreis Hammsches Wochenblatt&quot; founded by Heinich Jakob Grote in 1822. Its name was changed in 1848 to &quot;Westfälischer Anzeiger&quot;. A second newspaper appeared, founded by the Thiemann family, the &quot;Westfälische Kurier&quot;. Both co-existed until the end of the Second World War. After the War both newspapers were combined and named &quot;Westfälischer Anzeiger und Kurier&quot;. In the 1960s another name-change made the &quot;Westfälischer Anzeiger&quot;. This newspaper is the mantle of several smaller regional newspapers; together, they had a total 153,428 copies in 2004. In the 1970s the &quot;Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; unsuccessfully tried to establish its own daily newspaper.

Two weekly newspapers appear in Hamm: the &quot;Stadtanzeiger&quot; from the &quot;Westfälischer Anzeiger&quot; with a total of 384.000 copies, and the &quot;Sonntags-Rundblick&quot; by a medium-sized local company.

Since 1990 the local radio station &quot;Radio Lippewelle Hamm&quot; is on air and number one radio station of the local radios in NRW. 
On 3 October 1993 the &quot;Offener Kanal Hamm&quot; started broadcasting; it is a small TV project by people for the people, started through the federal state.

==Culture==
The Waldbühne Hamm-Heessen is one of the most active open-air theatres in Germany. The Alfred Fischer Hall is a multi-purpose event location in Heessen in a former machinery hall built by Alfred Fischer in 1912. The Städtische Musikschule Hamm is one of the oldest music schools in Germany. Hamm also has several active choirs and a jazz club and has been the home of many bands.

==Transport==

===Roads===
Hamm is linked to three motorways: the Bundesautobahn 1 (BAB 1 or A1, Puttgarden-Saarbrücken) named Hansaline with two connections (81 and 82), the (BAB 2 or A2, Oberhausen-Berlin) with three connections (17, 18 and 19) and the A445 (Hamm-Arnsberg) which is connected by the B63 until the planned construction between Hamm and Werl is completed. The Kamener Kreuz is situated in the southwest of Hamm. Two federal routes (Bundesstrassen) the B61 and B63 intersect in the city centre. Several state roads (Landesstrassen) connect Hamm with its neighbouring towns and municipalities.

===Railways===

Hamm has three stations, the main railway station Hamm (Westfalen) and two minor stations, one in Bockum-Hövel and the other one in Heessen. The main station is one of the biggest railway hubs in Germany, and connected with one of the largest marshalling yards in Europe, the latter now only partly operating. Notable is the railway station for its Art Deco inspired building styles. Hamm has been connected to the rail since 2 May 1847. Its huge railroad yard—Europe&#x27;s biggest at the time—was bombed repeatedly during World War II, as was the city itself (in December 1944 it was hit by eleven raids on one day).

===Buses===
The city bus network in Hamm is served by the Stadtwerke Hamm, with 65 buses, and the Verkehrsgesellschaft Breitenbach. A regional bus service is served by different companies and both nets serve the central bus station, which is situated in front of the main railway station in the centre of Hamm. Hamm is part of the Verkehrsgemeinschaft Ruhr-Lippe. About 12 million people use the bus network every year, transported on 50 bus lines with 500 bus stops within the city.

===Canal network===

Hamm is the end of the Datteln-Hamm-Kanal; three ports are situated in the urban district:
the city port, the canal end port of Uentrop, and the port of Gersteinwerk. The ports of Hamm are the second biggest canal port by freight transact, 1.4 million tons a year by ships and 0.5 million tons by train. The city port allows for ships up to 110 metres length 11.45 meters width and 2.7 metres draft. It is linked with the railway by a track to the near main railway station and the marshaling yard.

===Airports===
Near the city centre, in the meadows by the River Lippe, the Hamm sport airfield is situated. Its runway is 900 m long and 30 m wide. The airfield is operated by the Luftsportclub Hamm e.V.
Hamm is situated in the middle of a triangle of three smaller international airports, in the north the Münster Osnabrück Airport (FMO), in the south-west Dortmund Airport and in the east Paderborn Lippstadt Airport.
The nearest large international airport is Düsseldorf Airport.

<text>Johann Augustus Eberhard (August 31, 1739January 6, 1809) was a German theologian and &quot;popular philosopher&quot;.

==Life and career==
Eberhard was born at Halberstadt in the Principality of Halberstadt, where his father was a school teacher and the singing master at the church of St. Martin&#x27;s. He studied theology at the University of Halle, and became tutor to the eldest son of Baron von der Horst, to whose family he was attached for several years. In 1763 he was appointed co-rector of the school of St. Martin&#x27;s, and second preacher in the hospital church of the Holy Ghost, but he soon resigned these offices and followed his patron to Berlin. There he met C. F. Nicolai and Moses Mendelssohn, with whom he formed a close friendship, and who were instrumental in his forming his own views. In 1768 he became chaplain to the workhouse at Berlin and the neighbouring fishing village of Stralow. Here he wrote his &quot;Neue Apologie des Socrates&quot; (1772), a work occasioned by an attack on the fifteenth chapter of Jean-François Marmontel&#x27;s &quot;Belisarius&quot; by Peter Hofstede, a Rotterdam clergyman.

In 1774 he was appointed to the living of Charlottenburg. A second volume of his &quot;Apologie&quot; appeared in 1778. In this he tried to meet some objections to the former part, and continued his inquiries into the doctrines of the Christian religion, religious toleration, and the proper rules for interpreting the Scriptures. In 1778 he accepted the professorship of philosophy at Halle, where his students included Friedrich Schleiermacher and the Serbian writer Dositej Obradović. In 1786 he was admitted as a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences; in 1805 the King of Prussia conferred upon him the honorary title of privy-councillor. In 1808 he obtained the degree of Doctor in Divinity, which was awarded for his theological writings. He died in Berlin in 1809.

He was a master of the learned languages, spoke and wrote French fluently, and understood English, Italian and Dutch.

==Theological and philosophical work==

===Theology===
Eberhard argued in books such as &quot;Neue Apologie des Socrates&quot; that salvation did not depend upon revelation, that it was possible for a to go to heaven, and that the notion of eternal punishment contradicted its supposed aim of morally improving the sinner.

===Philosophy===
Eberhard argued in support of John Locke&#x27;s position that all knowledge comes through the senses, but developed this into a full-blooded phenomenalism. In aesthetics he held a position that he called &quot;subjective finalism&quot;, a label later adopted by Immanuel Kant: rather than being an objective property of objects, beauty is the relationship between the object and the representative power of the observer. For him, then, art should aim to awake and stimulate the pleasurable passions. According to Eberhard, aesthetic activity first appears in children&#x27;s play.

In his position as editor of the &quot;Philosophisches Magazin&quot; (1788–1792) and the &quot;Philosophisches Archiv&quot; (1792–1795), Eberhard published many articles (most of which he wrote himself) critical of Kant. He argued that Kant&#x27;s work was wholly derivative, simply adopting the work of Gottfried Leibniz, and a variety of dogmatism. Kant responded to Eberhard&#x27;s criticism in his &quot;Ueber eine Entdeckung, nach der alle neue Kritik der reinen Vernunft durch eine ältere entbehrlich gemacht werden soll&quot; (Königsberg, 1790).

<text>Spacelab was a reusable laboratory developed by European Space Agency (ESA) and used on certain spaceflights flown by the Space Shuttle. The laboratory comprised multiple components, including a pressurized module, an unpressurized carrier, and other related hardware housed in the Shuttle&#x27;s cargo bay. The components were arranged in various configurations to meet the needs of each spaceflight.

Spacelab components flew on a total of about 32 Shuttle missions, depending on how such hardware and missions are tabulated. Spacelab allowed scientists to perform experiments in microgravity in geocentric orbit. There was a variety of Spacelab-associated hardware, so a distinction can be made between the major Spacelab program missions with European scientists running missions in the Spacelab habitable module, missions running other Spacelab hardware experiments, and other Space Transportation System (STS) missions that used some component of Spacelab hardware. There is some variation in counts of Spacelab missions, in part because there were different types of Spacelab missions with a large range in the amount of Spacelab hardware flown and the nature of each mission. There were at least 22 major Spacelab missions between 1983 and 1998, and Spacelab hardware was used on a number of other missions, with some of the Spacelab pallets being flown as late as 2008.

==Background and history==
In August 1973, NASA and European Space Research Organisation (ESRO), now European Space Agency or ESA, signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to build a science laboratory for use on Space Shuttle flights. Construction of Spacelab was started in 1974 by Entwicklungsring Nord (ERNO), a subsidiary of VFW-Fokker GmbH, after merger with Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB) named MBB/ERNO, and merged into EADS SPACE Transportation in 2003. The first lab module, &quot;LM1&quot;, was donated to NASA in exchange for flight opportunities for European astronauts. A second module, &quot;LM2&quot;, was bought by NASA for its own use from ERNO.

Construction on the Spacelab modules began in 1974 by what was then the company ERNO-VFW-Fokker.


In the early 1970s NASA shifted its focus from the Lunar missions to the Space Shuttle, and also space research. The Administrator of NASA at the time moved the focus from a new space station to a space laboratory for the planned Space Shuttle. This would allow technologies for future space stations to be researched and harness the capabilities of the Space Shuttle for research.

Spacelab was produced by European Space Research Organisation (ESRO), a consortium of ten European countries including:
* Austria
* Belgium
* Denmark
* France
* West Germany/Germany
* Italy
* Netherlands
* Spain
* Switzerland
* United Kingdom

==Components==
In addition to the laboratory module, the complete set also included five external pallets for experiments in vacuum built by British Aerospace (BAe) and a pressurized &quot;Igloo&quot; containing the subsystems needed for the pallet-only flight configuration operation. Eight flight configurations were qualified, though more could be assembled if needed.

The system had some unique features including an intended two-week turn-around time (for the original Space Shuttle launch turn-around time) and the roll-on-roll-off for loading in aircraft (Earth-transportation).

Spacelab consisted of a variety of interchangeable components, with the major one being a crewed laboratory that could be flown in the Space Shuttle orbiter&#x27;s bay and returned to Earth. However, the habitable module did not have to be flown to conduct a Spacelab-type mission and there was a variety of pallets and other hardware supporting space research. The habitable module expanded the volume for astronauts to work in a shirt-sleeve environment and had space for equipment racks and related support equipment. When the habitable module was not used, some of the support equipment for the pallets could instead be housed in the smaller Igloo, a pressurized cylinder connected to the Space Shuttle orbiter crew area.

Spacelab missions typically supported multiple experiments, and the Spacelab 1 mission had experiments in the fields of space plasma physics, solar physics, atmospheric physics, astronomy, and Earth observation. The selection of appropriate modules was part of mission planning for Spacelab Shuttle missions, and for example, a mission might need less habitable space and more pallets, or vice versa.

===Habitable module===

The habitable Spacelab laboratory module comprised a cylindrical environment in the rear of the Space Shuttle orbiter payload bay, connected to the orbiter crew compartment by a tunnel. The laboratory had an outer diameter of , and each segment a length of . The laboratory module consisted at minimum of a core segment, which could be used alone in a &quot;short module&quot; configuration. The &quot;long module&quot; configuration included an additional experiment segment. It was also possible to operate Spacelab experiments from the orbiter&#x27;s aft flight deck.

The pressurized tunnel had its connection point at the orbiter&#x27;s mid-deck. There were two different length tunnels depending on the location of the habitable module in the payload bay. When the laboratory module was not used, but additional space was needed for support equipment, another structure called the &quot;Igloo&quot; could be used.

Two laboratory modules were built, identified as LM1 and LM2. LM1 is on display at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum behind the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot;. LM2 was on display in the &quot;Bremenhalle&quot; exhibition in the Bremen Airport of Bremen, Germany from 2000 to 2010. It resides in building 4c at the nearby Airbus Defence and Space plant since 2010 and can only be viewed during guided tours.

===Pallet===
The Spacelab Pallet is a U-shaped platform for mounting instrumentation, large instruments, experiments requiring exposure to space, and instruments requiring a large field of view, such as telescopes. The pallet has several hard points for mounting heavy equipment. The pallet can be used in single configuration or stacked end to end in double or triple configurations. Up to five pallets can be configured in the Space Shuttle cargo bay by using a double pallet plus triple pallet configurations.

The Spacelab Pallet used to transport both Canadarm2 and Dextre to the International Space Station is currently at the Canada Aviation and Space Museum, on loan from NASA through the Canadian Space Agency (CSA).

A Spacelab Pallet was transferred to the Swiss Museum of Transport for permanent display on 5 March 2010. The Pallet, nicknamed &quot;Elvis&quot;, was used during the eight-day STS-46 mission, 31 July – 8 August 1992, when ESA astronaut Claude Nicollier was on board Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; to deploy ESA&#x27;s European Retrievable Carrier (Eureca) scientific mission and the joint NASA/ASI (Italian Space Agency) Tethered Satellite System (TSS-1). The Pallet carried TSS-1 in the Shuttle&#x27;s cargo bay.

Another Spacelab Pallet is on display at the U.S. National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. There was a total of ten space-flown Spacelab pallets.

===Igloo===
On spaceflights where a habitable module was not flown, but pallets were flown, a pressurized cylinder known as the &quot;Igloo&quot; carried the subsystems needed to operate the Spacelab equipment. The Igloo was tall, had a diameter of , and weighed . Two Igloo units were manufactured, both by Belgium company SABCA, and both were used on spaceflights. An Igloo component was flown on Spacelab 2, ASTRO-1, ATLAS-1, ATLAS-2, ATLAS-3, and ASTRO-2.

A Spacelab Igloo is on display at the James S. McDonnell Space Hangar at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in the US.

===Instrument Pointing System===
The IPS was a gimbaled pointing device, capable of aiming telescopes, cameras, or other instruments. IPS was used on three different Space Shuttle missions between 1985 and 1995. IPS was manufactured by Dornier, and two units were made. The IPS was primarily constructed out of aluminum, steel, and multi-layer insulation.

IPS would be mounted inside the payload bay of the Space Shuttle Orbiter, and could provide gimbaled 3-axis pointing. It was designed for a pointing accuracy of less than 1 arcsecond (a unit of degree), and three pointing modes including Earth, Sun, and Stellar focused modes. The IPS was mounted on a pallet exposed to outer space in the payload bay.

IPS missions:
* Spacelab 2, a.k.a. STS-51-F launched 1985
* Astro-1, a.k.a. STS-35 launched in 1990
* Astro-2, a.k.a. STS-67 launched in 1995

The Spacelab 2 mission flew the Infrared Telescope (IRT), which was a aperture helium-cooled infrared telescope, observing light between wavelengths of 1.7 to 118 μm. IRT collected infrared data on 60% of the galactic plane.

The Extended Duration Orbiter (EDO) assembly was not Spacelab hardware, strictly speaking. However, it was used most often on Spacelab flights. Also, NASA later used it with the SpaceHab modules.

==Missions==


Spacelab components flew on 22 Space Shuttle missions from November 1983 to April 1998. The Spacelab components were decommissioned in 1998, except the Pallets. Science work was moved to the International Space Station (ISS) and Spacehab module, a pressurized carrier similar to the Spacelab Module. A Spacelab Pallet was recommissioned in 2000 for flight on STS-99. The &quot;Spacelab Pallet – Deployable 1 (SLP-D1) with Canadian Dextre (Purpose Dexterous Manipulator)&quot; was launched on STS-123. The Spacelab components were used on 41 Shuttle missions in total.

The habitable modules were flown on 16 Space Shuttle missions in the 1980s and 1990s. Spacelab Pallet missions were flown 6 times and Spacelab Pallets were flown on other missions 19 times.

Besides contributing to ESA missions, Germany and Japan each funded their own Space Shuttle and Spacelab missions. Although superficially similar to other flights, they were actually the first and only non-U.S. and non-European human space missions with complete German and Japanese control.

The first West German mission &quot;Deutschland 1&quot; (Spacelab-D1, DLR-1, NASA designation STS-61-A) took place in 1985. A second similar mission, &quot;Deutschland 2&quot; (Spacelab-D2, DLR-2, NASA designation STS-55), was first planned for 1988, but due to the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, was delayed until 1993. It became the first German human space mission after German reunification.

The only Japan mission, Spacelab-J (NASA designation STS-47), took place in 1992.

===Other missions===
* STS-92, October 2000, PMA-3, ()
* STS-108, December 2001, Lightweight Mission Peculiar Support Structure Carrier (LMC) ()
* STS-123, March 2008, Pallet (), Dextre

===Cancelled missions===
Spacelab-4, Spacelab-5, and other planned Spacelab missions were cancelled due to the late development of the Shuttle and the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster.

==Legacy==

The legacy of Spacelab lives on in the form of the MPLMs and the systems derived from it. These systems include the ATV and Cygnus spacecraft used to transfer payloads to the International Space Station, and the Columbus, Harmony and Tranquility modules of the International Space Station.

The Spacelab 2 mission surveyed 60% of the galactic plane in infrared in 1985.

Spacelab was an extremely large program, and this was enhanced by different experiments and multiple payloads and configurations over two decades. For example, in a subset of just one part of the Spacelab 1 (STS-9) mission, no less than eight different imaging systems were flown into space. Including those experiments, there was a total of 73 separate experiments across different disciplines on the Spacelab 1 flight alone. Spacelab missions conducted experiments in materials, life, solar, astrophysics, atmospheric, and Earth science.

<doc id="179138" wikidata="Q380645" url="?curid=179138" title="Conrad Aiken">
<text>Conrad Potter Aiken (August 5, 1889 – August 17, 1973) was an American writer and poet, honored with a Pulitzer Prize and a National Book Award, and was United States Poet Laureate from 1950 to 1952. His published works include poetry, short stories, novels, literary criticism, a play, and an autobiography.

== Biography ==

===Early years===

Aiken was the eldest son of William Ford and Anna (Potter) Aiken. In Savannah, Aiken&#x27;s father became a respected physician and eye surgeon, while his mother was the daughter of a prominent Massachusetts Unitarian minister. For the first eleven years of Aiken&#x27;s life, his family lived at 228 East Oglethorpe Avenue in Savannah.

On February 27, 1901, William Ford Aiken murdered his wife and then committed suicide. According to his 1952 autobiography, &quot;Ushant&quot;, Aiken, then 11 years old, heard the two gunshots and discovered the bodies immediately thereafter. After his parents&#x27; deaths, he was raised by his great-aunt and uncle in Cambridge, Massachusetts, attending Middlesex School, then Harvard University.

At Harvard, Aiken edited the &quot;Advocate&quot; with T. S. Eliot, who became a lifelong friend, colleague, and influence. It was also at Harvard where Aiken studied under another significant influence in his writing, the philosopher George Santayana.

===Adult years===
Aiken was strongly influenced by symbolism, especially in his earlier works. In 1930 he received the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry for his &quot;Selected Poems&quot;. Many of his writings had strong psychological themes. He wrote the widely anthologized short story &quot;Silent Snow, Secret Snow&quot; (1934), partially based on his childhood tragedy.

Other influences were Aiken&#x27;s grandfather, Potter, who had been a church preacher, as well as Whitman&#x27;s freestyle poetry. This helped Aiken shape his poetry more freely while his recognition of a God grounded his more visually rich explorations into the universe. Some of his best-known poetry, such as &quot;Morning Song from Senlin&quot;, uses these influences to great effect.

His collections of verse include &quot;Earth Triumphant&quot; (1914), &quot;The Charnel Rose&quot; (1918) and &quot;And In the Hanging Gardens&quot; (1933). His poem &quot;Music I Heard&quot; has been set to music by a number of composers, including Leonard Bernstein, Henry Cowell, and Helen Searles Westbrook. Aiken wrote or edited more than 51 books, the first of which was published in 1914, two years after his graduation from Harvard. His work includes novels, short stories (&quot;The Collected Short Stories&quot; appeared in 1961), reviews, an autobiography, and poetry. He received numerous awards and honors for his writing, though for most of his lifetime, he received little public attention.

Though Aiken was reluctant to speak of his early trauma and ensuing psychological problems, he acknowledged that his writings were strongly influenced by his studies of Sigmund Freud, Carl G. Jung, Otto Rank, Ferenczi, Adler, and other depth psychologists. It was not until the publication of his autobiography, &quot;Ushant&quot;, that Aiken revealed the emotional challenges that he had battled for much of his adult life. During the 1920s Freud heard of him and offered to psychoanalyze him. While aboard a Europe-bound ship to meet with Freud, Aiken was discouraged by Erich Fromm from accepting the offer. Consequently, despite Freud&#x27;s strong influence on Aiken, Aiken never met the noted psychoanalyst. As he later said, &quot;Freud had read &quot;Great Circle&quot;, and I&#x27;m told kept a copy on his office table. But I didn&#x27;t go, though I started to. Misgivings set in, and so did poverty.&quot;

===Personal life===
Aiken had three younger siblings, Kempton Potter (K. P. A. Taylor), Robert Potter (R. P. A. Taylor), and Elizabeth. After their parents&#x27; deaths, the four children were adopted by Frederick Winslow Taylor and his wife Louise, their great-aunt. His siblings took Taylor&#x27;s last name. Kempton helped establish the Aiken Taylor Award for Modern American Poetry.

He was married three times: firstly to Jessie McDonald (1912–1929); secondly to Clarissa Lorenz (1930–1937) (author of a biography, &quot;Lorelei Two&quot;); and thirdly to the painter Mary Hoover (1937–1973). He fathered three children by his first wife Jessie: John Aiken, Jane Aiken Hodge and Joan Aiken, all of whom became writers.

Aiken married Jessie McDonald in 1912, and the couple moved to England in 1921 with their older two children; John (born 1913) and Jane (born 1917), settling in Rye, East Sussex (where the American novelist Henry James had once lived). The couple&#x27;s youngest daughter, Joan, was born in Rye in 1924. Conrad Aiken returned to Cambridge, Massachusetts, as a tutor at Harvard from 1927 to 1928. For many years, he divided his time between Rye, New York, and Boston. In 1931 he was introduced by the artist Paul Nash to Edward Burra, a painter also living in Rye. That year Burra painted his gouache &quot;John Deth&quot;, inspired by Aiken&#x27;s poem of that name and originally intended to illustrate a projected edition that was never realized. Nevertheless, the two men maintained a lifelong friendship thereafter.

In 1936, Aiken met his third wife, Mary, in Boston. In the following year the couple visited Malcolm Lowry in Cuernavaca, Mexico, where Aiken divorced Clarissa and married Mary. The couple moved to Rye, where they remained until the outbreak of World War II in 1940. The Aikens settled in Brewster, Massachusetts, on Cape Cod, where he and his wife Mary later ran a summer program for writers and painters named after their antique farmhouse, &quot;Forty-One Doors&quot;. Despite living for many years abroad and receiving recognition as a Southern writer, Aiken always considered himself an American, and, in particular, a New Englander.

Over the years, he served &quot;in loco parentis&quot; as well as mentor to the English author Malcolm Lowry. In 1923, he acted as a witness at the marriage of his friend, poet W. H. Davies. From 1950 to 1952, he served as Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress, more commonly known as Poet Laureate of the United States. In 1960, he visited Grasmere in the Lake District, England (once the home of William Wordsworth), with his friend Edward Burra.
The Aikens lived primarily at their farmhouse in West Brewster and wintered in Savannah in a home adjacent to his early childhood house.

Aiken died on 17 August 1973, aged 84, and was buried in Bonaventure Cemetery in Savannah, Georgia, on the banks of the Wilmington River. His widow was buried beside him after her death in 1992. The burial site was featured in &quot;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil&quot; by John Berendt. According to local legend, Aiken wished to have his tombstone fashioned in the shape of a bench as an invitation to visitors to stop and enjoy a martini at his grave. The bench is inscribed with &quot;Give my love to the world&quot; and &quot;Cosmos Mariner—Destination Unknown&quot;.

A primary source for information on Aiken&#x27;s life is his autobiographical novel &quot;Ushant&quot; (1952), one of his major works. In it, he wrote candidly about his various affairs and marriages, his attempted suicide and fear of insanity, and his friendships with T. S. Eliot (who appears in the book as the Tsetse), Ezra Pound (Rabbi Ben Ezra), Malcolm Lowry (Hambo), and others.

==Awards and recognition==
Named Poetry Consultant (now U.S. Poet Laureate) of the Library of Congress from 1950 to 1952, Aiken earned numerous prestigious writing honors, including a Pulitzer Prize in 1930 for &quot;Selected Poems&quot;, the 1954 National Book Award for &quot;Collected Poems&quot;, the Bollingen Prize in Poetry, the National Institute of Arts and Letters Gold Medal in Poetry, and a National Medal for Literature. He was awarded a Guggenheim fellowship in 1934, Academy of American Poets fellowship in 1957, Huntington Hartford Foundation Award in 1960, and Brandeis University Creative Arts Award in 1967. Aiken was the first Georgia-born author to win a Pulitzer Prize, and was named Georgia&#x27;s Poet Laureate in 1973. He was the first winner of the Poetry Society of America&#x27;s Shelley Memorial Award, in 1929. In 1973, he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature but died months earlier before his only chance to be awarded.

In 2009, the Library of America selected Aiken&#x27;s 1931 story &quot;Mr. Arcularis&quot; for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American fantastic tales.

<doc id="179141" wikidata="Q77498" url="?curid=179141" title="Friedrich Eduard Beneke">
<text>Friedrich Eduard Beneke (; 17 February 1798 – c. 1 March 1854) was a German psychologist and post-Kantian philosopher.

== Life ==
Beneke was born in Berlin. He studied at the universities of Halle and Berlin, and served as a volunteer in the War of 1815. After studying theology under Schleiermacher and de Wette, he turned to pure philosophy, studying English writers and the German modifiers of Kantianism, such as Jacobi, Fries and Schopenhauer. In 1820, he published &quot;Erkenntnisslehre&quot;, &quot;Erfahrungsseelenlehre als Grundlage alles Wissens&quot;, and his inaugural dissertation &quot;De Veris Philosophiae Initiis&quot;. His marked opposition to the philosophy of Hegel, then dominant in Berlin, was shown more clearly in the short tract, &quot;Neue Grundlegung zur Metaphysik&quot; (1822), intended to be the programme for his lectures as &quot;Privatdozent&quot;, and in the able treatise, &quot;Grundlegung zur Physik der Sitten&quot; (1822), written, in direct antagonism to Kant&#x27;s &quot;Metaphysics of Morals&quot;, to deduce ethical principles from a basis of empirical feeling. In 1822 his lectures were prohibited in Berlin, because of the influence of Hegel with the Prussian authorities, who also prevented him from obtaining a chair from the Saxon government. He retired to Göttingen, lectured there for several years, and was then allowed to return to Berlin. In 1832 he received an appointment as &quot;professor extraordinarius&quot; at the university, which he continued to hold till his death. On 1 March 1854 he disappeared, and more than two years later his remains were found in the canal near Charlottenburg. There was some suspicion that he had committed suicide in a fit of mental depression.

== Work in psychology ==
The distinctive features of Beneke&#x27;s system are the firmness with which he maintained that in empirical psychology is to be found the basis of all philosophy, and his rigid treatment of mental phenomena by the genetic method. According to Beneke, the perfected mind is a development from simple elements, and the first problem of philosophy is the determination of these elements and of the processes by which the development takes place. In his &quot;Neue Psychologie&quot; (essays iii., viii. and ix.), he defined his position with regard to his predecessors and contemporaries. This and the introduction to his &quot;Lehrbuch&quot; signaled the two great stages in tile progress of psychology the negation of innate ideas by John Locke, and of faculties, in the ordinary acceptation of the term, by Herbart. The next step was his own; he insisted that psychology must be treated as one of the natural sciences. As is the case with them, its content is given by experience alone, and differs from theirs only in being the object of the internal as opposed to the external sense. But by this Beneke in no wise meant a psychology founded on physiology. These two sciences, in his opinion, had quite distinct provinces and gave no mutual assistance. Just as little help is to be expected from the science of the body as from mathematics and metaphysics, both of which had been pressed by Herbart into the service of psychology. The true method of study is that applied with so much success in the physical sciences: critical examination of the given experience, and reference of it to ultimate causes, which may not be perceived, but are nevertheless hypotheses necessary to account for the facts. (See on method, &quot;Neue Psych.&quot;, essay i.)

Starting from the two assumptions that there is nothing, or at least no formed product, innate in the mind, and that definite faculties do not originally exist, and from the fact that our minds nevertheless actually have a definite content and definite modes of action, Beneke proceeds to state somewhat dogmatically his scientifically verifiable hypotheses as to the primitive condition of the soul and the laws according to which it develops. Originally the soul is possessed of or is an immense variety of powers, faculties or forces (conceptions which Beneke, in opposition to Herbart, holds to be metaphysically justifiable), differing from one another only in tenacity, vivacity, receptivity and grouping. These primitive immaterial forces, so closely united as to form but one being (essence), acquire definiteness or form through the action upon them of stimuli or excitants from the outer world. This action of external impressions which are appropriated by the internal powers is the first fundamental process in the genesis of the completed mind. If the union of impression and faculty be sufficiently strong, consciousness (not self-consciousness) arises, and definite sensations and perceptions begin to be formed. These primitive sensations, however, are not to be identified with the special senses, for each of these senses is a system of many powers which have grown into a definite unity, have been educated by experience. From ordinary experience it must be concluded that a second fundamental process is incessantly going on: the formation of new powers, which takes place principally during sleep. The third and most important process results from the fact that the combination between stimulus and power may be weak or strong; if weak, then tile two elements are said to be movable, and they may flow over from one to another of the already formed psychical products. Any formed faculty does not cease to exist on the removal of its stimulus; in virtue of its fundamental property, tenacity, it sinks back as a trace (&quot;Spur&quot;) into unconsciousness, whence it may be recalled by the application to it of another stimulus, or by the attraction towards it of some of the movable elements or newly formed original powers. These traces and the flowing over of the movable elements are the most important conceptions in Beneke&#x27;s psychology. Through them he gives a rationale of reproduction and association, and strives to show that all the formed faculties are simply developments from traces of earlier processes. Lastly, similar forms, according to the degree of their similarity, attract one another or tend to form closer combinations.

All psychical phenomena are explicable by the relation of impression and power, and by the flow of movable elements; the whole process of mental development is nothing but the result of the action and interaction of the above simple laws. In general this growth may be said to take the direction of rendering more and more definite by repetition and attraction of like to like tile originally indefinite activities of the primary faculties. Thus, the sensations of the special senses are gradually formed from the primary sensuous feelings (&quot;sensliche Empfindungen&quot;); concepts are formed from intuitions of individuals by the attraction of the common elements, and the consequent flow towards them of movable forms. Judgment is the springing into consciousness of a concept alongside of an intuition, or of a higher concept alongside of a lower. Reasoning is merely a more complex judgment. Nor are there special faculties of judging or reasoning. The understanding is simply the mass of concepts lying in the background of unconsciousness, ready to be called up and to flow with force towards anything closely connected with them. Even memory is not a special faculty; it is simply the fundamental property of tenacity possessed by the original faculties. The very distinction between the three great classes, knowledge, feeling and will, may be referred to elementary differences in the original relations of faculty and impression.

This is the groundwork of Beneke&#x27;s philosophy. It should be compared with the association psychology of modern British thinkers, most of whose results and processes wiil be found worked into a comprehensive system in Beneke&#x27;s work. In logic, metaphysics and ethics, Beneke&#x27;s speculations are naturally dependent on his psychology.

The special value of Beneke&#x27;s works is found in the many specimens of acute psychological analysis scattered throughout them. As a complete explanation of psychical facts, the theory seems defective. The original hypotheses, peculiar to Beneke, on which the whole depends, are hastily assumed and rest on a clumsy mechanical metaphor. As is the case with all empirical theories of mental development, the higher categories or notions, which are apparently shown to result from the simple elements, are really presupposed at every step. Particularly unsatisfactory is the account of consciousness, which is said to arise from the union of impression and faculty. The necessity of consciousness for any mental action whatsoever is apparently granted, but the conditions involved in it are never discussed or mentioned. The same defect appears in the account of ethical judgment; no amount of empirical fact can ever yield the notion of absolute duty. His results have found acceptance mainly with practical teachers. Undoubtedly his minute analysis of temperament and careful exposition of the means whereby the young, unformed mind may be trained are of infinite value; but the truth of many of his doctrines on these points lends no support to the fundamental hypotheses, from which, indeed, they might be almost entirely severed.

==Influence and school==
German writers who, though not professed followers of Beneke, were influenced by him, include Friedrich Ueberweg and Karl Fortlage. In Britain, the only writer who showed acquaintance with his works is J. D. Morell (&quot;Introduction to Mental Philosophy&quot;).

The most eminent members of the school are (&quot;Beneke oder die Seelenlehre als Naturwissenschaft&quot;), Fried, Friedrich Dittes, and Charles Gottlieb Raue. The compendium by the last-named author passed through four editions in Germany, and has been translated into French, Flemish and English. The English translation, &quot;Elements of Psychology&quot; (1871), gives a lucid and succinct view of the whole system.

== Bibliography ==
Beneke was a prolific writer, and besides the works mentioned above, published large treatises in several departments of philosophy, both pure and as applied to education and ordinary life. A complete list of his writings will be found in the appendix to Dressier&#x27;s edition of the &quot;Lehrbuch der Psychologie als Naturwissenschaft&quot; (1861). The chief ones are:

*&quot;Psychologische Skizzen&quot; (1825, 1827)
*&quot;Lehrbuch der Psychologie&quot; (1832)
*&quot;Metaphysik und Religionsphilosophie&quot; (1840)
*&quot;Die neue Psychologie&quot; (1845)
*&quot;Pragmatische Psychologie oder Seelenlehre in der Anwendung auf das Leben&quot; (1832).

<text>Friedrich Ueberweg (; 22 January 1826 – 9 June 1871), was a German philosopher and historian of philosophy.

==Biography==
Friedrich Ueberweg was born in Leichlingen, Rhineland. His parents were Johann Gottlob Friedrich Ueberweg (19 August 1797 - 9 February 1826), who was pastor of a Lutheran church in Leichlingen, and Helene Boeddinghaus (24 October 1798 - 8 August 1868). Helene was a daughter of Karl Theodor Boeddinghaus (21 February 1765 - 27 December 1842), who was a Lutheran pastor in the neighboring town of Ronsdorf.

Educated at the University of Göttingen and the Humboldt University of Berlin, Friedrich qualified at the University of Bonn as Privatdozent in philosophy (1852). In 1862 he was called to the University of Königsberg as extraordinary professor, and in 1867 he was promoted to the grade of professor ordinarius. He married Anna Henriette Luise Panzenhagen (24 August 1844 - 16 March 1909) on 1 September 1863, in Pillau, Province of Prussia. Ueberweg died in Königsberg in 1871.

==Philosophy==
At first Ueberweg followed the empiricism of Friedrich Eduard Beneke (1798-1854), and strongly opposed the subjectivistic tendency of the Kantian system, maintaining in particular the objectivity of space and time, which involved him in a somewhat violent controversy. His own mode of thought he preferred later to describe as an ideal realism, which refused to reduce reality to thought, but asserted a parallelism between the forms of existence and the forms of knowledge. Beneke and Friedrich Schleiermacher exercised most influence upon the development of his thought.

==Selected works==
*&quot;De elementis animae mundi Platonicae&quot; (&quot;On the elements of the Platonic world of ideas&quot;), Dissertation, 1850
*&quot;Die Entwicklung des Bewußtseins durch den Lehrer und Erzieher&quot; (&quot;The development of consciousness by the teacher and educator&quot;), 1853
*&quot;System der Logik und Geschichte der logischen Lehren&quot; (&quot;System of Logic and History of Logical Doctrines&quot;), 1857
*&quot;Über Idealismus, Realismus und Idealrealismus&quot; (&quot;On idealism, realism and ideal-realism&quot;), 1859
*&quot;Über die Echtheit und Zeitfolge der platonischen Schriften&quot; (&quot;On the authenticity and chronology of the Platonic writings&quot;), 1861
*&quot;&quot;, I–III, 1863–1866
*&quot;Schiller als Historiker und Philosoph&quot; (&quot;Schiller as historian and philosopher&quot;), 1884
*&quot;Die Welt- und Lebensanschauung Friedrich Ueberwegs in seinem gesammelten philosophisch-kritischen Abhandlungen&quot; (&quot;Collected philosophical papers&quot;), Leipzig: Gustav Engel, 1889

Ueberweg&#x27;s compendious &quot;Sketch of the History of Philosophy&quot; (3 vols., 1863–1866) is regarded by many academics and scholars as remarkable for its fullness of information, conciseness, accuracy and impartiality.

<text>Jakob Friedrich Fries (; ; 23 August 1773 – 10 August 1843) was a German post-Kantian philosopher and mathematician.

==Biography==
Fries studied theology at the academy of the Moravian Brethren at Niesky and philosophy at the Universities of Leipzig and Jena. After travelling, in 1806 he became professor of philosophy and elementary mathematics at the University of Heidelberg.

Though the progress of his psychological thought compelled him to abandon the positive theology of the Moravians, he retained an appreciation of its spiritual or symbolic significance. His philosophical position with regard to his contemporaries had already been made clear in his critical work &quot;Reinhold, Fichte und Schelling&quot; (1803), and in the more systematic treatises &quot;System der Philosophie als evidente Wissenschaft&quot; (1804) and &quot;Wissen, Glaube und Ahnung&quot; (1805).

Fries&#x27; most important treatise, the &quot;Neue oder anthropologische Kritik der Vernunft&quot; (2nd ed., 1828–1831), was an attempt to give a new foundation of psychological analysis to the critical philosophy of Immanuel Kant. In 1811 he published his &quot;System der Logik&quot; (ed. 1819 and 1837), and in 1814 &quot;Julius und Evagoras&quot;, a philosophical romance. He was also anti-semitic, writing public polemics against Jews, and in 1816 wrote &quot;Ueber die Gefährdung des Wohlstandes und des Charakters der Deutschen durch die Juden&quot; (&quot;On the Danger Posed by the Jews to German Well-Being and Character&quot;), advocating among other things a distinct sign on the dress of Jews to distinguish them from the general population, and encouraging their emigration from German lands. He blamed the Jews for the ascendant role of money in society and called for Judaism to be &quot;extirpated root and branch&quot; from German society.

In 1816 he was invited to Jena to fill the chair of theoretical philosophy (including mathematics, physics, and philosophy proper), and entered upon a crusade against the prevailing Romanticism. In politics he was a strong Liberal and Unionist, and he did much to inspire the organization of the Burschenschaft. He also published a pamphlet calling for the exclusion of the Jews from public life in Germany. In 1816 he had published his views in a brochure, &quot;Von deutschem Bund und deutscher Staatsverfassung&quot;, dedicated to &quot;the youth of Germany&quot;, and his influence gave a powerful impetus to the agitation which led in 1819 to the issue of the Carlsbad Decrees by the representatives of the German governments.

Karl Sand, the murderer of August von Kotzebue, was one of Fries&#x27;s pupils; and a letter of his, found on another student, warning Sand against participation in secret societies, was twisted by the suspicious authorities into evidence of Fries&#x27; conspiracy. He was condemned by the Mainz Commission; the Grand Duke of Weimar was compelled to deprive him of his professorship; and he was forbidden to lecture on philosophy. The grand duke, however, continued to pay him his stipend, and in 1824 he was recalled to Jena as professor of mathematics and physics, receiving permission also to lecture on philosophy in his own rooms to a select number of students. Finally, in 1838, the unrestricted right of lecturing was restored to him.

Fries was involved in a dispute with the contemporary German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel. In the preface to his &quot;Philosophy of Right&quot;, Hegel criticised Fries&#x27; participation in student events and his role in the &quot;Burschenschaft&quot;. In Hegel&#x27;s view, Fries was dependent upon &quot;immediate perception and contingent imagination&quot;; his views were emotional rather than rational. Hegel argued that Fries&#x27; methodology was not sufficiently scientific and that, therefore, his conclusions were illogical. Fries responded by accusing Hegel of defending the existing order and his own privileged position within it. He argued that &quot;Hegel&#x27;s metaphysical mushroom has grown not in the gardens of science but on the dunghill of servility.&quot; For Fries, Hegel&#x27;s theories merely added up to a defence of the establishment and, specifically, the Prussian authorities.

<text>Andrew Stephen Grove (born Gróf András István; 2 September 1936 – 21 March 2016) was a Hungarian-American businessman and engineer who served as the third CEO of Intel Corporation. He escaped from the Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic during the 1956 revolution at the age of 20 and moved to the United States, where he finished his education. He was the third employee and eventual third CEO of Intel, transforming the company into the world&#x27;s largest semiconductor company.

As a result of his work at Intel, along with his books and professional articles, Grove had a considerable influence on electronics manufacturing industries worldwide. He has been called the &quot;guy who drove the growth phase&quot; of Silicon Valley. In 1997, &quot;Time&quot; magazine chose him as &quot;Man of the Year&quot;, for being &quot;the person most responsible for the amazing growth in the power and the innovative potential of microchips.&quot; One source notes that by his accomplishments at Intel alone, he &quot;merits a place alongside the great business leaders of the 20th century.&quot;

==Personal life and education==
Grove was born as &quot;Gróf András István&quot; to a middle-class Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary, the son of Mária and György Gróf. At the age of four he contracted scarlet fever, which was nearly fatal and caused partial hearing loss.

When he was eight, the Nazis occupied Hungary and deported nearly 500,000 Jews to concentration camps, including Auschwitz. To avoid being arrested, Grove and his mother took on false identities and were sheltered by friends. His father, however, was arrested and taken to an Eastern Labor Camp where he was severely tortured and forced to do slave labor. The father was reunited with his family only after the war.

During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, when he was 20, he left his home and family and escaped across the border into Austria. Penniless and barely able to speak English, in 1957 he eventually made his way to the United States. He later changed his name to the anglicized Andrew S. Grove. Grove summarized his first twenty years of life in Hungary in his memoirs:
Soon after arriving in the United States, in New York&#x27;s Catskill Resort, in 1957, he met his future wife, Eva Kastan, who was an Austrian refugee. They met while he held a job as a busboy and she was a waitress while studying at Hunter College. One year after they met, in June 1958 they married in New York, Queens, in a Roman Catholic ceremony. They remained married until Grove died. They had two daughters, Karen Grove and Robie Livingstone, and eight grandchildren.

Even though he arrived in the United States with little money, Grove retained a &quot;passion for learning.&quot;

He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in chemical engineering from the City College of New York in 1960. &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that &quot;a refugee became a senior in engineering.&quot;

Grove attended and graduated with his Ph.D. in chemical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley in 1963.

In 2000, he was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease; he became a contributor to several foundations that sponsor research towards a cure. He died at his home on March 21, 2016, at the age of 79; the cause of death was not publicly disclosed.

==Career==

===Starting Intel===
After completing his Ph.D. in 1963, Grove worked at Fairchild Semiconductor as a researcher, and by 1967 had become its assistant director of development. His work there made him familiar with the early development of integrated circuits, which would lead to the &quot;microcomputer revolution&quot; in the 1970s. In 1967, he wrote a college textbook on the subject, &quot;Physics and Technology of Semiconductor Devices.&quot;
In 1968, Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore co-founded Intel, after they and Grove left Fairchild Semiconductor. Grove joined on the day of its incorporation, although he was not a founder. Fellow Hungarian émigré Leslie L. Vadász was Intel&#x27;s fourth employee. Grove worked initially as the company&#x27;s director of engineering, and helped get its early manufacturing operations started. In 1983, he wrote a book, &quot;High Output Management&quot;, in which he described many of his methods and manufacturing concepts.

Initially, Intel primarily manufactured static memory chips for mainframe computers, but in the early/mid-1970s Intel introduced one of the earliest digital watches, an electronic calculator, and also the world&#x27;s first general-purpose microprocessor, the 4-bit 4004. By 1974 Intel had developed the 8-bit 8008 and quickly thereafter, in 1975, the 8080 processor, which would become the core of the Altair, the world&#x27;s first so-called PC (personal computer) which foreshadowed the PC revolution. Soon came the 8086 16-bit microprocessor and a cost-reduced version, the 8088, which IBM chose for its IBM PC which brought personal computers to the masses. In 1985, Intel produced the 32-bit 80386 microprocessor which began a long line of increasingly powerful microprocessors including the 80486, the Pentium, and a plethora of supporting integrated circuits and computers built with them.

Even though Intel had invented most of the types of memory in use at the time including EPROM (Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory), by 1985, with less demand for their memory chips due to the challenges created by Japanese &quot;dumping&quot; of memory chips at below-cost prices, Grove was forced to make radical changes. As a result, he chose to discontinue producing DRAMs and focus instead on manufacturing microprocessors. Grove, along with Intel&#x27;s sales manager to IBM, Earl Whetstone, played a key role in negotiating with IBM to use only Intel microprocessors in all of their new personal computers.

The company&#x27;s revenue increased from $2,672 in its first year (1968) to $20.8 billion in 1997. Grove was appointed Intel&#x27;s president in 1979, CEO in 1987, and then chairman of the board in 1997. In May 1998 Grove relinquished the post of CEO to Craig Barrett, as Grove had been diagnosed with prostate cancer a few years earlier, though he remained chairman until November 2004. Since then Grove remained at Intel as a senior advisor, and has also been a lecturer at Stanford University. He reflected back upon Intel&#x27;s growth through the years:
Grove is credited with having transformed Intel from a manufacturer of memory chips into the world&#x27;s dominant producer of microprocessors for PC, servers, and general-purpose computing. During his tenure as CEO, Grove oversaw a 4,500% increase in Intel&#x27;s market capitalization from $4 billion to $197 billion, making it the world&#x27;s 7th largest company, with 64,000 employees. Most of the company&#x27;s profits were reinvested in research and development, along with building new facilities, in order to produce improved and faster microprocessors.

===Management methods and style===
As director of operations, manufacturing became Grove&#x27;s primary focus and his management style relied heavily on his management concepts. As the company expanded and he was appointed chairman, Grove became more involved in strategic decision-making, including establishing markets for new products, coordinating manufacturing processes and developing new partnerships with smaller companies.

Grove helped create the Intel Architecture Laboratory (IAL) in Oregon to ensure that software was developed in time to take advantage of their new microprocessors. Grove stated that &quot;you are making decisions about what the information technology world will want five years into the future.&quot;

==== Only the Paranoid Survive ====
As CEO, he wanted his managers to always encourage experimentation and prepare for changes, making a case for the value of paranoia in business. He became known for his guiding motto: &quot;Only the paranoid survive,&quot; and wrote a management book with the same title, published in 1996. As a result, he urged senior executives to allow people to test new techniques, new products, new sales channels, and new customers, to be ready for unexpected shifts in business or technology. Biographer Jeremy Byman observed that Grove &quot;was the one person at Intel who refused to let the company rest on its laurels.&quot; Grove explains his reasoning:

A corporation is a living organism; it has to continue to shed its skin. Methods have to change. Focus has to change. Values have to change. The sum total of those changes is transformation.

==== Strategic inflection points ====
Grove popularized the concept of the &quot;strategic inflection point,&quot; a crucial time that demands a major change in strategy due to shifts in the business environment. A company&#x27;s growth depends on recognizing and effectively navigating these points.

Strategic inflection points cause a mismatch between a company&#x27;s current strategies and changes in the industry, something Grove called strategic dissonance. &quot;To overcome this, the dissonance must be resolved by aligning the company&#x27;s strategies with the new reality, requiring proactive and adaptive leadership that continually assesses and adjusts the company&#x27;s strategies to keep pace with shifts in the business environment,&quot; taught Grove.

Grove believed that the role of Helpful Cassandras, individuals who raise red flags about potential problems and challenge the dominant view, are crucial in identifying and mitigating risks before they become bigger issues. He emphasized the importance of organizations listening to the warnings of Cassandras and taking action, instead of ignoring or suppressing them, in order to identify and successfully address strategic inflection points.

==== Competitive mindset ====
Grove had a strong competitive mindset, viewing competition as the key driver of innovation and progress. He encouraged companies to aim for industry leadership and constantly seek ways to improve their offerings, processes and operations. He likened himself to a coach and viewed the manager&#x27;s role as one of fueling employee motivation to excel. He believed &quot;good fear&quot; could play a productive role.

&quot;The quality guru W. Edwards Deming advocated stamping out fear in corporations. I have trouble with the simplemindedness of this dictum. The most important role of managers is to create an environment where people are passionately dedicated to winning in the marketplace. Fear plays a major role in creating and maintaining such passion. Fear of competition, fear of bankruptcy, fear of being wrong and fear of losing can all be powerful motivators.&quot;

==== Constructive confrontation ====
Grove fostered a culture of open communication where employees were encouraged to speak their minds in a &quot;constructive confrontation&quot; approach. &quot;People here aren&#x27;t afraid to speak up and debate with Andy,&quot; said Intel Senior VP Ron Whittier. According to Grove&#x27;s successor at Intel, Craig Barrett, &quot;It&#x27;s give and take, and anyone in the company can yell at him. He&#x27;s not above it.&quot; Grove insisted that people be demanding on one another, which fostered an atmosphere of &quot;ruthless intelligence.&quot; About that philosophy, writes business author Ken Goldstein, &quot;you bought into it or got your walking papers.&quot;

==== Egalitarian ethos ====
Grove asserted that knowledge power surpasses positional power. He ingrained that philosophy in the workplace culture at Intel. &quot;We argue about issues, not the people who advocate them.&quot; As a testament to this ethos, there were no executive perks at Intel, including special dining rooms, washrooms, or parking spots. Grove&#x27;s office was a standard cubicle, reflecting his personal preference for an egalitarian atmosphere. Grove disliked &quot;mahogany-paneled corner offices.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ve been living in cubicles since 1978—and it hasn&#x27;t hurt a whole lot.&quot; This accessibility made his workspace open to anyone who walked by.

This workplace culture is a reflection of Grove&#x27;s personal life, where he was known for his modesty and lack of pretense. He lived simply, without luxury cars or private planes, and was described by venture capitalist Arthur Rock as having &quot;no airs.&quot;

==== Attention to detail ====
Grove was noted for making sure that important details were never missed, with one of his favorite sayings being, &quot;the devil is in the details.&quot; Intel Vice President Dennis Carter states that &quot;Andy is very disciplined, precise, and detail oriented. According to &quot;Industry Week&quot; magazine, Grove feared that the &quot;brilliance that sparked the creation of Intel&quot; during its early years &quot;might come to nothing if somebody didn&#x27;t pay attention to details.&quot; Carter recalls that Grove would even correct his spelling errors despite English being his second language.

=== The Father of the objectives and key results (OKR) approach to management ===
One of the earliest investors in Google, John Doerr, called Grove the &quot;Father of OKRs&quot; in Doerr&#x27;s 2018 book, &quot;Measure What Matters: How Google, Bono, and the Gates Foundation Rock the World with OKRs.&quot; An acronym for objectives and key results, it became central to Google&#x27;s culture as a &quot;management methodology that helps to ensure that the company focuses efforts on the same important issues throughout the organization.&quot; The objective is the clearly defined goal, while the key results were the specific benchmarks to ensure achievement of that goal were &quot;measurable and verifiable.&quot;

In 1975, Doerr wrote of attending a course within Intel taught by Grove, where he was introduced to the theory of OKRs. Grove explained his perspective on management: &quot;The key result has to be measurable. But at the end you can look, and without any arguments: Did I do that or did I not do it? Yes? No? Simple. No judgments in it.&quot;

Larry Page, co-founder of Google, credited OKRs in the foreword to Doerr&#x27;s book: &quot;OKRs have helped lead us to 10x growth, many times over. They&#x27;ve helped make our crazily bold mission of &#x27;organizing the world&#x27;s information&#x27; perhaps even achievable. They&#x27;ve kept me and the rest of the company on time and on track when it mattered the most.&quot;

===Preference for a &quot;job-centric&quot; American economy===
While Grove supported helping technology startups, he also felt that America was wrong in thinking that those new companies would increase employment. &quot;Startups are a wonderful thing,&quot; he wrote in a 2010 article for &quot;Bloomberg&quot;, &quot;but they cannot by themselves increase tech employment.&quot; Although many of those startups and entrepreneurs would achieve tremendous success and wealth, said Grove, he was more concerned with the overall negative effect on America: &quot;What kind of a society are we going to have if it consists of highly paid people doing high-value-added work and masses of unemployed?&quot;

Grove felt that employment growth depended on those companies&#x27; ability or willingness to scale up within the US. According to Grove, Silicon Valley&#x27;s &quot;innovation machine&quot; over the last few decades has not been adding many jobs, although American tech companies have instead been adding jobs in Asia &quot;like mad.&quot; He noted that while American investments in startups have increased dramatically, those investments have in fact resulted in fewer jobs: &quot;Simply put,&quot; he wrote, &quot;the U.S. has become wildly inefficient at creating American tech jobs.&quot; He therefore worked to keep Intel&#x27;s manufacturing in the US, with the company having 90,000 employees in 2010. He explained the causes and effects of many business&#x27;s growth plans:

To remedy the problem, he strongly believed that &quot;job creation&quot; should become America&#x27;s primary objective, much as it is in Asian nations. Among the methods he felt were worth considering was the imposition of a tax on imported products, with the funds received then made available to help American companies scale their operations in the US. However, he also accepted the fact that his ideas would be controversial: &quot;If what I&#x27;m suggesting sounds protectionist, so be it.&quot; Or that those protectionist steps could lead to conflicts with trade partners: &quot;If the result is a trade war, treat it like other wars—fight to win.&quot; He added:

Grove was also in the minority of high-tech leaders when he advocated taxing internet sales made to other states: &quot;I don&#x27;t think electronic commerce needs federal or state subsidies in terms of tax advantages,&quot; he told a Congressional committee in 2000. At the same hearing, he also expressed his opinion about internet privacy, stating that &quot;personal data is a form of property and it&#x27;s inevitable that governments will regulate property rights.&quot; He said that it would be better if the federal government established its own uniform privacy standards rather than have states create a patchwork of different laws.

===Writing and teaching===
Grove was also a noted author and scientist. His first book on semiconductors, &quot;Physics and Technology of Semiconductor Devices&quot; (1967), has been used by leading universities. Another book he wrote on business operation methods, &quot;High Output Management&quot; (1983). He also wrote over 40 technical papers and held several patents on semiconductor devices.

Grove wrote &quot;Only the Paranoid Survive&quot; (1996), a business book, whose core message is that a company in pursuit of a stronger competitive advantage never rests.

He also taught graduate computer physics courses at the University of California, Berkeley and the Stanford Graduate School of Business.

===Philanthropy===
In 2005, Grove made the largest donation that the City College of New York (CUNY) has ever received. His grant of $26 million transformed the CCNY School of Engineering into the Grove School of Engineering.

Grove was also instrumental, as a key fundraiser, in establishing the University of California, San Francisco&#x27;s Mission Bay Campus, the largest ongoing biomedical construction project in the world. Chancellor Sam Hawgood said that Grove&#x27;s &quot;generous and tireless support of UCSF has transformed our university and helped accelerate our research into breakthrough treatments and better patient care.&quot;

Among the research facilities which he helped fund were the UCSF Prostate Cancer Center, the Helen Diller Family Cancer Research Building, and the Clinical and Translational Science Institute. He also promoted general surgery initiatives and supported various obstetrics and gynecology research programs.

Grove was a longtime member of the International Rescue Committee (IRC), along with being one of its overseers and a member of its board of directors. He was also the founding supporter of the IRC&#x27;s Pathways to Citizenship program. In 2010, the IRC honored him as one of ten distinguished refugees. In an interview in &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine in 2000, Grove encouraged the United States to be &quot;vigilant as a nation to have tolerance for difference, a tolerance for new people.&quot; He pointed out that immigration and immigrants are what made America what it is.

<text>Cinemax is an American pay television network owned by Home Box Office, Inc., a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery. Launched on August 1, 1980, as a &quot;maxi-pay&quot; service to complement the offerings of its sister premium network, HBO (Home Box Office), Cinemax initially focused on recent and classic films. Today, its programming primarily includes recent and classic theatrically released films, original action series, documentaries, and special behind-the-scenes features.

It operates eight 24-hour linear channels and offers a traditional subscription video-on-demand service called Cinemax On Demand. Cinemax previously provided a TV Everywhere streaming platform, Cinemax Go, which is no longer available. However, its linear channels are accessible through multichannel video programming distributors such as Apple TV, Amazon Video, and Roku.

==History==
Home Box Office, Inc., owned by Time Inc.&#x27;s Time-Life Broadcasting unit, launched a movie-centered pay service called Take 2 on April 1, 1979, as a companion to HBO. However, Take 2 struggled with subscriber growth and was discontinued in February 1981. HBO then announced the launch of Cinemax, a &quot;maxi-pay&quot; channel designed to complement HBO and compete with other movie channels. Cinemax debuted on August 1, 1980, focusing on theatrical films with no commercials or edits for content.

Cinemax initially aired on 56 cable systems in the Eastern and Central time zones, with a West Coast feed launching on September 1, 1980. The channel transitioned to a 24-hour schedule on January 1, 1981. Cinemax offered uncut films and was marketed as a premium addition to HBO, often bundled with HBO for a discount.

In October 1983, Cinemax faced a trademark infringement lawsuit from Tulsa 23 Limited Partnership over its promotional slogan, &quot;We Are Your Movie Star.&quot; The court ruled in favor of Tulsa 23, and Cinemax was ordered to discontinue the slogan.

As competition increased, Cinemax adjusted its programming strategy by including more adult-oriented films and launching the &quot;Friday After Dark&quot; late-night block in 1984. The channel also introduced original music programming and series, including &quot;Second City Television&quot; and &quot;The Max Headroom Show&quot;. In February 1988, the network premiere of &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; became one of Cinemax&#x27;s highest-rated broadcasts.

On March 4, 1989, Warner Communications announced its intent to merge with HBO&#x27;s parent company, Time Inc., for $14.9 billion. Despite legal challenges from Paramount Communications, the merger was completed on January 10, 1990, creating Time Warner (later WarnerMedia, now Warner Bros. Discovery), which remains the parent company of Cinemax and HBO. This was significant because it gave both networks, but especially Cinemax, access to Warner Bros.&#x27; major library, and gave them unlimited resources with the studio as well as with Time Warner. And WB would become a majority studio in the network&#x27;s film catalog, with Cinemax, for instance, airing &quot;GoodFellas&quot; in its exclusive premiere in 1991.

In August 1991, Cinemax, along with HBO, was among the first American pay TV services to introduce multiplexed channels. Starting in 1992, Cinemax reintroduced television series development with adult-oriented scripted series, such as &quot;Erotic Confessions&quot;, &quot;Hot Line&quot;, &quot;Passion Cove&quot;, &quot;Lingerie&quot;, and &quot;Co-Ed Confidential&quot;.

Cinemax was the exclusive premiere network of several blockbuster movies, such as &quot;GoodFellas&quot; in 1991, &quot;Juice&quot; in 1993, &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot;, &quot;The Matrix&quot; in 2000, and &quot;X-Men&quot; in 2002. From 1992 to 1997, Cinemax featured daily movie showcases centered on specific genres, identified by pictograms. This practice ended in September 1997, with Cinemax adopting a simplified branding strategy that included &quot;Max Hits at 8&quot; and &quot;Max Prime at 10.&quot;

On March 1, 1994, Cinemax, HBO, Showtime, and The Movie Channel introduced a content advisory system to inform viewers about program content. A revised system with content codes was implemented on June 10, 1994.

In 1998, Cinemax began offering &quot;sneak preview&quot; blocks for its multiplex channels, ActionMax and ThrillerMax. Classic films, once a staple of the Cinemax schedule, were increasingly featured on multiplex channels like 5StarMax. By the mid-2000s, the main channel&#x27;s programming focused on films from the 1990s to the present.

In 2001, Cinemax began premiering select blockbuster and lesser-known films before their HBO airings. In February 2011, Cinemax shifted its focus to original programming, launching action-themed series to compete with other premium and streaming services, and to rebrand its image from being primarily known for softcore pornographic content. Cinemax shortened its name to just Max in 2008, but it was reverted 3 years later.

Following AT&amp;T&#x27;s acquisition of Time Warner in 2018, Cinemax&#x27;s focus shifted significantly. Adult programming on Cinemax and HBO&#x27;s multiplexes, as well as on-demand services, nearly disappeared due to increased availability of such content online and competition from other providers.

In January 2020, WarnerMedia announced that with the upcoming launch of HBO Max, Cinemax would cease commissioning original programming but would continue as a movie-focused service through existing distributors. Cinemax&#x27;s original programming, although available internationally, was not included in HBO Max. Len Amato, the executive overseeing Cinemax and HBO&#x27;s film and miniseries division, left WarnerMedia on August 14, 2020, marking the end of Cinemax&#x27;s original programming efforts.

On May 17, 2021, AT&amp;T and Discovery, Inc. announced a Reverse Morris Trust agreement, wherein WarnerMedia would spin-off from AT&amp;T and merge with Discovery for $43 billion. This merger, completed in spring 2022, resulted in the formation of Warner Bros. Discovery, led by David Zaslav. On May 23, 2023, the merged company&#x27;s streaming service was rebranded as Max.

==Channels==
On May 8, 1991, Home Box Office Inc. announced plans to launch multiplexed companion channels for HBO and Cinemax, offering additional programming options at no extra charge. The test launch on August 1, 1991, introduced Cinemax 2, HBO2, and HBO3 (now HBO Signature) to select TeleCable customers, providing distinct programming from their parent channels. John K. Billock, HBO&#x27;s EVP of marketing, cited subscriber dissatisfaction with program scheduling as a reason for the multiplex expansion. A November 1991 ACNielsen survey showed positive impacts from the multiplex channels, including reduced negative opinions on pricing and improved overall usage.

In February 1996, Home Box Office announced plans to expand to twelve channels, including two additional Cinemax channels and a fourth HBO channel, projected for a Spring 1997 launch. The Cinemax multiplex expanded on December 1, 1996, with the launch of Cinemax 3, and the introduction of Mountain Time Zone feeds.

The Cinemax multiplex was marketed as &quot;MultiChannel Cinemax&quot; in September 1994, rebranded to &quot;MultiMax&quot; in April 1998, and later applied to the expanded four-channel package. This included MoreMax (formerly Cinemax 2), ActionMax (formerly Cinemax 3), and the new ThrillerMax channel.

On May 17, 2001, four additional themed channels were launched: OuterMax, WMax (later MovieMax), @Max (later Max Latino), and 5StarMax. Max Latino was rebranded as Cinemáx on April 1, 2015, mirroring the flagship Cinemax schedule with Spanish-language dubs. MovieMax started as a family-oriented channel and now focuses on recent and classic movies.

===List of channels===


Cinemax offers up to eight 24-hour multiplex channels, available in both standard and high definition, with regional feeds based on time zones. These channels include a subscription video-on-demand service, Cinemax on Demand. Maintenance periods, ranging from 30 minutes to two hours, occur monthly during early morning hours before the 6:00 a.m. ET/PT start of the broadcast day.

Cinemax transmits its channels on both Eastern and Pacific Time Zone schedules. The time zone-based feeds are usually packaged together, resulting in a maximum three-hour difference in local airtimes between geographic locations. The opposite-region feed serves as a timeshift channel, allowing viewers to watch programs up to three hours later or four hours earlier than their local airtime. While most providers offer only the East and West Coast feeds of the main Cinemax channel, timeshifted feeds for other multiplex channels are available on platforms like DirecTV, YouTube TV, and Hulu live TV.
===Other services===
====Cinemax HD====
Cinemax HD broadcasts in 1080i resolution with Dolby Digital 5.1 sound. Cinemax provides high definition simulcast feeds for its main channel and all seven multiplex channels. Initially, from the 2008 rollout of HD simulcasts for the multiplex feeds, most pay television providers only offered the main Cinemax channel in HD, with HD availability for multiplex channels varying by market. As of 2020, most providers offer all eight Cinemax multiplex channels in HD, either on a dedicated HD channel tier or as hybrid SD/HD feeds. The flagship network switched to exclusive high definition programming on September 1, 2008.

==== Cinemax On Demand ====
Cinemax On Demand is the network&#x27;s companion subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) service, available at no extra charge to subscribers of the linear television service. Launched in 2002, it offers VOD content through select virtual MVPD services such as DirecTV Stream and Hulu, as well as on Cinemax&#x27;s dedicated OTT video channels via Apple TV Channels, Amazon Video Channels, and The Roku Channel.

====Cinemax Go====

Cinemax Go (formerly MAX Go) was a TV Everywhere streaming service for Cinemax subscribers, available as a desktop website and through apps for Apple and Google Play devices, as well as most digital media players and game consoles. Launched on September 13, 2010, it mirrored the content of Cinemax On Demand, excluding live simulcasts of the linear channels. New episodes of the network&#x27;s original programming were available at the same time as their wireline release.

The service was available to subscribers of AT&amp;T U-verse, Cox Communications, DirecTV, Dish Network, Suddenlink Communications, and Charter Communications. The MAX Go app was discontinued on April 30, 2020, and the desktop website, renamed Cinemax Go, continued until July 31, 2022. The service was phased out as Warner Bros. Discovery consolidated its streaming efforts under HBO Max, rebranded as Max on May 23, 2023.

==Programming==

Cinemax schedules movies for 20–24 hours daily on its main channel and 24 hours on its multiplex channels. Since June 2000, new theatrical and original movies have premiered every Sunday at 8:00 p.m. ET/PT. First-run films typically debut 10 months to a year after their theatrical release and within six months of DVD or VOD release.

===Original programming===
On August 12, 2011, Cinemax expanded into original programming with the U.S. premiere of the British action series &quot;Strike Back&quot;. The series, which had originally aired in the UK, was produced in partnership with HBO . Cinemax&#x27;s second original series, &quot;Hunted&quot;, premiered on October 19, 2012, in collaboration with BBC One. This was followed by &quot;Banshee&quot; in 2013, and in 2014, &quot;Sandbox&quot; and &quot;The Knick&quot;.

In 2020, Cinemax announced it would stop commissioning original programming to focus on HBO Max. The martial arts drama &quot;Warrior&quot; was the last original series on Cinemax, with its third season moving to HBO Max in April 2021.

====Max After Dark====
Cinemax&#x27;s late-night block, Max After Dark, featured softcore pornographic films and original series with TV-MA or R ratings, primarily for strong sexual content and nudity. This block, which began on May 4, 1984, as &quot;Cinemax Friday After Dark&quot;, expanded to seven nights a week by the late 1990s. Programs included &quot;Lingerie&quot;, &quot;Life on Top&quot;, &quot;Femme Fatales&quot;, and &quot;Topless Prophet&quot;. The block was known for its lenient scheduling around mainstream films and series and was often humorously referred to as &quot;Skinemax&quot;.

The adult content was not limited to the main Cinemax channel but also aired on multiplex channels like MoreMax, ActionMax, ThrillerMax, and OuterMax. However, channels like MovieMax and 5StarMax avoided adult programming. The block&#x27;s presence, alongside other HBO channels, was partly due to the FCC&#x27;s content regulations not applying to cable networks.

By 2013, Cinemax began reducing Max After Dark content to focus more on original programming, as internet porn&#x27;s prevalence made the block&#x27;s content seem relatively tame compared to HBO&#x27;s original series.

==International distribution==
===Latin America===
A Latin American version of Cinemax was launched on September 5, 1993, airing movies old and new, as well as television series and miniseries. Starting June 1, 2010, it became an ad-supported basic cable channel in the region. Original series would air on HBO&#x27;s premium suite in Latin America.

===Asia===

Cinemax began broadcasting in 1996, featuring action, comedy, science fiction, and western movies. The channel was known as Max from 2009 to 2012.

===Central Europe===
Launched in February 2005, Cinemax focused on festival, indie, European, and classic films. Cinemax and Cinemax 2 are available in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia, and expanded to certain Balkan countries in 2009. Initially a timeshift channel, Cinemax 2 started airing a distinct schedule from 2016.

<text>Les Fleurs du mal (; ) is a volume of French poetry by Charles Baudelaire.

&quot;Les Fleurs du mal&quot; includes nearly all Baudelaire&#x27;s poetry, written from 1840 until his death in August 1867. First published in 1857, it was important in the symbolist—including painting—and modernist movements. Though it was extremely controversial upon publication, with six of its poems censored due to their immorality, it is now considered a major work of French poetry. The poems in &quot;Les Fleurs du mal&quot; frequently break with tradition, using suggestive images and unusual forms. They deal with themes relating to decadence and eroticism, particularly focusing on suffering and its relationship to original sin, disgust toward evil and oneself, obsession with death, and aspiration toward an ideal world. &quot;Les Fleurs du mal&quot; had a powerful influence on several notable French poets, including Paul Verlaine, Arthur Rimbaud, and Stéphane Mallarmé.

==Overview==
The initial publication of the book was arranged in six thematically segregated sections:

* Spleen et Idéal (Spleen and Ideal)
* Tableaux parisiens (Parisian Scenes)
* Le Vin (Wine)
* Fleurs du mal (Flowers of Evil)
* Révolte (Revolt)
* La Mort (Death)

Baudelaire dedicated the book to the poet Théophile Gautier, &quot;Au parfait magicien des lettres françaises&quot; (&quot;To the perfect magician of French letters&quot;).

===Foreword===
The foreword to the volume, &quot;Au Lecteur&quot; (&quot;To the Reader&quot;), identifying Satan with the pseudonymous alchemist Hermes Trismegistus and calling boredom the worst of miseries, sets the general tone of what is to follow:

&lt;poem&gt;&quot;Si le viol, le poison, le poignard, l&#x27;incendie,&quot;
&quot;N&#x27;ont pas encore brodé de leurs plaisants dessins&quot;
&quot;Le canevas banal de nos piteux destins,&quot;
&quot;C&#x27;est que notre âme, hélas ! n&#x27;est pas assez hardie.&quot;

: If rape, poison, dagger and fire,
: Have still not embroidered their pleasant designs
: On the banal canvas of our pitiable destinies,
: It&#x27;s because our soul, alas, is not bold enough!&lt;/poem&gt;

The preface concludes with the following malediction:

&lt;poem&gt;&quot;C&#x27;est l&#x27;Ennui!—l&#x27;œil chargé d&#x27;un pleur involontaire,&quot;
&quot;Il rêve d&#x27;échafauds en fumant son houka.&quot;
&quot;Tu le connais, lecteur, ce monstre délicat,&quot;
&quot;Hypocrite lecteur,—mon semblable,—mon frère!&quot;

: It&#x27;s Boredom!—eye brimming with an involuntary tear
: He dreams of gallows while smoking his hookah.
: You know him, reader, this delicate monster,
: Hypocritical reader, my likeness, my brother!&lt;/poem&gt;

==&quot;Tableaux Parisiens&quot; (Parisian Scenes)==
Baudelaire&#x27;s section &quot;Tableaux Parisiens&quot;, added in the second edition (1861), is considered one of the most formidable criticisms of 19th-century French modernity. This section contains 18 poems, most of which were written during Haussmann&#x27;s renovation of Paris. Together, the poems in &quot;Tableaux Parisiens&quot; act as 24-hour cycle of Paris, starting with the second poem Le Soleil (The Sun) and ending with the second to last poem Le Crépuscule du Matin (Morning Twilight). The poems featured in this cycle of Paris all deal with the feelings of anonymity and estrangement from a newly modernized city. Baudelaire is critical of the clean and geometrically laid out streets of Paris which alienate the unsung anti-heroes of Paris who serve as inspiration for the poet: the beggar, the blind, the industrial worker, the gambler, the prostitute, the old, and the victim of imperialism. These characters whom Baudelaire once praised as the backbone of Paris are now eulogized in his nostalgic poems. For Baudelaire, the city has been transformed into an anthill of identical bourgeois that reflect the new identical structures that litter a Paris he once called home but can now no longer recognize.

==Literary significance and criticism==
The author and the publisher were prosecuted under the regime of the Second Empire as an &quot;outrage aux bonnes mœurs&quot; (&quot;an insult to public decency&quot;). As a consequence of this prosecution, Baudelaire was fined 300 francs. Six poems from the work were suppressed and the ban on their publication was not lifted in France until 1949. These poems were &quot;Lesbos&quot;; &quot;Femmes damnées (À la pâle clarté)&quot; (or &quot;Women Doomed (In the pale glimmer...)&quot;); &quot;Le Léthé&quot; (or &quot;Lethe&quot;); &quot;À celle qui est trop gaie&quot; (or &quot;To Her Who Is Too Joyful&quot;); &quot;Les Bijoux&quot; (or &quot;The Jewels&quot;); and &quot;Les Métamorphoses du Vampire&quot; (or &quot;The Vampire&#x27;s Metamorphoses&quot;). These were later published in Brussels in a small volume titled &quot;Les Épaves&quot; (&quot;Scraps&quot; or &quot;Jetsam&quot;).

On the other hand, upon reading &quot;The Swan&quot; (or &quot;&quot;Le Cygne&quot;) from &quot;Les Fleurs du mal&quot;, Victor Hugo announced that Baudelaire had created &quot;un nouveau frisson&quot; (a new shudder, a new thrill) in literature.

In the wake of the prosecution, a second edition was issued in 1861 which added 35 new poems, removed the six suppressed poems, and added a new section titled &quot;Tableaux Parisiens&quot;. Among the new poems was the widely-studied &quot;L&#x27;albatros&quot; (&quot;The Albatross&quot;).

A posthumous third edition, with a preface by Théophile Gautier and including 14 previously unpublished poems, was issued in 1868.

<text>A spaceport or cosmodrome is a site for launching or receiving spacecraft, by analogy to a seaport for ships or an airport for aircraft. The word &quot;spaceport&quot;, and even more so &quot;cosmodrome&quot;, has traditionally been used for sites capable of launching spacecraft into orbit around Earth or on interplanetary trajectories. However, rocket launch sites for purely sub-orbital flights are sometimes called spaceports, as in recent years new and proposed sites for suborbital human flights have been frequently referred to or named &quot;spaceports&quot;. Space stations and proposed future bases on the Moon are sometimes called spaceports, in particular if intended as a base for further journeys.

The term rocket launch site is used for any facility from which rockets are launched. It may contain one or more launch pads or suitable sites to mount a transportable launch pad. It is typically surrounded by a large safety area, often called a rocket range or missile range. The range includes the area over which launched rockets are expected to fly through, and within which some components of the rockets may land. Tracking stations are sometimes located in the range to assess the progress of the launches.

Major spaceports often include more than one launch complex, which can be rocket launch sites adapted for different types of launch vehicles. (These sites can be well-separated for safety reasons.) For launch vehicles with liquid propellant, suitable storage facilities and, in some cases, production facilities are necessary. On-site processing facilities for solid propellants are also common.

A spaceport may also include runways for takeoff and landing of aircraft to support spaceport operations, or to enable support of horizontal takeoff and horizontal landing (HTHL) or horizontal takeoff and vertical landing (HTVL) winged launch vehicles.

In January 2025, traffic jams were reported to be forming at U.S. rocket-launch sites due to the increasing volume of flights by companies like Space X, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic. Three sites in Florida and California currently handle the majority of U.S. rocket launches.

==History==

The first rockets to reach space were V-2 rockets launched from Peenemünde, Germany in 1944 during World War II. After the war, 70 complete V-2 rockets were brought to White Sands for test launches, with 47 of them reaching altitudes between 100 km and 213 km.

The world&#x27;s first spaceport for orbital and human launches, the Baikonur Cosmodrome in southern Kazakhstan, started as a Soviet military rocket range in 1955. It achieved the first orbital flight (Sputnik 1) in October 1957. The exact location of the cosmodrome was initially held secret. Guesses to its location were misdirected by a name in common with a mining town 320 km away. The position became known in 1957 outside the Soviet Union only after U-2 planes had identified the site by following railway lines in the Kazakh SSR, although Soviet authorities did not confirm the location for decades.

The Baikonur Cosmodrome achieved the first launch of a human into space (Yuri Gagarin) in 1961. The launch complex used, Site 1, has reached a special symbolic significance and is commonly called Gagarin&#x27;s Start. Baikonur was the primary Soviet cosmodrome, and is still frequently used by Russia under a lease arrangement with Kazakhstan.

In response to the early Soviet successes, the United States built up a major spaceport complex at Cape Canaveral in Florida. A large number of uncrewed flights, as well as the early human flights, were carried out at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. For the Apollo programme, an adjacent spaceport, Kennedy Space Center, was constructed, and achieved the first crewed mission to the lunar surface (Apollo 11) in July 1969. It was the base for all Space Shuttle launches and most of their runway landings. For details on the launch complexes of the two spaceports, see List of Cape Canaveral and Merritt Island launch sites.

The Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guiana, is the major European spaceport, with satellite launches that benefit from the location 5 degrees north of the equator.

In October 2003 the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center achieved the first Chinese human spaceflight.

Breaking with tradition, in June 2004 on a runway at Mojave Air and Space Port, California, a human was for the first time launched to space in a privately funded, suborbital spaceflight, that was intended to pave the way for future commercial spaceflights. The spacecraft, SpaceShipOne, was launched by a carrier airplane taking off horizontally.

At Cape Canaveral, SpaceX in 2015 made the first successful landing and recovery of a first stage used in a vertical satellite launch.

== Location ==
Rockets can most easily reach satellite orbits if launched near the equator in an easterly direction, as this maximizes use of the Earth&#x27;s rotational speed (465 m/s at the equator). Such launches also provide a desirable orientation for arriving at a geostationary orbit. For polar orbits and Molniya orbits this does not apply.

In principle, advantages of high altitude launch are reduced vertical distance to travel and a thinner atmosphere for the rocket to penetrate. However, altitude of the launch site is not a driving factor in spaceport placement because most of the delta-v for a launch is spent on achieving the required horizontal orbital speed. The small gain from a few kilometers of extra altitude does not usually off-set the logistical costs of ground transport in mountainous terrain.

Many spaceports have been placed at existing military installations, such as intercontinental ballistic missile ranges, which are not always physically ideal sites for launch.

A rocket launch site is built as far as possible away from major population centers in order to not inconvenience their inhabitants with noise pollution and other undesired industrial activity, as well as mitigate risk to bystanders should a rocket experience a catastrophic failure. In many cases a launch site is built close to major bodies of water to ensure that no components are shed over populated areas, be it by staging or an in-flight failure. Typically a spaceport site is large enough that, should a vehicle explode, it will not endanger human lives or adjacent launch pads.

Planned sites of spaceports for sub-orbital tourist spaceflight often make use of existing ground infrastructure, including runways. The nature of the local view from altitude is also a factor to consider.

== Space tourism ==

The space tourism industry (see List of private spaceflight companies) is being targeted by spaceports in numerous locations worldwide. e.g. Spaceport America, New Mexico.

The establishment of spaceports for tourist trips raises legal issues, which are only beginning to be addressed.

==With achieved vertical launches of humans==
The following is a table of spaceports and launch complexes for vertical launchers with documented achieved launches of humans to space (more than altitude). The sorting order is spaceport by spaceport according to the time of the first human launch.

† Three of the Soyuz missions were uncrewed and are not counted (Soyuz 2, Soyuz 20, Soyuz 34).

‡ STS-51-L (&quot;Challenger&quot;) failed to reach orbit and is not counted. STS-107 (&quot;Columbia&quot;) reached orbit and is therefore included in the count (disaster struck on re-entry).

Crewed Missions failed to reach Kármán line:

Soyuz T-10a (1983)

STS-51-L (1986)

Soyuz MS-10 (2018)

==With achieved satellite launches==
The following is a table of spaceports with a documented achieved launch to orbit. The table is sorted according to the time of the first launch that achieved satellite orbit insertion. The first column gives the geographical location. Operations from a different country are indicated in the fourth column. A launch is counted as one also in cases where the payload consists of multiple satellites.

==With achieved horizontal launches of humans to 100 km==
The following table shows spaceports with documented achieved launches of humans to at least 100 km altitude, starting from a horizontal runway. All the flights were sub-orbital.

== Beyond Earth ==
Spaceports have been proposed for locations on the Moon, Mars, orbiting the Earth, at Sun-Earth and Earth-Moon Lagrange points, and at other locations in the Solar System. Human-tended outposts on the Moon or Mars, for example, will be spaceports by definition. The 2012 Space Studies Program of the International Space University studied the economic benefit of a network of spaceports throughout the solar system beginning from Earth and expanding outwardly in phases, within its team project Operations And Service Infrastructure for Space (OASIS). Its analysis claimed that the first phase, placing the &quot;Node 1&quot; spaceport with space tug services in low Earth orbit (LEO), would be commercially profitable and reduce transportation costs to geosynchronous orbit by as much as 44% (depending on the launch vehicle). The second phase would add a Node 2 spaceport on the lunar surface to provide services including lunar ice mining and delivery of rocket propellants back to Node 1. This would enable lunar surface activities and further reduce transportation costs within and out from cislunar space. The third phase would add a Node 3 spaceport on the Martian moon Phobos to enable refueling and resupply prior to Mars surface landings, missions beyond Mars, and return trips to Earth. In addition to propellant mining and refueling, the network of spaceports could provide services such as power storage and distribution, in-space assembly and repair of spacecraft, communications relay, shelter, construction and leasing of infrastructure, maintaining spacecraft positioned for future use, and logistics.

==Impact==
Space launch facilities have been colonial developments and have also been impacting its surroundings by destroying or polluting their environment, creating precarious cleanup situations.

<doc id="179179" wikidata="Q233118" url="?curid=179179" title="Traci Lords">
<text>Traci Elizabeth Lords (born Nora Louise Kuzma; May 7, 1968), is an American actress and singer. She entered the porn industry using a fake birth certificate to conceal that she was two years under the legal age of 18. Lords starred in pornographic films and was one of the most sought-after actresses in that industry during her career. When the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) acted on an anonymous tip that Lords was a minor during her time in the industry, and that pornographers were distributing and selling these illegal images and videotapes, the resulting fallout led to prosecution of those responsible for creating and distributing the tapes, but the prosecutions fell through when it was revealed she was using a real federal passport as her proof of age along with a fake birth certificate and fake California driver&#x27;s license (which were used to obtain the passport). In addition, all of her porn films (except the last) and the September 1984 edition of &quot;Penthouse&quot; were banned as child pornography. Her last porn movie was filmed two days after her 18th birthday, by her own company.

After leaving the pornography industry two days after turning the legal age of eighteen, Lords enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theater Institute, where she studied method acting with the intention of becoming a mainstream actress. She made her mainstream screen debut at age nineteen in a leading role in the 1988 remake of the 1957 Roger Corman science fiction film &quot;Not of This Earth&quot;. Lords followed with the role of Wanda Woodward in John Waters&#x27; teen comedy, &quot;Cry-Baby&quot; (1990). Her other acting credits included the television series &quot;MacGyver&quot;, &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;, &quot;Roseanne&quot;, &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, &quot;Profiler&quot;, &quot;First Wave&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Gilmore Girls,&quot; and &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;. She also appeared in films such as &quot;Skinner&quot; (1993)&quot;, Virtuosity&quot; (1995), &quot;Blade&quot; (1998), &quot;Zack and Miri Make a Porno&quot; (2008), and &quot;Excision&quot; (2012), which earned her a Fangoria Chainsaw Award for Best Supporting Actress as well as a Fright Meter Award and a CinEuphoria Award.

Lords pursued music in addition to her film career. After her song &quot;Love Never Dies&quot; was featured on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Pet Sematary Two&quot; (1992), she was signed to Radioactive Records and subsequently released her debut studio album, &quot;1000 Fires&quot; (1995) to generally positive reviews. Despite the poor sales of the album, the lead single &quot;Control&quot; had moderate commercial success. It peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Songs chart and was included on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (1995), which was eventually certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In 2003, Lords published her autobiography, &quot;Traci Lords: Underneath It All&quot;, which received positive reviews from critics and debuted at number 31 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

== Early life ==

Traci Lords was born Nora Louise Kuzma on May 7, 1968, in Steubenville, Ohio, to Louis and Patricia Kuzma. Her father&#x27;s parents were of Ukrainian descent, while her mother was of Irish ancestry. Louis was employed as a steelworker. Lords has one elder sister and two younger sisters. Her parents divorced when she was seven years old and Lords moved with her mother and three sisters to her great-grandmother&#x27;s house. Following the divorce, her alcoholic, abusive father got partial custody. Around that same time, her mother enrolled at Ohio University and became employed part-time.

When Lords was 12, she moved with her mother, her mother&#x27;s new boyfriend, and sisters to Redondo Beach, California. She did not see her father for many years after. In September 1982, she began attending Redondo Union High School but dropped out at age 15 to enter the porn industry. During her early school years, Lords developed a rebellious attitude. She was angry at her mother and found a father figure in her mother&#x27;s boyfriend Roger Hayes, as she calls him in her autobiography. He was a drug abuser and molested Lords in her sleep. According to Lords, this and a rape by a 16-year-old boy in school she had been seeing, which she called &quot;the single most traumatizing thing that ever happened to me in my life&quot;, would be what eventually drove her into pornography. Lords has stated, &quot;My damage drove me into porn. I mean, I was a little girl. And I had like all of this stuff. I&#x27;d been raped. I&#x27;d been molested. I&#x27;d been abused. I was messed up. And I was angry. And the same thing that later helped me to change my life when I was 18 and out of that world that helped me to get sober and helped me to gather the courage to go and do the work I needed to do, to look at some things in my life that were so ugly.&quot; After her mother broke up with Hayes due to his drug use, she began dating his friend. Lords refused to follow them to a new place and was left with her older sister Lorraine. Her mother and two younger sisters eventually found a new apartment.

== Career ==
=== 1984–1986: Pornography career ===
At age 15, Lords became pregnant by her high school boyfriend. Afraid of her mother&#x27;s reaction, she went to Hayes for help. He arranged for her to have an abortion without her mother&#x27;s knowledge. Looking for a job to get some money, she was introduced to Hayes&#x27; friend and started working for her as a babysitter. The woman offered to improve Lords&#x27;s job opportunities by helping her get a fake driver&#x27;s license. She provided Lords with a new birth certificate on condition that if she were ever caught she would say that she had stolen the phony identification. Lords now had the alias Kristie Elizabeth Nussman and a new driver&#x27;s license that stated she was 20 rather than 15 years old. In February 1984, she answered a newspaper advertisement for Jim South&#x27;s World Modeling Talent Agency. Posing as her stepfather, Hayes drove her to the agency. After signing a contract, she began working as a nude model and appeared in magazines such as &quot;Velvet&quot;, &quot;Juggs&quot;, and &quot;Club&quot;. During August, when she was selected to model for &quot;Penthouse&quot; magazine&#x27;s September 1984 15th-anniversary issue, Lords was asked to choose a stage name. According to a 1988 interview, she chose Traci—one of the popular names she had longed for growing up—and Lords, after the actor Jack Lord, since she was a fan of the television series &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, in which he played Steve McGarrett. (&quot;Tracy Lord&quot; was also the name of Katharine Hepburn&#x27;s character in the 1940 film &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot;.)

Lords made the first of many porn movies in 1984, when she appeared in &quot;What Gets Me Hot!&quot; alongside Tom Byron, who later became her boyfriend offscreen. She first appeared only in a non-sexual role but was later replaced with a hardcore scene. In her next movie, &quot;Those Young Girls&quot;, she appeared in a sex role alongside Harry Reems and Ginger Lynn. After turning 16 and appearing with John Leslie (an actor 23 years her senior) in the porno parody &quot;Talk Dirty to Me Part III&quot; (which won the AVN Award for the best movie), Lords was hailed as the &quot;Princess of Porn&quot;. She became one of the highest-paid porn actresses of that time, earning more than $1,000 a day. Besides her work in porn, she also appeared in the music video for &quot;Gimme Gimme Good Lovin&#x27;&quot; by the heavy metal band Helix. Lords continued making more movies until late 1984 when she tried to quit the industry at age 16, but returned a few months later. Just before her 17th birthday, she met Stuart Dell, who became her boyfriend, manager, and business partner - Dell used the pseudonym Steven (or Stephen) Cartier. Together they formed the Traci Lords Company. Dell and Lords made a distribution deal with Sy Adler, an industry veteran who ran Vantage International, in which they would produce three movies for the company. In March 1986, the first TLC feature was released; titled &quot;Traci Takes Tokyo&quot;, it was shot in Tokyo around Christmas Day 1985. The second, &quot;Beverly Hills Copulator&quot;, was released afterwards, but the third movie, &quot;Screamer&quot;, was shelved.

During late May 1986 (around three weeks after Lords&#x27; 18th birthday), authorities were informed that she had been underage when she appeared in the porn movies. She had lied (according to Lords, it was a &quot;white lie&quot;) to law enforcement, photographers, producers, directors, co-workers, and the general public for two years. The owners of her movie agency and X-Citement Video, Inc. were arrested (see &quot;United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc.&quot;). She was taken into protective custody and hired high-profile lawyer Leslie Abramson. On July 10, district attorney&#x27;s investigators searched Lords&#x27; Redondo Beach home as well as the Sun Valley offices of Vantage International Productions (a major producer of adult movies) and the Sherman Oaks offices of modeling agent Jim South. South and other industry officials said that Lords, who was seeking employment, provided a California driver&#x27;s license, a U.S. passport, and a birth certificate, which stated that her name was Kristie Nussman and gave a birth date of November 17, 1962. Leslie Jay, a spokeswoman for&quot; Penthouse&quot; publisher Bob Guccione, also said Lords showed identification indicating that she was older than 18 before the illicit photos for the September 1984 issue were taken. When investigators used Lords&#x27; fake birth certificate and fake state identification cards to locate the real Kristie Nussman, Nussman said that her birth certificate had been stolen a few years earlier and that an impostor had apparently forged her name on official forms. Two adults who knew Lords, but who requested anonymity, said they saw her picture in the adult magazine &quot;Velvet&quot; during July 1984 and telephoned the district attorney&#x27;s office to inform authorities that she was underage, but that an investigator told them, &quot;There isn&#x27;t anything we can do about it.&quot;

On July 17, 1986, video rental shops and adult movie theaters in the US scrambled to remove from their inventory all hardcore material featuring Lords in order to avoid prosecution for distributing child pornography. John Weston, attorney of the Adult Film Association of America, said distributors should withdraw any movie made before May 1986, featuring Lords &quot;in sexual conduct, no matter how briefly.&quot; The withdrawal of Lords&#x27; movies from the market cost the industry millions of dollars. Government prosecutors declared that Lords was a victim of a manipulative industry, maintaining that she was drugged and made to do non-consensual acts. Industry insiders, including Ron Jeremy, Tom Byron, Peter North, and Ginger Lynn said they never saw her use drugs and that she was always fully aware of her actions. While most of Lords&#x27; movies were permanently removed from distribution in the United States, several were re-edited to remove her scenes (such as &quot;Kinky Business&quot; and &quot;New Wave Hookers&quot;) or, in a few cases, had new footage filmed with a different actress playing her part (as in &quot;Talk Dirty to Me Part III&quot;). Her only porn movie legally available in the United States is &quot;Traci, I Love You&quot;, filmed in Cannes, France two days after her 18th birthday.

=== 1987–1991: Transition to mainstream, &quot;Not of This Earth&quot; and &quot;Cry-Baby&quot; ===
After spending several months in therapy, Lords decided to concentrate on acting. She enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute, where she studied method acting for three months. After leaving the school, Lords placed an advertisement in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; looking for representation. She was contacted by Fred Westheimer and although the agency declined to officially represent her, he decided to send her out on a few auditions. As a result, she was offered a guest role in an episode of the television series &quot;Wiseguy&quot;. Shortly afterwards, she met the director Jim Wynorski, who was directing the remake of Roger Corman&#x27;s 1957 sci-fi classic &quot;Not of This Earth&quot;. He immediately cast Lords into the lead role of Nadine Story, and &quot;Not of This Earth&quot; (1988) became her first mainstream film debut since her departure from the adult film industry. Although the film failed at the box office, it did well in video sales. Based on that success, Lords was offered to appear in Wynorski&#x27;s next film, &quot;The Haunting of Morella&quot; (1989). However, Lords turned down the offer due to the requirement of having a nude scene, since she was trying to establish herself as a serious actress. She also signed with a modeling agency under her birth name Nora Kuzma and appeared on two covers of Joe Weider&#x27;s magazine &quot;Muscle &amp; Fitness&quot;. Around that time, Lords became a spokesperson for Children of the Night, an organization for runaways and abused children, and was planning to release a book titled &quot;Out of the Blue: The Traci Lords Story&quot;.

In November 1988, Lords enrolled in another acting class and again began looking for an agent. In December, she mass-mailed her resumé to various agents and arranged a meeting with Don Gerler. Lords auditioned for the part of Breathless Mahoney in the film &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; (1990), but the role went to Madonna. TraciLords.com states &quot;John Waters called her a Sexual Terrorist&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;palmspringslife/traci-lords&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BWW/Lords-WBB&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cheatsheet/depps-cry-baby-co-star&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; By May 1989, John Waters cast her for his teenage comedy musical &quot;Cry-Baby&quot; (1990). She won the role and appeared in the film alongside Johnny Depp and Ricki Lake.&lt;ref name=&quot;vanityfair/Hirshey/WATERS&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The film was a critical and commercial success, and her portrayal of the rebellious teenager Wanda Woodward established her as a legitimate actress. On the set of the film, she met the property master Brook Yeaton, whom she began dating. The couple married in September 1990 in Baltimore, Maryland. In June 1990, the exercise video &quot;Warm up with Traci Lords&quot; was released. Directed and produced by her former boyfriend and business partner Stewart Dell, the video had been filmed in early 1988. As Lords wrote in her autobiography, she was unsatisfied with the final version of the video. An extended version was reissued in 1993 under the title &quot;Traci Lords: Advanced Jazzthetics&quot;.

In 1991, Lords starred in the thriller &quot;Raw Nerve&quot; and the action crime film &quot;A Time to Die&quot;. Lords appeared in such popular TV shows as &quot;Roseanne&quot;, &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, &quot;MacGyver&quot; and &quot;Hercules&quot;. She continued modeling and walked the runway for fashion designers such as Janet Howard and Thierry Mugler.

=== 1992–1996: Breakthrough, &quot;1000 Fires&quot; and &quot;Melrose Place&quot; ===
During 1992, Lords decided to emphasize her career as a recording artist. She first signed a development deal with Capitol Records. After meeting with Rodney Bingenheimer at a birthday party, she was recommended to Jeff Jacklin, who hired her to record the song &quot;Love Never Dies&quot; for the movie &quot;Pet Sematary Two&quot; (1992). The producer of the soundtrack, Gary Kurfirst, signed Lords to his company Radioactive Records. She was later featured on the songs &quot;Little Baby Nothing&quot; by Manic Street Preachers and &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; by Ramones. During 1993, Lords was cast in the television adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s novel &quot;The Tommyknockers&quot;.

During the spring of 1994, Lords began working on her debut album. The company arranged her to fly to London and meet with producer Tom Bailey. After finishing her recording with Bailey, Lords was introduced to producer Ben Watkins of Juno Reactor with whom she recorded more techno-influenced songs. She later met Mike Edwards, the main singer of the band Jesus Jones. Around the same time, Lords was cast in the television series &quot;Roseanne&quot;, appearing in three episodes. During January 1995, Lords appeared in four episodes of the television series &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, where she played the part of Rikki Abbott. Her debut studio album, &quot;1000 Fires&quot;, was released on February 28, 1995. It received generally positive reviews and the lead single &quot;Control&quot; peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Songs. An instrumental version of &quot;Control&quot; was remixed and released on the soundtrack to &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (1995), which was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;, was also successful in charts, peaking at number eleven on Hot Dance Club Songs. The Paul Oakenfold remix of the song was included on the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Virtuosity&quot; (1995), in which Lords had a cameo appearance. After the release of the album, Lords embarked on a small tour performing as a DJ, mostly in Miami nightclubs. On August 12, 1995, she was the opening act of the Lollapalooza after-party, Enit Festival, alongside Moby, Sven Väth, DJ Keoki and Single Cell Orchestra.

By the end of 1995, Lords divorced her husband of five years, Brook Yeaton. In 1996, she appeared in a commercial for Guess with Juliette Lewis.

=== 1997–2002: &quot;Profiler&quot;, &quot;Blade&quot; and &quot;First Wave&quot; ===
In 1997, Lords appeared in a small part in the Gregg Araki film &quot;Nowhere&quot;, and starred in the drama thriller &quot;Stir&quot;. She also guest starred on television series &quot;Nash Bridges&quot; and &quot;Viper&quot;. In November, she became a recurring cast member in the second season of the crime television series &quot;Profiler&quot;. She played a felon, Sharon Lesher, who is manipulated by a serial killer Jack-of-All-Trades and eventually becomes his partner in crime Jill-of-All-Trades. In 1998, Lords had a supporting role in the crime thriller &quot;Boogie Boy&quot; and starred in the drama &quot;Extramarital&quot;. She also appeared in the action horror film &quot;Blade&quot; (1998) in which she played the vampire seductress Racquel. Lords was eventually approached to appear in the sequel &quot;Blade II&quot; (2002) portraying Racquel&#x27;s twin sister Valerine in seeking of vengeance upon Blade. However, she turned down the offer because of her contradictory schedule. At the premiere of the film, Lords announced she was finishing her sophomore album on Radioactive Records that would be released in the spring of 1999. However, it was later neglected after she left the record label. In August, Lords ended her two-year relationship with John Enos after they reportedly got into an argument because her cat was killed by one of Enos&#x27; dogs.

In 2000, Lords had lead roles in the films &quot;Epicenter&quot; and &quot;Chump Change&quot;. Her role of Sam in the romantic comedy &quot;Chump Change&quot; earned her the Film Discovery Jury Award for Best Actress at the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival. In September, she became a regular cast member in the third season of the Sci-fi Channel television series &quot;First Wave&quot;, becoming the first recurring female character to be featured on the series. She played Jordan Radcliffe, an heiress and leader of the Human Resistance Group &quot;The Raven Nation&quot; after the aliens used her brother to murder her parents.

=== 2003–2006: &quot;Underneath It All&quot; ===

Her autobiography, &quot;Traci Lords: Underneath It All&quot;, was published during July 2003 by HarperCollins. In the book, Lords chronicled her childhood, career, and two-year stint in the X-rated industry. The book received positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success, making &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. It was criticized by pornographers, who claim they were the victims. In the book, Lords revealed that she received about $35,000 as total compensation for all her porno movies, including the $5,000 for her underage appearance in &quot;Penthouse&quot;. Lords continued to use the now-famous stage name that she had given herself as a minor and ultimately made it her legal name. She explained, &quot;I chose to stop running from it. Instead, I own it, legally changing my name to Traci Elizabeth Lords. That&#x27;s who I was, and that&#x27;s who I was going to be.&quot; In her interview with Oprah Winfrey she stated: &quot;I found you can run, but you cannot hide.&quot;

During 2003, it was announced that Lords was working on new music and had recorded a cover version of Missing Persons&#x27; song &quot;Walking In L.A.&quot;. Directed by Mike Ruiz, the music video was premiered during her interview on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;. On December 28, 2004, she independently released two songs, &quot;Sunshine&quot; and &quot;You Burn Inside of Me&quot;, via online music store CD Baby. Both of the songs along with &quot;What Cha Gonna Do&quot; were featured in the television series &quot;Joan of Arcadia&quot;. &quot;You Burn Inside of Me&quot; was also used in the commercial for Duprey Cosmetics, in which Lords appeared. She signed to Sea To Sun records the following year, and released the chart-topping single &quot;Last Drag&quot;.

=== 2007–2009: Motherhood and &quot;Zack and Miri Make a Porno&quot; ===
By the beginning of 2007, Lords became unexpectedly pregnant. She first announced her pregnancy in June: &quot;I kind of thought the children thing was off the table. Now I&#x27;m expecting a boy! We&#x27;re stunned and thrilled. I just want you to know, these 36-Ds are mine. I haven&#x27;t had a boob job, she laughed! I am 5 months pregnant! But now I&#x27;m starting to show. And my husband is happy with the changes in my figure.&quot; On October 7, 2007, at the age of 39, she gave birth to a son, her first child with her husband of five years, Jeff Lee.

In January 2008, it was announced that Lords had been cast in Kevin Smith&#x27;s comedy &quot;Zack and Miri Make a Porno&quot; (2008). She said that at first she wanted to refuse but changed her mind after reading the script. &quot;It was really great that in taking the movie because I didn&#x27;t plan on going back to work right away, but I was dying to work with Kevin. I never thought it would be on something called &quot;Zack and Miri Make a Porno&quot;. What? So I went and I read the script at his house and I was prepared to say no. I thought I have the perfect out. I just had a kid. No one is going to blame me if I say I just can&#x27;t do this right now. But it made me laugh out loud and it made me just literally cry. It was just funny.&quot; Initially, the character had a topless scene in the movie, but Lords refused. &quot;I&#x27;m done with all that,&quot; she said. Lords chose to breastfeed her son in between takes instead. Katie Morgan, a pornographic actress, also appeared in the film.

In 2009, Lords appeared in the direct-to-DVD science fiction movie, &quot;Princess of Mars&quot;, alongside Antonio Sabàto Jr. She was disappointed by the final project. &quot;Somewhere in my heart of hearts, I was worried that it might be a crummy movie. The production was just too careless. But I believed the voices of those around me who said &#x27;No, it&#x27;ll be artistic, no, it&#x27;ll be creative. You&#x27;ll look beautiful. We have a very limited budget but honest, you&#x27;ll be proud.&#x27; They were wrong, it was very bad. At least that was what I was told. After watching the first two minutes I had to turn it off and hide under the covers.&quot;

=== 2010–2014: Return to music and &quot;Excision&quot; ===
In March 2010, Lords announced she began working on her new album with &quot;Pretty&quot; being the lead single. However, the project was later shelved and &quot;Pretty&quot; was released as a promotional single only. Lords starred in the drama comedy &quot;Au Pair, Kansas&quot; which premiered in April 2011 at the Kansas City FilmFest. In July, Lords officially signed to independent record label Sea To Sun Recordings and in October made her musical comeback with the song &quot;Last Drag&quot;. The single was successful in dance charts debuting at number forty-five and eventually peaking at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Club Songs.
Lords starred alongside AnnaLynne McCord and Ariel Winter in the horror film &quot;Excision&quot; (2012), which premiered in January 2012 at the Sundance Film Festival. Her portrayal of the controlling mother Phyllis earned Lords Fangoria Chainsaw Award for Best Supporting Actress as well as Fright Meter Award and CinEuphoria Award. In September, Lords released a compilation of dance music &quot;Traci Lords Presents: M2F2&quot; (2012). It featured three of her own remixed tracks as well as songs by other artists. The song &quot;He&#x27;s My Bitch&quot; managed to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Club Songs peaking at number twenty-five. Lords also voiced the character of Layla Stockton in the 2012 video game &quot;&quot;. Following the Steubenville High School rape case, Lords spoke up on the topic and subsequently released the song &quot;Stupidville&quot; as a response to the case. &quot;I was born in Steubenville, Ohio and I was raped in there. So was my mother. I think there&#x27;s a sickness in that city,&quot; Lords said. In 2013, Lords appeared in the horror movie &quot;Devil May Call&quot; (2013) and an episode of the web series &quot;EastSiders&quot;. She was nominated for the Best Guest Star – Drama at the 2014 Indie Series Awards.

=== 2015–present: fashion career and upcoming directorial debut ===
In May 2015, Lords appeared in an episode of the fourth season of the reality television series &quot;Celebrity Wife Swap&quot;, where she swapped lives with Jackée Harry. Lords co-starred in Jim Wynorski&#x27;s television horror &quot;Sharkansas Women&#x27;s Prison Massacre&quot; (2015) and made her second appearance as Val on the series &quot;EastSiders&quot;. In March 2016, Lords co-starred in the television thriller &quot;Nightmare Nurse&quot; (2016) in which she played a psychopathic nurse looking for revenge for her dead husband. Lords voiced several characters in the action-adventure video game &quot;Hitman&quot; (2016) after having had previously voiced the character of Layla Stockton in &quot;&quot; (2012).

In June, Lords announced her collaboration with Pinup Girl Clothing. The first pieces from her collection were inspired by the character of Wanda Woodward from &quot;Cry-Baby&quot; (1990) as well as 1950s fashion; the clothing line is available exclusively through the Pinup Girl Clothing website. She commented on her inspiration behind the line: &quot;John [Waters] wrote such strong characters in &quot;Cry-Baby&quot;. And in that rockabilly, punk rock, vintage pin-up girl kind of world, Wanda Woodward is pretty much a queen.&quot;

In 2016, Lords co-starred in the Viaplay original comedy series &quot;Swedish Dicks&quot;. She played Jane McKinney, a private investigator and competitor of the show&#x27;s protagonist. In October, the series was renewed for a second season with Lords as a confirmed cast member. In the United States, the first season premiered in August 2017. Later that month, Lords confirmed she would direct her first feature film called &quot;The Unquiet Grave&quot;. Filming was scheduled to commence in 2017. In November, it was announced that Lords voiced the character of Jackal Z in the upcoming video game &quot;Let It Die&quot; (2016), and will appear on the third season of &quot;EastSiders&quot;. In July 2017, Helmut Lang&#x27;s fashion campaign for the Fall 2017 collection featuring Lords was unveiled. In May 2018, Lords released the single &quot;Come Alive&quot; as a gift for her fans in celebration of her 50th birthday. Following the release it was announced that she began working on an EP with Adam Barta and Jordan Von Haslow. In July 2018, the second season of &quot;Swedish Dicks&quot; premiered in the United States.

In 2019, Lords starred in a Los Angeles revival of the stage play &quot;Women Behind Bars&quot;.

<text>The history of Florida can be traced to when the first Paleo-Indians began to inhabit the peninsula as early as 14,000 years ago. They left behind artifacts and archeological remains. Florida&#x27;s written history begins with the arrival of Europeans; the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León in 1513 made the first textual records. The state received its name from that &quot;conquistador&quot;, who called the peninsula &quot;La Pascua Florida&quot; in recognition of the verdant landscape and because it was the Easter season, which the Spaniards called &quot;Pascua Florida&quot; (Festival of Flowers).

This area was the first mainland realm of the United States to be settled by Europeans, starting in 1513. Since then Florida has had many waves of colonization and immigration, including French and Spanish settlement during the 16th century, as well as entry of new Native American groups migrating from elsewhere in the South, and free black people and fugitive slaves, who in the 19th century became allied with the Native Americans as Black Seminoles. Florida was under colonial rule by Spain from the 16th century to the 19th century, and briefly by Great Britain during the 18th century (1763–1783). Neither Spain nor Britain maintained a large military or civilian population. It became a territory of the United States in 1821. Two decades later, on March 3, 1845, Florida was admitted to the Union as the 27th U.S. state.

Florida is nicknamed the &quot;Sunshine State&quot; due to its warm climate and days of sunshine. Florida&#x27;s sunny climate, many beaches, and growth of industries have attracted northern migrants within the United States, international migrants, and vacationers since the Florida land boom of the 1920s. A diverse population, urbanization, and a diverse economy would develop in Florida throughout the 20th century. In 2014, Florida with over 19 million people, surpassed New York and became the third most populous state in the U.S.

The economy of Florida has changed over its history, starting with natural resource exploitation in logging, mining, fishing, and sponge diving; as well as cattle ranching, farming, and citrus growing. The tourism, real estate, trade, banking, and retirement destination businesses would develop as economic sectors later on.

==Early history==

===Geology===
The foundation of Florida was located in the continent of Gondwana at the South Pole 650 million years ago (Mya). When Gondwana collided with the continent of Laurentia 300 Mya, it had moved further north. 200 Mya, the merged continents containing what would be Florida, had moved north of the equator. By then, Florida was surrounded by desert, in the middle of a new continent, Pangaea. When Pangaea broke up 115 mya, Florida assumed a shape as a peninsula.
The emergent landmass of Florida was Orange Island, a low-relief island sitting atop the carbonate Florida Platform which emerged about 34 to 28 million years ago. When glaciation locked up the world&#x27;s water, starting 2.58 million years ago, the sea level dropped precipitously. It was approximately lower than present levels. As a result, the Florida peninsula not only emerged, but had a land area about twice what it is today. Florida also had a drier and cooler climate than in more recent times. There were few flowing rivers or wetlands.

===First Floridians===

Paleo-Indians entered what is now Florida at least 14,000 years ago, during the last glacial period. With lower sea levels, the Florida peninsula was much wider, and the climate was cooler and much drier than in the present day. Fresh water was available only in sinkholes and limestone catchment basins, and paleo-Indian activity centered around these relatively scarce watering holes. Sinkholes and basins in the beds of modern rivers (such as the Page-Ladson site in the Aucilla River) have yielded a rich trove of paleo-Indian artifacts, including Clovis points.

Excavations at an ancient stone quarry (the Container Corporation of America site in Marion County) yielded &quot;crude stone implements&quot; showing signs of extensive wear from deposits below those holding Paleo-Indian artifacts. Thermoluminescence dating and weathering analysis independently gave dates of 26,000 to 28,000 years ago for the creation of the artifacts. The findings are controversial, and funding has not been available for follow-up studies.

As the glaciers began retreating about 8000 BCE, the climate of Florida became warmer and wetter. As the glaciers melted, the sea level rose, reducing the land mass. Many prehistoric habitation sites along the old coastline were slowly submerged, making artifacts from early coastal cultures difficult to find. There were islands throughout Florida as far south as what is now Orlando. The paleo-Indian culture was replaced by, or evolved into, the Early Archaic culture. With an increase in population and more water available, the people occupied many more locations, as evidenced by numerous artifacts. Archaeologists have learned much about the Early Archaic people of Florida from the discoveries made at Windover Pond. The Early Archaic period evolved into the Middle Archaic period around 5000 BC. People started living in villages near wetlands and along the coast at favored sites that were likely occupied for multiple generations.

The Late Archaic period started about 3000 BC, when Florida&#x27;s climate had reached current conditions and the sea had risen close to its present level. People commonly occupied both fresh and saltwater wetlands. Large shell middens accumulated during this period. Many people lived in large villages with purpose-built earthwork mounds, such as at Horr&#x27;s Island, which had the largest permanently occupied community in the Archaic period in the southeastern United States. It also has the oldest burial mound in the East, dating to about 1450 BC. People began making fired pottery in Florida by 2000 BC. By about 500 BC, the Archaic culture, which had been fairly uniform across Florida, began to fragment into regional cultures.

The post-Archaic cultures of eastern and southern Florida developed in relative isolation. It is likely that the peoples living in those areas at the time of first European contact were direct descendants of the inhabitants of the areas in late Archaic and Woodland times. The cultures of the Florida panhandle and the north and central Gulf coast of the Florida peninsula were strongly influenced by the Mississippian culture, producing two local variants known as the Pensacola culture and the Fort Walton culture.

Continuity in cultural history suggests that the peoples of those areas were also descended from the inhabitants of the Archaic period. In the panhandle and the northern part of the peninsula, people adopted cultivation of maize. Its cultivation was restricted or absent among the tribes who lived south of the Timucuan-speaking people (i.e., south of a line approximately from present-day Daytona Beach, Florida to a point on or north of Tampa Bay.) Peoples in southern Florida depended on the rich estuarine environment and developed a highly complex society without agriculture.

===European contact and aftermath===

At the time of first European contact in the early 16th century, Florida was inhabited by an estimated 350,000 people belonging to a number of tribes. (Anthropologist Henry F. Dobyns has estimated that as many as 700,000 people lived in Florida in 1492). The Spanish Empire sent Spanish explorers recording nearly one hundred names of groups they encountered, ranging from organized political entities such as the Apalachee, with a population of around 50,000, to villages with no known political affiliation. There were an estimated 150,000 speakers of dialects of the Timucua language, but the Timucua were organized as groups of villages and did not share a common culture. Other tribes in Florida at the time of first contact included the Ais, Calusa, Jaega, Mayaimi, Tequesta, and Tocobaga.

The populations of all of these tribes decreased markedly during the period of Spanish control of Florida, mostly due to epidemics of newly introduced infectious diseases, to which the Native Americans had no natural immunity. Beginning late in the 17th century, when most of the indigenous peoples were already much reduced in population, peoples from areas to the north of Florida, supplied with arms and occasionally accompanied by white colonists from the Province of Carolina, raided throughout Florida. They burned villages, wounded many of the inhabitants and carried captives back to Charles Towne to be sold into slavery. Most of the villages in Florida were abandoned, and the survivors sought refuge at St. Augustine or in isolated spots around the state. Many tribes became extinct during this period and by the end of the 18th century.

Some of the Apalachee eventually reached Louisiana, where they survived as a distinct group for at least another century. The Spanish evacuated the few surviving members of the Florida tribes to Cuba in 1763 when Spain transferred the territory of Florida to the British Empire following the latter&#x27;s victory against France in the Seven Years&#x27; War. In the aftermath, the Seminole, originally an offshoot of the Creek people who absorbed other groups, developed as a distinct tribe in Florida during the 18th century through the process of ethnogenesis. They have three federally recognized tribes: the largest is the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, formed of descendants since removal in the 1830s; others are the smaller Seminole Tribe of Florida and the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida.

==Colonial battleground==

===First Spanish rule (1513–1763)===



Spanish conqueror and explorer Juan Ponce de León is usually given credit for being the first European to sight Florida in 1513, but he may have had predecessors. Florida and much of the nearby coast is depicted in the Cantino planisphere, an early world map which was surreptitiously copied in 1502 from the most current Portuguese sailing charts and smuggled into Italy a decade before Ponce sailed north from Puerto Rico on his voyage of exploration. Ponce de León may not have even been the first Spaniard to go ashore in Florida; slave traders may have secretly raided native villages before Ponce arrived, as he encountered at least one indigenous tribesman who spoke Spanish. However, Ponce&#x27;s 1513 expedition to Florida was the first open and official one. He also gave Florida its name, which means &quot;full of flowers&quot;. A dubious legend states that Ponce de León was searching for the Fountain of Youth on the island of Bimini, based on information from natives.

On March 3, 1513, Juan Ponce de León organized and equipped three ships for an expedition departing from &quot;Punta Aguada&quot;, Puerto Rico. The expedition included 200 people, including women and free black people.

Although it is often stated that he sighted the peninsula for the first time on March 27, 1513, and thought it was an island, he probably saw one of the Bahamas at that time. He went ashore on Florida&#x27;s east coast during the Spanish Easter feast, Pascua Florida, on April 7 and named the land &quot;La Pascua de la Florida.&quot; After briefly exploring the land south of present-day St. Augustine, the expedition sailed south to the bottom of the Florida peninsula, through the Florida Keys, and up the west coast as far north as Charlotte Harbor, where they briefly skirmished with the Calusa before heading back to Puerto Rico.

From 1513 onward, the land became known as &quot;La Florida&quot;. After 1630, and throughout the 18th century, Tegesta (after the Tequesta tribe) was an alternate name of choice for the Florida peninsula following publication of a map by the Dutch cartographer Hessel Gerritsz in Joannes de Laet&#x27;s &quot;History of the New World&quot;.

Further Spanish attempts to explore and colonize Florida were disastrous. Ponce de León returned to the Charlotte Harbor area in 1521 with equipment and settlers to start a colony, but was soon driven off by hostile Calusa, and de León died in Cuba from wounds received in the fighting. Pánfilo de Narváez&#x27;s expedition explored Florida&#x27;s west coast in 1528, but his violent demands for gold and food led to hostile relations with the Tocobaga and other native groups. Facing starvation and unable to find his support ships, Narváez attempted return to Mexico via rafts, but all were lost at sea and only four members of the expedition survived. Hernando de Soto landed in Florida in 1539 and began a multi-year trek through what is now the southeastern United States in which he found no gold and lost his life. In 1559 Tristán de Luna y Arellano established the first settlement in Pensacola but, after a violent hurricane destroyed the area, it was abandoned in 1561.

The horse, which the natives had hunted to extinction 10,000 years ago, was reintroduced into North America by the European explorers, and into Florida in 1538. As the animals were lost or stolen, they began to become feral.

In 1564, René Goulaine de Laudonnière founded Fort Caroline in what is now Jacksonville, as a haven for Huguenot Protestant refugees from religious persecution in France. Further down the coast, in 1565 Pedro Menéndez de Avilés founded San Agustín (St. Augustine) which is the oldest continuously inhabited European settlement in any U.S. state. It is second oldest only to San Juan, Puerto Rico, in the United States&#x27; current territory. From this base of operations, the Spanish began building Catholic missions.

All colonial cities were founded near the mouths of rivers. St. Augustine was founded where the Matanzas Inlet permitted access to the Matanzas River. Other cities were founded on the sea with similar inlets: Jacksonville, West Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale, Miami, Pensacola, Tampa, Fort Myers, and others.

On September 20, 1565, Menéndez de Avilés attacked Fort Caroline, killing most of the French Huguenot defenders. Two years later, Dominique de Gourgue recaptured the settlement for France, this time slaughtering the Spanish defenders.

St. Augustine became the most important settlement in Florida. Little more than a fort, it was constantly in some form of danger and did face the dangers many other early European colonies had. It was notably devastated in 1586, when English sea captain and sometime pirate Sir Francis Drake plundered and burned the city. Later sometime in 1599 a fire would burn down the Franciscan monastery that was present and the southern part of St. Augustine and a few months later on September 22, 1599, a hurricane would hit destroying much of the town. Although St. Augustine faced many hardships the Spanish decided to maintain the town and the colony as a way to counteract English expansion in the Americas and to help protect Spanish ships.

Catholic missionaries used St. Augustine as a base of operations to establish over 100 far-flung missions throughout Florida. They converted 26,000 natives by 1655, but a revolt in 1656 and an epidemic in 1659 proved devastating. Construction on Castillo de San Marcos in St. Augustine would begin in 1672 and finish in 1695. Another fort, named Fort Matanzas would be built in 1742 to defend St. Augustine&#x27;s entrance from the Matanzas Inlet. The total population of St. Augustine during the Spanish period has some degree of uncertainty but several census were taken. A 1675 census found it had a population of 300 while a 1689 census found there was 1,444 people that lived there. Another done in 1736 found 1,409 residents. By 1763 the population of St. Augustine was larger than Williamsburg, Virginia or any other town in the southern British colonies with the exception of Charleston, South Carolina.

African slaves used primarily for labor were first introduced to Spanish Florida as early as 1580, when officials asked for permission to import slaves to bolster the workforce in and around St. Augustine. However, due to restrictions by the Spanish crown, the population of African slaves in Florida remained relatively low until around the period of British control in 1763.

Throughout the 17th century, English settlers in Virginia and Carolina gradually pushed the boundaries of Spanish territory south, while the French settlements along the Mississippi River encroached on the western borders of the Spanish claim. In 1702, Governor of Carolina James Moore and allied Yamasee and Creek Indians attacked and razed the town of St. Augustine, but they could not gain control of the fort. In 1704, Moore and his soldiers began burning Spanish missions in north Florida and executing Indians friendly with the Spanish. The collapse of the Spanish mission system and the defeat of the Spanish-allied Apalachee Indians (the Apalachee massacre) opened Florida up to slave raids, which reached to the Florida Keys and decimated the native population. The Yamasee War of 1715–1717 in the Carolinas resulted in numerous Indian refugees, such as the Yamasee, moving south to Florida. In 1719, the French captured the Spanish settlement at Pensacola.

====Fugitive slaves and conflicts====
The border between the British colony of Georgia and Spanish Florida was never clearly defined, and was the subject of constant harassment in both directions, until it was ceded by Spain to the U.S. in 1821. The Spanish Crown, beginning with King Charles II in 1693, encouraged fugitive slaves from the British North American colonies to escape and offered them freedom and refuge if they converted to Catholicism. This was well known through word of mouth in the colonies of Georgia and South Carolina, and hundreds of enslaved Africans escaped to their freedom, which infuriated colonists in the British North American colonies. They settled in a buffer community north of St. Augustine, called Gracia Real de Santa Teresa de Mose, the first settlement made of free black people in North America.

During this period, the British (including their North American colonies) repeatedly attacked Spanish Florida, especially in 1702 and again in 1740, when a large force under James Oglethorpe sailed south from Georgia and besieged St. Augustine, but was unable to capture the Castillo de San Marcos. The 1755 Lisbon earthquake triggered a tsunami that would have struck Central Florida with an estimated wave.

Creek and Seminole Native Americans, who had established buffer settlements in Florida at the invitation of the Spanish government, also welcomed any fugitive slaves who reached their settlements. In 1771, Governor John Moultrie wrote to the Board of Trade that &quot;it has been a practice for a good while past, for negroes to run away from their Masters, and get into the Indian towns, from whence it proved very difficult to get them back&quot;. When British colonial officials in Florida pressed the Seminole to return runaway slaves, they replied that they had &quot;merely given hungry people food, and invited the slaveholders to catch the runaways themselves&quot;.

===British rule (1763–1783)===

In 1763, Spain traded Florida to the Kingdom of Great Britain for control of Havana, Cuba, which had been captured by the British during the Seven Years&#x27; War. It was part of a large expansion of British territory following the country&#x27;s victory in the Seven Years&#x27; War. Almost the entire Spanish population left, taking along most of the remaining indigenous population to Cuba. The British divided the territory into East Florida and West Florida.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://fcit.usf.edu/Florida/docs/f/florbrit.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The British soon constructed the King&#x27;s Road connecting St. Augustine to Georgia. The road crossed the St. Johns River at a narrow point, which the Seminole called &quot;Wacca Pilatka&quot; and the British named &quot;Cow Ford&quot;, both names ostensibly reflecting the fact that cattle were brought across the river there. The British government gave land grants to officers and soldiers who had fought in the French and Indian War in order to encourage settlement. In order to induce settlers to move to the two new colonies reports of the natural wealth of Florida were published in England. A large number of British colonists who were &quot;energetic and of good character&quot; moved to Florida, mostly coming from South Carolina, Georgia and England, though there was also a group of settlers who came from the colony of Bermuda. This would be the first permanent English-speaking population in what is now Duval County, Baker County, St. Johns County, and Nassau County. The British built good public roads and introduced the cultivation of sugar cane, indigo, and fruits, as well the export of lumber. As a result of these initiatives northeastern Florida prospered economically in a way it never did under Spanish rule. Furthermore, the British governors were directed to call general assemblies as soon as possible to make laws for the Floridas and in the meantime they were, with the advice of councils, to establish courts. This would be the first introduction of much of the English-derived legal system which Florida still has today, including trial by jury, habeas corpus, and county-based government.

A Scottish settler named Dr. Andrew Turnbull transplanted around 1,500 indentured settlers, from Menorca, Majorca, Ibiza, Smyrna, Crete, Mani Peninsula, and Sicily, to grow hemp, sugarcane, indigo, and to produce rum. Settled at New Smyrna, within months the colony suffered major losses primarily due to insect-borne diseases and Native American raids. Most crops did not do well in the sandy Florida soil. Those that survived rarely equaled the quality produced in other colonies. The colonists tired of their servitude and Turnbull&#x27;s rule. On several occasions, he used African slaves to whip his unruly settlers. The settlement collapsed and the survivors fled to safety with the British authorities in St. Augustine. Their descendants survive to this day, as does the name New Smyrna.

In 1767, the British moved the northern boundary of West Florida to a line extending from the mouth of the Yazoo River east to the Chattahoochee River (32° 28′ north latitude), consisting of approximately the lower third of the present states of Mississippi and Alabama. During this time, Creek Indians migrated into Florida and formed the Seminole tribe.

====Florida in the American Revolutionary War====

When representatives from thirteen North American colonies declared independence from Great Britain in 1776, many Floridians condemned the action. East and West Florida were backwater outposts whose populations included a large percentage of British military personnel and their families. There was little trade in or out of the colonies, so they were largely unaffected by the Stamp Act Crisis of 1765 and other taxes and policies which brought other British colonies together in common interest against a shared threat. Thus, a majority of Florida residents were Loyalists, and both East and West Florida declined to send representatives to any sessions of the Continental Congress.

Governor Patrick Tonyn raised four black militia units to protect East Florida. Enslaved blacks who fought for the British Crown were promised freedom. However, due to the passing of stricter slave codes and the efforts of slave owners, few of those who fought were granted their freedom.

During the American Revolutionary War, Florida Loyalists fighting for the English Crown participated in raids against the Patriot forces in South Carolina and Georgia. Continental forces attempted to invade East Florida early in the conflict, but they were defeated on May 17, 1777, at the Battle of Thomas Creek in today&#x27;s Nassau County when American Colonel John Baker surrendered to the British. Another American incursion into the same area was repelled at the Battle of Alligator Bridge on June 30, 1778.

The two Floridas remained loyal to Great Britain throughout the war. However, Spain, participating indirectly in the war as an ally of France, captured Pensacola from the British in 1781. The Peace of Paris (1783) ended the Revolutionary War and returned all of Florida to Spanish control, but without specifying the boundaries. The Spanish wanted the expanded northern boundary Britain had made to West Florida, while the new United States demanded the old boundary at the 31st parallel north. This border controversy was resolved in the 1795 Treaty of San Lorenzo when Spain recognized the 31st parallel as the boundary.

====Departure of the British====
Just as most residents of Spanish Florida had left when Britain gained possession of the territory in 1763, the impending return to Spanish control in 1783 saw a vast exodus of those who had settled in the area over the previous twenty years. This included many Loyalists who had fled there during the American War of Independence and had caused East Florida&#x27;s population to swell considerably if temporarily.

===Second Spanish rule (1783–1821)===

Spain&#x27;s reoccupation of Florida involved the arrival of some officials and soldiers at St. Augustine and Pensacola but very few new settlers. Most British residents had departed, leaving much of the territory depopulated and unguarded. North Florida continued to be the home of the newly amalgamated black–native American Seminole culture and a haven for people escaping slavery in the southern United States. Settlers in southern Georgia demanded that Spain control the Seminole population and capture runaway slaves, to which Spain replied that the slave owners were welcome to recapture the runaways themselves.

Americans began moving into northern Florida from the backwoods of Georgia and South Carolina. Though technically not allowed by the Spanish authorities, the Spanish were never able to effectively police the border region, and a mix of American settlers, escaped slaves, and Native Americans would continue to migrate into Florida unchecked. The American migrants, mixing with the few remaining settlers from Florida&#x27;s British period, would be the progenitors of the population known as Florida Crackers.

====Republic of West Florida====
Ignoring Spanish territorial claims, American settlers, along with some remaining British settlers, established a permanent foothold in the western end of West Florida during the first decade of the 1800s. In the summer of 1810, they began planning a rebellion against Spanish rule which became open revolt in September. The rebels overcame the Spanish garrison at Baton Rouge and proclaimed the &quot;Free and Independent Republic of West Florida&quot; on September 23. (None of it was within what is today the state of Florida.) Their flag was the original &quot;Bonnie Blue Flag&quot;, a single white star on a blue field. On October 27, 1810, most of the Republic of West Florida was annexed by proclamation of President James Madison, who claimed that the region was included in the Louisiana Purchase and incorporated it into the newly formed Territory of Orleans. Some leaders of the newly declared republic objected to the takeover, but all had deferred to arriving American troops by mid-December 1810. The Florida Parishes of the modern state of Louisiana include most of the territory claimed by the short-lived Republic of West Florida.

Spain sided with Great Britain during the War of 1812, and the U.S. annexed the Mobile District of West Florida to the Mississippi Territory in May 1812. The surrender of Spanish forces at Mobile in April 1813 officially established American control over the area, which was eventually divided between the states of Alabama and Mississippi.

====Republic of East Florida====

In March 1812, a small independent band of Americans took control of Amelia Island on the Atlantic coast. They declared that they were now an independent republic free from Spanish rule in what would become known as the Patriot War. The revolt was organized by General George Mathews of the U.S. Army, who had been authorized to secretly negotiate with the Spanish governor for American acquisition of East Florida. Instead, Mathews organized a group of frontiersmen in Georgia, who arrived at the Spanish town of Fernandina and demanded the surrender of all of Amelia Island. Upon declaring the island a republic, he led his volunteers along with a contingent of regular army troops south towards St. Augustine. Upon hearing of Mathews&#x27; actions, the government became alarmed that he would provoke war with Spain. Secretary of State James Monroe ordered Matthews to return all captured territory to Spanish authorities. After several months of negotiations on the withdrawal of the Americans and compensation for their foraging through the countryside, the countries came to an agreement, and Amelia Island was returned to the Spanish in May 1813.

A similar filibuster action took place in September 1817, when the Scottish veteran and con-man Gregor MacGregor led a private force and captured Amelia Island and declared it part of the Republic of the Floridas. By December 1817, the United States seized the island.

====First Seminole War====

The unguarded Florida border was an increasing source of tension late in the second Spanish period. Seminoles based in East Florida had been accused of raiding Georgia settlements, and settlers were angered by the stream of slaves escaping into Florida, where they were welcomed. Negro Fort, an abandoned British fortification in the far west of the territory, was manned by both indigenous and black people. The United States Army would lead increasingly frequent incursions into Spanish territory, including the 1817–1818 campaign against the Seminole Indians by Andrew Jackson that became known later as the First Seminole War. Jackson took temporary control of Pensacola in 1818, and though he withdrew due to Spanish objections, the United States continued to effectively control much of West Florida. According to Secretary of State John Quincy Adams, this was necessary because Florida had become &quot;a derelict open to the occupancy of every enemy, civilized or savage, of the United States, and serving no other earthly purpose than as a post of annoyance to them&quot;.

====End of Spanish control====

After Jackson&#x27;s incursions, Spain decided that Florida had become too much of a burden, as it could not afford to send settlers or garrisons to properly occupy the land and was receiving very little revenue from the territory. Madrid therefore decided to cede Florida to the United States. The transfer was negotiated as part of the Adams–Onís Treaty, which also settled several boundary disputes between Spanish colonies and the U.S. in exchange for American payment of $5,000,000 in claims against the Spanish government. The treaty was signed in 1819 and took effect in 1821, and the United States formally took possession of Florida on July 17, 1821.

==Territory and statehood==
===Florida Territory (1822–1845)===


Florida Territory became an organized territory of the United States on March 30, 1822. The U.S. merged East Florida and West Florida (although the majority of West Florida was annexed to Territory of Orleans and Mississippi Territory), and established a new capital in Tallahassee, conveniently located halfway between the East Florida capital of St. Augustine and the West Florida capital of Pensacola. The boundaries of Florida&#x27;s first two counties, Escambia and St. Johns, approximately coincided with the boundaries of West and East Florida respectively.

The free black and Indigenous slaves, Black Seminoles, living near St. Augustine, fled to Havana, Cuba to avoid coming under US control. Some Seminole also abandoned their settlements and moved further south. Hundreds of Black Seminoles and fugitive slaves escaped in the early nineteenth century from Cape Florida to The Bahamas, where they settled on Andros Island.
As settlement increased, pressure grew on the United States government to remove the Indians from their lands in Florida. Many settlers in Florida developed plantation agriculture, similar to other areas of the Deep South. To the consternation of new landowners, the Seminoles harbored and integrated runaway black slaves, and clashes between whites and Indians grew with the influx of new settlers.

In 1832, the United States government signed the Treaty of Payne&#x27;s Landing with some of the Seminole chiefs, promising them lands west of the Mississippi River if they agreed to leave Florida voluntarily. Many Seminoles left then, while those who remained prepared to defend their claims to the land. White settlers pressured the government to remove all of the Indians, by force if necessary, and in 1835, the U.S. Army arrived to enforce the treaty.

The Second Seminole War began at the end of 1835 with the Dade Battle, when Seminoles ambushed Army troops marching from Fort Brooke (Tampa) to reinforce Fort King (Ocala). They killed or mortally wounded all but one of the 110 troops. Between 900 and 1,500 Seminole warriors effectively employed guerrilla tactics against United States Army troops for seven years. Osceola, a charismatic young war leader, came to symbolize the war and the Seminoles after he was arrested by Brigadier General Joseph Marion Hernandez while negotiating under a white truce flag in October 1837, by order of General Thomas Jesup. First imprisoned at Fort Marion, he died of malaria at Fort Moultrie in South Carolina less than three months after his capture. The war ended in 1842. The U.S. government is estimated to have spent between $20 million ($ in dollars) and $40 million ($ in dollars) on the war; at the time, this was considered a large sum. Almost all of the Seminoles were forcibly exiled to Creek lands west of the Mississippi; several hundred remained in the Everglades.

During the territorial period, the region of Middle Florida between the Apalachee and Suwanee Rivers grew in population.

When Florida was a territory, there was much debate regarding its statehood. It was proposed several times that the territory be split with varying motivations ranging from: the regions of East and West Florida feeling a sense of disconnection from each other, adding another slave state and that Pensacola would be a good port for Alabama. A statehood referendum was held in 1837 with a majority (63%) voting in favor of statehood. In 1845 a bill was introduced in the US House to admit East and West Florida as separate states but this was later voted down and modified to all of Florida instead which ended up passing.

===Statehood (1845)===

On March 3, 1845, Florida became the 27th state of the United States of America. Its first governor was William Dunn Moseley.

Almost half the state&#x27;s population were enslaved African Americans working on large cotton and sugar plantations, between the Apalachicola and Suwannee rivers in the north central part of the state. Like the people who owned them, many slaves had come from the coastal areas of Georgia and the Carolinas. They were part of the Gullah–Geechee culture of the Lowcountry. Others were enslaved African Americans from the upper South who had been sold to traders taking slaves to the deep South.

In the 1850s, with the potential transfer of ownership of federal land to the state, including Seminole land, the federal government decided to convince the remaining Seminoles to emigrate. The Army reactivated Fort Harvie and renamed it to Fort Myers. Increased Army patrols led to hostilities, and eventually a Seminole attack on Fort Myers which killed two United States soldiers. The Third Seminole War lasted from 1855 to 1858 which ended with most of the remaining Seminoles, mostly women and children moving to Indian Territory. In 1859, another 75 Seminoles surrendered and were sent to the West, but a small number continued to live in the Everglades.

On the eve of the Civil War, Florida had the smallest population of the Southern states. It was invested in plantation agriculture, which was dependent on the labor of enslaved African Americans. By 1860, Florida had 140,424 people, of whom 44% were enslaved and fewer than 1,000 were free people of color. Florida also had one of the highest per capita murder rates prior to the Civil War, thanks to a weakened central government, the institution of slavery, and a troubled political history.

==Civil War through late 19th century==
===American Civil War===
Following Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s election in 1860, Florida joined other Southern states in seceding from the Union. Secession took place January 10, 1861, and after less than a month as an independent republic, Florida became one of the founding seven states of the Confederate States of America. During the Civil War, Florida was an important supply route for the Confederate Army. Therefore, Union forces operated a naval blockade around the entire state, and Union troops occupied major ports such as Cedar Key, Jacksonville, Key West, and Pensacola. Though numerous skirmishes occurred in Florida, including the Battle of Natural Bridge, the Battle of Marianna and the Battle of Gainesville, the only major battle was the Battle of Olustee near Lake City.

In 1861, at the start of the war, the state had a population of roughly 140,000, with half of that being enslaved African Americans. In spite of the state&#x27;s relatively small population, Florida did send several units to fight up north, most notably the 1st Florida, the 8th Florida and the 3rd Florida Infantry Regiment.

Most of the population were not enthusiastic about the secession, and the Unionist movement that was a minority in Florida between 1861 and 1862 increased notably during the last three years of the war, especially in Jacksonville, Tampa, Sarasota and most of South and Northwest Florida, where Unionist regiments were formed. At the time of the end of the war, most Floridians deserted the Confederate Army and the government in Florida was under anarchy until the Union troops returned to Florida.

===Reconstruction era===

During the Reconstruction era that followed the Civil War, moderate Republicans took charge of the state, first led by Governor Harrison Reed. In order to combat the increasingly growing Ku Klux Klan, Reed mobilized black and white militias and purchased two thousand rifles in New York with which to arm them. However, the train carrying the arms was attacked by members of the Klan and the weapons were lost.

The moderate regime plunged into complicated maneuvering and infighting. It drafted a conservative constitution. The extended contest between liberals and radicals inside the Republican Party alienated so many voters that the Democrats took power. They rigged elections, disenfranchised black voters, and made the state a reliable part of the &quot;Solid South&quot;.

A state convention was held in 1868 to rewrite the constitution. After meeting the requirements of Congress, including ratification of the 13th and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, Florida was readmitted to the Union on July 4, 1868. This did not end the struggle for political power among groups in the state. Southern whites objected to freedmen&#x27;s political participation and complained of illiterate representatives to the state legislature. But of the six members who could not read or write during the seven years of Republican rule, four were white.

Also in the late 1860s, another proposal came for Alabama to annex part of the Florida panhandle. This proposal entailed Alabama annexing Florida west of the Choctawhatchee River with a resolution passing the Alabama General Assembly authorizing the Alabama Governor William Hugh Smith to negotiate with Florida&#x27;s governor about the annexation. Florida passed a resolution to hold a special election which was voted in favor of with 1,162 voting for it and 681 against it but this annexation proposal never went through and no transaction ever took place.

After Federal troops left the South in 1877, conservative white Democrats engaged in voter suppression and intimidation, regaining control of the state legislature. This was accomplished partly through violent actions by white paramilitary groups targeting freedmen and their allies to discourage them from voting.

Thanks to government enticements, entrepreneurs like Henry Flagler, Henry B. Plant, and Hamilton Disston, invested heavily in Florida, especially its infrastructure. The development of railroads and other transportation in the state led the population to almost double in the 1880s and 1890s.

===Disenfranchisement===

From 1885 to 1889, after regaining power, the white-dominated state legislature passed statutes to impose poll taxes and other barriers to voter registration and voting, to eliminate voting by black people and poor whites. These two groups had threatened white Democratic power with a populist coalition. As these groups were stripped from voter rolls, white Democrats established power in a one-party state, as happened across the South.

In this period, white violence rose against black people, particularly in the form of lynchings, which reached a peak around the turn of the century.

The Great Freeze of 1894–95 ruined citrus crops, which had a detrimental ripple effect on the economy of Central Florida in particular. By 1900 the state&#x27;s African Americans numbered more than 200,000, roughly 44 percent of the total population. This was the same proportion as before the Civil War, and they were effectively disenfranchised. Not being able to vote meant they could not sit on juries, and were not elected to local, state or federal offices. They also were not recruited for law enforcement or other government positions. After the end of Reconstruction, the Florida legislature passed Jim Crow laws establishing racial segregation in public facilities and transportation. Separate railroad cars or sections of cars for different races were required beginning in 1887. Separate waiting rooms at railroad stations were required beginning in 1909.

Without political representation, African Americans found that their facilities were underfunded and they were pushed into a second-class position. For more than six decades, white Democrats controlled virtually all the state&#x27;s seats in Congress, which were apportioned based on the total population of the state rather than only the whites who voted.

===Spanish–American War===
After the start of the first liberation war in Cuba, known as the Ten Years&#x27; War (1868-1878), around 100,000 Cubans fled their homes to avoid the violence and upheaval. Generally speaking, the rich and middle class Cubans settled in Europe or northern cities like New York, Philadelphia, and Boston. Meanwhile, the more poor workers ended up settling in south Florida, first in Key West and then eventually in Tampa. However, there were also a number of Spanish living in Florida. Because of the heterogeneous nature of Florida&#x27;s population, there were both pro and anti-war sentiments leading up to the start of the Spanish–American War in 1898.

Because of their proximity to Cuba, Floridians worried that their cities could come under direct attack with the outbreak of war. Tampa would serve as an embarkation port for troops heading to Cuba. Major General Nelson A. Miles ordered a base built in Miami despite earlier rejections by a board of officers. Soldiers began arriving on June 24, 1898. They were volunteers, mostly from the southern states.

==Since 1900==
In 1900, Florida was largely agricultural and frontier; most Floridians lived within 50 miles of the Georgia border. The population grew from 529,000 in 1900 to 18.3 million in 2009. The population explosion began with the great land boom of the 1920s as Florida became a destination for vacationers and a southern land speculator&#x27;s paradise. People from throughout the Southeast migrated to Florida during this time, creating a larger southern culture in the central part of the state, and expanding the existing one in the northern region.

By 1920, Florida had the highest rate of lynchings per capita, although the overall total had declined. Violence of whites against black people continued into the post-World War II period, and there were lynchings and riots in several small towns in the early 1920s. Florida had the only recorded lynching in 1945, in October after the war&#x27;s end, when a black man was killed after being falsely accused of assaulting a white girl.

In the 1920s, many developers invested in land in the southern part of the State in areas such as Miami, and Palm Beach attracting more people in the Southern States. When the Crash came in 1929, prices of houses plunged, but the sunshine remained. Hurt badly by the Great Depression and the land bust, Florida, along with many other States, kept afloat with federal relief money under the Franklin D. Roosevelt Administration.

After World War II, the state would grow dramatically going from having a population of 2.7 million in 1950 to 16 million by 2000 along with going from being the 20th most populated state in 1950 to being the 4th most by 2000 and 3rd by 2014. Florida&#x27;s strong population growth followed other states in the southern and western United States along with following the same trend as many residents moving to the state were from the Midwest and Northeastern US. Many new residents in Florida were elderly and as a result the average age in Florida would increase from 28.8 in 1950 to 39.3 by 2000. Technological reasons behind Florida&#x27;s growth included air conditioning and DDT.

===Race relations===

After World War I, there was a rise in lynchings and other racial violence directed by whites against black people in the state, as well as across the South. It was due in part from strains of rapid social and economic changes, as well as competition for jobs, and lingering resentment resulting from the Reconstruction after the Civil War, as well as tensions among both black and white populations created by the return of black veterans.

Whites continued to resort to lynchings to keep dominance, and tensions rose. Florida led the South and the nation in lynchings per capita from 1900 to 1930.

White mobs committed massacres, accompanied by wholesale destruction of black houses, churches, and schools, in the small communities of Ocoee, November 1920; Perry in December 1922; and Rosewood in January 1923. The governor appointed a special grand jury and special prosecuting attorney to investigate Rosewood and Levy County, but the jury did not find sufficient evidence to prosecute. Rosewood was never resettled.

The Ku Klux Klan had several active Klaverns in Florida in the 1920s, starting in Jacksonville in late 1922. Like elsewhere in the south, Klan members terrorized African Americans, Catholics, immigrants and anyone else proclaiming racial equality. They also intimidated voters at polling locations and were direct participants in politics. For example, in the June primaries of 1922, the Klan had winning candidates for several offices throughout Volusia County. The three largest Klaverns in the state were in Jacksonville, Miami, and St. Petersburg.

About 40,000 African Americans migrated from Florida to northern cities in the Great Migration from 1910 to 1940. That was one-fifth of their population in 1900. They sought better lives, including decent-paying jobs, better education for their children, and the chance to vote and participate in political life — escaping segregation, lynchings, and civil rights suppression. Many were recruited for jobs with the Pennsylvania Railroad.

===Boom of 1920s===

The 1920s were a prosperous time for much of the nation, including Florida. The state&#x27;s new railroads opened up large areas to development, spurring the Florida land boom of the 1920s. Investors of all kinds, many from outside Florida, raced to buy and sell rapidly appreciating land in newly platted communities such as Miami and Palm Beach. Led by entrepreneurs Carl Fisher and George Merrick, Miami was transformed by land speculation and ambitious building projects into an emerging metropolis. A growing awareness in the areas surrounding Florida, along with the Northeast about the attractive south Florida winter climate, along with local promotion of speculative investing, spurred the boom.

A majority of the people who bought land in Florida hired intermediaries to accomplish the transactions. By 1924, the main issues in state elections were how to attract more industry and the need to build and maintain good roads for tourists. During the time frame, the population grew from less than one million in 1920, to 1,263,540 in 1925.

By 1925, the market ran out of buyers to pay the high prices, and soon the boom became a bust. The 1926 Miami Hurricane, which nearly destroyed the city further depressed the real estate market. In 1928 another hurricane struck Southern Florida. The 1928 Okeechobee hurricane made landfall near Palm Beach, severely damaging the local infrastructure. In townships near Lake Okeechobee, the storm breached a dike separating the water from land, creating a storm surge that killed over 2,000 people and destroying the towns of Belle Glade and Pahokee.

Tourists continued to arrive in Florida by train. The introduction of the automobile resulted in an increased number traveling on sometimes macadamized, sometimes dirt roads. The destination was usually Miami or Miami Beach. Roadside attractions included orange shops and alligator wrestling. Tourism was confined to the winter months. Summers were uncomfortably hot for visitors.

===Prohibition===
Prohibition had been popular in north Florida, but was opposed in the rest of the south, which became a haven for speakeasies and rum-runners in the 1920s. During 1928–32 a broad coalition of judges, lawyers, politicians, journalists, brewers, hoteliers, retailers, and ordinary Floridians organized to try to repeal the ban on alcohol. When the federal government legalized near beer and light wine in 1933, the wet coalition launched a successful campaign to legalize these beverages at the state level.

Floridians subsequently joined in the national campaign to repeal the 18th Amendment, which succeeded in December 1933. The following November, state voters repealed Florida&#x27;s constitutional ban on liquor and gave local governments the power to legalize or outlaw alcoholic beverages.

===Great Depression===
The Great Depression began with the Stock Market crash of 1929. By that time, the economy had already declined in much of Florida from the collapse three years earlier of the land boom. During the late 1920s and early 1930s Florida would face a variety of problems with some of them stemming from the collapse of the Florida Land Boom and the Great Depression. Two hurricanes with one occurring in 1926 and another in 1928 would hurt the state further economically. The state government would be in debt which was then a violation of Florida&#x27;s Constitution and over 150 municipalities would also be in debt as they had defaulted on their municipal bonds which had mainly been issued as a way to pay for infrastructure during the Florida land boom. Many property owners often owed taxes to local governments which further worsened the situation. A separate issue would be with Florida&#x27;s virgin timber crop being virtually cut down by the 1930s.

During the New Deal (1933–40) a variety of projects would be built by the Works Progress Administration (WPA). There would be work camps for the young men of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). Apart from the New Deal being implemented, Florida would see David Sholtz become elected as Governor in 1932. As governor, he would manage to implement social welfare programs while simultaneously expanding the amount of tax revenue received by the state government and getting it out of debt. He would also be strongly aligned with President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and was a personal friend of his. Toward the end of Sholtz&#x27;s tenure his reputation among Floridians which was previously positive would decline as his ethics became questioned. As a result, Fred P. Cone would become elected as governor in 1936. While being governor he would be incredibly hands-off and had a fiscally conservative approach.

From 1930 to 1935, college students selected Fort Lauderdale, Daytona Beach, and Panama City Beach as great places to take a spring break and party. The 1960s film &quot;Where the Boys Are&quot; increased attendance in Fort Lauderdale to 50,000 annually. When this figure increased to 250,000 in 1985, the city began to pass laws restricting student activities. As a result, students moved to Daytona Beach from 1980 to 1990s. The figure for Fort Lauderdale dropped to 20,000; 350,000 visited Daytona Beach. Daytona Beach passed laws constraining underage drinking. Students then began patronizing Panama City, where 500,000 visited in 2013.

Florida legalized gambling in 1931 allowing a Parimutuel betting establishment. By 2014, there were 30 such establishments, generating $200 million in state taxes and fees.

Anticipating war, the Army and Navy decided to use the state as a primary training area. The Navy chose the coastal areas, the Army, the inland areas.

In 1940, the population was about 1.5 million. Average annual income was $308 ($ in dollars).

===World War II and the development of the space industry===

Prior to the United States entering World War II, Florida was found in polling by Gallup to be among the most supportive states for interventionism. In the years leading up to World War II, 100 ships were sunk off the coast of Florida. More ships sank after the country entered the war. About 248,000 Floridians served in the war. Around 50,000 of these were African Americans.

During the war, shipbuilding would make up two-thirds of all industrial growth seen in the state. Thousands of people would be hired by shipbuilding companies during the war to work in Pensacola, Panama City, Jacksonville and Tampa. There would be labor shortages during the war as many of those who worked at industrial jobs were now serving in the military. Local and migrant laborers who worked in the orchards and field would end up leaving for higher paying jobs.

The state became a major hub for the United States Armed Forces. Naval Air Station Pensacola was originally established as a naval station in 1826 and became the first American naval aviation facility in 1917. The entire nation mobilized for World War II and many bases, especially air bases, were established in Florida, to include:
* Naval Air Station Whiting Field
* Naval Air Station Ellyson Field
* Tyndall Field
* Dale Mabry Army Airfield
* Naval Air Station Jacksonville
* Naval Station Mayport
* Naval Air Station Cecil Field
* Camp Blanding
* Naval Air Station Daytona Beach
* Naval Air Station DeLand
* Naval Air Station Sanford
* Orlando Army Air Base
* Pinecastle Army Airfield
* Kissimmee Army Airfield 
* Naval Air Station Banana River
* Naval Air Station Melbourne
* Lakeland Army Airfield
* Naval Air Station Fort Lauderdale
* Naval Air Station Miami
* Naval Air Station Richmond
* Page Field Army Airfield
* Naval Air Station Key West
* Naval Station Key West
* Homestead Army Air Field

Numerous others were also established that exist today as military installations/facilities, civilian airports, or other facilities under different names.

Present day Eglin Air Force Base, Hurlburt Field, and MacDill Air Force Base (now the home of U.S. Central Command and U.S. Special Operations Command) were also developed as U.S. Army Air Forces installations during this time. During the Cold War, Florida&#x27;s coastal access and proximity to Cuba encouraged the development of these and other military facilities. Since the end of the Cold War, the military has closed some facilities, including major bases such as NAS Sanford, McCoy AFB, NAS Cecil Field, and NTC Orlando, and realigned others such as Homestead AFB being transferred to the Air Force Reserve Command and realigned as Homestead Air Reserve Base, or NAS Saufley Field realigned as NETPDC Saufley Field, but their presence is still significant in the state and local economies.

Apart from military bases, Florida would also be home to 22 prisoner of war camps. Starting in May 1943, the Allied powers would send captured Nazi soldiers to the United States with about of 10,000 of them going to 22 camps in Florida. Many of these camps would be located in or near military bases.

The population increased by 46% during the 1940s.

Because of Cape Canaveral&#x27;s relative closeness to the equator, compared to other potential locations, it was chosen in 1949 as a test site for the country&#x27;s nascent missile program. Patrick Space Force Base and the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station launch site began to take shape as the 1950s progressed. By the early 1960s, the Space Race was in full swing. As programs were expanded and employees joined, the space program generated a huge boom in the communities around Cape Canaveral. This area is now collectively known as the Space Coast and features the Kennedy Space Center. It is also a major center of the aerospace industry. To date, all crewed orbital spaceflights launched by the United States, including those that carried the only persons to visit the Moon, have been launched from Kennedy Space Center.

===Post-World War II growth, changes and the Civil Rights Movement===
Florida&#x27;s population mix has changed. After World War II, Florida was transformed as the development of air conditioning and the Interstate highway system encouraged migration by residents of the North and Midwest.

In 1950, Florida was ranked twentieth among the states in population; 50 years later it was ranked fourth, and 14 years later was number three. Due to low tax rates and warm climate, Florida became the destination for many retirees from the Northeast, Midwest and Canada.

Prior to development, Florida salt marshes were capable of producing large numbers of mosquitoes. The salt marsh mosquito does not lay its eggs in standing water, preferring moist sand or mud instead. Biologists learned to control them by &quot;source reduction&quot;, the process of removing the moist sand needed by the mosquitoes to breed. To achieve this goal, large sections of coastal marshes were either ditched or diked to remove the moist sand that the mosquitoes required to lay eggs on. Together with chemical controls, it yielded a qualified success.

Dramatic changes would also be seen economically in Florida. Agricultural grew during the postwar years and even outpaced the growth of tourism in the state until 1965 when Walt Disney announced the creation of Walt Disney World. Citrus growers doubled their output, cattle ranching expanded in the Kissimmee Valley and farmers began to cultivate the Everglades Agricultural Area with sugar being the most prominent crop. Sugarcane cultivation would begin to grow significantly in that area after the United States placed an embargo on Cuban sugar in 1959 (Cuba was the main supplier of sugar to the United States) and repealed the Sugar Act&#x27;s limits on domestic production. Tourism grew in Florida from 3 million visitors to over 15 million by 1965.

==== Changes in demographics ====
In the early postwar period, the state&#x27;s population had changed markedly by migration of new groups, as well as emigration of African Americans, 40,000 of whom moved north in earlier decades of the 20th century during the Great Migration. By 1960 the number of African Americans in Florida had increased to 880,186, but declined proportionally to 18% of the state&#x27;s population. This was a much smaller proportion than in 1900, when the census showed they comprised 44% of the state&#x27;s population, while numbering 230,730 persons. The median age would also end up increasing as the state became a popular destination for retirees; going from 28.8 in 1950 to 39.3 by 2000.

The Cuban Revolution of 1959 resulted in a large wave of Cuban immigration into South Florida, which transformed Miami into a major center of commerce, finance and transportation for all of Latin America. Emigration from Haiti, other Caribbean states, and Central and South America continues to the present day.

The population of Asian-Americans increased in Florida during the postwar years, growing from 1,142 counted by the US Census Bureau in 1950 to 154,302 by 1990. During the 1970s and 1980s Asian-Americans would end up becoming the largest foreign-born group of people in Florida.

==== Civil Rights movement ====
Like other states in the South, Florida had many African-American leaders who were active in the civil rights movement. In the 1940s and &#x27;50s, a new generation started working on issues, emboldened by veterans who had fought during World War II and wanted to gain more civil rights. Harry T. Moore built the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Florida, rapidly increasing its membership to 10,000. Because Florida&#x27;s voter laws were not as restrictive as those of Georgia and Alabama, he had some success in registering black voters. In the 1940s he increased voter registration among black people from 5 to 31% of those age-eligible.

But the state had white groups who resisted change, to the point of attacking and killing black people. In December 1951 whites bombed the house of activists Harry Moore and his wife Harriette, who both died of injuries from the blast. Although their murders were not solved then, a state investigation in 2006 reported they had been killed by an independent unit of the Ku Klux Klan. Numerous bombings were directed against African Americans in 1951–1952 in Florida.

===2000 presidential election controversy===
Florida became the battleground of the controversial 2000 US presidential election which took place on November 7, 2000. The count of the popular votes was extremely close, triggering automatic recounts. These recounts triggered accusations of fraud and manipulation, and brought to light voting irregularities in the state.

Subsequent recount efforts degenerated into arguments over mispunched ballots, &quot;hanging chads&quot;, and controversial decisions by Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris and the Florida Supreme Court. Ultimately, the United States Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot; to end all recounts, allowing Harris to certify the election results. The final official Florida count gave the victory to George W. Bush over Al Gore by 537 votes, a 0.009% margin of difference. The process was extremely divisive, and led to calls for electoral reform in Florida. Florida has the strictest laws penalizing and disenfranchising felons and other criminals, even if they have served their sentences. Together with other penalties, it excluded many minorities who may have voted for the Democratic candidate.

===Everglades, hurricanes, drilling and the environment===

Long-term scientific attention has focused on the fragility of the Everglades. In 2000 Congress authorized the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) at $8 billion. The goals are to restore the health of the Everglades ecosystem and maximize the value to people of its land, water, and soil. 

Hurricane Andrew in August 1992 struck Homestead, just south of Miami, as a Category 5 hurricane, leaving forty people dead, 100,000 homes damaged or destroyed, more than a million people left without electricity, and damages of $20–30 billion. Much of South Florida&#x27;s sensitive vegetation was severely damaged. The region had not seen a storm of such power in decades. Besides heavy property damage, the hurricane nearly destroyed the region&#x27;s insurance industry.

The western panhandle was damaged heavily in 1995, with hurricanes Allison, Erin, and Opal hitting the area within the span of a few months. The storms increased in strength during the season, culminating with Opal&#x27;s landfall as a Category 3 in October.

Florida also suffered heavily during the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season, when four major storms struck the state. Hurricane Charley made landfall in Charlotte County area and cut northward through the peninsula, Hurricane Frances struck the Atlantic coast and drenched most of central Florida with heavy rains, Hurricane Ivan caused heavy damage in the western Panhandle, and Hurricane Jeanne caused damage to the same area as Frances, including compounded beach erosion. Damage from all four storms was estimated to be at least $22 billion, with some estimates going as high as $40 billion. In 2005, South Florida was struck by Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma. The panhandle was struck by Hurricane Dennis.

In 2016, Hurricane Matthew paralleled the east coast and caused an estimated $10 billion in damage. In 2017, Hurricane Irma made a catastrophic category 4 landfall in the Florida Keys, followed by a category 3 landfall in Collier County. Irma caused over $50 billion in damage in Florida, making it the costliest in Floridian history, until being surpassed by Hurricane Ian in 2022. In 2018, Hurricane Michael hit the Florida Panhandle as a Category 5, the first landfall at that intensity in the United States since Hurricane Andrew in 1992. It caused over $20 billion in damage in Florida. In 2022, Hurricane Ian made landfall in Lee County, killing 146 people and causing over $113 billion in damage, making it the costliest hurricane to ever hit Florida and the deadliest since the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane.

Florida has historically been at risk from hurricanes and tropical storms. These have resulted in higher risks and property damage as the concentration of population and development has increased along Florida&#x27;s coastal areas. Not only are more people and property at risk, but development has overtaken the natural system of wetlands and waterways, which used to absorb some of the storms&#x27; energy and excess waters.

Environmental issues include preservation and restoration of the Everglades, which has moved slowly. There has been pressure by industry groups to drill for oil in the eastern Gulf of Mexico but so far, large-scale drilling off the coasts of Florida has been prevented. The federal government declared the state an agricultural disaster area because of 13 straight days of freezing weather during the growing season in January 2010.

Oranges have been grown and sold in Florida since 1872. Production dropped 59% from the 2008–09 season to the 2016–17 season. The decline was mostly due to canker, citrus greening disease, and hurricane damage.

===Fishing===
In 2009–2010, &quot;there were hardly any fish off Florida...they are finding fish all over Florida&quot; in 2016. The federal government believes this is due to federal restraints on fishing.

===Infrastructure===
Consistent with usage throughout the country, more than 51% of homes in Florida in 2015 use mobile phones or wireless only.

==Tourism==
During the late 19th century, Florida became a popular tourist destination as Henry Flagler&#x27;s railroads expanded into the area. In 1891, railroad magnate Henry Plant built the luxurious Tampa Bay Hotel in Tampa; the hotel was later adapted for use as the campus for the University of Tampa.

Flagler built the Florida East Coast Railway from Jacksonville to Key West. Along the route he provided grand accommodations for passengers, including the Ponce de Leon Hotel in St. Augustine, the Ormond Hotel in Ormond Beach, the Royal Poinciana Hotel and the Breakers Hotel in Palm Beach, and the Royal Palm Hotel in Miami.

In February 1888, Florida had a special tourist: President Grover Cleveland, the first lady, and his party visited Florida for a couple of days. He visited the Subtropical Exposition in Jacksonville, where he made a speech supporting tourism to the state; he took a train to St. Augustine, meeting Henry Flagler; and a train to Titusville, where he boarded a steamboat and visited Rockledge. On his return trip, he visited Sanford and Winter Park.

Flagler&#x27;s railroad connected cities on the east coast of Florida. This created more urbanization along that corridor. Development also followed the construction of Turnpikes I-95 in east Florida, and I-75 in west Florida. These routes aided tourism and urbanization. Northerners from the East Coast used I-95 and tended to settle along that route. People from the MidWest tended to use I-75, and settled along the west coast of Florida.

===Theme parks===

Florida&#x27;s first theme parks were developed in the 1930s and included Cypress Gardens (1936) near Winter Haven, and Marineland (1938) near St. Augustine.

====Disney World====
Disney selected Orlando over several other sites for an updated and expanded version of their Disneyland Park in California. In 1971, the Magic Kingdom, the first component of the resort, opened and became Florida&#x27;s best-known attraction, attracting tens of millions of visitors a year. It stimulated the development of other attractions, as well as large tracts of housing and related businesses.

The Orlando area became an international resort and convention destination, featuring a wide variety of themed parks. Other area theme parks include Universal Orlando Resort and SeaWorld.

===Boating===

In 2017, 50,000 vessels were damaged by Hurricane Irma. This resulted in about $500 million worth of damage, predominately in the Florida Keys.

<text>Newton Leroy Gingrich (; né McPherson; born June 17, 1943) is an American politician and author who served as the 50th speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1995 to 1999. A member of the Republican Party, he was the U.S. representative for Georgia&#x27;s 6th congressional district serving north Atlanta and nearby areas from 1979 until his resignation in 1999. In 2012, Gingrich unsuccessfully ran for the Republican nomination for president of the United States.

In the 1970s, Gingrich was a professor of history and geography at the University of West Georgia. He won election to the U.S. House of Representatives in November 1978, the first Republican in the history of Georgia&#x27;s 6th congressional district to do so. He served as House minority whip from 1989 to 1995. A co-author and architect of the &quot;Contract with America&quot;, Gingrich was a major leader in the Republican victory in the 1994 congressional election. In 1995, &quot;Time&quot; named him &quot;Man of the Year&quot; for &quot;his role in ending the four-decades-long Democratic majority in the House&quot;.

As House Speaker, Gingrich oversaw passage by the House of welfare reform in 1996 and a capital gains tax cut in 1997. Gingrich played a key role in several government shutdowns, and impeached President Bill Clinton on a party-line vote in the House. A disappointing showing by Republicans in the 1998 congressional elections, a reprimand from the House for Gingrich&#x27;s ethics violation, and pressure from Republican colleagues resulted in Gingrich&#x27;s announcing that he would not run for the speakership in the upcoming congress, resigning from the House on January 3, 1999, the same day his term as speaker ended. Academics have credited Gingrich with playing a key role in hastening partisanship and political polarization in the United States.

Since leaving the House, Gingrich has remained active in public policy debates and worked as a political consultant. He founded and chaired several policy think tanks, including American Solutions for Winning the Future and the Center for Health Transformation. Gingrich ran for the Republican nomination for president in the 2012 election, and was considered a potential frontrunner at several points in the race. Despite a late victory in the South Carolina primary, Gingrich was ultimately unable to win enough primaries to sustain a viable candidacy. He withdrew from the race in May 2012, and endorsed eventual nominee Mitt Romney. Gingrich later emerged as a key ally of President Donald Trump, and was reportedly among the finalists on Trump&#x27;s short list for running mate in the 2016 election. Since 2020, Gingrich has supported Trump&#x27;s false claims of a stolen election and of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election.

== Early life ==
Gingrich was born as Newton Leroy McPherson at the Harrisburg Hospital in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on June 17, 1943. His mother, Kathleen &quot;Kit&quot; (née Daugherty; 1925–2003), and biological father, Newton Searles McPherson (1923–1970), married in September 1942, when she was 16 and McPherson was 19. The marriage fell apart within days. He is of English, German, Scottish and Scots-Irish descent.

In 1946, his mother married Robert Gingrich (1925–1996), who adopted him. Robert Gingrich was a career Army officer who served tours in Korea and Vietnam. In 1956, the family moved to Europe, living for a period in Orléans, France and Stuttgart, Germany.

From his mother, Gingrich has three younger half-siblings, Candace Gingrich, Susan Gingrich, and Roberta Brown. Gingrich was raised in Hummelstown (near Harrisburg) and on military bases where his adoptive father was stationed. The family&#x27;s religion was Lutheran. He also has a half-sister and half-brother, Randy McPherson, from his biological father&#x27;s side. In 1960 during his junior year in high school, the family moved to Georgia at Fort Moore.

In 1961, Gingrich graduated from Baker High School in Columbus, Georgia, where he met, and later married, his math teacher. He had been interested in politics since his teen years. While living with his family in Orléans, France, he visited the site of the Battle of Verdun and learned about the sacrifices made there and the importance of political leadership.

Gingrich received a Bachelor of Arts degree in history from Emory University in Atlanta in 1965. He went on to graduate study at Tulane University, earning an M.A. (1968) and a PhD in European history (1971). He spent six months in Brussels in 1969–1970 working on his dissertation, &quot;Belgian Education Policy in the Congo 1945–1960.&quot;

Gingrich received deferments from the military during the years of the Vietnam War for being a student and a father. In 1985, he stated, &quot;Given everything I believe in, a large part of me thinks I should have gone over.&quot;

In 1970, Gingrich joined the history department at West Georgia College, where he spent &quot;little time teaching history.&quot; He coordinated a new environmental studies program and was moved from the history to the geography department by 1976. During his time in the college, he took unpaid leave three times to run for the U.S. House of Representatives, losing twice before leaving the college. Serving professors were not allowed under the rules of the university system to run for office. He left the college in 1977 after being denied tenure.

== Early political career ==
Gingrich was the southern regional director for Nelson Rockefeller in the 1968 Republican primaries.

=== Congressional campaigns ===

In 1974, Gingrich made his first bid for political office as the Republican candidate in in north-central Georgia. He lost to 20-year incumbent Democrat Jack Flynt by 2,770 votes. Gingrich&#x27;s relative success surprised political analysts. Flynt had never faced a serious challenger; Gingrich was the second Republican to ever run against him. He did well against Flynt although 1974 was a disastrous year for Republican candidates nationally due to fallout from the Watergate scandal of the Nixon administration.

Gingrich sought a rematch against Flynt in 1976. While the Republicans did slightly better in the 1976 House elections than in 1974 nationally, the Democratic candidate in the 1976 presidential election was former governor of Georgia Jimmy Carter. Carter won more than two-thirds of the vote in his native Georgia. Gingrich lost his race by 5,100 votes.
As Gingrich primed for another run in the 1978 elections, Flynt decided to retire. Gingrich defeated Democratic state senator Virginia Shapard by 7,500 votes. Gingrich was re-elected five times from this district, before it was modified by redistricting. He faced a close general election race once—in the House elections of 1990—when he won by 978 votes in a primary race against Republican Herman Clark and won a narrow 974 vote victory over Democrat David Worley in the general. Although the district was trending Republican at the national level, conservative Democrats continued to hold most local offices, as well as most of the area&#x27;s seats in the General Assembly, well into the 1980s.

== Congress==
In 1981, Gingrich co-founded the Military Reform Caucus (MRC) and the Congressional Aviation and Space Caucus. During the 1983 congressional page sex scandal, Gingrich was among those calling for the expulsion of representatives Dan Crane and Gerry Studds. Gingrich supported a proposal to ban loans from the International Monetary Fund to Communist countries and he endorsed a bill to make Martin Luther King Jr. Day a new federal holiday.

In 1983, Gingrich founded the Conservative Opportunity Society (COS), a group that included young conservative House Republicans. Early COS members included Robert Smith Walker, Judd Gregg, Dan Coats and Connie Mack III. The group gradually expanded to include several dozen representatives, who met each week to exchange and develop ideas.

Gingrich&#x27;s analysis of polls and public opinion identified the group&#x27;s initial focus. Ronald Reagan adopted the &quot;opportunity society&quot; ideas for his 1984 re-election campaign, supporting the group&#x27;s conservative goals on economic growth, education, crime, and social issues. He had not emphasized these during his first term. Reagan also referred to an &quot;opportunity&quot; society in the first State of the Union address of his second term.

In March 1988, Gingrich voted against the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 (as well as to uphold President Reagan&#x27;s veto). In May 1988, Gingrich (along with 77 other House members and Common Cause) brought ethics charges against Democratic Speaker Jim Wright, who was alleged to have used a book deal to circumvent campaign-finance laws and House ethics rules. During the investigation, it was reported that Gingrich had his own unusual book deal, for &quot;Window of Opportunity,&quot; in which publicity expenses were covered by a limited partnership. It raised $105,000 from Republican political supporters to promote sales of Gingrich&#x27;s book. Gingrich&#x27;s success in forcing Wright&#x27;s resignation contributed to his rising influence in the Republican caucus.

In March 1989, Gingrich became House minority whip in a close election against Edward Rell Madigan. This was Gingrich&#x27;s first formal position of power within the Republican party. He said his intention was to &quot;build a much more aggressive, activist party&quot;. Early in his role as Whip, in May 1989, Gingrich was involved in talks about the appointment of a Panamanian administrator of the Panama Canal, which was scheduled to occur in 1989 subject to U.S. government approval. Gingrich was outspoken in his opposition to giving control over the canal to an administrator appointed by the dictatorship in Panama.

Gingrich and others in the House, including the newly minted Gang of Seven, railed against what they saw as ethical lapses during the nearly 40 years of Democratic control. The House banking scandal and Congressional Post Office scandal were emblems of the exposed corruption. Gingrich himself was among members of the House who had written NSF checks on the House bank. He had overdrafts on twenty-two checks, including a $9,463 check to the Internal Revenue Service in 1990.

In 1990, after consulting focus groups with the help of pollster Frank Luntz, GOPAC distributed a memo with a cover letter signed by Gingrich titled &quot;Language, a Key Mechanism of Control&quot;, that encouraged Republicans to &quot;speak like Newt&quot;. It contained lists of &quot;contrasting words&quot;—words with negative connotations such as &quot;radical&quot;, &quot;sick,&quot; and &quot;traitors&quot;—and &quot;optimistic positive governing words&quot; such as &quot;opportunity&quot;, &quot;courage&quot;, and &quot;principled&quot;, that Gingrich recommended for use in describing Democrats and Republicans, respectively.

During negotiations with the Democrats who held majorities in the House and Senate, President George H. W. Bush reached a deficit reduction package which contained tax increases despite his campaign promise of &quot;read my lips: no new taxes&quot;. Gingrich led a revolt that defeated the initial appropriations package and led to the 1990 United States federal government shutdown. The deal was supported by the President and Congressional leaders from both parties after long negotiations, but Gingrich walked out during a televised event in the White House Rose Garden. House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel characterized Gingrich&#x27;s revolt as &quot;a thousand points of spite&quot;.

Due to population increases recorded in the 1990 United States census, Georgia picked up an additional seat for the 1992 U.S. House elections. However, the Democratic-controlled Georgia General Assembly, under the leadership of fiercely partisan speaker of the House Tom Murphy, specifically targeted Gingrich, eliminating the district Gingrich represented. Gerrymandering split Gingrich&#x27;s territory among three neighboring districts. Much of the southern portion of Gingrich&#x27;s district, including his home in Carrollton, was drawn into the Columbus-based 3rd district, represented by five-term Democrat Richard Ray. Gingrich remarked that &quot;The Speaker, by raising money and gerrymandering, has sincerely dedicated a part of his career to wiping me out.&quot; Charles S. Bullock III, a political science professor at the University of Georgia, said &quot;Speaker Murphy didn&#x27;t like having a Republican represent him.&quot; At the onset of the decade, Gingrich proved to be the only Republican representative of Georgia&#x27;s 10 congressional districts until 1992, with the creation of Georgia&#x27;s 4th congressional district and the Republican gains of Jack Kingston and Mac Collins.

The Assembly created a new, heavily Republican 6th district in Fulton and Cobb counties in the wealthy northern suburbs of Atlanta—an area that Gingrich had never represented. Gingrich sold his home in Carrollton and moved to Marietta in the new district. His primary opponent, State Representative Herman Clark, who had challenged Gingrich two years earlier, made an issue out of Gingrich&#x27;s 22 overdraft checks in the House banking scandal, and also criticized Gingrich for moving into the district. After a recount, Gingrich prevailed by 980 votes, with a 51 to 49 percent result. His winning the primary all but assured him of election in November. He was re-elected three times from this district against nominal Democratic opposition.

In 1995, Gingrich&#x27;s 1993 college course, entitled &quot;Renewing American Civilization&quot;, taught on Saturdays at Reinhardt College in Waleska, Georgia, was televised on the cable channel, Mind Extension University.

In the 1994 campaign season, in an effort to offer an alternative to Democratic policies and to unite distant wings of the Republican Party, Gingrich and several other Republicans came up with a Contract with America, which laid out 10 policies that Republicans promised to bring to a vote on the House floor during the first 100 days of the new Congress, if they won the election. The contract was signed by Gingrich and other Republican candidates for the House of Representatives. The contract ranged from issues such as welfare reform, term limits, crime, and a balanced budget/tax limitation amendment, to more specialized legislation such as restrictions on American military participation in United Nations missions.

=== Republican Revolution ===

In the November 1994 midterm elections, Republicans gained 54 seats and took control of the House for the first time since 1954. Long-time House minority leader Bob Michel of Illinois had not run for re-election, giving Gingrich, the highest-ranking Republican returning to Congress, the inside track at becoming Speaker. The midterm election that turned congressional power over to Republicans &quot;changed the center of gravity&quot; in the nation&#x27;s capital. &quot;Time&quot; magazine named Gingrich its 1995 &quot;Man of the Year&quot; for his role in the election.

== Speaker of the House ==


The House fulfilled Gingrich&#x27;s promise to bring all ten of the Contract&#x27;s issues to a vote within the first 100 days of the session. President Clinton called it the &quot;Contract on America&quot;.

Legislation proposed by the 104th United States Congress included term limits for Congressional Representatives, tax cuts, welfare reform, and a balanced budget amendment, as well as independent auditing of the finances of the House of Representatives and elimination of non-essential services such as the House barbershop and shoe-shine concessions. Following Gingrich&#x27;s first two years as House Speaker, the Republican majority was re-elected in the 1996 election, the first time Republicans had done so in 68 years and the first time in 80 years that they won a House election simultaneous to a Democratic president being re-elected.

As Speaker, Gingrich sought to increasingly tie Christian conservatism to the Republican Party. According to a 2018 study, Christian conservatism had become firmly ingrained in the Republican Party&#x27;s policy platforms by 2000. Yale University congressional scholar David Mayhew describes Gingrich as profoundly influential, saying &quot;In Gingrich, we have as good a case as we are likely to see of a member of Congress operating in the public sphere with consequence.&quot;

In 1997 Speaker Gingrich visited Taiwan as well as Beijing in mainland China.

=== Role in political polarization ===
A number of scholars have credited Gingrich with playing a key role in undermining democratic norms in the United States, and hastening political polarization and partisan prejudice. According to Harvard University political scientists Daniel Ziblatt and Steven Levitsky, Gingrich&#x27;s speakership had a profound and lasting impact on American politics and health of American democracy. They argue that Gingrich instilled a &quot;combative&quot; approach in the Republican Party, where hateful language and hyper-partisanship became commonplace, and where democratic norms were abandoned. Gingrich frequently questioned the patriotism of Democrats, called them corrupt, compared them to fascists, and accused them of wanting to destroy the United States. Gingrich furthermore oversaw several major government shutdowns.

University of Maryland political scientist Lilliana Mason identified Gingrich&#x27;s instructions to Republicans to use words such as &quot;betray, bizarre, decay, destroy, devour, greed, lie, pathetic, radical, selfish, shame, sick, steal, and traitors&quot; about Democrats as an example of a breach in social norms and exacerbation of partisan prejudice. Gingrich is a key figure in the 2017 book &quot;The Polarizers&quot; by Colgate University political scientist Sam Rosenfeld about the American political system&#x27;s shift to polarization and gridlock. Rosenfeld describes Gingrich as follows, &quot;For Gingrich, responsible party principles were paramount... From the outset, he viewed the congressional minority party&#x27;s role in terms akin to those found in parliamentary systems, prioritizing drawing stark programmatic contrasts over engaging the majority party as junior participants in governance.&quot;

Boston College political scientist David Hopkins writes that Gingrich helped to nationalize American politics in a way where Democratic politicians on the state and local level were increasingly tied to the national Democratic party and President Clinton. Hopkins notes that Gingrich&#x27;s view

directly contradicted the conventional wisdom of politics... that parties in a two-party system achieve increasing electoral success as they move closer to the ideological center... Gingrich and his allies believed that an organized effort to intensify the ideological contrast between the congressional parties would allow the Republicans to make electoral inroads in the South. They worked energetically to tie individual Democratic incumbents to the party&#x27;s more liberal national leadership while simultaneously raising highly charged cultural issues in Congress, such as proposed constitutional amendments to allow prayer in public schools and to ban the burning of the American flag, on which conservative positions were widely popular – especially among southern voters. 

Gingrich&#x27;s view was however vindicated with the Republican Party&#x27;s success in the 1994 U.S. midterm elections, sometimes referred to as the &quot;Gingrich Revolution.&quot; Hopkins writes, &quot;More than any speaker before or since, Gingrich had become both the strategic architect and public face of his party.&quot; One consequence of the increasing nationalization of politics was that moderate Republican incumbents in blue states were left more vulnerable to electoral defeat.

According to University of Texas political scientist Sean M. Theriault, Gingrich had a profound influence on other Republican lawmakers, in particular those who served with him in the House, as they adopted his obstructionist tactics. A 2011 study by Theriault and Duke University political scientist David W. Rohde in the &quot;Journal of Politics&quot; found that &quot;almost the entire growth in Senate party polarization since the early 1970s can be accounted for by Republican senators who previously served in the House after 1978&quot; when Gingrich was first elected to the House.

Gingrich consolidated power in the Speaker&#x27;s office. Gingrich elevated junior and more ideologically extreme House members to powerful committees, such as the Appropriations Committee, which over time led to the obliteration of internal norms in the committees. Term limits were also imposed on committee chairs, which prevented Republican chairs from developing a power base separate from the Republican Party. As a result, the power of Gingrich was strengthened and there was an increase in conformity among Republican congresspeople.

=== Legislation ===

==== Welfare reform ====
A central pledge of President Bill Clinton&#x27;s campaign was to reform the welfare system, adding changes such as work requirements for recipients. However, by 1994, the Clinton administration appeared to be more concerned with pursuing a universal health care program. Gingrich accused Clinton of stalling on welfare, and proclaimed that Congress could pass a welfare reform bill in as little as 90 days. He insisted that the Republican Party would continue to apply political pressure on the President to approve their welfare legislation.

In 1996, after constructing two welfare reform bills that Clinton vetoed, Gingrich and his supporters pushed for passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, which was intended to reconstruct the welfare system. The act gave state governments more autonomy over welfare delivery, while also reducing the federal government&#x27;s responsibilities. It instituted the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which placed time limits on welfare assistance and replaced the longstanding Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. Other changes to the welfare system included stricter conditions for food stamp eligibility, reductions in immigrant welfare assistance, and work requirements for recipients. The bill was signed into law by President Clinton on August 22, 1996.

In his 1998 book &quot;Lessons Learned the Hard Way&quot;, Gingrich encouraged volunteerism and spiritual renewal, placing more importance on families, creating tax incentives and reducing regulations for businesses in poor neighborhoods, and increasing property ownership by low-income families. He also praised Habitat for Humanity for sparking the movement to improve people&#x27;s lives by helping them build their own homes.

==== Balancing the federal budget ====
A key aspect of the 1994 Contract with America was the promise of a balanced federal budget. After the end of the government shutdown, Gingrich and other Republican leaders acknowledged that Congress would not be able to draft a balanced budget in 1996. Instead, they opted to approve some small reductions that were already approved by the White House and to wait until the next election season.

By May 1997, Republican congressional leaders reached a compromise with Democrats and President Clinton on the federal budget. The agreement called for a federal spending plan designed to reduce the federal deficit and achieve a balanced budget by 2002. The plan included a total of $152 billion in bipartisan tax cuts over five years. Other major parts of the spending plan called for $115 billion to be saved through a restructuring of Medicare, $24 billion set aside to extend health insurance to children of the working poor, tax credits for college tuition, and a $2 billion welfare-to-work jobs initiative.

President Clinton signed the budget legislation in August 1997. At the signing, Gingrich gave credit to ordinary Americans stating, &quot;It was their political will that brought the two parties together.&quot;

In early 1998, with the economy performing better than expected, increased tax revenues helped reduce the federal budget deficit to below $25 billion. Clinton submitted a balanced budget for 1999, three years ahead of schedule originally proposed, making it the first time the federal budget had been balanced since 1969.

==== Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 ====
In 1997, President Clinton signed into effect the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which included the largest capital gains tax cut in U.S. history. Under the act, the profits on the sale of a personal residence ($500,000 for married couples, $250,000 for singles) were exempted if lived in for at least two of the previous five years. (This had previously been limited to a $125,000 once-in-a-lifetime exemption for those over the age of 55.) There were also reductions in a number of other taxes on investment gains.

Additionally, the act raised the value of inherited estates and gifts that could be sheltered from taxation. Gingrich has been credited with creating the agenda for the reduction in capital gains tax, especially in the Contract with America, which set out to balance the budget and implement decreases in estate and capital gains tax. Some Republicans felt that the compromise reached with Clinton on the budget and tax act was inadequate; however, Gingrich stated that the tax cuts were a significant accomplishment for the Republican Congress in the face of opposition from the Clinton administration. Gingrich along with Bob Dole had earlier set-up the Kemp Commission, headed by former US Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp, a tax reform commission that made several recommendations including that dividends, interest, and capital gains should be untaxed.

==== Other legislation ====
Among the first pieces of legislation passed by the new Congress under Gingrich was the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, which subjected members of Congress to the same laws that apply to businesses and their employees, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. As a provision of the Contract with America, the law was symbolic of the new Republican majority&#x27;s goal to remove some of the entitlements enjoyed by Congress. The bill received near universal acceptance from the House and Senate and was signed into law on January 23, 1995.

Gingrich shut down the highly regarded Office of Technology Assessment, and relied instead on what the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists called &quot;self-interested lobbyists and think tanks&quot;.

=== Government shutdown ===
Gingrich and the incoming Republican majority&#x27;s promise to slow the rate of government spending conflicted with the president&#x27;s agenda for Medicare, education, the environment and public health, leading to two temporary shutdowns of the federal government totaling 28 days.

Clinton said Republican amendments would strip the U.S. Treasury of its ability to dip into federal trust funds to avoid a borrowing crisis. Republican amendments would have limited appeals by death-row inmates, made it harder to issue health, safety and environmental regulations, and would have committed the president to a seven-year balanced budget. Clinton vetoed a second bill allowing the government to keep operating beyond the time when most spending authority expires.

A GOP amendment opposed by Clinton would not only have increased Medicare Part B premiums, but it would also cancel a scheduled reduction. The Republicans held out for an increase in Medicare Part B premiums in January 1996 to $53.50 a month. Clinton favored the then current law, which was to let the premium that seniors pay drop to $42.50.

The government closed most non-essential offices during the shutdown, which was the longest in U.S. history at the time. The shutdown ended when Clinton agreed to submit a CBO-approved balanced budget plan.

During the crisis, Gingrich&#x27;s public image suffered from the perception that the Republicans&#x27; hardline budget stance was owed partly to an alleged snub of Gingrich by Clinton during a flight on Air Force One to and from Yitzhak Rabin&#x27;s funeral in Israel. That perception developed after the trip when Gingrich, while being questioned by Lars-Erik Nelson at a &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; breakfast, said that he was dissatisfied that Clinton had not invited him to discuss the budget during the flight. He complained that he and Dole were instructed to use the plane&#x27;s rear exit to deplane, saying the snub was &quot;part of why you ended up with us sending down a tougher continuing resolution&quot;. In response to Gingrich&#x27;s complaint that they were &quot;forced to use the rear door,&quot; NBC news released their videotape footage showing both Gingrich and Dole disembarking at Tel Aviv just behind Clinton via the front stairway.

Gingrich was widely lampooned for implying that the government shutdown was a result of his personal grievances, including a widely shared editorial cartoon depicting him as a baby throwing a tantrum.

Democratic leaders, including Chuck Schumer, took the opportunity to attack Gingrich&#x27;s motives for the budget standoff. In 1998, Gingrich said that these comments were his &quot;single most avoidable mistake&quot; as Speaker.

Discussing the impact of the government shutdown on the Republican Party, Gingrich later commented that, &quot;Everybody in Washington thinks that was a big mistake. They&#x27;re exactly wrong. There had been no reelected Republican majority since 1928. Part of the reason we got reelected ... is our base thought we were serious. And they thought we were serious because when it came to a show-down, we didn&#x27;t flinch.&quot; In a 2011 op-ed in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Gingrich said that the government shutdown led to the balanced-budget deal in 1997 and the first four consecutive balanced budgets since the 1920s, as well as the first re-election of a Republican majority since 1928.

=== Ethics charges and reprimand ===

Eighty-four ethics charges were filed by Democrats against Gingrich during his term as Speaker. All were eventually dropped except for one: claiming tax-exempt status for a college course run for political purposes. On January 21, 1997, the House officially reprimanded Gingrich (in a vote of 395 in favor, 28 opposed) and &quot;ordered [him] to reimburse the House for some of the costs of the investigation in the amount of $300,000&quot;. It was the first time a Speaker was disciplined for an ethics violation.

Additionally, the House Ethics Committee concluded that inaccurate information supplied to investigators on behalf of Gingrich represented &quot;intentional or ... reckless&quot; disregard of House rules. The Ethics Committee&#x27;s Special Counsel James M. Cole concluded that Gingrich had violated federal tax law and had lied to the ethics panel in an effort to force the committee to dismiss the complaint against him. The full committee panel did not agree whether tax law had been violated and left that issue up to the IRS. In 1999, the IRS cleared the organizations connected with the &quot;Renewing American Civilization&quot; courses under investigation for possible tax violations.

Regarding the situation, Gingrich said in January 1997, &quot;I did not manage the effort intensely enough to thoroughly direct or review information being submitted to the committee on my behalf. In my name and over my signature, inaccurate, incomplete and unreliable statements were given to the committee, but I did not intend to mislead the committee ... I brought down on the people&#x27;s house a controversy which could weaken the faith people have in their government.&quot;

=== Leadership challenge ===

In the summer of 1997, several House Republicans attempted to replace him as Speaker, arguing Gingrich&#x27;s public image was a liability. The attempted &quot;coup&quot; began July 9 with a meeting of Republican conference chairman John Boehner of Ohio and Republican leadership chairman Bill Paxon of New York. According to their plan, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, Boehner and Paxon were to present Gingrich with an ultimatum: resign, or be voted out.

However, Armey balked at the proposal to make Paxon the new Speaker, and told his chief of staff to warn Gingrich. On July 11, Gingrich met with senior Republican leadership to assess the situation. He explained that under no circumstance would he step down. If he was voted out, there would be a new election for Speaker. This would allow for the possibility that Democrats, along with dissenting Republicans, would vote in Democrat Dick Gephardt as Speaker.

On July 16, Paxon offered to resign his post, feeling that he had not handled the situation correctly, as the only member of the leadership who had been appointed to his positionby Gingrichinstead of elected. Gingrich accepted Paxon&#x27;s resignation and directed Paxon to immediately vacate his leadership office space.

=== Resignation ===
In 1998, Gingrich&#x27;s private polls had given his fellow Republicans the impression that pushing the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal would damage Clinton&#x27;s popularity and result in the party winning a net total of six to thirty seats in the House of Representatives. At the same time, Gingrich was having an affair with a woman 23 years his junior. But instead of gaining seats, Republicans lost five, the worst midterm performance in 64 years by a party not holding the presidency. Other ethics violations, including an unpopular book deal, added to his unpopularity even though he himself was reelected in his own district.

The day after the election, a Republican caucus ready to rebel against him prompted his resignation of the speakership. He also announced he intended a full departure from the House a few weeks later. In January 1999 he resigned his seat. When relinquishing the speakership, Gingrich referred to other Republicans when he said he was &quot;not willing to preside over people who are cannibals&quot;. Writing a retrospective on his career at that point, &quot;The New York Times&quot; in November 1998 described Gingrich as &quot;an expert in how to seize power, but a novice in holding it&quot; further opining that he &quot;illustrate[d] how hard it is for a radical, polarizing figure to last in leadership&quot;.

In December 1997, Gingrich flirted with a potential run for president in the 2000 election, but his party&#x27;s midterm performance and his subsequent resignation led him to drop any plans to do so.

== Post-speakership ==
Gingrich has since remained involved in national politics and public policy debate. McKay Coppins of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; summarized time with Gingrich in 2018:

[Gingrich] is dabbling in geopolitics, dining in fine Italian restaurants. When he feels like traveling, he crisscrosses the Atlantic in business class, opining on the issues of the day from bicontinental TV studios and giving speeches for $600 a minute. There is time for reading, and writing, and midday zoo trips—and even he will admit, &quot;It&#x27;s a very fun life.&quot;

=== Policy ===

In 2003, he founded the Center for Health Transformation. Gingrich supported the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, which created the Medicare Part D federal prescription drugs benefit program. Some conservatives have criticized him for favoring the plan, due to its cost. In a May 15, 2011, interview on Meet the Press, Gingrich repeated his long-held belief that &quot;all of us have a responsibility to pay—help pay for health care&quot;, and suggested this could be implemented by either a mandate to obtain health insurance or a requirement to post a bond ensuring coverage. In the same interview Gingrich said &quot;I don&#x27;t think right-wing social engineering is any more desirable than left-wing social engineering. I don&#x27;t think imposing radical change from the right or the left is a very good way for a free society to operate.&quot; This comment caused backlash within the Republican Party.

In 2005, with Hillary Clinton, Gingrich announced the proposed 21st Century Health Information Act, a bill which aimed to replace paperwork with confidential, electronic health information networks. Gingrich also co-chaired an independent congressional study group made up of health policy experts formed in 2007 to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of action taken within the U.S. to fight Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

Gingrich has served on several commissions, including the Hart–Rudman Commission, formally known as the U.S. Commission on National Security/21st century, which examined national security issues affecting the armed forces, law enforcement and intelligence agencies. In 2005 he became the co-chair of a task force for UN reform, which aimed to produce a plan for the U.S. to help strengthen the UN. For over two decades, Gingrich has taught at the United States Air Force&#x27;s Air University, where, as of 2010, he was the longest-serving teacher of the Joint Flag Officer Warfighting Course. In addition, he is an honorary distinguished visiting scholar and professor at the National Defense University and, as of 2012, was teaching officers from all of the defense services. Gingrich informally advised Defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld on strategic issues, on issues including the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and encouraging the Pentagon to not &quot;yield&quot; foreign policy influence to the State Department and National Security Council. Gingrich is also a guiding coalition member of the Project on National Security Reform.

Gingrich founded and served as the chairman of American Solutions for Winning the Future, a 527 group established in 2007. The group was a &quot;fundraising juggernaut&quot; that raised $52 million from major donors, such as Sheldon Adelson and the coal company Peabody Energy. The group promoted deregulation and increased offshore oil drilling and other fossil-fuel extraction and opposed the Employee Free Choice Act; &quot;Politico&quot; reported, &quot;The operation, which includes a pollster and fundraisers, promotes Gingrich&#x27;s books, sends out direct mail, airs ads touting his causes and funds his travel across the country.&quot; American Solutions closed in 2011 after he left the organization.

Other organizations and companies founded or chaired by Gingrich include the creative production company Gingrich Productions, and religious educational organization Renewing American Leadership.

Gingrich is a former member of the Council on Foreign Relations.

He is a fellow at conservative think tanks the American Enterprise Institute and Hoover Institution. He sometimes serves as a commentator, guest or panel member on cable news shows, such as the Fox News Channel. He is listed as a contributor by Fox News Channel, and frequently appears as a guest on various segments; he has also hosted occasional specials for the Fox News Channel. Gingrich has signed the &quot;Strong America Now&quot; pledge committing to promoting Six Sigma methods to reduce government spending.

Gingrich founded Advocates for Opioid Recovery together with former Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy and Van Jones, a former domestic policy adviser to President Barack Obama.

=== Businesses ===
After leaving Congress in 1999, Gingrich started a number of for-profit companies: Between 2001 and 2010, the companies he and his wife owned in full or part had revenues of almost $100 million. As of 2015, Gingrich served as an advisor to the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.

According to financial disclosure forms released in July 2011, Gingrich and his wife had a net worth of at least $6.7 million in 2010, compared to a maximum net worth of $2.4 million in 2006. Most of the increase in his net worth was because of payments to him from his for-profit companies.

==== Gingrich Group and the Center for Health Transformation ====
The Gingrich Group was organized in 1999 as a consulting company. Over time, its non-health clients were dropped, and it was renamed the Center for Health Transformation. The two companies had revenues of $55 million between 2001 and 2010. The revenues came from more than 300 health-insurance companies and other clients, with membership costing as much as $200,000 per year in exchange for access to Gingrich and other perks. In 2011, when Gingrich became a presidential candidate, he sold his interest in the business and said he would release the full list of his clients and the amounts he was paid, &quot;to the extent we can&quot;.

In April 2012, the Center for Health Transformation filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, planning to liquidate its assets to meet debts of $1–$10 million.

Between 2001 and 2010, Gingrich consulted for Freddie Mac, a government-sponsored secondary home mortgage company, which was concerned about new regulations under consideration by Congress. Regarding payments of $1.6 million for the consulting, Gingrich said that &quot;Freddie Mac paid Gingrich Group, which has a number of employees and a number of offices, a consulting fee, just like you would pay any other consulting firm.&quot; In January 2012, he said that he could not make public his contract with Freddie Mac, even though the company gave permission, until his business partners in the Center for Health Transformation also agreed to that.

==== Gingrich Productions ====
Gingrich Productions, which is headed by Gingrich&#x27;s wife Callista Gingrich, was created in 2007. According to the company&#x27;s website, in May 2011, it is &quot;a performance and production company featuring the work of Newt and Callista Gingrich. Newt and Callista host and produce historical and public policy documentaries, write books, record audio books and voiceovers, produce photographic essays, and make television and radio appearances.&quot;

Between 2008 and 2011, the company produced three films on religion, one on energy, one on Ronald Reagan, and one on the threat of radical Islam. All were joint projects with the conservative group Citizens United. In 2011, Newt and Callista appeared in &quot;A City Upon a Hill&quot;, on the subject of American exceptionalism.

As of May 2011, the company had about five employees. In 2010, it paid Gingrich more than $2.4 million.

==== Gingrich Communications ====
Gingrich Communications promoted Gingrich&#x27;s public appearances, including his Fox News contract and his website, newt.org. By 2011 Gingrich received as much as $60,000 for a speech, and did as many as 80 in a year. One of Gingrich&#x27;s nonprofit groups, Renewing American Leadership, which was founded in March 2009, paid Gingrich Communications $220,000 over two years; the charity shared the names of its donors with Gingrich, who could use them for his for-profit companies. Gingrich Communications, which employed 15 people at its largest, closed in 2011 when Gingrich began his presidential campaign.

==== Other ====
* Celebrity Leaders is a booking agency that handled Gingrich&#x27;s speaking engagements, as well as those other clients such as former Republican National Committee chair Michael Steele and former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum. Kathy Lubbers, the President and CEO of the agency, who is Gingrich&#x27;s daughter, owns the agency. Gingrich has shares in the agency, and was paid more than $70,000 by it in 2010.
* FGH Publications handles the production of and royalties from fiction books co-authored by Gingrich.

=== Political activity ===
Between 2005 and 2007, Gingrich expressed interest in running for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination. On October 13, 2005, Gingrich suggested he was considering a run for president, saying, &quot;There are circumstances where I will run&quot;, elaborating that those circumstances would be if no other candidate champions some of the platform ideas he advocates. On September 28, 2007, Gingrich announced that if his supporters pledged $30 million to his campaign by October 21, he would seek the nomination.

However, insisting that he had &quot;pretty strongly&quot; considered running, on September 29 spokesman Rick Tyler said that Gingrich would not seek the presidency in 2008 because he could not continue to serve as chairman of American Solutions if he did so. Citing campaign finance law restrictions (the McCain-Feingold campaign law would have forced him to leave his American Solutions political organization if he declared his candidacy), Gingrich said, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t prepared to abandon American Solutions, even to explore whether a campaign was realistic.&quot;

During the 2009 special election in New York&#x27;s 23rd congressional district, Gingrich endorsed moderate Republican candidate Dede Scozzafava, rather than Conservative Party candidate Doug Hoffman, who had been endorsed by several nationally prominent Republicans. He was heavily criticized for this endorsement, with conservatives questioning his candidacy for president in 2012 and even comparing him to Benedict Arnold.

Prior to President Donald Trump leaving office in January 2021, Trump appointed Gingrich to the Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee of the Pentagon as part of a series of shakeups where prominent Trump loyalists replaced former members. In February 2021, Biden-appointed Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin dismissed all appointments to the committee made by Trump, including Gingrich.

=== 2012 presidential run ===
In late 2008, several political commentators, including Marc Ambinder in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; and Robert Novak in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, identified Gingrich as a top presidential contender in the 2012 election, with Ambinder reporting that Gingrich was &quot;already planting some seeds in Iowa, New Hampshire&quot;. A July 2010 poll conducted by Public Policy Polling indicated that Gingrich was the leading GOP contender for the Republican nomination with 23% of likely Republican voters saying they would vote for him.

Describing his views as a possible candidate during an appearance on &quot;On the Record&quot; with Greta Van Susteren in March 2009, Gingrich said, &quot;I am very sad that a number of Republicans do not understand that this country is sick of earmarks. [Americans] are sick of politicians taking care of themselves. They are sick of their money being spent in a way that is absolutely indefensible ... I think you&#x27;re going to see a steady increase in the number of incumbents who have opponents because the American taxpayers are increasingly fed up.&quot;

On March 3, 2011, Gingrich officially announced a website entitled &quot;Newt Exploratory 2012&quot; in lieu of a formal exploratory committee for exploration of a potential presidential run. On May 11, 2011, Gingrich officially announced his intention to seek the GOP nomination in 2012.

On June 9, 2011, a group of Gingrich&#x27;s senior campaign aides left the campaign en masse, leading to doubts about the viability of his presidential run. On June 21, 2011, two more senior aides left.

In response, Gingrich stated that he had not quit the race for the Republican nomination, and pointed to his experience running for 5 years to win his seat in Congress, spending 16 years helping to build a Republican majority in the house and working for decades to build a Republican majority in Georgia. Some commentators noted Gingrich&#x27;s resilience throughout his career, in particular with regard to his presidential campaign.

After then-front-runner Herman Cain was damaged by allegations of past sexual harassment, Gingrich gained support, and quickly became a contender in the race, especially after Cain suspended his campaign. By December 4, 2011, Gingrich was leading in the national polls. However, after an abundance of negative ads run by his opponents throughout December, Gingrich&#x27;s national polling lead had fallen to a tie with Mitt Romney.

On January 3, 2012, Gingrich finished in fourth place in the Iowa Republican caucuses, far behind Rick Santorum, Romney, and Ron Paul. On January 10, Gingrich finished in fifth place in the New Hampshire Republican primary, far behind Romney, Santorum, Jon Huntsman, and Paul.

After the field narrowed with the withdrawal from the race of Huntsman and Rick Perry, Gingrich won the South Carolina Republican primary on January 21, obtaining about 40% of the vote, considerably ahead of Romney, Santorum and Paul. This surprise victory allowed Gingrich to reemerge as the frontrunner once again heading into Florida.

On January 31, 2012, Gingrich placed second in the Republican Florida primary, losing by a fifteen percentage point margin, 47% to 32%. Some factors that contributed to this outcome include two strong debate performances by Romney (which were typically Gingrich&#x27;s strong suit), the wide margin by which the Gingrich campaign was outspent in television ads, and a widely criticized proposal by Gingrich to have a permanent colony on the moon by 2020 to reinvigorate the American Space Program.

It was later revealed Romney had hired a debate coach to help him perform better in the Florida debates.

Gingrich did, however, significantly outvote Santorum and Paul. On February 4, 2012, Gingrich placed a distant second in the Nevada Republican caucuses with 21%, losing to Romney who received over 50% of the total votes cast.

On February 7, 2012, Gingrich came in last place in the Minnesota Republican caucuses with about 10.7% of the vote. Santorum won the caucus, followed by Paul and Romney.

On Super Tuesday Gingrich won his home state, Georgia, which has the most delegates, in &quot;an otherwise dismal night for him&quot;. Santorum took Tennessee and Oklahoma, where Gingrich had previously performed well in the polls, though Gingrich managed a close third behind Romney.

On April 4, the Rick Santorum campaign shifted its position and urged Gingrich to drop out of the race and support Santorum.

On April 10, Santorum announced the suspension of his campaign. Following this announcement, The Newt 2012 campaign used a new slogan referring to Gingrich as &quot;the last conservative standing&quot;. Despite this, on April 19, Gingrich told Republicans in New York that he would work to help Romney win the general election if Romney secured the nomination.

After a disappointing second place showing in the Delaware primary on April 24, and with a campaign debt in excess of $4 million, Gingrich suspended his campaign and endorsed front-runner Mitt Romney on May 2, 2012, on whose behalf he subsequently campaigned (i.e. stump speeches and television appearances).

Gingrich later hosted a number of policy workshops at the GOP Convention in Tampa presented by the National Republican Committee called &quot;Newt University&quot;. He and his wife Calista addressed the convention on its final day with a Ronald Reagan-themed introduction.

Because FEC regulations prevent campaigns from ceasing operations until they settle their debts, the Newt Gingrich campaign was never formally dissolved. In 2016, the campaign filed a proposal to shut down without paying back its outstanding debt to 114 businesses and consultants; the FEC rejected this proposal. By then, the campaign still owed $4.6 million in debt, with only $17,000 being raised by the campaign committee over the previous year.

=== 2016 election ===

Gingrich supported Donald Trump more quickly than many other establishment Republicans. After having consulted for Trump&#x27;s 2016 campaign, Gingrich encouraged his fellow Republicans to unify behind Trump, who had by then become the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Gingrich reportedly figured among Trump&#x27;s final three choices to be his running mate; the position ultimately went to Governor of Indiana Mike Pence.

Following Trump&#x27;s victory in the presidential election, speculation arose concerning Gingrich as a possible secretary of state, chief of staff or advisor. Eventually, Gingrich announced that he would not be serving in the cabinet. He stated that he didn&#x27;t have the interest in serving in any role related to the Trump administration, stressing that as a private citizen he would engage with individuals for &quot;strategic planning&quot; rather than job-seeking.

In May 2017, he promoted a conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party had Seth Rich, an employee for the Democratic National Committee, killed during the 2016 presidential race.

Gingrich attended his wife&#x27;s swearing-in as U.S. ambassador to the Holy See at the White House in October 2017. According to journalist Robert Mickens, Newt Gingrich served as the de facto ambassador or the &quot;shadow ambassador&quot; while Callista Gingrich, as paraphrased by McKay Coppins of &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, &quot;is generally viewed as the ceremonial face of the embassy&quot;.

=== 2020 election ===
While ballots were being counted during the 2020 election, Gingrich supported President Trump in his attempt to win re-election and called on him to stop the vote counts after unsubstantiated allegations of fraud emerged. After the 2020 election, Gingrich made unsupported claims of election fraud and refused to acknowledge Joe Biden&#x27;s victory. He called for the arrest of poll workers in Pennsylvania following the election.

===2022 election===

In January 2022, Gingrich told Fox News presenter Maria Bartiromo that members of the House Select Committee investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol faced a real risk of jail after Republicans take over Congress, accusing them of breaking laws without explaining which laws were broken:
&quot;I think when you have a Republican Congress, this is all going to come crashing down, ... and the wolves are going to find out that they’re now sheep and they’re the ones who are in fact, I think, face a real risk of jail for the kinds of laws they’re breaking&quot;,
which was interpreted by CNN and others as a threat.

In July 2022, he was featured at an America First Policy Institute conference promoting a &quot;Trump-inspired platform for the 2024 GOP presidential nominee&quot;.
As of August 2022, Gingrich was advising Kevin McCarthy and House Republicans for the 2022 midterm elections, according to journalist Dana Milbank.

== Political positions ==


Gingrich is most widely identified with the 1994 Contract with America. He is a founder of American Solutions for Winning the Future. More recently, Gingrich has advocated replacing the Environmental Protection Agency with a proposed &quot;Environmental Solutions Agency&quot;.

He favors an immigration border policy and a guest worker program. In terms of energy policy, he has argued in favor of flex-fuel mandates for cars sold in the U.S. and promoted the use of ethanol generally. In August 2021 Gingrich was said to have echoed the Great Replacement theory during a Fox News interview.

Gingrich has taken a dim view of internationalism and the United Nations. He said in 2015, &quot;after several years of looking at the UN, I can report to you that it is sufficiently corrupt and sufficiently inefficient that no reasonable person would put faith in it.&quot;

In 2007, Gingrich authored a book, &quot;Rediscovering God in America&quot;.

Gingrich&#x27;s later books take a large-scale policy focus, including &quot;Winning the Future&quot;, and the most recent, &quot;To Save America&quot;. Gingrich has identified education as &quot;the number one factor in our future prosperity&quot;, and has partnered with Al Sharpton and Education Secretary Arne Duncan on education issues. Although he previously opposed gay marriage, in December 2012, Gingrich suggested that Republicans should reconsider their opposition to it.

In 2014, Gingrich sent a letter to Dr. John Koza of National Popular Vote, Inc. endorsing the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, under which participating states would award their Electoral College votes to the winner of the national popular vote of the United States.

On July 14, 2016, Gingrich stated that he believes that Americans of Muslim backgrounds who believe in Sharia law should be deported, and that visiting websites that promote the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant or Al-Qaeda should be a felony. Some observers have questioned whether these views violate the free speech and free exercise of religion clauses of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.

On July 21, 2016, Gingrich argued that members of NATO &quot;ought to worry&quot; about a U.S. commitment to their defense. He expanded, saying, &quot;They ought to worry about commitment under any circumstances. Every president has been saying that the NATO countries do not pay their fair share&quot;. He also stated that, in the context of whether the United States would provide aid to Estonia (a NATO member) in the event of a Russian invasion, he &quot;would think about it a great deal&quot;.

According to &quot;Science&quot; magazine, Gingrich changed his view on climate change &quot;from cautious skeptic in the late 1980s to believer in the late 2000s to skeptic again during the [2016] campaign.&quot;

In January 2022, Gingrich characterized the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack as &quot;basically a lynch mob&quot; that was violating laws and trampling on civil liberties, suggesting committee members might be jailed if Republicans took control of the House in that year&#x27;s election.

== Personal life ==

=== Marriages and children ===
==== Jacqueline May &quot;Jackie&quot; Battley ====
Gingrich has been married three times. In 1962, he wed Jacqueline May &quot;Jackie&quot; Battley (February 21, 1936 – August 7, 2013), his former high school geometry teacher, when he was 19 years old and she was 26. They had two daughters: Kathy, who is president of Gingrich Communications, and Jackie Sue, who is an author, conservative columnist and political commentator.

Throughout his congressional campaign in 1974, Gingrich was having an affair with a young volunteer. An aide who worked with Gingrich throughout the 1970s stated that &quot;it was common knowledge that Newt was involved with other women during his marriage to Jackie.&quot; In the spring of 1980, he filed for divorce from Jackie after beginning an affair with Marianne Ginther. Jackie later said in 1984 that the divorce was a &quot;complete surprise&quot; to her.

In September 1980, according to friends who knew them both, Newt visited Jackie in the hospital the day after she had undergone surgery to treat her uterine cancer; once there, Newt began talking about the terms of their divorce, at which point Jackie threw him out of the room. Gingrich disputed that account. Although Newt&#x27;s presidential campaign staff continued to insist in 2011 that Jackie had requested the divorce, court documents from Carroll County, Georgia, indicated that she had in fact asked a judge to block the process, stating that although &quot;she has adequate and ample grounds for divorce ... she does not desire one at this time [and] does not admit that this marriage is irretrievably broken.&quot;

According to L. H. Carter, Gingrich&#x27;s campaign treasurer, Gingrich said of Jackie: &quot;She&#x27;s not young enough or pretty enough to be the wife of the President. And besides, she has cancer.&quot; Newt has denied saying it. Following the divorce, Jackie had to raise money from friends in her congregation to help her and the children make ends meet; she later filed a petition in court stating that Newt had failed to properly provide for his family. Newt submitted a financial statement to the judge, which showed that he had been &quot;providing only $400 a month, plus $40 in allowances for his daughters. He claimed not to be able to afford any more. But in citing his own expenses, he listed $400 just for &#x27;Food / dry cleaning, etc.&#x27;—for one person.&quot; In 1981, a judge ordered him to provide considerably more; in 1993, Jackie stated in court that Newt had failed to obey the 1981 order &quot;from the day it was issued.&quot; Jackie, a deacon and volunteer in the First Baptist Church of Carrollton, Georgia, died in 2013 in Atlanta at the age of 77.

==== Marianne Ginther ====
In 1981, six months after his divorce from Jackie was final, Gingrich wed Marianne Ginther. Marianne helped control their finances to get them out of debt. She did not, however, want to have the public life of a politician&#x27;s wife. His daughter Kathy described the marriage as &quot;difficult&quot;.

==== Callista Bisek ====
In 1993, while still married to Marianne, Gingrich began an affair with House of Representatives staffer Callista Bisek, more than two decades his junior. Gingrich was having this affair even as he led the impeachment of Bill Clinton for perjury related to Clinton&#x27;s own extramarital affair. Gingrich filed for divorce from Marianne in 1999, a few months after she had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. The marriage produced no children. On January 19, 2012, Marianne alleged in an interview on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Nightline&quot; that she had declined to accept Newt&#x27;s suggestion of an open marriage. Newt disputed the account.

In August 2000, Gingrich married Callista Bisek four months after his divorce from Marianne was finalized. He and Callista live in McLean, Virginia.

In a 2011 interview with David Brody of the Christian Broadcasting Network, Gingrich addressed his past infidelities by saying, &quot;There&#x27;s no question at times in my life, partially driven by how passionately I felt about this country, that I worked too hard and things happened in my life that were not appropriate.&quot; In December 2011, after the group Iowans for Christian Leaders in Government requested that he sign their so-called &quot;Marriage Vow&quot;, Gingrich sent a lengthy written response. It included his pledge to &quot;uphold personal fidelity to my spouse&quot;.

=== Religion ===

Raised as a Lutheran, Gingrich was a Southern Baptist in graduate school. He converted to Catholicism, the faith of his third wife Callista Bisek, on March 29, 2009. He said: &quot;over the course of several years, I gradually became Catholic and then decided one day to accept the faith I had already come to embrace&quot;. He decided to officially become a Catholic when he saw Pope Benedict XVI, during the Pope&#x27;s visit to the United States in 2008: &quot;Catching a glimpse of Pope Benedict that day, I was struck by the happiness and peacefulness he exuded. The joyful and radiating presence of the Holy Father was a moment of confirmation about the many things I had been thinking and experiencing for several years.&quot; At a 2011 appearance in Columbus, Ohio, he said, &quot;In America, religious belief is being challenged by a cultural elite trying to create a secularized America, in which God is driven out of public life.&quot;

The Catholic Church recognizes his third marriage as a valid marriage, based on a declaration of nullity granted for his second marriage and the passing of his wife from his first.

=== Other interests ===
Gingrich has expressed a deep interest in animals. Gingrich&#x27;s first engagement in civic affairs was speaking to the city council in his native Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, as to why the city should establish its own zoo. He authored the introduction to &quot;America&#x27;s Best Zoos&quot; and claims to have visited more than 100.

Gingrich has shown enthusiasm towards dinosaurs. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; said of his 1995 book &quot;To Renew America&quot;: &quot;Charmingly, he has retained his enthusiasm for the extinct giants into middle age. In addition to including breakthroughs in dinosaur research on his list of futuristic wonders, he specified &#x27;people interested in dinosaurs&#x27; as a prime example of those who might benefit from his education proposals.&quot;

Space exploration has been an additional interest of Gingrich since a fascination with the United States/Soviet Union Space Race started in his teenage years. Gingrich wants the U.S. to pursue new achievements in space, including sustaining civilizations beyond Earth, but advocates relying more on the private sector and less on the publicly funded NASA to drive progress. Since 2010, he has served on the National Space Society Board of Governors.

During the 2012 election campaign, &quot;Artinfo&quot; noted that Gingrich has expressed appreciation for the work of two American painters. He has described James H. Cromartie&#x27;s painting of the U.S. Capitol as &quot;an exceptional and truly beautiful work of art&quot;; in Norman Rockwell&#x27;s work, he saw the embodiment of an America circa 1965, at odds with the prevailing sentiment of the modern day &quot;cultural elites&quot;.

CNN announced on June 26, 2013, that Gingrich would join a new version of &quot;Crossfire&quot; re-launching in fall 2013, with panelists S. E. Cupp, Stephanie Cutter, and Van Jones. Gingrich represented the right on the revamped debate program. The show was cancelled the following year.

<text>Icehouse pieces, or Icehouse Pyramids, Treehouse pieces, Treehouse Pyramids and officially Looney Pyramids, are nestable and stackable pyramid-shaped gaming pieces and a game system. The game system was invented by Andrew Looney and John Cooper in 1987, originally for use in the game of Icehouse.

==History==
Andrew Looney in 1987 penned a sci-fi short story, &quot;The Empty City&quot;, that included a game called Icehouse, an ancient Martian game. Readers requested to learn how to play the game. Thus actual rules were invented for Icehouse by Andrew Looney, Kristin Wunderlich (then future wife of Looney) and John Cooper, then plastic pyramid pieces were made to play the game. The first commercially available set were solid non-stackable pyramids released in 1989 with only 100 sets made. The pieces were made from resin in his apartment, which upset the landlord. After several years, Looney shut down Icehouse Games, Inc. and soon started another gaming company, Looney Laboratories, in 1996.

Additional games beyond Icehouse were created including Martian Chess, Zendo, and Homeworlds. Looney then created the IceTowers game which used stacking pyramids leading to a change in the pyramid pieces&#x27; specification for stacking. The four games were released as a part of , which was the first Icehouse pyramid system release by Looney Labs. In 2001, Icehouse: The Martian Chess Set won the Origins Award for &quot;Best Abstract Board Game of 2000&quot;. Icehouse was recognized as a game system in the game design textbook &quot;Rules of Play&quot; by Katue Salen and Eric Zimmerman.

By June 21, 2002, Icehouse pieces were being sold in tubes containing a stash, or 15 pyramids of a single color, with nine colors available. Labs then released the book &quot;Playing With Pyramids&quot;, which contained a dozen games by the Looneys, Cooper, Kory Heath and Jacob Davenport.

In 2004, the Zendo boxed set won &quot;Best Abstract Board Game of 2003&quot;, In 2005 the set won the Mensa Select Game Award. While in 2007, Treehouse won the Origins Award for &quot;Best Board Game of 2006&quot;.

Looney Labs relaunched the Icehouse pieces as &quot;Looney Pyramids&quot; with new packaging with its IceDice set in June 2011 followed by Pink Hijinks in December 2012. By 2013, the IcehouseGames.org website listed 400 games playable with icehouse pyramids.

Original prototype under the name of &quot;Pyramid Throwdown&quot; in 2015, &quot;Pyramid Arcade&quot; was launched as a Kickstarter campaign on April 5, 2016. The new boxed pyramid set was funded in under 12 hours. Racking up $150 thousand total, the set shipped to supporters in fall 2016. Looney Labs put their Pyramid Quartet, &quot;Nomids&quot;, &quot;Ice Duo&quot;, &quot;Martian Chess&quot; and &quot;Homeworlds&quot;, together up on Kickstarter in February 2020, which was funded in three hours.

== Description ==

The pieces are four-sided pyramids that can nest and stack with pipping from 1 to 3 at the base. A group of three pyramids, one of each size, is called a &quot;trio.&quot; Each &quot;stash&quot; or set of Icehouse pieces consists of five trios, or fifteen pyramids (variously called pieces, pyramids, or minions) of the same color and five of each three sizes: five large 3-point pyramids (called &quot;queens&quot; in some games), five medium 2-point pyramids (sometimes called &quot;drones&quot;), and five small 1-point pyramids (or &quot;pawns&quot;). The stacked and nested feature is not used in the original Icehouse game, but is taken advantage of in some of the other Icehouse-based games listed below.

Icehouse pieces were, for many years, sold as tubes containing one stash of durable crystal-look plastic pieces in one of ten available colors (though cyan was only available through their promotional program or as part of the Ice Towers set). There was also a less expensive starter set called Origami Icehouse (later called Paper Icehouse), made of cardstock in four colors, which one punched out and folded into the pyramid shapes. In 2006, Looney Labs began selling Icehouse pieces as &quot;Treehouse sets&quot;, which are multicolored sets of 15 pyramids: five colors, each color having one each of the three sizes. Looney Labs has also sold boxed sets for Zendo and IceTowers; the latter contained cyan pieces. The Icehouse website also has instructions for making your own pieces. Looney Labs has licensed Crystal Caste to make regulation-sized Icehouse pieces out of semiprecious stone. Beginning with its Looney Pyramids relaunch set, IceDice, the sets are packaged in pyramid shaped nylon zipper bag until Pyramid Arcade.

<text>The Desmostylia (from Greek δεσμά &quot;desma&quot;, &quot;bundle&quot;, and στῦλος &quot;stylos&quot;, &quot;pillar&quot;) are an extinct order of aquatic mammals native to the North Pacific from the early Oligocene (Rupelian) to the late Miocene (Tortonian) (). Desmostylians are the only known extinct order of marine mammals.

The Desmostylia, together with Sirenia and Proboscidea (and possibly Embrithopoda), have traditionally been assigned to the afrotherian clade Tethytheria, a group named after the paleoocean Tethys around which they originally evolved. The relationship between the Desmostylia and the other orders within the Tethytheria has been disputed; if the common ancestor of all tethytheres was semiaquatic, the Proboscidea became secondarily terrestrial; alternatively, the Desmostylia and Sirenia could have evolved independently into aquatic mammals. The assignment of Desmostylia to Afrotheria has always been problematic from a biogeographic standpoint, given that Africa was the locus of the early evolution of the Afrotheria while the Desmostylia have only been found along the Pacific Rim. That assignment has been seriously undermined by a 2014 cladistic analysis that places anthracobunids and desmostylians, two major groups of putative non-African afrotheres, close to each other within the laurasiatherian order Perissodactyla. However, a subsequent study shows that, while anthracobunids are definite perissodactyls, desmostylians share the same number of characteristics necessary for either Paenungulata or Perissodactyla, making their former assessment as afrotheres a possibility.

==Description==

Desmostylians were large, fully aquatic quadrupeds with massive limbs and short tails. The smallest is &quot;Ashoroa laticosta&quot;, a relatively large animal at a body length of , while the largest species reached sizes comparable to Steller&#x27;s sea cow.

A desmostylian skull has an elongated and broadened rostrum, with the nasal opening located slightly dorsally. The zygomatic arches are prominent (behind the eyes), the paroccipital processes elongated (downward-pointing processes behind the jaw-joints), and the epitympanic sinuses open into the temporal fossae (cavities above the ear holes).

The mandible and maxilla typically have forward-pointing incisors and canine tusks, followed by a long postcanine diastema, partly because of the reduced number of premolars. The cusps of the premolars and molars are composed of densely packed cylinders of thick enamel, giving the order its name (&quot;bundle of columns&quot;). The primitive dental formula is 3.1.4.3, with a trilobate fourth deciduous premolar. The cheek teeth are brachydont and bunodont in primitive genera, but hypsodont in later genera such as &quot;Desmostylus&quot;, which has many supernumerary cusps.

In the postcrania, the clavicle is absent and the sternum consists of a series of heavy, paired, plate-like sternebrae. In adults, the joints between the radius and ulna prevent any movements. The metacarpals are longer than metatarsals, and each foot has four digits (digit I is vestigial).

==Behaviour==
Their dental and skeletal forms suggest that desmostylians were aquatic herbivores dependent on littoral habitats. Their name refers to their highly distinctive molars, in which each cusp was modified into hollow columns, so a typical molar would have resembled a cluster of pipes, or in the case of worn molars, volcanoes. (This may reflect the close relationship between the Paenungulata, to which this group has been assigned, and the Tubulidentata.)

&quot;Desmostylus&quot; did not chew or eat like any other known animal. It clenched its teeth, rooted up plants with the help of tusks and powerful neck, and then sucked them in using strong throat muscles and the shape of the roof of the mouth.

Desmostylians are believed to be aquatic because of a combination of characteristics. Their legs seemed to be adapted for terrestrial locomotion, while a number of other parameters confirms their aquatic nature:
* Fossils have been found in marine strata.
* The nares are retracted and the orbits are raised like in other aquatic mammals.
* Levels of stable isotopes in their tooth enamel suggest an aquatic diet and environment (carbon and oxygen) and fresh or brackish water (strontium).
* Their spongy bone structure is similar to that of cetaceans.

Based on a comparison of trunk and limb proportions, concluded that desmostylians were more terrestrial than aquatic and clearly fore limb-dominated swimmers, hence they were more similar to &quot;sea bears&quot; than &quot;sea sloths&quot; (as proposed by other researchers.) However, a more recent and detailed analysis of desmostylian bone structure has revealed them to be fully aquatic, like sirenians and cetaceans, with their limbs being incapable of supporting their own weight on land. More recent studies vindicate this assessment, as desmostylians had a thoracic morphology more similar to sirenians and modern cetaceans than to that of semiaquatic mammals. Its less dense bone structure suggests that &quot;Desmostylus&quot; had a lifestyle of active swimming and possibly feeding at the surface, while other desmostylians were primarily slow swimmers and/or bottom walkers and sea grass feeders.

==Habitat==
A 2017 study on &quot;Desmostylus&quot; and &quot;Paleoparadoxia&quot; shows that the former preferred areas shallower than 30 m, while the latter occurred in deep, offshore waters.

==Distribution==
Desmostylian fossils are known from the northern Pacific Rim, from southern Japan through Russia, the Aleutian Islands, and the Pacific coast of North America to the southern tip of Baja California. They range from the Early Oligocene to the late Miocene.

==Extinction==
Desmostylians, being fully marine herbivores, are thought to have been outcompeted ecologically by dugongid sirenians. In particular, later species like &quot;Neoparadoxia&quot; are more specialised than previous forms, suggesting increased divergence to compete with sirenians, and sirenian diversity appears to increase with desmostylian decline. Both desmostylians and North Pacific dugongids were apparently kelp specialists, as opposed to marine herbivorous mammals from other regions, with diets primarily composed of seagrass.

==Classification==


The type species &quot;Desmostylus hesperus&quot; was originally classified from a few teeth and vertebrae as a sirenian by , but doubts arose a decade later when more complete fossils were discovered in Japan. also proposed that they belonged to the Sirenia. One of the most comprehensive collections of desmostylian teeth was amassed by paleontologist John C. Merriam, who concluded on the basis of the molar structure and repeated occurrence in marine beds that the animals had been aquatic, and were probably sirenian.

In 1926, the Austrian palaeontologist Othenio Abel suggested origins with monotremes, like the duck-billed platypus, and in 1933, he even created the order &quot;Desmostyloidea&quot;, which he placed within the Multituberculata. Abel died shortly after World War II, and his classification won few supporters and has been ignored since.

Because desmostylians were originally known only from skull fragments, teeth, and bits of other bones, general agreement was that they had had flippers and a fin-like tail. The discovery of a complete skeleton from Sakhalin Island in 1941, however, showed that they possessed four legs, with bones as stout as a hippopotamus&#x27;, and justified the creation of a new order for the desmostylians, described by .

A major find was announced in October 2015 after scientists examined an extensive group of giant, tusked, quadruped, marine mammal fossils. This northernmost to date species discovery had been unearthed during excavation for the construction of a school in Unalaska, in the Aleutian Islands. A rendition of a group was drawn by Alaskan artist Ray Troll.

Despite their similarities to manatees and elephants, desmostylians were entirely unlike any living creatures. Douglas Emlong&#x27;s 1971 discovery of the new genus &quot;Behemotops&quot; from Oregon showed that early desmostylians had more proboscidean-like teeth and jaws than later ones. Despite this discovery, their relationships to manatees and proboscids remain unresolved. The analysis of Cooper &quot;et al.&quot; (2014) indicates the similarities with manatees and elephants may be a result of convergence and that they may instead be basal perissodactyls.

<doc id="179202" wikidata="Q244997" url="?curid=179202" title="José Sarney">
<text>José Sarney de Araújo Costa (; born José Ribamar Ferreira de Araújo Costa; 24 April 1930) is a Brazilian politician, lawyer, and writer who served as 31st president of Brazil from 1985 to 1990. He briefly served as the 20th vice president of Brazil for a month between March and April 1985.

Sarney was a member of the Chamber of Deputies from 1955 until 1966 and of the Senate from 1971 until 1985. He was also the Governor of Maranhão from 1966 until 1970. During the Brazilian military dictatorship, Sarney affiliated himself with the government party, ARENA, becoming the president of the party in 1979. Sarney joined the dissenters, and was instrumental in the creation of the Liberal Front Party. 

Sarney ran for Vice-President on the ticket of Tancredo Neves of PMDB, formerly the opposition party to the military government. Neves won the presidential election, but fell ill and died before taking office, and Sarney became president. He started out his term with great popularity, but public opinion shifted with the Brazilian debt crisis and the failure of Plano Cruzado to abate chronic inflation. His government is seen today as disastrous and clientelism was widespread having longlasting consequences for the Brazilian Republic post military dictatorship.

Following his presidency, Sarney resumed his senate career elected again in 1991 and serving until 2015. He also held the position of President of the Federal Senate three times following his presidency. At age , he is the oldest living former Brazilian president, and at the time of his retirement in 2015, had one of the longest congressional careers in Brazilian history.

==Early life==
Born in Pinheiro, Maranhão, as José Ribamar Ferreira de Araújo Costa, he was the son of Sarney de Araújo Costa, a wealthy land-owner and sugarcane producer, and Kiola Ferreira. His family has origins in Viseu in Portugal. He attended Colégio Marista and the Licéu Maranhense before attending the Federal University of Maranhão. In 1953, he graduated from the federal university receiving his bachelor&#x27;s degree in law. After his graduation, he launched a postmodernist literary journal titled &quot;A Ilha&quot;.

In 1965 he legally adopted the name José Sarney de Araújo Costa, usually shortened to José Sarney, for electoral purposes. He was known as &quot;Zé do Sarney&quot;, as in &quot;José, son of Sarney&quot;. Sarney&#x27;s father acquired the name after being born on a land owned by an Englishman named &quot;Sir Ney&quot;.

==Political career==
===Early activities===
Sarney started his political career in the 1950s after becoming a replacement deputy and later as a federal deputy in 1955. He was a member of the centre-right National Democratic Union (União Democrática Nacional—UDN), aligned with the progressive wing of the party. He strongly supported so-called &quot;Revolution of 1964&quot;, a military coup that overthrew leftist President João Goulart in 1964. After the military coup, Sarney followed most of the UDN into the National Renewal Alliance (ARENA), the political party of the military government. He was elected governor of the state of Maranhão in 1966, serving until 1971. He was then elected to the Brazilian Senate and became ARENA&#x27;s president.

===Vice presidency===
Despite his support for the government&#x27;s heavy-handed measures against dissent, Sarney had never been quite accepted by the military establishment, which tried to block his career. In 1979 ARENA reorganized as the Democratic Social Party (PDS), and Sarney remained the party&#x27;s president. In 1984, the junta was under pressure due to popular protests to reinstate direct elections for president (Diretas Já movement). PDS was divided but launched Paulo Maluf as its candidate for the presidency in indirect elections.

Sarney disagreed with this decision and left PDS to form the Liberal Front Party, which then allied with the PMDB. As part of the deal, Sarney became Tancredo Neves&#x27; running mate on the opposition ticket. Neves won the election of 15 January 1985, but became gravely ill the night before his inauguration. Sarney assumed office as vice-president and acting president until Neves died on 21 April, and he formally became the first civilian president in 21 years.

===Presidency===

His succession raised some question because as Neves could not attend the inauguration ceremony on 15 March, several politicians contended at the time that Sarney should not have been inaugurated as vice-president and allowed to become acting president. They believed that Sarney had been elected vice-president only by virtue of the election of his running mate as president. Each member of the Electoral College cast one vote, for president, and the choice of president carried with it the automatic selection of the ticket&#x27;s running mate as vice-president, Sarney could take office only as vice-president together with Neves. Some critics argued that in the event of the head of the presidential ticket not being able to assume office, the presidential powers and duties should pass to the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Ulysses Guimarães.
There was some partisanship in this line of thought since both Neves and Guimarães were members of the same party, and Sarney was not. He had been a supporter of the military, and only recently had joined the coalition to defeat the military&#x27;s candidate in the electoral college. The challenge to Sarney&#x27;s inauguration was short-lived, however, because in the early hours of inauguration day, Guimarães himself stated that he believed that Sarney had the right to be inaugurated even without Neves, as the role of the vice-president was precisely that of replacing the president when needed.

Sarney and the president of Argentina, Raúl Alfonsín, started the process of creating a common market between the two nations in 1985. As first steps, they agreed to subsidize regional trade with a special currency for the purpose (the Gaucho). The agreement led to the formation of the Mercosur in 1991. He also oversaw constitutional amendments that purged the remaining vestiges of authoritarianism from the 1967/1969 Constitution.

Sarney faced many problems: enormous foreign debt, rampant inflation and corruption as well as the transition to democracy. During his presidency, the country had a 934% inflation rate and was overshadowed with union strikes and corruption scandals. Sarney launched an economic plan to stabilize the economy, called &quot;Plano Cruzado&quot;, successful at first. The inflation worsened however under Sarney&#x27;s Plano Cruzado. A new, fully democratic constitution was promulgated in 1988, and in the following year, the first direct elections since 1960 were held. Sarney was barred from running for president in his own right in that election. In Brazil, whenever the vice president ascends as president, it counts as a full term. At the time, Brazilian presidents were barred from immediate re-election.

===Post-presidency===

Sarney supported Fernando Henrique Cardoso as presidential candidate in 1994 and 1998 and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in 2002. He returned to the Senate after his presidency, this time representing Amapá, and served as President of the Senate from 1995 to 1997, 2003 to 2005, 2009 to 2011, and 2011 to 2013. He retired from politics in 2015 and was the longest-serving member of the Brazilian Congress at the time of his retirement. His retirement was noted by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as a &quot;decline of a political dynasty&quot; which would cause a political shift in the country. All told, he spent all but 23 months in elected office from his first election as deputy in 1955 until his retirement from the Senate in 2015.

Sarney is regarded as the foremost of Brazil&#x27;s oligarchs. Sarney owns the most important newspapers and television stations in Maranhão. Sarney has also faced multiple allegations of nepotism and corruption in his career. In 2009, the British weekly &quot;The Economist&quot; called his election as President of the Senate &quot;a victory for semi-feudalism&quot; and &quot;a throwback to an era of semi-feudal politics that still prevails in corners of Brazil and holds the rest of it back.&quot; &quot;Veja&quot; columnist Roberto Pompeu de Toledo deemed him &quot;the perfect oligarch&quot;.

Sérgio Machado, former president of Transpetro, said in his plea agreement within the Operation Car Wash that Sarney received R$18.5 million of the bribe money from a Petrobras subsidiary, in the PMDB account during the period in which he directed the company (2003–2015).

===Electoral history===




==Personal life==

In 1952, Sarney married Marly Macieira. Their children are Congressman José Sarney Filho, Governor Roseana Sarney, and the businessman Fernando Sarney.

As a writer, his best known work is the poetry book &quot;Os Marimbondos de Fogo&quot; (&quot;The Fire Wasps&quot;). Sarney was elected to a chair in the Brazilian Academy of Letters in 1980.

In April 2012, Sarney was hospitalized and underwent an angioplasty. In July 2021, he was hospitalized for pleural effusion and had a procedure to remove fluid from his lungs.

In July 2023, Sarney was hospitalized after a fall and was diagnosed with cerebral ischemia.

<doc id="179204" wikidata="Q320353" url="?curid=179204" title="Norma (opera)">
<text>Norma () is a &quot;tragedia lirica&quot; or opera in two acts by Vincenzo Bellini with libretto by Felice Romani after the play &quot;Norma, ou L&#x27;infanticide&quot; (&quot;Norma, or The Infanticide&quot;) by Alexandre Soumet. It was first produced at La Scala in Milan on 26 December 1831.

The opera is regarded as a leading example of the bel canto genre, and the soprano prayer &quot;Casta diva&quot; in Act 1 is a famous piece. Among the well known singers of Norma of the first half of the 20th century was Rosa Ponselle who played the role in New York and London. Notable exponents of the title role in the post-war period have been Maria Callas, Leyla Gencer, Joan Sutherland, and Montserrat Caballé.

== Composition history ==
Crivelli and Company were managing both La Scala and La Fenice in Venice, and as a result, in April–May 1830 Bellini was able to negotiate a contract with them for two operas, one at each theatre. The opera for December 1831 at La Scala became &quot;Norma&quot;, while the one for the 1832 Carnival season at La Fenice became &quot;Beatrice di Tenda&quot;.

With Bellini&#x27;s &quot;La sonnambula&quot; successfully staged in March 1831 and Giuditta Pasta having demonstrated her extensive vocal and dramatic ranges in creating the role of Amina, the Swiss village maiden, she had been engaged by La Scala for her debut during the following season. Bellini and Romani then began to consider the subject of the coming autumn&#x27;s opera. By the summer, they had decided to base it on Alexandre Soumet&#x27;s play which was being performed in Paris at around that time and which Pasta would have seen.

For the forthcoming autumn/winter season, La Scala had engaged Giulia Grisi (the sister of Giuditta Grisi) and the well-known tenor Domenico Donzelli, who had made a name for himself with Rossini roles, especially that of Otello. They would fill the roles of Adalgisa and Pollione. Donzelli provided Bellini with precise details of his vocal capabilities which were confirmed by a report which the Neapolitan composer Saverio Mercadante also provided. By the end of August it appears that Romani had completed a considerable amount of the libretto, enough at least to allow Bellini to begin work, which he certainly did in the first weeks of September as the verses were supplied. He reported in a letter to Pasta on 1 September:

I hope that you will find this subject to your liking. Romani believes it to be very effective, and precisely because of the all-inclusive character for you, which is that of Norma. He will manipulate the situations so that they will not resemble other subjects at all, and he will retouch, even change, the characters to produce more effect, if need be.

&quot;Norma&quot; was completed by about the end of November. While, for Romani, it became &quot;the most beautiful rose in the garland&quot; of all his work with Bellini, it was not achieved without some struggles. Bellini, now at the height of his powers, was very demanding of his librettist and required many re-writes before he was satisfied enough to set it to music.

== Performance history ==

=== Premiere performances ===
After rehearsals began on 5 December, Pasta balked at singing the &quot;Casta diva&quot; in act 1, now one of the most famous arias of the nineteenth century. She felt that it was &quot;ill adapted to her vocal abilities&quot;, but Bellini was able to persuade her to keep trying for a week, after which she adapted to it and confessed her earlier error. At the opening night, the opera was received with what Weinstock describes as &quot;chill indifference&quot;. To his friend Francesco Florimo, on the night of the premiere, Bellini wrote &quot;Fiasco! Fiasco! Solemn fiasco!&quot; and proceeded to tell him of the indifference of the audience and how it affected him.

In addition, in a letter to his uncle on 28 December, Bellini tried to explain the reasons for the reactions. As other commentators have also noted, some problems were innate to the structure and content of the opera, while others were external to it. Bellini discusses the tiredness of the singers (after rehearsing the entire second act on the day of the premiere) as well as noting how certain numbers failed to please—and failed to please the composer as well! But then he explains that most of the second act was very effective. It appears from the letter that the second evening&#x27;s performance was more successful and Weinstock reports it was from this performance forward that it &quot;was recognised as a successful and important opera&quot; with 208 performances given at La Scala alone by the end of the 19th century.

Among the external reasons, Bellini cited the adverse reaction caused by &quot;hostile factions in the audience&quot; consisting of both the owner of a journal (and his claque) and also of &quot;a very rich woman&quot;, who is identified by Weinstock as Contessa Giulia Samoyloff, the mistress of the composer Giovanni Pacini. On Bellini&#x27;s part, there had long been a feeling of rivalry with Pacini ever since the failure of his own &quot;Zaira&quot; in Parma and his return to Milan in June 1829. With no firm contract for a new opera for Bellini, Pacini&#x27;s success with his &quot;Il Talismano&quot; at La Scala—where it received 16 performances—fueled this rivalry, at least in Bellini&#x27;s head. It was only when he staged a triumphant revival of his own with &quot;Il pirata&quot; with the original cast that he felt vindicated. &quot;Pirata&quot; received 24 consecutive performances between 16 July and 23 August 1829, thus outnumbering those for Pacini&#x27;s opera. 

However, Bellini also noted that on the second performance evening of &quot;Norma&quot;, the theatre was full.
In all, &quot;Norma&quot; was given 34 performances in its first season at La Scala, and reports from elsewhere, especially those from Bergamo, when it was staged in late 1832, suggested that it was becoming more and more popular. Between 1831 and 1850 Weinstock provides details of the dozens of performances given in numerous cities outside of Italy, and then he gives details of those beyond.

Bellini left Milan for Naples, and then Sicily, on 5 January 1832 and, for the first time since 1827, 1832 became a year in which he did not write an opera. &quot;Norma&quot; quickly &quot;[conquered] the whole of Europe in the space of a few years&quot;.

=== Later revivals ===
Richard Wagner conducted &quot;Norma&quot; at Riga in 1837. Following the common nineteenth-century practice of adding interpolated arias, he wrote an aria for the bass and men&#x27;s chorus for this production. However, that aria has not entered the general repertoire. Wagner wrote at the time that &quot;Norma&quot; was &quot;indisputably Bellini&#x27;s most successful composition&quot;. &quot;In this opera, Bellini has undoubtedly risen to the greatest heights of his talent. In these days of romantic extravaganzas and the hyper-excitement of the so-called musical attractions he presents a phenomenon which can hardly be overrated. The action, free from all theatrical coups and dazzling effects, reminds one instinctively of a Greek tragedy. Perhaps the views expressed by Schiller in his &#x27;Bride of Messina&#x27; to the effect that he had hopes for the full revival of the tragedy of the ancients upon our stage, in the form of the opera, will receive new justification in this &quot;Norma&quot;! Let anyone name me a spiritual painting of its kind, more fully carried out, than that of this wild Gaelic prophetess...Every emotional moment stands out plastically; nothing has been vaguely swept together...&quot;

Wagner also praised Romani&#x27;s libretto:

Here, where the poem rises to the tragic height of the ancient Greeks, this kind of form, which Bellini has certainly ennobled, serves only to increase the solemn and imposing character of the whole; all the phases of passion, which are rendered in so peculiarly clear a light by his art of song, are thereby made to rest upon a majestic soil and ground, above which they do not vaguely flutter about, but resolve themselves into a grand and manifest picture, which involuntarily calls to mind the creations of Gluck and Spontini.

The opera was given its British premiere in London on 20 June 1833 and its US premiere at the St. Charles Theatre in New Orleans on 1 April 1836. In the late 1840s and during the Risorgimento era, some of the music was used in demonstrations of nationalistic fervour, one such example being the 1848 celebration of the liberation of Sicily from the rule of the Bourbons held in the cathedral in Palermo. There, the &quot;Guerra, guerra&quot; (War, war!) chorus from act 2 was sung. &quot;Norma&quot; received its first performance at the Metropolitan Opera in New York on 27 February 1890 with Lilli Lehmann singing the title role in German.

=== Modern times ===
The Metropolitan Opera revived &quot;Norma&quot; in 1927 (the first performance of the opera there since 1892) with  Rosa Ponselle in the title role.

During the later 20th century, with the bel canto revival, the most prolific Norma was the Greek-American soprano Maria Callas, who gave 89 stage performances (several of which exist on live recordings as well as two on studio versions made in 1954 and 1960). Callas&#x27;s first appearances in the role began at the Teatro Comunale di Firenze in November/December 1948 followed by the second at the Teatro Colón, Buenos Aires in June 1949, both of which were conducted by Tullio Serafin. The following year, she appeared in the role at La Fenice in Venice in January 1950, this time under Antonino Votto, and in Mexico in May 1950 conducted by Guido Picco. In London in 1952, Callas sang Norma at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in November (where the role of Clotilde was sung by Joan Sutherland); she made her American debut singing the role at the Lyric Opera of Chicago in November 1954 under Nicola Rescigno; and then she appeared at the Metropolitan Opera in New York under Fausto Cleva in October/November 1956. In 1960, she performed Norma in the Ancient Theatre of Epidaurus in Greece with the collaboration of the Greek National Opera, in the production of Alexis Minotis.

== Singers in the title role ==
The title role—&quot;one of the most taxing and wide-ranging parts in the entire repertory&quot;—is one of the most difficult in the soprano repertoire. It calls for great vocal control of range, flexibility, and dynamics as well as containing a wide range of emotions: conflict of personal and public life, romantic life, maternal love, friendship, jealousy, murderous intent, and resignation. The German soprano Lilli Lehmann once remarked that the singing of all three Brünnhilde roles of Wagner&#x27;s opera cycle &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; in one evening would be less stressful than the singing of one Norma. She also commented &quot;When you sing Wagner, you are so carried away by the dramatic emotion, the action, and the scene that you do not have to think how to sing the words. That comes of itself. But in Bellini, you must always have a care for beauty of tone and correct emission.&quot; According to the Met Opera Archives, Lehmann said this to &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; critic Henry Krehbiel.

Throughout the 20th century, many singers have tackled the role of Norma. In the early 1920s, it was Rosa Raisa, Claudia Muzio, and Rosa Ponselle who were each admired. Maria Callas emerged as a major force in the role in the post-World War II period. She made two studio recordings of the opera for EMI/HMV, and several broadcasts of her live performances have been preserved from the early 1950s through her final performances of the role in Paris in May 1965.

In the 1960s, two very different performers sang the role: the Australian Dame Joan Sutherland and the Turkish Leyla Gencer. Following Sutherland&#x27;s 1963 debut as Norma, Luciano Pavarotti called her &quot;the greatest female voice of all time.&quot;

The Dutch coloratura Cristina Deutekom tackled the role in 1970. Throughout the decade, four other bel canto specialists debuted their Normas: Radmila Bakočević, Montserrat Caballé, Beverly Sills, and Renata Scotto. Also singing Norma during this period were Grace Bumbry and Shirley Verrett, the American divas who began as mezzo-sopranos and eventually started singing soprano repertoire.

During the 1980s and 1990s, the role of Norma was performed by such diverse singers as Katia Ricciarelli, Anna Tomowa-Sintow, Marisa Galvany, Dame Gwyneth Jones, and Jane Eaglen. Other Normas include Hasmik Papian, Fiorenza Cedolins, Galina Gorchakova, Maria Guleghina, Nelly Miricioiu, June Anderson, Edita Gruberová and Carmela Remigio (who performs more frequently the role of Adalgisa).

In 2008, Daniela Dessì performed as Norma at Teatro Comunale di Bologna. In 2010 (in Dortmund) and 2013 (at the Salzburg Festival) the role was taken by mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli: this version was also recorded with coloratura soprano Sumi Jo as Adalgisa. In 2011, Sondra Radvanovsky also added the role to her repertory, one to which she returned in the autumn 2014 at the San Francisco Opera and in the autumn of 2017 at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. On 13 April 2013, the Italian &quot;bel canto&quot; soprano, Mariella Devia, after a career of 40 years and one day after turning 65, successfully made her debut as Norma at the Teatro Comunale di Bologna.Angela Meade has played the role often, including in 2013 and 2017 at the Metropolitan Opera in New York.

== Summary ==
The action takes place in Gaul under the Roman occupation, and is centered on the love triangle between Pollione, the Roman proconsul of Gaul, Norma, his former companion, and the young Adalgisa. The background is the uprising of the Gallic people against the Roman occupiers, led by the Druid Oroveso.

Norma, the high priestess of the Druid temple, who had two children by Pollione, the Roman proconsul of Gaul, breaking her Druid chastity vows, discovers that her lover is now in love with her friend, the young Druid priestess Adalgisa. Norma tries to convince Pollione to give up Adalgisa and return to her, but he refuses. Norma publicly confesses her fault and is sentenced to death by fire. Pollione is moved by Norma&#x27;s self-sacrifice and joins her at the stake.

:Place: Gaul
:Time: c. 100-50 BC (Roman occupation)

=== Act 1 ===
* Sinfonia

==== &quot;Scene 1: The grove of the druids&quot; ====

Oroveso leads the druids in a procession in the forest to pray for victory against the invading Romans: (Oroveso and druids: &quot;Ite sul colle, o druidi&quot; / &quot;Go into the hills, Druids&quot;). The druids pray that Norma will come and have the courage to broker peace with the Romans: (Druids and Oroveso: &quot;Dell&#x27;aura tua profetica&quot; / &quot;With thy prophetic aura, imbue her, O terrible God&quot;.) All leave to go to the temple.

Pollione and Flavio enter. Although Norma has secretly broken her vows in order to love him and has borne him two children, Pollione tells Flavio that he no longer loves Norma, having fallen in love with the priestess Adalgisa. But he expresses some remorse, describing his dream in which Adalgisa was beside him at the altar of Venus and a huge storm arose: (Pollione, aria: &quot;Meco all&#x27;altar di Venere&quot; / &quot;With me at the altar in Rome was Adalgisa dressed in white, veiled all in white.&quot;) The storm presaged disaster for both Norma and himself: &quot;Thus does Norma punish her faithless lover,&quot; he declares. They hear the trumpets sounding to announce Norma&#x27;s arrival. Flavio urges his friend to leave, but Pollione stands firm, proclaiming that he will confront Norma and the druids with a superior power and overthrow their altars: (Cabaletta: &quot;Me protegge, me difende&quot; / &quot;I am protected and defended&quot;)
As Norma leads the druids and priestesses, the crowd proclaims: &quot;Norma viene&quot; / &quot;Norma is coming&quot; and, as Oroveso awaits her, they describe her dress and manner. All kneel as she approaches. &quot;The time is not ripe for our revenge&quot;, she declares, stating that Rome will perish one day by being worn down. Then, with the mistletoe in hand, she approaches the altar with a plea to the moon (the &quot;Chaste Goddess&quot;): (cavatina: &quot;Casta diva&quot; / &quot;Chaste goddess&quot;). She pleads that the goddess shed upon earth the peace that she has created in heaven. She calls for all to complete the rites and then clear the uninitiated from the grove. To herself, she declares that she cannot hurt Pollione, but desires that things return to where they used to be: (Cabaletta: &quot;Ah! bello a me ritorna&quot; / &quot;Return to me, O beautiful one&quot;). The assembled crowd accepts her cautious approach, and all leave the grove.

&quot;Later that night: The Temple of Irminsul in the grove&quot;

Adalgisa prays at the temple, remembering with some sorrow how she became involved with Pollione. He enters, telling her that she prays to a cruel god and is not trying to invoke the god of love. As she appears to reject him, he declares (Aria: &quot;Va crudele&quot; /&quot;Go, O cruel one&quot;) but he is convinced that he cannot leave her. He is distraught, and she doesn&#x27;t show she is equally torn, until the moment he declares that he must return to Rome the following day. He begs Adalgisa to go with him: (Duet: Pollione, then Adalgisa, then together: &quot;Vieni in Roma&quot; / &quot;Come to Rome&quot;). She resists him, but finally agrees that they will leave together the following day.

==== &quot;Scene 2: Norma&#x27;s dwelling&quot; ====

Norma appears to be upset and orders her maid, Clotilde, to take the two children away from her, expressing very ambivalent feelings about them. She tells Clotilde that Pollione has been recalled to Rome, but does not know if he will take her or how he feels about leaving his children. As Adalgisa approaches, the children are taken away.

Adalgisa tells Norma she has fallen in love with a Roman, whom she does not name. As she describes how she fell in love while waiting at the temple and seeing &quot;his handsome face&quot; appear, Norma recalls (as an aside) her own feelings for Pollione (&quot;my passions, too, burned like this&quot;), and more and more, their experiences of falling in love run parallel: (Norma and Adalgisa, duet: &quot;Sola, furtiva al tempio&quot; / &quot;Often I would wait for him&quot;). Adalgisa pleads for help and forgiveness, and Norma pledges that she will do that and will also free her from her vows as a priestess: (Norma: &quot;Ah! sì, fa core, abbracciami&quot; / &quot;Yes, take heart, embrace me&quot;. Adalgisa: &quot;Ripeti, o ciel, ripetimi&quot; / &quot;Say that again, heavens, say again&quot;)

Norma asks Adalgisa to describe the man whom she loves. Responding, she tells her that he is a Roman, and, at that moment, turns to indicate that it is Pollione who is just then entering the room. As Norma furiously turns to confront Pollione, Adalgisa is confused: Norma: &quot;Oh! non tremare, o perfido&quot; / &quot;O faithless man, do not tremble&quot;.

Forcing the priestess to realise that she is the victim of a huge deception, Norma addresses Adalgisa. (Trio: each sings in succession, beginning with Norma: &quot;Oh! di qual sei tu vittima&quot; / &quot;Oh, you are the victim&quot;; then Adalgisa: &quot;Oh! qual traspare orribile&quot; / &quot;What horror has been revealed&quot;; then the two women together, followed by Pollione alone: &quot;Norma! de&#x27; tuoi rimproveri&quot; / &quot;Norma, do not reproach me now&quot;, continuing with &quot;Please give this wretched girl some respite&quot;; after which all three repeat their words, singing at first individually, then together.)

There are angry exchanges among the three: Norma declaring Pollione to be a traitor, he trying to persuade Adalgisa to leave with him, and Adalgisa angrily telling him to go away. When he declares that it is his fate to leave Norma, she encourages the young priestess to go with him, but Adalgisa declares that she would rather die. Norma then demands that her lover go, leaving behind his children — and his honor. (Finale: brief duet, Adalgisa and Pollione: he declares his love, and she her desire for Norma not to be a source of guilt to her. Trio: Norma continues to rage at Pollione, Adalgisa repeats her desire to make him return to Norma, and Pollione curses the day when he met Norma.) Then the sound of the druids calling Norma to the temple is heard. They report that the angry god, Irminsul, has spoken. Pollione storms out.

=== Act 2 ===
* &quot;Orchestral introduction&quot;

==== &quot;Scene 1: Norma&#x27;s dwelling&quot; ====
Norma looks at both of her sons, who are asleep. She considers killing them. Advancing towards them with knife upraised, she hesitates. (Recitative: &quot;Dormono entrambi ... non vedran la mano che li percuote&quot; / &quot;They are both asleep ... they shall not see the hand which strikes them.&quot;) But she cannot bring herself to do it: (Aria: &quot;Teneri, teneri figli&quot; / &quot;My dear, dear sons&quot;) The children wake up and she calls for Clotilde, demanding that Adalgisa be brought to her.

The young priestess enters, concerned at how pale Norma looks. Norma makes her swear to do everything she asks and, upon her agreement, tells her that she is entrusting the two children to her care and states that they should be taken to the Roman camp to their father Pollione, a man who she hopes will make a better lover for Adalgisa than he was for her. Adalgisa is aghast. Norma: &quot;I beg you for his children&#x27;s sake.&quot; (Duet, first Norma: &quot;Deh! con te, con te li prendi&quot; / &quot;Please, take them with you&quot;) Adalgisa tells her that she will never leave Gaul and only agreed to the request in order to do what was good for Norma. (Duet, Adalgisa: &quot;Vado al campo&quot;/&quot;I&#x27;ll go to the camp&quot;) In the duet, Adalgisa agrees to go to the Roman camp and tell Pollione of Norma&#x27;s grief; her hope is to persuade him to return to Norma. She then renounces Pollione: (Duet: &quot;Mira, o Norma&quot; / &quot;Look, o Norma&quot;) They sing together, each expressing her own thoughts and feelings until Norma realizes that Adalgisa will give up Pollione and remain with her: (Cabaletta; Duet, Norma and Adalgisa: &quot;Si fino all&#x27;ore estreme&quot; / &quot;Until the last hour&quot;)

==== &quot;Scene 2: The grove&quot; ====
The druid warriors gather and prepare themselves to attack the Romans. Oroveso enters with news from the gods: the time has not arrived to strike. Somewhat frustrated, the soldiers accept the decision.

==== &quot;Scene 3: The temple of Irminsul&quot; ====
Norma enters. (Recitative: &quot;Ei tornerà&quot; / &quot;He will come back&quot;) Then Clotilde arrives with news that Adalgisa has failed to persuade Pollione to return. Although Norma questions whether she should have trusted her, she then learns from her servant that Adalgisa is returning and wishes to take her vows at the altar and that the Roman has sworn to abduct her from the temple. In anger, Norma strikes a gong-like shield as a summons to war. Trumpets sound and Oroveso and the druids all rush in, demanding to know what is happening. They hear Norma&#x27;s answer and the soldiers take up the refrain: &quot;Guerra, guerra!&quot; / &quot;War, war!&quot;, while Norma proclaims &quot;Blood, blood! Revenge!&quot;

In order for Norma to complete the rites to authorise going to war, Oroveso demands to know who will be the sacrificial victim. At that moment, Clotilde rushes in to announce that a Roman has desecrated the temple, but that he has been apprehended. It is Pollione who is led in, and Norma is urged to take the sacrificial knife to stab him but, approaching him, she is unable to perform the deed. The assembled crowd demands to know why, but she dismisses them, stating that she needs to question her victim.

The crowd departs: (Duet, Norma and Pollione: &quot;In mia man alfin tu sei&quot; / &quot;At last you are in my hands&quot;). Norma demands that he forever shun Adalgisa; only then will she release him and never see him again. He refuses, and she vents her anger by telling him that she will then kill her children. &quot;Strike me instead&quot;, he demands, &quot;so that only I alone will die&quot;, but she quickly asserts that not only will all the Romans die, but so will Adalgisa, who has broken her vows as a priestess. This prompts him to plead for her life. (Cabaletta: Norma and Pollione: &quot;Già mi pasco ne&#x27; tuoi sguardi&quot; / &quot;Already I take pleasure in the looks you give me&quot;.) When Pollione demands the knife, she calls the priests to assemble. Norma announces that it would be better to sacrifice a priestess who has broken her vows, and orders the pyre to be lit. Oroveso demands to know who is to be sacrificed while Pollione begs that she stays silent. Norma then wonders if she is not in fact the guilty one, then reveals that it is she who is to be the victim: a high priestess who has broken her vows, has become involved with the enemy, and has borne his children. (Aria, Norma to Pollione: &quot;Qual cor tradisti&quot; / &quot;The heart you betrayed&quot;; Duet: Norma and Pollione; ensemble, Norma, Oroveso, Pollione, druids, priests: each expresses his/her sorrow, anger, pleas to Norma, with Oroveso learning for the first time that Norma is a mother.)

In the concerted finale, Norma pleads with Oroveso to spare her children, reminding her father that they are of his own blood. (&quot;Deh! non volerli vittime&quot; / &quot;Please don&#x27;t make them victims&quot;). After he promises to take care of them, she prepares to leap into the flames, and the re-enamoured Pollione joins her, declaring &quot;your pyre is mine as well. There, a holier and everlasting love will begin&quot;.

== Music ==

It was Giuseppe Verdi who—late in his life—made some perceptive comments in a letter of May 1898 to , who had recently published a book on Bellini. In the letter, Verdi states:

Bellini is poor, it is true, in harmony and instrumentation; but rich in feeling and in an individual melancholy of his own! Even in the least well-known of his operas, in &quot;La straniera&quot;, in &quot;Il pirata&quot;, there are long, long, long melodies such as no-one before him had produced. And what truth and power of declamation, as for example in the duet between Pollione and Norma! [See act 2, scene 3 above. Norma: &quot;In mia man alfin tu sei&quot; / &quot;At last you are in my hands&quot;] And what elation of thought in the first phrase of the introduction [to the duet] ... no-one ever has created another more beautiful and heavenly.

Commenting on the overall quality of the music in &quot;Norma&quot;, David Kimbell states that &quot;Bellini&#x27;s most astonishing achievement in &quot;Norma&quot; is, amid all the more obvious excitements of musical Romanticism, to have asserted his belief that the true magic of opera depended on a kind of incantation in which dramatic poetry and song are perfectly fused.&quot; Additionally, Kimbell provides examples of how the composer&#x27;s art is revealed in this opera, but also noting that the ability to achieve a &quot;fusion of music and dramatic meaning is to be found elsewhere in Bellini&#x27;s work&quot;.

==Schopenhauer&#x27;s praise==
Schopenhauer claimed that tragedy causes the spectator to lose the will to live. &quot;The horrors on the stage hold up to him the bitterness and worthlessness of life, and so the vanity of all its efforts and endeavors. The effect of this impression must be that he becomes aware, although only in an obscure feeling, that it is better to tear his heart away from life, to turn his willing away from it, not to love the world and life.&quot; He praised &quot;Norma&quot; for its artistic excellence in producing this effect. &quot;…[T]he genuinely tragic effect of the catastrophe, the hero&#x27;s resignation and spiritual exaltation produced by it, seldom appear so purely motivated and distinctly expressed as in the opera &quot;Norma&quot;, where it comes in the duet &quot;Qual cor tradisti, qual cor perdesti&quot; [What a heart you betrayed, what a heart you lost]. Here the conversion of the will is clearly indicated by the quietness suddenly introduced into the music. Quite apart from its excellent music, and from the diction that can only be that of a libretto, and considered only according to its motives and to its interior economy, this piece is in general a tragedy of extreme perfection, a true model of the tragic disposition of the motives, of the tragic progress of the action, and of tragic development, together with the effect of these on the frame of mind of the heroes, which surmounts the world. This effect then passes on to the spectator.&quot;

==Ibsen parody==
&quot;Norma, or A Politician&#x27;s Love&quot; (Norwegian: &quot;Norma eller En Politikers Kjærlighed&quot;) is an eight-page drama written as an opera parody by Henrik Ibsen. It is influenced by Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Norma&quot;, which Ibsen saw in 1851, but the characters are contemporary politicians. The play was first printed anonymously in the satirical magazine &quot;Andhrimner&quot; in 1851. The first book edition came in 1909, and the first performance of the play was at a student theatre in Trondheim 1994.

==Marion Zimmer Bradley==
Writer Marion Zimmer Bradley acknowledged that the plot of her 1993 historical novel/fantasy book &quot;The Forest House&quot; was based on that of &quot;Norma&quot; – relocated from Gaul to Britain, but sharing the basic plot outline of a love affair between a druidic priestess and a Roman officer. Bradley further stated that, in homage to Bellini, the hymns in chapter five and twenty-two of her book are adapted from the libretto of the opera&#x27;s act 1, scene 1, and those in chapter thirty from act 2, scene 2.

<text>Disembowelment, disemboweling, evisceration, eviscerating or gutting is the removal of organs from the gastrointestinal tract (bowels or viscera), usually through an incision made across the abdominal area. Disembowelment is a standard routine operation during animal slaughter. In ancient Rome, disembowelment of animals was practiced for divination, and was known as haruspicy. Disembowelment of humans may result from an accident, but has also been used as a method of torture, execution, or suicide. In such practices, disembowelment may be accompanied by various forms of torture or the removal of other vital organs.

==Dressing of animals==
The removal of internal organs is a typical operation in meat processing also known as dressing. Land animals and birds are typically killed and bled before the dressing. The process of dressing includes the removal of heart, liver and lungs (pluck) as well as disembowelment by an abdominal cut. Disembowelment is typically accompanied by bung dropping or bunging. Bung dropping is the circumcision of the rectum from the carcass and is the first step of the gutting. Puncturing of bowels are avoided during the evisceration. Otherwise, bacteria from the intestinal contents might spread over the carcass. In case of birds, the abdominal cut extends up to the cloaca separating it from the rest of the skin. 

===Industrial dressing line===
A bung dropper is a device used in slaughterhouses for fast bung dropping in a dressing line. The probe of a bung dropper is inserted into the rectum to loosen it from the carcass by circumcising with a sharp rotating cylinder. Belly opener is a device for performing the abdominal cut.

==Mummification and embalming==
Some types of animal mummification include evisceration. The process of embalming sometimes includes removing the internal organs. Mummification, especially as practiced by the ancient Egyptians, entailed the removal of internal organs prior to the preservation of the remainder of the body. The removed organs were embalmed, stored in canopic jars and then placed in the tomb with the body.

James Cook, on his second voyage, noted an embalming custom on some of the Pacific islands his crew visited, a custom utilizing transanal evisceration:

==Transanal evisceration of humans==
When a portion of the intestinal tract is forcefully pulled from or expelled from the body through the anus, it is referred to as &quot;transanal evisceration&quot;. Following the first report of transanal evisceration by Brodie in 1827, more than 70 cases have been reported to date, the majority occurring spontaneously in elderly individuals. Straining, chronic constipation, and rectal ulcerations predispose to spontaneous perforation in elderly individuals.

Cases of transanal evisceration of children whilst sitting over uncovered swimming pool drains have been reported; notable cases include Valerie Lakey (1993) and Abigail Taylor (2007). In Taylor&#x27;s case, the suction dislodged and damaged her liver and pancreas; several meters of her small intestine were forcefully pulled through her anus. In both these cases, the victims were left with short bowel syndrome and required feeding by total parenteral nutrition. After multiple operations, Taylor later died from transplant-related cancer.

A person, usually a child, can suffer a similar injury if a heavy weight is applied directly over the abdomen. Large intestine (rectosigmoid) rupture with transanal evisceration has been reported from blunt abdominal trauma and suction injuries. A direct blow or impingement of intestine between the vertebrae and anterior abdominal wall results in sudden increase in the intra-abdominal or intraluminal pressure of the intestine and rupture. The downward pressure forces a portion of the intestine to burst from the anus.

==Disembowelment of humans as torture==
If a living person is disemboweled, it is invariably fatal without major medical intervention. Historically, disembowelment has been used as a severe form of capital punishment. If the intestinal tract alone is removed, death follows after several hours of gruesome pain. The victim will often be fully conscious while the torture is performed if the vital organs aren&#x27;t damaged, and will be able to see their intestine being removed, but will eventually lose consciousness due to blood loss. However, in some forms of intentional disembowelment, decapitation or the removal of the heart and lungs would hasten the victim&#x27;s death.

===Asia===
====Vietnam====
Various accounts have asserted that during the Vietnam War, members of the Viet Cong sometimes made calculated use of disembowelment as a means of psychological warfare, to coerce and intimidate rural peasants. Peer De Silva, former head of the Saigon department of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), wrote that from as early as 1963, Viet Cong units were using disembowelment and other methods of mutilation as psychological warfare. The extent, however, to which this punishment was perpetrated may be impossible to gauge and while detailed accounts survive regarding how civilians were disemboweled by Viet Cong, the use of this torture appears to have been quite arbitrary and there is no record that such actions were sanctioned by the North Vietnamese government in Hanoi. Disembowelment and other methods of intimidation and torture were intended to frighten civilian peasants at a local level into cooperating with the Viet Cong or discourage them from cooperating with the South Vietnamese Army or its allies.

===Europe===

====Romania====
In early 1941, during the Bucharest pogrom in which 125 Jewish civilians were killed, multiple cases of torture including disembowelment were recorded.

====Netherlands====
On 10 July 1584, Balthasar Gérard shot and killed William of Orange, who had advocated for Dutch independence from the King of Spain. The assassin was interrogated and condemned to death almost immediately. On 14 July, after suffering various tortures during each of the five days since the assassination, Gérard was disemboweled and dismembered while still alive, after which his heart was torn out and then he was beheaded by his Dutch executioners.

====Roman Empire====

Christian tradition states that Erasmus of Formiae, also known as Saint Elmo, was finally executed by disembowelment in about A.D. 303, after he had suffered extreme forms of torture during the persecutions of Emperor Diocletian and Maximian.

====England====

In England, the punishment of being &quot;hanged, drawn and quartered&quot; was typically used for men convicted of high treason. This referred to the practice of dragging a man by a hurdle (similar to a fence) through the streets, removing him from the hurdle and (1) hanging him from the neck (but removing him before death), (2) drawing (i.e. disembowelling) him slowly on a wooden block by slitting open his abdomen, removing his entrails and his other organs (which were frequently thrown on a fire), and then decapitating him and (3) quartering, i.e. dividing the body into four pieces. The man&#x27;s head and quarters would often be parboiled and displayed as a warning to others. As part of the disembowelment, the man was also typically emasculated and his genitals and entrails would be burned.

William Harrington, Hugh le Despenser the Younger and William Parry are examples of men who were hanged, drawn and quartered – tortured on the rack, hanged until not quite dead, subjected to emasculation, disembowelment and then chopped into quarters.

====Germany====
From the 15th century, ordinances are retained that threaten with a terrible punishment those who stripped off the bark of a standing tree in the common woods. A typical wording is found in the 1401 ordinance from Oberursel:

Jacob Grimm observes that no case of the punishment being carried out has been found in records from that period (15th century), but 300 to 500 years earlier, the Western Slavic tribes like the Wends are said to have revenged themselves upon Christians by binding the guts to an erect pole and driving them around until the person was fully eviscerated. In the 13th century, members of the now extinct Baltic ethnic group of Old Prussians in one of the battles against the Teutonic Knights, are said to have captured one such knight in 1248 and made him undergo this punishment.

===Americas===

Nezahualcoyotl, a 15th-century Acolhuan ruler of Texcoco, a member of the Aztec Triple Alliance (now Mexico), promulgated a law code that was partially preserved. Those who had engaged in the passive role of homosexual anal intercourse had their intestines pulled out, then their bodies were filled with ash, and finally, were burnt. The active or penetrating partner was simply suffocated in a heap of ash.

==Suicide==

In Japan, disembowelment played a central part as a method of execution or the ritualized suicide of a samurai. In killing themselves by this method, they were deemed to be free from the dishonor resulting from their crimes. The most common form of disembowelment was referred to in Japanese as &quot;seppuku&quot; (or, colloquially, &quot;hara-kiri&quot;), literally &quot;stomach cutting,&quot; involving two cuts across the abdomen, sometimes followed by pulling out one&#x27;s own viscera.

The act of decapitation by a second (&quot;kaishaku-nin&quot;) was added to this ritual suicide in later times in order to shorten the suffering of the samurai or leader, an attempt at rendering the ritual more humane. Even later the knife was just a simple formality and the swordsman would decapitate before the subject could reach for it. The commission of a crime or dishonorable act was only one of many reasons for the performance of seppuku; others included the atonement of cowardice, as a means of apology, or following the loss of a battle or the surrender of a castle.

The Japanese tradition of &quot;seppuku&quot; is a well known example of highly ritualized suicide, within a wider cultural world of norms and symbolism. However, reported examples of suicides exist, in which a person performed disembowelment on himself or herself, without any ambient culture of approved, or expected, suicide.

The Spartan king Cleomenes I is reported, in a fit of madness, to have slit his stomach open, and ripped his own bowels out.

Roman statesman Cato the Younger committed suicide in Utica, after his side lost to Caesar, by plunging a knife in his own gut, in the dead of night. According to Plutarch, Cato&#x27;s son heard the commotion from a nearby room, and called a doctor who stitched the wound closed; after his son and the doctor left, Cato tore the stitching open with his hand and died. On account of his tragic, highly symbolic suicide, Cato is often termed &quot;Uticensis&quot; (&quot;of Utica&quot;), in order to differentiate him from his homonymous ancestor, Cato &quot;the Elder&quot; or &quot;the Censor&quot;.

In 1593, a suicide occurred in Wimpfen. A young, pregnant woman, who had become a widow a few weeks before, was lying in her bed. She took a large knife, opened her belly in a cross, and threw out the fetus, her own intestines, and dug out her spleen and flung it out as well. She lived for 10 hours after the act, and when the priests sought to bring her a final consolation and blessing, she said it would all be in vain, because she was a daughter of the devil, and was beyond any sort of redemption. Then, she died, was put in a sack, and was thrown in the river. She was affluent, so it was clear that poverty had not driven her to this act.

In 1617, a merchant in the municipality Grossglockau slit his abdomen so that the intestines fell out; he then pulled out his stomach and threw it on the bed. The chronicler notes he lived long enough to regret his action.

<text>A lignotuber is a woody swelling of the root crown possessed by some plants as a protection against destruction of the plant stem, such as by fire. Other woody plants may develop basal burls as a similar survival strategy, often as a response to coppicing or other environmental stressors. However, lignotubers are specifically part of the normal course of development of the plants that possess them, and often develop early on in growth. The crown contains buds from which new stems may sprout, as well as stores of starch that can support a period of growth in the absence of photosynthesis. The term &quot;lignotuber&quot; was coined in 1924 by Australian botanist Leslie R. Kerr.

Plants possessing lignotubers include many species in Australia: &quot;Eucalyptus marginata&quot; (jarrah), &quot;Eucalyptus brevifolia&quot; (snappy gum) and &quot;Eucalyptus ficifolia&quot; (scarlet gum) all of which can have lignotubers wide and deep, as well as most mallees (where it is also known as a mallee root) and many &quot;Banksia&quot; species.

Plants possessing lignotubers on the western coast of the USA include California buckeye, coast redwood, California bay laurel (aka Oregon myrtle), and multiple species of manzanita and &quot;Ceanothus&quot;.

At least 14 species in the Mediterranean region have been identified as having lignotubers (as of 1993). Lignotubers develop from the cotyledonary bud in seedlings of several oak species including cork oak &quot;Quercus suber&quot;, but do not develop in several other oak species, and are not apparent in mature cork oak trees.

The fire-resistant lignotubers of &quot;Erica arborea&quot;, known as &quot;briar root&quot;, are commonly used to make smoking pipes.

The largest known lignotubers (also called &quot;root collar burls&quot;) are those of the Coast Redwood &quot;(Sequoia sempervirens)&quot; of central and northern California and extreme southwestern Oregon. A lignotuber washed into Big Lagoon, California, by the full gale storm of 1977 was in diameter and about half as tall and estimated to weigh . The largest dicot lignotubers are those of the Chinese Camphor Tree, or Kusu &quot;(Cinnamomum camphora)&quot; of Japan, China and the Koreas. Ones at the Vergelegen Estate in Cape Town, South Africa, which were planted in the late 1600s have muffin-shaped lignotubers up to high and about in diameter. Perhaps the largest lignotuber in Australia would be that of &quot;Old Bottle Butt&quot;, a Red Bloodwood Tree (&quot;Corymbia gummifera&quot;) near Wauchope, New South Wales, that has a lignotuber about in height and in circumference at breast height. 

Many plants with lignotubers grow in a shrubby habit, but with multiple stems arising from the lignotuber. The term lignotuberous shrub is used to describe this habit.

<doc id="179218" wikidata="Q505687" url="?curid=179218" title="Eastphalian language">
<text>Eastphalian, or Eastfalian (, Eastphalian and Low Saxon: &quot;ostfälsch Platt&quot;), is a Low German language spoken in southeastern parts of Lower Saxony and western parts of Saxony-Anhalt in Germany.

==Geographical extent==
The language area between the Weser and Elbe rivers stretches from the Lüneburg Heath in the north to the Harz mountain range and Weser Uplands in the south. It comprises the Hanover Region, Brunswick and Calenberg Land as well as the Magdeburg Börde, including the cities of Hanover, Braunschweig, Hildesheim, Göttingen and Magdeburg. It roughly corresponds with the historic region of Eastphalia.

==Classification==
Eastphalian as a separate dialect was determined by 19th century linguistics, tracing it back to Old Saxon variants spoken in eastern parts of the medieval stem duchy of Saxony. Towards the Elbe region in the southeast, the language area is increasingly influenced by the High German consonant shift.

==Features==
The most prominent characteristic in Eastphalian is the object pronouns &quot;mek&quot; and &quot;dek&quot; in contrast to &quot;mi&quot; and &quot;di&quot; in Northern Lower Saxon, respectively for High German resp. ), as well as &quot;öhne&quot;, &quot;ösch&quot;/&quot;össek&quot; and &quot;jöck&quot; (Northern Low German &quot;em, u[n]s, jo [ju],&quot; High German &quot;ihm/ihn, uns, euch&quot;). Although Eastphalian agrees with many Low German dialects (with exceptions, e.g., in southern Westphalian) in that the dative has coincided with the accusative in the forms mentioned, its peculiarity is shown by the fact that the accusative has prevailed over the dative in all of these forms (in Northern Low Saxon it is the other way around). In Eastphalian, an accusative of the first person plural has been preserved with the form &quot;üsch&quot; and southern Eastphalian &quot;össek&quot; (cf. Old High German &quot;unsih,&quot; Old English &quot;ūsic&quot; [besides &quot;ūs&quot;], also High Alemannic &quot;üs&quot;, südbairisch &quot;ins&quot; in Upper German).

The e-apocope, i.e. the omission of the &quot;-e&quot; at the end of the word, as took place in North Lower Saxon, was entirely absent in Eastphalian. Thus, the ablaut &quot;-e&quot; in words like &quot;Sprake&quot; (language, speech) and &quot;Wiele&quot; (while) remains and is not dropped. Furthermore, the &quot;-e&quot; is also preserved in nouns in the nominative case, where High German no longer has them either, such as in Harte (heart), Frue (woman), Herre (man), Bäre (bear). The same is true for many adjectives, such as dicke (fat, thick) and wisse (clear, fast; cf. German &quot;gewiss&quot;) and substantivizing endings such as -unge and -nisse, as well as for the older form -ig(e) / , which developed from Middle Low German &quot;-inge&quot;. The &quot;-e&quot; ending has also survived for nouns in the dative case. Thus, for example, &quot;uppen Felle&quot; (on the field).

Another feature of Eastphalian is the residual preservation of the prefix &quot;ge-&quot; as &quot;e-&quot; in the participle II (past participle) of verbs; since this prefix has also been lost in the very Northern regions of Eastphalia, e. g., for example, in Celle its &quot;wään&quot; (&quot;been&quot;) is opposed to southern &quot;ewää(se)n&quot; , or &quot;ewest&quot; . However, this prefix is dropped if the previous word already ends in a schwa like &quot;-e&quot; or &quot;-er&quot;.

Another striking difference between Eastphalian and all other Low German dialects is the absence (or undoing) of sound expansion in open syllable before &quot;-el, -en, -er&quot; in the following syllable, e. g. Eastphalian &quot;Löppel&quot; , &quot;betten&quot; , &quot;Pepper&quot; (&quot;spoon, bit, pepper&quot;) versus Northern Low Saxon &quot;Läpel&quot; , &quot;bäten&quot; , &quot;Päper&quot; .

Eastphalian also takes its own position in equalizing Old Saxon phonetic positions, especially in reducing vowels distinguished in open syllables, by simplifying more than Westphalian (which has no reduction in its southern dialects), but not going as far as the core area of Northern Lower Saxon (where only three of the original eight vowel phonemes remain). Despite the diversity of the sounds in detail, most of the Eastphalian dialects thus have a common sound system. (In this case, besides the Heide-Eastphalian the Göttingisch-Grubenhagen-Eastphalian - which in this case is in the same position as the East-Westphalian - is left out).

Another thing to mention is that prepositions in most of Eastphalian do not contain an umlaut. These include &quot;for&quot; , &quot;unner&quot; and &quot;over&quot; , as opposed to Northern Lower Saxon &quot;för&quot;, &quot;ünner&quot; and &quot;över&quot;.

==Subdivisions==
* Elbe Eastphalian (around Oschersleben and Haldensleben in the Magdeburg Börde between Helmstedt and Magdeburg)
* Göttingisch-Grubenhagensch (around Göttingen, Northeim and Osterode am Harz
* Heide Eastphalian (around Celle, with Northern Low Saxon elements)
* Central Eastphalian is the Eastphalian subdialect spoken in a large area surrounding Braunschweig and Hanover.
** Hildesheimsch (from around Hildesheim and Peine up to Braunschweig)
** Hannoversch (in the city of Hannover)
** Calenbergsch (west of Hannover)
** Einbecksch (around Einbeck)
** Bronswieksch (in the city of Braunschweig)

<doc id="179219" wikidata="Q2916554" url="?curid=179219" title="Future Shock">
<text>Future Shock is a 1970 book by American futurist Alvin Toffler, written together with his wife Adelaide Farrell, in which the authors define the term &quot;future shock&quot; as a certain psychological state of individuals and entire societies, and a personal perception of &quot;too much change in too short a period of time&quot;. The book, which became an international bestseller, has sold over 6 million copies and has been widely translated.

The book grew out of the article &quot;The Future as a Way of Life&quot; in &quot;Horizon&quot; magazine, Summer 1965 issue.

==Major themes==

=== Future shock ===
Alvin Toffler argued that society is undergoing an enormous structural change, a revolution from an industrial society to a &quot;super-industrial society&quot;. This change, he states, overwhelms people. He argues that the accelerated rate of technological and social change leaves people disconnected and suffering from &quot;shattering stress and disorientation&quot;—future shocked. Toffler stated that the majority of social problems are symptoms of future shock. In his discussion of the components of such shock, he popularized the term &quot;&quot;information overload&quot;.&quot;

This analysis of the phenomenon of information overload is continued in later publications, especially &quot;The Third Wave&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

In the introduction to an essay titled &quot;Future Shock&quot; in his book, &quot;Conscientious Objections&quot;, Neil Postman wrote: Sometime about the middle of 1963, my colleague Charles Weingartner and I delivered in tandem an address to the National Council of Teachers of English. In that address we used the phrase &quot;future shock&quot; as a way of describing the social paralysis induced by rapid technological change. To my knowledge, Weingartner and I were the first people ever to use it in a public forum. Of course, neither Weingartner nor I had the brains to write a book called &quot;Future Shock&quot;, and all due credit goes to Alvin Toffler for having recognized a good phrase when one came along. (p. 162)

===Development of society and production===
Alvin Toffler distinguished three stages in the development of society and production: agrarian, industrial, and post-industrial.

Each of these waves develops its own &quot;super-ideology” to explain reality. This ideology affects all the spheres that make up a civilization phase: technology, social patterns, information patterns, and power patterns.

The first stage began in the period of the Neolithic Era with the advent of agriculture, thereby passing from barbarity to civilization. A large number of people acted as prosumers (eating their grown food, hunting animals, building their own houses, making clothes...). People traded by exchanging their own goods for commodities of others. The second stage began in England with the Industrial Revolution with the invention of the machine tool and the steam engine. People worked in factories to make money they could spend on goods they needed (it means they produced for exchange, not for use). Countries also created new social systems. The third stage began in the second half of the 20th century in the West when people invented automatic production, robotics, and the computer. The services sector attained great value.

Toffler proposed one criterion for distinguishing between industrial society and post-industrial society: the share of the population occupied in agriculture versus the share of city labor occupied in the services sector. In a post-industrial society, the share of the people occupied in agriculture does not exceed 15%, and the share of city laborers occupied in the services sector exceeds 50%. Thus, the share of the people occupied with brainwork greatly exceeds the share of the people occupied with physical work in post-industrial society.

The third wave led to the Information Era (now). Homes are the dominant institutions. Most people carry produce and consume in their homes or electronic cottages, as they produce more of their own products and services markets become less important for them. People consider each other to be equally free as vendors of prosumer-generated commodities.

===Fear of the future===

Alvin Toffler&#x27;s main thought centers on the idea that modern humans (we) feel shock from rapid changes. For example, Toffler&#x27;s daughter went to shop in New York City and she couldn&#x27;t find a shop where it used to be, thus New York is a city losing her history.

===Features of post-industrial society===


*Many goods have become disposable as the cost of manual repair or cleaning has become greater than the cost of making new goods due to mass production. Examples of disposable goods include ballpoint pens, lighters, plastic bottles, and paper towels.
*The overall production of goods and services doubles every 50 years in developed countries. Society experiences an increasing number of changes with increasing rapidity, while people are losing the familiarity that old institutions (religion, family, national identity, profession) once provided. 
*&quot;Brain drain,&quot; or Human capital flight, is both an indicator of the changes in society and also one of their causes.
*The design of goods becomes outdated quickly. (And so, for example, a second generation of computers appears before the end of the expected period of usability of the first generation.) 
*It is possible to rent almost everything (from a ladder to a wedding dress), thus eliminating the need for ownership.
*Whole branches of industry die off and new branches of industry arise. This affects unskilled workers who are compelled to change their residence to find new jobs. The constant change in the market also poses a problem for advertisers who must deal with moving targets.
*People of post-industrial society change their profession and their workplace often. People have to change professions because professions quickly become outdated. People of post-industrial society thus have many careers in a lifetime. The knowledge of an engineer becomes outdated in ten years. People look more and more for temporary jobs.
*To follow transient jobs, people have become nomads. For example, immigrants from Algeria, Turkey, and other countries go to Europe to find work. Transient people are forced to change residence, phone number, school, friends, car license, and contact with family often. As a result, relationships tend to be superficial with a large number of people, instead of being intimate or close relationships that are more stable. Evidence for this is tourist travel and holiday romances.
*The driver&#x27;s license, received at age 16, has become the teenager&#x27;s admission to the world of adults because it symbolizes the ability to move independently.
*Death of Permanence. The post-industrial society will be marked by a transient culture where everything ranging from goods to human relationships will be temporary.

== Significance and reception ==
The book sold over 6 million copies within five years and has been widely translated (it had translations into twenty foreign languages as of 2003). It has been described as &quot;an international bestseller within weeks of publication&quot;.

A documentary film based on the book was released in 1972 with Orson Welles as the on-screen narrator.

Wang Huning, a distinguished member of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee mentioned the book in his 1991 travelogue &quot;America Against America&quot;.

<text>(J. 277, Op. 77 &quot;The Marksman&quot; or &quot;The Freeshooter&quot;) is a German opera with spoken dialogue in three acts by Carl Maria von Weber with a libretto by Friedrich Kind, based on a story by Johann August Apel and Friedrich Laun from their 1810 collection &quot;Gespensterbuch&quot;. It premiered on 18 June 1821 at the Schauspielhaus Berlin. It is considered the first German Romantic opera.

The opera&#x27;s plot is mainly based on August Apel&#x27;s tale &quot;Der Freischütz&quot; from the &quot;Gespensterbuch&quot; though the hermit, Kaspar and Ännchen are new to Kind&#x27;s libretto. That Weber&#x27;s tunes were just German folk music is a common misconception. Its unearthly portrayal of the supernatural in the famous Wolf&#x27;s Glen scene has been described as &quot;the most expressive rendering of the gruesome that is to be found in a musical score&quot;.

==Performance history==
The reception of &quot;Der Freischütz&quot; surpassed Weber&#x27;s own hopes and it quickly became an international success, with productions in Vienna the same year followed by Dresden, Leipzig, Hamburg, Munich, Karlsruhe, Königsberg, Prague, other German centres, Riga and Copenhagen. 1824 saw productions in four London theatres in four different adaptations, as well as an inadequate adaptation by François Castil-Blaze in French, named &quot;Robin des Bois&quot; at the Théâtre de l&#x27;Odéon.

In order to get round the Paris Opera&#x27;s ban on spoken text, a version in French with recitatives was prepared in 1841 by Hector Berlioz – who greatly admired the opera and feared other arrangers might do worse – which incorporated his orchestration of Weber&#x27;s Invitation to the Dance to serve as a ballet, another Paris Opera requirement. Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky criticised Berlioz&#x27;s arrangement in the Bolshoi Theatre production of 1873 as &quot;utterly incongruous&quot;, &quot;tasteless&quot; and &quot;silly&quot; because it inserted into the rustic opera an urban piece of music. In 1879 he again criticised a performance in Paris:
&quot;Der Freischütz&quot; afforded me great pleasure; in many places in the first act my eyes were moist with tears. In the second act Krauss pleased me greatly by her wonderful rendition of Agathe&#x27;s aria. The Wolf&#x27;s Glen was staged not at all as splendidly as I had expected. The third act was curious because of the French brazenness with which they took the liberty, on the one hand, of inserting &quot;Invitation à la valse&quot; with the most stupid dances, and, on the other, of cutting out the role of the hermit who appears at the end for the dénouement.

Berlioz&#x27;s arrangement again underlay the production at the Paris Opéra-Comique in 2011. His orchestration of &quot;Invitation à la valse&quot; soon became a concert piece in its own right.

Weber&#x27;s overture and the &quot;Huntsmen&#x27;s Chorus&quot; from act 3 (&quot;With princely enjoyment and manly employment&quot;) are often performed as concert pieces.

==Roles==
==Synopsis==
:Place: Bohemia
:Time: shortly after the end of the Thirty Years&#x27; War

===Act 1===
At a shooting contest, the second assistant forester, Max, loses to a peasant, Kilian, who is proclaimed &quot;King of marksmen&quot; (Chorus: &quot;Viktoria! Der Meister soll leben&quot;—&quot;Victory! Long live the master&quot;). Kilian mocks him good-naturedly (&quot;Schau der Herr mich an als König&quot;—&quot;Let him gaze on me as king&quot;).

Max wants to marry Agathe, daughter of the head forester Kuno. In order to marry her and succeed her father as head forester, he has to prove his marksmanship and score in a shooting trial before Ottokar, the sovereign prince, on the following day.

As Max has had ill luck for several days, he muses upon his prospects of losing Agathe by failing the shooting test (Trio of Kuno, Kaspar, and Max; chorus: &quot;O diese Sonne&quot;—&quot;O this sun&quot;). 
Left alone in deep melancholy, he recalls happy days (Aria: &quot;Durch die Wälder, durch die Auen&quot;—&quot;Through the forests, through the meadows&quot;).

Kaspar, the first assistant forester, falsely tries to imbue Max with wine and courage (&quot;Hier im ird&#x27;schen Jammerthal&quot;—&quot;Here in this vale of tears&quot;). He had hoped to marry Agathe himself but she had rejected him and chosen Max. The marriage would make Max the heir of Kuno who would see Max as a son. Kaspar seeks revenge upon all three—his rival, his former sweetheart and her father. He hands Max his gun and Max, to his own astonishment, hits an eagle soaring at a great height. Kaspar explains that the gun had been loaded with his last magic bullet.

He persuades Max to meet him at midnight in the terrible Wolf&#x27;s Glen to cast seven more of the magic bullets. (Six hit, but the seventh belongs to the Evil One who can guide it wherever he pleases.) He warns Max not to tell a soul about their purpose so as not to endanger them. Left alone, Kaspar triumphs and boasts of his insidiousness (Aria: &quot;Schweig’! damit dich niemand warnt&quot;—&quot;Silence! So that nobody warns you.&quot;).

===Act 2===

&quot;Agathe&#x27;s chamber&quot;

At the moment when Max shoots the magic bullet, a picture of Agathe&#x27;s ancestor hanging on the wall falls to the floor, slightly wounding her. Agathe&#x27;s cousin and companion Ännchen refastens the hook (Duet: &quot;Schelm, halt fest!&quot;—&quot;Rogue, hold fast!&quot;). She endeavours to cheer Agathe with jests (Ännchen: &quot;Kommt ein schlanker Bursch gegangen&quot;—&quot;Comes a pretty boy this path&quot;). Agathe, still disturbed, tells of her meeting with the hermit. He had indicated a danger from which his white consecrated roses would protect her.

Left alone, Agathe awaits Max with the news of his success (Recitative and aria: &quot;Wie nahte mir der Schlummer...Leise, leise&quot;—&quot;How did slumber approach me...Low, low&quot;). Max arrives, acknowledging that while he has not been the victor, he has killed an eagle. Though the night is falling, he has to leave again to bring in a stag which he had shot in the Wolf&#x27;s Glen (Trio: &quot;Wie? Was? Entsetzen!&quot;—&quot;What? What? Oh, horror!&quot;).

&quot;The Wolf&#x27;s Glen at night&quot;

As the bell chimes twelve Kaspar calls upon Samiel, the Black Huntsman, for assistance in casting the magic bullets. Having already sold his own soul, which is due the next day, Kaspar offers Max’s soul in exchange for a prolongation of his soul of three years. Agathe is to be killed by Max&#x27;s magic bullet, despair will then make Max and Kuno the Devil&#x27;s. Samiel agrees ambiguously: &quot;So be it—By the gates of hell! Tomorrow he or you!&quot;

As Max arrives, the spirit of his mother warns him to abandon the project. But Samiel conjures up Agathe, seemingly drowning herself in despair, whereupon Max plunges into the glen. With demoniacal noise, the casting of the bullets begins.

===Act 3===
&quot;The meeting of the marksmen&quot;

Having split the seven bullets between them, Max has used three during the hunt in the morning. Kaspar spoils his three on a fox. Thus Max&#x27;s remaining bullet is the seventh, the Devil&#x27;s bullet.

&quot;Agathe&#x27;s chamber&quot;

Agathe is praying (Aria: &quot;Und ob die Wolke sie verhülle&quot;—&quot;Though clouds obscure&quot;), her doubts having returned owing to a dream of ill omen where she was a white dove which Max shot. Ännchen tries to cheer her with a ghost tale (Aria: &quot;Einst träumte meiner sel&#x27;gen Base&quot;—&quot;My deceased cousin had a dream&quot;). The bridesmaids bring the box with the bridal wreath (Song: &quot;Wir winden dir den Jungfern-Kranz&quot;—&quot;We wind round thee the bridal wreath&quot;). But as they open it they find a funeral wreath. Recalling the hermit&#x27;s promise that the white roses will protect her, Agathe proposes to twine them to the bridal wreath.
&quot;The marksmanship trial&quot;

Prince Ottokar awaits Max at his tent (Chorus of foresters: &quot;Was gleicht wohl auf Erden&quot;—&quot;What excels the pleasures of the chase&quot;). As a test, Max is ordered to shoot the dove pointed out to him. Max takes aim, fires and Agathe, who has just entered the scene, falls as if hit (Finale: &quot;Schaut, o schaut&quot;—&quot;See, oh see&quot;). But her bridal wreath and the hermit behind her have deflected the bullet. It strikes Kaspar. Agathe revives from her faint and Kaspar, seeing a holy hermit by her side, realizes that he has failed. Samiel grasps him instead of Max, whereupon Kaspar expires, cursing hell and heaven.

Prince Ottokar orders the corpse to be thrown into the Wolf&#x27;s Glen. Then he demands an explanation from Max, who confesses to shooting with magic bullets. Regardless of pleas from Kuno, Agathe, peasants, and huntsmen, the infuriated Prince forbids the marriage and banishes Max from the country.

The hermit seeks to appease the Prince (Aria: &quot;Wer legt auf ihn so strengen Bann! Ein Fehltritt, ist er solcher Büssung wert?&quot;—&quot;Who lays so strict a sentence upon him? An error, is it worthy of such atonement?&quot;). Only love of Agathe and fear of losing her had caused Max to stray from a life that was formerly without fault. Who is to raise the first stone? Who does not look into his own heart? Once he has completed a faultless probationary year, Max should be allowed to marry Agathe. To the exuberant joy of all the Prince accepts this judgement. After the probation, he himself will place the hand of Agathe in that of Max.

In the end, all join in a prayer of thanks.

<text>The Flag of Hawaii, also known as the Hawaiian flag, is the official flag of the U.S. state of Hawaii, consisting of a field of eight horizontal stripes, in the sequence of white, red, blue, white, red, blue, white, red with a British Union Jack depicted as a canton (placed in the upper-left corner). It was first adopted in the mid 19th century by the Hawaiian Kingdom and then later became the official state flag when Hawaii was admitted into the United States as the 50th state in 1959. 

The use of the Union Jack is a legacy of the British Royal Navy&#x27;s historical relations with the Hawaiian Kingdom and, in particular, the pro-British sentiment of its first ruler, King Kamehameha I. The current design has been in use since 1845. It was retained by the Republic of Hawaii after the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in 1893. Likewise, after U.S. annexation in 1898, no change was made to the flag design used by the Territory of Hawaii before Hawaii was granted statehood. 

The flag&#x27;s eight stripes represent the main islands of the Hawaiian archipelago.

==History==
=== Before 1816 ===

Captain George Vancouver of the British Royal Navy visited the Hawaiian Islands on three occasions during his 1791 to 1795 expedition. At this time, the Hawaiian Islands were divided among several warring chiefdoms. In February 1794, while at anchorage in Kealakekua Bay off the island of Hawaii, Vancouver reached a diplomatic agreement with the king (or &quot;aliʻi)&quot; of that island, Kamehameha, who would later unite all the Hawaiian islands and become the first ruler of the Hawaiian Kingdom. Vancouver believed that the agreement reached meant Hawaii Island was being ceded to Great Britain but historians have argued that the Hawaiians saw the agreement as establishing a protectorate. After the proceedings on Vancouver&#x27;s vessel, a British flag was presented, taken ashore and raised. The flag was either a British Union Jack, or a Red Ensign as used by the Royal Navy, which features a Union Jack in the canton. In 1801, the British Union Jack added a Saint Patrick&#x27;s Cross when Ireland joined with Great Britain in a political union. Both pre- and post-1801 versions of the Red Ensign served as the unofficial flag of the Hawaiian Kingdom until 1816. 

There is an unverified anecdote that, during the War of 1812 (fought between United Kingdom and the United States from 1812 to 1815), Kamehameha became aware of the nationalist meaning of flags. To avoid offending either side, he designed a new flag for his kingdom which combined elements of both the British Union Jack and the flag of the United States at that time.

=== 1816–1845 ===
In April 1816, Kamehameha purchased a brig from Scottish Captain Alexander Adams, and arranged for Adams to take command of the ship, which was renamed . As part of the ship&#x27;s transfer, the ensign of the East India Company, which consisted of the Union Jack on a field of red-and-white stripes, was taken by Adams during a ceremony with an 11-gun salute. The next year, in March 1817, the became the first Hawaiian vessel to sail to a foreign port under a &quot;distinct&quot; Hawaiian flag which featured “red, white and blue stripes”. The Russian navigator Vasily Golovnin, based on a visit to Oahu in 1818, describes seeing a &quot;national flag&quot; which &quot;consists of seven stripes: red, white, blue, red, white, blue and red, with the English (sic) Union Jack in the corner”.

Until 1845, visitors to the Hawaiian Islands reported various versions of the flag with different numbers of stripes and colors.

=== 1845–Present ===
In 1843, either as an inadvertent mistake, or as a symbolic “reversal” gesture in the wake of the Paulet affair - a five-month-long, unofficial occupation of Hawaii by a British naval officer - the flag design was specified to have eight stripes: a white stripe on top followed by the sequence red, blue, white, red, blue, white, red. This new flag was officially unfurled May 25, 1845 at the opening of the legislative council and remains the same design as used today.
==Design==

The canton of the flag of Hawaii contains the Union Flag of the United Kingdom, prominent over the top quarter closest to the flag mast. The field of the flag is composed of eight horizontal stripes, symbolizing the eight major islands (Hawaii, Maui, Kahoolawe, Lānai, Molokai, Oahu, Kauai, and Niihau). The color of the stripes, from the top down, follows the sequence: white, red, blue, white, red, blue, white, red. The colors &quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot; and &quot;white&quot; are not explicitly defined. Despite resembling the flags of British Overseas Territories, the Hawaiian flag is proportioned differently – the Union Jack in the canton is in a 7:16 ratio.

In 2001, a survey conducted by the North American Vexillological Association (NAVA) placed Hawaii&#x27;s flag 11th in design quality, out of the 72 U.S. and Canadian provincial, state, and territorial flags ranked.
In 1990, Governor of Hawaii John Waihee proclaimed July 31 to be , the Hawaiian Flag Day. It has been celebrated each year since then. It is the same date as , Sovereignty Restoration Day, a holiday of the Hawaiian Kingdom that is celebrated by proponents of the Hawaiian sovereignty movement.

==Chronology==

== Other flags ==

=== Flag of the Governor ===

The flag used by the governor of Hawaii is a red and blue bi-color. In the middle of the eight white stars appears the name of the state in all capital letters. During the time Hawaii was a United States territory, the letters in the middle of the flag were &quot;TH&quot;, which stood for &quot;Territory of Hawaii&quot;.

=== flag ===
The (&#x27;true people&#x27; in the Hawaiian language) design is purported by some to be the original flag of the Hawaiian Kingdom, though this claim is unverified and widely disputed. It was introduced to the public by Gene Simeona in 2001. It has nine alternating stripes of green, red, and yellow defaced with a green shield with a (strip of kapa bark cloth insignia flown atop the double hulled canoe of the chief) crossed by two paddles.

Gene Simeona claims to have unearthed the Kānaka Maoli flag in 1999. Simeona said he encountered a descendant of Lord George Paulet who told him about an earlier flag. Simeona claims to have found evidence of the flag in the state archives, though any sources he may have used have not been identified. Subsequent efforts to verify Simeona&#x27;s claim have been unsuccessful. Critics of the claim have pointed to evidence of the widely accepted Hawaiian flag being in existence before the Kanaka Maoli flag. 
Louis &quot;Buzzy&quot; Agard had proposed a Hawaiian flag design in 1993 which featured nine alternating stripes and the same charge as on the flag, leading many to believe it is where Simeona drew his inspiration.

Despite the lack of verification about its historic use, the design is popular among those who prefer its lack of apparent colonial imagery.

<text>A sclerite (Greek , &#x27;, meaning &quot;[[hardness|hard]]&quot;) is a hardened body part. In various branches of biology the term is applied to various structures, but not as a rule to vertebrate anatomical features such as bones and teeth. Instead it refers most commonly to the hardened parts of [[arthropod]] [[exoskeleton]]s and the internal s of invertebrates such as certain [[sponges]] and [[Alcyonacea|soft corals]]. In [[paleontology]], ascleritome is the complete set of sclerites of an organism, often all that is known from fossil invertebrates.

==Sclerites in combination==
Sclerites may occur practically isolated in an organism, such as the sting of a cone shell. Also, they can be more or less scattered, such as tufts of defensive sharp, mineralised bristles as in many marine polychaetes. Or, they can occur as structured, but unconnected or loosely connected arrays, such as the mineral &quot;teeth&quot; in the radula of many Mollusca, the valves of chitons, the beak of a cephalopod, or the articulated exoskeletons of Arthropoda.

When sclerites are organised into an unarticulated structure, that structure may be referred to as a scleritome, a term largely used in paleontology.

==Arthropods==

In Arthropoda, the hardening that produces sclerites is accomplished either by the cross-linking of protein chains in the exocuticle, a process called sclerotization, or by incorporation of minerals such as calcium carbonate into regions of the exoskeleton, or both. Thus, the arthropod exoskeleton is divided into numerous sclerites, joined by less-sclerotized, membranous regions or sutures.

Dorsal sclerites of a body segment, often plate-like, are known as &quot;tergites&quot;. Similarly the ventral sclerites of a body segment are referred to as &quot;sternites&quot;. Separate sclerites on the lateral aspects of body segments, the pleura, are called &quot;pleurites&quot;.

==Invertebrates other than arthropods==
Wide ranges of sclerites of various kinds occur in various invertebrate phyla, including Polychaeta and Mollusca. Two taxa that routinely have the term applied however, are the soft corals and the Porifera. In both those groups certain of their structures contain mineralised spicules of silica or calcium carbonate that are of importance structurally and in defense.

Many other invertebrates grow a few hard parts, largely mineralised, as statoliths and similar structures, but those are not generally referred to as sclerites. 

Clamps, the main attachment structure of the parasitic polyopisthocotylean monogenean flatworms, are composed of various sclerites and associated musculature, located on a posterior organ called the haptor. Clamps are specialized structures attached to the host fish, generally to its gill.

==Prehistory==

A scleritome is a skeleton made of isolated elements, like the scales of organisms such as the halwaxiids, the teeth in a radula, spicules in a sponge skeleton, or the elements in a conodont apparatus. The term was coined by the palaeontologist Stefan Bengtson.

Although sclerites are of considerable importance in the study of extant animals, in palaeontology they are of far greater relative importance because they often are the only parts of an animal that fossilize at all, let alone well or clearly. Many extinct groups are known only from sclerites, leaving moot the question of what their gross anatomy might have looked like.

An example of the use of the term in paleontology is to describe hollow calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate or calcium phosphate plates grown as body armor by a number of Early Cambrian animals. Unlike sponge spicules, Early Cambrian sclerites appear to be external armor rather than internal structural elements. Sclerites are found on a curious collection of early animals including a common spongelike animal called &quot;Chancelloria&quot;; an armored slug-like form &quot;Wiwaxia&quot;; an armored worm with a pair of brachiopod-like shells &quot;Halkieria&quot;; and another armored worm &quot;Microdictyon&quot; that is generally considered to be a lobopod/onychophore.

It has been suggested that the sclerites of the Cambrian &quot;Wiwaxia&quot; are homologous with the bristles of annelid worms.
At least one modern gastropod mollusc living near deep sea hydrothermal vents has structures made of iron sulfides similar to some Cambrian sclerites.
