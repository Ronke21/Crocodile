<text>World Series Cricket (WSC) was a commercial professional cricket competition staged between 1977 and 1979 which was organised by Kerry Packer and his Australian television network, Nine Network. WSC ran in commercial competition to established international cricket. World Series Cricket drastically changed the nature of cricket, and its influence continues to be felt today.

Three main factors caused the formation of WSC — a widespread view that players were not paid sufficient amounts to make a living from cricket or reflect their market value and that following the development of colour television and increased viewer audiences of sports events, the commercial potential of cricket was not being achieved by the established cricket boards and Packer wished to secure the exclusive broadcasting rights to Australian cricket, then held by the non-commercial, government-owned Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC), to realise and capitalise on the commercial potential of cricket.

After the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) refused to accept Channel Nine&#x27;s bid to gain exclusive television rights to Australia&#x27;s Test matches in 1976, Packer set up his own series by secretly signing agreements with leading Australian, English, Pakistani, South African and West Indian players, most notably England captain Tony Greig, West Indies captain Clive Lloyd, Australian captain Greg Chappell, future Pakistani captain Imran Khan and former Australian captain Ian Chappell. Packer was aided by businessmen John Cornell and Austin Robertson, both of whom were involved with the initial setup and administration of the series.

Australian Captain Ian Chappell summed up the quality of World Series Cricket by saying it was the toughest cricket that he ever played (having all the best players in the world involved).

==Kerry Packer and the Australian television industry==
In the mid-1970s, the Australian television industry was at a crossroads. Since its inception in 1956, commercial television in Australia had developed a reliance on imported programs, particularly from the United States, as buying them was cheaper than commissioning Australian productions. Agitation for more Australian-made programming gained impetus from the &quot;TV: Make it Australian&quot; campaign in 1970. This led to a government-imposed quota system in 1973. The advent of colour transmissions in 1975 markedly improved sport as a television spectacle and, importantly, Australian sport counted as local content. However, sports administrators perceived live telecasts to have an adverse effect on attendance. The correlation between sports, corporate sponsorship, and television exposure was not evident to Australian sports administrators at the time.

After the death of his father Sir Frank in 1974, Kerry Packer had assumed control of Channel Nine, one of the many media interests owned by the family&#x27;s company Consolidated Press Holdings (CPH). With Nine&#x27;s ratings languishing, Packer sought to turn the network around via an aggressive strategy that included more sports programming. Firstly, he secured the rights to the Australian Open golf tournament. He spent millions of dollars revamping The Australian Golf Club in Sydney as a permanent home for the tournament. Jack Nicklaus was hired to redesign the course and to appear in the tournament. Packer was a fan of cricket, which was undergoing a resurgence in popularity during the mid-1970s. In 1976, Packer sought the rights to televise Australia&#x27;s home Test matches, the contract for which was about to expire. He approached the ACB with an offer of A$1.5 million for three years (eight times the previous contract), yet he was rebuffed. The ACB felt loyal to the ABC, which had broadcast the game for twenty years when the commercial networks showed little interest in the game. Packer believed that there was an &quot;old-boy network&quot; element to the decision, and he was furious at the dismissive way that his bid was handled. The government-funded ABC could not hope to match a commercial network&#x27;s bid, but they were awarded another three-year contract worth only $210,000, commencing with the 1976–77 season.

Determined to get some cricket on Channel Nine, Packer put an offer to the Test and County Cricket Board (TCCB) to telecast the Australian tour of England scheduled for 1977. His interest was further stimulated by a proposal to play some televised exhibition matches, an idea presented to him by Western Australian businessmen John Cornell and Austin Robertson. Robertson managed several high-profile Australian cricketers such as Dennis Lillee, while Cornell was Paul Hogan&#x27;s business manager and on-screen sidekick.

Packer took this idea, then fleshed it out into a full series between the best Australian players and a team from the rest of the world. His mistrust of cricket&#x27;s administrators deepened when the ACB recommended the TCCB accept an offer for their broadcasts rights from the ABC, even though ABC&#x27;s $210,000 offer was only 14% of the offer from Packer. For the first time, the game&#x27;s officialdom had a demonstration of Packer&#x27;s wherewithal: he immediately doubled his original offer and won the contract. But he never forgot the machinations involved in winning the bid.

==Secret signings==
Packer&#x27;s planning of the proposed &quot;exhibition&quot; series was audacious. In early 1977, he began contracting a list of Australian players provided by recently retired Australian Test captain Ian Chappell. A bigger coup was achieved when Packer convinced the England captain Tony Greig to not only sign on, but to act as an agent in signing many players around the world. By the time the season climaxed with the 
Centenary Test match between Australia and England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in March 1977, about two dozen players had committed to Packer&#x27;s enterprise, which as yet had no grounds to play on, no administration and was secret to all in the cricket world. It was a measure of the players&#x27; dissatisfaction with official cricket that they were prepared to sign up for what was still a vague concept and yet keep everything covert.

By the time the Australian team arrived to tour England in May 1977, thirteen of the seventeen members of the squad had committed to Packer. News of the WSC plans were inadvertently leaked to Australian journalists, who broke the story on 9 May. Immediately, all hell broke loose in the hitherto conservative world of cricket. Not unexpectedly, the English were critical of what they quickly dubbed the &quot;Packer Circus&quot; and reserved particular vitriol for the English captain Tony Greig, for his central role in organising the break-away. Greig retained his position in the team, but was stripped of the captaincy and ostracised by everyone in the cricket establishment, most of whom had been singing his praises just weeks before.

It seemed certain that all Packer players would be banned from Test and first-class cricket. The Australian players were a divided group and the management made their displeasure clear to the Packer signees. Dispirited by this turn of events and hampered by poor form and indifferent weather, Australia crashed to a 3–0 defeat, surrendering the Ashes won two years before. In light of the controversies the &quot;Sydney Gazette&quot; article clearly showed West Indian captain Clive Lloyd interviewed after leaving the Caribbean team to join Packer, Lloyd stated it was nothing personal it was clearly earning a more comfortable source of income. That interview created waves across the Caribbean and even in world cricket. It was then realised that the sport had been transformed into one&#x27;s livelihood.

==Court case==
A largely unknown Kerry Packer arrived in London in late May 1977. He appeared on David Frost&#x27;s &quot;The Frost Programme&quot; to debate his concept with commentators Jim Laker and Robin Marlar. Marlar&#x27;s aggressive, indignant interrogation of Packer came unstuck when Packer proved to be articulate, witty, and confident that his vision was the way of the future. The show significantly raised Packer&#x27;s profile and converted some to his way of thinking. The main goal of his trip was to meet the game&#x27;s authorities and reach some type of compromise. He made a canny move by securing Richie Benaud as a consultant. Benaud&#x27;s standing in the game and his journalistic background helped steer Packer through the politics of the game.

Cricket&#x27;s world governing body, the International Cricket Conference (ICC), now entered a controversy initially perceived as an Australian domestic problem. They met with Packer, Benaud and two assistants at Lord&#x27;s on 23 June to discuss the WSC plans. After ninety minutes of compromise from both sides had almost created common ground, Packer demanded that the ICC award him the exclusive Australian television rights after the 1978–79 season ended. It wasn&#x27;t in the power of the ICC to do so and Packer stormed from the meeting to deliver the following unadulterated declaration of war:
Had I got those TV rights I was prepared to withdraw from the scene and leave the running of cricket to the board.I will take no steps now to help anyone. It&#x27;s every man for himself and the devil take the hindmost.

This outburst undid any goodwill that Packer had created during his earlier television appearance, and alarmed his contracted players, who had viewed his scheme as being as much philanthropic as commercial. The ICC decided to treat Packer&#x27;s scheme with contempt when a month later they decided Packer&#x27;s matches would not be given first-class status and the players involved would be banned from Test matches and first-class cricket.

A number of the signed players now considered withdrawing. Jeff Thomson and Alvin Kallicharan had their contracts torn up when it was discovered that they had binding agreements with a radio station in Brisbane requiring them to play for Queensland. Packer moved quickly to shore up support, meeting with the players and taking legal action to prevent third parties from inducing players to break their contracts. To clarify the legal implications (including the proposed bans), Packer backed a challenge to the TCCB in the High Court by three of his players: Tony Greig, Mike Procter and John Snow.

The case began on 26 September 1977 and lasted seven weeks. The cricket authority&#x27;s counsel said that if the top players deserted traditional cricket then gate receipts would decline. Mr. Packer&#x27;s lawyers stated that the ICC had tried to force the Packer players to break their contracts and to prevent others from joining them. Mr Justice Christopher Slade considered the following nine points:

# Are the contracts between WSC and its players void?
# Has WSC established that, as at 3 August, and subject to any statutory immunity conferred by the 1974 Act, it was a good cause of action in tort against the ICC based on inducement of breach of contract?
# Has WSC established that as at 3 August and subject as aforesaid, it had a good cause of action in tort against the TCCB based on the same grounds?
# Subject to the provisions of the 1974 Act, are the new ICC rules void as being in restraint of trade?
# Subject to aforesaid, are the proposed new TCCB rules void as being in restraint of trade?
# Is the ICC an employers&#x27; association within the 1974 Act?
# Is the TCCB an employers&#x27; association?
# If either the ICC or TCCB or both be employers&#x27; associations, does this itself bar any cause of action that would otherwise exist?
# In the light of the answers, what relief (if any) should be given to (a) the individual plaintiffs and (b) WSC?

Justice Slade in his judgement said that professional cricketers need to make a living and the ICC should not stand in their way just because its own interests might be damaged. He said the ICC might have stretched the concept of loyalty too far. Players could not be criticised for entering the contracts in secrecy as the main authorities would deny the players the opportunity to enjoy the advantages offered by WSC.

The decision was a blow to the cricket authorities and, adding insult to injury, they had to pay court costs. English County cricket teams were pleased as their players who had signed to play for Packer were still eligible to play for them.

==&quot;Supertests&quot;, the West Indies and drop-in pitches==

Official cricket won a series of minor victories – Packer was unable to use the terms &quot;Test match&quot; or call their team of Australians &quot;Australia&quot;, or use the official rules of cricket, which are the copyright of the Marylebone Cricket Club.

So the five-day matches became &quot;Supertests&quot;, played by the &quot;WSC Australian XI&quot; and Richie Benaud set to work writing rules and playing conditions for the series. Most importantly, WSC was shut out of traditional cricket venues, so Packer leased two Australian rules football stadiums (VFL Park in Melbourne and Football Park in Adelaide), as well as Perth&#x27;s Gloucester Park (a trotting track) and Sydney&#x27;s Moore Park Showground.

The obvious problem was preparing grass pitches of suitable standard at these venues, where none had existed previously. By common consensus, it was considered impossible to create the pitches in such a short time. However, Packer hired curator John Maley, who pioneered the concept of &quot;drop-in&quot; pitches. These pitches were grown in hothouses outside the venue, then dropped into the playing surface with cranes. This revolutionary technique was the unsung highlight of the first season of WSC – without them, WSC would have been a folly.

Another unexpected element of the series was the emergence of a West Indian side. The concept was originally envisaged as Australia versus Rest of the World. When the West Indians were offered contracts that would pay them more than they could earn in an entire career, they all signed with alacrity. However, WSC used the West Indian players in the Rest of the World team as well.

The first WSC game, a &quot;Supertest&quot; between the Australians and the West Indians began at VFL Park on 2 December 1977. The standard of the cricket was excellent, but the crowds were poor, which was emphasised by the stadium&#x27;s capacity of 79,000. The official Test match played in Brisbane at the same time, featuring the weakened Australian team and India, attracted far more spectators.

==First season: 1977–78==
Employing personality-based marketing, WSC placed great emphasis on the &quot;gladiatorial&quot; aspect of fast bowling and heavily promoted fast bowlers such as Dennis Lillee, Imran Khan, Michael Holding and Andy Roberts. Packer was doubtful of the effectiveness of slow bowling. To counteract the continual rotation of pace bowlers on pitches of unproven quality, WSC batsmen felt the need to increase their bodily protection. In the Sydney Supertest on 16 December, Australian David Hookes was hit a sickening blow from a bouncer bowled by West Indian Andy Roberts. Paradoxically, the effect of Hookes&#x27; broken jaw, captured graphically by Nine&#x27;s cameras, served to &quot;legitimise&quot; the WSC matches:
... he had his jaw shattered by a bouncer from Andy Roberts ... Until that moment, WSC had looked suspiciously like a thrown-together entertainment package; Hookes&#x27; injury impressed the contest&#x27;s intensity on all observers.

This incident had another effect: the first helmets appeared on batsmen&#x27;s heads. Initially, Englishman Dennis Amiss sported a motorcycle helmet when batting in WSC, and he was quickly followed by many other players. Protective cricket equipment developed rapidly, and by the end of WSC, virtually all batsmen in WSC and official Test matches were sporting some form of protective headwear.

WSC decided to place a greater emphasis on one-day cricket than it had previously been given in Australia. A one-day series, the &quot;International Cup&quot; featuring the Australian, West Indian, and World teams, was played alongside six Supertests in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, and Perth. The first day/night match, played at Melbourne&#x27;s VFL Park, attracted some curiosity value, but generally, the paying public were indifferent to the series. Many took a lead from the hostile press, and official cricket benefited from a dramatic Test series played between Australia and a touring Indian team. The ACB&#x27;s masterstroke was the appointment of the 41-year-old Bob Simpson as Australian captain, after a ten-year retirement from first-class cricket. He led a team of relatively unknown youngsters (with the exception of fast bowler Jeff Thomson, who did not sign up for the WSC) to a 3–2 series victory which was not decided until the final Test in Adelaide. Big crowds attended the Tests, and the media coverage was very supportive of the ACB throughout the summer.

By contrast, Packer was seen disconsolately counting cars as they arrived in the car park at some of his matches. He held one glimmer of hope, however. The best-attended matches had been the day-night fixtures, and this format would become the backbone of the programming for the second season. In hindsight, his organisation&#x27;s ability to even stage the games at such short notice was a triumph and excellent fine-tuning for what was to come. So far, the ACB had enjoyed the backing of the press and the true aficionados of the game. But a series of misfortunes and poor decisions came to plague the ACB in their battle to stay ahead of Packer.

The official Australian team toured the Caribbean under Bob Simpson in March 1978. The West Indies cricket officials had no wish to buy into the ACB-Packer fight and decided to select all of their WSC players for the first two Tests, until the West Indies Cricket Board of Control made a decision to leave out three of their WSC-contracted players for the 3rd Test, ostensibly to allow others a chance to play in Test matches prior to the West Indies&#x27; tour to India and Sri Lanka later in the year, which would be at a time that World Series Cricket could not guarantee the availability of their West Indian players. The non-selection of these three players led to the resignation of Clive Lloyd as captain, and all of the WSC contracted West Indian players to declare themselves unavailable for the rest of the series.

==The united front weakens==
Between the two WSC seasons, the united front presented by the ICC countries began to erode. The highest ill-feeling toward Packer existed in England, but many officials of the county clubs were prepared to keep Packer players on their books.

The West Indies were the most financially vulnerable, and only voted for the original ICC in the interests of unity. The financial and political problems of the recent Australian tour led them to begin negotiations with Packer for a WSC series in the Caribbean during the spring of 1979. Initially, Pakistan took a hard line and refused to select their Packer players, but when WSC signed additional Pakistanis during the off-season, and when an under-strength official Pakistan team were easily beaten by England in the three-Test series in the English summer of 1978, they took a more pragmatic approach, so when it came time in October 1978 for the first Test series between Pakistan and India for seventeen years, all the Packer players were included. Ostensibly, India were not involved as yet, but rumours abounded that their captain Bishan Bedi and star batsman Sunil Gavaskar had signed WSC options.

New Zealand&#x27;s chief administrator, Walter Hadlee, had advocated a compromise from the start. Now he had no objection to WSC making a brief tour of his country in November, nor was he going to stop the Kiwis&#x27; best player, his son Richard, from appearing with WSC. The South Africans, subject to an international boycott caused by the apartheid policy of their government, were keen to see their individual cricketers compete with the world&#x27;s best. Some were prepared to acclaim South Africa as the best side of the world on the basis of the performances of some of their players (LeRoux and Proctor best bowling averages, Barry Richards best batting average) in WSC.

Meanwhile, WSC continued to up the stakes for the embattled ACB, optioning a number of young Australians and signing more overseas players: they now had well over 50 cricketers under contract. After organising the tours of New Zealand and the West Indies, WSC began making noises about a tour to England and signing enough players for stand-alone England and Pakistan teams.

A second-tier tour was created for the 1978–79 season, taking the game to provincial centres around Australia and giving back-up players an opportunity to play regularly. This tour covered a 20,000-kilometre route between Cairns in Queensland to Devonport in Tasmania. WSC created the &quot;Cavaliers&quot; for this secondary tour, a similar concept to the &quot;International Cavaliers&quot; teams of the 1960s in England. The team captained by Eddie Barlow was made of recently retired cricketers, such as Rohan Kanhai, David Holford and Ian Redpath and occasionally young Australians such as Trevor Chappell. It also starred a great innings at Maitland, New South Wales, by a then unheard of Kepler Wessels of 92 not out for the Cavaliers. These matches brought cricket to venues that rarely saw big games.

Packer demonstrated his political clout by getting New South Wales premier Neville Wran to overturn the ban on WSC and allow matches to be played at the traditional home of the game, the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG). To boot, Wran had his government foot the bill to install floodlights at the SCG good enough to be used in WSC matches. WSC also gained access to Brisbane&#x27;s Test ground, Brisbane Cricket Ground, and were offered use of the Adelaide Oval, which was rejected. Perth and Adelaide were dropped from the itinerary. A strategy of focusing on audiences in Melbourne and Sydney was now in place.

==Second season: 1978–79==
The war swung dramatically in Packer&#x27;s favour on 28 November 1978 when the first day-night match on a traditional cricket ground was played at the SCG between the WSC Australian and West Indian teams. A near-capacity crowd of 44,374 turned out to watch the limited overs contest, serving a warning to the ACB. A few days later, the official Australian team was humbled in the first Test against England at Brisbane, a precursor to a 5–1 thrashing for a side now captained by the unprepared Graham Yallop. Even Yallop felt himself unsuited to the position, and his team was unable to compete with an experienced, professional England side. Although the Englishmen merely defeated the opposition presented, they further damaged the ACB&#x27;s cause by playing slow, grinding cricket. Consequently, attendances were poor and the media clamoured for the Australian team to return to full strength.

On the other hand, WSC, with its aggressive marketing, nighttime play, and a plethora of one-day matches, had increased both attendances and television ratings. The targeted audience of women and children flocked to WSC, and the playing standard remained high.

The Supertest final at the SCG between Australia XI and Rest Of The World XI, played under lights, drew almost 40,000 spectators over three days. The sixth Australia-England Test at the same venue a week later was attended by just 22,000 people for four days of play. Later in the season, the ACB scheduled two Tests against Pakistan, which brought the number of Tests played by Australia to eight. This overkill further damaged the ACB&#x27;s finances. The Pakistanis played their WSC men in what turned out to be an ill-tempered series.

WSC then headed to the Caribbean for a tense, hard-fought series that players from both Australia and West Indies declared the best they ever played in. A riot marred the Guyana Supertest, but the five Supertests and 12 one-day matches went some way toward reducing the debts of the West Indies board. The last cricket action of WSC occurred on 10 April 1979, the final day of a drawn Supertest at Antigua. The West Indies and Australia finished the series 1–1.

==The rapprochement==
By 1979, the ACB was in desperate financial straits and faced the prospect of fighting an opponent who had seemingly endless cash resources. In two seasons, the combined losses of the two biggest cricket associations, New South Wales and Victoria, totalled more than half a million dollars. Kerry Packer was also feeling the financial pinch – many years later, WSC insiders claimed that the losses he incurred were very much higher than the amounts quoted at the time. During March of that year, Packer instigated a series of meetings with then chairman of the ACB board, Bob Parish, which hammered out an agreement on the future of Australian cricket.

When Parish announced the truce on 30 May 1979, a surprise was in store for followers of the game. Not only had Channel Nine won the exclusive rights to telecast Australian cricket, it was granted a ten-year contract to promote and market the game through a new company, PBL Marketing. The ACB capitulation infuriated the English authorities and the ICC as they had provided much in the way of financial and moral support to the ACB, which now appeared to have sold out to Packer. According to the 1980 issue of &quot;Wisden&quot;:
The feeling in many quarters was that when the Australian Board first found Packer at their throats, the rest of the cricket world supported them to the hilt; even to the extent of highly expensive court cases which cricket could ill afford. Now, when it suited Australia, they had brushed their friends aside to meet their own ends.

The WSC Australian players (on tour in West Indies at the time) had no input into the negotiations. This left some disillusioned and apprehensive that they would suffer discrimination from the ACB in the coming years. The ACB opted to not select WSC-contracted players for the tours of England (for the 1979 World Cup) and India (for six Tests) later in the year. Both tours produced sub-standard Australian performances, and both were led by Kim Hughes.

For the 1979–80 season, Greg Chappell was restored as Australian captain and the team contained an even mixture of WSC and non-WSC players. The season&#x27;s schedule was similar to the WSC format. England and West Indies toured, playing three Tests each against Australia, with a triangular one-day tournament (the World Series Cup) interspersed among the Tests. Australia&#x27;s results were mixed: in the Test matches, they defeated England 3–0 (having lost 5–1 to the same opponents the previous summer) but lost 0–2 to West Indies, and they failed to make the final of the one-day tournament. The format of the season received heavy criticism, but still made a healthy profit, much of which went to PBL rather than the ACB.

==Legacy==

World Series Cricket changed the game in many ways. Due to the punishing schedule, cricketers had to be fitter than ever before.

Night matches have become very common, in all forms of the game, with the recent innovation of the Day-night test proving popular. Players became full-time professionals, and at least in the larger cricketing nations are very well-paid, mainly through television rights; broadcasters now have a huge say in the running of the game. With the advent of Twenty20 cricket, players can now play in many domestic leagues around the world and attract high salaries, partly due to broadcast rights. The Indian Premier League only trails the NFL in terms of per-match value of broadcast rights, sitting at USD 15.1 million per match, for a deal worth USD 6 billion running from 2023-27.

However, the traditional form of the game, first-class cricket and Test matches, is still played around the world, and in recent seasons has challenged one-day cricket for the interest of the public. Indeed, membership of a Test Cricket side is often seen as being more prestigious for players, due both to the more challenging nature of the format and to the higher turnover rate of one-day players. Kerry Packer described his involvement in World Series Cricket as &quot;half-philanthropic&quot;.

Marketing was a major tool for World Series Cricket, and revolutionised the way cricket in Australia was marketed, with the catchy &quot;C&#x27;mon Aussie C&#x27;mon&quot; theme song, the simple logo, the coloured clothing worn by the players, and a range of merchandise. All of these techniques pioneered by World Series Cricket have become a staple of the way the game is now marketed in Australia.

In the Australian team, there was a division between the players who stayed loyal to the official XI and the Packer rebels, especially between players such as Dennis Lillee, Rod Marsh, former WSC players, and Kim Hughes who stuck with the official side. The division went on into the 1980s. Many of WSC&#x27;s players fitted back into the official Australian side, though a handful of players from outside WSC remained at the highest level, most notably Allan Border.

The ACB continued to use the name &quot;World Series Cup&quot; to describe the One Day International tournament it held during each summer, usually involving Australia and two other international teams. This format was from WSC&#x27;s International Cup. The name was used until the mid-1990s.

Coloured dress, protective helmets, field restrictions, and cricket under lights became a standard part of the post-Packer game. Crucially, Packer drove home the lesson that cricket was a marketable game, which could generate huge revenues.

Austin Robertson when he was promoting his book &quot;Cricket Outlaws&quot; stated how much the directors were paid for World Series Cricket. John Cornell – $70,000, Paul Hogan – $20,000 and Austin Robertson – $10,000.

The Nine Network continued to hold the rights to Test and international cricket in Australia until 2018, when the rights were given to the Seven Network and Foxtel. As of late 2022, Nine is again seeking the rights to international cricket, with Seven suing Cricket Australia over the quality of the Big Bash League.

==Trivia==

*During the life of WSC, 56,126 runs were made and 2,364 wickets taken. The 1977 ruling of the ICC that the matches were not first-class has remained, so none of the WSC players&#x27; records include the runs and wickets of the WSC era.
*WSC&#x27;s advertising jingle &quot;C&#x27;mon Aussie C&#x27;mon&quot; was released as a single and was number one on the Australian charts in February 1979.

<text>The Australia Party was a minor centrist political party in Australia from 1969 to 1986. It was most influential in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

The party was established in 1969 under the leadership of Senator Reg Turnbull, as a merger of Turnbull&#x27;s supporters and Gordon Barton&#x27;s Australian Reform Movement. Turnbull&#x27;s involvement was short-lived and he resigned from the party in 1970. At federal level, the party achieved its best result at the 1970 Senate election, with nearly three percent of the national vote. Its preference allocations were also influential at the 1972 and 1974 federal elections, while two candidates were elected to the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly in 1975. Most members of the party joined the newly formed Australian Democrats in 1977, with former Australia Party national convenors John Siddons and Colin Mason later elected as Democrats senators.

==History==
===Background===
The Australia Party grew out of the Liberal Reform Group, a group of members of the Liberal Party of Australia and Independents who opposed the party&#x27;s policy of conscription and military involvement in the Vietnam War. The leading figure in this group was a businessman, Gordon Barton, who was assisted in the funding by Ken Thomas of TNT Transport and with the party organisation and branch establishment by Nick Gorshenin, Sydney shark meshing contractor and North Sydney Council alderman.

On 22 October 1966, when US President Lyndon B. Johnson visited Sydney, Gordon Barton and Ken Thomas sponsored a full-page advertisement in the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; lamenting the involvement of Australian troops in the Vietnam War. At that time no political party was opposed to Australian involvement in the war. Nick Gorshenin telephoned Gordon Barton that evening and they decided to form the Liberal Reform Group, later rebranded as the Australian Reform Movement. They used their various contacts to establish the initial branches in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Newcastle and Gold Coast.

===Peak===
The &quot;Australia Party&quot; name was adopted in 1969, by which time it was also attracting disaffected Australian Labor Party (ALP) supporters. The party contested state and federal elections, achieving its best results in 1972. Though failing to win any seats, by directing its preferences to the ALP, it greatly assisted that party to win government for the first time since 1949. The Australia Party poll performance declined a little in 1974 and again in the 1975 federal election; however, by this stage it had replaced the Democratic Labor Party as the fourth party after Labor, Liberal and Country parties.

On 20 July 1969, independent senator Reg Turnbull announced that he and his supporters had agreed to merge with the Australian Reform Movement (ARM) to form a new political party, which was named the Australia Party on the basis that it would &quot;put Australia before party&quot;. A main goal of Turnbull and the new party was the end of Australian involvement in the Vietnam War. At the time of the party&#x27;s creation, the ARM claimed 800 formal members and 8,000 supporters.

Turnbull&#x27;s term as leader of the Australia Party proved to be &quot;brief and unhappy&quot;, with a number of former ARM members leaving the Australia Party as they felt Barton and its leadership had acted undemocratically in conducting secret negotiations with Turnbull. He resigned from the party on 3 March 1970 and reverted back to being an independent.

===Later years===
In July 1974, Gordon Barton announced he would not seek re-election as national convenor of the Australia Party. He was replaced by Melbourne industrialist John Siddons in December 1974, who defeated Ian Gilfillan for the position. Siddons was publicly critical of the Whitlam government&#x27;s economic policies, and proclaimed that the party stood for &quot;the middle ground against the extremes of either right or left&quot;. In November 1975 the Australia Party formally affiliated with the Liberal International. Siddons was replaced as national convenor by Colin Mason in August 1976.

Subsequently, the party allied itself with the New Liberal Movement in the formation of the Australian Democrats for the 1977 federal election. However, a rump party continued on, fielding separate candidates in NSW, SA and Victoria in the 1977 election, in SA and Victoria in the 1980 election and the 1982 Flinders by-election. One candidate stood for the House of Representatives in Victoria in 1983. Relations between the rump party and the Australian Democrats were poor: in the 1977 election in South Australia, Australia Party preferences flowed to the Liberal Party rather than the Democrats, resulting in the Liberal Baden Teague defeating the Democrat Ian Gilfillan for the fifth and final Senate seat. The rump party merged into former Australian Democrat John Siddons&#x27; new Unite Australia Party (UAP) in December 1986, along with the Advance Australia Party. At the time &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; reported that the Australia Party had few remaining members, most of whom were in Victoria.

==Notable members==
Significant figures in the Australia Party were Senator Reg Turnbull (elected as an independent, but Australia Party leader in 1969–1970), and journalist Alan Fitzgerald, then an elected member of the Australian Capital Territory Advisory Council. Two Australia Party members were elected to the newly formed Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly in 1975: Ivor Vivian and Maureen Worsley. Vivian joined the Australian Democrats, and was re-elected in 1979, but Worsley sat as an Independent from 1977 to the end of her term in 1979. Australia Party members who later entered federal parliament as Australian Democrats senators included Colin Mason (NSW), John Siddons (Vic), Sid Spindler (Vic) and Jean Jenkins (WA).

==Legacy==
An important aspect of the Australia Party and later Australian Democrats is that they nullified and then overtook the minority influence of the Democratic Labor Party, which had wielded much influence in post-war federal and state politics. The Australia Party altered the power dynamics, and the Australia Democrats continued that role until they were succeeded by the Greens in the 2004 federal election.

<doc id="185058" wikidata="Q490229" url="?curid=185058" title="9/11 (2002 film)">
<text>9/11 is a 2002 documentary film about the September 11 attacks in New York City, in which two planes were flown into the buildings of the World Trade Center, resulting in their destruction and the deaths of nearly 3,000 people. The film is from the point of view of the New York City Fire Department. The film was directed by brothers Jules and Gédéon Naudet and FDNY firefighter James Hanlon and produced by Susan Zirinsky of CBS News.

==Synopsis==

Filmmakers James Hanlon and the Naudet brothers were given permission by the New York City Fire Department to film a documentary about a probationary firefighter. Their subject was Antonios (Tony) Benetatos, who was assigned to the Engine 7/Ladder 1/Battalion 1 Firehouse on Duane Street in Lower Manhattan. They intended to make a film about the &quot;probie&#x27;s&quot; first experiences as a firefighter. On the morning of September 11, 2001, the firehouse, under the direction of Battalion Chief Joseph W. Pfeifer, was called out on a reported &quot;odor of gas&quot; at Church and Lispenard streets. Jules Naudet rode with Pfeifer to investigate, while Gédéon stayed behind at the firehouse to film the &quot;probie.&quot;

As the Battalion 1 firefighters examined the supposed gas leak, American Airlines Flight 11 flew overhead. Turning his camera to the left to follow the plane, Jules Naudet taped one of only three known recordings of Flight 11 flying into the North Tower (Tower 1) of the World Trade Center during the September 11 attacks. The others were shot by Czech tourist Pavel Hlava and German Wolfgang Staehle, but both were filmed from farther away. Hlava’s video was also taken from a far worse angle than Naudet’s, and though the towers are clearly shown in Staehle&#x27;s recording, it was only a sequence of still frames.

The firefighters under the direction of Chief Pfeifer were the first responders on the scene. Naudet was allowed to follow the chief during the attempted rescue operation. Naudet, Chief Pfeifer and several other FDNY chiefs were inside the lobby of Tower 1 when Tower 2 was hit by United Airlines Flight 175 and when Tower 2 eventually collapsed. Naudet, Chief Pfeifer, and other surviving firefighters were able to flee the lobby and eventually make it outside of Tower 1 safely before it eventually collapsed.

While the events at the World Trade Center unfolded, Gédéon Naudet filmed Benetatos, who was assigned to stay at the firehouse, where he was the only firefighter for some time. Unable to leave, Benetatos puts on the news where he learns that American Airlines Flight 77 has crashed into The Pentagon. After Tower 2 collapsed, Benetatos, together with retired former fire chief Larry Byrnes, left the firehouse for the World Trade Center. Naudet lost contact with them and filmed the streets near World Trade Center, being held back by police officers from getting closer to the scene and to his missing brother. Later he again filmed at the firehouse, as more and more firefighters got back and tried to deal with the disaster. After some time of uncertainty, his brother arrived, and later also &quot;probie&quot; Benetatos, as the last one of the firefighter team. Benetatos had stayed at the scene after the second tower collapse, searching the debris for survivors until around 6 pm. Everyone of the team survived.

The film gives various firemen&#x27;s accounts of the events of the remainder of the day: from the initial crash to the building&#x27;s collapse, to the attempts to rescue the few survivors from the rubble, as well as the aftermath of the events and acknowledging those who were lost, including Chief Pfeifer&#x27;s brother, Engine 33 Lieutenant Kevin Pfeifer.

==Release and reception ==

CBS aired &quot;9/11&quot; commercial-free on March 10, 2002, to mark six months since the attacks. It was produced by Susan Zirinsky. The film was watched by 39.4 million viewers, bringing in a rating/share of 22.3/33, and was the highest-rated program that week. Hosted by actor Robert De Niro, CBS&#x27;s broadcast was repeated on the first anniversary as well. The film aired in 103 countries in 2002 alone.

The film was noted for the subjects&#x27; use of profanity. Under regular circumstances on American broadcast media, this language would have been subject to censorship by the broadcaster or the Federal Communications Commission. At the time of the documentary&#x27;s broadcast, the FCC took no action against the network for violating indecency rules, because it believed such action would have a negative connotation and would be interpreted as sanitizing history.

In addition, a 2006 ruling by a federal appeals court had successfully granted a &quot;temporary halt&quot; to the FCC&#x27;s enforcement of its indecency rules. This allowed CBS and any affiliates to air the documentary without edits and without fear of facing stiff fines.

The DVD of the documentary was released in proximity, with De Niro&#x27;s footage edited from it. CBS re-aired the film, hosted again by De Niro, on September 10, 2006, the night before the fifth anniversary of the attacks. This version contained updates from the principal subjects of the documentary, as of 2006.

On September 11, 2011, CBS broadcast &quot;9/11: Ten Years Later,&quot; once again hosted by De Niro. The aftershow was updated by the Naudet brothers, Hanlon and CBS News producer Susan Zirinsky to include new interviews and footage on the lives of those who had been shown in the documentary ten years later. The program also focused on the construction of the new One World Trade Center, and on the health problems faced by many of the firemen who had served at Ground Zero, where they were exposed to burning contaminants. DeNiro was joined by the Naudet brothers and James Hanlon, a former New York fireman-turned-film director who was also present that day. As with all previous broadcasts of the film, CBS aired repeated viewer discretion warnings before and during the broadcast.

In 2016, CNN picked up the rights to show the film for the fifteenth anniversary of the attacks, executive produced and directed and updates by James Hanlon, this time hosted by Denis Leary.

==Awards==
&quot;9/11&quot; was nominated for and won many awards, including an Emmy for Outstanding Non-Fiction Special (Informational) and a Peabody Award.

<text>CodeWeavers is a software company that focuses on Wine development and sells a proprietary version of Wine called CrossOver for running Windows applications on macOS, ChromeOS and Linux. The company was founded in 1996 as a consultancy, eventually moving entirely over to Wine development and support.

CodeWeavers is the principal corporate sponsor of the Wine project, hosts Wine&#x27;s website, helps sponsor the Wine conference, employs many Wine developers, and is a major code contributor to Wine. CodeWeavers claims that two-thirds of all commits to Wine come from their developers. The company also employs Wine&#x27;s primary maintainer, Alexandre Julliard, as its CTO. While CodeWeavers main commercial interest in Wine is its use in the Crossover product, they also encourage enhancements to Wine that sometimes compete with Crossover.

CodeWeavers also employs some developers of wine-mono, an open-source reimplementation of Microsoft .NET framework (4.x and earlier) which is intended as a replacement for the .NET Framework in Wine. Wine-mono is a branch of Mono which has been tailored to work with Wine.

Since 2016, CodeWeavers has been contracted to work with Valve on Proton, a compatibility layer for running Windows games through Steam on Linux.

CodeWeavers is a founding member of the Desktop Linux Consortium.

CodeWeavers&#x27; products and services include CrossOver, PortJump, and ExecMode. 

In April 2023, CodeWeavers transitioned to an employee ownership trust. Jeremy White stepped down as CEO and company president James Ramey assumed the role.

== CrossOver ==
For CrossOver, the company originally focused on making the Microsoft Office suite and other supported productivity software available on Linux. When Apple switched to Intel processors in 2006 CodeWeavers was able to create CrossOver Mac and bring Wine to Mac OS X. Other major supported applications include the financial software Quicken and the Steam game client.

Former products include CrossOver Plugin, CrossOver Server and CrossOver Games. Plugin was made to run browser plugins such as Flash and ActiveX in Linux. CrossOver Server was a product designed for multi-user environments. CrossOver Games was introduced in March 2008 and was intended to allow gaming-related patches from Wine to be incorporated into CrossOver much faster. In 2012 all versions have had the server, plugin, and games functionality merged into the primary CrossOver products.

== PortJump ==
CodeWeavers provides porting services (known as PortJump) around Wine. Google has paid CodeWeavers to improve support for Adobe Photoshop and add functionality to Wine.

== ExecMode ==
CodeWeavers provides consulting services (known as ExecMode). These services revolve around writing open-source code for enterprise level clients. The main difference from PortJump is that these services do not use Wine, but instead focus on other open-source technologies.

==Great American Lame Duck Presidential Challenge==
In July 2008, CodeWeavers launched the &quot;Great American Lame Duck Presidential Challenge&quot; to encourage President Bush to make the most of his remaining days in office by accomplishing a major economic or political goal by January 20, 2009.

The goals focused on President Bush making specific positive accomplishments in areas such as the economy, home values, the stock market, the war on terror and other key issues. Specifically, one goal called for President Bush to help bring down average gasoline prices in the Twin Cities to $2.79 a gallon.

On October 14, gas prices in Minneapolis and St. Paul fell to $2.79 a gallon, and CodeWeavers honored their pledge giving away their software for no charge on October 28, 2008. Traffic via Slashdot, Digg, and other sources overloaded and brought down the CodeWeavers website as people rushed to get the free-of-charge software. According to CodeWeavers, &quot;You will be able to unlock your serial number that was emailed to you for an extended time, (an additional 48 hours), due to this downtime. We will simply stop giving out new serial numbers at 23:59 (Midnight) Central Standard Time.&quot;

Additionally, CodeWeavers updated their site to reflect the statement: &quot;Please check back again for registration code information later today. We will be deploying a streamlined serial code generation process shortly.&quot; At the same time, they also added an &quot;about Wine&quot; paragraph.

The streamlined process came to pass, but customers were told to expect to wait &quot;several days&quot; to receive their serial number. In the interim, fully unlocked (full builds) of four different CodeWeavers packages became available for immediate download, but only on October 28, 2008.

<text>Charles &quot;Pete&quot; Conrad Jr. (June 2, 1930 – July 8, 1999) was an American NASA astronaut, aeronautical engineer, naval officer, aviator, and test pilot who commanded the Apollo 12 mission, on which he became the third person to walk on the Moon. Conrad was selected for NASA&#x27;s second astronaut class in 1962.

Conrad was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Despite having dyslexia, he earned his Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical engineering from Princeton University—being the first Ivy League astronaut—and joined the U.S. Navy. In 1954, Conrad received his naval aviator wings, served as a fighter pilot and, after graduating from the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School (Class 20), as a project test pilot. In 1959, he was an astronaut candidate for Project Mercury.

Conrad set an eight-day space endurance record in 1965 along with his Command Pilot Gordon Cooper on his first spaceflight, Gemini 5. Later, Conrad commanded Gemini 11 in 1966, and Apollo 12 in 1969. After Apollo, he commanded Skylab 2, the first crewed Skylab mission, in 1973. On the mission, he and his crewmates repaired significant launch damage to the Skylab space station. For this, President Jimmy Carter awarded him the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1978.

After Conrad retired from NASA and the Navy in 1973, he became a vice president of American Television and Communications Company. He went on to work for McDonnell Douglas, as a vice president. During his tenure, he served as vice president of marketing, senior vice president of marketing, staff vice president of international business development, and vice president of project development. Conrad died in 1999, from internal injuries sustained in a motorcycle accident, aged 69.

== Early life and education ==
Charles Conrad Jr. Conrad was born on June 2, 1930, in Philadelphia, the third child and the first son of Charles Conrad Sr. (1892–1969) and Frances De Rappelage Conrad ( Vinson; 1899–1981), into a well-to-do real estate and banking family.

The Great Depression wiped out the Conrad family&#x27;s fortune, just as it had those of so many others. In 1942, the family lost their manor home in Philadelphia, and then moved into a small carriage house, paid for by Frances&#x27;s brother, Egerton Vinson. Eventually, Charles Sr., broken down by financial failures, left his family.

Conrad was considered a bright, intelligent boy, but he continually struggled with his schoolwork. He had dyslexia, a condition little understood at the time. Conrad attended the Haverford School, a private academy in Haverford, Pennsylvania, that previous generations of Conrads had attended. Even after his family&#x27;s financial downturn, his uncle Egerton supported his continued schooling at Haverford. However, Pete&#x27;s dyslexia continued to frustrate his academic efforts. After he failed most of his 11th grade exams, Haverford expelled him from school.

Conrad&#x27;s mother refused to believe that her son was unintelligent, and she set about finding him a suitable school. She found Darrow School in New Lebanon, New York. There, Conrad learned how to apply a systems approach to learning, and thus found a way to work around his dyslexia. Despite having to repeat the 11th grade, Conrad so excelled at Darrow that after his graduation in 1949, he not only was admitted to Princeton University, but he was also awarded a full Navy ROTC scholarship. While at Darrow, although he was only and weighed , Conrad started as the center on his football team and became the team captain. &quot;He was a very tough boy, and we won our share of games,&quot; said the school&#x27;s assistant headmaster.

Starting when he was 15 years old, Conrad worked during the summertime at the Paoli Airfield near Paoli, Pennsylvania, bartering lawn mowing, sweeping, and other odd jobs for airplane flights and occasional instructional time. He learned more about the mechanics and workings of aircraft and aircraft engines, and then he graduated to minor maintenance work. When he was 16, he drove almost to help a flight instructor whose airplane had been forced to make an emergency landing. Conrad repaired the plane single-handedly. Thereafter, the instructor gave Conrad the flight lessons that he needed to earn his pilot&#x27;s certificate even before he graduated from high school.

Conrad continued flying while he was in college, not only keeping his pilot&#x27;s certificate, but also earning an instrument flight rating. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical engineering from Princeton in 1953, after completing a 200-page-long senior thesis titled &quot;The Design of a Turbo-Jet Military Advanced Trainer&quot; with Richard V. Warden, Richard W. Vannata, and Calvin H. Perrine. He was commissioned an Ensign in the U.S. Navy as a Naval ROTC graduate.

== Aviation career in the U.S. Navy ==

Following his commission in 1953, Conrad was sent to Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, for flight training. He was also trained at the Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, Texas. He was designated a Naval Aviator in September 1954 and became a fighter pilot. He excelled in Navy flight school, and he served for several years as an aircraft carrier-based fighter pilot in the Navy. Conrad also served as a flight instructor in Navy flight schools along the Gulf of Mexico.

Next, Conrad applied for and was accepted by the United States Naval Test Pilot School at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Patuxent, Maryland. His classmates were future fellow astronauts Wally Schirra and Jim Lovell. He graduated in 1958, as part of Class 20, and was assigned as a Project Test Pilot. Conrad became a captain in the U.S. Navy on December 11, 1969.

During this period, Conrad was invited to take part in the selection process for the first group of astronauts for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) (the &quot;Mercury Seven&quot;). Conrad, like his fellow candidates, underwent several days of what they considered to be invasive, demeaning, and unnecessary medical and psychological testing at the Lovelace Clinic in New Mexico. Unlike his fellow candidates, Conrad rebelled against the regimen. During a Rorschach inkblot test, he told the psychiatrist that one blot card revealed a sexual encounter complete with lurid detail. When shown a blank card, he turned it around, pushed it back and replied, &quot;It&#x27;s upside down&quot;.

Then when he was asked to deliver a stool sample to the onsite lab, he placed it in a gift box and tied a red ribbon around it. Eventually, he decided that he had had enough. After dropping his full enema bag on the desk of the clinic&#x27;s commanding officer, he walked out. His initial application to NASA was denied with the notation &quot;not suitable for long-duration flight.&quot;

After his NASA episode, Conrad returned to the Navy as a fighter pilot, serving in the Pacific Fleet&#x27;s second operational F-4 Phantom II squadron, VF-96, on board . Thereafter, when NASA announced its search for a second group of astronauts, Mercury veteran Alan Shepard, who knew Conrad from their time as naval aviators and test pilots, approached Conrad and persuaded him to reapply. This time, Conrad found the medical tests less invasive, and in June 1962 he was selected to join NASA.

He logged more than 6,500 hours of flying time, with more than 5,000 hours in jet aircraft.

==NASA career==
===Project Gemini===

Conrad joined NASA as part of the second group of astronauts, known as the New Nine, on September 17, 1962. Regarded as one of the best pilots in the group, he was among the first of his group to be assigned a Gemini mission. As pilot of Gemini 5 he, along with his commander Gordon Cooper, set a new space endurance record of eight days. The duration of the Gemini 5 flight was actually 7 days 22 hours and 55 minutes, surpassing the then-current Russian record of five days. Eight days was the time required for the first crewed lunar landing missions. Conrad facetiously referred to the Gemini 5 capsule as &quot;a flying garbage can&quot;.

Conrad tested many spacecraft systems essential to the Apollo program. He was also one of the smallest of the astronauts, tall, so he found the confinement of the Gemini capsule less onerous than his Commander Gordon Cooper did. He was then named commander of the Gemini 8 backup crew, and later commander of Gemini 11 with pilot Richard Gordon. Gemini 11 docked with an Agena target vehicle immediately after achieving orbit. Such a maneuver was an engineering and flight test similar to what the Apollo Command Module (CM) and Lunar Module (LM) would later be required to do. Also, the Gemini 11 flight holds the distinction of being the highest-apogee crewed Earth orbit ever, reaching an apogee of .

===Apollo program===


Conrad was assigned in December 1966 to command the backup crew for the first Earth orbital test flight of the complete Apollo spacecraft, including the Lunar Module (LM) into low Earth orbit. Delays in the LM&#x27;s development pushed this mission to December 1968 as Apollo 8. But when one more delay occurred in readying the first LM for crewed flight, NASA approved and scheduled a lunar orbit mission without the LM as Apollo 8, pushing Conrad&#x27;s backup mission to Apollo 9 in March 1969. Director of Flight Crew Operations Deke Slayton&#x27;s practice was to assign a backup crew as the prime crew on the third following mission. If the swap of 8 and 9 had not occurred, Conrad might have commanded Apollo 11, the first mission to land on the Moon.

On November 14, 1969, Apollo 12 was launched with Conrad as commander, Dick Gordon as Command Module Pilot, and Alan Bean as Lunar Module Pilot. The launch was the most harrowing of the Apollo program, as a series of lightning strikes just after liftoff temporarily knocked out power and guidance in the Command Module. Five days later, after stepping down from the ladder of the Lunar Module onto a landing pad, Conrad joked about his own small stature by remarking:

He later revealed that he said this in order to win a bet he had made with the Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci for $500 to prove that NASA did not script astronaut comments. Fallaci was convinced that Armstrong&#x27;s &quot;One small step for man&quot; statement had been written for him and was not his own words. 

Conrad&#x27;s &quot;long one&quot; referred to the jump from the Lunar Module&#x27;s ladder to a landing pad, whereas Armstrong&#x27;s &quot;small step&quot; referred to the small step from the landing pad onto the Moon&#x27;s surface. Conrad&#x27;s first words on the lunar surface were:
One of the photos that Conrad took during the mission with his own image visible on the helmet visor of Alan Bean was later listed on &quot;Popular Science&quot;″s photo gallery of the best astronaut selfies.

===Skylab===
Conrad&#x27;s final mission was as commander of Skylab 2, the first crew to board the Skylab space station. The station had been damaged on its uncrewed launch, when its micrometeoroid shield tore away, taking one of two main solar panels with it and jamming the other one so that it could not deploy. Conrad and his crew repaired the damage on two spacewalks. Conrad managed to pull free the stuck solar panel by sheer brute force, an action of which he was particularly proud. The astronauts also erected a &quot;parasol&quot; solar shield to protect the station from intense solar heating, a function which the lost micrometeoroid shield was supposed to perform. Without the shield, Skylab and its contents would have become unusable. President Jimmy Carter honored Conrad for this in 1978 by awarding him the Congressional Space Medal of Honor.

During his training for Skylab 2, Conrad had to bail out from NASA T-38 N957NA on May 10, 1972. He was returning to Houston from a visit to ILC Industries in Delaware. On approach to Ellington AFB he was advised that the weather had deteriorated below minimums so he diverted to Hobby. During the night, instrument flight rules (IFR) descent, he suffered a generator failure at 800 feet and broke off the approach. He elected to divert to an airfield with better weather. He ran out of fuel as he reached Bergstrom AFB and was forced to eject at 3,700 feet. He landed about 100 yards from the base operations building and his airplane impacted in an open field about two miles away.

==Post-NASA career==

Conrad retired from NASA and the Navy in 1973, and went to work for American Television and Communications Company. He started as the vice president of operations and chief operating officer. Conrad was in charge of the operation of existing systems and the national development of new cable television systems.

In 1976, Conrad accepted a position with McDonnell Douglas as a vice president and consultant. In 1978, he became vice president of marketing and was responsible for the commercial and military sales of Douglas Aircraft Company. After an engine fell off a McDonnell Douglas DC-10, causing it to crash with the loss of all passengers and crew in 1979, Conrad spearheaded McDonnell Douglas&#x27;s ultimately unsuccessful efforts to allay the fears of the public and policymakers, and save the plane&#x27;s reputation. In 1980, he was promoted to senior vice president of marketing. From 1982 to 1984, Conrad served as the senior vice president of marketing and product support. He was appointed staff vice president of international business development in 1984. During the 1990s he consulted for the Delta Clipper experimental single-stage-to-orbit launch vehicle. He became vice president of project development in 1993.

On February 14, 1996, Conrad was part of the crew on a record-breaking around-the-world flight in a Learjet owned by cable TV pioneer, Bill Daniels. The flight lasted 49 hours, 26 minutes and 8 seconds. Today the jet is on permanent static display at Denver International Airport&#x27;s Terminal C.

A month before he died, Conrad appeared on ABC News &quot;Nightline&quot; and said, &quot;I think the Space Shuttle is worth one billion dollars a launch. I think that it is worth two billion dollars for what it does. I think the Shuttle is worth it for the work it does.&quot; In the last interview he gave before his death, Conrad sat down for PBS&#x27;s &quot;Nova&quot; series and discussed where he felt the future direction of space travel should go. He considered returning to the Moon &quot;a waste of taxpayer money&quot;, but recommended missions to Mars and asteroids.

In 2006, NASA posthumously awarded him the Ambassador of Exploration Award for his work for the agency and science.

==Personal life==
While at Princeton, Conrad met Jane DuBose, a student at Bryn Mawr, whose family owned a ranch near Uvalde, Texas. Her father, Winn DuBose, was the first person to call Conrad &quot;Pete&quot; rather than &quot;Peter&quot;, the name he had used since birth. Upon his graduation from Princeton and acceptance of his navy commission, Conrad and Jane were married on June 16, 1953. They had four sons.

Given the demands of his career in the Navy and NASA, Conrad and Jane spent considerable time apart, and Conrad saw less of his sons than he would have liked. In 1988, Conrad and Jane divorced, both later remarrying.

In 1989, Conrad&#x27;s youngest son, Christopher, was diagnosed with a malignant lymphoma. He died in April 1990, at the age of 29.

Conrad met Nancy Crane, a Denver divorcee, through mutual friends. Conrad and Crane married in 1990.

Conrad was a Cub Scout. His recreational interests included golf, water skiing and auto racing, such as Formula Vee.

==Death==
Conrad died on July 8, 1999, from internal injuries sustained in a motorcycle accident. While traveling with his wife and friends from his Huntington Beach home to Monterey, California, his motorcycle crashed on a turn. Conrad later died in a hospital in Ojai. He was wearing a helmet at the time and was operating within the speed limit. He was buried with full honours at Arlington National Cemetery, with many Apollo-era astronauts in attendance and a performance of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; by music legend Willie Nelson.

The Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas has a grove of trees that have been planted to honour the memory of the astronauts who have died. After Conrad&#x27;s death, NASA planted a tree in his honour. During the dedication ceremony, his Apollo 12 crewmate Alan Bean used his speech to lighten the sombre occasion by injecting a little levity, pretending to &quot;channel&quot; Conrad&#x27;s instructions from the hereafter. Bean said Conrad wanted NASA to light his tree every Christmas season with coloured lights instead of the white used for everyone else, in keeping with his motto &quot;when you can&#x27;t be good, be colourful&quot;. NASA has honoured this request, and every Christmas since then, all of the trees in the grove have been lit with white lights—except Conrad&#x27;s tree, which has been lit with red lights.

<text>The Telnarian Histories are a series of five space opera novels by American writer John Norman; the first three were published between 1991 and 1993. 
The setting of the novels is a galactic realm closely parallel to the later history of the Roman Empire and its wars with Germanic barbarians. The ruling family of the empire is human, but extraterrestrials exist, while individuals pursue destinies of freedom and slavery. The depiction of slavery in the books resembles that found in the &quot;Gor&quot; series, with female slaves dominated by male masters.

==Books==
The individual books in the series are:

* &quot;The Chieftain&quot; (1991) 
* &quot;The Captain&quot; (1992) 
* &quot;The King&quot; (1993) 
* &quot;The Usurper&quot; (2015)
* &quot;The Emperor&quot; (2019)

==Reception ==
Many fans of Norman&#x27;s &quot;Gor&quot; novel series didn&#x27;t like the &quot;Telnarian&quot; books as much. One novel concept explored in the second and third books of the series is that of Dira, the goddess of love and beauty in the pantheon of the Telnarian Empire, is also the goddess of slave girls and is herself enslaved among the gods.

<doc id="185064" wikidata="Q2083901" url="?curid=185064" title="Fingerprince">
<text>Fingerprince is the third studio album by American art rock group the Residents, released in 1977. It was allegedly intended to be a three-sided record titled &quot;Tourniquet of Roses,&quot; but due to financial difficulties in fulfilling such a project, the record was instead cut down to a regular two-sided album.

The album is considered a transitional period for the Residents, between the early avant-garde stylings of &quot;Meet the Residents&quot; and &quot;The Third Reich &#x27;n Roll&quot; and the minimalist song structures of &quot;Duck Stab&quot; and &quot;Commercial Album&quot;.

== Music ==
&quot;Fingerprince&#x27;s&quot; first side consists of short, minimalist songs featuring skeletal drum machines, emphasized horn and percussion sections, murky atmospherics (except for the upbeat &quot;You Yesyesyes&quot;) and a bigger focus on vocals and lyrics.

The second side consists of one 17-minute track titled &quot;Six Things to a Cycle&quot;, originally written as a ballet. It is an instrumental suite composed of six movements, with a strong focus on percussion and repetition of a single motif. Eventually the improvised percussion is joined by wordless vocals, keyboards, horns and violins.

A third side of music was planned for the album before the decision to release it as a standard single LP. This third side was eventually released in 1979 as an EP titled &quot;Babyfingers,&quot; which mirrors the standard LP – short songs on one side, a single long composition on the other side.

== Release history ==
For the CD release of &quot;Fingerprince,&quot; all of the songs from &quot;Babyfingers,&quot; which were originally supposed to be part of the record, were included in their original running order.

The 1995 Euro Ralph CD reissue of &quot;Fingerprince&quot; kept the original track order from the original LP but included the complete &quot;Babyfingers&quot; as a bonus 3&quot; CD with the album. All subsequent reissues of the album include all three sides, with slight alterations in the track order.

== Reception ==

In the December 31, 1977, issue of &quot;Sounds&quot;, Jon Savage notes that this album is more accessible than the band&#x27;s first two albums, comparing it to Steely Dan and Frank Zappa &quot;put through 10 years and a considerable warp.&quot; He also compares the Residents&#x27; integrity and outrage to the first punk &quot;explosion.&quot; Andy Gill of &quot;New Musical Express&quot; compared the second side of the album to Harry Partch.

<text>An antihero (sometimes spelled as anti-hero or two words anti hero) or anti-heroine is a main character in a narrative (in literature, film, TV, etc.) who may lack some conventional heroic qualities and attributes, such as idealism and morality. Although antiheroes may sometimes perform actions that most of the audience considers morally correct, their reasons for doing so may not align with the audience&#x27;s morality.

Antihero is a literary term that can be understood as standing in opposition to the traditional hero, i.e., one with high social status, well liked by the general populace. Past the surface, scholars have additional requirements for the antihero.

The &quot;Racinian&quot; antihero is defined by three factors. The first is that the antihero is doomed to fail before their adventure begins. The second constitutes the blame of that failure on everyone but themselves. Thirdly, they offer a critique of social morals and reality. To other scholars, an antihero is inherently a hero from a specific point of view, and a villain from another.

Typically, an antihero is the focal point of conflict in a story, whether as the protagonist or as the antagonistic force. This is due to the antihero&#x27;s engagement in the conflict, typically of their own will, rather than a specific calling to serve the greater good. As such, the antihero focuses on their personal motives first and foremost, with everything else secondary.

== History ==
An early antihero is Homer&#x27;s Thersites, since he serves to voice criticism, showcasing an anti-establishment stance. The concept has also been identified in classical Greek drama, Roman satire, and Renaissance literature such as &quot;Don Quixote&quot; and the picaresque rogue.

An anti-hero that fits the more contemporary notion of the term is the lower-caste warrior Karna in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. Karna is the sixth brother of the Pandavas (symbolising &quot;good&quot;), born out of wedlock, and raised by a lower-caste charioteer. He is ridiculed by the Pandavas, but accepted as an excellent warrior by the antagonist Duryodhana, thus becoming a loyal friend to him, eventually fighting on the &quot;wrong&quot; side of the final just war. Karna serves as a critique of the then-society, the protagonists, as well as the idea of the war being worthwhile itself – even if Krishna later justifies it properly.

The term antihero was first used as early as 1714, emerging in works such as &quot;Rameau&#x27;s Nephew&quot; in the 18th century, and is also used more broadly to cover Byronic heroes as well, created by the English poet Lord Byron.

Literary Romanticism in the 19th century helped popularize new forms of the antihero, such as the Gothic double. The antihero eventually became an established form of social criticism, a phenomenon often associated with the unnamed protagonist in Fyodor Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;Notes from Underground&quot;. The antihero emerged as a foil to the traditional hero archetype, a process that Northrop Frye called the fictional &quot;center of gravity&quot;. This movement indicated a literary change in heroic ethos from feudal aristocrat to urban democrat, as was the shift from epic to ironic narratives.

Huckleberry Finn (1884) has been called &quot;the first antihero in the American nursery&quot;. Charlotte Mullen of Somerville and Ross&#x27;s &quot;The Real Charlotte&quot; (1894) has been described as an anti-heroine.

The antihero became prominent in early 20th-century existentialist works such as Franz Kafka&#x27;s &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot; (1915), Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s &quot;Nausea&quot; (1938), and Albert Camus&#x27;s &quot;The Stranger&quot; (1942). The protagonist in these works is an indecisive central character who drifts through his life and is marked by boredom, angst, and alienation.

The antihero entered American literature in the 1950s and up to the mid-1960s as an alienated figure, unable to communicate. The American antihero of the 1950s and 1960s was typically more proactive than his French counterpart. The British version of the antihero emerged in the works of the &quot;angry young men&quot; of the 1950s. The collective protests of Sixties counterculture saw the solitary antihero gradually eclipsed from fictional prominence, though not without subsequent revivals in literary and cinematic form.
During the Golden Age of Television from the 2000s and into early 2020s, antiheroes such as Tony Soprano, Gru, Megamind, Jack Bauer, Gregory House, Dexter Morgan, Walter White, Frank Underwood, Don Draper, Neal Caffrey, Nucky Thompson, Jax Teller, Alicia Florrick, Annalise Keating, Selina Meyer and Kendall Roy became prominent in the most popular and critically acclaimed TV shows.

In his essay published in 2020, &quot;Postheroic Heroes – A Contemporary Image&quot; (German: &quot;Postheroische Helden – Ein Zeitbild&quot;), German sociologist Ulrich Bröckling examines the simultaneity of heroic and post-heroic role models as an opportunity to explore the place of the heroic in contemporary society. In contemporary art, artists such as the French multimedia artist Thomas Liu Le Lann negotiate in his series of &quot;Soft Heroes&quot;, in which overburdened, modern and tired Anti Heroes seem to have given up on the world around them.

===Comic book anti-heroes===
In American mainstream comic books, anti-heroes have become increasingly popular since the 1970s. The comic book version is generally a variation on the formula of superheroes. As Suzana Flores describes it, a comic book antihero is &quot;often psychologically damaged, simultaneously depicted as superior due to his superhuman abilities and inferior due to his impetuousness, irrationality, or lack of thoughtful evaluation.&quot; Particularly well-known comic book anti-heroes include Wolverine, Punisher, Marv, Spawn, and Deadpool. These characters have all been adapted into feature films, as well.

<text>Time Slave is a 1975 hybrid of historical fiction and science fiction by John Norman. In this book, Norman presents his personal theories of human evolution, exemplified by the case of a modern 20th century woman sent back in time 50,000 years or more; he mourns the loss of human evolutionary fitness and distortion of &quot;natural&quot; social relations which, in his view, occurred when farming spread and farmers squeezed hunter/gatherers to the ecological margins. &quot;Time Slave&quot; features Norman&#x27;s social philosophy of male-dominance (as also in his &quot;Gor&quot; series), and expresses an unexplained connection between female sexual subordination and the speeding up of the development of space travel.

<text>Relevance logic, also called relevant logic, is a kind of non-classical logic requiring the antecedent and consequent of implications to be relevantly related. They may be viewed as a family of substructural or modal logics. It is generally, but not universally, called &quot;relevant logic&quot; by British and, especially, Australian logicians, and &quot;relevance logic&quot; by American logicians.

Relevance logic aims to capture aspects of implication that are ignored by the &quot;material implication&quot; operator in classical truth-functional logic, namely the notion of relevance between antecedent and conditional of a true implication. This idea is not new: C. I. Lewis was led to invent modal logic, and specifically strict implication, on the grounds that classical logic grants paradoxes of material implication such as the principle that a falsehood implies any proposition. Hence &quot;if I&#x27;m a donkey, then two and two is four&quot; is true when translated as a material implication, yet it seems intuitively false since a true implication must tie the antecedent and consequent together by some notion of relevance. And whether or not the speaker is a donkey seems in no way relevant to whether two and two is four.

In terms of a syntactical constraint for a propositional calculus, it is necessary, but not sufficient, that premises and conclusion share atomic formulae (formulae that do not contain any logical connectives). In a predicate calculus, relevance requires sharing of variables and constants between premises and conclusion. This can be ensured (along with stronger conditions) by, e.g., placing certain restrictions on the rules of a natural deduction system. In particular, a Fitch-style natural deduction can be adapted to accommodate relevance by introducing tags at the end of each line of an application of an inference indicating the premises relevant to the conclusion of the inference. Gentzen-style sequent calculi can be modified by removing the weakening rules that allow for the introduction of arbitrary formulae on the right or left side of the sequents.

A notable feature of relevance logics is that they are paraconsistent logics: the existence of a contradiction will not necessarily cause an &quot;explosion.&quot; This follows from the fact that a conditional with a contradictory antecedent that does not share any propositional or predicate letters with the consequent cannot be true (or derivable).

==History==

Relevance logic was proposed in 1928 by Soviet philosopher Ivan E. Orlov (1886 – circa 1936) in his strictly mathematical paper &quot;The Logic of Compatibility of Propositions&quot; published in &quot;Matematicheskii Sbornik&quot;. The basic idea of relevant implication appears in medieval logic, and some pioneering work was done by Ackermann, Moh, and Church in the 1950s. Drawing on them, Nuel Belnap and Alan Ross Anderson (with others) wrote the &quot;magnum opus&quot; of the subject, &quot;Entailment: The Logic of Relevance and Necessity&quot; in the 1970s (the second volume being published in the nineties). They focused on both systems of entailment and systems of relevance, where implications of the former kinds are supposed to be both relevant and necessary.

==Axioms==
The early developments in relevance logic focused on the stronger systems. The development of the Routley–Meyer semantics brought out a range of weaker logics. The weakest of these logics is the relevance logic B. It is axiomatized with the following axioms and rules.
# formula_1
# formula_2
# formula_3
# formula_4
# formula_5
# formula_6
# formula_7
# formula_8
# formula_9
The rules are the following.
# formula_10
# formula_11
# formula_12
# formula_13
# formula_14
Stronger logics can be obtained by adding any of the following axioms.
# formula_15
# formula_16
# formula_17
# formula_18
# formula_19
# formula_20
# formula_21
# formula_22
# formula_23
# formula_24
# formula_25
# formula_26
There are some notable logics stronger than B that can be obtained by adding axioms to B as follows.
* For DW, add axiom 1.
* For DJ, add axioms 1, 2.
* For TW, add axioms 1, 2, 3, 4.
* For RW, add axioms 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9.
* For T, add axioms 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11.
* For R, add axioms 1-11.
* For E, add axioms 1-7, 10, 11, formula_27, and formula_28, where formula_29 is defined as formula_30.
* For RM, add all the additional axioms.

==Models==
===Routley–Meyer models===
The standard model theory for relevance logics is the Routley-Meyer ternary-relational semantics developed by Richard Routley and Robert Meyer. A Routley–Meyer frame F for a propositional language is a quadruple (W,R,*,0), where W is a non-empty set, R is a ternary relation on W, and * is a function from W to W, and formula_31. A Routley-Meyer model M is a Routley-Meyer frame F together with a valuation, formula_32, that assigns a truth value to each atomic proposition relative to each point formula_33. There are some conditions placed on Routley-Meyer frames. Define formula_34 as formula_35.
* formula_36.
* If formula_34 and formula_38, then formula_39.
* If formula_40 and formula_41, then formula_42.
* formula_43.
* If formula_34, then formula_45.
Write formula_46 and formula_47 to indicate that the formula formula_48 is true, or not true, respectively, at point formula_49 in formula_50. 
One final condition on Routley-Meyer models is the hereditariness condition.
* If formula_51 and formula_34, then formula_53, for all atomic propositions formula_54.
By an inductive argument, hereditariness can be shown to extend to complex formulas, using the truth conditions below.
* If formula_46 and formula_34, then formula_57, for all formulas formula_48.

The truth conditions for complex formulas are as follows.
* formula_59 and formula_60
* formula_61 or formula_60
* formula_63
* formula_64

A formula formula_48 holds in a model formula_50 just in case formula_67. A formula formula_48 holds on a frame formula_69 iff A holds in every model formula_70. A formula formula_48 is valid in a class of frames iff A holds on every frame in that class. 
The class of all Routley–Meyer frames satisfying the above conditions validates that relevance logic B. One can obtain Routley-Meyer frames for other relevance logics by placing appropriate restrictions on R and on *. These conditions are easier to state using some standard definitions. Let formula_72 be defined as formula_73, and let formula_74 be defined as formula_75. Some of the frame conditions and the axioms they validate are the following.

The last two conditions validate forms of weakening that relevance logics were originally developed to avoid. They are included to show the flexibility of the Routley–Meyer models.

===Operational models===
====Urquhart models====
Operational models for negation-free fragments of relevance logics were developed by Alasdair Urquhart in his PhD thesis and in subsequent work. The intuitive idea behind the operational models is that points in a model are pieces of information, and combining information supporting a conditional with the information supporting its antecedent yields some information that supports the consequent. Since the operational models do not generally interpret negation, this section will consider only languages with a conditional, conjunction, and disjunction.

An operational frame formula_69 is a triple formula_77, where formula_78 is a non-empty set, formula_79, and formula_80 is a binary operation on formula_78. Frames have conditions, some of which may be dropped to model different logics. The conditions Urquhart proposed to model the conditional of the relevance logic R are the following.
* formula_82
* formula_83
* formula_84
* formula_85
Under these conditions, the operational frame is a join-semilattice.

An operational model formula_50 is a frame formula_69 with a valuation formula_88 that maps pairs of points and atomic propositions to truth values, T or F. formula_88 can be extended to a valuation formula_32 on complex formulas as follows.
* formula_91, for atomic propositions
* formula_59 and formula_60
* formula_61 or formula_60
* formula_96

A formula formula_48 holds in a model formula_50 iff formula_67. A formula formula_48 is valid in a class of models formula_101 iff it holds in each model formula_102.

The conditional fragment of R is sound and complete with respect to the class of semilattice models. The logic with conjunction and disjunction is properly stronger than the conditional, conjunction, disjunction fragment of R. In particular, the formula formula_103 is valid for the operational models but it is invalid in R. The logic generated by the operational models for R has a complete axiomatic proof system, due Kit Fine and to Gerald Charlwood. Charlwood also provided a natural deduction system for the logic, which he proved equivalent to the axiomatic system. Charlwood showed that his natural deduction system is equivalent to a system provided by Dag Prawitz.

The operational semantics can be adapted to model the conditional of E by adding a non-empty set of worlds formula_104 and an accessibility relation formula_105 on formula_106 to the frames. The accessibility relation is required to be reflexive and transitive, to capture the idea that E&#x27;s conditional has an S4 necessity. The valuations then map triples of atomic propositions, points, and worlds to truth values. The truth condition for the conditional is changed to the following. 
* formula_107

The operational semantics can be adapted to model the conditional of T by adding a relation formula_105 on formula_109. The relation is required to obey the following conditions.
* formula_110
* If formula_111 and formula_112, then formula_113
* If formula_111, then formula_115
The truth condition for the conditional is changed to the following.
* formula_116

There are two ways to model the contraction-less relevance logics TW and RW with the operational models. The first way is to drop the condition that formula_82. The second way is to keep the semilattice conditions on frames and add a binary relation, formula_118, of disjointness to the frame. For these models, the truth conditions for the conditional is changed to the following, with the addition of the ordering in the case of TW.
* formula_119

====Humberstone models====
Urquhart showed that the semilattice logic for R is properly stronger than the positive fragment of R. Lloyd Humberstone provided an enrichment of the operational models that permitted a different truth condition for disjunction. The resulting class of models generates exactly the positive fragment of R.

An operational frame formula_69 is a quadruple formula_121, where formula_78 is a non-empty set, formula_79, and {formula_80, formula_125} are binary operations on formula_78. Let formula_34 be defined as formula_128. The frame conditions are the following.
An operational model formula_50 is a frame formula_69 with a valuation formula_88 that maps pairs of points and atomic propositions to truth values, T or F. formula_88 can be extended to a valuation formula_32 on complex formulas as follows.
* formula_91, for atomic propositions
* formula_135 and formula_53
* formula_137 and formula_60
* formula_61 or formula_60 or formula_141; formula_57 and formula_143
* formula_96

A formula formula_48 holds in a model formula_50 iff formula_67. A formula formula_48 is valid in a class of models formula_101 iff it holds in each model formula_102.

The positive fragment of R is sound and complete with respect to the class of these models. Humberstone&#x27;s semantics can be adapted to model different logics by dropping or adding frame conditions as follows.
===Algebraic models===
Some relevance logics can be given algebraic models, such as the logic R. The algebraic structures for R are de Morgan monoids, which are sextuples formula_151 where
* formula_152 is a distributive lattice with a unary operation, formula_153 obeying the laws formula_154 and if formula_111 then formula_156;
* formula_157, the binary operation formula_158 is commutative (formula_159) and associative (formula_160), and formula_161, i.e. formula_162 is an Abelian monoid with identity formula_163;
* the monoid is lattice-ordered and satisfies formula_164;
* formula_165; and 
* if formula_166, then formula_167.
The operation formula_168 interpreting the conditional of R is defined as formula_169. 
A de Morgan monoid is a residuated lattice, obeying the following residuation condition. 
: formula_170

An interpretation formula_171 is a homomorphism from the propositional language to a de Morgan monoid formula_50 such that 
* formula_173 for all atomic propositions, 
* formula_174
* formula_175
* formula_176
* formula_177

Given a de Morgan monoid formula_50 and an interpretation formula_171, one can say that formula formula_48 holds on formula_171 just in case formula_182. A formula formula_48 is valid just in case it holds on all interpretations on all de Morgan monoids. The logic R is sound and complete for de Morgan monoids.

<text>Ulundi, also known as Mahlabathini, is a town in the Zululand District Municipality. At one time the capital of the Zulu Kingdom in South Africa and later the capital of the Bantustan of KwaZulu, Ulundi now lies in KwaZulu-Natal Province (of which, from 1994 to 2004, it alternated with Pietermaritzburg as the provincial capital). The town now includes Ulundi Airport, a three-star hotel, and some museums amongst its sights. In the 2024 Census, the population of the town was recorded as 30,828.

==History==
When Cetshwayo became king of the Zulus on 1 September 1873, he created, as was customary, a new capital for the nation, naming it &quot;Ulundi&quot; (&quot;The high place&quot;). On 4 July 1879, in the Battle of Ulundi (the final battle of the Anglo-Zulu War), the British Army captured the royal kraal and razed it to the ground.

Nearby is Ondini, where King Mpande, Cetshwayo&#x27;s father, had his kraal. A large Zulu hut now is on the site.

==Climate==
Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as humid subtropical (Cfa). It is rainier in the warmer months.

<text>Kim James Newman (born 31 July 1959) is an English journalist, film critic and fiction writer. He is interested in film history and horror fiction—both of which he attributes to seeing Tod Browning&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot; at the age of eleven—and alternative history. He has won the Bram Stoker Award, the International Horror Guild Award and the BSFA award.

==Early life==
Kim Newman was born 31 July 1959 in Brixton, London, the son of Bryan Michael Newman and Julia Christen Newman, both potters. His sister, Sasha, was born in 1961, and their mother died in 2003. Newman attended &quot;a progressive kindergarten and a primary school in Brixton, and then Huish Episcopi County Primary School in Langport, Somerset&quot;. In 1966 the family moved to Aller, Somerset. He was educated at Dr. Morgan&#x27;s Grammar School for Boys in Bridgwater. While he attended, the school merged with two others to become Haygrove Comprehensive. He graduated from the University of Sussex with an English degree in 1980 and set a short story, &quot;Angel Down, Sussex&quot; (1999) in the area. Newman acted in school plays and with the Bridgwater Youth Theatre.

==Non-fiction==
Early in his career, Newman was a journalist for the magazines &quot;City Limits&quot; and &quot;Knave&quot;.

Newman&#x27;s first two books were the non-fiction &quot;Ghastly Beyond Belief: The Science Fiction and Fantasy Book of Quotations&quot; (1985), co-written with his friend Neil Gaiman, a light-hearted tribute to entertainingly bad prose in fantastic fiction and &quot;Nightmare Movies: A Critical History of the Horror Film, 1968–88&quot; (1988) is a serious history of horror films. An expanded edition, an update of his overview of post-1968 genre cinema, was published in 2011. &quot;Nightmare Movies&quot; was followed by &quot;Wild West Movies: Or How the West Was Found, Won, Lost, Lied About, Filmed and Forgotten&quot; (1990) and &quot;Millennium Movies: End of the World Cinema&quot; (1999). Newman&#x27;s non-fiction also includes the &quot;BFI Companion to Horror&quot; (1996).

Newman and Stephen Jones jointly edited &quot;Horror: 100 Best Books&quot;, the 1988 horror volume in Xanadu&#x27;s 100 Best series and &quot;Horror: Another 100 Best Books&quot;, a 2005 sequel from Carroll &amp; Graf, U.S. publisher of the series. The books comprise 100 essays by 100 horror writers about 100 horror books and both won the annual Bram Stoker Award for Best Non-Fiction.

Newman is a contributing editor to the UK film magazine &quot;Empire&quot;, as well as writing the monthly segment, &quot;Kim Newman&#x27;s Video Dungeon&quot;, in which he gives often scathing reviews of recently released straight-to-video horror films. He contributes to Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Venue&quot;, &quot;Video Watchdog&quot; (&#x27;The Perfectionist&#x27;s Guide to Fantastic Video&#x27;) and &quot;Sight and Sound&quot;. Newman is the author of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; entry in the British Film Institute&#x27;s book series on TV Classics. In 2018, Newman became the chief writer on the BBC Four documentary series &quot;Mark Kermode&#x27;s Secrets of Cinema&quot;.

Newman participated in the 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; critics&#x27; poll, where he listed his ten favorite films as follows: &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, &quot;A Canterbury Tale&quot;, &quot;Céline and Julie Go Boating&quot;, &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, &quot;Duck Amuck&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Scare Jessica to Death&quot;, &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;, &quot;Notorious&quot;, and &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot;.

==Fiction==
Newman&#x27;s first published novel was &quot;The Night Mayor&quot; (1989), set in a virtual reality, based on old black-and-white detective movies. In the same year, as &quot;Jack Yeovil&quot;, he began contributing to a series of novels published by Games Workshop, set in the world of their &quot;Warhammer&quot; and &quot;Dark Future&quot; wargaming and role-playing games. Games Workshop&#x27;s fiction imprint Black Flame returned the Dark Future books to print in 2006, publishing &quot;Demon Download&quot;, &quot;Krokodil Tears&quot;, &quot;Comeback Tour&quot; and the expanded, 250-page version of the short story &quot;Route 666&quot;.

&quot;Anno Dracula&quot; was published in 1992. The novel is set in 1888, during Jack the Ripper&#x27;s killing spree—but a different 1888, in which Dracula became the ruler of England. &quot;Anno Dracula&quot; was followed by the Anno Dracula series of novels and shorter works, that followed the same alternative history. The fourth novel in the series was published in 2013 as &quot;Johnny Alucard&quot;.

Other novels include &quot;Life&#x27;s Lottery&quot; (1999), in which the protagonist&#x27;s life story is determined by the reader&#x27;s choices (an adult version of the Choose Your Own Adventure series of children&#x27;s books), &quot;The Quorum&quot; (1994), &quot;Jago&quot; (1991) and &quot;Bad Dreams&quot; (1990).

Newman wrote a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novella, &quot;Time and Relative&quot; in 2001.

<text>The Ghost Dance (, also called the Ghost Dance of 1890) is a ceremony incorporated into numerous Native American belief systems. According to the millenarian teachings of the Northern Paiute spiritual leader Wovoka (renamed Jack Wilson), proper practice of the dance would reunite the living with spirits of the dead, bring the spirits to fight on their behalf, end American Westward expansion, and bring peace, prosperity, and unity to Native American peoples throughout the region.

The basis for the Ghost Dance is the circle dance, a traditional Native American dance which involves moving in a circular formation in large groups. The Ghost Dance was first practiced by the Nevada Northern Paiute in 1889. The practice swept throughout much of the Western United States, quickly reaching areas of California and Oklahoma. As the Ghost Dance spread from its original source, different tribes synthesized selective aspects of the ritual with their own beliefs.

The Ghost Dance has been associated with Wovoka&#x27;s prophecy of an end to colonial expansion while preaching goals of clean living, an honest life, and cross-cultural cooperation by Native Americans. Practice of the Ghost Dance movement was believed to have contributed to Lakota resistance to assimilation under the Dawes Act. The Lakota variation on the Ghost Dance tended towards millenarianism, an innovation that distinguished the Lakota interpretation from Jack Wilson&#x27;s original teachings. The Caddo still practice the Ghost Dance today.

== History ==

=== Paiute influence ===
The Northern Paiutes living in Mason Valley, in what became the U.S. state of Nevada, were known collectively as the Tövusidökadö () at the time of European contact. The Northern Paiute community at this time was thriving upon a subsistence pattern of fishing, hunting wild game, and foraging for pine nuts and roots such as &quot;Cyperus esculentus&quot;.

The Tövusidökadö tended to follow various spiritual leaders and community organizers. Community events centered on the observance of seasonal ceremonies such as harvests or hunting. In 1869, Hawthorne Wodziwob, a Paiute man, organized a series of community dances to announce a vision. He spoke of a journey to the land of the dead and of promises made to him by the souls of the recently deceased. They promised to return to their loved ones within a period of three to four years.

Wodziwob&#x27;s peers accepted this vision, likely due to his reputable status as a healer. He urged the populace to dance the common circle dance as was customary during a time of celebration. He continued preaching this message for three years with the help of a local &quot;weather doctor&quot; named Tavibo, father of Wovoka.

Prior to Wodziwob&#x27;s religious movement, a devastating typhoid fever epidemic struck in 1867. This and other diseases more common among the European population killed approximately one-tenth of the total population, resulting in widespread psychological and emotional trauma. The disruption brought disorder to the economic system and society. Many families were prevented from continuing their nomadic lifestyle.

=== Round Dance influence ===
A round dance is a circular community dance held usually around an individual who leads the ceremony. Round dances may be ceremonial or purely social. Usually, the dancers are accompanied by a group of singers who may also play hand drums in unison. The dancers join hands to form a large circle. The dancers move with a side-shuffle step to reflect the long-short pattern of the drum beat, bending their knees to emphasize the pattern.

During his studies of the Pacific Northwest tribes the anthropologist Leslie Spier used the term &quot;prophet dances&quot; to describe ceremonial round dances where the participants seek trance, exhortations and prophecy. Spier studied peoples of the Columbia plateau (a region including Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and parts of western Montana). By the time of his studies the only dances he was allowed to witness were social dances or ones that had already incorporated Christian elements, making investigation of the round dance&#x27;s origin complicated.

=== Ghost Dance Ceremony ===
Eyewitness accounts of the Ghost Dance prior to the Wounded knee massacre include Ella Cara Deloria and Goodale Sisters. The Ghost Dance included hundreds of participants in its peak, with many visiting from nearby reservations to participate, with those participants fasting for one to two days prior to the ceremony. On the day of the dance, Men and Women enter a separate Sweat lodge. During a period of two to four days dancers hold hands with their heads looking upwards and slowly sideways shuffle their feet in a clockwise formation while singing Ghost Dance songs. Shamans will wave eagle wing fans in the faces of the participants. The combination of days-long dancing caused with exhaustion and ensued with participants falling unconscious into the center, and the gap was closed by other dancers. The goal was to enter a Trance, where the dancer is transported into the afterworld and meets with lost realities, and times before the arrival of Europeans when the Bison was found in abundance. Wailing, cries, and perplexed looks were found from the dancers as they woke from their unconscious state and retold their experiences to the shamans.

The Ghost Dance is danced with Ghost Dance songs. Leonard Crow Dog recalls in his memoir during the Wounded Knee Occupation of 1973 the chants they were singing:

&quot;The whole world is coming, a nation is coming, a nation is coming, the eagle brought the message, says the father, says the father, the whole world is coming, the buffalo are coming, the buffalo are coming, the crow has brought the message, says the father, says the father. The crow nation is coming, says the father, says the father.&quot;

== The Prophet ==
Jack Wilson, the prophet otherwise known as Wovoka, was believed to have had a vision during a solar eclipse on January 1, 1889. It was reportedly not his first time experiencing a vision, but as a young adult, he claimed that he was then better equipped, spiritually, to handle this message. Jack had received training from an experienced holy man under his parents&#x27; guidance after they realized that he was having difficulty interpreting his previous visions. Jack was also training to be a &quot;weather doctor&quot;, following in his father&#x27;s footsteps. He was known throughout Mason Valley as a gifted and blessed young leader. Preaching a message of universal love, he often presided over circle dances, which symbolized the sun&#x27;s heavenly path across the sky.

Anthropologist James Mooney conducted an interview with Wilson prior to 1892. Mooney confirmed that his message matched that given to his fellow Indians. This study compared letters between tribes. According to Mooney, Wilson&#x27;s letter said he stood before God in heaven and had seen many of his ancestors engaged in their favorite pastimes, and that God showed Wilson a beautiful land filled with wild game and instructed him to return home to tell his people that they must love each other and not fight. He also stated that Jesus was being reincarnated on Earth in 1892, that the people must work, not steal or lie, and that they must not engage in the old practices of war or the traditional self-mutilation practices connected with mourning the dead. He said that if his people abided by these rules, they would be united with their friends and family in the other world, and in God&#x27;s presence, there would be no sickness, disease, or old age.

Mooney writes that Wilson was given the Ghost Dance and commanded to take it back to his people. He preached that if the five-day dance was performed in the proper intervals, the performers would secure their happiness and hasten the reunion of the living and deceased. Wilson said that the Creator gave him powers over the weather and that he would be the deputy in charge of affairs in the western United States, leaving current President Harrison as God&#x27;s deputy in the East. Jack claims that he was then told to return home and preach God&#x27;s message.

Jack Wilson claimed to have left the presence of God convinced that if every Indian in the West danced the new dance to &quot;hasten the event&quot;, all evil in the world would be swept away, leaving a renewed Earth filled with food, love, and faith. Quickly accepted by his Paiute brethren, the new religion was termed, &quot;Dance In A Circle&quot;. Because the first European contact with the practice came by way of the Lakota, their expression &quot;Spirit Dance&quot; was adopted as a descriptive title for all such practices. This was subsequently translated as &quot;Ghost Dance&quot;.

== Recordings, Film, Cinema, Theater and Industrialization ==

Shortly after the commercialisation of Emile Berliner&#x27;s Gramophone, a small set of Ghost dances (curated by James Mooney) were recorded and pressed in 1894, the original masters being held at the Library of Congress. It is unclear who the interpreter of the songs is, possibly James Mooney himself, owing to the interpretation of different tribes&#x27; rituals by one same voice.

The invention of the Kinetoscope created and developed by Thomas Edison and William Kennedy Dickson was a part of the beginning of a movement to cast and film Indigenous North Americans performing ceremonies, dances, and hunting. The kinetoscope was largely popular in the 1890s in both the East and West coast of the United States. These motion pictures were produced to contain a level of shock value to satisfy the viewers who would pay fifty cents to watch it. Films of Indigenous North Americans include a twenty-two second video of &quot;Sioux Ghost Dance,&quot; the passing around of the peace pipe, the buffalo dance, and the Omaha war dance. The Sioux Ghost Dance film offers non-natives an inaccurate depiction of the Ghost Dance. In the film there is a drum, but the dance itself does not include instruments. The dancer&#x27;s heads are face downwards, hands are holding pipes and moving their feet in a fast-paced motion, whereas the original dance is slow, hands are held together, and heads are usually looking upwards. Dancers are crammed into the small stage to accommodate the small space for the kinetoscope to view.

The rise in popularity coincided with Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West shows where, &quot;The role of Indian people was both essential and anomalous in the Wild West. At least in the big shows, they generally were treated and paid the same as other performers. They were able to travel with their families, and they earned a living not possible to them on their reservations. They were encouraged by Buffalo Bill and others to retain their language and rituals. They gained access to political and economic leaders, and their causes were sometimes argued in the published show programs. Yet they were stereotyped as mounted, war-bonneted warriors, the last impediment to civilization. Thus they had to re-fight a losing war nightly; and their hollow victory in the Little Big Horn enactments demonstrated over and over to their audiences the justification for American conquest.

== Spread of the prophet&#x27;s message ==
Through Native Americans and some white settlers, Wilson&#x27;s message spread across much of the western portion of the United States. Early in the religious movement, many tribes sent members to investigate the self-proclaimed prophet, while other communities sent delegates only to be cordial. Regardless of their initial motivations, many left as believers and returned to their homeland preaching his message. The Ghost Dance was also investigated by many Mormons from Utah, for whom the concepts of the Indian prophet were familiar and often accepted. While many followers of the Ghost Dance believed Wovoka to be a teacher of pacifism and peace, others did not.
An elaboration of the Ghost Dance concept was the development of ghost shirts, which were special clothing that warriors could wear. They were rumored to repel bullets through spiritual power. It is uncertain where this belief originated. Scholars believe that in 1890 Chief Kicking Bear introduced the concept to his people, the Lakota, while James Mooney argued that the most likely source is the Mormon temple garment (which Mormons believe protect the pious wearer from evil).

The Lakota interpretation drew from their traditional idea of a &quot;renewed Earth&quot; in which &quot;all evil is washed away&quot;. This Lakota interpretation included the removal of all European Americans from their lands:
== Political influence ==

In February 1890, the United States government broke a Lakota treaty by adjusting the Great Sioux Reservation of South Dakota (an area that formerly encompassed the majority of the state) and breaking it up into five smaller reservations. The government was accommodating white homesteaders from the eastern United States; in addition, it intended to &quot;break up tribal relationships&quot; and &quot;conform Indians to the white man&#x27;s ways, peaceably if they will, or forcibly if they must&quot;. On the reduced reservations, the government allocated family units on plots for individual households. The Lakota were expected to farm and raise livestock, and to send their children to boarding schools. With the goal of assimilation, the schools taught English and Christianity, as well as American cultural practices. Generally, they forbade inclusion of Indian traditional cultures and languages.

To help support the Lakota during the period of transition, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) was to supplement the Lakota with food and to hire white farmers as teachers for the people. The farming plan failed to take into account the difficulty that Lakota farmers would have in trying to cultivate crops in the semi-arid region of South Dakota. By the end of the 1890 growing season, a time of intense heat and low rainfall, it was clear that the land was unable to produce substantial agricultural yields. Unfortunately, this was also the time when the government&#x27;s patience with supporting the so-called &quot;lazy Indians&quot; ran out. They cut rations for the Lakota in half. With the bison having been virtually eradicated a few years earlier, the Lakota were at risk of starvation.

The people turned to the Ghost Dance ritual, which frightened the supervising agents of the BIA. Those who had been residing in the area for a long time recognized that the ritual was often held shortly before battle was to occur. Kicking Bear was forced to leave Standing Rock, but when the dances continued unabated, Agent James McLaughlin asked for more troops. He claimed the Hunkpapa spiritual leader Sitting Bull was the real leader of the movement. A former agent, Valentine McGillycuddy, saw nothing extraordinary in the dances and ridiculed the panic that seemed to have overcome the agencies, saying:

Nonetheless, thousands of additional U.S. Army troops were deployed to the reservation. On December 15, 1890, Sitting Bull was arrested for failing to stop his people from practicing the Ghost Dance. During the incident, one of Sitting Bull&#x27;s men, Catch the Bear, fired at Lieutenant &quot;Bull Head&quot;, striking his right side. He instantly wheeled and shot Sitting Bull, hitting him in the left side, between the tenth and eleventh ribs; this exchange resulted in deaths on both sides, including that of Sitting Bull.

== Wounded Knee ==
Spotted Elk (Lakota: &quot;Unpan Glešká&quot; – also known as Big Foot) was a Miniconjou leader on the U.S. Army&#x27;s list of &#x27;trouble-making&#x27; Indians. On December 29, 1890, he was stopped while &quot;en route&quot; to convene with the remaining Lakota chiefs. U.S. Army officers forced him to relocate with his people to a small camp close to the Pine Ridge Agency. Here the soldiers could more closely watch the old chief. That evening, December 28, the small band of Lakota erected their tipis on the banks of Wounded Knee Creek. The following day, during an attempt by the officers to collect weapons from the band, one young, deaf Lakota warrior refused to relinquish his arms. A struggle followed in which somebody&#x27;s weapon discharged into the air. One U.S. officer gave the command to open fire, and the Lakota responded by taking up previously confiscated weapons; the U.S. forces responded with carbine firearms and several rapid-fire light-artillery Hotchkiss guns mounted on the overlooking hill. When the fighting had concluded, 25 U.S. soldiers lay dead, many killed by friendly fire. Among the 153 dead Lakota, most were women and children. Following the massacre, Chief Kicking Bear officially surrendered his weapon to General Nelson A. Miles.

Twenty U.S. soldiers received Medals of Honor for their actions (some sources state the number as 18 or 23). American Indian and human rights activists have referred to these as &quot;Medals of Dis-Honor&quot; and called for the awards to be rescinded, but none have been revoked.

Following the Wounded Knee Massacre, open participation in the Ghost Dance movement declined gradually for fear of continued violence against practitioners. Like most Indian ceremonies, it became clandestine rather than dying out completely.

Congress officially apologized for the Wounded Knee Massacre in 1990 but did not rescind any Medals of Honor.

== Rejection ==
Despite the widespread acceptance of the Ghost Dance movement, Navajo leaders described the Ghost Dance as &quot;worthless words&quot; in 1890. Three years later, James Mooney arrived at the Navajo reservation in northern Arizona during his study of the Ghost Dance movement and found the Navajo never incorporated the ritual into their society.

Kehoe believed the movement did not gain traction with the tribe due to the Navajo&#x27;s higher levels of social and economic satisfaction at the time. Another factor was cultural norms among the Navajo, which inculcated a fear of ghosts and spirits, based on religious beliefs.

== Modern status==
The Wounded Knee massacre was not the end of the Ghost Dance religious movement. Instead, it went underground. Wovoka continued to spread its message, along with Kicking Bear, Short Bull and other spiritual leaders. The Ghost Dance is practiced by most notably the Caddo, but details are confined to the participants not the public.

During the Wounded Knee incident of 1973, Lakota men and women, including Mary Brave Bird, did the ghost dance ceremony on the site where their ancestors had been killed. In her book &quot;Lakota Woman&quot;, Brave Bird wrote that ghost dances continue as private ceremonies.

<text>Huygens ( ) was an atmospheric entry robotic space probe that landed successfully on Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan in 2005. Built and operated by the European Space Agency (ESA), launched by NASA, it was part of the &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; mission and became the first spacecraft to land on Titan and the farthest landing from Earth a spacecraft has ever made. The probe was named after the 17th-century Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, who discovered Titan in 1655.

The combined &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; spacecraft was launched from Earth on 15 October 1997. &quot;Huygens&quot; separated from the &quot;Cassini&quot; orbiter on 25 December 2004, and landed on Titan on 14 January 2005 near the Adiri region. &quot;Huygens&quot;″s landing is so far the only one accomplished in the outer Solar System or on a moon other than Earth&#x27;s.

&quot;Huygens&quot; touched down on land, although the possibility that it would touch down in an ocean was also taken into account in its design. The probe was designed to gather data for a few hours in the atmosphere, and possibly a short time at the surface. It continued to send data for about 90 minutes after touchdown.

== Overview ==
&quot;Huygens&quot; was designed to enter and brake in Titan&#x27;s atmosphere and parachute a fully instrumented robotic laboratory to the surface. When the mission was planned, it was not yet certain whether the landing site would be a mountain range, a flat plain, an ocean, or something else, and it was thought that analysis of data from &quot;Cassini&quot; would help to answer these questions.

Based on pictures taken by &quot;Cassini&quot; above Titan, the landing site appeared to be a shoreline. Assuming the landing site could be non-solid, &quot;Huygens&quot; was designed to survive the impact, splash down on a liquid surface on Titan, and send back data for several minutes under these conditions. If that occurred it was expected to be the first time a human-made probe would land in an extraterrestrial ocean. The spacecraft had no more than three hours of battery life, most of which was planned to be used during the descent. Engineers expected to get at most only 30 minutes of data from the surface.
The &quot;Huygens&quot; probe system consists of the probe itself, which descended to Titan, and the probe support equipment (PSE), which remained attached to the orbiting spacecraft. &quot;Huygens&quot;&#x27; heat shield was in diameter. After ejecting the shield, the probe was in diameter. The PSE included the electronics necessary to track the probe, to recover the data gathered during its descent, and to process and deliver the data to the orbiter, from where it was transmitted or &quot;downlinked&quot; to the Earth.

The probe remained dormant throughout the 6.7-year interplanetary cruise, except for semiannual health checks. These checkouts followed preprogrammed descent scenario sequences as closely as possible, and the results were relayed to Earth for examination by system and payload experts.

Prior to the probe&#x27;s separation from the orbiter on 25 December 2004, a final health check was performed. The &quot;coast&quot; timer was loaded with the precise time necessary to turn on the probe systems (15 minutes before its encounter with Titan&#x27;s atmosphere), then the probe detached from the orbiter and coasted in free space to Titan in 22 days with no systems active except for its wake-up timer.

The main mission phase was a parachute descent through Titan&#x27;s atmosphere. The batteries and all other resources were sized for a &quot;Huygens&quot; mission duration of 153 minutes, corresponding to a maximum descent time of 2.5 hours plus at least 3 additional minutes (and possibly a half-hour or more) on Titan&#x27;s surface. The probe&#x27;s radio link was activated early in the descent phase, and the orbiter &quot;listened&quot; to the probe for the next three hours, including the descent phase, and the first thirty minutes after touchdown. Not long after the end of this three-hour communication window, &quot;Cassini&quot;&#x27;s high-gain antenna (HGA) was turned away from Titan and towards Earth.

Very large radio telescopes on Earth were also listening to &quot;Huygens&quot;&#x27;s 10-watt transmission using the technique of very long baseline interferometry and aperture synthesis mode. At 11:25 CET on 14 January, the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in West Virginia detected the carrier signal from &quot;Huygens&quot;. The GBT continued to detect the carrier signal well after &quot;Cassini&quot; stopped listening to the incoming data stream. In addition to the GBT, eight of the ten telescopes of the continent-wide VLBA in North America, located at Pie Town and Los Alamos, New Mexico; Fort Davis, Texas; North Liberty, Iowa; Kitt Peak, Arizona; Brewster, Washington; Owens Valley, California; and Mauna Kea, Hawaii, also listened for the &quot;Huygens&quot; signal.

The signal strength received on Earth from &quot;Huygens&quot; was comparable to that from the &quot;Galileo&quot; probe (the Jupiter atmospheric descent probe) as received by the VLA, and was therefore too weak to detect in real time because of the signal modulation by the (then) unknown telemetry. Instead, wide-band recordings of the probe signal were made throughout the three-hour descent. After the probe telemetry was finished being relayed from &quot;Cassini&quot; to Earth, the now-known data modulation was stripped off the recorded signal, leaving a pure carrier that could be integrated over several seconds to determine the probe frequency. It was expected that through analysis of the Doppler shifting of &quot;Huygens&quot;&#x27;s signal as it descended through the atmosphere of Titan, wind speed and direction could be determined with some degree of accuracy. A position of Huygens&#x27;s landing site on Titan was found with precision (within one km – one km on Titan measures 1.3 arcminutes of latitude and longitude at the equator) using the Doppler data at a distance from Earth of about 1.2 billion kilometers. The probe landed on the surface of the moon at . A similar technique was used to determine the landing site of the Mars exploration rovers by listening to their telemetry alone.

== Findings ==
&quot;Huygens&quot; landed at around 12:43 UTC on January 14, 2005 with an impact speed similar to dropping a ball on Earth from a height of about . It made a dent deep, before bouncing onto a flat surface, and sliding across the surface. It slowed due to friction with the surface and, upon coming to its final resting place, wobbled back and forth five times. &quot;Huygens&quot;″ sensors continued to detect small vibrations for another two seconds, until motion subsided about ten seconds after touchdown. The probe kicked up a cloud of dust (most likely organic aerosols which drizzle out of the atmosphere) which remained suspended in the atmosphere for about four seconds by the impact.
At the landing site there were indications of pebbles of water ice scattered over an orange surface, the majority of which is covered by a thin haze of methane. Early aerial imaging of Titan from &quot;Huygens&quot; was consistent with the presence of large bodies of liquid on the surface. The initial photos of Titan before landing showed what appeared to be large drainage channels crossing the lighter colored mainland into a dark sea. Some of the photos suggested islands and a mist shrouded coastline. Subsequent analysis of the probe&#x27;s trajectory indicated that, in fact, &quot;Huygens&quot; had landed within the dark &#x27;sea&#x27; region in the photos. The photos from the surface of a dry lakebed like landscape suggest that while there is evidence of liquid acting on the surface recently, hydrocarbon lakes and/or seas might not currently exist at the &quot;Huygens&quot; landing site. Further data from the &quot;Cassini&quot; Mission, however, definitely confirmed the existence of permanent liquid hydrocarbon lakes in the polar regions of Titan (see Lakes of Titan). Long-standing tropical hydrocarbon lakes were also discovered in 2012 (including one not far from the &quot;Huygens&quot; landing site in the Shangri-La region which is about half the size of Utah&#x27;s Great Salt Lake, with a depth of at least ). The likely supplier in dry desert areas is probably underground aquifers; in other words, the arid equatorial regions of Titan contain &quot;oases&quot;.
The surface was initially reported to be a clay-like &quot;material which might have a thin crust followed by a region of relative uniform consistency.&quot; One ESA scientist compared the texture and colour of Titan&#x27;s surface to a crème brûlée (that is, a hard surface covering a sticky mud-like subsurface). Subsequent analysis of the data suggests that surface consistency readings were likely caused by &quot;Huygens&quot; pushing a large pebble into the ground as it landed, and that the surface is better described as a &quot;sand&quot; made of ice grains or snow that has been frozen on top. The images taken after the probe&#x27;s landing show a flat plain covered in pebbles. The pebbles, which may be made of hydrocarbon-coated water ice, are somewhat rounded, which may indicate the action of fluids on them. The rocks appear to be rounded, size-selected and size-layered as though located in the bed of a stream within a dark lakebed, which consists of finer-grained material. No pebbles larger than across were spotted, while rocks smaller than are rare on the &quot;Huygens&quot; landing site. This implies large pebbles cannot be transported to the lakebed, while small rocks are quickly removed from the surface.

The temperature at the landing site was and pressure of , implying a methane abundance of 5 ± 1% and methane relative humidity of 50% near the surface. Therefore, ground fogs caused by methane in the neighborhood of the landing site are unlikely. Thermometers indicated that heat left &quot;Huygens&quot; so quickly that the ground must have been damp, and one image shows light reflected by a dewdrop as it falls across the camera&#x27;s field of view. On Titan, the feeble sunlight allows only about one centimeter of evaporation per year (versus one metre of water on Earth), but the atmosphere can hold the equivalent of about of liquid before rain forms vs. only a few centimeters on Earth. So Titan&#x27;s weather is expected to feature torrential downpours causing flash floods, interspersed by decades or centuries of drought.

&quot;Huygens&quot; found the brightness of the surface of Titan (at time of landing) to be about one thousand times dimmer than full solar illumination on Earth (or 500 times brighter than illumination by full moonlight)—that is, the illumination level experienced about ten minutes after sunset on Earth, approximately late civil twilight. The color of the sky and the scene on Titan is mainly orange due to the much greater attenuation of blue light by Titan&#x27;s haze relative to red light. The Sun (which was comparatively high in the sky when &quot;Huygens&quot; landed) would be visible as a small, bright spot, one tenth the size of the solar disk seen from Earth, and comparable in size and brightness to a car headlight seen from about . It casts sharp shadows, but of low contrast as 90% of the illumination comes from the sky.
==Detailed &quot;Huygens&quot; activity timeline==
* &quot;Huygens&quot; separated from &quot;Cassini&quot; orbiter at 02:00 UTC on 25 December 2004 in Spacecraft Event Time.
* &quot;Huygens&quot; entered Titan&#x27;s atmosphere at 10:13 UTC on 14 January 2005 in SCET, according to ESA.
* The probe landed on the surface of Titan at about 10.6°S, 192.3°W around 12:43 UTC in SCET (2 hours 30 minutes after atmospheric entry).(1.)

There was a transit of the Earth and Moon across the Sun as seen from Saturn/Titan just hours before the landing. &quot;Huygens&quot; entered the upper layer of Titan&#x27;s atmosphere 2.7 hours after the end of the transit of the Earth, or only one or two minutes after the end of the transit of the Moon. However, the transit did not interfere with the &quot;Cassini&quot; orbiter or &quot;Huygens&quot; probe, for two reasons. First, although they could not receive any signal from Earth because it was in front of the Sun, Earth could still listen to them. Second, &quot;Huygens&quot; did not send any readable data directly to Earth. Rather, it transmitted data to the &quot;Cassini&quot; orbiter, which later relayed to Earth the data received.

==Instrumentation==
&quot;Huygens&quot; had six instruments aboard that took in a wide range of scientific data as the probe descended through Titan&#x27;s atmosphere. The six instruments are:

===&quot;Huygens&quot; Atmospheric Structure Instrument (HASI)===
This instrument contains a suite of sensors that measured the physical and electrical properties of Titan&#x27;s atmosphere. Accelerometers measured forces in all three axes as the probe descended through the atmosphere. With the aerodynamic properties of the probe already known, it was possible to determine the density of Titan&#x27;s atmosphere and to detect wind gusts. The probe was designed so that in the event of a landing on a liquid surface, its motion due to waves would also have been measurable. Temperature and pressure sensors measured the thermal properties of the atmosphere. The Permittivity and Electromagnetic Wave Analyzer component measured the electron and ion (i.e., positively charged particle) conductivities of the atmosphere and searched for electromagnetic wave activity. On the surface of Titan, the electrical conductivity and permittivity (i.e., the ratio of electric displacement field to its electric field) of the surface material was measured. The HASI subsystem also contains a microphone, which was used to record any acoustic events during probe&#x27;s descent and landing;

===Doppler Wind Experiment (DWE)===
This experiment used an ultra-stable oscillator which provided a precise S-band carrier frequency that allowed the Cassini orbiter to accurately determine Huygens&#x27;s radial velocity with respect to Cassini via the Doppler Effect. The wind-induced horizontal motion from Huygens would have been derived from the measured Doppler shift measurements, corrected for all known orbit and propagation effects. The swinging motion of the probe beneath its parachute due to atmospheric properties may also have been detected. Failure of ground controllers to turn on the receiver in the &quot;Cassini&quot; orbiter caused the loss of this data. Earth-based radio telescopes were able to reconstruct some of it. Measurements started above Titan&#x27;s surface, where &quot;Huygens&quot; was blown eastwards at more than , agreeing with earlier measurements of the winds at altitude, made over the past few years using telescopes. Between , &quot;Huygens&quot; was buffeted by rapidly fluctuating winds, which are thought to be vertical wind shear. At ground level, the Earth-based doppler shift and VLBI measurements show gentle winds of a few metres per second, roughly in line with expectations.

===Descent Imager/Spectral Radiometer (DISR)===

As &quot;Huygens&quot; was primarily an atmospheric mission, the DISR instrument was optimized to study the radiation balance inside Titan&#x27;s atmosphere. Its visible and infrared spectrometers and violet photometers measured the up- and downward radiant flux from an altitude of down to the surface. Solar aureole cameras measured how scattering by aerosols varies the intensity directly around the Sun. Three imagers, sharing the same CCD, periodically imaged a swath of around 30 degrees wide, ranging from almost nadir to just above the horizon. Aided by the slowly spinning probe they would build up a full mosaic of the landing site, which, surprisingly, became clearly visible only below altitude. All measurements were timed by aid of a shadow bar, which would tell DISR when the Sun had passed through the field of view. Unfortunately, this scheme was upset by the fact that &quot;Huygens&quot; rotated in a direction opposite to that expected. Just before landing a lamp was switched on to illuminate the surface, which enabled measurements of the surface reflectance at wavelengths which are completely blocked out by atmospheric methane absorption.

DISR was developed at the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at the University of Arizona under the direction of Martin Tomasko, with several European institutes contributing to the hardware. &quot;The scientific objectives of the experiment fall into four areas including (1) measurement of the solar heating profile for studies of the thermal balance of Titan; (2) imaging and spectral reflection measurements of the surface for studies of the composition, topography, and physical processes which form the surface as well as for direct measurements of the wind profile during the descent; (3) measurements of the brightness and degree of linear polarization of scattered sunlight including the solar aureole together with measurements of the extinction optical depth of the aerosols as a function of wavelength and altitude to study the size, shape, vertical distribution, optical properties, sources and sinks of aerosols in Titan’s atmosphere; and (4) measurements of the spectrum of downward solar flux to study the composition of the atmosphere, especially the mixing ratio profile of methane throughout the descent.&quot;

===Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS)===

This instrument is a gas chemical analyzer that was designed to identify and measure chemicals in Titan&#x27;s atmosphere. It was equipped with samplers that were filled at high altitude for analysis. The mass spectrometer, a high-voltage quadrupole, collected data to build a model of the molecular masses of each gas, and a more powerful separation of molecular and isotopic species was accomplished by the gas chromatograph. During descent, the GC/MS also analyzed pyrolysis products (i.e., samples altered by heating) passed to it from the Aerosol Collector Pyrolyser. Finally, the GC/MS measured the composition of Titan&#x27;s surface. This investigation was made possible by heating the GC/MS instrument just prior to impact in order to vaporize the surface material upon contact. The GC/MS was developed by Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Michigan&#x27;s Space Physics Research Lab.

===Aerosol Collector and Pyrolyser (ACP)===
The ACP experiment drew in aerosol particles from the atmosphere through filters, then heated the trapped samples in ovens (using the process of pyrolysis) to vaporize volatiles and decompose the complex organic materials. The products were flushed along a pipe to the GC/MS instrument for analysis. Two filters were provided to collect samples at different altitudes. The ACP was developed by a (French) ESA team at the Laboratoire Inter-Universitaire des Systèmes Atmosphériques (LISA).

===Surface Science Package (SSP)===
The SSP contained a number of sensors designed to determine the physical properties of Titan&#x27;s surface at the point of impact, whether the surface was solid or liquid. An acoustic sounder, activated during the last of the descent, continuously determined the distance to the surface, measuring the rate of descent and the surface roughness (e.g., due to waves). The instrument was designed so that if the surface were liquid, the sounder would measure the speed of sound in the &quot;ocean&quot; and possibly also the subsurface structure (depth). During descent, measurements of the speed of sound gave information on atmospheric composition and temperature, and an accelerometer recorded the deceleration profile at impact, indicating the hardness and structure of the surface. A tilt sensor measured pendulum motion during the descent and was also designed to indicate the probe&#x27;s attitude after landing and show any motion due to waves. If the surface had been liquid, other sensors would also have measured its density, temperature, thermal conductivity, heat capacity, electrical properties (permittivity and conductivity) and refractive index (using a critical angle refractometer). A penetrometer instrument, that protruded past the bottom of the &quot;Huygens&quot; descent module, was used to create a penetrometer trace as &quot;Huygens&quot; landed on the surface. This was done by measuring the force exerted on the instrument by the body&#x27;s surface as it broke through and was pushed down into the body by the landing. The trace shows this force as a function of time over a period of about 400 ms. The trace has an initial spike which suggests that the instrument hit one of the icy pebbles on the surface photographed by the DISR camera.

The &quot;Huygens&quot; SSP was developed by the Space Sciences Department of the University of Kent and the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory Space Science Department (now RAL Space) under the direction of Professor John Zarnecki. The SSP research and responsibility transferred to the Open University when John Zarnecki transferred in 2000.

==Spacecraft design==
&quot;Huygens&quot; was built under the Prime Contractorship of Aérospatiale in its Cannes Mandelieu Space Center, France, now part of Thales Alenia Space. The heat shield system was built under the responsibility of Aérospatiale near Bordeaux, now part of Airbus Defence and Space.

===Parachute===
Martin-Baker Space Systems was responsible for &quot;Huygens&quot;&#x27; parachute systems and the structural components, mechanisms and pyrotechnics that control the probe&#x27;s descent onto Titan. IRVIN-GQ was responsible for the definition of the structure of each of &quot;Huygens&quot;&#x27; parachutes. Irvin worked on the probe&#x27;s descent control sub-system under contract to Martin-Baker Space Systems.

==Critical design flaw partially resolved==
Long after launch, a few persistent engineers discovered that the communication equipment on &quot;Cassini&quot; had a potentially fatal design flaw, which would have caused the loss of all data transmitted by &quot;Huygens&quot;.

Since &quot;Huygens&quot; was too small to transmit directly to Earth, it was designed to transmit the telemetry data obtained while descending through Titan&#x27;s atmosphere by radio to &quot;Cassini&quot;, which would in turn relay it to Earth using its large diameter main antenna. Some engineers, most notably ESA ESOC employees Claudio Sollazzo and Boris Smeds, felt uneasy about the fact that, in their opinion, this feature had not been tested before launch under sufficiently realistic conditions. Smeds managed, with some difficulty, to persuade superiors to perform additional tests while &quot;Cassini&quot; was in flight. In early 2000, he sent simulated telemetry data at varying power and Doppler shift levels from Earth to &quot;Cassini&quot;. It turned out that &quot;Cassini&quot; was unable to relay the data correctly.

This was because under the original flight plan, when &quot;Huygens&quot; was to descend to Titan, it would have accelerated relative to &quot;Cassini&quot;, causing the Doppler shift of its signal to vary. Consequently, the hardware of &quot;Cassini&quot;&#x27;s receiver was designed to be able to receive over a range of shifted frequencies. However, the firmware failed to take into account that the Doppler shift would have changed not only the carrier frequency, but also the timing of the payload bits, coded by phase-shift keying at 8192 bits per second.

Reprogramming the firmware was impossible, and as a solution the trajectory had to be changed. &quot;Huygens&quot; detached a month later than originally planned (December 2004 instead of November) and approached Titan in such a way that its transmissions travelled perpendicular to its direction of motion relative to &quot;Cassini&quot;, greatly reducing the Doppler shift.

The trajectory change overcame the design flaw for the most part, and data transmission succeeded, although the information from one of the two radio channels was lost due to an unrelated error.

== Channel A data loss ==
&quot;Huygens&quot; was programmed to transmit telemetry and scientific data to the &quot;Cassini&quot; orbiter for relay to Earth using two redundant S-band radio systems, referred to as Channel A and B, or Chain A and B. Channel A was the sole path for an experiment to measure wind speeds by studying tiny frequency changes caused by &quot;Huygens&quot;&#x27;s motion. In one other deliberate departure from full redundancy, pictures from the descent imager were split, with each channel carrying 350 pictures.

&quot;Cassini&quot; never listened to channel A because of an error in the sequence of commands sent to the spacecraft. The receiver on the orbiter was never commanded to turn on, according to officials with the European Space Agency. ESA announced that the error was a mistake on their part, the missing command was part of a command sequence developed by ESA for the &quot;Huygens&quot; mission, and that it was executed by &quot;Cassini&quot; as delivered.

Because Channel A was not used, only 350 pictures were received instead of the 700 planned. All Doppler radio measurements between &quot;Cassini&quot; and &quot;Huygens&quot; were lost as well. Doppler radio measurements of &quot;Huygens&quot; from Earth were made, although they were not as accurate as the lost measurements that &quot;Cassini&quot; made. The use of accelerometer sensors on &quot;Huygens&quot; and VLBI tracking of the position of the &quot;Huygens&quot; probe from Earth allowed reasonably accurate wind speed and direction calculations to be made.

== Contributions from citizen science projects ==
The fact that &quot;Huygens&quot; rotated in the opposite direction than planned delayed the creation of surface mosaics from the raw data by the project team for many months. On the other hand, this provided an opportunity for some citizen science projects to attempt the task of assembling the surface mosaics. This was possible, because the European Space Agency approved the publication of the DISR raw images and gave the permission for citizen scientists to present their results on the internet.
Some of these citizen science projects have received a lot of attention in the scientific community, in popular scientific journals
and in the public media.
While the media liked to present the story of amateurs outperforming the professionals, most of the participants understood themselves as citizen scientists, and the driving force behind their work was a desire to find out and show as much as possible of the hitherto unknown surface of Titan. Some enthusiasts&#x27; projects were the first to publish surface mosaics and panoramas of Titan on the day after &quot;Huygens&quot; landed.
Another project worked with the &quot;Huygens&quot; DISR data for several months until virtually all images with recognizable structures were able to be assigned to their correct position, resulting in comprehensive mosaics and panoramas.
A surface panorama from this citizen science project was finally published in the context of a Nature review by Joseph Burns.

<text>Stonewall Jackson (November 6, 1932 – December 4, 2021) was an American country music singer and musician who achieved his greatest fame during country&#x27;s &quot;golden&quot; honky tonk era in the 1950s and early 1960s.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Born in Tabor City, North Carolina on November 6, 1932, Jackson was the youngest of three children. Stonewall is not a nickname; he was named after Confederate General Thomas &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson. (Some publicity claimed he was a descendant of the general, but that is unlikely.)

When Stonewall was two, his father died after which his mother moved the family to Worth County in South Georgia, where he grew up working on his uncle&#x27;s farm. Jackson enlisted in the Navy in 1950 and was discharged in 1954. He moved to Nashville, Tennessee in 1956.

===Recording career===
After hearing Jackson&#x27;s demo tape, Wesley Rose, president of Acuff-Rose Music, arranged for Jackson to audition for the Grand Ole Opry. Jackson became the first artist to join the Grand Ole Opry before obtaining a recording contract. He toured with Ernest Tubb, who became his mentor. Jackson signed with Columbia Records in 1958.

His breakthrough came in the country Top 40 in late 1958, with a song written by a young George Jones, &quot;Life to Go&quot;. It peaked at No.2 in early 1959 and his follow-up record, &quot;Waterloo&quot;, was No.1 for five weeks, and crossed over into the Top 40 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, where it reached No. 4. The track also reached No. 24 in the UK Singles Chart in July 1959. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. The song was a haunting and catchy tune that states &quot;Everybody has to meet his Waterloo&quot;, meaning their fate. The song cites Adam, Napoleon and Tom Dooley as examples.

His next No. 1 hits came in 1964 with &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Angry&quot; and &quot;B.J. the D.J.&quot; (Jackson&#x27;s foray into the teenage tragedy song trope, about an over-worked country music radio station disc jockey, who crashes his car in a rainstorm). In 1971, Jackson was the first artist to record a live album from the Grand Ole Opry with &quot;Recorded Live At The Grand Ole Opry&quot;. His other hit songs include &quot;The Carpet on the Floor&quot;, &quot;Why I&#x27;m Walkin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;A Wound Time Can&#x27;t Erase&quot;, and &quot;I Washed My Hands In Muddy Water&quot;. Jackson also recorded a cover version of Lobo&#x27;s 1971 hit, &quot;Me and You and a Dog Named Boo&quot;, which became Jackson&#x27;s final top 10 hit.

From 1958 to 1971, Jackson had 35 Top 40 country hits.

===Later years===
In 2006, Jackson sued the Grand Ole Opry for $10 million in compensatory damages and $10 million in punitive damages, claiming age discrimination. As a member of the Opry for over fifty years, Jackson believed management was sidelining him in favor of younger artists. In his court filing, Jackson claimed that Opry general manager Pete Fisher stated that he did not &quot;want any gray hairs on that stage or in the audience, and before I&#x27;m done there won&#x27;t be any.&quot; Fisher is also alleged to have told Jackson that he was &quot;too old and too country&quot;. The lawsuit was settled on October 3, 2008 for an undisclosed amount and Jackson returned to performing on the show. He was a member of the Opry from 1956 until his death. He largely retired from performing by 2012, with his last public performance being at the funeral of his longtime friend George Jones.

Jackson lived on a farm in Brentwood, Tennessee where his wife Juanita died on January 11, 2019. She was also his personal manager and operated his song publishing company, Turp Tunes. He has a son, Stonewall Jackson Jr.

He was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame on October 11, 2012.

Jackson died in Nashville, Tennessee, on December 4, 2021, at the age of 89, from complications of vascular dementia.

<doc id="185088" wikidata="Q763141" url="?curid=185088" title="Ifni">
<text>Ifni was a Spanish province on the Atlantic coast of Morocco, south of Agadir and across from the Canary Islands. It had a total area of , and a population of 51,517 in 1964. The main industry was fishing. The present-day Moroccan province in the same area is called Sidi Ifni, with its capital in the city of the same name, but encompassing a much larger territory.

==History==
Spain&#x27;s presence in the area can be traced to a settlement called Santa Cruz de la Mar Pequeña, founded in 1476. After attacks by the Berbers, the Spanish decided to focus on colonising other areas of North Africa and abandoned the region.

In the mid-19th century, when the European powers looked again to Africa for resources, Spain suddenly mooted an interest in its lost late medieval fortress in order to stake a claim to the southern part of Morocco. This served as a pretext for a short war with Morocco in 1859.

The territory and its main town of Sidi Ifni were ceded to Spain by the Sultanate of Morocco on 26 April 1860, but there was little interest in this colonial acquisition until 1934, when the Governor-General of Spanish Sahara took up residence. The airport had become a crucial stopover for flights between the mainland and the Canary Islands, and in 1938 a commercial route was established by airline Iberia linking Seville, Larache, Sidi Ifni, Cape Juby and Gando in the Canaries.

The origin of Ifni must be dated to 1934, after Colonel Osvaldo Capaz took possession of the area, on behalf of the Government of the Second Spanish Republic. At that time, there was only a small construction, an aduar called &quot;Amezdog&quot;, belonging to the El Mesti Kabyle of the Ait-Baamarani Berber tribe, and of which there are currently no remnants.

Ifni&#x27;s occupation took place after satisfactory contacts between Colonel Capaz and representatives of the population of the territory, with conversations carried out in Cape Juby on March the 27th of 1934. Then, on 4 April, after receiving authorization from the Spanish Government, said colonel embarked on the &quot;Canalejas&quot; gunboat towards Ifni. On that date, a three-engine unit dropped a letter from Capaz in the Arbaa de Mesti souk, announcing the agreements adopted and the next Spanish landing. The event was related thus by Francisco Hernández-Pacheco, who was part of the scientific expedition that traveled over the territory of Ifni shortly after:Capaz landed on the beach of Sidi Ifni on April 6, accompanied only by Lieutenant Lorenzi and the signalman from Canalejas, Fernando Gómez Flórez. To meet the Spanish boat, a row-boat with local people left the beach, to which Capaz and his crew transferred, all of them landing safely on the beach. Capaz addressed a group of indigenous people who were waiting for him, from which some notable stood out, and who offered the Colonel a bowl of sour milk as a welcome sign. Later, on horseback, he ascended to the top of the coastal area and in the immediate hamlet of Amedog (sic) he ate. During the meal some groups of indigenous and notable people arrived, to whom Capaz explained simply and clearly the purposes and intentions of Spain. The locals left after the meal, convening to hold meetings to discuss the matter. The following morning they informed Colonel Capaz of Ifni&#x27;s agreement to join Spain. Francisco Hernández-Pacheco, &quot;Physiographic and geological features of the Ifni territory&quot;. Together with Amezdog, the Spanish presence was formalized in a ceremony attended by notable Baamaranis and Colonel Osvaldo Capaz.

In just three years it went from an occasional tent camp, and some barracks, to the construction of six hundred houses or buildings. Indeed, the population experienced spectacular growth in just a few years. By 1940 the urban structure was already well advanced in its streets, squares and main buildings. However, for some years communication with the metropolis was difficult. The city did not stop growing in all subsequent years. Even just three short years before the 1969 retrocession to Morocco, the most considerable urban expansion was concluded, on the other side of the Ifni river, in the neighborhood popularly known as &quot;Barrio Agulla&quot; or, more commonly, &quot;Colominas&quot; (name of the Spanish construction company of the neighborhood).

After Moroccan independence, the Moroccan Army of Liberation attacked the territory between November 1957 and July 1958. The attacks began on 23 November 1957, beginning the War of Ifni. However, the city was supplied by sea and air and protected by outposts. Initially, a good part of the military personnel were indigenous, especially those included in the Ifni Group of Shooters and in the Territorial Police. They were disarmed, demobilized, and promptly replaced. Except for a frustrated plan by the Moroccan irregular forces to eliminate the Spanish officers, the initial minor incidents and an attack, Sidi Ifni was not directly affected by the military events. These were developed in the interior of the territory. On the Spanish side, it was finally decided to establish a defensive perimeter that is denser and more difficult to infiltrate and, furthermore, easier to sustain and supply, near the city of Sidi Ifni (between 8 and 10 km from the city center, according to the zone) leaving most of arid territory that would have been much more costly to defend without appreciable advantage. Those defensive positions, quite numerous, and the dirt tracks that connect them, are still perfectly visible.

After the Ifni War, most of the territory became part of Morocco by the Treaty of Angra de Cintra. In 1958, the colony was declared a Spanish overseas province in order to forestall United Nations criticism of continued colonisation.

A fundamental aspect of Spanish political management in the area was the recognition and respect for the customs and traditions of the Baamarani population, as well as their religious beliefs. For example, Spain provided the means for the construction of mosques and for the Koranic education of Muslim schoolchildren. The prohibition of any kind of Christian religious proselytism was a perfectly known and respected principle.

On 30 June 1969, the Spanish government formally ceded what it kept from Ifni to Morocco, by virtue of the Retrocession Treaty signed in Fez on 4 January and ratified 22 April 1969, thus making the retrocession effective. After that, a difficult process of adaptation began, aggravated by an acute economic crisis and the imposition of the French-speaking administration.

==Postage stamps==
Spain started issuing postage stamps to be used in Ifni in 1941, initially overprinting Spanish stamps with &quot;TERRITORIO DE IFNI&quot;, then issuing new designs in 1943. Issues followed at the rate of about ten per year with the last on 23 November 1968. Ifni stamps are of particular interest for collectors, as there cannot be any new issues, and it is therefore possible to collect the complete series.

<doc id="185089" wikidata="Q2714206" url="?curid=185089" title="Andrew Wells">
<text>Andrew Wells is a fictional character in the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot;, played by Tom Lenk. The character also appears in &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight&quot;, the canonical continuation of the series.

==Character history==
Andrew Wells is the younger brother of Tucker Wells, who summoned hellhounds to attack the Prom in the season 3 episode &quot;The Prom&quot;. Andrew himself has skills in demon-summoning and animal control, although these were never used after season 6; in the Buffy finale &quot;Chosen&quot; he credits his brother with having given him the courage to develop this talent.

At some point during Buffy&#x27;s senior year in high school, he summoned &quot;flying demon monkeys&quot; to attack Sunnydale High&#x27;s production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, apparently for no other reason than to amuse himself. Years after the fact, both Jonathan (Danny Strong) and Warren (Adam Busch) recall the incident with amusement. The Scooby Gang have no memory of this whatsoever; viewers are left with the impression that the attack ranks among any number of less-memorable supernatural incidents which plagued Sunnydale. They also have no recollection of who Andrew is, until he informs them of his relation to Tucker. This becomes a running joke, as from then on, he is often referred to as &quot;the other guy,&quot; &quot;Tucker&#x27;s brother,&quot; and so on.

===The Trio===
Andrew is introduced in season 6 as part of The Trio, a group of nerds who thought of themselves as supervillains. This group includes Jonathan, an acquaintance of Buffy and her friends, and Warren, a misogynist with delusions of grandeur. The Trio attempts a number of crimes that are usually thwarted by Buffy. These crimes are mostly harmless until Warren kills his ex-girlfriend Katrina. Buffy defeats them one more time during a robbery attempt; Warren escapes but Andrew and Jonathan get caught. Warren takes his revenge on Buffy by shooting her, accidentally killing Willow&#x27;s girlfriend, Tara, in the process. In her grief, Willow kills Warren and attempts kill Andrew and Jonathan. Buffy breaks Andrew and Jonathan out of jail to keep them out of Willow&#x27;s grasp. The duo escapes to Mexico before they can be brought back to jail.

===Andrew&#x27;s Return===
While in Mexico, Andrew is visited by what he believes to be Warren&#x27;s ghost but is actually an ancient entity called the First Evil. Andrew kills Jonathan under the influence of the First Evil and is eventually captured by Buffy and her friends. He is initially resentful of them but eventually shows remorse for his actions, especially for killing Jonathan, and joins them in their fight against the First Evil. He survives the final battle.

==Sexuality==
Andrew is occasionally hinted to be gay in the series. However, in the &quot;Angel&quot; episode &quot;The Girl in Question&quot;, Andrew is shown leaving for the opera with two attractive women, commenting that &quot;people change&quot;. In January 2008, gay men&#x27;s website AfterElton.com awarded Andrew the status as the tenth best gay or bisexual character in modern science fiction, despite commenting upon the textual ambiguity of Andrew&#x27;s sexual orientation. This prompted creator Joss Whedon to more formally comment on Andrew&#x27;s sexuality, on Whedonesque.com.

&quot;It has to be said: the Andrew scene in &#x27;The Girl in Question&#x27; was a victim of me dropping the ball. I specifically said there should be a party of men AND women, all glamorous and Italian, waiting for Andrew. I wasn&#x27;t there when it was shot, and didn&#x27;t have the time/money/energy to change it after the fact, though it made me crazy. Andrew&#x27;s sexuality is always on the cusp of self-awareness because Andrew is stunted emotionally and because it&#x27;s hilarious.&quot; [...] &quot;The &#x27;people change&#x27; thing is a hold-over from the fact that the scene was originally written for Dawn (but Michelle turned us down). The idea was, there&#x27;s little Dawn, then in the last scene there&#x27;s hot grown-up Dawn going out on the town, a heavy visual support of people changing (since Spike and Angel always see her as older brothers do).&quot;

In November 2008, Tom Lenk came out as gay in &quot;The Advocate&quot; magazine. Joss Whedon was interviewed for the article, and revealed that it was decided that the character of Andrew was to be gay when they decided to cast Lenk in the role.

&quot;Tom has a bit of a fey thing going on in his persona that, you know, you can&#x27;t really deny. When I first looked at his audition tape, I said &#x27;OK, he, uh, he seems kinda gay. Do we want to make that decision [about the character]? There&#x27;s no reason why he couldn&#x27;t be, so, great, let&#x27;s pick the funniest actor.&#x27; [...] The character became very charming in his complete lack of awareness about, among other things, his own sexuality.&quot;

<doc id="185092" wikidata="Q1518244" url="?curid=185092" title="Business rule">
<text>A business rule defines or constrains some aspect of a business. It may be expressed to specify an action to be taken when certain conditions are true or may be phrased so it can only resolve to either true or false. Business rules are intended to assert business structure or to control or influence the behavior of the business. Business rules describe the operations, definitions and constraints that apply to an organization. Business rules can apply to people, processes, corporate behavior and computing systems in an organization, and are put in place to help the organization achieve its goals. For example, a business rule might state that &quot;no credit check is to be performed on return customers&quot;. Other examples of business rules include requiring a rental agent to disallow a rental tenant if their credit rating is too low, or requiring company agents to use a list of preferred suppliers and supply schedules. While a business rule may be informal or even unwritten, documenting the rules clearly and making sure that they don&#x27;t conflict is a valuable activity. When carefully managed, rules can be used to help the organization to better achieve goals, remove obstacles to market growth, reduce costly mistakes, improve communication, comply with legal requirements, and increase customer loyalty.

==Introduction==
Business rules tell an organization what it can do in detail, while strategy tells it how to focus the business at a macro level to optimize results. A strategy provides high-level direction about what an organization should do. Business rules provide detailed guidance about how a strategy can be translated to action.

Business rules exist for an organization whether or not they are ever written down, talked about or even part of the organization&#x27;s consciousness. However it is a fairly common practice for organizations to gather business rules. This may happen in one of two ways.

Organizations may choose to proactively describe their business practices, producing a database of rules. While this activity may be beneficial, it may be expensive and time-consuming. For example, they might hire a consultant to comb through the organization to document and consolidate the various standards and methods currently in practice.

Gathering business rules is also called rules harvesting or business rule mining. The business analyst or consultant can extract the rules from IT documentation (like use cases, specifications or system code). They may also organize workshops and interviews with subject matter experts (commonly abbreviated as SMEs). Software technologies designed to capture business rules through analysis of legacy source code or of actual user behavior can accelerate the rule gathering processing.

More commonly, business rules are discovered and documented informally during the initial stages of a project. In this case, the collecting of the business rules is incidental. In addition, business projects, such as the launching of a new product or the re-engineering of a complex process, might lead to the definition of new business rules. This practice of incidental, or emergent, business rule gathering is vulnerable to the creation of inconsistent or even conflicting business rules within different organizational units, or within the same organizational unit over time. This inconsistency creates problems that can be difficult to find and fix.

===Business rules approach===
Allowing business rules to be documented during the course of business projects is less expensive and easier to accomplish than the first approach, but if the rules are not collected in a consistent manner, they are not valuable. In order to teach business people about the best ways to gather and document business rules, experts in business analysis have created the Business Rules Methodology. This methodology defines a process of capturing business rules in natural language, in a verifiable and understandable way. This process is not difficult to learn, can be performed in real-time, and empowers business stakeholders to manage their own business rules in a consistent manner.

== Categories ==

According to the white paper by the Business Rules Group, a statement of a business rule falls into one of four categories:
*Definitions of business terms
The most basic element of a business rule is the language used to express it. The very definition of a term is itself a business rule that describes how people think and talk about things. Thus, defining a term is establishing a category of business rule. Terms have traditionally been documented in a Glossary or as entities in a conceptual model.

*Facts relating terms to each other
The nature or operating structure of an organization can be described in terms of the facts that relate terms to each other. To say that a customer can place an order is NOT a business rule, but a &quot;fact&quot;. Facts can be documented as natural language sentences or as relationships, attributes, and generalization structures in a graphical model.

*Constraints (also called &quot;action assertions&quot;)
Every enterprise constrains behavior in some way, and this is closely related to constraints on what data may or may not be updated. To prevent a record from being made is, in many cases, to prevent an action from taking place.

*Derivations
Business rules (including laws of nature) define how knowledge in one form may be transformed into other knowledge, possibly in a different form.

== Real world applications and obstacles ==
Business rules are gathered in these situations: 
# When dictated by law
# During the business analysis
# As an ephemeral aid to engineers.
This lack of consistent approach is mostly due to the cost and effort required to maintain the list of rules.

While newer software tools are able to combine business rule management and execution, it is important to realize that these two ideas are distinct, and each provides value that is different from the other. Software packages automate business rules using business logic. The term &quot;business rule&quot; is sometimes used interchangeably with &quot;business logic&quot;; however the latter connotes an engineering practice and the former an intrinsic business practice. There is value in outlining an organization&#x27;s business rules regardless of whether this information is used to automate its operations.

One of the pitfalls in trying to fill the gap between rules management and execution is trying to give business rules the syntax of logic, and merely describing logical constructs in a natural language. Translation for engines is easier, but business users will no longer be able to write down the rules.

==Formal specification==

Business rules can be expressed using modeling approaches such as Unified Modeling Language (UML), Z notation, Business Process Execution Language (BPEL), Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN), Decision Model and Notation (DMN) or the Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules (SBVR).

===Business rules===
Business rules encoded in computer code in an operational program are known as business logic.

Similar to how business risks can be structured as:

 If &lt;condition(s)&gt; Then &lt;consequence(s)&gt;

a business rule can be structured as:

 When &lt;condition(s)&gt; Then &lt;imposition(s)&gt; Otherwise &lt;consequence(s)&gt;

<doc id="185093" wikidata="Q604642" url="?curid=185093" title="Josiah Harmar">
<text>Josiah Harmar (November 10, 1753August 20, 1813) was an officer in the United States Army during the American Revolutionary War and the Northwest Indian War. He was the senior officer in the Army for six years and seven months (August 1784 to March 1791).

==Early life==
Josiah Harmar was born in Philadelphia, Province of Pennsylvania, and educated at a Quaker school.

==American Revolution==
He started his military career during the Revolutionary War, receiving a commission as a captain in 1775. In 1775, Harmar first saw action during the American invasion of Canada, fighting in the Battle of Quebec. He served primarily under George Washington and &quot;Light-Horse&quot; Henry Lee. Harmar also served as a staff officer of Washington&#x27;s during the 1777-1778 winter at Valley Forge. Washington had a high opinion of Harmar during the Revolutionary War, writing that Harmar was one of the &quot;gentlemen...personally known to me as one of the best officers in the Army&quot;. By the end of the war, Harmar was serving as adjutant to General Nathanael Greene, who commanded the Continental Army in the South. A lieutenant colonel at its conclusion, he was chosen by Congress in 1784 to relay the ratified Treaty of Paris to commissioner Benjamin Franklin in Paris. During his time in France, Harmar was received at the Palace of Versailles by King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette, being introduced to the king and queen by the Marquis de Lafayette. In Paris, Harmar lived lavishly and beyond his means; burdened by debt, he soon left for the United States. Harmar wrote &quot;the expenses which must necessarily be incurred in living in, and in viewing this magnificent city [Paris] demand for the benefit of the United States my speedy embarkation&quot;.

Harmar was an original member of the Pennsylvania Society of the Cincinnati when it was founded on October 4, 1783. The same day, he was elected as the Society&#x27;s first secretary, a position he held for two years. Harmar married Sarah C. Jenkins on 10 October 1784 in Philadelphia.

==Service in the Northwest Territory==
In the 1780s, many Americans wished to settle the &quot;Old Northwest&quot; as the Midwest was known at the time, which of course meant displacing the Indian tribes living there. Supported by the British who still held fur-trading forts in the Old Northwest, the Indians of the Western Confederacy were resolved to oppose the Americans. The newly independent United States had almost no army, as the Continental Army had been disbanded with the Treaty of Paris in 1783. In 1784, the entire United States Army comprised just 55 artillerymen at West Point and 25 regulars at Fort Pitt (modern Pittsburgh). The weak central government was thus dependent on state militias, which were notoriously undertrained, ill-disciplined, badly funded, and loath to fight outside their home states. To enforce American claims upon the Old Northwest, on 3 June 1784, Congress authorized the first federal regiment, known as the First American Regiment, of about seven hundred men, to be supplied and paid for by Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Connecticut.

As the largest contingent (about 260 men) came from Pennsylvania, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was allowed to choose the commander of the regiment. Thomas Mifflin, an influential state politician and favorite of Washington&#x27;s, successfully pushed for Harmar to be named commander. This was despite Harmar&#x27;s lack of command experience, unfamiliarity with Indian diplomacy, and chronic alcoholism which had only worsened due to his lackluster financial situation. Harmar&#x27;s first task was to train the First American Regiment, imposing a rigorous training regime to create what was intended to be the core of a new United States Army. The general was known as a strict disciplinarian who would punish his soldiers harshly if their uniforms were dirty or rust appeared on their weapons. Harmar reported to Congress in September 1784 that his emphasis upon Prussian-style drill and discipline was having results as &quot;the troops begin to have a just idea of the noble profession of arms&quot;. Shortly afterwards, orders arrived to march to Fort Pitt with his forces and begin clearing the Northwest for American settlements. Harmar was not impressed with the people of Fort Pitt, writing that they &quot;lived in dirty log cabins and were prone to find joy in liquor and fighting&quot;.

As commander of the First American Regiment, Harmar was the senior officer in the United States Army from 1784 to 1791, commanding from the Revolutionary-era Fort McIntosh. Initially, the First American Regiment was to be based in Fort Pitt, but as the Indian chiefs he was to negotiate with did not want to travel far from their homes, Harmar relocated his command to Fort McIntosh. Harmar described Fort McIntosh when he found it as having been thoroughly looted by settlers heading for Kentucky, writing the settlers had &quot;destroyed the gates, drawn all the Nails from the roofs, taken off the boards and plundered it of every article&quot;. Harmar was impressed with the richness of the land of the Northwest. In 1785, he wrote to a friend: &quot;I wish you were here to view the beauties of Fort M&#x27;Intosh. What think you of pike of 24 lbs, a perch of 15 to 20 lbs, cat-fish of 40 lbs, bass, pickerel, sturgeon &amp;c &amp;c. You would certainly enjoy yourself.&quot; Harmar also enjoyed the strawberries growing in the wild, writing: &quot;The earth is most luxuriantly covered with them – we have them in such plenty that I am almost surfeited with them; the addition of fine rich cream is not lacking&quot;. He continued to struggle with alcohol; fellow officers noted that he drank excessive amounts of wine, cognac, whiskey and rum with meals. In a letter to his patron Mifflin, Harmar stated that stories of &quot;Venison, two or three inches deep cut of fat, turkey at once pence per pound, buffalo in abundance and catfish of one hundred pounds that are by no means exaggerated&quot;, going on to write that &quot;cornfields, gardens &amp;c, now appear in places which were lately the habitation of wild beasts. Such are the glories of industry.&quot;

Harmar signed the Treaty of Fort McIntosh on 21 January 1785, the same year that he ordered the construction of Fort Harmar near what is now Marietta, Ohio. Harmar did not think the treaty that he had just signed with the Delaware, Ottawa, Chippewa, and Wyandot, ceding what is now southeastern Ohio to the United States, to be worth much, writing: &quot;Between you and me, vain and ineffectual all treaties will be, until we take possession of the posts. One treaty held at Detroit would give dignity and consequence to the United States, and answer every purpose&quot;.

Until the creation of the Northwest Territory in 1787, the Northwest had no government beyond the U.S. Army, and even after the creation of the Northwest Territory, the area was administered by the War Department for several more years. At this time, hundreds of American settlers, anxious to acquire the rich lands beyond the Ohio River, had begun to illegally settle in the Old Northwest, and in March 1785, Harmar was ordered by Congress to evict the squatters as no land surveys had been performed yet nor had the U.S. government started the work of selling the land. Harmar described the evictions as a painful process as his soldiers had to force the settlers off their newly build homesteads and in his letters to Congress, the general asked that the land be promptly surveyed and sold before the entire Northwest was overrun by &quot;lawless bands whose actions are a disgrace to human nature&quot;. In May 1785, Thomas Hutchins was appointed &quot;Geographer of the United States&quot; by Congress and was ordered to go to the Northwest to conduct surveys, starting with the Seven Ranges. Harmar was ordered by Congress to escort and assist the land surveyors in their duties.

In September 1785, when Hutchins and his assistants arrived, Harmar assured him that he &quot;very safely repair with the Surveyors in the intersection of Pennsylvania with the Ohio&quot;. In October 1785, Harmar exercised his authority to build a new fort, named for himself, to base his men while the surveys were performed. At Fort Harmar, he supplied himself with expensive luxuries such as Windsor chairs, which led the American historian Wiley Sword to write that Harmar&#x27;s &quot;considerable urbanity may have rendered him somewhat suspect as an Indian fighter&quot;. In November 1785, Harmar reported to Congress that the early arrival of winter together with the fact that soldiers who were guarding the surveyors from Indians and squatters were &quot;barefoot and miserably off for clothing&quot; had ended the surveying for that year.

One Indian tribe who refused to sign a treaty giving up their lands was the Shawnee, and Harmar was ordered in October 1785 to advance to the Great Miami River against them. At the time, Congress took the viewpoint that the Indians living in the Old Northwest had by supporting the British in the Revolutionary War forfeited their land, from which they were to be evicted from, and the land handed over to American settlers. The Indians did not share this viewpoint that they were defeated peoples living on a land that rightfully belonged to the Americans, and many began to resist efforts to evict them.

As a commander, Harmar was a stern martinet who was much influenced by Baron Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben&#x27;s manual &quot;Regulations for the Order and Discipline of the Troops of the United States&quot;, better known as the &quot;Blue Book&quot; for the training of American troops. The American historian William Guthman noted: &quot;Steuben&#x27;s manual was aimed at combatting British and Hessian forces – not the backwoods guerilla fighting of the highly skilled American Indian warriors the regiment would eventually fight. Short-sightedness on the part of the military was the reason that no preparatory training in guerrilla warfare was ever imposed on the Army... no federal unit under Harmar or St. Clair was ever instructed in the frontiersmen&#x27;s method of war&quot;. Harmar, having no practical experience in Indian fighting, doggedly chose to train his men in this increasingly outmoded style rather than adapting them to the rigors of wilderness combat. Steuben, as chief trainer of the Continental Army, had introduced Prussian drill and discipline, turning the ragtag Continental Army into a formidable force. It is very unlikely that the Americans would have won the Revolutionary War without Steuben&#x27;s training, and as a result, Steuben was greatly admired by many American officers. One of those officers was Harmar, who at the time of his death in 1813, was still insisting to anyone who would listen that all that was needed for victory was to follow the precepts laid down in the Blue Book.

Harmar also supervised the construction of Fort Steuben near present-day Steubenville, Ohio. In June 1787, he reported to Congress that the Seven Ranges had been surveyed, and the white settlers could finally legally move in. He was brevetted as a brigadier general in July 1787. On 17 July 1787, Harmar visited Vincennes, at the time a mostly French-Canadian town, where he was welcomed by the &quot;principle French inhabitants&quot; and where he informed them that the area was now part of the United States. The people of Vincennes&#x27; previous encounters with the Americans had been with the lawless Kentucky militia, which led Harmar, in a letter to the people of Vincennes, to tell them that the men they met before were &quot;not real Americans&quot;. During his time at Vincennes, several Indian chiefs came to visit him, where Harmar sought to &quot;impress upon them as much as possible the majesty of the United States&quot; and the wish of the U.S. government &quot;to live in peace with them&quot;. Harmar then visited Cahokia and Kaskaskia whose inhabitants had not seen any representatives of the U.S. government since the Revolutionary War, and who Harmar reported had shown &quot;decent submission &amp; respect&quot; for the U.S. government. Harmar was finally received at St. Louis by Major Francisco Cruzat of the Spanish Army where Harmar reported he was &quot;politely entertained&quot; while noting that the entire Spanish garrison at St. Louis numbered only 20 men.

In April 1788, Harmar greeted an old comrade, Rufus Putnam of the Ohio Land Company, who had promoted &quot;Putnam&#x27;s Paradise&quot; in New England and later founded the village of Marietta next to Fort Harmar. Harmar reported in June 1788 that between December 1787-June 1788 at least 6,000 settlers had passed through Fort Harmar on their way to found settlements beyond the Ohio river, writing &quot;The Emigration is almost incredible&quot;. At the new village of Marietta, Harmar celebrated the Fourth of July in 1788 with Putnam, having his regiment march down the street in a parade. At Fort Harmar, he built a &quot;commodious fine house...an elegant building for this wooden part of the world&quot;, where his wife and his son Charles joined him.

As more and more settlers moved into the Northwest, more and more reports of violence between the settlers and the Indians reached Fort Harmar. Harmar complained that the government was tardy with paying his men or furnishing needed supplies, to which he was informed that because fewer than the requisite nine states were represented in Congress due to political disputes, it was impossible to pass a military budget. For this reason, Harmar welcomed the United States Constitution of 1787, which replaced the Articles of Confederation, expressing the hope that with a newly strong federal government, &quot;Anarchy and Confusion will now leave and that a vigorous government will take its place&quot;.

With low-level warfare in the Northwest between the Indians and the settlers now the norm, Harmar, joined by Governor of the Northwest Territory Arthur St. Clair, started talks in January 1789 with Indian leaders representing the remaining Iroquois, the Ottawa, Chippewa, Wyandot, Potawatomi, Sauk, and Lenape peoples, where the Indians were informed that they could either sell their land for a set price or face war. Both St. Clair and Harmar refused the Indian demand that no more white settlement be allowed beyond the Ohio River, and the resulting Treaty of Fort Harmar saw more land ceded to the United States. None of the Indian peoples living on the Wabash River attended the conference, having not been invited, and Harmar predicted that this would mean war with the Miami, the Shawnee and those Potawatomi living on the Wabash. One of Harmar&#x27;s aides called the Treaty of Fort Harmar a &quot;farce&quot;, done to placate Congress and the American public, and predicted that the Western Confederacy would fight.

Harmer directed the construction in 1789 of Fort Washington on the Ohio River (located in modern-day Cincinnati), which was built to protect the southern settlements in the Northwest Territory. Harmar arrived at the fort on December 28, 1789, and welcomed Governor St. Clair there three days later. By August 1789, enough reports had reached President Washington of widespread violence in the Northwest that he decided the situation required the &quot;immediate intervention of the General Government&quot;. War was now inevitable.

Harmar&#x27;s relations with his superiors were not good. President Washington&#x27;s War Secretary, Henry Knox, was a firm believer that the nation&#x27;s first line of defense should be the state militias and was hostile to the very idea of a standing army. Knox was a Revolutionary War veteran with a distinguished record, but as War Secretary, he proved to be an unsavory character whose principal interest was engaging in land speculation. As Secretary of War, Knox openly sold seized Indian land at rock-bottom prices to land companies (in which he happened to be a shareholder), which then marked up the land and sold it to American settlers. At the time, the rules on conflicts of interest did not exist and these transactions were legal, through widely viewed as unethical and morally dishonest. The high profitability of land sales led Knox to become a leading war hawk in New York (which at the time was the U.S. capital). At the same time, the Secretary&#x27;s stubborn refusal to allow for the proper organization of a federal army made the task of displacing the Indians more difficult than it otherwise would have been. Journalist and historian James Perry wrote that &quot;even Harmar&quot; saw the &quot;danger&quot; of Washington&#x27;s and Knox&#x27;s attempts to fight war in the Northwest on the cheap by forcing him to use independent state militiamen instead of U.S. Army troops under his direct control.

For his part, Harmar wrote: &quot;No person can hold a more contemptible opinion of the militia in general than I do... It is lamentable... that the government is so feeble as not to afford three or four regiments of national troops properly organized that would soon settle the business with these perfidious villains upon the Wabash.&quot; One of Harmar&#x27;s subordinates, Major Ebenezer Denny, called the Kentucky militia out to assist with conquering the Old Northwest &quot;raw and unused to the gun or the woods; indeed, many are without guns&quot;. Harmar complained that the men of the Pennsylvania militia were &quot;hardly able to bear arms - such as old, infirm men and young boys&quot;. The Pennsylvanians proved so unfit for duty that Harmar had no choice but to dismiss most of them from the army, leaving him with far fewer men than he had expected. Historian Michael S. Warner described the Kentucky and Pennsylvania militiamen as lacking &quot;discipline, experience and in many cases even muskets&quot;.

==Campaign against the Miamis==

In 1790, Harmar was sent on expeditions against Native Americans and the remaining British in the Northwest Territory, who continued to supply them with guns and ammunition. Furthermore, the Montreal-based North West Company had taken over the old French fur trading routes together with the services of the French-Canadian &quot;voyageurs&quot;, and thus had a vested interest in keeping the Northwest for their Indian suppliers. Knox in a letter on 7 June 1790 ordered Harmar &quot;to extirpate, utterly, if possible, the said Indian banditti&quot;. To prevent the outbreak of further hostilities, he sent word of Harmar&#x27;s campaign to Major Patrick Murray, commander of British-held Fort Detroit. The British quickly passed on this information to the local tribes and released as much gunpowder, ammunition, and firearms to them as they could.

Knox, who stood to greatly profit if the Indians were cleared out of the Northwest, seemed to have ordered the expedition in a moment of rage at the obstinate resistance of the Miami, Shawnee and Potawatomi peoples who fought his attempts to evict them; he didn&#x27;t bother asking Harmar&#x27;s opinion before making this decision. Knox, in his letters to Harmar, repeatedly advised him to move fast, strike hard, and avoid drinking, saying that sober generals were victorious generals. The frequency of the last warning indicated that Knox did not have much confidence in Harmar, which led Warner to question just why he was given the command in the first place given the evident doubts that both Washington and Knox had about him.

===Preparations===
Harmar&#x27;s reputation had preceded him, because of which, many of the militiamen from Kentucky and Pennsylvania were &quot;substitutes&quot; (men paid to take the place of the men who were called to serve). The state militias were paid $3/day, which led Warner to note that for a typical farmer, merchant, or craftsman, this would mean neglecting his property and leaving his family and friends behind to go on a dangerous mission across the Northwestern frontier for weeks, during which time he would earn little more than $60 for his troubles. Most draftees thus paid other men to impersonate them so as to avoid duty; often, these imposters were from the lowest rung of society. Harmar was further hampered in preparations for the campaign by having only two weeks to train his Kentucky militia and only a few days to train the Pennsylvania militia before his scheduled departure on 1 October 1790.

The original plan was for Harmar to take 1,300 militiamen and 353 regulars to sack and destroy Kekionga (modern Fort Wayne, Indiana), the capital of the Miami Indians, while Major Jean François Hamtramck diverted the Miami warriors by burning down villages on the Wabash river (Hamtramck was forced to retreat early due to a lack of supplies). Before going out on his expedition, Harmar was faced with quarrels among the various militia commanders as to who was to command whom, with Colonel James Trotter and Colonel John Hardin of the Kentucky militia openly feuding with one another. Shortly before the expedition began in September 1790, Knox wrote to Harmar accusing him of drunkenness, writing he had heard rumors that &quot;you are too apt to indulge yourself in a convivial glass&quot; to the extent that Harmar&#x27;s &quot;self-possession&quot; was now in doubt.

===Campaign===
Harmar&#x27;s inept training of his forces meant that they were expected to march in formation at all times. This led to the Americans getting quickly bogged down in the dense forest, averaging less than ten miles per day. Harmar had hoped to reach Kekionga fast enough to capture the British and French-Canadian fur traders, whom he called the &quot;real villains&quot; for their support of the Indian tribes, but his sluggish advance precluded this. Much to Harmar&#x27;s surprise, the preeminent Miami chieftain Little Turtle refused to give battle, instead retreating and burning the tribe&#x27;s villages and crop fields. On 13 October 1790, a frustrated Harmar sent out a light company commanded by Hardin to continue the pursuit. Like many Americans of his time, the general considered the Indians racially inferior; he failed to see any tactical intent in their constant retreats and instead believed that they were merely cowards unwilling to face his superior forces.

After getting lost and failing to find any Indians, Hardin finally reached Kekionga on 15 October to discover the town was empty and burning. The company promptly spread out far and wide as the militiamen went looking for loot to take home with them. Harmar reached Kekionga on 17 October 1790, and wrote to President Washington that same day to boast that he had won the war without firing a shot. Harmar got his first inkling of trouble later that night, when the Miami staged a raid and stole over a hundred pack and cavalry horses, which greatly reduced the mobility of Harmar&#x27;s force.

The next day, Harmar ordered Trotter to take about 300 men out to locate the stolen horses. Trotter marched into the woods, encountered one Indian riding a horse whom his party promptly shot down, and then another Indian whom they chased and killed. Afterwards, the colonel received reports from a scout that he had seen at least 50 Miami out in the woods, and he immediately ordered his men to withdraw back to camp. Hardin, who loathed Trotter, denounced him openly as a rank coward, even insulting him by claiming that &quot;he&quot; would stayed and fought the Miami if he was in Trotter&#x27;s position. Denny wrote in his diary that Hardin &quot;showed displeasure at Trotter&#x27;s return without executing the orders he had received, and desired the General to give him command of the detachment&quot;.

Harmar thus sent Hardin out early the next morning, 19 October, with 180 men, including 30 U.S. Army regulars. Denny wrote in his diary: &quot;I saw that the men moved off with great reluctance, and am satisfied that when three miles from the camp he [Hardin] had not more than two-thirds of his command; they dropped out of the ranks and returned to the camp.&quot; Hardin managed to lose one company of militia under Captain William Faulkner, which was left behind accidentally after his men stopped for a break. This led him to send Major James Fontaine and his cavalry to find them. In the meantime, Hardin stretched his column out over half a mile in the forest with 30 regulars led by Captain John Armstrong in the lead. At a meadow close to the Eel River, Hardin discovered the ground was covered with countless Miami trinkets, near what appeared to be an abandoned campfire. The militiamen immediately dispersed to start looting the site, despite warnings from Armstrong to stay in formation. Once the militiamen fell out of formation, Little Turtle, who had been watching from a hill, gave a signal to concealed Indians nearby to open fire on the Americans. Denny, who questioned the survivors, wrote in his diary: &quot;The Indians commenced a fire at the distance of 150 yards and advanced. The greatest number of militia fled without firing a shot; the 30 regulars that were part of the detachment stood and were cut to pieces&quot;. Cut off from retreat, Armstrong and his regulars, joined by only nine militiamen, stood their ground and managed to return fire. When the Americans tried to reload, they were instantly overrun by a force of Miami, Shawnee and Potawatomi Indians armed with tomahawks.

In the ensuring battle, the Americans fought bravely, but were annihilated and cut down. Armstrong, who escaped into a swamp and feigned death, reported that &quot;They fought and died hard&quot;. Afterwards, the bodies of the Americans slain on the field were all scalped and hacked to pieces. As the fear-stricken militiamen were running away, they ran into reinforcements led by Fontaine and Faulkner, leading one militiaman to shout: &quot;For God&#x27;s sake, retreat! You will all be killed. There are Indians enough to eat you all up!&quot;. Harmar was deeply shocked when Hardin and what was left of his force stumbled into camp to report their defeat. A furious Armstrong arrived at the camp the next day, cursing the &quot;dastardly&quot; behavior of the Kentucky militia and vowed never to fight with them again. Harmar, for his part, threatened to bring down cannon fire on the Kentucky militia if he should ever see them retreating back to camp in disorder again. Unknown to Harmar, the victorious Indians were already positioned near his camp, but at a war council, the decision was made to retreat and wait for Harmar to make the next move.

On 20 October, Denny wrote in his diary that: &quot;The army all engaged burning and destroying everything that could be of use: corn, beans, pumpkins, stacks of hay, fencing and cabins, &amp;c&quot;. Despite Hardin&#x27;s defeat, Harmar was content that enough damage had been inflicted on the Indians and his mission was therefore complete. On 21 October, Harmar ordered his men to return to Fort Washington, much to the general relief of his hungry and frightened soldiers. After leaving Kekionga, Hardin suggested to Harmar that the Americans make a surprise advance to Kekionga to try and ambush the returning Miami. Hamar initially rejected this suggestion, but Hardin insisted that the &quot;honor&quot; of the Kentucky militia demanded such a gesture; it is likely that Hardin was more concerned with his reputation after the inglorious performance of the militiamen in the battle by the Eel River, and was seeking a personal triumph. Harmar finally agreed and in Denny&#x27;s words &quot;ordered out four hundred choice men, to be under the command of Major John Wyllys, to return to the towns, intending to surprise any parities that might be assembled there&quot;. Major Wyllys in his last letter complained: &quot;We are about agoing forth to war in this part of the world. I expect to have not a very agreeable campaign... Tis probable the Indians will fight us in earnest, the greater part of our force will consist of militia; therefore there is some reason to apprehend trouble.&quot;

===Harmar&#x27;s Defeat===
Harmar&#x27;s force of Federal troops and militia were badly defeated by a tribal coalition led by Little Turtle in an engagement known as &quot;Harmar&#x27;s Defeat&quot;, &quot;the Battle of the Maumee&quot;, &quot;the Battle of Kekionga&quot;, or &quot;the Battle of the Miami Towns&quot;. Under the sky free of clouds and a full moon, Harmar sent out 60 U.S. Army soldiers and 340 militiamen under Wyllys, with Hardin as second in command, on the evening of October 21 back to Kekionga.

The American force was divided into three, with Major Horatio Hall to lead 150 militiamen across the St. Mary&#x27;s River to strike from the east, Major James McMillian attacking from the west, and Wyllys and the regulars striking frontally at Kekionga. October 22 was a warm, sunny October day and the mood among the American forces was an upbeat one. It was known that the Indians would usually avoid combat except on the most advantageous terms, with the only exception being when their women and children were in danger. Harmar and his officers believed that by attacking the Indian villages directly, Little Turtle would be forced into a pitched battle where they would have the upper hand. Warner described the concept behind the plan as sound, but noted its execution left too much unplanned; there was no co-ordination between the three wings advancing on Kekionga, and no contingency plans if the element of surprise was lost. 
The militia under Hall and McMillian panicked and fired on the first Indians they ran into, alerting the Miami to the American presence. They then broke rank to pursue fleeing tribesmen down the St. Joseph&#x27;s River, leaving Wyllys to lead his attack unsupported. McMillian and Hall proved unable to control their men. One officer testifying at Harmar&#x27;s court-martial in 1791 stated that the militia&#x27;s impulsiveness caused Indian women and children to go &quot;flying in all directions&quot; from Kekionga, and stated that in his opinion, Harmar should have called off the attack and retreated while he still had the chance. 
Little Turtle concentrated his main force at a ford in the Maumee River, where they set an ambush. As the Americans were crossing the Maumee, a survivor of the battle, Private John Smith, later recalled that he saw &quot;the opposite riverbank erupt in sheets of flame. Horse and riders were struck down as if by some whirlwind force.&quot; Soon, the Maumee ran red with American blood, which led Jean Baptiste Richardville, a half-French, half-Miami chief, to later remark that he could have walked against the Maumee dry-footed as the river was clogged with American bodies. Major Fontaine drew his sword and charged forward at the opposite bank, shouting &quot;Stick with me!&quot;. The Indians simply concentrated their fire on Fontaine&#x27;s charge, leaving him badly wounded. He later bled to death. Hearing the shooting, McMillian led his own men in an attempt to out-flank Little Turtle. The chief fell back towards the river, and the militia chased him as his warriors also scattered seemingly in fear.

Upon entering spread out helter-skelter in a cornfield, the Americans were astonished to hear what one veteran later recalled was a &quot;hideous yell&quot; as a huge number of Miami emerged from the underbrush. The Americans had only enough time to fire off one disorganized volley before they were forced to engage in desperate hand-to-hand fighting with their steel bayonets, swords and knives against the tomahawks, spears and knives of the Miami. Wyllys, along with 50 U.S. regulars and 68 militiamen, fell as a consequence of the uncoordinated attack, and their bodies were all scalped. The Indians mockingly referred to the battle site as a &quot;pumpkin field&quot; as the bloody heads of the Americans lying out in the open reminded them of pumpkins.

One of the survivors was Hardin, who upon reaching Harmar&#x27;s camp reported that his Kentuckians had fought &quot;charmingly&quot; and lied that he had won a great victory. Harmar was about to march out when a different report arrived, revealing the extent of the defeat. Harmar ordered Major James Ray to find the dead Americans, but only 30 men volunteered, and he turned back after marching just three miles. The general then ordered a full retreat, leaving the fallen soldiers unburied. Little Turtle could have finished off Harmar&#x27;s crippled force, which was saved only by a lunar eclipse that the Indians regarded as a bad omen. Taking out his anger on the remaining militia, Harmar forced them to march back at bayonet-point to discourage mutiny.

===Aftermath===
When Harmar reached Fort Washington on November 3, 1790, the public was outraged to learn of his defeat. The general sent false reports to Knox omitting the disaster, but the truth soon came out, with militiamen giving interviews to the press accusing Harmar of alcoholism, cowardice and incompetence. The fact that Harmar had never exposed himself to fire led to rumors appearing in the newspapers that he had spent the campaign drunk in his tent. When the news reached New York, President Washington wrote to a friend: &quot;I expected little from the moment I heard he was a drunkard&quot;. Warner noted that the campaign&#x27;s failure was largely due to poorly planning on the part of Washington&#x27;s administration, which had stated that the aim of Harmar&#x27;s efforts was to &quot;chastise&quot; the Indians of the Northwest by burning down their crops and homes without necessarily bringing Little Turtle to battle, through Harmar was to do so if possible; the ambiguity on this point helps to explain Harmar&#x27;s confusion about what he was supposed to do.

Warner also argued that, though Harmar did not have the best troops under his command, he exacerbated the problem with his poor leadership and lack of experience. In particular, Harmar should have known that the Indians preferred using ambushes, and that Little Turtle would never fight his army on open terrain. Harmar&#x27;s failure to recover the bodies of the dead was disastrous for morale, as it persuaded his men that he was both a coward and indifferent to their lives. The American dead of Kekionga were not finally buried until 1794, when the Battle of Fallen Timbers decisively ended the war.

In the national rage caused by the debacle, bashing Harmar become a favorite pastime of the newspapers, but Perry wrote that Harmar was a scapegoat, and the ultimate responsibility rested with President Washington. Perry wrote:

Harmar, in fact, became something of a scapegoat. Washington was just as culpable. He could have insisted on a more experienced, more able officer to lead the expedition. He didn&#x27;t. He could have demanded the troops be trained in frontier fighting, for he, more than anyone else, knew all about that. He didn&#x27;t. He could, in fact, have done his best to build a decent little army for a nasty little war. He didn&#x27;t do that, either. And now he made an even bigger blunder. He named Arthur St. Clair, governor of the territory, as Harmar&#x27;s replacement, with the rank of major general, and asked him to try again. Harmar was a calamity; St. Clair would be a catastrophe.

===Court martial===
Harmar was subsequently court-martialed at his own request, on various charges of negligence, and exonerated by a court of inquiry. During the trial, he had a run in with author and Revolutionary veteran John Robert Shaw, who wrote about the general in his autobiography &quot;John Robert Shaw: An Autobiography of Thirty Years 1777–1807&quot;.

==Later life==
Harmar was removed from full command in March 1791, but remained in the Army until resigning on January 1, 1792. He returned to Pennsylvania, where Mifflin, by then governor, appointed him as the state&#x27;s adjutant general; he served from 1793 until retiring in 1799. Harmar was popular in Philadelphia during his last years, being described as well &quot;regarded by all who knew him, for he was of genial manner&quot;. Harmar was described as &quot;tall and well-built, with a manly port, blue eyes, and keen martial glance. He was very bald, wore a cocked hat, and his powdered hair in a cue&quot;.

==Death and legacy==
Harmar died in what was then near Philadelphia (but now considered South Philadelphia) at his estate, &quot;The Retreat near Gray&#x27;s Ferry and the Schuylkill River. He is buried at the Episcopal Church of St. James Kingsessing, in West Philadelphia. His widow was the former Sarah Jenkins (1760–1848). In addition to one son and a daughter who died as children, Harmar had a daughter, Eliza Harmar Thomas (1787–1869), and sons Josiah Harmar (1802–1848); who would, in turn, have a son and grandson with the same name, but who lived in Connecticut) and William Harmar (1803–1878).

<text>Chinook Jargon (&#x27; or&#x27;, also known simply as &quot;Chinook&quot; or &quot;Jargon&quot;) is a language originating as a pidgin trade language in the Pacific Northwest. It spread during the 19th century from the lower Columbia River, first to other areas in modern Oregon and Washington, then to British Columbia and parts of Alaska, Northern California, Idaho and Montana. It sometimes took on the characteristics of a creole language. The contact language Chinook Jargon should not be confused with the Indigenous language Chinook.

Reflecting its origins in early trade transactions, approximately 15 percent of its lexicon is French. It also makes use of English loan words and those of other language systems. Its entire written form is in the Duployan shorthand developed by French priest Émile Duployé.

Many words from Chinook Jargon remain in common use in the Western United States and British Columbia. It has been described as part of a multicultural heritage shared by the modern inhabitants of the Pacific Northwest. The total number of Jargon words in published lexicons is in the hundreds. It has a simple grammatical system. In Chinook Jargon, the consonant is rare. Such English and French loan words as &quot;rice&quot; and , for instance, have changed after being adopted to the Jargon, to &#x27; and&#x27;, respectively.

==Name==
Most books written in English still use the term Chinook Jargon, but some linguists working with the preservation of a creolized form of the language used in Grand Ronde, Oregon, prefer the term &quot;Chinuk Wawa&quot; (with the spelling &#x27;Chinuk&#x27; instead of &#x27;Chinook&#x27;). Historical speakers did not use the name &quot;Chinook Wawa&quot;, but rather &quot;the Wawa&quot; or &quot;Lelang&quot; (from Fr. , the language, or tongue). &quot;Wawa&quot; also means speech or words; &quot;have a wawa&quot; means &quot;hold a parley&quot;, even in modern idiomatic English, &quot;Lelang&quot; also means the physical bodypart, the tongue.

The name for the Jargon varied throughout the territory in which it was used. For example: &quot;skokum hiyu&quot; in the Boston Bar-Lytton area of the Fraser Canyon. In many areas it was simply &quot;the old trade language&quot; or &quot;the Hudson Bay language&quot;.

==History==
===Origins===
Whether Jargon was a post-contact or pre-contact language has been the subject of debate among scholars. In 2016, linguist John Lyon studied the word lists collected by Francis Drake and his crew on the 1579 voyage that took them to the Oregon coast. Lyon compared the seven words and phrases found on the Native vocabulary list recorded by Drake and his men with the vocabularies of Native languages on the west coast (Lyon 2016).

Of the five single words on the list, Lyon found that the word &quot;petáh,&quot; which was the Native word for a root that can be eaten raw or made into cakes called &quot;cheepe&quot;, were meaning matches for the Jargon words &#x27;wapato&#x27; (a root that tastes like a potato) and &#x27;chaplill&#x27;, the word for the bread cakes made from this root (Lyon 2016:41). The word recorded for &#x27;king&#x27; by Drake was &#x27;hióh&#x27; (recorded also as &#x27;hioghe&#x27;). Lyon thought it was a match for the Wawa word hi-yú, meaning a gathering, or much, plenty. Lyon was not able to conclude whether Drake encountered people of the Northwest Coast.

In 2021, Melissa Darby studied the ethnographic records and the records left by Francis Drake&#x27;s expedition. She found new evidence that the people Drake met were speaking some Jargon words to Drake and his men.

The pre-contact hypothesis states that the language developed prior to European settlement as an intra-indigenous contact language in a region marked by divisive geography and intense linguistic diversity. It eventually expanded to incorporate elements of European languages, with approximately 15 percent of its lexicon derived from French. The Jargon also acquired English loanwords, and its written form is entirely in the Duployan shorthand created by French priest Émile Duployé.

The post-contact hypothesis suggests the language originated in Nootka Sound after the arrival of Russian and Spanish traders as a means of communicating between them and indigenous peoples. It eventually spread further south due to commercial use. University of Ottawa linguist David Lang has argued for this conclusion.

Linguist Barbara Harris suggests a dual genesis, positing that both origins probably have some legitimacy and that the two varieties eventually blended together.

By 1840, Chinook Jargon had creolized into a native language for some speakers.

===Use===

In the Diocese of Kamloops, British Columbia, hundreds of speakers learned to read and write the Jargon using Duployan shorthand via the publication &quot;Kamloops Wawa&quot;. As a result, the Jargon had the beginnings of its own literature, mostly translated scripture and classical works, some local and episcopal news, community gossip and events, and diaries. Marah Ellis Ryan (c. 1860–1934), an early Native American activist and novelist, used Chinook words and phrases in her writing.

In Oregon, Chinook Jargon was widely used by natives, trappers, traders, employees of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, missionaries, and pioneers who came across the Oregon Trail from the 1830s to the 1870s. In Portland&#x27;s first half century (1840s–1890s), there were frequent trade interactions between pioneers and Native Americans. Many Oregonians used Jargon in casual conversation. Jones estimates that in pioneer times in the 1860s there were about 100,000 speakers of Chinook Jargon. It peaked in usage from approximately 1858 to 1900, and declined as a result of widespread deaths from the Spanish flu and World War I.

As late as the 1940s, native children were born in Tiller, Oregon, who grew up speaking Chinook Jargon as their first language. But by 1962, the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL) estimated that only 100 speakers were left.

In the 2000s, Lane Community College in Eugene, Oregon, started a three-semester university program teaching Chinook Jargon.

In 2013, it was reported that there was one native speaker of Chinook Jargon (specifically the Grand Ronde variety). An estimated 1,000 people had oral or written knowledge of Chinook Jargon as a second language. In 2015, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated based on the self-reported American Community Survey that around 45 people (with a margin of error of 25) spoke Chinook Jargon at home in the period 2009–2013.

According to Nard Jones, Chinook Jargon was still in use in Seattle until roughly the eve of World War II, especially among the members of the Arctic Club. Seattle was the last city where the language was widely used. Writing in 1972, Jones remarked that &quot;Only a few can speak it fully, men of ninety or a hundred years old, like Henry Broderick, the realtor, and Joshua Green, the banker.&quot;

==Evolution==
There is some controversy about the origin of the Jargon, but the consensus is that the pidgin peaked in use during the 19th century. During this era, many dictionaries were published to help settlers interact with the First Nations people living in the Pacific Northwest. Local settler families exchanged communiqués that were stylishly composed entirely in &quot;the Chinook.&quot; Many residents of the British Columbia city of Vancouver spoke Chinook Jargon as their first language, even using it at home in preference to English. Among the first Europeans to use Chinook Jargon were traders, trappers, voyageurs, coureurs des bois, and Catholic missionaries.

The original Jargon was a pidgin, originally used as a second language by speakers of other Native American languages in the area. It had sentence-initial negation, which is atypical of regional languages, and also had no typical complex morphology. It had an SVO structure, while Chinookan and Salishan languages were VSO. However, local Athabaskan languages were SOV, so this was probably a result of contact — a cross-language compromise. Only later did Chinook Jargon acquire significant English and French lexical items.

The Jargon is influenced by individuals&#x27; accents and terms from their native languages; as Kanakas married into First Nations and non-native families, their particular mode of the Jargon is believed to have contained Hawaiian words or Hawaiian styles of pronunciation. In some areas, the adoption of further non-aboriginal words has been observed. During the gold rush, Chinook Jargon was used in British Columbia at first by gold prospectors and Royal Engineers; as industry developed, Chinook Jargon was often used by cannery workers, hop pickers, loggers, fishermen, and ranchers. It is possible that, at one point, the population of British Columbia spoke Chinook Jargon more than any other language, even English. Historian Jane Barman wrote:
A heavily creolized form of Chinook Jargon is still spoken as a first language by some residents of Oregon, much as the Métis language Michif is spoken in Canada. Hence, Chinuk Wawa, as it is known in Oregon, is now a creole language, distinct from the varied pronunciation of the Chinook Jargon. There is evidence that in some communities (e.g., around Fort Vancouver) the Jargon had become creolized by the early 19th century, and that would have been among the mixed French/Métis, Algonkian, Scots and Hawaiian populations, as well as among the natives around the Fort. At Grand Ronde, the resettlement of tribes from all over Oregon in a multi-tribal agency led to the use of Chinuk Wawa as a common tongue among the linguistically diverse population. These circumstances led to the creolization of Chinuk Wawa at Grand Ronde. There is also evidence that creolization occurred at the Confederated Tribes of Siletz reservation paralleling Grand Ronde, although, due to language revitalization efforts being focused on the Tolowa language, Chinuk fell out of use.

No studies of British Columbia versions of the Jargon have demonstrated creolization. The range of varying usages and vocabulary in different regions suggests that localization did occur—although not on the pattern of Grand Ronde where Wasco, Klickitat and other peoples adopted and added to the version of the Jargon that developed there. First-language speakers of the Chinook Jargon were common in BC (native and non-native), until the mid-20th century. After 1850, the Wawa was still used in the United States portion of the Chinook-speaking world, especially in wilderness areas and work environments. Local creolization&#x27;s probably did occur in British Columbia, but recorded materials have not been studied as they were made due to the focus on the traditional aboriginal languages.

There is a belief that something similar to the Jargon existed before European contact—without European words in its vocabulary. There is some evidence for a Chinookan-Nuu-chah-nulth lingua franca in the writings of John Jewitt and in what is known as the Barclay Sound word-list, from the area of Ucluelet and Alberni. Others believe that the Jargon was formed during contact.

Current scholarly opinion holds that a trade language probably existed before European contact, which began &quot;morphing&quot; into the more familiar Chinook Jargon in the late 1790s, notably at a dinner party at Nootka Sound where Capts Vancouver and Bodega y Quadra were entertained by Chief Maquinna and his brother Callicum performing a theatrical using mock English and mock Spanish words and mimicry of European dress and mannerisms. There evidently was Jargon in use in Queen Charlotte, but this &quot;Haida Jargon&quot; is not known to have shared anything in common with Chinook Jargon or with the Nootkan-Chinookan &quot;proto-jargon&quot;, which is its main foundation.

==Orthographies==
There are a few main spelling variations of Chinook Jargon but each individual writer also had their own spelling variations.

# English, French and German-based spelling – In a general sense, when words were derived from English or French, the original English/French spellings were used. Words not derived from English/French were written in an approximate spelling based on mainstream English, French or German spelling. This would mean, for example, &quot;kloochman&quot; (from Nootka &quot;&quot;) for &quot;woman, wife&quot;, &quot;house&quot; (English origin) for &quot;house&quot;, and &quot;le clou&quot; (French origin) for &quot;nail, claw&quot;. This spelling does not take into account the actual mainstream pronunciation of the words in Chinook Jargon.
# Approximate sound-based spelling – With every writer having their own variation of a fairly standardized spelling based on their own dialect, the same examples above could be &quot;tlotchmin, haws, leklo&quot;.
# IPA-based spelling for use on smartphones and early computers – This was used on the Chinook Jargon Listserve in the 1990s and other places where it was difficult or impossible to type using actual IPA symbols. Compare X-SAMPA, another ASCII transcription of IPA.
# IPA-based Grand Ronde spelling – This is only used by speakers of the Grand Ronde dialect in Oregon.

==Contemporary status==

Many words are still used throughout Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, the Yukon, and Alaska. It was the working language in canneries on the British Columbia Coast. Place names throughout this region bear Jargon names and words that are preserved in various rural industries such as logging and fishing. Linguist David Douglas Robertson and others have described Chinook Jargon as part of the shared cultural heritage of modern inhabitants of the Pacific Northwest.

, the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon was taking steps to preserve Chinook Jargon use through a full immersion head start/preschool that was conducted in Chinuk Wawa. The Confederated Tribes also offer Chinuk Wawa lessons at their offices in Eugene and Portland. In addition, Lane Community College offers two years of Chinuk Wawa study that satisfy the second-language graduation requirements of Oregon public universities. In March 2012, the tribe published a Chinuk Wawa dictionary through University of Washington Press.

At her swearing-in as lieutenant governor in 2001, Iona Campagnolo concluded her speech in Chinook, saying &quot;&quot;Chinook for &quot;everyone was thrown together to make this strange new country [British Columbia]&quot;, .

An art installation featuring Chinook Jargon, &quot;Welcome to the Land of Light&quot; by Henry Tsang, can be viewed on the Seawall along False Creek in downtown Vancouver, British Columbia, between Davie and Drake streets. Translation into Chinook Jargon was done by Duane Pasco.

A short film using Chinook Jargon, &quot;Small Pleasures&quot; by Karin Lee, explores intercultural dialogue between three women of different cultural and linguistic backgrounds in 1890s Barkerville in northern British Columbia.

== Revitalization attempt ==

=== Grand Ronde ===
In 1997, the Grand Ronde reservation in Northern Oregon hired Tony Johnson, a Chinook linguist, to head its language program. Chinuk Wawa was chosen due to its strong connection to native identity on the reservation as well as being the only indigenous language still spoken at Grand Ronde. Prior to this, there were formal Chinuk Wawa classes taught by Eula Holmes from 1978 until her death in 1986. Eula Holmes&#x27; sister, Ila, held informal and sporadic classes to teach the language to the public. Henry Zenk was brought onto the project in 1998 after having previous experience with the language, documenting it in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Community classes were started in the summer of 1998, and a dictionary was released in 2012. This dictionary was compiled from the Chinuk Wawa of Grand Ronde elders, chiefly from the Hudson, Wacheno and Riggs families. The dictionary features a section on Chinuk Wawa recorded by natives of the lower Columbia but not used by the elders at Grand Ronde. In 2014, the tribe made an app spanning traditional and modern vocabulary.

In 2001, with funding from the Administration for Native Americans, the tribe started an immersion preschool. A kindergarten was started in 2004 by Kathy Cole, a tribal member and certified teacher, which has since expanded to a half-day immersion K–4 with slots for 25 students at Willamina Elementary School. Cole also started Chinuk Wawa elective classes at Willamina High School in 2011. Students there and at Willamina Middle School can earn high school and college credit for completion of the course. Lane Community College also teaches a two-year course of Chinuk Wawa.

=== British Columbia ===
By 2012, it was discovered that there was only one person left in British Columbia who had learned Chinook Jargon from Elders. That person was Jay Powell, a University of British Columbia anthropological linguist who had dedicated himself to the revitalization of Indigenous languages. A small group led by Sam Sullivan formed around him, organizing learning sessions and starting the BC Chinook Jargon initiative website. Sullivan&#x27;s efforts to expand public awareness of Chinook Jargon have included an interview with Powell conducted entirely in that language. The interview was organized through Kumtuks, a British Columbia focused educational video series whose name comes from the Chinook word for knowledge.

The online magazine &quot;Kaltash Wawa&quot; was founded in November 2020 using BC Chinook Jargon and written in Chinuk Pipa, the alphabet based on Dupoyan shorthand.

==Influence on English==
British Columbian English and Pacific Northwest English have several words still in current use which are loanwords from the Chinook Jargon, which was widely spoken throughout the Pacific Northwest by all ethnicities well into the middle of the 20th century. These word tend to strongly index a local settler identity. Some words used to be shared with the Yukon, Alberta, Oregon, Washington, Alaska and, to a lesser degree, Idaho and western Montana.

===Chinook Jargon words used by English-language speakers===

* Cheechako – &#x27;newcomer&#x27;; the word is formed from &quot;chee&quot; (&#x27;new&#x27;) + &quot;chako&quot; (&#x27;come&#x27;) and was used to refer to non-native people.
* Chuck – &#x27;water&#x27;; and thus &quot;saltchuck&quot; &#x27;salt water&#x27;. Colchuck Peak and Colchuck Glacier in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness take their name from Colchuck Lake, &#x27;cold water&#x27;. The name of the Skookum-chuck river means &#x27;strong-water&#x27;, &#x27;rapids&#x27;.
* Cultus – &#x27;bad, worthless, useless&#x27;, &#x27;ordinary&#x27;, or &#x27;evil, taboo&#x27;. &quot;Cultus iktus&quot; means &#x27;worthless junk&#x27;.
* Hiyu – less common nowadays, but still heard in some places to mean &#x27;party&#x27; or &#x27;gathering&#x27;. From the Chinook for &#x27;many, several, lots of&#x27;. The Big Hiyu (also known as &quot;The July&quot;) was a week-long joint celebration of the July 1 Dominion Day and July 4 Independence Day holidays in the Fraser Canyon town of Lillooet, featuring horse races, gambling, a rodeo and other festivities. A &quot;tenas hiyu&quot; (&#x27;small gathering&#x27;) was on a much smaller scale. The community of West Seattle has celebrated the month of July for more than 75 years with the HiYu Summer Festival.
* Iktus – &#x27;stuff&#x27;; also pronounced &quot;itkus&quot; with &quot;t&quot; and &quot;k&quot; reversed.
* Klootchman or klootch – in the Jargon meaning simply &#x27;a woman&#x27; or &#x27;female&quot; (of anything) – &quot;klootchman kiuatan&quot; (&#x27;mare&#x27;), &quot;klootchman lecosho&quot; (&#x27;sow&#x27;), &quot;tenas klootchman&quot; or &quot;klootchman tenas&quot; (&#x27;girl, female child&#x27;). Still in use in English in some areas and with people of an older background to mean a First Nations woman, or to refer to the wives/women attached to a certain group in a joking way e.g. &quot;we sent all the klootchman to the kitchen while we played cards&quot;. Unlike its male equivalent &quot;siwash&quot;, &quot;klootchman&quot; does not generally have a derisive tone nowadays (when used).
* Masi – &#x27;thank you&#x27;. In northern British Columbia and the Yukon, and used in broadcast English in those areas, the Chinook Jargon adaption of the French remains common, i.e. &quot;mahsi&quot; or &quot;masi&quot;, with the accent on the first syllable (unlike in French).
* It is possible that the slang term &quot;moolah&quot;, meaning &#x27;money&#x27; in American slang, comes from the Jargon word &quot;moolah&quot; meaning &#x27;mill&#x27; in Chinook (lumber mills were a source of wealth in the PNW).
* Mucky muck or – in the Jargon means &#x27;plenty of food&#x27; and came to connote one who lived well, thus in colloquial English an important or officious person. On long-distance journeys such as for trade the &quot;muckamuck&quot; of the expedition referred to an experienced trustworthy person (but not necessarily wealthy) chosen to lead the expedition and among other duties was tasked with portioning out and protecting the food supply. Related to this is &quot;high muckety muck&quot;, or Chinook &quot;hyas muckamuck&quot;.
* Potlatch – in Chinook Jargon is a ceremony among certain tribes involving food and exchange of gifts, nowadays sometimes used to refer to a potluck dinner or sometimes the giving away of personal items to friends.
* Quiggly, quiggly hole – refers to the remains of an old Indian pit-house, or underground house, from &quot;kickwillie&quot; or &quot;kekuli&quot;, which in the Jargon means &#x27;down&#x27; or &#x27;underneath, beneath&#x27;.
* Siwash – ( ) properly a First Nations man, but sometimes used for women as well. The origins and meaning may be considered pejorative and derogatory French . When pronounced , with the rhythm of the original French, it is used by modern speakers of the Chinook Jargon in Grand Ronde, Oregon, with the context of meaning a Native American, or as an adjective connoting connection thereto, such as in Siwash Rock or Siwash Sweaters. The pronunciation is considered offensive in Grand Ronde.
* Skookum – The most versatile is &quot;skookum&quot;, which was used in the Jargon either as a verb auxiliary for &#x27;to be able&#x27; or an adjective for &#x27;able, strong, big&#x27;, &#x27;genuine&#x27;, &#x27;reliable&#x27; – which sums up its use in British Columbian English, although there is a wide range of possible usages: &quot;skookum house&quot; is &#x27;jail&#x27;, prison&#x27; (&quot;house&quot; in the Jargon could mean anything from a building to a room). &quot;He&#x27;s a skookum guy&quot; means that the person is solid and reliable, while &quot;we need somebody who&#x27;s skookum&quot; means that a strong and large person is needed. A carpenter, after banging a stud into place, might check it and decide, &quot;Yeah, that&#x27;s skookum&quot;. Asking for affirmation, someone might say &quot;is that skookum&quot; or &quot;is that skookum with you?&quot; &quot;Skookum&quot; can also be translated simply as &#x27;O.K.&#x27;, but it means something a bit more emphatic.
* Tenas – &#x27;small&#x27;.
* Tillicum – &#x27;people/person&#x27;, &#x27;family&#x27;, and &#x27;people&#x27;.
* Tolo – used in Western Washington to mean a semi-formal dance, analogous to the homecoming ball, to which girls ask boys. From the Chinook for &#x27;to win&#x27;.
* Tyee – &#x27;leader, chief, boss&#x27;. Also &quot;Big Tyee&quot; in the context of &#x27;boss&#x27; or well-known person. In Campbell River and in the sport-fishing business, a really big chinook salmon is a Tyee. In the Jargon &quot;Tyee&quot; meant chief, and could also be an adjective denoting &#x27;big&#x27;, as with &quot;tyee salmon&quot; or &quot;tyee lamel&quot; (&#x27;boss mule&#x27;). A &quot;hyas tyee&quot; means &#x27;important/big ruler/leader&#x27;, and is also sometimes used in English in the same way as &quot;Big Tyee&quot;. e.g. &quot;He was the undisputed hyas tyee of all the country between the Johnstone Strait and Comox&quot;. This was also the common title used for the famous chiefs of the early era, such as Maquinna, for whom it was applied by Captain Vancouver and others in the context of &#x27;king&#x27;. The &quot;Hyas Klootchman Tyee&quot; – &#x27;Great Woman Ruler&#x27;, roughly &#x27;Her Majesty&#x27; – was the historical term for Queen Victoria. The word &quot;tyee&quot; was commonly used and still occurs in some local English usages meaning &#x27;boss&#x27; or &#x27;someone in charge&#x27;. Business and local political and community figures of a certain stature from some areas are sometimes referred to in the British Columbia papers and histories by the old chiefly name worn by Maquinna, Concomly and Nicola. A man called &quot;hyas tyee&quot; would have been a senator, a longtime MP or MLA, or a business magnate with a strong local powerbase, long-time connections, and wealth from and because of the area. There is a popular British Columbia news site named &quot;The Tyee&quot;. Beginning in 1900, &quot;Tyee&quot; was also the title of the University of Washington yearbook.

<doc id="185096" wikidata="Q13365614" url="?curid=185096" title="Pontiff">
<text>A pontiff () was, in Roman antiquity, a member of the most illustrious of the colleges of priests of the Roman religion, the College of Pontiffs. The term &quot;pontiff&quot; was later applied to any high or chief priest and, in Roman Catholic ecclesiastical usage, to bishops, especially the Pope, who is sometimes referred to as the Roman Pontiff or the Supreme Pontiff.
==Etymology==
The English term derives through Old French &quot;pontif&quot; from Latin &quot;pontifex&quot;, a word commonly held to come from the Latin root words &quot;pons&quot;, &quot;pont-&quot; (bridge) + &quot;facere&quot; (to do, to make), and so to have the literal meaning of &quot;bridge-builder&quot;, presumably between mankind and the deity/deities. Uncertainty prevailing, this may be only a folk etymology, but it may also recall ancient tasks and magic rites associated with bridges. The term may also be an allusion to Ancient Roman Religious rituals for placating the gods and spirits associated with the Tiber River, for instance. Also, Varro cites this position as meaning &quot;able to do&quot;.

==Ancient Rome==

There were four chief colleges of priests in ancient Rome, the most illustrious of which was that of the &quot;pontifices&quot;. The others were those of the &quot;augures&quot;, the &quot;quindecimviri sacris faciundis&quot;, and the &quot;epulones&quot;. The same person could be a member of more than one of these groups. Including the &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;, who was president of the college, there were originally three or five &quot;pontifices&quot;, but the number increased over the centuries, finally becoming 16 under Julius Caesar. By the third century BC the pontiffs had assumed control of the state religious system.

== Biblical usage ==
Inspiration for the Catholic use of the name &quot;pontiff&quot; for a bishop comes from the use of the same word for the Jewish High Priest in the original Latin translation of the Bible, the Vulgate, where it appears 59 times. For example at , &quot;pontifices&quot; (plural) is the Latin term used for &quot;The Chief Priests&quot;. And in the Vulgate version of the Letter to the Hebrews, &quot;pontifex&quot; (singular) is repeatedly used with reference to the then still extant High Priesthood in Judaism, and analogously suggesting Jesus Christ as the ultimate high priest.

==Catholicism==

The word &quot;pontiff&quot;, though now most often used in relation to a pope, technically refers to any Catholic bishop. The phrase &quot;Roman pontiff&quot; is therefore not tautological, but means &quot;Bishop of Rome&quot;. In the same way, a Pontifical Mass is a mass celebrated by a bishop, not necessarily a pope. Note also the &quot;Roman Pontifical&quot; (the liturgical book containing the prayers and ceremonies for rites used by a bishop) and &quot;pontificals&quot;, the insignia of his order that a bishop uses when celebrating Pontifical Mass. While the pontificals primarily belong to bishops, they have also been granted by papal favour or legally established Church custom to certain presbyters (e.g., abbots).

==Other religions==

The word has been employed in English also for caliphs (Islam) and swamis and jagadgurus (Hinduism).

<doc id="185098" wikidata="Q1416406" url="?curid=185098" title="Network model">
<text>In computing, the network model is a database model conceived as a flexible way of representing objects and their relationships. Its distinguishing feature is that the schema, viewed as a graph in which object types are nodes and relationship types are arcs, is not restricted to being a hierarchy or lattice.

The network model was adopted by the CODASYL Data Base Task Group in 1969 and underwent a major update in 1971. It is sometimes known as the CODASYL model for this reason. A number of network database systems became popular on mainframe and minicomputers through the 1970s before being widely replaced by relational databases in the 1980s.

==Overview==
While the hierarchical database model structures data as a tree of records, with each record having one parent record and many children, the network model allows each record to have multiple parent and child records, forming a generalized graph structure. This property applies at two levels: the schema is a generalized graph of record types connected by relationship types (called &quot;set types&quot; in CODASYL), and the database itself is a generalized graph of record occurrences connected by relationships (CODASYL &quot;sets&quot;). Cycles are permitted at both levels.

The chief argument in favour of the network model, in comparison to the hierarchical model, was that it allowed a more natural modeling of relationships between entities. Although the model was widely implemented and used, it failed to become dominant for two main reasons. Firstly, IBM chose to stick to the hierarchical model with semi-network extensions in their established products such as IMS and DL/I. Secondly, it was eventually displaced by the relational model, which offered a higher-level, more declarative interface. Until the early 1980s the performance benefits of the low-level navigational interfaces offered by hierarchical and network databases were persuasive for many large-scale applications, but as hardware became faster, the extra productivity and flexibility of the relational model led to the gradual obsolescence of the network model in corporate enterprise usage.

==History==
The network model&#x27;s original inventor was Charles Bachman, and it was developed into a standard specification published in 1969 by the Conference on Data Systems Languages (CODASYL) Consortium. This was followed by a second publication in 1971, which became the basis for most implementations. Subsequent work continued into the early 1980s, culminating in an ISO specification, but this had little influence on products.

Bachman&#x27;s influence is recognized in the term Bachman diagram, a diagrammatic notation that represents a database schema expressed using the network model. In a Bachman diagram, named rectangles represent record types, and arrows represent one-to-many relationship types between records (CODASYL set types).

==Database systems==
Some well-known database systems that use the network model include:
*IMAGE for HP 3000
*Integrated Data Store (IDS)
*IDMS (Integrated Database Management System)
*Univac DMS-1100
*Norsk Data SIBAS
*Oracle CODASYL DBMS for OpenVMS (originally known as DEC VAX DBMS)

<doc id="185099" wikidata="Q7892634" url="?curid=185099" title="Physiographic regions of the United States">
<text>The physiographic regions of the contiguous United States comprise 8 divisions, 25 provinces, and 85 sections. The system dates to Nevin Fenneman&#x27;s report &quot;Physiographic Divisions of the United States&quot;, published in 1916. The map was updated and republished by the Association of American Geographers in 1928. The map was adopted by the United States Geological Survey by publication in 1946. 

The classification hierarchy used in the 1916 publication of the American Association of Geographers was division/province/section/subsection. The use of province in this hierarchy undoubtedly confounded the effort to develop a physiographical map consistent across the North American continent since Canada used province as the term for its first-level political subdivision. Province in Canada is a loose analogy for state in the US, and obviously would create great confusion if the same word was used in two vastly different geographical classifications. As late as 1914, the terminology used by an AAG publication used the term &quot;natural region&quot; as the basic denomination of physiography. That work showed 22 examples of how geographers had published works classifying North America into what had been defined as natural regions. Most included all of North America without regard to political subdivision. 

Fenneman expanded and presented a derivative of this system more fully in two books, &quot;Physiography of western United States&quot; (1931), and &quot;Physiography of eastern United States&quot; (1938).

<doc id="185105" wikidata="Q7598341" url="?curid=185105" title="Industry standard data model">
<text>An industry standard data model, or simply standard data model, is a data model that is widely used in a particular industry. The use of standard data models makes the exchange of information easier and faster because it allows heterogeneous organizations to share an agreed vocabulary, semantics, format, and quality standard for data. Organizations may save time and expense by using pre-existing data models instead of developing them in-house, although the process of making data conform to external models can also be a hindrance. 

Standards are often defined by standards bodies or technology companies. 

Most models use the relational model of database management, but some use the hierarchical model, especially those used in manufacturing or those mandated by governments, such as models specified by DIN codes in Germany.

==Applications==
Effective standard models have developed in the banking, insurance, pharmaceutical and automotive industries. These models reflect stringent standards required in these industries for customer information gathering, customer privacy, consumer safety, or just in time manufacturing.

The most complex data models known are in military use. Consortia such as NATO tend to require strict standards for their members&#x27; equipment and supply databases. While standards for commercial software are usually open to view and implement, military data standards are often private and internal.

==Issues==
Standard data models usually require the translation of existing company data to fit the model&#x27;s specification, which may cost more than is gained by the use of such a model. Inflexible models might not be able to capture all of the data of a given organization, or new types of data that arise as an organization or industry develops. If one organization needs to make changes to its software architecture that are not compatible with the current standard, it may cause data sharing issues.

== Examples ==

* ISO 10303 CAE Data Exchange Standard - includes its own data modelling language, EXPRESS
* ISO 15926 Process Plants including Oil and Gas facilities Life-Cycle data
* IDEAS Group Foundation Ontology agreed by defence departments of Australia, Canada, France, Sweden, UK and USA
* EN12896 CEN Reference Data Model For Public Transport. covering public transport scheduling, fare management, operations and passenger information 
* Seabed Survey Data Model (SSDM) is a standard data model used in the oil and gas industry, first introduced in 2011.

<doc id="185107" wikidata="Q154045" url="?curid=185107" title="Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia">
<text>Alexei Nikolaevich (; – 17 July 1918) was the last Russian tsesarevich (heir apparent). He was the youngest child and only son of Tsar Nicholas II and Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna. He was born with haemophilia, which his parents tried treating with the methods of peasant faith healer Grigori Rasputin.

After the February Revolution of 1917, the Romanovs were sent into internal exile in Tobolsk, Siberia. After the October Revolution, the family was initially to be tried in a court of law, before the intensification of the Russian Civil War made execution increasingly favorable in the eyes of the Soviet government. With White Army soldiers rapidly approaching, the Ural Regional Soviet ordered the murder of Alexei, the rest of his family, and four remaining retainers on 17 July 1918. Rumors persisted for decades that Alexei had escaped his execution, with multiple impostors claiming his identity. Alexei&#x27;s remains, along with those of his sister Maria (or Anastasia), were ultimately discovered in a secondary grave near the rest of the Romanov family in 2007. On 17 July 1998, the 80th anniversary of their execution, Alexei&#x27;s parents, three of his sisters, and the four retainers, were formally interred in the Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul, while Alexei&#x27;s and Maria&#x27;s (or Anastasia&#x27;s) bones remain in Russian state archives. The Romanov family was canonized as passion bearers by the Russian Orthodox Church in 2000.

Alexei is sometimes known to Russian legitimists as Alexei II after his ancestor Alexis of Russia, as until his death they do not recognize the abdication of his father in favor of his uncle Grand Duke Michael as lawful.

==Biography ==

=== Early years ===

Alexei was born on in Peterhof Palace, St. Petersburg Governorate, Russian Empire. He was the youngest of five children of Emperor Nicholas II and Empress Alexandra Feodorovna. His father was the eldest son of Emperor Alexander III and Princess Dagmar of Denmark, and his mother was the sixth child of Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse, and Princess Alice of the United Kingdom. His paternal great-grandparents were Alexander II of Russia, Princess Marie of Hesse, Christian IX of Denmark and Louise of Hesse-Kassel, while his maternal great-grandparents were Queen Victoria and her husband Albert, Prince Consort. His older sisters were the Grand Duchesses Olga, Tatiana, Maria and Anastasia.

Alexei&#x27;s birth was greeted with widespread joy, because he was the first son Nicholas had had after four daughters. When she woke up from the chloroform, Alexandra saw the happy faces around her and exclaimed, &quot;Oh, it cannot be true. It cannot be true. Is it really a boy?&quot; Nicholas wrote in his diary that today was &quot;a great and &quot;unforgettable day for us . . . there are no words to thank God enough for sending us this comfort in a time of sore trials.&quot; According to Grand Duke Constantine Constantinovich of Russia, Nicholas&#x27; younger brother Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich &quot;was radiant with happiness at no longer being heir.&quot; Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden remembered that &quot;we were nearly deafened by the church bells ringing all day&quot;. St. Petersburg &quot;was ablaze with flags&quot; and &quot;the people gave themselves over to public rejoicing.&quot; Nicholas granted political amnesty to prisoners and set up a fund for military and naval scholarships.

Nicholas named Alexei after Alexis of Russia, his favorite emperor. His doting family called him &quot;Baby.&quot; He was later also affectionately referred to as Alyosha (Алёша).

As soon as he was born, Alexei was granted the title of tsarevich and heir apparent to the Imperial Throne of Russia. An official announcement read, &quot;From now on, in accordance with the Fundamental Laws of the Empire, the Imperial title of Heir Tsarevich, and all the rights pertaining to it, belong to Our Son Alexei.&quot;.

Alexei was christened on 3 September 1904 in the chapel in Peterhof Palace. His principal godparents were his paternal grandmother and his great-uncle, Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich. His other godparents included his oldest sister, Olga; his great-grandfather King Christian IX of Denmark; King Edward VII of the United Kingdom, the Prince of Wales and Wilhelm II, German Emperor. As Russia was at war with Japan, all active soldiers and officers of the Russian Army and Navy were named honorary godfathers.

The christening marked the first time that some of the younger members of the Imperial Family, including some of the younger sons of Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich; the Grand Duchesses Olga and Tatiana; and their cousin Princess Irina Alexandrovna, attended an official ceremony. For the occasion, the boys wore miniature military uniforms, and the girls wore smaller versions of the court dress and little kokoshniks. The sermon was delivered by John of Kronstadt. The baby was carried to the font by the elderly Princess Maria Mikhailovna Galitzine, Mistress of the Robes. As a precaution, she had rubber soles put on her shoes to prevent her slipping and dropping him.

Countess Sophie Buxhoeveden recalled:
=== Hemophilia ===


Alexei inherited hemophilia from his mother Alexandra, an X chromosome hereditary condition that typically affects males, which she had acquired through the line of her maternal grandmother Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. It was known as the &quot;Royal Disease&quot; because so many descendants of the intermarried European royal families had it (or carried it, in the case of females). In 2009, genetic analysis determined that Alexei had hemophilia B.

At first, Alexei seemed like a healthy, ordinary baby. He weighed 11 pounds at birth. His paternal aunt Xenia wrote that &quot;he&#x27;s an amazingly hefty baby with a chest like a barrel and generally has the air of a warrior knight.&quot; After his umbilical cord was cut, his navel continued to bleed for hours and his blood did not clot. Nicholas wrote that Alexei lost &quot;1/8 to 1/9 of the total quantity&quot; of his blood in 48 hours. Nicholas reflected in his diary that &quot;Alix and I were very alarmed by the bleeding of young Alexei that came at intervals from his umbilical cord until evening. How painful it is to experience such anxieties!&quot;

Nicholas and Alexandra decided not to reveal what Alexei&#x27;s disease was to the Russian public or even to family members. After Alexei&#x27;s first bleeding attack, Alexandra wrote, &quot;Oh, what anguish it was... not to let others see the knife digging in one.&quot; According to his French tutor, Pierre Gilliard, the nature of his illness was kept a state secret.

There were rumors about what Alexei&#x27;s disease was, because of the secrecy around it. Guesses ranged from a &quot;certain form of infantile tuberculosis which gives rise to acute alarm&quot; to &quot;one of the layers of his skin was missing.&quot; An American magazine ascribed Alexei&#x27;s &quot;ill health&quot; to &quot;the misfortune that so many residences of the Tzars leave much to be desired from the point of view of sanitary science.&quot; After Alexei&#x27;s life-threatening hemorrhage at Spala, the American press speculated that Alexei had been stabbed &quot;during an unguarded moment&quot; by a &quot;nihilist.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; observed that the &quot;incomprehensible silence of the Court bulletins&quot; gave &quot;free scope to the sensation-mongers.&quot;

When he was 5, Alexei was assigned two navy sailors who monitored him at all times to ensure that he wouldn&#x27;t injure himself. His parents appointed two sailors from the Imperial Navy: Petty Officer Andrei Derevenko and his assistant Seaman Klementy Nagorny. Anna Vyrubova, Alexandra&#x27;s friend, remembered that &quot;Derevenko was so patient and resourceful, that he often did wonders in alleviating the pain. I can still hear the plaintive voice of Alexis begging the big sailor, &#x27;Lift my arm,&#x27; &#x27;Put up my leg,&#x27; &#x27;Warm my hands,&#x27; and I can see the patient, calm-eyed man working for hours to give comfort to the little pain-wracked limbs.&quot;

His hemophilia was so severe that trivial injuries such as a bruise, a nosebleed or a cut were potentially life-threatening. His parents constantly worried about him. In addition, the recurring episodes of illness and long recoveries interfered greatly with Alexei&#x27;s childhood and education.

Nicholas and Alexandra believed that Grigori Rasputin, a peasant monk, had the power to heal Alexei. Due to the secrecy around Alexei&#x27;s condition, there are few records about Alexei&#x27;s attacks and how often Rasputin treated him.

In the autumn of 1907, Alexei fell and hurt his leg when he was playing in the Alexander Park. The fall triggered an internal hemorrhage. His paternal aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia reflected that &quot;the poor child lay in such pain, dark patches under his eyes and his little body all distorted, and the leg terribly swollen.&quot; The doctors could do nothing. Alexandra telegraphed Princess Anastasia of Montenegro and asked her to find Rasputin. Rasputin prayed over Alexei and told Alexei &quot;Your pain is going away. You will soon be well. You must thank God for healing you. And now, go to sleep.&quot; Soon after Rasputin left, the swelling in Alexei&#x27;s leg went down. Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia was amazed by Alexei&#x27;s swift recovery, and she wrote that the next morning Alexei &quot;was not just alive – but well. He was sitting up in bed, the fever gone, the eyes clear and bright, not a sign of any swelling on his leg.&quot;

In September 1912, Alexei and his family visited their hunting retreat in the Białowieża Forest. On 5 September Alexei jumped into a rowboat and hit his groin on the oarlocks. A large bruise appeared within minutes but in a week reduced in size. In mid-September, the family moved to Spała (then in Russian Poland). On 2 October, Alexei accompanied his mother on a drive in the woods. The &quot;juddering of the carriage had caused still healing hematoma in his upper thigh to rupture and start bleeding again.&quot; He had to be carried out of the carriage in an almost unconscious state. His temperature rose, his heartbeat dropped, and he hemorrhaged in his upper thigh and abdomen. For 11 days, he screamed &quot;O Lord have mercy on me!&quot; and begged Alexandra, &quot;Mama, help me!&quot; He asked Alexandra to &quot;build me a little monument of stones in the woods&quot; and asked &quot;When I&#x27;m dead, it won&#x27;t hurt any more, will it?&quot; Alexandra never left his bedside, and she refused to rest or eat. Nicholas &quot;took turns with Alix to sit with Alexei,&quot; but he &quot;rushed weeping bitterly to his study&quot; when he saw Alexei scream. On 6 October, Alexei&#x27;s fever rose to 39 degrees and he hemorrhaged into his stomach. On 8 October, Alexei received the last sacrament. Alexei&#x27;s tutor, Pierre Gilliard, wrote to his children, &quot;Pray, my children, pray daily and fervently for our precious heir.&quot; On 10 October, a medical bulletin announcing Alexei&#x27;s impending death was published in the newspapers.

On 9 October, Alexandra asked her lady-in-waiting and best friend, Anna Vyrubova, to secure the help of Rasputin. According to his daughter, Rasputin received the telegram on 12 October. On 9 October, Alexandra received a short telegram from Rasputin: &quot;The little one will not die. Do not allow the doctors [c.q. Eugene Botkin and Vladimir Derevenko] to bother him too much.&quot; Alexei&#x27;s temperature dropped, and he began to improve. According to General Mosolov, the doctors &quot;seemed in utter consternation&quot; at Alexei&#x27;s sudden recovery. On 10 October, Doctor Eugene Botkin wrote to his children that &quot;our priceless patient&quot; was &quot;undoubtedly significantly better.&quot; The positive trend continued throughout the next day. On 19 October Alexei&#x27;s condition was much better and the hematoma disappeared. The boy had to undergo orthopedic therapy to straighten his left leg. Feodorov confirmed that Alexei&#x27;s recovery was &quot;wholly inexplicable, from a medical point of view.&quot;

According to Pierre Gilliard&#x27;s 1921 memoir,
Observers and scholars have offered suggestions for Rasputin&#x27;s apparent positive effect on Alexei: he used hypnotism, administered herbs to the boy, or his advice to prevent too much action by the doctors aided the boy&#x27;s healing. Others speculated that, with the information he got from his confidante at the court, lady-in-waiting Anna Vyrubova, Rasputin timed his &quot;interventions&quot; for times when Alexei was already recovering, and claimed all the credit. Court physician Botkin believed that Rasputin was a charlatan and that his apparent healing powers were based on the use of hypnosis but Rasputin did not become interested in this practice before 1913 and his teacher Gerasim Papandato was expelled from St. Petersburg. Felix Yusupov, one of Rasputin&#x27;s enemies, suggested that he secretly gave Alexei Tibetan herbs which he got from quack doctor Peter Badmayev, but these drugs were rejected by the court. Maria Rasputin believed her father exercised magnetism.

Writers from the 1920s had a variety of explanations for the apparent effects of Rasputin. Greg King thinks such explanations fail to take into account those times when Rasputin apparently healed the boy, despite being 2600 km (1650 miles) away. For historian Fuhrmann, these ideas on hypnosis and drugs flourished because the Imperial Family lived in such isolation from the wider world. (&quot;They lived almost as much apart from Russian society as if they were settlers in Canada.&quot;) Moynahan says, &quot;There is no evidence that Rasputin ever summoned up spirits, or felt the need to; he won his admirers through force of personality, not by tricks.&quot; Shelley said that the secret of Rasputin&#x27;s power lay in the sense of calm, gentle strength, and shining warmth of conviction. Radzinsky wrote in 2000 that Rasputin believed he truly possessed a supernatural healing ability or that his prayers to God saved the boy.

Gilliard, the French historian Hélène Carrère d&#x27;Encausse and Diarmuid Jeffreys, a journalist, speculated that Rasputin may have halted the administration of aspirin. This pain-relieving analgesic had been available since 1899 but would have worsened Alexei&#x27;s condition. Because aspirin is an antiaggregant and has blood-thinning properties; it prevents clotting, and promotes bleeding which could have caused the hemarthrosis. The &quot;anti-inflammatory drug&quot; would have worsened Alexei&#x27;s joints&#x27; swelling and pain. According to historian M. Nelipa, Robert K. Massie was correct to suggest that psychological factors play a part in the course of the disease.

=== Childhood ===


During World War I, he lived with his father at army headquarters in Mogilev for long stretches of time and observed military life. Alexei became one of the first Boy Scouts in Russia.

In December 1916, Major-General Sir John Hanbury-Williams, head of the British military at Stavka, received word of the death of his son in action with the British Expeditionary Force in France. Tsar Nicholas sent twelve-year-old Alexei to sit with the grieving father. &quot;Papa told me to come sit with you as he thought you might feel lonely tonight,&quot; Alexei told the general. Alexei, like all the Romanov men, grew up wearing sailor uniforms and playing at war from the time he was a toddler. His father began to prepare him for his future role as Tsar by inviting Alexei to sit in on long meetings with government ministers.

=== Stavka ===
During World War I, Alexei joined his father at Stavka, when his father became the Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Army in 1915. Alexei seemed to like military life very much and became very playful and energetic. In one of his father&#x27;s notes to his mother, he said &quot;[I] have come in from the garden with wet sleeves and boots as Alexei sprayed us at the fountain. It is his favorite game [...] peals of laughter ring out. I keep an eye, in order to see that things do not go too far.&quot; Alexei even ate the soldiers&#x27; black bread, and refused when he was offered a meal that he would eat in his palace, saying &quot;It&#x27;s not what soldiers eat&quot;. In December 1915, Rasputin was invited to see Alexei when the 11-year-old boy was accidentally thrown against the window of a train and his nose began to bleed.

In 1916, he was given the title of Lance Corporal, of which he was very proud. Alexei&#x27;s favorites were the foreigners of Belgium, Britain, France, Japan, Italy, and Serbia, and in favor, adopted him as their mascot. Hanbury-Williams, whom Alexei liked, wrote: &quot;As time went on and his shyness wore off he treated us like old friends and [...] had always some bit fun with us. With me it was to make sure that each button on my coat was properly fastened, a habit which naturally made me take great care to have one or two unbuttoned, in which case he used to at once to stop and tell me that I was &#x27;untidy again,&#x27; give a sigh at my lack of attention to these details and stop and carefully button me up again.&quot;

=== Imprisonment of the Imperial family ===
The imperial family was arrested following the February Revolution of 1917, which resulted in the abdication of Nicholas II. When he was in captivity at Tobolsk, Alexei complained in his diary that he was &quot;bored&quot; and begged God to have &quot;mercy&quot; on him. He was permitted to play occasionally with Kolya, the son of one of his doctors, and with a kitchen boy named Leonid Sednev. As he became older, Alexei seemed to tempt fate and injure himself on purpose. While in Siberia, he rode a sled down the stairs of the prison house and injured himself in the groin. The hemorrhage was very bad, and he was so ill that he could not be moved immediately when the Bolsheviks relocated his parents and older sister Maria to Yekaterinburg in April 1918. However, neither Nicholas II nor Empress Alexandra mention anything about a sledding accident in their diaries, and in fact primary resources such as letters of Empress Alexandra and the diaries of both Nicholas II and Alexandra state that the haemorrhage was caused by a coughing fit. On 30 March (12 April) 1918, Empress Alexandra recorded in her diary: &#x27;Baby stays in bed as fr[om] coughing so hard has a slight haemorrhage in the abdom[en]. Every day from then onwards until her removal to Yekaterinburg, Alexandra recorded Alexei&#x27;s condition in her diary. Alexei and his three remaining sisters joined the rest of the family weeks later. He was reliant on a wheelchair for the remaining weeks of his life.

=== Death ===

The Tsesarevich was murdered on 17 July 1918 aged 13 in the cellar room of the Ipatiev House in Yekaterinburg. The killings were carried out by forces of the Bolshevik secret police under Yakov Yurovsky. According to one account of the execution, the family was told to get up and get dressed in the middle of the night because they were going to be moved. Nicholas II carried Alexei to the cellar room. His mother asked for chairs to be brought so that she and Alexei could sit down. When the family and their servants were settled, Yurovsky announced that they were to be executed. The firing squad first killed Nicholas, the Tsarina, and the two male servants. Alexei remained sitting in the chair, &quot;terrified,&quot; before the assassins turned on him and shot at him repeatedly. The boy remained alive and the killers tried to stab him multiple times with bayonets. &quot;Nothing seemed to work,&quot; wrote Yurovsky later. &quot;Though injured, he continued to live.&quot; Unbeknownst to the killing squad, the Tsarevich&#x27;s torso was protected by a shirt wrapped in precious gems that he wore beneath his tunic. Finally Yurovsky fired two shots into the boy&#x27;s head, and he fell silent.

For decades (until all the bodies were found and identified, see below) conspiracy theorists suggested that one or more of the family somehow survived the slaughter. Several people claimed to be surviving members of the Romanov family following the assassinations. People who have pretended to be the Tsarevich include: Alexei Poutziato, Joseph Veres, Heino Tammet, Michael Goleniewski and Vassili Filatov. However, scientists considered it extremely unlikely that he escaped death, due to his lifelong hemophilia.

==Discovery and identification of remains==
On 23 August 2007, a Russian archaeologist announced the discovery of two burned, partial skeletons at a bonfire site near Yekaterinburg that appeared to match the site described in Yurovsky&#x27;s memoirs. The archaeologists said the bones are from a boy who was roughly between the ages of twelve and fifteen years at the time of his death and of a young woman who was roughly between the ages of fifteen and nineteen years old.
Anastasia was seventeen years, one month old at the time of the assassination, while Maria was nineteen years, one month old. Alexei was two weeks shy of his fourteenth birthday. Alexei&#x27;s elder sisters, Olga and Tatiana, were twenty-two and twenty-one years old, respectively, at the time of the assassination. Along with the remains of the two bodies, archaeologists found &quot;shards of a container of sulfuric acid, nails, metal strips from a wooden box, and bullets of various caliber.&quot; The bones were found using metal detectors and metal rods as probes. Also, striped material was found that appeared to have been from a blue-and-white striped cloth; Alexei commonly wore a blue-and-white striped undershirt.

On 30 April 2008, Russian forensic scientists announced that DNA testing had proven that the remains belong to the Tsarevich Alexei and the Grand Duchess Maria. DNA information, made public in July 2008, that was obtained from the Yekaterinburg site and repeated independent testing by laboratories such as the University of Massachusetts Medical School revealed that the final two missing Romanov remains were indeed authentic and that the entire Romanov family lived in the Ipatiev House. In March 2009, results of the DNA testing were published, confirming that the two bodies discovered in 2007 were those of Tsarevich Alexei and Grand Duchess Maria.

== Appearance and personality ==

Alexei was a handsome boy, and he bore a striking resemblance to his mother. His tutor Pierre Gilliard described the 18-month-old Alexei as &quot;one of the handsomest babies one could imagine, with his lovely fair curls and his great blue-grey eyes under their fringe of long curling lashes&quot;. A few years later, Gilliard described Alexei as tall for his age, with &quot;a long, finely chiseled face, delicate features, auburn hair with a coppery glint, and large grey-blue eyes like his mother&quot;. Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden, his mother&#x27;s lady-in-waiting, reflected that &quot;he was a pretty child, tall for his age, with regular features, splendid dark blue eyes with a spark of mischief in them, brown hair, and an upright figure&quot;.

Alexei was proud of and enjoyed his position as Tsarevich. Buxhoeveden reflected that &quot;he knew and felt that he was the Tsarevich, and from babyhood mechanically took his place in front of his elder sisters&quot;. He liked being kissed on the hand by the officers and &quot;didn&#x27;t miss his chance to boast about it and give himself airs in front of his sisters&quot;. He enjoyed jumping in front of the guards at the front of the Alexander Palace, who would immediately salute him as he walked past. Nicholas forbade the guards to salute Alexei unless another member of the family accompanied him. Alexei was embarrassed &quot;when the salute failed him&quot;, which &quot;marked his first taste of discipline&quot;. On one occasion, he ordered all of the Finnish officers on various ships to stand before him on the deck of the &quot;Standart&quot;. He began commanding them, but the Finnish officers did not understand Russian and stood in confusion until an aide informed them that Alexei wanted to hear them say, &quot;We wish you health, your Imperial Highness.&quot; When he was told that a group of officers had arrived to call on him, the 6-year-old Alexei told his sisters, &quot;Now girls, run away. I am busy. Someone has just called to see me on business.&quot; Also at 6, he walked into his father&#x27;s study and saw the Foreign Minister Alexander Izvolsky waiting to see Nicholas. Izvolsky remained sitting, and Alexei screamed, &quot;When the heir to the Russian Throne enters a room, people must get up!&quot;

Alexei&#x27;s parents indulged his tantrums and mischievous behavior, and they rarely punished him. In 1906, Alexei and his family went on a cruise to Finland. In the middle of the night, the 2-year-old Alexei commanded the ship&#x27;s band to wake up and play for him. Instead of punishing Alexei, Nicholas joked &quot;that&#x27;s the way to bring up an autocrat!&quot; Nicholas called Alexei &quot;Alexei the Terrible.&quot;

Alexei loved to attend army inspections with his father. When he was 3, he wore a miniature army uniform and played with a toy wooden rifle. From birth, he had the title of &quot;Hetman of all the Cossacks.&quot; He wore a miniature uniform of a sailor of the Russian navy, and he had his own Cossack uniform with a fur cap, boots, and dagger. He ended his daily prayers with &quot;Hurrah!&quot; instead of &quot;amen&quot;. When asked why, he replied that the soldiers on parade always said &quot;Hurrah!&quot; when his father finished speaking, so he should greet his Heavenly Father in the same way. Before he understood the nature of his disease, he said that he wanted to be a warrior-tsar and lead armies as his ancestors had.

Alexei resented that he was forbidden from doing what other boys could do because of his hemophilia. When his mother forbade him to ride a bike and play tennis, he asked angrily, &quot;Why can other boys have everything and I nothing?&quot; All four of his sisters were accomplished horsewomen, but he was forbidden from horseriding.

Alexei had few friends his age and was often lonely. Alexandra did not allow Alexei to play with his Romanov cousins because she was worried that they would knock him down when playing and he might bleed. Alexei&#x27;s companions were his sailor-nanny Derevenko&#x27;s two young sons. Derevenko watched them as they played, and he chastised his children if they played too roughly with Alexei.

Alexei was close with his sisters. Gilliard wrote that they &quot;brought into his life an element of youthful merriment that otherwise would have been sorely missed&quot;.

Despite the hemophilia, Alexei was adventurous and restless. Doctor Eugene Botkin&#x27;s children noticed Alexei&#x27;s inability to &quot;stay in any place or at any game for any length of time&quot;. When he was 7, he stole a bicycle and rode it around the palace. Shocked, Nicholas ordered every guard to pursue and capture Alexei. At a children&#x27;s party, Alexei began jumping from table to table. When Derevenko tried to stop him, Alexei shouted, &quot;All grown-ups have to go!&quot; Recognizing Alexei&#x27;s energetic nature, Nicholas ordered that Alexei be allowed &quot;to do everything that other children of his age were wont to do, and not to restrain him unless it was absolutely necessary&quot;.

Alexei was disobedient and difficult to control. Olga could not manage Alexei&#x27;s &quot;peevish temper&quot;. The only person he obeyed was his father. Sydney Gibbes noted that &quot;one word [from Nicholas] was always enough to exact implicit obedience from [Alexei]&quot;. Buxhoeveden remembered that Alexei had once thrown her parasol in the river, and Nicholas had chastised Alexei: &quot;That is not the way for a gentleman to behave to a lady. I am ashamed of you, Alexei.&quot; After his father scolded him, Alexei was &quot;scarlet in the face&quot; and apologized to Sophie.

As a small child, Alexei occasionally played pranks on guests. At a formal dinner party, Alexei removed the shoe of a female guest from under the table, and showed it to his father. Nicholas sternly told the boy to return the &quot;trophy&quot;, which Alexei did after placing a large ripe strawberry into the toe of the shoe.

As he grew up, Alexei became more thoughtful and considerate. When he was 9, he sent a collection of his favorite jingles to Gleb Botkin, Eugene Botkin&#x27;s son. He asked Gleb, who was talented at drawing, to illustrate the jingles. He attached a note: &quot;To illustrate and write the jingles under the drawings. Alexei.&quot; Before handing the note to Eugene Botkin, he crossed out his signature and explained, &quot;If I send that paper to Gleb with my signature on it, then it would be an order which Gleb would have to obey. But I mean it only as a request and he doesn&#x27;t have to do it if he doesn&#x27;t want to.&quot;

Alexei enjoyed playing the balalaika.

Alexei&#x27;s favorite pet was a spaniel named Joy. Nicholas gave Alexei an old performing donkey named Vanka. Alexei gave sugar cubes to Vanka, and Vanka pulled Alexei around the park in a sled during the winter.

According to Gilliard, Alexei was a simple, affectionate child, but the court spoiled him by the &quot;servile flattery&quot; of the servants and &quot;silly adulations&quot; of the people around him. Once, a deputation of peasants came to bring presents to Alexei. Derevenko required that they kneel before Alexei. Gilliard remarked that the Tsarevich was &quot;embarrassed and blushed violently&quot;, and when asked if he liked seeing people on their knees before him, he said, &quot;Oh no, but Derevenko says it must be so!&quot;. When Gilliard encouraged Alexei to &quot;stop Derevenko insisting on it&quot;, he said that he &quot;dare not&quot;. When Gilliard took the matter up with Derevenko, he said that Alexei was &quot;delighted to be freed from this irksome formality&quot;.

&quot;Alexei was the center of this united family, the focus of all its hopes and affections&quot;, wrote Gilliard. &quot;His sisters worshipped him. He was his parents&#x27; pride and joy. When he was well, the palace was transformed. Everyone and everything in it seemed bathed in sunshine.&quot;

Gilliard eventually convinced Alexei&#x27;s parents that granting the boy greater autonomy would help him develop better self-control. Alexei took advantage of his unaccustomed freedom, and began to outgrow some of his earlier foibles. Courtiers reported that his illness made him sensitive to the hurts of others.

Due to his disease, Alexei understood that he might not live to adulthood. When he was ten, his older sister Olga found him lying on his back looking at the clouds and asked him what he was doing. &quot;I like to think and wonder&quot;, Alexei replied. Olga asked him what he liked to think about. &quot;Oh, so many things&quot;, the boy responded. &quot;I enjoy the sun and the beauty of summer as long as I can. Who knows whether one of these days I shall not be prevented from doing it?&quot;

Nicholas&#x27; Colonel Mordinov remembered Alexei: 

==Sainthood==


The Romanov family had been canonized as holy martyrs in 1981 by the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad, which had developed among emigres after the Russian Revolution and the World Wars. After the decline of the Soviet Union, the government of Russia agreed with the Russian Orthodox Church to have the bodies of Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra, and three of their daughters (which were found at the execution site) interred at St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in St. Petersburg on 17 July 1998, eighty years after they were executed. In 2000, Alexei and his family were canonized as passion bearers by the Russian Orthodox Church.

As noted, the remains of Alexei and one of his sister’s bodies were found in 2008. As of 2015, Alexei&#x27;s remains had not yet been interred with the rest of his family, as the Russian Orthodox Church has requested more DNA testing to ensure that his identity was confirmed.

==Historical significance==

Alexei was the heir apparent to the Romanov Throne. Paul I had passed laws forbidding women to succeed to the throne (unless there were no legitimate male dynasts left, in which case, the throne would pass to the closest female relative of the last Tsar). He had established this rule in revenge for what he perceived to have been the illegal behavior of his mother, Catherine II (&quot;the Great&quot;), in deposing his father Peter III.

Nicholas II was forced to abdicate on . He did this in favour of his twelve-year-old son Alexei, who ascended the throne under a regency. Nicholas later decided to alter his original abdication. Whether that act had any legal validity is open to speculation. Nicholas consulted with doctors and others and realised that he would have to be separated from Alexei if he abdicated in favour of his son. Not wanting Alexei to be parted from the family in this crisis, Nicholas altered the abdication document in favour of his younger brother Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia. After receiving advice about whether his personal security could be guaranteed, Michael declined to accept the throne without the people&#x27;s approval through an election held by the proposed Constituent Assembly. No such referendum was ever held.
Grigori Rasputin rose in political power because the Tsarina believed that he could heal Alexei&#x27;s hemophilia, or his attacks. Rasputin advised the Tsar that the Great War would be won once he (Tsar Nicholas II) took command of the Russian Army. Following this advice was a serious mistake, as the Tsar had no military experience. The Tsarina, Alexandra, a deeply religious woman, came to rely upon Rasputin and believe in his ability to help Alexei where conventional doctors had failed. Historian Robert K. Massie explored this theme in his book, &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot;.

Massie contends that caring for Alexei seriously diverted the attention of his father, Nicholas II, and the rest of the Romanovs from the business of war and government.
Tsarevich Alexei Island (), later renamed Maly Taymyr, was named in honour of Alexei by the 1913 Arctic Ocean Hydrographic Expedition led by Boris Vilkitsky on behalf of the Russian Hydrographic Service.

Alexei&#x27;s diary, which was presumably kept by his tutors and relates his daily activities for January and February 1917, is written in both French and English and is preserved in the &quot;Grand Duchess Kseniia Aleksandrovna Papers&quot; collection in the Hoover Institution Archives (Stanford, California, USA).

<doc id="185109" wikidata="Q2117860" url="?curid=185109" title="James Bond Jr.">
<text>James Bond Jr. is an American animated television series based on Ian Fleming&#x27;s &quot;James Bond&quot; franchise. Produced by Mac B, Danjaq and Murakami-Wolf-Swenson in association with United Artists, it follows the adventures of James Bond&#x27;s nephew, James Bond Jr.

The series debuted on 16 September 1991 and ran 65 episodes before ending on 13 December of the same year. It was the first ever television series produced based on the Bond franchise, and, as of 2025, is the only animated adaptation to date.

== Background ==
This was the second attempt to create an animated series based on the Bond franchise. Bond screenwriter Kevin McClory announced in a February 1988 issue of &quot;Variety&quot; that he was working to produce an animated James Bond series called &quot;James Bond vs. S.P.E.C.T.R.E.&quot;, to be produced by an unnamed Dutch company. The series never came to fruition.

Eon Productions later began developing what would become &quot;James Bond Jr.&quot; The show was produced by Murakami-Wolf-Swenson and MGM Television, and debuted on 16 September 1991, with a total of 65 half-hour episodes produced.

&quot;James Bond Jr.&quot; was fully sanctioned by, and produced in association with, Danjaq and United Artists, who held the rights to the James Bond property. It was the first attempt to bring the Bond franchise to television since the 1954 live adaptation of &quot;Casino Royale&quot;. Only one season was produced.

== Plot ==

While attending prep school at Warfield Academy, James Bond Jr, with the help of his friends IQ (the grandson of Q), Gordo Leiter (the son of Felix Leiter) and Tracy Milbanks, fights against the evil terrorist organization S.C.U.M. (Saboteurs and Criminals United in Mayhem), a SPECTRE-like organization. Expanding on his uncle&#x27;s famous line, James Bond Jr&#x27;s catchphrase was &quot;Bond, James Bond... Junior.&quot;

The show regularly surpasses the Bond movies in terms of fantastical gadgets, while the violence of the Bond series is nowhere in evidence. 
Jaws, a recurring villain from the films &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; and &quot;Moonraker&quot;, made regular appearances, usually partnered with Nick Nack, a villain from &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;, the two forming a bickering comical duo. Auric Goldfinger also appears, alongside his assistant, Oddjob, from the &quot;Goldfinger&quot; film. It is revealed Goldfinger has a teenage daughter named Goldie Finger with equally expensive tastes. The only other villain from the films to appear in the show, though one that is very loosely based on his film counterpart, is Dr. No, who is depicted as being Asian and having green skin, a common practice at the time in children&#x27;s media whenever Asian villains are showcased such as Ming the Merciless in &quot;Defenders of the Earth&quot; and The Mandarin in the 90&#x27;s &quot;Iron Man&quot; TV series. Several episode titles parodied the titles of Bond films such as &quot;Live and Let’s Dance&quot; and &quot;Rubies Aren&#x27;t Forever&quot;.

== Characters ==
The main characters consist of James Bond Jr., his friends, several featured members of the Warfield Academy staff, and Trevor Noseworthy IV. They appear in almost every episode of the series. Sometimes only two or three of Jr.&#x27;s friends will accompany him on an adventure, leaving the others behind at Warfield to create a B-plot. These plots normally revolve around Trevor&#x27;s misguided attempts to get James into trouble.

=== Main characters ===
* James Bond Jr. (voiced by Corey Burton) — The thrill-seeking teenage nephew of MI6 agent James Bond 007, who shares his uncle&#x27;s penchant for quips and puns. He attends Warfield Academy with friends who aid him in his missions. Romance is occasionally hinted at between Bond and Tracy Milbanks.
* Horace &#x27;I.Q.&#x27; Boothroyd III (voiced by Jeff Bennett) — The grandson of Q (007&#x27;s gadget inventor), he is a scientific genius and one of James&#x27; best friends. Quick-witted and highly logical, he is responsible for developing and building the gadgets that help James defeat agents of S.C.U.M. He is mistakenly called &quot;Ike&quot; in the Italian dub of the series.
* Tracy Milbanks (voiced by Mona Marshall)  — The daughter of Bradford Milbanks and one of James&#x27; closest friends, regularly accompanying him on his missions. Bossy and quick-tempered, Tracy sometimes betrays her feelings for James. Her first name is a reference to 007&#x27;s late wife, Tracy Bond.
* Gordon &quot;Gordo&quot; Leiter (voiced by Jan Rabson) — The tanned, blonde, athletic &quot;strong fist&quot; among James&#x27; friends, Californian Gordo is also kindly and amiable. The son of 007&#x27;s CIA associate and friend Felix Leiter, he never backs down when his comrades need force to solve their problems.
* Phoebe Farragut (voiced by Susan Silo) — Tracy&#x27;s best friend and the daughter of a rich businessman. She makes no secret of her crush on James, although the feelings are never reciprocated, paralleling Bond&#x27;s relationship with Miss Moneypenny in the films.
* Trevor Noseworthy IV (voiced by Simon Templeman) — He comes from a wealthy family, and has an inflated sense of superiority and self-importance. Arrogant, egocentric and spiteful, as well as cowardly and fearful, he constantly plans to get James into trouble, hoping for him to be expelled from Warfield, which inevitably backfires.
* Bradford Milbanks (voiced by Julian Holloway) — An ex-RAF officer and Tracy&#x27;s father, who now presides over Warfield Academy as the headmaster. Although serious and rigid, he is a fair and accommodating disciplinarian and parent.
* Burton &quot;Buddy&quot; Mitchell (voiced by Brian Stokes Mitchell) — A former FBI agent and associate of 007, now working as Warfield&#x27;s gym teacher. Strong and intelligent, he serves as James&#x27;s mentor. Burton knows more about James&#x27;s adventures than he lets on to the rest of the school&#x27;s staff, frequently risking his own job by allowing the youngster and his friends to get into danger.

=== Villains ===
There were numerous villains in the series, most of whom worked for S.C.U.M. and made recurring appearances throughout the 65-episode run. Many characters looked nothing like their movie counterparts. All recurring villains in the show are listed here:

* S.C.U.M. – Short for Saboteurs and Criminals United in Mayhem, S.C.U.M. is the evil organization that is the main antagonist of the series.
** Scumlord (voiced by Jeff Bennett) — The mysterious leader of S.C.U.M., never seen outside the shadows. Believed by some to be none other than Ernst Stavro Blofeld. He often relays commands to other S.C.U.M. villains via telescreen. Scumlord has a dog named Scuzzball. Key appearances include &quot;The Beginning&quot;, &quot;Location: Danger&quot;, &quot;Avalanche Run&quot;, &quot;Barbella&#x27;s Big Attraction&quot; and &quot;The Thing in the Ice&quot;, although he made many cameo appearances. Scumlord is never seen outside of his surveillance room. He is always sitting in the dark wearing a trench coat, a fedora hat and sunglasses.
** Jaws (voiced by Jan Rabson) — A dim-witted villain whose trademark steel teeth destroy almost anything he chews. His clothing not only serves as a small source of comedy for the series but also complements his lack of intelligence. He usually acts as a henchman for higher-ranking S.C.U.M. agents and is often paired with Nick Nack. Unlike his movie counterpart, his lower jaw is also metallic, and he is able to talk clearly. In the novelization &quot;A View to a Thrill&quot;, it is explained that he was shot in the mouth during a bank robbery and &quot;to save his life, the doctors had given him a set of metal teeth, and motors for jaw muscles&quot;. Appearances include &quot;The Beginning&quot;, &quot;Plunder Down Under&quot;, &quot;Valley of the Hungry Dunes&quot;, &quot;Never Give a Villain a Fair Shake&quot;, &quot;No Such Loch&quot;, &quot;The Inhuman Race&quot;, &quot;Fountain of Terror&quot;, &quot;Ship of Terror&quot;, &quot;Queen&#x27;s Ransom&quot;, &quot;Avalanche Run&quot;, &quot;Barbella&#x27;s Big Attraction&quot;, &quot;Invaders from S.C.U.M.&quot;, &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot;, &quot;Catching the Wave&quot;, &quot;Between a Rock and a Hard Place&quot;, &quot;Sherlock IQ&quot;, &quot;Quantum Diamonds&quot;, &quot;Rubies Aren&#x27;t Forever&quot;, &quot;The Thing in the Ice&quot;, &quot;Monument to S.C.U.M.&quot; and &quot;Northern Lights&quot;.
** Nick Nack (voiced by Jeff Bennett) — A small henchman with a huge chin, Nick Nack is often the butt of &quot;short jokes&quot; from both James Bond Jr. and his villainous &quot;other half&quot;, Jaws. Appearances include &quot;Valley of the Hungry Dunes&quot;, &quot;Cruise to Oblivion&quot;, &quot;The Inhuman Race&quot;, &quot;Queen&#x27;s Ransom&quot;, &quot;Avalanche Run&quot;, &quot;Barbella&#x27;s Big Attraction&quot;, &quot;Invaders from S.C.U.M.&quot;, &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot;, &quot;Catching the Wave&quot;, &quot;Sherlock IQ&quot;, &quot;The Thing in the Ice&quot;, &quot;Goldie Finger at the End of the Rainbow&quot;, &quot;Monument to S.C.U.M.&quot; and &quot;Northern Lights&quot;.
** Dr. Derange (voiced by Julian Holloway) — This mad scientist with long black hair speaks with a French accent and has an insane passion for all kinds of radioactive materials, mainly plutonium. According to the novelization &quot;The Eiffel Target&quot;, Derange is part man and part machine making him a cyborg. He is by far the most frequently appearing villain in the series, appearing in at least sixteen episodes. He is also featured in most of the spin-off material. Appearances include &quot;The Eiffel Missile&quot;, &quot;A Race Against Disaster&quot;, &quot;The Inhuman Race&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s All in the Timing&quot;, &quot;Fountain of Terror&quot;, &quot;Deadly Recall&quot;, &quot;Red Star One&quot;, &quot;Invaders from S.C.U.M.&quot;, &quot;A Deranged Mind&quot;, &quot;The Last of the Tooboos&quot;, &quot;The Emerald Key&quot;, &quot;Canine Caper&quot;, &quot;Weather or Not&quot;, &quot;Between a Rock and a Hard Place&quot;, &quot;Quantum Diamonds&quot; and &quot;Monument to S.C.U.M&quot;.
*** Skullcap (voiced by Jan Rabson) — A top-ranking S.C.U.M. assassin who is almost always found working for Dr. Derange. His name is derived from the steel headgear encasing the top part of his head. Skullcap is extremely cold and insidious though not particularly cunning. According to the novelization &quot;The Eiffel Target&quot;, he is Number 17 on Interpol&#x27;s Most Wanted list and it was Dr. Derange who crafted his metallic dome after being seriously injured in a robbery. The dome also conducts static electricity. Whenever Skullcap scratches his head, it triggers little sparks. Appearances include &quot;The Eiffel Missile&quot;, &quot;The Inhuman Race&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s All in the Timing&quot;, &quot;The Last of the Tooboos&quot;, &quot;The Emerald Key&quot;, &quot;Weather or Not&quot;, &quot;Canine Caper&quot; and &quot;Thor&#x27;s Thunder&quot;.
** Auric Goldfinger (voiced by Jan Rabson) — One of 007&#x27;s cleverest and most manipulative villains. Whenever there is gold, there is Goldfinger. His schemes are motivated entirely by greed, and he is most often assisted by henchman Odd Job. He was arguably the SCUM villain who was the least altered from his movie counterpart. Appearances include &quot;Earth Cracker&quot;, &quot;Cruise to Oblivion&quot;, &quot;Goldie&#x27;s Gold Scam&quot; and &quot;Killer Asteroid&quot;.
*** Goldie Finger (voiced by Kath Soucie) — Goldfinger&#x27;s spoiled and equally crooked daughter, who shares her father&#x27;s love of gold and his ruthlessness. She often teamed up with Barbella, although she would sometimes aid her father. Appearances include &quot;City of Gold,&quot; &quot;Going for the Gold,&quot; &quot;Goldie&#x27;s Gold Scam&quot; and &quot;Goldie Finger at the End of the Rainbow&quot;.
** Oddjob (voiced by Jeff Bennett) — Much like Jaws and Nick Nack, he is seen working for the other villains, especially Goldfinger. He wears an odd-looking purple jumpsuit with red-orange stripes, red and white sneakers, pale green half gloves, a gold necklace bearing the initials OJ, a pale green winter scarf and flying goggles. His trademark razor-sharp hat is also present, although now it is a miniature top hat instead of a bowler hat. Appearances include &quot;Earth Cracker&quot;, &quot;Cruise to Oblivion&quot;, &quot;Far Out West&quot;, &quot;A Deranged Mind&quot;, &quot;Goldie&#x27;s Gold Scam&quot;, &quot;Between a Rock and a Hard Place&quot;, &quot;Killer Asteroid&quot; and &quot;Garden of Evil&quot;.
** Barbella (voiced by Mona Marshall) — A hot-tempered female bodybuilder, Barbella often exhibits superhuman strength. Cunning and cold, she has loyalty for no-one, least of all S.C.U.M., whom she betrays in one episode by attempting to destroy their international headquarters. Barbella often works with Goldie Finger. Appearances include &quot;City of Gold,&quot; &quot;Barbella&#x27;s Big Attraction,&quot; &quot;Going for the Gold&quot;, &quot;A Deranged Mind&quot; and &quot;Goldie Finger at the End of the Rainbow&quot;.
** Dr. No (voiced by Julian Holloway) — One of 007&#x27;s most fiendish opponents. The animated version differs a lot from the film &quot;Dr. No&quot;, as he has green skin, likely as a result of his defeat at the hands of 007 in the original movie. His accent, costume and mustache have Asiatic themes and many of his schemes involve ninjas, samurai swords, and the like. Appearances include &quot;A Chilling Affair&quot;, &quot;Valley of the Hungry Dunes&quot;, &quot;Appointment in Macau&quot;, &quot;The Sword of Power&quot;, &quot;Far Out West&quot;, &quot;Garden of Evil&quot; and &quot;No Time to Lose&quot;.
** Spoiler (voiced by Michael Gough) — A gravel-voiced S.C.U.M. agent who leads a savage, chain-wielding biker gang. He has worked for various agents including Baron von Skarin, Dr. Derange, and Dr. No. Appearances include &quot;Scottish Mist,&quot; &quot;No Time to Lose&quot; and &quot;Monument to S.C.U.M.&quot;
** Baron Von Skarin (voiced by Julian Holloway) — This wealthy Bavarian baron is also an international terrorist and firearms smuggler. Von Skarin is cold and cruel but never neglects his elegant appearance. He is often seen reporting directly to Scumlord and is apparently one of his more favored agents. Appearances include &quot;Live and Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;, &quot;Dance of the Toreadors&quot;, &quot;Scottish Mist&quot;, &quot;Catching the Wave&quot;, &quot;Sherlock IQ&quot;, &quot;Rubies Aren&#x27;t Forever&quot; and &quot;Northern Lights&quot;.
** Walker D. Plank (voiced by Ed Gilbert) — A pirate with a hook hand, eye-patch, a peg leg, and a talking parrot that also has an eye-patch and a peg-leg. His schemes are invariably nautical and involve pillage, plunder, and domination of all the oceans in the world. He seemed to be inspired by Karl Stromberg; with one episode showing his plot foiled in a manner akin to &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;. Appearances include &quot;Plunder Down Under&quot;, &quot;Nothing to Play With&quot;, &quot;Never Give a Villain a Fair Shake&quot;, &quot;No Such Loch&quot;, &quot;Ship of Terror&quot;, &quot;Queen&#x27;s Ransom&quot;, &quot;S.C.U.M. on the Water&quot;, &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot;, &quot;Danger Train&quot; and &quot;Thor&#x27;s Thunder&quot;.
*** Bilge and Pump — A pair of sinister seafaring sidekicks, often found instigating criminality on behalf of Captain Plank. Appearances include &quot;No Such Loch&quot; and &quot;S.C.U.M. on the Water&quot;.
** Ms. Fortune (voiced by Susan Silo) — A wealthy criminal aristocrat, Ms. Fortune&#x27;s wealth never prevents her from attempting to acquire more, through highly illegitimate means. She was an original villainess for the series, though her conspiracies to gain financial domination suggest she was a feminine version of Goldfinger. Appearances include &quot;Fountain of Terror&quot;, &quot;Mindfield&quot;, &quot;The Heartbreak Caper&quot;, &quot;There But For Ms. Fortune&quot; and &quot;Danger Train&quot;.
*** Snuffer (voiced by Jan Rabson) — Ms. Fortune&#x27;s crooked and deeply unpleasant butler and accomplice. He ends every sentence with &#x27;ma&#x27;am&#x27;, unless he is ordered by Ms. Fortune to wait on her male SCUM allies, in which case he will end a sentence with &quot;sir&quot;. Appearances include &quot;Fountain of Terror&quot;, &quot;Mindfield&quot;, &quot;The Heartbreak Caper&quot;, &quot;There But For Ms. Fortune&quot; and &quot;Danger Train&quot;.
** The Chameleon (voiced by Alan Oppenheimer) — This dangerous criminal is a facial shapeshifter due to nano-technologic mechanisms implanted under the skin on his face. Cunning and sly, he is a villain to be feared. Appearances include &quot;The Chameleon,&quot; &quot;Red Star One&quot; and &quot;The Art of Evil&quot;.
** Tiara Hotstones (voiced by Mona Marshall) — This jewel-loving mercenary shares a rapport with James Bond Jr. Despite being ruthless, she is inclined to pursue only jewels and money rather than power or world domination. Appearances include &quot;Dance of the Toreadors&quot;, &quot;Rubies Aren&#x27;t Forever&quot; and &quot;Dutch Treat&quot;.
** Maximillion Cortex — A diminutive villain with a very large brain. Cortex is very wealthy but is always looking for ways to increase that wealth. Appearances include &quot;Lamp of Darkness&quot; and &quot;Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s Vault&quot;.
*** Leftbrain and Rightbrain  — Cortex&#x27;s assistants, they are a pair of overweight halfwits whose size and intelligence counter those of their boss. While similar in appearance and completely inseparable, they are not related. Appearances include &quot;Lamp of Darkness&quot; and &quot;Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s Vault&quot;.
* The Worm (voiced by Jan Rabson) — The only recurring villain in the series not to be associated with S.C.U.M., The Worm is a first-rate terrorist and hypochondriac with an intense dislike of sunlight, making most of his plans taking place deep underground. Appearances include &quot;A Worm in the Apple&quot; and &quot;Pompeii and Circumstance&quot;.

=== Bond girls ===
In most episodes James Bond Jr. encounters guest women, whom he is often forced to rescue. Following in the 007 tradition, many of their names are based on puns or double entendres, although they are less salacious than the parent series. Some of the more notable include:

* Lotta Dinaro — Daughter of an archaeologist in search of El Dorado. They are both kidnapped by Oddjob and Goldfinger in the episode &quot;Earthcracker&quot;.
* Lt. Shelley Kaysing — A US Army lieutenant whom the Chameleon attempts to assassinate to further his plan to steal a secret army device in the episode &quot;The Chameleon&quot;.

* Terri Firma — The daughter of a leading seismologist, she is forced to work for Walker D. Plank and Jaws when her father is kidnapped in the episode &quot;Never Give a Villain a Fair Shake&quot;.

* Wendy Day — A weather forecaster who assists James in preventing Doctor Derange from carrying out his plot to take control of the weather in the episode &quot;Weather or Not&quot;.
* Sgt. Victoria Province — A mountie whom James befriends in Toronto. She assists him in foiling Baron von Skarin&#x27;s plan to cut electrical power to the city in the episode &quot;Northern Lights&quot;.
* Princess Yasmine (voiced by Sheryl Bernstein) — Daughter of the sheikh of Al-Khaline who is taken captive by Dr. No along with her father&#x27;s water for ransom.

<text>The mistle thrush (Turdus viscivorus) is a bird common to much of Europe, temperate Asia and North Africa. It is a year-round resident in a large part of its range, but northern and eastern populations migrate south for the winter, often in small flocks. It is a large thrush with pale grey-brown upper parts, a greyish-white chin and throat, and black spots on its pale yellow and off-white under parts. The sexes are similar in plumage, and its three subspecies show only minimal differences. The male has a loud, far-carrying song which is delivered even in wet and windy weather, earning the bird the old name of stormcock. Historically, the name was also sometimes spelled &quot;missel thrush&quot;.

Found in open woods, parks, hedges and cultivated land, the mistle thrush feeds on a wide variety of invertebrates, seeds and berries. Its preferred fruit include those of mistletoe, holly, rowan, and yew. Mistletoe is favoured where it is available, and this is reflected in the thrush&#x27;s English and scientific names; the plant, a parasitic species, benefits from its seeds being excreted by the thrush onto branches where they can germinate. In winter, a mistle thrush will vigorously defend mistletoe clumps or other fruit-bearing trees as a food reserve for when times are hard, chasing off other thrushes and other fruit-eating birds like waxwings.

The open cup nest is built against a trunk or in a forked branch, and is fearlessly defended against potential predators, sometimes including humans or cats. The clutch, typically of three to five eggs, is incubated for 12–15 days, mainly by the female. The chicks fledge about 14–16 days after hatching. There are normally two broods. There was a range expansion in the 18th and early 19th centuries, and a small decline in recent decades, perhaps due to changes in agricultural practices. Given its numbers and large range, this thrush is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern.
==Taxonomy==
The mistle thrush was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under its current scientific name. &quot;Turdus&quot; is the Latin for &quot;thrush&quot;, and &quot;viscivorus&quot;, &quot;mistletoe eater&quot;, comes from &quot;viscum&quot; &quot;mistletoe&quot; and &quot;vorare&quot;, &quot;to devour&quot;. The bird&#x27;s liking for mistletoe berries is also indicated by its English name, &quot;mistle&quot; being an old name for the plant.

There are more than 60 species of medium to large thrushes in the genus &quot;Turdus&quot;, characterised by rounded heads, longish pointed wings, and usually melodious songs. A mitochondrial DNA study identified the mistle thrush&#x27;s closest relatives as the similarly plumaged song and Chinese thrushes; these three species are early offshoots from the Eurasian lineage of &quot;Turdus&quot; thrushes after they spread north from Africa. They are less closely related to other European thrush species such as the blackbird (&quot;T. merula&quot;) which are descended from ancestors that had colonised the Canary Islands from Africa and subsequently reached Europe from there.

At least eight subspecies have been proposed, but the differences between them are mainly clinal, with birds being paler and less densely spotted in the east of the range. The accepted subspecies as of 2024 are:
* &quot;T. v. viscivorus&quot;, named by Linnaeus, 1758, the nominate subspecies. Europe, and western Asia east western Siberia and southeast to northern Iran.
* &quot;T. v. bonapartei&quot;, Cabanis, 1860. Central Asia, south to northern Pakistan, northwestern India, and western Nepal.
* &quot;T. v. deichleri&quot;, Erlanger, 1897. Northwest Africa, Corsica, Sardinia.
There is some dispute as to the boundary between &quot;T. v. viscivorus&quot; and &quot;T. v. bonapartei&quot;; some cite birds from Siberia east of the Ob as being in &quot;T. v. bonapartei&quot;, while others restrict &quot;T. v. bonapartei&quot; to the populations further south in the mountains of central Asia, with the entire Siberian population in &quot;T. v. viscivorus&quot;. An isolated population in Crimea has sometimes been separated as &quot;T. v. tauricus&quot;, but this is not considered to be a valid form. Mistle thrush fossils have been found in Pleistocene deposits from Poland and Sicily.

==Description==

The mistle thrush is the largest thrush native to Europe. The nominate subspecies measures in length, with a wingspan. It weighs , with an average of around . It has a stocky upright posture when on the ground. It has pale grey-brown upperparts, the chin and throat are greyish-white, and the yellowish-buff breast and off-white belly are marked with round black spots. The spotting becomes denser on the lower chest. The long tail has white tips on the outer feathers, and the underwing coverts are white. The eyes are dark brown and the bill is blackish with a yellowish base to the lower mandible. The legs and feet are yellowish-brown. There are no plumage differences between the sexes. Juveniles are similar to adults, but they have paler upperparts with creamy &#x27;teardrop&#x27; centres to many of the feathers and smaller spots on the yellowish underparts. By their first winter they are very similar to adults, but the underparts are usually more buff-toned.

There is clinal variation in nominate &quot;T. v. viscivorus&quot; across its range with the darkest birds in western Europe, and the palest in Siberia and Turkey. The southeastern subspecies &quot;T. v. bonapartei&quot; is in length, and therefore slightly larger than the nominate form. It is paler grey above and whiter below, with fewer black spots. The southwestern subspecies &quot;T. v. deichleri&quot; resembles &quot;T. v. bonapartei&quot; in appearance, but is closer in size to the nominate &quot;T. v. viscivorus&quot;, although it has a more slender bill.

Adults have a full moult after breeding, beginning between late May and the end of June, and completed by early October. Juvenile birds have a partial moult, replacing their head, body, and covert feathers; this is completed by October, although the start of the moult depends on when the chicks hatched.

The mistle thrush is much larger, paler and longer-tailed than the sympatric song thrush. In the western Himalayas it could be confused with both the plain-backed and the long-tailed thrushes. These are similar to the mistle thrush, but the plain–backed thrush lacks obvious wing bars, is more rufous above than its relative, and is barred rather than spotted below. The long-tailed thrush has olive-toned upperparts, bars on its breast and two wing bars. Juvenile mistle thrushes are superficially similar to White&#x27;s thrush, but that species has golden-yellow plumage, scalloped underparts and a distinctive underwing pattern.

===Voice===
The male mistle thrush has a loud melodious song with fluted whistles, sounding like &quot;chewee-trewuu ... trureetruuruu&quot; or similar, repeated three to six times, and used to advertise his territory, attract a mate and maintain the pair bond. The tone resembles that of the song thrush or blackbird, but compared to its relatives the mistle thrush&#x27;s repertoire is less varied and the delivery is slower. The song is, however, much louder, often audible up to 2 km (2,000 yd) away. The song is given from a treetop or other elevated position mainly from November to early June. The male is most vocal in the early morning, and its tendency to sing after, and sometimes during, wet and windy weather led to the old name &quot;stormcock&quot;. The song may be heard in any month, although it is uncommon from July to August while the thrush is moulting. The main call, given by both sexes, is a dry chattering &quot;krrrr&quot;, louder when it is alarmed or excited. It is often likened to the sound of a football rattle, a form of musical ratchet. There is also a squeaky &quot;tuk&quot; contact call.

==Distribution and habitat==

The mistle thrush breeds in much of Europe and temperate Asia, although it is absent from the treeless far north, and its range becomes discontinuous in southeast Europe, Turkey and the Middle East. In these warmer southern areas, it tends to be found in the milder uplands and coastal regions.

The mistle thrush is a partial migrant: birds from the north and east of the range wintering in the milder areas of Europe and North Africa. Scandinavian and Russian birds start moving south from mid-September onwards, most birds wintering in Europe, western Turkey and the Middle East. Between mid-October and November, large numbers cross the Strait of Gibraltar and others pass through Cyprus, but there is hardly any migration across the North Sea. Breeding birds in the British Isles and north-west Europe are resident or move only short distances. In the Himalayas, the breeding population moves to nearby lower-altitude sites in winter. Return migration starts mainly from late March, although it can be a month earlier in the Middle East, and northern breeders may not arrive back on their territories until late April or early May. Migration may be by day or night, and typically involves individuals or small groups. Vagrant birds have occurred in the Azores, China, Crete, Faroe Islands, Iceland, Japan, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Sikkim and the United Arab Emirates. In the winter 2017/2018 the first record of a mistle thrush in North America was at Miramichi in New Brunswick, found on 9 December 2017 and remaining until 24 March 2018.

The mistle thrush is found in a wide range of habitats containing trees, including forests, plantations, hedges and town parks. In the south and east of its range, it inhabits upland coniferous woodland and the range extends above the main tree line where dwarf juniper is present. Breeding occurs at up to in the mountains of North Africa, and occasionally much higher, to . In the highlands of Europe, its preferred altitude is from . More open habitats, such as agricultural land, moors and grassy hills, are extensively used in winter or on migration.

There is evidence that this species has changed its natural habitat in at least parts of its range. In Germany and elsewhere in central Europe, it was found only in coniferous forest until the mid-1920s when its range rapidly expanded, first into farmland, and then to suburbs and urban parks. The reasons for this expansion are unclear. In areas of intensive farming, such as eastern England, arable land has in turn largely been abandoned in favour of built-up areas with their greater variety of green habitats.

==Behaviour==
Mistle thrushes are found as individuals or pairs for much of the year, although families forage together in late summer, and groups may merge to form large flocks when food sources are plentiful. It is not uncommon for up to 50 thrushes to feed together at that time of year. They roost at night in trees or bushes, again typically as individuals or pairs, except in late summer or autumn when families may roost together.

The mistle thrush is quite terrestrial, hopping with its head held up and body erect; when excited, it will flick its wings and tail. The flight consists of undulating bounds interspersed with glides.

===Breeding===

Mistle thrushes breed in the year subsequent to their hatching; they are monogamous and stay as a pair throughout the year in areas where they are not migratory. Their territories are much larger than those of blackbirds or song thrushes; although the nest territory is only about , around is used for feeding. Territories are normally reoccupied in subsequent years. Territories are larger in woods than in farmland. The male will attack intruders into its breeding area, including birds of prey and corvids, and sometimes cats or humans. Courtship feeding of the female by her partner has sometimes been observed.
Breeding typically commences in mid-March in the south and west of Europe (late February in Britain), but not till early May in Finland. The nest is usually built in a tree in the fork of a branch or against the trunk, although hedges, ledges on buildings and cliff faces may also be used. The nest site may be up to above the ground, although is more typical. The common chaffinch often nests close to a mistle thrush, the vigilance of the chaffinch and the aggressive behaviour of the thrush benefiting both species. The thrush&#x27;s nest is a large cup of sticks, dry grass, roots and moss, coated on the inside with a layer of mud and lined with fine grass and leaves. The nest is built by the female, although the male may help. Nests built early in the breeding season may be destroyed by bad weather.

The clutch is typically three to five eggs (range two to six), which are usually whitish-buff or greenish-blue and are spotted with red, purple or brown. The average size of the egg is , and weighs , of which 6% is shell. The eggs are incubated for 12–15 days, mainly by the female. The chicks are altricial and downy, and are fed by both parents. They fledge about 14–16 days after hatching. There are normally two broods, except in Siberia, where there is only one, the male feeding the fledglings from the first brood while the female sits on the second clutch. Sometimes the same nest is reused for both broods. The young are dependent on their parents for 15–20 days after fledging.

In a study carried out in Britain, the survival rate for juveniles in their first year is 57 per cent, and the adult annual survival rate is 62 per cent. Life expectancy is typically three years, but the maximum age recorded from bird ringing recoveries is 21 years and 3 months for a bird shot in Switzerland.

===Feeding===
Mistle thrushes feed mainly on invertebrates, fruit and berries. Animal prey include earthworms, insects and other arthropods, slugs and snails. Snails are sometimes smashed on a stone &quot;anvil&quot;, a technique also used by the song thrush. The mistle thrush has been known to kill slowworms and the young of the song thrush, blackbird and dunnock.

Plant food includes the fruits and seeds of bushes and trees, mainly holly, yew, rowan, ivy and mistletoe, but also, for example, blackberry, cotoneaster, crab apple, cherry, elder, hawthorn, olive, sea-buckthorn, and rose. It may eat the flowers and shoots of grasses and other plants, and will take fallen apples and plums. It forages within its breeding habitat and in open fields, sometimes sharing these feeding areas with redwings, fieldfares, and ring ouzels.

Young birds are initially mainly fed on invertebrates, often collected from low foliage or under bushes rather than in the grassland preferred by the adults. Adults will roam up to 1 km (approximately 1,100 yards) from the nest on pasture or ploughed land. After fledging the young may accompany their parents until the onset of winter. Individuals or pairs will defend one or more fruit-bearing trees throughout the winter, with preference shown for trees which host mistletoe, the parasitic plant from which the bird derives its name. Where mistletoe is not present, holly is the most common tree chosen. Although the thrush normally feeds on the ground and from low bushes, the defence of this resource conserves fruit for later in the season when other food items become scarce. The trees are defended against other thrushes as well as birds such as the bullfinch and great spotted woodpecker. In milder winters with an abundance of fruit, however, this strategy is less used and thrushes can be observed foraging in flocks. Conversely, in hard winters, the defender may be overwhelmed by large flocks of fieldfares, redwings or Bohemian waxwings.

As its name implies, the mistle thrush is important in propagating the mistletoe, an aerial plant parasite, which needs its seeds to be deposited on the branches of suitable trees. The highly nutritious fruits are favoured by the thrush, which digests the flesh leaving the sticky seeds to be excreted, possibly in a suitable location for germination.

==Predators and parasites==

The mistle thrush is predated upon by a wide variety of birds of prey, including the boreal owl, short-eared owl, tawny owl, Ural owl, Eurasian eagle-owl, golden eagle, kestrel, common buzzard, red kite, northern goshawk, peregrine falcon, and sparrowhawk. The eggs and chicks may be targeted by cats and corvids. Parent birds exhibit fearlessness in defence of their nests, occasionally even attacking humans. The mistle thrush is not normally a host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite.

External parasites of the mistle thrush include the hen flea, the moorhen flea, the castor bean tick and the brightly coloured harvest mite. Internally, they can suffer from parasites including tapeworm, nematodes, and &quot;Syngamus merulae&quot; (a species of Gapeworm). Blood parasites can include &quot;Trypanosoma&quot; and &quot;Plasmodium&quot; species.

==Status==
The mistle thrush has an extensive distribution in Europe and western Asia, and its European breeding population is estimated at 9–22.2 million birds. When Asian breeders are added, this gives a global total of 12.2–44.4 million. The species was formerly more restricted in range, and rarely bred even in northern England in the 1700s. It expanded rapidly into lowland and coastal areas of Europe during the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century, colonising areas where it was formerly rare or absent, such as Ireland (where it first bred in 1807), Scotland and the Netherlands. The range also increased in Denmark, Norway, Hungary and Austria.

Although the population now appears to be declining, the decrease is not rapid or large enough to trigger international conservation vulnerability criteria. Given its high numbers and very large range, this thrush is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern. The perceived decline may be due to the loss of invertebrate-rich pastures and mixed farms through conversion to arable agriculture or more intensively managed grassland. Adult survival, clutch size and fledging success are all lower in arable landscapes than in areas with extensive pasture. In Finland, the loss of ancient forests is thought to have led to a local decline. In Britain, a substantial decline led to its being added to the UK Red List of Species of Conservation Concern in 2015, with agricultural intensification implicated; between 1967–2022, the breeding population declined by 62%.

==In culture==

Desiderius Erasmus&#x27;s early sixteenth-century collection of Latin proverbs included &quot;Turdus malum sibi ipse cacat&quot; (the thrush himself excretes his own trouble), which refers to the use of the sticky mistletoe berries favoured by this species as an ingredient in birdlime, used to trap birds. The thrush was seen to be thus spreading the seeds of his own destruction.

&quot;Mistle Thrush and Alpine Chough&quot;, by Giovanni da Udine, an artist who worked in Raphael&#x27;s studio in the 16th century, was a sketch for his &quot;Bird with Garland and Fruit&quot;, and this in turn was the basis for a Raphael fresco in the Apostolic Palace.

The early Renaissance poem &quot;The Harmony of Birds&quot; features a thrusshe (mistle thrush) singing the phrase &quot;sanctus, sanctus&quot;, distinguishing the bird from the song thrush, the &quot;mauys&quot; or &quot;throstle&quot;. The song of the mistle thrush is also described in Thomas Hardy&#x27;s &quot;Darkling Thrush&quot; and Edward Thomas&#x27;s &quot;The Thrush&quot;. The loud call of this common and conspicuous bird also led to many old or local names, including &quot;screech&quot;, &quot;shrite&quot; and &quot;gawthrush&quot;. Other names, including &quot;stormcock&quot; referred to its willingness to sing in wind and rain. &quot;Holm thrush&quot;, &quot;hollin cock&quot; and &quot;holm cock&quot; are based on obsolete names for the holly tree, which may be defended by the thrush in winter for its berries.

In Frances Hodgson Burnett&#x27;s 1911 novel &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;, Dickon reassures Mary Lennox that he will keep his knowledge of the garden secret by comparing her to a mistle thrush in defence of its nest, recognising his privilege in sharing her secret: &quot;If tha&#x27; was a missel thrush an&#x27; showed me where thy nest was, does tha&#x27; think I&#x27;d tell any one? Not me,&quot; he said. &quot;Tha&#x27; art as safe as a missel thrush.&quot;

Roy Harper&#x27;s 1971 album &quot;Stormcock&quot;, featuring Jimmy Page, is titled after the species.

The final verse of the Jethro Tull song &quot;Jack-in-the-Green&quot; from their 1977 album &quot;Songs from the Wood&quot; mentions the bird in the lines &quot;Oh, the mistlethrush is coming. Jack, put out the light.&quot; The bird also features in the lyrics of The Decemberists&#x27; song &quot;Won&#x27;t Want for Love (Margaret in the Taiga)&quot; from their 2009 album &quot;The Hazards of Love&quot;: &quot;Mistlethrush, Mistlethrush, Lay me down in the underbrush, My naked feet grow weary with the dusk&quot;.

<text>Chechen ( , ; , ,&lt;ref name=&quot;BGN/PCGN&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ) is a Northeast Caucasian language spoken by approximately 1.8 million people, mostly in the Chechen Republic and by members of the Chechen diaspora throughout Russia and the rest of Europe, Jordan, Austria, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Ukraine, Central Asia (mainly Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan) and Georgia.

== History ==
Before the Russian conquest, most writings in Chechnya consisted of Islamic texts and clan histories, written usually in Arabic but sometimes also in Chechen using Arabic script. The Chechen literary language was created after the October Revolution, and the Latin script began to be used instead of Arabic for Chechen writing in the mid-1920s. The Cyrillic script was adopted in 1938. Almost the entire library of Chechen medieval writing in Arabic and Georgian script about the land of Chechnya and its people was destroyed by Soviet authorities in 1944, leaving the modern Chechens and modern historians with a destroyed and no longer existent historical treasury of writings.

The Chechen diaspora in Jordan, Turkey, and Syria is fluent but generally not literate in Chechen except for individuals who have made efforts to learn the writing system. The Cyrillic alphabet is not generally known in these countries, and thus for Jordan and Syria, they most use the Arabic alphabet, while in Turkey they use the Latin alphabet.

==Classification==
Chechen is the most-spoken Northeast Caucasian language. Together with the closely related Ingush, with which there exists a large degree of mutual intelligibility and shared vocabulary, it forms the Vainakh branch.

== Dialects ==
There are a number of Chechen dialects: Aukh, Chebarloish, Malkhish, Nokhchmakhkakhoish, Orstkhoish, Sharoish, Shuotoish, Terloish, Itum-Qalish and Himoish.

Dialects of Chechen can be classified by their geographic position within the Chechen Republic. The dialects of the northern lowlands are often referred to as &quot;&quot; (literally &quot;lowlander&#x27;s language&quot;) and the dialect of the southern mountain tribes is known as &quot;&quot; (lit. &quot;mountainer&#x27;s language&quot;). forms the basis for much of the standard and literary Chechen language, which can largely be traced to the regional dialects of Urus-Martan and contemporary Grozny. Laamaroy dialects include Chebarloish, Sharoish, Itum-Qalish, Kisti, and Himoish. Until recently, however, Himoy was undocumented and was considered a branch of Sharoish, as many dialects are also used as the basis of intertribal (teip) communication within a larger Chechen &quot;&quot;. Laamaroy dialects such as Sharoish, Himoish and Chebarloish are more conservative and retain many features from Proto-Chechen. For instance, many of these dialects lack a number of vowels found in the standard language which were a result of long-distance assimilation between vowel sounds. Additionally, the Himoy dialect preserves word-final, post-tonic vowels as a schwa [ə].

Literary Chechen is based on Plains Chechen, spoken around Grozny and Urus-Martan.

==Geographic distribution==
According to the Russian Census of 2020, 1,490,000 people reported being able to speak Chechen in Russia.

===Official status===
Chechen is an official language of Chechnya.

===Jordan===

Chechens in Jordan have good relations with the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and are able to practice their own culture and language. Chechen language usage is strong among the Chechen community in Jordan. Jordanian Chechens are bilingual in both Chechen and Arabic, but do not speak Arabic among themselves, only speaking Chechen to other Chechens. Some Jordanians are literate in Chechen as well, having managed to read and write to people visiting Jordan from Chechnya.

==Phonology==
Some phonological characteristics of Chechen include its wealth of consonants and sounds similar to Arabic and the Salishan languages of North America, as well as a large vowel system resembling those of Swedish and German.

===Consonants===
The Chechen language has, like most indigenous languages of the Caucasus, a large number of consonants: about 40 to 60 (depending on the dialect and the analysis), far more than most European languages. Typical of the region, a four-way distinction between voiced, voiceless, ejective and geminate fortis stops is found. Furthermore, all variants except the ejective are subject to phonemic pharyngealization.

Nearly any consonant may be fortis because of focus gemination, but only the ones above are found in roots.
The consonants of the &quot;t&quot; cell and are denti-alveolar; the others of that column are alveolar. 
 is a back velar, but not quite uvular.
The lateral may be velarized, unless it is followed by a front vowel. 
The trill is usually articulated with a single contact, and therefore sometimes described as a tap .
Except in the literary register, and even then only for some speakers, the voiced affricates , have merged into the fricatives , . A voiceless labial fricative is found only in European loanwords.
 appears both in diphthongs and as a consonant; as a consonant, it has an allophone before front vowels.

Approximately twenty pharyngealized consonants (marked with superscript ) also appear in the table above. Labial, alveolar and postalveolar consonants may be pharyngealized, except for ejectives.

Except when following a consonant, is phonetically , and can be argued to be a glottal stop before a &quot;pharyngealized&quot; (actually epiglottalized) vowel. However, it does not have the distribution constraints characteristic of the anterior pharyngealized (epiglottalized) consonants. Although these may be analyzed as an consonant plus (they surface for example as [dʢ] when voiced and when voiceless), Nichols argues that given the severe constraints against consonant clusters in Chechen, it is more useful to analyze them as single consonants.

===Vowels===
Unlike most other languages of the Caucasus, Chechen has an extensive inventory of vowel sounds, putting its range higher than most languages of Europe (most vowels being the product of environmentally conditioned allophonic variation, which varies by both dialect and method of analysis). Many of the vowels are due to umlaut, which is highly productive in the standard dialect. None of the spelling systems used so far have distinguished the vowels with complete accuracy.

All vowels may be nasalized. Nasalization is imposed by the genitive, infinitive, and for some speakers the nominative case of adjectives. Nasalization is not strong, but it is audible even in final vowels, which are devoiced.

Some of the diphthongs have significant allophony: = ; = ; = .

In closed syllables, long vowels become short in most dialects (not Kisti), but are often still distinct from short vowels (shortened , , and vs. short , , , and , for example), although which ones remain distinct depends on the dialect.

 and are in complementary distribution ( occurs after pharyngealized consonants, whereas does not and —identical with for most speakers—occurs in closed syllables, while does not) but speakers strongly feel that they are distinct sounds.

Pharyngealization appears to be a feature of the consonants, though some analyses treat it as a feature of the vowels. However, Nichols argues that this does not capture the situation in Chechen well, whereas it is more clearly a feature of the vowel in Ingush: Chechen &quot;one&quot;, Ingush , which she analyzes as and . Vowels have a delayed murmured onset after pharyngealized voiced consonants and a noisy aspirated onset after pharyngealized voiceless consonants. The high vowels are diphthongized, , whereas the diphthongs undergo metathesis, .

===Phonotactics===
Chechen permits syllable-initial clusters and non-initially also allows plus any consonant, and any obstruent plus a uvular of the same manner of articulation. The only cluster of three consonants permitted is .

== Alphabets ==



Numerous inscriptions in the Georgian script are found in mountainous Chechnya, but they are not necessarily in Chechen. Later, the Arabic script was introduced for Chechen, along with Islam. The Chechen Arabic alphabet was first reformed during the reign of Imam Shamil, and then again in 1910, 1920 and 1922.

At the same time, the alphabet devised by Peter von Uslar, consisting of Cyrillic, Latin, and Georgian letters, was used for academic purposes. In 1911 it too was reformed but never gained popularity among the Chechens themselves.

===Cyrillic alphabet===
The current official script for Chechen language is the Cyrillic alphabet. This script was created and adopted in 1938, replacing the Latin script prior to it. Up until 1992, only the Cyrillic script was used for Chechen. After the collapse of the Soviet Union and the de facto secession of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria from Russia, a new Latin script was devised and was used parallel to Cyrillic until the dissolution of the separatist state.

Modern alphabet:

Lower-case palochka, , is found in handwriting. Usually, palochka uppercase and lowercase forms consistent in print or upright, but only upper-case is normally used in computers.

===1992 Latin alphabet===

In 1992, with the de facto secession of Chechen Republic of Ichkeria from Russia, a new Latin Chechen alphabet was introduced and used in parallel with the Cyrillic alphabet. This was the second time a Latin-based orthography was created for Chechen. But after the defeat of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria government by the Russian Armed Forces, the Cyrillic alphabet was restored.

===1925 Latin alphabet===

The first time that the Latin alphabet was introduced, was in 1925, replacing Arabic alphabet. Further minor modifications in 1934, unified Chechen orthography with Ingush. But the Latin alphabet was abolished in 1938, being replaced with Cyrillic.

===Arabic alphabet===

The first, most widespread modern orthography for Chechen was the Arabic script, adopted in the 19th century. Chechen was not a traditionally written language, but due to the public&#x27;s familiarity with the Arabic script - as the script of instruction in the region&#x27;s Islamic and Quranic schools - the Arabic alphabet was first standardized and adopted for Chechen during the reign of Imam Shamil. Islam has been the dominant religion in Chechnya since the 16th century, and there were 200 religious schools as well as more than 3000 pupils in Chechnya and Ingushetia. Thus the Arabic script was well established among the speakers of Chechen.

However, the Arabic alphabet, without modifications, would not be suitable for Chechen, and modifications would be needed. 
The Arabic alphabet underwent various iterations, improvements and modifications for the Chechen language. Within Chechen society, these modifications were not without controversy. The Muslim clergy and the more conservative segments of Chechen society initially resisted any changes to the Arabic script, with the belief that this script was sacred due to its association with Islam, and was not to be changed. The clergy and Islamic educational institutions opposed each and every iteration of proposed reforms in the Arabic script. While modifications to the Arabic script to match local languages had been common practice for centuries, for languages such as Persian and Ottoman Turkish, the modifications in Chechen were done independently from these two nearby and influential literary traditions and were focused on needs of Chechen language. Initially, the Chechen Arabic alphabet looked like this.

&lt;br&gt;ي ﻻ ه و ن م ل ڮ ك ڨ ق ف غ ع ظ ط ض ص ش س ز ر ذ د خ ح ج ث ت ب ا 

In this alphabet, two additional letters were added to the base Arabic script:
# The letter , equivalent to Cyrillic digraph &quot;Къ&quot; and representing the sound ;
# The letter equivalent to Cyrillic letter &quot;Кӏ&quot; and representing the sound .
#* This letter was later revised to 

In 1910, Sugaip Gaisunov proposed additional reforms that brought Arabic alphabet closer to Chechen&#x27;s phonetic requirements. Sugaip Gaisunov introduced four additional consonants:

# The letter , equivalent to Cyrillic letter &quot;Пӏ&quot; and representing the sound ;
#* This letter was later revised to 
# The letter () , equivalent to Cyrillic letters &quot;Ц&quot; and &quot;Цӏ&quot; and representing the sounds and ;
# The letter , equivalent to Cyrillic letters &quot;Ч&quot; and &quot;Чӏ&quot;, representing the sounds and ;
# The letter , equivalent to Cyrillic letter &quot;Г&quot; and representing the sound ;

In Sugaip Gaisunov&#x27;s reforms, the letters (&quot;ṣād/sād&quot;) and (&quot;zād/ḍād&quot;) had their usage limited to Arabic loanwords but were not eliminated due to opposition from Clergy and conservative segments of Chechen society. In another short-lasting modification, Sugaip Gaisunov proposed adding a overline (◌ٙ) (U+0659) over letters that can be read as either a consonant or a vowel, namely the letters (&quot;waw&quot;) (equivalent to Cyrillic letter &quot;В&quot; or to letters &quot;О, Оь, У, Уь&quot;) and (&quot;yāʼ&quot;) (equivalent to Cyrillic letter &quot;Й&quot; or to letter &quot;И&quot;). The overbar signified a vowel use when needed to avoid confusions. This modification did not persist in Chechen Alphabet. otherwise, the 1910 iteration of the Arabic script continued being used until 1920.

In 1920, two Chechen literaturists, A. Tugaev and T. Eldarkhanov, published a document. In this document they proposed new modifications, which were the addition of two new consonants:

# The letter , equivalent to Cyrillic letter &quot;Чӏ&quot; and representing the sound .
#* This letter was later revised to 
#* Thus the letter was reduced to only representing the sound , equivalent to Cyrillic letter &quot;Ч&quot;;
# The letter , equivalent to Cyrillic letter &quot;Цӏ&quot; and representing the sound ;
#* Thus the letter () was reduced to only representing the sound , equivalent to Cyrillic letter &quot;Ц&quot;;

These modifications by A. Tugaev and T. Eldarkhanov were a great final step in creating a modified Arabic script that represents Chechen consonants. However, the Arabic alphabet still was not suitable in representing Chechen vowel sounds. Arabic script itself is an impure abjad, meaning that most but not all vowels are shown with diacritics, which are in most cases left unwritten. The process of transforming Arabic script into a full alphabet for use by a non-Arabic language has been a common occurrence, and has been done in Uyghur, Kazakh, Kurdish and several more Arabic-derived scripts.

Thus a final revision on Chechen Arabic script occurred, in which vowel sounds were standardized.

Table below lists the 41 letters of the final iteration of Chechen Arabic Alphabet, as published by Chechen Authorities at the time, prior to 1925, their IPA values, and their Cyrillic equivalents.

===Comparison chart===

The single letters and digraphs that count as separate letters of the alphabet, along with their correspondences, are as follows. Those in parentheses are optional or only found in Russian words:
In addition, several sequences of letters for long vowels and consonants, while not counted as separate letters in their own right, are presented here to clarify their correspondences:

====Notes====
==Grammar==
Chechen is an agglutinative language with an ergative–absolutive morphosyntactic alignment. Chechen nouns belong to one of several genders or classes (6), each with a specific prefix with which the verb or an accompanying adjective agrees. The verb does not agree with person or number, having only tense forms and participles. Among these are an optative and an antipassive. Some verbs, however, do not take these prefixes.

Chechen is an ergative, dependent-marking language using eight cases (absolutive, genitive, dative, ergative, allative, instrumental, locative and comparative) and a large number of postpositions to indicate the role of nouns in sentences.

Word order is consistently left-branching (like in Japanese or Turkish), so that adjectives, demonstratives and relative clauses precede the nouns they modify. Complementizers and adverbial subordinators, as in other Northeast and in Northwest Caucasian languages, are affixes rather than independent words.

Chechen also presents interesting challenges for lexicography, as creating new words in the language relies on fixation of whole phrases rather than adding to the end of existing words or combining existing words. It can be difficult to decide which phrases belong in the dictionary, because the language&#x27;s grammar does not permit the borrowing of new verbal morphemes to express new concepts. Instead, the verb dan (to do) is combined with nominal phrases to correspond with new concepts imported from other languages.

===Noun classes===
Chechen nouns are divided into six lexically arbitrary noun classes. Morphologically, noun classes may be indexed by changes in the prefix of the accompanying verb and, in many cases, the adjective too. The first two of these classes apply to human beings, although some grammarians count these as two and some as a single class; the other classes however are much more lexically arbitrary. Chechen noun classes are named according to the prefix that indexes them:
When a noun denotes a human being, it usually falls into v- or y-Classes (1 or 2). Most nouns referring to male entities fall into the v-class, whereas Class 2 contains words related to female entities. Thus is normally considered class 1, but it takes if referring to a male neighbour and if a female. This is similar to the Spanish word , where refers to a male student, and refers to a female student.

In a few words, changing the prefixes before the nouns indicates grammatical gender; thus: → . Some nouns denoting human beings, however, are not in Classes 1 or 2: , for example, is in class 3.

====Classed adjectives====
Only a few of Chechen&#x27;s adjectives index noun class agreement, termed &quot;classed adjectives&quot; in the literature. Classed adjectives are listed with the d-class prefix in the romanizations below:
* (): &#x27;heavy&#x27; 
* (): &#x27;hot&#x27; 
* (): &#x27;long&#x27; 
* (): &#x27;thick&#x27; 
* (): &#x27;cheap&#x27; 
* (): &#x27;fat&#x27; 
* (): &#x27;thin&#x27; 
* (): &#x27;short&#x27; 
* (): &#x27;light&#x27; 
* (): &#x27;full&#x27; 
* (): &#x27;spread&#x27; 
* (): &#x27;large/big/old&#x27;

===Declension===
Whereas Indo-European languages code noun class and case conflated in the same morphemes, Chechen nouns show no gender marking but decline in eight grammatical cases, four of which are core cases (i.e. absolutive, ergative, genitive, and dative) in singular and plural. Below the paradigm for &quot;говр&quot; (horse).

===Pronouns===
The first cell has it written in the orthography; the second in IPA.

The locative has still a few further forms for specific positions.

===Verbs===
Verbs do not inflect for person (except for the special d- prefix for the 1st and 2nd persons plural), only for number and tense, aspect, mood. A minority of verbs exhibit agreement prefixes, and these agree with the noun in the absolutive case (what in English translation would the subject, for intransitive verbs, or the object, with transitive verbs).

Example of verbal agreement in intransitive clause with a composite verb:
* () = I (male) will come in one hour
* () = I (female) will come in one hour
Here, both the verb&#x27;s future stem &quot;-oghur&quot; (will come) and the auxiliary &quot;-u&quot; (present tense of &#x27;be&#x27;) receive the prefix &quot;v-&quot; for masculine agreement and &quot;y-&quot; for feminine agreement.

In transitive clauses in compound continuous tenses formed with the auxiliary verb &quot;-u&quot; &#x27;to be&#x27;, both agent and object are in absolutive case. In this special case of a &quot;biabsolutive&quot; construction, the main verb in participial form agrees with the object, while the auxiliary agrees with the agent.
* () = I (male) am making bread.
Here, the participle &quot;d-iesh&quot; agree with the object, whereas the auxiliary &quot;v-u&quot; agrees with the agent.

Verbal tenses are formed by ablaut or suffixes, or both (there are five conjugations in total, below is one). Derived stems can be formed by suffixation as well (causative, etc.):

==Vocabulary==
Most Chechen vocabulary is derived from the Nakh branch of the Northeast Caucasian language family, although there are significant minorities of words derived from Arabic (Islamic terms, like &quot;Iman&quot;, &quot;Ilma&quot;, &quot;Do&#x27;a&quot;) and a smaller amount from Turkic (like &quot;kuzga&quot;, &quot;shish&quot;, belonging to the universal Caucasian stratum of borrowings) and most recently Russian (modern terms, like computer – &quot;kamputar&quot;, television – &quot;telvideni&quot;, televisor – &quot;telvizar&quot;, metro – &quot;metro&quot; etc.).

<doc id="185121" wikidata="Q15246" url="?curid=185121" title="International Finance Centre (Hong Kong)">
<text>The International Finance Centre (abbreviated as IFC) is a skyscraper and integrated commercial development on the waterfront of Hong Kong&#x27;s Central District.

A prominent landmark on Hong Kong Island, IFC consists of two skyscrapers (1 IFC and 2 IFC), the IFC mall, and the 55-storey Four Seasons Hotel Hong Kong, respectively. 2 IFC is the second-tallest building in Hong Kong at a height of , behind the International Commerce Centre in West Kowloon, and the 38th-tallest building in the world. It is the fourth-tallest building in the Greater China region and the eighth-tallest office building in the world, based on structural heights; it is of similar height to the former World Trade Center. The Airport Express Hong Kong station is directly beneath it, with subway lines to Hong Kong International Airport.

IFC was constructed and is owned by IFC Development, a consortium of Sun Hung Kai Properties, Henderson Land and Towngas.

In 2003, &quot;Financial Times&quot;, HSBC, and Cathay Pacific put up an advertisement on the facade that stretched more than 50 storeys, covering an area of 19,000 m2 (200,000 square ft) and a length of 230 m, making it the world&#x27;s largest advertisement ever put on a skyscraper.

==History==
Tower 1 is also known as 1IFC and branded in lowercase letters, as &quot;&quot;One ifc&quot;. Likewise, Tower 2 is also known as 2IFC and branded as &quot;Two ifc&quot;&quot;.

1IFC opened in December 1998, towards the end of the Asian financial crisis. Tenants included ING Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp, Fidelity International, the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority and the Financial Times.

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority purchased 14 floors in 2IFC; the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation signed a 12-year lease on ; Nomura Group agreed to take at 2 IFC; the Financial Times, an existing tenant at One IFC, took . Ernst &amp; Young took six floors (from the 11th to 18th floors), or about , in 2IFC, to become the biggest tenant.

2IFC, which was completed at the height of the SARS epidemic, was initially available to rent at HK$25-HK$35 per square foot. In 2007, as the economy has improved, high quality (&quot;Grade A&quot;) office space is highly sought after; rents for current leases are $150 per square foot as of March 2007.

==One International Finance Centre==
One International Finance Centre was opened on 6 July 1998. It is tall, has 39 stories and four trading floors, 18 high speed passenger lifts in 4 zones, and comprises . Completed in 2004, has a similar design and appearance with the “Two IFC”. The building currently accommodates approximately 5,000 people.

==Two International Finance Centre==
Two International Finance Centre, completed on 18 October 2003, is attached to the second phase of the ifc mall. This , building, currently Hong Kong&#x27;s second tallest, is quoted as having 88 storeys and 22 high-ceiling trading floors to qualify as being extremely auspicious in Cantonese culture. It is, however, short of the magic number, because &quot;taboo floors&quot; like the 14th and 24th floors are omitted as being inauspicious – in Cantonese and Mandarin Chinese, &quot;4&quot; is pronounced similarly to &quot;death&quot;.

The highrise is designed to accommodate financial institutions. For example, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is located at the 55th floor. It is equipped with advanced telecommunications, raised floors for flexible cabling management, and nearly column-free floor plans. The building expects to accommodate up to 15,000 people. It is one of relatively few buildings in the world equipped with double-deck elevators.

Floor numbers 55, 56, 77 and 88 were bought by the HKMA for HK$3.7 billion in 2001. An exhibition area, currently containing an exhibit of Hong Kong&#x27;s monetary history, and a library of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority Information Centre occupy the 55th floor, and are open to the public during office hours.

Despite common practice for owners to allow naming buildings after its important tenants, the owners decided not to allow renaming of the building.

Current office tenants include Banco Santander, Baring Private Equity Asia, BGC Partners, Blackstone Group, BNP Paribas, China Universal Asset Management, Citadel, Coatue Management, DST Advisors, E Fund Management, Hillhouse Capital, Hony Capital, Investec Asset Management, Jefferies, Lazard, Lexington Partners, Millennium Management, Nomura, Sidley Austin LLP, Silver Lake, State Street Bank &amp; Trust Company, UBS and Warburg Pincus.

==Four Seasons Hotel Hong Kong==
The Four Seasons Hotel is a luxury hotel that was built near IFC One and Two. It was completed and opened in October 2005. The 206 m (674 ft), 60-storey oceanfront hotel is the only &quot;Four Seasons Hotel&quot; in Hong Kong. The hotel has 399 guest suites, and 519 serviced apartments. Amenities include a French restaurant Caprice and spa.

==IFC Mall==
The IFC Mall is an , 4-storey luxury shopping mall, with many luxury retail brands and a wide variety of restaurants. Anchored by Lane Crawford, PALACE Cinema (part of Broadway Circuit), and C!ty&#x27;super, the first official Apple Store was also located in this mall (a 3-storey flagship store in Hong Kong). In May 2018, the first Shake Shack restaurant in Hong Kong was opened in the mall.

==Cultural impact==
The IFC towers have been featured in several Hollywood films, including &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider – The Cradle of Life&quot;, where Lara Croft leaps off the then-under-construction 2 International Finance Centre, landing on a ship out in the Kowloon Bay, &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;, where Batman leapt from 2 IFC to 1 IFC, and Godzilla vs Kong, where an action scene then takes place.

<text>A coureur des bois (; ) or coureur de bois (; plural: coureurs de(s) bois) were independent entrepreneurial French Canadian traders who travelled in New France and the interior of North America, usually to trade with First Nations peoples by exchanging various European items for furs. Some learned the trades and practices of the indigenous peoples.

These expeditions were part of the beginning of the fur trade in the North American interior. Initially they traded for beaver coats and furs. However, as the market grew, &quot;coureurs de bois&quot; were trapping and trading prime beavers whose skins were to be felted in Europe.

==Evolution==
While French settlers had lived and traded alongside Indigenous people since the earliest days of New France, coureurs des bois reached their apex during the second half of the 17th century. After 1681, the independent coureur des bois was gradually replaced by state-sponsored voyageurs, who were workers associated with licensed fur traders. They travelled extensively by canoe. Coureurs des bois lost their importance in the fur trade by the early 18th century. Yet, even while their numbers were dwindling, the coureur des bois developed as a symbol of the colony, creating a lasting myth that would continue to define New France for centuries.
=== 1610–1630: early explorers and interpreters ===
Shortly after founding a permanent settlement at Quebec City in 1608, Samuel de Champlain sought to ally himself with the local native peoples or First Nations. He decided to send French boys to live among them to learn their languages in order to serve as interpreters, in the hope of persuading the natives to trade with the French rather than with the Dutch, who were active along the Hudson River and Atlantic coast.

The boys learned native languages, customs, and skills, and tended to assimilate quickly to their new environments. A year after leaving Étienne Brûlé in 1610, with a Huron tribe, Champlain visited him and was surprised to find the young man attired completely in native clothing and able to converse fluently in the Huron language.

Early explorers such as Brûlé educated the French colonists on the complex trading networks of the natives, served as interpreters, and encouraged the burgeoning fur trade. Between 1610 and 1629, dozens of Frenchmen spent months at a time living among the natives. Over time, these early explorers and interpreters played an increasingly active role in the fur trade, paving the way for the emergence of the coureurs des bois proper in the mid-17th century.

=== 1649–1681: Rise ===

The term &quot;coureur des bois&quot; is most strongly associated with those who engaged in the fur trade in ways that were considered to be outside of the mainstream. Early in the North American fur trade era, this term was applied to men who circumvented the normal channels by going deeper into the wilderness to trade.

Traditionally, the government of New France preferred to let the natives supply furs directly to French merchants, and discouraged French settlers from venturing outside the Saint Lawrence valley. By the mid-17th century, Montreal had emerged as the center of the fur trade, hosting a yearly fair in August where natives exchanged their pelts for European goods. While coureurs des bois never entirely disappeared, they were heavily discouraged by French colonial officials. In 1649, the new governor Louis d&#x27;Ailleboust permitted Frenchmen familiar with the wilderness to visit Huron Country to encourage and escort Hurons to Montreal to participate in the trade. While this did not legally sanction coureurs des bois to trade independently with the natives, some historians consider d&#x27;Ailleboust&#x27;s encouragement of independent traders to mark the official emergence of the coureurs des bois.

In the 1660s, several factors resulted in a sudden spike in the number of coureurs des bois. First, the population of New France markedly increased during the late 17th century, as the colony experienced a boom in immigration between 1667–84. Of the new &quot;engagés&quot; (indentured male servants), discharged soldiers, and youthful immigrants from squalid, class-bound Europe arriving in great numbers in the colony, many chose freedom in the life of the coureur des bois. Furthermore, renewed peaceful relations with the Iroquois in 1667 made traveling into the interior of Canada much less perilous for the French colonists. The companies that had been monopolizing and regulating the fur trade since 1645, the &quot;Cent Associés&quot; and the &quot;Communautés des Habitants&quot;, went bankrupt after the Iroquois war. The &quot;Compagnie des Indes occidentales&quot;, which replaced them, was much less restrictive of internal trade, allowing independent merchants to become more numerous. Finally, a sudden fall in the price of beaver on the European markets in 1664 caused more traders to travel to the &quot;pays d&#x27;en haut&quot;, or upper country (the area around the Great Lakes), in search of cheaper pelts. During the mid-1660s, therefore, becoming a coureur des bois became both more feasible and profitable.

This sudden growth alarmed many colonial officials. In 1680, the intendant Duchesneau estimated there were eight hundred coureurs des bois, or about 40% of the adult male population. Reports like that were wildly exaggerated: in reality, even at their zenith coureurs des bois remained a very small percentage of the population of New France.

=== 1681–1715: Decline ===
In 1681, to curb the unregulated business of independent traders and their burgeoning profits, French minister of marine Jean-Baptiste Colbert created a system of licenses for fur traders, known as &quot;congés&quot;. Initially, this system granted 25 annual licenses to merchants traveling inland. The recipients of these licenses came to be known as &quot;voyageurs&quot; (travelers), who canoed and portaged fur trade goods in the employ of a licensed fur trader or fur trading company. The congé system, therefore, created the voyageur, the legal and respectable counterpart to the coureur des bois. Under the voyageurs, the fur trade began to favor a more organized business model of the times, including monopolistic ownership and hired labor. From 1681 onwards, therefore, the voyageurs began to eclipse the coureurs des bois, although coureurs des bois continued to trade without licenses for several decades. Following the implementation of the congé system, the number of coureurs des bois dwindled, as did their influence within the colony.

==Lifestyle==
=== Skills===
A successful coureur des bois had to possess many skills, including those of businessman and expert canoeist. To survive in the Canadian wilderness, coureurs des bois also had to be competent in a range of activities including fishing, snowshoeing and hunting. As one Jesuit described them, venturing into the wilderness suited:The sort of person who thought nothing of covering five to six hundred leagues by canoe, paddle in hand, or of living off corn and bear fat for twelve to eighteen months, or of sleeping in bark or branch cabins. The life was physically arduous and succeeding as a coureur was extremely difficult. But the hope of making a profit motivated many, while the promise of adventure and freedom was enough to convince others to become coureurs.

=== Long distance fur trade and canoe travel ===

Because of the lack of roads and the necessity to transport heavy goods and furs, fur trade in the interior of the continent depended on men conducting long-distance transportation by canoe of fur trade goods, and returning with pelts. Early travel was dangerous and the &quot;coureurs des bois&quot;, who traded in uncharted territory, had a high mortality rate. Typically, they left Montreal in the spring, as soon as the rivers and lakes were clear of ice (usually May), their canoes loaded with supplies and goods for trading. The course west to the richest beaver lands usually went by way of the Ottawa and Mattawa rivers; it required numerous overland portages. Alternatively, some canoes proceeded by way of the upper St. Lawrence River and the lakes, passing by Detroit on the way to Michilimackinac or Green Bay. This route had fewer portages, but in times of war, it was more exposed to Iroquois attacks. The powerful Five Nations of the Confederacy had territory along the Great Lakes and sought to control their hunting grounds.

Such trading journeys often lasted for months and covered thousands of kilometers, with the &quot;coureurs des bois&quot; sometimes paddling twelve hours a day. Packing a canoe for such a trip was often arduous, as more than thirty articles were considered essential for a coureur des bois&#x27;s survival and business. He could trade for food, hunt, and fish—but trade goods such as &quot;broadcloth, linen and wool blankets, ammunition, metal goods (knives, hatchets, kettles), firearms, liquor, gunpowder and sometimes even finished clothing, took up the majority of space in the canoe.&quot; Food en route needed to be lightweight, practical and non-perishable.

=== Relationships with Indigenous Peoples ===

The business of a &quot;coureur des bois&quot; required close contact with Indigenous peoples. Native peoples were essential because they trapped the fur-bearing animals (especially beaver) and prepared the skins. Relations between &quot;coureurs&quot; and natives were not always peaceful, and could sometimes become violent. In general, trade was made much easier by the two groups maintaining friendly relations. Trade was often accompanied by reciprocal gift-giving; among the Algonquin and others, exchanging gifts was customary practice to maintain alliances. Pierre-Esprit Radisson and his companions, for instance, &quot;struck agreeable relations with Natives inland by giving European goods as gifts&quot;.Furthermore, relations between the coureur de bois and the natives often included a sexual dimension; marriage &quot;à la façon du pays&quot; (following local custom) was common between native women and coureurs des bois, and later between native women and voyageurs. These unions were of benefit to both sides, and in later years, winter partners of major trading companies also took native wives. As wives, indigenous women played a key role as translators, guides and mediators—becoming &quot;women between&quot;. For one thing, Algonquin communities typically had far more women than men, likely as a result of warfare . The remaining marriages between Algonquins tended to be polygamous, with one husband marrying two or more women. Sexual relationships with coureurs des bois therefore offered native women an alternative to polygamy in a society with few available men.

To French military commanders, who were often also directly involved in the fur trade, such marriages were beneficial in that they improved relations between the French and the natives. Native leaders also encouraged such unions, particularly when the couple formed lasting, permanent bonds. Jesuits and some upper-level colonial officials viewed these relationships with disdain and disgust. French officials preferred coureurs des bois and voyageurs to settle around Quebec City and Montreal. They considered the lasting relationships with native women to be further proof of the lawlessness and perversion of the coureurs des bois.

==Myths==
The role and importance of the coureurs des bois have been exaggerated over the course of history. This figure has achieved mythological status, leading to many false accounts, and to the coureurs des bois being assimilated with &quot;Canadiens&quot; (French Canadians).

The mythmaking followed two paths; initially, people in France judged the colonies according to the fears and apprehensions which they had of the Ancien Régime. If order and discipline were proving difficult to maintain in continental Europe, it seemed impossible that the colonies would fare any better, and it was presumed things would become even worse. Accounts of young men choosing a life where they would &quot;do nothing&quot;, be &quot;restrained by nothing&quot;, and live &quot;beyond the possibility of correction&quot; played into the French aristocracy&#x27;s fears of insubordination which only served to confirm their ignorance; and coureurs des bois became emblematic of the colony for those in the metropolis. 

The myth of the coureurs des bois as representative of the Canadians was stimulated by the writings of 18th-century Jesuit priest F-X. Charlevoix and the 19th-century American historian Francis Parkman; their historical accounts are classified as belonging to popular rather than academic history. Charlevoix was particularly influential in his writings, because he was a trusted source of information, as he was a Jesuit priest who had journeyed in Canada. But his &quot;historical&quot; work has been criticized by historians for being too &quot;light&quot; and for relying too heavily on other authors&#x27; material (i.e. plagiarizing), rather than his own first-hand account. Critics of Charlevoix have also noted that in his account, he confuses different periods of time, and therefore does not differentiate between voyageurs and coureurs des bois, misrepresenting the importance of the latter in terms of number and proportion in terms on influence on trading. But Charlevoix was influential; his work was often cited by other authors, which further propagated the myth of the Canadian as a coureur des bois.

Finally, romans du terroir (rural novels) also added to the myth of the coureurs des bois by featuring them out of proportion to their number and influence. The coureurs des bois were portrayed in such works as extremely virile, free-spirited and of untameable natures, ideal protagonists in the romanticized novels of important 19th-century writers such as Chateaubriand, Jules Verne and Fenimore Cooper.

==Reputation==
The coureurs des bois were known for their trapping abilities by outside parties but French Canadians knew these men as being looked upon without favor. The coureur des bois lived outside of the typical confines of society and had to adapt to the expectations of the Indigenous peoples around them. They did this by adopting the Indigenous people&#x27;s ritual practices and marrying Indigenous women. French Canadians associated the coureur des bois with being ungovernable and fearless men. The biggest problem with the coureur des bois was their interference with the missionary effort of the French Canadians. They denounced the French priests and missionaries and undermined their evangelistic efforts by supplying the Indigenous peoples with liquor. The coureur des bois refusal to submit to the will of the missionaries made them an enemy. This resulted in the coureur des bois being labeled as unruly and a threat to colonial survival. The coureurs des bois were renowned for their ability to trap animals for the fur trade but their overall reputation was negative for French Canadians. 

The coureurs des bois are often confused with voyagers however the two groups had very different reputations. The coureurs des bois were considered outlaws because of their lack of licenses to participate in the fur trade. The requirement of licenses to participate in trapping and trading furs limited the types of people who could participate in the lucrative trade. Trapping and trading without one of the required licenses was a legally punishable offense. The coureurs des bois were seen by the French government and French citizens as problematic because they did not abide by the licensing laws. Additionally, the coureurs des bois were seen more frequently as explorers than their voyager counterparts. The voyager&#x27;s ties to fur companies dictated how and where they trapped, whereas the coureur des bois were free to explore and trap in any place they could find. The coureur des bois freedom and intimate ties to the Indigenous peoples resulted in many French people viewing them as only a step above Native American men. 

==Notable examples==
Most coureurs des bois were primarily or solely fur-trade entrepreneurs and not individually well known. The most prominent coureurs des bois were also explorers and gained fame as such.

Étienne Brûlé was the first European to see the Great Lakes. He traveled to New France with Samuel de Champlain.

Jean Nicolet (Nicollet) de Belleborne (Ca. 1598 – 1 November 1642) was a French coureur des bois noted for exploring Green Bay in what is now the U.S. state of Wisconsin. Nicolet was born in Normandy, France in the late 1590s and moved to New France in 1618. In that same year, he was recruited by Samuel de Champlain, who arranged for him to live with a group of Algonquians, designated as the &quot;Nation of the Isle&quot;, to learn native languages and later serve as an interpreter. The natives quickly adopted Nicolet as one of their own, even allowing him to attend councils and negotiate treaties. In 1620, Nicolet was sent to make contact with the Nipissing, a group of natives who played an important role in the growing fur trade. After having established a good reputation for himself, Nicolet was sent on an expedition to Green Bay to settle a peace agreement with the natives of that area.

Médard Chouart des Groseilliers (1618–1696) was a French explorer and fur trader in Canada. In the early 1640s, des Groseilliers relocated to Quebec, and began to work around Huronia with the Jesuit missions in that area. There he learned the skills of a &quot;coureur des bois&quot; and in 1653 married his second wife, Margueritte. Her brother, Pierre-Esprit Radisson, also became a notable figure in the fur trade and is often mentioned in the same breath as des Groseilliers. Radisson and des Grosseilliers would also travel and trade together, as they did throughout the 1660s and 1670s. Together, they explored west into previously unknown territories in search of trade. Having incurred legal problems in New France because of their trade, the two explorers went to France in an attempt to rectify their legal situation. When this attempt failed, the pair turned to the English. Through this liaison with the English and thanks to their considerable knowledge and experience in the area, the pair are credited with the establishment of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company.

Pierre-Esprit Radisson (1636–1710) was a French Canadian fur trader and explorer. His life as explorer and trader is crucially intertwined with that of his brother-in-law, Médard des Groseilliers. Radisson came to New France in 1651, settling in Trois-Rivières. That same year, he was captured by the Mohawks while duck hunting. Although two of his companions were killed during this exchange, the natives spared Radisson&#x27;s life and adopted him. Through this adoption, Radisson learned native languages that would later serve him well as an interpreter. He worked throughout the 1660s and 1670s with his brother-in-law, des Groseilliers, on various trade and exploration voyages into the west of the continent. Much of Radisson&#x27;s life during this period is wrapped up in the story of des Groseilliers. Together they are credited with the establishment and shaping of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company.

Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut (1639–1710) was a French soldier and explorer who is the first European known to have visited the area where the city of Duluth, Minnesota is now located and the headwaters of the Mississippi River near Grand Rapids. In 1678 Du Lhut set out to make peace negotiations with the Sioux, Chippewas, and other tribes near Lake Superior. His negotiations were successful and were sealed by multiple intertribal marriages. Du Lhut&#x27;s freedom as a courerur des bois allowed him to explore unseen lands. Du Lhut sought permission to continue exploring however he was denied by the French court. Du Lhut&#x27;s exploration and trapping history could have been as successful as his rival René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle if he had been given permission to continue.

Jacques La Ramee (1784–1821)

Pierre de La Vérendrye (1685–1749)

Louis-Joseph de La Vérendrye and his three brothers, the sons of the Vérendrye mentioned above (1717–1761)

François Baby (1733–1820)

Jacques Baby (1731–1789)

Horace Bélanger (1836–1892)

Jean-Marie Ducharme (1723–1807)

Dominique Ducharme (1765–1853)

Luc de la Corne (1711–1784)

Jacques de Noyon (1668–1745)

Martin Chartier (1655–1718) accompanied Joliet and LaSalle, became an outlaw, and eventually traded for furs in Tennessee, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

Peter Bisaillon (1662–1742)

Jacques Le Tort (1651–1702)

James Le Tort (1675–1742)

==In literature, television, and film==
The 1910 Victor Herbert operetta &quot;Naughty Marietta&quot; featured the male-chorus marching song &quot;Tramp Tramp Tramp (Along the Highway)&quot;, which included the words, &quot;Blazing trails along the byway / Couriers de Bois are we&quot; [sic]. (Some later versions change Rida Johnson Young&#x27;s lyric to &quot;For men of war are we.&quot;)

In James A. Michener&#x27;s 1974 historical novel &quot;Centennial&quot; and the 1978–1979 NBC television mini-series of the &quot;same name&quot;, the colourful, French Canadian or French Metis, coureur des bois, from Montreal, Quebec, Canada, named Pasquinel, was introduced as an early frontier mountain man and trapper, in 1795 Colorado, Spanish Upper Louisiana Territory of Mexico, now the present-day state of Colorado. Pasquinel was portrayed in the miniseries by American TV actor Robert Conrad. The fictional character of Pasquinel was loosely based on the lives of French-speaking fur traders Jacques La Ramee and Ceran St. Vrain.

In a 1990 skit called &quot;Trappers&quot;, the Canadian comedy troupe The Kids in the Hall depict two trappers, Jacques (Dave Foley) and François (Kevin McDonald), canoeing through high-rise offices and cubicles to trap businessmen wearing designer Italian suits as a parody of this moment in Canadian colonial history.

&quot;The Revenant&quot; (2015), directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu, depicts a group of uncharacteristically violent, anti-Indian coureurs des bois in North Dakota, which was contrary to these trappers, who embraced the culture and way of life of Native Americans.

The 2016 television series &quot;Frontier&quot; chronicles the North American fur trade in late 1700s Canada, and follows Declan Harp, a part-Irish, part-Cree outlaw who is campaigning to breach the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s monopoly on the fur trade in Canada. Several fictional coureurs des bois are featured in this realistic action-drama filmed mostly on location in Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, and Ontario, Canada.

<text>Awdal (, ) is an administrative region (&quot;gobol&quot;) in western Somaliland. It was separated from Woqooyi Galbeed and became a province in 1984 and is the most northwesterly province of Somaliland. To the east it borders Maroodi Jeex and Sahil; to its north-west it borders Djibouti; to its south and south-west lies Ethiopia; and the Gulf of Aden to its north. The province has an estimated population of 1,010,566. The region comprises the four districts of Borama, the regional capital, Baki, Lughaya, and Zeila.

== Description ==

Awdal (أودل) takes its name from the medieval Adal Sultanate (عَدَل), which was originally centered on Zeila. The area along the Ethiopian border is abundant with ruined cities, which were described by the British explorer Richard F. Burton. Geologically, much of the Awdal region is located in the Arabian Plate.

== Demographics ==
The Awdal Region is mainly inhabited by the Gadabuursi subclan of the Dir who are especially well represented and considered the predominant clan of the region.

Federico Battera (2005) states about the Awdal Region:&quot;Awdal is mainly inhabited by the Gadabuursi confederation of clans.&quot;A UN report published by Canada: Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (1999), states concerning Awdal:&quot;The Gadabuursi clan dominates Awdal region. As a result, regional politics in Awdal is almost synonymous with Gadabuursi internal clan affairs.&quot;Roland Marchal (1997) states that numerically, the Gadabuursi are the predominant inhabitants of the Awdal Region:&quot;The Gadabuursi&#x27;s numerical predominance in Awdal virtually ensures that Gadabuursi interests drive the politics of the region.&quot;Marleen Renders and Ulf Terlinden (2010) both state that the Gadabuursi almost exclusively inhabit the Awdal Region:&quot;Awdal in western Somaliland is situated between Djibouti, Ethiopia, and the Issaq-populated mainland of Somaliland. It is primarily inhabited by the three sub-clans of the Gadabursi clan, whose traditional institutions survived the colonial period, Somali statehood and the war in good shape, remaining functionally intact and highly relevant to public security.&quot;There is also a sizeable minority of the Issa subclan of the Dir who mainly inhabit the Zeila district.

== Districts ==
The Awdal region consists of four districts: 


==History==
===British Somaliland, Somalia===
In British Somaliland, today&#x27;s Awdal was called &quot;Zeila-Borama&quot; district based on the region&#x27;s main city.
In around 1964, the Berbera, Borama, and Hargeisa districts were combined to form the North-Western (Hargeisa) Province.

In 1984, the Somalia government established the Awdal region.

From the late 1980s, Somalia was in a state of civil war. In northwestern Somalia, the Somali National Movement (SNM), a political organization centered on the Isaaq clan, took up arms and waged an anti-government movement. At first, the Gadabuursi clan militia fought alongside the Somalia government against the SNM. However, the SNM fought back, and in January 1991 there were battles in Dilla, Awdal, with the SNM winning and advancing as far as Borama. However, afterwards, the Gadabuursi clan made peace with the SNM, and the SNM withdrew from Awdal at an early stage.

===Re-independence of the Somaliland===
In May 1991, the SNM declared the re-independence of the State of Somaliland. The Gabadulsi clan did not necessarily want this, but they cooperated with Somaliland&#x27;s independence, based on their desire for peace and the fact that the SNM was superior militarily. After that, the Gabadulshi clan cooperated in stabilizing Somaliland, and acted as a third party in mediating disputes between the Isaaq clan. The Grand Conference of National Reconciliation in 1993 was held in Borama in Awdal.

In 2000, Borama Airport was closed.

From 2002 to 2010, the President of Somaliland was Dahir Riyale Kahin, from the Gadabuursi clan.

In March 2008, the President of Somaliland announced that the area centered on Zeila in the Awdal region would be separated to form the Salal region. However, it was not approved by the Somaliland parliament, and was reconfirmed that Zeila is in the Awdal region with the implementation of the “Local Government Act of 2019” in January 2020.

In February 2009, there was fighting between the Reer Hareed clan of the Gabiley District and the Reer Nuur clan of the Awdal region, and two people died. The conflict between the two clans dates back to 1998.

In July 2009, a riot broke out in Borama, Awdal, due to a clan conflict, and four people died.

In September 2010, an army of just under 300 troops, thought to be from the Ogaden National Liberation Front, invaded the area between Lughaya and Zeila in Awdal, but they were surrounded by the Somaliland army.

In June 2012, Rashid Hersi, who lives in Barrhaven, Ottawa, Canada, announced that Awdal had become independent and that he had been appointed president.

In February 2013, Suldaan Ibraahim Jaamac Samatar, one of the traditional leaders of Awdal, criticized Mohamed Nour Arrale, the Minister of the Interior of Somaliland, for interfering in the election of the Zeila Regional Council and worsening public security.

In April 2013, Awdal Governor criticized the large number of young people emigrating from Somaliland to other countries, and mentioned the need for restrictions.

===The Rebellion of Suldaan Wabar===
In August 2013, Suldaan Abubakar Wabar, the chief of the Jibriil Yoonis sub-clan of the Gadabuursi clan, criticized the Somaliland government for disrupting public order in Awdal and Salal, Somaliland.

In March 2014, Suldaan Ciise Suldaan C/laahi Suldaan Cumar was inaugurated as one of the Gadabuursi clan chiefs in Hayayaabe, west of Borama.

On December 5th 2014, the Jibriil Yoonis clan leader Suldaan Abuubakar Wabar led an army into the mountains and declared independence from the Somaliland government. On the other hand, Suldaan Saleebaan Cali Ismaaciil, another clan leader from Awdal, criticized Wabar&#x27;s move, saying that the administration of Awdal should be left to the Vice President of Somaliland, who is from Awdal. Meanwhile, the Awdal elders&#x27; council visited Hargeisa, the capital of Somaliland, and requested that Awdal be given &quot;fair&quot; representation.

On March 18th 2015, intellectuals, businessmen, and politicians gathered at the home of Suldaan Wabar and announced that they would &quot;liberate&quot; the Awdal region from Somaliland and join the Federal Republic of Somalia.

On March 28, 2015, several militiamen who sympathized with Sultan Abikar Waberi surrendered to the Awdal regional government in Somaliland.

In April 2015, the Somaliland government arrested six of the 40 members of the committee established by Sultan Abikar Waberi.

In October 2015, a riot broke out at the Borama football stadium, and one civilian was killed in clashes with the police. The following day, the home of the Borama police chief was attacked and set on fire, and it burned down.

In October 2015, both Ethiopia and Somaliland began operations to withdraw the militias that follow Sultan Abikar Waberi, who is based near the border.

In November 2015, Suldaan Wabar left Somaliland and returned to North America, and the approximately 70 militiamen who had followed Wabar were incorporated into the Somaliland army.

In December 2016, there was drought damage in Awdal due to a lack of rain during the rainy season.

On December 27, 2016, there was information that Suldaan Abuubakar Wabar, the chief of the Jibriil Yoonis clan, had entered the base of the Ethiopian rebels, and the Somaliland military went on high alert in Borama.

===After that===
In August 2017, the governor of Awdal was dismissed by the Vice President of Somaliland for making many mistakes.

In May 2018, Cyclone Sagar hit Awdal, making it difficult to provide support to rural areas due to the flooding.

In June 2018, students from Awdal won second and fourth place in a Quran memorization contest hosted by the President, and were awarded by the President.

In July 2018, the Minister of Finance of Somaliland announced that the Awdal region had overtaken the Togdheer region to become the second highest contributor to the national treasury in terms of tax revenue.

In October 2019, a government vehicle was fired upon by unidentified armed forces in the Awdal region. As a result, one of the commanders of the Somaliland military visited Borama in Awdal and held a countermeasures meeting with the local government and traditional elders.

In November 2019, a video was sent to the media showing around 30 armed men who said they were “liberating” the area in eastern Borama, Awdal.

In December 2019, Sultan Mohamed Abshir Du&#x27;ale, one of the traditional leaders of the Awdal region, was arrested by the Somaliland government. It is thought that this was because he opposed the government&#x27;s mining plans for the region. A protest demonstration by young people was held in Boroma, and one person was injured in a clash with the police.

On August 19, 2020, Sultan Abdirahman Dhawal, one of the traditional leaders of the Gadabuursi clan, argued that the Awdal allocation of the 82 Somaliland House of Representatives members should be increased from the current level (13 seats, 16%) to 40%.

On August 27th 2020, Ughaz Abdirashiid Ugaas Rooble, the Gadabuursi clan chief and a critic of the Awdal policy in Somaliland, set out from Ethiopia to Boroma by land, but was prevented from doing so by the Somaliland army On the same day, a violent demonstration broke out in Borama, and according to one account, several hundred young people took part.

There have been reports of incidents such as the armed clash that occurred in March 2022 between armed men and the Somaliland police at a gold mine near Borama, and the killing of three civilians in the town of Borama in May 2022 amid tensions between clans.

In May 2023, Somaliland&#x27;s Vice President Abdirahman Saylici, who is from Awdal, criticized the Somaliland government for police officers assaulting young people demonstrating in Borama.

In September 2023, a meeting of the Gadabuursi clan was held in Ottawa, Canada, and 100 people, including the clan leader Ugaas Abdirashiid Ugaas Rooble, attended to establish the Awdal State Movement (ASM), which aimed to restore Awdal to Somalia. However, the influence to the Gadabuursi clan chief in Awdal is unknown as of 2023.

In October 2023, Somaliland&#x27;s Vice President Abdirahman Saylici, who hails from Awdal, visited Borama and criticized ASM for operating outside Somaliland, saying that Awdal is definitely part of Somaliland.

In January 2024, an MoU was signed between Somaliland and Ethiopia. The details are unknown, but there is a theory that in return for Somaliland&#x27;s approval, Ethiopia will lease an unspecified part of Somaliland&#x27;s coast and establish a port and naval base. Demonstrations against this were held in Borama and Lughaya. In February, Somaliland MPs, including Awdal&#x27;s representative, expressed their opposition to the MoU.

<text>Sanag (, ) is an administrative region (&quot;gobol&quot;) in north eastern Somaliland. Sanaag has a long coastline facing the Gulf of Aden to the north, and is bordered by the region of Sahil to the west, Sool to the south and Somalia to the east. The region is disputed by the self-declared Republic of Somaliland and Puntland, a Federal Member State of Somalia. Its capital city is Erigavo. Sanaag is the largest region of Somaliland, accounting for 35% of Somaliland&#x27;s total land area.

The region is partially controlled by Puntland and Somaliland. Puntland disputes the Harti inhabited parts of region as being part of Somaliland while the latter claims the entire region based on the British Somaliland boundaries.

==Territorial dispute==
The Sanaag region is disputed between Somaliland and Puntland. Somaliland effectively controls the western and central parts of Sanaag. Puntland has effective control over Badhan and other areas in the east. Somaliland has declared its claim to all of Sanaag, but some areas (that it struggles to control) do not actually participate in Somaliland&#x27;s elections.

== History ==
From 1944 to 1974, modern-day Sanaag region was one of three districts of the Burao region. The other two districts were Burao and Las Anod. Sanaag was carved out of Togdheer region and was established as a separate region on June 23, 1973, comprising the three districts of Erigavo, Las Qorey and Garadag.

Sanaag is home to numerous archaeological sites, with rock art, ancient ruins, buildings and cairns found at numerous sites, such as Gudmo Biyo Cas, Heis, Maydh, Haylan, Qa&#x27;ableh, Qombo&#x27;ul, Gelweita and El Ayo. However, many of these old structures have yet to be properly explored, a process which would help shed further light on local history and facilitate their preservation for posterity.

Sanaag is also home to the ruined Islamic city of Maduna near El Afweyn, which is considered the most substantial and most accessible ruin of its type in Somaliland. The main feature of the ruined city includes a large rectangular mosque, its 3 metre high walls still standing and which include a mihrab and possibly several smaller arched niches. Swedish-Somali archaeologist Sada Mire dates the ruined city to the 15th–17th centuries.

==Environment==
A severe drought in the region in the early part of the 21st century caused an 80% or greater loss of livestock, though two good rainy seasons in 2004–2005 helped restore the area. Over a 15-year period of analysis, from 1988 to 2003, there was a 52% loss of forest and a 40% loss of grassland, and a 370% increase in bare land. Soil erosion due to weather and human activities and clearing of wood and brush for such uses as charcoal and fuel are issues leading to a degradation of the environment.

==Economy==
In recent history, the Sanaag region normally maintained a diverse economy, producing and then exporting to other regions, it produced livestock, frankincense, and leather for export, this was happening while the region lacked basic infrastructure, but, after the outbreak of civil war the region&#x27;s economy collapsed from loss of markets and dilapidated infrastructure has never helped, and lack of investment. Now the region only supports one main economy, livestock rearing. The Somali livestock ban imposed by Gulf countries in which was Sanaag&#x27;s largest market has virtually destroyed the economy in the region, reducing purchasing power and forcing pastoralists in the region to survive on subsistence activities.

The region is connected to Burao, capital of Togdheer region as well as to the rest of the country through the Siilaanyo road.

==Demographics==
The region is mainly inhabited by people from the Somali ethnic group, principally the Habr Yunis and Habar Jeclo sub-clans of the Isaaq and the Dhulbahante and Warsangali sub-divisions of the Harti Darod.

==Districts==
The region of Sanag is divided into 5 districts as follows:

*El Afweyn District
*Erigavo District
*Garadag District
*Badhan District
*Dhahar District

== Towns and Cities ==

*Erigavo

<text>Sool (, ) is a disputed administrative region (gobol). It borders Togdheer to the west, Sanaag to the north, Ethiopia to the south and Nugal, Bari to the east. Its capital city is Las Anod. The region is disputed by the self-declared Republic of Somaliland and SSC-Khatumo. The region is partially controlled by both polities.

==History==
From 1944 to 1974, the Sool region was formerly Las Anod district. It was one of three districts under British protection. The other two districts were the Burao and hargeysa districts.

In 1974 most Sool was part of the larger Nugaal region, with its capital at Garowe. It was established as a separate region in 1984 with its capital at Las Anod.

=== Las Anod conflict ===
Due to the prolonged conflict between Somaliland and Puntland, many Dhulbahante and Warsangeli living in the region did not recognize the Sool region and eastern Sanaag, as either Somaliland or Puntland. On 5 January 2023, Somaliland forces withdrew from Las Anod after mass civil unrest in the city. On October 19, the government of Somalia recognized the state of SSC-Khaatumo as a federal member. Since the defeat of Somaliland troops in the base in Goojacde, much of Sool has been under the control of SSC-Khatumo.

==Demographics==
The Eastern part of the Sool region is almost exclusively inhabited by Dhulbahante. Michael Walls reports:
 &quot;The residents of Sool overwhelmingly hail from a single clan grouping in the form of the Dhulbahante [...]. Sool boasts a degree of kinship homogeneity that is rare even in the Somali Horn&quot;. The Habr Je&#x27;lo clan of the Isaaq clan-family make up the vast majority of the population in western Sool, including the region&#x27;s second largest town Aynaba, as well as the wider Aynaba District.

The Habr Yunis sub-division of the Garhajis Isaaq also inhabit the western parts of Hudun and Las Anod districts in northern Sool.

The Dhulbahante sub-division of the Harti Darod clan primarily inhabits the Taleh, eastern Hudun and Las Anod districts in eastern Sool. The Fiqishini sub-clan of the Habar Gidir Hawiye integrated into Baho Nugaaled Dhulbahante, inhabit the area around Adhi&#x27;adeye.

==Districts==
The Sool region consists of 4 districts: Caynabo, Xudun, Taleex and Laas Canood.

<text>Togdheer (, ) is an administrative region (&quot;gobol&quot;) in central Somaliland. Togdheer is bordered by Maroodi Jeex to the west, Saaxil to the north, Sanaag to the northeast, Sool to the east and Ethiopia to the south. Its capital is Burao.

==Overview==
Togdheer is bordered by Maroodi Jeex from the west, Sahil to the north, Ethiopia to the south, and Sanaag &amp; Sool to the east. With its capital at Burao (Burco), the region&#x27;s name is derived from the Togdheer River, which means &quot;Long River&quot; in Somali. The region has an approximate population of 350,000 people.

Under British Somaliland, the Togdheer region was formerly the Burao district which was one of three districts that comprised the Burao region. The other two regions were Las Anod and Erigavo districts. Sanaag was carved out of Togdheer region and was established as a separate region on 23 June 1973, comprising the three districts of Erigavo, Las Qorey and Garadag.

As with much of Somaliland, most local residents in the Togdheer region are nomadic pastoralists.

==Districts==
The Togdheer region consists of the following three districts:

==Demographics==
It is primarily inhabited by the Habr Je&#x27;lo, Habr Yonis, Isamusa and Arap, all of which are subdivisions of the larger Isaaq clan-family.

The Dhulbahante of the Harti Darod clan is also present in the Buuhoodle district.

<text>Marodi Jeh (, ), formerly known as Woqooyi Galbeed (lit. &quot;North West&quot;) is an administrative region (&quot;gobol&quot;) in western Somaliland. It is the most populous region of the country. It is bordered by Awdal to the west, Sahil to the north, Togdheer to the east and Ethiopia to the south. Marodi Jeh was created by splitting the previously existing region (gobolka). 

==Etymology==
The Marodi Jeh region (meaning &quot;split elephant&quot; in Somali) corresponds with the historical name of the Tog Maroodi Jeex, a seasonal river that flows through the region during the rainy season:

Hargeisa is situated on the Tug Marodijeh, the banks of which are well wooded, and as it can boast of an excellent climate all the year round, and is about half-way on the main route from Bulhar to Jig-jigga on the Abyssinian frontier, it is always likely to be of some importance to caravans. A large percentage of the trade from Ogadayn passes through it to Bulhar on the coast.Before 2007 Maroodi Jeex was named Woqooyi Galbeed, a name which some international organisations like OCHA and FAO still refer to it as.

== History ==
Formerly known as the Hargeisa District, it was one of six districts that made up the British Somaliland protectorate. In 1960, the then independent State of Somaliland merged with Italian Somaliland to form the Somali Republic. By 1964, the then Hargeisa District merged with the Borama district (now Awdal) and the Berbera district (now Sahil) to form the Woqooyi Galbeed region (literally &quot;North West&quot;, also known as Hargeisa region).

Borama district (now Awdal) was carved out of the western parts of Woqooyi Galbeed region in June 1984. When the Somali Civil War broke out, the former British territory declared the revival of the pre-independent State of Somaliland. In 1991 Berbera district (now Sahil) was carved out of the northern parts of Woqooyi Galbeed region.

In 2007 the region of Woqooyi Galbeed was renamed to Maroodi Jeh (Chapter 1, Article 2 [23]. ]).

==Overview==
Marodi Jeh is bordered by Ethiopia to the south, the region of Awdal to the west, and Togdheer to the east. Its capital is Hargeisa. It is known to be a very strategic region with rich farmlands and large ports. It also contains the town of Toon, the traditional seat of the Isaaq Sultanate.

==Demographics==
According to the Somaliland Ministry of National Planning, Marodi Jeh har a population of 1.1 million in 2014.

Marodi Jeh is inhabited by people from the Somali ethnic group, with the Arap, Ayub,Habr Garhajis, Habr Awal and Habr Je’lo clans of the wider Isaaq clan-family.

==Districts==
Under the 2002 law, the Marodi Jeh region was divided into four major and six minor districts.

# Hargeisa District (A)
# Gabiley District (A)

<doc id="185130" wikidata="Q11084414" url="?curid=185130" title="Modernity">
<text>Modernity, a topic in the humanities and social sciences, is both a historical period (the modern era) and the ensemble of particular socio-cultural norms, attitudes and practices that arose in the wake of the Renaissancein the Age of Reason of 17th-century thought and the 18th-century Enlightenment. Commentators variously consider the era of modernity to have ended by 1930, with World War II in 1945, or as late as the period falling between the 1980s and 1990s; the following era is often referred to as &quot;postmodernity&quot;. The term &quot;contemporary history&quot; is also used to refer to the post-1945 timeframe, without assigning it to either the modern or postmodern era. (Thus &quot;modern&quot; may be used as a name of a particular era in the past, as opposed to meaning &quot;the current era&quot;.)

Depending on the field, modernity may refer to different time periods or qualities. In historiography, the 16th to 18th centuries are usually described as early modern, while the long 19th century corresponds to modern history proper. While it includes a wide range of interrelated historical processes and cultural phenomena (from fashion to modern warfare), it can also refer to the subjective or existential experience of the conditions they produce, and their ongoing impact on human culture, institutions, and politics.

As an analytical concept and normative idea, modernity is closely linked to the ethos of philosophical and aesthetic modernism; political and intellectual currents that intersect with the Enlightenment; and subsequent developments such as existentialism, modern art, the formal establishment of social science, and contemporaneous antithetical developments such as Marxism. It also encompasses the social relations associated with the rise of capitalism, and shifts in attitudes associated with secularization, liberalization, modernization and post-industrial life.
By the late 19th and 20th centuries, modernist art, politics, science and culture has come to dominate not only Western Europe and North America, but almost every populated area on the globe, including movements thought of as opposed to the West and globalization. The modern era is closely associated with the development of individualism, capitalism, urbanization and a belief in the possibilities of technological and political progress. Wars and other perceived problems of this era, many of which come from the effects of rapid change, and the connected loss of strength of traditional religious and ethical norms, have led to many reactions against modern development. Optimism and belief in constant progress has been most recently criticized by postmodernism while the dominance of Western Europe and Anglo-America over other continents has been criticized by postcolonial theory.

In the context of art history, modernity (Fr. &quot;modernité&quot;) has a more limited sense, modern art covering the period of  1860–1970. Use of the term in this sense is attributed to Charles Baudelaire, who in his 1863 essay &quot;The Painter of Modern Life&quot;, designated the &quot;fleeting, ephemeral experience of life in an urban metropolis&quot;, and the responsibility art has to capture that experience. In this sense, the term refers to &quot;a particular relationship to time, one characterized by intense historical discontinuity or rupture, openness to the novelty of the future, and a heightened sensitivity to what is unique about the present&quot;.

==Etymology==
The Late Latin adjective &quot;modernus&quot;, a derivation from the adverb &quot;modo&quot; (&quot;presently, just now&quot;, also &quot;method&quot;), is attested from the 5th century CE, at first in the context of distinguishing the Christian era of the Later Roman Empire from the Pagan era of the Greco-Roman world. In the 6th century CE, Roman historian and statesman Cassiodorus appears to have been the first writer to use &quot;modernus&quot; (&quot;modern&quot;) regularly to refer to his own age.

The terms &quot;antiquus&quot; and &quot;modernus&quot; were used in a chronological sense in the Carolingian era. For example, a &quot;magister modernus&quot; referred to a contemporary scholar, as opposed to old authorities such as Benedict of Nursia. In its early medieval usage, the term &quot;modernus&quot; referred to authorities regarded in medieval Europe as younger than the Greco-Roman scholars of Classical antiquity and/or the Church Fathers of the Christian era, but not necessarily to the present day, and could include authors several centuries old, from about the time of Bede, i.e. referring to the time after the foundation of the Order of Saint Benedict and/or the fall of the Western Roman Empire.

The Latin adjective was adopted in Middle French, as &quot;moderne&quot;, by the 15th century, and hence, in the early Tudor period, into Early Modern English. The early modern word meant &quot;now existing&quot;, or &quot;about the present times&quot;, not necessarily with a positive connotation. English author and playwright William Shakespeare used the term &quot;modern&quot; in the sense of &quot;everyday, ordinary, commonplace&quot;.

The word entered wide usage in the context of the late 17th-century quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns within the Académie Française, debating the question of &quot;Is Modern culture superior to Classical (Græco–Roman) culture?&quot; In the context of this debate, the ancients (&quot;anciens&quot;) and moderns (&quot;modernes&quot;) were proponents of opposing views, the former believing that contemporary writers could do no better than imitate the genius of Classical antiquity, while the latter, first with Charles Perrault (1687), proposed that more than a mere Renaissance of ancient achievements, the Age of Reason had gone beyond what had been possible in the Classical period of the Greco-Roman civilization. The term modernity, first coined in the 1620s, in this context assumed the implication of a historical epoch following the Renaissance, in which the achievements of antiquity were surpassed.

==Phases==
Modernity has been associated with cultural and intellectual movements of 1436–1789 and extending to the 1970s or later.

According to Marshall Berman, modernity is periodized into three conventional phases dubbed &quot;Early&quot;, &quot;Classical&quot;, and &quot;Late&quot; by Peter Osborne:

* Early modernity: 1500–1789 (or 1453–1789 in traditional historiography)
** People were beginning to experience a more modern life (Laughey, 31). 
* Classical modernity: 1789–1900 (corresponding to the long 19th century (1789–1914) in Hobsbawm&#x27;s scheme)
** Consisted of the rise and growing use of daily newspapers, telegraphs, telephones and other forms of mass media, which influenced the growth of communicating on a broader scale (Laughey, 31).
* Late modernity: 1900–1989
** Consisted of the globalization of modern life (Laughey, 31).

In the second phase, Berman draws upon the growth of modern technologies such as the newspaper, telegraph, and other forms of mass media. There was a great shift into modernization in the name of industrial capitalism. Finally, in the third phase, modernist arts and individual creativity marked the beginning of a new modernist age as it combats oppressive politics, economics as well as other social forces including mass media.

Some authors, such as Lyotard and Baudrillard, believe that modernity ended in the mid- or late 20th century and thus have defined a period subsequent to modernity, namely Postmodernity (1930s/1950s/1990s–present). Other theorists, however, regard the period from the late 20th century to the present as merely another phase of modernity; Zygmunt Bauman calls this phase liquid modernity, Giddens labels it high modernity (see High modernism).

==Definition==

===Political===
Politically, modernity&#x27;s earliest phase starts with Niccolò Machiavelli&#x27;s works which openly rejected the medieval and Aristotelian style of analyzing politics by comparison with ideas about how things should be, in favour of realistic analysis of how things really are. He also proposed that an aim of politics is to control one&#x27;s own chance or fortune, and that relying upon providence actually leads to evil. Machiavelli argued, for example, that violent divisions within political communities are unavoidable, but can also be a source of strength which lawmakers and leaders should account for and even encourage in some ways.

Machiavelli&#x27;s recommendations were sometimes influential upon kings and princes, but eventually came to be seen as favoring free republics over monarchies. Machiavelli in turn influenced Francis Bacon, Marchamont Needham, James Harrington, John Milton, David Hume, and many others.

Important modern political doctrines which stem from the new Machiavellian realism include Mandeville&#x27;s influential proposal that &quot;Private Vices by the dextrous Management of a skilful Politician may be turned into Publick Benefits&quot; (the last sentence of his &quot;Fable of the Bees&quot;), and also the doctrine of a constitutional separation of powers in government, first clearly proposed by Montesquieu. Both these principles are enshrined within the constitutions of most modern democracies. It has been observed that while Machiavelli&#x27;s realism saw a value to war and political violence, his lasting influence has been &quot;tamed&quot; so that useful conflict was deliberately converted as much as possible to formalized political struggles and the economic &quot;conflict&quot; encouraged between free, private enterprises.

Starting with Thomas Hobbes, attempts were made to use the methods of the new modern physical sciences, as proposed by Bacon and Descartes, applied to humanity and politics. Notable attempts to improve upon the methodological approach of Hobbes include those of John Locke, Spinoza, Giambattista Vico, and Rousseau. David Hume made what he considered to be the first proper attempt at trying to apply Bacon&#x27;s scientific method to political subjects, rejecting some aspects of the approach of Hobbes.

Modernist republicanism openly influenced the foundation of republics during the Dutch Revolt (1568–1609), English Civil War (1642–1651), American Revolution (1775–1783), the French Revolution (1789–1799), and the Haitian Revolution (1791–1804).

A second phase of modernist political thinking begins with Rousseau, who questioned the natural rationality and sociality of humanity and proposed that human nature was much more malleable than had been previously thought. By this logic, what makes a good political system or a good man is completely dependent upon the chance path a whole people has taken over history. This thought influenced the political (and aesthetic) thinking of Immanuel Kant, Edmund Burke, and others and led to a critical review of modernist politics. On the conservative side, Burke argued that this understanding encouraged caution and avoidance of radical change. However, more ambitious movements also developed from this insight into human culture, initially Romanticism and Historicism, and eventually both the Communism of Karl Marx, and the modern forms of nationalism inspired by the French Revolution, including, in one extreme, the German Nazi movement.

On the other hand, the notion of modernity has been contested also due to its Euro-centric underpinnings. Postcolonial scholars have extensively critiqued the Eurocentric nature of modernity, particularly its portrayal as a linear process originating in Europe and subsequently spreading—or being imposed—on the rest of the world. Dipesh Chakrabarty contends that European historicism positions Europe as the exclusive birthplace of modernity, placing European thinkers and institutions at the center of Enlightenment, progress, and innovation. Latin America&#x27;s version of modernity is a prime example of a contradiction to European modernity. During Europe&#x27;s imperial conquest, ultimately created a dominant version of colonialism that the world would associate with modernity, Mexico provided an alternative version of modernity that contradicted the brutal and harsh nature of colonial Europe. This narrative marginalizes non-Western thinkers, ideas, and achievements, reducing them to either deviations from or delays in an otherwise supposedly universal trajectory of modern development. Frantz Fanon similarly exposes the hypocrisy of European modernity, which promotes ideals of progress and rationality while concealing how much of Europe’s economic growth was built on the exploitation, violence, and dehumanization integral to colonial domination. Similarly, Bhambra argued that beyond economic advancement, Western powers &quot;modernized&quot; through colonialism, demonstrating that developments such as the welfare systems in England were largely enabled by the wealth extracted through colonial exploitation.

===Sociological===

In sociology, a discipline that arose in direct response to the social problems of modernity, the term most generally refers to the social conditions, processes, and discourses consequent to the Age of Enlightenment. In the most basic terms, British sociologist Anthony Giddens describes modernity as

Other writers have criticized such definitions as just being a listing of factors. They argue that modernity, contingently understood as marked by an ontological formation in dominance, needs to be defined much more fundamentally in terms of different ways of being. 
This means that modernity overlays earlier formations of traditional and customary life without necessarily replacing them. In a 2006 review essay, historian Michael Saler extended and substantiated this premise, noting that scholarship had revealed historical perspectives on modernity that encompassed both enchantment and disenchantment. Late Victorians, for instance, &quot;discussed science in terms of magical influences and vital correspondences, and when vitalism began to be superseded by more mechanistic explanations in the 1830s, magic still remained part of the discourse—now called &#x27;natural magic,&#x27; to be sure, but no less &#x27;marvelous&#x27; for being the result of determinate and predictable natural processes.&quot; Mass culture, despite its &quot;superficialities, irrationalities, prejudices, and problems,&quot; became &quot;a vital source of contingent and rational enchantments as well.&quot; Occultism could contribute to the conclusions reached by modern psychologists and advanced a &quot;satisfaction&quot; found in this mass culture. In addition, Saler observed that &quot;different accounts of modernity may stress diverse combinations or accentuate some factors more than others...Modernity is defined less by binaries arranged in an implicit hierarchy, or by the dialectical transformation of one term into its opposite, than by unresolved contradictions and oppositions, or antinomies: modernity is Janus-faced.&quot;

In 2020, Jason Crawford critiqued this recent historiography on enchantment and modernity. The historical evidence of &quot;enchantments&quot; for these studies, particularly in mass and print cultures, &quot;might offer some solace to the citizens of a disenchanted world, but they don&#x27;t really change the condition of that world.&quot; These &quot;enchantments&quot; offered a &quot;troubled kind of unreality&quot; increasingly separate from modernity. Per Osterrgard and James Fitchett advanced a thesis that mass culture, while generating sources for &quot;enchantment&quot;, more commonly produced &quot;simulations&quot; of &quot;enchantments&quot; and &quot;disenchantments&quot; for consumers.

===Cultural and philosophical===
The era of modernity is characterised socially by industrialisation and the division of labour, and philosophically by &quot;the loss of certainty, and the realization that certainty can never be established, once and for all&quot;. With new social and philosophical conditions arose fundamental new challenges. Various 19th-century intellectuals, from Auguste Comte to Karl Marx to Sigmund Freud, attempted to offer scientific and/or political ideologies in the wake of secularisation. Modernity may be described as the &quot;age of ideology&quot;.

Critical theorists such as Theodor Adorno and Zygmunt Bauman propose that modernity or industrialization represents a departure from the central tenets of the Enlightenment and towards nefarious processes of alienation, such as commodity fetishism and the Holocaust. Contemporary sociological critical theory presents the concept of rationalization in even more negative terms than those Weber originally defined. Processes of rationalization—as progress for the sake of progress—may in many cases have what critical theory says is a negative and dehumanising effect on modern society.

Consequent to debate about economic globalization, the comparative analysis of civilizations, and the post-colonial perspective of &quot;alternative modernities&quot;, Shmuel Eisenstadt introduced the concept of &quot;multiple modernities&quot;. Modernity as a &quot;plural condition&quot; is the central concept of this sociologic approach and perspective, which broadens the definition of &quot;modernity&quot; from exclusively denoting Western European culture to a culturally relativistic definition, thereby: &quot;Modernity is not Westernization, and its key processes and dynamics can be found in all societies&quot;.

===Secularization===
Central to modernity is emancipation from religion, specifically the hegemony of Christianity (mainly Roman Catholicism), and the consequent secularization. According to writers like Fackenheim and Husserl, modern thought repudiates the Judeo-Christian belief in the Biblical God as a mere relic of superstitious ages. It all started with Descartes&#x27; revolutionary methodic doubt, which transformed the concept of truth in the concept of certainty, whose only guarantor is no longer God or the Church, but Man&#x27;s subjective judgement.

Theologians have adapted in different ways to the challenge of modernity. Liberal theology, over perhaps the past 200 years or so, has tried, in various iterations, to accommodate, or at least tolerate, modern doubt in expounding Christian revelation, while Traditionalist Catholics, Eastern Orthodox and fundamentalist Protestant thinkers and clerics have tried to fight back, denouncing skepticism of every kind. Modernity aimed towards &quot;a progressive force promising to liberate humankind from ignorance and irrationality&quot;.

===Scientific===

In the 16th and 17th centuries, Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and others developed a new approach to physics and astronomy which changed the way people came to think about many things. Copernicus presented new models of the Solar System which no longer placed humanity&#x27;s home, Earth, in the centre. Kepler used mathematics to discuss physics and described the regularities of nature this way. Galileo actually made his famous proof of uniform acceleration in freefall using mathematics.

Francis Bacon, especially in his &quot;Novum Organum&quot;, argued for a new methodological approach. It was an experimental-based approach to science, which sought no knowledge of formal or final causes. Yet, he was no materialist. He also talked of the two books of God, God&#x27;s Word (Scripture) and God&#x27;s work (nature). But he also added a theme that science should seek to control nature for the sake of humanity, and not seek to understand it just for the sake of understanding. In both these things, he was influenced by Machiavelli&#x27;s earlier criticism of medieval Scholasticism, and his proposal that leaders should aim to control their own fortune.

Influenced both by Galileo&#x27;s new physics and Bacon, René Descartes argued soon afterward that mathematics and geometry provided a model of how scientific knowledge could be built up in small steps. He also argued openly that human beings themselves could be understood as complex machines.

Isaac Newton, influenced by Descartes, but also, like Bacon, a proponent of experimentation, provided the archetypal example of how both Cartesian mathematics, geometry and theoretical deduction on the one hand, and Baconian experimental observation and induction on the other hand, together could lead to great advances in the practical understanding of regularities in nature.

===Technological===

One common conception of modernity is the condition of Western history since the mid-15th century, or roughly the European development of movable type and the printing press. In this context the modern society is said to develop over many periods and to be influenced by important events that represent breaks in the continuity.

===Artistic===
After modernist political thinking had already become widely known in France, Rousseau&#x27;s re-examination of human nature led to a new criticism of the value of reasoning itself which in turn led to a new understanding of less rationalistic human activities, especially the arts. The initial influence was upon the movements known as German Idealism and Romanticism in the 18th and 19th centuries. Modern art therefore belongs only to the later phases of modernity.

For this reason art history keeps the term modernity distinct from the terms Modern Age and Modernism – as a discrete &quot;term applied to the cultural condition in which the seemingly absolute necessity of innovation becomes a primary fact of life, work, and thought&quot;. And modernity in art &quot;is more than merely the state of being modern, or the opposition between old and new&quot;.

In the essay &quot;The Painter of Modern Life&quot; (1863), Charles Baudelaire gives a literary definition: &quot;By modernity, I mean the transitory, the fugitive, the contingent&quot;.

Advancing technological innovation, affecting artistic technique and the means of manufacture, changed rapidly the possibilities of art and its status in a rapidly changing society. Photography challenged the place of the painter and painting. Architecture was transformed by the availability of steel for structures.

===Theological===
From conservative Protestant theologian Thomas C. Oden&#x27;s perspective, modernity is marked by &quot;four fundamental values&quot;:
* &quot;Moral relativism (which says that what is right is dictated by culture, social location, and situation)&quot;
* &quot;Autonomous individualism (which assumes that moral authority comes essentially from within)&quot;
* &quot;Narcissistic hedonism (which focuses on egocentric personal pleasure)&quot;
* &quot;Reductive naturalism (which reduces what is reliably known to what one can see, hear, and empirically investigate)&quot;
Modernity rejects anything &quot;old&quot; and makes &quot;novelty ... a criterion for truth.&quot; This results in a great &quot;phobic response to anything antiquarian.&quot; In contrast, &quot;classical Christian consciousness&quot; resisted &quot;novelty&quot;.

Within Roman Catholicism, Pope Pius IX and Pope Pius X claim that Modernism (in a particular definition of the Catholic Church) is a danger to the Christian faith. Pope Pius IX compiled a Syllabus of Errors published on December 8, 1864, to describe his objections to Modernism. Pope Pius X further elaborated on the characteristics and consequences of Modernism, from his perspective, in an encyclical entitled &quot;Pascendi Dominici gregis&quot; (Feeding the Lord&#x27;s Flock) on September 8, 1907. Pascendi Dominici Gregis states that the principles of Modernism, taken to a logical conclusion, lead to atheism. The Roman Catholic Church was serious enough about the threat of Modernism that it required all Roman Catholic clergy, pastors, confessors, preachers, religious superiors and seminary professors to swear an Oath against modernism from 1910 until this directive was rescinded in 1967, in keeping with the directives of the Second Vatican Council.

==Defined==
Of the available conceptual definitions in sociology, modernity is &quot;marked and defined by an obsession with &#x27;evidence&#x27;,&quot; visual culture, and personal visibility. Generally, the large-scale social integration constituting modernity, involves the:
* increased movement of goods, capital, people, and information among formerly discrete populations, and consequent influence beyond the local area
* increased formal social organization of mobile populaces, development of &quot;circuits&quot; on which they and their influence travel, and societal standardization conducive to socio-economic mobility
* increased specialization of the segments of society, i.e., division of labor, and area inter-dependency
* increased level of excessive stratification in terms of social life of a modern man 
* Increased state of dehumanisation, dehumanity, unionisation, as man became embittered about the negative turn of events which sprouted a growing fear. 
* man became a victim of the underlying circumstances presented by the modern world 
* Increased competitiveness among people in the society (survival of the fittest) as the jungle rule sets in.

<text>Bari (, ) is an administrative region (&quot;gobol&quot;) in northeastern Somalia that consists of six districts: Qandala, Iskushuban, Aluula, Bosaso, Bandarbeyla, and Qardho. The port city of Bosaso is the capital of the region and the largest city in Bari. The region is part of the autonomous Somali state of Puntland. 

==Overview==
It is bordered by Sool and Sanaag to the west, Nugal to the south, the Gulf of Aden to the north and the Guardafui Channel to the east. It is located on the tip of the Horn of Africa. Its name, Bari, literally means &quot;East&quot; in Somali.

In terms of landmass, Bari is the largest region in Somalia. The highest point in this region is Mount Bahaya, the third tallest mountain in Somalia with an elevation of 2120 meters; other notable peaks include Karkaar and Cal Miskaad mountains.

In 2024, Islamic State (IS) fighters wrested control of the Cal Miskaad (Al Miskaad) mountain range in Bari from rival militant group Al Shabaab.

==Demographics==
Most of the inhabitants of the Bari region belong to the Somali ethnic group including Majeerteen, Madhibaan, Deshiishe, Kaskiqabe, Warsangeli, Leelkase Darood clans and other clans According to the 2015 Population Estimation Survey, the population was 1,887,568 inhabitants. This figure combines both the rural and urban populations of Bari as well all IDPs (internally displaced persons).

==Administrative divisions==
In the official administrative divisions of Somalia, the Bari region consists of the following seven districts:

The Bari region is the largest region of the 18 administrative regions of Somalia and it contains following districts. 

* Bosaso District The capital and largest
*Qardho District 
* Alula District
* Bandarbayla District
*Waiye
* Iskushuban District
* Qandala District
* Carmo District
* Ufayn District

In 1998, Bari became a part of Puntland, an autonomous region in northeastern Somalia. In the &quot;Transitional Constitution of the Puntland Regional Government&quot; of 2001, Puntland&#x27;s territory is defined in terms of Somalia&#x27;s official regions, Bari being one of them.

In the years thereafter, Puntland changed its internal administrative division, and the Bari region was split in two: the southern half, roughly coinciding with the Qardho and Bandarbayla Districts, became the new region of Karkaar (also spelled as Karkar). It was subdivided into five new districts: Qardho, Bandarbayla, Waiye, Rako and Hafun Armo District. The northern half continued to be known as Bari and was split into seven districts: five of them keeping their original names (Bosaso, Iskushuban,
Ufayn, Qandala and Alula), as well as three new ones: Carmo,Tisjiic and Bargal.

Radio Galkacyo reported on 19 April 2011 that a new administration, called Raas Asayr, had been declared in parts of Bari Region. Farah Mahmud Yusuf was reported to have been elected as its president. Later, Barre Fatah Said there were possibilities of starting negotiation between Puntland Government and the founders of Raas Assayr state. The leaders of this prospective polity retracted their claims a few months later in June 2012, indicating that they now supported Puntland and were satisfied with the Puntland authorities&#x27; new development projects in the region.

On 8 April 2013, the Puntland government announced the creation of a new region named Gardafuul. Carved out of the Bari region, it consists of three districts and has its capital at Alula.

<text>Nugal (, , ), traditionally known as Nugaaleed-Bari or Bari-Nugaal meaning eastern Nugaal, or Nugaal xaggeeda hoose meaning &quot;lower Nugaal&quot;, is an administrative region (&quot;gobol&quot;) in northern Somalia.

==Overview==
It is bordered by Sool to the west, Bari to the north, and Mudug to the south and the Somali Region of Ethiopia. The Somali Sea flanks the province to the east. During the 1970s, Nugaal was merged with Sool province as a single province called Nugaal. According to Jaamac Cumar Ciise, the eastern parts of the Nugaal are called &quot;Nugaal xaggeeda hoose&quot; or &quot;Nugaal xeebeheeda hoose&quot;, meaning &quot;lower Nugaal&quot; and &quot;lower coastal Nugaal&quot; respectively. Nugal is centered on Garowe, which serves as the capital of the autonomous Puntland macro-region. The segments of the Nugaal valley from Garowe eastwards is traditionally referred to as Bari-Nugaaleed or Bari-Nugaal, whilst segments of the valley which converge into the Iyah plains are called &quot;Jednugaal&quot;. Nonetheless, &quot;Nugaal proper&quot; traditionally refers to segments of the valley west of Garowe.

Nugal is centered on Garowe, which serves as the capital of the autonomous Puntland macro-region. A major geographic feature of the region is the &quot;Nugaal Valley&quot;, a large shallow drainage basin fed by the Nugal and Dheer seasonal rivers during the April–June rainy season. The region was established on 8 February 1973. 

== Kobo ==
Towards the east, Nugaal Valley is separated from Nugaaleed-Bari via the region known as Kobo. Kobo was described in colonial sources ruminating about Dervish strength as follows:

<text>Hiran (, ) is an administrative region (&quot;gobol&quot;) in central Somalia and part of the Hirshabelle State.

==Overview==
Hiran is bordered by the Somali Region of Ethiopia (or the 1908 Convention Line) to the northwest, the Somali provinces of Galgudud to the northeast, Middle Shebelle (Shabeellaha Dhexe) to the south, Lower Shebelle (Shabellaha Hoose) to the southwest, and Bay and Bakool to the west. It is approximately 31,510 km2. The Shebelle River flows into Hiran from Ethiopia, coursing through the provincial capital of Beledweyne.

==Districts==
According to the Somalia government&#x27;s classification, Hiran Region consists of three districts:

# Beledweyne District
# Buloburde District
# Jalalaqsi District
# Halgan District

In May 2012, Governor Hiran appointed new governors for Mahas and Mataban Districts.

In August 2017, the Hirshabelle State, inaugurated the previous year, declared that where Hiran had previously had five districts, Beledweyne, Buloburde, Mahas, Jalalaqsi, and Mataban, it would have three new districts, Halgan, El Ali, Far- Libaax, bringing the number of districts to eight.

==Recent history==
Somalia&#x27;s civil war started around 1990. Since 1994, the Sharia law has been increasingly applied in Hiran.

In June 1995, Mohamed Farrah Aidid declared himself president of Somalia and attempted to rule Hiran, but was ousted by local clans in late 1995.

According to a 1998 report, Hiran is considered a relatively stable region within Somalia. However, banditry has flourished in the past. The governor lives in Beledweyne, and the use of militias has reduced the incidence of fighting, with the exception of Mataban District.

In June 1999, flooding in south-central Somalia caused extensive damage in Hiran.

In November 2001, the Quran School was attacked by an armed group, killing 18 students.

In August 2006, the Xawaadle and Murusade clans, who had been fighting in the Maxaas of Hiran, reconciled. However, the agreement was violated and the conflict resumed, so a peace conference was held again in October 2007.

In November 2007, militants attacked government forces near Beledweyne in Hiran. In January 2008, militants attacked an Ethiopian military base near Beledweyne.

In September 2010, the establishment of a local government called Dooxada Shabeelle was proclaimed in Kalabayr, Hiran, led by C/fataax Xasan Afrax.

In March 2011, a bombing by Al-Shabaab occurred in Beledweyne.

In December 2011, Ethiopian troops and Ahlu Sunna Waljama&#x27;a completely retook the city of Baladweyne from al-Shabaab.

In May 2013, Governor Hiran decided to send deserter soldiers from al-Shabaab who are hiding, and asked the local population for help in sending them to rehabilitation facilities.

In November 2013, a disease outbreak killed 40 people in Ceel-Cali, Hiran.

In March 2014, Hiran&#x27;s executive government asked foreign charities for help, saying that healthcare was in crisis after the withdrawal of a Swiss hospital last year.

In October 2014, the AMISOM base in Hiran was attacked.

In May 2015, at a meeting in Beledweyne, a proposal was made to divide Hiran into two regions.

In December 2015, the Somali government replaced Governor Hiran for his involvement in the murders in Beledweyne. In the same month, the Somali President visits Beledweyne.

In January 2016, three people were killed in a clan war in Hiran.

In August 2016, Somalia&#x27;s interior minister rejected a local request to divide Hiran into two regions.

In October 2016, Somali government and Ethiopian troops withdrew from the Halgan District of Hiran and were replaced by al-Shabaab. The withdrawal of Ethiopian troops is reportedly related to a state of emergency declaration issued in response to anti-government protests in Ethiopia.

In December 2016, Governor Hiran destroyed more than 50 charcoal burning facilities in Mataban District to prevent illegal logging and arrested more than 20 people.

In November 2017, the Hiran government declared a halt to the use of Somali shillings because villages controlled by al-Shabaab refused to accept high denomination 1,000 Somali shilling bills and because of the influx of counterfeit bills from Puntland, which caused massive inflation. United States dollars were to be used for transactions.

In October 2019, Beledweyne was severely damaged by the flooding of the Jubba and Shebelle Rivers. In November 2019, the African Union Commission assisted flooded Beledweyne with $87,000 worth of relief supplies.

In March 2020, President Mohamed Abdi Ware of Hirshabelle State dismisses Hiran Governor Ali Mohamed Arale and reappoints his predecessor Ali Jeyte Osman, but Arale refuses.

In June 2022, a clan attacked the al-Shabaab base in Booco.

<text>Middle Shabelle (, , ) is an administrative region (&quot;gobol&quot;) in southern Somalia. 

It is bordered by Hiran to the north, Galgaduud to the east, the Indian Ocean to the south and the region of Lower Shabelle and the capital Mogadishu to the west. The Shabelle River also passes through this region. 

The region of Middle Shabelle formed the Hirshabelle State by 2016, which considers itself an autonomous state within the larger Federal Republic of Somalia, as defined by the Provisional Constitution of the Federal Republic of Somalia.

RADIO ASAL 
Radio Asal is private Radio located jowhar city capital of Hir-Shabelle State in Somalia.
Radio Asal is a local Radio 88.6 MHz jowhar-somali.

==Overview==

As part of the former Benadir region, Middle Shabelle&#x27;s capital was Mogadishu up until the mid-1980s, when the town of Jowhar became the capital. It is named after the Shebelle River that passes through this region.

The region is regarded as one of the most fertile regions in Somalia and was the first region to have multiple factories opened up in it, such as a sugar and clothes factory. It was also the main source of local grown food before the civil war. 

Today, the region supports livestock production, rain-fed and irrigated agriculture and fisheries, with an annual rainfall between 150 and 500 millimeters. Covering an area of approximately 60,000 square kilometres, the region has a 400 kilometre coastline on the Indian Ocean. The Shabelle river runs for 150 kilometres through the region.

==Demographics==
A pre-war census estimated the population at 2 million and today the Regional Council claims that the region&#x27;s population is around 1.5 million. It is also estimated that 60% of the regions population are nomads or farmers.

However, the FSNAU population estimate survey in 2022 estimated the population as being 1,618,324, which is highly disputed.

The majority clans in the region Are the Abgaal and Galjecel. Other clans that live in the region include other Mudulood clans.

==Districts==
Middle Shabelle Region consists of 11 districts:

* Jowhar District
* Balcad District

<text>Banaadir (, , ) is an administrative region (&quot;gobol&quot;) in southeastern Somalia. It covers the same area as the city of Mogadishu, which serves as the capital. It is the only region in the country not belonging to any of the six states. It is bordered to the northwest by the Shabelle river, and to the southeast by the Indian Ocean. Although by far the smallest administrative region in Somalia, it has the largest population, estimated at 1,650,227 (including 369,288 internally displaced persons) in 2014.

The territorial extent and scope of the term &quot;Benaadir&quot; has varied in definition throughout its history, with medieval usage extending Benaadir to huge swaths of coast adjacent to Mogadishu stretching as far as hundreds of miles, from Hobyo in the north. The early modern period which extended the meaning of &quot;Benaadir&quot; to the interior midway towards the Hirshabelle region, to the contemporary period wherein sometimes the nonstandard misnomer of usage being interchangeable with the city of Mogadishu. This Banaadir municipality is bordered to the north by Hirshabelle and to the southwest by South West, and is the only Somali &quot;gobol&quot; (administrative region) which is both a municipality and a &quot;gobol&quot; known as a region.

==Overview==

The Banaadir region is bordered by the Middle Shebelle (Shabeellaha Dhexe) and Lower Shebelle (Shabeellaha Hoose), as well as the Indian Ocean.

&quot;Benaadir&quot; is derived from the Somali &quot;banaadir&quot;, which means &quot;coast&quot;, in reference to the southern Somali coastal cities Mogadishu, Merka and Barawa. The place name reflects the region&#x27;s medieval position as a key trade center with Persia, Arabian Peninsula and the Swahili coast.

The name derives from the Persian bandar (بندر) meaning ‘port’ or ‘harbour’.

Its capital is Mogadishu, known locally as Xamar (pronounced: Hamar), although the administrative region itself is coextensive with the city. Benaadir is much smaller than the historical region of Benadir, which covered most of the country&#x27;s central and southern seaboard opposite the Indian Ocean and up to the Juba River, including Mogadishu.

Thabit M. Abdi was appointed mayor of Mogadishu and governor of Banaadir in 2017, succeeding Yusuf Hussein Jimale who held that post since November 2015.

==History==
===Political===
Tradition and old records assert that southern Somalia, including the Mogadishu area, was inhabited by Benadiris for centuries and was during the early modern period considered the wealthiest city on the East African coast, as well as the center of a thriving textile industry. In the 17th century, Mogadishu and parts of southern Somalia fell under the Hiraab Imamate and in the 19th century came under the Geledi Sultanate&#x27;s sphere of influence.

After the Somali Republic became independent in 1960, Mogadishu became known and promoted as the &quot;White Pearl of the Indian Ocean&quot;. After the ousting of the Siad Barre regime in 1991 and the ensuing Somali Civil War, various militias fought for control of the city, later to be replaced by the Islamic Courts Union in the mid-2000s. The ICU thereafter splintered into more radical groups, notably the al-Shabaab, which fought the Transitional Federal Government (2004–2012) and its African Union Mission to Somalia allies. With a change in administration in late 2010, government troops and their military partners had succeeded in forcing out Al-Shabaab by August 2011. Mogadishu has then subsequently experienced a period of intense reconstruction.

==Population==

The 1,650,227 (as of 2014) residents of Benaadir are 50.7% female and come from 303,021 households. It has the highest percentage of residents who are internally displaced persons among the regions of Somalia, because of its relative safety, economic opportunities and availability of resources.

==Districts==

The Banaadir region consists of seventeen districts. Warta Nabada District was previously known as Wardhigley District until it was officially renamed in 2012. Kahda District was formed in 2013 and is still absent from most maps.

<doc id="185143" wikidata="Q856719" url="?curid=185143" title="Gedo">
<text>Gedo (, , , or &quot;Ghedu&quot;) is an administrative region (&quot;gobol&quot;) in Jubaland, southern Somalia. Its regional capital is Garbahaarreey. The region was formed during 1974 and is bordered by the Ogaden in Ethiopia, the North Eastern Province in Kenya, and the Somali regions of Bakool, Bay, Jubbada Dhexe (Middle Juba), and Jubbada Hoose (Lower Juba) further down east. The southern parts of Gedo, west of the Jubba River, used to be part of the old British Trans-Juba region during half of the seventy years of colonial era in Africa from 1890 to 1960. The British and Italians fought twice over this area.

The regional capital is Garbaharey.

President Siad Barre&#x27;s forces withdrew to Gedo following the collapse of the Somali Democratic Republic in the early 1990s. After 1991, the Somali National Front Omar Haji Mohamed held large parts of the region for many years. In collaboration with the SNF, Gedo joined the growing trend of Islamic Courts at the start of the Somali Civil War and local sharia courts succeeded in making Luuq District one of Somalia&#x27;s safest areas for much of the 1990s. The militant religious group al-Itihaad al-Islamiya (AIAI) also rose to power in the region later, taking over the city of Luuq as its headquarters. The Ethiopian National Defence Force then entered the area to attack AIAI&#x27;s bases in 1996. The first democratically elected governor of the administrative region was Hussein Farey, who entered office in 2008.

==Districts==

Gedo Region consists of seven districts:

*El Wak District
*Bardhere District
*Balet Hawo District
*Doolow District
*Garbahaarreey District
*Luuq District
*Buurdhuubo District

The Dawa and Jubba rivers are the two major rivers of the region.

==History==
==Education==
The city of Garbahaarreey and the region&#x27;s two ancient cities of Luuq and Bardera had education systems up to the secondary level. There were some technical schools in Bardera and Garbaharreey, albeit without a curriculum. They are connected through the Gedo Education Committee. All of Gedo region&#x27;s high school graduates attended the Somali National University or affiliated institutions in Mogadishu.

Since the civil war in Somalia, Gedo became one of half dozen regions which have restarted higher education institutions in the country. Bardera Polytechnic, Gedo&#x27;s first college, and the University of Gedo, are both located in Bardera.

==Demographics==
According to a 1994 UNOSOM II estimate, the population of Gedo was about 590,000. The United Nations Development Programme estimated the total population in 2005 at 328,378; and UN estimates from 2014 stand at some 508,000.

==Economy==
The economy mostly depends on livestock and farming, but the Gedo region has strong interregional and international cross-border trade with Kenya and to some extent with Ethiopia. Trade across Somalia, Kenya and Ethiopia allowed the Gedo region to be economically stable for the years before the UN intervention and afterward. The 1998 Nordic Fact Finding Mission prepared a report on the Gedo region and found some encouraging economic figures. Davidson College assistant professor Ken Menkhaus said that &quot;Traders in Gedo region made more profit than, for instance, those in Hargeisa, in north-western Somalia.&quot; Trade going through the border between the three countries was ongoing despite the raging civil war in Somalia for much of the 1990.

==Government==
Gedo region has a 32-member assembly body. The members are directly elected from the seven districts of the region with proportionality according to district population. The Gedo assembly or (Gollaha Gobalka Gedo) works with the federal government based in Mogadishu. Regional level posts include:

* Governor
* Vice Governor 
* Inter-Regional Affairs Director
* Director of Security Services
* Gedo Regional Police Commander
* Director of Education Services
* Director of Agricultural Agency
* Director of Economic Affairs
* Livestock and Forestry Dept. Director
* Director of Justice and Religious Affairs

After long conflicts in the region, the regional elders started a peace conference with initiatives from the then governor, Aden Ibrahim Aw Hirsi. This effort ended in success. and were followed by the elections of the regional assembly. The process was financed by UNDP.

In addition to regional posts, the Federal Government of Somalia maintains military forces in the region. Brigade 9 of Division 60 (Somalia) was reported in the region as of 2016, originating from a U.S.-funded pilot programme that began in 2012.

==Cities and towns==
Bardera and Buulo Haawo cities are the two principal cities of the Gedo region. In the recent past, Luuq or Lugh used to be the main political city of the Gedo Region, but the Somali Civil War made many of the city&#x27;s residents to flee to other towns.

Bardera, the largest city and the seat of the most populous district in Gedo, has become urbanized to the extent that its population multiplied 400% since the breakdown of law and order in the capital of the country, Mogadishu. Aside from the urban population in proper Bardera, the rest of the region&#x27;s population are pastoralists with the exception of people living in the cities where the region&#x27;s seven district seats are located. The town is home to Bardera Polytechnic as well as the University of Gedo which also has a campus at Buulo Haawo.

<doc id="185146" wikidata="Q513026" url="?curid=185146" title="African thrush">
<text>The African thrush or West African thrush (Turdus pelios) is a passerine bird in the thrush family Turdidae. It is common in well-wooded areas over much of the western part of sub-Saharan Africa, it was once considered to be conspecific with the olive thrush but that species has now been split further. Populations are resident (non-migratory).

==Description==
The African Thrush has dark olive-grey upperparts. The underparts show a whitish evenly brown- streaked side throat, the breast is greyish brown and the flanks are pale buff-orange with this colour not extending on to the lower breast, the belly and vent are white. It has a yellow-orange bill. It weighs and measures in length.

===Voice===
The song of the African thrush is a sustained, clear warbling made up of different phrases repeated rather randomly in a sequence. Also a high-pitched squealing flight call.

==Distribution==
The African thrush is distributed from Senegal and Gambia in the west to South Sudan, Ethiopia and Eritrea south to northwestern Zambia and western Angola.

==Habitat==
The African thrush can be found in all sorts of wooded habitats including forest edge, riparian woodland, scrub cultivation, parks and gardens.

==Habits==
The African thrush is normally encountered either singly or in pairs and is shy and retiring, preferring to remain in cover, but will come out and gather at fruiting trees. Usually forages in the ground, flicking leaf litter and searching through vegetation. Where undisturbed or habituated to people will feed out in the open in a similar fashion to the song thrush in Europe, and it is also reported to crack open snails on an anvil stone like a song thrush. Foraging is crepuscular and fruit, especially that of the nim &quot;Azadarichta indica&quot;, as well as figs, papaya, berries and seeds, makes up most of the diet supplemented with invertebrates and the occasional small fish.

Breeding is recorded in all months, but breeding activity peaks in the wet season, which is March to September or October in West Africa, April–July in Ethiopia and November to March in the rest of its range. The nest is cup shaped and bulky and is constructed using plant fibres and mud lined with fine grasses, leaves and roots. This nest is placed on a horizontal branch, in a tree fork or among vines, usually at a height lower than 10 m from the ground. It may re-use the abandoned nest of another species. The female is responsible for incubating the normal clutch of 2–3 eggs; both sexes feed the young. It is double brooded.

==Taxonomy==
The African thrush may be part of a superspecies with the Kurrichane thrush and the bare-eyed thrush, and some subspecies of African thrush (&quot;T.p. poensis&quot;, &quot;T.p.nigrilorum&quot;, &quot;T.p. centralis&quot; and &quot;T.p. chinguanicoides&quot;) have been considered subspecies of olive thrush.

The currently recognised subspecies and their distributions are:

*&quot;Turdus pelios chiguancoides&quot; : Senegal east to northern Ghana. 
*&quot;Turdus pelios saturatus&quot; : west Ghana east to central Cameroon, western Congo and Gabon. 
*&quot;Turdus pelios nigrilorum&quot; : Mount Cameroon. 
*&quot;Turdus pelios poensis&quot; : Bioko (formerly Fernando Póo). 
*&quot;Turdus pelios pelios&quot; : eastern Cameroon east to South Sudan, western Eritrea and western, central and eastern Ethiopia.
*&quot;Turdus pelios centralis&quot; : eastern Congo and southern Central African Republic east to southern Ethiopia, western Kenya and north-western Tanzania. 
*&quot;Turdus pelios bocagei&quot; : western Democratic Republic of Congo and north-western and western Angola. 
*&quot;Turdus pelios graueri&quot; : eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, Rwanda and western Tanzania. 
*&quot;Turdus pelios stormsi&quot; : south-eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, eastern Angola and northern Zambia.

<text>The Warsaw Metro () is a rapid transit underground system serving the Polish capital Warsaw. It currently consists of two lines, the north–south M1 line which links central Warsaw with its densely populated northern and southern districts, and the east–west M2 line. Three more lines (M3, M4, and M5) are planned. The system is operated by Metro Warszawskie, a company owned by the city, and managed by Public Transport Authority in Warsaw. As of 2025, it is the only metro system in Poland. 

The first section of M1 was opened in 1995 and the line was gradually extended until it reached its full length in October 2008. The contract for the construction of the initial central section of M2 was signed on 28 October 2009 and construction began on 16 August 2010. The initial segment of M2, measuring with seven stations, one of which, Świętokrzyska, includes a transfer between the two lines, was opened on 8 March 2015. The line&#x27;s further extensions have been opening since 2019, and it is expected to be completed in 2026, when it will have 21 stations.

In February 2023, the mayor of Warsaw Rafał Trzaskowski released a plan for the Warsaw Metro, calling for five metro lines by the year 2050. The plan includes constructing two additional M1 stations, Plac Konstytucji and Muranów, extending M2 line to Marymont and Ursus-Niedźwiadek, as well as construction of three new lines: M3, M4, and M5. With those extensions the metro would directly serve 17 out of Warsaw’s 18 districts.

== History ==
=== Early attempts (1918-1939) ===
Plans to build an underground rail system in Warsaw date as far back as 1918, when the idea was first proposed after Warsaw regained its status as Poland&#x27;s capital city. An underground railway system was expected to solve the transport difficulties of the densely built city center. Proper preliminary planning and boring work were initiated by the Warsaw Tramway Authority in 1925, with construction expected to start in the late 1920s. The Great Depression buried those plans as Poland and the world were gripped by economic hardship. 

In 1934, with the election of a new mayor of Warsaw, Stefan Starzyński, work was to resume on the metro. The mayor dusted off the plans from the mid-1920s, and with some minor adjustments, construction of the metro was planned to start by the late 1930s, with a projected finishing date of the first of two projected lines scheduled for the mid-1940s. By then, the subway network was to consist of two lines. Line M1 (north–south line, long) was to follow a route similar to the present-day line and was to link the southernmost borough of Mokotów with the city center and the northern borough of Żoliborz. This line was to be connected with the newly constructed Warszawa Główna railway station and the railway tunnel crossing the city from west to east. Line M2 (east–west, long) was to start beneath the westernmost borough of Wola, proceed along the Chłodna street to the pivotal station beneath the Saxon Square and then further eastwards to the Vistula river escarpment. There, the line was to go overground, cross the river through a newly built bridge and proceed to the easternmost railway station of Warszawa Wschodnia. Altogether, in 35 years, 7 lines were to be built. The works finally started in 1938, but World War II brought an end to the ambitious undertaking. The short trace tunnels made in 1938 serve as a wine cellar today.

=== Post-war plans (1945-1950) ===
The city suffered heavily during World War II. Although the majority of pre-war projects were destroyed during the war, most of the engineers behind their creations survived and returned to their city to take part in its rebirth. However, the new Communist authorities of Poland envisioned a city completely different from what it had been before the war. As the &quot;ideal&quot; communist city, Warsaw was to be decentralized and the need to commute to the city center was reduced. Thus, the Office for the Reconstruction of Warsaw (BOS) commissioned several engineers to prepare a project for a fast urban railway (SKM) crossing the city in a deep cutting. Although to a large extent it was to follow line 1 of the pre-war plans, only the central stations were to be located underground. However, by the end of the decade, the project was cancelled. Instead, in 1948 communist planners developed a different concept with the new SKM morphing into a rapid transit line at a depth of up to . The suggested north–south direction, with three parallel branches of the same line in the city center, corresponded to the planned development of the city along the Vistula. The works, however, never started and this project was also abandoned.

=== Cold War era tunnels (1950-1957) ===

In the 1950s, as the Cold War raged on, Soviet strategic plans required that a secure transport link across the river Vistula be built. One of the ways to achieve this was to create a deep metro system in Warsaw ( up to beneath the ground), which would be interlinked with the rail network and could serve as an underground conduit for transporting troops. Plans assumed that the first line (about long) would lie along a north–south axis, with a branch of the same line crossing the Vistula river in the city centre. The construction works started almost simultaneously at 17 different points on both sides of the river. By 1953 only of tunnels had been built; after the death of Joseph Stalin and the start of a period of détente, all work was halted under the pretext of technical difficulties. In the following years, only one junction tunnel and one shield-driven tunnel were continued. These works were undertaken experimentally, to discover the best driving methods suitable for the ground conditions beneath Warsaw (pliocene clay formations layer spread beneath quaternary soils). All work was halted in 1957, and the tunnel eventually flooded in 1960.

=== Current Metro (1983-Present) ===

==== Planning &amp; construction ====
In 1955, planners returned to the old idea of a shallow metro network. However, the planning phase proceeded at a very slow pace and the economic situation prevented all successive governments from actually starting serious work. Finally, in 1983, the program was approved by the government and the first tunnels were built. Lack of funds, technical difficulties, shortage of materials and outdated tunnelling methods meant that the work progressed very slowly, sometimes at a speed no greater than per day.

==== Opening ====
The Metro was opened on 7 April 1995 with a total of 11 stations. The initial line, M1, has 21 stations over a route distance of .

Many of the station name announcements are narrated by Ksawery Jasieński, with some newer stations using recordings by Maciej Gudowski.

==== Newer extensions ====
On 11 March 2016, a 1 billion PLN (€225 million) contract was awarded to the Italian company Astaldi to build the first phase of the north-east M2 extension with of track and 3 stations: Szwedzka, Targówek Mieszkaniowy, and Trocka. On 30 April, construction on Szwedzka station started, and on 2 May, the other two stations started construction. Construction of this phase took 3 years, until it opened on 15 September 2019. Initially, this extension was to be built at the same time as the west extension which was due to be completed in 2020. However, due to delays, it was decided that each extension will be built at its own pace. The extension from Rondo Daszyńskiego to Księcia Janusza was opened on 4 April 2020, and the extension from Księcia Janusza to Bemowo was opened on 30 June 2022. On 28 September 2022, the extension of M2 consisting of three new stations: Zacisze, Kondratowicza, and Bródno was opened to the public.

Turkish construction firm Gülermak was commissioned in November 2018 to complete the three western-most stations on the line – Lazurowa, Chrzanów and Karolin.

Initially, all of the trains were Russian-built 81-series metro cars. They first arrived in Warsaw in 1990 as a &quot;gift&quot; from the USSR, five years before the Metro&#x27;s opening, from the Metrovagonmash plant in Mytishchi near Moscow (model 81-717.3/714.3 - 10 carriages). Subsequent trains arrived from Saint Petersburg&#x27;s Vagonmash (I. E. Yegorov) Plant in 1994 (81-572/573 - 32 carriages) and an additional 18 81-572.1/573.1 carriages in 1997.

In 1995 the metro began operation with 14 three-car trainsets, with 5 minute intervals between trains during rush hours. With the opening of the Centrum metro stations the trains were extended to four cars and their number was increased to 15.

In 1998, 108 new carriages of the modern Metropolis family were ordered from the French company Alstom, forming 18 six-car trainsets. These were all delivered by 2005 (24 were produced in Barcelona and the remainder in the Alstom Konstal plant in Chorzów). 

In 2006, additional 30 carriages were ordered from Russia to extend the existing 81-series to the target length of six cars, with deliveries taking place up to 2007.

In 2007 five new Russian 81-series trains with redesigned front-ends were purchased, with the contract extended to seven in 2009.

In February 2011, an order was signed with German manufacturer Siemens for 35 complete trains from their new Inspiro line. A large number of these were manufactured in Poland by Newag. The first five trains were put into service in 2013. However, in November 2013 a fire broke out in one of the carriages and for safety reasons all five trains were withdrawn from operation until the cause of the fire was determined. Once the investigation was completed the five new Inspiro trains were placed back into service in March 2014. In 2012, a non-revenue diesel shunting locomotive, classified as , was manufactured by in Stargard, designed especially for shunting Inspiro trains at the Kabaty depot.

By 2020, the Siemens Inspiro formed the majority of the operating rolling stock.

Originally the 81-series and Alstom Metropolis trains were painted in two horizontal stripes of equal width, the upper one white and the lower one red, with a blue bar identifying the M1 line between them. For the Simens Inspiro a livery with a yellow and red stripe under the windows was chosen in order to resemble the color scheme of the surface public transport taken from the flag of Warsaw. Subsequently the older trains have had the blue bar replaced with a yellow one during scheduled refurbishment.

In January 2020, Škoda Transportation was awarded a new contract for 37 new, single-space trains, named the Varsovia. The first EMU arrived in Warsaw on April 25, 2022, in October the first unit entered regular passenger service on the M1 line.

With the delivery of the Škoda Varsovia the obsolete 81-series is being gradually retired, units in good technical condition have been donated for spare parts to Kyiv and Kharkiv, where trains of the type are still common. A single trainset of this is to be kept in working order as a museum exhibit and seasonal operation while 3 others remain in Warsaw for spare parts. 

===Depots===
A single depot is located south of the Kabaty station. There is a single-track connection () between the depot and Warszawa Okęcie railway station on the PKP rail network. This link is not electrified and is used only for an occasional rolling-stock transfer. A second depot (Karolin) is currently under construction and is expected to open in 2026. A third depot (Kozia Górka) is planned to be built as part of the first section of the M3 line from Stadion Narodowy to Gocław.

== Retired stock ==
Despite being retired in Poland, the 81-series trains are still widespread in several V4 countries and are well-known in Europe. Compared to west European metro systems (such as Berlin U-Bahn or Paris Metro), these trains can maintain higher average speeds, 80 km/h maximum and 35-40 km/h average, there were produced in several thousands, so their spare parts are still on high demand abroad. So, some trains were donated to Ukraine. Unlike, for example, Hungary, Ukraine decided not to buy the Russian spare parts, as Polish ones already met this demand.

==Plans==
The M1 line does not pass directly under Warsaw&#x27;s Old Town, the city&#x27;s main tourist attraction, which has few public transport links, passing it about to the west instead. It also does not directly connect to the Warszawa Central railway station, with the nearest stop being over to the east. Until the opening of M2 in March 2015, the metro system was confined to the western bank of Vistula, thus doing nothing to ease traffic problems on Warsaw&#x27;s bridges: a major bottleneck between the city center and the eastern Praga district. Plans for a third line to Warsaw Chopin Airport have been abandoned for the foreseeable future, with the airport served by a newly built railway station instead.

Transport planners have suggested that the WKD, a light rail line that runs to the western suburbs, could be integrated with the city&#x27;s tram system, or be more closely tied to the metro and a future suburban rail network, or both. The first such plans were prepared in the late 1930s and the railway tunnel running below the city center was to be shared by both the railways and the metro. The WKD, PKP and Warsaw Metro systems are integrated and Warsaw city travel cards are also valid in the suburban trains operated by SKM and KM.

===Future extensions===

* Plac Konstytucji and Muranów, two stations omitted from the original plan to reduce cost that were to be built by 2009;
* extension of the M2 line, with the Lazurowa, Chrzanów, and Karolin metro stations, as well as the new Karolin Depot. This section is set to be completed in 2026;
*the M3 line set to begin construction in 2028. The first section from Stadion Narodowy to Gocław is planned to be completed by 2032.

== Reception ==
In 2009, the Warsaw Metro won two &quot;Metro Award&quot; prizes in the categories of &quot;Special Merit Award for Commitment to the Environment&quot; and &quot;Best Maintenance Programme&quot;. These were followed by the Most Improved Metro award in 2011. The system consistently receives very high ratings among its passengers; a survey conducted in September 2014 indicated that 98% of the respondents rated it as good or very good.

<text>Tickell&#x27;s thrush (Turdus unicolor) is a passerine bird in the thrush family Turdidae. It is common in open forest in the Himalayas, and migrates seasonally into peninsular India, Nepal and rarely to Bangladesh. 

The name commemorates the British ornithologist Samuel Tickell who collected in India and Burma.

== Characteristics ==
Males of the Tickell&#x27;s thrush have uniform blue-grey upperparts, a whitish belly and vent. Adults have yellow beak and legs while it may be darker in juveniles. There is a yellow eye-ring which is thinner and fainter than the Indian black bird which is usually bigger in size. Females and young birds have browner upperparts.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
Tickell&#x27;s thrush builds nests from April to June using mostly dry grass.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Populations move further south in India and Nepal in winter.

<text>The orange-headed thrush (Geokichla citrina) is a bird in the thrush family.

It is common in well-wooded areas of the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia. Most populations are resident. The species shows a preference for shady damp areas, and like many &quot;Geokichla&quot; and &quot;Zoothera&quot; thrushes, can be quite secretive.

The orange-headed thrush is omnivorous, eating a wide range of insects, earthworms and fruit. It nests in trees but does not form flocks.

The male of this small thrush has uniform grey upperparts, and an orange head and underparts. The females and young birds have browner upper parts.

==Taxonomy==
This species was first described by John Latham in 1790 as &quot;Turdus citrinus&quot;, the species name meaning &quot;citrine&quot; and referencing the colour of the head and underparts. It has about 12 subspecies. Rasmussen and Anderton (2005) suggest that this complex may consist of more than one species.
*&quot;G. c. citrina&quot;, the nominate subspecies breeds from northern India east along the Himalayas to eastern Bangladesh and possibly in western and northern Burma. It winters further south in India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. 
*&quot;G. c. cyanota&quot; is mainly resident in Peninsular India south to Kerala. It has a white throat and face sides, with two black stripes running downwards from below the eyes. The spelling emendation &quot;cyanota&quot; is suggested by Rasmussen and Anderton.
*&quot;G. c. amadoni&quot; (not always recognized) found in northeastern part of peninsular India (Madhya Pradesh and Orissa) has brighter orange crown and longer wings than &quot;cyanota&quot;.
*&quot;G. c. innotata&quot; breeds through most of South-East Asia from southern Burma and southwestern China to northwest Thailand, central and southern Laos, Cambodia and southern Vietnam. It winter further south in southern Burma, and much of the rest of Thailand into Malaysia. It is very similar to the nominate but the male is brighter or deeper orange and lacks white tips to the median coverts; the female is duller on head and underparts, with an olive tinge to the grey of the mantle and back.
*&quot;G. c. melli&quot; breeds in southeastern China, and is partially migratory, regularly wintering in Hong Kong.
*&quot;G. c. courtoisi&quot; breeds in eastern-central China; its wintering range is unknown.
*&quot;G. c. aurimacula&quot; breeds in southern Vietnam, Hainan and possibly northern Laos. It resembles &quot;G. c. cyanota&quot;, but with a less defined head pattern. The face and neck-sides are whitish but flecked with orange or brownish and with weaker face stripes. The orange breast and flanks become paler orange on the belly and lower flanks.
*&quot;G. c. andamensis&quot; is resident in the Andaman Islands.
*&quot;G. c. albogularis&quot; is resident in the Nicobar Islands.
*&quot;G. c. gibsonhilli&quot; breeds from southern Burma to southern Thailand, and winters further south at lower levels in Peninsular Thailand, on islands in the Gulf of Thailand, and into Malaysia. It is similar to the nominate subspecies, but averages slightly brighter or deeper orange on head and upperparts and also has a slightly longer, heavier bill, and white tips to the median coverts.
*&quot;G. c. aurata&quot; is resident in the mountains of northern Borneo.
*&quot;G. c. rubecula&quot; is resident in Western Java.
*&quot;G. c. orientis&quot; is resident in Eastern Java and Bali and intergrades with &quot;G. c. rubecula&quot; in the west of its range. The separation of this form from the western Javan subspecies has been questioned.

===Measurements===
The following table summarises selected physical measurements for those subspecies for which data is available.

==Distribution and habitat==
The orange-headed thrush breeds in much of the Indian Subcontinent, including Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka, and through Southeast Asia to Java and southern China. Its habitat is moist broadleaved evergreen woodlands, with a medium-density undergrowth of bushes and ferns, but it also utilises bamboo forests for secondary growth. &quot;G. c. cyanota&quot; also occurs in large gardens and orchards.

This species is often found in damp areas, near streams or in shady ravines. It occurs between 250 and 1830 metres (825– 6040 ft) in the Himalayas and up to about 1500 metres (5000 ft) in Malaysia, Thailand and Java. &quot;G. c. aurata&quot; is resident between 1000 and 1630 metres (3300–5400 ft) on Mt Kinabalu and Mt Trus Madi, northern Borneo. Some of the subspecies are completely or partially migratory; their wintering habitat is similar to the breeding forests, but more likely to be at lower altitudes.

==Description==

The orange-headed thrush is 205–235 milliimetres (8.1–9.25 in) long and weighs 47–60 grammes (1.7–2.1 oz). The adult male of the nominate subspecies of this small thrush has an entirely orange head and underparts, uniformly grey upperparts and wings, and white median and undertail coverts. It has a slate-coloured bill and the legs and feet have brown fronts and pink or yellowish rears.

The female resembles the male but has browner or more olive upperparts and warm brown wings, but some old females are almost identical to the male. The juvenile is dull brown with buff streaks on its back, and a rufous tone to the head and face; it has grey wings. The bill is brownish horn, and the legs and feet are brown.

This species&#x27; orange and grey plumage is very distinctive, and it is unlikely to be confused with any other species. Differences between the subspecies, as described above, can be quite striking, as with the strong head pattern on &quot;G. c. cyanota&quot;, but may be less obvious variations in plumage tone, or whether there is white on the folded wing. As with many other thrushes, all forms of this species shows a distinctive underwing pattern, with a strong white band.

===Voice===
Calls of the orange-headed thrush include a soft &#x27; or &#x27;, a screeching &#x27;, and a thin &#x27; or &quot;&quot; given in flight. However, this bird is generally silent especially in winter. The song is a loud clear series of variably sweet lilting musical notes, recalling the quality of the common blackbird, but with the more repetitive structure of the song thrush. It also includes imitations of other birds like bulbuls, babblers and common tailorbird. It sings from a perch in a leafy tree, mostly early morning and late afternoon.

==Behaviour==
The orange-headed thrush is a shy, secretive bird usually occurring alone or in pairs, but is comparatively more easily seen than many other &quot;Geokichla&quot; thrushes, and several birds may congregate outside the breeding season at a good food source. It has a swift, silent flight, but when disturbed will often sit motionless until the threat has passed.

===Breeding===
The nest, built by both sexes, is a wide but shallow cup of twigs, bracken and rootlets lined with softer plant material like leaves, moss and conifer needles. It is constructed at a height of up to 4.5 metres (15 ft) in a small tree or bush, with mango trees and coffee bushes being preferred. Three or four, occasionally five, eggs are laid; they are cream or tinted with pale blue, grey or green, and have pale lilac blotches and reddish brown spots. They are incubated for 13–14 days to hatching, with another 12 days until the young birds leave the nest.

This species is a host of the pied cuckoo, &quot;Clamator jacobinus&quot;, a brood parasite which lay a single egg in the nest. Unlike the common cuckoo, neither the hen nor the hatched chick evict the host&#x27;s eggs, but the host&#x27;s young often die because they cannot compete successfully with the cuckoo for food. The chestnut-winged cuckoo, &quot;Clamator coromandus&quot;, and, very rarely, the common cuckoo, &quot;Cuculus canorus&quot; have also been claimed as parasites on this species.

===Feeding===
The orange-headed thrush feeds on the ground in dense undergrowth or other thick cover. It is most active at dawn and dusk, probing the leaf litter for insects and their larvae, spiders, other invertebrates and fruit. In Malaysia, wintering birds regularly feed on figs.

==Status==
The orange-headed thrush has an extensive range, estimated at . The population size has not been quantified, but it is believed to be large due to its extensive range; it also reported as being locally common. The species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the global population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as Least Concern.

It is very popular as cage-bird on Java, and numbers have severely declined in recent years owing to trapping for aviculture. Against the trend in Southeast Asia where loss or fragmentation of woodland poses a threat to forest birds, the orange-headed thrush has colonized Hong Kong, where it was first recorded in 1956, thanks to forest maturation.

<text>Chats (formerly sometimes known as &quot;chat-thrushes&quot;) are a group of small Old World insectivorous birds formerly classified as members of the thrush family (Turdidae), but following genetic DNA analysis, are now considered to belong to the Old World flycatcher family (Muscicapidae).

The name is normally applied to the more robust ground-feeding flycatchers found in Europe and Asia and most northern species are strong migrants. There are many genera and these birds in particular make up most of the subfamily Saxicolinae.

Other songbirds called &quot;chats&quot; are:
* Australian chats, genera &quot;Ashbyia&quot; and &quot;Epthianura&quot; of the honeyeater family (Meliphagidae). They belong to a more ancient lineage than Saxicolinae.
* American chats, genus &quot;Granatellus&quot; of the cardinal family (Cardinalidae), formerly placed in the wood-warbler family. They belong to a more modern lineage than Saxicolinae.
* Yellow-breasted chat (&quot;Icteria virens&quot;), an enigmatic North American songbird previously placed in the wood-warbler family (Parulidae) and now in the monotypic Icteriidae; its true relationships are unresolved.

<text>Isostasy (Greek &#x27;equal&#x27;, &#x27;standstill&#x27;) or isostatic equilibrium is the state of gravitational equilibrium between Earth&#x27;s crust (or lithosphere) and mantle such that the crust &quot;floats&quot; at an elevation that depends on its thickness and density. This concept is invoked to explain how different topographic heights can exist at Earth&#x27;s surface. Although originally defined in terms of continental crust and mantle, it has subsequently been interpreted in terms of lithosphere and asthenosphere, particularly with respect to oceanic island volcanoes, such as the Hawaiian Islands.

Although Earth is a dynamic system that responds to loads in many different ways, isostasy describes the important limiting case in which crust and mantle are in static equilibrium. Certain areas (such as the Himalayas and other convergent margins) are not in isostatic equilibrium and are not well described by isostatic models.

The general term &quot;isostasy&quot; was coined in 1882 by the American geologist Clarence Dutton.

==History of the concept==
In the 17th and 18th centuries, French geodesists (for example, Jean Picard) attempted to determine the shape of the Earth (the geoid) by measuring the length of a degree of latitude at different latitudes (arc measurement). A party working in Ecuador was aware that its plumb lines, used to determine the vertical direction, would be deflected by the gravitational attraction of the nearby Andes Mountains. However, the deflection was less than expected, which was attributed to the mountains having low-density roots that compensated for the mass of the mountains. In other words, the low-density mountain roots provided the buoyancy to support the weight of the mountains above the surrounding terrain. Similar observations in the 19th century by British surveyors in India showed that this was a widespread phenomenon in mountainous areas. It was later found that the difference between the measured local gravitational field and what was expected for the altitude and local terrain (the Bouguer anomaly) is positive over ocean basins and negative over high continental areas. This shows that the low elevation of ocean basins and high elevation of continents is also compensated at depth.

The American geologist Clarence Dutton use the word &#x27;isostasy&#x27; in 1889 to describe this general phenomenon. However, two hypotheses to explain the phenomenon had by then already been proposed, in 1855, one by George Airy and the other by John Henry Pratt. The Airy hypothesis was later refined by the Finnish geodesist Veikko Aleksanteri Heiskanen and the Pratt hypothesis by the American geodesist John Fillmore Hayford.

Both the Airy-Heiskanen and Pratt-Hayford hypotheses assume that isostacy reflects a local hydrostatic balance. A third hypothesis, lithospheric flexure, takes into account the rigidity of the Earth&#x27;s outer shell, the lithosphere. Lithospheric flexure was first invoked in the late 19th century to explain the shorelines uplifted in Scandinavia following the melting of continental glaciers at the end of the last glaciation. It was likewise used by American geologist G. K. Gilbert to explain the uplifted shorelines of Lake Bonneville. The concept was further developed in the 1950s by the Dutch geodesist Vening Meinesz.

== Models ==
Three principal models of isostasy are used:
# The Airy–Heiskanen model – where different topographic heights are accommodated by changes in crustal thickness, in which the crust has a constant density
# The Pratt–Hayford model – where different topographic heights are accommodated by lateral changes in rock density.
# The Vening Meinesz, or flexural isostasy model – where the lithosphere acts as an elastic plate and its inherent rigidity distributes local topographic loads over a broad region by bending.

Airy and Pratt isostasy are statements of buoyancy, but flexural isostasy is a statement of buoyancy when deflecting a sheet of finite elastic strength. In other words, the Airy and Pratt models are purely hydrostatic, taking no account of material strength, while flexural isostacy takes into account elastic forces from the deformation of the rigid crust. These elastic forces can transmit buoyant forces across a large region of deformation to a more concentrated load.
Perfect isostatic equilibrium is possible only if mantle material is in rest. However, thermal convection is present in the mantle. This introduces viscous forces that are not accounted for the static theory of isostacy. The isostatic anomaly or IA is defined as the Bouger anomaly minus the gravity anomaly due to the subsurface compensation, and is a measure of the local departure from isostatic equilibrium. 
At the center of a level plateau, it is approximately equal to the free air anomaly. Models such as deep dynamic isostasy (DDI) include such viscous forces and are applicable to a dynamic mantle and lithosphere. Measurements of the rate of isostatic rebound (the return to isostatic equilibrium following a change in crust loading) provide information on the viscosity of the upper mantle.

=== Airy ===

The basis of the model is Pascal&#x27;s law, and particularly its consequence that, within a fluid in static equilibrium, the hydrostatic pressure is the same on every point at the same elevation (surface of hydrostatic compensation):

h1⋅ρ1 = h2⋅ρ2 = h3⋅ρ3 = ... hn⋅ρn

For the simplified picture shown, the depth of the mountain belt roots (b1) is calculated as follows:

:formula_1
:formula_2
:formula_3

where formula_4 is the density of the mantle (ca. 3,300 kg m−3) and formula_5 is the density of the crust (ca. 2,750 kg m−3). Thus, generally:

:&quot;b&quot;1 ≅ 5⋅&quot;h&quot;1

In the case of negative topography (a marine basin), the balancing of lithospheric columns gives:

:formula_6
:formula_7
:formula_8

where formula_4 is the density of the mantle (ca. 3,300 kg m−3), formula_5 is the density of the crust (ca. 2,750 kg m−3) and formula_11 is the density of the water (ca. 1,000 kg m−3). Thus, generally:

:&quot;b&quot;2 ≅ 3.2⋅&quot;h&quot;2

=== Pratt ===
For the simplified model shown the new density is given by: formula_12, where formula_13 is the height of the mountain and c the thickness of the crust.

=== Vening Meinesz / flexural ===

This hypothesis was suggested to explain how large topographic loads such as seamounts (e.g. Hawaiian Islands) could be compensated by regional rather than local displacement of the lithosphere. This is the more general solution for lithospheric flexure, as it approaches the locally compensated models above as the load becomes much larger than a flexural wavelength or the flexural rigidity of the lithosphere approaches zero.

For example, the vertical displacement &quot;z&quot; of a region of ocean crust would be described by the differential equation

:formula_14

where formula_15 and formula_16 are the densities of the aesthenosphere and ocean water, &quot;g&quot; is the acceleration due to gravity, and formula_17 is the load on the ocean crust. The parameter &quot;D&quot; is the &quot;flexural rigidity&quot;, defined as

:formula_18

where &quot;E&quot; is Young&#x27;s modulus, formula_19 is Poisson&#x27;s ratio, and formula_20 is the thickness of the lithosphere. Solutions to this equation have a characteristic wave number

:formula_21

As the rigid layer becomes weaker, formula_22 approaches infinity, and the behavior approaches the pure hydrostatic balance of the Airy-Heiskanen hypothesis.

==Depth of compensation==
The depth of compensation (also known as the &quot;compensation level&quot;, &quot;compensation depth&quot;, or &quot;level of compensation&quot;) is the depth below which the pressure is identical across any horizontal surface. In stable regions, it lies in the deep crust, but in active regions, it may lie below the base of the lithosphere. In the Pratt model, it is the depth below which all rock has the same density; above this depth, density is lower where topographic elevation is greater.

==Implications==

===Deposition and erosion===
When large amounts of sediment are deposited on a particular region, the immense weight of the new sediment may cause the crust below to sink. Similarly, when large amounts of material are eroded away from a region, the land may rise to compensate. Therefore, as a mountain range is eroded, the (reduced) range rebounds upwards (to a certain extent) to be eroded further. Some of the rock strata now visible at the ground surface may have spent much of their history at great depths below the surface buried under other strata, to be eventually exposed as those other strata eroded away and the lower layers rebounded upwards.

An analogy may be made with an iceberg, which always floats with a certain proportion of its mass below the surface of the water. If snow falls to the top of the iceberg, the iceberg will sink lower in the water. If a layer of ice melts off the top of the iceberg, the remaining iceberg will rise. Similarly, Earth&#x27;s lithosphere &quot;floats&quot; in the asthenosphere.

===Continental collisions===
When continents collide, the continental crust may thicken at their edges in the collision. It is also very common for one of the plates to be underthrust beneath the other plate. The result is that the crust in the collision zone becomes as much as thick, versus for average continental crust. As noted above, the Airy hypothesis predicts that the resulting mountain roots will be about five times deeper than the height of the mountains, or 32 km versus 8 km. In other words, most of the thickened crust moves &quot;downwards&quot; rather than up, just as most of an iceberg is below the surface of the water.

However, convergent plate margins are tectonically highly active, and their surface features are partially supported by dynamic horizontal stresses, so that they are not in complete isostatic equilibrium. These regions show the highest isostatic anomalies on the Earth&#x27;s surface.

=== Mid-ocean ridges ===
Mid-ocean ridges are explained by the Pratt hypothesis as overlying regions of unusually low density in the upper mantle. This reflects thermal expansion from the higher temperatures present under the ridges.

=== Basin and Range ===
In the Basin and Range Province of western North America, the isostatic anomaly is small except near the Pacific coast, indicating that the region is generally near isostatic equilibrium. However, the depth to the base of the crust does not strongly correlate with the height of the terrain. This provides evidence (via the Pratt hypothesis) that the upper mantle in this region is inhomogeneous, with significant lateral variations in density.

===Ice sheets===

The formation of ice sheets can cause Earth&#x27;s surface to sink. Conversely, isostatic post-glacial rebound is observed in areas once covered by ice sheets that have now melted, such as around the Baltic Sea and Hudson Bay. As the ice retreats, the load on the lithosphere and asthenosphere is reduced and they &quot;rebound&quot; back towards their equilibrium levels. In this way, it is possible to find former sea cliffs and associated wave-cut platforms hundreds of metres above present-day sea level. The rebound movements are so slow that the uplift caused by the ending of the last glacial period is still continuing.

In addition to the vertical movement of the land and sea, isostatic adjustment of the Earth also involves horizontal movements. It can cause changes in Earth&#x27;s gravitational field and rotation rate, polar wander, and earthquakes.

===Lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary===
The hypothesis of isostasy is often used to determine the position of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB).

<text>Handley Page Limited was a British aerospace manufacturer. Founded by Frederick Handley Page (later Sir Frederick) in 1909, it was the United Kingdom&#x27;s first publicly traded aircraft manufacturing company. It went into voluntary liquidation and ceased to exist in 1970. The company, based at Radlett Aerodrome in Hertfordshire, was noted for its pioneering role in aviation history and for producing heavy bombers and large airliners.

==History==

Frederick Handley Page first experimented with and built several biplanes and monoplanes at premises in Woolwich, Fambridge and Barking Creek. His company, founded on 17 June 1909, became the first British public company to build aircraft.

In 1912, Handley Page established an aircraft factory at Cricklewood after moving from Barking. Aircraft were built there, and flown from the company&#x27;s adjacent airfield known as Cricklewood Aerodrome, which was later used by Handley Page Transport. The factory was later sold off to Oswald Stoll and converted into Britain&#x27;s largest film studio, Cricklewood Studios.

===World War I===
During the First World War, Handley Page produced a series of heavy bombers for the Royal Navy to bomb the German Zeppelin yards, with the ultimate intent of bombing Berlin in revenge for the Zeppelin attacks on London. Handley Page had been asked by the Admiralty to produce a &quot;bloody paralyser of an aeroplane&quot;. These aircraft included the O/100 of 1915, the O/400 of 1918 and the four-engined V/1500 with the range to reach Berlin. The V/1500 had only just entered operational service as the war ended in 1918.

The Handley Page factory at Radlett Aerodrome employed women as part of the war effort, and was visited by royalty.

===Interwar period===
In early 1919, a Handley Page V/1500 aircraft, dubbed &quot;Atlantic&quot;, was shipped to Newfoundland to attempt the world&#x27;s first non-stop Transatlantic flight; only to be beaten by a Vickers Vimy piloted by Alcock and Brown in June of that year. The &quot;Atlantic&quot; flew into New York City via Canada on 9 October 1919, carrying the first airmail from Canada to the United States of America.

In the immediate postwar years, Handley Page modified some O/400&#x27;s for passenger use, which they flew on the London-Paris route as Handley Page Transport. The V/1500 was considered too large to be practical at the time, but many design features of the V/1500 were later incorporated into an O/400 airframe to produce their first dedicated passenger design, the W.8 that led to a series of similar airliners, fitted with two or three engines, which, aside from being used by Handley Page Transport, were also exported to Belgium.

In 1924 Handley Page Transport merged with two other airlines to create Imperial Airways, as the UK&#x27;s national airline service, which continued to use a number of the W.8, W.9 and W.10 series of airliners. Handley Page continued to develop large biplane airliners, including the luxurious Handley Page H.P.42, for use on Imperial routes to Africa and India.

Handley Page developed the Handley Page Slat (or slot), an auxiliary airfoil mounted ahead and above the wing, which formed a narrow gap which improved airflow at high angles of attack and improved low-speed handling. The leading edge slat was simultaneously designed by the German aerodynamicist Gustav Lachmann, who was later employed by Handley Page. The design was so successful that licensing fees to other companies were their main source of income in the early 1920s.
In 1929, Cricklewood Aerodrome was closed and Handley Page moved the aircraft final assembly to Radlett Aerodrome. Cricklewood Aerodrome was taken over by Cricklewood Studios, the largest film studio in the UK at that time. Manufacture of aircraft parts and sub-assemblies continued until 1964 at Cricklewood when the remainder of the site was sold off and a Wickes home renovation store currently occupies the site.

===World War II===
With the Second World War looming, Handley Page designed and produced the HP.52 Hampden bomber, which took part in the first British raid on Berlin.

In response to a 1936 government request for heavier, longer ranged aircraft, Handley Page tendered the HP.56 design powered by twin Rolls-Royce Vultures and this was ordered, along with what became the Avro Manchester. However the Vulture proved so troublesome that – years before the engine was abandoned by Rolls-Royce in 1940 – the Air Staff decided that the HP.56 should be fitted with four engines instead. Therefore, before reaching the prototype stage, the HP.56 design was reworked into the four-engined HP.57 Halifax. The Halifax became the second most-prolific British heavy bomber of the war after the Avro Lancaster (itself essentially a four-engine development of the Manchester). Although in some respects (such as crew survivability) better than the Lancaster, the Halifax suffered in terms of altitude performance and was redeployed toward the end of the war as a heavy transport and glider tug, with several variants being specifically built as such, including the HP.70 Halton.

===Postwar===

After the war, the British Government sought tenders for jet bombers to carry the nation&#x27;s nuclear deterrent. The three types produced were known as the V-Bombers, and Handley Page&#x27;s contribution was the HP.80 Victor, a four-engined, crescent-winged design. This aircraft remained in service (as a tanker aircraft) well beyond the demise of the company which created it.

In 1947 Handley Page bought some of the assets of the bankrupt Miles Aircraft company. These assets include existing designs, tools and jigs, most notably for the Miles M.52 supersonic research aircraft, and the Miles site at Woodley, near Reading. The operation was named Handley Page (Reading) Ltd, a company constituted to buy and operate the assets formed out of the inactive Handley Page Transport Ltd. The most significant of the inherited designs became the Herald airliner. Designs from the Reading site used the initials HPR (&quot;Handley Page (Reading)&quot;).

===Demise===
Unlike other large British aircraft manufacturers, Handley Page resisted the government&#x27;s pressure to merge into larger entities. By the late 1960s, the British aviation industry was dominated by two companies: Hawker Siddeley and the British Aircraft Corporation.

Unable to compete for government orders or build large commercial aircraft, Handley Page produced its final notable Handley Page design, the Jetstream. This was a small turboprop-powered commuter aircraft, with a pressurised cabin and a passenger capacity of 12 to 18. It was designed primarily for the United States &quot;feederliner&quot; market.

Although successful, Jetstream was too late to save Handley Page, and the company went into voluntary liquidation in March 1970 and was wound up after 61 years trading under the same name. The Jetstream lived on, the design being purchased and produced by Scottish Aviation at Prestwick, continuing after the company was bought by British Aerospace in 1977.

==Sites==

Radlett Aerodrome was opened in 1929 as a grass aerodrome for Handley Page Civil Aircraft. Its runway was extended in 1939 to enable production of Halifax bombers. By the time of its closure the airfield had two runways:

* 03/21 approximately 
* 15/33 approximately 

Most of the towers, hangars and runways were demolished in the 1970s after the Company was terminated. The M25 Motorway now runs on the south side of the site, with Lafarge Aggregates now owning the remainder. The runway surface was removed and replaced with grass, but a shadow remains when viewed from the air.

The aerodrome was used in the 1962 film, The Iron Maiden.

===Designations===

Handley Page originally used a letter sequence to designate types (i.e. &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot; etc.). Beginning with the model E, the letter was used in combination with a slash and a number that referred to the installed horsepower, at least initially. However the 100 in O/100 indicated the type&#x27;s 100-foot wingspan, while other designs it may or may not have been meaningful other than as a design sequence. By 1923, the company had come to the end of the alphabet and had begun reusing earlier letters, but this would have become confusing, so from 1924 they assigned the letters &quot;HP&quot; and a sequential number to indicate the model, with previous aircraft being retroactively assigned numbers in the new sequence, starting with the Type A as the HP.1. Thus the O/400 became the HP.16 and the W.8 the HP.18. Unbuilt projects were skipped from this sequence.

When the assets of Miles Aircraft were taken over, the latter&#x27;s Reading design office used &quot;HPR&quot; for Handley Page Reading, followed by a number as with the HPR.1 Marathon.

<text>A safari (; originally ) is an overland journey to observe wild animals, especially in East Africa. The so-called &quot;Big Five&quot; game animals of Africa – lion, leopard, rhinoceros, elephant, and Cape buffalo – particularly form an important part of the safari market, both for wildlife viewing and big-game hunting.
== Etymology ==
The Swahili word means &quot;journey&quot;, originally from the Arabic noun , meaning &quot;journey&quot;, &quot;travel&quot;, &quot;trip&quot;, or &quot;tour&quot;; the verb for &quot;to travel&quot; in Swahili is . These words are used for any type of journey, e.g., by bus from Nairobi to Mombasa or by ferry from Dar es Salaam to Unguja. &quot;Safari&quot; entered the English language at the end of the 1850s thanks to explorer Richard Francis Burton.

The Regimental March of the King&#x27;s African Rifles was &quot;Funga Safari&quot;, literally &#x27;set out on a journey&#x27;, or, in other words, pack up equipment ready for travel.

Which is, in English:

On Kenya&#x27;s independence from the United Kingdom, &quot;Funga Safari&quot; was retained as the Regimental March of the Kenya Rifles, the successor to the KAR.

==History==
The origins of safari can be traced back to the first arrivals of Europeans and Arabs in Africa, long before the colonization era, but the big history of it began in the 19th century, when academic and economic interest to Africa increased in Western society, and technological advances and medicine (most notably the discovery of quinine as a remedy against malaria) allowed foreigners to step up deep into the continent safely enough. These expeditions established the concept of safari-style travel. While the goal of most was geographical discovery, the search for minerals and new routes of communication, others were primarily aimed at hunting animals, and elephant tusks at the first.

In 1836, William Cornwallis Harris led an expedition to observe and record wildlife and landscapes. Harris established the safari style of journey, starting with a not-too-strenuous rising at first light, an energetic day walking, an afternoon rest, and concluding with a formal dinner and telling stories in the evening over drinks and tobacco. The hunting aspect traditionally associated with the safari is said to have its origins in the early 17th century in the region of Évora, Alentejo, where villagers got together to hunt wild boar and reclaim land for farming.

The firm of Newland &amp; Tarlton Ltd (founded 1904) pioneered luxury tented safaris.

==Literary genre==
Jules Verne&#x27;s first novel &quot;Five Weeks in a Balloon&quot; published in 1863 and H. Rider Haggard&#x27;s first novel &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; published in 1885, both describe journeys of English travellers on safari and were best sellers in their day. These two books gave rise to a genre of Safari adventure novels and films.

Ernest Hemingway wrote several fiction and nonfiction pieces about African safaris. His short stories &quot;The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber&quot; and &quot;The Snows of Kilimanjaro&quot; are set on African safaris and were written after Hemingway&#x27;s own experience on safari. His books &quot;Green Hills of Africa&quot; and &quot;True at First Light&quot; are both set on African safaris.

==Cinematic genre==
The safari provided countless hours of cinema entertainment in sound films from &quot;Trader Horn&quot; (1931) onwards. The safari was used in many adventure films such as the Tarzan, Jungle Jim, and Bomba the Jungle Boy film series up to &quot;The Naked Prey&quot; (1965) where Cornel Wilde, a white hunter, becomes game himself. The safari genre films were parodied in the Bob Hope comedies &quot;Road to Zanzibar&quot; and &quot;Call Me Bwana&quot;. A short 15-minute helicopter safari was shown in &quot;Africa Addio&quot;, where clients are armed, flown from their hotel, and landed in front of an unlucky and baffled elephant. &quot;Out of Africa&quot; has Karen Blixen and famous hunter Denys Finch Hatton travelling, with Denys refusing to abandon home comforts using fine china and crystal, and listening to Mozart recordings over the gramophone while on safari trip.

==Fashion==

The safari style originated from British officers and the jackets worn during their campaigns in Africa. There is a particular theme or style associated with the word, which includes khaki clothing, belted bush jackets, pith helmets or slouch hats, and animal skin patterns. Pith helmet was initially worn by the British military in the tropics and was adopted as streetwear between 1870 and 1950. Condé Nast describes safari jackets as, &quot;crisp drill cotton with pockets, buttons, epaulets, belt&quot;, and a part of Kenyan colonial style.

For Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s 1909–1910 safari trip, he was &quot;outfitted&quot; in safari-style by his friend Lord Cranworth during his post-presidential trip. Lord Cranworth&#x27;s firm, Newland &amp; Tarlton, is a luxury safari outfitter, creating safari-style clothing. Additionally, other sources state Roosevelt was outfitted by Willis &amp; Geiger in 1908. Hemingway, like Roosevelt on safari, chose to use British style rifles produced by Holland &amp; Holland or Westley Richards. Within Hollywood, celebrities like Grace Kelly and Johnny Weissmuller wore safari jackets. Ernest Hemingway wore safari-style jackets, communicating a form of adventure also echoed in Hollywood. According to Conde Nast, the Safari jacket is still a part of contemporary fashion.

In the 2005 spring/summer edition of British Vogue, an article titled &quot;World Vision: the grown-up approach to global style&quot; featured &quot;haute safari&quot; style clothing. Contemporary American public figures such as Melania Trump have worn safari fashion. Mrs. Trump wore a safari-style dress and jackets during her 2018 trip to Africa. On this trip Mrs. Trump went on a safari in Kenya, she wore a pith helmet. Some have criticized the choice as evoking colonial ideals. In 2014, Harper&#x27;s Bazaar announced trend alerts featuring animal prints and a “safari sleek&quot; style. Couture designers in their 2015 fashion shows featured variations of safari-style in their collections. Designer Yang Lei featured a silk safari-style evening gown in his Spring/Summer collection during Paris Fashion Week. Alexander Wang&#x27;s collection focused on a variety of white shirts, including a safari-style white shirt dress. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described designer Alberta Ferretti&#x27;s 2015 daywear collection as &quot;safari-sleek&quot;.

In John Molloy&#x27;s history of the leisure suit, he details that safari-style originated from British Officers wearing their uniforms outside military uses as &quot;a status symbol, but only in casual settings.&quot; Molloy stated in 1975 that it continues to be a form of casual menswear. Alternatively, in Malindi Kenya, professional wear in the 1990s included safari-style clothing. Yves Saint Laurent&#x27;s 1967 Africa collection featured the &quot;Saharienne&quot; safari jacket. In later collections, Yves Saint Laurent produced an iconic safari top. According to Harper&#x27;s Bazaar, the collection was &quot;a fantasy of primitive genius.&quot; On the other hand, differing fashion historians believe He had the gift of borrowing from one culture without being condescending to the other.

The term &quot;safari chic&quot; arose after the release of the film &quot;Out of Africa&quot;. It included not only clothing but also interior design and architecture. Safari-style interiors feature African decor, various hues of brown, natural materials, animal print furniture, rugs and wallpaper. In 2005 Architectural Digest released a list of luxurious safari camps. Newland, Tarlton &amp; Co. Furniture Collection, creates luxury safari-style furniture in featured safari camps, hotels and private homes. Safari fashion also extends to fragrance collections by American designer Ralph Lauren; The Safari fragrance created in 1990 was advertised as &quot;a floral aroma with a light breeze scented by grasses, freedom, and the romance of vast open spaces.&quot;

<text>In astronomy, a contact binary is a binary star system whose component stars are so close that they touch each other or have merged to share their gaseous envelopes. A binary system whose stars share an envelope may also be called an overcontact binary. The term &quot;contact binary&quot; was introduced by astronomer Gerard Kuiper in 1941. Almost all known contact binary systems are eclipsing binaries; eclipsing contact binaries are known as W Ursae Majoris variables, after their archetype star, W Ursae Majoris.

In a contact binary, both stars have filled their Roche lobes, allowing the more massive primary component to transfer both mass and luminosity to the secondary member. As a result, the components in a contact binary often have similar effective temperatures and luminosities, regardless of their respective masses. The rate of energy transfer between the components is dependent on their mass ratio and luminosity ratio. In cases where the stars are in geometric contact but the thermal contact is poor, there can exist wide differences between their respective temperatures.

Contact binaries are not to be confused with common envelopes. Whereas the configuration of two touching stars in a contact binary has a typical lifetime of millions to billions of years, the common envelope is a dynamically unstable phase in binary evolution that either expels the stellar envelope or merges the binary in a timescale of months to years.

<doc id="185176" wikidata="Q335106" url="?curid=185176" title="George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle">
<text>George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle (6 December 1608 – 3 January 1670) was an English soldier, who fought on both sides during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and was a prominent military figure under the Commonwealth. His support was crucial to the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, who rewarded him with the title Duke of Albemarle and other senior positions.

The younger son of an impoverished Devon landowner, Monck began his military career in 1625 and served in the Eighty Years&#x27; War until 1638, when he returned to England. Posted to Ireland as part of the army sent to suppress the Irish Rebellion of 1641, he quickly gained a reputation for efficiency and ruthlessness. After Charles I agreed to a truce with the Catholic Confederacy in September 1643, he was captured fighting for the Royalists at Nantwich in January 1644 and remained a prisoner for the next two years.

Released in 1647, he was named Parliamentarian commander in Eastern Ulster, fought in Scotland under Oliver Cromwell in the 1650 to 1652 Anglo-Scottish War, and served as General at sea during the 1652 to 1654 First Anglo-Dutch War. From 1655 to 1660, he was army commander in Scotland, and his support for moderates in Parliament who wanted to restore the monarchy proved decisive in Charles II regaining his throne in May 1660.

Due to a combination of illness and lack of interest in politics, Monck faded into the background after 1660, but he returned to sea during the Second Anglo-Dutch War and played an important leadership role during the 1665 Great Plague of London, as well as the Great Fire of London in 1666. He lived in retirement for the last three years of his life and died in January 1670.

==Personal details==

Monck was born on 6 December 1608 on the family estate of Potheridge in Devon, second son of Sir Thomas Monck (1570–1627) and Elizabeth Smith, daughter of Sir George Smith, three times Mayor of Exeter and reputed to be the richest man in Exeter. His siblings included a younger brother, Nicholas Monck (1609–1661) – who became Bishop of Hereford and Provost of Eton College – and an elder, Thomas (died 1647).

One of the oldest families in Devon, the Moncks were relatively poor while Smith allegedly failed to pay the dowry promised for his daughter, leading to a series of expensive legal disputes with his son-in-law. In 1625, Sir Thomas was imprisoned for debt and died in jail two years later.

In January 1653, Monck married Anne Clarges (1619–1670), daughter of a London farrier and widow of Thomas Radford; his death was not legally confirmed until a year after their marriage, a fact which was later used against her. Her brother Thomas (1618–1695) was a committed Royalist who was knighted after the Stuart Restoration and had a long career in Parliament. They had one son who survived into adulthood, Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle (1653–1688).

==Early career, pre-1641==
Monck became a professional soldier, a common career choice for younger sons of impoverished gentry. His first experience was the failed attack on Cádiz in November 1625, when he served as an ensign in a company commanded by his cousin Sir Richard Grenville. He later joined the equally disastrous expedition against St Martin-de-Ré in July 1627; it is suggested one reason for doing so was his arrest for attempted murder in late 1626, when he and his brother Thomas assaulted Nicholas Battyn, the undersheriff responsible for jailing their father.

He spent most of the next decade serving in the Dutch States Army, which was then considered the best place to learn the &#x27;art of war&#x27; due to its success in the Eighty Years&#x27; War against Spain. Many officers who later fought on both sides during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms did the same, among them Sir Thomas Fairfax and Sir Philip Skippon. During the capture of Maastricht in 1632, he served in a regiment commanded by the Earl of Oxford, who was killed in the final assault and replaced by George Goring. By 1637, Monck was lieutenant colonel under Goring and played a decisive role in storming Breda, a Dutch success which was one of the last major actions of the war. After quarrelling with the civil authorities of Dordrecht, he surrendered his commission and returned to England in 1638.

During the 1639 and 1640 Bishops&#x27; Wars, he was lieutenant colonel in a regiment raised by Mountjoy Blount, 1st Earl of Newport, who was also Master-General of the Ordnance. Monck was one of the few to emerge with any credit from the Battle of Newburn in 1640, when he saved the English artillery from capture. Lack of money meant the army was dissolved. Monck spent the next year unemployed.

==Ireland and England, 1641–1646==
Following the Irish Rebellion of 1641, Parliament approved the recruitment of a Royal Army to suppress it. Monck was made colonel of a regiment raised by his distant relative Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester, which landed in Dublin in January 1642 and served under the Earl of Ormond. Over the next eighteen months, he campaigned against rebel strongholds in Leinster, during which he was responsible for several alleged massacres in County Kildare and also took part in the March 1643 Battle of New Ross. However, the outbreak of the First English Civil War in August 1642 meant Ormonde could no longer receive reinforcements or money from England, and by mid-1643, the Catholic Confederacy controlled most of Ireland, with the exception of Ulster, Dublin and Cork City.

Most of Ormond&#x27;s officers, including Monck, argued the Irish Army should remain neutral between Parliamentarians and Royalists but Charles was anxious to use these troops to help him win the war in England and in September 1643, Ormonde agreed a truce or &quot;Cessation&quot; with the Confederacy. Factions on both sides objected to the terms, which included negotiations on freedom of worship for Catholics and constitutional reforms. Protestants saw this as a threat, while many Confederates felt they were on the verge of victory and gained nothing from the truce; they were also well aware any concessions Charles made to Catholics in Ireland undermined his position in England and Scotland.

Monck was among those who refused to swear allegiance to the king and was sent by Ormonde as a prisoner to Bristol, where he eventually agreed to support the Royalists before being captured at Nantwich in January 1644. Although prisoners were commonly exchanged, his experience and ability were so highly regarded that he remained in custody for the next two years, during which he wrote a military manual entitled &quot;Observations on Military and Political Affairs&quot;. Following Charles&#x27;s surrender in May 1646, he accepted an appointment in one of the regiments sent to Ireland by Parliament as reinforcements; in September 1647, he was appointed Parliamentarian commander in Eastern Ulster.

==The Interregnum==

Monck proved his loyalty to Parliament by refusing to take part in the Second English Civil War and requiring all his officers to sign a declaration of support. However, his position in Ulster became extremely precarious following the execution of Charles I in January 1649, since it was dominated by Scots Presbyterian settlers, supported by a Covenanter army under Robert Monro. The Scots did not only object to the English killing their king without consultation. As Calvinists, they viewed monarchy as divinely ordained, making the execution sacrilegious. As a result, they defected to the Royalist–Confederate alliance led by Ormond and in desperation, Monck agreed to a secret truce with Eoghan Ó Néill, the Catholic leader in Ulster, which he did not communicate to Parliament until May.

Recalled to London, he was reprimanded by a Parliamentary committee, although they privately recognised the desperate circumstances which made it necessary. Although some mistrusted Monck as a former Royalist, Oliver Cromwell gave him command of a regiment in the 1650 to 1651 Anglo-Scottish War, which fought at Dunbar, then stormed Dundee, an action in which 800 civilians were allegedly killed. Throughout the Protectorate, Monck remained loyal to Cromwell, who appointed him military commander in Scotland until February 1652. At that time, Monck became seriously ill and retired to Bath in order to recover. Due to his expertise in utilising artillery, when the First Anglo-Dutch War began in November, Monck was made a General at Sea, along with Robert Blake and Richard Deane. He fought in the 1653 naval battles of Portland, the Gabbard and Scheveningen.

In April 1653, Cromwell dissolved the Rump Parliament and in June Monck was nominated MP for Devon in Barebone&#x27;s Parliament. Although the Dutch war did not formally end until the February 1654 Treaty of Westminster, Monck was recalled and sent to Scotland to suppress the Royalist Glencairn&#x27;s rising. Appointed military commander, he employed the ruthless tactics demonstrated in his previous assignments and by the end of 1655 the country had been pacified. He retained this position for the next five years, demonstrating his loyalty by removing any officers who expressed opposition to government policy and arresting religious dissidents.

==The Restoration==
When Oliver Cromwell died in September 1658, Monck transferred his support to his son Richard, who was appointed Lord Protector. The Third Protectorate Parliament elected in January 1659 was dominated by moderate Presbyterians like Monck and Royalist sympathisers, whose main objective was to reduce the power and expense of the military. In April, army radicals led by John Lambert and Charles Fleetwood dissolved Parliament and forced the resignation of Richard Cromwell. Sometimes known as the Wallingford House party, the new regime abolished the Protectorate, reseated the Rump Parliament dismissed by Cromwell in 1653 and began removing officers and officials of suspect loyalty, including many of those serving in Scotland.

Monck was left in place largely because rumours of another Royalist rising made it preferable to retain him. Both his cousin John Grenville and brother Nicholas were connected with the Royalist underground and in July 1659, Nicholas brought him a personal appeal from Charles II, asking for his help and offering up to £100,000 per year for his assistance. When Booth&#x27;s Uprising broke out in August 1659, Monck considered joining it but the revolt collapsed before he had time to commit himself. In October, the Wallingford House group dismissed the Rump before being forced to reinstate it in early December.

By the end of 1659, England appeared to be drifting into anarchy, with widespread demands for new elections and an end to military rule. Monck declared his support for the Rump against the Republican faction led by Lambert, while co-ordinating with Sir Theophilus Jones, a former colleague in Ireland who seized Dublin Castle in late December. At the same time, he marched his army to the English border, supported by a force raised by former New Model Army commander Sir Thomas Fairfax. Outnumbered and unpaid, Lambert&#x27;s troops melted away; on 2 February Monck entered London and in April elections were held for a Convention Parliament.

While his backing was essential to the Restoration, modern historians question whether the policy was initiated by Monck as opposed to following majority opinion, which by now was overwhelmingly in favour of reinstating the monarchy. Although he was elected MP for Devon, observers noted that he had little interest in politics, while his lack of a regional power base in England and the proposed reduction of the army worked against his future influence.

Nevertheless, the Declaration of Breda issued by Charles on 4 April 1660 was largely based on Monck&#x27;s recommendations. It promised a general pardon for actions committed during the civil wars and Interregnum, with the exception of the regicides, retention by the current owners of property purchased during the same period, religious toleration and payment of arrears to the army. Based on these terms, Parliament resolved to proclaim Charles king and invited him to return to England; he left Holland on 24 May and entered London five days later.

==Later career and death==
In July 1660, Monck was made Duke of Albemarle and appointed to the Privy Council; he also received the former Palace of Beaulieu, lands in Ireland and England worth £7,000 per year, an annual pension of £700 and various offices, including Lord Lieutenant of Devon. He also obtained significant positions for his dependents and connections; John Grenville became Earl of Bath, while Nicholas Monck was appointed Bishop of Hereford, his cousin William Morice Secretary of State for the Northern Department and his brother-in-law Thomas Commissary General of Musters.

Although appointed Lord Deputy of Ireland, Monck fell seriously ill once again in August 1661 and was replaced by Ormond, being &quot;compensated&quot; with the additional office of Lord Lieutenant of Middlesex. Thereafter he avoided front-line politics and focused on maximising his personal wealth; his wife was notorious for selling offices, although this was a common practice and probably reflected resentment at her humble origins. In his diary, Samuel Pepys attacks her as a &quot;homely, plain dowd&quot; and &quot;filthy woman&quot;; however, his views were coloured by the rivalry between Monck and his own cousin Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich, for control of the Admiralty.

In 1663, Monck was allocated lands in the Province of Carolina, now the modern US states of South and North Carolina, whose Albemarle Sound is named after him. He was also made a shareholder in the Royal African Company, established to challenge Dutch control of the Atlantic slave trade and a major factor in the commercial tensions between the two countries that eventually led to the Second Anglo-Dutch War in 1665. The conflict was backed by Monck and other investors within the government, including George Carteret, Shaftesbury and Arlington.

Command of the fleet was given to James, Duke of York, with Sandwich as his deputy and Monck took over his administrative duties at the Admiralty. He also gained a great deal of popularity for remaining in London throughout the 1665 Great Plague when most of the government fled to Oxford. Monck and Prince Rupert shared command during the 1666 campaign; the Four Days&#x27; Battle in June was a Dutch victory, offset by English success at the St. James&#x27;s Day Battle in July. In September he was recalled to help maintain order in the chaos created by the Great Fire of London.

This was his last active command; the fleet had to be laid up due to lack of money, culminating in the humiliating raid on the Medway in June 1667 which ended the war. One of the few to escape censure by Parliament, Monck was appointed First Lord of the Treasury but he was now suffering from severe edema which limited his ability to attend meetings. He died on 3 January 1670, followed three weeks later by his wife, and was buried in Westminster Abbey. Some years later, a monument by William Kent and Peter Scheemakers was erected in the Abbey in Monck&#x27;s honour. The ballad &quot;On the Death of His Grace, the Duke of Albemarle&quot; was composed in his honour.

<text>Donald Arthur Norman (born December 25, 1935) is an American researcher, professor, and author. Norman is the director of The Design Lab at University of California, San Diego. He is best known for his books on design, especially &quot;The Design of Everyday Things&quot;. He is widely regarded for his expertise in the fields of design, usability engineering, and cognitive science, and has shaped the development of the field of cognitive systems engineering. He is a co-founder of the Nielsen Norman Group, along with Jakob Nielsen. He is also an IDEO fellow and a member of the Board of Trustees of IIT Institute of Design in Chicago. He also holds the title of Professor Emeritus of Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego. Norman is an active Distinguished Visiting Professor at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), where he spends two months a year teaching.

Much of Norman&#x27;s work involves the advocacy of user-centered design. His books all have the underlying purpose of furthering the field of design, from doors to computers. Norman has taken a controversial stance in saying that the design research community has had little impact in the innovation of products, and that while academics can help in refining existing products, it is technologists that accomplish the breakthroughs. To this end, Norman named his website with the initialism &quot;JND&quot; (just-noticeable difference) to signify his endeavors to make a difference.

== Early academics ==
In 1957, Norman received a B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Norman received an M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Pennsylvania. He received a PhD in psychology from the University of Pennsylvania. He was one of the earliest graduates from the Mathematical Psychology group at University of Pennsylvania and his advisor was Duncan Luce.

After graduating, Norman took up a postdoctoral fellowship at the Center for Cognitive Studies at Harvard University and within a year became a lecturer.

After four years with the Center, Norman took a position as an associate professor in the Psychology Department at University of California, San Diego (UCSD). Norman applied his training as an engineer and computer scientist, and as an experimental and mathematical psychologist, to the emerging discipline of cognitive science. Norman eventually became founding chair of the Department of Cognitive Science and chair of the Department of Psychology.

At UCSD, Norman was a founder of the Institute for Cognitive Science and one of the organizers of the Cognitive Science Society (along with Roger Schank, Allan Collins, and others), which held its first meeting at the UCSD campus in 1979.

Together with psychologist Tim Shallice, Norman proposed a framework of attentional control of executive functioning. One of the components of the Norman-Shallice model is the supervisory attentional system.

== Cognitive engineering career ==
Norman made the transition from cognitive science to cognitive engineering by entering the field as a consultant and writer. His article &quot;The truth about Unix: &quot;The user interface is horrid&quot;&quot; in &quot;Datamation&quot; (1981) catapulted him to a position of prominence in the computer world. Soon after, his career took off outside of academia, although he still remained active at UCSD until 1993. Norman continued his work to further human-centered design by serving on numerous university and government advisory boards such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). He currently serves on numerous committees and advisory boards like at Motorola, the Toyota National College of Technology, TED Conference, Panasonic, &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; and many more.

Norman was also part of a select team flown in to investigate the 1979 Three Mile Island nuclear accident.

In 1993, Norman left UCSD to join Apple Computer, initially as an Apple Fellow as a User Experience Architect (the first use of the phrase &quot;User Experience&quot; in a job title), and then as the Vice President of the Advanced Technology Group. He later worked for Hewlett-Packard before joining with Jakob Nielsen to form the Nielsen Norman Group in 1998. He returned to academia as a professor of computer science at Northwestern University, where he was co-director of the Segal Design Institute until 2010. In 2014, he returned to UCSD to become director of the newly established The Design Lab housed at the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology.

== Awards and honors ==
Norman has received many awards for his work. He received two honorary degrees, one &quot;S. V. della laurea ad honorem&quot; in Psychology from the University of Padua in 1995 and one doctorate in Industrial Design and Engineering from Delft University of Technology. In 2001, he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and won the Rigo Award from SIGDOC, the Association for Computing Machinery&#x27;s Special Interest Group (SIG) on the Design of Communication (DOC). In 2006, he received the Benjamin Franklin Medal in Computer and Cognitive Science. In 2009, Norman was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Design Research Society. In 2011 Norman was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering for the development of design principles based on human cognition that enhance the interaction between people and technology.

== Nielsen Norman Group ==

Norman, alongside colleague Jakob Nielsen, formed the Nielsen Norman Group (NN/g) in 1998. The company&#x27;s vision is to help designers and other companies move toward more human-centered products and internet interactions, and are pioneers in the field of user experience design.

== User-centered design ==
In 1986, Norman introduced the term &quot;user-centered design&quot; in the book &quot;User Centered System Design: New Perspectives on Human-computer Interaction&quot;&quot;,&quot; a book edited by him and by Stephen W. Draper. In the introduction of the book, the idea that designers should aim their efforts at the people who will use the system is introduced:People are so adaptable that they are capable of shouldering the entire burden of accommodation to an artifact, but skillful designers make large parts of this burden vanish by adapting the artifact to the users.In his book &quot;The Design of Everyday Things&quot;, Norman uses the term &quot;user-centered design&quot; to describe design based on the needs of the user, leaving aside what he deems secondary considerations, such as aesthetics. User-centered design involves simplifying the structure of tasks, making things visible, getting the mapping right, exploiting the powers of constraint, designing for error, explaining affordances and the seven stages of action. The principles and characteristics outlined in the book are relatable to the field of product design, both in a physical and a digital context.

In his book &quot;The Things that Make Us Smart: Defending the Human Attribute in the Age of the Machine&quot;, Norman uses the term &quot;cognitive artifacts&quot; to describe &quot;those artificial devices that maintain, display, or operate upon information in order to serve a representational function and that affect human cognitive performance&quot;. Similar to his &quot;The Design of Everyday Things&quot; book, Norman argues for the development of machines that fit our minds, rather than have our minds be conformed to the machine.

On the Revised Edition of &quot;The Design of Everyday Things,&quot; Norman backtracks on his previous claims about aesthetics and removed the term User-Centered Design altogether. In the preface of the book, he says :The first edition of the book focused upon making products understandable and usable. The total experience of a product covers much more than its usability: aesthetics, pleasure, and fun play critically important roles. There was no discussion of pleasure, enjoyment and emotion, Emotion is so important that I wrote an entire book, Emotional Design, about the role it plays in design.He instead currently uses the term human-centered design and defines it as: &quot;an approach that puts human needs, capabilities, and behavior first, then designs to accommodate those needs, capabilities, and ways of behaving.&quot;

== Don Norman Design Award ==
The Don Norman Design Award organization was instituted and the inaugural awards bearing his name were announced on September 13, 2024. The DNDA Summit will be held on November 14 and 15, 2024 in San Diego, California.

== Bibliography ==
He is on numerous educational, private, and public sector advisory boards, including the editorial board of &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. Norman published several important books during his time at UCSD, one of which, &quot;User Centered System Design&quot;, obliquely referred to the university in the initials of its title. This is a list of select publications.
