<text>Stephen Lawrence Winwood (born 12 May 1948) is an English musician and songwriter whose genres include blue-eyed soul, rhythm and blues, blues rock, and pop rock. Though primarily a guitarist, keyboard player, and vocalist prominent for his distinctive soulful high tenor voice, Winwood plays other instruments proficiently, including drums, mandolin, bass, and saxophone.

Winwood achieved fame during the 1960s and 1970s as an integral member of three major bands: the Spencer Davis Group (1964–1967), Traffic (1967–1969 and 1970–1974), and Blind Faith (1969). During the 1980s, his solo career flourished and he had a number of hit singles, including &quot;While You See a Chance&quot; (1980) from the album &quot;Arc of a Diver&quot; and &quot;Valerie&quot; (1982) from &quot;Talking Back to the Night&quot; (&quot;Valerie&quot; became a hit when it was re-released with a remix from Winwood&#x27;s 1987 compilation album &quot;Chronicles&quot;). His 1986 album &quot;Back in the High Life&quot; marked his career zenith, with hit singles including &quot;Back in the High Life Again&quot;, &quot;The Finer Things&quot;, and the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number one hit &quot;Higher Love&quot;. He found the top of the Hot 100 again with &quot;Roll with It&quot; (1988) from the album &quot;Roll with It&quot;, with &quot;Don&#x27;t You Know What the Night Can Do?&quot; and &quot;Holding On&quot; also charting highly the same year. Although his hit singles ceased after the 1980s, he continued to release new albums up to 2008, when &quot;Nine Lives&quot;, his latest album, was released.

In 2004, Winwood was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Traffic. He has won two Grammy Awards and an Ivor Novello Award, and has been honored as a BMI Icon. In 2008, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Winwood number 33 on its list of 100 Greatest Singers of All Time.

==Early life==
Winwood was born on 12 May 1948 in Handsworth, Birmingham. His father Lawrence, a foundryman by trade, was a semi-professional musician, playing mainly the saxophone and clarinet. Steve Winwood began playing piano at the age of four while interested in swing and Dixieland jazz, and soon started playing drums and guitar. He was also a choirboy at St. John&#x27;s Church of England, Perry Barr. The family moved from Handsworth to Atlantic Road, Kingstanding Birmingham, where Winwood attended the Great Barr School, one of the first comprehensive schools. He also attended the Birmingham and Midland Institute of Music to develop his skills as a pianist, but did not complete his course. During this time, he befriended future Fleetwood Mac member Christine McVie.

At eight years of age, Winwood first performed with his father and elder brother Muff in the Ron Atkinson band. Muff Winwood later recalled that when Steve began playing regularly with him and his father in licensed pubs and clubs, the piano had to be turned with its back to the audience to try to hide him because he was so obviously underage.

==Career==
===Early years===
While still a pupil at Great Barr School, Winwood was a part of the Birmingham blues rock scene, playing the Hammond C-3 organ and guitar, backing blues and rock legends such as Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Howlin&#x27; Wolf, B. B. King, Chuck Berry, and Bo Diddley on their United Kingdom tours, the custom at that time being for US singers to travel solo and be backed by pick-up bands. At this time, Winwood was living on Atlantic Road in Great Barr, close to the Birmingham music halls where he played. Winwood modelled his singing after Ray Charles.

=== The Spencer Davis Group ===
In 1963, Winwood (then known as &quot;Stevie&quot; Winwood) became singer and keyboardist of the Spencer Davis Group, with his older brother Muff Winwood on bass, Spencer Davis on guitar, and Pete York on drums. Davis had been impressed by the Winwood brothers after he saw them performing as the Muffy Wood Jazz Band at the Golden Eagle in Birmingham. The Spencer Davis Group made their debut at the Eagle and subsequently had a Monday-night residency there. Winwood&#x27;s distinctive high tenor singing voice and vocal style drew comparisons to Ray Charles.

In 1964, the Spencer Davis Group signed their first recording contract with Island Records. Producer and founder Chris Blackwell later said of Winwood, &quot;He was really the cornerstone of Island Records. He&#x27;s a musical genius and because he was with Island all the other talent really wanted to be with Island.&quot; The group&#x27;s first single &quot;Dimples&quot; was released 10 days after Winwood&#x27;s 16th birthday. The group had two UK No. 1 singles in late 1965 and early 1966 with &quot;Keep on Running&quot; and &quot;Somebody Help Me&quot;; the money from this success allowed Winwood to buy his own Hammond organ. Winwood co-wrote the band&#x27;s breakthrough hits in America, &quot;Gimme Some Lovin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m a Man&quot;, both of which went Top 10 in the US and UK in late 1966 and early 1967. Winwood left the Spencer Davis Group in April 1967.

===Traffic and Blind Faith===

Winwood met drummer Jim Capaldi, guitarist Dave Mason, and multi-instrumentalist Chris Wood when they jammed together at The Elbow Room, a club in Aston, Birmingham. After Winwood left the Spencer Davis Group in April 1967, the quartet formed Traffic. Soon thereafter, they rented a cottage near the rural village of Aston Tirrold, Berkshire (now Oxfordshire), to write and rehearse new music. This allowed them to escape the city and develop their music.

Early in Traffic&#x27;s formation, Winwood and Capaldi formed a songwriting partnership, with Winwood writing music to match Capaldi&#x27;s lyrics. This partnership was the source of most of Traffic&#x27;s material, including popular songs such as &quot;Paper Sun&quot;, &quot;No Face, No Name, No Number&quot;, &quot;Dear Mr. Fantasy&quot;, and &quot;The Low Spark of High-Heeled Boys&quot;, and outlived the band, producing several songs for Winwood&#x27;s and Capaldi&#x27;s solo albums. Over the band&#x27;s history, Winwood performed the majority of their lead vocals, keyboard instruments, and guitars (the latter more so after Mason&#x27;s departure in 1968). Traffic disbanded in early 1969 after two albums, &quot;Mr. Fantasy&quot; (1967) and &quot;Traffic&quot; (1968), with a third album, &quot;Last Exit&quot;, being issued later that year.
Following Traffic&#x27;s split, Winwood formed the supergroup Blind Faith, along with former Cream members Eric Clapton (guitar) and Ginger Baker (drums), and former Family member Ric Grech (bass). The band produced only one album, which reached No. 1 in both the UK and US, and included &quot;Can&#x27;t Find My Way Home&quot;. The band was short-lived owing to Clapton&#x27;s greater interest in Blind Faith&#x27;s opening act on tour, Delaney &amp; Bonnie &amp; Friends; Clapton left the band at the tour&#x27;s completion, bringing Blind Faith to an end.
In 1970, Winwood went into the studio to begin work on a solo album, tentatively titled &quot;Mad Shadows&quot;. However, Winwood ended up calling in his former Traffic bandmates Jim Capaldi and Chris Wood to help, with the recording resulting in a Traffic reunion album &quot;John Barleycorn Must Die&quot;. Traffic would continue for another five albums, &quot;Welcome to the Canteen&quot; (1971), &quot;The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys&quot; (1971), &quot;Shoot Out at the Fantasy Factory&quot; (1973), &quot;On the Road&quot; (1973) and &quot;When the Eagle Flies&quot; (1974). Weariness with the grind of touring and recording prompted Winwood to break up Traffic in 1974 and retire to session work for several years.

===Other 1960s and 1970s work===
In 1966, three years before Blind Faith, Winwood guested with Eric Clapton as part of the temporary group Eric Clapton and the Powerhouse. Three tracks were recorded and released on the 1966 various artists compilation album, &quot;What&#x27;s Shakin&#x27;&quot;. In 1968, Winwood was recruited by Jimi Hendrix to play organ for &quot;Voodoo Chile&quot; on the &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot; album.

Following the end of Blind Faith, Winwood and Ric Grech continued working with Ginger Baker, as part of Ginger Baker&#x27;s Air Force, who also featured Winwood&#x27;s Traffic bandmate Chris Wood. Winwood played on their self-titled first album, released in 1970.

In 1972, Winwood recorded the part of Captain Walker in the highly successful orchestral version of the Who&#x27;s &quot;Tommy&quot;. He recorded a 1973 album with Remi Kabaka and Abdul Lasisi Amao, as Third World, &quot;Aiye-Keta&quot;. Later, after the unrelated reggae group Third World had formed, the album was re-released and identified by the band members&#x27; names. In 1976, Winwood provided vocals and keyboards on &quot;Go&quot;, a concept album by Japanese composer Stomu Yamashta. That same year, Winwood also played guitar on the Fania All Stars&#x27; &quot;Delicate and Jumpy&quot; record and performed as a guest with the band in their only UK appearance, a sold-out concert at the Lyceum Theatre, London.

Under pressure from Island Records, Winwood released his self-titled first solo album in 1977. In 1979 he played keyboards on the Marianne Faithfull album &quot;Broken English,&quot; including synthesizer on the tracks &quot;The Ballad of Lucy Jordan&quot; and &quot;Broken English&quot; which were taken as singles from the album.

===Solo career success===
In 1980, Winwood released his second solo album &quot;Arc of a Diver&quot;, which included his first solo hit, &quot;While You See a Chance&quot;. This was followed by &quot;Talking Back to the Night&quot; in 1982, which featured the song &quot;Valerie&quot;, which would eventually become a hit single upon re-release in 1987. Both &quot;Arc of a Diver&quot; and &quot;Talking Back to the Night&quot; were recorded at his home in Gloucestershire with Winwood playing all instruments.

In 1986, Winwood travelled to New York City for his next album project. There, he enlisted the help of a coterie of stars to record &quot;Back in the High Life&quot;. The album went triple platinum in the US, with its first single &quot;Higher Love&quot; reaching number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and earning Winwood Grammy Awards for Record of the Year and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance. He embarked on an extensive tour of North America in support of the album, and at the end of the tour, he divorced Nicole Weir in England then settled in the Nashville area with his new American wife, Eugenia Crafton.

With the exception of 1969&#x27;s &quot;Blind Faith&quot;, Winwood had been with Island Records since the Spencer Davis Group&#x27;s first single in 1964. However, at the peak of his commercial success, Winwood moved to Virgin Records and released the albums &quot;Roll with It&quot; (1988) and &quot;Refugees of the Heart&quot; (1990). &quot;Roll with It&quot; and its title track hit No. 1 on the US album and singles charts in the summer of 1988.

===Traffic reunion and subsequent work===

In 1994, Winwood and Jim Capaldi reformed as Traffic for the album &quot;Far from Home&quot;. Despite lacking a significant hit, it broke the top 40 in both the UK and US. The band toured that year, which included a performance at the Woodstock &#x27;94 Festival. That same year, Winwood appeared on the &quot;A Tribute To Curtis Mayfield&quot; CD, recording Mayfield&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s All Right&quot;.

In 1995, Winwood released &quot;Reach for the Light&quot; for the animated film &quot;Balto&quot;. Winwood&#x27;s final Virgin album, &quot;Junction Seven&quot;, was released in 1997, reaching the UK top 40. Later that year, he toured the US, and sang with Chaka Khan at the VH-1 Honors.

In 1998, Winwood joined Tito Puente, Arturo Sandoval, Ed Calle, and other musicians to form the band &quot;Latin Crossings&quot; for a European tour, after which they split without making any recordings. Winwood also appeared in the film &quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot;, as a member of the Louisiana Gator Boys, appearing on stage with Isaac Hayes, Eric Clapton, and KoKo Taylor at the battle of the bands competition.

In 2003, Winwood released a new studio album, &quot;About Time&quot;, on his new record label, Wincraft Music. In 2004, Eric Prydz sampled Winwood&#x27;s 1982 song &quot;Valerie&quot; for the song &quot;Call on Me&quot;. After hearing an early version, Winwood not only gave permission to use his song, he re-recorded the samples for Prydz to use. The remix spent five weeks at No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart.

In 2005, Winwood&#x27;s Soundstage Performances DVD was released. That same year, he appeared on Grammy Award winner Ashley Cleveland&#x27;s album &quot;Men and Angels Say&quot;, a mix of rock, blues, and country arrangements of well-known hymns, including &quot;I Need Thee Every Hour&quot;, which featured a vocal duet and organ performance. On her 2006 record &quot;Back to Basics&quot;, Christina Aguilera featured Winwood (using the piano and organ instrumentation from the &quot;John Barleycorn Must Die&quot; track &quot;Glad&quot;) on her song &quot;Makes Me Wanna Pray&quot;.

In May 2007, Winwood performed in support of the Countryside Alliance, an organisation opposed to the Hunting Act 2004, in a concert at Highclere Castle, joining fellow rock artists Eric Clapton, Bryan Ferry, Steve Harley, and Kenney Jones. In July 2007, Winwood performed with Clapton in the latter&#x27;s Crossroads Guitar Festival. Among the songs they played were &quot;Presence of the Lord&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Find My Way Home&quot; from their Blind Faith days, with Winwood playing several guitar leads during a six-song set. The two continued their collaboration with three sold-out nights at Madison Square Garden in New York City in February 2008.

 Winwood&#x27;s next studio album &quot;Nine Lives&quot; was released in 2008. &quot;Nine Lives&quot; opened at No. 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, his highest US debut ever. On 19 February 2008, Winwood and Clapton released a collaborative EP through iTunes titled &quot;Dirty City&quot;. Clapton and Winwood released a CD and DVD of their Madison Square Garden shows and then toured together in the summer of 2009.

In 2008, Winwood was awarded an honorary doctorate from the Berklee College of Music to add to his honorary degree from Aston University, Birmingham.

== Songwriting ==
Winwood has spoken very little publicly about the origin or meaning of the songs he has written. He has said that &quot;when I write a song, I don&#x27;t like to have to explain it afterwards. To me, it&#x27;s like telling a joke, then having to explain it. The explanation doesn&#x27;t add to the song at all.&quot;
== Legacy ==
Winwood was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Traffic in 2004. In 2005, Winwood was honoured as a BMI Icon at the annual BMI London Awards for his &quot;enduring influence on generations of music makers.&quot; In 2008, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Winwood No. 33 on its list of 100 Greatest Singers of All Time. Winwood has won two Grammy Awards. He was nominated twice for a Brit Award for Best British Male Artist: 1988 and 1989. In 2011, he received the Ivor Novello Award from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors for Outstanding Song Collection.

==Personal life==
Between 1978 and 1986, Winwood was married to Nicole Weir (d. 2005), who had contributed background vocals to some of his early solo work. The two married at Cheltenham Register Office.

Winwood&#x27;s primary residence is a 300-year-old manor house in the Cotswolds, England, where he also has a recording studio. Winwood also has a home in Nashville, Tennessee, with his wife, Eugenia Crafton, a Trenton, Tennessee native whom he married in 1987. They have four children.

In 2011, one of Winwood&#x27;s daughters, Mary Clare, married businessman Ben Elliot, later co-chairman of the Conservative Party between July 2019 and September 2022. The couple have two sons.

<text>Gottlieb Wilhelm Daimler (; 17 March 1834 – 6 March 1900) was a German engineer, industrial designer and industrialist born in Schorndorf (Kingdom of Württemberg, a federal state of the German Confederation), in what is now Germany. He was a pioneer of internal-combustion engines and automobile development. He invented the high-speed liquid petroleum-fueled engine.

Daimler and his lifelong business partner Wilhelm Maybach were two inventors whose goal was to create small, high-speed engines to be mounted in any kind of locomotion device. In 1883 they designed a horizontal cylinder layout compressed charge liquid petroleum engine that fulfilled Daimler&#x27;s desire for a high speed engine which could be throttled, making it useful in transportation applications. This engine was called Daimler&#x27;s Dream.

In 1885 they designed a vertical cylinder version of this engine which they subsequently fitted to a two-wheeler, the first internal combustion motorcycle which was named the Petroleum Reitwagen (Riding Car) and, in the next year, to a coach, and a boat. Daimler called this engine the grandfather clock engine (&quot;Standuhr&quot;) because of its resemblance to a large pendulum clock.

In 1890, they converted their partnership into a stock company Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG, in English – the Daimler Motors Corporation). They sold their first automobile in 1892. Daimler fell ill and took a break from the business. Upon his return he experienced difficulty with the other stockholders that led to his resignation in 1893. This was reversed in 1894. Maybach resigned at the same time, and also returned. Daimler died in 1900 and Wilhelm Maybach quit DMG in 1907.

Daimler is seen as &quot;the father of the motorcycle&quot;.

==Early life and education (1834–1862)==
Gottlieb Wilhelm Daimler was the son of a baker named Johannes Däumler (Daimler) and his wife Frederika, from the town of Schorndorf near Stuttgart, Württemberg. By the age of 13 (1847), he had completed six years of primary studies in Lateinschule and became interested in engineering.

After completing secondary school in 1848, Daimler had trained as a gunsmith under Master Gunsmith Hermann Raithel. In 1852 he ended the training with the trade examination. He graduated in 1852, passing the craft test with a pair of engraved double-barreled pistols. The same year, at eighteen, Daimler decided to take up mechanical engineering, abandoning gunsmithing, and left his hometown.

Daimler enrolled at Stuttgart&#x27;s School for Advanced Training in the Industrial Arts, under the tutelage of Ferdinand von Steinbeis. Daimler was studious, even taking extra Sunday morning classes. In 1853, Daimler, with Steinbeis&#x27; assistance, got work at &quot;the factory college&quot;, &quot;Rollé und Schwilque&quot; (R&amp;S) in Grafenstaden, so-called because its manager, Friedrich Messmer, had been an instructor at the University of Karlsruhe. Daimler performed well, and when Rollé und Schwilque began making railway locomotives in 1856, Daimler, then 22, was named foreman.

Instead of staying, Daimler took two years at Stuttgart&#x27;s Polytechnic Institute to hone his skills, gaining in-depth understanding of steam locomotives, as well as &quot;a profound conviction&quot; steam was destined to be superseded. He conceived small, cheap, simple engines for light industrial use, possibly inspired by the newly developed gas engines of that era.

In 1861, he resigned from R&amp;S, visiting Paris, then went on to England, working with the country&#x27;s top engineering firms, becoming knowledgeable with machine tools. He spent from autumn 1861 to summer 1863 in England, then regarded as &quot;the motherland of technology&quot;, at Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company, Manchester, whose partner Beyer was from Saxony. While in London, he visited the 1862 International Exhibition, where one of the exhibits was a steam carriage. These carriages did not evidently inspire him, however, for his wish was to improve machine tools for metal and woodworking machinery.

==Career through 1882==
Daimler went to work for Maschinenfabrik Daniel Straub, Geislingen an der Steige, where he designed tools, mills, and turbines. In 1863, he joined the &quot;Bruderhaus Reutlingen&quot;, a Christian Socialist toolmaker, as inspector and later executive. While there, he met Wilhelm Maybach, then a 15-year-old orphan. Thanks to Daimler&#x27;s organizational skills, the factory managed to show a profit, but he quit in frustration in 1869, joining Maschinenbau Gesellschaft Karlsruhe in July.

When in 1872 N.A. Otto and Cie reorganized as Gasmotoren-Fabrik Deutz, management picked Daimler as factory manager, bypassing even Otto, and Daimler joined the company in August, bringing in Maybach as chief designer. While Daimler managed to improve production, the weakness in Otto&#x27;s vertical piston design, coupled to Daimler&#x27;s stubborn insistence on atmospheric engines, led the company to an impasse. Neither Otto nor Daimler would give way, and when Daimler was offered the choice of founding a Deutz branch in Saint Petersburg or resigning, he resigned to set up shop in Cannstatt (financed by savings and shares in Deutz), where he was shortly joined by Maybach.

==Otto four-stroke engine (1876)==
In 1872 at age 38, Daimler and Maybach moved to work at the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of stationary engines at the time, the Deutz-AG-Gasmotorenfabrik in Cologne. It was half-owned by Nicolaus Otto, who was looking for a new technical director. As directors, both Daimler and Otto focused on gas-engine development while Maybach was chief designer.

In 1876, Otto developed a gaseous fuel, compressed charge four-stroke cycle, (also known as the Otto Cycle) engine after 14 years of effort, a system characterized by four piston strokes (intake, compression, power, and exhaust). Otto intended that his invention would replace the steam engines predominant in those years, even though his engine was still primitive and inefficient.

Otto&#x27;s engine was patented in 1877, but one of his 25 patents was soon challenged and overturned. Daimler, who wanted to make his own engine, feared Otto&#x27;s patent would prevent it. Daimler hired an attorney who found that a prior art patent for a four stroke engine had been issued in Paris in 1862 to Beau De Rochas, a French public works engineer.

Meanwhile, serious personal differences arose between Daimler and Otto, reportedly with Otto being jealous of Daimler, because of his university background and knowledge. Daimler wanted to build small engines that could be applied to transportation but Otto had no interest in this. When Otto excluded Daimler from his engine patents there was great animosity between the two. Daimler was fired in 1880, receiving 112,000 Gold marks in Deutz-AG shares in compensation for the patents of both Daimler and Maybach. Maybach resigned later and followed Daimler.

==Independent inventor of small, high speed engines (1882)==


At Cannstatt, Daimler and the more creative thinking Maybach devised their engine. At Daimler&#x27;s insistence, it eliminated &quot;the clumsy, complicated slide-valve ignition&quot;, in favor of a hot tube system invented by an Englishman named Watson, since electrical systems functioned too slowly.

In the summer of 1882, Daimler moved to Cannstatt (just outside of Stuttgart at that time), purchasing a cottage in Cannstatt&#x27;s Taubenheimstrasse, with 75,000 Gold marks from the compensation from Deutz-AG. Maybach followed in September of that year. In the garden, they added a brick extension to the roomy glass-fronted summer house and this became their workshop. Their activities alarmed the neighbors who reported them to the police as suspected counterfeiters. The police obtained a key from the gardener and raided the house in their absence, but found only engines.

Daimler and Maybach spent long hours debating how best to fuel Otto&#x27;s four-stroke design, and turned to a commonly available petroleum fraction. The main distillates of petroleum at the time were lubricating oil, kerosene (burned as lamp fuel), and ligroin (petroleum naphtha or heavy naphtha), which up to then was used mainly as a cleaner and was sold in pharmacies. &quot; [i.e. ligroin and similar petroleum fractions] of a kind common and readily available at pharmacies (chemist&#x27;s) at the time&quot;, as described by antique car expert Michael Plag. &quot;This is a combustible fuel called &quot;n&quot;-hexane.&quot;

==Dream engine (1883)==

In late 1883, Daimler and Maybach patented the first of their engines fueled by ligroin. This engine was patented on 16 December 1883. It achieved Daimler&#x27;s goal of being small and running fast enough to be useful at 750 rpm. Improved designs in the next four years brought that up to 900 rpm. Daimler had three engines built to this design early in 1884, and a flywheel was included in one of the engines. This design was smaller and lighter than engines by other inventors of the time. Daimler relied on hot tube ignition, until 1897, when he adopted the electrical ignition designed by Bosch.

==Grandfather clock engine (1885)==
The engine with the flywheel included was built into a light vehicle, called the Reitwagen, the first vehicle powered by an internal combustion engine.

It took considerable effort and experimentation, but eventually, the duo perfected a vertical single, which was fitted in the &quot;Reitwagen&quot;, a purpose-built two-wheeler chassis with two spring-loaded stabilizers.

Features of the 1885 Engine included:
* a single horizontal cylinder of ()
* air cooling
* large cast iron flywheel
* surface carburetor
* hot tube ignition system (patent 28022)
* cam operated exhaust valves, allowing high speed operation
* 600 rpm running speed, beating previous engines, which typically ran at about 120 to 180 rpm
* weight of around 
* height of 

In 1885, they created a carburetor which mixed gasoline with air allowing its use as fuel. In the same year Daimler and Maybach assembled a larger version of their engine, still relatively compact, but now with a vertical cylinder of 100 cc displacement and an output of 1 hp at 600 rpm (patent DRP-28-022: &quot;non-cooled, heat insulated engine with unregulated hot-tube ignition&quot;). It was baptized the &quot;Standuhr&quot; (&quot;grandfather clock&quot;), because Daimler thought it resembled an old pendulum clock.

In November 1885, Daimler installed a smaller version of this engine in a wooden two wheeler frame with two outrigger wheels, creating the first internal combustion motorcycle (Patent 36-423impff &amp; Sohn &quot;Vehicle with gas or petroleum drive machine&quot;). It was named the &quot;Reitwagen&quot; (riding car). Maybach rode it for three kilometers (two miles) alongside the river Neckar, from Cannstatt to Untertürkheim, reaching .

==First automobile (1886)==
Independently of each other, Karl Benz and Gottlieb Daimler each produced an automobile in 1886, both in Germany, about 60 miles apart.
About sixty miles away in Mannheim, Karl Benz built an automobile using an integral design for a motorized vehicle with one of his own engines. He was granted a patent for his &quot;motorwagen&quot; on 29 January 1886.

When this proved the engine capable of driving a vehicle, Daimler devised a single and ordered a Wimpff und Söhne four-seater phaeton to house it. Daimler&#x27;s engine was installed by Maschinenfabrik Esslingen and drove the rear wheels through a dual-ratio belt drive.

On 8 March 1886, Daimler and Maybach secretly brought an American Model coach made by Wilhelm Wimpff and Sohn into the house, telling the neighbors it was a birthday gift for Mrs. Daimler. Maybach supervised the installation of a larger 1.1 hp () version of the Grandfather Clock engine into this stagecoach and it became the first four-wheeled vehicle to reach . The engine power was transmitted by a set of belts. As with the motorcycle, it was tested on the road to Untertürkheim where nowadays the MHPArena, formerly called the Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion, is situated.

Driven by Daimler&#x27;s desire to use the engine as many ways as possible, Daimler and Maybach used the engine in other types of transport including:
* on water (1886), by mounting it in a long boat and achieving a speed of . The boat was called &quot;Neckar&quot; after the river where it was tested. (patent DRP 39-367). This was the first motorboat and boat engines soon would become Daimler&#x27;s main product for several years. The first customers expressed fear the petrol engine could explode, so Daimler hid the engine with a ceramic cover and told them it was &quot;oil-electrical&quot;.
* street-cars and trolleys.
* in the air in Daimler&#x27;s balloon, usually regarded as the first airship, where it replaced a hand-operated engine designed by Dr. Friedrich Hermann Wölfert of Leipzig. With the new engine, Daimler successfully flew over Seelberg on 10 August 1888.

They sold their first foreign licenses for engines in 1887 and Maybach went as their representative to the 1889 Paris Exposition to show their achievements.

==First Daimler-Maybach automobile built (1889)==
Engine sales increased, mostly for use in boats, and in June 1887, Daimler bought another property at Seelberg hill, Cannstatt. It was located some distance from the town on Ludwigstraße 67 because Cannstatt&#x27;s mayor did not approve of the workshop. Built at a cost 30,200 goldmarks, the new premises had room for 23 employees. Daimler managed the commercial issues while Maybach ran the engine design department.

In 1889, Daimler and Maybach built the &quot;Stahlradwagen&quot;, their first automobile that did not involve adapting a horse-drawn carriage with their engine, but which was somewhat influenced by bicycle designs. There was no production in Germany, but it was licensed to be built in France and presented to the public in Paris in October 1889 by both engineers. The same year, Daimler&#x27;s wife, Emma Kunz, died.

==Daimler Motors, the &quot;Phönix&quot; engine, and the first motorcar sold (1890 to 1900)==
With demand for engines growing, for uses in everything from motorboats to railcars, Maybach and Daimler expanded. In 1890 Daimler founded his own engine business, Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG). With funding from gunpowder maker Max Duttenhofer, industrialist, and banker Kilian von Steiner, and munitions manufacturer :de:Wilhelm Lorenz, &quot;Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft&quot; was founded 28 November 1890, with Maybach as chief designer. Its purpose was the construction of small, high-speed engines for use on land, water, and air transport. The three uses were expressed by Daimler in a sketch that became the basis for a logo with a three-pointed star.

From 1882 until 1890, Daimler had resisted making his company into an incorporation or stock company. He had seen what happened to too many engineers who had pioneered a capital invention as he had. Many of them were forced out of their own companies by stock holders who &quot;knew better&quot; about how to run the company that they had just purchased than the man who founded the company. It happened to Henry Ford, Ransom Olds, Karl Benz, and August Horch.

Daimler hated having to incorporate his company. Unable to obtain majority control, he sold out and then resigned. DMG expanded, but it changed. The newcomers, not believing in automobile production, ordered the creation of additional stationary engine building capacity, and considered merging DMG with Otto&#x27;s &quot;Deutz-AG&quot;.

In 1892, DMG finally sold its first automobile. DMG developed the high-speed inline-two &quot;Phönix&quot;, for which Maybach invented a spray carburettor. This was fitted in a singularly ugly car, which entered production in 1895 after a cessation of hostilities between Daimler, Maybach, and the DMG board.

Gottlieb Daimler, aged 58, had heart problems and suffered a collapse in the winter of 1892–1893. His doctor prescribed a trip to Florence, where he met Lina Hartmann, a widow 22 years his junior who was the owner of the hotel where he was staying. They married on 8 July 1893, honeymooning in Chicago during its World Fair.

Returning from the 1893 World&#x27;s Fair in Chicago with his new wife, Daimler had vowed to purchase enough shares of DMG to regain control. This effort failed. Daimler sold all his shares and patents and resigned from the company. Maybach had left earlier.

The disputes with Lorenz continued. Daimler attempted to buy 102 extra shares to get a majority holding, but was forced out of his post as technical director. The corporation was 400,000 Gold marks in debt. The other directors threatened to declare bankruptcy if Daimler didn&#x27;t sell them all his shares and all his personal patent rights from the previous thirty years. Daimler accepted the offer, receiving 66,666 Gold Marks, and resigned in 1893.

In 1894 at the Hermann Hotel, Maybach together with Daimler and his son Paul designed a third engine called the &quot;Phoenix&quot; and had DMG make it. It featured:
* four cylinders cast in one block arranged vertically and parallel
* camshaft operated exhaust valves
* a spray nozzle carburetor, patented by Maybach in 1893
* an improved belt drive system

This is probably the same internal-combustion engine referred to by the American author and historian Henry Brooks Adams, who describes the &quot;Daimler motor&quot; and its great speed from his visit to the 1900 Paris Exposition in his autobiography.

Daimler and Maybach continued to work together. They built a four-cylinder engine with Maybach&#x27; spray nozzle carburetor. It was in the first organized automobile race, the &quot;Paris to Rouen&quot; and defeated all the entries from DMG. Frederick Simms, German-born long-time friend of Gottlieb Daimler insisted that Daimler be brought back into the company making it a condition of his payment of £17,500 for the transfer of his Daimler licenses to the British Daimler Company which would stabilize the corporation&#x27;s finances, that Daimler, now aged sixty, should return to DMG. Gottlieb Daimler received 200,000 goldmarks in shares, plus a 100,000 bonus. Simms received the right to use the name &quot;Daimler&quot; as his brand name for Daimler Company products. In 1895, the year DMG assembled its 1,000th engine, Maybach returned as General Inspector, receiving 30,000 shares.

During this period, they agreed to licenses to build Daimler engines around the world, which included:
* France, from 1890, under a licence held by Louise Sarazin: Panhard et Levassor and Peugeot, 
* the United States, from 1891, under Daimler Motor Company of Long Island City in a partnership with American and German piano maker Steinway &amp; Sons
* the United Kingdom, from 1893, by Frederick Simms&#x27; Daimler Motor Syndicate transferred in 1896 to the Daimler Motor Company
* Austria, by Austro Daimler

Daimler died in 1900, and in 1907 Maybach resigned from DMG.

==Founding of Daimler-Benz==

Daimler had developed the first liquid petroleum vehicle in 1885 and Karl Benz had developed the first purpose-built automobile using a 2 cycle engine of his own design a few months later. Daimler never met Karl Benz during the period of invention. In 1896 Daimler (DMG) sued Benz &amp; Cie for violating his 1883 patent on hot tube ignition. Daimler won and Benz had to pay royalties to DMG. Daimler did not meet Karl Benz while they were in court in Mannheim. Later at the founding of the Central European Motor Car Association Daimler and Benz still did not speak to each other.

Years after Daimler died, the two companies did cooperate in many ways. After many years of cooperation, on 28 June 1926 representatives of Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft (DMG) and Benz &amp; Cie signed the agreement for the merger of the two oldest automobile manufacturers in the world. The resulting new company was named Daimler-Benz AG.

==Honours==
Gottlieb Daimler was accepted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1978. Between 1993 and July 2008 Daimler had a stadium named after him in Stuttgart, Germany. The former Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion was the venue for six matches in the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany.

Gottlieb Daimler&#x27;s motto was &quot;Das Beste oder nichts&quot; (&quot;The best or nothing at all&quot;; &quot;Nothing but the best&quot;). Mercedes-Benz adopted this motto as their slogan in 2010.

<text>Informal mathematics, also called naïve mathematics, has historically been the predominant form of mathematics at most times and in most cultures, and is the subject of modern ethno-cultural studies of mathematics. The philosopher Imre Lakatos in his &quot;Proofs and Refutations&quot; aimed to sharpen the formulation of informal mathematics, by reconstructing its role in nineteenth century mathematical debates and concept formation, opposing the predominant assumptions of mathematical formalism. Informality may not discern between statements given by &quot;inductive reasoning&quot; (as in approximations which are deemed &quot;correct&quot; merely because they are useful), and statements derived by &quot;deductive reasoning&quot;.

==Terminology==

&quot;Informal mathematics&quot; means any informal mathematical practices, as used in everyday life, or by aboriginal or ancient peoples, without historical or geographical limitation. Modern mathematics, exceptionally from that point of view, emphasizes formal and strict proofs of all statements from given axioms. This can usefully be called therefore &quot;formal mathematics&quot;. Informal practices are usually understood intuitively and justified with examples—there are no axioms. This is of direct interest in anthropology and psychology: it casts light on the perceptions and agreements of other cultures. It is also of interest in developmental psychology as it reflects a naïve understanding of the relationships between numbers and things. Another term used for informal mathematics is &quot;folk mathematics&quot;, which is ambiguous; the mathematical folklore article is dedicated to the usage of that term among professional mathematicians.

The field of naïve physics is concerned with similar understandings of physics. People use mathematics and physics in everyday life, without really understanding (or caring) how mathematical and physical ideas were historically derived and justified.

==History==
There has long been a standard account of the development of geometry in ancient Egypt, followed by Greek mathematics and the emergence of deductive logic. The modern sense of the term &quot;mathematics&quot;, as meaning only those systems justified with reference to axioms, is however an anachronism if read back into history. Several ancient societies built impressive mathematical systems and carried out complex calculations based on proofless heuristics and practical approaches. Mathematical facts were accepted on a basis. Empirical methods, as in science, provided the justification for a given technique. Commerce, engineering, calendar creation and the prediction of eclipses and stellar progression were practiced by ancient cultures on at least three continents.

<text>Overboard is Chip Dunham&#x27;s daily newspaper comic strip about a shipload of incompetent pirates. It debuted in July 1990 and is distributed by Andrews McMeel Syndication.

==The strip==

&quot;Overboard&quot; derives much of its humor from having its characters anachronistically placed in modern times. For instance, they put quarters in dockside parking meters, order pizza by cellphone, and have a company health insurance plan.

These pirates are much less fearsome than their ruthless predecessors. In the early years of the strip, much of their activity involved standing around on deck drinking coffee and reading the newspaper. Recent strips feature golf, pet care and gardening. Their enemy is the Green Ship and its rival band of pirates, but giant rabbits attacking the garden, sharks, octopuses, and the Internal Revenue Service also are threats.

Competence is also an issue. While the &quot;Overboard&quot; crew carries cutlasses and makes raids, most often their treasure is stolen by disgruntled shipmates or by more able pirates. The captain has made a horrendous mess of the investments for their pension fund (at one point, he adjusts his failed investment strategy by flushing cash straight down the toilet).

The pirates actively pursue dates with women but instead repulse them with poor hygiene, fleas, disgusting table manners, immaturity, cheapness, and a lack of interest in the arts. The captain impresses women and other outsiders with his incredibly boring personality (in one strip, the captain&#x27;s psychiatrist dies of boredom during a therapy session). Despite occasional friendships with women, it appears that none of the pirates has ever had an official girlfriend, other than the captain who has had a mermaid girlfriend.

==Cast==

The main characters are: 
* Captain Henry Crow - the bland skipper of their ship, the &quot;Revenge&quot;. Crow seems a little smarter and more sophisticated than the crew, but he is far too decent to be a successful pirate, even if he were otherwise capable. Regularly participates in large battles but, curiously, reacts to duels with cowardice.
* Charley Duff - along with Crow&#x27;s other crew members, the diminutive Charley was originally portrayed as lying, lazy, stupid, selfish, and childlike. Yet, like the others, he was the best Crow could do, owing to recruitment woes such as scurvy. In recent years, Charley has been more productive and responsible, perhaps for two reasons. Several years ago, Charley attempted to reform his character so as to win the affection of Marlene. Though he failed in his goal, the changes seem permanent. Also, Charley has become a conscientious pet owner, which has mitigated his selfishness, it seems. Perhaps all this makes it not too surprising that Charley has become an ardent if hapless gardener. 
* Nate - crew member who at first glance looks most like a pirate: hulking, fearsome, with a massive and impenetrable black beard. Despite some rough ways and bad hygiene, Nate is a gentle giant who often acts with honor and respect toward others, especially women and children. Nate and the captain often conspire to keep Charley out of trouble.
* Louie - Captain Crow&#x27;s pet dog. Unlike every other regular animal character in the strip, Louie doesn&#x27;t speak but rather projects thought balloons, in the manner of Snoopy or Garfield. Other animals, but not humans, can understand these and be understood by Louie. Louie is extremely spoiled, always helping himself to human luxuries such as beds and steaks. He seems to have a better lifestyle than the subordinate pirates and usually gets his way. He is a yellow Labrador Retriever, as mentioned in the strip repeatedly, and many of Louie&#x27;s behaviours are considered stereotypical of the breed. His birthday is September 14; in 2019 the celebration involved a series of toppled trash cans full of goodies.
* The Green Pirates - a gang of rival pirates from another ship, they are always around to start a fight or to steal their treasure. While more ruthless than Crow&#x27;s crew, the Green Pirates have not generally proven to be much smarter or more competent. 
* Guy with clover in hat - one of the pirates from the Green Ship. Has been seen to be nice to Louie, unlike most of the Green Ship pirates. This led to Louie asking the cartoonist to make sure he doesn&#x27;t get hurt in one of the strips.
* Cecilia - a female pirate from the Green Ship, she made a covert attempt to seduce Captain Crow and raid his ship. When her cover was blown, she became a regular aboard Crow&#x27;s ship; he encouraged her visits because he remained in love with her, despite her duplicity. Curiously, Cecilia became friends with Crow and no longer posed any threat, though she never came to love him. This storyline lasted several months and Cecilia stayed in the strip for a long time after her plot was exposed. It seemed that she had become a regular character, but Cecilia silently disappeared from the strip sometime in 2003, though her dog Raymond remains. (During Cecilia&#x27;s storyline, it was stated that she was captain of the Green Ship, but she was not seen before or after. In the strip for January 3, 2007, Crow states that he and the Green Ship captain became enemies in high school. The Green Ship captain is shown to be a man.)
* Raymond - another dog. Unlike Louie, Raymond walks on two legs, wears a hat, smokes cigarettes, and talks directly to humans. He can also understand Louie&#x27;s thought balloons, however, and still retains many dog-like characteristics such as a love of eating garbage and carrion. Raymond was originally depicted as belonging to the villainous Cecilia and serving as a henchman in her schemes against Crow&#x27;s crew, but like Cecilia he gradually became friends with Crow and continued as a regular even after Cecilia&#x27;s departure from the cast.
* The cartoonist - often appears at his drawing table with a sign saying &quot;Overboard, Inc.&quot; Whenever Charley comes into his office asking for a raise, he draws a sea monster to eat him.
* Janey - a mermaid that Crow has developed a friendship with (and romantic feelings for). However, she and Crow both acknowledge the difficulties posed by their differences, such as Janey&#x27;s preference for worms as pizza topping.
* The sea monster - a giant Godzilla-like creature that shows up now and then to terrorize Crow&#x27;s ship. Not to be confused with the tentacle that is usually drawn in as a practical joke by the cartoonist. In the March 22, 2008 strip, it is revealed that his name is &quot;Gork&quot; and that he is in love with Janey the mermaid.
* Scratch the Green Ship&#x27;s cat. Scratch wants very much to eat the mice. He originally lived on the Green Ship, but his owner became violently allergic to him and asked Captain Crow to take him in.
* The mice - normal-sized but talking mice that live on the ship. A female mouse, Ellie, has unrequited romantic feelings for Captain Crow, much to the annoyance of her boyfriend, Jonas. At first, none of the human crew could understand the mice, hearing only squeaks or very tiny voices; generally leaving the translations to Raymond. Over time, the humans began to understand the mice without any difficulty, leaving Louie the animal that can&#x27;t speak aloud. Recently, the mice have taken on more and more human like quality, including a recent strip showing a large quantity of mouse holes for sale as a result of foreclosure, as well as the mice playing human sports, like hockey (albeit, with miniature equipment, played on the ship&#x27;s kiddie pool, filled with frozen water.) The mice have also taken to driving tiny cars around the ship; which has resulted in them incurring traffic violations, largely due to them ramming into one of the human crew (generally Crow, who in one strip, revealed his foot was in a cast as a result of such a crash). The traffic violations have in turn resulted in Crow acting as jailer for some of the mice, as they pay their &quot;debt to society&quot;. The mice fly miniature fighter aircraft which they use to fly to the Green Ship and attack Scratch. 
* The rabbits - large, anthropomorphic talking rabbits who frequently sneak onto the ship at night to steal from Charley&#x27;s vegetable garden.
* Seahawk - originally depicted as Crow&#x27;s second in command, Seahawk has not been seen in the strip in recent years.
* Boof - a wimpy pirate, often a target of Charley and Seahawk. Not seen in recent years.
* Marlene - a woman who once served as a love interest for Charley. Not seen in recent years. 
* The crow&#x27;s nest pirates - A pair of unnamed pirates who occupied the crow&#x27;s nest of the &quot;Revenge&quot;. Not seen in recent years.

<text>Ozark Ike is a newspaper comic strip about dumb but likable Ozark Ike McBatt, a youth from a rural area in the mountains. The strip was created by Rufus A. (&quot;Ray&quot;) Gotto while he was serving in the Navy during World War II in Washington, D.C. as an illustrator for Navy instruction manuals. The strip ran from November 12, 1945, to September 14, 1958.

==Characters and story==
Strong-but-simple Ike McBatt is from a hillbilly family living in the small backwoods community of Wildweed Run (pop. 49). Ozark Ike is an all-around athlete, playing baseball, football and basketball. Between seasons, he enters the boxing ring. The characters and the baseball park settings are apparently inspired by Ring Lardner&#x27;s well-known baseball short story &quot;Alibi Ike&quot; (1915), filmed in 1935 as the comedy &quot;Alibi Ike&quot;, starring Joe E. Brown in the title role and Olivia de Havilland in her film debut.

Ozark Ike&#x27;s girlfriend is Dinah Fatfield, whose family has been involved in a feud with the McBatt clan for several generations. As is evident in the names, this background situation was inspired by the Hatfield-McCoy feud.

==Personnel==
Gotto is famous for using extreme perspectives to achieve great drama and action in sports. As such &quot;Ozark Ike&quot; attracted publisher Stephen Slesinger&#x27;s attention. Slesinger also owned &quot;Red Ryder&quot;, &quot;King of the Royal Mounted&quot;, US and Canadian rights to &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot;, and had exclusive licensing arrangements for other notable fictional characters including Tarzan and all of the NEA newspaper comics. Slesinger produced the cartoon for distribution through King Features Syndicate, and it debuted November 12, 1945. 

One of the assistants on the strip was Fred Rhoads. Gotto left in 1954 to start his creator-owned baseball strip &quot;Cotton Woods&quot; syndicated by General Features, but &quot;Ozark Ike&quot; continued until 1959 under Bill Lignante and George Olesen. Lignante was also a leading courtroom artist for network television, and is most famous as the artist who created hundreds of drawings of famous patrons that decorate the Palm Restaurants. 

Gotto eventually went on to design the New York Mets logo.

&quot;Ozark Ike&quot; was the nickname of major league baseball players Gus Zernial .

<doc id="185503" wikidata="Q1157179" url="?curid=185503" title="Dagaaba people">
<text>The Dagaaba people (singular Dagao, and, in northern dialects,  for both plural and singular) are an ethnic group located north of the convergence of Ghana, Burkina Faso and Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. They speak the Dagaare language, a Gur language made up of the related Northern Dagaare dialects, Southern Dagaare dialects and a number of sub dialects. In northern dialects, both the language and the people are referred to as . They are related to the Birifor people and the Dagaare Diola. The language is collectively known as Dagaare (also spelled and/or pronounced as Dagaare, Dagaari, Dagarti, Dagara or Dagao), and historically some non-natives have taken this as the name of the people. One historian, describing the former usage of &quot;Dagarti&quot; to refer to this community by colonials, writes: &quot;The name &#x27;Dagarti&#x27; appears to have been coined by the first Europeans to visit the region, from the vernacular root &quot;dagaa&quot;. Correctly &#x27;Dagaari&#x27; is the name of the language, &#x27;Dagaaba&#x27; or &#x27;Dagara&#x27; that of the people, and &#x27;Dagaw&#x27; or &#x27;Dagawie&#x27; that of the land.&quot;

==Geographic spread==
Although sometimes divided into Northern and Southern Dagaare speakers, their combined population was estimated in 2003 at over one million spread across the Northwest corner of Ghana and Sud-Ouest Region in Southwestern Burkina Faso. The Southern Dagaare are a people of around 700,000 living in the western part of Upper West Region. The Northern Dagaare speakers, with an estimated population of 388,000 (in 2001) live primarily in Ioba Province, but also in Poni, Bougouriba, Sissili, and Mouhoun provinces. In Ghana, several waves of internal migration, beginning with the demand for labour in mines and cocao farms in the early 20th century, have brought a sizable Dagaaba population to towns in the southern part of the nation, notably Brong Ahafo Region. In modern Ghana, the Dagaaba homeland of the Upper West Region includes the Districts and towns of Nandom, Lawra, Jirapa, Kaleo, Papu, Nadowli, Daffiama, Wechiau and Hamile. Large communities are also found in the towns of Wa, Bogda, Babile, Tuna, Han, Zambo, Ghana, and Nyoli.

==History==
The source of Dagaaba communities in the pre-colonial era remain a point of debate. The evidence of oral tradition is that the Dagaaba are an outgrowth of the Mole-Dagbani group which migrated to the semi-arid Sahel region in the fourteenth century CE. They are believed to have further migrated to the lower northern part of the region in the seventeenth century. From well before the appearance of Europeans, the Dagaaba lived in small scale agricultural communities, not centralised into any large state-like structure. Ethnological studies point to oral literature which tells that the Dagaaba periodically, and ultimately successfully, resisted attempts at conquest by states in the south of modern Ghana, as well as the Kingdoms of Dagbon, Mamprugu and Gonja in the north. One thesis based on oral evidence is that the Dagaaba formed as a break away faction of Dagbon under Na Nyagse. The colonial borders, demarcated during the Scramble for Africa, placed them in northwestern Ghana and southern Burkina Faso, as well as small populations in Ivory Coast.

===Extra-community relations===
Dagaaba communities have occasionally come into conflict with neighbouring groups, especially over land rights, as recently as the 1980s with the Sisala people and at earlier times with the Wala people. The latter, in alliance with the Wassoulou Empire of Diola Samory Toure, conquered much of Dagawie in the late 1890s, under the generalship of Sarankye Mori but was later defeated by the kaleo naa

Some of the southernmost Dagaaba villages were in the early 1890s under the authority of the Kingdom of Wala but then rebelled in 1894 and asserted their independence. They were however restored to the domains of the Wala Native Authority by the British in 1933.

==Society==
Within the &quot;Dagawie&quot; homelands, the Dagaaba have traditionally formed sedentary agricultural communities. Modern Dagaaba lineages consist of ten clans encompassing over one million people.

===Traditional politics===
Traditional Dagaaba communities are based on the &quot;Yir&quot; subclan or household group, a series of which are clustered into the &quot;Tengan&quot;, an earth deity shrine area. The Tengan system, a constellation of roles usually inherited within the same household group, is called the &quot;tendaalun&quot;. The head of these shrine area systems, the &quot;tengan sob&quot; (sometimes &quot;tindana&quot;) fulfilled the role of community elder and priest, along with the &quot;tengan dem&quot;, the ritual custodian and maintainer of the ritual center. Other priestly/elder roles within the tendaalun include the &quot;suo sob&quot; who performs ritual animal slaughter to the earth deity, the &quot;zongmogre&quot; who performs rituals at the sacred market centres, and the &quot;gara dana&quot; or &quot;wie sob&quot; who is ritual leader among hunting societies. These remain living forms of community in much of Dagaaba society, and influence, among other things, the community perception of land as held in spiritual custodianship, and different community resources falling under the custodianship of different authorities, lineages, and/or spiritual forces.

Until the latter part of the nineteenth century when institutional chieftaincy evolved (and was later imposed by colonial administration), broader Dagaaba communities functioned under a system of councils of elders.

Some Dagaaba communities maintain traditional ceremonial chieftainships, sometimes contesting. As recently as 2006, the &quot;Council of Elders&quot; of the Dagaaba community of Ghana attempted to unite various factions with the appointment of Naa Franklin Suantah, Principal Librarian of the Saint Louis Training College of Kumasi as chief of the Dagaaba community in Ghana.

===Culture===
The Dagaaba, before the influence of the colonialist, were self-reliant in iron production and were very successful in mixed crops farming. They also developed sophisticated musical instruments including gyle (xylophones).
The Dagaaba people are well known
in a local beer making known as dāā Dagadāā, popularly called Pito

===Economics===
Communities in Dagaaba homelands remain primarily small scale agricultural, with family farming plots tilled by the family themselves. In the modern era, off-farm wage income is often used to supplement trade income and subsistence from farming. Fishing communities of Dagaaba persist along the Black Volta, a de facto boundary of Dagaaba lands. Because the communities are found along historic coast-to-Sahel trade routes, trade has long been an important occupation, but largely in local goods. Markets in larger towns are on Sundays, with others on a six-day cycle.

Some contemporary Dagaaba communities of northern Ghana are notable as the last West African communities to still use Cowrie shells as currency, alongside the modern Ghanaian cedi. Cowrie are used not only for traditional ornamental and ceremonial purposes (as other West African communities do), but also as an inflation proof form of internal savings and as a safe medium to trade across national (and currency) boundaries which may divide Dagaaba communities.

===Oral literature===
Oral literature has a long tradition with Dagaaba communities, and remains a living vehicle of education and acculturation in Dagaaba society. There are two main types of literature in Dagaaba society. They can broadly be categorized as secular literature consisting of stories, tales, proverbs and other oral genre and the sacred literature produced during ritual and religious services. The most important of these are bagr mythical narratives recitations and orations produced during initiation rituals and other religious services.

=== Religion ===
Dagaaba communities historically have practiced Traditional religions, as well as Islam and Christianity. The Ghanaian Dagaaba have traditionally had a Cousinage/Joking relationship with the Frafra (Gurunsi) people.

<text>The balafon (pronounced , or, by analogy with &quot;xylophone&quot; etc., ) is a gourd-resonated xylophone, a type of struck idiophone. It is closely associated with the neighbouring Mandé, Bwaba Bobo, Senoufo and Gur peoples of West Africa, particularly the Guinean branch of the Mandinka ethnic group, but is now found across West Africa from Guinea, Burkina Faso, Mali. Its common name, &quot;balafon&quot;, is likely a European coinage combining its Mandinka name &quot;bala&quot; () with the word &quot;fôn&quot; () &#x27;to speak&#x27; or the Greek root &quot;phono&quot;.

==History==
Believed to have been developed independently of the Southern African and South American instrument now called the marimba, oral histories of the balafon date it to at least the rise of the Mali Empire in the 12th century CE. Balafon is a Manding name, but variations exist across West Africa, including the &quot;balangi&quot; in Sierra Leone and the gyil of the Dagara, Lobi and Gurunsi from Ghana, Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast. Similar instruments are played in parts of Central Africa, with the ancient Kingdom of Kongo denoting the instrument as &quot;palaku&quot;.

Records of the balafon go back to at least the 12th century CE. In 1352 CE, Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta reported the existence of the ngoni and balafon at the court of Malian ruler Mansa Suleyman.

European visitors to West Africa described balafons in the 17th century largely identical to the modern instrument. The Atlantic Slave Trade brought some balafon players to the Americas. The &quot;Virginia Gazette&quot; records African-Americans playing a &quot;barrafoo&quot; in 1776, which appears to be a balafon. Other North American references to these instruments die out by the mid-19th century.

The balafon has seen a resurgence since the 1980s in the growth of African Roots Music and World Music. Most famous of these exponents is the Rail Band, led by Salif Keita. Even when not still played, its distinctive sound and traditional style has been exported to western instruments. Maninka from eastern Guinea play a type of guitar music that adapts balafon playing style to the imported instrument.

===Etymology===
In the Malinké language &quot;balafon&quot; is a compound of two words: &quot;balan&quot; is the name of the instrument and &quot;fô&quot; is the verb &quot;to play&quot;. Balafon therefore is really the act of &quot;playing the bala&quot;.

&quot;Bala&quot; still is used as the name of a large bass balafon in the region of Kolokani and Bobo Dioulasso. These &quot;bala&quot; have especially long keys and huge calabashes for amplification. &quot;Balani&quot; is then used as the name of the high pitched, small balafon with small calabashes and short (3 to 4 cm long) keys. The &quot;balani&quot; is carried with a strap and usually has 21 keys, while the number of keys on a &quot;bala&quot; vary with region.

==Construction==

A balafon can be either &quot;fixed-key&quot; (where the keys are strung over a fixed frame, usually with calabash resonators underneath) or &quot;free-key&quot; (where the keys are placed independently on any padded surface). The balafon usually has 17–21 keys, tuned to a tetratonic, pentatonic or heptatonic scale, depending on the culture of the musician.

The balafon is generally capable of producing 18 to 21 notes, though some are built to produce many fewer notes (16, 12, 8 or even 6 and 7). Balafon keys are traditionally made from kosso rosewood, dried slowly over a low flame, and then tuned by shaving off bits of wood from the underside of the keys. Wood is taken off the middle to flatten the key or the end to sharpen it.

In a &quot;fixed-key&quot; balafon, the keys are suspended by leather straps just above a wooden frame, under which are hung graduated-size calabash gourd resonators. A small hole in each gourd is covered with a membrane traditionally of thin spider&#x27;s-egg sac filaments (nowadays more usually of cigarette paper or thin plastic film) to produce the characteristic nasal-buzz timbre of the instrument, which is usually played with two gum-rubber-wound mallets while seated on a low stool (or while standing using a shoulder or waist sling hooked to its frame).

==Regional traditions==

As the balafon cultures vary across West Africa, so does the approach to the instrument itself. In many areas the balafon is played alone in a ritual context, in others as part of an ensemble. In Guinea and Mali, the balafon is often part of an ensemble of three, pitched low, medium and high. In Cameroon, six balafon of varying size perform together in an orchestra, called a &quot;komenchang&quot;. An Igbo variation exists with only one large tuned key for each player. And while in most cases a single player hits multiple keys with two mallets, some traditions place two or more players at each keyboard.

The Susu and Malinké people of Guinea are closely identified with the balafon, as are the other Manding peoples of Mali, Senegal, and the Gambia. Cameroon, Chad, and even the nations of the Congo Basin have long balafon traditions.

Often, balafon players will wear belled bracelets on each wrist, accentuating the sound of the keys.

In some cultures the balafon was (and in some still is) a sacred instrument, playable only by trained religious caste members and only at ritual events such as festivals, royal, funerial, or marriage celebrations. Here the balafon is kept in a temple storehouse, and can only be removed and played after undergoing purification rites. Specific instruments may be built to be only played for specific rituals and repertoires. Young adepts are trained not on the sacred instrument, but on &quot;free-key&quot; pit balafons.

===Gyil===

The gyil ( or ) is the name of a buzzing pentatonic balafon common to the Gur-speaking populations in northern Ghana, Burkina Faso, southeastern Mali and northern Ivory Coast in West Africa. Among Mande populations in Ghana like the Ligbi (Numu), Bissa and Dyula, the same instrument is known as &quot;bala&quot;. The gyil is the primary traditional instrument of the Dagara people of northern Ghana and Burkina Faso, and of the Lobi of Ghana, southern Burkina Faso, and Ivory Coast. The gyil is usually played in pairs, accompanied by a calabash gourd drum called a &quot;kuor&quot;. It can also be played by one person with the drum and the stick part as accompaniment, or by a soloist. Gyil duets are the traditional music of Dagara funerals. The instrument is generally played by men, who learn to play while young; however, there is no restriction on gender. It is also played by the Gurunsi people of the Upper East Region of Ghana, as well as neighbouring Gurunsi populations across the border in south and central Burkina Faso. A dance related to the gyil is the Bewaa.

The gyil&#x27;s design is similar to the &quot;balaba&quot; or balafon used by the Mande-speaking Bambara, Dyula and Sosso peoples further west in southern Mali and western Burkina Faso, as well as the Senoufo people of Sikasso, a region that shares many musical traditions with those of northern Ivory Coast and Ghana. It is made with 14 wooden keys of an African hardwood called liga attached to a wooden frame, below which hang calabash gourds. Spider web silk covers small holes in the gourds to produce a buzzing sound and antelope sinew and leather are used for the fastenings. The instrument is played with rubber-headed wooden mallets.

===Cameroon===

During the 1950s, bars sprang up across Cameroon&#x27;s capital to accommodate an influx of new inhabitants, and soon became a symbol for Cameroonian identity in the face of colonialism. Balafon orchestras, consisting of 3–5 balafons and various percussion instruments became common in these bars. Some of these orchestras, such as Richard Band de Zoetele, became quite popular in spite of scorn from the European elite.

The middle of the 20th century saw the popularisation of a native folk music called bikutsi. Bikutsi is based on a war rhythm played with various rattles, drums and balafon. Sung by women, bikutsi featured sexually explicit lyrics and songs about everyday problems. In a popularised form, bikutsi gained mainstream success in the 1950s. Anne-Marie Nzie was perhaps the most important of the early innovators. The next bikutsi performer of legendary stature was Messi Me Nkonda Martin and his band, Los Camaroes, who added electric guitars and other new elements.

Balafon orchestras had remained popular throughout the 50s in Yaoundé&#x27;s bar scene, but the audience demanded modernity and the popular style at the time was unable to cope. Messi Martin was a Cameroonian guitarist who had been inspired to learn the instrument by listening to Spanish language-broadcasts from neighboring Equatorial Guinea, as well as Cuban and Zairean rumba. Messi changed the electric guitar by linking the strings together with pieces of paper, thus giving the instrument a damper tone that emitted a &quot;thudding&quot; sound similar to the balafon.

===Guinea===
The balafon, kora (lute-harp), and the ngoni (the ancestor of the banjo) are the three instruments most associated with griot bardic traditions of West Africa. Each is more closely associated with specific areas, communities, and traditions, though all are played together in ensembles throughout the region. Guinea has been the historic heartland of solo balafon. As griot culture is a hereditary caste, the Kouyaté family has been called the &quot;keepers of the balafon&quot;, and twentieth century members of this family have helped introduce it throughout the world.

==== The Sosso Bala ====

The Sosso Bala is a balafon, currently kept in the town of Niagassola, Guinea that is reputed to be &quot;the&quot; original balafon, constructed over 800 years ago. The Epic of Sundiata, a story of the formation of the Mali Empire, tells that a griot (praise-singer) named Bala Faséké Kouyaté convinced Sosso king Sumanguru Kante to employ him after sneaking into Sumanguru&#x27;s palace and playing the sacred instrument. Sundiata Keita, founder of the Mali Empire overthrew Sumanguru, seized the balafon, and made the griot Faséké its guardian. This honor is said to have passed down through his family, the Kouyatés, and conveys upon them mastership of the balafon to this day.


Historians Jan Jansen and Francis Simonis have argued that the Sosso Bala was in fact &#x27;invented&#x27; as a historical artifact by the Kouyaté family in the 1970s. Regardless of the truth of this story, the Sosso Bala was named by UNESCO as one of the Nineteen Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity in 2001.

=== Senegal ===
The title of the Senegalese National Anthem is &quot;Pincez tous vos koras, frappez les balafons&quot; (&quot;Everyone strum your koras, strike the balafons&quot;).

===Mali===

A modern festival devoted to the balafon, the Triangle du balafon, now takes place annually at Sikasso in Mali.

<text>Lucius Annaeus Seneca the Elder ( ; – c. AD 39), also known as Seneca the Rhetorician, was a Roman writer, born of a wealthy equestrian family of Corduba, Hispania. He wrote a collection of reminiscences about the Roman schools of rhetoric, six books of which are extant in a more or less complete state and five others in epitome only. His principal work, a history of Roman affairs from the beginning of the Civil Wars until the last years of his life, is almost entirely lost to posterity. Seneca lived through the reigns of three significant emperors; Augustus (ruled 27 BC – 14 AD), Tiberius (ruled 14–37 AD) and Caligula (ruled 37–41 AD). He was the father of Lucius Junius Gallio Annaeanus, best known as a Proconsul of Achaia; his second son was the dramatist and Stoic philosopher Seneca the Younger (&quot;Lucius&quot;), who was tutor of Nero, and his third son, Marcus Annaeus Mela, became the father of the poet Lucan.

==Biography==
Seneca the Elder is the first of the gens Annaea of whom there is definite knowledge. During the renaissance his name and his works became confused with his son Lucius Annaeus Seneca. In the early 16th century Raphael of Volterra saw that there must be two different men. He noted that two of the elder Seneca&#x27;s grandsons were called Marcus and since there was a Roman custom for boys to be given the name of their grandfather, Raphael adopted the name of Marcus for the elder Seneca. Until the 20th century this was used as the standard &quot;praenomen&quot;. However it is now accepted that this naming custom was not rigid, and since in the manuscripts he is referred to as Lucius, many scholars now prefer this &quot;praenomen&quot; since it would also help explain why their works became so confused.

Growing up in Spain of wealth and equestrian rank, Seneca the Elder (here Seneca) was a young contemporary of the venerable Roman orator Cicero, whose voice of advocacy he might have sought out were he reared in Italy. Instead, he was confined by wartime conditions to &#x27;within the walls&#x27; of his &#x27;own colony&#x27;, and there, presumably, he received his first schooling from a &quot;praeceptor&quot; teaching more than two hundred pupils.

When Rome became safe after the Civil Wars, Seneca travelled for lengthy stays there. He assiduously attended public declamations by teachers of rhetoric and professional orators—the process in those days by which young men trained for pursuing careers in advocacy and public administration. There is no evidence, however, that he pursued such a career himself. And he avoided notice of his writing a history of Rome &#x27;From the beginning of the Civil Wars&#x27; through his own times, &quot;during the regime of Caligula&quot;. Instead, by testimony of the son Seneca (from his &quot;De Vita Patris&quot;), his father remained all his life a private gentleman. Still, Seneca supported as honourable the political careers of his elder (two) sons, and he spoke for the study of rhetoric as honourable even as he was fully aware of the dangers inherent in such careers: &#x27;in which the very objectives sought after are to be feared&#x27;. And he supported his youngest son, Mela, who remained content with his heritage as an equestrian.

==Works==
===The declamatory anthology===
In his old age, on basis of his experiences attending the schools and &quot;auditoria&quot; of the declaimers in the Rome of Augustus and Tiberius, Seneca the Elder (Seneca) completed the work on which his fame rests today: the &quot;Oratorum et Rhetorum Sententiae Divisiones Colores&quot;. Originally comprising ten books on the subject of fictitious lawsuits &quot;(Controversiae)&quot; and at least one book on fictitious speeches of persuasion &quot;(Suasoriae)&quot;, his effort was ostensibly at the request of his sons, and was ostensibly written from memory. The influence of declamation was widespread in Roman elite culture, both in a didactic role and as a performative genre. Public declamations were attended by such figures as Pliny the Elder, Asinius Pollio, Maecenas, and the emperor Augustus. Seneca mentioned the poet Ovid as being a star declaimer; the works of the satirists Martial and Juvenal and the historian Tacitus reveal substantial declamatory influence.

Seneca&#x27;s work here, however, is neither a collection of his own declamations nor fair copies of those delivered by other declaimers; it is an anthology. It provides extracts and analyses of the declamatory art issuing from the rhetorical celebrities of his (younger) days spent in Rome. It is not a theoretical treatise on declamation; Seneca&#x27;s own input is limited to pen-portraits of the famous declaimers he cites, plus analytical and critical commentary on their work; and of anecdotes remembered from the literary chatter of long ago.

The declaimers of Augustan and Tiberian Rome professed admiration for Cicero, but their preferred oratorical style was not very Ciceronian; nor was it the theoretical basis of their educational method. The declamation they practised was, Seneca claimed, a &quot;new art,&quot; born during his lifetime—its characteristic concentration being on a bizarre set of &quot;imaginary lawsuits&quot; known as &quot;controversiae&quot;. So far as Rome the City was concerned, we must believe him. If the &quot;new art&quot; originated from schools elsewhere in the Greek-speaking world—which is likely, in view of the remoteness of those declamatory themes from the realities in then-Roman law-courts—Seneca seems to have been unaware of it. He was, however, well acquainted with the activities (in the City) of Greek rhetoricians teaching their art in Greek alongside those who taught it in Latin.
Porcius Latro was a close friend of Seneca—from their childhood together and as classmates at the rhetorical school of Marullus in Cordoba—who later became preeminent among Rome&#x27;s rhetoricians in the Augustan era. Latro cultivated the sort of &quot;fiery and agitated style&quot; that Seneca particularly admired. He was characterized by the anthologist as a man of both gravity and charm, as eloquent and worthy. Another close family connection of the Senecas, the orator Junius Gallio, was the only serious rival to Latro among Rome&#x27;s best declaimers, according to Seneca. His tributes to Latro illustrates how both men inhabited a literary world far distant from Cicero&#x27;s—one in which delight in neat contrasts and paradoxes had become all-consuming. &quot; [N]o one,&quot; wrote Seneca of Latro, &quot;was more in command of his intellect: no one was more indulgent towards it&quot;.

In the prefaces to his books of &quot;Controversiae&quot; Seneca identifies rhetoricians who were contemporaries of Latro but with different approaches and skills than his Latronian ideal. He refers specifically to a &quot;primum tetradeum&quot;, meaning the four most distinguished declaimers he had known, which included Latro, Gallio, Albucius Silus, and Arellius Fuscus. He expresses serious reservations of Arellius&#x27; style, for its unevenness, and its descriptive passages (&quot;explicationes&quot;), which Seneca considered &quot;brilliant, but laboured and involved, with a decorative finish too contrived, and word-positioning too effeminate, to be tolerable for a mind preparing itself for such holy and courageous teachings.&quot; But there was no denying the distinction in Rome of the school of Arellius Fuscus, whose pupils included the philosophical writer Fabianus, and the poet Ovid; thus, even by his severe critic, Arellius was ranked highly. Albucius Silus too was influential—as the author of a textbook that Quintilian cited several times.

Seneca&#x27;s declamatory anthology presents a far-reaching critical investigation of the rhetorical basis of the mannerist, so-called &#x27;Silver Age&#x27;, literature. Of this age, Ovid&#x27;s work and the younger Seneca&#x27;s sententious disquisitions and dramatic art, and later, Lucan&#x27;s fiery epic poetry all stand out as striking examples.

===The ten books of the &quot;Controversiae&quot;===

Of the ten books of the &quot;Controversiae&quot;—there are declamatory treatments of some 74 judicial themes, with the names of individual rhetoricians, plus Seneca&#x27;s critical comments—only five: 1, 2, 7, 9, 10, survive in entirety or nearly-so. Information from the missing books is supplied by an epitome written several centuries later for school use. Later, this same tome supplied stories for European literature of the late Middle Ages, namely the 14th century anecdotes-collection known as the &quot;Gesta Romanorum&quot;.

Each of Seneca&#x27;s books was introduced by a &quot;preface&quot;, an approach he compared to that adopted by organizers of gladiatorial shows. Each preface presents pen-portraits of famous declaimers, either as individuals or in pairs. In the tenth preface, Seneca provided a group presentation of declaimers previously overlooked.

Following the prefaces are surveys of the treatments of particular &quot;controversia-themes&quot; by noted declaimers. These surveys, in keeping with the title of the anthology—&quot;Oratorum et Rhetorum Sententiae Divisiones Colores&quot;—were usually provided in three main sections. The first section was &quot;sententiae&quot;, or &#x27;ways of thinking&#x27;, as adopted by various declaimers about their set themes. The second section: &quot;divisiones&quot;, or outlines of their argumentation; and the third: &quot;colores&quot;, or specious interpretations of the actions of their imaginary defendants, with a view to excusing or vilifying them.

The books of &quot;Controversiae&quot; were supplemented by at least one devoted to &quot;Suasoriae&quot; (exercises in &quot;deliberative&quot; oratory), in which historical or mythological characters are imagined as deliberating on their options at crucial junctures in their career. In the only extant book of his Suasoriae, Seneca provides &quot;sententiae&quot; by the declaimers cited, followed by their &quot;divisiones&quot;; but there are no &quot;colores&quot;, which belong exclusively to treatment of judicial rhetoric, and have no place in deliberative oratory.

The elder Seneca&#x27;s authorship of the declamatory anthology &quot;Controversiae&quot;—generally ascribed to his son during the Middle Ages—was vindicated by the work of the Renaissance humanists Raffaello Maffei and Justus Lipsius.

===History===
The elder Seneca (Seneca) was also the author of a lost historical work that recorded a history of Rome from the beginning of the civil wars to (almost) his death, after which it was published by his son. We learn about this magnum opus from the younger Seneca&#x27;s own work &quot; &#x27;De vita patris&#x27; &quot; (H. Peter, &quot;Historicorum Romanorum fragmenta&quot;, 1883, 292, 301) and from a large fragment of the &quot;Historiae&quot; itself, cited by Lactantius in &quot;Institutiones Divinae&quot; 7.15.14. The Lactantius fragment is prefatory (introductory) in character and pessimistic in outlook; it likens the history of Rome to the Seven Ages of Man, while comparing Rome&#x27;s reversion to monarchical rule with the &#x27;second infancy&#x27; of senility. Also extant is Seneca&#x27;s account of the death of Tiberius, cited by Suetonius in Tiberius 73.

In 2017 the papyrologist Valeria Piano published a detailed study of &quot;P.Herc&quot; 1067, a charred papyrus-roll collected from Herculaneum—it was buried by Mt. Vesuvius in AD 79. The scroll was first excavated probably in 1782, and partially unrolled in the early nineteenth century. Piano asserts in her study (published in &quot;Cronache Ercolanesi&quot;, 47, pp. 163–250), on basis of traces of lettering on its final &quot;subscriptio&quot;, that the text was written by one &#x27;L. Annaeus Seneca&#x27;. And, from what can be read of the narrative—that is, of historical and political themes relating to the first decades of the Roman Empire—she proposes that it most likely originated in &quot;(the elder)&quot; Seneca&#x27;s &quot;Historiae&quot;. Further, she judges that traces of a book-title following the author&#x27;s name (in the subscriptio) are more compatible with Seneca&#x27;s own &#x27; &quot;... ab initio b[ell]orum [civilium]&quot; &#x27; than with his declamatory anthology.

Unfortunately, the text of the scroll is now essentially unreadable as continuous narrative because, in the process of unrolling, several layers of tightly rolled papyrus remained stuck together and were peeled away from each other unevenly.

<text>Krar (Geʽez: ክራር) is a five-or-six stringed bowl-shaped lyre from Ethiopia and Eritrea. It is tuned to a pentatonic scale. A modern &quot;Krar&quot; may be amplified, much in the same way as an electric guitar or violin. The &quot;Krar&quot;, along with &quot;Masenqo&quot; and the &quot;Washint&quot;, is one of the most widespread musical instruments in Northern Ethiopia and Eritrea.

==Role in society==

===Historical=== 
In Amhara society, the &quot;krar&quot; was viewed as an instrument inspired by the Devil and was therefore inferior, whereas the &quot;Begena&quot; was for praising God and seen as sacred. The &quot;krar&quot; was used to adulate feminine beauty, create sexual arousal, and eulogize carnal love.

The Derg regime banned playing the krar and imprisoned people who played it, especially in the big cities such as Asmara and Addis Ababa. The instrument has been associated with brigands, outlaws, and &quot;Wata&quot; or &quot;Azmari&quot; wanderers. Wanderers played the &quot;krar&quot; to solicit food, and outlaws played it to sing an Amhara war song called &quot;Fano&quot;.

===Contemporary===
Today, the &quot;krar&quot; which used to be the plaything of the Ethiopian and Eritrean, has become one of the most popular Ethiopian stringed instruments.

The &quot;krar&quot; is used in secular music, love songs, and poetry. It is popular among poet-musicians called &quot;Azmari&quot; or &quot;Wata&quot;.

==Features==

A chordophone, the krar is usually decorated with wood, cloth and beads. Its five or six strings determine the available pitches. The instrument&#x27;s tone depends on the musician&#x27;s playing technique: bowing, strumming, or plucking. If plucked, the instrument will produce a soft tone. Strumming, on the other hand, will yield a harmonious pulsation.

<doc id="185514" wikidata="Q212024" url="?curid=185514" title="Spirituals">
<text>Spirituals (also known as Negro spirituals, African American spirituals, Black spirituals, or spiritual music) is a genre of Christian music that is associated with African Americans, which merged varied African cultural influences with the experiences of being held in bondage in slavery, at first during the transatlantic slave trade and for centuries afterwards, through the domestic slave trade. Spirituals encompass the &quot;sing songs&quot;, work songs, and plantation songs that evolved into the blues and gospel songs in church. In the nineteenth century, the word &quot;spirituals&quot; referred to all these subcategories of folk songs. While they were often rooted in biblical stories, they also described the extreme hardships endured by African Americans who were enslaved from the 17th century until the 1860s, the emancipation altering mainly the nature (but not continuation) of slavery for many. Many new derivative music genres such as the blues emerged from the spirituals songcraft.

Prior to the end of the US Civil War and emancipation, spirituals were originally an oral tradition passed from one slave generation to the next. Biblical stories were memorized then translated into song. Following emancipation, the lyrics of spirituals were published in printed form. Ensembles such as the Fisk Jubilee Singers—established in 1871—popularized spirituals, bringing them to a wider, even international, audience.

At first, major recording studios were only recording white musicians performing spirituals and their derivatives. That changed with Mamie Smith&#x27;s commercial success in 1920. Starting in the 1920s, the commercial recording industry increased the audience for the spirituals and their derivatives.

Black composers Harry Burleigh and R. Nathaniel Dett created a &quot;new repertoire for the concert stage&quot; by applying their Western classical education to the spirituals. While the spirituals were created by a &quot;circumscribed community of people in bondage&quot;, over time they became known as the first &quot;signature&quot; music of the United States.

==Terminology==
&quot;The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;—one of the largest reference works on music and musicians,—itemized and described &quot;spiritual&quot; in their electronic resource, Grove Music Online—an important part of Oxford Music Online, as a &quot;type of sacred song created by and for African Americans that originated in oral tradition. Although its exact provenance is unknown, spirituals were identifiable as a genre by the early 19th century.&quot; They used the term without the descriptor, &quot;African American&quot;.

The term &quot;negro spirituals&quot; is a 19th century word &quot;used for songs with religious texts created by African Enslaved in America&quot;. The first published book of slave songs referred to them as &quot;spirituals&quot;.

In musicology and ethnomusicology in the 1990s, the single term &quot;spirituals&quot; is used to describe &quot;The Spirituals Project&quot;.

The US Library of Congress uses the phrase &quot;African American Spirituals&quot;, for the numbered and itemized entry. In the introductory phrase, the singular form is used without the adjective &quot;African American.&quot; Throughout the encyclopedic entry the singular and plural form of the term, is used without the &quot;African American&quot; descriptor. The LOC introductory sentence says, &quot;A spiritual is a type of religious folksong that is most closely associated with the enslavement of African people in the American South. The songs proliferated in the last few decades of the eighteenth century leading up to the abolishment of legalized slavery in the 1860s. The African American spiritual (also called the Negro Spiritual) constitutes one of the largest and most significant forms of American folksong.&quot;

==Context==
The transatlantic slave trade is described by a United Nations report as the largest forced migration in recorded human history. As a direct result of the transatlantic slave trade, the greatest movement of Africans was to the Americas—with 96 percent of the captives from the African coasts arriving on cramped slave ships at ports in South America and the Caribbean Islands. From 1501 to 1830, four Africans crossed the Atlantic for every one European, making the demographics of the Americas in that era more of an extension of the African diaspora than a European one. The legacy of this migration is still evident today, with large populations of people of African descent living throughout the Americas. Millions more remained enslaved in Africa, where slavery was a complex and deeply-rooted part of culture going back centuries before widespread European presence on the continent.

From 1501 through 1867, approximately &quot;12.5 million Africans&quot; from &quot;almost every country with an Atlantic coastline&quot; were kidnapped and coerced into slavery, according to the 2015 &quot;Atlas&quot; based on about 35,000 slaving voyages. Roughly 6% of all enslaved Africans transported via the trans-Atlantic slave trade arrived in the United States, both before and after the colonial era; the remainder went to Brazil, the West Indies or other regions. The majority of these Africans came from the West African slave coast. Other sources estimate the Islamic slave trade enslaved similar numbers of Africans, with between 8 million and 17 million individuals taken from Africa between the 8th and 19th centuries along the Trans-Saharan trade routes.

The Portuguese Empire transported the first African enslaved peoples to the New World, in the 1560s, and until the 1700s Mexico was the primary destination for African Enslaved people under Spanish control. The first African enslaved people in what is now the United States arrived in 1526, making landfall in present-day Winyah Bay, South Carolina in a short-lived colony called San Miguel de Gualdape under control of the Spanish Empire. They were also the first enslaved Africans in North Americas to stage a slave rebellion. In 1619, the first slave ship had carried twenty people from the west central African kingdom of Kongo—to a life of enslavement in what is now, Mexico. The Kingdom of Kongo, at that time stretched over an area of in the watershed of the Congo River—the second longest river in Africa—and had a population of 2.5 million—was one of the largest African kingdoms. For a brief period, King João I of Kongo, who reigned from 1470 to 1509, had voluntarily converted to Catholicism, and for close to three centuries—from 1491 to 1750—the kingdom of Kongo had practiced Christianity and was an &quot;independent [and] cosmopolitan realm.&quot; The descendants of the rice-plantation enslaved Gullah people—whose country of origin is Sierra Leone—were unique, because they had been much more isolated on the islands off the coast of South Carolina. Gullah spirituals are sung in a creole language that was influenced by African American Vernacular English with the majority of African words coming from the Akan, Yoruba and Igbo. The institution of slavery in the United States ended with the conclusion of the US Civil War in 1865.

The domestic slave trade that emerged after the United States Congress outlawed the international slave trade in 1808, and lasted until the U.S. Civil War, destroyed generations of African American families. Slavery in the United States differed from the institution in other regions of the Americas, such as the West Indies, Dutch Guiana and Brazil. In the U.S., the enslaved had higher rates of survival and thus there was a &quot;high and sustained natural increase in the slave population for a more than a century and a half—with numbers nearly tripling by the end of the domestic slave trade in the 1860s.&quot; During that period, &quot;approximately 1.2 million men, women, and children, the vast majority of whom were born in America,&quot; were displaced—spouses were separated from one another, and parents were separated from their children. By 1850, most enslaved African Americans were &quot;third-, fourth-, or fifth-generation Americans.&quot; In the 1800s, the majority of enslaved people in the British West Indies and Brazil had been born in Africa, whereas in the United States, they were &quot;generations removed from Africa.&quot;

==Overview==

In his 1845 &quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave&quot;, an essay on abolition and a memoire, Frederick Douglass (1818–1895)—a great orator—described slave songs as telling a &quot;tale which was then altogether beyond my feeble comprehension; they were tones, loud, long and deep, breathing the prayer and complaint of souls boiling over with the bitterest anguish. Every tone was a testimony against slavery, and a prayer to God for deliverance from chains… Those songs still follow me, to deepen my hatred of slavery, and quicken my sympathies for my brethren in bonds.&quot; His &quot;Narrative&quot;, which is the most famous of the stories written by former enslaved at that time, is one of the most influential pieces of literature that acted as a catalyst in the early years of the American abolitionist movement, according to the OCLC entry. Slave songs were called &quot;Sorrow songs&quot; by W.E.B. Du Bois in his 1903 book, &quot;The Souls of Black Folk&quot; .

Hansonia Caldwell, the author of &quot;African American music, spirituals: the fundamental communal music of Black Americans&quot; and &quot;African American music: a chronology : 1619–1995&quot;, said that spirituals &quot;sustained Africans when they were enslaved.&quot; She described them as &quot;code songs&quot; that &quot;would announce meetings, as in &quot;Steal Away&quot;, and describe the path for running away, as in &quot;Follow the Drinkin&#x27; Gourd&quot;. &quot;Go Down Moses&quot; referred to Harriet Tubman – that was her nickname—so that when they heard that song, they knew she was coming to the area...I often call the spiritual an omnibus term, because there are lots of different [subcategories] under it. They used to sing songs as they worked in the fields. In the church, it evolved into the gospel song. In the fields, it became the blues.&quot; Hansonia Caldwell, who was a professor of music at California State University, Dominguez Hills (CSUDH) from 1972 to 2011, also oversaw an Archive of Sacred Music at CSUDH—an extensive collection of music, books, periodicals, documents, audio &amp; visual materials, and oral histories.&quot;

&quot;The African American spiritual (also called the Negro Spiritual) constitutes one of the largest and most significant forms of American folksong,&quot; according to a Library of Congress 2016 article.

Spirituals were originally oral, but by 1867 the first compilation, entitled &quot;Slave Songbook&quot;, was published. In the book&#x27;s preface, one of the co-compilers, William Francis Allen, traced the &quot;development of Negro Spirituals and cultural connections to Africa.&quot; The 1867 publication included spirituals that were well-known and regularly sung in American churches but whose origins in plantations, had not been acknowledged. Allen wrote that, it was almost impossible to convey the spirituals in print because of the inimitable quality of African American voices with its &quot;intonations and delicate variations&quot;, where not &quot;even one singer&quot; can be &quot;reproduced on paper&quot;. Allen described the complexity of songs such as &quot;I can&#x27;t stay behind, my Lord&quot;, or &quot;Turn, sinner, turn O!&quot; which have a &quot;complicated shout&quot; where there are no singing parts, and no two singers &quot;appear to be singing the same thing.&quot; The lead &quot;singer starts the words of each verse, often improvising, and the others, who &quot;base&quot; him, as it is called, strike in with the refrain, or even join in the solo, when the words are familiar.&quot;
In their 1925 book, &quot;The Books of American Negro Spirituals&quot;, James Weldon Johnson and Grace Nail Johnson said that spirituals, which are &quot;purely and solely the creation&quot; of African Americans, represent &quot;America&#x27;s only type of folk music...When it came to the use of words, the maker of the song was struggling under his limitations in language and, perhaps, also under a misconstruction or misapprehension of the facts in his source of material, generally the Bible.&quot; The couple were active during the Harlem Renaissance James Weldon Johnson was the leader of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).

Arthur C. Jones, a Professor in the Musicology, Ethnomusicology and Theory Department at the Lamont School of Music at the University of Denver, founded &quot;The Spirituals Project&quot; to preserve and revitalize the &quot;music and teachings of the sacred folk songs called spirituals,&quot; &quot;created and first sung by African Americans in slavery&quot;. Spirituals were created by a &quot;circumscribed community of people in bondage&quot;, over time they became known as the first &quot;signature&quot; music of the United States. Forbidden to speak their native languages, they generally converted to Christianity. With narrow vocabularies, they used the words they did know to translate biblical information and facts from their other sources into song.

==Cultural origins==
===African foundation===
J.H. Kwabena Nketia (1921–2019) described by the &quot;New York Times&quot; in 2019, as a &quot;pre-eminent scholar of African music&quot;, said in 1973 that there is an important, interdependent, dynamic, and &quot;unbroken conceptual relationship between African and African American music&quot;.

Enslaved African Americans &quot;in the plantation South drew on native rhythms and their African heritage.&quot; According to a May 2012 PBS interview, &quot;spirituals were religious folks songs, often rooted in biblical stories, woven together, sung, and passed along from one slave generation to another&quot;.

According to Walter Pitt&#x27;s 1996 book, spirituals are a musical form that is indigenous and specific to the religious experience African slaves and their descendants in the United States. Pitts said that they were a result of the interaction of music and religion from Africa with music and religion of European origin.

In a May 2012 PBS interview, Uzee Brown, Jr. said that spirituals were the &quot;survival tools for the African slave&quot;. Brown said that while other similarly-oppressed cultures were &quot;virtually wiped out&quot;, the African slave survived because of spirituals by &quot;singing through many of their problems&quot;, by creating their own &quot;way of communicating&quot;. Enslaved people introduced a number of new instruments to America: the bones, body percussion, and an instrument variously called the bania, banju, or banjar, a precursor to the banjo but without frets. They brought with them from Africa long-standing religious traditions that highlighted the importance of storytelling.

Evidence of the vital role African music has played in the creation of African American spirituals exists, among other elements, in the use of &quot;complex rhythms&quot; and &quot;polyrhythms&quot; from West Africa.

===Religion in everyday life===
According to the beliefs of slave religion—the &quot;material and the spiritual are part of an intrinsic unity&quot;. Music, religion, and everyday life are inseparable in the spirituals, and through them, religious ideals were infused into the activities of everyday life. The spirituals provided some immunity protecting the African American religion from being colonized, and in this way preserved the &quot;sacred as a potential space of resistance&quot;. A 2015 article in the &quot;Journal of Black Studies&quot; said that it was not surprising therefore that &quot;spirituals were sung primarily as rowing songs, field songs, work songs, and social songs, rather than exclusively within the church.&quot; The article described how, &quot;through the use of metonymy (substituting associated words to ostensibly alter the semantic content), spirituals acted as a form of religious education, able to speak simultaneously of material and spiritual freedom&quot;, for example in the spiritual, &quot;Steal Away to Jesus&quot;.

In William Eleazar Barton&#x27;s (1899–1972) &quot;Old Plantation Hymns&quot;, the author wrote that African American &quot;hymns seldom make allusion to the Bible as a source of inspiration. They prefer &quot;heart religion&quot; to &quot;book religion&quot;. Barton, who attended services with African Americans, said that they did not sing the &quot;ordinary&quot; hymns that strengthened &quot;assurance by a promise of God in Holy Scripture&quot;; rather, in the African-American hymns, they appeal to a more personal &quot;revelation from the Lord.&quot; He cites the examples of &quot;We&#x27;re Some of the Praying People&quot; and a hymn from Alabama—&quot;Wear a starry crown&quot;. He also notes that both these songs have a &quot;threefold repetition and a concluding line.&quot; In the latter, we find the &quot;familiar swing and syncopation&quot; of the African American.

Spirituals were not simply different versions of hymns or Bible stories, but rather a creative altering of the material; new melodies and music, refashioned text, and stylistic differences helped to set apart the music as distinctly African-American.

The First Great Awakening, or &quot;Evangelical Revival&quot;—a series of Christian revivals in the 1730s and 1740s swept Great Britain and its North American colonies, resulted in many enslaved people in the colonies being converting to Christianity. During that time northern Baptist and Methodist preachers converted African Americans, including those who were enslaved. In some communities African Americans were accepted into Christian communities as deacons. From 1800 to 1825 enslaved people were exposed to the religious music of camp meetings on the ever-expanding frontier. As African religious traditions declined in America in the 18th and 19th centuries, more African Americans began to convert to Christianity. In a 1982 &quot;scathing critique&quot; of Awakening scholars, Yale University historian, Jon Butler, wrote that the Awakening was a myth that has been constructed by historians in the 18th century who had attempted to use the narrative of the Awakening for their own &quot;religious purposes&quot;.

===Biblical themes===
By the 17th century, enslaved Africans were familiar with Christian biblical stories, such as the story of Moses and Daniel, seeing their own stories reflected in them. An Africanized form of Christianity evolved in the slave population with African American spirituals providing a way to &quot;express the community&#x27;s new faith, as well as its sorrows and hopes.&quot;

As Africans were exposed to stories from the Bible, they began to see parallels to their own experiences. The story of the exile of the Jews and their captivity in Babylon, resonated with their own captivity.

The lyrics of Christian spirituals reference symbolic aspects of Biblical images such as Moses and Israel&#x27;s Exodus from Egypt in songs such as &quot;Michael Row the Boat Ashore&quot;. There is also a duality in the lyrics of spirituals. They communicated many Christian ideals while also communicating the hardship that was a result of being an enslaved.
The river Jordan in traditional African American religious song became a symbolic borderland not only between this world and the next. It could also symbolize travel to the north and freedom or could signify a proverbial border from the status of slavery to living free.

Syncopation, or ragged time, was a natural part of spiritual music. Songs were played on African-inspired instruments.

==Collections of spiritual lyrics ==
African-American spirituals have associations with plantation songs, slave songs, freedom songs, and songs of the Underground Railway, and were oral until the end of the US Civil War. Following the Civil War and emancipation, there has been &quot;extensive collection and preservation of spirituals as folk song tradition&quot;. The first collection of Negro spirituals was published in 1867, two years after the war had ended. Entitled &quot;Slave Songs of the United States&quot;, it was compiled by three northern abolitionists—Charles Pickard Ware (1840–1921), Lucy McKim Garrison (1842–1877), William Francis Allen (1830–1889) The 1867 compilation built on the entire collection of Charles P. Ware, who had mainly collected songs at Coffin&#x27;s Point, St. Helena Island, South Carolina, home to the African-American Gullah people originally from West Africa. Most of the 1867 book consisted of songs gathered directly from African Americans. By the 1830s at least, &quot;plantation songs&quot;, &quot;genuine slave songs&quot;, and &quot;Negro melodies&quot;, had become extraordinarily popular. Eventually, &quot;spurious imitations&quot; for more &quot;sentimental tastes&quot; were created. The authors noted that &quot;Long time ago&quot;, &quot;Near the lake where drooped the willow&quot;, and &quot;Way down in Raccoon Hollow&quot; were borrowed from African-American songs. There had been a renewed interest in these songs through the Port Royal Experiment (1861– ), where newly-freed African American plantation workers successfully took over operation of Port Royal Island plantations in 1861, where they had formerly been enslaved. Northern abolitionist missionaries, educators and doctors came to oversee Port Royal&#x27;s development. The authors noted that, by 1867, the &quot;first seven spirituals in this collection&quot; were &quot;regularly sung at church&quot;.

In 1869, Colonel Thomas Wentworth Higginson, who commanded the first African-American regiment of the Civil War, the 1st South Carolina Volunteers—&quot;recruited, trained, and stationed at Beaufort, South Carolina&quot; from 1862 to 1863. Higginson admired the former slaves in his regiment saying, &quot;It was their demeanor under arms that shamed the nation into recognizing them as men.&quot; He mingled with the soldiers and in published his 1869 memoir &quot;Army Life in a Black Regiment&quot; in which he included the lyrics of selected spirituals. During the Civil War, Higginson wrote down some of the spirituals he heard in camp. &quot;Almost all their songs were thoroughly religious in their tone, ...and were in a minor key, both as to words and music.&quot;

Starting in 1871, the Fisk Jubilee Singers began touring, creating more interest in the &quot;spirituals as concert repertory&quot;. By 1872, the Jubilee Singers were publishing their own books of songs, which included &quot;The Gospel Train&quot;.

Reverend Alexander Reid had attended a Fisk Jubilee Singers&#x27; performance in 1871, and suggested they add several songs to their repertoire. Reid, who had been a superintendent at the Spencerville Academy in Oklahoma in Choctaw Nation territory in the 1850s, had heard two workers enslaved by the Choctaw people,—an African-American family—father Wallace Willis and daughter Minerva Willis—singing &quot;their favorite plantation songs&quot; from their cabin door in the evenings. They had learned the songs in &quot;Mississippi in their early youth.&quot; Reid provided the Jubilee Singers with the lyrics of &quot;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot&quot;, Roll, Jordan, Roll, &quot;The Angels are Coming&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m a Rolling&quot;, and &quot;Steal Away To Jesus&quot;, and others that Willis and his wife had sung. The Jubilee Singers popularized Willis&#x27; songs.

==Popularization==
===Fisk Jubilee Singers popularized spirituals===
The original Fisk Jubilee Singers, a touring &quot;a cappella&quot; male and female choir of nine students of the newly established Fisk school in Nashville, Tennessee who were active from 1871 to 1878, popularized Negro spirituals. The name &quot;jubilee&quot; referred to the &quot;year of jubilee&quot; in the Old Testament—a time of the emancipation of slaves. On January 9, 1866, shortly after the end of the American Civil War (1861 to May 9, 1865), the American Missionary Association founded the Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee, the historically black college. As a school-fundraiser, the Fisk Jubilee Singers had their first tour on what is now called Jubilee Day—October 6, 1871. The first audiences were small, local, and skeptical, but by 1872, they performed at Boston&#x27;s World Peace Festival and at the White House, and in 1873 they toured Europe.

In their early days, the Jubilee Singers did not sing the slave songs. Sheppard—who also composed and arranged music—explained how slave songs, like those published in the 1867 &quot;Slave Songs&quot;, had not initially been part of the Singers&#x27; repertoire because the songs, &quot;were sacred to our parents, who used them in their religious worship and shouted over them.&quot; Shephard said that, &quot;It was only after many months that gradually our hearts were opened to the influence of these friends and we began to appreciate the wonderful beauty and power of our songs.&quot; Eventually their repertoire began to include these songs.

By 1878 the Singers had disbanded. In 1890 the Singers legacy was revived when Ella Sheppard, Moore—one of the original nine Fisk Jubilee Singers—returned to Fisk and began to coach new jubilee vocalists, including John Wesley Work Jr. (1871–1925). In 1899, Fisk University president E. M. Cravath put out a call for a mixed (male and female) jubilee singers ensemble that would tour on behalf of the university. The full mixed choir became too expensive to tour, and was replaced by John Work II&#x27;s male quartet. The quartet received &quot;widespread acclaim&quot; and eventually made a series of best-selling recordings for Victor in December 1909, February 1911, for Edison in December 1911, for Columbia is October 1915 and February 1916, and Starr in 1916. John Work Jr.—also known as John Work II—spent three decades at Fisk University, collecting and promulgating the &quot;jubilee songcraft&quot; of the original Fisk Jubilee Singers and in 1901 he co-published &quot;New Jubilee Songs as Sung by the Fisk Jubilee Singers&quot; with his brother, Frederick J. Work.

From 1890 through 1919, &quot;African Americans made significant contributions to the recording industry in its formative years&quot;, with recordings by the Fisk Jubilee Singers and others.

===Hampton Singers===
In 1873, the Hampton Singers formed a group in Hampton, Virginia at what is now known as Hampton University. They were the first ensemble to &quot;rival the Jubilee Singers&quot;. With Robert Nathaniel Dett (1882–1943) as conductor until 1933, Hampton Singers &quot;earned an international following.&quot;

===Tuskegee Institute Quartet===
The first formal &quot;a cappella&quot; Tuskegee Quartet was organized in 1884 by Booker T. Washington, who was also the founder of the Tuskegee Institute. Since 1881, Washington had insisted that everyone attending their weekly religious services should join in singing African American spirituals. The Quartet was formed to &quot;promote the interest of Tuskegee Institute&quot;. In 1909 a new quartet was formed. The singers travelled intermittently until the 1940s. Like the Fisk Jubilee Singers, the Tuskegee Institute Singers sang spirituals in a modified harmonized style.

===The concert spiritual tradition===
African American composers—Harry Burleigh, R. Nathaniel Dett, and William Dawson, created a &quot;new repertoire for the concert stage&quot; by applying their Western classical education to the spirituals. They brought spirituals to concert settings and mentored the next generation of professional spirituals musicians starting in the early 20th century.
Harry Burleigh&#x27;s (1866–1949)—an African-American classical composer and baritone performed in many concert settings published &quot;Jubilee Songs of the United States&quot; in 1929, which made &quot;spirituals available to solo concert singers as art songs for the first time&quot;. Burleigh arranged spirituals with a classical form. He was also a baritone, who performed in many concert settings. He introduced classically trained artists, such as Antonín Dvořák to African-American spirituals. Some believe that Dvorak was inspired by the spirituals in his &quot;Symphony From the New World&quot;. He coached African-American soloists, such as Marian Anderson, as solo classical singers. Others, such as Roland Hayes and Paul Robeson continued his legacy.

Burleigh published &quot;Jubilee Songs of the United States&quot; in 1929, which made &quot;spirituals available to solo concert singers as art songs for the first time&quot;.
R. Nathaniel Dett (1882–1943) is known for his arrangements that incorporated the music and spirit of European Romantic composers with African-American spirituals. In 1918, he said, &quot;We have this wonderful store of folk music—the melodies of an enslaved people&quot; but it will be of no value if it is not used. We must treat spirituals &quot;in such manner that it can be presented in choral form, in lyric and operatic works, in concertos and suites and salon music&quot;. R. Nathaniel Dett was a mentor to Edward Boatner (1898–1981), an African American composer who wrote many popular concert arrangements of the spirituals. Boatner and Willa A. Townsend published &quot;Spirituals triumphant old and new&quot; in 1927. Boatner &quot;maintained the importance of authenticity regarding the collection and transcription of spirituals, but also clearly identified with the new, stylized and polished ways in which they were arranged and performed&quot;.

William L. Dawson (18761938), a composer, choir director, music professor, and musicologist, is known, among other accomplishments, for the world premiere by the Philadelphia Orchestra of his 1934 &quot;Negro Folk Symphony&quot; which was revised with added African rhythms in 1952 following Dawson&#x27;s trip to West Africa. One of his most popular spirituals is &quot;Ezekiel Saw the Wheel&quot;.

==Spirituals in contemporary life==
The Fisk Jubilee Singers continue to maintain their popularity in the 21st century with live performances in locations such as Grand Ole Opry House in 2019 in Nashville, Tennessee. In 2019 Tazewell Thompson presented an cappella musical entitled &quot;Jubilee&quot;, which is a tribute to the Fisk Jubilee Singers.

Spirituals remain a mainstay particularly in small black churches, often Baptist or Pentecostal, in the deep South.

The latter half of the 20th century saw a resurgence of the spiritual. This trend was impacted strongly by composers and musical directors such as Moses Hogan and Brazeal Dennard.

Arthur Jones founded &quot;The Spirituals Project&quot; at the University of Denver in 1999 to help keep alive the message and meaning of the songs that had moved from the fields of the South to the concert halls of the North.

Everett McCorvey founded The American Spiritual Ensemble in 1995, a group of about two dozen professional singers who tour performing spirituals in the United States and abroad. The group has produced several CDs, including &quot;The Spirituals&quot;, and is the focus of a public broadcasting documentary.

==Stylistic origins and qualities==
Qualities of the spirituals include mastery of the blending of voices, timing, and intonation.

Spirituals were originally unaccompanied monophonic songs. The tempo in some songs may be slowed down at times—&quot;ritardando&quot;—as in the case of &quot;sorrow songs&quot; and/or to showcase the &quot;beauty and blending of the voices&quot;.

Along with the &quot;solo call and unison response&quot;, songs may include &quot;overlapping layers, and spine-tingling falsetto humming.&quot;

Stylistic origins include African music, Christian hymns, work songs, field holler. Historian Jonathan Curiel also noted possible influences from Islamic music. According to a McGraw Hill publication for grade school, &quot;Spirituals were sung as lullabies and play songs. Some spirituals were adapted as work songs.

Black spirituals &quot;use of microtonally flatted notes, syncopation and counter-rhythms marked by handclapping in black spiritual performances.&quot; It &quot;stands out for the singers&#x27; striking vocal timbre that features shouting, exclamations of the word &quot;Glory!&quot; and raspy and shrill falsetto tones&quot;.

Numerous rhythmical and sonic elements of spirituals can be traced to African sources, including prominent use of the pentatonic scale (the black keys on the piano).

In his 1954 book &quot;Studies in African Music&quot;, Arthur Morris Jones (1889–1980), a missionary and ethnomusicologist, said that in African music, the &quot;complex interweaving of contrasting rhythmic patterns&quot; was central to African music, just as harmonies were valued in European music. Jones described the drum is the highest expression of rhythms, but they can also be produced through hand-clapping, stick-beating, rattles, and the &quot;pounding of pestles in a mortar&quot;.

Over time &quot;formal concert tradition has evolved,&quot; which included the work of the Hampton Singers under composer R. Nathaniel Dett.

In the 20th century, composers, such as Moses Hogan, Roland Carter, Jester Hairston, Brazeal Dennard and Wendell Whalum transformed the &quot;cappella arrangements of spirituals for choruses&quot; beyond its &quot;traditional folk song roots&quot;.

===Call and response===
University of Denver professor, Arthur Jones, who established &quot;The Spirituals Project in 1998, out of the university&#x27;s Lamont School of Music, described how coded words could be introduced in the call and response overlap, which only insiders aware of the encrypted message could understand. He described &quot;already existing spirituals&quot; were employed &quot;clandestinely&quot; as one of the many ways people used in their &quot;multilayered struggle for freedom.&quot;

===Sorrow songs===
Slave songs were called &quot;Sorrow Songs&quot; by W.E.B. Du Bois in his book, 1903 book, &quot;The Souls of Black Folk&quot;. Sorrow songs are spirituals, such as, &quot;Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child&quot;, and &quot;Nobody Knows the Trouble I&#x27;ve Seen&quot;—songs that are intense and melancholic—are sung at a slower pace.

===Jubilee songs===
The Fisk Jubilee Singers had been so successful that other groups were created to perform similar music. Over time the term &quot;jubilee&quot; was used to refer to other ensembles who sang the original group&#x27;s repertoire. In the early 1900s jubilee singers also referred to singers who performed gospel music, and hymns as well as spirituals. Examples of these early nineteenth century groups include the Norfolk Jubilee Quartet, the Utica Jubilee Singers, and the Tuskegee Institute Singers.

Jubilee songs, also known as &quot;camp meeting songs,&quot; such as and &quot;Fare Ye Well&quot; and &quot;Rocky my soul in the bosom of Abraham&quot; are fast-paced, &quot;rhythmic and often syncopated&quot;. Spiritual songs which looked forward to a time of future happiness, or deliverance from tribulation, were often known as &#x27;jubilees.

In some churches, such as the Pentecostal church in the 1910s and 1920s in New Orleans, there was no organ or choir and music was louder, more exuberant and included up tempo spirituals called &quot;jubilees&quot;. They &quot;used the drum, the cymbal, the tambourine, and the steel triangle. Everybody in there sang, and they clapped and stomped their feet, and sang with their whole bodies. They had a beat, a rhythm we held on to from slavery days, and their music was so strong and expressive.&quot;

===Freedom songs===
Frederick Douglass, an abolitionist and a former slave said that slave songs awakened him to the dehumanizing character of slavery, &quot;The mere recurrence, even now, afflicts my spirit, and while I am writing these lines, my tears are falling. To those songs I trace my first glimmering conceptions of the dehumanizing character of slavery. I can never get rid of that conception. Those songs still follow me, to deepen my hatred of slavery, and quicken my sympathies for my brethren in bonds.

In a 2017 &quot;PBS Newshour&quot;, segment entitled &quot;Singing in Slavery: Songs of Survival, Songs of Freedom&quot; said that, while it is &quot;has not been proven, it is believed&quot;—that &quot;Wade in the Water&quot; was one of the songs associated with the Underground Railroad—a network of secret routes and safe houses used by slaves in the United States to find freedom. warn slaves to get off the trail and into the water to prevent bloodhounds—used by the slavers—from following their trail.

Jones described how during the years of the Underground Railroad &quot;already existing spirituals&quot; were employed &quot;clandestinely&quot; as one of the many ways people used in their &quot;multilayered struggle for freedom.&quot; He described how coded words could be introduced in the call and response overlap, which only insiders aware of the encrypted message.

A collaborative production by Maryland Public Television, Maryland Historical Society, and Maryland State Archives entitled &quot;Pathways to Freedom: Maryland and the Underground Railroad&quot; had included a section on how songs that many slaves knew had &quot;secret meanings&quot; that they could be &quot;used to signal many things&quot;. Certain songs were believed to have contained explicit instructions to fugitive slaves on how to avoid capture and the route to take to successfully make their way to freedom. Other spirituals that some believe have coded messages include &quot;The Gospel Train&quot;, &quot;Song of the Free&quot;, and &quot;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot&quot;, &quot;Follow the Drinking Gourd&quot;. James Kelley in his 2008 article said that there is a lack of corroborating sources to prove that there is a coded message in &quot;Follow the Drinking Gourd&quot;.

One 1953 article by Sterling Brown said that there are scholars who &quot;believe that when the Negro sang of freedom, he meant only what the whites meant, namely freedom from sin.&quot; Brown said that, to an enslaved person freedom would also mean freedom from slavery. When the enslaved person sings, &quot;I been rebuked, I been scorned; done had a hard time sho&#x27;s you bawn,&quot; he is not only referring to freedom from sin but from physical bondage. Brown cited Douglass, saying that Canaan stood for Canada; and &quot;over and beyond hidden satire the songs also were grapevines for communications. Harriet Tubman, herself called the Moses of her people, has told us that &quot;Go Down Moses&quot; was tabu in the slave states, but the people sang it nonetheless.&quot;

A 2016 Library of Congress article said that Freedom songs and protest songs, such as, Bob Marley&#x27;s &quot;Redemption Song&quot; and Billy Bragg&#x27;s &quot;Sing their souls back home&#x27;&quot; were based on African American spirituals, and that became the musical backdrop of the call for democracy around the globe. Many of the freedom songs, such as &quot;Oh, Freedom!&quot; and &quot;Eyes on the Prize,&quot; that defined the Civil rights movement (1954–1968) were adapted from some of the early African American spirituals. Some such as, &quot;We Shall Overcome,&quot; combined the gospel hymn &quot;I&#x27;ll Overcome Someday&quot; with the spiritual &quot;I&#x27;ll Be all right.&quot;

===Work songs===
In the 1927 anthology, &quot;The American Songbag&quot;, compiled by Carl Sandburg (1878–1967), the American poet and folklorist, he wrote that &quot;Ain&#x27; Go&#x27;n&#x27; to Study War No Mo&#x27;&quot; was an example of a spiritual that African Americans used as work songs. He said, that, &quot;As the singers go on, hour by hour, they bring in lines from many other spirituals. The tempo is vital. Never actually monotonous. Never ecstatic, yet steady in its onflow, sure of its pulses. It is a work song-spiritual. War is pronounced &quot;wah&quot; or &quot;waw&quot; as if to rhyme with &quot;saw.&quot; Horse is &quot;hawss.&quot; And so on with Negro economy of vocables in speech and song.&quot;

===Field hollers===
Field holler music, also known as levee camp holler music, was an early form of African American music, described in the 19th century. Field hollers laid the foundations for the blues, spirituals, and eventually rhythm and blues. Field hollers, cries and hollers of the enslaved people and later sharecroppers working in cotton fields, prison chain gangs, railway gangs (gandy dancers) or turpentine camps were the precursor to the call and response of African American spirituals and gospel music, to jug bands, minstrel shows, stride piano, and ultimately to the blues, rhythm and blues, jazz and African American music in general.

==Derivatives==
Blues and gospel music are derivatives of African American spirituals.

===The blues===
In the early 1960s, &quot;Blues People&quot; by Amiri Baraka—the chosen name for LeRoi Jones (1934–2014)—provided a history of African Americans through their music, beginning with the spirituals to the blues. By 1967, Jones had become the main spokesperson for African American intellectuals, displacing James Baldwin, according to a 1965 review of &quot;Blues People&quot;.

The blues form originated in the 1860s in the Deep South—South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Texas—states that were most dependent on the slave labor on planations and that held the largest number of enslaved people. The form was collectively developed by generations and communities of enslaved African Americans starting as &quot;unaccompanied work-songs of the plantation culture&quot;. The historical roots of the blues have been traced farther back to West African sources by scholars such as Paul Oliver and Gerhard Kubik—with elements such as the &quot;responsorial &#x27;leader-and-chorus&#x27; form&quot;. The blues became the &quot;most extensively recorded of all traditional music types&quot; and since the &quot;early 1960s,—the &quot;most important single influence on the development of Western popular music,&quot; and are now widespread.
When Mamie Smith&#x27;s August 10, 1920, Okeh recording of the composer Perry Bradford&#x27;s (1893–1970) New York City &quot;Crazy Blues&quot; became a commercial success, it opened the commercial record market for music for an African American audience. Prior to the success of this recording, commercial recording companies featured non-African American musicians playing African-American music. Bradford&#x27;s African-American band, the Jazz Hounds, &quot;played live, improvised&quot;, &quot;unpredictable&quot;, &quot;breakneck&quot; music that was a &quot;refreshing contrast to the buttoned-up versions of the blues interpreted by white artists across the 1910s&quot;.

A 1976 book, &quot;Stomping the Blues&quot; by Albert Murray, said that this interaction between Christianity and African-American spirituals occurred only in the United States. Africans who converted to Christianity in other parts of the world, even in the Caribbean and Latin America, did not evolve this particular form.

===Gospel songs===
Sacred music includes both spirituals and gospel music, which &quot;originated in the black church and has become a globally recognized genre of popular music. In its earliest manifestations, gospel music functioned as an integral religious and ceremonial practice during worship services. Now, gospel music is also marketed commercially and draws on contemporary, secular sounds while still conveying spiritual and religious ideas.&quot;

Well-known gospel singer Mahalia Jackson (1911–1972) was one of Gospel music&#x27;s most prominent defenders. She said that, &quot;Blues are the songs of despair. Gospel songs are the songs of hope. When you sing gospel you have a feeling there&#x27;s a cure for what&#x27;s wrong. When you&#x27;re through with the blues you&#x27;ve got nothing to rest on.&quot; Horace Clarence Boyer traced the emergence of Gospel music as a &quot;discrete musical style&quot; to the Deep South in 1906 in Pentecostal churches. Through the Great Migration of African American from the south to the north, especially in the 1930s, gospel songs entered the &quot;mainstream of American popular culture&quot;. Gospel music had its heyday from 1945 to 1955—the &quot;Golden Age of Gospel.&quot;

Gospel Quartets, like the Golden Jubilee Quartet and the Golden Gate Quartet, changed the style of spirituals with their innovative, jubilee style which included new harmonies, syncopation with sophisticated arrangements. An example of their music was their performance of &quot;Oh, Jonah!&quot; The Golden Gate Quartet—who were active from 1934 to the late 1940s—performed in the concert &quot;From Spirituals to Swing&quot; at Carnegie Hall in the late 1930s. Zora Neale Hurston, in her 1938 book &quot;The Sanctified Church&quot;, criticized what she called &quot;Glee Club style&quot; of the Fisk Jubilee Singers, Tuskegee Institute Quartet, and Hampton Singers in the 1930s. She said they were using a style&quot; that was &quot;full of musicians&#x27; tricks&quot; that were not authentic to their roots in the original African American spirituals. The authentic spirituals could only be found in the &quot;unfashionable Negro church&quot;.

===White spirituals===
In his 1938 book, &quot;White Spirituals in the Southern Uplands&quot;, Vanderbilt University&#x27;s George Pullen Jackson in Nashville drew attention to the existence of a white spiritual genre which differed in many aspects from African American spirituals. The core of Jackson&#x27;s argument, however, supported by many musical examples, is that African-American spirituals draw heavily on textual and melodic elements found in white hymns and spiritual songs. Jackson extended the term &quot;spirituals&quot; to a wider range of folk hymnody but this does not appear to have been widespread usage previously. The term, however, has often been broadened to include subsequent arrangements into more standard European-American hymnodic styles, and to include post-emancipation songs with stylistic similarities to the original African American spirituals.

==Possible Islamic influences==
The historian Sylviane Diouf and ethnomusicologist Gerhard Kubik identify Islamic music as an influence. Diouf notes a resemblance between the Islamic call to prayer (originating from Bilal ibn Rabah, a famous Abyssinian African Muslim in the early 7th century) and 19th-century field holler music, noting that both have similar lyrics praising God, melody, note changes, &quot;words that seem to quiver and shake&quot; in the vocal chords, dramatic changes in musical scales, and nasal intonation. She attributes the origins of field holler music to African Muslim slaves who accounted for an estimated 30% of African slaves in America. According to Kubik, &quot;the vocal style of many blues singers using melisma, wavy intonation, and so forth is a heritage of that large region of West Africa that had been in contact with the Arabic-Islamic world of the Maghreb since the seventh and eighth centuries.&quot; There was particularly a significant trans-Saharan cross-fertilization between the musical traditions of the Maghreb and the Sahel.

There was a difference in the music performed by the predominantly Muslim Sahelian slaves and the predominantly non-Muslim slaves from coastal West Africa and Central Africa. The Sahelian Muslim slaves generally favored wind and string instruments and solo singing, whereas the non-Muslim slaves generally favored drums and group chants. Plantation owners who feared revolt outlawed drums and group chants, but allowed the Sahelian slaves to continue singing and playing their wind and string instruments, which the plantation owners found less threatening. According to Curiel stringed instruments these string instruments may have the precursor to the banjo. While many were pressured to convert to Christianity, the Sahelian slaves were allowed to maintain their musical traditions, adapting their skills to instruments such as the fiddle and guitar. Some were also allowed to perform at balls for slave-holders, allowing the migration of their music across the Deep South.

<text>In music, monophony is the simplest of musical textures, consisting of a melody (or &quot;tune&quot;), typically sung by a single singer or played by a single instrument player (e.g., a flute player) without accompanying harmony or chords. Many folk songs and traditional songs are monophonic. A melody is also considered to be monophonic if a group of singers (e.g., a choir) sings the same melody together at the unison (exactly the same pitch) or with the same melody notes duplicated at the octave (such as when men and women sing together). If an entire melody is played by two or more instruments or sung by a choir with a fixed interval, such as a perfect fifth, it is also said to be monophony (or &quot;monophonic&quot;). The musical texture of a song or musical piece is determined by assessing whether varying components are used, such as an accompaniment part or polyphonic melody lines (two or more independent lines).

In the Early Middle Ages, the earliest Christian songs, called plainchant (a well-known example is Gregorian chant), were monophonic. Even into the twenty-first century, songwriters still often write songs that intersperse sections using monophony, heterophony (two singers or instrumentalists doing varied versions of the same melody together), polyphony (two or more singers or instrumentalists playing independent melodic lines at the same time), homophony (a melody accompanied by chords), or monody (a single melodic line with instrumental accompaniment) elements throughout the melody to create different atmospheres and styles. Monophony may not have underlying rhythmic textures, and must consist of only a single melodic line.



==Western singing==
According to the modern medieval scholar Ardis Butterfield, monophony &quot;is the dominant mode of the European vernacular genres as well as of Latin song ... in polyphonic works, it remains a central compositional principle.&quot;

===Plainchant===
The earliest recorded Christian monophony was plainchant or plainsong (of which one well-known style was called Gregorian chant) a single unaccompanied vocal melody sung by monks. Sung by multiple voices in unison (i.e. the same pitch and rhythm), this music is still considered monophonic. Plainsong was the first and foremost musical style of Italy, Ireland, Spain, and France. In the early 9th century, the &quot;organum&quot; tradition developed by adding voices in parallel to plainchant melodies. The earliest organum merely augmented the texture of the melody by adding a second voice in parallel octaves or parallel fifths, which could still be considered monophonic; however, by the 11th century the organum had developed a style called &quot;free organum&quot; in which the voices were more independent, evolving into a polyphonic tradition.

===Plainchant styles===
Mozarabic chant, Byzantine Chant, Armenian chant, Beneventan chant, Ambrosian chant, Gregorian chant and others were various forms of plainsong which were all monophonic. Many of these monophonic chants were written down, and contain the earliest music notation to develop after the loss of the ancient Greek system. For example, &quot;Dodecachordon&quot; was published by the Swiss Renaissance composer Heinrich Glarean (also Glareanus) and included plainsong or Gregorian chant and monophony. The earliest manuscripts which contain plainsong were written in neumes, a primitive system which recorded only the outline of the melody, and it was not until the 11th century that Guido d&#x27;Arezzo invented a more modern musical notation system that the exact notes of the melodies were preserved.

===Troubador song monophony===
Most troubadour songs were monophonic. Troubadour songs were written from 1100–1350 and they were usually poems about chivalry or courtly love with the words set to a melody. Aristocratic troubadours and trouvères typically played in courtly performances for kings, queens, and countesses. Poets and composers in the 14th century produced many songs which can be seen as extensions of the Provençal troubador tradition, such as secular monophonic lais and virelais. Jehan de Lescurel (or Jehannot de l&#x27;Escurel), a poet and composer from northern French from the Trouvère style also wrote monophonic songs in the style of virelais, ballades, rondeaux and diz entés. Minnesänger were similar to the French style but in Middle High German.

=== Geisslerlieder or Flagellant songs ===
A tradition of Lauda, or sacred songs in the style of Troubador songs, was popularized in the 13th and 14th centuries by Geisslerlieder, or Flagellant songs. These monophonic Laude spirituale songs were used in the 13th and 17th century by flagellants, as recorded in the medieval chronicle &quot;Chronicon Hugonis sacerdotis de Rutelinga&quot; (1349).

=== Lutheran church chorale ===
Monophony was the first type of texture in the Lutheran Church. A well-known example is Martin Luther&#x27;s hymn &quot;Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott&quot; (&quot;A Mighty Fortress Is Our God&quot;), written as a monophonic tune sometime between 1527 and 1529. Many of Luther&#x27;s hymns were later harmonized for multiple voices by other composers, and were also used in other polyphonic music such as the cantatas of Johann Sebastian Bach.

==Monophony with instrumental doubling==
&quot;See Voicing (music)#Doubling&quot;

DeLone more loosely defines monophony as &quot;passages, movements, or sections in which notes sound alone, despite instrumental doubling&quot; even if &quot;such passages may involve several instruments or voices.&quot;

==Music of India==

Indian classical music is an ancient musical tradition where monophonic melodies called ragas are played over drones, sometimes accompanied by percussion and other accompaniment.
*Hindustani music from the North of India
*Carnatic music from the South of India, encompassing compositions in Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, Sanskrit, and Malayalam.

<doc id="185517" wikidata="Q6929202" url="?curid=185517" title="Mr. Snuffleupagus">
<text>Aloysius Snuffleupagus (), more commonly known as Mr. Snuffleupagus or Snuffy for short, is one of the characters on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, a PBS/HBO educational television program for young children. His head bears resemblances to giant anteaters and mammoths, but he has no tusks or (visible) ears. He also has a tail similar in shape to that of a dinosaur (like a sauropod; in particular, a &quot;Brontosaurus&quot;). He has thick, brown hair and a trunk, or &quot;snuffle&quot;, that drags along the ground. Snuffy is also Big Bird&#x27;s best friend, and has a younger sister named Alice.

==History==
For many years, only Big Bird would see Snuffy, because he would always leave while Big Bird went to get the others, leading everyone else to believe Snuffy was simply an imaginary friend, but after &quot;Sesame Street Presents: Follow That Bird&quot;, Big Bird finally succeeded in revealing Snuffy to his friends on Sesame Street. Before that, the main adult characters teased Big Bird when he said he had seen him, because they did not believe there was such an animal, often despite evidence to the contrary, such as an oversized teddy bear that Snuffy had left behind, or segments in which Snuffy interacted with other characters, such as a street scene where Snuffy was seen playing London Bridge with some of the neighborhood children. This was meant to echo the imaginary friends some young children have.

Snuffy&#x27;s original puppet was skinny and sunken, with an almond-shaped head and bulging green-and-yellow eyes. He also originally was perpetually depressed, speaking in a sad and echoey voice. This appearance was deemed to be somewhat frightening for younger children, so his eyes were made round and white, and his personality friendlier.

By the late 1970s, the storylines had the adult characters becoming increasingly frustrated with Big Bird using Snuffy as a scapegoat whenever something went wrong while they were out of the room. In one episode, newspapers on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; carried the front-page headline, &quot;Snuffy&#x27;s Got To Go!&quot; Some adults gradually began to believe Big Bird, the first being folk singer Buffy Sainte-Marie, who sang Big Bird a song about her belief in Snuffy. After Buffy&#x27;s departure from the show, Linda (Linda Bove), Maria (Sonia Manzano), and Gordon (Roscoe Orman) became believers in Snuffy&#x27;s existence, while the others remained skeptical about his existence.

In September 2014, Mr Snuffleupagus appeared on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; where he met his hero and purported relative, George Stephanopoulos. Stephanopoulos thanked Snuffy for &quot;helping a generation of Americans learn to pronounce his name.&quot;

==Meeting the adults==
This running gag of Snuffy not becoming visible to the adults ended with the Season 17 premiere of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, episode 2096 (first aired November 18, 1985, following the release of the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; film &quot;Sesame Street Presents: Follow That Bird&quot;). Big Bird is tired of the adults refusing to believe him about Snuffy, so he decides to arrange for them to come to his nest and meet Snuffy when he yells the signaling word, &quot;Food!&quot; He chooses this word because he knows the grown-ups will not believe him if he tells them his real reason for inviting them to his nest, and &quot;food&quot; is a more credible lure. When Big Bird calls out the word, Snuffy runs off to tell his mother about the meeting, so once again the grown-ups just miss him. Gordon, wanting to help, suggests to Big Bird that he needs someone to help him keep Snuffy in his nest, and Elmo offers to be the one. Snuffy returns, then tells Elmo he had better go home and brush his fur to prepare for the grown-ups&#x27; arrival, but Elmo holds on to his snuffle so he cannot go. Big Bird yells, &quot;Food!&quot; as a distraction, and one by one the adults come and see Snuffy for the first time ever. They are stunned, then cautiously approach, before Big Bird returns overjoyed. Susan (Loretta Long) apologizes on behalf of the adults for disbelieving Big Bird for so long. Bob (Bob McGrath) then tells him, &quot;From now on, we&#x27;ll believe you whenever you tell us something.&quot; (Snuffy tells Big Bird they should get what Bob said in writing.) Linda (Linda Bove) then suggests that Big Bird introduce Snuffy to everyone one by one. Then-popular talk show host Phil Donahue, appearing as himself on the episode, was also introduced to Snuffy. The entire &quot;Sesame Street&quot; cast henceforth sees Snuffy regularly on the show.

In an interview on the show &quot;Still Gaming&quot;, Snuffy&#x27;s performer, Martin P. Robinson, revealed that Snuffy was finally introduced to the main human cast mainly due to a string of high-profile and sometimes graphic stories of pedophilia and sexual abuse of children that aired on &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. According to Carol-Lynn Parente, the writers felt that by having the adults refuse to believe Big Bird, they were scaring children into thinking that their parents would not believe them if they had been abused and that they would just be better off remaining silent. On the same telethon, during Robinson&#x27;s explanation, Loretta Long uttered the words &quot;Bronx daycare&quot;, a reference to reports on New York TV station WNBC-TV of alleged sexual abuse at a Bronx daycare center. This was seen in the documentary &quot;Sesame Street Unpaved&quot;.

==Spelling==

According to sources such as the Sesame Workshop Web site and &quot;Sesame Street Unpaved&quot;, the character&#x27;s name is spelled &quot;Snuffleupagus&quot;. From the 1970s until the late 1980s, it was frequently hyphened, resulting in &quot;Snuffle-upagus&quot;. Many licensors, closed-captioners, and fans (including websites) use spelling variations. The Jim Henson Company website has used the version &quot;Snuffulupagus&quot;.

==Performers==
Snuffy was first performed by Jerry Nelson, then Michael Earl, and currently Martin P. Robinson. His back end has been performed by Richard Hunt, Brian Meehl, Frank Kane, and currently Bryant Young.

<text>The Concert for Bangladesh (or Bangla Desh, as the country&#x27;s name was originally spelt) was a pair of benefit concerts organised by former Beatles guitarist George Harrison and the Indian sitar player Ravi Shankar. The shows were held at 2:30 and 8:00pm on Sunday, 1 August 1971, at Madison Square Garden in New York City, to raise international awareness of, and fund relief for refugees from East Pakistan, following the Bangladesh Liberation War-related genocide and the 1970 Bhola cyclone. The concerts were followed by a bestselling live album, a boxed three-record set, and Apple Films&#x27; concert documentary, which opened in cinemas in the spring of 1972.

The event was the first-ever benefit of such a magnitude, and featured a supergroup of performers that included Harrison, fellow ex-Beatle Ringo Starr, Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, Billy Preston, Leon Russell and the band Badfinger. In addition, Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan – both of whom had ancestral roots in Bangladesh – performed an opening set of Indian classical music. The concerts were attended by a total of 40,000 people, and the initial gate receipts raised close to $250,000 for Bangladesh relief, which was administered by UNICEF.

After collecting the musicians easily, Harrison found it extremely difficult to get the recording industry to release the rights for performers to share the stage, and millions of dollars raised from the album and film were tied up in IRS tax escrow accounts for years, but the concert has been recognised as a highly successful and influential humanitarian aid project, generating both awareness and considerable funds as well as providing valuable lessons and inspiration for projects that followed, such as Live Aid.

By 1985, through revenue raised from the &quot;Concert for Bangladesh&quot; live album and film, an estimated $12 million had been sent to Bangladesh, and sales of the live album and DVD release of the film continue to benefit the George Harrison Fund for UNICEF. Decades later, Shankar would say of the overwhelming success of the event: &quot;In one day, the whole world knew the name of Bangladesh. It was a fantastic occasion.&quot;

==Background==

As East Pakistan struggled to become the separate state of Bangladesh during the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War, the political and military turmoil and associated atrocities led to a massive refugee problem, with almost 10 million displaced people pouring into neighbouring India. East Pakistan had recently in 1970, endured devastation as a result of the Bhola cyclone, and the Bengalis&#x27; desperate plight increased in March that year when torrential rains and floods arrived in the region, threatening a humanitarian disaster. Quoting figures available at the time, a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; feature claimed that up to half a million Bengalis had been killed by the cyclone in November 1970 and that the Pakistani army&#x27;s subsequent campaign of slaughter under Operation Searchlight accounted for at least 250,000 civilians, &quot;by the most conservative estimates&quot;. Following the mass exodus to Calcutta, a new threat arrived as the refugees faced starvation and the outbreak of diseases such as cholera.
Appalled at the situation affecting his homeland and relatives, Bengali musician Ravi Shankar first brought the issue to the attention of his friend George Harrison in the early months of 1971, over dinner at Friar Park, according to Klaus Voormann&#x27;s recollection. By April, Shankar and Harrison were in Los Angeles working on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Raga&quot;, during which Harrison wrote the song &quot;Miss O&#x27;Dell&quot;, commenting on corruption among the Indian authorities as aid shipments of rice from the West kept &quot;going astray on [their] way to Bombay&quot;. After returning to England to produce Badfinger&#x27;s &quot;Straight Up&quot; album and take part in sessions for John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Imagine&quot; – all the while, being kept abreast of developments by Shankar, via newspaper and magazine cuttings – Harrison was back in Los Angeles to finish the &quot;Raga&quot; album in late June. By then, the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; in London had just published an influential article by Pakistani journalist Anthony Mascarenhas, which exposed the full horror of the Bangladesh atrocities, and a distraught Shankar approached Harrison for help in trying to alleviate the suffering. Harrison later talked of spending &quot;three months&quot; on the phone organising the Concert for Bangladesh, implying that efforts were under way from late April onwards; it is now widely acknowledged that the project began in earnest during the last week of June 1971, however, five or six weeks before the event took place on 1 August.

==Preparation==

Shankar&#x27;s original hope was to raise $25,000 through a benefit concert of his own, compered perhaps by actor Peter Sellers. With Harrison&#x27;s commitment, and the record and film outlets available to him through the Beatles&#x27; Apple Corps organisation, the idea soon grew to become a star-studded musical event, mixing Western rock with Indian classical music, and it was to be held at the most prestigious venue in America: Madison Square Garden, in New York City. According to Chris O&#x27;Dell, a music-business administrator and former Apple employee, Harrison got off the phone with Shankar once the concept had been finalised, and started enthusing with his wife, Pattie Boyd, about possible performers. Ringo Starr, Lennon, Eric Clapton, Leon Russell, Jim Keltner, Voormann, Billy Preston and Badfinger were all mentioned during this initial brainstorming.
O&#x27;Dell set about contacting local musicians from the Harrisons&#x27; rented house in Nichols Canyon, as Harrison took the long-distance calls, hoping more than anything to secure Bob Dylan&#x27;s participation. Almost all of Harrison&#x27;s first-choice names signed on immediately, while a day spent boating with Memphis musician Don Nix resulted in the latter agreeing to organise a group of backing singers. A local Indian astrologer had advised early August as a good time in which to stage the concert, and as things transpired, the first day of that month, a Sunday, was the only day that Madison Square Garden was available at such short notice.
By the first week of July, Harrison was in a Los Angeles studio recording his purpose-written song, &quot;Bangla Desh&quot;, with co-producer Phil Spector. The song&#x27;s opening verse documents Shankar&#x27;s plea to Harrison for assistance, and the lyrics &quot;My friend came to me with sadness in his eyes / Told me that he wanted help before his country dies&quot; provided an enduring image for what United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan later recognised as the basic human aspect behind the cause.

Harrison then met with Badfinger in London to explain that he would have to abandon work on &quot;Straight Up&quot;, before flying to New York on 13 July to see Lennon. During the middle of July also, once back in Los Angeles, Harrison produced Shankar&#x27;s Bangladesh benefit record, an EP titled &quot;Joi Bangla&quot;. The latter featured contributions from East Bengal-born Ali Akbar Khan, on sarod, and tabla player Alla Rakha. As with Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Bangla Desh&quot;, all profits from this recording would go to the newly established George Harrison–Ravi Shankar Special Emergency Relief Fund, to be distributed by UNICEF. Also around the middle of July, the upcoming concert by &quot;George Harrison and Friends&quot; was announced &quot;via a minuscule ad buried in the back pages of the &quot;New York Times&quot;&quot;, author Nicholas Schaffner wrote in 1977. Tickets sold out in no time, leading to the announcement of a second show.

Towards the end of the month, when all parties were due to meet in New York for rehearsals, Harrison had the commitment of a backing band comprising Preston on keyboards, the four members of Badfinger on acoustic rhythm guitars and tambourine, Voormann and Keltner, on bass and drums, respectively, and saxophonist Jim Horn&#x27;s so-called &quot;Hollywood Horns&quot;, which included Chuck Findley, Jackie Kelso and Lou McCreary. Of the established stars, Leon Russell had committed also, but on the proviso that he be supported by members of his tour band. Eric Clapton insisted that he too would be there, even though O&#x27;Dell and other insiders, knowing of the guitarist&#x27;s incapacity due to severe heroin addiction, were surprised that Harrison had considered him for the occasion.

Among Harrison&#x27;s former bandmates, Lennon initially agreed to take part in the concert without his wife and musical partner Yoko Ono, as Harrison had apparently stipulated. Lennon then allegedly had an argument with Ono as a result of this agreement and left New York in a rage two days before the concerts. Starr&#x27;s commitment had never been in question, and he interrupted the filming of his movie &quot;Blindman&quot; in Almeria, Spain, in order to attend. Paul McCartney declined to take part, however, citing the bad feelings caused by the Beatles&#x27; legal problems on their break-up.

==Rehearsals==
The Harrisons decamped to the Park Lane Hotel in New York City, and the first rehearsal took place on Monday, 26 July, at Nola Studios on West 57th Street. Harrison had written a possible setlist for the concert while sketching design ideas for Shankar&#x27;s &quot;Joi Bangla&quot; picture sleeve. As well as the songs he would go on to perform on 1 August, Harrison&#x27;s list included his own compositions &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; – &quot;with Leon [Russell]&quot;, apparently – &quot;Art of Dying&quot; and the just-recorded B-side &quot;Deep Blue&quot;; Clapton&#x27;s song &quot;Let It Rain&quot; appeared also, while the suggestions for Dylan&#x27;s set were &quot;If Not for You&quot;, &quot;Watching the River Flow&quot; (his recent, Leon Russell-produced single) and &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot;. Only Harrison, Voormann, the six-piece horn section, and Badfinger&#x27;s Pete Ham, Joey Molland, Tom Evans and Mike Gibbins were at Nola Studios on that first day, and subsequent rehearsals were similarly carried out in &quot;dribs and drabs&quot;, as Harrison put it. Only the final run-through, on the night before the concert, resembled a complete band rehearsal.
On Tuesday, 27 July, Harrison and Shankar, accompanied by a pipe-smoking Allen Klein, held a press conference to promote the two shows; notoriously performance-shy, Harrison said &quot;Just thinking about it makes me shake.&quot; The &quot;Bangla Desh&quot; charity single was issued in America on 28 July, with a UK release following two days later. Ringo Starr arrived on the Thursday, and by Friday, 30 July, Russell was in town, interrupting his US tour. Russell&#x27;s band members Claudia Lennear and Don Preston were added to Don Nix&#x27;s choir of backing singers; Preston would switch to lead guitar for Russell&#x27;s solo spot during the shows, just as bassist Carl Radle would replace Voormann temporarily. By this point, Clapton&#x27;s participation was gravely in doubt, and Harrison had drafted in Jesse Ed Davis as a probable replacement. The ex-Taj Mahal guitarist received last-minute coaching from Voormann, who was more than familiar with Harrison&#x27;s songs, as well as those by Billy Preston and Starr.&lt;ref name=&quot;Klaus/Scorsese&quot;&gt;Klaus Voormann interview, in &quot;George Harrison: Living in the Material World&quot; DVD, 2011 (directed by Martin Scorsese; produced by Olivia Harrison, Nigel Sinclair &amp; Martin Scorsese).&lt;/ref&gt;

The final rehearsal, the first for some of the participants, was combined with the concert soundcheck, at Madison Square Garden, late on 31 July. Both Dylan and Clapton finally appeared at the soundcheck that night. Even then, Clapton was in the early stages of heroin withdrawal – only a cameraman supplying him with some methadone would result in the English guitarist taking the stage the following day, after his then-girlfriend Alice Ormsby-Gore had been unsuccessful in purchasing uncut heroin for him on the street. To Harrison&#x27;s frustration, Dylan was having severe doubts about performing in such a big-event atmosphere and still would not commit to playing. &quot;Look, it&#x27;s not my scene, either,&quot; Harrison countered. &quot;At least you&#x27;ve played on your own in front of a crowd before. I&#x27;ve never done that.&quot;

Through Harrison&#x27;s friendship with the Band, Jonathan Taplin served as production manager, while Chip Monck was in charge of lighting. Gary Kellgren from the nearby Record Plant was brought in to record the concerts, overseen by Spector, and &quot;Klein&#x27;s people&quot;, led by director Saul Swimmer, would handle the filming of the event. The official concert photographers were Tom Wilkes and Barry Feinstein, the pair responsible for the artwork on Harrison&#x27;s acclaimed 1970 triple album, &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;.

Stephen Stills, having proceeded to sell out Madison Square Garden two days before the concert on 30 July, in support of his album, &quot;Stephen Stills 2&quot;, allowed Harrison to use his stage, sound, lighting system and production manager but was upset when Harrison &quot;neglected to invite him to perform, mention his name, or say thank you&quot;. Stills then spent the show drunk in Ringo Starr&#x27;s dressing room, &quot;barking at everyone&quot;.

==Concert programme==
===Afternoon show===
Except for brief support roles in December 1969 for both the Delaney &amp; Bonnie and Friends band and Lennon&#x27;s Plastic Ono Band, the Concert for Bangladesh was Harrison&#x27;s first live appearance before a paying audience since the Beatles had quit touring in August 1966. Dylan had stopped touring that same year, although he had made a moderately successful comeback in August 1969 at the Isle of Wight Festival, his most recent live performance at this point. Speaking in 2005, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; founder Jann Wenner described the &quot;buzz&quot; preceding the first Concert for Bangladesh show as being at a level unexperienced in New York since the Beatles&#x27; 1966 visit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wenner/CFBD Revisited interviews&quot;&gt;Interview with Jann Wenner, in &quot;The Concert for Bangladesh Revisited&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;
In his role as master of ceremonies, Harrison began the afternoon show by asking the audience to &quot;try to get into&quot; the opening, Indian music portion of the programme. He then introduced Ravi Shankar and the latter&#x27;s fellow musicians – sarodya Ali Akbar Khan, tabla player Alla Rakha, and Kamala Chakravarty on tamboura. Shankar first explained the reason for the concerts, after which the four musicians performed a traditional dhun, in the format of a khyal rather than a standard raga, titled &quot;Bangla Dhun&quot;. Their set included a second piece, authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter suggest, citing Harrison&#x27;s own description that each show&#x27;s Indian music segment lasted for three-quarters of an hour, whereas only seventeen minutes of music appears on the &quot;Concert for Bangladesh&quot; live album. The recital was afforded a &quot;fidgety respect&quot; from fans eager to discover the identity of Harrison&#x27;s advertised &quot;Friends&quot;, although the audience&#x27;s goodwill was more than evident. A short intermission ensued while the stage was cleared and a Dutch TV film was shown, displaying footage of the atrocities and natural tragedies taking place in former East Pakistan.
To thunderous applause from the New York crowd, Harrison appeared on stage along with his temporary band, comprising Ringo Starr, a very sick Eric Clapton, Leon Russell, Billy Preston, Klaus Voormann, Jim Keltner and eighteen others. Backed by this &quot;full Phil Spector/&quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; rock orchestra&quot;, Harrison began the Western portion of the concert with &quot;Wah-Wah&quot;, followed by his Beatles hit song&#x27; &quot;Something&quot; and the gospel-rocker &quot;Awaiting on You All&quot;. Harrison then handed the spotlight over to Preston, who performed his only sizeable hit (thus far), &quot;That&#x27;s the Way God Planned It&quot;, followed by Starr, whose song &quot;It Don&#x27;t Come Easy&quot; had recently established the drummer as a solo artist. Nicholas Schaffner was in the audience for this first show and later described Starr&#x27;s turn as having received the &quot;biggest ovation&quot; of the afternoon.
Next up was Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Beware of Darkness&quot;, with guest vocals on the third verse by Russell, who covered the song on his concurrent album, &quot;Leon Russell and the Shelter People&quot; (1971). After pausing to introduce the band, Harrison followed this with one of the best-received moments in both the shows – a charging version of the White Album track &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;, featuring him and Clapton &quot;duelling&quot; on lead guitar during the long instrumental playout. Both the band introduction and &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; are among the few selections from the afternoon show that were included on the album and in the film. Another one was Leon Russell&#x27;s medley of the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jack Flash&quot; and the Coasters&#x27; &quot;Young Blood&quot;, which was also a highlight of Russell&#x27;s live shows at the time. With Don Preston crossing the stage to play lead guitar with Harrison, there were now temporarily four electric guitarists in the line-up. Don Preston, Harrison and Claudia Lennear supplied supporting vocals behind Russell.

In an effective change of pace, Harrison picked up his acoustic guitar, now alone on the stage save for Pete Ham on a second acoustic, and Don Nix&#x27;s gospel choir, off to stage-left. The ensuing &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; – the first live performance of the song – was also warmly received. At this point, Harrison switched back to his white Fender Stratocaster electric guitar and, as recounted to Anthony DeCurtis in 1987, he looked down at the setlist taped to the body of the guitar and saw the word &quot;Bob&quot; followed by a question mark. &quot;And I looked around,&quot; Harrison recalled of Bob Dylan&#x27;s entrance, &quot;and &quot;he&quot; was so nervous – he had his guitar on and his shades – he was sort of coming on, coming &quot;[pumps his arms and shoulders]&quot; ... It was only at that moment that I knew for sure he was going to do it.&quot; Among the audience, Schaffner wrote, there was &quot;total astonishment&quot; at this new arrival.

As Harrison had envisaged, Dylan&#x27;s mini-set was the crowning glory of the Concert for Bangladesh for many observers. Backed by just Harrison, Russell (now playing Voormann&#x27;s Fender Precision bass) and Starr on tambourine, Dylan played five of his decade-defining songs from the 1960s: &quot;A Hard Rain&#x27;s A-Gonna Fall&quot;, &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot;, &quot;It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry&quot;, &quot;Love Minus Zero/No Limit&quot; and &quot;Just Like a Woman&quot;.

Harrison and the band then returned to perform a final segment, consisting of &quot;Hear Me Lord&quot; and his recent international number one hit, &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;, followed by the song of the moment – &quot;Bangla Desh&quot;.

===Evening show===
Harrison was reportedly delighted with the outcome of the first show, as was Dylan, who accompanied him back to the Park Lane Hotel afterwards. They discussed possible changes to the setlist for the evening performance, beginning at 8 pm.

The songs played and their sequence differed slightly between the first and second shows, most noticeably with Harrison&#x27;s opening and closing mini-sets. After &quot;Wah-Wah&quot;, he brought &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; forward in the order, followed by &quot;Awaiting on You All&quot;, before handing it over to Billy Preston. The afternoon&#x27;s &quot;creaky&quot; &quot;Hear Me Lord&quot; was dropped, so that the post-Dylan band segment consisted of only two numbers: &quot;Something&quot;, to close the show, and a particularly passionate reading of &quot;Bangla Desh&quot;, as an encore. Dylan likewise made some changes, swapping &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot; and &quot;It Takes a Lot to Laugh&quot; in the order, and then playing a well-received &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; in place of &quot;Love Minus Zero&quot;.

The second show was widely acknowledged as superior to the afternoon performance, although &quot;Village Voice&quot; reviewer Don Heckman noted that many in the audience reacted to the Shankar–Khan opening set with a lack of respect. Not aiding the Indian musicians was the failure of a microphone on Rakha&#x27;s hand drums, Heckman observed, so denying the crowd a vital element of the musical interplay between sitar and sarod.
During the Western portion of the show, Harrison&#x27;s voice was more confident this time around, the music &quot;perhaps slightly more lustrous&quot;, according to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. Towards the end of &quot;That&#x27;s the Way God Planned It&quot;, Preston felt compelled to get up from behind his Hammond organ and take a show-stealing boogie across the front of the stage.

Dylan&#x27;s walk-on was again the show&#x27;s &quot;real cortex-snapping moment&quot;, Heckman opined. Dylan finished his final song, &quot;Just Like a Woman&quot;, with a victorious salute – &quot;holding up both fists like a strongman&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s reviewer remarked shortly afterwards. Following Dylan&#x27;s set, Harrison introduced the band, before taking the show &quot;to yet another peak&quot; with &quot;Something&quot;. Watching from the wings, Pattie Harrison described her husband&#x27;s performance throughout that evening as &quot;magnificent&quot;.
Following the two sellout concerts, all the participants attended a celebratory party in a basement club known as Ungano&#x27;s. Dylan was so elated, Harrison recalled 16 years later, &quot;He picked me up and hugged me and he said, &#x27;God! If only we&#x27;d done &quot;three&quot; shows!&#x27;&quot; Like Harrison, the experience of playing at Madison Square that day did not lead to Dylan immediately re-embracing the concert stage; only a brief guest appearance with the Band on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1971–72 and sitting in during a John Prine club gig eventuated before he returned to touring in January 1974.

The post-concert party featured live performances from Harrison and Preston, after which a &quot;roaring drunk&quot; Phil Spector played a &quot;unique&quot; version of &quot;Da Doo Ron Ron&quot;. The celebrations broke up in the early hours once Keith Moon of the Who began smashing up the drum kit, which actually belonged to Badfinger&#x27;s Mike Gibbins.

==Reviews==
Harrison&#x27;s manager, Allen Klein, immediately boasted of the entirely peaceful nature of the event: &quot;There was no rioting. Not one policeman was allowed in there ... Zero!&quot; In fact, as reported in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; on 12 August, midway through the evening show, a crowd of 200 non-ticket-holders charged and broke through the doors of Madison Square Garden. Aside from this episode, press reports concerning the Concert for Bangladesh shows were overwhelmingly positive.

The appearance of Bob Dylan on the same stage as two former Beatles caused a sensation, and lavish praise was bestowed on George Harrison. &quot;Beatlemania Sweeps a City!&quot; was a typical headline, and in Britain the &quot;NME&quot; declared the concerts &quot;The Greatest Rock Spectacle of the Decade!&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; described the artists&#x27; performances as &quot;their best music ever&quot; and commented on the likelihood of a live album from the concerts: &quot;there is no politics involved. What is involved is starving children and for once, relief through 35 musicians who should represent the feeling of anyone who loves their music.&quot;

Dylan&#x27;s choice of songs, particularly the &quot;apocalyptic&quot; &quot;A Hard Rain&#x27;s A-Gonna Fall&quot;, were found to have a new relevance in the context of the early 1970s – the words made &quot;the more chilling for the passage of years&quot;, opined &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. The same publication stated of Starr&#x27;s contribution: &quot;Seeing Ringo Starr drumming and singing on stage has a joy in it that is one of the happiest feelings on earth still.&quot; Ravi Shankar&#x27;s role as concert instigator and the true conscience of the UNICEF shows was also noted. Musically, &quot;The Village Voice&quot; observed, the pairing of Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan was &quot;almost as unique as the mix of Dylan and Harrison&quot;.

In the wider countercultural context of the time, with disillusion increasingly rife with each post-Woodstock rock event, commentators viewed the concerts as, in the words of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;a brief incandescent revival of all that was best about the Sixties&quot;. Writing in 1981, &quot;NME&quot; critic Bob Woffinden likened it to a &quot;rediscovery of faith&quot;, adding: &quot;Harrison had put rock music back on course.&quot;

Among Harrison&#x27;s biographers, Alan Clayson describes the 1971–72 period covering the concerts and their associated releases as &quot;the George Harrison Moment&quot;, while Gary Tillery states: &quot;The Concert for Bangladesh sealed Harrison&#x27;s stature as something more than just a major celebrity ... He changed the perception of recording artists, making it clear they could be good world citizens too – willing to set aside their egos and paychecks in order to help people who were suffering.&quot; According to Niaz Alam, writing in the &quot;Dhaka Tribune&quot;, &quot;On artistic merit alone, as encapsulated in the film and LP, the Concert for Bangladesh perhaps holds up better than Woodstock in showcasing the best of its era in terms of music, optimism, and goodwill.&quot;

==Aftermath==

Politically, as Bangladeshi historian Farida Majid would note, the &quot;warmth, care and goodwill&quot; of the August 1971 concerts &quot;echoed all over the world&quot;, inspiring volunteers to approach UNICEF and offer their assistance, as well as eliciting private donations to the Bangladesh disaster fund. Although the altruistic spirit would soon wane once more, the Concert for Bangladesh is invariably seen as the inspiration and model for subsequent rock charity benefits, from 1985&#x27;s Live Aid and Farm Aid to the Concert for New York City and Live 8 in the twenty-first century. Unlike those later concerts, which benefitted from continuous media coverage of the causes they supported, the Harrison–Shankar project was responsible for identifying the problem and establishing Bangladesh&#x27;s plight in the minds of mainstream Western society. According to Gary Tillery: &quot;Because of its positioning as a humanitarian effort, all descriptions of the show included a summary of the catastrophe in South Asia. Overnight, because of their fascination with rock stars, masses of people became educated about geopolitical events they had not even been aware of the week before. The tragedy in Bangladesh moved to the fore as an international issue.&quot; One of these revelations was that America was supplying weaponry and financial aid to the Pakistani army, led by General Yahya Khan.
Harrison&#x27;s musical biographer, Simon Leng, identifies friendship as the key factor behind the success of the two UNICEF shows, both in bringing all the participants together on the stage and in the affection with which the audience and music critics viewed the event. Klaus Voormann, a close friend of Harrison&#x27;s since 1960, has often cited this quality as well.

Friendship played out through the next, significantly more lucrative stages of the Bangladesh relief project, as the associated live album and concert film were prepared for release. Harrison had assured all the main performers that their appearance would be removed from these releases if the event turned out &quot;lousy&quot;, to save anyone having to risk possible embarrassment. Having sent out personalised letters of thanks to all the participants on 1 September, he expressed his gratitude further by guesting on Billy Preston&#x27;s first album on A&amp;M Records that autumn and donating a new song to Jesse Ed Davis.

Around the same time, there were rumours of a possible repeat of the New York concerts, to be held at London&#x27;s Wembley Stadium in early October. Harrison and Klein quashed the idea, but an English version of the Concert for Bangladesh did take place, at The Oval in south London on 18 September. Titled &quot;Goodbye to Summer – a rock concert in aid of famine relief of Bangla Desh&quot;, it included performances by the Who, the Faces, Mott the Hoople, America, Lindisfarne and Quintessence. Bangladesh refugees were also one of several charitable causes supported at the Weeley Festival, held near Clacton-on-Sea in Essex in late August.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alam/DhakaTribune&quot;&gt;Niaz Alam, &quot;All the Concert(s) for Bangladesh&quot;, &quot;Dhaka Tribune&quot;, 28 November 2019 (retrieved 1 February 2021).&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 September, George and Pattie Harrison arrived home in the UK, with mixing having been completed on the upcoming live album, and Harrison due to meet with Patrick Jenkin of the British Treasury, to deal with the unforeseen obstacle of purchase tax being levied on the album. This was one of a number of problems that hindered Harrison&#x27;s Bangladesh project following the Madison Square Garden shows, and the British politician would allegedly tell him: &quot;Sorry! It is all very well for your high ideals, but Britain equally needs the money!&quot;
On 5 June 1972, in recognition of their &quot;pioneering&quot; fundraising efforts for the refugees of Bangladesh, George Harrison, Ravi Shankar and Allen Klein were jointly honoured by UNICEF with its &quot;Child Is the Father of the Man&quot; award. In December 2008, seven years after Harrison&#x27;s death, the BBC reported that moves were under way in the Bangladeshi High Court to have Harrison officially recognised and honoured as a hero for his role during the troubled birth of the nation.

Writing in 2003, author Bill Harry bemoaned the lack of recognition afforded Harrison in the UK honours system for his staging of the Concert for Bangladesh. Harry said that, given the influence of the event and Harrison&#x27;s other charitable activities, and also how his company HandMade Films &quot;virtually revived the British film industry&quot;, it was &quot;difficult to equate&quot; his MBE status (which he gained in 1965 as a member of the Beatles) with the knighthoods or other higher orders lavished on the likes of Bob Geldof, comedians, pop stars and other figures in the music business.

==Funds and controversy==

The two Madison Square Garden shows raised US$243,418.50, which was given to UNICEF to administer on 12 August 1971. By December, Capitol Records presented a cheque to Apple Corps for around $3,750,000 for advance sales of the &quot;Concert for Bangladesh&quot; live album.

Aside from complaints regarding the high retail price for the three-record set, particularly in Britain – a result of the government&#x27;s refusal to waive its tax surcharge – controversy soon surrounded the project&#x27;s fundraising. Most importantly, Klein had failed to register the event as a UNICEF benefit beforehand, and it was subsequently denied tax-exempt status by the US Government. As a result, most of the money was held in an Internal Revenue Service escrow account for ten years. In an interview with Derek Taylor for his autobiography in the late 1970s, Harrison put this figure at between $8 million and $10 million. Before then, in early 1972, &quot;New York&quot; magazine reported that some of the proceeds remained unaccounted for and had found their way into Klein&#x27;s accounts. Klein responded by suing the magazine for $150 million in damages, and although the suit was later withdrawn, the accusations attracted unwelcome scrutiny at a time when questions were also being asked about Klein&#x27;s mismanagement of the Beatles&#x27; finances. That year, an estimated $2 million had gone to the refugees via UNICEF before the IRS audit of Apple got under way; finally, in 1981, $8.8 million was added to that total following the audit.

By June 1985, according to an article in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, nearly $12 million had been sent to Bangladesh for relief.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnston/LA Times&quot;&gt;David Johnston, &quot;Bangladesh: The Benefit That Almost Wasn&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, 2 June 1985, p. R3.&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, according to music journalist Mikal Gilmore, Harrison gave Geldof &quot;meticulous advice&quot; to ensure that Live Aid&#x27;s estimated £50 million found its way, as intended, to victims of the Ethiopian famine. In an interview to promote the 1991 CD release of &quot;The Concert for Bangladesh&quot;, Harrison said that $13.5 million had been raised in the early 1970s, from the concert and the accompanying album and film. He added that, while this figured paled in comparison to ventures such as Live Aid, &quot;you have to remember, that was at a time when nobody was really aware of this kind of benefit concert, certainly there hadn&#x27;t been anything like that, and, of course, $13.5 million back then was probably much more than it&#x27;s worth now.&quot;

Speaking in the 1990s, Harrison said of the Bangladesh relief effort: &quot;Now it&#x27;s all settled and the UN own the rights to it themselves, and I think there&#x27;s been about 45 million dollars made.&quot; Sales of the DVD and CD of the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh continue to benefit the cause, now known as the George Harrison Fund for UNICEF.

==In popular culture==
The Concert for Bangladesh was satirised in two episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;: &quot;Like Father, Like Clown&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m with Cupid&quot;. In the former, Krusty plays the album while a visitor at the Simpsons household. In &quot;I&#x27;m with Cupid&quot;, Apu&#x27;s record collection contains &quot;The Concert Against Bangladesh&quot;, which features a picture of a mushroom cloud on the cover, reflecting contemporary Indian−Pakistani nuclear rivalry in the region.

The July 1974 (&quot;Dessert&quot;) issue of &quot;National Lampoon&quot; magazine satirised Tom Wilkes&#x27; original cover design for &quot;The Concert for Bangladesh&quot;, by using a chocolate version of the starving child, the head of which has had a bite taken out of it. Two years before this, the National Lampoon team spoofed Harrison&#x27;s humanitarian role on record, in their track &quot;The Concert in Bangla Desh&quot; on the &quot;Radio Dinner&quot; album. In the sketch, two Bangladeshi stand-up comedians (played by Tony Hendra and Christopher Guest) perform to starving refugees in an attempt to collect a bowlful of rice so that &quot;George Harrison&quot; can mount a hunger strike.

Crowd noises from the Concert for Bangladesh were put into Aerosmith&#x27;s cover of &quot;Train Kept A-Rollin&#x27;&quot; by producer Jack Douglas. Some of stills photographer Barry Feinstein&#x27;s shots from the 1971 concerts were used on the covers of subsequent albums by the participating artists, notably the compilations &quot;Bob Dylan&#x27;s Greatest Hits Vol. II&quot; and &quot;The History of Eric Clapton&quot;.

Harrison himself sent up the benefit-show concept on film, in the 1985 HandMade comedy &quot;Water&quot;. At the so-called Concert for Cascara, he, Starr, Clapton, Jon Lord and others make a surprise appearance on stage, supposedly before the United Nations General Assembly, performing the song &quot;Freedom&quot;.

<doc id="185520" wikidata="Q8033759" url="?curid=185520" title="Wool classing">
<text>Wool classing is the production of uniform, predictable, low-risk lines of wool, carried out by examining the characteristics of the wool in its raw state and classing (grading) it accordingly. Wool classing is done by a wool classer.

==Basis for classification== 
Some of the qualities a wool classer examines when classing wool are:
* &quot;Breed of the sheep&quot;: Shedding breeds will increase the risk of medullated or pigmented fibers. Any sheep likely to have dark fibers should be shorn last to avoid contamination. The age of the sheep will have a bearing on the diameter and value of the fibers of wool, too.
* &quot;Usage of chemicals&quot;: Ensure that all rules are followed.
* &quot;Brands&quot;, &quot;seedy jowls,&quot; and &quot;shanks&quot;: Must be removed from fleeces and broken.
* &quot;Stains&quot;: Must be removed from bellies and fleeces and identified in a separate line.

* &quot;Spinning capacity&quot;: The number of bends per unit length along the wool fiber approximately indicates the spinning capacity of the wool. Fibers with a fine crimp have many bends and usually have a small diameter. Such fibers can be spun into fine yarns, with great lengths of yarn for a given weight of wool, and higher market value. Fine fibers may be utilized in the production of fine garments such as men&#x27;s suits whereas the coarser fibers may be used for the manufacture of carpet and other sturdy products. The unit of measurement is crimps per inch or crimps per centimeter. The average diameter or mean fiber diameter is measured in micrometers (microns). Before the advent of technology to measure crimps and diameter, English wool-handlers categorized wool based on their fineness by estimating spinning capacity using vision and touch, which is known as the Bradford system.
* &quot;Strength&quot; (also known as &quot;tensile strength&quot;): Determines the wool&#x27;s ability to withstand processing. Weaker wool produces more waste in carding and spinning, and may be used for the production of felt or combined with other fibers.
* &quot;Color&quot;: Indicates whether wool can be dyed in light shades. Color may be graded depending upon the natural color, impurities, and various stains present. Severely stained wool decreases prices dramatically. However, it is hard to assess color accurately without proper measurement, since some stains will wash out in the processing, whereas others are quite persistent.
==Procedure==
The fleece is skirted to remove excess fibres, seeds, burrs, etc. to leave the fleece as reasonably even as possible. The wool taken from different parts of a sheep are graded separately. The fleece forming the bulk of the yield is placed with other fleece wool as the main line, while other pieces such as the neck, belly, and skirting (inferior wool from edges) are sold for such purposes where the shorter wools are required (for example fillings, carpets, insulation). While in some places, crimp may determine which grade the fleece will be put into, this subjective assessment is not always reliable, and processors prefer that wools are measured objectively by qualified laboratories. Some of the superfine wool growers do in-shed wool testing, but this can only be used as a guide. This enables wool classers to place wool into lines of a consistent quality. A shed hand, known as a wool presser, places the wool into approved wool packs in a wool press to produce a bale of wool that must meet regulations concerning its fastenings, length, weight, and branding if it is to be sold at auction in Australasia. All Merino fleece wool sold at auction in Australia is objectively measured for fiber diameter, yield (including the amount of vegetable matter), staple length, staple strength, and sometimes color.

A classer is also responsible for a pre-shearing check to be made to ensure that the wool and sheep areas are free of possible contaminants. A classer supervises shed staff during shearing, and trains any inexperienced hands. At the end of shearing, classers have to provide full documentation concerning the clip.
== Other systems of wool grading==
&quot;Blood&quot; or &quot;Blood system&quot; was one of the old ways to grade wool. It was a term that was used with different fractions to show how much merino blood a sheep has. Each blood grade corresponds to a numerical grading system based on the yarn&#x27;s fineness or count.

<text>The Returned and Services League of Australia, also known as RSL, RSL Australia and the RSLA, is an independent support organisation for people who have served or are serving in the Australian Defence Force.

==History==
The League was formed in 1916 in response to the lack of a unified approach with Australian repatriation facilities and medical services for those returning from World War I. On 6 June 1916, a meeting of representatives from New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Victoria resolved to form The Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia (RSSILA). Their intention was to lobby for better benefits, treatment and welfare of veterans and serving members of the Defence Force and to preserve the health, wellbeing and security of Australia and the Australian way of life. Before then, state Returned Service Associations had lobbied for better conditions for returned service people in their respective states. The League soon became, and remains, the nation’s largest ex-service organisation.

During the inter-war period 1919 to 1939, the RSSILA was recognised as the appropriate body to represent the interests of returned Australian service personnel in exchange for extending political cooperation to the Nationalist Party of Prime Minister Stanley Bruce. The RSSILA was noted for its right-wing politics, in 1919 drawing on its membership to form a 2,000-strong paramilitary force called the &quot;Army to fight Bolshevism&quot;, and permitting various right-wing Australian militia groups access to its membership lists to convince returned servicemen to join them. In 1923, the League adopted the motto, &quot;The price of liberty is eternal vigilance&quot;. After the Second World War, amidst widespread antisemitism in Australia, the League published antisemitic political cartoons encouraging the Australian government and Minister for Immigration Arthur Calwell to stem the flow of Jewish immigrants fleeing postwar violence. In 1948, World War I veteran and politician Fred Paterson was expelled from the organisation for being a communist.

In 1940, the name of the League changed to the Returned Sailors&#x27;, Soldiers&#x27; and Airmen&#x27;s Imperial League of Australia (RSSAILA). It changed in 1965 to the Returned Services League of Australia (RSL) and in 1990 to the Returned &amp; Services League of Australia. Before that time, those who defended Darwin from Japanese bombing in World War II were not eligible to join, as they had never left Australia and thus could not be &quot;returned.&quot;

National presidents since the league&#x27;s inception are as follows:

==Governance==

The objects of the League remain relatively unchanged from its first incorporation. The League expresses its vision as: Together, our vision is to help Australia’s veterans and Defence families enjoy better opportunities in all aspects of their lives. The League&#x27;s mission is:To provide on behalf of Australia’s Veterans and Defence families national advocacy, supportive and coordinated national programs and activities, more funding and optimised management of the RSL brand.

RSL Australia is organised as a federation of its independent state branches, which in turn consist of 1107 sub-branches () delivering diverse services tailored to the priorities and needs of local veterans. The national office, in Canberra, shapes the national agenda on veterans&#x27; affairs on behalf of the state branches, provides national advocacy, and supports and coordinates national programs and activities.

The corporate entity underpinning RSL Australia is The Returned &amp; Services League of Australia Limited – a public company limited by guarantee registered with the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission and endorsed to access GST and income tax concessions. The company is governed by a board comprising the national president and deputy national president, chairman, a director from each of the seven state/territory branches, and three independent non-member directors.

==Activities==
The League conducts a diverse range of programs and initiatives to serve its current membership and the next generation of veterans and their families. In 2022, it reported:
* deep involvement with the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide: attending hearings around the country and making extensive, detailed submissions and comments on behalf of the veteran community, and implementing projects to address some of the known issues
* initiation of an inaugural national Ex-service Organisation (ESO) Forum aimed at driving better coordination within the ESO sector and bringing together the collective thinking of Australia&#x27;s leading ESOs
* pro-active advocacy for veterans, including commentary on many current issues such as calls for government assistance for Afghan interpreters, demand-driven funding, mental health support, and proactive medical treatment for veterans
* major observances of ANZAC Day and Remembrance Day, and support of many other anniversaries and commemorations, including the 80th anniversary of the Kokoda Campaign
* advocacy in helping to shape the national discussion of security, veterans, services and defence preparedness
* cooperation with the Department of Veterans&#x27; Affairs and the Department of Defence, particularly around the subject of transition into civilian life
* delivering and coordinating &quot;Enhanced Employment Services to Veterans&quot;, a national employment program for veterans under Australian Government grant funding
* reactivation of &quot;RSL Active&quot; to better coordinate sports and recreational activities across the League.

==Influence==
The influence of the League derives from its founding days organising rituals for ANZAC Day dawn services and marches, and Remembrance Day commemorations. In addition to pressing for benefits for veterans, the organisation entered other areas of political debate. The RSL was politically conservative, Anglophilic, and monarchist.

In the 1970s and 1980s, many defence force personnel, including veterans of the Vietnam War, found the RSL – whose members had predominantly served in the Second World War – generally unwelcoming and disdaining of their service. Since the turn of the century, with the number of Second World War veterans in the RSL dwindling, Vietnam veterans and their contemporaries, along with ex-servicemen&#x27;s wives, have become mainstays of the League.

The focus of the RSL has been on the welfare of Australian men and women who have served in the armed forces. It has advocated for veterans&#x27; entitlements and the protection of former battlefields. Usually RSL members ensure that those who have served their country are commemorated by notifying funeral information and handing out poppies at the funeral.

==Symbolism==
The League&#x27;s badge is a symbol of readiness at all times to render service to the country and to former comrades. It is an offence in most states and territories for non-members to wear the RSL badge. The shield is symbolic of the protection which the RSL gives to its members, their dependents, and widows/widowers and orphans of those who paid the supreme sacrifice. At the top of the badge is a crown, signifying allegiance to the Crown. Below the crown are the national flowers of Australia, Wales, England, Scotland and Ireland: the wattle, leek, rose, thistle, and shamrock. In the centre of the badge are a sailor, soldier, airman and service woman marching with their arms linked, symbolising friendship and the unity of all services and all ranks in comradeship. The red of the badge symbolises the blood ties of war. The white background stands for the purity of motive and the rendering of service without personal gain. The blue is a symbol of willingness to render service to a comrade anywhere under the sky.

==Branches and sub-branches==
Each state and territory has a branch of the League, with similar hierarchical structures. Within each branch is a series of districts and sub-branches that serve the interests of members in a particular geographic area.

The naming of these branches and sub-branches can be confused with the commercial entities generally called RSL Clubs. Ownership and operation of RSL and Services clubs differ from state to state. For example, RSL NSW and its sub-branches do not own or operate any registered clubs, nor do they own or operate poker machines; however, RSL Victoria sub-branches do.

===Controversy (RSL New South Wales councillors)===
On 4 October 2016, the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; and ABC News reported that RSL national president Rod White, a retired major of the Australian Army Reserve, received a share in nearly $1 million of consulting fees paid by an arm of the League, RSL LifeCare, and failed to disclose conflicts of interest. 
Mr White denied any wrongdoing and was quoted as saying, when questioned by an ABC News reporter: &quot;I believe I have personally fulfilled my obligations legally and ethically and I&#x27;m just absolutely surprised at your questioning of my integrity in that regard&quot;.

In October 2016, legal advice commissioned by the RSL&#x27;s New South Wales Branch indicated RSL New South Wales councillors, including Mr White, may have broken the law by receiving a share in $1 million of consulting fees while holding a voluntary position in the veteran&#x27;s group: &quot;It is possible, but not certain, that in doing so they did not meet one or more of their duties and obligations, or contravened the law.&quot;
Subsequently, calls were made for Mr White to step aside in order to rebuild public trust in the League.

On 7 November 2016, ABC News reported Mr White as being likely to stand down pending an investigation into the consultancy fee payments, and that new documents obtained by ABC revealed that the quantum of consultancy fees paid was &quot;far greater than originally thought – totalling more than $2 million since 2007&quot;.

On Remembrance Day 2016, ABC News reported that the New South Wales Branch of the RSL was at risk of losing its charity status as a result of the payment scandal and that the Australian Charities and Not-For-Profits Commission had written to the RSL &quot;outlining its concerns that the league may not be meeting its obligations as a charity&quot; and warning, as a worst case, that &quot;the commission may use its powers to revoke the league&#x27;s charity status if it finds evidence that the rules have been broken&quot;.

The RSL acting national president, Robert Dick, was subsequently reported as saying the league would be working with &quot;regulatory bodies to deliver an appropriate corporate governance structure to ensure there is no maladministration in the NSW Branch. We are determined to expose any wrongdoing&quot;.

In March 2017, Mr White resigned as President of the RSL; he had held the position for eight months.

==Licensed clubs==

Licensed clubs were formed as commercial activities to initially provide services by sub-branches to their members, including providing an environment for the protection and promotion of the ideals of the ANZAC spirit and heritage. The venues were established to provide hospitality for war veterans and a place for comradeship. Often they were located on land granted by the state government. Over time these commercial entities, known generally as RSL Clubs (but also called Ex-Services, Memorial, Legion or other similar names) generated profits and often donated to local community services.

The membership base of the licensed clubs, totalling more than a million, differs significantly from membership of the Returned and Services League (RSL). Membership of the League does not automatically confer rights of entry or membership to a licensed club but in some jurisdictions clubs extend honorary membership to serving members of the ADF.
Licensed clubs operating under the RSL name usually have bar and dining facilities for their members and guests, and sometimes have extensive gambling areas. Each evening at 6.00 pm the Ode of Remembrance is read, followed by one minute&#x27;s silence to honour those who died serving their country.

RSL NSW and its sub-Branches do not own or operate any registered clubs, nor do they own or operate poker machines.

==Other commercial activities==
===RSL Care===
The first RSL home for ex-servicemen was established in 1938. The affiliated organisation, which became RSL Care, had 26 facilities in 2011. Following a merger with the Royal District Nursing Service in Victoria, in 2016 it became RSL Care RDNS Limited, an Australian public company registered as a charity, trading as Bolton Clarke. With more than 28 retirement communities throughout Queensland and New South Wales and several others in development, it was one of Australia&#x27;s largest providers of retirement living and aged care services.

===RSL Cabs===
Operating under a co-operative structure, in 1946 a group of returned servicemen established RSL Ex-Servicemen&#x27;s Cabs &amp; Co-Operative Members Limited to provide taxi services to Sydney. By the 1950s, the co-operative had expanded to more than 60 drivers. it operated on a commercial basis in which drivers were not required to be members of the League.

===RSL Art Union===
Commenced in Queensland in 1956, the RSL Art Union is a lottery that raises funds to provide welfare services to ex-service men and women, their dependents and to other members of the community. A major prize of a luxury waterfront home on Queensland&#x27;s Gold Coast is usually offered, together with a range of bonus prizes. , the RSL Art Union had provided since its inception A$80  million in prizes and had raised more than A$70 million for development and maintenance of RSL nursing homes, hospitals and centres, and retirement complexes for elderly people.

<doc id="185529" wikidata="Q727490" url="?curid=185529" title="Scalability">
<text>Scalability is the property of a system to handle a growing amount of work. One definition for software systems specifies that this may be done by adding resources to the system. 

In an economic context, a scalable business model implies that a company can increase sales given increased resources. For example, a package delivery system is scalable because more packages can be delivered by adding more delivery vehicles. However, if all packages had to first pass through a single warehouse for sorting, the system would not be as scalable, because one warehouse can handle only a limited number of packages. 

In computing, scalability is a characteristic of computers, networks, algorithms, networking protocols, programs and applications. An example is a search engine, which must support increasing numbers of users, and the number of topics it indexes. Webscale is a computer architectural approach that brings the capabilities of large-scale cloud computing companies into enterprise data centers.

In distributed systems, there are several definitions according to the authors, some considering the concepts of scalability a sub-part of elasticity, others as being distinct. According to Marc Brooker: &quot;a system is scalable in the range where marginal cost of additional workload is nearly constant.&quot; Serverless technologies fit this definition but you need to consider total cost of ownership not just the infra cost. 

In mathematics, scalability mostly refers to closure under scalar multiplication.

In industrial engineering and manufacturing, scalability refers to the capacity of a process, system, or organization to handle a growing workload, adapt to increasing demands, and maintain operational efficiency. A scalable system can effectively manage increased production volumes, new product lines, or expanding markets without compromising quality or performance. In this context, scalability is a vital consideration for businesses aiming to meet customer expectations, remain competitive, and achieve sustainable growth. Factors influencing scalability include the flexibility of the production process, the adaptability of the workforce, and the integration of advanced technologies. By implementing scalable solutions, companies can optimize resource utilization, reduce costs, and streamline their operations. Scalability in industrial engineering and manufacturing enables businesses to respond to fluctuating market conditions, capitalize on emerging opportunities, and thrive in an ever-evolving global landscape.

==Examples==
The Incident Command System (ICS) is used by emergency response agencies in the United States. ICS can scale resource coordination from a single-engine roadside brushfire to an interstate wildfire. The first resource on scene establishes command, with authority to order resources and delegate responsibility (managing five to seven officers, who will again delegate to up to seven, and on as the incident grows). As an incident expands, more senior officers assume command.

==Dimensions==
Scalability can be measured over multiple dimensions, such as:

*&quot;Administrative scalability&quot;: The ability for an increasing number of organizations or users to access a system.
*&quot;Functional scalability&quot;: The ability to enhance the system by adding new functionality without disrupting existing activities.
*&quot;Geographic scalability&quot;: The ability to maintain effectiveness during expansion from a local area to a larger region.
*&quot;Load scalability&quot;: The ability for a distributed system to expand and contract to accommodate heavier or lighter loads, including, the ease with which a system or component can be modified, added, or removed, to accommodate changing loads.
*&quot;Generation scalability&quot;: The ability of a system to scale by adopting new generations of components. 
*&quot;Heterogeneous scalability&quot; is the ability to adopt components from different vendors.

==Domains==
* A routing protocol is considered scalable with respect to network size, if the size of the necessary routing table on each node grows as O(log &quot;N&quot;), where &quot;N&quot; is the number of nodes in the network. Some early peer-to-peer (P2P) implementations of Gnutella had scaling issues. Each node query flooded its requests to all nodes. The demand on each peer increased in proportion to the total number of peers, quickly overrunning their capacity. Other P2P systems like BitTorrent scale well because the demand on each peer is independent of the number of peers. Nothing is centralized, so the system can expand indefinitely without any resources other than the peers themselves.
* A scalable online transaction processing system or database management system is one that can be upgraded to process more transactions by adding new processors, devices and storage, and which can be upgraded easily and transparently without shutting it down.
* The distributed nature of the Domain Name System (DNS) allows it to work efficiently, serving billions of hosts on the worldwide Internet.

==Horizontal (scale out) and vertical scaling (scale up)==
Resources fall into two broad categories: horizontal and vertical.

===Horizontal or scale out===
Scaling horizontally (out/in) means adding or removing nodes, such as adding a new computer to a distributed software application. An example might involve scaling out from one web server to three. High-performance computing applications, such as seismic analysis and biotechnology, scale workloads horizontally to support tasks that once would have required expensive supercomputers. Other workloads, such as large social networks, exceed the capacity of the largest supercomputer and can only be handled by scalable systems. Exploiting this scalability requires software for efficient resource management and maintenance.

===Vertical or scale up===
Scaling vertically (up/down) means adding resources to (or removing resources from) a single node, typically involving the addition of CPUs, memory or storage to a single computer.

Benefits to scale-up include avoiding increased management complexity, more sophisticated programming to allocate tasks among resources and handling issues such as throughput, latency, and synchronization across nodes. Moreover some applications do not scale horizontally.

==Network scalability==
Network function virtualization defines these terms differently: scaling out/in is the ability to scale by adding/removing resource instances (e.g., virtual machine), whereas scaling up/down is the ability to scale by changing allocated resources (e.g., memory/CPU/storage capacity).

==Database scalability==

Scalability for databases requires that the database system be able to perform additional work given greater hardware resources, such as additional servers, processors, memory and storage. Workloads have continued to grow and demands on databases have followed suit.

Algorithmic innovations include row-level locking and table and index partitioning. Architectural innovations include shared-nothing and shared-everything architectures for managing multi-server configurations.

==Strong versus eventual consistency (storage)==
In the context of scale-out data storage, scalability is defined as the maximum storage cluster size which guarantees full data consistency, meaning there is only ever one valid version of stored data in the whole cluster, independently from the number of redundant physical data copies. Clusters which provide &quot;lazy&quot; redundancy by updating copies in an asynchronous fashion are called &#x27;eventually consistent&#x27;. This type of scale-out design is suitable when availability and responsiveness are rated higher than consistency, which is true for many web file-hosting services or web caches (&quot;if you want the latest version, wait some seconds for it to propagate&quot;). For all classical transaction-oriented applications, this design should be avoided.

Many open-source and even commercial scale-out storage clusters, especially those built on top of standard PC hardware and networks, provide eventual consistency only, such as some NoSQL databases like CouchDB and others mentioned above. Write operations invalidate other copies, but often don&#x27;t wait for their acknowledgements. Read operations typically don&#x27;t check every redundant copy prior to answering, potentially missing the preceding write operation. The large amount of metadata signal traffic would require specialized hardware and short distances to be handled with acceptable performance (i.e., act like a non-clustered storage device or database).

Whenever strong data consistency is expected, look for these indicators: 
* the use of InfiniBand, Fibrechannel or similar low-latency networks to avoid performance degradation with increasing cluster size and number of redundant copies. 
* short cable lengths and limited physical extent, avoiding signal runtime performance degradation.
* majority / quorum mechanisms to guarantee data consistency whenever parts of the cluster become inaccessible.

Indicators for eventually consistent designs (not suitable for transactional applications!) are:
* write performance increases linearly with the number of connected devices in the cluster.
* while the storage cluster is partitioned, all parts remain responsive. There is a risk of conflicting updates.

==Performance tuning versus hardware scalability==
It is often advised to focus system design on hardware scalability rather than on capacity. It is typically cheaper to add a new node to a system in order to achieve improved performance than to partake in performance tuning to improve the capacity that each node can handle. But this approach can have diminishing returns (as discussed in performance engineering). For example: suppose 70% of a program can be sped up if parallelized and run on multiple CPUs instead of one. If formula_1 is the fraction of a calculation that is sequential, and formula_2 is the fraction that can be parallelized, the maximum speedup that can be achieved by using P processors is given according to Amdahl&#x27;s Law:

: formula_3

Substituting the value for this example, using 4 processors gives

: formula_4

Doubling the computing power to 8 processors gives

: formula_5

Doubling the processing power has only sped up the process by roughly one-fifth. If the whole problem was parallelizable, the speed would also double. Therefore, throwing in more hardware is not necessarily the optimal approach.

== Universal Scalability Law ==
In distributed systems, you can use Universal Scalability Law (USL) to model and to optimize scalability of your system. USL is coined by Neil J. Gunther and quantifies scalability based on parameters such as contention and coherency. Contention refers to delay due to waiting or queueing for shared resources. Coherence refers to delay for data to become consistent. For example, having a high contention indicates sequential processing that could be parallelized, while having a high coherency suggests excessive dependencies among processes, prompting you to minimize interactions. Also, with help of USL, you can, in advance, calculate the maximum effective capacity of your system: scaling up your system beyond that point is a waste. 

== Weak versus strong scaling ==
High performance computing has two common notions of scalability:
* &quot;Strong scaling&quot; is defined as how the solution time varies with the number of processors for a fixed &quot;total&quot; problem size.
* &quot;Weak scaling&quot; is defined as how the solution time varies with the number of processors for a fixed problem size &quot;per processor&quot;.

<text>Kenyon College ( ) is a private liberal arts college in Gambier, Ohio, United States. It was founded in 1824 by Episcopal Bishop Philander Chase. It is the oldest private institution of higher education in the state of Ohio and enrolls approximately 1,800 undergraduate students. Students can choose from over 50 majors, minors, and concentrations, including self-designed majors.

The college is located on a hill overlooking the Kokosing River and neighbors Mount Vernon, Ohio. Its campus is set in rural surroundings that host seven ecosystems. There are more than 120 student clubs and organizations. Kenyon athletes are called Owls and compete in the NCAA Division III North Coast Athletic Conference. Kenyon College is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.

==History==

=== Founding ===
After becoming the first Episcopal Bishop of Ohio in 1818, Philander Chase found a severe lack of trained clergy on the Ohio frontier. He sailed to England and solicited donations from George Kenyon, Lord Gambier, and the writer and philanthropist Hannah More. The college was incorporated in December, 1824. Dissatisfied with the original location of the college in Worthington, Chase purchased of land in Knox County (with the Mount Vernon lawyer Henry Curtis), and reached what he would name Gambier Hill on July 24, 1825.

David Foster Wallace gave an often-quoted commencement address in 2005. &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; called it &quot;one of the all-time best commencement addresses.&quot; When he committed suicide three years afer giving the speech, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; published an abridged version of it.

===&quot;The Kenyon Review&quot;===
Kenyon&#x27;s English department gained national recognition with the arrival of the poet and critic John Crowe Ransom in 1937 as professor of poetry and first editor of &quot;The Kenyon Review&quot;, a literary journal. During his 21-year tenure, Ransom published work by writers Allen Tate, Robert Penn Warren, William Empson, Mark Van Doren, Kenneth Burke, and Delmore Schwartz, as well as younger writers Flannery O&#x27;Connor, Robert Lowell, and Peter Taylor, among others. It was an influential literary magazine during the 1940s and 1950s.

&quot;The Kenyon Review&quot; hosts a two-week summer writing workshop on campus for high-school students. The &quot;Review&quot; sponsors an annual summer writers workshop for adults. &quot;The Kenyon Review&quot; also operates the KR Associates Program, allowing Kenyon students to gain experience in literary editing, publishing, and programming. Student associates work with &quot;Kenyon Review&quot; staff in manuscript evaluation, publicity and marketing, and event planning, among other creative and editorial projects.

== Academics ==

Kenyon is a four-year liberal arts college. There are 18 academic departments, 14 interdisciplinary programs, and more than 50 majors, minors, and concentrations. Kenyon requires students to take classes in each of the four academic divisions: fine arts, humanities, natural sciences, and social sciences. In addition, students must study a foreign language. Its most popular majors, by 2021 graduates, were: English, Economics, Psychology, Political Science, and Biology. The academic year follows a schedule of two four-course semesters, as well as research opportunities in the natural sciences, humanities, social sciences, and fine arts during the summer.

Kenyon&#x27;s faculty includes over 200 full-time professors, with 99% of faculty holding a Ph.D. or other terminal degree in their field. All courses are taught by professors, with a student-to-faculty-ratio of 10:1.

Kenyon claims to offer more than 190 study abroad programs in 50 different countries. There is a program at the University of Exeter and one in Rome.

Kenyon&#x27;s Center for the Study of American Democracy (CSAD), established in 2007, organizes conferences and seminars with the goal of promoting nonpartisan civic and political discourse. Students can join the Center as Associates, serving as student advisors, organizing events, and encouraging greater participation on campus in the center&#x27;s programs. CSAD was funded through a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities.

The Gund Gallery, a visual arts center and exhibition space, was opened in 2011. It hosts lectures, public programming, and exhibitions from traveling shows and its permanent collection.

== Admissions ==
Admission to Kenyon is considered &quot;most selective&quot; by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

For the class of 2022 (enrolling fall 2018), Kenyon received 6,152 applications, accepted 2,204 (35.8%), and enrolled 539. For enrolled first-year students the middle 50% range of SAT scores was 640–730 for critical reading and 640–740 for math, while the ACT composite range was 29–33; the average GPA was 3.94.

==Rankings==
In 2006, &quot;Newsweek&quot; selected Kenyon College as one of twenty-five &quot;New Ivies&quot; on the basis of admissions statistics as well as interviews with administrators, students, faculty members, and alumni. Additionally, it was also listed in Greene&#x27;s list of &quot;Hidden Ivies&quot; in 2000. &quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s 2018–2019 &quot;Best Colleges in America&quot; report ranked Kenyon as the 214th best college in the country.

In the 2025 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; rankings, Kenyon was tied for the No. 45th liberal arts college in the United States. In the 2025 &quot;Forbes&quot; rankings, Kenyon was ranked 33rd among liberal-arts colleges and 140th among 500 colleges and universities in the United States. In 2022, CollegeSimply ranked Kenyon as the 2nd best institution of higher education in Ohio and the 61st best college or university overall.

Previously, Kenyon gained national recognition for LGBTQ inclusion. It was ranked as one of the best campuses for LGBTQ students in the country in both 2020 and 2021. It did not retain this ranking in 2022.

Although Kenyon is often ranked favorably, some methods that rank colleges based on their calculated return on investment (ROI) have been critical of Kenyon&#x27;s value. The 2018 Payscale College ROI Report ranked Kenyon as the 983rd best value college in the country.

==Athletics==
Kenyon&#x27;s sports teams, which compete in the North Coast Athletic Conference (NCAC), were referred to as the Lords and Ladies until 2022 when a new nickname, the Owls, was adopted. At various points in the past, the teams were also known as the Mauve, the Purple, the Purple and White, the Hilltoppers, and simply as Kenyon.

The men&#x27;s swim team, in NCAA Division III, claims to have won, from 1980 through 2010, a record 31 consecutive NCAA national championships as well as consecutive titles between 2012 and 2015 for a total of 34 program titles. The women&#x27;s swim team has won 24 non-consecutive titles of their own since 1984, the most recent being in 2022.

In 2006, Kenyon opened the Kenyon Athletic Center (KAC), a building. Field hockey, football and men&#x27;s lacrosse are played at McBride Field which has a seating capacity of 1,762.

In 2019, Kenyon was one of the first National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)-member colleges to participate in the organization&#x27;s LGBTQ OneTeam Program, which launched in fall 2019.

== Student media ==

=== Campus newspaper ===
The &quot;Kenyon Collegian&quot; is the official student newspaper of Kenyon College. Founded in 1856, the paper is staffed entirely by Kenyon College undergraduates and is published on a weekly basis.

=== Political and cultural magazine ===
&quot;The Kenyon Observer&quot;, founded in 1989 by David Horner and Alex Novak, began as a conservative, undergraduate political journal at Kenyon College. After the journal briefly ceased publication after the fall of 2009, it was re-established in the fall of 2011 by students Jonathan Green and Gabriel Rom. The latest iteration of the &quot;Observer&quot; features contributions from Kenyon students of all political ideologies.

David Skinner, an &quot;Observer&quot; alumnus, worked as editor of &quot;Humanities&quot;. Evan McLaren, a prominent white nationalist and director of the National Policy Institute, was a major contributor to the &quot;Observer&quot; and its editor-in-chief from 2007 to 2008.

== Traditions ==

Kenyon is Ohio&#x27;s oldest private college and has traditions which date back almost 200 years. All incoming students are expected to take the Matriculation Oath and sign a Matriculation Book. This tradition has existed at Kenyon for over a century.

Another tradition is the &quot;First-Year Sing.&quot; Each year, entering first-years gather on the steps of Rosse Hall to sing Kenyon songs before they are officially part of the Kenyon community. On the day before Commencement, seniors gather on the steps of Rosse Hall to sing the same songs again.

Kenyon students avoid stepping on the college seal in the entrance hall of Peirce Dining Hall. Tradition holds that if someone steps on the seal, they will not graduate from the college.

The Church of the Holy Spirit, one of Kenyon&#x27;s oldest structures, features a 10-bell set of chimes which ring the traditional Westminster Quarters. The bells, installed in 1879, are rung manually in the belltower each Friday by a campus group known as the Kenyon Pealers.

Whenever a new president begins their time at the college, candles are lit in every window of Old Kenyon, as a sign of welcome. Additionally, a bell hangs in the steeple of Old Kenyon and is only rung when a new president is inaugurated, as well as having been rung when the United States is no longer engaged in war and when the Kenyon football team wins a home game. Kenyon has had twenty-five presidents (including acting or interim appointments); former president S. Georgia Nugent was Kenyon&#x27;s first female president, and former president Sean Decatur was Kenyon&#x27;s first African-American president. The president&#x27;s academic regalia is a purple gown with four velvet chevrons on each sleeve signifying the office of the president, a college seal medallion with the names of each Kenyon president on the chain links, and a purple beefeater cap. The purple beefeaters cap is also worn by college trustees at ceremonies.

The college&#x27;s official song is &quot;The Thrill.&quot; However, &quot;Kokosing Farewell&quot; is more often sung at ceremonies. &quot;Kokosing Farewell,&quot; sung to the tune of the 1870 hymn &quot;The Day Thou Gavest, Lord, Is Ending,&quot; is the traditional closing number for concerts of the Kenyon College Chamber Singers.

The college has maintained a tradition of formality at ceremonies. During the annual commencement ceremony, the conferring of degrees to the class and announcement of each individual student&#x27;s degree of Bachelor of Arts is done entirely in Latin. Kenyon&#x27;s diplomas are also written entirely in Latin.

== Shield and seal ==
The first Kenyon seal was designed no later than 1842 and contained a book, a cross, a scroll, a telescope, and a scientific apparatus surrounded by the words &quot;Sigillum Collegi Kenyonensis&quot; and &quot;Ohio Resp&quot;. Since the second and current seal was introduced, the first seal has rarely been used.

Kenyon&#x27;s second and current shield is derived from the coat of arms of Lord Kenyon, one of the college&#x27;s first and most prominent benefactors. The shield consists of a chevron, three crosses, a book inscribed with the college&#x27;s motto (as well as the Kenyon family&#x27;s motto) &quot;magnanimiter crucem sustine&quot; (&quot;valiantly bear the cross&quot;), resting upon a bishop&#x27;s staff, representing the college&#x27;s founder, Bishop Philander Chase. The shield has become a widely used symbol for the college. A version of the shield that replaces the book and staff with &quot;Kenyon&quot; in block letters while the chevron and crosses remain has become the symbol for the college&#x27;s athletic teams.

In 2011, American clothier Ralph Lauren discontinued production of a necktie depicting the Kenyon shield after it was found they did not license the rights from the college.

The Bexley Seminary had its own shield until its dissociation from the college in 1968. While it contained the book, motto, and bishop&#x27;s staff of the Kenyon shield, an eagle and ermine pattern blazoned the lower portion of the shield.

== Sustainability ==
Kenyon College has undertaken a number of sustainability initiatives, including a recycling system upgrade, a biodiesel project, a computer lab conversion to double-sided printing, the distribution of green living guides, as well as the creation of a dining hall composting system that diverts 6,000 pounds of waste from the landfill per week. Additionally Kenyon&#x27;s cafeteria is committed to serving local food and has become a leader among college cafeterias in the country.
Students partnered with administrators and professors to complete a campus energy audit for the past three years, as well as a carbon footprint calculation.

Kenyon Green Alumni was founded to connect graduates &quot;with a professional interest in the environment.&quot; The college received a &quot;C&quot; grade on the 2010 College Sustainability Report Card, compiled by the Sustainable Endowments Institute.

The Kenyon Farm is a mixed crop-livestock operation providing produce to local markets and giving students the opportunity to gain practical skills and knowledge for small-scale farming operations.

Ivy, which once covered some buildings on the Kenyon campus, but damages stonework, has been eradicated.

<doc id="185537" wikidata="Q1136236" url="?curid=185537" title="UMkhonto weSizwe">
<text>uMkhonto weSizwe (; abbreviated MK; ) was the paramilitary wing of the African National Congress (ANC), founded by Nelson Mandela in the wake of the Sharpeville massacre. Its mission was to fight against the South African government to bring an end to its racist policies.

After warning the South African government in June 1961 of its intent to increase resistance if the government did not take steps toward constitutional reform and increase political rights, uMkhonto weSizwe launched its first attacks against government installations on 16 December 1961. The group was subsequently classified as a terrorist organisation by the South African government, and banned.

For a time it was headquartered in Rivonia, which was rural at that time but is now an affluent suburb of Johannesburg. On 11 July 1963, nineteen ANC and uMkhonto weSizwe leaders, including Arthur Goldreich, Govan Mbeki and Walter Sisulu, were arrested at Liliesleaf Farm, Rivonia. (The farm was privately owned by Arthur Goldreich and bought with South African Communist Party and ANC funds, as non-whites were unable to own a property in that area under the Group Areas Act.) The arrests were followed by the Rivonia Trial, in which ten leaders of the ANC were tried for 221 militant acts that the prosecution said were designed to &quot;foment violent revolution&quot;. Wilton Mkwayi, chief of uMkhonto weSizwe at the time, escaped during the trial.

The organisation was formally disbanded in a ceremony at Orlando Stadium in Soweto, Gauteng, on 16 December 1993, although its armed struggle had been suspended earlier, during the negotiations to end apartheid.

==Motivations for formation==
According to Nelson Mandela, all of the founding members of the uMkhonto weSizwe, including himself, were also members of the ANC. In his &quot;I Am Prepared to Die&quot; speech, delivered at the conclusion of the Rivonia Trial, Mandela outlined the motivations that led to the formation of uMkhonto weSizwe:
At the beginning of June 1961, after a long and anxious assessment of the South African situation, I, and some colleagues, came to the conclusion that as violence in this country was inevitable, it would be unrealistic and wrong for African leaders to continue preaching peace and non-violence at a time when the government met our peaceful demands with force.

This conclusion was not easily arrived at. It was only when all else had failed, when all channels of peaceful protest had been barred to us, that the decision was made to embark on violent forms of political struggle, and to form uMkhonto weSizwe. We did so not because we desired such a course, but solely because the government had left us with no other choice. In the Manifesto of uMkhonto published on 16 December 1961, which is exhibit AD, we said:
The time comes in the life of any nation when there remain only two choices – submit or fight. That time has now come to South Africa. We shall not submit and we have no choice but to hit back by all means in our power in defence of our people, our future, and our freedom.

Firstly, we believed that as a result of Government policy, violence by the African people had become inevitable, and that unless responsible leadership was given to canalise and control the feelings of our people, there would be outbreaks of terrorism which would produce an intensity of bitterness and hostility between the various races of this country which is not produced even by war. Secondly, we felt that without violence there would be no way open to the African people to succeed in their struggle against the principle of white supremacy. All lawful modes of expressing opposition to this principle had been closed by legislation, and we were placed in a position in which we had either to accept a permanent state of inferiority, or take over the Government. We chose to defy the law. We first broke the law in a way which avoided any recourse to violence; when this form was legislated against, and then the Government resorted to a show of force to crush opposition to its policies, only then did we decide to answer with violence.

The manifesto referred to by Mandela, adduced by the prosecution at his trial as Exhibit AD, included the statements: 
Our men are armed and trained freedom fighters not &quot;terrorists&quot;. We are fighting for democracy—majority rule—the right of the Africans to rule Africa. We are fighting for a South Africa in which there will be peace and harmony and equal rights for all people. We are not racialists, as the white oppressors are. The African National Congress has a message of freedom for all who live in our country.
The aim was to act only against hard targets such as power pylons and avoid any injury or loss of life.

==Command structure (1961–1964)==

In the six or so months between making the decision to form the organisation (June) and the first acts of sabotage (December), the MK high command set up regional commands in the main centres. The people chosen to be part of these commands were chosen either because they had the necessary technical or military skills or because they were members of Congress Alliance organisations.

===Central (overall) command===

==Domestic campaign==
===1960s–1970s===
In June 1961, Mandela sent a letter to South African newspapers warning the government that a campaign of sabotage would be launched unless the government agreed to call for a national constitutional convention. Six months later, on 16 December 1961, Mandela led uMkhonto weSizwe in launching its campaign.

The first target sabotaged was an electrical substation. This was followed by many more acts of sabotage over a year and a half, including attacks on government posts, machines and power facilities, and crop burning. At the Rivonia Trial, the government accused them of committing 193 acts of sabotage in total.

Opinions in the ANC were divided on the viability of launching a military campaign. For this reason, MK did not publicly associate itself with the ANC at first. Its initial attacks were &quot;characterised by their simplicity&quot;: reflecting the Africans&#x27; lack of military training, and the fact that although many whites had military training, most had not seen service since the Second World War. The state responded with laws that allowed detention without trial and an unlimited power to ban organisations, and also by establishing military and civilian intelligence organisations.

MK began planning a campaign called &quot;Operation O Mayibuye&quot;, or &quot;Operation Mayibuye&quot;, from Liliesleaf Farm. The South African Heritage Portal describes how they were able to meet there:

&quot;Goldreich and Harold Wolpe, a lawyer, used South African Communist Party funds to buy Liliesleaf Farm in Rivonia in 1961 for use as a secret meeting place. The secret life of the revolutionaries at Liliesleaf had a very brief flowering – the key years were 1961 to mid-1963. Arthur Goldreich lived as the tenant of Liliesleaf with his then wife Hazel and his two sons, Nicholas and Paul. They were white, the &#x27;right colour&#x27; to belong in Rivonia, so their presence did not attract attention; this was the perfect cover... The farm outbuildings became home to various key ANC black members who posed as &#x27;servants&#x27; of the white Goldreich family. Here the leaders of a hoped for revolution developed a plan for guerrilla warfare (Operation Mayibuye) with its own printing press and a secret radio transmitter.&quot;

In 1962, Mandela went to Algeria, Egypt, and Ghana to get international backing for the group.

In December 1962, Looksmart Ngudle and Denis Goldberg helped to organise a training camp held at Mamre, outside Cape Town, later recognised as the first MK training centre inside South Africa; however it had to be abandoned early due to Security Police interest.

A lack of familiarity with the necessities of covert military work, and the reliance on high-profile leaders like Nelson Mandela, contributed to the South African state&#x27;s ability to capture the organisation&#x27;s leadership at their Rivonia headquarters outside Johannesburg at the end of 1962. This effectively neutralised MK within South Africa for the next decade. However, the organisation had established itself—and its key relationship as a disciplined part of the ANC—and did not disappear.

The early 1970s were a low point for the ANC in many ways, including in the military sphere. Attempts to rebuild uMkhonto weSizwe inside South Africa resulted in many losses, although, as noted by the Military History Journal, some members, including Chris Hani, were able to remain undetected for a long period. Meanwhile, MK cadres had access to a growing range of military training opportunities in Algeria, Egypt and the Soviet Union and other communist-bloc countries.

The Soweto uprising of 1976 led to a large exodus of young black men and women. Anxious to strike back at the apartheid regime, they crossed the border to Rhodesia to seek military training. This enabled uMkhonto weSizwe to rebuild an army — one capable of attacking prestigious targets such as the refineries at Sasolburg.

On 24 February 1977, a bomb exploded at the Daveyton Police Station, causing only superficial damage. On 14 December, guerrillas attacked the Germiston police station. On 10 March 1978, a bomb exploded outside the offices of the Bantu Affairs building in Port Elizabeth, killing one civilian and wound three others. On 21 August 1978, B. Mayeza, personnel member of the Bureau of State Security was shot dead in Umlazi, Durban. On 9 December 1978, an explosive blast severely damaged the Soweto Community Council building.

On 14 January, seven members clashed with SAP (South African Police) near Zeerust, one member was captured, others escaped over Botswana border. On 23 January, an explosion damaged the railway near New Canada, Gauteng. The next day, a large quantity of explosives on the line were found and defused, between Fort Beaufort and King William&#x27;s Town, Eastern Cape. In February, Sergeant Benjamin Letlako, a Police Special Branch member, is shot dead in Katlehong. On 15 April, an improvised device was discovered and defused on a railway line near Soweto. In 5 May, guerrillas opened fire in the Moroka Police Station, killing one and wounding three more policemen and three civilians. Next, an explosive device was found in a railway in Eastern Transvaal. On 15 November, members of MK attacked the Orlando SAP Station, leaving two officers dead and other two wounded. In the same day, the house of the Lt Magezi Ngobeni of SAP Special Branch was attacked with grenades, leaving five children wounded. In the next month, a railway near Alice, Eastern Cape was damaged by a blast.

===1980s: Bombings===
==== First attacks in the decade ====
On 4 January, the Morebeng SAP Station was attacked by an explosive device, leaving one officer injured. Days later, members of the MK took 25 hostages in a bank in Pretoria, the next confrontation between security forces and MK members left five dead (three attackers), and approximately 20 wounded. In March, MK shot dead two officers in Bophutatswana.

In June 1980, MK members attacked the Booysens Police Station, leaving two officers wounded. In 2000, the Amnesty Committee of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) granted amnesty for the attack. In the night of 31 May – 1 June, MK members attacked two Sasol oil from coal plants, leaving important material damages.

There was a lull until 21 April 1981, when the MK attacked a substation in Durban with limpet mines. In this period, the attacks with explosives continued. On 29 October, a grenade attack was reported against the West Rand police station, Gauteng Province. The following day, the MK attacked the Consul of the House of Transkei with explosives, leaving only material damage. On 21 November MK members shot dead an officer in Chiawelo, Gauteng. On 29 October, a grenade attack was reported against the West Rand police station, Gauteng Province. The following day, the MK attacked the Consul of the House of Transkei with explosives, leaving only material damage. In this period, attacks with explosives continued.

On 27 May, the MK took credit for another attack in Durban, destroying a South African Defence Force recruitment building. In June of the same year, the MK took credit for the arson attack against the headquarters of the Progressive Federal Party, which caused material damage, the abandonment of a limpet mine in a fuel depot in Alberton as well as other sabotage of railways. On 21 July, an attack on an electrical plant in Pretoria was reported, with at least six explosions recorded in three facilities.

On 11 August, MK members attacked the Voortrekker military base in Pretoria with grenade launchers. On 1 November, MK members attacked a border post with Swaziland, occupied by the South African Defense Forces (SADF), which was destroyed by a rocket and grenade attack. Days later, attacks against substations in Pretoria are attributed, between 12 and 14 October.

On 7 January 1982, MK tried to attack the West Rand Board of Administration, Soweto. Explosive attacks on administrative offices followed in the following weeks. On 28 May, MK claimed responsibility for the attack on a fuel depot and power transformer, Hectorspruit, Mpumalanga Province. In June MK attacked railways in Durban, and detonated an explosive in the offices of the Presidential Council, leaving one civilian killed. In 28 June that MK attacked railways in Vryheid and Scheepersnek.

On 5 June, the MK bombs kill one person when the explosive blasts in a lift at the offices of the presidents Council in Cape Town. Weeks later, two bombs cause extensive damage to the railway depot, pump station, stores and vehicles in Scheepersnek. A triple blasts in the Drakensberg Administration offices in Pietermaritzburg.

On 8 November, an improvised device causes important damage at the Mobil fuel storage depot in Mkuze. Days later, MK militants uses RPG-7s to attack a rural police station and temporary South African Army garrison at Tonga.

In 1983, the Church Street bomb was detonated in Pretoria near the Air Force headquarters, resulting in 19 deaths and 217 injuries.

==== 1985: Amanzimtoti bombing ====
In the 1985 the Amanzimtoti bombing on the Natal South Coast, five civilians were killed and 40 were injured when uMkhonto weSizwe cadre Andrew Sibusiso Zondo detonated an explosive in a rubbish bin at a shopping centre shortly before Christmas. In a submission to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), the ANC stated that Zondo&#x27;s act, though &quot;understandable&quot; as a response to a recent South African Defence Force raid in Lesotho, was not in line with ANC policy. Zondo was executed in 1986.

==== 1986: Durban beach-front bombing ====
In the 1986 Durban beach-front bombing, a bomb was detonated in a bar, killing three civilians and injuring 69. Robert McBride received the death penalty for this bombing, which became known as the &quot;Magoo&#x27;s Bar bombing&quot;. McBride received amnesty and became a senior police officer.

==== 1987: Johannesburg bombings ====
In 1987, an explosion outside a Johannesburg court killed three police officers and injured a further 15; a court in Newcastle had been attacked in a similar way the previous year, injuring 24. Also in 1987, a bomb exploded at a military command centre in Johannesburg, killing one person and injuring 68 personnel.

==== Other bombings ====
The armed struggle continued with attacks on a series of soft targets, including a bank in Roodepoort in 1988, in which four civilians were killed and 18 injured. Also in 1988, a bomb outside a magistrate&#x27;s court killed three. At the Ellis Park rugby stadium in Johannesburg, a car bomb killed two and injured 37 civilians. A multitude of bombs at restaurants and fast food outlets, including Wimpy Bars, and supermarkets occurred during the late 1980s, killing and wounding many people. Wimpy were specifically targeted because of their perceived rigid enforcement of many apartheid laws, including excluding non-whites from their restaurants.

=== 1985–1987: Landmine campaign ===
From 1985 to 1987, there also was a campaign to place anti-tank mines on rural roads in what was then the Northern Transvaal. This tactic was abandoned due to the high rate of civilian casualties—especially among black labourers. The ANC estimated that there were 30 landmine explosions resulting in 23 deaths, while the government submitted a figure of 57 explosions resulting in 25 deaths.

=== Findings by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission ===
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission found that the use of torture by uMkhonto weSizwe was &quot;routine&quot;, as were executions &quot;without due process&quot; at ANC detention camps. This was particularly true in the period of 1979–1989, although torture was not official ANC policy. It called the Durban bombing a &quot;gross violation of human rights&quot;.

The TRC also noted in its report that although &quot;ANC had, in the course of the conflict, contravened the Geneva Protocols and was responsible for the commission of gross human rights violations…of the three main parties to the [South African] conflict, only the ANC committed itself to observing the tenets of the Geneva Protocols and, in the main, conducting the armed struggle in accordance within the international humanitarian law&quot;.

==Foreign military activities==
===Angola===
In January 1969, the ANC declared its solidarity with the People&#x27;s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and pursued close military relations with that party, then involved in the Angolan War of Independence. Both movements were drawn into a practical and ideological friendship because of their shared links with the Soviet Union through the communist parties of their respective nations. At the First International Conference of Solidarity with the Fighting People of Southern Africa and the Portuguese Colonies, organised by the Afro-Asian People&#x27;s Solidarity Organisation and the World Peace Council, the MPLA and ANC entered into a formal military alliance together with the South West African People&#x27;s Organisation (SWAPO), the Zimbabwe African People&#x27;s Union (ZAPU), and the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC). This became known as the Khartoum alliance.

The ANC-MPLA alliance assumed new significance in the mid-1970s with Angolan independence. After consolidating power with Cuban support, the MPLA granted MK permission to establish training facilities in Angola. The primary MK base in Angola was located at Novo Catengue, where intakes of up to 500 recruits were trained by Cuban military advisers. Between 1976 and 1979, over 1,000 MK guerrillas were trained at Novo Catengue. In recognition of Cuba&#x27;s role in supervising the training programme, the third MK intake to muster out was named the &quot;Moncada Detachment&quot;. There were also a number of smaller MK training camps established throughout Angola, namely at Quibaxe. Aside from Cuba, the Soviet Union also contributed some instructors at the request of Oliver Tambo; between 1976 and 1991, 200 Soviet military personnel served at various MK camps in Angola as training staff.

The ANC and MK presence in Angola re-ignited its alliance with SWAPO and its own armed wing, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN). PLAN and MK frequently shared facilities in Angola and coordinated the transportation of supplies and war materiel.

In 1984, there was a series of mutinies in MK&#x27;s Angolan camps that were suppressed by the &quot;Mbokodo&quot;, the ANC&#x27;s internal security service. During this time, the ANC detained and executed a number of MK dissidents suspected of subversion or disloyalty. In one case mutineers killed ANC members and after the mutiny was suppressed seven mutineers were executed (with further executions only halted after the personal intervention of Oliver Tambo).

MK&#x27;s presence in Angola inevitably embroiled it in the Angolan Civil War. In August 1983, an MK battalion was deployed against the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) insurgents near Kibashe. In 1986, three battalions of newly trained MK recruits were deployed to guard FAPLA rear areas during Operation Alpha Centauri. MK also participated in the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale, fighting against a joint South African and UNITA expeditionary force during Operation Hooper and Operation Packer. At least 100 MK cadres were killed during the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale, making that engagement of enormous symbolic importance, as it was the largest single loss of life in MK&#x27;s history. Furthermore, MK&#x27;s prestige inside South Africa was greatly enhanced by its participation in a conventional battle, and apparent willingness to directly confront a South African military force.

===Rhodesia (Zimbabwe)===
During the Rhodesian Bush War, MK was closely allied with the Zimbabwe People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA), the armed wing of ZAPU. MK became interested in using ZIPRA&#x27;s infiltration routes to smuggle supplies to its fighters in South Africa, and organised a joint expedition with the latter in August 1967. A combined MK-ZIPRA force was largely eliminated by the Rhodesian Security Forces during Operation Nickel, and the survivors driven back across the border into Botswana and Zambia. Historian Rocky Williams assesses that MK and ZIPRA &quot;fought well under difficult conditions&quot; and that although the incursion failed, the Rhodesian authorities were forced to rely on clandestine military assistance from South Africa to counter them.

Concerning MK&#x27;s alliance with ZIPRA, Oliver Tambo stated: &quot;We have had close political relations with ZAPU, and these developed into relations at the military level, until we were in a position to fight together. This close alliance is the first of its kind one can recall in the liberation movement. In no previous instance has there actually been fighting by freedom fighters drawn from different territories.&quot;

==Equipment==
MK received nearly all its military equipment from the Soviet Union, although other COMECON member states such as East Germany which were sympathetic to the ANC&#x27;s cause also provided the movement with small quantities of materiel. The SACP was able to use its political contacts in the Soviet government to obtain these weapons, and was primarily responsible for MK&#x27;s logistics from the beginning of the armed struggle. Soviet ordnance played a crucial role in the MK&#x27;s sabotage campaign and in guerrilla engagements with the South African security forces. Military equipment was usually smuggled into South Africa from neighbouring states where the ANC was operating in exile. Once inside the country, they were cached in major urban centers where the ANC enjoyed a large political following. MK established enormous arms depots in Botswana, Mozambique, and Swaziland to facilitate these operations, and also had smaller quantities of weapons cached in Angola, Zambia, and Tanzania.

Soviet arms deliveries to MK, valued collectively at 36 million rubles, began in 1963 and ceased in 1990. Despite the cessation of Soviet military aid, MK had still amassed enough conventional weapons inside South Africa to mount an effective urban guerrilla campaign as needed by 1991. The movement&#x27;s preexisting arsenal was deemed sufficient to continue operations against the South African state for the foreseeable future in the event that ongoing negotiations to dismantle the apartheid system failed. MK cadres were primarily armed with Soviet AK-47 assault rifles and SKS carbines. By the late 1980s, it was beginning to supplement both these weapon types with the slightly more modern AKM assault rifle firing the same 7.62×39mm cartridge. MK also received over 6,000 handguns of various types, primarily derivatives of the TT-33 pistol.

MK possessed some heavy weapons, namely 90 man-portable, single-tube Grad-P rocket launchers. The Soviet Union also supplied MK with over 40 9K32 Strela-2 surface-to-air missile launchers and 60 9M14 Malyutka anti-tank missile systems.

After MK was disbanded, the movement passed its logistical records to the newly integrated South African National Defence Force (SANDF) to ensure that the stored equipment was properly inventoried and disposed of.

==In popular culture==

<text>Rafael Limón Burgos, also known as Bazooka Limón (born 13 January 1954) is a Mexican former professional boxer who held the WBC super featherweight title twice between 1980 and 1982. He also challenged for the same title in 1979 and 1983.

==Biography==
Born on 13 January 1954, Limón did not know who his father was. He thought his father was a soldier who lived with his mother, woman who had three sons, including Rafael, and one daughter. The soldier had alcoholic problems and beat up Limon&#x27;s mom. Limon&#x27;s mother moved with her children to Mexico City when Limon was 4; and when he was 15, Limon came to meet his real father in a strange way: walking on the street one day, Limon was confronted by a man who tried snatching his purse. He punched the man and ran back home. The man then followed him and arrived at Limon&#x27;s family&#x27;s house a couple of minutes behind Limon, and then Limon&#x27;s mother introduced them as biological father and son.

Later on, Limon, like the man who had been his father figure, joined the Mexican Army on February 14, 1972. Limon witnessed some friends boxing and was challenged by an on duty major to fight after he saw a friend get bloodied and found that funny. Limon found out he had talent for the sport and was sent to train with former professional boxer and noted trainer Kid Rapidez after three months learning to box while with the Army.

==Boxing career==
Limon is best known for his four-bout rivalry with Bobby Chacon. Their first fight took place on 7 December 1975, in Mexicali, Mexico, Limón defeating a heavily favoured Chacon in a ten-round unanimous decision (UD).

Negotiations took place in 1977–78 to pit Limón against WBA super featherweight champion, Samuel Serrano. However, the fight never took place.

Limón challenged WBC super featherweight champion Alexis Argüello in February 1979, suffering an eleventh-round knockout (KO). Following this he and Chacon met for the second time, an accidental clash of heads resulting in a seven-round technical draw (TD). The pair met for a third time on 21 March 1980, in Los Angeles, Chacon earning a 10-round split decision (SD).

In spite of this Limón found himself fighting later that year for the world title Arguello had vacated. Limón knocked out Venezuela&#x27;s Idelphonso Bethelmy in the fifteenth round at Los Angeles to become the WBC super featherweight champion.

Limon made his first defense against England-based Ugandan Cornelius Boza-Edwards, losing a fifteen-round unanimous decision.

In 1982, Rolando Navarrete was the WBC super featherweight champion, having dethroned Boza-Edwards by fifth-round KO. Limón knocked Navarrete out in round twelve to become a two-time world champion.

After defending his title successfully against Chung Il Choi, Limón met Bobby Chacon for a fourth bout. Held on 11 December 1982 in Sacramento. It was their first meeting with a world championship at stake. Limón dropped Chacón in rounds three and ten, but Chacon turned the tables with only a few seconds left in round fifteen and knocked Limón down. Limón climbed the ropes to get to his feet to finish the fight, yet lost on the judges&#x27; cards in a close unanimous decision.

In 1983, Chacón refused to defend his world title against Héctor &#x27;Macho&#x27; Camacho, so Limón traveled to Puerto Rico to meet Camacho. He was no match for Camacho, who defeated him in five rounds.

Limón went on boxing until 1992, losing to a number of future world champions and prominent boxers, including Julio César Chávez and Sharmba Mitchell, but never again challenged for a world title.

His record is 52-23-2 (39 KOs).

<text>Manuel Esteban Ancízar Basterra (25 December 1812 – 21 May 1882) was a Colombian lawyer, writer, and journalist. He founded a publishing house and a newspaper before joining the Chorographic Commission in 1850. He also served as the 4th Secretary of Foreign Affairs of the Granadine Confederation, and as the first president of the National University of Colombia.

==Personal life==
Manuel Esteban was born on 25 December 1812 in Fontibon, Bogotá to José Francisco Ancízar y Zabaleta, Spaniard native of Navarre, and Juana Bernarda Basterra y Abaurrea, Spaniard native of Biscay. In 1819 his father, who had served as &quot;Corregidor&quot; of Zipaquirá under the Viceroy of New Granada, Juan José de Sámano y Uribarri; during the time of the Reconquista, was forced to flee the capital when the Spanish forces fell at the Battle of Boyacá and the victorious forces of General Simón Bolívar entered the capital. The family arrived in Cartagena de Indias, three of Manuel&#x27;s siblings died in the arduous journey; in 1821 they had to flee again when this Spanish bastion fell to the forces of Admiral José Prudencio Padilla López. The Ancízar Basterra family landed this time in Cuba, a safe Spanish colony, where they remained under much impoverished circumstances as refugees; his mother and his only remaining sibling died few years after. In 1832 he graduated from the University of Saint Jerome in Civil Law, and two years later received his degree in Canon Law. On 4 July 1857 he married Agripina Samper Agudelo, sister of José María and Miguel Samper Agudelo, both writers and prominent politicians in Colombia; together they had five children: Roberto, Pablo, Inés, Jorge, and Manuel.

<doc id="185544" wikidata="Q597261" url="?curid=185544" title="Arcadia (band)">
<text>Arcadia were a British pop group formed in 1985 by Simon Le Bon, Nick Rhodes, and Roger Taylor of Duran Duran as a side project during a break in the band&#x27;s schedule. The project was active only during 1985 and 1986 and for just one album, &quot;So Red the Rose&quot;, which was certified Platinum in the United States and included the singles &quot;Election Day&quot;, &quot;Goodbye Is Forever&quot;, &quot;The Flame&quot;, and &quot;The Promise&quot; (featuring David Gilmour and Sting). Drummer Roger Taylor appeared in only a few band photographs and one music video (&quot;Election Day&quot;), and stated he was to be involved only in the recording side of the project (he also had minor involvement in the Power Station, the other Duran Duran splinter group, formed by Duran Duran&#x27;s Andy and John Taylor alongside Robert Palmer and Tony Thompson of Chic).

The name of the band reportedly was inspired by the Nicolas Poussin painting &quot;Et in Arcadia ego&quot; (also known as &quot;The Arcadian Shepherds&quot;).

==Music career==
===&quot;So Red the Rose&quot; (1985)===
The group recorded just one album, the platinum-selling &quot;So Red the Rose&quot;. It peaked at No. 30 in the UK and No. 23 in the US, and featured the UK/US Top 10 single &quot;Election Day&quot;, as well as the top 40 hits &quot;The Promise&quot; and &quot;Goodbye Is Forever&quot;. It also contains the single &quot;The Flame&quot; and the promo-singles &quot;Missing&quot;, &quot;El Diablo&quot; and &quot;Keep Me in the Dark&quot;.

Simon Le Bon described &quot;So Red the Rose&quot; as &quot;the most pretentious album ever made&quot;, while AllMusic called it &quot;the best album Duran Duran never made&quot;. Musicians who contributed to the album included guitarists David Gilmour (Pink Floyd) and Carlos Alomar, pianist Herbie Hancock, Sting (who provided backing vocals on &quot;The Promise&quot;), Grace Jones (who provided the spoken-word intro/interlude on &quot;The Flame&quot; and &quot;Election Day&quot;), bass player Mark Egan of the Pat Metheny Group (whose distinctive fretless sound can be recognised in &quot;The Promise&quot;, &quot;El Diablo&quot; and &quot;Lady Ice&quot;), Masami Tsuchiya and David Van Tieghem, a percussionist from New York.

A video collection was also released which featured music videos for the singles directed by Roger Christian, Marcelo Anciano, Russell Mulcahy and Dean Chamberlain. The band also recorded and released the stand-alone single &quot;Say the Word&quot; for the &quot;Playing for Keeps&quot; movie soundtrack, which was not included on &quot;So Red the Rose&quot;.

EMI re-released the album as a three-disc box set in April 2010. This remastering collected all permutations and remixes of tracks released by the band. The third disc comprised the video collection on DVD, but it does not include the video for &quot;Say the Word&quot;.

===Band changes===
Arcadia continued the Duran Duran tradition of a slick image. For the Arcadia incarnation of their ever-changing band aesthetic, Le Bon, Rhodes and Roger Taylor donned an upmarket &#x27;gothic&#x27; look of black tuxedos, vintage formal wear, and bow ties. The three also dyed their hair black, as seen when they performed (as Duran Duran, with Andy and John Taylor) at the 1985 Live Aid concert in Philadelphia. By the time the video for their single &quot;The Flame&quot; was made in early 1986 (in which John Taylor made a cameo), Rhodes had changed his hair colour to golden blond and Le Bon had returned to his regular highlighted hairstyle.

===Other appearances===
The group made a variety of promotional appearances on television, but never toured. When Duran Duran released their &quot;Notorious&quot; album and toured, &quot;Election Day&quot; was included as part of the set along with &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; from the Power Station. Drummer Roger Taylor retired from the music business for 15 years after the release of the Arcadia album, but returned in 2001 to rejoin the most famous classic Duran Duran lineup.

<text>Pope Gregory XVII (; ; born Clemente Domínguez y Gómez; 23 May 1946 – 21 March 2005), also known by the religious name Fernando María de la Santa Faz, was the first Pope of the Palmarian Catholic Church, who in this capacity, claimed to be the 263rd Pope of the Catholic Church from 6 August 1978 until his death on 21 March 2005.
 He was a visionary, seer and mystic, who, following claimed apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary as Our Crowned Mother of Palmar, founded a religious order which claimed to continue the work of the Carmelites, known as the Carmelites of the Holy Face; after 1978, this order became synonymous with the Palmarian Church.

Domínguez and several other members of the Carmelites of the Holy Face, was ordained as a priest and then consecrated as a Bishop in January 1976, by Archbishop Ngô Đình Thục, a Vietnamese cleric of the Roman Catholic Church. Following the death of Pope Paul VI in August 1978, Clemente claimed to have a vision where he was mystically crowned Pope of the Catholic Church by Jesus Christ himself. He claimed that the Holy See of the Catholic Church had been moved from Rome to El Palmar de Troya, due to the supposed apostasy of the former. During his pontificate, he issued many documents between 1978 and 1980, which laid out the direction of the Church; he invalidated the Second Vatican Council and also excommunicated the leaders of the Vatican City, declaring them Antipopes.

In close collaboration with his trusted &quot;éminence grise&quot; and Palmarian Secretary of State, Fr. Isidore (Manuel Alonso Corral), during his tenure as Palmarian Pontiff there took place two ecumenical councils; the First Palmarian Council (1980–1992) and the Second Palmarian Council (1995–2002). The result of the latter Council was a claimed divinely-mandated purification of the text of the &quot;Vulgate&quot; (the Bible preferred for many centuries by the Catholic Church), in the form of &quot;The Sacred History or Holy Palmarian Bible&quot;. His reign also oversaw the construction of the large Cathedral-Basilica of Our Crowned Mother of Palmar at El Palmar de Troya, just outside Seville in Andalusia, Spain. Following his death in 2005, the day after, Pope Peter II (Manuel Alonso Corral), his successor, canonised him as a Catholic saint in the Palmarian Catholic Church as &quot;Pope St. Gregory XVII the Very Great&quot;.

==Biography==
===Background===
Clemente Domínguez y Gómez was born in Écija, province of Seville, Andalusia, on 23 April 1946, to Rafael Domínguez and Lucía Maria Gómez, Spanish Catholic parents and was raised with a traditional Catholic education. As a young man he worked several different jobs, including for the &quot;Compañía Sevillana de Electricidad&quot;, an electricity company in Seville and gained the nicknamed &quot;la Voltio&quot;, before eventually becoming an accountant working in an insurance company. As a youth Clemente lived a somewhat libertine lifestyle, as a Palmarian source describes during his youth he had a &quot;certain attachment to the world and its vanities, but with the most tender filial love towards the Virgin Mary.&quot;

===Our Lady of Palmar===

At 23 years old, he became closely associated with the &quot;Palmar de Troya&quot; movement, which had its origins in an alleged apparition of the Blessed Virgin Mary, under the title of Our Lady of Palmar, on 30 March 1968, in El Palmar de Troya, a village near Utrera in the Province of Seville. He claimed to have experienced visions of the Virgin Mary beginning on 30 September 1969. He claimed that the Virgin condemned heresy and progressivism, namely the reform of the Roman Catholic Church as a result of Vatican II. His followers claimed he possessed the stigmata on his hands. The Roman Catholic Church has cast doubt on the legitimacy of the alleged visions and apparitions.

===Ordination by Catholic Archbishop Thục===

In December 1975, Clemente Domínguez founded his own religious order, The Carmelites of the Holy Face, allegedly upon instructions from the Blessed Virgin Mary in an apparition.

Domínguez, who assumed the name Father Ferdinand, was consecrated a bishop by Roman Catholic Archbishop Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục in January 1976. Archbishop Thục was subsequently excommunicated for his consecrations, which were deemed valid but illicit. Domínguez was also excommunicated &quot;latae sentientiae, Thục, the Archbishop who consecrated Gómez is believed to have reconciled to Rome before his death in 1984.&quot;

===Claim to the Papacy===
In May 1976, Domínguez lost his eyeballs in a car accident. He claimed further visions, including visions from Jesus, who purportedly told him: &quot;You shall be the Peter to come, the pope who will consolidate the Faith and the Church in her integrity, who shall battle against heresy with great power, for legions of angels shall assist you...Great Pope Gregory, Glory of the Olives...&quot; He also claimed that Christ had named him His sub-vicar, with the automatic right of succession to the papacy after Pope Paul VI. On August 6, 1978, Pope Paul died, and Domínguez claimed the papacy, proclaiming himself &quot;Pope Gregory XVII&quot;.

Domínguez claimed that he was visited by Christ, along with Saint Peter and Saint Paul, who told him:

On 15 August 1978, Pope Gregory XVII was crowned pope by four of his newly created college of cardinals in a coronation held in Seville, Spain. During his papacy, he purported to canonize General Francisco Franco and Christopher Columbus. According to his supporters, Pope Gregory XVII was destined to be the last pope and would be crucified and die in Jerusalem.

In the 1990s, Pope Gregory XVII rumours began to spread in the Church, claiming that the Pope had been guilty of sins against chastity, with various priests and nuns. In 1997, he admitted to this and begged forgiveness. Regarding himself as a poor sinner, he never advocated from the pulpit or in any of the documents of the Church for a liberal interpretation of human sexual ethics, but rather advocated prayer and penance for those who fell into temptation and became sinners (in the definition of the Palmarian Church).

He died on 21 March 2005, in El Palmar de Troya and was succeeded by Manuel Corral, who took the name Pope Peter II. Incidentally, the papacy of Gregory XVII closely overlapped that of Pope John Paul II. He died, aged only 58, a mere 11 days prior to the death of his &quot;rival,&quot; John Paul II.

==Legacy==
Domínguez was canonized as a saint by Corral on 24 March 2005, two days after his death. He has subsequently been referred to by adherents of the Palmarian Church as &quot;Pope Saint Gregory XVII the Very Great&quot;. On 29 July 2005, Corral declared that Domínguez&#x27;s soul did not spend time in purgatory, but ascended directly to heaven. The Palmarian Catholic Church considers Pope Gregory XVII to have been &quot;vilely caluminated and gravely betrayed&quot;, describing him as a &quot;Exceptionally Radiant Solar Luminary of the Church.&quot; In the Palmarian “&quot;History of the Popes&quot;,” or formally, the &quot;Historical Review of All the Popes Who Have Shepherded the Holy Church Founded by Our Lord Jesus Christ&quot;, a document which was initially published as part of the &quot;Palmarian Bible&quot; in 2001, but is now published as an independent edition, he is described in extremely laudatory terms;

<text>Jandek is the musical project of Sterling Smith, a Houston, Texas-based American lo-fi folk singer. Since 1978, Jandek has independently released over 120 albums while granting an interview extremely rarely and providing no biographical information, releasing on a self-made label, &quot;Corwood Industries&quot;. Jandek often plays an idiosyncratic and frequently atonal form of folk and blues music, frequently using an open and unconventional chord structure. &quot;AllMusic&quot; has described Jandek as &quot;the most enigmatic figure in American music.&quot;

==History==
A review of the debut album &quot;Ready for the House&quot; (1978) in &quot;OP&quot; magazine, the first ever national press given to Jandek, referred to the artist as Sterling Smith. Smith has kept his personal history secret, revealing only one story about his pre-Corwood years: he wrote seven novels but burned them upon rejection from New York publishers.

In a 1985 private phone conversation with John Trubee for &quot;Spin&quot;, Smith mentioned that he was working at that time as a machinist.

Jandek&#x27;s first album, &quot;Ready for the House&quot;, though a solo work, was originally credited to a band called The Units. Corwood was forced to change the name The Units by an identically named Californian group already in possession of a trademark on the name. All reissues of this first album and all subsequent Corwood releases have been credited to &quot;Jandek&quot;. In Trubee&#x27;s unauthorized interview, Smith claims he came up with the name Jandek while on the telephone with a person named Decker during the month of January. Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain discussed Jandek in a 1993 interview, stating &quot;He&#x27;s not pretentious, but only pretentious people like his music.&quot;

In 1999, &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; reporter Katy Vine interviewed a man she believed to be Jandek, though he refused to identify himself, and although familiar with Jandek&#x27;s music, refused to discuss it. In 2003, filmmaker Chad Freidrichs released a documentary, &quot;Jandek on Corwood&quot;, which contained no interviews with Jandek but was put together with &quot;a representative of Corwood Industries&quot;.

On October 17, 2004, at the Instal Festival in Glasgow, Scotland, an unannounced and unidentified act (playing alongside bassist Richard Youngs and drummer Alex Neilson) performed at the festival. This was later confirmed to be Jandek in his first live performance. Jandek has since made numerous live performances, usually unannounced in advance.

<text>Man with a Movie Camera () is an experimental 1929 Soviet silent documentary film, directed by Dziga Vertov, filmed by his brother Mikhail Kaufman, and edited by Vertov&#x27;s wife Yelizaveta Svilova. Kaufman also appears as the eponymous Man of the film.

Vertov&#x27;s feature film, produced by the film studio All-Ukrainian Photo Cinema Administration (VUFKU), presents urban life in Moscow, Kiev and Odessa during the late 1920s. It has no actors. From dawn to dusk Soviet citizens are shown at work and at play, and interacting with the machinery of modern life. To the extent that it can be said to have &quot;characters&quot;, they are the cameramen of the title, the film editor, and the modern Soviet Union they discover and present in the film.

&quot;Man with a Movie Camera&quot; is famous for the range of cinematic techniques Vertov invented, employed or developed, such as multiple exposure, fast motion, slow motion, freeze frames, match cuts, jump cuts, split screens, Dutch angles, extreme close-ups, tracking shots, reversed footage, stop motion animations and self-reflexive visuals (at one point it features a split-screen tracking shot; the sides have opposite Dutch angles).

&quot;Man with a Movie Camera&quot; was largely dismissed upon its initial release; the work&#x27;s fast cutting, self-reflexivity, and emphasis on form over content were all subjects of criticism. In the British Film Institute&#x27;s 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; poll, however, film critics voted it the 8th greatest film ever made, the 9th greatest in the 2022 poll, and in 2014 it was named the best documentary of all time in the same magazine. The National Oleksandr Dovzhenko Film Centre placed it in 2021 at number three of their list of the 100 best films in the history of Ukrainian cinema.

In 2015, the film received a restoration using a 35mm print of the only known complete cut of the film. Restoration efforts were conducted by the EYE Film Institute in Amsterdam, with additional digital work by Lobster Films. While the film is in the public domain, this restored version was licensed to Flicker Alley for release on Blu-ray.

==Overview==

The film is divided into six separate parts, one for each film reel on which it would have originally been printed. Each part begins with a number appearing on screen and falling down flat. The film makes use of many editing techniques, such as superimposition, slow motion, fast motion, rapid cross-cutting, and montage.

The film has an unabashedly avant-garde style, and the subject matter varies greatly. The titular man with the movie camera (Mikhail Kaufman, Vertov&#x27;s brother) travels to diverse locations to capture a variety of shots. He appears in artistic images such as a superimposed shot of the cameraman setting up his camera atop a second, mountainous camera, and another superimposed shot of the cameraman inside a beer glass. General images include laborers at work, sporting events, couples getting married and divorced, a woman giving birth, and a funeral procession. Much of the film is concerned with people of varying economic classes navigating urban environments. On occasion, the film&#x27;s editor (Svilova) is shown working with strips of film and various pieces of editing equipment.

Despite claiming to be without actors, the film features a few staged situations. This includes some of the cameraman&#x27;s actions, the scene of a woman getting dressed, and chess pieces being swept to the center of the board (a shot spliced in backwards so the pieces expand outward and stand in position). Stop-motion is used for several shots, including an unmanned camera on a tripod standing up, showing off its mechanical parts, and then walking off screen.

==Vertov&#x27;s intentions==

Vertov was an early pioneer in documentary film-making during the late 1920s. He belonged to a movement of filmmakers known as the kinoks, or kino-oki (kino-eyes). Vertov, along with other kino artists declared it their mission to abolish all non-documentary styles of film-making, a radical approach to movie making. Most of Vertov&#x27;s films were highly controversial, and the kinok movement was despised by many filmmakers.

Vertov&#x27;s crowning achievement, &quot;Man with a Movie Camera&quot;, was his response to critics who rejected his previous film, &quot;A Sixth Part of the World&quot;. Critics had declared that Vertov&#x27;s overuse of &quot;intertitles&quot; was inconsistent with the film-making style to which the &quot;kinoks&quot; subscribed. Working within that context, Vertov dealt with a lot of fear in anticipation of the film&#x27;s release. He requested a warning to be printed in the Soviet central Communist newspaper &quot;Pravda&quot;, which spoke directly of the film&#x27;s experimental, controversial nature. Vertov was worried that the film would be either destroyed or ignored by the public. Upon the official release of &quot;Man with a Movie Camera&quot;, Vertov issued a statement at the beginning of the film, which read:

The film &quot;Man with a Movie Camera&quot; represents
AN EXPERIMENTATION IN THE CINEMATIC COMMUNICATION
Of visual phenomena
WITHOUT THE USE OF INTERTITLES
(a film without intertitles)
WITHOUT THE HELP OF A SCENARIO
(a film without a scenario)
WITHOUT THE HELP OF THEATRE
(a film without actors, without sets, etc.)
This new experimentation work by Kino-Eye is directed towards the creation of an authentically international absolute language of cinema on the basis of its complete separation from the language of theatre and literature.
This manifesto echoes an earlier one that Vertov wrote in 1922, in which he disavowed popular films he felt were indebted to literature and theater.

==Stylistic aspects==
Working within a Marxist ideology, Vertov strove to create a futuristic city that would serve as a commentary on existing ideals in the Soviet world. This artificial city&#x27;s purpose was to awaken the Soviet citizen through truth and to ultimately bring about understanding and action. The kino&#x27;s aesthetic shone through in his portrayal of electrification, industrialization, and the achievements of workers through hard labor. This film is in keeping with modernist thoughts in how it challenges art both conceptually and in practice, incorporating industrial life and technology as featured subjects of the film and implementing new editing techniques. In utilizing these techniques, the artist creates a modern interpretation of city life.

Some have mistakenly stated that many visual ideas, such as the quick editing, the close-ups of machinery, the store window displays, even the shots of a typewriter keyboard are borrowed from Walter Ruttmann&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1927), which predates &quot;Man with a Movie Camera&quot; by two years, but as Vertov wrote to the German press in 1929, these techniques and images had been developed and employed by him in his Kino-Pravda newsreels and documentaries during the previous ten years, all of which predate &quot;Berlin&quot;. Vertov&#x27;s pioneering cinematic concepts actually inspired other abstract films by Ruttmann and others, including writer, translator, filmmaker and critic Liu Na&#x27;ou (1905–1940), whose &quot;The Man Who Has a Camera&quot; (1933) pays explicit homage to Vertov&#x27;s &quot;Man with a Movie Camera&quot;.

&quot;Man with a Movie Camera&quot;″s usage of double exposure and seemingly &quot;hidden&quot; cameras made the movie come across as a surreal montage rather than a linear motion picture. Many of the scenes in the film contain people, who change size or appear underneath other objects (double exposure). Because of these aspects, the movie is fast-moving. The sequences and close-ups capture emotional qualities that could not be fully portrayed through the use of words. The film&#x27;s lack of &quot;actors&quot; and &quot;sets&quot; makes for a unique view of the everyday world; one that, according to a title card, is directed toward the creation of a new cinematic language that is &quot;[separated] from the language of theatre and literature&quot;.

==Production==

It was filmed over a period of about three years. Four cities — Moscow, Kiev, Kharkov and Odessa — were the shooting locations.

==Reception==
===Initial===
&quot;Man with a Movie Camera&quot; was not always a highly regarded work. The film was criticized for both the stagings and the stark experimentation, possibly as a result of its director&#x27;s frequent assailing of fiction film as a new &quot;opiate of the masses&quot;.

Vertov&#x27;s Soviet contemporaries criticized its focus on form over content, with Sergei Eisenstein even deriding the film as &quot;pointless camera hooliganism&quot;. The work was largely dismissed in the West as well. Documentary filmmaker Paul Rotha said that in Britain, Vertov was &quot;regarded really as rather a joke, you know. All this cutting, and one camera photographing another camera – it was all trickery, and we didn&#x27;t take it seriously.&quot; The pace of the film&#x27;s editing – more than four times faster than a typical 1929 feature, with approximately 1,775 separate shots – also perturbed some viewers, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ reviewer Mordaunt Hall: &quot;The producer, Dziga Vertov, does not take into consideration the fact that the human eye fixes for a certain space of time that which holds the attention.&quot;

===Re-evaluation===
&quot;Man with a Movie Camera&quot; is now regarded by many as one of the greatest films ever made, ranking 9th in the 2022 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; poll of the world&#x27;s best films. In 2009, Roger Ebert wrote: &quot;It made explicit and poetic the astonishing gift the cinema made possible, of arranging what we see, ordering it, imposing a rhythm and language on it, and transcending it.&quot; The National Oleksandr Dovzhenko Film Centre placed it in 2021 at number three of their list of the 100 best films in the history of Ukrainian cinema.

==Analysis==
&quot;Man with a Movie Camera&quot; has been interpreted as an optimistic work. Jonathan Romney called it &quot;an exuberant manifesto that celebrates the infinite possibilities of what cinema can be&quot;. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that the work &quot;is visibly excited about the new medium&#x27;s possibility, dense with ideas, packed with energy: it echoes &quot;Un Chien Andalou&quot;, anticipates Vigo&#x27;s &quot;À propos de Nice&quot; and the New Wave generally, and even Riefenstahl&#x27;s &quot;Olympia&quot;.

<text>Lucian Pulvermacher (born Earl Pulvermacher, 20 April 1918 – 30 November 2009) was a traditionalist schismatic Roman Catholic priest and a modern-day antipope. He was the head of the True Catholic Church, a small conclavist group that elected him Pope Pius XIII in Montana in October 1998. At the time of his death, he lived in Springdale, Washington, United States.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Born on April 20, 1918, in Rock, Wisconsin, near Marshfield, Earl Pulvermacher was one of nine children of a farm family. His three brothers (Robert, Omer, and Gerald) also became priests in the Capuchin Order.
===Capuchin friar===
In 1942, at the age of 24, he joined the Capuchin Order, taking the religious name &quot;Lucian.&quot; He was subsequently ordained to the priesthood on June 5, 1946. At first he was posted to a parish in Milwaukee, but in 1948 he was sent to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. He spent the greater part of his career as a Capuchin (from 1948 to 1970) in the Ryukyu Islands, including Okinawa. In 1970, he was transferred from Japan to Queensland in Australia, where he continued his missionary work until his disillusionment with the changes that followed the Second Vatican Council of 1962–1965.

===Traditionalist ministry===
In January 1976 he left the Capuchin Order and returned to the United States to join forces with traditionalist priest Conrad Altenbach in Milwaukee. &quot;I was without money,&quot; he later remembered, &quot;without a home or anything. The few things I brought along with me I could carry in two bags.&quot; He left what he called &quot;the Novus Ordo, bogus Council Vatican II Church&quot; and began to collaborate with the Society of Saint Pius X, which rejected Vatican II, until he distanced himself from them as he adopted more extreme sedevacantist views. He later wrote that he had spent eight months &quot;with the general Latin Mass traditionalists until I saw there was no unity. Hence, I am alone on the job here in the States since August 1976.&quot; 

From 1976 on, Pulvermacher lived with his parents in Pittsville, Wisconsin, celebrating Mass in the traditional rite in private chapels, until 1992, when he moved his ministry to Antigo, Wisconsin. By 1995 he had adopted conclavist views. In 1998 he moved to Kalispell, Montana, invited to say Mass in a chapel there.

In October 1998 a group of sedevacantist lay Catholics met in Kalispell, constituting a conclave for a papal election. They elected him, and he adopted the title of &quot;Pope Pius XIII&quot;. From Montana he issued statements, appointed advisors as cardinals, and performed ordination rites. After 2005, he made no more public statements as his health declined.

Pulvermacher died on November 30, 2009.

==Holy Orders==

Pulvermacher claimed that by becoming Pope, he would become able to confer the Sacrament of Holy Orders despite not actually being consecrated a bishop before. He then ordained Gordon Bateman on June 13, 1999 and eventually consecrated him a bishop on June 20, 1999. After this, Bateman consecrated Pulvermacher on July 4, 1999. Although Pulvermacher and Bateman claimed to be bishops, no other religion with apostolic succession has recognized them as such.

<doc id="185576" wikidata="Q46599" url="?curid=185576" title="Mikhail Lermontov">
<text>Mikhail Yuryevich Lermontov ( , ; ; – ) was a Russian Romantic writer, poet and painter, sometimes called &quot;the poet of the Caucasus&quot;, the most important Russian poet after Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s death in 1837 and the greatest figure in Russian Romanticism. His influence on Russian literature is felt in modern times, through his poetry, but also his prose, which founded the tradition of the Russian psychological novel.

Lermontov was born on October 15, 1814 in Moscow into the Lermontov family and grew up in Tarkhany. Lermontov&#x27;s father, Yuri Petrovich, was a military officer who married Maria Mikhaylovna Arsenyeva, a young heiress from an aristocratic family. Their marriage was unhappy, Maria&#x27;s health deteriorated, and she died of tuberculosis in 1817. A family dispute ensued over Lermontov&#x27;s custody, resulting in his grandmother, Elizaveta Arsenyeva, raising him. She provided excellent home education, nurturing his talents in languages, music, and painting. However, his health was fragile, and he suffered from scrofula and rickets. His grandmother&#x27;s strict control caused him emotional turmoil, leading to his development as a lonely and introspective individual. Lermontov&#x27;s early life experiences and education laid the foundation for his literary achievements.

In 1827, Lermontov moved to Moscow with his grandmother and joined the Moscow University&#x27;s boarding school. He excelled academically, influenced by his tutors Alexey Merzlyakov and Semyon Rayich, and started to write poetry. By 1829, Lermontov had written notable poems. His literary career began to take shape, with his early works reflecting the influences of Alexander Pushkin and Lord Byron. Lermontov&#x27;s early education included extensive travel to the Caucasus for his health, which greatly impressed him and influenced his work.

In 1832, Lermontov moved to Saint Petersburg and enrolled in the School of Cavalry Junkers and Ensign of the Guard, eventually joining the Life-Guard Hussar regiment. His literary career flourished, but his sharp wit and satirical works earned him many enemies. The poem &quot;Death of the Poet,&quot; written after the death of Alexander Pushkin, gained Lermontov significant fame, but led to his first exile to the Caucasus due to its controversial content. During his exile, Lermontov continued to write, producing some of his most famous works, including &quot;A Hero of Our Time&quot;. His experiences in the Caucasus provided rich material for his poetry and prose. Despite returning to St. Petersburg briefly, his rebellious nature and another duel led to his second exile. In 1841, Lermontov was killed in a duel with fellow officer Nikolai Martynov. His death marked the loss of one of Russia&#x27;s most promising literary talents.

==Background==
Mikhail Yuryevich Lermontov was born in Moscow into the Lermontov family, and he grew up in the village of Tarkhany (now Lermontovo in Penza Oblast). His paternal family descended from the Scottish family of Learmonth, and can be traced to Yuri (George) Learmonth, a Scottish officer in the Polish–Lithuanian service who settled in Russia in the middle of the 17th century. He had been captured by the Russian troops in Poland in the early 17th century, during the reign (1613–1645) of Mikhail Fyodorovich Romanov. Family legend asserted that George Learmonth descended from the famed 13th-century Scottish poet Thomas the Rhymer (also known as Thomas Learmonth). Lermontov&#x27;s father, Yuri Petrovich Lermontov, like his father before him, followed a military career. Having moved up the ranks to captain, he married the sixteen-year-old Maria Mikhaylovna Arsenyeva, a wealthy young heiress of a prominent aristocratic Stolypin family. Lermontov&#x27;s maternal grandmother, Elizaveta Arsenyeva (née Stolypina), regarded their marriage as a mismatch and deeply disliked her son-in-law. On 15 October 1814, in Moscow where the family temporarily moved to, Maria gave birth to her son Mikhail.

==Early life==
The marriage proved ill-suited and the couple soon grew apart. &quot;There is no strong evidence as to what precipitated the quarrels they&#x27;d had. There are reasons to believe Yuri had grown tired of his wife&#x27;s nervousness and frail health, and his mother-in-law&#x27;s despotic ways,&quot; according to literary historian and Lermontov scholar Alexander Skabichevsky. An earlier biographer, Pavel Viskovatov, suggested the discord might have been caused by Yuri&#x27;s affair with a young woman named Yulia, a lodger who worked in the house. Apparently it was her husband&#x27;s violent, erratic behavior and the resulting stresses that accounted for Maria Mikhaylovna&#x27;s early demise. Her health quickly deteriorated and she developed tuberculosis and died on 27 February 1817, aged only 21.

Nine days after Maria&#x27;s death a final row broke out in Tarkhany and Yuri rushed away to his Kropotovo estate in Tula Governorate where his five sisters resided. Yelizaveta Arsenyeva launched a formidable battle for her beloved grandson, promising to disinherit him if his father took the boy away. Eventually the two sides agreed that the boy should stay with his grandmother until the age of 16. Father and son separated and, at the age of three, Lermontov began a spoilt and luxurious life with his doting grandmother and numerous relatives. This bitter family feud formed a plot of Lermontov&#x27;s early drama &quot;Menschen und Leidenschaften&quot; (1830), its protagonist Yuri bearing strong resemblance to the young Mikhail.
In June 1817, Yelizaveta Alekseyevna moved her grandson to Penza. In 1821 they returned to Tarkhany and spent the next six years there. The doting grandmother spared no expense to provide the young Lermontov with the best schooling and lifestyle that money could buy. He received an extensive home education, became fluent in French and German, learned to play several musical instruments and proved a gifted painter. While living with the grandmother, Mikhail hardly met with his father.

But the boy&#x27;s health was fragile, he suffered from scrofula and rickets (the latter accounted for his bow-leggedness) and was kept under close surveillance of a French doctor, Anselm Levis. Colonel Capet, a Napoleon army prisoner-of-war who settled in Russia after 1812, was the boy&#x27;s first, and best-loved governor. A German pedagogue, Levy, who succeeded Capet, introduced Mikhail to Goethe and Schiller. He didn&#x27;t stay for long and soon another Frenchman, Gendrot, replaced him, soon joined by Mr. Windson, a respectable English teacher recommended by the Uvarov family. Later Alexander Zinoviev, a teacher of Russian literature, arrived. The intellectual atmosphere in which Lermontov grew up resembled that experienced by Aleksandr Pushkin, though the domination of French had begun to give way to a preference for English, and Lamartine shared popularity with Byron.

Looking for a better climate and treatment at the mineral springs for the boy, Arsenyeva twice, in 1819 and 1820, took him to the Caucasus where they stayed at her sister E. A. Khasatova&#x27;s. In summer 1825, as the nine-year-old&#x27;s health started to deteriorate, the extended family traveled south for the third time. The Caucasus greatly impressed the boy, inspiring a passion for its mountains and stirring beauty. &quot;Caucasian mountains for me are sacred&quot;, he wrote later. It was there that Lermontov experienced his first romantic passion, falling for a nine-year-old girl.
Fearing that Lermontov&#x27;s father would eventually claim his right to bring up his son, Arsenyeva strictly limited contact between the two, causing young Lermontov much pain and remorse. Despite all the pampering lavished upon him, and torn by the family feud, he grew up lonely and withdrawn. In another early autobiographical piece, &quot;Povest&quot; (The Tale), Lermontov described himself (under the guise of Sasha Arbenin) as an impressionable boy, passionately in love with all things heroic, but otherwise emotionally cold and occasionally . Having developed a fearful and arrogant temper, he took it out on his grandmother&#x27;s garden as well as on insects and small animals (&quot;with great delight, he would squash a hapless fly and bristled with joy when a stone he&#x27;d thrown would kick a chicken off its feet&quot;). Positive influence came from Lermontov&#x27;s German governess Christina Rhemer, a religious woman who introduced the boy to the idea of every man, even if that man was a serf, deserving respect. In fact, Lermontov&#x27;s poor health served in a way as a saving grace, Skabichevsky argued, for it prevented the boy from further exploring the darker sides of his character and, more importantly, &quot;taught him to think of things... seek pleasures that he couldn&#x27;t find in the outer world, deep inside himself.&quot;

Returning from his third trip to the Caucasus in August 1825, Lermontov began his regular studies with tutors in French and Greek, starting to read German, French and English authors&#x27; original texts. In summer 1827 the 12-year-old for the first time travelled to his father&#x27;s estate in Tula Governorate. In autumn of that year he and Yelizaveta Arsenyeva moved to Moscow.

== School years ==
After having received a year of private tutoring, in February 1829 the fourteen-year old Lermontov took exams and joined the 5th form of the Moscow University&#x27;s boarding-school for the nobility&#x27;s children. Here his personal tutor was poet Alexey Merzlyakov, alongside Zinoviev, who taught Russian and Latin. Under their influence the boy started to read a lot, making the best of his vast home library, which included books by Mikhail Lomonosov, Gavrila Derzhavin, Ivan Dmitriev, Vladislav Ozerov, Konstantin Batyushkov, Ivan Krylov, Ivan Kozlov, Vasily Zhukovsky, and Alexander Pushkin. Soon he started editing an amateur student journal. One of his friends, his cousin Yekaterina Sushkova (Khvostova, in marriage) described the young man as &quot;married to a hefty volume of Byron&quot;. Yekaterina had at one time been the object of Lermontov&#x27;s affections and to her he dedicated some of his late 1820s poems, including &quot;Nishchy&quot; (The Beggar). By 1829 Lermontov had written several of his well-known early poems. While &quot;Kavkazsky Plennik&quot; (Caucasian Prisoner), betraying strong Pushkin influence and borrowing from the latter, &quot;The Corsair&quot;, &quot;Prestupnik&quot; (The Culprit), &quot;Oleg&quot;, &quot;Dva Brata&quot; (Two Brothers), as well as the original version of &quot;The Demon&quot; were impressive exercises in Romanticism. Lord Byron remained the major source of inspiration for Lermontov, despite the attempts of his literary tutors, including Semyon Rayich, the head of the school&#x27;s literature class, to divert him from that particular influence. The short poem &quot;Vesna&quot; (The Spring), published in 1830 by the amateur &quot;Ateneum&quot; magazine, marked his informal publishing debut.

Along with his poetic skills, Lermontov developed an inclination towards poisonous wit and cruel, sardonic humor. His ability to draw caricatures was matched only by his ability to pin someone down with a well aimed epigram. In the boarding school Lermontov proved an exceptional student. He excelled at the 1828 examinations; he recited a Zhukovsky poem, performed a violin étude and won the first prize for his literary essay. In April 1830 the University&#x27;s boarding school was transformed into an ordinary gymnasium and Lermontov, like many of his fellow-students, promptly quit.

== Moscow University ==
In August 1830, Lermontov enrolled in Moscow University&#x27;s philological faculty. &quot;Petty arrogance&quot; (as Skabichevsky puts it) prevented him from joining any of the three radical students&#x27; circles (those led respectively by Vissarion Belinsky, Nikolai Stankevich and Alexander Hertzen). Instead he drifted towards an aristocracic clique, but even this cream of the Moscow&#x27;s &quot;golden youth&quot; detested the young man for being too aloof, while still giving him credit for having charisma. &quot;Everyone could see that Lermontov was obnoxious, rough and daring, and yet there was something alluring in his firm moroseness,&quot; fellow-student Wistengof admitted.
Attending lectures faithfully, Lermontov would often read a book in the corner of the auditorium, and never took part in student life, making exceptions only for incidents involving grand-scale trouble-making. He took an active part in the notorious 1831 Malov scandal (when a jeering mob drove the unpopular professor out of the auditorium), but wasn&#x27;t formally reprimanded (unlike Hertzen, who found himself incarcerated). A year into his university studies, the final, tragic act of the family discord played itself out. Deeply affected by his son&#x27;s alienation, Yuri Lermontov left Arsenieva&#x27;s house for good, only to die a short time later of consumption. His father&#x27;s death under such circumstances was a terrible loss for Mikhail and is reflected in his poems &quot;Forgive Me, Will We Meet Again?&quot; and &quot;The Terrible Fate of Father and Son&quot;. For some time he seriously considered suicide; tellingly, each of his early dramas &quot;Menschen und Leidenschaften&quot; (1830) and &quot;A Strange Man&quot; (1831) ends with a protagonist killing himself. All the while, judging by his diaries, Lermontov, maintained a keen interest in European politics. Some of his University poems like &quot;Predskazaniye&quot; (The Prophecy) were highly politicised; the unfinished &quot;Povest Bez Nazvaniya&quot; (The Untitled Novel)&#x27;s theme was the outbreak of popular uprising in Russia. Several other verses written at the time – &quot;Parus&quot; (The Sail), &quot;Angel Smerti&quot; (Angel of Death) and &quot;Ismail-Bei&quot; – later came to be regarded among his best.

In Lermontov&#x27;s first year as a student no exams were held: the University closed for several months due to the outbreak of cholera in Moscow. In his second year Lermontov started to have serious altercations with several of his professors. Thinking little of his chances of passing the exams, he opted to leave, and on 18 June 1832, received the two-year-graduate certificate.

== 1832–1837 ==
In mid-1832, Lermontov accompanied by grandmother, traveled to Saint Petersburg, with a view of joining the Saint Petersburg University&#x27;s second-year course. This proved impossible and, unwilling to repeat the first year, he enrolled into the prestigious School of Cavalry Junkers and Ensign of the Guard, under pressure from his male relatives but much to Arsenyeva&#x27;s distress. Having passed the exams, on 14 November 1832, Lermontov joined the Life-Guard Hussar regiment as a junior officer. One of his fellow cadet-school students, Nikolai Martynov, the one whose fatal shot would kill the poet several years later, in his biographical &quot;Notes&quot; decades later described him as &quot;the young man who was so far ahead of everybody else, as to be beyond comparison,&quot; a &quot;real grown-up who&#x27;d read and thought and understood a lot about the human nature.&quot;
The sort of glittering army career which tempted young noblemen of the time proved a challenge for Lermontov. Books there were a rarity and reading was frowned upon. Lermontov had to indulge mostly in physical competitions, one of which resulted in a horse-riding accident which left him with a broken knee that produced a limp. Learning to enjoy the heady mix of drills and discipline, wenching and drinking sprees, Lermontov continued to sharpen the poisonous wit and cruel humour which would often earn him enemies. &quot;The time of my dreams has passed; the time for believing is long gone; now I want material pleasures, happiness that I can touch, happiness that can be bought with gold, that one can carry it in one&#x27;s pocket as a snuff-box; happiness that beguiles only my senses while leaving my soul in peace and quiet,&quot; he wrote in a letter to Maria Lopukhina dated 4 August 1833.

Concealing his literary aspirations from friends (relatives Alexey Stolypin and Nikolai Yuriev among them), Lermontov became an expert in producing scabrous verses (like &quot;Holiday in Petergof&quot;, &quot;Ulansha&quot;, and &quot;The Hospital&quot;) which were published in a school&#x27;s amateur magazine &quot;Shkolnaya Zarya&quot; (School-Years&#x27; Dawn) under monikers &quot;Count Diarbekir&quot; and &quot;Stepanov&quot;. These pieces earned him much notoriety and, with a hindsight, caused harm, for when in July 1835 for the first time ever his poem &quot;Khadji-Abrek&quot; was published (in &quot;Biblioteka Dlya Chteniya&quot;, without its author&#x27;s consent: Nikolai Yuriev took the copy to Osip Senkovsky and he furthered it to print), many refused to take the young author seriously.

Upon his graduation in November 1834, Lermontov joined the Life-Guard Hussar regiment stationed near St. Petersburg in Tsarskoye Selo, where his flatmate was his friend Svyatoslav Rayevsky. Grandmother&#x27;s lavish financial support (he had his personal chefs and coachmen) enabled Lermontov to plunge into a heady high-society mix of drawing-room gossip and ballroom glitter. &quot;Sardonic, caustic and smart, brilliantly intelligent, rich and independent, he became the soul of the high society and the leading spirit in pleasure trips and sprees,&quot; Yevdokiya Rostopchina remembered. &quot;Extraordinary, how much youthful energy and precious time had Lermontov managed to spare upon wanton orgies and base love-making, without seriously damaging his physical and moral strength&quot;, biographer Skabichevsky marvelled.

By now Lermontov had learnt to lead a double life. Still keeping his passions secret, he took a keen interest in Russian history and medieval epics, which would be reflected in &quot;The Song of the Merchant Kalashnikov&quot; and &quot;Borodino&quot;, as well as a series of popular ballads. During what he later referred to as &quot;four wasted years&quot; he finished &quot;Demon&quot;, wrote &quot;Boyarin Orsha&quot;, &quot;The Tambov Treasurer&#x27;s Wife&quot; and &quot;Masquerade&quot;, his best-known drama. Through Rayevsky he became acquainted with Andrey Krayevsky, then the editor of Russky Invalid&#x27;s literary supplement, in a couple of years&#x27; time to become the editor of the influential journal &quot;Otechestvennye Zapiski&quot;.

===&quot;Death of the Poet&quot;===
The death of Pushkin, who, as it was generally suspected, had fallen victim to an intrigue, ignited Russian high society. Lermontov, who himself never belonged to the Pushkin circle (there is conflicting evidence as to whether he&#x27;d met the famous poet at all), became especially vexed with Saint Petersburg dames&#x27; sympathizing with D&#x27;Anthès, a culprit whom he even considered challenging to a duel.

Outraged and agitated, the young man found himself on the verge of nervous breakdown. Arsenyeva sent for Arendt, and the famous doctor who had spent with Pushkin his last hours related to Lermontov the exact circumstances of what had happened. The poem &quot;Death of the Poet&quot;, its final part written impromptu, in the course of several minutes, was spread around by Rayevsky and caused uproar. The last 16 lines of it, explicitly addressed to the inner circles at the court, all but accused the powerful &quot;pillars&quot; of Russian high-society of complicity in Pushkin&#x27;s death. The poem portrayed that society as a cabal of self-interested venomous wretches &quot;huddling about the throne in a greedy throng&quot;, &quot;the hangmen who kill liberty, genius, and glory&quot; about to suffer the apocalyptic judgment of God.

The poem propelled Lermontov to an unprecedented level of fame. Zhukovsky hailed the &quot;new powerful talent&quot;; popular opinion greeted him as &quot;Pushkin&#x27;s heir&quot;. D&#x27;Anthes, still under arrest, felt so piqued he was now himself prepared to challenge the upstart to a duel. Alexander von Benckendorff, a distant relative of Arsenyeva&#x27;s and the founding head of the Tsar&#x27;s Gendarmes and of his secret police, was willing to help her grandson out but still had no choice but to report the incident to Nicholas I, who, as it turned out, had already received a copy of the poem (subtitled &quot;The Call for the Revolution&quot;, from an anonymous sender). The authorities arrested Lermontov, on 21 January he found himself in the Petropavlovskaya fortress and on 25 February got banished as a cornet to the Nizhegorodsky dragoons regiment to the Caucasus. During the investigation, in an act he considered cowardice, Lermontov faulted his friend, Svyatoslav Rayevsky, and as a result the latter suffered a more severe punishment than Lermontov did: was deported to the Olonets Governorate for two years to serve in a lowly clerk&#x27;s position.

==First exile==
In the Caucasus Lermontov found himself quite at home. The stern and gritty virtues of the mountain tribesmen against whom he had to fight, no less than the scenery of the rocks and of the mountains themselves, were close to his heart. The place of his exile was also the land he had loved as a child. Attracted to the nature of the Caucasus and excited by its folklore, he studied the local languages (such as Kumyk), wrote some of his most splendid poems and painted extensively. &quot;Good people are here aplenty. In Tiflis, especially, people are very honest... The mountain air acts like balsam for me, all spleen has gone to hell, the heart starts beating, the chest heaves,&quot; Lermontov wrote to Rayevsky. By the end of the year he had travelled all along the Caucasian line, from Kizlyar Bay to Taman Peninsula, and visited central Georgia.

Lermontov&#x27;s first Caucasian exile was short: due to the intercession of General Benckendorff. The poet was transferred to the Grodno cavalry regiment based at Nizhny Novgorod. His voyage back was a prolonged one, he made a point of staying wherever he was welcome. In Shelkozavodskaya Lermontov met A. A. Khastatov (his grandmother&#x27;s sister&#x27;s son), a man famous for his bravery, whose stories were later incorporated into &quot;A Hero of Our Time&quot;. In Pyatigorsk he had talks with poet and translator Nikolai Satin (a member of Herzen and Ogaryov circle) and with some of the Decembrists, notably with the poet Alexander Odoyevsky (with whom, judging by &quot;In Memoriam&quot;, 1839, he became quite close); in Stavropol became friends with Dr. Mayer who served as a prototype for Doctor Werner (a man Pechorin meets in &quot;town S.&quot;). In Tiflis he drifted towards a group of Georgian intellectuals led by Alexander Chavchavadze, Nina Griboyedova&#x27;s father.
The young officer&#x27;s demeanor did not enchant everybody, though, and at least two of the Decembrists, Nikolai Lorer and Mikhail Nazimov, later spoke of him quite dismissively. Nazimov wrote years later:

Lermontov often visited us and talked of all sort of things, personal, social and political. I have to say, we hardly understood each other... We were unpleasantly surprised by the chaotic nature of his views, which were rather vague. He appeared to be a low-brow realist, unwilling to let his imagination fly, which was strange, considering how high his poetry soared on its mighty wings. He mocked some of the government&#x27;s reforms – the ones we couldn&#x27;t even dream of in our poor youth. Certain essays, promoting the most progressive European ideas which we were so enthusiastic about, – for who could have ever thought it possible for such things to be published in Russia? – left him cold. When approached with a straightforward question, he either kept silent or tried to get away with some sarcastic remark. The more we knew him, the more difficult it was for us to take him seriously. There was a spark of original thought in him, but he was still very young.

Lermontov&#x27;s journey to Nizhny took four months. He visited Yelizavetgrad, then stayed in Moscow and Saint Petersburg to enjoy himself at dancing parties and to revel in his immense popularity. &quot;Lermontov&#x27;s deportation to the Caucasus has made a lot of fuss and turned him into a victim, which did a lot to whip up his fame as a poet. People consumed his Caucasian poems greedily... On return he was met with enormous warmth in the capital and hailed as heir to Pushkin,&quot; wrote poet Andrey Muravyov.

Warmly welcomed at the houses of Karamzin, Alexandra Smirnova, Odoyevsky and Rostoptchina, Lermontov entered the most prolific phase of his short literary career. In 1837–1838 &quot;Sovremennik&quot; published humorous lyrical verses and two longer poems, &quot;Borodino&quot; and &quot;Tambovskaya Kaznatcheysha&quot; (A Treasurer Dame from Tambov), the latter severely cut by censors. Vasily Zhukovsky&#x27;s letter to Minister Sergey Uvarov made possible the publication of &quot;Pesn Kuptsa Kalashnikova&quot; (The Song of Merchant Kalashnikov), a historical poem which the author initially sent to Krayevsky in 1837 from the Caucasus, only to be thwarted by censors. His observations of the aristocratic milieu, where fashionable ladies welcomed him as a celebrity, occasioned his play &quot;Masquerade&quot; (1835, first published in 1842). His doomed love for Varvara Lopukhina (b. Varvara Alexandrovna Lopukhina) was recorded in the novel &quot;Princess Ligovskaya&quot; (1836), which remained unfinished. In those days Lermontov also took part in gathering and sorting out Pushkin&#x27;s documents and unpublished poems.

===&quot;A Hero of Our Time&quot;===

In February 1838, Lermontov arrived at Novgorod to join his new regiment. In less than two months time, though, Arsenyeva ensured his transfer to the Petersburg-based Hussars Guard regiment. At this point, in Petersburg, Lermontov started working on &quot;A Hero of Our Time&quot;, a novel which later earned him recognition as one of the founding fathers of Russian prose.

In January 1839, Andrey Krayevsky, now at the helm of &quot;Otechestvennye Zapiski&quot;, invited Lermontov to become a regular contributor. The magazine published two parts of the novel, &quot;Bela&quot; and &quot;The Fatalist&quot;, in issues 2 and 4, respectively, the rest of it appeared in print during 1840 and earned the author widespread acclaim. The partially autobiographical story, describing prophetically a duel like the one in which he would eventually lose his life, consisted of five closely linked tales revolving around a single character, a disenchanted, bored and doomed young nobleman. Later it came to be considered a pioneering classic of Russian psychological realism.

==Second exile==

Shallow pleasures offered by Saint Petersburg&#x27;s high society had started to wear Lermontov down, his bad temper growing even worse. &quot;What an extravagant man he is. Looks like he&#x27;s heading for the imminent catastrophe. Insolent to a fault. Dying of boredom, getting vexed by his own frivolousness but having no will to break free from these surroundings. A strange kind of man,&quot; wrote Alexandra Smirnova, the lady-in-waiting and Saint Petersburg fashionable salon hostess.

Lermontov&#x27;s popularity at the salons of Princess Sofija Shcherbatova and of Countess Emilie Musin-Pushkina caused a lot of ill feeling among men vying for attention of these two most popular Petersburg society girls of the time. In early 1840 Lermontov insulted one of these men, Ernest de Barante, the son of the French ambassador, in the presence of Shcherbatova. De Barante issued a challenge. The duel took place almost at the exact spot where Pushkin had received his fatal wound by Tchernaya Retchka. Lermontov found himself slightly injured, then arrested and jailed. His visitors in jail included Vissarion Belinsky, an avid admirer of Lermontov&#x27;s poetry who, like many, continued to have problems with making sense of his dual personality and incongruous, difficult character.

Due to the patronage of the Guard&#x27;s Commander, Grand Duke Mikhail Pavlovich, Lermontov received only a mild punishment; the Grand Duke chose to interpret the de Barante incident as a feat for &quot;a Russian officer who came up to champion the honour of the Russian army&quot;. With the Tsar&#x27;s initial demand for three months&#x27; imprisonment dropped, Lermontov went back to exile in the Caucasus, to the Tengin infantry regiment. In Karamzin&#x27;s house where his friends gathered to say farewells, he churned out an &quot;ad lib&quot;, &quot;Tuchi nebesnye, vechnye stranniki&quot; (Heavenly clouds, eternal travelers...). It made its way as a final entry into Lermontov&#x27;s first book of verse, published by Ilya Glazunov &amp; Co in October 1840, and became one of his best-loved short poems.

In early May 1840 Lermontov left Saint Petersburg, but arrived at Stavropol only on 10 June, having spent a whole month in Moscow, visiting (among other people) Nikolai Gogol, to whom he recited his then-new poem &quot;Mtsyri&quot;. On arrival, Lermontov re-joined the Army as part of General Galafeyev&#x27;s fighting unit on the left flank of the Caucasian front. The left flank had the mission of disarming the Chechen fighters led by Imam Shamil and of protecting the newly formed Russian Cossack settlement between the Kuban and Laba rivers. In early July the regiment entered Chechnya and went into action. Lermontov (according to the official report) &quot;has been charged with the commandment of a Cossack troopers&#x27; unit whose duty it was to head into the enemy first&quot;. He became immensely popular with his men, whom regular army officers referred to as &quot;the international gang of reckless thugs&quot;.

Among officers Lermontov had his admirers and detractors. Generals Pavel Grabbe and Apollon Galafeyev both praised the young man for his reckless bravery. According to Baron Rossilyon, though, &quot;Lermontov was an unpleasant and scornful man, always eager to seem special. He boasted his bravery – the one thing one was not supposed to be that proud of in the Caucasus, where bravery was business as usual. He led the gang of dirty thugs who, without ever using firearms, charged Chechen auls, led partisan wars and were calling themselves &#x27;the Lermontov army&#x27;.&quot;
In July 1840 the Russian army got involved in a fierce battle at the Gekha forest. There Lermontov distinguished himself in hand-to-hand combat at the Battle of the Valerik River (11 July 1840), the basis for his poem &quot;Valerik&quot;. &quot;Lermontov&#x27;s duty was to lead our forefront storm troopers and inform the headquarters of the advancement, which in itself was perilous since the enemy was everywhere around, in the forest and in the bushes. But this officer, defying danger, did an excellent job; he showed great courage and was always amongst those who&#x27;d break into the enemy lines first,&quot; General Galafeyev informed General Grabbe on 8 October 1840.

In early 1841 Arsenyeva received permission from the Minister of Defense, Count Kleinmichel, for Lermontov to visit Saint Petersburg. &quot;Those three or four months he spent in the capital were, I think, the happiest time of his life. Received quite ecstatically by the high society, each morning he produced some beautiful verse and hasted to recite it to us in the evening. In this warm atmosphere good humour awoke in him again, he was always coming up with new jokes and pranks, making us all laugh for hours on end,&quot; Yevdokiya Rostopchina remembered.
By the time both &quot;A Hero of Our Time&quot; and &quot;Poems by M.Y. Lermontov&quot; had been published, Lermontov, according to Skabichevsky, started to treat his poetic mission seriously. Looking for an early retirement that would have enabled him to start a literary career, he was making plans for his own literary journal which wouldn&#x27;t follow European trends, unlike (in Lermontov&#x27;s view) &quot;Otechestvennye Zapiski&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;ve learnt a lot from Easterners and I am eager to delve deeper into the depth of an Eastern mindset, which remains a mystery not only to us, but to an Easterner himself. The East is a bottomless well of revelations,&quot; Lermontov was telling Krayevsky.

It soon became clear that for an early retirement there was no hope. Besides, despite General Grabbe&#x27;s insistence, Lermontov&#x27;s name had been dropped from the list of officers eligible for awards. In February 1841 an incident at a ball launched by Countess Alexandra Vorontsova-Dashkova (when Lermontov involuntarily snubbed the Tsar&#x27;s two daughters) caused concern among the imperial family and in the high military ranks. It transpired that upon his arrival in February Lermontov had failed to report to his commanding officer, as was required, going instead to a ball – a grievous breach for someone serving under condition of punishment. In April Count Kleinmichel issued an order for him to leave the city in 24 hours and join his regiment in the Caucasus. Lermontov approached a seer (the same Gypsy woman who&#x27;d predicted Pushkin&#x27;s death &quot;from a white man&#x27;s hand&quot;) and asked if the time would ever come when he&#x27;d be allowed to retire. &quot;You will get your retirement, but of such a kind after which you won&#x27;t ask for more,&quot; she responded, which made Lermontov laugh heartily.

==Death==
After visiting Moscow (where he produced no fewer than eight poetic pieces of invective aimed at Benckendorff), on 9 May 1841, Lermontov arrived to Stavropol, introduced himself to general Grabbe and asked for permission to stay in the town. Then, on a whim, he changed his course, found himself in Pyatigorsk and sent his seniors a letter informing them of his having fallen ill. The regiment&#x27;s special commission recommended him treatment at Mineralnye Vody in the Caucasian Mineral Waters region. What he did instead was embark upon the several weeks&#x27; spree. &quot;In the mornings he was writing, but the more he worked, the more need he felt to unwind in the evenings,&quot; Skabichevsky wrote. &quot;I feel I&#x27;m left with very little of my life,&quot; the poet confessed to his friend A. Merinsky on 8 July, a week before his death.

In Pyatigorsk Lermontov enjoyed himself, feeding on his notoriety of a social misfit, his fame as a poet second only to Pushkin and his success with &quot;A Hero of Our Time&quot;. Meanwhile, in the same salons his Cadet school friend Nikolai Martynov, dressed as a native Circassian, wore a long sword, affected the manners of a romantic hero not unlike Lermontov&#x27;s Grushnitsky character. Lermontov teased Martynov mercilessly until the latter couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore. On 25 July 1841, Martynov challenged his offender to a duel. The fight took place two days later at the foot of Mashuk mountain. Lermontov allegedly made it known that he was going to shoot into the air. Martynov was the first to shoot and he aimed straight into the heart, killing his opponent on the spot. On 30 July Lermontov was buried, without military honours, thousands of people attended the ceremony.

In January 1842, the Tsar issued an order allowing the coffin to be transported to Tarkhany, where Lermontov was laid to rest at the family cemetery. Upon receiving the news his grandmother Elizaveta Arsenyeva suffered a minor stroke. She died in 1845. Many of Lermontov&#x27;s verses were discovered posthumously in his notebooks.

==Private life==
Mikhail Lermontov was a romantic who seemed to be continuously struggling with strong passions. Not much is known about his private life, though in verses dedicated to loved ones his emotional strife seems to have been exaggerated, while rumours concerning his real life adventures were unreliable and occasionally misguided.

Lermontov fell in love for the first time in 1825, while at the Caucasus, a girl of nine being the object of his desires. Five years later he wrote about it with great seriousness, seeing this early awakening of romantic feelings as a sign of his own exclusiveness. &quot;So early in life, at ten! Oh, this mystery, this Paradise Lost, it will be tormenting my mind till the very grave. Sometimes I feel funny about it and am ready to laugh at this first love of mine, but more often I&#x27;d rather cry,&quot; the 15-year-old wrote in a diary. &quot;Some people, like Byron, think early love is akin to the soul prone to fine arts, but I suppose this is the sign of soul that&#x27;s got much music in it,&quot; added the young man for whom the English poet was an idol.

At sixteen Lermontov fell in love with Yekaterina Sushkova (1812–1868), a friend of his cousin Sasha Vereshchagina, whom he often visited in Srednikovo village. Yekaterina failed to take her suitor seriously and in her &quot;Notes&quot; described him thus:At Sashenka [Vereshchagina]&#x27;s I often met her cousin, a clumsy bow-legged boy of 16 or 17, with reddened eyes, which were clever and expressive nevertheless, who had a turned-up nose and caustic sneer... Everybody was calling him just Michel and so did I, never caring about his second name. Assigned to be my &#x27;errand boy&#x27; he was carrying my hat, umbrella and gloves, leaving them behind from time to time... Both Sashenka and I, while giving him credit for his intelligence, still treated him like a baby which drove him mad. Trying to be perceived as a serious young man, he recited Pushkin and Lamartine and never parted with a huge volume of Byron.&quot;
Several 1830–31 poems by Lermontov were dedicated to Sushkova, among them &quot;Nishchy&quot; (The Beggar Man) and &quot;Blagodaryu!, Zovi nadezhdu snovidenyem&quot; (Thank you! To call the hope a dream...).
In 1830, Lermontov met Natalya Ivanova (1813–1875), daughter of a Moscow playwright Fyodor Ivanov and had an affair with her, but little is known about it or why it ended. Judging by thirty or so poems addressed to &quot;N.F.I&quot;, she chose a man who was older and richer, much to the distress of young Lermontov who took this as a &#x27;betrayal&#x27;.

While in the University 16-year-old Lermontov passionately fell in love with another cousin of his, Varvara Lopukhina&quot; (also sixteen at the time). The passion was said to be reciprocal but, pressed by her family, Varvara went on to marry Nikolai Bakhmetyev a wealthy 37-year-old aristocrat. Lermontov was &quot;astounded and heartbroken&quot;.

Having graduated the Saint Petersburg cadet school, Lermontov embarked upon the easy-going lifestyle of a reckless young hussar, as he imagined it should be. &quot;Mikhail, having found himself the very soul of the high society, liked to entertain himself by driving young women mad, feigning love for several days, just in order to upset matches,&quot; his friend and flatmate Alexey Stolypin wrote.

In December 1834, Lermontov met his old sweetheart Yekaterina Sushkova at a ball in Saint Petersburg and decided to have a revenge: first he seduced, then, after a while dropped her, making the story public. Relating the incident in a letter to cousin Sasha Vereshchagina, he blatantly boasted about his newly found reputation of a &#x27;Don Juan&#x27; which he&#x27;s been apparently craving for. &quot;I happened to hear several of Lermontov&#x27;s victims complaining about his treacherous ways and couldn&#x27;t restrict myself from openly laughing at the comic finales he used to invent for his vile Casanova feats,&quot; obviously sympathetic Yevdokiya Rostopchina recalled.

By 1840 Lermontov had sickened of his own reputation of a womanizer and a cruel heartbreaker, hunting for victims at balls and parties and leaving them behind devastated. Some of the stories were myth, like the one concerning the French author Adèle Hommaire de Hell; well-publicised at the time (and related at some length by Skabichevsky) it was proved later to have never happened.

Lermontov&#x27;s love for Lopukhina (Bakhmetyeva) proved to be the only deep and lasting feeling of his life. His unfinished drama Princess Ligovskaya was inspired by it, as well as two characters in &quot;A Hero of Our Time&quot;, Princess Mary and Vera. In his 1982 biography John Garrard wrote: &quot;The symbolic relationship between love and suffering is of course a favorite Romantic paradox, but for Lermontov it was much more than a literary device. He was unlucky in love and believed he always would be: fate had ordained it.&quot;

==Works==
In his lifetime, Mikhail Lermontov published only one slender collection of poems (1840). Three volumes, much mutilated by censorship, were published a year after his death in 1841. Yet his legacy – more than 30 large poems, and 600 minor ones, a novel and 5 dramas – was immense for an author whose literary career lasted just six years.

Inspired by Lord Byron, Lermontov started to write poetry at the age of 13. His late 1820s poems like &quot;The Corsair&quot;, &quot;Oleg&quot;, &quot;Two Brothers&quot;, as well as &quot;Napoleon&quot; (1830), borrowed somewhat from Pushkin, but invariably featured a Byronic hero, an outcast and an avenger, standing firm and aloof against the world.

In the early 1830s Lermontov&#x27;s poetry grew more introspective and intimate, even diary-like, with dates often serving for titles. But even his love lyric, addressed to Yekaterina Sushkova or Natalya Ivanova, could not be relied upon as autobiographical; driven by fantasies, it dealt with passions greatly hypertrophied, protagonists posing high and mighty in the center of the Universe, misunderstood or ignored.

In 1831, Lermontov&#x27;s poetry (&quot;The Reed&quot;, &quot;Mermaid&quot;, &quot;The Wish&quot;) started to get less confessional, more ballad-like. The young author, having found taste for plots and structures, was trying consciously to rein in his emotional urge and master the art of storytelling. Critic and literature historian D.S. Mirsky regards &quot;The Angel&quot; (1831) as the first of Lermontov&#x27;s truly great poems, calling it &quot;arguably the finest Romantic verse ever written in Russian.&quot; At least two other poems of that period – &quot;The Sail&quot; and &quot;The Hussar&quot; – were later rated among his best.

In 1832, Lermontov tried his hand at prose for the first time. The unfinished novel &quot;Vadim&quot;, telling the story of the 1773–1775 Yemelyan Pugachev-led peasant uprising, was stylistically flawed and short on ideas. Yet, free of Romantic pathos and featuring well-crafted characters as well as scenes from peasant life, it marked an important turn for the author now evidently intrigued more by history and folklore than by his own dreams.

Two branches of Lermontov&#x27;s early 1830s poetry – one dealing with the Russian Middle Age history, another with the Caucasus – couldn&#x27;t differ more. The former were stern and stark, featured a dark, reserved hero (&quot;The Last Son of Freedom&quot;), its straightforward storyline developing fast. The latter, rich with ethnographical side issues and lavish in colourful imagery, boasted flamboyant characters (&quot;Ismail-Bey&quot;, 1832).

Even as a Moscow University&#x27;s boarding school student Lermontov was a socially aware young man. His &quot;The Turk&#x27;s Lament&quot; (1829) expressed strong anti-establishment feelings (&quot;This place, where a man suffers from slavery and chains; my friend, this is my fatherland&quot;), the &quot;July 15, 1830&quot; poem greeted the July Revolution, while &quot;The Last Son of Freedom&quot; was a paean to (obviously, idealized) Novgorod Republic. But Lermontov, a fiery tribune, has never become a political poet. Full of inner turmoil and anger, his protagonists were riotous but never rational or promoting any particular ideology.

The Cadet School seemed to have stymied in Lermontov all interests except one, for wanton debauchery. His pornographic (and occasionally sadistic) Cavalry Junkers&#x27; poems which circulated in manuscripts, marred his subsequent reputation so much so that admission of familiarity with Lermontov&#x27;s poetry was not permissible for any young upper-class woman for a good part of the 19th century. &quot;Lermontov churned out for his pals whole poems in improvisational manner, dealing with things which were apparently part of their barrack and camp lifestyle. Those poems, which I&#x27;ve never read, for they weren&#x27;t intended for women, bear all the mark of the author&#x27;s brilliant, fiery temperament, as people who&#x27;ve read them attest&quot;, Yevdokiya Rostopchina admitted. These poems were published only once, in 1936, as part of a scholarly edition of Lermontov&#x27;s complete works, edited by Irakly Andronikov.

This lean period bore a few fruits: &quot;Khadji-Abrek&quot; (1835), his first ever published poem, and 1836&#x27;s &quot;Sashka&quot; (a &quot;darling son of Don Juan&quot;, according to Mirsky), a sparkling concoction of Romanticism, realism and what might be termed a cadet-style verse. The latter remained unfinished, as did &quot;Princess Ligovskaya&quot; (1836), a society tale which was influenced at least to some extent by Gogol&#x27;s &quot;Petersburg Stories&quot; and featured characters and dilemmas not far removed from those that would form the base of &quot;A Hero of Our Time&quot;.
Arrested, jailed and sent to the Caucasus in 1837, Lermontov dropped &quot;Princess Ligovskaya&quot; and never got back to it. Much more important to him was &quot;The Masquerade&quot;; written in 1835, it got re-worked several times – the author tried desperately to publish it. Close to French melodrama and influenced by Victor Hugo and Alexander Dumas (but also owing a lot to Shakespeare, Griboyedov and Pushkin), &quot;Masquerade&quot; featured another hero whose want was to &#x27;throw a gauntlet&#x27; to the unsympathetic society and then get tired of his own conflicting nature, but was interesting mostly for its realistic sketches of the high society life, which Lermontov was getting more and more critical of.

Lermontov&#x27;s fascination with Byron has never waned. &quot;Having made the English pessimism a brand of his own, he&#x27;s imparted it a strong national favour to produce the very special Russian spleen, which has been there always in the Russian soul... Devoid of cold skepticism or icy irony, Lermontov&#x27;s poetry is full instead of typically Russian contempt for life and material values. This mix of deep melancholy on the one hand and wild urge for freedom on the other, could be found only in Russian folk songs,&quot; biographer Skabichevsky wrote.

In 1836–1838, Lermontov&#x27;s interest in history and folklore re-awakened. Eclectic &quot;Boyarin Orsha&quot; (1836), featuring a pair of conflicting heroes, driven one by blind passions, another by obligations and laws of honour, married the Byronic tradition with the elements of historical drama and folk epos. An ambitious folk epic, &quot;The Song of the Merchant Kalashnikov&quot; (initially banned, then published in 1837 due to Vasily Zhukovsky&#x27;s efforts), was unique for its unexpected authenticity. Lermontov, who haven&#x27;t got a single academic source to rely upon, &quot;entered the realm of folklore as a real master and totally merged with its spirit,&quot; according to Belinsky. Lermontov&#x27;s &quot;Cossack Lullaby&quot; &quot;went the whole round: from the original folklore source to literature, and from literature to living folklore. ... For one and a half centuries people have performed these literary lullabies in real lulling situations [in Russia],&quot; according to Valentin Golovin.

&quot;Death of the Poet&quot; (1837), arguably the strongest political declaration of its time (its last two lines, &quot;and all of your black blood won&#x27;t be enough to expiate the poet&#x27;s pure blood&quot;, construed by some as a direct call for violence), made Lermontov not just famous, but almost worshipped, as a &quot;true heir to Pushkin&quot;. More introspective but no less subversive was his &quot;The Thought&quot; (1838), an answer to Kondraty Ryleyev&#x27;s &quot;The Citizen&quot; (1824), damning the lost generation of &quot;servile slaves&quot;.

Otherwise, Lermontov&#x27;s short poems range from indignantly patriotic pieces like &quot;Fatherland&quot; to the pantheistic glorification of living nature (e.g., &quot;Alone I set out on the road ...&quot;) Some saw Lermontov&#x27;s early verse as puerile, since, despite his dexterous command of the language, it usually appeals more to adolescents than to adults. Later poems, like &quot;The Poet&quot; (1838), &quot;Don&#x27;t Believe Yourself&quot; (1839) and &quot;So Dull, So Sad...&quot; (1840) expressed skepticism as to the meaning of poetry and life itself. On the other hand, for Lermontov the late 1830s was a period of transition; drawn more to Russian forests and fields rather than Caucasian ranges, he achieved moments of transcendental solemnity and clear vision of heaven and Earth merged into one in poems like &quot;The Branch of Palestine&quot;, &quot;The Prayer&quot; and &quot;When yellowish fields get ruffled...&quot;
Both his patriotic and pantheistic poems had an enormous influence on later Russian literature. Boris Pasternak, for instance, dedicated his 1917 poetic collection of signal importance to the memory of Lermontov&#x27;s &quot;Demon&quot;. This long poem (started as early as 1829 and finished some ten years after) told the story of a fallen angel admitting defeat in the moment of his victory over Tamara, a Georgian &quot;maid of mountains&quot;. Having read by censors as the celebration of carnal passions of the &quot;eternal spirit of atheism&quot;, it remained banned for years (and was published for the first time in 1856 in Berlin), turning arguably the most popular unpublished Russian poem of the mid-19th century. Even Mirsky, who ridiculed Demon as &quot;the least convincing Satan in the history of the world poetry,&quot; called him &quot;an operatic character&quot; and fitting perfectly into the concept of Anton Rubinstein&#x27;s lush opera (also banned by censors who deemed it sacrilegious) had to admit the poem had magic enough to inspire Mikhail Vrubel for his series of unforgettable images.

Another 1839 poem investigating the deeper reasons for the author&#x27;s metaphysical discontent with society and himself was &quot;The Novice&quot;, or Mtsyri (in Georgian), the harrowing story of a dying young monk who&#x27;d preferred dangerous freedom to protected servitude. The Demon defiantly lives on, Mtsyri dies meekly, but both epitomize the riotous human spirit&#x27;s stand against the world that imprisons it. Both poems are beautifully stylized and written in fine, mellifluous verse which Belinsky found &quot;intoxicating&quot;.
By the late 1830s Lermontov became so disgusted with his own early infatuation with Romanticism as to ridicule it in &quot;Tambov Treasurer&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1838), a close relative to Pushkin&#x27;s &quot;Count Nulin&quot;, performed in stomping &quot;Yevgeny Onegin&quot; rhyme. Even so, it is his 1812 War historical epic &quot;Borodino&quot; (1837), a 25th Anniversary hymn to the victorious Russian spirit, related in simple language a tired war veteran, and &quot;Valerik&quot; (defined by Mirsky as a missing link between the &quot;Copper Rider&quot; and the &quot;War and Peace&quot; battle scenes) that are seen by critics as the two peaks of Lermontov&#x27;s realism. This newly found clarity of vision allowed him to handle a Romantic theme with Pushkin&#x27;s laconic precision most impressively in &quot;The Fugitive&quot;. Tellingly, while Pushkin (whose poem &quot;Tazit&quot;&#x27;s plotline was here used) saw the European influence as a healthy alternative to the patriarchal ways of Caucasian natives, Lermontov tended to idealize the local communities&#x27; centuries-proven customs, their morality codex and the will to fight for freedom and independence to the bitter end.
Lermontov had a peculiar method of circulating ideas, images and even passages, trying them again and again through the years in different settings until each would find itself a proper place – as if he could &quot;see&quot; in his imagination his future works but was &quot;receiving&quot; them in small fragments. Even &quot;In Memory of A.I. Odoyevsky&quot; (1839) the central episode is, in effect, the slightly re-worked passage borrowed from &quot;Sashka&quot;.

&quot;A Hero of Our Time&quot; (1840), a set of five loosely linked stories unfolding the drama of the two conflicting characters, Pechorin and Grushnitsky, who move side by side towards a tragic finale as if driven by destiny itself, proved to be Lermontov&#x27;s magnum opus. Vissarion Belinsky praised it as a masterpiece, but Vladimir Nabokov (who translated the novel into English) was not so sure about the language: &quot;The English reader should be aware that Lermontov&#x27;s prose style in Russian is inelegant, it is dry and drab; it is the tool of an energetic, incredibly gifted, bitterly honest, but definitely inexperienced young man. His Russian is, at times, almost as crude as Stendhal&#x27;s in French; his similes and metaphors are utterly commonplace, his hackneyed epithets are only redeemed by occasionally being incorrectly used. Repetition of words in descriptive sentences irritates the purist,&quot; he wrote. D.S. Mirsky thought differently. &quot;The perfection of Lermontov&#x27;s style and narrative manner can be appreciated only by those who really know Russian, who feel fine imponderable shades of words and know what has been left out as well as what has been put in. Lermontov&#x27;s prose is the best Russian prose ever written, if we judge by the standards of perfection and not by those of wealth. It is transparent, for it is absolutely adequate to the context and neither overlaps it nor is overlapped by it,&quot; he maintained.
In Russia &quot;A Hero of Our Time&quot; seems to have never lost its relevance: the title itself became a token phrase explaining dilemmas haunting this country&#x27;s intelligentsia. And Lermontov&#x27;s reputation as an &#x27;heir to Pushkin&#x27; there is seldom doubted. His foreign biographers, though, tend to see a more complicated and controversial picture. According to Lewis Bagby, &quot;He led such a wild, romantic life, fulfilled so many of the Byronic features (individualism, isolation from high society, social critic and misfit), and lived and died so furiously, that it is difficult not to confuse these manifestations of identity with his authentic self. …Who Lermontov had become, or who he was becoming, is unclear. Lermontov, like many a romantic hero, once closely examined, remains as open and unfinished as his persona seems closed and fixed.&quot;

==Legacy==

The town of Lermontov, Russia (granted municipal status in 1956), the cruise liner MS &quot;Mikhail Lermontov&quot; (launched in 1970) and the minor planet 2222 Lermontov (discovered in 1977) were named after him.

The crew of Soyuz TMA-21 selected &quot;Tarkhany&quot; as their call sign, after the estate where Lermontov spent his childhood and where his remains are preserved.

On 3 October 2014, a monument to Lermontov was unveiled in the Scottish village of Earlston, the place being selected due to a suggested association of Lermontov&#x27;s descent with Thomas the Rhymer. Until only a few years earlier, the connection had been little-known in Scotland.

Lermontov has been depicted in numerous movies and TV series. In 2012 Azerbaijani movie &quot;Ambassador of Morning&quot;, telling the story of another great poet, Abbasgulu Bakikhanov, Mikhail Lermontov was depicted by Oleg Amirbekov. In 2014, in memory of his 200th birthday, a biography documentary about him was released in Russia.

<text>The Baedeker Blitz or Baedeker raids was a series of bombing raids in April and May 1942 by the German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; on English cities during World War II. The name derives from Baedeker, a series of German tourist guide books, including detailed maps, which were used to select targets for bombing.

&quot;Luftwaffe&quot; commanders planned the raids in response to the increasing effectiveness of the Royal Air Force&#x27;s (RAF) area bombing offensive against German targets as a result of the area bombing directive, starting with the bombing of Lübeck in March 1942. The aim was to begin a tit-for-tat exchange with the hope of forcing the RAF to reduce their attacks. To increase the effect on British civilian morale, bombing targets were chosen by the Germans for their cultural and historical significance rather than for any military value.

The majority of the raids took place in late April and May of 1942, but British towns and cities continued to be targeted for their cultural value over the following two years. By any measure, the raids were a failure. In the year following the Blitz of 1940 and 1941, the RAF had dramatically improved its night fighter capability and introduced the AMES Type 7 radar specifically for night-fighting operations. The raids resulted in unsustainable bomber losses for the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, and for a variety of reasons the damage to the targeted cities was minimal compared to the Blitz or to the contemporaneous RAF bombing campaign against Germany. Nevertheless, the raids resulted in over 1,600 civilian deaths and tens of thousands of damaged homes.

==Background==
By the winter of 1941, both the British and German strategic bombing campaigns had reached a low ebb. The German offensive, a nine-month period of night bombing known as the Blitz, which had left London and many other British cities heavily damaged, had come to an end in May 1941 when the had switched its resources to the invasion of the Soviet Union. Thereafter it had confined itself to hit-and-run raids on British coastal towns. Meanwhile, the Royal Air Force&#x27;s (RAF) night bombing offensive had been shown to be largely ineffective, as revealed by the Butt Report in August 1941, and by Christmas 1941 such attacks had largely petered out.

When the RAF offensive resumed in March 1942 with the bombing of Lübeck, there was a marked change in effectiveness. New heavy bombers (the Stirling and Halifax, followed by the unreliable Manchester from which was developed the excellent Lancaster), improved navigation systems (Gee and Oboe), new leadership (with the appointment of Air Vice-Marshal Harris) and new tactics (the bomber stream, use of incendiary bombs, and particularly area bombardment) all contributed.

Prior to this the RAF had attempted to conduct precision bombing, aiming at individual factories, power stations, even post offices, in multiple strikes across the country; this had been costly and ineffective. Following the example of the &#x27;s November 1940 attack on Coventry, the RAF began concentrating a single blow against an area where several worthwhile targets existed, including the homes and morale of the civilian population living there.

==Planning==
The destruction of Lübeck, and of Rostock the following month, shocked both the German leadership and population. Up to this point they had been mostly unaffected by the RAF&#x27;s bombing campaign. Now, Joseph Goebbels reported, &quot;the damage was really enormous&quot; and &quot;it is horrible ... the English air raids have increased in scope and importance; if they can be continued for weeks on these lines, they might conceivably have a demoralising effect on the population.&quot; After the bombing of Rostock he reported &quot;the air raid ... was more devastating than those before. Community life there is practically at an end ... the situation is in some sections catastrophic ... seven-tenths of the city have been destroyed ... more than 100,000 people had to be evacuated ... there was, in fact, panic&quot;.

Adolf Hitler was enraged, and demanded that the retaliate. On 14 April 1942 he ordered &quot;that the air war against England be given a more aggressive stamp. Accordingly when targets are being selected, preference is to be given to those where attacks are likely to have the greatest possible effect on civilian life. Besides raids on ports and industry, terror attacks of a retaliatory nature [] are to be carried out on towns other than London&quot;.

After the raid on Bath, Goebbels reported that Hitler intended to &quot;repeat these raids night after night until the English are sick and tired of terror attacks&quot; and that he &quot;shared [Goebbels&#x27;] opinion absolutely that cultural centres, health resorts and civilian centres must be attacked ... there is no other way of bringing the English to their senses. They belong to a class of human beings with whom you can only talk after you have first knocked out their teeth.&quot;

==Name==

The raids were referred to on both sides as &quot;Baedeker raids&quot;, derived from a comment by a German propagandist. a spokesman for the German Foreign Office, is reported to have said on 24 April 1942, &quot;We shall go out and bomb every building in Britain marked with three stars in the Baedeker Guide&quot;, a reference to the popular travel guides of that name. Goebbels was furious. Keen to brand British attacks as &quot;terror bombing&quot;, he was equally keen to designate German efforts as &quot;retaliatory measures&quot;. Stumm&#x27;s off-the-cuff remark &quot;effectively admitted the Germans were targetting cultural and historic targets, just what the German leadership did not want to do, and Goebbels took steps to make sure it did not happen again&quot;.

The British Ministry of Economic Warfare issued the &quot;Bomber&#x27;s Baedeker&quot; in 1943, a methodical analysis of bombing targets in Germany. A second edition followed in 1944.

==Raids==
The task of carrying out the attacks was given to bomber groups of . These were and , formed from the earlier maritime aviation group, to be led by the pathfinders of I./KG 100. Each raid involved 30 to 40 aircraft, and to increase their effectiveness it was planned each would fly two sorties per night. Each raid involved two periods of 60 to 90 minutes, separated by two or three hours.

The first raid of the Baedeker Blitz was directed against Exeter, the ancient county town of Devon with its immense heritage of historic buildings, on the night of Saint George&#x27;s Day, 23/24 April 1942. While this raid caused little damage, a second raid the following night was more severe, with over 80 fatalities. On the nights of 25/26 and 26/27 April, the bomber force attacked Bath, causing widespread damage and some 400 casualties. These raids came a month after the Lübeck raid and coincided with the RAF&#x27;s four-night offensive against Rostock. On 27/28 April, the attacked Norwich, dropping more than 90 tons of bombs and causing 67 deaths. On 28/29 April, they attacked York, causing limited damage but 79 deaths.

On the night of 3/4 May the returned to Exeter, causing heavy damage to the city centre, considerable damage to the south side of the Cathedral and 164 deaths. The following night they attacked Cowes, a target of both cultural and military value, being the home of the J. Samuel White shipyard. On 8/9 May Norwich was attacked again, though the raid was ineffective despite more than 70 aircraft taking part. During May the also bombed Hull, a major port, and thus a military target, Poole, Grimsby and, at the end of May, Canterbury. This raid, which coincided with the RAF&#x27;s first thousand-bomber raid on Cologne, involved 77 bombers, dropping 40 tons of bombs, which resulted in 43 deaths.

Across all the raids in this period a total of 1,637 civilians were killed and 1,760 injured, and over 50,000 houses were destroyed. Some notable buildings were destroyed or damaged, including York&#x27;s Guildhall and the Bath Assembly Rooms, but on the whole most escaped – the cathedrals of Norwich, and Canterbury and the minster at York included.

Exeter Cathedral was hit in the early hours of 4 May with the complete destruction of St James Chapel on the south side and considerable damage to the South Quire Aisle. The German bombers suffered heavy losses for minimal damage inflicted, and the Axis&#x27;s need for reinforcements in North Africa and on the Eastern Front meant further operations could only continue at a reduced scale. Intermittent hit-and-run raids on coastal towns by Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighter-bombers continued.

On 27 April, Winston Churchill told the War Cabinet that the government should do all it could to &quot;ensure that disproportionate publicity was not given to these raids&quot; and &quot;avoid giving the impression that the Germans were making full reprisal&quot; for British raids.

==Aftermath==
Whilst the term &quot;Baedeker Blitz&quot; is sometimes limited to the raids on those five cities (Exeter, Bath, Canterbury, Norwich and York) in April and May 1942, the continued to target cities for their cultural value for the next two years. In June 1942 they attacked Ipswich, Poole and Canterbury again, Southampton (a port target), Norwich again and Weston-super-Mare. In July there were three raids on Birmingham, another three on Middlesbrough and one on Hull, all industrial cities of military and strategic value. In August the Germans returned to &quot;Baedeker&quot; targets: Norwich, Swansea, Colchester and Ipswich.

In September they attacked Sunderland, a port and industrial centre, and King&#x27;s Lynn, a market town of no military value. All these raids were less intense than those of April and May, involving some 20 aircraft apiece. This reflected the steady and increasing losses suffered by the Germans as Britain&#x27;s night-fighter defences improved and German casualties mounted. By the autumn KG 2 had lost 65 of its 88 crews and the offensive had come to a halt.

To find new ways to continue the pressure, the experimented with both low-level and very high-level attacks. In August 1942 two modified Ju 86P bombers were employed making high-altitude runs over southern England. These operated with impunity for several weeks, and one raid on Bristol on 28 August resulted in 48 fatalities. These flights were halted when the RAF fielded a similarly modified flight of Spitfires and caught one of these bombers in the highest air battle of the war.

On 31 October 1942, thirty German fighter-bombers escorted by sixty fighters made a low-level attack on Canterbury, dropping 28 bombs on the city and causing 30 deaths. Three of the attacking aircraft were shot down.

By the end of 1942, 3,236 people had been killed and 4,148 injured in these raids. However, the strength of the in the west had drained away while the RAF had gone from strength to strength, regularly mounting raids of 200 or more aircraft on Germany.

In 1943, the in the west was revitalised and brought back up to strength. In January KG 2 had 60 bombers (Do217s) and KG 6 the same number (Ju 88s). These were reinforced with a fast bomber wing, SKG 10 of Fw 190 fighter-bombers. These renewed the offensive. On 17/18 January 1943 they raided London, followed by a low-level attack on the city on 20 January. After a lull in February they returned in March leading to the Bethnal Green Tube disaster, where 178 people died.

Throughout the year raids were made on a variety of targets; some of strategic value (Southampton, Plymouth, Portsmouth, Hull, Sunderland, Newcastle) and others with little or none (Eastbourne, Hastings, Maidstone, Cheltenham, Chelmsford, Bournemouth, Lincoln). Again, new tactics were tried. In June 1943 a raid on Grimsby saw the use of delayed-action anti-personnel &quot;butterfly bombs&quot;, which resulted in 163 civilian casualties, most of them from these devices as people returned to their homes after the all clear was sounded.
In November 1943, following the RAF and USAAF bombing of Hamburg and the first use of the &quot;Window&quot; radar countermeasure, the were able to respond with a raid on Norwich, using , their equivalent. While British radar was negated, the raid caused little damage. With the continuing losses of experienced personnel, the German crews were increasingly made up of inexperienced replacements, with a corresponding drop in effectiveness. By the end of 1943 the had mounted some 20 raids, in which more than 10 tonnes of bombs had been dropped, a total of 2,320 tons for the whole year.

These caused 2,372 deaths and 3,450 injuries, according to a report by Lord Cherwell. The report contrasted this with the RAF&#x27;s achievement of a total of 136,000 tons dropped during the year, and pointed out that a single raid on Berlin made in the same week that the report was published had dropped 2,480 tons, more than the entire German effort. The report pointed out that these raids were confined to towns on or near the coast, and that fires caused by bombing only accounted for one-thirtieth of all the incidents dealt with by the National Fire Service.

The Baedeker-type raids ended in 1944, as the Germans realised they were ineffective; unsustainable losses were being suffered for no material gain. January 1944 saw a switch to London as the principal target for retaliation. On 21 January the mounted Operation Steinbock, an all-out attack on London employing all of its available bomber force in the west. This too was largely a failure, with heavy losses for little gain. Henceforth, efforts were re-directed toward the ports that the Germans suspected were going to be used for the allied invasion of France, while the assault on London became the domain of Germany&#x27;s V-weapons.

<text>Causeway Bay is an area and a bay on Hong Kong Island, Hong Kong, straddling the border of the Eastern and the Wan Chai districts. It is a major shopping, leisure and cultural centre in Hong Kong, with a number of major shopping centres. The rents in the shopping areas of Causeway Bay were ranked as the world&#x27;s most expensive for around a decade after overtaking New York City&#x27;s Fifth Avenue in 2012. When referring to the area, the Cantonese name &quot;Tung Lo Wan&quot; is never written in English; &quot;Causeway Bay&quot; is always used.
==Location==

Causeway Bay is located at the eastern end of the Wanchai District and the western end of the Eastern District. Causeway Bay includes Tsing Fung Street, Causeway Bay Market, the Victoria Park, the Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club, Oil Street, Jardine&#x27;s Noonday Gun, the Police Officers Club, the Queen&#x27;s College and the Hong Kong Central Library. Traditionally, Causeway Bay refers to the area near today&#x27;s Tin Hau Station, but Causeway Bay now comprises the area south of Victoria Harbour, with Oil Street as the eastern boundary, Tung Lo Wan Road and Leighton Road as the southern border, and Canal Road Flyover as the western boundary. However, Causeway Bay including the area surrounding Causeway Bay Station, the area traditionally known as East Point.

Since 1982, two electoral constituencies of Causeway Bay (Causeway Bay North and Causeway Bay South) had been grouped into the Eastern District of district board elections, whilst Causeway Bay Central was grouped with the Wan Chai District to the west. However, local government decisions—other than electoral demarcations—still affect the region as a whole. Since 1994, the area has further been subdivided in Hong Kong district board elections into smaller constituencies. The northern sector consists of the area around Victoria Park, the middle sector coincides with the central business district, and the southern sector forms the area around Tin Hau.

To cope with population change, the constituency boundary between Wan Chai District and Eastern District was changed on the new year&#x27;s day of 2016 (effective on voting in 2015 Hong Kong local elections). As a result, the Victoria Park and Tin Hau constituencies became a part of Wan Chai District starting from that day. As a consequence, a larger proportion of Causeway Bay is now part of Wan Chai District; whereas the easternmost parts of the area, such as Oil Street, and the western side of Tin Hau Temple Road, remain in the Eastern District.

Town planning is managed by the Causeway Bay Outline Zoning Plan, which is not related to the electoral boundaries as drawn by the Electoral Affairs Commission. The OZP also covers the other neighbourhoods of Tai Hang and So Kon Po. The OZP, however, does not manage Victoria Park, which was reclaimed from the Causeway Bay/Tung Lo Wan body of water, nor Tin Hau, which is historically part of Tung Lo Wan. Tung Lo Wan is the Cantonese name that collectively refers to the waters and lands around the bay.

Causeway Bay Market and Causeway Bay Fire Station are in fact located in Tin Hau, and are outside the jurisdiction of the OZP, but in terms of the electoral constituency, the market, the fire station, and Victoria Park are located within the Victoria Park constituency. Added to this confusion, Wan Chai Fire Station is located in the Canal Road constituency but some non-government sources consider it as part of the Causeway Bay area. The Wan Chai Fire Station is not part of Causeway Bay OZP.

==History==

The typhoon shelter of Causeway Bay and the Tin Hau Temple reveal that the area was once a fishing town. Before urban development and massive land reclamation, Causeway Bay was a heavily silted bay. Its former shape can be found on maps by tracing Tung Lo Wan Road, which goes along the former bay. In the early stage of development, a causeway was built, which is the present-day Causeway Road. In the 1950s, the coastline was further pushed forward when the remains of the bay were reclaimed for the Victoria Park, when the statue of Queen Victoria was brought back from Japan. The statue had been taken away during the Second World War from Statue Square at Chater Road, Central. Kellett Island off the coast of Causeway Bay has been connected to the Hong Kong Island by a breakwater as a result of the land reclamation.

Causeway Bay&#x27;s history as a shopping district dates back to 1960, when Daimaru, a Japanese style department store opened in Great George Street. By the 1970s, Causeway Bay has developed into Hong Kong&#x27;s main shopping district. A number of other Japanese style department stores, including Matsuzakaya, Mitsukoshi and Sogo, opened in the 1970s and 1980s, giving Causeway Bay the nickname of &quot;little Ginza&quot;. In the 1990s, several major shopping centres were constructed, strengthening Causeway Bay&#x27;s status as one of the major shopping districts in Hong Kong.

The original Causeway Bay proper around the bay is actually the area now known as Tin Hau, near the present-day Tin Hau MTR station and the Causeway Bay Tin Hau Temple, whereas the Causeway Bay MTR station is at the area historically called East Point.

The present-day usage of the name Causeway Bay is usually confused with East Point, an area named after a spit on the coastline, eastern end of formerly Victoria City. The names of Yee Wo Street, Jardine&#x27;s Bazaar, and Jardine&#x27;s Crescent reveal that the land in this area was sold by the British colonial government to Jardines in the early 19th century.

Another area often mistaken as Causeway Bay is Bowrington area or in Cantonese &quot;Ngo Keng&quot; () (now part of Canal Road electoral constituency), literally &quot;goose&#x27;s neck&quot;, where is known for villain hitting activity, a voodoo-like tradition of Hong Kong.

==Features==
Causeway Bay or East Point is one of Hong Kong&#x27;s major shopping districts. It includes the 13-storey Japanese-style department store Sogo, as well as shopping centres such as Times Square and Hysan Place. There are also smaller malls such as World Trade Centre, Windsor House, Hang Lung Centre, Fashion Island (formerly Daimaru), Fashion Walk, Lee Garden One and Lee Garden Two. Causeway Bay is one of the most crowded and central areas in Hong Kong. The area contains many trendy shops carrying both locally made and imported fashion and products from around the world. As such, it is a popular social spot for young people. Many shops are open until after midnight.

Notable hotels in Causeway Bay include Park Lane Hotel and Regal Hong Kong Hotel. Several boutique hotels have opened recently, including Mira Moon Hotel on Jaffe Road.

For years, Jardine Matheson has fired a cannon shot at noon every day in Causeway Bay, by Victoria Harbour, slightly eastward of the former Kellett Island. The gunshots have served as time signals for many generations of old inhabitants of Hong Kong. This tradition still continues today. This is the &quot;Noonday Gun&quot; mentioned in the Noël Coward song &quot;Mad Dogs and Englishmen&quot;.

Although the names of certain landmarks in the western part of Causeway Bay start with &quot;Wan Chai&quot; (e.g. Wan Chai Fire Station), the landmarks are across the local customary limit of Wan Chai on Canal Road.

<text>Cracker Jack is an American brand of snack food that consists of molasses-flavored, caramel-coated popcorn cornballs and peanuts, well known for being packaged with a prize of trivial value inside. The Cracker Jack name and slogan, &quot;The More You Eat, The More You Want&quot; were registered in 1896. Food author Andrew F. Smith has called it the first junk food.

Cracker Jack is famous for its connection to baseball lore. The Cracker Jack brand has been owned and marketed by Frito-Lay since 1997. Frito-Lay announced in 2016 that the toy gift would no longer be provided and had been replaced with a QR code which can be used to download a baseball-themed game.

== Background ==
The origin of sugar-coated popcorn with a mixture of peanuts is unknown, but periodicals document its manufacture and sale in North America as far back as the early 19th century. The Freeport, Illinois &quot;Daily Journal&quot; newspaper published on January 29, 1857, for example, contains an advertisement by a local merchant selling sugar-coated popcorn.

Recipes for popcorn and peanut mixtures were mentioned in North American literature and expressions of speech:

*Page 4 of the Friday, August 23, 1867, edition of the &quot;Evening Star&quot; newspaper published in Washington, D. C., contains the notice: &quot;The Nantucket Inquirer and Mirror&quot; says, &quot;Peanuts and pop-corn were not mixed up with piety when we first knew camp meetings, nor cigar smoking and psalm singing. But the times are changed and we with them.&quot;
*An inquiry was published on page 362 of the December 5, 1885 issue of &quot;Scientific American&quot;, asking how the sugar coating was prepared after the popcorn had popped.
*Page 222 of the 1886 edition of the &quot;Pennsylvania Historical Review, Gazetteer, Post-Office, Express and Telegraph Guide&quot; lists Goodwin Brothers, 105 North Front Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as manufacturers of Sugar Coated Popcorn, Prize Balls, Corn Balls, Corn Cakes, etc.

In Chicago, there are two legends of how Cracker Jack originated: The older attributes it to Charles Frederick Gunther (1837–1920), also known as &quot;The Candy Man&quot; and &quot;Cracker-Jacks King&quot;; the other attributes it to Frederick William Rueckheim, a German immigrant known informally as &quot;Fritz&quot;, who sold popcorn at 113 Fourth Avenue (now known as Federal Street), in Chicago beginning in 1871. The Rueckheim popcorn was made by hand, using steam equipment. In 1873, Fritz bought out his partner William Brinkmeyer and brought his brother Louis from Germany to join in his venture, forming the company F. W. Rueckheim &amp; Bro.

The Rueckheim brothers produced a new recipe, including popcorn, peanuts, and molasses, and first presented it to the public at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition (Chicago&#x27;s first World&#x27;s Fair) in 1893. The molasses of this early version was too sticky.

In 1896, Louis discovered a method to separate the kernels of molasses-coated popcorn during the manufacturing process. As each batch was mixed in a cement-mixer-like drum, a small quantity of oil was added — a closely guarded trade secret. Before this change, the mixture had been difficult to handle, as it stuck together in chunks.

== Naming and packaging ==
In 1896, the first lot of Cracker Jack was produced, the same year the product&#x27;s name and tagline &quot;The More You Eat, the More You Want&quot; were registered. It was named as if someone tasted it and remarked: &quot;That&#x27;s a crackerjack!&quot; (Crackerjack is a colloquialism meaning &quot;of excellent quality&quot;).

In 1899, Henry Gottlieb Eckstein developed the &quot;waxed sealed package&quot; for freshness, which was then known as the &quot;Eckstein Triple Proof Package,&quot; a dust-, germ-, and moisture-proof paper package.

In 1902, the company was reorganized as Rueckheim Bros. &amp; Eckstein. In 1907, the release of the song, &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game,&quot; written by the lyricist Jack Norworth and composer Albert Von Tilzer, gave Cracker Jack free publicity, with its line: &quot;Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack!&quot;

In 1922, the name of the Chicago company was changed to The Cracker Jack Company.

== Mascots ==
Cracker Jack&#x27;s mascots Sailor Jack and his dog Bingo, drawn by Andrew Loomis, were introduced as early as 1916 and registered as a trademark in 1919. Sailor Jack was modeled after Frederick’s grandson Robert Rueckheim. He was the son of Edward, the eldest of the Rueckheim brothers. Robert died of pneumonia shortly after his image appeared at the age of 7. The sailor boy image acquired such meaning for the founder of Cracker Jack that he had it carved on his tombstone at St. Henry Catholic Cemetery in Chicago; the image, an inset in the stone, is missing.

== Ownership ==
The Cracker Jack Company was purchased by Borden in 1964 after a bidding war with Frito-Lay and was manufactured for years in Northbrook, Illinois. Borden sold the brand to Frito-Lay parent PepsiCo in 1997, and Cracker Jack was quickly incorporated into the Frito-Lay portfolio. Frito-Lay transferred production of Cracker Jack from Northbrook to Wyandot Snacks in Marion, Ohio soon after that.

In 2013, Frito-Lay announced that Cracker Jack would undergo a slight reformulation, adding more peanuts and updating the prizes to make them more relevant to the times.

== Cracker Jack&#x27;D ==
On April 30, 2013, Frito-Lay expanded the Cracker Jack product line to include other salty snacks in the spirit of the original Cracker Jack. Called Cracker Jack&#x27;D, it is distinct from the original Cracker Jack by using black packaging instead of the traditional red and white and showing a close-up version of Sailor Jack &amp; Bingo. In addition, unlike the original Cracker Jack, Cracker Jack&#x27;D has not featured prizes in its packages. One of the products available under the Cracker Jack&#x27;D line, the Power Bites, gained some criticism before its official launch due to concern over caffeine being added to more foods, and potential harm to children or pregnant women. 

== Baseball connection ==

Cracker Jack is known for being commonly sold at baseball games and is mentioned in the American standard &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game.&quot;

Each July from 1982 to 1985, Cracker Jack sponsored an Old-Timers Classic game featuring former MLB players, held at RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C.

On June 16, 1993, the 100th anniversary of Cracker Jack was celebrated at Wrigley Field during the game between the Cubs and the expansion Florida Marlins. Before the game, Sailor Jack, the company&#x27;s mascot, threw out the ceremonial first pitch.

In 2004, the New York Yankees baseball team replaced Cracker Jack with the milder, sweet butter toffee-flavored Crunch &#x27;n Munch at home games. After public outcry, the club switched back to Cracker Jack.

== Advertising ==
The Cracker Jack Company began advertising on television in 1955. Cracker Jack sponsored CBS Television&#x27;s &quot;On Your Account&quot;, which was televised on 130 stations nationally.

Actor Jack Gilford appeared in many television commercials for Cracker Jack from 1960 until 1972, and was most recognized as the &quot;rubber-faced guy on the Cracker Jack commercials&quot; for 12 years.

Puppeteer Shari Lewis and her puppet Lamb Chop appeared in Cracker Jack commercials in 1961.

A new television ad for Cracker Jack ran during Super Bowl XXXIII on January 31, 1999. It was the first television advertising for the Cracker Jack brand in 15 years. It introduced the company&#x27;s new bag packaging, the first time Cracker Jack was made available in something other than the classic Cracker Jack box.

== Toys and prizes ==
Cracker Jack originally included a small &quot;mystery&quot; novelty item referred to as a &quot;Toy Surprise&quot; in each box. The tagline for Cracker Jack was originally &quot;Candy-coated popcorn, peanuts and a prize&quot; but has since become &quot;Caramel-coated popcorn &amp; peanuts&quot; under Frito-Lay.

Prizes were included in every box of Cracker Jack beginning in 1912. One of the first prizes was in 1914 when the company produced the first of two Cracker Jack baseball card issues, which featured players from both major leagues as well as players from the short-lived Federal League. Early &quot;toy surprises&quot; included rings, plastic figurines, booklets, stickers, temporary tattoos, and decoder rings. Books have been written cataloging the prizes, and a substantial collector&#x27;s market exists.

Until 1937, Cracker Jack toy prizes were made in Japan. They were designed by Carey Cloud from 1938. Many metal toys were also made by TootsieToy, who also made Monopoly game markers. During World War II, the prizes were made of paper.

In the 1961 movie &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;, the lead couple goes to Tiffany &amp; Co. where they have a ring from a box of Cracker Jack engraved.

The prizes attained pop-culture status with the phrase &quot;came in a Cracker Jack box&quot; or metaphorical comparisons to a &quot;Cracker Jack prize,&quot; particularly when applied sarcastically to engagement and wedding rings of dubious investment value. The Jim Steinman song &quot;Two Out of Three Ain&#x27;t Bad&quot; (best known as a 1978 recording by Meat Loaf) includes the lyric &quot;there ain&#x27;t no Coupe de Ville hiding at the bottom of a Cracker Jack box.&quot;

Under Frito-Lay, toy and trinket prizes were replaced with paper prizes displaying riddles and jokes, then temporary tattoos. In 2013, some prizes became codes for people to play &quot;nostalgic&quot; games on the Cracker Jack app through Google Play for Android-powered devices. The announcement was made in 2016 that these gameplays would replace tangible prizes.

<text>A stadium (: stadiums or stadia) is a place or venue for (mostly) outdoor sports, concerts, or other events and consists of a field or stage completely or partially surrounded by a tiered structure designed to allow spectators to stand or sit and view the event.

Pausanias noted that for about half a century the only event at the ancient Greek Olympic festival was the race that comprised one length of the stadion at Olympia, where the word &quot;stadium&quot; originated.

Most of the stadiums with a capacity of at least 10,000 are used for association football. Other popular stadium sports include gridiron football, baseball, cricket, the various codes of rugby, field lacrosse, bandy, and bullfighting. Many large sports venues are also used for concerts.

==Etymology==

&quot;Stadium&quot; is the Latin form of the Greek word &quot;stadion&quot; (&quot;στάδιον&quot;), a measure of length equalling the length of 600 human feet. As feet are of variable length the exact length of a stadion depends on the exact length adopted for 1 foot at a given place and time. Although in modern terms 1 stadion = , in a given historical context it may actually signify a length up to 15% larger or smaller.

The equivalent Roman measure, the &quot;stadium&quot;, had a similar length – about – but instead of being defined in feet was defined using the Roman standard passus to be a distance of 125 &quot;passūs&quot; (double-paces).

The English use of &quot;stadium&quot; comes from the tiered infrastructure surrounding a Roman track of such length.

Most dictionaries provide for both &quot;stadiums&quot; and &quot;stadia&quot; as valid English plurals.

==History==

The oldest known stadium is the Stadium at Olympia in Greece, where the ancient Olympic Games were held from 776 BC. Initially the Games consisted of a single event, a sprint along the length of the stadium.

Greek and Roman stadiums have been found in numerous ancient cities, perhaps the most famous being the Stadium of Domitian, in Rome.

The excavated and refurbished ancient Panathenaic Stadium hosted attempted revivals of the Olympic Games in 1870 and 1875 before hosting the first modern Olympics in 1896, the 1906 Intercalated Games, and some events of the 2004 Summer Olympics. The excavation and refurbishment of the stadium was part of the legacy of the Greek national benefactor Evangelos Zappas, and it was the first ancient stadium to be used in modern times.

===Antiquity===

Stadiums in ancient Greece and Rome were built for different purposes, and at first only the Greeks built structures called &quot;stadium&quot;; Romans built structures called &quot;circus&quot;. Greek stadia were for foot races, whereas the Roman circus was for horse races. Both had similar shapes and bowl-like areas around them for spectators. The Greeks also developed the theatre, with its seating arrangements foreshadowing those of modern stadiums. The Romans copied the theatre, then expanded it to accommodate larger crowds and more elaborate settings. The Romans also developed the double-sized round theatre called amphitheatre, seating crowds in the tens of thousands for gladiatorial combats and beast shows. The Greek stadium and theatre and the Roman circus and amphitheatre are all ancestral to the modern stadium.

====Examples====

===Modernity===


The first stadiums to be built in the modern era were basic facilities, designed for the single purpose of fitting as many spectators in as possible. With tremendous growth in the popularity of organised sport in the late Victorian era, especially association football in the United Kingdom and baseball in the United States, the first such structures were built. One such early stadium was the Lansdowne Road Stadium, the brainchild of Henry Dunlop, who organised the first All Ireland Athletics Championships. Banned from locating sporting events at Trinity College, Dunlop built the stadium in 1872. &quot;I laid down a cinder running path of a quarter-mile, laid down the present Lansdowne Tennis Club ground with my own theodolite, started a Lansdowne archery club, a Lansdowne cricket club, and last, but not least, the Lansdowne Rugby Football Club – colours red, black and yellow.&quot; Some 300 cartloads of soil from a trench beneath the railway were used to raise the ground, allowing Dunlop to use his engineering expertise to create a pitch envied around Ireland.

Other early stadiums from this period in the UK include the Stamford Bridge stadium (opened in 1877 for the London Athletic Club) and Anfield stadium (1884 as a venue for Everton F.C.).

In the U.S., many professional baseball teams built large stadiums mainly out of wood, with the first such venue being the South End Grounds in Boston, opened in 1871 for the team then known as the Boston Beaneaters (now the Atlanta Braves). Many of these parks caught fire, and those that did not proved inadequate for a growing game. All of the 19th-century wooden parks were replaced, some after a few years, and none survive today.

Goodison Park was the first purpose-built association football stadium in the world. Walton-based building firm Kelly brothers were instructed to erect two uncovered stands that could each accommodate 4,000 spectators. A third covered stand accommodating 3,000 spectators was also requested. Everton officials were impressed with the builder&#x27;s workmanship and agreed two further contracts: exterior hoardings were constructed at a cost of £150 and 12 turnstiles were installed at a cost of £7 each. The stadium was officially opened on 24 August 1892 by Lord Kinnaird and Frederick Wall of the Football Association. No football was played; instead the 12,000 crowd watched a short track and field event followed by music and a fireworks display. Upon its completion the stadium was the first joint purpose-built football stadium in the world.

The architect Archibald Leitch brought his experience with the construction of industrial buildings to bear on the design of functional stadiums up and down the country. His work encompassed the first 40 years of the 20th century. One of his most notable designs was Old Trafford in Manchester. The ground was originally designed with a capacity of 100,000 spectators and featured seating in the south stand under cover, while the remaining three stands were left as terraces and uncovered. It was the first stadium to feature continuous seating along the contours of the stadium.

These early venues, originally designed to host football matches, were adopted for use by the Olympic Games, the first one being held in 1896 in Athens, Greece. The White City Stadium, built for the 1908 Summer Olympics in London is often cited as the first modern seater stadium, at least in the UK. Designed by the engineer J.J. Webster and completed in 10 months by George Wimpey, on the site of the Franco-British Exhibition, this stadium with a seating capacity of 68,000 was opened by King Edward VII on 27 April 1908. Upon completion, the stadium had a running track and three laps to the mile (536 m); outside there was a , cycle track. The infield included a swimming and diving pool. The London Highbury Stadium, built in 1913, was the first stadium in the UK to feature a two-tiered seating arrangement when it was redesigned in the Art Deco style in 1936.

During these decades, parallel stadium developments were taking place in the U.S. The Baker Bowl, a baseball park in Philadelphia that opened in its original form in 1887 but was completely rebuilt in 1895, broke new ground in stadium construction in two major ways. The stadium&#x27;s second incarnation featured the world&#x27;s first cantilevered second deck (tier) in a sports venue, and was the first baseball park to use steel and brick for the majority of its construction. Another influential venue was Boston&#x27;s Harvard Stadium, built in 1903 by Harvard University for its American football team and track and field program. It was the world&#x27;s first stadium to use concrete-and-steel construction. In 1909, concrete-and-steel construction came to baseball with the opening of Shibe Park in Philadelphia and, a few months later, Forbes Field in Pittsburgh. The latter was the world&#x27;s first three-tiered sporting venue. The opening of these parks marked the start of the &quot;jewel box&quot; era of park construction. The largest stadium crowd ever was 199,854 people watching the final match of the 1950 World Cup at Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s Maracanã on 16 July 1950.




==Types==
Domed stadiums are distinguished from conventional stadiums by their enclosing roofs. Many of these are not actually domes in the pure architectural sense, some being better described as vaults, some having truss-supported roofs and others having more exotic designs such as a tensegrity structure. But, in the context of sports stadiums, the term &quot;dome&quot; has become standard for all covered stadiums, particularly because the first such enclosed stadium, the Houston Astrodome, was built with an actual dome-shaped roof. Some stadiums have partial roofs, and a few have even been designed to have moveable fields as part of the infrastructure. The Caesars Superdome in New Orleans is a true dome structure made of a lamellar multi-ringed frame and has a diameter of 680 feet (210 m). It is the largest fixed domed structure in the world.

Even though enclosed, dome stadiums are called &quot;stadiums&quot; because they are large enough for, and designed for, what are generally considered to be outdoor sports such as athletics, American football, association football, rugby, and baseball. Those designed for what are usually indoor sports like basketball, ice hockey and volleyball are generally called &quot;arenas&quot;. Exceptions include:

* Cameron Indoor Stadium, home to Duke University&#x27;s Blue Devils men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball programs.
* Red Bull Arena, an open-air venue that is home to Major League Soccer&#x27;s New York Red Bulls and NJ/NY Gotham FC of the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League.
* Paris La Défense Arena, a domed stadium that is home to the rugby union club Racing 92. It has a movable seating block that allows a configuration appropriate for indoor court sports.
* Chicago Stadium (demolished), former home to the National Hockey League&#x27;s Chicago Blackhawks and the National Basketball Association&#x27;s Chicago Bulls.

==Design issues==

Different sports require different playing surfaces of various size and shape. Some stadiums are designed primarily for a single sport while others can accommodate different events, particularly ones with retractable seating. Stadiums built specifically for association football are common in Europe; Gaelic games stadiums, such as Croke Park, are common in Ireland, while stadiums built specifically for baseball or American football are common in the United States. The most common multiple use design combines a football pitch with a running track, although certain compromises must be made. The major drawback is that the stands are necessarily set back a good distance from the pitch, especially at the ends of the pitch. In the case of some smaller stadiums, there are not stands at the ends. When there are stands all the way around, the stadium takes on an oval shape. When one end is open, the stadium has a horseshoe shape. All three configurations (open, oval and horseshoe) are common, especially in the case of American college football stadiums. Rectangular stadiums are more common in Europe, especially for football where many stadiums have four often distinct and very different stands on the four sides of the stadium. These are often all of different sizes and designs and have been erected at different periods in the stadium&#x27;s history. The vastly differing character of European football stadiums has led to the growing hobby of ground hopping where spectators make a journey to visit the stadium for itself rather than for the event held there. In recent years the trend of building completely new oval stadiums in Europe has led to traditionalists criticising the designs as bland and lacking in the character of the old stadiums they replace.

In North America, where baseball and American football are the two most popular outdoor spectator sports, a number of football/baseball multi-use stadiums were built, especially during the 1960s, and some of them were successful.

Since the requirements for baseball and football are significantly different, the trend has been toward the construction of single-purpose stadiums, beginning with Kansas City in 1972–1973 and accelerating in the 1990s. In several cases, an American football stadium has been constructed adjacent to a baseball park, to allow for the sharing of mutual parking lots and other amenities. With the rise of MLS, the construction of soccer-specific stadiums has also increased since the late 1990s to better fit the needs of that sport. In many cases, earlier baseball stadiums were constructed to fit into a particular land area or city block. This resulted in asymmetrical dimensions for many baseball fields. Yankee Stadium, for example, was built on a triangular city block in The Bronx, New York City. This resulted in a large left field dimension but a small right field dimension.

Before more modern football stadiums were built in the United States, many baseball parks, including Fenway Park, the Polo Grounds, Wrigley Field, Comiskey Park, Tiger Stadium, Griffith Stadium, Milwaukee County Stadium, Shibe Park, Forbes Field, Yankee Stadium, and Sportsman&#x27;s Park were used by the National Football League or the American Football League. (To a certain extent, this continues in lower football leagues as well, with the venue now known as Charles Schwab Field Omaha being used as the home stadium of the United Football League&#x27;s Omaha Nighthawks.) Along with today&#x27;s single use stadiums is the trend for retro-style ballparks closer to downtown areas. Oriole Park at Camden Yards was the first such ballpark for Major League Baseball to be built, using early-20th-century styling with 21st-century amenities.

There is a solar-powered stadium in Taiwan that produces as much energy as it needs to function.

Stadium designers often study acoustics to increase noise caused by fans&#x27; voices, aiming to create a lively atmosphere.

=== Lighting ===

Until the advent of floodlights, most games played on large areas had to rely on natural lighting.

Bramall Lane was reportedly the first floodlit stadium. Floodlighting in association football dates as far back as 1878, when there were floodlit experimental matches at Bramall Lane, Sheffield during the dark winter afternoons. With no national grid, lights were powered by batteries and dynamoes, and were unreliable.

Since the development of electrical grids, lighting has been an important element in stadium design, allowing games to be played after sundown, and in covered, or partly covered stadiums that allow less natural light, but provide more shelter for the public.

==Spectator areas and seating==

An &quot;all-seater&quot; stadium has seats for all spectators. Other stadiums are designed so that all or some spectators stand to view the event. The term &quot;all-seater&quot; is not common in the U.S., as very few American stadiums have sizeable standing-only sections. Poor stadium design has contributed to disasters, such as the Hillsborough disaster and the Heysel Stadium disaster. Since these, all Premier League, UEFA European Championship and FIFA World Cup qualifying matches require all spectators to be seated.

Seating areas may be known as &quot;terraces&quot;, &quot;tiers&quot;, or &quot;decks&quot;. Originally set out for standing room only, they are now usually equipped with seating. Another term used in the US is &quot;bleachers&quot;, which is mostly used for seating areas with bench seats as opposed to individual seats, and which often are uncovered; the name refers to the bleaching effect direct, unshaded sunlight has on the benches and patrons in those sections.

Many stadiums make luxury suites or boxes available to patrons at high prices. These suites can accommodate ten to thirty people, depending on the venue. Luxury suites at events such as the Super Bowl can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.

=== Safety and security ===

Due to the number of people congregating in stadiums and the frequency of events, many notable accidents have occurred in the past, some causing injury and death. For example, the Hillsborough disaster was a human crush at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield, England on 15 April 1989. The resulting 97 deaths and 765 injuries makes this the worst disaster in British sporting history.

Much effort has been spent to avoid the recurrence of such events, both in design and legislation. Especially where there is a perceived risk of terrorism or violence attention remains high to prevent human death and keep stadiums as places where families can enjoy a public event together.

In Europe and South America, during the twentieth century, it was common for violent bands of supporters to fight inside or close to association football stadiums. In the United Kingdom they are known as hooligans.

Structural features that increase safety include separate entry and exit accesses for each spectator area, especially separating accesses for home and visitor supporters, dividing walls, glass parapets, vibration attenuation and sprinkler systems.

Security features that have been adopted include armed surveillance, Identity document checks, video surveillance, metal detectors and security searches to enforce rules that forbid spectators to carry dangerous or potentially dangerous items.

==Political and economic issues==

Modern stadiums, especially the largest among them, are megaprojects that can only be afforded by the largest corporations, wealthiest individuals, or government. Sports fans have a deep emotional attachment to their teams. In North America, with its closed-league &quot;franchise&quot; system, there are fewer teams than cities which would like them. This creates tremendous bargaining power for the owners of teams, whereby owners can threaten to relocate teams to other cities unless governments subsidize the construction of new facilities. In Europe and Latin America, where there are multiple association football clubs in any given city, and several leagues in each country, no such monopoly power exists, and stadiums are built primarily with private money. Outside professional sports, governments are also involved through the intense competition for the right to host major sporting events, primarily the Summer Olympics and the FIFA World Cup (of association football), during which cities often pledge to build new stadiums in order to satisfy the International Olympic Committee (IOC) or FIFA.

===Corporate naming===



In recent decades, to help take the burden of the massive expense of building and maintaining a stadium, many American and European sports teams have sold the rights to the name of the facility. This trend, which began in the 1970s, but accelerated greatly in the 1990s, has led to sponsors&#x27; names being affixed to both established stadiums and new ones. In some cases, the corporate name replaces (with varying degrees of success) the name by which the venue has been known for many years. But many of the more recently built stadiums, like the Volkswagen Arena in Wolfsburg, Germany, have never been known by a non-corporate name. The sponsorship phenomenon has since spread worldwide. There remain a few municipally owned stadiums, which are often known by a name that is significant to their area (for example, Boston&#x27;s Fenway Park). In recent years, some government-owned stadiums have also been subject to naming-rights agreements, with some or all of the revenue often going to the team(s) that play there.

One consequence of corporate naming has been an increase in stadium name changes, when the namesake corporation changes its name, or if it is the naming agreement simply expires. Phoenix&#x27;s Chase Field, for example, was previously known as Bank One Ballpark, but was renamed to reflect the takeover of the latter corporation. San Francisco&#x27;s historic Candlestick Park was renamed as 3Com Park for several years, but the name was dropped when the sponsorship agreement expired, and it was another two years before the new name of Monster Cable Products&#x27; Monster Park was applied. Local opposition to the corporate naming of that particular stadium led San Francisco&#x27;s city council to permanently restore the Candlestick Park name once the Monster contract expired. More recently, in Ireland, there has been huge opposition to the renaming of Dublin&#x27;s historic Lansdowne Road as the Aviva Stadium. Lansdowne was redeveloped as the Aviva, opening in May 2010.

On the other hand, Los Angeles&#x27; Great Western Forum, one of the earliest examples of corporate renaming, retained its name for many years, even after the namesake bank no longer existed, the corporate name being dropped only after the building later changed ownership. This practice has typically been less common in countries outside the United States. A notable exception is the Nippon Professional Baseball league of Japan, in which many of the teams are themselves named after their parent corporations. Also, many newer European football stadiums, such as the University of Bolton and Emirates Stadiums in England and Signal Iduna Park and Allianz Arena in Germany have been corporately named.

This new trend in corporate naming (or renaming) is distinguishable from names of some older venues, such as Crosley Field, Wrigley Field, and the first and second Busch Stadiums, in that the parks were named by and for the club&#x27;s owner, which also happened to be the name of the company owned by those clubowners. (The current Busch Stadium received its name via a modern naming rights agreement.)

During the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, some stadiums were temporarily renamed because FIFA prohibits sponsorship of stadiums. For example, the Allianz Arena in Munich was called the &quot;FIFA World Cup Stadium, Munich&quot; during the tournament. Likewise, the same stadium will be known as the &quot;München Arena&quot; during the European Competitions. Similar rules affect the Imtech Arena and Veltins-Arena. This rule applies even if the stadium sponsor is an official FIFA sponsor—the Johannesburg stadium then commercially known as &quot;Coca-Cola Park&quot;, bearing the name of one of FIFA&#x27;s major sponsors, was known by its historic name of Ellis Park Stadium during the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Corporate names are also temporarily replaced during the Olympics.

==Environmental issues==
Modern stadiums bring several negative environmental issues with their construction. They require thousands of tons of materials to build, they greatly increase traffic in the area around the stadium, as well as maintaining the stadium. The increased traffic around modern stadiums has led to create exposure zones says the Health Effect Institute, exposing 30–40% of people living around the stadium to potential health issues. Many stadiums are attempting to counteract these issues by implementing solar panels, and high efficiency lighting, to reduce their own carbon footprint.

==Music venues==

Although concerts, such as classical music, had been presented in them for decades, beginning in the 1960s stadiums began to be used as live venues for popular music, giving rise to the term &quot;stadium rock&quot;, particularly for forms of hard rock and progressive rock. The origins of stadium rock are sometimes dated to when the Beatles played Shea Stadium in New York in 1965. Also important was the use of large stadiums for American tours by bands in the later 1960s, such as the Rolling Stones, Grand Funk Railroad and Led Zeppelin. The tendency developed in the mid-1970s as the increased power of amplification and sound systems allowed the use of larger and larger venues. Smoke, fireworks and sophisticated lighting shows became staples of arena rock performances. Key acts from this era included Journey, REO Speedwagon, Boston, Foreigner, Styx, Kiss, Peter Frampton and Queen. In the 1980s arena rock became dominated by glam metal bands, following the lead of Aerosmith and including Mötley Crüe, Quiet Riot, W.A.S.P. and Ratt. Since the 1980s, rock, pop and folk stars, including the Grateful Dead, Madonna, Michael Jackson, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift, have undertaken large-scale stadium based concert tours.

<text>The Sambyeolcho Rebellion (1270–1273) was a Korean rebellion against the Goryeo dynasty that happened near the end of the Mongol invasions of Korea. It was suppressed by Goryeo and the Yuan dynasty. After the rebellion, Goryeo became a vassal state of the Yuan dynasty.

==Background==
From 1231, Goryeo was intermittently invaded by the Mongol Empire. During this time, Goryeo was controlled by a military regime led by the Ch&#x27;oe family. In 1232 the government under the nominal king fled to Ganghwa Island, which Mongol horse riders were unable to land on, and resisted the Mongol invasion. Unfortunately because of its fragile foundation, Goryeo faced frequent rebellions. The 1258 rebellion resulted in the establishment of Ssangseong and Dongnyeong Prefectures by the Mongols.

Unlike these rebels, the Sambyeolcho (Three Elite Patrols) were an organ of the military government. They were organized by the Ch&#x27;oe family to maintain security. However, unlike the Ch&#x27;oe private guards unit (which was to personally protect the family), the Sambyeolcho assumed public functions performed by police and combat forces, effectively replacing the Six Divisions of the military.

In 1258, Ch&#x27;oe Ŭi, the fourth dictator of the Ch&#x27;oe family, was overthrown by Kim Chun (also known as Kim In-jun) using the Sambyeolcho. Kim Chun took a pro-Mongol policy and sent Crown Prince Wang Chŏng to the Mongol Empire. At the same time, King Gojong and the crown prince approached the Mongols to restore power from Kim Chun. 

In 1268, however, Kim Chun was annihilated by the Sambyeolcho under the order of Im Yŏn. The next year, Im Yŏn&#x27;s attempt to replace King Wonjong was reversed by the crown prince (Chungnyeol) with the help from the Mongol force. In 1270, Im Yŏn&#x27;s successor Im Yu-mu was killed by the pro-Mongol faction using the Sambyeolcho. It marked the end of the military regime.

==Anti-Mongol struggle==
By the order of the Mongol court, Wonjong moved the capital from Ganghwa Island to Kaesŏng. Regaining power from military officials with the support of the Mongols, the king decided to abolish the Sambyeolcho. Resentful of the peace terms worked out with the Mongols, the Sambyeolcho, led by Pae Chung-son, revolted against the government. Systematically blocking passage between Gangwha and the mainland, they brought nearby islands and coastal regions under their domain. Wang On, a royal kinsman was proclaimed king of the maritime kingdom. They gave up Ganghwa Island and fled to Jindo Island in the southwest.

Although the Sambyeolcho raided the coastlines of Jeolla Province, the southwestern province, Jindo Island started to face food shortages in January 1271. In February the court of Kublai Khan&#x27;s Yuan dynasty called for the Sambyeolcho&#x27;s surrender. In response, its leader, Pae Chung-son, asked Kublai Khan to secure Jeolla Province and put it under the direct rule of the empire, just as preceding rebels had. But his request was never fulfilled.

In April, the Yuan court decided to crush the rebels. It only took a month for Jindo Island to fall to a combined Goryeo and Yuan army. The puppet king was killed and the survivors, led by Kim T&#x27;ong-jŏng, fled to Jeju Island. The rebels captured the island and banished the king of Tamna in November 1270.

The Sambyeolcho laid low until the end of 1271. During that time, they sought help from Japanese Kamakura Shogunate. They regained their strength to some degree the following year. They repeatedly looted the Korean coast. A combined Goryeo-Yuan assault began in February 1272, and crushed the rebels in April. Thereafter, the Yuan dynasty directly controlled Tamna until 1294.
