<text>In the field of political science, civics is the study of the civil and political rights and obligations of citizens in a society. The term &quot;civics&quot; derives from the Latin word &quot;civicus&quot;, meaning &quot;relating to a citizen&quot;. In U.S. politics, in the context of urban planning, the term &quot;civics&quot; comprehends the city politics that affect the political decisions of the citizenry of a city.

Civic education is the study of the theoretical, political, and practical aspects of citizenship manifest as political rights, civil rights, and legal obligations. Civic education includes the study of civil law, the civil codes, and government with especial attention to the political role of the citizens in the operation and oversight of government.

Moreover, in the history of Ancient Rome, the term &quot;civics&quot; also refers to the Civic Crown, to the &quot;Corona civica&quot;, which was a garland of oak leaves awarded to Romans who saved the lives of fellow citizens.

== Philosophical views ==
=== Ancient Sparta ===
==== Archidamus ====
In the &quot;History of the Peloponnesian War&quot;, Thucydides quotes a speech by Archidamus II wherein he stressed the importance for Sparta of civic education for the Spartan virtues of toughness, obedience, cunning, simplicity, and preparedness:
French essayist Michel de Montaigne commended how Agesilaus II, the son of Archidamus, followed his father&#x27;s approach closely:

==== Simonides ====
Plutarch relates a comparison made by Simonides between Spartan education of citizens and horse husbandry:

==== Lycurgus ====
According to the Roman historian Plutarch, the semi-legendary Lycurgus of Sparta considered education of the citizenry to be his main priority as framer of the Spartan constitution. Plutarch observes that &#x27;the whole course of [Spartan] education was one of continued exercise of a ready and perfect obedience&#x27; in which &#x27;there scarcely was any time or place without someone present to put them in mind of their duty, and punish them if they had neglected it.&#x27;

He also describes how the Spartans limited civic education so as to maintain social control over the young:

However, the youth were also required to express themselves forcefully and succinctly, as well to think and reflect on matters of civic virtue, including such questions as who is or is not a good citizen of Sparta. Montaigne would later praise this particular technique of education, admiring the way Spartan citizens spent their time learning to acquire virtues such as courage and temperance, to the exclusion of studying any other subject. Spartan boys were also taught music and songs in praise of courage and in condemnation of cowardice.

Essentially, the Spartan ideal of civic education was a process whereby the interest of the citizen becomes totally united with the interest of the polity, in a spirit of perfect patriotism: &#x27;To conclude, Lycurgus bred up his citizens in such a way that they neither would nor could live by themselves; they were to make themselves one with the public good, and, clustering like bees around their commander, be by their zeal and public spirit carried all but out of themselves, and devoted wholly to their country.

Civic education for toughness and martial prowess was not only within the purview of Spartan men: Plutarch recounts how Lycurgus &#x27;ordered the maidens to exercises themselves with wrestling, running, throwing the quoit, and chasing the dart&#x27; with a view to creating healthy children for the state.

=== Ancient Athens ===
==== Pericles ====
Pericles&#x27; Funeral Oration provides insight into Athens&#x27; sharply contrasting form of civic education from Sparta, for personal freedom, rather than blind obedience, where he boasts that Athens is &#x27;the school of Hellas&#x27;, since: However, English philosopher Thomas Hobbes believed that the Athenians were only taught to think they had personal freedom in order to discourage them from seeking reform.

==== Crito ====
In the Socratic dialogue &quot;Crito&quot;, Crito of Alopece learns from Socrates the importance in civic education of following expert opinion, rather than majority opinion. Socrates uses the analogy of the training gymnast, who he implies ought to follow his gymnastics trainer, not whatever the majority of people think about gymnastics. Crito also hears Socrates&#x27; argument that a citizen ought to obey his city&#x27;s laws partly because it was his city which educated him for citizenship.

==== Aeschyslus ====
In the Aristophanes comedy &quot;The Frogs&quot;, the character of the playwright Aeschylus scolds fellow tragedian Euripides for writing scenes pernicious to proper ideals of citizenship:

During his diatribe, he emphasises the importance of poetry to civic education: 

Similarly, Plutarch would later speak of the power of the poet Thales to, in the words of the English poet John Milton, &#x27;prepare and mollify the Spartan surliness with his smooth songs and odes, the better to plant among them law and civility&#x27;. Plutarch also spoke of the deep influence of Homer&#x27;s &#x27;lessons of state&#x27; on Lycurgus, framer of the Spartan constitution.

==== Adrastus ====
In the Euripides tragedy &quot;The Suppliants&quot;, King Adrastus of Argos describes how Hippomedon received his civic education for endurance, martial skill, and service to the state:

Adrastus also describes how Parthenopeus received his education for citizenship in his adopted city:

=== Ancient Rome ===
==== Aurelius ====
In his &quot;Meditations&quot;, Marcus Aurelius tells of how he was educated as a citizen to value free speech, to refrain from rhetoric and giving hortatory lectures, and to perceive the defects of tyranny. From his brother he imbibed a specific ideal for the Roman state: He also followed the example of his adopted father Antoninus Pius, who he said kept careful watch of government administration and finances, was open to hearing ideas about how to serve the common good, and cared neither for ambition nor pandering to the popular will: Aurelius was also taught by his father how to live as a public figure restrained by modesty:

=== Early Modern England ===
==== Hobbes ====
In his treatise &quot;Leviathan&quot;, English philosopher Thomas Hobbes heavily criticised the emphasis in contemporary civic education on studying Athenian democracy and Roman republicanism, saying that it wrongly encouraged monarchical subjects to restrain the actions of their monarchs. He thought that those citizens who imbibed the value of democracy from classic works were likely to oppose monarchy in the manner rabid dogs avoid water. Hobbes was deeply uncomfortable with Aristotelian civic education, which he said advised popular governance instead of monarchical rule.

==== Bacon ====
English philosopher Francis Bacon was aware of the relevance of civic education to what he termed &#x27;civil merit&#x27;. However, in his essay &quot;The Advancement of Learning&quot;, Bacon also argues that civic education should be preceded by religious and moral education, so that those who judge policy will not be under the influence of moral relativism.

== Additional thoughts on civic education ==
Sudbury schools contend that values, social justice and democracy must be learned through experience as Aristotle said: &quot;For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them.&quot; They adduce that for this purpose schools must encourage ethical behavior and personal responsibility. In order to achieve these goals schools must allow students the three great freedoms—freedom of choice, freedom of action and freedom to bear the results of action—that constitute personal responsibility. The &quot;strongest, political rationale&quot; for democratic schools is that they teach &quot;the virtues of democratic deliberation for the sake of future citizenship.&quot; This type of education is often alluded to in the deliberative democracy literature as fulfilling the necessary and fundamental social and institutional changes necessary to develop a democracy that involves intensive participation in group decision making, negotiation, and social life of consequence.

<text>In mathematics, general topology (or point set topology) is the branch of topology that deals with the basic set-theoretic definitions and constructions used in topology. It is the foundation of most other branches of topology, including differential topology, geometric topology, and algebraic topology.

The fundamental concepts in point-set topology are &quot;continuity&quot;, &quot;compactness&quot;, and &quot;connectedness&quot;: 
* Continuous functions, intuitively, take nearby points to nearby points. 
* Compact sets are those that can be covered by finitely many sets of arbitrarily small size.
* Connected sets are sets that cannot be divided into two pieces that are far apart. 
The terms &#x27;nearby&#x27;, &#x27;arbitrarily small&#x27;, and &#x27;far apart&#x27; can all be made precise by using the concept of open sets. If we change the definition of &#x27;open set&#x27;, we change what continuous functions, compact sets, and connected sets are. Each choice of definition for &#x27;open set&#x27; is called a &quot;topology&quot;. A set with a topology is called a &quot;topological space&quot;.

&quot;Metric spaces&quot; are an important class of topological spaces where a real, non-negative distance, also called a &quot;metric&quot;, can be defined on pairs of points in the set. Having a metric simplifies many proofs, and many of the most common topological spaces are metric spaces.

== History ==
General topology grew out of a number of areas, most importantly the following:

*the detailed study of subsets of the real line (once known as the &quot;topology of point sets&quot;; this usage is now obsolete)
*the introduction of the manifold concept
*the study of metric spaces, especially normed linear spaces, in the early days of functional analysis.

General topology assumed its present form around 1940. It captures, one might say, almost everything in the intuition of continuity, in a technically adequate form that can be applied in any area of mathematics.

==A topology on a set==

Let &quot;X&quot; be a set and let &quot;τ&quot; be a family of subsets of &quot;X&quot;. Then &quot;τ&quot; is called a &quot;topology on X&quot; if:

# Both the empty set and &quot;X&quot; are elements of &quot;τ&quot;
# Any union of elements of &quot;τ&quot; is an element of &quot;τ&quot;
# Any intersection of finitely many elements of &quot;τ&quot; is an element of &quot;τ&quot;

If &quot;τ&quot; is a topology on &quot;X&quot;, then the pair (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;τ&quot;) is called a &quot;topological space&quot;. The notation &quot;Xτ&quot; may be used to denote a set &quot;X&quot; endowed with the particular topology &quot;τ&quot;.

The members of &quot;τ&quot; are called &quot;open sets&quot; in &quot;X&quot;. A subset of &quot;X&quot; is said to be closed if its complement is in &quot;τ&quot; (i.e., its complement is open). A subset of &quot;X&quot; may be open, closed, both (clopen set), or neither. The empty set and &quot;X&quot; itself are always both closed and open.

===Basis for a topology===

A base (or basis) &quot;B&quot; for a topological space &quot;X&quot; with topology &quot;T&quot; is a collection of open sets in &quot;T&quot; such that every open set in &quot;T&quot; can be written as a union of elements of &quot;B&quot;. We say that the base &quot;generates&quot; the topology &quot;T&quot;. Bases are useful because many properties of topologies can be reduced to statements about a base that generates that topology—and because many topologies are most easily defined in terms of a base that generates them.

===Subspace and quotient===
Every subset of a topological space can be given the subspace topology in which the open sets are the intersections of the open sets of the larger space with the subset. For any indexed family of topological spaces, the product can be given the product topology, which is generated by the inverse images of open sets of the factors under the projection mappings. For example, in finite products, a basis for the product topology consists of all products of open sets. For infinite products, there is the additional requirement that in a basic open set, all but finitely many of its projections are the entire space.

A quotient space is defined as follows: if &quot;X&quot; is a topological space and &quot;Y&quot; is a set, and if &quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot;→ &quot;Y&quot; is a surjective function, then the quotient topology on &quot;Y&quot; is the collection of subsets of &quot;Y&quot; that have open inverse images under &quot;f&quot;. In other words, the quotient topology is the finest topology on &quot;Y&quot; for which &quot;f&quot; is continuous. A common example of a quotient topology is when an equivalence relation is defined on the topological space &quot;X&quot;. The map &quot;f&quot; is then the natural projection onto the set of equivalence classes.

===Examples of topological spaces===
A given set may have many different topologies. If a set is given a different topology, it is viewed as a different topological space.

====Discrete and trivial topologies====
Any set can be given the discrete topology, in which every subset is open. The only convergent sequences or nets in this topology are those that are eventually constant. Also, any set can be given the trivial topology (also called the indiscrete topology), in which only the empty set and the whole space are open. Every sequence and net in this topology converges to every point of the space. This example shows that in general topological spaces, limits of sequences need not be unique. However, often topological spaces must be Hausdorff spaces where limit points are unique.

====Cofinite and cocountable topologies====
Any set can be given the cofinite topology in which the open sets are the empty set and the sets whose complement is finite. This is the smallest T1 topology on any infinite set.

Any set can be given the cocountable topology, in which a set is defined as open if it is either empty or its complement is countable. When the set is uncountable, this topology serves as a counterexample in many situations.

====Topologies on the real and complex numbers====
There are many ways to define a topology on R, the set of real numbers. The standard topology on R is generated by the open intervals. The set of all open intervals forms a base or basis for the topology, meaning that every open set is a union of some collection of sets from the base. In particular, this means that a set is open if there exists an open interval of non zero radius about every point in the set. More generally, the Euclidean spaces R&quot;n&quot; can be given a topology. In the usual topology on R&quot;n&quot; the basic open sets are the open balls. Similarly, C, the set of complex numbers, and C&quot;n&quot; have a standard topology in which the basic open sets are open balls.

The real line can also be given the lower limit topology. Here, the basic open sets are the half open intervals [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;). This topology on R is strictly finer than the Euclidean topology defined above; a sequence converges to a point in this topology if and only if it converges from above in the Euclidean topology. This example shows that a set may have many distinct topologies defined on it.

====The metric topology====
Every metric space can be given a metric topology, in which the basic open sets are open balls defined by the metric. This is the standard topology on any normed vector space. On a finite-dimensional vector space this topology is the same for all norms.

====Further examples====
* There exist numerous topologies on any given finite set. Such spaces are called finite topological spaces. Finite spaces are sometimes used to provide examples or counterexamples to conjectures about topological spaces in general.
* Every manifold has a natural topology, since it is locally Euclidean. Similarly, every simplex and every simplicial complex inherits a natural topology from Rn.
* The Zariski topology is defined algebraically on the spectrum of a ring or an algebraic variety. On R&quot;n&quot; or C&quot;n&quot;, the closed sets of the Zariski topology are the solution sets of systems of polynomial equations.
* A linear graph has a natural topology that generalises many of the geometric aspects of graphs with vertices and edges.
* Many sets of linear operators in functional analysis are endowed with topologies that are defined by specifying when a particular sequence of functions converges to the zero function.
* Any local field has a topology native to it, and this can be extended to vector spaces over that field.
* The Sierpiński space is the simplest non-discrete topological space. It has important relations to the theory of computation and semantics.
* If Γ is an ordinal number, then the set Γ = [0, Γ) may be endowed with the order topology generated by the intervals (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;), [0, &quot;b&quot;) and (&quot;a&quot;, Γ) where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are elements of Γ.

==Continuous functions==
Continuity is expressed in terms of neighborhoods: is continuous at some point if and only if for any neighborhood of , there is a neighborhood of such that . Intuitively, continuity means no matter how &quot;small&quot; becomes, there is always a containing that maps inside and whose image under contains . This is equivalent to the condition that the preimages of the open (closed) sets in are open (closed) in . In metric spaces, this definition is equivalent to the ε–δ-definition that is often used in analysis.

An extreme example: if a set is given the discrete topology, all functions 
:formula_1
to any topological space are continuous. On the other hand, if is equipped with the indiscrete topology and the space set is at least T0, then the only continuous functions are the constant functions. Conversely, any function whose range is indiscrete is continuous.

===Alternative definitions===
Several equivalent definitions for a topological structure exist and thus there are several equivalent ways to define a continuous function.

====Neighborhood definition====
Definitions based on preimages are often difficult to use directly. The following criterion expresses continuity in terms of neighborhoods: &quot;f&quot; is continuous at some point &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot; if and only if for any neighborhood &quot;V&quot; of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), there is a neighborhood &quot;U&quot; of &quot;x&quot; such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;U&quot;) ⊆ &quot;V&quot;. Intuitively, continuity means no matter how &quot;small&quot; &quot;V&quot; becomes, there is always a &quot;U&quot; containing &quot;x&quot; that maps inside &quot;V&quot;.

If &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are metric spaces, it is equivalent to consider the neighborhood system of open balls centered at &quot;x&quot; and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) instead of all neighborhoods. This gives back the above δ-ε definition of continuity in the context of metric spaces. However, in general topological spaces, there is no notion of nearness or distance.

Note, however, that if the target space is Hausdorff, it is still true that &quot;f&quot; is continuous at &quot;a&quot; if and only if the limit of &quot;f&quot; as &quot;x&quot; approaches &quot;a&quot; is &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;). At an isolated point, every function is continuous.

====Sequences and nets ====
In several contexts, the topology of a space is conveniently specified in terms of limit points. In many instances, this is accomplished by specifying when a point is the limit of a sequence, but for some spaces that are too large in some sense, one specifies also when a point is the limit of more general sets of points indexed by a directed set, known as nets. A function is continuous only if it takes limits of sequences to limits of sequences. In the former case, preservation of limits is also sufficient; in the latter, a function may preserve all limits of sequences yet still fail to be continuous, and preservation of nets is a necessary and sufficient condition.

In detail, a function &quot;f&quot;: &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; is sequentially continuous if whenever a sequence (&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;) in &quot;X&quot; converges to a limit &quot;x&quot;, the sequence (&quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;)) converges to &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;). Thus sequentially continuous functions &quot;preserve sequential limits&quot;. Every continuous function is sequentially continuous. If &quot;X&quot; is a first-countable space and countable choice holds, then the converse also holds: any function preserving sequential limits is continuous. In particular, if &quot;X&quot; is a metric space, sequential continuity and continuity are equivalent. For non first-countable spaces, sequential continuity might be strictly weaker than continuity. (The spaces for which the two properties are equivalent are called sequential spaces.) This motivates the consideration of nets instead of sequences in general topological spaces. Continuous functions preserve limits of nets, and in fact this property characterizes continuous functions.

====Closure operator definition====
Instead of specifying the open subsets of a topological space, the topology can also be determined by a closure operator (denoted cl), which assigns to any subset &quot;A&quot; ⊆ &quot;X&quot; its closure, or an interior operator (denoted int), which assigns to any subset &quot;A&quot; of &quot;X&quot; its interior. In these terms, a function 
:formula_2
between topological spaces is continuous in the sense above if and only if for all subsets &quot;A&quot; of &quot;X&quot;
:formula_3
That is to say, given any element &quot;x&quot; of &quot;X&quot; that is in the closure of any subset &quot;A&quot;, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) belongs to the closure of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;A&quot;). This is equivalent to the requirement that for all subsets &quot;A&quot;&#x27; of &quot;X&quot;&#x27;
:formula_4
Moreover, 
:formula_5
is continuous if and only if 
:formula_6
for any subset &quot;A&quot; of &quot;X&quot;.

===Properties===
If &quot;f&quot;: &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;g&quot;: &quot;Y&quot; → &quot;Z&quot; are continuous, then so is the composition &quot;g&quot; ∘ &quot;f&quot;: &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Z&quot;. If &quot;f&quot;: &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; is continuous and
* &quot;X&quot; is compact, then &quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is compact.
* &quot;X&quot; is connected, then &quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is connected.
* &quot;X&quot; is path-connected, then &quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is path-connected.
* &quot;X&quot; is Lindelöf, then &quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is Lindelöf.
* &quot;X&quot; is separable, then &quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is separable.

The possible topologies on a fixed set &quot;X&quot; are partially ordered: a topology τ1 is said to be coarser than another topology τ2 (notation: τ1 ⊆ τ2) if every open subset with respect to τ1 is also open with respect to τ2. Then, the identity map 
:idX: (&quot;X&quot;, τ2) → (&quot;X&quot;, τ1)
is continuous if and only if τ1 ⊆ τ2 (see also comparison of topologies). More generally, a continuous function
:formula_7
stays continuous if the topology τ&quot;Y&quot; is replaced by a coarser topology and/or τ&quot;X&quot; is replaced by a finer topology.

===Homeomorphisms===
Symmetric to the concept of a continuous map is an open map, for which &quot;images&quot; of open sets are open. In fact, if an open map &quot;f&quot; has an inverse function, that inverse is continuous, and if a continuous map &quot;g&quot; has an inverse, that inverse is open. Given a bijective function &quot;f&quot; between two topological spaces, the inverse function &quot;f&quot;−1 need not be continuous. A bijective continuous function with continuous inverse function is called a &quot;homeomorphism&quot;.

If a continuous bijection has as its domain a compact space and its codomain is Hausdorff, then it is a homeomorphism.

===Defining topologies via continuous functions===
Given a function
:formula_8
where &quot;X&quot; is a topological space and &quot;S&quot; is a set (without a specified topology), the final topology on &quot;S&quot; is defined by letting the open sets of &quot;S&quot; be those subsets &quot;A&quot; of &quot;S&quot; for which &quot;f&quot;−1(&quot;A&quot;) is open in &quot;X&quot;. If &quot;S&quot; has an existing topology, &quot;f&quot; is continuous with respect to this topology if and only if the existing topology is coarser than the final topology on &quot;S&quot;. Thus the final topology can be characterized as the finest topology on &quot;S&quot; that makes &quot;f&quot; continuous. If &quot;f&quot; is surjective, this topology is canonically identified with the quotient topology under the equivalence relation defined by &quot;f&quot;.

Dually, for a function &quot;f&quot; from a set &quot;S&quot; to a topological space &quot;X&quot;, the initial topology on &quot;S&quot; has a basis of open sets given by those sets of the form &quot;f^(-1)&quot;(&quot;U&quot;) where &quot;U&quot; is open in &quot;X&quot; . If &quot;S&quot; has an existing topology, &quot;f&quot; is continuous with respect to this topology if and only if the existing topology is finer than the initial topology on &quot;S&quot;. Thus the initial topology can be characterized as the coarsest topology on &quot;S&quot; that makes &quot;f&quot; continuous. If &quot;f&quot; is injective, this topology is canonically identified with the subspace topology of &quot;S&quot;, viewed as a subset of &quot;X&quot;.

A topology on a set &quot;S&quot; is uniquely determined by the class of all continuous functions formula_9 into all topological spaces &quot;X&quot;. Dually, a similar idea can be applied to maps formula_10

==Compact sets==

Formally, a topological space &quot;X&quot; is called &quot;compact&quot; if each of its open covers has a finite subcover. Otherwise it is called &quot;non-compact&quot;. Explicitly, this means that for every arbitrary collection

:formula_11

of open subsets of such that

:formula_12

there is a finite subset of such that

:formula_13

Some branches of mathematics such as algebraic geometry, typically influenced by the French school of Bourbaki, use the term &quot;quasi-compact&quot; for the general notion, and reserve the term &quot;compact&quot; for topological spaces that are both Hausdorff and &quot;quasi-compact&quot;. A compact set is sometimes referred to as a &quot;compactum&quot;, plural &quot;compacta&quot;.

Every closed interval in R of finite length is compact. More is true: In Rn, a set is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. (See Heine–Borel theorem).

Every continuous image of a compact space is compact.

A compact subset of a Hausdorff space is closed.

Every continuous bijection from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is necessarily a homeomorphism.

Every sequence of points in a compact metric space has a convergent subsequence.

Every compact finite-dimensional manifold can be embedded in some Euclidean space Rn.

==Connected sets==

A topological space &quot;X&quot; is said to be disconnected if it is the union of two disjoint nonempty open sets. Otherwise, &quot;X&quot; is said to be connected. A subset of a topological space is said to be connected if it is connected under its subspace topology. Some authors exclude the empty set (with its unique topology) as a connected space, but this article does not follow that practice.

For a topological space &quot;X&quot; the following conditions are equivalent:

#&quot;X&quot; is connected.
#&quot;X&quot; cannot be divided into two disjoint nonempty closed sets.
#The only subsets of &quot;X&quot; that are both open and closed (clopen sets) are &quot;X&quot; and the empty set.
#The only subsets of &quot;X&quot; with empty boundary are &quot;X&quot; and the empty set.
#&quot;X&quot; cannot be written as the union of two nonempty separated sets.
#The only continuous functions from &quot;X&quot; to {0,1}, the two-point space endowed with the discrete topology, are constant.

Every interval in R is connected.

The continuous image of a connected space is connected.

===Connected components===
The maximal connected subsets (ordered by inclusion) of a nonempty topological space are called the connected components of the space.
The components of any topological space &quot;X&quot; form a partition of &quot;X&quot;: they are disjoint, nonempty, and their union is the whole space.
Every component is a closed subset of the original space. It follows that, in the case where their number is finite, each component is also an open subset. However, if their number is infinite, this might not be the case; for instance, the connected components of the set of the rational numbers are the one-point sets, which are not open.

Let formula_14 be the connected component of &quot;x&quot; in a topological space &quot;X&quot;, and formula_15 be the intersection of all open-closed sets containing &quot;x&quot; (called quasi-component of &quot;x&quot;.) Then formula_16 where the equality holds if &quot;X&quot; is compact Hausdorff or locally connected.

===Disconnected spaces===
A space in which all components are one-point sets is called totally disconnected. Related to this property, a space &quot;X&quot; is called totally separated if, for any two distinct elements &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; of &quot;X&quot;, there exist disjoint open neighborhoods &quot;U&quot; of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;V&quot; of &quot;y&quot; such that &quot;X&quot; is the union of &quot;U&quot; and &quot;V&quot;. Clearly any totally separated space is totally disconnected, but the converse does not hold. For example, take two copies of the rational numbers Q, and identify them at every point except zero. The resulting space, with the quotient topology, is totally disconnected. However, by considering the two copies of zero, one sees that the space is not totally separated. In fact, it is not even Hausdorff, and the condition of being totally separated is strictly stronger than the condition of being Hausdorff.

===Path-connected sets===
A &quot;path&quot; from a point &quot;x&quot; to a point &quot;y&quot; in a topological space &quot;X&quot; is a continuous function &quot;f&quot; from the unit interval [0,1] to &quot;X&quot; with &quot;f&quot;(0) = &quot;x&quot; and &quot;f&quot;(1) = &quot;y&quot;. A &quot;path-component&quot; of &quot;X&quot; is an equivalence class of &quot;X&quot; under the equivalence relation, which makes &quot;x&quot; equivalent to &quot;y&quot; if there is a path from &quot;x&quot; to &quot;y&quot;. The space &quot;X&quot; is said to be &quot;path-connected&quot; (or &quot;pathwise connected&quot; or &quot;0-connected&quot;) if there is at most one path-component; that is, if there is a path joining any two points in &quot;X&quot;. Again, many authors exclude the empty space.

Every path-connected space is connected. The converse is not always true: examples of connected spaces that are not path-connected include the extended long line &quot;L&quot;* and the &quot;topologist&#x27;s sine curve&quot;.

However, subsets of the real line R are connected if and only if they are path-connected; these subsets are the intervals of R. Also, open subsets of R&quot;n&quot; or C&quot;n&quot; are connected if and only if they are path-connected. Additionally, connectedness and path-connectedness are the same for finite topological spaces.

==Products of spaces==

Given &quot;X&quot; such that

:formula_17

is the Cartesian product of the topological spaces &quot;Xi&quot;, indexed by formula_18, and the canonical projections &quot;pi&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Xi&quot;, the product topology on &quot;X&quot; is defined as the coarsest topology (i.e. the topology with the fewest open sets) for which all the projections &quot;pi&quot; are continuous. The product topology is sometimes called the Tychonoff topology.

The open sets in the product topology are unions (finite or infinite) of sets of the form formula_19, where each &quot;Ui&quot; is open in &quot;Xi&quot; and &quot;U&quot;&quot;i&quot; ≠ &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; only finitely many times. In particular, for a finite product (in particular, for the product of two topological spaces), the products of base elements of the &quot;Xi&quot; gives a basis for the product formula_20.

The product topology on &quot;X&quot; is the topology generated by sets of the form &quot;pi&quot;−1(&quot;U&quot;), where &quot;i&quot; is in &quot;I &quot; and &quot;U&quot; is an open subset of &quot;Xi&quot;. In other words, the sets {&quot;pi&quot;−1(&quot;U&quot;)} form a subbase for the topology on &quot;X&quot;. A subset of &quot;X&quot; is open if and only if it is a (possibly infinite) union of intersections of finitely many sets of the form &quot;pi&quot;−1(&quot;U&quot;). The &quot;pi&quot;−1(&quot;U&quot;) are sometimes called open cylinders, and their intersections are cylinder sets.

In general, the product of the topologies of each &quot;Xi&quot; forms a basis for what is called the box topology on &quot;X&quot;. In general, the box topology is finer than the product topology, but for finite products they coincide.

Related to compactness is Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem: the (arbitrary) product of compact spaces is compact.

==Separation axioms==

Many of these names have alternative meanings in some of mathematical literature, as explained on History of the separation axioms; for example, the meanings of &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;T4&quot; are sometimes interchanged, similarly &quot;regular&quot; and &quot;T3&quot;, etc. Many of the concepts also have several names; however, the one listed first is always least likely to be ambiguous.

Most of these axioms have alternative definitions with the same meaning; the definitions given here fall into a consistent pattern that relates the various notions of separation defined in the previous section. Other possible definitions can be found in the individual articles.

In all of the following definitions, &quot;X&quot; is again a topological space.

* &quot;X&quot; is &quot;T0&quot;, or &quot;Kolmogorov&quot;, if any two distinct points in &quot;X&quot; are topologically distinguishable. (It is a common theme among the separation axioms to have one version of an axiom that requires T0 and one version that doesn&#x27;t.)
* &quot;X&quot; is &quot;T1&quot;, or &quot;accessible&quot; or &quot;Fréchet&quot;, if any two distinct points in &quot;X&quot; are separated. Thus, &quot;X&quot; is T1 if and only if it is both T0 and R0. (Though you may say such things as &quot;T1 space&quot;, &quot;Fréchet topology&quot;, and &quot;Suppose that the topological space &quot;X&quot; is Fréchet&quot;, avoid saying &quot;Fréchet space&quot; in this context, since there is another entirely different notion of Fréchet space in functional analysis.)
* &quot;X&quot; is &quot;Hausdorff&quot;, or &quot;T2&quot; or &quot;separated&quot;, if any two distinct points in &quot;X&quot; are separated by neighbourhoods. Thus, &quot;X&quot; is Hausdorff if and only if it is both T0 and R1. A Hausdorff space must also be T1.
* &quot;X&quot; is &quot;T2½&quot;, or &quot;Urysohn&quot;, if any two distinct points in &quot;X&quot; are separated by closed neighbourhoods. A T2½ space must also be Hausdorff.
* &quot;X&quot; is &quot;regular&quot;, or &quot;T3&quot;, if it is T0 and if given any point &quot;x&quot; and closed set &quot;F&quot; in &quot;X&quot; such that &quot;x&quot; does not belong to &quot;F&quot;, they are separated by neighbourhoods. (In fact, in a regular space, any such &quot;x&quot; and &quot;F&quot; is also separated by closed neighbourhoods.)
* &quot;X&quot; is &quot;Tychonoff&quot;, or &quot;T3½&quot;, &quot;completely T3&quot;, or &quot;completely regular&quot;, if it is T0 and if f, given any point &quot;x&quot; and closed set &quot;F&quot; in &quot;X&quot; such that &quot;x&quot; does not belong to &quot;F&quot;, they are separated by a continuous function.
* &quot;X&quot; is &quot;normal&quot;, or &quot;T4&quot;, if it is Hausdorff and if any two disjoint closed subsets of &quot;X&quot; are separated by neighbourhoods. (In fact, a space is normal if and only if any two disjoint closed sets can be separated by a continuous function; this is Urysohn&#x27;s lemma.)
* &quot;X&quot; is &quot;completely normal&quot;, or &quot;T5&quot; or &quot;completely T4&quot;, if it is T1 and if any two separated sets are separated by neighbourhoods. A completely normal space must also be normal.
* &quot;X&quot; is &quot;perfectly normal&quot;, or &quot;T6&quot; or &quot;perfectly T4&quot;, if it is T1 and if any two disjoint closed sets are precisely separated by a continuous function. A perfectly normal Hausdorff space must also be completely normal Hausdorff.

The Tietze extension theorem: In a normal space, every continuous real-valued function defined on a closed subspace can be extended to a continuous map defined on the whole space.

==Countability axioms==

An axiom of countability is a property of certain mathematical objects (usually in a category) that requires the existence of a countable set with certain properties, while without it such sets might not exist.

Important countability axioms for topological spaces:
*sequential space: a set is open if every sequence convergent to a point in the set is eventually in the set
*first-countable space: every point has a countable neighbourhood basis (local base)
*second-countable space: the topology has a countable base
*separable space: there exists a countable dense subspace
*Lindelöf space: every open cover has a countable subcover
*σ-compact space: there exists a countable cover by compact spaces

Relations:
*Every first countable space is sequential.
*Every second-countable space is first-countable, separable, and Lindelöf.
*Every σ-compact space is Lindelöf.
*A metric space is first-countable.
*For metric spaces second-countability, separability, and the Lindelöf property are all equivalent.

==Metric spaces==

A metric space is an ordered pair formula_21 where formula_22 is a set and formula_23 is a metric on formula_22, i.e., a function

:formula_25

such that for any formula_26, the following holds:

# formula_27     (&quot;non-negative&quot;), 
# formula_28 iff formula_29     (&quot;identity of indiscernibles&quot;),
# formula_30     (&quot;symmetry&quot;) and
# formula_31     (&quot;triangle inequality&quot;) .

The function formula_23 is also called &quot;distance function&quot; or simply &quot;distance&quot;. Often, formula_23 is omitted and one just writes formula_22 for a metric space if it is clear from the context what metric is used.

Every metric space is paracompact and Hausdorff, and thus normal.

The metrization theorems provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a topology to come from a metric.

==Baire category theorem==
The Baire category theorem says: If &quot;X&quot; is a complete metric space or a locally compact Hausdorff space, then the interior of every union of countably many nowhere dense sets is empty.

Any open subspace of a Baire space is itself a Baire space.

==Main areas of research==
===Continuum theory===

A continuum (pl &quot;continua&quot;) is a nonempty compact connected metric space, or less frequently, a compact connected Hausdorff space. Continuum theory is the branch of topology devoted to the study of continua. These objects arise frequently in nearly all areas of topology and analysis, and their properties are strong enough to yield many &#x27;geometric&#x27; features.

===Dynamical systems===

Topological dynamics concerns the behavior of a space and its subspaces over time when subjected to continuous change. Many examples with applications to physics and other areas of math include fluid dynamics, billiards and flows on manifolds. The topological characteristics of fractals in fractal geometry, of Julia sets and the Mandelbrot set arising in complex dynamics, and of attractors in differential equations are often critical to understanding these systems.

===Pointless topology===

Pointless topology (also called point-free or pointfree topology) is an approach to topology that avoids mentioning points. The name &#x27;pointless topology&#x27; is due to John von Neumann. The ideas of pointless topology are closely related to mereotopologies, in which regions (sets) are treated as foundational without explicit reference to underlying point sets.

===Dimension theory===

Dimension theory is a branch of general topology dealing with dimensional invariants of topological spaces.

===Topological algebras===

A topological algebra &quot;A&quot; over a topological field K is a topological vector space together with a continuous multiplication

:formula_35
:formula_36

that makes it an algebra over K. A unital associative topological algebra is a topological ring.

The term was coined by David van Dantzig; it appears in the title of his doctoral dissertation (1931).

===Metrizability theory===

In topology and related areas of mathematics, a metrizable space is a topological space that is homeomorphic to a metric space. That is, a topological space formula_37 is said to be metrizable if there is a metric 
:formula_38

such that the topology induced by &quot;d&quot; is formula_39. Metrization theorems are theorems that give sufficient conditions for a topological space to be metrizable.

===Set-theoretic topology===

Set-theoretic topology is a subject that combines set theory and general topology. It focuses on topological questions that are independent of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZFC). A famous problem is the normal Moore space question, a question in general topology that was the subject of intense research. The answer to the normal Moore space question was eventually proved to be independent of ZFC.

<text>Moral example is trust in the moral code of a role model.

It is the case that since the exact circumstances and decisions of the lives of such moral examples cannot be reproduced or repeated, followers are often reduced to following their etiquette and customs, e.g. in ancestor worship.

Storytelling can take a central role in any culture built on moral example, particularly when the provider of the moral example does not refer to an explicit ethical theory or philosophy as the basis for their behavior. A complex culture built on such stories can fall prey to a clique of experts who interpret them for the lay public. This has led in the past to institutions that sort through anecdotes to decide which of them are true, e.g. isnad in Islam by which the hadith are validated.

Christians still see Jesus as the ultimate divine example- in Epistle to the Hebrews: &quot;looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith&quot; (12:2).

<doc id="178653" wikidata="Q1136974" url="?curid=178653" title="Role model">
<text>A role model is a person whose behaviour, example, or success serves as a model to be emulated by others, especially by younger people. The term &quot;role model&quot; is credited to sociologist Robert K. Merton, who hypothesized that individuals compare themselves with reference groups of people who occupy the social role to which the individual aspires, an example of which is the way young fans may idolize and imitate professional athletes or entertainment artists.

In the second half of the twentieth century, U.S. advocates for workplace equity popularized the term and concept of role models as part of a larger social capital lexicon—which also includes terms such as glass ceiling, networking, mentoring, and gatekeeper—serving to identify and address the problems barring non-dominant groups from professional success. Mainstream business literature subsequently adopted the terms and concepts, promoting them as pathways to success for all career climbers. In 1970 these terms were not in the general American vocabulary; by the mid-1990s they had become part of everyday speech. Although the term &quot;role model&quot; has been criticized more recently as &quot;outdated&quot;, the term and its associated responsibility remains prominent in the public consciousness as a commonly used phrase, and a &quot;powerful presence&quot; in the entertainment industry and media.

Role models can also be national. for example, Chilean politicians and intellectuals had France as the prime role model during much of the 19th century until they shifted to Germany in the last decades of the century. In short, a role model is a person looked to by others as an example to be imitated.

== Effect on career opportunity and choice ==

According to historian Pamela Laird, a person&#x27;s chosen role models may have a considerable impact on his or her career opportunities and choices. The suitability of a role model depends, in part, on the admirer&#x27;s perceived commonality with the model, who should provide an image of an ambitious yet realistic goal. For example, Laird suggests that, Benjamin Franklin served as the role model for countless nineteenth-century white businessmen, including notables such as Thomas Mellon, B.F. Goodrich, and Frederick Weyerhäuser. Laird suggests that the lack of commonalities between potential role models and would-be admirers helped perpetuate barriers to American minorities and women as they tried to advance in a business world dominated by white men, thus spurring late twentieth-century efforts to develop suitable role models for these groups.

Parent role models also significantly influence a person&#x27;s &quot;education and training aspirations, task self-efficacy, and expectancy for an entrepreneurial career&quot;.

== Celebrity role models==

The ever-widening reach of the media in popular culture has elevated certain celebrities to worldwide acclaim. This boom of media coverage and constant exposure to these individuals resulted in a change of mindset toward celebrities in both adults and youth alike. According to a survey of teachers in the United Kingdom conducted in 2008 by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, young people most frequently chose sports stars as role models, followed by pop stars. Many, however, simply aspired to be &quot;famous for being famous&quot;, believing that fame and fortune could be easily accessed through reality television.

==Community role models==

According to Rita Pierson, teachers, because of the large amount of time spent with children, have such a huge impact on children that they&#x27;re being advised to be likeable in order to build strong emotional relationships with children.

==Athlete role models==
There is significant discussion as to whether athletes should be considered role models. Some athletes have been asked to behave as if they were role models for their local communities, and some such as Hank Greenberg have deliberately tried to set a good example but generally regarding athletes as role models has been criticised due to their appointment often being based solely on sporting ability rather than any morality – it has been suggested that the discipline and control shown continuously by sportspeople on the field leads to a belief from viewers that these same qualities are continuously shown off the field. These and other factors such as the elements of competition, excitement and success are what make people want to emulate them. Charles Barkley has stated that he believes athletes are not the figures that children should be emulating and that it is the parent&#x27;s responsibility to be role models, that the role is deliberately applied by the media out of jealousy in order to make life more difficult for sportspeople, and that it sets up the sportspeople as an unattainable target for most.

== The Importance of Role Models for Children ==
Role models are visible in the process of child and personal development, through shaping a person&#x27;s morals, aspirations, and even confidence level. Role models can have either a positive or negative influence on children, depending on what they are promoting. However, many studies have shown that positive relationships with a role model is associated with higher levels of certain traits, such as &quot;elevated self-esteem, performance in school, and resilience&quot;. Role models, similar to mentors, have also proven to reduce risky behavior in adolescents.

Certain behaviors practiced by role models in an adolescent&#x27;s life, can usually be seen replicated by that adolescent—due to the higher standard that the child holds their role model(s) to&quot;.&quot; One of the most commonly cited role models by children are their family members - because of the positive attributes that they are constantly exposed to.

Without these types of figures, to rely on through observational learning, during child development can result in ill decision-making skills, or even a lacking sense of self later down the road.

== The Impact of Role Models on Young Girls ==
Role models play an impactful role in shaping the aspirations, self-perceptions, and attitudes of girls, particularly when they intend to challenge traditional gender norms. Positive role models, especially women in male dominated fields, such as STEM, can inspire the younger generation of women to expand their understandings of what is possible for them to achieve. According to a study conducted by Laurie T. O&#x27;Brien, middle school girls who interacted with competent and enthusiastic female scientists reported a greater sense of belonging in STEM fields.

Role Models play a part into younger children with their aspirations of a career choice. The HarvardKennedySchool conducted research on how the influence of role models for students interested in STEM, to which students agreed that their choice of who their role model reflected back with how they correlate and identify with their pick. The importance is underscored within the assumption that exposing children to gender counter-stereotypical role models can challenge their gendered aspirations.

In media, the portrayal of strong, independent female characters such as Disney Princesses, also influences girl&#x27;s actions and perceptions of gender roles. Cartoons like Elsa and Mulan challenge traditional depictions of femininity by instead focusing on themes like bravery and independence as opposed to the typical portrayal of the beautiful, love interest princess. These portrayals encourage girls to embrace diverse qualities and pursue their personal ambitions, thereby fostering a sense of empowerment and resilience.

It is also important to note how within the younger generation of girl&#x27;s the influence of in Disney Princesses on them, Mulan as an example, struggles with her identity, moments within the song &quot;Reflection&quot;, she questions societal exceptions that were placed upon her. In the movie she wipes off her makeup and transforms from a potential bride into a warrior. Mulan disobeys the stereotypical role assigned to her as a woman and continues with her journey by empowering the message that it&#x27;s okay to not conform into these social norms through encouraging individuals to embrace their true identities.

Within the 1950 version of Cinderella, there is discussion about the challenge of gender stereotypes. Cinderella shows a gentle side through the treatment she gets from her step-mother and step-sisters. Throughout her story she is treated like a housewife even if she doesn&#x27;t agree with how she has to live. However, on the deeper level when it comes to appearance body dysmorphia comes into play. Towards the end of the movie, when her Prince Charming goes around the whole kingdom with her lost slipper trying to find his true love. Within recent perspectives as of 2021, children may be negatively affected by watching these older Disney movies, believing that being a princess is having to fit the weight criteria or that their personal family will be as perfect as they are within the movie(s).

However the impact of role models is nuanced. While short term exposure to non-traditional female role models can help reduce gender stereotypes in certain situations, it does not always translate to sustained changes in behavior or career aspirations. Studies like one done by Frontiers in Psychology show that lasting influence requires ongoing engagement and support, such as mentorship programs.

On the other hand, of things, researchers observed same-sex role models in the same job field foster gender-congruent aspirations and behavior. This learning process leads children to adopt gender-stereotypical knowledge which later on influences their aspirations to align with traditional gender roles (e.g., women aspiring to take care of individuals, men being represented into typical leadership positions). The research also found that children who are exposed to gender-incongruent roles such as male kindergarten teachers, or female scientists then this can challenger traditional gender norms. Individuals who are defy to gender stereotypes reduce the impact of gender stereotyping within children, in the end leads to stereotypical aspirations and behaviors.

<text>Constance of Burgundy (8 May 1046 – 1093) was the daughter of Duke Robert I of Burgundy and Helie de Semur-en-Brionnais. She was Queen of Castile and León by her marriage to Alfonso VI of León and Castile. She was the granddaughter of King Robert II of France, the second monarch of the French Capetian dynasty. She was the mother of Urraca of León, who succeeded her father in both Castile and León.

==Life==
In 1065, Constance married her first husband, Hugh II, Count of Chalon. They were married for fourteen years until Hugh&#x27;s death in 1079. They had no children.

In late 1079, Constance remarried to Alfonso VI of León and Castile. The marriage appears to have been orchestrated via the Cluniac connections at Alfonso&#x27;s court. He had previously been married to Agnes of Aquitaine, whom he had either divorced or had been widowed by. The marriage of Constance and Alfonso initially faced papal opposition, apparently due to a kinship between Constance and Agnes.

Constance and Alfonso had six children but only Urraca, born in 1081, survived to adulthood. Constance died in 1093.

== Burial ==
After her death, the corpse of Constance was taken to the town of Sahagún and was buried in the Monastery of St. Facundo and Primitivo, where her husband, King Alfonso VI would be buried along with all his wives.

The grave that contained the remains of Alfonso VI was destroyed in 1810 during a fire in the Monastery. The remains of the king and several of his wives, including those of Constance, were collected and kept in the abbot&#x27;s chamber until 1821. When the religious were expelled from the monastery, they were then deposited by Abbot Ramon Joys in a box that was placed on the south wall of the chapel of the Crucifix, until, in January 1835, the remains were collected and placed in another box, being brought to the archive. The purpose was to place all remaining interests in a new sanctuary that was being built then. However, when the monastery of San Benito was disentailed in 1835, the monks gave the two boxes containing the actual remains to the relative of a priest, who hid them until 1902 were found by the professor Zamora Rodrigo Fernández Núñez.

Today, the remains of Alfonso VI are buried in the Royal Monastery of San Benito in Sahagún, at the foot of the temple, in sarcophagus of smooth stone with a modern marble cover. In a similar tomb nearby lie the remains of several of the king&#x27;s wives, including those of Constance.

<text>Ernst Friedrich Ferdinand Zermelo (; ; 27 July 187121 May 1953) was a German logician and mathematician, whose work has major implications for the foundations of mathematics. He is known for his role in developing Zermelo–Fraenkel axiomatic set theory and his proof of the well-ordering theorem. Furthermore, his 1929 work on ranking chess players is the first description of a model for pairwise comparison that continues to have a profound impact on various applied fields utilizing this method.

==Life==

Ernst Zermelo graduated from Berlin&#x27;s Luisenstädtisches Gymnasium (now ) in 1889. He then studied mathematics, physics and philosophy at the University of Berlin, the University of Halle, and the University of Freiburg. He finished his doctorate in 1894 at the University of Berlin, awarded for a dissertation on the calculus of variations (&quot;Untersuchungen zur Variationsrechnung&quot;). Zermelo remained at the University of Berlin, where he was appointed assistant to Planck, under whose guidance he began to study hydrodynamics. In 1897, Zermelo went to the University of Göttingen, at that time the leading centre for mathematical research in the world, where he completed his habilitation thesis in 1899.

In 1910, Zermelo left Göttingen upon being appointed to the chair of mathematics at Zurich University, which he resigned in 1916.
He was appointed to an honorary chair at the University of Freiburg in 1926, which he resigned in 1935 because he disapproved of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s regime. At the end of World War II and at his request, Zermelo was reinstated to his honorary position in Freiburg.

==Research in set theory==

In 1900, in the Paris conference of the International Congress of Mathematicians, David Hilbert challenged the mathematical community with his famous Hilbert&#x27;s problems, a list of 23 unsolved fundamental questions which mathematicians should attack during the coming century. The first of these, a problem of set theory, was the continuum hypothesis introduced by Cantor in 1878, and in the course of its statement Hilbert mentioned also the need to prove the well-ordering theorem.

Zermelo began to work on the problems of set theory under Hilbert&#x27;s influence and in 1902 published his first work concerning the addition of transfinite cardinals. By that time he had also discovered the so-called Russell paradox. In 1904, he succeeded in taking the first step suggested by Hilbert towards the continuum hypothesis when he proved the well-ordering theorem (&quot;every set can be well ordered&quot;). This result brought fame to Zermelo, who was appointed Professor in Göttingen, in 1905. His proof of the well-ordering theorem, based on the powerset axiom and the axiom of choice, was not accepted by all mathematicians, mostly because the axiom of choice was a paradigm of non-constructive mathematics. In 1908, Zermelo succeeded in producing an improved proof making use of Dedekind&#x27;s notion of the &quot;chain&quot; of a set, which became more widely accepted; this was mainly because that same year he also offered an axiomatization of set theory.

Zermelo began to axiomatize set theory in 1905; in 1908, he published his results despite his failure to prove the consistency of his axiomatic system. See the article on Zermelo set theory for an outline of this paper, together with the original axioms, with the original numbering.

In 1922, Abraham Fraenkel and Thoralf Skolem independently improved Zermelo&#x27;s axiom system. The resulting system, now called Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms (ZF), is now the most commonly used system for axiomatic set theory.

==Zermelo&#x27;s navigation problem==
Proposed in 1931, the Zermelo&#x27;s navigation problem is a classic optimal control problem. The problem deals with a boat navigating on a body of water, originating from a point O to a destination point D. The boat is capable of a certain maximum speed, and we want to derive the best possible control to reach D in the least possible time.

Without considering external forces such as current and wind, the optimal control is for the boat to always head towards D. Its path then is a line segment from O to D, which is trivially optimal. With consideration of current and wind, if the combined force applied to the boat is non-zero, the control for no current and wind does not yield the optimal path.

<text>A day fighter is a fighter aircraft equipped only to fight during the day. More specifically, it refers to a multi-purpose aircraft that does not include equipment for fighting at night (such as a radar and specialized avionics), although it is sometimes used to refer to some interceptors as well.

The term is an example of a retronym: before the development of effective dedicated night fighter aircraft early in World War II, in effect, all fighter aircraft that were not specifically modified for night combat were day fighters.

==World War II==
Examples of planes that were classified as day fighters were the Supermarine Spitfire and Messerschmitt Bf 109. Both were excellent interceptors, but were also found in roles such as fighter-bomber and reconnaissance. However, the weight of the radar systems needed to effectively track down enemy bombers at night was such that these smaller aircraft simply couldn&#x27;t carry them given the electronics of the day. This led to the use of twin-engine aircraft like the Bristol Beaufighter and Messerschmitt Bf 110 as dedicated night fighters, at which point the term day fighter began to be used.

Some lighter designs like the Hawker Hurricane and Focke-Wulf Fw 190 were also adapted to night fighting after a fashion, lacking radar and relying on searchlights or fires on the ground to illuminate their targets. These were preferred over the Spitfire and Bf 109 largely due to their wide-track landing gear, which made landing at night somewhat safer. Although such designs were in service throughout the war, they proved to have little real effectiveness compared to the dedicated night fighter designs.

Late in the war the considerable advances in radar technology, notably the introduction of the cavity magnetron, allowed for much smaller radar sets. At the same time, aircraft engines had roughly doubled in performance over the same period. This led to the late-war introduction of single-engine night fighters like the Grumman F6F, Vought F4U, as well as more agile twin-engine planes such as the Lockheed P-38, with some success.

==Post-war==
As the size and weight of night-fighting equipment remained considerable in comparison to airframe size and engine power, the day fighter remained a part of front-line air forces into the 1960s. In the immediate post-war era, designs like the North American F-86 Sabre, Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 and Hawker Hunter typified the day-fighter role. These were followed by similar supersonic designs in the early 1960s, including the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21.

However, as the size of basic fighters grew, along with their engine power, the relative cost of carrying night-fighting equipment fell until most designs carried such equipment. Lightweight fighters without full night equipment such as the F-5 Freedom Fighter/Tiger II are still used by nations that lack the money to acquire advanced fighter aircraft.

The last of the purpose-designed day fighters were the original American General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon and the Northrop YF-17 that competed for the Lightweight Fighter contract, which had the goal of providing the USAF with an inexpensive day fighter that could be purchased in great numbers to establish air superiority. The designs originated in a mid-1960s effort known as the &quot;Advanced Day Fighter&quot;. After winning the contract the F-16 quickly matured into a much more capable multi-role aircraft and can no longer be considered a day fighter. Likewise, the YF-17 evolved into the much larger McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet and Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, which is used in the 2010s by the United States Navy as the primary all-weather combat aircraft.

<doc id="178661" wikidata="Q249232" url="?curid=178661" title="War of the Third Coalition">
<text>The War of the Third Coalition () was a European conflict lasting from 1805 to 1806 and was the first conflict of the Napoleonic Wars. During the war, France and its client states under Napoleon I and its ally Spain opposed an alliance, the Third Coalition, which was made up of the United Kingdom, the Austrian Empire, the Russian Empire, Naples, Sicily, and Sweden. Prussia remained neutral during the war.

Britain had already been at war with France following the breakdown of the Peace of Amiens and remained the only country still at war with France after the Treaty of Pressburg. From 1803 to 1805, Britain stood under constant threat of a French invasion. The Royal Navy, however, assured its naval dominance at the Battle of Trafalgar in October 1805.

The Third Coalition itself came to full fruition in 1804–05 as Napoleon&#x27;s actions in Italy and Germany (notably the arrest and execution of the Duc d&#x27;Enghien) spurred Austria and Russia into joining Britain against France. The war would be determined on the continent, and the major land operations that sealed the swift French victory involved the Ulm Campaign, a large wheeling manoeuvre by the lasting from late August to mid-October 1805 that captured an entire Austrian army, and the decisive French victory over a combined Austro-Russian force under Alexander I of Russia at the Battle of Austerlitz in early December. Austerlitz effectively brought the Third Coalition to an end, although later there was a small side campaign against Naples, which also resulted in a decisive French victory at the Battle of Campo Tenese.

On 26 December 1805, Austria and France signed the Treaty of Pressburg, which took Austria out of both the war and the Coalition, while it reinforced the earlier treaties of Campo Formio and of Lunéville between the two powers. The treaty confirmed the Austrian cession of lands in Italy to France and in Germany to Napoleon&#x27;s German allies, imposed an indemnity of 40 million francs on the defeated Habsburgs, and allowed the defeated Russian troops free passage, with their arms and equipment, through hostile territories and back to their home soil. Victory at Austerlitz also prompted Napoleon to create the Confederation of the Rhine, a collection of German client states that pledged themselves to raise an army of 63,000 men. As a direct consequence of those events, the Holy Roman Empire ceased to exist when, in 1806, Francis II abdicated the Imperial throne, becoming Francis I, Emperor of Austria. Those achievements, however, did not establish a lasting peace on the continent. Austerlitz had driven neither Russia nor Britain, whose fleet protected Sicily from a French invasion, to cease fighting. Meanwhile, Prussian worries about the growing French influence in Central Europe sparked the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806.

== Periodisation ==
Historians differ on when the War of the Third Coalition began and when it ended. From the British perspective, the war started when Britain declared war on France on 18 May 1803, but it was still on its own. It was not until December 1804 when Sweden entered into an alliance with the United Kingdom, not until 11 April 1805 when Russia joined the alliance, not until 16 July when Britain and Russia ratified their treaty of alliance, and only thereafter Austria (9 August) and Naples–Sicily (11 September) completed the fully-fledged coalition.

Meanwhile, Bavaria sided with France on 25 August following the Treaty of Bogenhausen, and Württemberg joined Napoleon on 5 September. No major hostilities between France and any member of the coalition other than Britain (Trafalgar campaign March–November 1805) occurred until the Ulm Campaign (25 September – 20 October 1805). This was in part because Napoleon&#x27;s planned invasion of the United Kingdom was not called off until 27 August 1805, when he decided to use his invasion force camped at Boulogne against Austria instead.

Likewise, no major battles occurred after the Battle of Austerlitz and the signing of the Peace of Pressburg on 26 December 1805, which forced Austria to leave the Third Coalition and cease hostilities against France. Some historians conclude that Austria&#x27;s departure &quot;shattered the fragile Third Coalition&quot; and &quot;ended the War of the Third Coalition&quot;.

This narrative leaves out the subsequent French invasion of Naples (February–July 1806), which the occupying Anglo-Russian troops hastily evacuated and the remaining Neapolitan forces relatively quickly surrendered. Other scholars argue the southern Italian campaign should be included into the War of the Second Coalition, and criticise ignoring the Mediterranean front by only focusing on land battles in Central Europe and the Trafalgar campaign.

==Prelude==
===From Amiens to the Third Coalition===
In March 1802, hostilities between France and the Allies came to an end. However it was clear to the leading European politicians, and especially to Napoleon, that the peace treaties of Lunéville (1801) and Amiens (1802), which ended the Second War of Coalition, were not a lasting solution. Tensions between Napoleon-ruled France and Great Britain had been rising again since the second half of 1802. The fact that Napoleon played an active role in the Caribbean contributed to this. There were also indications that he was once again interested in Egypt and the Middle East. There were reports in French newspapers that 10,000 men would be enough to reconquer Egypt.
In Italy, Napoleon increased his influence when he transformed the Cisalpine Republic into the Italian Republic and made himself president. He annexed Piedmont to France. Contrary to the peace treaty of Amiens, the French army was not withdrawn from the Netherlands; instead, the Batavian Republic was given a new constitution based on the French model. The Helvetic Republic was also closely dependent on France. Napoleon had given the country a new federalist constitution with the Act of Mediation. At the same time, the country had had to bind itself politically to France for fifty years. 

The peace treaty stipulated that Great Britain was to return all conquered territories except Ceylon and Trinidad to their respective previous owners. Minorca to Spain and Malta to the Order of St. John. In return, France was to leave Egypt and Naples and guarantee the independence of Portugal and the Ionian Islands. In order to prevent Napoleon from advancing further into the Levant, it was necessary for Great Britain to keep Malta and a fleet in the Mediterranean. Russia&#x27;s interest in Malta offered Napoleon an ideal opportunity for a war in which he hoped to play Britain and Russia off against each other. Napoleon indirectly threatened war on 13 March 1803 when he criticized Britain&#x27;s violation of the peace treaty to the British ambassador Lord Whitworth. The ambassador returned to London and shortly afterwards, on May 18, Great Britain declared war on France.
===Setting up the opposing forces===
When Napoleon crowned himself Emperor on December 2, 1804, Austria and Prussia may have been alarmed, but the annexed Italian city-states of Genoa, Parma and Piacenza and his coronation as King of Italy left no doubt as to Napoleon&#x27;s intentions. On January 21, 1805, Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger presented a treaty of alliance with Russia and Austria. The demands of this treaty were the restoration of the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, the withdrawal of French troops from Italy, the dissolution of the Batavian Republic and the restoration of Switzerland&#x27;s independence. In the event of Napoleon&#x27;s refusal, England would support the coalition forces financially. After all difficulties had been resolved, Great Britain, Austria and Russia signed a treaty on August 9, 1805, forming the third coalition against Napoleon. Prussia remained neutral.
On the other side, Napoleon built an alliance of various southern German members of the Holy Roman Empire. These included Württemberg, Bavaria and Baden, which benefited from the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss of February 25, 1803. These enlarged states were in line with Napoleon&#x27;s calculations. They were to weaken Austria, but were themselves too weak to pose a threat to France.

=== at Boulogne===

Prior to the formation of the Third Coalition, Napoleon had assembled the &quot;Army of England&quot;, an invasion force meant to strike at England, from around six camps at Boulogne in Northern France. Although they never set foot on British soil, Napoleon&#x27;s troops received careful and invaluable training for any possible military operation. Boredom among the troops occasionally set in, but Napoleon paid many visits and conducted lavish parades in order to boost the morale of the soldiers.

The men at Boulogne formed the core for what Napoleon would later call (&quot;The Great Army&quot;). At the start, this French army had about 200,000 men organized into seven corps, each capable of independent action or in concert with other corps. Corps were large combined arms field units typically containing 2–4 infantry divisions, a cavalry division, and about 36 to 40 cannon.

On top of these forces, Napoleon created a cavalry reserve of 22,000 organized into two cuirassier divisions, four mounted dragoon divisions, and two divisions of dismounted dragoons and light cavalry, all supported by 24 artillery pieces. By 1805, the had grown to a force of 350,000, was well equipped, adequately trained, and possessed a skilled officer class.

===Russian and Austrian armies===
The Imperial Russian Army in 1805 had many characteristics of ancien régime military organization: there was no permanent formation above the regimental level, senior officers were largely recruited from aristocratic circles (including foreigners), and the Russian soldier, in line with 18th-century practice, was regularly beaten and punished to instill discipline. Furthermore, many lower-level officers were poorly trained and had difficulty getting their men to perform the sometimes complex manoeuvres required in a battle. Nevertheless, the Russians did have a fine artillery arm manned by soldiers who regularly fought hard to prevent their pieces from falling into enemy hands.

Archduke Charles, brother of the Austrian Emperor, had started to reform the Austrian army in 1801 by taking away power from the Hofkriegsrat, the military-political council responsible for decision-making in the Austrian armed forces. Charles was Austria&#x27;s best field commander, but he was unpopular with the imperial court and lost much influence when, against his advice, Austria decided to go to war with France. Karl Mack became the new main commander in Austria&#x27;s army, instituting reforms on the infantry on the eve of war that called for a regiment to be composed of four battalions of four companies rather than the older three battalions of six companies. The sudden change came with no corresponding officer training, and as a result, these new units were not led as well as they could have been. Austrian cavalry forces were regarded as the best in Europe, but the detachment of many cavalry units to various infantry formations precluded the hitting power of their massed French counterparts.

==Ulm campaign==
In August 1805, Napoleon, Emperor of the French since May of the previous year, turned his army&#x27;s sights from the English Channel to the Rhine in order to deal with the new Austrian and Russian threats. The War of the Third Coalition began with the Ulm Campaign, a series of French and Bavarian military manoeuvres and battles designed to outflank an Austrian army under General Mack.

===Austrian plans and preparations===
General Mack thought that Austrian security relied on sealing off the gaps through the mountainous Black Forest area in Southern Germany that had witnessed much fighting during the campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars. Mack believed that there would be no action in Central Germany. Mack decided to make the city of Ulm the centrepiece of his defensive strategy, which called for containment of the French until the Russians under Mikhail Kutuzov could arrive and alter the odds against Napoleon. Ulm was protected by the heavily fortified Michelsberg heights, giving Mack the impression that the city was virtually impregnable from outside attack.

Fatally, the Aulic Council decided to make Northern Italy the main theatre of operations for the Austrian army. Archduke Charles was assigned 95,000 troops and directed to cross the Adige river with Mantua, Peschiera, and Milan as the initial objectives.Archduke John was given 23,000 troops and commanded to secure Tyrol while serving as a link between his brother, Charles, and his cousin, Archduke Ferdinand; the latter&#x27;s force of 72,000, which was to invade Bavaria and hold the defensive line at Ulm, was effectively controlled by Mack.The Austrians also detached individual corps to serve with the Swedish in Pomerania and the British in Naples, though these were designed to obfuscate the French and divert their resources.

===French plans and preparations===

In both the campaigns of 1796 and 1800, Napoleon had envisaged the Danube theatre as the central focus of French efforts, but in both instances, the Italian theatre became the most important. The Aulic Council thought Napoleon would strike in Italy again. Napoleon had other intentions: 210,000 French troops would be launched eastwards from the camps of Boulogne and would envelop General Mack&#x27;s exposed Austrian army if it kept marching towards the Black Forest.

Meanwhile, Marshal Murat would conduct cavalry screens across the Black Forest to fool the Austrians into thinking that the French were advancing on a direct west–east axis. The main attack in Germany would be supported by French assaults in other theatres: Marshal Masséna would confront Archduke Charles in Italy with 50,000 men, Marshal St. Cyr would march to Naples with 20,000 men, and Marshal Brune would patrol Boulogne with 30,000 troops against a possible British invasion.

Marshal Joachim Murat and General Bertrand conducted reconnaissance between the area bordering the Tyrol and the Main as General Savary, chief of the planning staff, drew up detailed road surveys of the areas between the Rhine and the Danube. The left-wing of the would move from Hanover and Utrecht to fall on Württemberg; the right and centre, troops from the Channel coast, would concentrate along the Middle Rhine around cities like Mannheim and Strasbourg. While Murat was making demonstrations across the Black Forest, other French forces would then invade the German heartland and swing towards the southeast by capturing Augsburg, a move that was supposed to isolate Mack and interrupt the Austrian lines of communication.

===The French invasion===

On 22 September, Mack decided to hold the Iller line anchored on Ulm. In the last three days of September, the French began the furious marches that would find them at the Austrian rear. Mack believed that the French would not violate Prussian territory, but when he heard that Bernadotte&#x27;s I Corps had marched through Prussian Ansbach, he made the critical decision to stay and defend Ulm rather than retreat to the south, which would have offered a reasonable opportunity at saving the bulk of his forces. Napoleon had little accurate information about Mack&#x27;s intentions or manoeuvres. He knew that Kienmayer&#x27;s Corps was sent to Ingolstadt east of the French positions, but his agents greatly exaggerated its size.

On 5 October, Napoleon ordered Marshal Ney to join Marshals Lannes, Soult, and Murat in concentrating and crossing the Danube at Donauwörth. The French encirclement was not deep enough to prevent Kienmayer&#x27;s escape: the French corps did not all arrive at the same place – they instead deployed on a long west–east axis – and the early arrival of Soult and Davout at Donauwörth incited Kienmayer to exercise caution and evasion.Napoleon gradually became more convinced that the Austrians were massed at Ulm and ordered sizeable portions of the French army to concentrate around Donauwörth; on 6 October, three French infantry and cavalry corps headed to Donauwörth to seal off Mack&#x27;s escape route.

===Battle of Wertingen===
Realizing the danger of his position, Mack decided to go on the offensive. On 8 October, he commanded the army to concentrate around Günzburg and hoped to strike at Napoleon&#x27;s lines of communication. Mack instructed Kienmayer to draw Napoleon further east towards Munich and Augsburg. Napoleon did not seriously consider the possibility that Mack would cross the Danube and move away from his central base, but he did realize that seizing the bridges at Günzburg would yield a large strategic advantage. To accomplish this objective, Napoleon sent Ney&#x27;s Corps to Günzburg, completely unaware that the bulk of the Austrian army was heading to the same destination. On 8 October, however, the campaign witnessed its first serious battle at Wertingen between Auffenburg&#x27;s troops and those of Murat and Lannes.

For reasons not entirely clear, Mack ordered Auffenburg on 7 October to take his division of 5,000 infantry and 400 cavalry from Günzburg to Wertingen in preparation for the main Austrian advance out of Ulm. Uncertain of what to do and having little hope for reinforcements, Auffenburg was in a dangerous position. The first French forces to arrive were Murat&#x27;s cavalry divisions – Klein&#x27;s 1st Dragoons, Beaumont 3rd Dragoons, and Nansouty&#x27;s cuirassiers. They began to assault the Austrian positions and were soon joined by Oudinot&#x27;s grenadiers, who were hoping to outflank the Austrians from the north and west. Auffenburg attempted a retreat to the southwest, but he was not quick enough: the Austrians were decimated, losing nearly their entire force, 1,000 to 2,000 of which were prisoners. The Battle of Wertingen had been an easy French victory.

The actions at Wertingen convinced Mack to operate on the left bank of the Danube instead of making a direct eastwards retreat on the right bank. This would require the Austrian army to cross at Günzburg. On 8 October, Ney was operating under Marshal Berthier&#x27;s directions that called for a direct attack on Ulm the following day. Ney sent in Malher&#x27;s 3rd Division to capture the Günzburg bridges over the Danube. A column of this division ran into some Tyrolean jägers and captured 200 of them, including their commander General d&#x27;Aspré, along with two cannons.

The Austrians noticed these developments and reinforced their positions around Günzburg with three infantry battalions and 20 cannons. Malher&#x27;s division conducted several heroic attacks against the Austrian positions, but all failed. Mack then sent in Ignác Gyulay with seven infantry battalions and fourteen cavalry squadrons to repair the destroyed bridges, but this force was charged and swept away by the delayed French 59th Infantry Regiment.

Fierce fighting ensued and the French finally managed to establish a foothold on the right bank of the Danube. While the Battle of Günzburg was being fought, Ney sent General Loison&#x27;s 2nd Division to capture the Danube bridges at Elchingen, which were lightly defended by the Austrians. Having lost most of the Danube bridges, Mack marched his army back to Ulm. By 10 October, Ney&#x27;s corps had made significant progress: Malher&#x27;s division had crossed to the right bank, Loison&#x27;s division held Elchingen, and Dupont&#x27;s division was heading towards Ulm.

===Haslach-Jungingen and Elchingen===

The demoralized Austrian army arrived at Ulm in the early hours of 10 October. Mack was deliberating about a course of action to pursue and the Austrian army remained inactive at Ulm until the 11th. Meanwhile, Napoleon was operating under flawed assumptions: he believed the Austrians were moving to the east or southeast and that Ulm was lightly guarded. Ney sensed this misapprehension and wrote to Berthier that Ulm was, in fact, more heavily defended than the French originally thought. During this time, the Russian threat to the east began to preoccupy Napoleon so much that Murat was given command of the right wing of the army, consisting of Ney&#x27;s and Lannes&#x27;s corps. The French were separated in two massive rings at this point: the forces of Ney, Lannes and Murat to the west were containing Mack, while those of Soult, Davout, Bernadotte and Marmont to the east were charged with guarding against any possible Russian and Austrian incursions. On 11 October, Ney made a renewed push on Ulm; the 2nd and 3rd divisions were to march to the city along the right bank of the Danube while Dupont&#x27;s division, supported by one dragoons division, was to march directly for Ulm and seize the entire city. The orders were hopeless because Ney still did not know that the entire Austrian army was stationed at Ulm.

The 32nd Infantry Regiment in Dupont&#x27;s division marched from Haslach towards Ulm and ran into four Austrian regiments holding Bolfingen. The 32nd carried out several ferocious attacks, but the Austrians held firm and repulsed every single one of them. The Austrians flooded the battle with more cavalry and infantry regiments to Jungingen hoping to score a knockout blow against Ney&#x27;s corps by enveloping Dupont&#x27;s force. Dupont sensed what was happening and preempted the Austrians by launching a surprise attack on Jungingen that captured at least 1,000 prisoners. Renewed Austrian attacks drove these forces back to Haslach, which the French managed to hold. Dupont was eventually forced to fall back on Albeck, where he joined d&#x27;Hilliers&#x27;s troops. The effects of the Battle of Haslach-Jungingen on Napoleon&#x27;s plans are not fully clear, but the Emperor may have finally ascertained that the majority of the Austrian army was concentrated at Ulm. Accordingly, Napoleon sent the corps of Soult and Marmont towards the Iller, meaning he now had four infantry and one cavalry corps to deal with Mack; Davout, Bernadotte, and the Bavarians were still guarding the region around Munich. Napoleon did not intend to fight a battle across rivers and ordered his marshals to capture the important bridges around Ulm. He also began shifting his forces to the north of Ulm because he expected a battle in that region rather than an encirclement of the city itself. These dispositions and actions would lead to a confrontation at Elchingen on the 14th as Ney&#x27;s forces advanced on Albeck.

At this point in the campaign, the Austrian command staff was in full confusion. Ferdinand began to openly oppose Mack&#x27;s command style and decisions, charging that the latter spent his days writing contradictory orders that left the Austrian army marching back and forth. On 13 October, Mack sent two columns out of Ulm in preparation for a breakout to the north: one under General Johann Sigismund Riesch headed towards Elchingen to secure the bridge there and the other under Franz von Werneck went north with most of the heavy artillery. Ney hurried his corps forward to reestablish contact with Dupont. Ney led his troops to the south of Elchingen on the right bank of the Danube and began the attack. The field to the side was a partially wooded flood plain, rising steeply to the hill town of Elchingen, which had a wide field of view. The French cleared the Austrian pickets and a regiment boldly attacked and captured the abbey at the top of the hill at bayonet point. The Austrian cavalry was also defeated and Riesch&#x27;s infantry fled; Ney was given the title &quot;Duke of Elchingen&quot; for his impressive victory.

===Battle of Ulm===

Other actions took place on the 14th. Murat&#x27;s forces joined Dupont at Albeck just in time to drive off an Austrian attack from Werneck; together Murat and Dupont beat the Austrians to the north in the direction of Heidenheim. By night on the 14th, two French corps were stationed in the vicinity of the Austrian encampments at Michelsberg, right outside of Ulm. Mack was now in a dangerous situation: there was no longer any hope of escaping along the north bank, Marmont and the Imperial Guard were hovering at the outskirts of Ulm to the south of the river, and Soult was moving from Memmingen to prevent the Austrians escaping south to the Tyrol. Troubles continued with the Austrian command as Ferdinand overrode the objections of Mack and ordered the evacuation of all cavalry from Ulm, a total of 6,000 troopers. Murat&#x27;s pursuit was so effective, however, that only eleven squadrons joined Werneck at Heidenheim. Murat continued his harassment of Werneck and forced him to surrender with 8,000 men at Trochtelfingten on 19 October; Murat also took an entire Austrian field park of 500 vehicles, then swept on towards Neustadt and captured 12,000 Austrians.

Events at Ulm were now reaching a conclusion. On 15 October, Ney&#x27;s troops successfully charged the Michelsberg encampments and on the 16th the French began to bombard Ulm itself. Austrian morale was at a low point and Mack began to realize that there was little hope of rescue. On 17 October, Napoleon&#x27;s emissary, Ségur, signed a convention with Mack in which the Austrians agreed to surrender on 25 October if no aid came by that date. Gradually, however, Mack heard of the capitulations at Heidenheim and Neresheim and agreed to surrender five days before schedule on 20 October. 10,000 troops from the Austrian garrison managed to escape, but the vast majority of the Austrian force marched out on the 21st and laid down their arms without incident, all with the drawn up in a vast semicircle observing the capitulation.

==Battle of Trafalgar==

==Battle of Austerlitz==

===Preliminaries===
The main body of the followed the remains of the Austrian army towards Vienna. Following the failure of the Austrian army at Ulm, a Russian army under General Mikhail Kutuzov was also withdrawing east, and reached the Ill river on 22 October, where it joined with Kienmayer&#x27;s retreating corps. On 5 November, they held a successful rearguard action in Amstetten. On 7 November, the Russians arrived in St. Pölten, and then moved across the Danube river the next day. Late on 9 November, they destroyed the bridges across the Danube, holding the last one, at Stein, near Krems, until the late afternoon.

The following day, Marshal Mortier ordered General Gazan to attack what they believed to be a Russian rear guard, at the village of Stein. This was a trap on the part of Kutuzov, laid for the sole purpose of convincing Mortier that he had retreated further toward Vienna, when he had actually crossed the Danube in force, and lay concealed behind the ridges above the village. In the ensuing Battle of Dürenstein, three Russian columns circled around the First Division of the &quot;Corps Mortier&quot;, and attacked Gazan from both the front and the rear. Not until Dupont&#x27;s division arrived, after dark, was Gazan able to start to evacuate his soldiers to the other side of the Danube. Gazan lost close to 40 percent of his division. In addition, 47 officers and 895 men were captured, and he lost five guns, as well as the eagles of the 4th Infantry Regiment, and the eagle and guidon of the 4th Dragoons. The Russians also lost around 4,000, about 16 percent of their force, and two regimental colors. The Austrian Lt. Field Marshal Johann Heinrich von Schmitt was killed as the battle concluded, probably by Russian musketry in the confused melee.

At the Battle of Schöngrabern (also known as the Battle of Hollabrunn) occurred a week after the battle at Dürenstein. On 16 November 1805. near Hollabrunn in Lower Austria. The Russian army of Kutuzov was retiring north of the Danube before the French army of Napoleon.

On 13 November 1805 Marshals Murat and Lannes, commanding the French advance guard, had captured a bridge over the Danube at Vienna by falsely claiming that an armistice had been signed, and then rushing the bridge while the guards were distracted. Kutuzov needed to gain time in order to make contact near Brünn with reinforcements led by Buxhowden. He ordered his rearguard under Major-General Prince Pyotr Bagration to delay the French.

After Hollabrun, the armies gathered on the plains to the east of Brünn. Napoleon could muster some 75,000 men and 157 guns for the impending battle, but about 7,000 troops under Davout were still far to the south in the direction of Vienna. The Allies had about 73,000 soldiers, seventy percent of them Russian, and 318 guns. On 1 December, both sides occupied their main positions.

===Battlefield===
The northern part of the battlefield was dominated by the Santon hill and the Zuran hill, both overlooking the vital Olmutz-Brno road that ran across a west–east axis. To the west of these two hills was the village of Bellowitz, and between them the Bosenitz Stream went south to link up with the Goldbach Stream, the latter flowing astride the villages of Kobelnitz, Sokolnitz, and Telnitz. The centerpiece of the entire area were the Pratzen Heights, a gently sloped hill about in height. An aide noted that the Emperor repeatedly told his Marshals, &quot;Gentlemen, examine this ground carefully, it is going to be a battlefield; you will have a part to play upon it&quot;.

===Allied plans and dispositions===

An Allied council met on 1 December to discuss proposals for the battle. Most of the Allied strategists had two fundamental ideas in mind: making contact with the enemy and securing the southern flank that led to Vienna. Although the Tsar and his immediate entourage pushed hard for a battle, Emperor Francis of Austria was in a more cautious mood, and he was seconded by Kutuzov, the main Russian commander. The pressure to fight from the Russian nobles and the Austrian commanders, however, was too strong, and the Allies adopted Austrian Chief of Staff Franz von Weyrother&#x27;s plan. This called for a main drive against the French right flank, which the Allies noticed was lightly guarded, and diversionary attacks against the French left. The Allies deployed most of their troops into four columns that would attack the French right. The Russian Imperial Guard was held in reserve while Russian troops under Bagration guarded the Allied right.

===French plans and dispositions===
Days before any actual fighting, Napoleon had given an impression to the Allies that his army was in a weak state and that he desired a negotiated peace. In reality, he was hoping that they would attack, and to encourage them on this mission he deliberately weakened his right flank. On 28 November, Napoleon met with his marshals at Imperial Headquarters and they informed him of their qualms and fears about the upcoming battle, even suggesting a retreat, but he shrugged off their complaints and went to work. Napoleon&#x27;s plan envisioned that the Allies would throw so many troops to envelop his right flank that their centre would be severely weakened. He then counted on a massive French thrust, to be conducted by 16,000 troops of Soult&#x27;s IV Corps, through the centre to cripple the Allied army. Meanwhile, to support his weak right flank, Napoleon ordered Davout&#x27;s III Corps to force march all the way from Vienna and join General Legrand&#x27;s men, who held the extreme southern flank that would bear the heavy part of the Allied attack. Davout&#x27;s soldiers had 48 hours to March . Their arrival would be extremely crucial in determining the success or failure of the French plan. The Imperial Guard and Bernadotte&#x27;s I Corps were held in reserve while the V Corps under Lannes guarded the northern sector of the battle.

===Battle is joined===
The battle began around 8 a.m. with the first allied column attacking the village of Telnitz, which was defended by the 3rd Line Regiment. This sector of the battlefield witnessed heavy action in the following moments as several ferocious Allied charges evicted the French from the town and forced them on the other side of the Goldbach. The first men of Davout&#x27;s corps arrived at this time and threw the Allies out of Telnitz before they too were attacked by hussars and re-abandoned the town. Additional Allied attacks out of Telnitz were checked by French artillery.
Allied columns started pouring against the French right, but not at the desired speed, so the French were mostly successful in curbing the attacks. In reality, the Allied deployments were mistaken and poorly timed: cavalry detachments under Liechtenstein on the Allied left flank had to be placed in the right flank and in the process they ran into and slowed down part of the second column of infantry that was advancing towards the French right. At the time, the planners thought this was a disaster, but later on it helped the Allies. Meanwhile, the lead elements of the second column were attacking the village of Sokolnitz, which was defended by the 26th Light Regiment and the &quot;Tirailleurs&quot;, French skirmishers. Initial Allied assaults proved unsuccessful and General Langeron ordered the bombardment of the village. This deadly barrage forced the French out, and around the same time, the third column attacked the castle of Sokolnitz. The French, however, counterattacked and regained the village, only to be thrown out again. Conflict in this area ended momentarily when Friant&#x27;s division (part of III Corps) retook the village. Sokolnitz was perhaps the most fought over area in the battlefield and would change hands several times as the day progressed.

===&quot;One sharp blow and the war is over&quot;===

Around 8:45 a.m., finally satisfied at the weakness in the enemy centre, Napoleon asked Soult how long it would take for his men to reach the Pratzen Heights, to which the Marshal replied, &quot;Less than twenty minutes, sire.&quot; About 15 minutes later, Napoleon ordered the attack, adding, &quot;One sharp blow and the war is over.&quot;

A dense fog helped to cloud the advance of St. Hilaire&#x27;s division, but as they went up the slope the legendary &#x27;Sun of Austerlitz&#x27; ripped the mist apart and encouraged them forward.Russian soldiers and commanders on top of the heights were stunned to see so many French troops coming towards them. Allied commanders were now able to feed some of the delayed detachments of the fourth column into this bitter struggle. Over an hour of horrendous fighting left much of this unit decimated beyond recognition. The other men from the second column, mostly inexperienced Austrians, also participated in the struggle and swung the numbers game against one of the best fighting forces in the French army, finally forcing them to withdraw down the slopes. However, gripped by desperation, St. Hilaire&#x27;s men struck hard once more and bayoneted the Allies out of the heights. To the north, General Vandamme&#x27;s division attacked an area called Staré Vinohrady and through talented skirmishing and deadly volleys broke several Allied battalions.

The battle had firmly turned to France&#x27;s favor, but there was still much fighting ahead. Napoleon ordered Bernadotte&#x27;s I Corps to support Vandamme&#x27;s left and moved his own command centre from Zuran Hill to St. Anthony&#x27;s Chapel on the Pratzen Heights. The difficult position of the Allies was confirmed by the decision to send in the Russian Imperial Guard; Grand Duke Constantine, Tsar Alexander&#x27;s brother, commanded the Guard and counterattacked in Vandamme&#x27;s section of the field, forcing a bloody effort and the loss of the only French standard in the battle (the unfortunate victim was a battalion of the 4th Line Regiment). Sensing trouble, Napoleon ordered his own heavy Guard cavalry forward. These men pulverized their Russian counterparts, but with both sides pouring in large masses of cavalry no victor was clear yet. The Russians had a numerical advantage here but fairly soon the tide swung as d&#x27;Erlon&#x27;s Division, the 2nd of Bernadotte&#x27;s I Corps, deployed on the flank of the action and allowed French cavalry to seek refuge behind their lines. The horse artillery of the Guard also unlimbered a deadly toll on the Russian cavalry and fusiliers. The Russians broke and many died as they were pursued by the reinvigorated French cavalry for about a quarter of a mile.

===Endgame===

Meanwhile, the northernmost part of the battlefield was also witnessing heavy fighting. Prince Liechtenstein&#x27;s heavy cavalry began to assault Kellerman&#x27;s lighter cavalry forces after finally arriving at the correct position in the field. The fighting originally went well for the French, but Kellerman&#x27;s forces took cover behind General Caffarelli&#x27;s infantry division once it became clear Russian numbers were too great. Caffarelli&#x27;s men halted the Russian assaults and permitted Murat to send two cuirassier divisions into the fray to finish off the Russian cavalry for good. The ensuing melee was bitter and long, but the French ultimately prevailed. Lannes then led his V Corps against Bagration&#x27;s men and after hard fighting managed to drive the skilled Russian commander off the field. He wanted to pursue, but Murat, who was in control of this sector in the battlefield, was against the idea.

Napoleon&#x27;s focus now shifted towards the southern end of the battlefield where the French and the Allies were still fighting over Sokolnitz and Telnitz. In an effective double-pronged assault, St. Hilaire&#x27;s division and part of Davout&#x27;s III Corps smashed through the enemy at Sokolnitz and persuaded the commanders of the first two columns, generals Kienmayer and Langeron, to flee as fast as they could. Buxhowden, the commander of the Allied left and the man responsible for leading the attack, was completely drunk and fled as well. Kienmayer covered his withdrawal with the O&#x27;Reilly light cavalry, who gallantly managed to defeat five of six French cavalry regiments before they too had to retreat.

General panic now seized the Allied army and it abandoned the field in any and all possible directions. Russian forces that had been defeated by the French right withdrew south towards Vienna via the Satschan frozen ponds. According to popular myth, the French artillery pounded towards the men, but Napoleon redirected his gunners to fire at the ice. The men drowned in the viciously cold ponds, dozens of artillery pieces going down along with them. Estimates on how many guns were captured differ; there may have been as few as 38 or as many as over 100. Sources also differ on casualties, with figures ranging from as few as 200 to as many as 2,000 dead. Because Napoleon exaggerated this incident in his report of the battle, the low numbers may be more accurate, although doubt remains as to whether they are fully correct. Many regard this incident as one of Napoleon&#x27;s cruelest acts in war. However, only a few bodies are reported to have been found in the spring of 1806, and it is most likely the incident is a myth.

== Italian Campaigns ==
=== Venetian front or Italian campaign of 1805 ===
Meanwhile, in Italy, the Austrian &quot;Armee von Italien&quot; under Archduke Charles fought against the French &quot;Armée d&#x27;italie&quot; under Marshal Masséna. The French managed to gain a bridgehead over the Adige river at Verona on 18 October, and finally, between 29 and 31 October, the outnumbered French defeated the superior Austrian army in the Battle of Caldiero. In November the Austrians retreated, engaging the French vanguard of d&#x27;Espagne in several rear-guard actions. Venice was blockaded by French and Italian troops under St.Cyr. Charles&#x27; army finally crossed the Isonzo on 14 November, preventing the French from crossing it.

One 4,400-strong Habsburg army that lingered behind, was roundly defeated and captured by Jean Reynier and St. Cyr at the Battle of Castelfranco Veneto on 24 November 1805.

=== Anglo-Russian occupation of Naples ===

The French force under St. Cyr then manoeuvred on the frontier of the Kingdom of Naples. The French were being carefully watched by an Anglo-Russian force entrusted with defence of the kingdom. After the Battle of Austerlitz, the Russians withdrew from Italy and the British, unwilling to defend Naples alone, evacuated the mainland altogether and retreated back to Sicily. Meanwhile, the French force, now stationed in Bologna, was reorganised into the Army of Naples and placed under the nominal command of Napoleon&#x27;s brother Joseph Bonaparte. However, the de facto commander was André Masséna, who commanded the I Corps and was entrusted with the invasion by Joseph.

=== French invasion of Naples ===

On 9 February 1806, Masséna invaded the Kingdom of Naples and two days later, the Bourbon King of Naples, Ferdinand IV also fled to Sicily, protected by the British fleet. Naples soon fell into French hands and by the end of February, only two places in the kingdom still held out. One was the fortress city of Gaeta, north of Naples, and the other was Calabria in the very south of Italy, which was where the remainder of the Royal Neapolitan Army was stationed.

Ferdinand had hoped for a repeat of the events of 1799, when a popular uprising in Calabria eventually caused the downfall of the Parthenopaean Republic, a French client state created after the Neapolitans were defeated the first time during the War of the Second Coalition. However, no such rebellion initially occurred and on 3 March, General Jean Reynier, who commanded the 10,000 strong II Corps of the Army of Naples invaded Calabria. Only a few Calabrians resisted the invading French force and the Royal Neapolitan Army was soundly defeated at the Battle of Campo Tenese on 10 March 1806. Ferdinand now had no choice but to concede the Neapolitan throne to the French. A day after Campo Tenese, Joseph was installed as the new King of Naples. By now, the last regular troops of the Neapolitan army had fled to Sicily and the French controlled the entire Italian mainland except for the fortress of Gaeta, which had been under siege since 26 February. Gaeta surrendered on 18 July, concluding the invasion with a decisive French victory.

=== Calabrian insurrection ===
However, all was not going to plan for the French. Supply problems meant that Reynier&#x27;s II Corps in Calabria was forced to live off the land. For over a month, the peasants of the region had supported the Neapolitan army and were close to starvation. Joseph seemed unaware of the problems and the potential dangers of revolt. Consequently, no extra provisions were sent to the south of Italy. Reynier took the initiative and seized supplies from the local populace, leading predictably to a revolt by the end of March. What started as small bands of partisans eventually expanded into entire villages rising up against the French. With the fortress of Gaeta still holding out, Joseph was unable to send more troops to Calabria, forcing Reynier to reinforce his army with native troops recruited from the larger towns and cities.

By July, Masséna had still failed to take Gaeta due to poor logistical management of the French artillery, slight reinforcements from the British by sea and a series of successful sorties by the Neapolitan garrison against the French sappers. With only Reynier&#x27;s small force in Calabria still struggling against the revolt, the British organised an expeditionary force under Sir John Stuart to prevent any potential invasion of Sicily and perhaps to trigger a full-scale rebellion against the French across Italy. Although there were early successes for the British, in particular at Maida, the British failed to either reinforce Stuart&#x27;s expedition or attempt to relieve the Siege of Gaeta. With the French artillery finally able to bombard the walls with their full potential, the Neapolitans eventually surrendered on 18 July, freeing Masséna&#x27;s I Corps. 

Following the surrender, Masséna was ordered south by Joseph to support Reynier&#x27;s II Corps against the British and the Calabrian insurrection. Now severely outnumbered in mainland Italy, the British retreated back to Sicily. However, the revolt was not suppressed until 1807, by which time Masséna had already requested permission to relinquish command. For the first time in the Napoleonic Wars, the French experienced a brutal guerrilla war carried on by a rebellious population. The French gleaned that the only effective way to deal with such an uprising was to implement terror tactics employed by Reynier. This foreshadowed the same problems the French, and in particular Joseph Bonaparte, would face in Spain during the Peninsular War.

==Results==

Austerlitz and the preceding campaign profoundly altered the nature of European politics. In three months, the French had occupied Vienna, decimated two armies, and humbled the Austrian Empire. These events sharply contrast with the rigid power structures of the 18th century, when no major European capital was ever held by an enemy army. Austerlitz set the stage for a near-decade of French domination on the European continent, but one of its more immediate impacts was to goad Prussia into war in 1806.

France and Austria signed a truce on 4 December and the Treaty of Pressburg 22 days later took the latter out of the war. Austria agreed to recognize French territory captured by the treaties of Campo Formio (1797) and Lunéville (1801), cede land to Bavaria, Württemberg, and Baden, which were Napoleon&#x27;s German allies, and pay 40 million francs in war indemnities. Venetia was also given to the Kingdom of Italy. It was a harsh end for Austria, but certainly not a catastrophic peace. The Russian army was allowed to withdraw to home territory and the French encamped themselves in Southern Germany.

In July 1806, Napoleon created the Confederation of the Rhine, a string of German client states which on becoming allies of France pledged themselves to raise an army of 63,000 men. With Napoleon as their &quot;Protector&quot;, the confederate states were compelled to leave the Holy Roman Empire, which was dissolved shortly afterward.&lt;Prussia saw these and other moves as an affront to its status as the main power of Central Europe and it went to war with France in 1806.

In Italy, the political situation would remain unchanged until 1815, with the British and Sicilian troops guarding the Bourbon King Ferdinand in Sicily and the Napoleonic King of Naples controlling the mainland. In 1808, Joachim Murat became the King of Naples, after Joseph Bonaparte became King of Spain. Murat made various attempts to cross the Strait of Messina, which all ended in failure, despite once managing to secure a foothold in Sicily.

===Casualties and losses===
The French lost 12,000 killed, 22,200 wounded and 5,000 captured in 1805, including 5,300 killed and 22,200 wounded in the Austrian Campaign against the Habsburgs and Russians, 2,100 killed and 5,300 wounded in the Italian Campaign, 4,300 killed and 3,700 wounded in the naval war, 200 killed and 400 wounded in the colonies and 100 killed and 400 wounded in coastal defense duties. The 1806 Naples Campaign cost the French 1,500 killed and 5,000 wounded. The Spanish suffered 1,200 killed and 1,600 wounded in the naval war, Bavaria sustained 300 killed and 1,200 wounded in the Austrian Campaign and the Kingdom of Italy lost 100 killed and 400 wounded in the Italian Campaign and 250 killed and 1,500 wounded in the Naples Campaign.

The Austrians lost 20,000 killed and wounded and 70,000 as prisoners. Russian casualties were 25,000 killed and wounded and 25,000 captured. The Neapolitan army of 22,000 was wiped out by the French in 1806, with only 2,000 evacuated to Sicily.

<text>The Barrymore family, and the related Drew family, form a British-American acting dynasty which traces its acting roots to the mid-19th century London stage.

The surname Barrymore originated with an actor named William Barrymore (c. 1759-1830). The related Drew family traces back to the Irish actor John Drew Sr. (1827-1862).

<text>Hybrid Theory is the debut studio album by American rock band Linkin Park, released on October 24, 2000, by Warner Bros. Records. Recorded at NRG Recordings in North Hollywood, California, and produced by Don Gilmore, the album&#x27;s lyrical themes deal with problems lead vocalist Chester Bennington experienced during his adolescence, including drug abuse and the constant fighting and eventual divorce of his parents. &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; takes its title from the previous name of the band as well as the concepts of music theory and combining different styles. It is also the band&#x27;s only album in which bassist Dave &quot;Phoenix&quot; Farrell does not play, however, he is credited as a member of the band as well as a songwriter on some of its tracks.

Four singles were released from &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;: &quot;One Step Closer&quot;, &quot;In the End&quot;, &quot;Crawling&quot; and &quot;Papercut&quot;, all of them being responsible for launching Linkin Park into mainstream popularity. While &quot;In the End&quot; was the most successful of the four, all of the singles in the album remain some of the band&#x27;s most successful songs to date. Although &quot;Runaway&quot;, &quot;Points of Authority&quot;, and &quot;My December&quot; from the special edition bonus disc album were not released as singles, they were minor hits on alternative rock radio stations thanks to the success of all of the band&#x27;s singles and the album.

Generally receiving positive reviews from critics upon its release, &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; became a strong commercial success. Peaking at number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, it is certified 12× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It also reached the top 10 in 15 other countries and has sold 32 million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling debut album since Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27;s &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; (1987). At the 44th Grammy Awards, it won Best Hard Rock Performance for &quot;Crawling&quot;.

On August 13, 2020, Warner Records announced a re-release of &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; for its 20th anniversary. A previously unreleased demo song, &quot;She Couldn&#x27;t&quot;, was released at the same time.

==Background==
High school friends Mike Shinoda, Brad Delson and Rob Bourdon formed the rap rock band Xero in 1996. After their graduation, they recruited Joe Hahn, Dave &quot;Phoenix&quot; Farrell and Mark Wakefield to perform in the band. Though limited in resources, the band began recording and producing songs within Shinoda&#x27;s makeshift bedroom studio in 1996, resulting in a four-track demo album, entitled &quot;Xero&quot;, released in November 1997. Delson, who by that point was a student at UCLA, then introduced the band to Jeff Blue, the vice president of A&amp;R for Zomba Music, whom he had interned for in college. Blue immediately took interest in the band, but this did not produce a record deal. After watching a Xero performance in 1998, he believed the band needed a different vocalist. Frustrated with the lack of label success, Wakefield and Farrell left the band.

Blue was recommended Arizona-based vocalist Chester Bennington, formerly of Grey Daze. Blue called Bennington on March 20, 1999, his 23rd birthday, and sent Bennington tapes of Xero&#x27;s unreleased recordings the following day. One contained vocals by Wakefield, and the other consisted of only the instrumental tracks — with Blue asking for Bennington&#x27;s &quot;interpretation of the songs&quot;. Bennington wrote and recorded new vocals over the instrumentals and sent the tapes back to Blue. By March 23, Bennington was in Los Angeles auditioning for Xero. The band auditioned numerous people for the vocalist job, with Shinoda later admitting the group&#x27;s visual impression of Bennington initially led to concerns about his image, though Bennington clearly was the best performer among the candidates. As Delson recalls, &quot;[Bennington] really was kind of the final piece of the puzzle [...] We didn&#x27;t see anything close to his talent in anybody else.&quot;

After Bennington officially got the job, the five members renamed the band Hybrid Theory. Bassist Kyle Christner was then recruited on a temporary basis; with these members, the group released a self-titled EP. Through a street team, the EP was mainly promoted through internet chat-rooms and forums. In October 1999, Christner left the group. The vacancy was filled by Scott Koziol and Ian Hornbeck, who alongside Delson all contributed bass tracks for the band&#x27;s recordings. Still unsigned, the band once again turned to Blue, who by that point had left Zomba and had become vice president of Warner Bros. Records; by November 1999, the band had been signed to a contract. The band changed their name again, deciding on &quot;Linkin Park&quot;.

==Writing and recording==
The music that would ultimately become the &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; album was first produced by Linkin Park in 1999 as a nine-track demo tape. The band sent this tape to various recording companies and played forty-two different showcases for recording industry representatives, including performances for Los Angeles promoter and impresario, Mike Galaxy&#x27;s showcase at The Gig on Melrose. However, they were initially turned down by most of the major labels and several independent record labels. The band was signed by Warner Bros. Records in 1999, due in large part to the constant recommendations of Blue, who had joined the label after resigning from Zomba.

Despite initial difficulties in finding a producer willing to take charge of the debut album of a newly signed band, Don Gilmore ultimately agreed to head up the project, with Andy Wallace hired as the mixer. Recording sessions, which mostly involved re-recording the songs off the demo tape, began at NRG Recordings in North Hollywood, California in March 2000 and lasted four months. Shinoda&#x27;s rapping sections in most of the songs were significantly altered from the original, while most choruses remained largely unchanged. Due to the absence of Dave Farrell and Kyle Christner, who took part in the 1999 extended play, the band hired Scott Koziol and Ian Hornbeck as stand-in bassists; Delson also played bass throughout most of the album. The Dust Brothers provided additional beats for the track &quot;With You&quot;.

Bennington and Shinoda wrote the lyrics of &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; based in part on early demos with Mark Wakefield. Shinoda characterized the lyrics as interpretations of universal feelings, emotions, and experiences, and as &quot;everyday emotions you talk about and think about.&quot; Bennington later described the songwriting experience to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in early 2002:

==Composition==
The music of &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; draws from diverse inspirations. Bennington&#x27;s singing style is influenced by acts such as Depeche Mode and Stone Temple Pilots, while the riffs and playing techniques of guitarist Brad Delson are modeled after Deftones, Guns N&#x27; Roses, U2, and The Smiths. The lyrical content of the songs primarily touches upon the problems that Bennington encountered during his childhood, including constant and excessive drug and alcohol abuse, the divorce of his parents, isolation, disappointments, and the aftermath feelings of failed relationships. Stylistically, the album has been described as nu metal, rap metal, rap rock, alternative metal, alternative rock, and hard rock.

The album eventually produced four singles. &quot;One Step Closer&quot;, the album&#x27;s second track and first single, was gradually recorded in increments after Linkin Park struggled with &quot;Runaway&quot;, and features a guitar riff and electronic percussion in the introduction transitioning into a bridge with distortion-heavy guitars and aggressive drums. It is also famous for the &quot;Shut up when I&#x27;m talkin&#x27; to you!&quot; refrain screamed by Bennington one minute and 48 seconds into the song. The music video for &quot;One Step Closer&quot; was shot in a Los Angeles subway and became an instant hit, eventually receiving heavy rotation on MTV and other music television networks. Stand-in bassist Scott Koziol is shown performing with the band in the video.
The second single was &quot;Crawling&quot;, which Bennington described as &quot;about feeling like I had no control over myself in terms of drugs and alcohol.&quot;

&quot;Papercut&quot; was the album&#x27;s third single, and its lyrics describe paranoia. The music video for &quot;Papercut&quot; features the band performing in a hallway opposite a completely dark room on the walls of which are scribbled the song&#x27;s lyrics. Various supernatural themes are present in the video, and special effects are used to create eerie renditions, such as the &quot;stretching&quot; of Shinoda&#x27;s fingers and the &quot;melting&quot; of Bourdon&#x27;s face.

The fourth and final single to come from &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; was &quot;In the End&quot;, released on October 9, 2001. The song prominently features a signature piano riff performed by Shinoda. His rapping also dominates the verses of the song and is later joined by Bennington&#x27;s vocals in the chorus. The music video for &quot;In the End&quot; was shot at various stops along the 2001 Ozzfest tour and was directed by Nathan &quot;Karma&quot; Cox and the band&#x27;s DJ Joe Hahn, who would go on to direct many of Linkin Park&#x27;s future videos (the two also directed the music video for &quot;Papercut&quot;). Although the background for the &quot;In the End&quot; video was filmed in a California desert, the band itself performed on a studio stage in Los Angeles, with prominent CGI effects and compositing being used to create the finished version. Performing on a studio stage allowed Hahn and Cox to set off water pipes above the stage near the end and drench the band.
The music video won the Best Rock Video award at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards.

&quot;Points of Authority&quot;, the fourth track on the album, has its own music video that can be found on&quot; Frat Party at the Pankake Festival&quot;, the band&#x27;s first DVD. Drummer Rob Bourdon describes the recording process of the song: &quot;Brad wrote this riff, then went home. Mike decided to cut it up into different pieces and rearranged them on the computer [...] Brad had to learn his own part from the computer.&quot; Regarding the song, Delson praised Shinoda&#x27;s skill, describing him as &quot;a genius&quot; and &quot;Trent Reznor-talented&quot;.

==Artwork==
With &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; being Linkin Park&#x27;s first album, Mike Shinoda, who had worked as a graphic designer before becoming a professional musician, has stated that the band had looked through books for inspiration on how to present themselves for the first time. The result was a winged-soldier which Shinoda illustrated himself. According to Chester Bennington, the idea of the soldier with dragonfly wings was to describe the blending of hard and soft musical elements by the use of the jaded looks of the soldier and frail touches of the wings. The art style was largely influenced by stencil graffiti, including early works by Banksy. The cover also features scrambled lyrics of the album&#x27;s songs within the background, though the lyrics of &quot;One Step Closer&quot; are the most prominent.

==Tours==
Following the success of &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;, Linkin Park received invitations to perform at various rock concerts and tours, including Ozzfest, the Family Values Tour, KROQ-FM&#x27;s Almost Acoustic Christmas, and the band&#x27;s self-created tour, Projekt Revolution, which was headlined by Linkin Park and featured other bands such as Cypress Hill and Adema. During this time, Linkin Park reunited with their original bassist, Dave &quot;Phoenix&quot; Farrell. The band kept an online journal on their official website throughout their 2001 and 2002 touring regime, in which each band member made a respective notation. Although the notes are no longer on their website, they are available on fansites. Linkin Park played 324 shows in 2001.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
&quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. Mike Ross of Jam! praised the album as an effective fusion of hip hop and heavy metal music and deemed Linkin Park &quot;one of the finest new rap metal bands&quot;. &quot;PopMatters&quot; reviewer Stephanie Dickison wrote that they are &quot;a far more complex and talented group than the hard rock boy bands of late&quot; and &quot;will continue to fascinate and challenge music&#x27;s standard sounds.&quot; In &quot;Q&quot;, Dan Silver commented that the band had given &quot;angst-ridden rock... an effective electronic spin&quot;. Johan Wippsson from &quot;Melodic&quot; complimented Don Gilmore&#x27;s production and described &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; as &quot;destructive and angry but always with a well controlled melodic feeling all over.&quot; &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Robert Christgau gave the album a two-star honorable mention rating and cited &quot;Papercut&quot; and &quot;Points of Authority&quot; as highlights; he quipped, &quot;the men don&#x27;t know what the angry boys understand&quot;.

In a more critical assessment, William Ruhlmann of AllMusic found that on &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;, Linkin Park sound &quot;like a Johnny-come-lately to an already overdone musical style.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; critic Noel Gardner said that it was a &quot;decent&quot; album in need of editing, writing that &quot;otherwise damn fine soaring emo-crunchers like &#x27;With You&#x27; and &#x27;A Place for My Head&#x27; are pointlessly jazzed up with tokenistic scratching&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Matt Diehl felt that the album &quot;works in spots&quot; and the band &quot;knows its way around a hook&quot;, but panned Bennington and Shinoda&#x27;s &quot;corny, boilerplate-aggro lyrics&quot;.

Reviewing &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; in 2006, Tyler Fisher of Sputnikmusic perceived a lack of musical variety on the record, but concluded that it &quot;stands as a defining mainstream album at the turn of the century, and for good reason.&quot; Writing for &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; the following year, Ian Cohen found that while the album is &quot;almost completely forgettable&quot; outside of its singles, it &quot;was strangely fresh for mainstream rock radio, particularly placed in relief of its ugly post-grunge peers and the staunch revivalism of the Strokes/White Stripes front.&quot; &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Gabriel Szatan was more enthusiastic in a 2020 review; he wrote that &quot;all the band&#x27;s sharpest tendencies meshed and their less attractive aesthetic impulses were suppressed&quot; on &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;, while crediting the band with helping to normalize discussion of mental health &quot;within pop, rock, rap, and every genre along the heavy axis&quot;. Luke Morton of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; argued that it is &quot;not hyperbolic to say that &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; is one of the most important rock albums of all time.&quot;

===Accolades===
At the 44th Grammy Awards in 2002, Linkin Park won Best Hard Rock Performance for their song &quot;Crawling&quot;. Additional nominations for Best New Artist and Best Rock Album lost out to Alicia Keys and &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot; by U2. &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; found itself in several &quot;must have&quot; lists that were compiled by various music publications, networks, and other media. In 2012, &quot;Rock Sound&quot; named &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; the best modern classic album of the last 15 years. In 2013, &quot;Loudwire&quot; ranked it at No. 10 in its Best Hard Rock Debut Albums list. Some of the more prominent of these lists to feature &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; are shown below:

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; debuted at number 16 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 50,000 copies in its first week. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) five weeks after its release. In 2001, the album had sold 4.8 million copies in the United States, making it the best-selling album of the year, and it was estimated that the album continued selling 100,000 copies per week in early 2002. Throughout the following years, the album continued to sell at a fast pace and was eventually certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2005 for shipment of ten million copies in the United States; in 2017, it was awarded another level of platinum status for a total of 11× Platinum. In 2001 the album was the second best-selling album globally, selling 8.5 million copies. To date, the album has sold 27 million copies worldwide, which makes it the best selling debut album of the 21st century. As of September 2020, the album has been certified 12× Platinum (Diamond) and has sold 10.5 million copies in the United States per Nielsen SoundScan. As of April 2023 the album has sold 13.58 million equivalent album units and 11 million in pure album sales in the US.

After the death of Bennington on July 20, 2017, the album reached number 1 on the iTunes and Amazon music charts. It also re-entered at #27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, along with three of their other studio albums, re-surfacing into the top 10 at #8 the following week. In the UK, it peaked at No. 4 in 2001 and re-climbed to its peak position in July 2017, the same week it re-entered the top 10 in the US. The album also charted in 11 other countries at fairly high positions and ranked among the top ten in the charts of the United Kingdom, Sweden, New Zealand, Austria, Finland, and Switzerland.

&quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; was the 11th best performing album on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 during the decade, the album reached the top ten in its 38th week on the chart and stayed in the top ten for 34 weeks. The album spent nearly 170 weeks on the chart as of 2017, by re-entering at No. 167 in February 2011 and for several weeks every time a new studio album was released.

Later in 2002, Linkin Park released the remix album &quot;Reanimation&quot;. It included the songs of &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; remixed and reinterpreted by nu metal and underground hip hop artists. Contributors to the album included Black Thought, Pharoahe Monch, Jonathan Davis, Stephen Carpenter, and Aaron Lewis. The sound of later Linkin Park albums would involve experimentation with classical instruments such as strings and piano, both of which, along with the same elements of electronica from &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;, are prominently included in the band&#x27;s second studio album &quot;Meteora&quot;. As Shinoda explains the difference in the sound between &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; and &quot;Meteora&quot;: &quot;That electronic element has always been there in the band – it&#x27;s just that sometimes we bring it closer to the front.&quot;

=== Singles ===
According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, as of 2022, &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; is one of the 15 best-performing 21st-century albums without any of its singles being number-one hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; was released in the United States on October 24, 2000, following radio airplay of &quot;One Step Closer&quot;. Four singles from the album were released throughout 2001 (though &quot;Points of Authority&quot; was released as a promotional single), three of which were chart successes on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks charts. The single &quot;In the End&quot; was the highest-charting single from the album, which peaked at No. 1 on the Modern Rock Tracks charts and appearing on charts worldwide. The success of &quot;In the End&quot; was partly responsible for &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;&#x27;s chart success; it reached No. 2 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in 2002.

==20th anniversary edition==
In preparation of the 20th anniversary of the release of the album, the band asked their fans to submit pictures and videos in relation to &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; in celebration of the 20th anniversary. On August 7, the band&#x27;s official website went under a temporary redesign resembling an early 2000s computer theme, leaving behind clues and puzzles hidden within the website hinting at a re-release of the album, including old emails, pictures, and codes. The website was updated frequently leading up to the announcement of the 20th anniversary re-release on August 13; a previously unreleased song, &quot;She Couldn&#x27;t&quot; was released on the same day.

Pre-orders for the album went live with announcement of the contents of its release. It contains various content from the &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; era, including the original album, the band&#x27;s remix album &quot;Reanimation&quot;, &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; EP, and various B-sides, demos, live tracks, and remixes. Most of the tracks have been previously released on singles, extended plays, and via the Linkin Park Underground fan club, while other tracks were released for the first time on this compilation. Various editions of the release were offered, including on CDs and vinyl. It was released on October 9, 2020.

In addition to the music, the super deluxe edition of the release includes additional bonus content including three DVDs, art prints, and an 80-page book which includes never before seen pictures. One of the three DVDs was previously released on November 20, 2001, during the promotion of &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;, documenting the band&#x27;s time on the road, titled &quot;Frat Party at the Pankake Festival&quot;. The other two DVDs were exclusively released for the first time on the super deluxe edition.

A digital counterpart of the compilation was also released, including the music only, containing a total of 80 tracks.

In November 2023, Kyle Christner, who played bass guitar on the &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; EP, filed a lawsuit against Linkin Park, seeking compensation for songs that appeared on the 20th anniversary release of the album. The two parties reached an undisclosed settlement in March 2024.

<text>John Alexander Logan (February 9, 1826 – December 26, 1886) was an American soldier and politician. He served in the Mexican–American War and was a general in the Union Army in the American Civil War. He served the state of Illinois as a state Representative, a U.S. Representative, and a U.S. Senator and was an unsuccessful candidate for Vice President of the United States as James G. Blaine&#x27;s running mate in the election of 1884. As the 3rd Commander-in-Chief of the Grand Army of the Republic, he is regarded as the most important figure in the movement to recognize Memorial Day (originally known as Decoration Day) as an official holiday.

His likeness appears on a statue at the center of Logan Circle, Washington, D.C. He is also honored with a statue in Grant Park in Chicago, Illinois. Memorial Park in Houston, Texas was formerly Camp Logan named after him. He is the honoree of Logan County, Kansas; Logan County, Nebraska; Logan County, Oklahoma; Logan County, Colorado; Logan County, North Dakota; and Logan Square, Chicago, which is the neighborhood chosen to mark Illinois&#x27; centennial. Logan is one of only three people mentioned by name in the Illinois state song. Upon his death, he lay in state in the United States Capitol rotunda. He is the father of U.S. Army officer and Medal of Honor recipient John Alexander Logan Jr. (1865–1899).

==Early life and political career==
John A. Logan was born near what is now Murphysboro, Illinois, the son of Dr. John Logan and Dr. Logan&#x27;s second wife, Elizabeth (Jenkins) Logan. He studied with his father and with a private tutor, then studied for three years at Shiloh College. He enlisted in the 1st Illinois Infantry for the Mexican–American War, and received a commission as a second lieutenant and assignment as the regimental quartermaster.

After the war Logan studied law in the office of his uncle, Alexander M. Jenkins, graduated from the Law Department of the University of Louisville in 1851, and practiced law with success.

John A. Logan entered politics as a Douglas Democrat, was elected county clerk in 1849, served in the Illinois House of Representatives from 1853 to 1854 and in 1857; and for a time, during the interval, was prosecuting attorney of the Third Judicial District of Illinois. In 1858 and 1860, he was elected as a Democrat to the U.S. House of Representatives. In 1853, John A. Logan helped pass a law which prohibited all African Americans, including freedmen, from settling in the state.

==Civil War==

U.S. Representative Logan fought at Bull Run as an unattached volunteer in a Michigan regiment, and then returned to Washington where, before he resigned his congressional seat on April 2, 1862, he entered the Union Army as Colonel of the 31st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment, which he organized. He was known by his soldiers as &quot;Black Jack&quot; because of his black eyes and hair and swarthy complexion, and was regarded as one of the most able officers to enter the army from civilian life. In a time when political generals usually performed poorly in battle, Logan was an exception.

Before resigning his seat, Union Army Colonel Logan served in the army of Ulysses S. Grant in the Western Theater and was present at the Battle of Belmont on November 7, 1861, where his horse was killed, and at Fort Donelson, where he was wounded on February 15, 1862. Soon after the victory at Donelson, he resigned his seat on April 2, 1862, and was promoted to brigadier general in the volunteers, as of March 21, 1862. Major John Hotaling served as his chief of staff. To confuse matters, the 32nd Illinois was commanded at Shiloh by a different Colonel John Logan. During the Siege of Corinth, John A. Logan commanded first a brigade and then the 1st Division of the Army of the Tennessee. In the spring of 1863, he was promoted to major general to rank from November 29, 1862.

In Grant&#x27;s Vicksburg Campaign, Logan commanded the 3rd Division of James B. McPherson&#x27;s XVII Corps, which was the first to enter the city of Vicksburg in July 1863 after its capture. Logan then served as the city&#x27;s military governor. In November 1863 he succeeded William Tecumseh Sherman in command of the XV Corps; and at the Battle of Atlanta (July 22, 1864), after the death of James B. McPherson during the day, he assumed command of the Army of the Tennessee. He was relieved a short time afterward by Oliver O. Howard. He returned to Illinois for the 1864 elections but rejoined the army afterward and commanded his XV corps in Sherman&#x27;s Carolinas Campaign.

In December 1864, Grant became impatient with George H. Thomas&#x27;s apparent unwillingness to attack immediately at Nashville and sent Logan to relieve him. Logan was stopped in Louisville when news came that Thomas had completely smashed John Bell Hood&#x27;s Confederate army in the Battle of Nashville.

Logan had been disappointed when Howard was given permanent command of the Army of the Tennessee after McPherson&#x27;s death, and Sherman arranged for Logan to lead the army during the May 1865 Grand Review in Washington.

==Post-war political career==

After the war, Logan resumed his political career, now as a Republican, and was a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1867 to 1871, and of the United States Senate from 1871 until 1877 and again from 1879 until his death in 1886. After the war, Logan, who had always been a staunch partisan, was identified with the radical wing of the Republican Party. His forceful, passionate speaking, popular on the platform, was less effective in the halls of legislation. In 1868, he was one of the House managers in the impeachment trial of U.S. President Andrew Johnson. One of Logan&#x27;s issues in the Senate was his efforts to stop any action taken to overturn the conviction in the court-martial of Maj. Gen. Fitz John Porter.
He was the second Commander-in-Chief of the Grand Army of the Republic from 1868 to 1871 and helped lead the call for creation of Memorial Day, originally called Decoration Day, as a national public holiday. His war record and his great personal following, especially among members of the Grand Army of the Republic, contributed to his nomination for Vice President in 1884 on the Republican ticket with James G. Blaine. However, they were defeated by the Democratic ticket of Grover Cleveland and Thomas A. Hendricks.

Logan was deeply embittered by the loss. He believed that President Chester A. Arthur’s supporters were disloyal after Arthur lost the Republican nomination. Logan obstructed Arthur’s nomination of journalist William Eleroy Curtis to be Secretary of the Latin American Trade Commission, claiming that Curtis made “damaging disclosures… to the Democratic National Committee.” Curtis threatened to mobilize his press resources against Logan&#x27;s re-election bid. The controversy eventually dissipated. The 1885 US Senate election in Illinois was contentious, and Logan only won after a Democratic representative died and was replaced with a Republican.

=== Credit Mobilier Scandal ===
In September 1872, the New York newspaper &quot;The Sun&quot; reported that many major politicians were bribed by Union Pacific Railroad, and Credit Mobilier. In response to this Congress created the Poland Committee to investigate these accusations. The committee found out that many senators including Logan were involved. In February 1873, the House was convinced that it should share this information with the Senate. The House said to the Senate that these politicians including Logan were possibly involved with the scandal.

Logan explained that he rejected The Credit Mobilier official Oakes Ames first offer, but a few months later Logan accepted Ames offer of 325 dollars. Logan was exonerated by the committee report.

== Death ==

Logan showed signs of illness when the 49th United States Congress opened its first official session on December 7, 1886. By mid-December, Logan&#x27;s arms swelled and his lower limbs were in pain. After several days of intense discomfort, the ailment subsided. He relapsed a few days later and eventually struggled to maintain consciousness. On December 24, Logan&#x27;s doctors conceded that the condition might be fatal. Around three o&#x27;clock in the afternoon on December 26, Logan died at his home in Columbia Heights, Washington, D.C. After his death, Logan&#x27;s body lay in state in the United States Capitol. He was temporarily interred in a vault at Rock Creek Cemetery on December 31, 1886 until he could be reburied in a newly constructed mortuary chapel at the United States Soldiers&#x27; and Airmen&#x27;s Home National Cemetery in Washington on December 26, 1888, the second anniversary of his death.

== Published books ==
Logan was the author of two books on the Civil War. In &quot;The Great Conspiracy: Its Origin and History&quot; (1886), he sought to demonstrate that secession and the Civil War were the result of a long-contemplated &quot;conspiracy&quot; to which various Southern politicians had been party since the Nullification Crisis; he also vindicated the pre-war political positions of Stephen A. Douglas and himself. He also wrote &quot;The Volunteer Soldier of America&quot; (1887). His son, John Alexander Logan Jr., was also an army officer and posthumously received the Medal of Honor for actions during the Philippine–American War. His brother-in-law, Cyrus Thomas, participated in the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871.

Logan was also a member of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States - a military society which was composed of officers who had served in the Union armed forces during the American Civil War.

==Family==
Logan was related to Cornelius Ambrosius Logan (1806–1853), the Irish-American actor and playwright, possibly as a first cousin. John Logan adopted Cornelius&#x27; daughter Kate (1847–1872), probably in 1866. Cornelius&#x27; son Cornelius Ambrose Logan, a physician and diplomat, wrote a memoir of John Logan which was included in his &quot;The Volunteer Soldier of America&quot;.

==Legacy==
The State of Illinois commissioned an equestrian statue of the general that now stands in Chicago&#x27;s Grant Park. Another equestrian statue stands in Logan Circle in Washington, D.C., which gives its name to the surrounding neighborhood. At #4 Logan Circle, a former Logan residence, now called John Logan House, displays a variety of exterior and interior plaques to celebrate Logan&#x27;s achievements as soldier and statesman.

Logan Square, Chicago and Logan Boulevard in Chicago are named after him, as well as Logan Avenue and the neighborhood of Logan Heights (aka Barrio Logan) in San Diego, and the community of Logan Township, New Jersey. His hometown, Murphysboro, Illinois, is home to the General John A Logan Museum, as well as the General John A. Logan Elementary School; and, in nearby Carterville, Illinois, there is the John A. Logan College, a community college. Camp Logan, Illinois, an Illinois National Guard base and rifle range from 1892 to the early 1970s, was also named for him. John A. Logan Elementary School in Washington, DC is also named in his honor.

The United States Army Transport &quot;Logan&quot; was named after him.

Logan is one of only three individuals mentioned by name in the Illinois state song:

* Logan County, Illinois, was named after Logan&#x27;s father, Dr. John Logan, an early pioneer physician. However, Logan County, Kansas was named after General Logan.
* Logan was at one time honored with the naming of a street in Lansing, Michigan. Community activists persuaded the city council to co-rename the street as Martin Luther King Boulevard in 1991. Logan&#x27;s name was dropped completely a few years later. See Capitol Loop#Street name changes
* Logan County, Oklahoma, is named in his honor. The city of Guthrie is the county seat.
* Logan County, Colorado, is named in his honor. The city of Sterling is the county seat.
* Logan County, North Dakota, is named in his honor. The city of Napoleon is the county seat.
* John A. Logan College in Carterville, Illinois is named in his honor.
* Logan Junior High School in Princeton, Illinois is named in his honor.
* Logan High School in La Crosse, Wisconsin is named in his honor.
* The Logan House in Wilmington, Delaware is the oldest Irish Pub in the state and named in his honor.
* Ft. Logan National Cemetery established 1887 in Denver, Colorado is named after him.
* Logan&#x27;s final resting place at the U.S. Soldiers&#x27; and Airmen&#x27;s Home National Cemetery is a granite, Norman-style mausoleum, design by the former supervising architect of the U.S. Treasury Department, Alfred B. Mullett, which houses the remains of General John A. Logan; his wife, Mary S. Logan; daughter, Mary Logan Tucker; and grandsons, Captain Logan Tucker and George E. Tucker.

<doc id="178679" wikidata="Q1025840" url="?curid=178679" title="List of cities and unincorporated communities in Oregon">
<text>This list of cities and unincorporated communities in the U.S. state of Oregon includes all incorporated cities and many unincorporated communities, arranged in alphabetical order. Unincorporated communities are identified with &quot;italic&quot; type.

Cities are the only form of municipal government incorporated in Oregon. While villages and hamlets exist in Oregon, they are created by Clackamas County only, and do not resemble municipalities due to the limited nature of their powers and their lack of home-rule charters.

This list does not distinguish villages, hamlets, and other forms of local organization in Oregon; they are shown below as unincorporated communities and are shown in &quot;italics&quot;. In addition, some formerly freestanding communities have been partially or wholly subsumed by neighboring cities or abandoned and turned into ghost towns; these also are represented in &quot;italics&quot; but are marked an asterisk (*) to distinguish them from unincorporated communities.

<text>Brandon Carl Vedas (April 21, 1981 – January 12, 2003), also known by his nickname ripper on IRC, was an American computer enthusiast, recreational drug user and member of the Shroomery.org community who died of a multiple drug overdose while discussing what he was doing via chat and webcam. His death led to debate about the responsibilities and roles of online communities in life-threatening situations.

== Overview ==

The video chat session began when Vedas logged into the IRC channel and announced &quot;i got a grip of drugs&quot;, inviting other users to access his webcam feed and watch him take them. While some of the substances were illicit, most of them had apparently been obtained through legitimate prescriptions for treatment of various illnesses from which Vedas was said to have suffered.

Vedas then began consuming psilocybe mushrooms, which had been stored in a prescription medication bottle. As the chat session progressed, one of the users in the channel, grphish, noted &quot;that&#x27;s a lot of klonopin&quot; and this is thought to be when Vedas consumed 8 mg of clonazepam. Vedas continued by showing the webcam viewers what would be one of four bottles of methadone that he would consume over the course of the session, and, after noting this on the channel, proceeded to consume an entire bottle (reportedly 80 mg of methadone). After a brief respite, Vedas then consumed 110 mg of propranolol (Inderal), two Vicodin tablets, and 120 mg temazepam, which seem to have been taken in between descriptions given on the IRC channel.

During this process, Vedas maintained that this was &quot;usual weekend behavior&quot; for him and that he had consumed similar quantities of the same substances on previous occasions. &quot;I told u I was hardcore&quot; was one of the last things Vedas typed, and he was found dead by his mother the next day.

<text>Hugo Falcandus was a historian who chronicled the reigns of William I of Sicily and the minority of his son William II in a highly critical work entitled &quot;The History of the Tyrants of Sicily&quot; (or &quot;Liber de Regno Sicilie&quot;). The Latin of the work is polished. There is some doubt as to whether &quot;Hugo Falcandus&quot; is a real name or a pseudonym. Evelyn Jamison argued that he was Eugenius, &quot;amiratus&quot; from 1190. The Frenchman Hugues Foucaud (&quot;Hugo Fulcaudus&quot;), abbot of Saint-Denis, has been proposed as an author. His name, &quot;Falcandus&quot;, is apparently a cacography for &quot;Falcaudus&quot;, Latin for &quot;Foucaud&quot;, a French surname.

The &quot;History&quot; covers the period from the death of Roger II in 1154 to the majority of William II, in 1169. Hugo concentrates on the internal politics of the Palermitan Norman court. Intrigues and scandals are never ignored. He has a low opinion of most of his contemporaries and ascribes villainous intent to next to all actions. Nevertheless, his detailed account is so far above other narratives of like time and place that he cannot on grounds of bias be overlooked. According to Lord Norwich, he &quot;has been compared to Tacitus and Thucydides.&quot;

The first English translation, by G. A. Loud and T. Wiedemann, was published in 1998.

<text>The naira (sign: ₦; code: NGN; , , , ) is the currency of Nigeria. One naira is divided into 100 &quot;kobo&quot;.

The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is the sole issuer of legal tender money throughout the Federal Republic of Nigeria. It controls the volume of money supplied in the economy in order to ensure monetary and price stability. The Currency Operations Department of the CBN is in charge of currency management, through the designs, procurement, distribution and supply, processing, reissue and disposal or disintegration of bank notes and coins.

A major cash crunch occurred in February 2023 when the Nigerian government used a currency note changeover—delivering too few of the new notes into circulation—to attempt to force citizens to use a newly-created government-sponsored central bank digital currency. This led to extensive street protests.

==History==
The history of the currency according to the government.

The naira was introduced on 1 January 1973, replacing the Nigerian pound at a rate of £1 = ₦2. The coins of the new currency were the first coins issued by an independent Nigeria, as all circulating coins of the Nigerian pound were all struck by the colonial government of the Federation of Nigeria in 1959, with the name of Queen Elizabeth II on the obverse. This also made Nigeria the last country in the world to abandon the £sd currency system in favour of a decimal currency system. There was a government plan to redenominate the naira at 100:1 in 2008, but the plan was suspended. The currency sign is .

The name &quot;Naira&quot; was coined from the word &quot;Nigeria&quot; by Obafemi Awolowo. However, Naira as a currency was launched by Shehu Shagari as minister of finance in 1973.

The Central Bank of Nigeria claimed that they attempted to control the annual inflation rate below 10%. In 2011, the CBN increased key interest rate six times, rising from 6.25% to 12%. On 31 January 2012, the CBN decided to maintain the key interest rate at 12%, in order to reduce the impact of inflation due to a reduction in fuel subsidies.

From 20 June 2016, the naira was allowed to float, after being pegged at ₦197 to US$1 for several months. Trade speculated the natural range of the naira would be between ₦280 and ₦350 to the dollar.

In October 2021, the eNaira, the digital version of the state currency, was officially launched in Nigeria by President Muhammadu Buhari.

The 2023 Nigerian currency crisis was precipitated in January 2023 by a shortage of naira cash amid an attempt by the Nigerian government to force citizens to use newly-designed notes, which the government said would help stem the tide of vote-buying in the lead-up to the 2023 general elections. This led to extensive street protests throughout January and February 2023. The country&#x27;s Supreme Court later invalidated the government&#x27;s pronouncement that the previous notes had ceased to become legal tender.

On 14 June 2023, the Naira fell 23% in a day, to a rate of ₦600 to US$1, as the central bank abandoned its currency peg and allowed the naira to trade freely. On 19 July 2023, the Naira fell to a new record low of ₦853 to US$1.

Between the 1st Feb 2024 and the 5th Feb 2024, the currency fell again, more than 50%, from NGN 898 to NGN 1,400, before drifting down to NGN 1,600 as of 30 July 2024 

===Coins===
Nigerian central bank info as of 2022 is in this source:

In 1973, coins were introduced in denominations of , 1, 5, 10 and 25 kobo, with the and 1 kobo in bronze and the higher denominations in cupro-nickel. The kobo coins were minted only that year. In 1991, smaller 1, 10 and 25 kobo coins were issued in copper-plated-steel, along with nickel-plated-steel 50 kobo and ₦1. On 28 February 2007, new coins were issued in denominations of 50 kobo, ₦1 and ₦2, with the ₦1 and ₦2 bimetallic. Some Nigerians expressed concerns over the usability of the ₦2 coin. The deadline for exchanging the old currency was set at 31 May 2007. The central bank stated that the to 25 kobo coins were withdrawn from circulation with effect from 28 February 2007.

===Banknotes of Nigeria ===
On 1 January 1973, the Central Bank of Nigeria introduced notes for 50 kobo, ₦1, ₦5, ₦10 and ₦20: in April 1984, the colors of all naira banknotes were changed in an attempt to control money laundering. In 1991, ₦50 notes were issued, while the 50 kobo and ₦1 notes were replaced by coins in 1991. This was followed by ₦100 in 1999, ₦200 in 2000, ₦500 in 2001 and ₦1,000 on 12 October 2005.

On 28 February 2007, new versions of the ₦5 to ₦50 banknotes were introduced. Originally the ₦10, ₦20 and ₦50 were to be polymer banknotes, but the ₦5, ₦10 and ₦50 were delayed to late 2009 and only the ₦20 was released in polymer. The notes are slightly smaller (130 × 72 mm) and redesigned from the preceding issues. In mid-2009 when Sanusi Lamido Sanusi took over as CBN Governor, The Central Bank of Nigeria changed the ₦5, ₦10 and ₦50 to polymer notes.

On the ₦1,000 notes, there is a subtle shiny strip running down the back of the note to prevent counterfeiting. The strip is a shimmery gold color showing ₦1,000 and has a triangular shape in the middle of the front of the note which changes its color from green to blue when tilted. The main feature on the front is the engraved portraits of Alhaji Aliyu Mai-Bornu and Dr. Clement Isong, both of which are former governors of the Central Bank of Nigeria.

On the first prints of the ₦100 notes issued starting 1 December 1999, Zuma Rock was captioned as located in Federal Capital Territory, while actually it is situated in Niger State. Later prints removed the reference to FCT, ABUJA.

In 2012, the Central Bank of Nigeria was considering the introduction of new currency denominations of ₦5,000. The bank also made plans to convert ₦5, ₦10, ₦20 and ₦50 into coins which are all presently notes.

The Central Bank of Nigeria announced that it would no longer issue banknotes on polymer citing higher costs and environmental issues.

On 12 November 2014, the Central Bank of Nigeria issued a ₦100 commemorative note to celebrate the centennial of Nigeria&#x27;s existence. The notes are similar to its regular issue with the portrait of Chief Obafemi Awolowo on the front, but are redesigned to include a new color scheme, revised security features, and the text &quot;One Nigeria, Great Promise&quot; in microprinting. On the back is a QR code (Quick Response code) which when scanned leads users to a website about Nigeria&#x27;s history.

In 2019, the naira attained a landmark when it featured the signature of Priscilla Ekwere Eleje, the new Director of Currency operations of the Central Bank of Nigeria and the first woman to hold the post. and now in Nigeria there are two #200 notes, two #500 notes and two #1000 notes 

==Second naira==

The naira was scheduled for redenomination in August 2008, although this was cancelled by then-President Umaru Musa Yar&#x27;Adua, with 100 old naira to become 1 new naira. The Nigerian Central Bank stated that it would make the naira fully convertible against foreign currencies by 2009. Currently, the amount of foreign currency is regulated through weekly auctions, while the Central Bank sets the exchange rate. The naira appreciated against the dollar through 2007 due to high oil revenues. Also, the then-Bank Governor, Professor Chukwuma Soludo noted the weekly central bank auctions of foreign currency will gradually be phased out, and that the bank would &quot;only intervene in the market as may be required to achieve defined policy objectives&quot;.

Coins and banknotes, and their security features, are described on the website of the Central Bank of Nigeria.

Coins were to be issued in denominations of:
- 1 kobo (₦0.01)
- 2 kobo (₦0.02)
- 5 kobo (₦0.05)
- 10 kobo (₦0.10)
- 20 kobo (₦0.20)
- 50 Kobo (₦0.50)
- 1 Naira (₦1)
Due to inflation, Nigerian coins are all essentially worthless now.

==2022 redesign==

In 2022, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) under President Muhammadu Buhari led administration expressed the decision to redesign the naira as a statutory responsibility and a way to curb the increased circulation of counterfeit notes in the country. The CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele expressed that the approval for the redesign was granted by the president of the country in fighting corruption, terrorism, kidnapping and other unlawful practices. He said the higher naira denominations have been the denomination mostly used by the perpetrators of the acts which includes ₦200, ₦500 and ₦1,000 notes.
President Muhammadu Buhari officially unveiled the new notes at the state house after 19 years since the naira was redesigned.
The newly redesigned naira notes were planned to be printed by The Nigerian Security Printing and Minting Company Limited which will make the country one out of the four Africa countries who print their currencies locally and not import from foreign countries.

In November 2022, CBN, Nigeria&#x27;s central bank, informed the citizens that the new notes will be issued from 15 December 2022 onward, and that old naira notes need to be returned to the banking system before 31 January 2023 when they will cease to be legal tender. The deadline to exchange banknotes was extended to February 2023.

The redesign is controversial. There have been shortages of the new bank notes at ATMs, necessitating some Nigerians to wait in long lines or sleep on the sidewalk waiting for ATMs to be reloaded.

==Hidden naira notes==
In 2022, Nigeria&#x27;s central bank expressed the scarcity of the currency due to high volume of the naira kept outside the banking system and attributed to be hoarded by politicians.

==Exchange rates==
When the naira was introduced, it had an official exchange rate of US$1.52 for ₦1, though a currency black market existed in which the naira traded at a discount relative to the official exchange rate.

The official exchange rate set by the Central Bank of Nigeria: naira to U.S. dollar is approximately ₦767.54 per 1 US dollar. This rate is almost two times different from the illegal black market exchange rate.
The Black-Market exchange rate of the naira to the U.S. dollar is approximately ₦752.50 per 1 US dollar.

According to a recent (June 2024) report by Naija News, the parallel market exchange rate of the naira to the U.S. dollar is around ₦1483 per 1 USD, significantly higher than the official Central Bank of Nigeria rate. This disparity highlights underlying economic challenges and market pressures.

<text>A steamboat is a boat that is propelled primarily by steam power, typically driving propellers or paddlewheels. The term &quot;steamboat&quot; is used to refer to small steam-powered vessels working on lakes, rivers, and in short-sea shipping. The development of the steamboat led to the larger steamship, which is a seaworthy and often ocean-going ship.

Steamboats sometimes use the prefix designation SS, S.S. or S/S (for &#x27;Screw Steamer&#x27;) or PS (for &#x27;Paddle Steamer&#x27;); however, these designations are most often used for steamships.

==Background==
===Limitations of the Newcomen steam engine===
The first steamboat designs used Newcomen steam engines. These engines were large, heavy, and produced little power, which resulted in an unfavorable power-to-weight ratio. The heavy weight of the Newcomen engine required a structurally strong boat, and the reciprocating motion of the engine beam required a complicated mechanism to produce propulsion.

===Rotary motion engines===
James Watt&#x27;s design improvements increased the efficiency of the steam engine, improving the power-to-weight ratio, and created an engine capable of rotary motion by using a double-acting cylinder which injected steam at each end of the piston stroke to move the piston back and forth. The rotary steam engine simplified the mechanism required to turn a paddle wheel to propel a boat. Despite the improved efficiency and rotary motion, the power-to-weight ratio of Boulton and Watt steam engine was still low.

===High-pressure steam engines===
The high-pressure steam engine was the development that made the steamboat practical. It had a high power-to-weight ratio and was fuel efficient. High pressure engines were made possible by improvements in the design of boilers and engine components so that they could withstand internal pressure, although boiler explosions were common due to lack of instrumentation like pressure gauges. Attempts at making high-pressure engines had to wait until the expiration of the Boulton and Watt patent in 1800. Shortly thereafter high-pressure engines by Richard Trevithick and Oliver Evans were introduced.

===Compound or multiple expansion steam engines===
The compound steam engine became widespread in the late 19th century. Compounding uses exhaust steam from a high pressure cylinder to a lower pressure cylinder and greatly improves efficiency. With compound engines it was possible for trans ocean steamers to carry less coal than freight. Compound steam engine powered ships enabled a great increase in international trade.

===Steam turbines===
The most efficient steam engine used for marine propulsion is the steam turbine. It was developed near the end of the 19th century and was used throughout the 20th century.

==History==
===Early designs===
An apocryphal story from 1851 attributes the earliest steamboat to Denis Papin for a boat he built in 1705. Papin was an early innovator in steam power and the inventor of the steam digester, the first pressure cooker, which played an important role in James Watt&#x27;s steam experiments. However, Papin&#x27;s boat was not steam-powered but powered by hand-cranked paddles.

A steamboat was described and patented by English physician John Allen in 1729. In 1736, Jonathan Hulls was granted a patent in England for a Newcomen engine-powered steamboat (using a pulley instead of a beam, and a pawl and ratchet to obtain rotary motion), but it was the improvement in steam engines by James Watt that made the concept feasible. William Henry of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, having learned of Watt&#x27;s engine on a visit to England, made his own engine, and put it in a boat. The boat sank, and while Henry made an improved model, he did not appear to have much success, though he may have inspired others.
The first steam-powered ship, &quot;Pyroscaphe&quot;, was a paddle steamer powered by a double-acting steam engine; it was built in France in 1783 by Marquis Claude de Jouffroy and his colleagues as an improvement of an earlier attempt, the 1776 &quot;Palmipède&quot;. At its first demonstration on 15 July 1783, &quot;Pyroscaphe&quot; travelled upstream on the river Saône for some fifteen minutes before the engine failed. Presumably this was easily repaired as the boat is said to have made several such journeys. Following this, De Jouffroy attempted to get the government interested in his work, but for political reasons was instructed that he would have to build another version on the Seine in Paris. De Jouffroy did not have the funds for this, and, following the events of the French revolution, work on the project was discontinued after he left the country.

Similar boats were made in 1785 by John Fitch in Philadelphia and William Symington in Dumfries, Scotland. Fitch successfully trialled his boat in 1787, and in 1788, he began operating a regular commercial service along the Delaware River between Philadelphia and Burlington, New Jersey, carrying as many as 30 passengers. This boat could typically make and travelled more than during its short length of service. The Fitch steamboat was not a commercial success, as this travel route was adequately covered by relatively good wagon roads. The following year, a second boat made excursions, and in 1790, a third boat ran a series of trials on the Delaware River before patent disputes dissuaded Fitch from continuing.

Meanwhile, Patrick Miller of Dalswinton, near Dumfries, Scotland, had developed double-hulled boats propelled by manually cranked paddle wheels placed between the hulls, even attempting to interest various European governments in a giant warship version, long. Miller sent King Gustav III of Sweden an actual small-scale version, long, called &quot;Experiment&quot;. Miller then engaged engineer William Symington to build his patent steam engine that drove a stern-mounted paddle wheel in a boat in 1785. The boat was successfully tried out on Dalswinton Loch in 1788 and was followed by a larger steamboat the next year. Miller then abandoned the project.

===19th century===

The failed project of Patrick Miller caught the attention of Lord Dundas, Governor of the Forth and Clyde Canal Company, and at a meeting with the canal company&#x27;s directors on 5 June 1800, they approved his proposals for the use of &quot;a model of a boat by Captain Schank to be worked by a steam engine by Mr Symington&quot; on the canal.

The boat was built by Alexander Hart at Grangemouth to Symington&#x27;s design with a vertical cylinder engine and crosshead transmitting power to a crank driving the paddlewheels. Trials on the River Carron in June 1801 were successful and included towing sloops from the river Forth up the Carron and thence along the Forth and Clyde Canal.

In 1801, Symington patented a horizontal steam engine directly linked to a crank. He got support from Lord Dundas to build a second steamboat, which became famous as the &quot;Charlotte Dundas&quot;, named in honour of Lord Dundas&#x27;s daughter. Symington designed a new hull around his powerful horizontal engine, with the crank driving a large paddle wheel in a central upstand in the hull, aimed at avoiding damage to the canal banks.
The new boat was 56 ft (17.1 m) long, 18 ft (5.5 m) wide and 8 ft (2.4 m) depth, with a wooden hull. The boat was built by John Allan and the engine by the Carron Company.

The first sailing was on the canal in Glasgow on 4 January 1803, with Lord Dundas and a few of his relatives and friends on board. The crowd were pleased with what they saw, but Symington wanted to make improvements and another more ambitious trial was made on 28 March. On this occasion, the &quot;Charlotte Dundas&quot; towed two 70 ton barges 30 km (almost 20 miles) along the Forth and Clyde Canal to Glasgow, and despite &quot;a strong breeze right ahead&quot; that stopped all other canal boats it took only nine and a quarter hours, giving an average speed of about 3 km/h (2 mph). The &quot;Charlotte Dundas&quot; was the first practical steamboat, in that it demonstrated the practicality of steam power for ships, and was the first to be followed by continuous development of steamboats.

The American Robert Fulton was present at the trials of the &quot;Charlotte Dundas&quot; and was intrigued by the potential of the steamboat. While working in France, he corresponded with and was helped by the Scottish engineer Henry Bell, who may have given him the first model of his working steamboat. Fulton designed his own steamboat, which sailed along the River Seine in 1803.

Fulton later obtained a Boulton and Watt steam engine, shipped to America, where his first proper steamship was built in 1807, &quot;North River Steamboat&quot; (later known as &quot;Clermont&quot;), which carried passengers between New York City and Albany, New York. &quot;Clermont&quot; was able to make the trip in 32 hours. The steamboat was powered by a Boulton and Watt engine and was capable of long-distance travel. It was the first commercially successful steamboat, transporting passengers along the Hudson River.

In 1807 Robert L. Stevens began operation of the &quot;Phoenix&quot;, which used a high-pressure engine in combination with a low-pressure condensing engine. The first steamboats powered only by high pressure were the &quot;Aetna&quot; and &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;, designed and built by Oliver Evans.

In October 1811 a ship designed by John Stevens, &quot;Little Juliana&quot;, would operate as the first steam-powered ferry between Hoboken and New York City. Stevens&#x27; ship was engineered as a twin-screw-driven steamboat in juxtaposition to &quot;Clermont&quot;s Boulton and Watt engine. The design was a modification of Stevens&#x27; prior paddle steamer &quot;Phoenix&quot;, the first steamship to successfully navigate the open ocean in its route from Hoboken to Philadelphia.

In 1812, Henry Bell&#x27;s PS &quot;Comet&quot; was inaugurated. The steamboat was the first commercial passenger service in Europe and sailed along the River Clyde in Scotland.

The &quot;Margery&quot;, launched in Dumbarton in 1814, in January 1815 became the first steamboat on the River Thames, much to the amazement of Londoners. She operated a London-to-Gravesend river service until 1816, when she was sold to the French and became the first steamboat to cross the English Channel. When she reached Paris, the new owners renamed her &quot;Elise&quot; and inaugurated a Seine steamboat service.

In 1818, &quot;Ferdinando I&quot;, the first Italian steamboat, left the port of Naples, where it had been built.

===Sea- and Ocean-going===

The first sea-going steamboat was Richard Wright&#x27;s first steamboat &quot;Experiment&quot;, an ex-French lugger; she steamed from Leeds to Yarmouth, arriving Yarmouth 19 July 1813. &quot;Tug&quot;, the first tugboat, was launched by the Woods Brothers, Port Glasgow, on 5 November 1817; in the summer of 1818 she was the first steamboat to travel round the North of Scotland to the East Coast.

By 1826, steamboats were employed on a large number of inland and coastal shipping lines in the United Kingdom. Some of the latter crossed the Irish Sea, others crossed the English Channel to Calais or Boulogne-sur-Mer, or crossed the North Sea to Rotterdam. At the time, the General Steam Navigation Company was one of the biggest companies that operated steamboats in short-sea shipping. The &quot;Talbot&quot; operated by GSNC on the London – Calais line had a tonnage of 156 and 60 hp.

Steamships required carrying fuel (coal) at the expense of the regular payload. For this reason for some time sailships remained more economically viable for long voyages. However, as the steam engine technology improved, more power could be generated by the same quantity of fuel and longer distances could be traveled. A steamship built in 1855 required about 40% of its available cargo space to store enough coal to cross the Atlantic, but by the 1860s, transatlantic steamship services became cost-effective and steamships began to dominate these routes. By the 1870s, particularly in conjunction with the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, South Asia became economically accessible for steamships from Europe. By the 1890s, the steamship technology so improved that steamships became economically viable even on long-distance voyages such as linking Great Britain with its Pacific Asian colonies, such as Singapore and Hong Kong. This resulted in the downfall of sailing.

==Use by country==

===United States===


====Origins====
The era of the steamboat in the United States began in Philadelphia in 1787 when John Fitch (1743–1798) made the first successful trial of a 45-foot (14-meter) steamboat on the Delaware River on 22 August 1787, in the presence of members of the United States Constitutional Convention. Fitch later (1790) built a larger vessel that carried passengers and freight between Philadelphia and Burlington, New Jersey on the Delaware. His steamboat was not a financial success and was shut down after a few months service, however this marks the first use of marine steam propulsion in scheduled regular passenger transport service.

Oliver Evans (1755–1819) was a Philadelphian inventor born in Newport, Delaware, to a family of Welsh settlers. He designed an improved high-pressure steam engine in 1801 but did not build it (patented 1804).
The Philadelphia Board of Health was concerned with the problem of dredging and cleaning the city&#x27;s dockyards, and in 1805 Evans convinced them to contract with him for a steam-powered dredge, which he called the &quot;Oruktor Amphibolos&quot;. It was built but was only marginally successful. Evans&#x27;s high-pressure steam engine had a much higher power-to-weight ratio, making it practical to apply it in locomotives and steamboats. Evans became so depressed with the poor protection that the US patent law gave inventors that he eventually took all his engineering drawings and invention ideas and destroyed them to prevent his children wasting their time in court fighting patent infringements.

Robert Fulton constructed a steamboat to ply a route between New York City and Albany, New York on the Hudson River. He successfully obtained a monopoly on Hudson River traffic after terminating a prior 1797 agreement with John Stevens, who owned extensive land on the Hudson River in New Jersey. The former agreement had partitioned northern Hudson River traffic to Livingston and southern to Stevens, agreeing to use ships designed by Stevens for both operations. With their new monopoly, Fulton and Livingston&#x27;s boat, named the &quot;Clermont&quot; after Livingston&#x27;s estate, could make a profit. The &quot;Clermont&quot; was nicknamed &quot;Fulton&#x27;s Folly&quot; by doubters. On Monday, 17 August 1807, the memorable first voyage of the &quot;Clermont&quot; up the Hudson River was begun. She traveled the trip to Albany in a little over 32 hours and made the return trip in about eight hours.

The use of steamboats on major US rivers soon followed Fulton&#x27;s 1807 success. In 1811, the first in a continuous (still in commercial passenger operation ) line of river steamboats left the dock at Pittsburgh to steam down the Ohio River to the Mississippi and on to New Orleans. In 1817 a consortium in Sackets Harbor, New York, funded the construction of the first US steamboat, &quot;Ontario&quot;, to run on Lake Ontario and the Great Lakes, beginning the growth of lake commercial and passenger traffic. In his book &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot;, river pilot and author Mark Twain described much of the operation of such vessels.

====Types of ships====
By 1849 the shipping industry was in transition from sail-powered boats to steam-powered boats and from wood construction to an ever-increasing metal construction. There were basically three different types of ships being used: standard sailing ships of several different types, clippers, and paddle steamers with paddles mounted on the side or rear. River steamboats typically used rear-mounted paddles and had flat bottoms and shallow hulls designed to carry large loads on generally smooth and occasionally shallow rivers. Ocean-going paddle steamers typically used side-wheeled paddles and used narrower, deeper hulls designed to travel in the often stormy weather encountered at sea. The ship hull design was often based on the clipper ship design with extra bracing to support the loads and strains imposed by the paddle wheels when they encountered rough water.

The first paddle-steamer to make a long ocean voyage was the 320-ton , built in 1819 expressly for packet ship mail and passenger service to and from Liverpool, England. On 22 May 1819, the watch on the &quot;Savannah&quot; sighted Ireland after 23 days at sea. The Allaire Iron Works of New York supplied &quot;Savannah&#x27;s&quot;&#x27;s engine cylinder, while the rest of the engine components and running gear were manufactured by the Speedwell Ironworks of New Jersey. The low-pressure engine was of the inclined direct-acting type, with a single cylinder and a stroke. &quot;Savannah&quot;&#x27;s engine and machinery were unusually large for their time. The ship&#x27;s wrought-iron paddlewheels were 16 feet in diameter with eight buckets per wheel. For fuel, the vessel carried of coal and of wood.

The SS &quot;Savannah&quot; was too small to carry much fuel, and the engine was intended only for use in calm weather and to get in and out of harbors. Under favorable winds the sails alone were able to provide a speed of at least four knots. The &quot;Savannah&quot; was judged not a commercial success, and its engine was removed and it was converted back to a regular sailing ship. By 1848 steamboats built by both United States and British shipbuilders were already in use for mail and passenger service across the Atlantic Ocean—a journey.
Since paddle steamers typically required from of coal per day to keep their engines running, they were more expensive to run. Initially, nearly all seagoing steamboats were equipped with mast and sails to supplement the steam engine power and provide power for occasions when the steam engine needed repair or maintenance. These steamships typically concentrated on high value cargo, mail and passengers and only had moderate cargo capabilities because of their required loads of coal. The typical paddle wheel steamship was powered by a coal burning engine that required firemen to shovel the coal to the burners.

By 1849 the screw propeller had been invented and was slowly being introduced as iron increasingly was used in ship construction and the stress introduced by propellers could be compensated for. As the 1800s progressed the timber and lumber needed to make wooden ships got ever more expensive, and the iron plate needed for iron ship construction got much cheaper as the massive iron works at Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, for example, got ever more efficient. The propeller put a lot of stress on the rear of the ships and would not see widespread use till the conversion from wood boats to iron boats was complete—well underway by 1860. By the 1840s the ocean-going steam ship industry was well established as the Cunard Line and others demonstrated.

The last sailing frigate of the US Navy, , had been launched in 1855.

====West Coast====
In the mid-1840s the acquisition of Oregon and California opened up the West Coast to American steamboat traffic. Starting in 1848 Congress subsidized the Pacific Mail Steamship Company with $199,999 to set up regular packet ship, mail, passenger, and cargo routes in the Pacific Ocean. This regular scheduled route went from Panama City, Nicaragua and Mexico to and from San Francisco and Oregon. Panama City was the Pacific terminus of the Isthmus of Panama trail across Panama. The Atlantic Ocean mail contract from East Coast cities and New Orleans to and from the Chagres River in Panama was won by the United States Mail Steamship Company whose first paddle wheel steamship, the SS Falcon (1848) was dispatched on 1 December 1848 to the Caribbean (Atlantic) terminus of the Isthmus of Panama trail—the Chagres River.

The SS &quot;California&quot; (1848), the first Pacific Mail Steamship Company paddle wheel steamship, left New York City on 6 October 1848 with only a partial load of her about 60 saloon (about $300 fare) and 150 steerage (about $150 fare) passenger capacity. Only a few were going all the way to California. Her crew numbered about 36 men. She left New York well before confirmed word of the California Gold Rush had reached the East Coast. Once the California Gold Rush was confirmed by President James Polk in his State of the Union address on 5 December 1848 people started rushing to Panama City to catch the SS California. The picked up more passengers in Valparaíso, Chile and Panama City, Panama and showed up in San Francisco, loaded with about 400 passengers—twice the passengers it had been designed for—on 28 February 1849. She had left behind about another 400–600 potential passengers still looking for passage from Panama City. The &quot;SS California &quot;had made the trip from Panama and Mexico after steaming around Cape Horn from New York—see SS &quot;California&quot; (1848).

The trips by paddle wheel steamship to Panama and Nicaragua from New York, Philadelphia, Boston, via New Orleans and Havana were about long and took about two weeks. Trips across the Isthmus of Panama or Nicaragua typically took about one week by native canoe and mule back. The trip to or from San Francisco to Panama City could be done by paddle wheel steamer in about three weeks. In addition to this, travel time via the Panama route typically had a two- to four-week waiting period to find a ship going from Panama City, Panama to San Francisco before 1850. It was not before 1850 that enough paddle wheel steamers were available in the Atlantic and Pacific routes to establish regularly scheduled journeys.

Other steamships soon followed, and by late 1849, paddle wheel steamships like the SS &quot;McKim&quot; (1848) were carrying miners and their supplies the trip from San Francisco up the extensive Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta to Stockton, California, Marysville, California, Sacramento, etc. to get about closer to the gold fields. Steam-powered tugboats and towboats started working in the San Francisco Bay soon after this to expedite shipping in and out of the bay.

As the passenger, mail and high value freight business to and from California boomed more and more paddle steamers were brought into service—eleven by the Pacific Mail Steamship Company alone. The trip to and from California via Panama and paddle wheeled steamers could be done, if there were no waits for shipping, in about 40 days—over 100 days less than by wagon or 160 days less than a trip around Cape Horn. About 20–30% of the California Argonauts are thought to have returned to their homes, mostly on the East Coast of the United States via Panama—the fastest way home. Many returned to California after settling their business in the East with their wives, family and/or sweethearts. Most used the Panama or Nicaragua route till 1855 when the completion of the Panama Railroad made the Panama Route much easier, faster and more reliable. Between 1849 and 1869 when the first transcontinental railroad was completed across the United States about 800,000 travelers had used the Panama route. Most of the roughly $50,000,000 of gold found each year in California were shipped East via the Panama route on paddle steamers, mule trains and canoes and later the Panama Railroad across Panama. After 1855 when the Panama Railroad was completed the Panama Route was by far the quickest and easiest way to get to or from California from the East Coast of the U.S. or Europe. Most California bound merchandise still used the slower but cheaper Cape Horn sailing ship route. The sinking of the paddle steamer (the &quot;Ship of Gold&quot;) in a hurricane on 12 September 1857 and the loss of about $2 million in California gold indirectly led to the Panic of 1857.

Steamboat traffic including passenger and freight business grew exponentially in the decades before the Civil War. So too did the economic and human losses inflicted by snags, shoals, boiler explosions, and human error.

====Civil War====
During the US Civil War the Battle of Hampton Roads, often referred to as either the Battle of the &quot;Monitor&quot; and &quot;Merrimack&quot; or the &quot;Battle of Ironclads&quot;, was fought over two days with steam-powered ironclad warships, 8–9 March 1862. The battle occurred in Hampton Roads, a roadstead in Virginia where the Elizabeth and Nansemond Rivers meet the James River just before it enters Chesapeake Bay adjacent to the city of Norfolk. The battle was a part of the effort of the Confederate States of America to break the Union Naval blockade, which had cut off Virginia from all international trade.

The Civil War in the West was fought to control major rivers, especially the Mississippi and Tennessee Rivers using paddlewheelers. Only the Union had them (the Confederacy captured a few, but were unable to use them.) The Battle of Vicksburg involved monitors and ironclad riverboats. The USS &quot;Cairo&quot; is a survivor of the Vicksburg battle. Trade on the river was suspended for two years because of a Confederate&#x27;s Mississippi blockade before the union victory at Vicksburg reopened the river on 4 July 1863. The triumph of Eads ironclads, and Farragut&#x27;s seizure of New Orleans, secured the river for the Union North.

Although Union forces gained control of Mississippi River tributaries, travel there was still subject to interdiction by the Confederates. The Ambush of the steamboat J. R. Williams, which was carrying supplies from Fort Smith to Fort Gibson along the Arkansas River on 16 July 1863 demonstrated this. The steamboat was destroyed, the cargo was lost, and the tiny Union escort was run off. The loss did not affect the Union war effort, however.

The worst of all steamboat accidents occurred at the end of the Civil War in April 1865, when the steamboat &quot;Sultana&quot;, carrying an over-capacity load of returning Union soldiers recently freed from a Confederate prison camp, blew up, causing more than 1,700 deaths.

====Mississippi and Missouri river traffic====
For most of the 19th century and part of the early 20th century, trade on the Mississippi River was dominated by paddle-wheel steamboats. Their use generated rapid development of economies of port cities; the exploitation of agricultural and commodity products, which could be more easily transported to markets; and prosperity along the major rivers. Their success led to penetration deep into the continent, where &quot;Anson Northup&quot; in 1859 became first steamer to cross the Canada–US border on the Red River. They would also be involved in major political events, as when Louis Riel seized &quot;International&quot; at Fort Garry, or Gabriel Dumont was engaged by &quot;Northcote&quot; at Batoche. Steamboats were held in such high esteem that they could become state symbols; the Steamboat &quot;Iowa&quot; (1838) is incorporated in the Seal of Iowa because it represented speed, power, and progress.
At the same time, the expanding steamboat traffic had severe adverse environmental effects, in the Middle Mississippi Valley especially, between St. Louis and the river&#x27;s confluence with the Ohio. The steamboats consumed much wood for fuel, and the river floodplain and banks became deforested. This led to instability in the banks, addition of silt to the water, making the river both shallower and hence wider and causing unpredictable, lateral movement of the river channel across the wide, ten-mile floodplain, endangering navigation. Boats designated as snagpullers to keep the channels free had crews that sometimes cut remaining large trees or more back from the banks, exacerbating the problems. In the 19th century, the flooding of the Mississippi became a more severe problem than when the floodplain was filled with trees and brush.
Most steamboats were destroyed by boiler explosions or fires—and many sank in the river, with some of those buried in silt as the river changed course. From 1811 to 1899, 156 steamboats were lost to snags or rocks between St. Louis and the Ohio River. Another 411 were damaged by fire, explosions or ice during that period. One of the few surviving Mississippi sternwheelers from this period, &quot;Julius C. Wilkie&quot;, was operated as a museum ship at Winona, Minnesota, until its destruction in a fire in 1981. The replacement, built &quot;in situ&quot;, was not a steamboat. The replica was scrapped in 2008.

From 1844 through 1857, luxurious palace steamers carried passengers and cargo around the North American Great Lakes. Great Lakes passenger steamers reached their zenith during the century from 1850 to 1950. The is the last of the once-numerous passenger-carrying steam-powered car ferries operating on the Great Lakes. A unique style of bulk carrier known as the lake freighter was developed on the Great Lakes. The &quot;St. Marys Challenger&quot;, launched in 1906, is the oldest operating steamship in the United States. She runs a Skinner Marine Unaflow 4-cylinder reciprocating steam engine as her power plant.

Women started to become steamboat captains in the late 19th century. The first woman to earn her steamboat master&#x27;s license was Mary Millicent Miller, in 1884. In 1888, Callie Leach French earned her first class license. In 1892, she earned a master&#x27;s license, becoming the only woman to hold both and operating on the Mississippi River. French towed a showboat up and down the rivers until 1907 and boasted that she&#x27;d never had an accident or lost a boat. Another early steamboat captain was Blanche Douglass Leathers, who earned her license in 1894. Mary Becker Greene earned her license in 1897 and along with her husband started the Greene Line.

=====Steamboats in rivers on the west side of the Mississippi River=====
Steamboats also operated on the Red River to Shreveport, Louisiana.

In April 1815, Captain Henry Miller Shreve was the first person to bring a steamboat, the Enterprise, up the Red River.

By 1839 after Captain Henry Miller Shreve broke the Great Raft log jam had been 160 miles long on the river.

In the late 1830s, the steamboats in rivers on the west side of the Mississippi River were a long, wide, shallow draft vessel, lightly built with an engine on the deck. These newer steamboats could sail in just 20 inches of water. Contemporaries claimed that they could &quot;run with a lot of heavy dew&quot;.

====Walking the steamboat over sandbars or away from reefs====
Walking the boat was a way of lifting the bow of a steamboat like on crutches, getting up and down a sandbank with poles, blocks, and strong rigging, and using paddlewheels to lift and move the ship through successive steps, on the helm. Moving of a boat from a sandbar by its own action was known as &quot;walking the boat&quot; and &quot;grass-hoppering&quot;. Two long, strong poles were pushed forward from the bow on either side of the boat into the sandbar at a high degree of angle. Near the end of each pole, a block was secured with a strong rope or clamp that passed through pulleys that lowered through a pair of similar blocks attached to the deck near the bow. The end of each line went to a winch which, when turned, was taut and, with its weight on the stringers, slightly raised the bow of the boat. Activation of the forward paddlewheels and placement of the poles caused the bow of the boat to raise and move the boat forward perhaps a few feet. It was laborious and dangerous work for the crew, even with a Steam donkey driven capstan winch.

====Double-tripping====
Double-tripping means making two voyages by leaving a cargo of a steamboat ashore to lighten boats load during times of extremely low water or when ice impedes progress. The boat had to return (and therefore make a second trip) to retrieve the cargo.

====Piston Rings, Steel replaced cotton seals, 1854====
1854: John Ramsbottom publishes a report on his use of oversized split steel piston rings which maintain a seal by outward spring tension on the cylinder wall. This improved efficiency by allowing much better sealing (compared to earlier cotton seals) which allowed significantly higher system pressures before &quot;blow-by&quot; is experienced.

====Allen Steam Engine at 3 to 5 times higher speeds, 1862====
1862: The Allen steam engine (later called Porter-Allen) is exhibited at the London Exhibition. It is precision engineered and balanced allowing it to operate at from three to five times the speed of other stationary engines. The short stroke and high speed minimize condensation in the cylinder, significantly improving efficiency. The high speed allows direct coupling or the use of reduced sized pulleys and belting.

====Boilers, Water Tubes, Not Explosive, 1867====
====Triple Expansion Steam Engine, 1881====
====Steam Turbine, 1884====
====20th century====
The &quot;Belle of Louisville&quot; is the oldest operating steamboat in the United States, and the oldest operating Mississippi River-style steamboat in the world. She was laid down as &quot;Idlewild&quot; in 1914, and is currently located in Louisville, Kentucky.

Five major commercial steamboats currently operate on the inland waterways of the United States. The only remaining overnight cruising steamboat is the 432-passenger &quot;American Queen&quot;, which operates week-long cruises on the Mississippi, Ohio, Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers 11 months out of the year. The others are day boats: they are the steamers &quot;Chautauqua Belle&quot; at Chautauqua Lake, New York, &quot;Minne Ha-Ha&quot; at Lake George, New York, operating on Lake George; the &quot;Belle of Louisville&quot; in Louisville, Kentucky, operating on the Ohio River; and the &quot;Natchez&quot; in New Orleans, Louisiana, operating on the Mississippi River. For modern craft operated on rivers, see the Riverboat article.

===Canada===
In Canada, the city of Terrace, British Columbia, celebrates &quot;Riverboat Days&quot; each summer. Built on the banks of the Skeena River, the city depended on the steamboat for transportation and trade into the 20th century. The first steamer to enter the Skeena was &quot;Union&quot; in 1864. In 1866 &quot;Mumford&quot; attempted to ascend the river, but it was only able to reach the Kitsumkalum River. It was not until 1891 Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company sternwheeler &quot;Caledonia&quot; successfully negotiated Kitselas Canyon and reached Hazelton. A number of other steamers were built around the turn of the 20th century, in part due to the growing fish industry and the gold rush. For more information, see Steamboats of the Skeena River.
Sternwheelers were an instrumental transportation technology in the development of Western Canada. They were used on most of the navigable waterways of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, BC (British Columbia) and the Yukon at one time or another, generally being supplanted by the expansion of railroads and roads. In the more mountainous and remote areas of the Yukon and BC, working sternwheelers lived on well into the 20th century.

The simplicity of these vessels and their shallow draft made them indispensable to pioneer communities that were otherwise virtually cut off from the outside world. Because of their shallow, flat-bottomed construction (the Canadian examples of the western river sternwheeler generally needed less than three feet of water to float in), they could nose up almost anywhere along a riverbank to pick up or drop off passengers and freight. Sternwheelers would also prove vital to the construction of the railroads that eventually replaced them. They were used to haul supplies, track and other materials to construction camps.

The simple, versatile, locomotive-style boilers fitted to most sternwheelers after about the 1860s could burn coal, when available in more populated areas like the lakes of the Kootenays and the Okanagan region in southern BC, or wood in the more remote areas, such as the Steamboats of the Yukon River or northern BC.

The hulls were generally wooden, although iron, steel and composite hulls gradually overtook them. They were braced internally with a series of built-up longitudinal timbers called &quot;keelsons&quot;. Further resilience was given to the hulls by a system of &quot;hog rods&quot; or &quot;hog chains&quot; that were fastened into the keelsons and led up and over vertical masts called &quot;hog-posts&quot;, and back down again.

Like their counterparts on the Mississippi and its tributaries, and the vessels on the rivers of California, Idaho, Oregon, Washington and Alaska, the Canadian sternwheelers tended to have fairly short life-spans. The hard usage they were subjected to and inherent flexibility of their shallow wooden hulls meant that relatively few of them had careers longer than a decade.
In the Yukon, two vessels are preserved: the in Whitehorse and the in Dawson City. Many derelict hulks can still be found along the Yukon River.

In British Columbia, the &quot;Moyie&quot;, built by the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) in 1898, was operated on Kootenay Lake in south-eastern BC until 1957. It has been carefully restored and is on display in the village of Kaslo, where it acts as a tourist attraction right next to information centre in downtown Kaslo. The &quot;Moyie&quot; is the world&#x27;s oldest intact stern wheeler. While the SS &quot;Sicamous&quot; and SS &quot;Naramata&quot; (steam tug &amp; icebreaker) built by the CPR at Okanagan Landing on Okanagan Lake in 1914 have been preserved in Penticton at the south end of Okanagan Lake.

The SS &quot;Samson V&quot; is the only Canadian steam-powered sternwheeler that has been preserved afloat. It was built in 1937 by the Canadian federal Department of Public Works as a snagboat for clearing logs and debris out of the lower reaches of the Fraser River and for maintaining docks and aids to navigation. The fifth in a line of Fraser River snagpullers, the &quot;Samson V&quot; has engines, paddlewheel and other components that were passed down from the &quot;Samson II&quot; of 1914. It is now moored on the Fraser River as a floating museum in its home port of New Westminster, near Vancouver, BC.

The oldest operating steam driven vessel in North America is the . It was built in Scotland in 1887 to cruise the Muskoka Lakes, District of Muskoka, Ontario, Canada. Originally named the S.S. &quot;Nipissing&quot;, it was converted from a side-paddle-wheel steamer with a walking-beam engine into a two-counter-rotating-propeller steamer.

The first woman steamboat captain on the Columbia River was Minnie Mossman Hill, who earned her master&#x27;s and pilot&#x27;s license in 1887.

===Great Britain===

Engineer Robert Fourness and his cousin, physician James Ashworth are said to have had a steamboat running between Hull and Beverley, after having been granted British Patent No. 1640 of March 1788 for a &quot;new invented machine for working, towing, expediting and facilitating the voyage of ships, sloops and barges and other vessels upon the water&quot;. James Oldham, MICE, described how well he knew those who had built the F&amp;A steamboat in a lecture entitled &quot;On the rise, progress and present position of steam navigation in Hull&quot; that he gave at the 23rd Meeting of the British Association for the Advancement for Science in Hull, England on 7 September 1853.
The first commercially successful steamboat in Europe, Henry Bell&#x27;s &quot;Comet&quot; of 1812, started a rapid expansion of steam services on the Firth of Clyde, and within four years a steamer service was in operation on the inland Loch Lomond, a forerunner of the lake steamers still gracing Swiss lakes.

On the Clyde itself, within ten years of &quot;Comet&#x27;s&quot; start in 1812 there were nearly fifty steamers, and services had started across the Irish Sea to Belfast and on many British estuaries. By 1900 there were over 300 Clyde steamers.

People have had a particular affection for the Clyde puffers, small steam freighters of traditional design developed to use the Scottish canals and to serve the Highlands and Islands. They were immortalised by the tales of Para Handy&#x27;s boat &quot;Vital Spark&quot; by Neil Munro and by the film &quot;The Maggie&quot;, and a small number are being conserved to continue in steam around the west highland sea lochs.

From 1850 to the early decades of the 20th century Windermere, in the English Lake District, was home to many elegant steam launches. They were used for private parties, watching the yacht races or, in one instance, commuting to work, via the rail connection to Barrow in Furness. Many of these fine craft were saved from destruction when steam went out of fashion and are now part of the collection at Windermere Steamboat Museum. The collection includes SL Dolly, 1850, thought to be the world&#x27;s oldest mechanically powered boat, and several of the classic Windermere launches.

Today the 1900 steamer still sails on Loch Katrine, while on Loch Lomond PS &quot;Maid of the Loch&quot; is being restored, and in the English Lakes the oldest operating passenger yacht, SY &quot;Gondola&quot; (built 1859, rebuilt 1979), sails daily during the summer season on Coniston Water.

The paddle steamer &quot;Waverley&quot;, built in 1947, is the last survivor of these fleets, and the last seagoing paddle steamer in the world. This ship sails a full season of cruises every year from places around Britain, and has sailed across the English Channel for a visit to commemorate the sinking of her predecessor, built in 1899, at the Battle of Dunkirk in 1940.

After the Clyde, the Thames estuary was the main growth area for steamboats, starting with the &quot;Margery&quot; and the &quot;Thames&quot; in 1815, which were both brought down from the Clyde. Until the arrival of railways from 1838 onwards, steamers steadily took over the role of the many sail and rowed ferries, with at least 80 ferries by 1830 with routes from London to Gravesend and Margate, and upstream to Richmond. By 1835, the Diamond Steam Packet Company, one of several popular companies, reported that it had carried over 250,000 passengers in the year.

The first steamboat constructed of iron, the &quot;Aaron Manby&quot; was laid down in the Horseley Ironworks in Staffordshire in 1821 and launched at the Surrey Docks in Rotherhithe. After testing in the Thames, the boat steamed to Paris where she was used on the River Seine. Three similar iron steamers followed within a few years.

There are few genuine steamboats left on the River Thames; however, a handful remain.

The SL (steam launch) &quot;Nuneham&quot; is a genuine Victorian steamer built in 1898, and operated on the non-tidal upper Thames by the Thames Steam Packet Boat Company. It is berthed at Runnymede.

SL &quot;Nuneham&quot; was built at Port Brimscombe on the Thames and Severn Canal by Edwin Clarke. She was built for Salter Bros at Oxford for the regular passenger service between Oxford and Kingston. The original Sissons triple-expansion steam engine was removed in the 1960s and replaced with a diesel engine. In 1972, the SL &quot;Nuneham&quot; was sold to a London boat operator and entered service on the Westminster Pier to Hampton Court service. In 1984 the boat was sold again – now practically derelict – to French Brothers Ltd at Runnymede as a restoration project.

Over a number of years French Brothers carefully restored the launch to its former specification. A similar Sissons triple-expansion engine was found in a museum in America, shipped back to the UK and installed, along with a new coal-fired Scotch boiler, designed and built by Alan McEwen of Keighley, Yorkshire. The superstructure was reconstructed to the original design and elegance, including the raised roof, wood panelled saloon and open top deck. The restoration was completed in 1997 and the launch was granted an MCA passenger certificate for 106 passengers. SL Nuneham was entered back into service by French Brothers Ltd, but trading as the Thames Steam Packet Boat Company.

===Europe===
Built in 1856, PS &quot;Skibladner&quot; is the oldest steamship still in operation, serving towns along lake Mjøsa in Norway.

In Denmark, steamboats were a popular means of transportation in earlier times, mostly for recreational purposes. They were deployed to carry passengers for short distances along the coastline or across larger lakes. Falling out of favour later on, some of the original boats are still in operation in a few places, such as &quot;Hjejlen&quot;. Built in 1861, this steamboat is running second to the Norwegian Skibladner as the oldest steamship in operation and sails the lake of Julsø near Silkeborg.

Swiss lakes are home of a number of large steamships. On Lake Lucerne, five paddle steamers are still in service: &#x27; (built in 1901, 800 passengers), &#x27; (1902, 800 passengers), &#x27; (1906, 900 passengers), &#x27; (1913, 900 passengers, fastest paddle-wheeler on European lakes) and &quot; (1928, 1200 passengers, last steamship built for a Swiss lake). There are also five steamers as well as some old steamships converted to diesel-powered paddlewheelers on Lake Geneva, two steamers on Lake Zurich and single ones on other lakes.

In Austria the paddle-wheeler &quot; (250 passengers) of 1871 vintage continues in service on Traunsee. The paddle-wheeler Hohentwiel of 1913 is the oldest running passenger ship on the Lake of Constance.

In The Netherlands, a steamboat is used for the annual Sinterklaas celebration. According to tradition, Sinterklaas always arrives in the Netherlands by steamboat. The steamer in The Netherlands is called Pakjesboot 12.

===New Zealand===
The New Zealand-built 1912 steamer TSS &quot;Earnslaw&quot; still makes regular sight-seeing trips across Lake Wakatipu, an alpine lake near Queenstown.

===Vietnam===

Seeing the great potential of the steam-powered vessels, Vietnamese Emperor Minh Mạng attempted to reproduce a French-made steamboat. The first test in 1838 was a failure as the boiler was broken. The task supervisor was chained and two officials Nguyễn Trung Mậu, Ngô Kim Lân from the Ministry of Construction were jailed for false report. The project was assigned again to Hoàng Văn Lịch and Võ Huy Trinh. In the second test two months later, the engine performed greatly. The Emperor rewarded the two handsomely. He commented that although this machine could be purchased from the Westerner, it is important that his engineers and mechanics could acquaint themselves with modern machinery. Therefore no expense was too great. Encouraged by the success, Minh Mạng ordered the engineers to study and develop steam engines and steamers to equip his naval fleets. At the end of Minh Mạng &#x27;s reign there were 3 steamers produced named &quot;Yến Phi, Vân Phi and Vụ Phi&quot;. However, his successor could not maintain the industry due to financial problems, worsened by many years of social unrest under his rule.

<doc id="178693" wikidata="Q2097208" url="?curid=178693" title="Transculturation">
<text>Transculturation is a term coined by Cuban anthropologist Fernando Ortiz in 1940 to describe the phenomenon of merging and converging cultures. Transculturation encompasses more than transition from one culture to another; it does not consist merely of acquiring another culture (acculturation) or of losing or uprooting a previous culture (deculturation). Rather, it merges these concepts and instead carries the idea of the consequent creation of new cultural phenomena (neoculturation) in which the blending of cultures is understood as producing something entirely new.

Although transculturation is somewhat inevitable, cultural hegemony has historically shaped this process. Particularly, Ortiz referred to the devastating effects of Spanish colonialism on Cuba&#x27;s indigenous peoples as a &quot;failed transculturation&quot;. Further, he affirmed &quot;that when cultures encounter each other, each of the parties invariably exerts a strong influence on the other(s).&quot; Transculturation is often the result of colonial conquest and subjugation. In a postcolonial era, the effects of this oppression remain, as native peoples struggle to regain their own sense of identity. On the other hand, new musical genres have often emerged as a result of transculturation. In reference to Cuba in particular, there exists a mixture between European and African musics as &quot;African slaves left a major imprint on Cuban society, especially in the area of Cuban popular music.&quot;

Where transculturation affects ethnicity and ethnic issues, the term &quot;ethnoconvergence&quot; is sometimes used. In a general sense, transculturation covers war, ethnic conflict, racism, multiculturalism, cross-culturalism, interracial marriage, and any other of a number of contexts that deal with more than one culture. In the other general sense, transculturation is one aspect of global phenomena and human events.

The general processes of transculturation are extremely complex—steered by powerful forces at the macrosocial level, yet ultimately resolved at the interpersonal level. The driving force for conflict is simple proximity—boundaries, once separating people (providing for a measure of isolation) become the issue of a conflict when societies encroach upon one another territorially. If a means to co-exist cannot be immediately found, then conflicts can be hostile, leading to a process by which contact between individuals leads to some resolution. Often, history shows us, the processes of co-existence begins with hostilities, and with the natural passing of polarist individuals, comes the passing of their polarist sentiments, and soon some resolution is achieved. Degrees of hostile conflict vary from outright genocidal conquest, to lukewarm infighting between differing political views within the same ethnic community.

These changes often represent differences between homeland pons, and their diasporic communities abroad. Obstacles to ethnoconvergence are not great. The primary issue, language, (&quot;hence, communication and education&quot;) can be overcome within a single generation—as is evident in the easy acclimation of children of foreign parents. English, for example, is spoken by more non-Anglo-American people than by Anglo-Americans. It has become the current lingua-franca, the worldwide &quot;de facto&quot; standard international language.

Processes of transculturation become more complex within the context of globalization, given the multiple layers of abstraction that permeate everyday experiences. Elizabeth Kath argues that in the global era we can no longer consider transculturation only in relation to the face-to-face, but that we need to take into account the many layers of abstracted interactions that are interwoven through face-to-face encounters, a phenomenon that she describes as &quot;layers of transculturation&quot;. Kath draws upon the concept of constitutive abstraction as seen in the work of Australian social theorists Geoff Sharp and Paul James.

==Homogenization versus ethnoconvergence==

It has been observed that even in monolingual, industrial societies like urban North America, some individuals do cling to a &quot;modernized&quot; primordial identity, apart from others. Some intellectuals, such as Michael Ignatieff, argue that convergence of a general culture does not directly entail a similar convergence in ethnic identities. This can become evident in social situations, where people divide into separate groups, despite being of an identical &quot;super-ethnicity&quot;, such as nationality.

Within each smaller ethnicity, individuals may tend to see it perfectly justified to assimilate with other cultures, and some others view assimilation as wrong and incorrect for their culture. This common theme, representing dualist opinions of ethnoconvergence itself, within a single ethnic group is often manifested in issues of sexual partners and marriage, employment preferences, etc. These varied opinions of ethnoconvergence represent themselves in a spectrum; assimilation, , acculturation, and cultural compromise are commonly used terms for ethnoconvegence which flavor the issues to a bias.

Often it&#x27;s in a secular, multi-ethnic environment that cultural concerns are both minimised and exacerbated; Ethnic prides are boasted, hierarchy is created (&quot;center&quot; culture versus &quot;periphery&quot;) but on the other hand, they will still share a common &quot;culture&quot;, and common language and behaviours. Often the elderly, more conservative-in-association of a clan, tend to reject cross-cultural associations, and participate in ethnically similar community-oriented activities. Xenophobes tend to think of cross-cultural contact as a component of assimilation, and see this as harmful.

==Obstacles to ethnoconvergence==

The obstacle to ethnoconvergence is ethnocentrism, which is the view that one&#x27;s culture is of greater importance than another&#x27;s. Ethnocentrism often takes different forms, as it is a highly personal bias, and manifests itself in countless aspects of culture. Religion, or belief, is the prime ethnocentric divider. Second is custom, which often overlaps with religion. With the adherence to each distinct component within ones own culture, comes the repulsion of the other. In most regions, ethnic divides are binary, meaning only two distinct cultures are present, each seeing the other as foreign. Many, however make the point that the binary example is the exception, and the norm is far more dynamic.

Ethnicity can be divided into two distinct areas, as they relate to ethnoconvergence: Utilitarian traits, and traditional customs.

Religion, on the other hand, is a highly personal and attached part of culture. However, religion does not neatly correspond with ethnic identity. In many cosmopolitan societies, religion is everything—social, utilitarian, intellectual, political—from the point of view of people of immersed cultures; the very concept of ethnicity and its distinctions is incongruous to their immersed concepts.

In many societies, such as in those in Europe, languages are considered a significant component of ethnic values. This does not mean that most Europeans reject learning other languages. Quite the contrary, Europeans are often polyglots, and may label other individuals by their ethnicities; practical means of distinguishing cultures may resemble tendencies similar to ethnocentrism.

However, the political and cultural significance of regional or national languages are retained because these polyglots conform to the linguistic norms of the place they visit—doing &quot;as the Romans do&quot;. Thus, conforming to the &quot;ethnic integrity&quot; of the region.

It has even become a cliché that &quot;to learn a new language is to adopt a new soul&quot;. There are many other examples of the essential significance of language. In pre-Russian Siberia, Tatar-Mongol colonists in the Taiga often recognized indigenous speakers of Turkic languages as their &quot;own people&quot; and non-Turkic groups as &quot;foreigners&quot;, despite these indigenous groups having a similar level of material culture, and sharing much of a primitive culture with tribes foreign to the Muslim-Buddhist Tatar-Mongols.

==Transcultural communications==

In October 2011, U.S. communications agency Bromley launched a new model/strategy utilizing transcultural sociological theory as a means to segment and &#x27;make sense&#x27; of the changing American cultural landscape. Returning to classic social science as a solution, Bromley has embraced the anthropological approach put forward by thinkers like Fernando Ortiz as a way to account for ethnicity and language without being limited by them as a way for viewing the world.

<text>Pound is a name of various units of currency. It is used in some countries today and previously was used in many others. The English word &quot;pound&quot; derives from the Latin expression , in which is a noun meaning &#x27;scale&#x27; and is an adverb meaning &#x27;by weight&#x27;. The currency&#x27;s symbol is £, a stylised form of the blackletter &#x27;L&#x27; (formula_1) (from ), crossed to indicate abbreviation.

The term was adopted in England from the weight of silver used to make 240 pennies, and eventually spread to British colonies all over the world. While silver pennies were produced seven centuries earlier, the first pound coin was minted under Henry VII in 1489.

<text>The pound of force or pound-force (symbol: lbf, sometimes lbf,) is a unit of force used in some systems of measurement, including English Engineering units and the foot–pound–second system. 

Pound-force should not be confused with pound-mass (lb), often simply called &quot;pound&quot;, which is a unit of mass; nor should these be confused with foot-pound (ft⋅lbf), a unit of energy, or pound-foot (lbf⋅ft), a unit of torque.

== Definitions ==
The pound-force is equal to the gravitational force exerted on a mass of one avoirdupois pound on the surface of Earth. Since the 18th century, the unit has been used in low-precision measurements, for which small changes in Earth&#x27;s gravity (which varies from equator to pole by up to half a percent) can safely be neglected.

The 20th century, however, brought the need for a more precise definition, requiring a standardized value for acceleration due to gravity. 

=== Product of avoirdupois pound and standard gravity ===
The pound-force is the product of one avoirdupois pound (exactly ) and the standard acceleration due to gravity, approximately .

The standard values of acceleration of the standard gravitational field (&quot;g&quot;n) and the international avoirdupois pound (lb) result in a pound-force equal to 

formula_1

This definition can be rephrased in terms of the slug. A slug has a mass of 32.174049 lb. A pound-force is the amount of force required to accelerate a slug at a rate of , so:

formula_2

== Conversion to other units ==
== Foot–pound–second (FPS) systems of units ==

In some contexts, the term &quot;pound&quot; is used almost exclusively to refer to the unit of force and not the unit of mass. In those applications, the preferred unit of mass is the slug, i.e. lbf⋅s2/ft. In other contexts, the unit &quot;pound&quot; refers to a unit of mass. The international standard symbol for the pound as a unit of mass is lb. 
In the &quot;engineering&quot; systems (middle column), the weight of the mass unit (pound-mass) on Earth&#x27;s surface is approximately equal to the force unit (pound-force). This is convenient because one pound mass exerts one pound force due to gravity. Note, however, unlike the other systems the force unit is not equal to the mass unit multiplied by the acceleration unit—the use of Newton&#x27;s second law, , requires another factor, &quot;gc&quot;, usually taken to be 32.174049 (lb⋅ft)/(lbf⋅s2).
&quot;Absolute&quot; systems are &quot;coherent&quot; systems of units: by using the slug as the unit of mass, the &quot;gravitational&quot; FPS system (left column) avoids the need for such a constant. The SI is an &quot;absolute&quot; metric system with kilogram and meter as base units.

==Pound of thrust==

The term pound of thrust is an alternative name for pound-force in specific contexts. It is frequently seen in US sources on jet engines and rocketry, some of which continue to use the FPS notation. For example, the thrust produced by each of the Space Shuttle&#x27;s two Solid Rocket Boosters was , together .

<text>Nainital (Kumaoni: &quot;Naintāl&quot;; ) is a town and headquarters of Nainital district of Kumaon division, Uttarakhand, India. It is the judicial capital of Uttarakhand, the High Court of the state being located there and is the headquarters of an eponymous district. It also houses the Governor of Uttarakhand, who resides in the Raj Bhavan. Nainital was the summer capital of the United Provinces.

Nainital is located in the Kumaon foothills of the outer Himalayas at a distance of from the state capital Dehradun and from New Delhi, the capital of India. Situated at an altitude of above sea level, the town is set in a valley containing an eye-shaped lake, approximately two miles in circumference, and surrounded by mountains, of which the highest are Naina Peak () on the north, Deopatha () on the west, and Ayarpatha () on the south. From the tops of the higher peaks, &quot;magnificent views can be obtained of the vast plain to the south, or of the mass of tangled ridges lying north, bound by the great snowy range which forms the central axis of the Himalayas.&quot; The hill station attracts tourists round the year.

==Etymology and mythology==
It is believed that the Naini Lake is one of the 51 &quot;Shakti Peeths&quot;, based on the story of the death of the goddess Sati. Out of grief and sorrow, Shiva carried Sati&#x27;s body, reminiscing about their moments as a couple, and roamed around the universe with it. Vishnu had cut her body into 52 body parts, using his Sudarshana Chakra, which fell on Earth to become sacred sites where all the people can pay homage to the Goddess. The spot where Sati&#x27;s right eye (or &quot;Nain&quot;) fell, came to be called Nain-tal or lake of the eye. The goddess Shakti is worshiped at the Naina Devi Temple, known by locals as Naini Mata Temple on the north shore of the present day lake.

==History==
=== Early history ===
Nainital has historically been a part of the Kumaon region. After the fall of Katyuri Dynasty in 10th century, Kumaon was divided into several small princely states, and the region around Nainital was under various branches of a Khasiya family. The first dynasty to achieve consolidated dominance over Kumaon after the Katyuris was the Chand dynasty, but it took many centuries and Nainital and its surroundings were one of the last areas to be absorbed. Trilok Chand had built a fort at Bhimtal in the thirteenth century, But at that time, Nainital itself was not under the Chand rule, and was situated near the western border of the Kingdom. During the reign of Udyan Chand, the western boundary of the Chand kingdom extended to the Koshi and Suyal rivers, but Ramgarh and Kota were still under the former Khasia rule. Kirat Chand, who ruled from 1488 to 1503 was finally able to establish authority over Nainital and the surrounding region. The Khasia chiefs made an attempt to regain their independence in 1560, when they enjoyed a brief moment of success under the leadership of a Khasiya of Ramgarh, but were later subdued with ruthlessness by Balo Kalyan Chand.

=== Founding ===
The Kumaon Hills came under British rule after the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814–16). The hill station town of Naini Tal was founded only in 1841, with the construction of the first European house (Pilgrim Lodge) by P. Barron, a sugar trader from Shahjahanpur. In his memoir, he wrote: &quot;It is by far the best site I have witnessed in the course of a trek in the Himalayas.&quot; In 1846, when a Captain Madden of the Bengal Artillery visited Naini Tal, he recorded that &quot;houses were rapidly springing up in most parts of the settlement: some towards the crest of the military ranges were nearly above sea level: the rugged and woody Anyarpatta 
Aashish
(Anyar-patt – in Kumaoni means – complete blackout. The reason for this nomenclature by the locals was because there were minimal sun rays due to its location and dense forests) was being gradually planted and that the favourite sites were on the undulating tract of forest land which stretched back from the head of the lake to the base of China and Deopatta (Camel&#x27;s Hump). The church, St. John(1846) in the Wilderness, was one of the earliest buildings in Nainital, followed by Belvedere, Alma lodge, Ashdale Cottage(1860)...&quot; Soon, the town became a health resort favoured by British soldiers and by colonial officials and their families trying to escape the heat of the plains. Later, the town became the summer residence of the governor of the United Provinces.

=== Landslip of 1880 ===
On 18 September 1880 a landslide (&#x27;the landslip of 1880&#x27;) occurred at the north end of the town, burying 151 people. The first known landslide had occurred in 1866 (old Victoria hotel was destroyed), and in 1869 there was a larger one at the same spot, Alma Hill, but &quot;the &quot;great slip&quot;&quot; occurred on &quot;Saturday 18 September 1880.&quot;

The number of dead and missing were 108 Indian and 43 Europeans, along with numerous people who narrowly escaped. (See poem by Hannah Battersby on the page Literary references to Nainital.) The Assembly Rooms and the Naina Devi Temple were destroyed in the disaster. A recreation area known as &#x27;The Flats&#x27; was later built on the site and a new temple was erected. To prevent further disasters, storm water drains were constructed and building bylaws were made stricter.

=== 1950 mass stabbing ===

A mass stabbing occurred at a wedding in Nainital in 1950 that left 22 people dead.

==Geography==
=== Topography ===
The town of Nainital covers a total area of , and is located at , at an average elevation of above sea level. The slopes of the nearby mountains are most populated, with an altitude ranging from . The highest point nearby is the Naina Peak, with a height of . The town is located in the Kumaon foothills of the outer Himalayas at a distance of from the state capital Dehradun and from New Delhi, the capital of India.
The town is set in a valley around the Nainital Lake - an eye-shaped lake, which is located at an altitude of from sea level. The lake is long and wide, and is approximately two miles in circumference. The bed of the lake is at a depth of near Pashandevi, the deepest point of the lake. The lake is deduced to have been formed tectonically. Balia Nala, which is the main stream feeding the lake is along a fault line and the subsequent streams align parallel to major joints and faults. 26 major drains feed the lake including the 3 perennial drains.

Nainital is surrounded by the mountains of Ayarpata (), Devpata (), Handibandi (), Chini, (), Alma (), Lariya Kanta () and Sher ka Danda ().

=== Geology ===
The Krol group of rocks, comprising slates, marls, sandstones, limestones and dolomites with a few small dykes intrusives, is the dominant geological formation of Nainital&#x27;s surroundings, although, Nodules, laminae and stringers of phosphatic material, followed upward by the purple-green shales intercalated with muddy fine-grained sandstone and siltstone; recognised as the Tal Formation; are also prevalent. The region has a complex geological framework; the rocks are fragile and newly formed. The town is completely located in the catchment area of the Nainital lake, which has highly folded and faulted rocks due to polyphase deformation.

Landslides are a frequent occurrence in the hill slopes surrounding the lake, which are steep. The slopes are highly vulnerable to landslides and mass movement due to various geological and human factors. The first known landslip occurred in Nainital in 1866 on Alma hill, and in 1879 there was a larger one at the same spot. The greatest landslide in Nainital occurred on 18 September 1880, on the slope which rising from the north of the flats ends at Alma peak, and resulted in 151 people being buried under the debris. Another heavy landslip occurred on 17 August 1898 outside the Nainital valley.

=== Climate ===
Nainital experiences a subtropical highland climate (&quot;Cwb&quot;) according to Köppen–Geiger climate classification system as the town&#x27;s climate is influenced by the elevation. The town is a bit dry during winter and very wet during summer due to South Asian monsoon system. The lowest precipitation total occurs in November with total , while the highest precipitation total occurs in July with total . Like most places in temperate region, Nainital has a relatively cool summer. The hottest month is July with temperature ranging from to , while the coldest month is January with temperature ranging from to . The highest temperature ever recorded in Nainital was recorded on 18 June 1972, while the lowest temperature was recorded on 17 January 1953.

The winter season in Nainital commences by mid-November and lasts till mid-March. The temperature gradually declines from the month of November onwards and January is the coldest month. Frost and mist are common features in the months of December and January. Occasionally widespread rainfall also occurs due to western disturbance, with snow occurring on peaks higher than 2000m. The winter rainfall is sometimes associated with cyclonic activities. The temperature, however, shows an increasing trend by the end of February or the first half of March. By mid-March, there is a progressive rise in temperature, which indicates the onset of the summer season. While days get slightly warmer; the nights continue to be cool. There is a constant increase in temperature during May and early June when the highest temperature is recorded. The months of March and April are also associated with the occurrence of hailstorms, which brings a short spell of cold.

<text>Arunachal Pradesh (; ) is a state in northeast India. It was formed from the North-East Frontier Agency (NEFA) region, and India declared it as a state on 20 February 1987. Itanagar is its capital and largest town. It borders the Indian states of Assam and Nagaland to the south. It shares international borders with Bhutan in the west, Myanmar in the east, and a disputed 1,129 km border with China&#x27;s Tibet Autonomous Region in the north at the McMahon Line. Arunachal Pradesh is claimed in its entirety by China as South Tibet as part of the Tibet Autonomous Region; China occupied some regions of Arunachal Pradesh in 1962 but later withdrew its forces.

As of the 2011 Census of India, Arunachal Pradesh has a population of 1,383,727 and an area of . With only 17 inhabitants per square kilometre, it is the least densely populated state of India. It is an ethnically diverse state, with predominantly Monpa people in the west, Tani people in the centre, Mishmi and Tai people in the east, and Naga people in the southeast of the state. About 23 major tribes and 100 sub-tribes live in the state, including Nocte, Adi, Nyishi, Singpho, Galo, Tagin, Apatani. The Nyishi are the largest ethnic group in the region. The Mishmi tribe has three sub-tribes, namely Idu-Mishmi, Digaru-Mishmi and Miju-Mishmi.

==Names and their etymology==
Arunachal Pradesh means &quot;Land of the Dawn-Lit Mountains&quot;, which is the sobriquet for the state in Sanskrit. The term was coined during the formation of the state. Prior to the year 1972, it was called North-East Frontier Agency.

The People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) claims the land to be part of Tibet, and calls it South Tibet ( pinyin: &quot;Zàngnán&quot;). In ancient Tibetan texts, eastern Arunachal Pradesh and some parts of Tibet were called Lhoyü while the residents were called Lhobha people, while Tawang district and West Kameng district in western Arunachal Pradesh were called Monyul.

== History ==
===Ancient period===
Very little ancient history is known about the region apart from the Northwestern corner, and the areas bordering current Assam. The Northwestern regions came under Monpa and Tibetan control.

Northwestern parts of this area came under the control of the Monpa kingdom of Monyul under Tibet which flourished between 500 BCE and 600 CE. The Monpa and Sherdukpen keep historical records of the existence of local chiefdoms in the northwest as well.

According to Tibetan chronicles, Monyul was ruled by Gongkar Gyal, descendent of an exiled Tibetan ruler named Lhase Tsangma, the brother of Tibetan king Ralpacan who arrived in Monyul in 837 A.D or earlier.

A descendant of Gongkar Gyal became the ruler of Trashiyangtse region of Bhutan and Gapde Tsan another descendant was the ruler of Khorwong valley in Thembang town (now West Kameng district, Arunachal Pradesh).
Later, the second son of Gongkar Gyal, Wongme Palde who returned to Tibet owing to the poverty in Khorwong valley came back to Monyul to become its ruler.

The Rgyal rigs text written in 1668 or 1728 contains a record of taxes collected. Taxes were paid via coins, foodstuffs, or livestock from area around present-day Kameng district and Tawang district.

The Monpas () ་known to the Chinese as Menba were responsible for trade between Assam and Tibet and held the Koriapar Dooar at Sonitpur district of Assam. The Monpa chief were subordinate to the ruler of Tawang who in turn were subordinate to the Government of Tibet or Ganden Phodrang in Lhasa. The Tibetan government at Lhasa appointed Tibetan officials called Gellongs to supervise the local Monpa chief. The Monpa chief who looked after the Duar were called Tsorgon, a position created in the 16th century.

According to historical Tibetan text the state of Arunachal Pradesh known as Lhoyu came under the control of Tubo Kingdom or Tibetan Empire in the 7th century CE.

===Medieval period===

In the 17th century, the 5th Dalai Lama Ngawang Lobsang Gyatso (1617–1682), who achieved political
supremacy over Tibet in 1642, imposed a tax called &quot;Khrey&quot; over Monyul and instructed the construction of fortresses in Monpa area called Dzong which served as centers for administration and tax collection.

The fortressess built were Dirang Dzong, Taklung Dzong and Gyangkhar Dzong to collect tax from the Dirang Monpa, Kalaktang Monpa and Tawang Monpa respectively. The officials who collected the taxes were called Dzongpon.

The tax was carried to Tawang Monastery and then to Lhasa via Tsona city (present-day China).
The 6th Dalai Lama Tsangyang Gyatso (1683–1706) was born in Tawang and died in Amdo (present-day China) on his way to Beijing after being kidnapped by the Mongol forces under Lha-bzang Khan, the last ruler of Khoshut Khanate on the approval of Kangxi Emperor of the Qing dynasty.

Before his death the 6th Dalai Lama instructed the construction of notable buildings like Tromzikhang in Barkhor, Lhasa.

Arunachal Pradesh falls under Kham () and Ü-Tsang () cultural region of Tibet which also includes the Brahmaputra River watershed.

The foothills and the plains, were under the control of the Chutia kings of Assam. Inner parts of the state remained independent and self-governed even though interactions with external parties did exist.

The main archaeological sites of the state include:
===British India===

In 1912–13, the British Indian government established the North-East Frontier Tracts. It was divided into three sections, which eventually came to be called the Ballipara Frontier Tract, Lakhimpur Frontier Tract and Sadiya Frontier Tract.

==== The McMahon line ====


In 1913–1914, representatives of the &quot;de facto&quot; independent state of Tibet and Britain met in India to define the borders of &#x27;Outer Tibet&#x27; (with respect to China). British administrator Sir Henry McMahon drew the McMahon Line as the border between British India and Tibet, placing Tawang and other areas within British India. The Tibetan and British representatives devised the Simla Accord including the McMahon Line, but the Chinese representatives did not concur. The Simla Accord denies other benefits to China while it declines to assent to the Accord.

The Chinese position was that Tibet was not independent from China and could not sign treaties, so the Accord was invalid, like the Anglo-Chinese (1906) and Anglo-Russian (1907) conventions. British records show that the condition for the Tibetan government to accept the new border was that China must accept the Simla Convention. As Britain was not able to get an acceptance from China, Tibetans considered the McMahon line invalid.

In the time that China did not exercise power in Tibet, the line had no serious challenges. In 1935, a Deputy Secretary in the Foreign Department, Olaf Caroe, &quot;discovered&quot; that the McMahon Line was not drawn on official maps. The Survey of India published a map showing the McMahon Line as the official boundary in 1937. In 1938, two decades after the Simla Conference, the British finally published the Simla Accord as a bilateral accord and the Survey of India published a detailed map showing the McMahon Line as a border of India.

In 1944, Britain established administrations in the area, from Dirang Dzong in the west to Walong in the east. Administrative control extended over the area of the Tawang tract lying south of the Sela Pass when J.P. Mills set up an Assam Rifles post at Dirang Dzong and sent the Tibetan tax-collectors packing. Tibetan protests were brushed aside. However, no steps were taken to evict Tibet from the area north of the pass which contained Tawang town.

=== Sino-Indian War ===

Following the conclusion of British rule, India gained independence in 1947, while the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) was founded in 1949. Despite this, the new Chinese administration maintained its position that the McMahon Line was not valid. In November 1950, the PRC was poised to take over Tibet by force, and India supported Tibet. Journalist Sudha Ramachandran argued that China claimed Tawang on behalf of Tibetans, though Tibetans did not claim Tawang is in Tibet.

In February 1951, India sent Ralengnao Khathing of Manipur with a small escort and several hundred porters to Tawang and took control of the remainder of the Tawang tract from the Tibetans, removing the Tibetan administration. The Indian efforts were warmly welcomed by the native population as a respite from the oppressive feudal regime.

What is now Arunachal Pradesh was established as the North-East Frontier Agency (NEFA) in 1954 and Sino-Indian relations were cordial until 1960. Resurgence of the border disagreement was a factor leading to the Sino-Indian War in 1962, during which China captured most of Arunachal Pradesh. During the 1962 Sino-Indian War, Tawang tract of Arunachal Pradesh was captured and temporarily controlled by the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army. However, China soon declared victory, withdrew back to the McMahon Line and returned Indian prisoners of war in 1963.

The war resulted in the termination of barter trade with Tibet, although since 2007 the Indian government has shown signs of wanting to resume barter trade.

===Renaming and statehood===
The Indian government under the leadership of Indira Gandhi, The North-East Frontier Agency was renamed Arunachal Pradesh on 20 January 1972, and it became a union territory. Later on Arunachal Pradesh became a state on 20 February 1987 during Rajiv Gandhi government at the center.

NB: K A A Raja, as Chief Commissioner to NEFA, under Assam, whose Capital used to be Shillong, later on went to become the first Lieutenant Governor to the Union Territory of Arunachal Pradesh.

=== Recent claims ===
The 14th Dalai Lama did not originally recognise India&#x27;s sovereignty over Arunachal Pradesh. As late as 2003, he said that &quot;Arunachal Pradesh was actually part of Tibet&quot;.
In January 2007, the Dalai Lama said that both Britain and Tibet had recognised the McMahon Line in 1914. In 2008, he said that Arunachal Pradesh was a part of India under the agreement signed by Tibetan and British representatives. According to the Dalai Lama, &quot;In 1962 during the India-China war, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) occupied all these areas (Arunachal Pradesh) but they announced a unilateral ceasefire and withdrew, accepting the current international boundary&quot;.

In recent years, China has occasionally asserted its claims on Tawang. India rebutted these claims and told the Chinese government that Tawang is an integral part of India. India reiterated this to China when the two prime ministers met in Thailand in October 2009. A report that the Chinese Army had briefly invaded Arunachal Pradesh in 2016 was denied by India&#x27;s Minister of State for Home Affairs, Kiren Rijiju. In April 2017, China strongly objected to a visit to Tawang by the Dalai Lama, as it had to an earlier visit by the US ambassador to India. China had objected to the Dalai Lama&#x27;s previous visits to the area.

In 2024, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that, according to satellite imagery, China had constructed villages along and inside of disputed territory within Arunachal Pradesh. Chinese individuals, called &quot;border guardians&quot;, received annual subsidies to relocate to newly built villages and paid to conduct border patrols.

=== Insurgency ===

Arunachal Pradesh has faced threats from insurgent groups, notably the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN), who are believed to have base camps in the districts of Changlang and Tirap. These groups seek to decrease the influence of Indian government in the region and merge part of Arunachal Pradesh into Nagaland.

The Indian army is present along the Tibetan border to thwart any Chinese incursion. Under the Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order 1958 (India), Inner Line Permits (ILPs) are required to enter Arunachal Pradesh through any of its checkgates on the border with Assam.

== Geography ==

Arunachal Pradesh is located between 26.28° N and 29.30° N latitude and 91.20° E and 97.30° E longitude and has an area of .

The highest peak in the state is Kangto, at . Nyegi Kangsang, the main Gorichen peak, and the Eastern Gorichen peak are other tall Himalaya peaks. The state&#x27;s mountain ranges, in the extreme East of India, are described as &quot;the place where the sun rises&quot; in historical Indian texts and named the Aruna Mountains, which inspired the name of the state. The villages of Dong (more accessible by car, and with a lookout favoured by tourists) and Vijaynagar (on the edge of Myanmar) receive the first sunlight in all of India.

Major rivers of Arunachal Pradesh include the Kameng, Subansiri, Siang (Brahmaputra), Dibang, Lohit and Noa Dihing rivers. Subsurface flows and summer snow melt contribute to the volume of water. Mountains until the Siang river are classified as the Eastern Himalayas. Those between the Siang and Noa Dihing are classified as the Mishmi Hills that may be part of the Hengduan Mountains. Mountains south of the Noa Dihing in Tirap and Longding districts are part of the Patkai Range.

=== Climate ===
The climate of Arunachal Pradesh varies with elevation. The low-altitude areas have a humid subtropical climate. High-altitude areas (3,500–5,500 m) have a subtropical highland climate and alpine climate. Arunachal Pradesh receives of rainfall annually, 70%–80% obtained between May and October.

=== Biodiversity ===

Arunachal Pradesh has among the highest diversity of mammals and birds in India. There are around 750 species of birds and more than 200 species of mammals in the state.
 Arunachal&#x27;s forests account for one-third of habitat area within the Himalayan biodiversity hot-spot. In 2013, of Arunachal&#x27;s forests were identified as part of a vast area of continuous forests (, including forests in Myanmar, China and Bhutan) known as Intact forest landscapes. There are three tiger reserves in the state: a reserve in Namdapha National Park, Mouling National Park and Pakke Tiger Reserve.

===Flora===
In the year 2000, Arunachal Pradesh was covered with of tree cover (77% of its land area). It harbours over 5,000 plants. At the lowest elevations, essentially at Arunachal Pradesh&#x27;s border with Assam, are Brahmaputra Valley semi-evergreen forests. Much of the state, including the Himalayan foothills and the Patkai hills, are home to Eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests. Toward the northern border with Tibet, with increasing elevation, come a mixture of Eastern and Northeastern Himalayan subalpine conifer forests followed by Eastern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows and ultimately rock and ice on the highest peaks. It supports many medicinal plants and within Ziro valley of Lower Subansiri district 158 medicinal plants are being used by its inhabitants. The mountain slopes and hills are covered with alpine, temperate, and subtropical forests of dwarf rhododendron, oak, pine, maple and fir. The state has Mouling and Namdapha national parks.

===Fauna===

The major animal species are tiger, leopard, snow leopard, Asian elephant, sambar deer, chital deer, barking deer, sloth bear, mithun (&quot;Bos frontalis&quot;), gaur, dhole, giant squirrel, marbled cat, leopard cat. A new subspecies of hoolock gibbon has been described from the state which has been named as the Mishmi Hills hoolock gibbon (&quot;H. h. mishmiensis&quot;). Three new giant flying squirrels were also described from the state during the last one and half-decade. These were, Mechuka giant flying squirrel, Mishmi Hills giant flying squirrel, and Mebo giant flying squirrel.

== Administration ==
=== Districts ===

Arunachal Pradesh comprises three divisions, namely, Central, East and West, each headed by a divisional commissioner and twenty-five districts, each administered by a deputy commissioner. Arunachal Pradesh has a total of 28 districts, West Siang being the largest district in terms of area and Tawang being the smallest district. Papum is the largest district in terms of population and Diwang Valley is the smallest district.

== Demographics ==

Arunachal Pradesh can be roughly divided into a set of semi-distinct cultural spheres, on the basis of tribal identity, language, religion and material culture: the Tibetic-speaking Monpa area bordering Bhutan in the west, the Tani area in the centre of the state, the Mishmi area to the east of the Tani area, the Tai/Singpho/Tangsa area bordering Myanmar, and the Naga area to the south, which also borders Myanmar. In between there are transition zones, such as the Aka/Hruso/Miji/Sherdukpen area, between the Tibetan Buddhist tribes and the animist Tani hill tribes. In addition, there are isolated peoples scattered throughout the state, such as the Sulung.

Within each of these cultural spheres, one finds populations of related tribes speaking related languages and sharing similar traditions. In the Tibetic area, one finds large numbers of Monpa tribespeople, with several subtribes speaking closely related but mutually incomprehensible languages, and also large numbers of Tibetan refugees. Within the Tani area, major tribes include the Nyishi. Apatani also live among the Nyishi, but are distinct. In the north one find the Tagin People. In the centre, one finds predominantly Galo people, with the major sub-groups of Karka, Lodu, Bogum, Lare and Pugo among others, extending to the Ramo and Pailibo areas (which are close in many ways to Galo). In the east, one finds the Adi with many subtribes including Padam, Pasi, Minyong and Bokar, among others. Milang, while also falling within the general Adi sphere, are in many ways quite distinct. Moving east, the Idu, Miju and Digaru make up the Mishmi cultural-linguistic area.

Moving southeast, the Tai Khamti are linguistically distinct from their neighbours and culturally distinct from the majority of other Arunachalese tribes. They follow the Theravada sect of Buddhism. They also exhibit considerable convergence with the Singpho and Tangsa Naga tribes of the same area, all of which are also found in Burma. They are one of the most recent people group migrated to Arunachal region from Burma. The Nocte Naga and Wancho Naga are another two major ethnic tribes. Both the tribes exhibit very much cultural similarities. Finally, the Deori tribe is also a major community in the state, with their own distinctive identity. They are the descendants of the priestly class of Chutia people who were allowed to continue their livelihood after the defeat of the Chutias. Deoris are one of the only Arunachal tribes in the historical records – which shows they are among the first ethnic groups to inhabit the Himalayas of the districts of Dibang Valley and Lohit, before the arrival of many other tribes in the region between 1600 and 1900.

Literacy has risen in official figures to 66.95% in 2011 from 54.74% in 2001. The literate population is said to number 789,943. The number of literate males is 454,532 (73.69%) and the number of literate females is 335,411 (59.57%).

===Religion===

The religious landscape of Arunachal Pradesh is diverse with no single religious group representing the majority of the population, although it is one of the few Indian states where Christianity has the most followers. A relatively large percentage of Arunachal&#x27;s population are nature worshippers (indigenous religions), and follow their own distinct traditional institutions like the Nyedar Namlo by the Nyishi, the Rangfrah by the Tangsa &amp; Nocte, Medar Nelo by the Apatani, the Kargu Gamgi by the Galo and Donyi-Polo Dere by the Adi under the umbrella of the indigenous religion the Donyi-Polo. A small number of Arunachali people have traditionally identified as Hindus, although the number may grow as animist traditions are absorbed into Hinduism. Tibetan Buddhism predominates in the districts of Tawang, West Kameng, and isolated regions adjacent to Tibet. Theravada Buddhism is practised by groups living near the Myanmar border. Around 30% of the population are Christians.

Buddhism arrived in Arunachal Pradesh in 8th century CE from Tibet.

According to the 2011 Indian Census, the religions of Arunachal Pradesh break down as follows:
* Christians: 418,732 (30.26%)
* Hindus: 401,876 (29.04%)
* Others: 362,553 (26.20%)
* Buddhists: 162,815 (11.77%)
* Muslims: 27,045 (1.95%)
* Sikhs: 3,287 (0.24%)
* Jains: 771 (0.06%)
In 1971, the percentage of Christians in the state was 0.79%. This increased to 10.3% by 1991 and by 2011 it had crossed 25%.

=== Languages ===

The speakers of major languages of the state according to the 2011 census are Nyishi (20.74%), Adi (17.35%, includes Adi and Gallong), Nepali (6.89%), Tagin (4.54%), Bhotia (4.51%), Wancho (4.23%), Assamese (3.9%), Bangla (3.65%), Hindi (3.45%), Chakma (3.40%), Apatani (3.21%), Mishmi (3.04%), Tangsa (2.64%), Nocte (2.19%), Bhojpuri (2.04%) and Sadri (1.03%).

The vast majority of Arunachal Pradesh speaks Tani languages of the Tibeto-Burman language family. Tani people are indigenous to central Arunachal Pradesh, including (moving from west to east) the Nyishi, the Apatani, the Tagin, the Galo, the Bokar, the Adi, the Padam, the Pasi, and the Minyong. The Tani languages are noticeably characterised by an overall relative uniformity, suggesting relatively recent origin and dispersal within their present-day area of concentration. Most of the Tani languages are mutually intelligible with at least one other Tani language, meaning that the area constitutes a dialect chain, as was once found in much of Europe; only Apatani and Milang stand out as relatively unusual in the Tani context. Tani languages are among the better-studied languages of the region.

To the east of the Tani area lie three virtually undescribed and highly endangered languages of the &quot;Mishmi&quot; group of Tibeto-Burman: Idu, Digaru and Mishmi people. A number of speakers of these languages are also found in Tibet. The relationships of these languages, both among one another and to other area languages, are as yet uncertain. Further south, one finds the Singpho (Kachin) language, which is primarily spoken by large populations in Myanmar&#x27;s Kachin State, and the Nocte and Wancho languages, which show affiliations to certain Naga languages spoken to the south in modern-day Nagaland.

To the west and north of the Tani area are found at least one and possibly as many as four Bodic languages, including Dakpa and Tshangla language; within modern-day India, these languages go by the cognate but, in usage, distinct designations Monpa and Memba. Most speakers of these languages or closely related Bodic languages are found in neighbouring Bhutan and Tibet, and Monpa and Memba populations remain closely adjacent to these border regions.

Between the Bodic and Tani areas lie many almost completely undescribed and unclassified languages, which, speculatively considered Tibeto-Burman, exhibit many unique structural and lexical properties that probably reflect both a long history in the region and a complex history of language contact with neighbouring populations. Among them are Sherdukpen, Bugun, Hruso, Koro, Miji, Bangru and Puroik/Sulung. The high linguistic significance these languages is belied by the extreme paucity of documentation and description of them, even in view of their highly endangered status. Puroik, in particular, is perhaps one of the most culturally and linguistically unique and significant populations in all of Asia from proto-historical and anthropological-linguistic perspectives, and yet virtually no information of any real reliability regarding their culture or language can be found in print.

Finally, other than the Bodic and Tani groups, there are also certain migratory languages that are largely spoken by migratory and central government employees serving in the state in different departments and institutions in modern-day Arunachal Pradesh. They are classified as Non-Tribal as per the provisions of the Constitution of India.

Outside of Tibeto-Burman, one finds in Arunachal Pradesh a single representative of the Tai family, spoken by Tai Khamti, which is closely affiliated to the Shan language of Myanmar&#x27;s Shan State. Seemingly, Khampti is a recent arrival in Arunachal Pradesh whose presence dates to 18th and/or early 19th-century migrations from northern Myanmar.

In addition to English, various Indo-Aryan languages Assamese, Bengali, Nepali and especially Hindi are making strong inroads into Arunachal Pradesh. Primarily as a result of the primary education system—in which classes are generally taught by Hindi-speaking migrant teachers from Bihar and other Hindi-speaking parts of northern India, a large and growing section of the population now speaks a semi-creolised variety of Hindi as a mother tongue. Hindi acts as a lingua franca for most of the people in the state. Despite, or perhaps because of, the linguistic diversity of the region, English is the only official language recognised in the state.

== Economy ==

The chart below displays the trend of the gross state domestic product of Arunachal Pradesh at market prices by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation with figures in billions of Indian Rupees.

Arunachal Pradesh&#x27;s gross state domestic product was estimated at US$706 million at current prices in 2004 and US$1.75 billion at current prices in 2012. Agriculture primarily drives the economy. Jhum, the local term used for shifting cultivation is being widely practised among the tribal groups, though owing to the gradual growth of other sources of income in the recent years, it is not being practised as prominently as it was earlier. Arunachal Pradesh has close to 61,000 km2 of forests, and forest products are the next most significant sector of the economy. Among the crops grown here are rice, maize, millet, wheat, pulses, sugarcane, ginger, and oilseeds. Arunachal is also ideal for horticulture and fruit orchards. Its major industries are rice mills, fruit preservation and processing units, and handloom handicrafts. Sawmills and plywood trades are prohibited under law. There are many saw mills in the state.
A significant portion of India&#x27;s unexplored hydroelectric capacity is attributed to Arunachal Pradesh. In 2008, the Arunachal Pradesh government entered into several memoranda of understanding with multiple companies, outlining around 42 hydroelectric projects intended to generate over 27,000 MW of electricity. Construction of the Upper Siang Hydroelectric Project, which is expected to generate between 10,000 and 12,000 MW, began in April 2009.

== Transport ==

=== Air ===
Itanagar Airport, a Greenfield project serving Itanagar was constructed at Holongi at a cost of 6.5 billion. In 2022, IndiGo began direct flights to Itanagar from Mumbai and Kolkata. Alliance Air operates flights to the state flying from Kolkata via Guwahati to Pasighat Airport. This route commenced in May 2018 under the Government&#x27;s Regional Connectivity Scheme UDAN following the completion of a passenger terminal at Pasighat Airport in 2017. State-owned Daporijo Airport, Ziro Airport, Along Airport, and Tezu Airport are small and not in operation, but the government has proposed to develop them. Before the state was connected by roads, these airstrips were used to distribute food.

=== Roads ===
The main highway of Arunachal Pradesh is the Trans-Arunachal Highway, National Highway 13 (; formerly NH-229 and NH-52). It originates in Tawang and spans most of the width of Arunachal Pradesh, then crosses south into Assam and ends at Wakro. The project was announced by then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2008 for completion by 2015–16, but only became operational in 2018.

NH-15 through Assam follows the southern border of Arunachal Pradesh. Access to central Arunachal Pradesh has been facilitated by the Bogibeel Bridge, an earthquake-resistant rail and road bridge over the Brahmaputra River in Assam, opened for public use on 25 December 2018 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. A spur highway numbered NH-415 services Itanagar.

State-owned Arunachal Pradesh State Transport Services (APSTS) runs daily bus service from Itanagar to most district headquarters including Tezpur, Guwahati in Assam, Shillong in Meghalaya, and Dimapur in Nagaland.

, every village is connected by road, thanks to funding provided by the central government. Every small town has its own bus station with daily bus service. Connections to Assam have increased commerce.

In 2014, two additional east–west highways were proposed: an Industrial Corridor Highway in the lower foothills, and a Frontier Highway along the McMahon Line. The proposed alignment of the Frontier Highway has been published.

=== Railway ===
Arunachal Pradesh got its first railway line in late 2013 with the opening of the new link line from Harmuti on the main Rangpara North–Murkongselak railway line to Naharlagun in Arunachal Pradesh. The construction of the 33-kilometre broad-gauge railway line was completed in 2012, and the link became operational after the gauge conversion of the main line from Assam. The state capital Itanagar was added to the Indian railway map on 12 April 2014 via the newly built 20-kilometre Harmuti-Naharlagun railway line, when a train from Dekargaon in Assam reached Naharlagun railway station, 10 kilometres from the centre of Itanagar, a total distance of 181 kilometres.

On 20 February 2015 the first through train was run from New Delhi to Naharlagun, flagged off from the capital by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. India plans to eventually extend the railway to Tawang, near the border with China.

== Education ==

The state government is expanding the relatively underdeveloped education system with the assistance of NGOs like Vivekananda Kendra, leading to a sharp improvement in the state&#x27;s literacy rate. The main universities are the Rajiv Gandhi University (formerly known as Arunachal University), under which come 36 institutions offering regular undergraduate courses as well as teacher education and health sciences and nursing degrees, both under governmental and private managements, Indira Gandhi Technological and Medical Sciences University and Himalayan University as well. The first college, Jawaharlal Nehru College, Pasighat, was established in 1964. The First Technical University is Established in 2014 namely North East Frontier Technical University (NEFTU). In Aalo, West Siang District by The Automobile Society India, New Delhi. There is also a deemed university, the North Eastern Regional Institute of Science and Technology as well as the National Institute of Technology, Arunachal Pradesh, established on 18 August 2010, is located in Yupia (headquarter of Itanagar). NERIST plays an important role in technical and management higher education. The directorate of technical education conducts examinations yearly so that students who qualify can continue on to higher studies in other states.

Of the above institutions, only the following institutions are accredited by NAAC (National Assessment and Accreditation Council), in the order of their grade: Jawaharlal Nehru College, Pasighat (Grade A), St Claret College, Ziro (Grade A), Indira Gandhi Govt. College, Tezu (Grade B++), Rajiv Gandhi University (Grade B), National Institute of Technology, Arunachal Pradesh (Grade B), Dera Natung Government College, Itanagar (Grade B), Govt. College, Bomdila (Grade B), Donyi Polo Govt. College, Kamki (Grade B), and Rang Frah Govt. College, Changeling (Grade C).

Wangcha Rajkumar Government College, Deomali is the only college in the southeastern part of Arunachal Pradesh. It caters to the students from Tirap, Changlang and Longding districts.

There are also trust institutes, like Pali Vidyapith, run by Buddhists. They teach Pali and Khamti scripts in addition to typical education subjects. Khamti is the only tribe in Arunachal Pradesh that has its own script. Libraries of scriptures are in a number of places in Lohit district, the largest one being in Chowkham.

The state has two polytechnic institutes: Rajiv Gandhi Government Polytechnic in Itanagar established in 2002 and Tomi Polytechnic College in Basar established in 2006. There are two law colleges, namely, the private-owned Arunachal Law Academy at Itanagar and the government-owned Jarbom Gamlin Government Law College at Jote, Itanagar. The College of Horticulture and Forestry is affiliated to the Central Agricultural University, Imphal.

==Politics==

Arunachal Pradesh suffered political crisis between April 2016 and December 2016. The Indian National Congress Chief Minister Nabam Tuki replaced Jarbom Gamlin as the Chief Minister of Arunachal Pradesh on 1 November 2011 and continued until January 2016. After a political crisis in 2016, President&#x27;s rule was imposed ending his tenure as the chief minister. In February 2016, Kalikho Pul became the Chief Minister when 14 disqualified MLAs were reinstated by the Supreme Court. On 13 July 2016, the Supreme Court quashed the Arunachal Pradesh Governor J.P. Rajkhowa&#x27;s order to advance the Assembly session from 14 January 2016 to 16 December 2015, which resulted in President&#x27;s rule in Arunachal Pradesh. As a result, Nabam Tuki was reinstated as the Chief Minister of Arunachal Pradesh on 13 July 2016. But hours before floor test, he resigned as the chief minister on 16 July 2016. He was succeeded by Pema Khandu as the INC Chief Minister who later joined PPA in September 2016 along with majority of MLAs. Pema Khandu further joined BJP in December 2016 along with majority of MLAs. Arunachal Pradesh becomes second northeast Indian state to achieve ODF status.
During 2017, 2021, and 2023, China compiled a list of name alterations for multiple locations in Arunachal Pradesh, in both Chinese and Tibetan languages. China asserts these areas as belonging to &quot;Southern Tibet&quot; and being integral parts of China. The proposed changes encompassed 11 alterations, covering geographical landmarks like mountain summits and rivers, as well as residential zones. The Indian government has continued to reject Chinese claims of geographical ownership of parts of Arunachal Pradesh. National military forces on both sides have increased over the Indian-Chinese border.

On 28 August 2023, China further provoked India when the PRC&#x27;s Ministry of Natural Resources released its new &#x27;standard map&#x27; in which Arunachal Pradesh was depicted as a part of PRC. Other internationally disputed lands and waters were also depicted as PRC territory on their new map.

== State symbols ==


==Geographical indication==
Arunachal Pradesh Khaw Tai (Khamti Rice) was awarded the Geographical Indication (GI) status tag from the Geographical Indications Registry, under the Union Government of India, on 3 October 2023 and is valid until 12 December 2031.

Namsai Organic Spices and Agricultural Producer Company Limited from Lohit, proposed the GI registration of Arunachal Pradesh Khaw Tai (Khamti Rice). After filing the application in December 2021, the rice was granted the GI tag in 2023 by the Geographical Indication Registry in Chennai, making the name &quot;Arunachal Pradesh Khaw Tai (Khamti Rice)&quot; exclusive to the rice grown in the region. It thus became the first rice variety from Arunachal Pradesh and the 3rd type of goods from Arunachal Pradesh to earn the GI tag. The GI tag protects the rice from illegal selling and marketing, and gives it legal protection and a unique identity.

<text>A cable length or length of cable is a nautical unit of measure equal to one tenth of a nautical mile or approximately 100 fathoms. Owing to anachronisms and varying techniques of measurement, a cable length can be anywhere from , depending on the standard used.

==Etymology and origin==
The modern word &quot;cable&quot; is directly descended from the Middle English &quot;cable&quot;, &quot;cabel&quot; or &quot;kabel&quot; and also occurs in Middle Dutch and Middle German. Ultimately the word comes from Romanic, probably from a cattle halter. A cable in this usage cable is a thick rope or by transference a chain cable. The OED gives quotations from onwards. A cable&#x27;s length (often &quot;cable length&quot; or just &quot;cable&quot;) is simply the standard length in which cables came, which by 1555 had settled to around or .

Traditionally rope is made on long ropewalks, the length of which determines the maximum length of rope it is possible to make. As rope is &quot;closed&quot; (the final stage in manufacture) the length reduces, thus the ropewalk at Chatham Dockyard is long in order to produce standard coils.

==Definition==

The definition varies:

* International: 185.2 m, equivalent to nautical mile
* UK traditional: , though (The Admiralty) used of a sea mile, 1 minute of latitude locally.
* US customary (US Navy): 

In 2008 the Royal Navy in a handbook defined it as

<doc id="178713" wikidata="Q909315" url="?curid=178713" title="Light-second">
<text>The light-second is a unit of length useful in astronomy, telecommunications and relativistic physics. It is defined as the distance that light travels in free space in one second, and is equal to exactly (approximately or ).

Just as the second forms the basis for other units of time, the light-second can form the basis for other units of length, ranging from the light-nanosecond ( or just under one international foot) to the light-minute, light-hour and light-day, which are sometimes used in popular science publications. The more commonly used light-year is also currently defined to be equal to precisely , since the definition of a year is based on a Julian year (not the Gregorian year) of exactly , each of exactly .

== Use in telecommunications ==
Communications signals on Earth rarely travel at precisely the speed of light in free space. Distances in fractions of a light-second are useful for planning telecommunications networks.

* One light-nanosecond is almost 300 millimetres (299.8 mm, 5 mm less than one foot), which limits the speed of data transfer between different parts of a computer.
* One light-microsecond is about 300 metres.
* The mean distance, over land, between opposite sides of the Earth is 66.8 light-milliseconds.
* Communications satellites are typically 1.337 light-milliseconds (low Earth orbit) to 119.4 light-milliseconds (geostationary orbit) from the surface of the Earth. Hence there will always be a delay of at least a quarter of a second in a communication via geostationary satellite (119.4 ms times 2); this delay is just perceptible in a transoceanic telephone conversation routed by satellite. The answer will also be delayed with a quarter of a second and this is clearly noticeable during interviews or discussions on TV when sent over satellite.

==Use in astronomy==

The light-second is a convenient unit for measuring distances in the inner Solar System, since it corresponds very closely to the radiometric data used to determine them. (The match is not exact for an Earth-based observer because of a very small correction for the effects of relativity.) The value of the astronomical unit (roughly the distance between Earth and the Sun) in light-seconds is a fundamental measurement for the calculation of modern ephemerides (tables of planetary positions). It is usually quoted as &quot;light-time for unit distance&quot; in tables of astronomical constants, and its currently accepted value is  s.

* The mean diameter of Earth is about 0.0425 light-seconds.
* The average distance between Earth and the Moon (the lunar distance) is about 1.282 light-seconds.
* The diameter of the Sun is about 4.643 light-seconds.
* The average distance between Earth and the Sun (the astronomical unit) is 499.0 light-seconds.

Multiples of the light-second can be defined, although apart from the light-year, they are more used in popular science publications than in research works. For example:

* A light-minute is 60 light-seconds, and so the average distance between Earth and the Sun is 8.317 light-minutes.
* The average distance between Pluto and the Sun (34.72 AU) is 4.81 light-hours.
* Humanity&#x27;s most distant artificial object, &quot;Voyager 1&quot;, has an interstellar velocity of 3.57 AU per year, or 29.7 light-minutes per year. As of 2023 the probe, launched in 1977, is over 22 light-hours from Earth and the Sun, and is expected to reach a distance of one light-day around November 2026 – February 2027.

<text>Najd (, ), or Nejd, is the central region of the Arabian peninsula. Its boundaries cannot be precisely determined due to varying geographical and political limits throughout history. It is bounded by the Hejaz region in the west, the Nafud desert in al-Jawf to the North, ad-Dahna Desert in al-Ahsa to the east, and the Empty Quarter to the south.

Administratively, Najd is divided into three main regions: The Riyadh region features Wadi Hanifa and the Tuwaiq escarpment, which houses easterly Yamama with the Saudi capital, Riyadh since 1824, and the Sudairi region, which has its capital in Majmaah. The second region, Al-Qassim, houses the fertile oases and date palm orchards spread out in the region&#x27;s highlands along Wadi Rummah in central Najd with its capital in Buraidah, the second largest Najdi city, with the region historically contested by the House of Rashid to its north and the House of Saud to its east and south. The third administrative unit is northerly Ḥaʼil, which features the mountains of Jabal Shammar housing the Tayy capital of Ḥaʼil.

The Najd region is where about a third of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s modern population resides. It is the home of the House of Saud, from which it pursued its unification with Hejaz since the time of the Emirate of Diriyah.

== Toponymy ==
The term &quot;Najd&quot; () literally translates to &quot;highland&quot; in Arabic.

== History ==
=== Ancient history ===

The Najd region is home to Al-Magar, which was an advanced prehistoric culture of the Neolithic whose center lay in modern-day southwestern Najd. Al-Magar is possibly one of the first cultures in the world where widespread agriculture and the domestication of animals occurred, particularly that of the horse, during the Neolithic period, before climate changes in the region resulted in desertification. Radiocarbon dating of several objects discovered at Al-Magar indicate an age of about 9,000 years.

In November 2017 hunting scenes showing images of what appear to be domesticated dogs resembling the Canaan dog and wearing leashes were discovered in Shuwaymis, an area about 370 km southwest of the city of Ha&#x27;il. Dated at 8,000 years before the present, these are thought of as the earliest known depictions of dogs in the world.
In the 5th century AD, the tribes of North Arabia became a major threat to the trade line between Yemen and Syria. The Ḥimyarites of Sheba decided to establish a vassal state that controlled Central and North Arabia. The Kindites, mentioned in Greek sources as the Chinedakolpitai (), gained strength and numbers to play that role and in AD 425 the Ḥimyarite king Ḥasan ibn &#x27;Amr ibn Tubba’ made Ḥujr &#x27;Akīl al-Murār ibn &#x27;Amr the first King (Ḥujr) of Kindah. They established the Kingdom of Kinda in Najd in central Arabia unlike the organized states of Yemen; its kings exercised an influence over a number of associated tribes more by personal prestige than by coercive settled authority. Their first capital was Qaryat Dhāt Kāhil, today known as Qaryat al-Fāw.

The Ghassānids, Lakhmids and Kindites were all Kahlānī and Qaḥṭānī kingdoms which thrived in Najd. In the 5th and 6th centuries AD, the Kindites made the first real concerted effort to unite all the tribes of Central Arabia through alliances, and focused on wars with the Lakhmids. Al-Ḥārith ibn &#x27;Amr, the most famous of their kings, finally succeeded in capturing the Lakhmid capital of al-Ḥirah in southern modern-day Iraq. Later however in about 529, al-Mundhir recaptured the city and put King Ḥārith and about fifty members of his family to death.

In 525, the Aksumites invaded Ḥimyar, and this had a knock-on effect with the Kindites, who lost the support of the Ḥimyarites. Within three years the Kindite kingdom had split into four groups: Asad, Taghlib, Qays and Kinānah, each led by a prince of Kindah. These small principalities were then overthrown in the 530s and 540s in a series of uprisings of the Adnani tribes of Najd and Hijaz. In 540, the Lakhmids destroyed all the Kindite settlements in Nejd, forcing the majority of them to move to Yemen. The Kindites and most of the Arab tribes switched their alliances to the Lakhmids.

=== Islamic history ===
Muhammad carried out military expeditions in the area. The first was the Nejd Caravan Raid against the Quraysh, which took place in 624. The Meccans led by Safwan ibn Umayyah, who lived on trade, left in summer for Syria for their seasonal trade business. After Muhammad received intelligence about the Caravan&#x27;s route, he ordered Zayd ibn Haritha to go after the Caravan, and they successfully raided it and captured 100,000 dirhams worth of booty.

The Invasion of Nejd happened in Rabi‘ Ath-Thani or Jumada al-Awwal, 4 AH (October, 625 AD). Muhammad led his fighters to Nejd to scare off some tribes whose intentions were suspicious. Some scholars say the expedition of Dhat al-Riqa took place in Nejd as part of this invasion.

The most authentic opinion according to &quot;Saifur Rahman al Mubararakpuri&quot;, however, is that the Dhat Ar-Riqa&#x27; campaign took place after the fall of Khaibar (and not as part of the invasion of Nejd). This is supported by the fact that Abu Hurairah and Abu Musa Al-Ash&#x27;ari witnessed the battle. Abu Hurairah embraced Islam only some days before Khaibar, and Abu Musa Al-Ash&#x27;ari came back from Abyssinia (modern day Ethiopia), and joined Muhammad at Khaibar. The rules relating to the prayer of fear, which Muhammad observed at the Dhat Ar-Riqa&#x27; campaign, were revealed at the Asfan invasion and, these scholars say, took place after Al-Khandaq.

The Expedition of Qatan also took place in Nejd. The Banu Asad ibn Khuzaymah tribe (not to be confused with the Banu Asad tribe) was a powerful tribe connected with the Quraysh. They resided near the hill of Katan, in the vicinity of Fayd, in Nejd. Muhammad received intelligence reports that they were planning a raid on Medina, so he dispatched a force of 150 men under the leadership of Abu Salama &#x27;Abd Allah ibn &#x27;Abd al-Asad to make a sudden attack on this tribe.

==== Ridda wars ====
After Prophet Muhammad&#x27;s death, previously dormant tensions between the Meccan immigrants, the Muhajirun, and the Medinan converts, the Ansar, threatened to split the Ummah. Other Arabian tribes also wished to revert from Islam to local leadership and split from Medina&#x27;s control; in some places, people such as Al-Aswad Al-Ansi and Musaylima claimed prophethood and started to establish leaderships in opposition to Medina.

The Ansar, the leaders of the tribes of Medina, met in a hall or house called saqifah, to discuss whom they would support as their new leader. When Abu Bakr was informed of the meeting, he, Umar, Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah and a few others rushed to prevent the Ansar from making a premature decision. During the meeting Umar declared that Abu Bakr should be the new leader, and declared his allegiance to Abu Bakr, followed by Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah, and thus Abu Bakr became the first caliph.

Apostasy and rebellion in central Arabia were led by Musaylima in the fertile region of Yamamah. He was mainly supported by the powerful tribe of Banu Hanifa. At Buzakha in north central Arabia, another claimed prophet, Tulayha, a tribal chief of Banu Asad, led the rebellion against Medina, aided by the allied tribes of Banu Ghatafan, the Hawazin, and the Tayy. At Najd, Malik ibn Nuweira led the tribes of Banu Tamim against the authority of Medina.
On receiving intelligence of the Muslims&#x27; preparations, Tulayha too prepared for a battle, and was further reinforced by the contingents of the allied tribes. Before launching Khalid ibn Al-Walid against Tulayha, Abu Bakr sought ways and means of reducing the latter&#x27;s strength, so that the battle could be fought with the maximum prospects of victory. Nothing could be done about the tribes of Banu Asad and Banu Ghatafan, which stood solidly behind Tulayha, but the Tayy were not so staunch in their support of Tulayha, and their chief, Adi ibn Hatim, was a devout Muslim. Adi was appointed by Abu Bakr to negotiate with the tribal elders to withdraw their contingent from Tulayha&#x27;s army. The negotiations were a success, and Adi brought with him 500 horsemen of his tribe to reinforce Khalid&#x27;s army.

Khalid next marched against another apostate tribe, Jadila. Here again, Adi ibn Hatim offered his services to persuade the tribe to submit without bloodshed. Bani Jadila submitted, and their 1000 warriors joined Khalid&#x27;s army. Khalid, now much stronger than when he had left Zhu Qissa, marched for Buzakha. There, in mid-September 632, he defeated Tulayha in the Battle of Buzakha. The remaining army of Tulayha retreated to Ghamra, 20 miles from Buzakha, and was defeated in the Battle of Ghamra in the third week of September.

Several tribes submitted to the Caliph after Khalid&#x27;s decisive victories. Moving south from Buzakha, Khalid reached Naqra in October, with an army now 6000 strong, and defeated the rebel tribe of Banu Saleem in the Battle of Naqra. In the third week of October, Khalid defeated a tribal chieftess, Salma, in the battle of Zafar.

Afterwards, he moved to Najd against the rebel tribe of Banu Tamim and their Sheikh Malik ibn Nuwayrah. At Najd, getting the news of Khalid&#x27;s decisive victories against apostates in Buzakha, many clans of Banu Tamim hastened to visit Khalid, but the Banu Yarbu&#x27;, a branch of Banu Tamim, under their chief, Malik ibn Nuwayrah, hung back. Malik was a chief of some distinction: a warrior, noted for his generosity, and a famous poet. Bravery, generosity, and poetry were the three qualities most admired among the Arabs. At the time of Muhammad, he had been appointed as a tax collector for the tribe of Banu Tamim. As soon as Malik heard of the death of Muhammad he gave back all the tax to his tribespeople, saying &quot;Now you are the owner of your wealth.&quot; Moreover, he was to be charged because he signed a pact with the anti-Islamic prophet Sajjah. This agreement stated that first, they would deal with local enemy tribes together, and then they would confront the state of Madinah.

His riders were stopped by Khalid&#x27;s army at the town of Buttah. Khalid asked them about the signing of pact with Sajjah; they said it was just because they wanted revenge against their terrible enemies. When Khalid reached Najd he found no opposing army. He sent his cavalry to nearby villages and ordered them to call the Athaan to each party they meet.

Zirrar bin Azwar, a squadron leader, arrested the family of Malik, claiming they did not answer the call to prayer. Malik avoided direct contact with Khalid&#x27;s army and ordered his followers to scatter, and he and his family apparently moved away across the desert. He refused to give zakat, hence differentiating between prayer and zakat. Nevertheless, Malik was accused of rebellion against the state of Medina. He was also to be charged for his entering in an anti-Caliphate alliance with the anti-Islamic prophetess Sajjah. Malik was arrested along with his clansmen.

Malik was asked by Khalid about his crimes. Malik&#x27;s response was &quot;your master said this, your master said that&quot;, referring to Abu Bakr. Khalid declared Malik a rebel apostate and ordered his execution. Khalid bin Walid killed Malik ibn Nuwayra.

Ikrimah ibn Abi-Jahl, one of the corps commanders, was instructed to make contact with Musaylima at Yamamah, but not to engage in fighting until Khalid joined him. Abu Bakr&#x27;s intention in giving Ikrimah this mission was to tie Musaylima down at Yamamah. With Ikrimah on the horizon, Musaylima would remain in expectation of a Muslim attack, and thus not be able to leave his base. With Musaylima so committed, Khalid would be free to deal with the apostate tribes of north-central Arabia without interference from Yamamah. Meanwhile, Abu Bakr sent Shurhabil&#x27;s corps to reinforce Ikrama at Yamamah.

However, Ikrimah attacked Musaylima&#x27;s forces in early September 632 and was defeated. He wrote the details of his actions to Abu Bakr, who, both pained and angered by the rashness of Ikrimah and his disobedience, ordered him to proceed with his force to Oman to assist Hudaifa; once Hudaifa had completed his task, to march to Mahra to help Arfaja, and thereafter go to Yemen to help Muhajir.

Meanwhile, Abu Bakr sent orders to Khalid to march against Musaylima. Shurhabil&#x27;s corps, that was stationed at Yamamah, was to reinforce Khalid&#x27;s corps. In addition to this Abu Bakr assembled a fresh army of Ansar and Muhajireen in Medina that joined Khalid&#x27;s corps at Butah. From Butah Khalid marched to Yamamah to join with Shurhabil&#x27;s corps. Though Abu Bakr had instructed Shurhabil not to engage Musaylima&#x27;s forces until the arrival of Khalid, shortly before the arrival of Khalid, Shurhabil engaged Musaylima&#x27;s forces and was defeated too.

Khalid joined with the corps of Shurhabil early in December 632. The combined force of Muslims, now 13,000 strong, defeated Musaylima&#x27;s army in the Battle of Yamamah, which was fought in the third week of December. The fortified city of Yamamah surrendered peacefully later that week. Khalid established his headquarters at Yamamah, from where he despatched columns to all over the plain of Aqraba to subdue the region around Yamamah and to kill or capture all who resisted. Thereafter all of central Arabia submitted to Medina. What remained of the apostasy in the less vital areas of Arabia was rooted out by the Muslims in a series of well-planned campaigns within five months.

==== Post–Ridda wars, until the 10th century ====
Muhammad&#x27;s followers rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim rule beyond Arabia, conquering huge swathes of territory from the Iberian Peninsula in the west to modern day Pakistan in the east in a matter of decades. The bulk of the tribes that helped the Caliphate&#x27;s expansion into Persia and the Levant were composed of Najdi tribes such as Banu Tamim. The Caliphate&#x27;s use of these once-rebellious tribes allowed Abu Bakr and Umar to quickly deploy battle hardened men and experienced generals such as Al-Qa&#x27;qa&#x27; ibn Amr al-Tamimi into the front-lines against the Persians and Byzantines.

Najd soon became a politically peripheral region of the Muslim world as the focus shifted to the outside of the peninsula. Many of members of the conquering tribes of Najd soon shifted into the Levant, Persia and North Africa, playing a role in future conflicts in the caliphate, becoming governors and even birthing emirates such as the Aghlabids. Migrations continued throughout the centuries back and forth from Nejd to Iraq and the Levant, with many Najdi tribes reaching Khorosan and the Maghreb.

=== Modern history ===
In the 16th century, the Ottomans added the Red Sea and Persian Gulf coast (the Hejaz, Asir and al-Ahsa) to the Empire and claimed suzerainty over the interior. One reason was to thwart Portuguese attempts to attack the Red Sea (hence the Hejaz) and the Indian Ocean.

Ottoman control over these lands varied over the next four centuries with the fluctuating strength or weakness of the Empire&#x27;s central authority. The emergence of what was to become the Saudi royal family, known as the Al Saud, began in Najd in central Arabia in 1744, when Muhammad bin Saud, founder of the dynasty, joined forces with the religious leader Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, founder of the Wahhabi movement, a strict puritanical form of Sunni Islam.

This alliance formed in the 18th century provided the ideological impetus to Saudi expansion and remains the basis of Saudi Arabian dynastic rule today. The first &quot;Saudi state&quot; established in 1744 in the area around Riyadh rapidly expanded and briefly controlled most of the present-day territory of Saudi Arabia, but was destroyed by 1818 by the Ottoman viceroy of Egypt, Mohammed Ali Pasha.

A much smaller second &quot;Saudi state&quot;, located mainly in Nejd, was established in 1824 by Turki bn Abdullah. Throughout the rest of the 19th century, the Al Saud contested control of the interior of what was to become Saudi Arabia with another Arabian ruling family, the Al Rashid. By 1891, the Al Rashid were victorious and the Al Saud were driven into exile in Kuwait.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the Ottoman Empire continued to control or have suzerainty over most of the peninsula. Subject to this suzerainty, Arabia was ruled by a patchwork of tribal rulers, with the Sharif of Mecca having pre-eminence and ruling the Hejaz.

In 1902, Abdul Rahman&#x27;s son, AbdulAziz—later to be known to the west as Ibn Saud—recaptured control of Riyadh, bringing the Al Saud back to Najd. Ibn Saud gained the support of the Ikhwan, a tribal army inspired by Wahhabism, and which had grown quickly after its foundation in 1912. With the aid of the Ikhwan, Ibn Saud captured al-Ahsa from the Ottomans in 1913.

In 1916, with the encouragement and support of Britain (which was fighting the Ottomans in World War I), the Sharif of Mecca, Hussein bin Ali, led a pan-Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire to create a united Arab state. Although this revolt failed in its objective, the Allied victory in World War I resulted in the end of Ottoman suzerainty and control in Arabia.

Ibn Saud avoided involvement in the Arab Revolt and instead continued his struggle with the Al Rashid. Following the latter&#x27;s final defeat, he took the title Sultan of Najd in 1921. With the help of the Ikhwan, the Hejaz was conquered in 1924–25 and on 10 January 1926, Ibn Saud declared himself King of the Hejaz. A year later, he added the title of King of Nejd. For the next five years, he administered the two parts of his dual kingdom as separate units.

After the conquest of the Hejaz, the Ikhwan leadership turned to expansion of the Wahhabist realm into the British protectorates of Transjordan, Iraq and Kuwait, and began raiding those territories. This met with Ibn Saud&#x27;s opposition, as he recognized the danger of a direct conflict with the British. At the same time, the Ikhwan became disenchanted with Ibn Saud&#x27;s domestic policies, which appeared to favor modernization and the increase in the number of non-Muslim foreigners in the country. As a result, they turned against Ibn Saud and, after a two-year struggle, were defeated in 1930 at the Battle of Sabilla, where their leaders were massacred. In 1932 the two kingdoms of the Hejaz and Nejd were united as the modern-day Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

== Geography ==
=== Boundaries ===
The exact boundaries of Najd cannot be precisely determined due to varying geographical and political limits throughout history. It is roughly bounded by the Hejaz region in the west, the Nafud desert in al-Jawf to the North, ad-Dahna Desert in al-Ahsa of Eastern Arabia to the east, and the Empty Quarter to the south.

Medieval Muslim geographers spent a great amount of time debating the exact boundaries between Hejaz and Najd in particular, but generally set the western boundaries of Najd to be wherever the western mountain ranges and lava beds began to slope eastwards, and set the eastern boundaries of Najd at the narrow strip of red sand dunes known as the Ad-Dahna Desert, some east of modern-day Riyadh. The southern border of Najd has always been set at the large sea of sand dunes known today as Rub&#x27; al Khali (the Empty Quarter), while the southwestern boundaries are marked by the valleys of Wadi Ranyah, Wadi Bisha, and Wadi Tathlith.

The northern boundaries of Najd have fluctuated greatly over time and received far less attention from the medieval geographers. In the early Islamic centuries, Najd was considered to extend as far north as the River Euphrates, or more specifically, the &quot;Walls of Khosrau&quot;, constructed by the Sassanid Empire as a barrier between Arabia and Iraq immediately prior to the advent of Islam. The modern usage of the term encompasses the region of Al-Yamama, which was not always considered part of Najd historically, and became incorporated into the larger definition of Najd in the past centuries.

=== Topography ===

Najd is a plateau ranging from in height and sloping downwards from west to east. The eastern sections (historically better known as Al-Yamama) are marked by oasis settlements with much farming and trading activities, while the rest has traditionally been sparsely occupied by nomadic Bedouins. The main topographical features include the twin mountains of Aja and Salma in the north near Ha&#x27;il, the high land of Jabal Shammar and the Tuwaiq mountain range running through its center from north to south. Also important are the various dry river-beds (&quot;wadis&quot;) such as Wadi Hanifa near Riyadh, Wadi Na&#x27;am in the south, Wadi Al-Rumah in the Al-Qassim Province in the north, and Wadi ad-Dawasir at the southernmost tip of Najd on the border with Najran. Most Najdi villages and settlements are located along these wadis, due to ability of these wadis to preserve precious rainwater in the arid desert climate, while others are located near oases.
Historically, Najd itself has been divided into small provinces made up of constellations of small towns, villages and settlements, with each one usually centered on one &quot;capital&quot;. These subdivisions are still recognized by Najdis today, as each province retains its own variation of the Najdi dialect and Najdi customs. The most prominent among these provinces are Al-&#x27;Aridh, which includes Riyadh and the historical Saudi capital of Diriyah; Al-Qassim, with its capital in Buraidah; Sudair, centered on Al Majma&#x27;ah; Al-Washm, centered on Shaqra; and Jebel Shammar, with its capital, Ha&#x27;il. Under modern-day Saudi Arabia, however, Najd is divided into three administrative regions: Ha&#x27;il, Al-Qassim, and Riyadh, comprising a combined area of .

== Culture ==
===Architecture===

The architecture of Najd is a type vernacular architecture. The style flourished roughly between 13th and 18th centuries and is known for its desert adaptive urban patterns with low-contour earth-structured mudbrick buildings that are characterized by elements such as triangular or rectangular openings (&quot;furjat&quot;) and battlements (&quot;shurfat&quot;) as well as peepholes projecting outward from the main façade (&quot;tarma&quot;). The presence of a central courtyard and open spaces also forms a distinct part of the architectural style. The influence of Najdi style can be felt in neighboring regions, such as Kuwait and inland Qatar.

== Demographics ==
=== Social and ethnic groups ===
Unlike the Hejaz and Tihamah, Najd is remote and stayed outside of the realm of important Islamic empires such as the Abbasids and the Ottoman Empire. This historical separation largely shaped its current dissimilarity to Hejaz.

=== Religion ===
The region is traditionally known as a Hanbali stronghold, and after the 18th century became known for its strict interpretation of Islam and is generally considered a bastion of religious conservatism. The founder of the interpretation of Salafism, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, was born in &#x27;Uyayna, a village in the Najd.

The majority of people in the region consider themselves as Salafi Muslims. The name derives from advocating a return to the traditions of the &quot;ancestors&quot; (salaf), the first three generations of Muslims said to know the &quot;purest&quot; form of Islam. Those generations include the Islamic prophet Muhammad and his companions (the Sahabah), their successors (the Tabi‘un), and the successors of the successors (the Taba al-Tabi‘in). Practically, Salafis maintain that Muslims ought to rely on the Qur&#x27;an, the Sunnah and the &#x27;Ijma (consensus) of the salaf, giving them precedence over later Islamic hermeneutic teachings.

====In the &quot;Hadith&quot;====

According to two narrations in Sahih Bukhari, Prophet Muhammad asks Allah to bless the areas of Bilad al-Sham (Syria) and Yemen. When his companions said &quot;Our Najd as well,&quot; he replied: There will appear earthquakes and afflictions, and from there will come out the side of the head (i.e. horns) of Satan. 
In a similar narration, Muhammad again asked Allah to bless the areas Medina, Mecca, Sham, and Yemen and, when asked specifically to bless Najd, repeated similar comments about there being earthquakes, trials, tribulations, and the horns of Satan.
&quot;O Allaah bestow your blessings on our Shaam. O Allaah bestow your blessings on our Yemen.&quot; The people said, &quot;O Messenger of Allaah, and our Najd.&quot; I think the third time the Prophet, sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam, said, &quot;There (in Najd) will occur earthquakes, trials and tribulations, and from there appears the Horn of Satan.&quot;

The according to the Islamic scholar and Grand mufti of Saudi Arabia, Ibn Baz, the hadith is &quot;Sahih&quot; (correct).

== Language ==

The people of Najd have spoken Arabic, in one form or another, for practically all of recorded history. As in other regions of the peninsula, there is a divergence between the dialect of the nomadic Bedouins and the dialect of the sedentary townspeople. The variation, however, is far less pronounced in Najd than it is elsewhere in the country, and the Najdi sedentary dialect may be either a descended from the Bedouin dialect, or due to similar conditions of isolation from foreign influence, they share similar isolated features being related dialects. The Najdi dialect is seen by some to be the least foreign-influenced of all modern Arabic dialects, due to the isolated location and harsh climate of the Najdi plateau, as well as the apparent absence of any substratum from a previous language. Indeed, not even the ancient South Arabian language appears to have been widely spoken in Najd in ancient times, unlike southern Saudi Arabia, for example.

Within Najd itself, the different regions and towns have their own distinctive accents and sub-dialects. However, these have largely merged in recent times and have become heavily influenced by Arabic dialects from other regions and countries. This is particularly the case in Riyadh.

== Economy ==
In the early 20th century, Najd produced coarse wool cloth, dates and a wide range of other agricultural products.

== In popular culture ==
A contest held in the Middle East brought light to a new character in famed SNK Playmore video game, &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot;. This character goes under the name Najd.

<text>Ronald Edward George Davies (3 July 1921 – 30 July 2011) was an English writer who was a specialist in airline and air transport history, and commercial aviation economic research.

==Biography==
Educated at Shaftesbury Grammar School, he started work in London in 1938, and was in the British Army as a territorial volunteer from 1939 to 1946. He spent a year in Iceland, training for mountain and Arctic warfare, and drove his machine-gun carrier on to the beach in Normandy in 1944. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Davies made his first airplane trip in 1948. Subsequently, he worked for the Ministry of Civil Aviation, British European Airways, the Bristol Aeroplane Company and de Havilland before moving to the United States in 1968 to lead market research for Douglas Aircraft. A lifelong aviation enthusiast, Davies dedicated his work to different aspects of the airline industry, including traffic forecasting, and specializing in its history. He researched airlines at the National Air and Space Museum as the Charles A. Lindbergh Chair in Aerospace History in 1981–1982.

Davies was responsible, alongside artist Mike Machat, for the book series &quot;An Airline and its Aircraft&quot;, about selected airlines&#x27; histories, including the types flown. His writing led him to found Paladwr Press, which published 38 books of classic airline histories and biographies.

Well travelled to more than a hundred countries, Davies was a member of three British Royal Societies, the Explorers Club, and others in France and Brazil. He enjoyed a 30-year career as the Curator of Air Transport at the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum, and continued to write and publish airline history throughout that time. A member of the Washington Airline Society, he gave lectures, and provided assistance to airline researchers. His 25th book &quot;Airlines of the Jet Age: A History&quot; was published in July 2011, just before he died aged 90.

Davies retired in 2011 and returned to England, where he died in July of that year. His collection is held by the National Air and Space Museum.

<text>The Uqair Protocol or Uqair Convention was an agreement at Uqair on 2 December 1922 that defined the boundaries between Mandatory Iraq, the Sultanate of Nejd and Sheikhdom of Kuwait. It was made by Percy Cox, the British High Commissioner to Iraq, in response to Ikhwan raiders from Nejd under Ibn Saud attacking Kuwait. Cox met ibn Saud and Major John More, the British Political Agent to Kuwait. The boundaries included a Saudi–Iraqi neutral zone and a Saudi–Kuwaiti neutral zone.

Kuwait was not permitted any role in the outcome of the Uqair agreement when the Saudis and British decided Kuwait&#x27;s modern boundaries. Kuwait lost more than two thirds of its territory as a result of the agreement, as well as its second largest town, the port of Manifa. The loss of territory made anti-British sentiment grow in Kuwait.

<doc id="178727" wikidata="Q1031244" url="?curid=178727" title="Tute Bianche">
<text>Tute Bianche (English: White Overalls) was a militant Italian social movement active from 1994 to 2001. Activists were notable for covering their bodies with white padding so as to resist the blows of police, pushing through police lines, and marching together in large blocks for mutual protection during political demonstrations.

== Name ==
The name stems from an early demonstration (initiated by a loose group of Italian anti-globalization activists called the Ya Basta Association), involving the group defense of a squatted social center (Italian: &quot;centro sociale autogestito&quot;, CSO or CSOA, meaning &quot;occupied social centre&quot;), in which demonstrators wore white overalls to evoke the ghosts that would haunt the ghost town police proposed to make of the social center. The padding tactic, adopted later, is also referred to as a padded bloc tactic. It was first used in September 2000 by other activists during the anti-globalization protests in Prague. About the movement&#x27;s name and colour, the Milan collective of the Ya Basta Association explained: &quot;If the struggle aims at achieving visibility, the colour of the fight is white, and the white garment covers the whole body.&quot;

== Activity ==
Central to the Tute Bianche movement was the Italian Ya Basta Association, a network of groups throughout Italy that were inspired by the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) uprising in Chiapas in 1994. Ya Basta primarily originated in the autonomist social centres of Milan, particularly Centro Sociale Leoncavallo. These social centres grew out of the Italian autonomist movement of the 1970 and 1980s. The Tute Bianche philosophy was based on a specific reading of Italian political/social history, including the idea that the traditional protest tactic of marching and &quot;bearing witness&quot; to power had outlived its usefulness, and a more confrontational militant form of non-violent protest was required to not only re-invigorate the anti-globalization movement but also to redefine how street resistance is understood. The Tute Bianche movement reached its apex in July 2001 during the protests at the 27th G8 summit, with a turn-out of an estimated 10,000 protesters in a single &quot;padded block&quot;, after a collective decision to go without the white overalls. Shortly after the anti-G8 Genoa protests, the Ya Basta Association disbanded, with certain segments reforming into the Disobbedienti (Disobedients). This philosophy includes the occupation and creation of squatted self-managed social centres, anti-sexist activism, support for immigrant rights and refugees seeking political asylum, as well as the process of walking together in large formations during demonstrations held in the streets, by force if necessary in case of clashes with police. The Tute Bianche have had international variations of one sort or another. For instance, &quot;Mono Blanco&quot; was the preferred identifier in Spain. The first North American variant of the Tute Bianche, the NYC Ya Basta Collective wore yellow overalls rather than white. A British group calling itself the WOMBLES (White Overalls Movement Building Libertarian Effective Struggles) adopted the Tute Bianche&#x27;s tactics.

<text>The 1938 British Empire Games were the third British Empire Games, the event that evolved to become the Commonwealth Games. Held in Sydney, Australia from 5–12 February 1938, they were timed to coincide with Sydney&#x27;s sesqui-centenary (150 years since the foundation of British settlement in Australia). Venues included the Sydney Cricket Ground (the main stadium), the Sydney Sports Ground, North Sydney Olympic Pool and Henson Park. An estimated 40,000 people attended the opening ceremony. A competitors&#x27; residential village was established within the grounds of the Sydney Showground.

The star of the games was the Australian athlete Decima Norman, who won five gold medals in track and field. Margaret Dovey, later married to Australian prime minister Gough Whitlam, finished sixth in the 220 yards breaststroke.

Due to the onset of World War II, the games were not held again until 1950.

<doc id="178731" wikidata="Q7605950" url="?curid=178731" title="Steer wrestling">
<text>Steer wrestling, also known as bulldogging, is a rodeo event in which a horse-mounted rider chases a steer, drops from the horse to the steer, then wrestles the steer to the ground by grabbing its horns and pulling it off-balance so that it falls to the ground. The event carries a high risk of injury to the cowboy. Some concerns from the animal-rights community express that the competition may include practices that constitute cruelty to animals, but the injury rate to animals is less than 0.05%. A later PRCA survey of 60,971 animal performances at 198 rodeo performances and 73 sections of &quot;slack&quot; indicated 27 animals were injured, again around 0.05%.

==Origins==
The origins of steer wrestling or “bulldogging” date back to Ancient Greece in bull-fighting events known as &quot;taurokathápsia&quot; (ταυροκαθάψια), where bull fighters on horseback would chase a bull and jump on it, grasping its horns before wrestling it to the ground. In &quot;The Garland of Phillip&quot;, Philippus of Thessalonica recounts how the bullfighters of Thessaly performed this feat: The well-mounted troupe of bull-fighters from Thessaly, armed against the beasts with no weapons but their hands, spur their horses to run alongside the galloping bull, bent on throwing round its neck the noose of their arms. At the same time pulling it towards the ground by thus hanging themselves at the end of its neck and weighing down its head, they roll over even such a powerful brute”

Historically, steer wrestling was not a part of ranch life. The event originated in the 1890s, and is claimed to have been started by a Black cowboy named Bill Pickett, a wild-west show performer said to have caught a runaway steer by wrestling it to the ground. The several versions of the story have some claiming that he developed the idea after he observed how cattle dogs worked with unruly animals.

==Modern event==
The event features a steer and two mounted cowboys, along with a number of supporting characters. The steers are moved through narrow pathways leading to a chute with spring-loaded doors. A barrier rope is fastened around the steer&#x27;s neck, which is used to ensure that the steer gets a head start. The rope length is determined by arena length. On one side of the chute is the &quot;hazer&quot;, whose job is to ride parallel with the steer once it begins running and ensure it runs in a straight line, on the other side of the chute the &quot;steer wrestler&quot; or &quot;bulldogger&quot; waits behind a taut rope fastened with an easily broken string fastened to the rope on the steer.

When the steer wrestler is ready, he &quot;calls&quot; for the steer by nodding his head and the chute man trips a lever opening the doors. The suddenly freed steer breaks out running, shadowed by the hazer. When the steer reaches the end of his rope, it pops off and simultaneously releases the barrier for the steer wrestler. The steer wrestler attempts to catch up to the running steer, lean over the side of the horse which is running flat out, and grab the horns of the running steer. The steer wrestler then is pulled off his horse by the slowing steer and plants his heels into the dirt, further slowing the steer and himself. He then takes one hand off the horns, reaches down and grabs the nose of the steer pulling the steer off balance and ultimately &quot;throwing&quot; the steer to the ground. Once all four legs are off the ground, an official waves a flag marking the official end and a time is taken. The steer is released and trots off.

===Technique===
The original method of wrestling the steer to the ground is to lean from the galloping horse running beside the steer, giving the weight of the upper body to the neck to the steer with one hand on the near horn of the steer and the far horn grasped in the crook of the other elbow. One then lets the horse carry his feet by the steer until his feet naturally fall out of the stirrups. The steer wrestler then slides with his feet turned slightly to the left, twisting the head of the steer toward one by pushing down with the near hand and pulling up and in with the far elbow. Finally, the steer wrestler lets go of the near horn, and puts the steer&#x27;s nose in the crook of his left elbow and throws his weight backwards, causing the steer to become unbalanced and fall to the ground.

===Rules===
Rules of steer wrestling include: 
*The bulldogger&#x27;s horse must not break the rope barrier in front of it at the beginning of a run, but must wait for the animal escaping from the adjacent chute to release the rope. Breaking the rope barrier early adds a 10-second penalty to the bulldogger&#x27;s time. 
*If the steer stumbles or falls before the bulldogger brings it down, he must either wait for it to rise or help it up before wrestling it to the ground. *If the bulldogger completely misses the steer on his way down, he will receive a &quot;no time&quot;.

Typical professional times are in the range of 3.0 to 10 seconds from the gates opening to the waving of the flag. The steers used today are generally &quot;corriente&quot; cattle or longhorns, which weigh between 450 and 650 pounds, and the human steer wrestlers typically weigh 180 to 300 pounds. While steer wrestlers have a lower injury rate than bull riders or bronc riders, their injury rate is higher than those of the speed events.

==Animal-welfare concerns==

Like all other rodeo events, steer wrestling is under fire by animal-rights advocates. Modern rodeos in the United States are closely regulated and have responded to accusations of animal cruelty by instituting a number of rules to guide how rodeo animals are to be managed. In 1994, a survey of 28 sanctioned rodeos was conducted by on-site independent veterinarians. Reviewing 33,991 animal runs, the injury rate was documented at 16 animals or 0.047%, less than one in 2000 animals. A study of rodeo animals in Australia found a similar injury rate. Basic injuries occurred at a rate of 0.072%, or one in 1405, with injuries requiring veterinary attention at 0.036%, or one injury in every 2810 times the animal was used, and transport, yarding, and competition were all included in the study. A later PRCA survey of 60,971 animal performances at 198 rodeo performances and 73 sections of &quot;slack&quot; indicated 27 animals were injured, again around 0.05%.

However, accusations of cruelty in the USA persist. The PRCA acknowledges that they only sanction about 30% of all rodeos, while another 50% are sanctioned by other organizations and 20% are completely unsanctioned. Several animal-rights organizations keep records of accidents and incidents of possible animal abuse. They cite various specific incidents of injury to support their statements, and also point to examples of long-term breakdown, as well as reporting on injuries and deaths suffered by animals in nonrodeo events staged on the periphery of professional rodeo such as chuckwagon races and &quot;suicide runs&quot;. In terms of actual statistics on animal injury rate, no more recent independent studies are apparent on animal injury in rodeo than the 1994 study. Groups such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), though, periodically record incidents of animal injury. According to the ASPCA, practice sessions are often the scene of more severe abuses than competitions.

<text>Black propaganda is a form of propaganda intended to create the impression that it was created by those it is supposed to discredit. Black propaganda contrasts with gray propaganda, which does not identify its source, as well as white propaganda, which does not disguise its origins at all. It is typically used to vilify or embarrass the enemy through misrepresentation.

The major characteristic of black propaganda is that the audience are not aware that someone is influencing them, and do not feel that they are being pushed in a certain direction. Black propaganda purports to emanate from a source other than the true source. This type of propaganda is associated with covert psychological operations. Sometimes the source is concealed or credited to a false authority and spreads lies, fabrications, and deceptions. Black propaganda is the &quot;big lie&quot;, including all types of creative deceit. Black propaganda relies on the willingness of the receiver to accept the credibility of the source. If the creators or senders of the black propaganda message do not adequately understand their intended audience, the message may be misunderstood, seem suspect, or fail altogether.

Governments conduct black propaganda for a few reasons. By disguising their direct involvement, a government may be more likely to succeed in convincing an otherwise unbelieving target audience. There are also diplomatic reasons behind the use of black propaganda. Black propaganda is necessary to obfuscate a government&#x27;s involvement in activities that may be detrimental to its foreign policies.

==In the American Revolution==

Benjamin Franklin created and circulated a fake supplement to a Boston newspaper that included letters on Indian atrocities and the treatment of American prisoners.

==In World War II==

===British===
In the United Kingdom, the Political Warfare Executive operated a number of black propaganda radio stations. Gustav Siegfried Eins (GS1) was one of the first such stations—purporting to be a clandestine German station. The speaker, &quot;Der Chef&quot;, purported to be a Nazi extremist, accusing Adolf Hitler and his henchmen of going soft. The station focused on alleged corruption and sexual improprieties of Nazi Party members.

Another example was the British radio station &quot;Soldatensender Calais&quot;, which purported to be a radio station for the Wehrmacht. Under the direction of Sefton Delmer, a British journalist who spoke perfect Berliner German, &quot;Soldatensender Calais&quot; and its associated shortwave station, &quot;Deutscher Kurzwellensender Atlantik&quot;, broadcast music, up-to-date sports scores, speeches of Adolf Hitler for &quot;cover&quot; and subtle propaganda.

Radio Deutschland was another radio station employed by the British during the war aimed and designed to undermine German morale and create tensions that would ultimately disrupt the German war effort. The station was broadcast on a frequency close on the radio dial to an actual German station. During the war most Germans actually believed that this station was in fact a German radio station and it even gained the recognition of Germany&#x27;s propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels.
There were British black propaganda radio stations in most of the languages of occupied Europe as well as German and Italian. Most of these were based in the area around Bletchley Park and Woburn Abbey in Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire respectively.

Another possible example was a rumour that there had been a German attempt to land on British shores at Shingle Street, but it had been repelled with high German casualties. This was reported in the American press, and in William L. Shirer&#x27;s &quot;Berlin Diary&quot; but was officially denied. British papers, declassified in 1993, have suggested this was a successful example of British black propaganda to bolster morale in the UK, US and occupied Europe.

Author James Hayward has proposed that the rumours, which were widely reported in the American press, were a successfully engineered example of black propaganda with an aim of ensuring American co-operation and securing lend lease resources by showing that the United Kingdom was capable of successfully resisting the might of the German Army.

David Hare&#x27;s play &quot;Licking Hitler&quot; provides a fictionalised account based on the British black propaganda efforts in World War II.

===German===
German black propaganda usually took advantage of European racism and anti-Communism. For example, on the night of April 27, 1944, German aircraft under cover of darkness (and possibly carrying fake Royal Air Force markings) dropped propaganda leaflets on occupied Denmark. These leaflets used the title of &quot;Frihedsposten&quot;, a genuine Danish underground newspaper, and claimed that the &quot;hour of liberation&quot; was approaching. They instructed Danes to accept &quot;occupation by Russian or specially trained American Negro soldiers&quot; until the first disorders resulting from military operations were over.

The German Büro Concordia organisation operated several black propaganda radio stations (many of which pretended to broadcast illegally from within the countries they targeted). One of these stations was &quot;Workers&#x27; Challenge&quot; which purported to be a British communist radio station and encouraged British workers to go on strike against their &quot;capitalist&quot; bosses.

===Pacific Theatre===
The &quot;Tanaka Memorial&quot; was a document that described a Japanese plan for world conquest, beginning with the conquest of China. It was widely referenced in official American anti-Japanese propaganda (such as &quot;The Battle of China&quot; and &quot;Know Your Enemy: Japan&quot;), but most historians now believe it was a forgery.

The following message was distributed in black propaganda leaflets dropped by the Japanese over the Philippines in World War II. It was designed to turn Filipinos against the United States:

==Cold War black propaganda==
===Soviet Union===
Prior to, and during the Cold War, the Soviet Union used disinformation on multiple occasions, employing the KGB&#x27;s Service A of the First Chief Directorate in order to conduct its covert, or &quot;black&quot;, &quot;active measures&quot;. It was Service A that was responsible for clandestine campaigns that were targeted at foreign governments, public populations, as well as to influence individuals and specific groups that were hostile towards the Soviet government and its policies. The majority of their operations was actually conducted by other elements and directorates of the KGB.

===United Kingdom===
Declassified documents have revealed that the British government ran a secret black propaganda campaign for decades, targeting Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia with leaflets and reports from fake sources aimed at destabilising cold war enemies by encouraging racial tensions, sowing chaos, inciting violence and reinforcing anti-communist ideas.

====Indonesia====
One of the British campaigns played a part in the Indonesian mass killings of 1965–66, one of the worst mass murders of the 20th century. This tragedy was fuelled by black information written by British operatives based in Singapore. Exploiting a failed coup attempt by a palace guard, these operatives falsely blamed the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) and the ethnic Chinese. Despite no evidence linking the PKI to the coup, they posed as exiled Indonesian patriots and incited violence by accusing them of involvement and called for their &quot;elimination&quot;. Subsequently, mass killings targeting Indonesian people, PKI members, and followers of Sukarno ensued, resulting in an estimated death toll of at least 500,000.

===United States===
Following the September 11 attacks against the United States, the U.S. Department of Defense organized and implemented the Office of Strategic Influence in an effort to improve public support abroad, mainly in Muslim countries. The head of OSI was USAF General Pete Worden, who maintained a mission described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;circulating classified proposals calling for aggressive campaigns that use[d] not only the foreign media and the Internet, but also covert operations&quot;. Worden and then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld planned for what Pentagon officials said was &quot;a broad mission ranging from &#x27;black&#x27; campaigns that use[d] disinformation and other covert activities to &#x27;white&#x27; public affairs that rely on truthful news releases&quot;. The OSI&#x27;s operations were more than public relations work in that they included contacting and emailing media, journalists, and foreign community leaders with information which would counter foreign governments and organizations hostile to the United States. In doing so, the emails would be masked by using addresses ending with .com as opposed to using the standard Pentagon address of .mil, and hide any involvement of the US government and the Pentagon. The thought of conducting black propaganda operations and utilizing disinformation resulted in harsh criticism for the program that resulted in its closure in 2002.

==In domestic politics==

===Australian media===
* In the run-up to the 2007 federal election in Australia, flyers were circulated around Sydney under the name of a fake organisation called the Islamic Australia Federation. The flyers thanked the Australian Labor Party for supporting terrorism, Islamic fundamentalists, and the Bali bombing suspects. A group of Sydney-based Liberal Party members were implicated in the incident.

===British media===
* In November 1995, a &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; newspaper article alleged Libya&#x27;s Saif al-Islam Gaddafi (Muammar Gaddafi&#x27;s son) was connected to currency counterfeiting. The story&#x27;s author, Con Coughlin, falsely attributed the claim to a &quot;British banking official&quot;, but his information actually came from MI6 agents. This fact, and the fact that Coughlin had no other sources for the story, only came to light when Saif Gaddafi later sued the newspaper for libel.
* The Zinoviev letter was a fake letter published in 1924 in the British newspaper the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. It claimed to be a letter from the Comintern president Grigory Zinoviev to the Communist Party of Great Britain. It called on Communists to mobilise &quot;sympathetic forces&quot; in the Labour Party and talked of creating dissent in the British Armed Forces. The Zinoviev letter was instrumental in the Conservative victory in the 1924 general election. The letter seemed authentic at the time, but historians now believe it was a forgery. Historians now agree that the letter had little impact on the Labour vote—which held up in 1924. However, it aided the Conservative Party in hastening the collapse of the Liberal Party that led to the Conservative landslide.

===United States media===
* In the &quot;Roorback forgery&quot; of 1844 the &quot;Chronicle&quot; of Ithaca, New York ran a story, supposedly by a German tourist called Baron von Roorback, that James K. Polk, standing for re-election as a Democrat to the United States House of Representatives, branded his slaves before selling them at auction to distinguish them from the others on sale. Polk actually benefited from the ploy, as it reflected badly on his opponents when the lie was found out. Afterwards the term &quot;Roorback&quot; was coined for political dirty tricks.
* During the 1972 U.S. presidential election, Donald H. Segretti, a political operative for President Richard Nixon&#x27;s reelection campaign, released a faked letter, on Senator Edmund Muskie&#x27;s letterhead, falsely alleging that Senator Henry &quot;Scoop&quot; Jackson, against whom Muskie was running for the Democratic Party&#x27;s nomination, had had an illegitimate child with a seventeen-year-old. Muskie, who had been considered the frontrunner, lost the nomination to George McGovern, and Nixon was reelected. The letter was part of a campaign of so-called &quot;dirty tricks&quot;, directed by Segretti, and uncovered as part of the Watergate Scandal. Segretti went to prison in 1974 after pleading guilty to three misdemeanor counts of distributing illegal campaign literature. Another of his dirty tricks was the &quot;Canuck letter&quot;, although this was libel of Muskie and not a black propaganda piece.

===United States Government===
* The Federal Bureau of Investigation&#x27;s counter-intelligence program COINTELPRO was intended to, according to the FBI, &quot;expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise neutralize the activities of black nationalists, hate-type organizations and groups, their leadership, membership, and supporters&quot;. Black propaganda was used on Communists and the Black Panther Party. It was also used against opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, labor leaders, and Native Americans. The FBI&#x27;s strategy was captured in a 1968 memo: &quot;Consider the use of cartoons, photographs, and anonymous letters which will have the effect of ridiculing the New Left. Ridicule is one of the most potent weapons which we can use against it.&quot;
* &quot;The Penkovsky Papers&quot; are an example of a black propaganda effort conducted by the United States&#x27; Central Intelligence Agency during the 1960s. The &quot;Penkovsky Papers&quot; were alleged to have been written by a Soviet GRU defector, Colonel Oleg Penkovsky, but were in fact produced by the CIA in an effort to diminish the Soviet Union&#x27;s credibility at a pivotal time during the Cold War.

===Religious black propaganda===
* In 1955, the Church of Scientology published the book &quot;Brain-Washing&quot;, which was allegedly written by the Soviet secret police chief Lavrentiy Beria. In fact, the book describes all of the practices Scientology opposes (brain surgery, psychiatric drugs, psychology, child labor laws, and income tax) as Communist conspiracies directed by Moscow, and it describes the greatest threat to &quot;Communism&quot; as being &quot;The Church of Scientology&quot; (the Catholic Church is barely mentioned as a threat to the Soviet Union, and the Eastern Orthodox Church, the dominant religion of the Soviet Union, is not mentioned at all). Additionally, &quot;Beria&quot; uses precise phrases that L. Ron Hubbard (creator of scientology) has coined, such as &quot;pain-drug hypnosis&quot; and &quot;thinkingness&quot;.
* The Church of Scientology, under the leadership of L. Ron Hubbard, is alleged to have advocated the usage of &quot;black propaganda&quot; to &quot;destroy reputation or public belief in persons, companies or nations&quot; as a practice of &quot;fair game&quot; against suppressive persons. After the author Paulette Cooper wrote &quot;The Scandal of Scientology&quot;, the Church of Scientology ran a false flag operation that stole stationery from her in order to fabricate bomb threats.

===Environmentalist black propaganda===

* The &quot;Let&#x27;s Go! Shell in the Arctic&quot; website was designed to look like an official website by Royal Dutch Shell, but was in fact a fake produced by Greenpeace.

<text>The 1950 British Empire Games were the fourth staging of what is now called the Commonwealth Games. It was held in Auckland, New Zealand, between 4 and 11 February 1950, after a 12-year gap from the third edition of the games. A documentary film of the games was made by the New Zealand National Film Unit. The main venue was Eden Park, although the closing ceremonies were held at Western Springs Stadium, see New Zealand at the 1950 British Empire Games. The fourth games were originally awarded to Montreal, Canada and were to be held in 1942 but were cancelled due to World War II.

<doc id="178743" wikidata="Q643190" url="?curid=178743" title="Subvertising">
<text>Subvertising (a portmanteau of &quot;subvert&quot; and &quot;advertising&quot;) is the practice of making spoofs or parodies of corporate and political advertisements. The cultural critic Mark Dery coined the term in 1991. Subvertisements are anti-ads that deflect advertising&#x27;s attempts to turn the people&#x27;s attention in a given direction. According to author Naomi Klein, subvertising offers a way of speaking back to advertising, ‘forcing a dialogue where before there was only a declaration.’ They may take the form of a new image or an alteration to an existing image or icon, often in a satirical manner.

A subvertisement can also be referred to as a meme hack and can be a part of social hacking, billboard hacking or culture jamming. According to &quot;Adbusters&quot;, a Canadian magazine and a proponent of counter-culture and subvertising, &quot;A well-produced &#x27;subvert&#x27; mimics the look and feel of the targeted ad, promoting the classic &#x27;double-take&#x27; as viewers suddenly realize they have been duped. Subverts create cognitive dissonance, with the apparent aim of cutting through the &#x27;hype and glitz of our mediated reality&#x27; to reveal a &#x27;deeper truth within&#x27;.

Subvertising is a type of &quot;advertising hijacking&quot; (&quot;détournement publicité&quot;), where détournement techniques developed in the 1950s by the French Letterist International and later used by the better-known Situationist International have been used as a contemporary critical form to re-route advertising messages.
==Notable instances==

In 1972, the logo of Richard Nixon&#x27;s re-election campaign posters was subverted with two x&#x27;s in Nixon&#x27;s name (as in the Exxon logo) to suggest the corporate ownership of the Republican party.

In Sydney, Australia in October 1979, a group of anti-smoking activists formed a group called B.U.G.A.U.P. and began altering the text on tobacco billboards to subvert the messages of tobacco advertisers, although advertisements for other unhealthy products were also targeted.

On November 6, 2008, The Yes Men recruited thousands of social activists to hand out 100,000 copies of a spoof &quot;New York Times&quot; newspaper set six months in the future. The goal was to utilize a tangible and trusted medium, the &quot;New York Times&quot;, to argue for a particular future, in that case, one where the Iraq War had ended. Other groups involved with this project included Anti-Advertising Agency, Code Pink, United for Peace and Justice, May First/People Link, and Improv Everywhere.

At the 2015 Paris COP21 climate conference, the collective known as Brandalism installed 600 posters that attacked what they perceived as the hypocrisy of corporate sponsors.

In 2017, Brandalism and other groups of subvertisers founded the collective Subvertisers International. Using billboard hacking and other forms of subvertising, they promote the idea that advertising creates unhealthy body images, impacts democracy negatively, and sustains a culture of consumerism that takes a heavy toll on the planet.

Around 2018, a group in London called Legally Black changed the race of the characters in Harry Potter posters from white to black.

In 2022, billboards in London, Bristol, Manchester, Sheffield, Brighton, and 11 other European cities, were hijacked to highlight the role of airline emissions in the Climate crisis. They highlighted the large carbon footprint of flying, that the majority of flights are taken by a tiny fraction of the total population, and that airlines have missed all but one of the industry’s self-imposed sustainability targets.

In January 2025, German police began investigating the distribution of political fliers from the farright Alternative für Deutschland party that closely resembled airline tickets and targeted &quot;illegal immigrants&quot;. The fliers were placed in the mailboxes of people living in immigrant areas. Karlsruhe criminal police said they are seeking &quot;persons unknown on suspicion of incitement of racial hatred&quot;.

<doc id="178744" wikidata="Q1120635" url="?curid=178744" title="Community management">
<text>Community management or common-pool resource management is the management of a common resource or issue by a community through the collective action of volunteers and stakeholders. The resource managed can be either material or informational. Examples include the management of common grazing and water rights, fisheries, and open-source software. In the case of physical resources, community management strategies are frequently employed to avoid the tragedy of the commons and to encourage sustainability.

It is expected that community management allows for the management, usually of natural resources, to come from members of the community that these decisions will affect. This should allow for a better way of finding solutions that the community will find most effective since management styles are not always transferable across different regions; and this could be because of cultural, economic, or geographical differences. It is expected that the group members within this setting have the incentive to do the best they can for the community because they live in the community that benefits or suffers from the management they provide. By decentralizing the management of resources, it is also expected that the upkeep that occurs within the services provided is streamlined due to the direct link between the areas that need improvement or regular maintenance and the authority overseeing them. However, these expected benefits of community management are not what we see unfolding within communities that follow this management style.

==Common pool problem==

Without proper management, a community&#x27;s material resources may be depleted or rendered unusable. The common pool problem is an economic situation which exists when goods are rival, but non-exclusive (See common-pool resource). Since these resources are owned in common, individuals have no private incentive to preserve them, but rather will seek to exploit them before others can derive benefit. The classic example is of fish in the ocean; anybody can harvest fish, but a fish that has been caught cannot be caught by another fisherman. Therefore, fishermen will seek to maximize their personal profit by catching as many fish as possible, which will ultimately lead to the stock being depleted. It is similar to the free rider problem in that those who do not contribute to the resource may use it without penalty, but the common pool problem is usually considered an economic &quot;problem&quot; since it will eventually lead to the exhausting of a resource. Another example of the common pool problem involves the shared use of limited internet bandwidth, such as in a university network, when the connectivity of all users is slowed by the heavy usage of a few.

Elinor Ostrom and Oliver E. Williamson won the 2009 Nobel prize in economic science for work in this area, where they suggested that with good community management of shared resources, as found in successful firms, the &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; can be avoided.

==Shared information resources==
Developing open-source software or other collaborative projects such as Wikipedia generally requires some form of community management, whether it involves leadership or egalitarianism. Unlike as is the case with physical resources, the sharing of information does not necessarily deplete the resource. Nonetheless, proper management may be necessary to encourage a network effect, where collaborative use actually enriches the resource, and to avoid conflict.

More generally, community management designates the activity of maintaining communication, motivation, efficiency, and engagement among a group of remote individuals often only linked together by the Internet. Typically, it will contribute to the success of an open-source initiative by keeping forums alive with information, questions, and challenges, by organizing real-life events for virtual communities, or by organizing contests or hackathons to focus all efforts on a common goal. It may also be used to improve motivation and synergy in a large organization (such as a company or a public organization) by creating a sense of belonging and ensuring that members are aware of each other&#x27;s work. Community management requires human skills (a community manager) and the use of tools (e.g., social networks, instant messaging, resource sharing, etc.).

== Problems with Community Management ==
Community management has been a popular strategy utilized in African water management, but research has shown that Africans often don&#x27;t prefer this management style. Main problems of community management, specifically related to water management, consist of potential maintenance issues, population issues, money collecting issues, and a lack of community engagement.

* Community management can create potential maintenance issues that are resolved with less expediency and with less efficiency. This often stems as a result of having a lack of a qualified person to perform the repair or lacking a reliable way to collect money in order to hire someone to do the repair.
* Money collecting issues are a main problem in poorer areas. If not, everyone is paying a fee to use the resources in question, then there won&#x27;t be any money to make repairs when needed. This includes not paying and a lack of an efficient way to pay fees. People will not go out of their way to pay fees so a solid collection strategy is needed.
* General user fees within community managed water supply systems have been found to be not enough to keep the service operational let alone make repairs when needed. Even if citizens have the capacity to pay fees it has been found that many people simply don&#x27;t want to. It is suggested that health concerns about clean drinking water are not enough to create a population of users who are willing to pay user fees let alone maintenance fees when needed.
* Population issues can also cause problems because community management is often more effective on a smaller scale. In other words, communities with smaller populations have an easier time developing effective systems like citizen participation, money collection, or maintenance repairs simply because it is easier to combat the problems that arrive within those areas when there is a smaller group of people affected that need help.
* A lack of community engagement is a chronic issue that arises within community management, as well. In order for community management to be an effective strategy of management style the community must be engaged within the management system in order to reap the community benefits. Despite this, most citizens are not interested in the issues community management organizations are looking to improve, meaning these organizations are getting less input from the community which negates the point of community management.

==Methods of management==

A community may itself be actively developed and managed in order to promote communal activity and welfare.

In some cases, the task of managing a physical resource may be delegated to a specialist professional called a community manager. Meaning members of the community are involved in the development and follow through of community development projects, which can involve acquiring the funding for projects as well as deciding what plans would be beneficial for the community and which ones would not.

Malawi is an example of the utilization of community management to provide water access to citizens. Malawi is a poor area that with recent governmental pushes for decentralization has led to water management becoming a community responsibility. Within Malawi boreholes are used to access water and each of these boreholes is under the control of a committee which delegates a manager for each borehole. These managers receive initial training from an official district water officer but are then left to make their own decisions regarding the upkeep of the borehole. This training has been found to be ineffective in many cases so the work of area mechanics, who are more knowledgeable about these boreholes, are often utilized to perform repairs. However, these area mechanics are not accessible everywhere and require additional payments. Payment is also something that is irregularly collected which has created a lack of funds for repairs.

In the case of internet resources, the privileging of certain kinds of data transfer may ensure a better overall quality of service for most users, as opposed to the doctrine of network neutrality.

<text>The 2006 Commonwealth Games, officially the XVIII Commonwealth Games and commonly known as Melbourne 2006, were an international multi-sport event for members of the Commonwealth held in Melbourne, Australia between 15 and 26 March 2006. It was the fourth time Australia had hosted the Commonwealth Games. It was also the largest sporting event to be staged in Melbourne, eclipsing the 1956 Summer Olympics in terms of the number of teams competing, athletes competing, and events being held.

More than 4,000 athletes from 71 Commonwealth Games Associations took part in the event. Zimbabwe withdrew its membership from the Commonwealth of Nations and Commonwealth Games Federation on 8 December 2003 and so did not participate in the event. With 245 sets of medals, the games featured 17 Commonwealth sports. These sporting events took place at 13 venues in the host city, two venues in Bendigo and one venue each in Ballarat, Geelong, Lysterfield Park and Traralgon.

The site for the opening and closing ceremonies was the Melbourne Cricket Ground, which was also used during the 1956 Olympics. The mascot for the games was Karak, a red-tailed black cockatoo (a threatened species). The official song of the games, &quot;Together We Are One&quot;, was composed by the ARIA awardee Australian recording artist Delta Goodrem. During the closing ceremony of the games, President of the Commonwealth Games Federation Mike Fennell declared to the crowd &quot;Melbourne, you are simply the best&quot;.

For the first time in the history of the Commonwealth Games, the Queen&#x27;s Baton visited every single Commonwealth nation and territory taking part in the Games, a journey of . The relay ended when the Governor of Victoria, and former Commonwealth Games medallist, John Landy delivered the baton to Her Majesty the Queen at the Melbourne Cricket Ground during the opening ceremony.

The host nation Australia topped the medal table for the fifth time in the past five Commonwealth Games, winning the most golds (84) and most medals overall (221). England and Canada finished second and third respectively.

The 2006 Commonwealth Games have been lauded as “best Commonwealth Games ever”. A KPMG analysis of 2006 Commonwealth Games found the event prompted an increase in gross state product of about A$1.6 billion over a 20-year period and employment of about 13,600 jobs.

==Host selection==

Having previously hosted the 1956 Olympics, Melbourne has hosted world sporting events such as the 1979 World Fencing Championships. The city made a bid to host the 1996 Summer Olympics, but was unsuccessful in its bid to Atlanta. Following the failure of the Olympic bid, the city would later make plans to host the Commonwealth Games. During the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, two cities initially expressed interest in hosting the event; Melbourne, Australia and Wellington, New Zealand. Wellington withdrew its bid, citing the costs involved with matching the bid plan presented by Melbourne, which became the default host without members of the Federation going to vote.
== Preparation and development ==

=== Cost ===
Early concerns arose about the large cost of staging the event, with projected costs likely to be over AUD 1 billion and a high likelihood the Victorian taxpayer would have to cover the expense. The cost was described in some local media as excessive. National Party leader Peter Ryan said that the Labor government should win &quot;gold (medal) for burning money&quot;. However, not all of this money was wasted. The actual costs for hosting the games was AUD 1.144 billion and prior to the Games, accountants at KPMG were estimating that the gross income generated by this event could be as high as AUD 1.5 billion.

=== Athletes&#x27; village ===
An athlete&#x27;s village in the inner suburb of Parkville housed approximately 7,000 athletes and support staff during the Games, and has been transformed into commercial housing with a distinctly eco-friendly image. The creation of this village attracted controversy, with critics claiming it was created by alienating public parkland, while proponents maintained that it represented the renewal of an otherwise derelict inner-city area.

=== Development ===
The change from Daylight Saving Time to Standard Time in Australian states that follow it was delayed from 26 March to 2 April for 2006 to avoid affecting the games. In addition, state and private schools amended their usual term times so as to allow the first term holidays to coincide with the Games. 

Melbourne&#x27;s public transport system – train, tram and bus – ran to altered timetables with some amended or substituted services for the duration of the Games. For the most part, timetabled services were unchanged but suffered due to higher loads.

For the first time ever, the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games appointed a Goodwill Partner, Plan International Australia.

===Opening ceremony===

Both the Melbourne Cricket Ground and the Yarra River were centrepieces for the ceremony, which included many fireworks, and other spectacle. The Games were opened by Elizabeth II, in her capacity as Head of the Commonwealth. The Queen is also Head of State of a number of Commonwealth countries.

=== Closing ceremony ===

Both the Melbourne Cricket Ground and the Yarra River were again centrepieces for the ceremony. Samresh Jung of India was given the David Dixon Award at the closing ceremony. He was the &quot;Best Athlete of the 18th Commonwealth Games&quot;. The games were closed by The Earl of Wessex, Prince Edward.

== Participating teams ==
There were 71 countries, territories and bodies competing at the 2006 Commonwealth Games. The only difference is the roster between the 2006 games and the 2002 games was the absence of Zimbabwe, which had withdrawn from the Commonwealth of Nations.

== Calendar ==

== Sports ==
The 2006 Commonwealth Games included 17 sports, with 12 individual sports and 4 team sports. In total there are 245 events at the Games.

The athletics, swimming, table tennis and weightlifting sports included fully integrated events for elite athletes with a disability (EAD). These events were included in the official medal tally.

==Medal table==

== Broadcasting ==

* The host broadcaster was Trans World International, while the domestic rights-holding broadcaster was the Nine Network in Australia. They showed rolling coverage, except for a break for the evening news and overnight.
* In Australia Fox Sports broadcast the Games on eight dedicated digital Pay-TV channels. These were available on the Foxtel, Austar and Optus Vision networks.
* The BBC covered the Commonwealth Games in the United Kingdom on BBC One and BBC Two. BBCi included a choice of two extra video streams on Freeview and four streams on Digital Satellite and Cable. Users with broadband in the United Kingdom could also view all 5 video streams on bbc.co.uk, and the BBC Sport website.
*CBC, CBC Newsworld, and CBC Country Canada aired a daily one-hour highlights show of the Commonwealth Games in Canada. Compared to past games, the CBC&#x27;s coverage was minimally staffed, with commentary from other broadcasting partners. At first, they did not even consider bidding for the broadcasting rights due to scheduling conflicts with events Canadians are more interested in, such as the Tim Hortons Brier, World Figure Skating Championships, and the 2006 Winter Paralympics &quot;(which itself had been reduced to five-to-ten-minute daily coverage)&quot;. None of Canada&#x27;s metropolitan newspapers sent any journalists to report on the Games, instead relying on news agencies
* TVNZ covered the games for the residents of New Zealand.
* In Malaysia, TV1 broadcast live coverage of the Games for three hours starting at 10 am Malaysian time and for two hours starting at 3 pm, with highlights at 12:30 am. Satellite provider Astro included three dedicated channels to broadcast the Games live to its Sports package subscribers, in addition to delayed broadcast 24 hours later.
* Singapore&#x27;s MediaCorp TV had supposedly not broadcast the games due to the high cost of telecast rights, satellite charges and the lack of sponsors. However, on 17 March, the MediaCorp found other sponsors which is the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports and the Singapore Sports Council. Broadcast started from 18 March until the end of the games. 
* In India, Prasar Bharati broadcast the games on DD National and DD Sports. All India Radio broadcast the running commentary of the main matches and events.
* In the United States, selected coverage was carried by Fox College Sports.
* In the Bahamas, Cable 12 on cable Bahamas broadcast the games.
* In Europe, coverage was carried by EBU members.
* Altogether an estimated 4 billion viewers watched the 2006 Commonwealth Games worldwide.

== Controversies ==

===Missing athletes===
On 20 March 2006 it was reported that two athletes had gone missing from the Commonwealth Games village: Tanzanian boxer Omari Idd Kimweri and Bangladeshi runner Mohammad Tawhidul Islam.

On 22 March 2006 it was reported that seven athletes from Sierra Leone (three women and four men) had also disappeared. A further seven Sierra Leonean athletes also went missing during the course of the Games, bringing the total runaway count to fourteen (two-thirds of the team). Victoria Police believed that they had fled to Sydney where the Sierra Leonean community is much larger than Melbourne&#x27;s.

Two hours before the Closing Ceremony on 26 March, officials from the Cameroon team reported to police that nine of their members had also vanished.

These incidents were not without precedent: 27 athletes similarly disappeared from the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, England (21 from Sierra Leone, 5 from Bangladesh and one from Pakistan), and over 80 athletes and officials overstayed their visas after the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney.

On request of Sierra Leone officials, the Commonwealth Games Federation cancelled those athletes&#x27; Games accreditation, allowing the Australian Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA) to cancel their visas at midnight on 27 March, and begin investigating their disappearance.
At 7.20 am on that day, New South Wales Police located six of the Sierra Leonean athletes in a house at Freshwater near Manly Beach in Sydney. All six indicated they wished to seek political asylum in Australia, and were granted bridging visas by DIMA while their refugee applications were arranged. The athletes claimed to have been subjected to violence and torture in their home country; seventeen-year-old Isha Conteh stated she could be forced into female genital cutting if she returned. On Tuesday 28 March, six further Sierra Leoneans turned themselves in to immigration authorities in Sydney and were also granted bridging visas.

Two of the missing Cameroonian athletes were later found in Perth, Western Australia.

=== The Stolenwealth Games ===
The Stolenwealth Games were protests at the 1982 and 2006 Commonwealth Games. People were protesting because they believed that the Commonwealth Games led to the erasure of indigenous people. There were also problems with land rights. These protests led to the creation of the Global Indigenous Games.

<text>David C. Korten (born 1937) is an American author, former professor of the Harvard Business School, political activist, prominent critic of corporate globalization, and &quot;by training and inclination a student of psychology and behavioral systems&quot;. His best-known publication is &quot;When Corporations Rule the World&quot; (1995 and 2001). In 2011, he was named an &quot;Utne Reader&quot; visionary.

==Early life and career==
David Korten was born in Longview, Washington, in 1937 and is a 1955 graduate of its R. A. Long High School. He received a master of business administration and Ph.D. from the Stanford University Graduate School of Business. He said: &quot;My early career [after leaving Stanford in 1959] was devoted to setting up business schools in low-income countries—starting with Ethiopia&quot;. He served during the Vietnam War as a captain in the United States Air Force, undertaking U.S.-based teaching and organizational duties; and for five and a half years was a visiting professor in the Harvard Business School. While at Stanford in the 1950s, he married Frances Fisher Korten, with whom he lives on Bainbridge Island near Seattle, Washington.

==Career and main body of work==

Korten served for five and a half years as a visiting associate professor of the Harvard University Graduate School of Business where he taught in Harvard&#x27;s middle management, M.B.A., and doctoral programs.

He also served as the Harvard Business School adviser to the Nicaragua-based Central American Institute of Business Administration. He subsequently joined the staff of the Harvard Institute for International Development, where he headed a Ford Foundation-funded project to strengthen the organization and management of national family planning programs.

In the late 1970s, Korten moved to Southeast Asia, where he lived for nearly fifteen years, serving as a Ford Foundation project specialist and, later, as Asia regional adviser on development management to the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which involved him in regular travels to Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines.

Korten has written that he became disenchanted with the official aid system and devoted his last five years in Asia to &quot;working with leaders of Asian non-governmental organizations on identifying the root causes of development failure in the region and building the capacity of civil society organizations to function as strategic catalysts of national- and global-level change&quot;. He formed the view that the poverty, growing inequality, environmental devastation, and social disintegration he was observing in Asia also was being experienced in nearly every country in the world, including the United States and other &quot;developed&quot; countries. He also concluded that the United States was actively promoting—both at home and abroad—the very policies that were deepening the resulting global crisis.

He returned to the U.S. in 1992 and has assisted in raising public consciousness of the political and institutional consequences of economic globalization and the expansion of corporate power at the expense of democracy, equity, and environmental protection.

Korten is co-founder and board chair of the Positive Futures Network, which publishes the quarterly &quot;YES! Magazine&quot;. He is also a founding board member, emeritus, of the Business Alliance for Local Living Economies, a former associate of the International Forum on Globalization, and a member of the Club of Rome.

==&quot;The Post-Corporate World&quot;==
Building on the arguments put forward in his 1995 book &quot;When Corporations Rule the World&quot;, Korten expands on several of the themes. Having made a case for the unworkability of current economic systems on several grounds - the impoverishment of the majority of the population, the need for indefinitely expanding credit leading to the debasement of the currency, and the finite limits of energy and material resources - he provides a context for discussing alternative ways of life, and explores possible courses of action to establish them.

==&quot;The Great Turning&quot;==

Korten&#x27;s 2006 book &quot;The Great Turning: From Empire to Earth Community&quot; argues that the development of empires about 5,000 years ago initiated unequal distribution of power and social benefits to the small portion of the population that controlled them. He also argues that corporations are modern versions of empire, both being social organizations based on hierarchies, chauvinism, and domination through violence.

The rise of powerful advanced technology, combined with the control of corporate as well as nation-based empires is described as being increasingly destructive to communities and the environment. Korten postulates that the world is on the verge of a perfect storm of converging crises, including anthropogenic adverse climate change, post-peak oil production decline, and a financial crisis caused by an unbalanced global economy. This will precipitate major changes to the current economic and social structure.

Korten believes that these crises will present an opportunity for significant changes that could replace the paradigm of &quot;Empire&quot; with one of &quot;Earth Community.&quot; Although recognizing the potential that the opportunity may not be seized, Korten hopes that this opportunity will result in the emergence of an &quot;Earth Community,&quot; based on sustainable, just, and caring communities that incorporate the values of mutual responsibility and accountability, and he advocates toward that.

<text>Debt relief or debt cancellation is the partial or total forgiveness of debt, or the slowing or stopping of debt growth, owed by individuals, corporations, or nations.

From antiquity through the 19th century, it refers to domestic debts, in particular agricultural debts and freeing of debt slaves. In World War I the United States Treasury made large loans to the Allies that were postponed, reduced and finally paid off in 1953. In the late 20th century, it came to refer primarily to Third World debt, which started exploding with the Latin American debt crisis (Mexico 1983, etc.). In the early 21st century, it is of increased applicability to individuals in developed countries, due to credit bubbles and housing bubbles.

==International debt relief==

===First World War reparations===
War debt payments by World War I Allies to the U.S. had been suspended in 1931—only Finland paid in full—and American public opinion demanded repayments resume as a condition of U.S. postwar aid. Germany had suspended its reparations payments due under the 1919 Versailles Treaty and payable to Britain, France and others, as well as loans due to the United States. Chancellor Konrad Adenauer decided that permanent good will required their resumption. The 1953 Agreement on German External Debts, which resumed German&#x27;s war reparations, is a notable example of international debt relief.

===Less Developed Country Debt===
Debt relief for heavily indebted and underdeveloped developing countries was the subject in the 1990s of a campaign by a broad coalition of development NGOs, Christian organizations and others, under the banner of Jubilee 2000. This campaign, involving, for example, demonstrations at the 1998 G8 meeting in Birmingham, was successful in pushing debt relief onto the agenda of Western governments and international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. The Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative was ultimately launched to provide systematic debt relief for the poorest countries, whilst trying to ensure the money would be spent on poverty reduction.

The HIPC programme has been subject to conditionalities similar to those often attached to International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank loans, requiring structural adjustment reforms, sometimes including the privatisation of public utilities, including water and electricity. To qualify for irrevocable debt relief, countries must also maintain macroeconomic stability and implement a Poverty Reduction Strategy satisfactorily for at least one year. Under the goal of reducing inflation, some countries have been pressured to reduce spending in the health and education sectors. While the World Bank considers the HIPC Initiative a success, some scholars are more critical of it.

The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) is an extension of HIPC. The MDRI was agreed following the G8&#x27;s Gleneagles meeting in July 2005. It offers 100% cancellation of multilateral debts owed by HIPC countries to the World Bank, IMF and African Development Bank.

One of the targets of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, specifically Goal 17, is to &quot;assist developing countries in attaining long-term debt sustainability through coordinated policies aimed at fostering debt financing, debt relief and debt restructuring&quot;. This will help poor countries &quot;reduce debt distress&quot;.

==Personal debt relief==
===Origins===

Debt relief existed in a number of ancient societies:
* Debt forgiveness is mentioned in the Book of Leviticus (a Judaeo-Christian scripture), in which God counsels Moses to forgive debts in certain cases every Jubilee year – at the end of Shmita, the last year of the seven-year agricultural cycle or a 49-year cycle, depending on interpretation.
* This same theme was found in an ancient bilingual Hittite-Hurrian text entitled &quot;The Song of Debt Release&quot;.
* Debt forgiveness was also found in Ancient Athens, where in the 6th century BCE, the lawmaker Solon instituted a set of laws called seisachtheia, which canceled all debts and retroactively canceled previous debts that had caused slavery and serfdom, freeing debt slaves and debt serfs.
* In addition, the Qur&#x27;an (the Muslim scripture) supports debt forgiveness for those who are unable to pay as an act of charity and remission of sins for the creditor. The injunction is as follows:
In the United States, the first serious movements to create debt relief were rooted in debtor farmer grievances against creditors. In the early 19th century, legislators created pathways for indebted farmers to take creditors to court to erase what they owed and enable them to start over. The first federal bankruptcy law, passed in 1841 and repealed in 1843, was re-introduced and expanded in 1867. At the time, this was a comparatively radical approach to debt relief in the world, making the United States one of the most debtor-friendly countries.

===Contemporary===
In the United States of America for the years preceding the financial crisis of 2007–2008, non-housing personal debt (auto loans, credit cards, student loans, etc.) rose significantly from approximately $2.05 trillion at the start of 2003 to a peak of $2.71 trillion in Q4 of 2008. It was not until Q3 of 2012 that unsecured personal debt reached this level again. Since that time, unsecured personal debt has risen steadily to $3.76 trillion at the end of the third quarter of 2017. The other large change in unsecured personal debt is that an increasing portion of it is now student loan debt, from 12% in Q1 of 2003 to 53% in Q3 of 2017.

The increasing size of the non-housing personal debt market and ease with which one can obtain personal credit has led to some consumers falling behind on payments. As of Q3 2017, student loans have the highest rates of serious delinquency (90 or more days delinquent) with approximately 9.6% of all student loan debt falling into this bucket. Credit card debt and auto loan debt have serious delinquency rates of 4.6% and 2.4% respectively.

When consumers begin to fall behind on payments, they have several options to discharge the debt, either in full or in part. The first method is declaring bankruptcy, which has the immediate effect of stopping any payments made to creditors. In the United States, the two primary avenues of bankruptcy for an individual are Chapter 13 bankruptcy and Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Another option is to consolidate these debts into a single loan, commonly known as debt consolidation. Debt relief, on an individual level, refers mainly to the negotiation for a reduction of a debt by either the consumer or a debt settlement agency. Through this arrangement, consumers agree to pay the creditor a fixed amount of money (generally a discount on their outstanding debt) either in a lump sum or under a payment plan. The debt settlement industry has had significant regulatory scrutiny since its inception with changes implemented in 2010 by the FTC. As the disposition of personal debt is a highly regulated industry, consumers are urged by the FTC and other trade organizations to do significant research and find an independent credit counselor to guide them through the process.

In 2019, the Texas Legislature forgave an estimated $2.5 billion in debt when it abolished its &quot;Driver Responsibility Surcharge&quot; in all but driving while intoxicated (DWI) cases. This surcharge was an extra three-year civil penalty added onto certain criminal traffic infractions like DWI or driving without a license or insurance. Surcharges were created in 2003 to pay for a roadway network that was never built, and instead half the money was diverted to hospitals, which became reliant on the money, with the rest going into the state treasury. However, the majority of drivers who had surcharges assessed could not pay them. Many people who could not afford either surcharges or insurance continued to drive and racked up huge sums in debt they could never expect to pay. A little-advertised amnesty program and an indigence program that still required partial payment helped some, and were criticized by some who felt it was unfair that they paid and others didn&#x27;t. But local sheriffs began to complain that the law was causing the jails to fill up with people driving on suspended license, and the judiciary insisted the law was unfair and counterproductive to public safety. Finally, in 2019, the Legislature found different sources to fund hospitals and eliminated the surcharge, along with around $2.5 billion in debt owed by around 1.4 million people. The same year, the Legislature eliminated red-light cameras statewide and effectively canceled those debts, and re-defined &quot;undue hardship&quot; in the Code of Criminal Procedure to allow judges to waive traffic-fine debt for more people.

====Tax treatment====
In US tax law, debt forgiven is treated as income, as it reduces a liability, increasing the taxpayer&#x27;s net worth. In the context of the bursting of the United States housing bubble, the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007 provides that debt forgiven on a primary residence is not treated as income, for debts forgiven in the three-year period 2007–2009. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 extended this by three years to the six-year period 2007–2012.

==Bankruptcy and non-recourse loans==
The primary mechanism of debt relief in modern societies is bankruptcy, where a debtor who cannot or chooses not to pay their debts files for bankruptcy and renegotiates their debts, or a creditor initiates this. As part of debt restructuring, the terms of the debt are modified, which may involve the debt owed being reduced. In case the debtor chooses bankruptcy despite being able to service the debt, this is called strategic bankruptcy.

Certain debts can be defaulted on without a general bankruptcy; these are non-recourse loans, most notably mortgages in common law jurisdictions such as the United States. Choosing to default on such a loan despite being able to service it is called strategic default.

==Alternatives==

===Historical===

If a debt cannot be or is not repaid, alternatives that were common historically but are now rare include debt bondage—including debt peonage: being bound until the debt is repaid; and debt slavery, when the debt is so great (or labor valued so low) that the debt will never be repaid—and debtors&#x27; prison.

Debt slavery can persist across generations, future generations being made to work to pay off debts incurred by past generations. Debt bondage is today considered a form of &quot;modern day slavery&quot; in international law, and banned as such, in Article 1(a) of the United Nations 1956 Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery. Nevertheless, the practice continues in some nations. In most developed nations, debts cannot be inherited.

Debtors&#x27; prison has been largely abolished, but remains in some forms in the US, for example if one fails to make child support payments.

===Contemporary===

In modern times, the most common alternatives to debt relief in cases where debt cannot be paid are forbearance and debt restructuring. Forbearance meaning that interest payments (possibly including past due ones) are forgiven, so long as payments resume. No reduction of principal occurs, however.

In debt restructuring, an existing debt is replaced with a new debt. This may result in reduction of the principal (debt relief), or may simply change the terms of repayment, for instance by extending the term (replacing a debt repaid over 5 years with one repaid over 10 years), which allows the same principal to be amortized over a longer period, thus allowing smaller payments.

Personal debt that can be repaid from income but is not being repaid may be obtained via garnishment or attachment of earnings, which deduct debt service from wages.

==Inflation==

Inflation, the reduction in the nominal value of currency, reduces the real value of debts. While lenders take inflation into account when they decide the terms of a loan, unexpected increases in the rate of inflation cause categorical debt relief.

Inflation has been a contentious political issue on this basis, with debasement of currency a form of or alternative to sovereign default, and the free silver in late 19th century America being seen as a conflict between debtor farmers and creditor bankers.

==Impact==
A 2024 study found that debt relief for debtors leads to a large increase in earned income, employment, assets, real estate, secured debt, home ownership, and wealth over subsequent decades.

Another 2024 study found that debtors who receive debt relief are more likely to support incumbent governments.

A 2025 study of medical debt relief found no evidence that it led to improvements in mental and physical health, healthcare utilization, and financial wellness. It did however find that it led moderate but statistically significant reduction in payments of existing medical bills.

==In art==

Debt relief plays a significant role in some artworks. In the play &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; by William Shakespeare, , the heroine pleads for debt relief (forgiveness) on grounds of Christian mercy. In the 1900 novel &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,&quot; a primary political interpretation is that it treats free silver, which engenders inflation and hence reduces debts. In the 1999 film &quot;Fight Club&quot; (but not the novel on which it is based), the climactic event is the destruction of credit card records, dramatized as the destruction of skyscrapers, which allows for debt relief. The television series &quot;Mr. Robot&quot; (2015–2019), follows a group of hackers whose main mission is to cancel all debts by taking down one of the largest corporations in the world, E Corp.

<text>The 2010 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XXI Olympic Winter Games () and also known as Vancouver 2010 (), were an international winter multi-sport event held from February 12 to 28, 2010 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, with some events held in the surrounding suburbs of Richmond, West Vancouver and the University of British Columbia, and in the nearby resort town of Whistler. It was regarded by the Olympic Committee to be among the most successful Olympic games in history, in both attendance and coverage. Approximately 2,600 athletes from 82 nations participated in 86 events in fifteen disciplines. Both the Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games were organized by the Vancouver Organizing Committee (VANOC), headed by John Furlong. The 2010 Winter Games were the third Olympics to be hosted by Canada, and the first to be held within the province of British Columbia. Canada had hosted the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec, and the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta.

Following Olympic tradition, incumbent Vancouver mayor Sam Sullivan received the Olympic flag during the closing ceremony of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. The flag was raised in a special ceremony on February 28, 2006, and was on display at Vancouver City Hall until the Vancouver opening ceremony. The event was officially opened by Governor General Michaëlle Jean, accompanied by the Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Jacques Rogge.

Vancouver 2010 was immensely successful, with the official Olympic Committee press release citing &quot;Full venues, record public attendance: Over 97% of the 1.54 million tickets available were sold, with 71% to the Canadian public at an average price of $139. Adding in international public ticket sales, the percentage of ticket sales to the public exceeds 75% of all available tickets.&quot; Vancouver 2010 also achieved record global television coverage as per the Olympic Committee, more than double the viewership of the preceding Turin 2006 games and triple the available coverage of Salt Lake City 2002, and is &quot;recognized in numerous post Games reports as being among the most widely viewed and well received Games in Olympic history, both in Canada and internationally.&quot; Vancouver 2010&#x27;s gold medal final between Canada and USA &quot;was the most watched hockey game ever with viewership of 114 million viewers around the world.&quot;

For the first time, Canada won gold in an official sport as the host nation of the Olympics, having failed to do so in 1976 and 1988 (although Canada won the 1988 woman&#x27;s curling event in Calgary when it was still only a demonstration sport). Canada clinched their first gold medal on the second day of the competition, first topping the gold medal tally on the second-to-last day of competition, and went on to become the first host nation since Norway in 1952 to lead the gold medal count. Canada broke the record for the most gold medals won at a single Winter Olympics (14), which had been set by the Soviet Union in 1976 and Norway in 2002 (13). The United States won the most medals in total, marking their second time doing so at the Winter Olympics, and broke the record for the most medals won during the Winter Games (37), a record held until then by Germany in 2002 (36). Athletes from Slovakia and Belarus won the first Winter Olympic gold medals for their nations.

==Bid and preparations==

The concept of a bid by Vancouver to host the Winter Olympic Games first appeared at the 1960 Games in Squaw Valley, where the Canadian representative of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Sidney Dawes discusses the possibility of hosting a Games in British Columbia if a venue was found near Vancouver. Shortly afterwards, the Garibaldi Olympic Development Association (GODA) was created in order to prepare a bid to host the Winter Games in the region of Mount Garibaldi, near Whistler. In 1961, GODA considered developing a bid for the 1968 Winter Games, but the Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) preferred the cities of Calgary and Banff, in Alberta, as the best opportunity for a Canadian bid to succeed. Calgary&#x27;s candidacy ultimately failed, and the 1968 Games were awarded to Grenoble.

A development program for the Whistler and Mount Garibaldi region was then launched to host the 1972 Games. It included the development of road infrastructure, electrical network and drinking water, which was still absent in this region. But once again, Banff was chosen to represent Canada as the potential host city for the 1972 Games, which were eventually awarded to Sapporo, Japan. In 1968, the GODA was finally chosen by the Canadian Olympic Committee with the aim of making a joint candidacy with the city of Vancouver for the organization of the 1976 Winter Olympics. However, the chances of Vancouver&#x27;s candidacy dwindled when Montreal was selected to host the 1976 Summer Olympics, and the Vancouver-Garibaldi candidacy was thus eliminated in the first round of voting. Vancouver was again a candidate for the 1980 Games, but withdrew at the last moment. For the 1988 Winter Olympics, Calgary was chosen as the preferred site for the Canadian bid, and would go on to win the election and thus become the first Canadian city to host the Winter Olympics.

For the 2010 Games, the Canadian Olympic Association chose Vancouver as the Canadian candidate city over Calgary, which sought to re-host the Games, and Quebec City, which had lost the 2002 Olympic bid in 1995. On the first round of voting on November 21, 1998, Vancouver-Whistler had 26 votes, Quebec City had 25 and Calgary had 21. On December 3, 1998, the second and final round of voting occurred between the two leading contenders, which saw Vancouver win with 40 votes compared to Quebec City&#x27;s 32 votes. Vancouver had also bid for the 1976 games, which were first awarded to Denver, then to Innsbruck and the 1980 games, which were awarded to Lake Placid.

After the bribery scandal over the candidacy of the Salt Lake City bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics (which resulted in Quebec City asking for compensation (C$8 million) for its unsuccessful bid), many of the rules of the bidding process were changed in 1999. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) created the Evaluation Commission, which was appointed on October 24, 2002. Prior to the bidding for the 2008 Summer Olympics, host cities would often fly members of the IOC to their city where they toured the city and were provided with gifts. The lack of oversight and transparency often led to allegations of money for votes. Afterward, changes brought forth by the IOC bidding rules were tightened, and more focused on technical aspects of candidate cities. The team analyzed the candidate city features and provided its input back to the IOC.

Vancouver won the bid to host the Olympics by a vote of the International Olympic Committee on July 2, 2003, at the 115th IOC Session held in Prague, Czech Republic. The result was announced by IOC President Jacques Rogge. Vancouver faced two other finalists shortlisted that same February: Pyeongchang, South Korea, and Salzburg, Austria. Pyeongchang, which later won the rights of hosting both 2018 Winter Olympics and 2024 Winter Youth Olympics (as a part of the Gangwon Province) had the most votes of the three cities in the first round of voting, in which Salzburg was eliminated. In the run-off, all but two of the members who had voted for Salzburg voted for Vancouver. It was the closest vote by the IOC since Sydney, Australia beat Beijing for the 2000 Summer Olympics by two votes. Vancouver&#x27;s victory came almost two years after Toronto&#x27;s 2008 Summer Olympic bid was defeated by Beijing in a landslide vote.

The Vancouver Olympic Committee (VANOC) spent C$16.6 million on upgrading facilities at Cypress Mountain, which hosted the freestyle (aerials, moguls, ski cross) and snowboarding events. With the opening in February 2009 of the C$40 million Vancouver Olympic/Paralympic Centre at Hillcrest Park, which hosted curling, every sports venue for the 2010 Games was completed on time and at least one year prior to the Games.

==Financials==

===Operations===
In 2004, the operational cost of the 2010 Winter Olympics was estimated to be Canadian $1.354 billion (about £828,499,787, €975,033,598 or US$1,314,307,896). As of mid-2009 it was projected to be C$1.76 billion, mostly raised from non-government sources, primarily through sponsorships and the auction of national broadcasting rights. C$580 million was the taxpayer-supported budget to construct or renovate venues throughout Vancouver and Whistler. A final audit conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers released in December 2010 revealed total operation cost to have been $1.84 billion and came in on budget resulting in neither surplus nor deficit. Construction of venues also came on budget with a total cost of $603 million.

PricewaterhouseCoopers&#x27; study estimated a total contribution to the BC economy of $2.3 billion of Gross Domestic Product, and as well creating 45,000 jobs and contributing an additional $463 million to the tourism industry while venue construction by VANOC and 3rd parties added $1.22 billion to the economy, far short of the $10 billion forecast by Premier Gordon Campbell. The study also said that hosting the Olympics was one of many reasons why the provincial debt grew by $24 billion during the decade. Non direct olympics games cost (e.g. expanded rail network, highways, security, paid time off for government employees &quot;volunteering&quot; etc.) cost in excess of 7 billion. In 2011, the provincial auditor-general declined to conduct a post-Games audit.

===Security costs===
C$200 million was expected to be spent for security, which was organized through a special body, the Integrated Security Unit, of which the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) was the lead agency; other government agencies such as the Vancouver Police Department, Canada Border Services Agency, Canadian Forces, and police agencies across Canada. The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) also played a role. That number was later revealed to be in the region of C$1 billion, an amount in excess of five times what was originally estimated.

==Venues==

Some venues, including the Richmond Olympic Oval, were at sea level, a rarity for the Winter Games. The 2010 Games were also the first—Winter or Summer—to have had an Opening Ceremony held indoors. Greater Vancouver was the most populous metropolitan area ever to hold the Winter Games. In February, the month when the Games were held, Vancouver has an average temperature of . The average temperature as measured at Vancouver International Airport was for the month of February 2010.

The opening and closing ceremonies were held at BC Place Stadium, which received over C$150 million in major renovations. Competition venues in Greater Vancouver included the Pacific Coliseum, the Vancouver Olympic/Paralympic Centre, the UBC Winter Sports Centre, the Richmond Olympic Oval and Cypress Mountain. GM Place, now known as Rogers Arena, played host to ice hockey events, being renamed &quot;Canada Hockey Place&quot; for the duration of the Games since corporate sponsorship is not allowed for an Olympic venue. Renovations included the removal of advertising from the ice surface and conversion of some seating to accommodate the media. The 2010 Winter Olympics marked the first time an Olympic hockey game was played on a rink sized according to NHL rules instead of international specifications. Competition venues in Whistler included Whistler Creekside at the Whistler Blackcomb ski resort, the Whistler Olympic Park, the Whistler Celebration Plaza and the Whistler Sliding Centre.

The 2010 Winter Games marked the first time that the energy consumption of the Olympic venues was tracked in real time and made available to the public. Energy data was collected from the metering and building automation systems of nine of the Olympic venues and was displayed online through the Venue Energy Tracker project.

==Marketing==
==Media coverage==

The Olympic Games in Vancouver were broadcast worldwide by a number of television broadcasters. As rights for the 2010 Games have been packaged with those for the 2012 Summer Olympics, broadcasters were largely identical for both events.

The host broadcaster was Olympic Broadcasting Services Vancouver, a subsidiary of the IOC&#x27;s new in-house broadcasting unit Olympic Broadcasting Services (OBS). The 2010 Olympics marked the first Games where the host broadcasting facilities were provided solely by OBS. The executive director of Olympic Broadcasting Services Vancouver was Nancy Lee, a former producer and executive for CBC Sports. The official broadcast theme was a piece called &quot;City of Ice&quot; composed by Rob May and Simon Hill.

In Canada, the Games were the first Olympic Games broadcast by a new Olympic Broadcast Media Consortium led by CTVglobemedia and Rogers Media, displacing previous broadcaster CBC Sports. Main English-language coverage was shown on the CTV Television Network, while supplementary programming was mainly shown on TSN and Rogers Sportsnet. Main French-language coverage was shown on V and RDS.

NBC Universal networks televised the 2010 Winter Olympics in the United States, under a contract in which it paid US$2.2 billion for the rights to the Games and the 2012 Summer Olympics. Advertising sales had slowed in comparison to previous Olympics due to the ongoing recession, and NBC projected a financial loss upwards of $250 million on the Games. Due to the growth of social media, NBC faced particular criticism for its traditional practice of tape delaying network coverage of the Olympics for the west coast—a practice that was made more egregious by the fact that these Games took place at sites within the Pacific Time Zone. In April 2010, the network reported a financial loss of $233 million on the Games.

The Associated Press (AP) announced that it would send 120 reporters, photographers, editors and videographers to cover the Games on behalf of the country&#x27;s news media. The cost of their Olympics coverage prompted AP to make a &quot;real departure for the wire service&#x27;s online coverage&quot;. Rather than simply providing content, it partnered with more than 900 newspapers and broadcasters who split the ad revenue generated from an AP-produced multi-media package of video, photos, statistics, stories and a daily Webcast. AP&#x27;s coverage included a microsite with web widgets facilitating integration with social networking and bookmarking services.

In France, the Games were covered by France Télévisions, which included continuous live coverage on its website.

==Torch relay==
The Olympic Torch Relay is the transfer of the Olympic flame from Ancient Olympia, Greece — where the first Olympic Games were held thousands of years ago — to the stadium of the city hosting the current Olympic Games. The flame arrives just in time for the Opening Ceremony.

For the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games, the flame was lit in Olympia on October 22, 2009. It then traveled from Greece, over the North Pole to Canada&#x27;s High Arctic and on to the West Coast and Vancouver. The relay started its long Canada journey from the British Columbia capital of Victoria. In Canada, the torch traveled approximately over 106 days, making it the longest relay route within one country in Olympic history. The Olympic Torch was carried by approximately 12,000 Canadians and reached over 1,000 communities.

Celebrity torchbearers included Arnold Schwarzenegger, Steve Nash, Matt Lauer, Justin Morneau, Michael Bublé, Bob Costas, Shania Twain, and hockey greats including Sidney Crosby, Wayne Gretzky, and the captains of the two Vancouver Canucks teams that went to the Stanley Cup Finals: Trevor Linden () and Stan Smyl ().

==The Games==

===Participating National Olympic Committees===
82 National Olympic Committees (NOC) entered teams in the 2010 Winter Olympics. Cayman Islands, Colombia, Ghana, Montenegro, Pakistan, Peru and Serbia made their winter Olympic debuts. Morocco returned to the Winter games after a 18-year absence, and Jamaica and Mexico returned after 8 years. Seven countries, Costa Rica, Kenya, Luxembourg, Madagascar, Thailand, Venezuela and the Virgin Islands which were at the 2006 Games, did not participate in 2010.

Tonga sought to make its Winter Olympic debut by entering a single competitor in luge, attracting some media attention, but he crashed in the final round of qualifying.
Luxembourg qualified two athletes but did not participate because one did not reach the criteria set by the NOC and the other was injured before the Games. Below is a map of the participating nations and a list of the nations with the number of competitors indicated in brackets.

=== Number of athletes by National Olympic Committee ===
2,626 athletes from 82 NOCs participated in the 2010 Winter Olympics.

===Sports===
The 2010 Winter Olympics featured 86 events over 15 disciplines in 7 sports.

# Bobsleigh

# Curling
# Ice hockey
# Luge
# Skating
#* 
# Skiing
#*

&quot;Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of medal events contested in each separate discipline.&quot;

The opening and closing ceremonies and the events categorized as ice sports (excluding bobsleigh, luge and skeleton) were held in Vancouver and Richmond. The sports categorized as &quot;Nordic events&quot; were held in the Callaghan Valley located just to the west of Whistler. All alpine skiing events were held on Whistler Mountain (Creekside) and sliding events (bobsleigh, luge and skeleton) were held on Blackcomb Mountain. Cypress Mountain (located in Cypress Provincial Park in West Vancouver) hosted the freestyle skiing (aerials, moguls and ski cross), and all snowboard events (half-pipe, parallel giant slalom, snowboard cross).
Vancouver 2010 was also the first winter Olympics in which both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s hockey were played on a narrower, NHL-sized ice rink, measuring , instead of the international size of . The games were played at General Motors Place (now Rogers Arena), home of the NHL&#x27;s Vancouver Canucks, which was temporarily renamed Canada Hockey Place for the duration of the Olympics. Utilizing this existing venue instead of building a new international-sized ice rink facility saved C$10 million in construction costs and allowed an additional 35,000 spectators to attend Olympic hockey games. However, some European countries expressed concern over this decision, worried that it might give North American players an advantage since they grew up playing on the smaller NHL-sized rinks. By contrast, the only other NHL venue to host Olympic hockey, the Calgary Flames&#x27; Olympic Saddledome, started construction before Calgary won the bid for the 1988 Winter Olympics and it was designed to accommodate an international ice rink.

There were a number of events that were proposed to be included in the 2010 Winter Olympics. On November 28, 2006, the IOC Executive Board at their meeting in Kuwait voted to include ski cross in the official program. The Vancouver Olympic Committee (VANOC) subsequently approved the event to officially be part of the Games program.

Events proposed for inclusion but ultimately rejected included:
* Biathlon mixed relay
* Mixed doubles curling
* Team alpine skiing
* Team bobsled and skeleton
* Team luge
* Women&#x27;s ski jumping

The issue over women&#x27;s ski jumping being excluded ended up in the Supreme Court of British Columbia in Vancouver during April 21–24, 2009, with a verdict on July 10 excluding women&#x27;s ski jumping from the 2010 Games.
 A request to appeal that verdict to the Supreme Court of Canada was subsequently denied on December 22 – a decision that marked the end of any hopes that the event would be held during Vancouver 2010. To alleviate the exclusion, VANOC organizers invited women from all over Canada to participate at Whistler Olympic Park, including Continental Cup in January 2009. Women&#x27;s ski jumping was included in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.

==Concerns and controversies==

Some in the foreign press, including London 2012 organizers, had criticized the lack of city decorations to acknowledge that Vancouver was the host of the Games. The original plans to decorate the city in Olympic colours, a tradition followed by other recent Games host cities, were canceled for several reasons. Anti-Games activists repeatedly vandalized the existing 2010 Olympics monuments such as the countdown clock, forcing the city to install CCTV cameras, and adding more Games decorations would have inevitably required more security presence to deter protesters, so VANOC opted to minimize these symbols to avoid making the city a police state. Besides local opposition, budget cutbacks also forced the organizers to scale back on the elaborate plans.

VANOC initially benefited from an economic boom and was able to secure lucrative and record domestic sponsorships, but this boom also resulted in rapidly rising construction and labour costs. Due to these factors, as well as the Great Recession, VANOC built minimalistic functional venues with little aesthetic appeal though they were well-designed for post-Games usage. This approach, as well as the fact that most of the infrastructure already existed, meant that the direct costs of the Vancouver Games were much lower than recent Olympic games.

Before the Games began and as they commenced, a number of concerns and controversies surfaced and received media attention. Hours before the opening ceremony, Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili was killed during a training run after being thrown out from his luge, intensifying questions about the safety of the course and prompting organizers to implement quick modifications. Immediately after the accident, officials attributed it to an athlete error rather than a track deficiency. The International Luge Federation called an emergency meeting after the accident, and all other training runs were cancelled for the day. The President of Georgia, Mikheil Saakashvili, thanked the hosts for the way that they handled Kumaritashvili&#x27;s death which included a moment of silence, bringing his remains back to Georgia and a tribute to him at the opening ceremony.

One critic
questioned the choice of Cypress Mountain as a venue because of its potential lack of snow due to the 2009-10 El Niño. Because of this possibility, organizers had a contingency plan to truck in snow from Manning Park, about to the east of the city. This allowed events to proceed as planned.

Political decisions involving cancellation of promised low-income housing and the creation of a community of mixed economic backgrounds for post-Games use of the athletes&#x27; village was criticized.

Opening ceremonies were stalled while organizers dealt with mechanical problems during the cauldron lighting ceremony. Speed skating events were delayed due to breakdowns of the ice resurfacers supplied by Olympia, an official sponsor of the Games.

Thousands of tickets were voided by organizers when weather conditions made standing-room-only areas unsafe. Visitors were also upset that, as in past Olympics, medal ceremonies required separate admission and blocks of VIP tickets reserved for sponsors and dignitaries were unused at events. Other glitches and complaints have included confusion by officials at the start of the February 16 men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s biathlon pursuit races, and restricted access to the Olympic flame cauldron on the Vancouver waterfront.

===Opposition===

Opposition to the Olympic Games was expressed by activists and politicians, including Lower Mainland mayors Derek Corrigan
and Richard Walton. Many of the public pre-Olympic events held in Vancouver were attended by protesters.

On Saturday, February 13, as part of a week-long Anti-Olympic Convergence, protesters smashed windows of the Downtown Vancouver location of The Hudson&#x27;s Bay department store. Protesters later argued that the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, &quot;has been a symbol of colonial oppression for centuries&quot; as well as a major sponsor of the 2010 Olympics.

Some of the issues reflected in the opposition continue the themes identified in opposition to all Olympic games, some of which are outlined in anti-Olympics activist and Professor of Sociology Helen Jefferson Lenskyj&#x27;s books &quot;Olympic Industry Resistance&quot; (2007) and &quot;Inside the Olympic Industry&quot; (2000), which examined a number of different Olympic Games prior to the 2010 Winter Olympics.
These issues of concern, underlying the opposition to any and all Olympic Games, include:

* Displacement of low-income residents.
* Anticipated human trafficking for the purpose of forced prostitution.

====First Nations opposition====
Although the Aboriginal governments of the Squamish, Musqueam, Lil&#x27;wat and Tsleil-Waututh (the &quot;Four Host First Nations&quot;), on whose traditional territory the Games were held, signed a protocol in 2004 in support of the games, there was opposition to the Olympics from some indigenous groups and supporters. Although the Lil&#x27;wat branch of the St&#x27;at&#x27;imc Nation is a co-host of the Games, a splinter group from the Seton band known as the St&#x27;at&#x27;imc of Sutikalh, who have also opposed the Cayoosh Ski Resort, feared the Olympics would bring unwanted tourism and real estate sales to their territory.

Local aboriginal people, as well as Canadian Inuit, initially expressed concern over the choice of an inukshuk as the symbol of the Games, with some Inuit leaders such as former Nunavut Commissioner Peter Irniq stating that the inukshuk is a culturally important symbol to them. He said that the &quot;Inuit never build inuksuit with head, legs and arms. I have seen inuksuit [built] more recently, 100 years maybe by non-Inuit in Nunavut, with head, legs and arms. These are not called inuksuit. These are called inunguat, imitation of man.&quot; Local aboriginal groups also expressed annoyance that the design did not reflect the Coast Salish and Interior Salish native culture from the region the Games are being held in, but rather that of the Inuit, who are indigenous to the Arctic far from Vancouver.

===Doping===
On March 11, 2010, it was reported that the Polish cross country skier Kornelia Marek was tested positive for EPO by the Polish Olympic Committee. If found guilty of doping by the International Olympic Committee, Marek and the relay teams would be disqualified and stripped of their Vancouver results. She would also be banned from the next Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, in 2014.

Marek denied taking any banned substances, but the backup &quot;B&quot; sample from the Vancouver doping lab confirmed the &quot;A&quot; sample.

On October 9, 2017, the IOC announced that three positive doping cases had been found from their re-analysis programme from the 2010 games. All three cases belonged to the same athlete, whose identity was not released at the time. The IOC had re-tested 1,195 urine samples from the games out of the 1,710 taken, which equates to 70%, as part of their re-analysis programme.
Weeks later, the athlete was confirmed to be Slovenian biathlete Teja Gregorin.

==Mascots==

The mascots of the 2010 Winter Olympics are a spirit bear named Miga and a Sasquatch named Quatchi.

==Legacy==

The massive celebratory crowds in downtown Vancouver were highly praised by the IOC. Jacques Rogge, the president of IOC, indicated that &quot;the way Vancouver embraced these Games was extraordinary. This is really something unique and has given a great atmosphere for these Games.&quot; The atmosphere surrounding the Olympics, and its inclusion of foreign delegates and guests, was also praised, with many seasoned Winter Olympic observers putting the games at, or near, the top of the list of best ever Winter Olympics. They were also the best watched Winter Olympics since the 1994 Olympics in Lillehammer. They are also mentioned alongside the Sydney 2000 Summer games in regards to the best atmosphere. A large part is credited to the citizens of Vancouver, British Columbia and Canada.

Some members of the media (mostly, and particularly the British media) criticized the Own the Podium and criticized the celebrations as having been somewhat nationalistic, but this was not an opinion shared by many. Some suggested that the British media were making these criticisms in order to make the upcoming 2012 Summer Olympics more appealing. Lord Sebastian Coe, chairman of the 2012 London Olympic Games Organizing Committee, attended the Vancouver Olympics to see how the city coped with the challenges of hosting. Lord Coe noted the Games had &quot;gradually recovered from its tumultuous start&quot; and queried that he &quot;never thought the British would find rivals in their preoccupation with the weather which is almost elevated to an Olympic event&quot; as he credited VANOC for meeting unforeseen challenges such as the unseasonably warm weather of Cypress Mountain. Coe added &quot;Rarely have I seen a host city so passionate and so ready to embrace the Games&quot;.

The Vancouver Olympics also organized and hosted the first Pride House for LGBT athletes in the history of the event.

===Funding===
Directly as a result of Canada&#x27;s medal performance at the 2010 Olympics, the Government of Canada announced in the 2010 federal budget, a new commitment of $34 million over the next two years towards programs for athletes planning to compete in future Olympics. This is in addition to the $11 million per year federal government commitment to the Own the Podium program.

Also, as a result of hosting the 2010 Olympics, the British Columbia government pledged to restore funding for sports programs and athlete development to 2008 levels, which amounts to $30 million over three years.

=== Usage of venues after the Olympic Games ===

Unlike at previous Games, all new venues were designed with their post-Games use in mind. The Richmond Olympic Oval was converted from a speed skating oval into an indoor multi-sports centre, the Hillcrest Centre is now a multi-purpose community centre with hockey rink and swimming pool and Whistler Olympic Park is used for public recreation, athlete training, and competition events.

<doc id="178750" wikidata="Q7532637" url="?curid=178750" title="Six Acts">
<text>Following the Peterloo Massacre on 16 August 1819, the government of the United Kingdom under Lord Liverpool acted to prevent any future disturbances by the introduction of new legislation, the so-called Six Acts aimed at suppressing any meetings for the purpose of radical reform. Élie Halévy considered them a panic-stricken extension of &quot;the counter-revolutionary terror ... under the direct patronage of Lord Sidmouth and his colleagues&quot;; some later historians have treated them as relatively mild gestures towards law and order, only tentatively enforced.

==The setting, and the passing of the acts==
Following the Yeomanry killing of unarmed men and women in St Peter&#x27;s Field (Peterloo), a wave of protest meetings swept the North of England, spilling over into the Midlands and the Lowlands, and involving in all some seventeen counties. Local magistrates appealed in the face of the protests for central support; and in response the Parliament of the United Kingdom was reconvened on 23 November and the new acts were introduced by the Home Secretary, Henry Addington. By 30 December the legislation was passed, despite the opposition of the Whigs to both their principles and many of their details.

The acts were aimed at gagging radical newspapers, preventing large meetings, and reducing what the government saw as the possibility of armed insurrection. During the Commons debates, each of the parties appealed to the example of the French Revolution to make their case. The Tories pointed to the weakness of the French forces of law and order; the Whigs, conversely, to the need for the safety valve of free speech and a free press.

Strengthened by their success at the 1818 elections, the Whigs were able to make three significant amendments to the bills as originally proposed: public meetings were to be allowed behind closed doors, and the ban on outside meetings was to be limited in time; transportation of Press offenders was made more difficult; and the curtailment of legal delays was extended to include prosecution as well as defendant. Nevertheless, the Six Acts were eventually passed by prime minister Lord Liverpool and his colleagues, as part of their repressive approach focused on preventing a British revolution.

==Details of the acts==



The six acts were:

*The &quot;Training Prevention Act&quot;, now known as the Unlawful Drilling Act 1819 (60 Geo. 3 &amp; 1 Geo. 4. c. 1), made any person attending a meeting for the purpose of receiving training or drill in weapons liable to arrest and transportation. More simply stated, military training of any sort was to be conducted only by municipal bodies and above.
*The &quot;Seizure of Arms Act&quot; (60 Geo. 3 &amp; 1 Geo. 4. c. 2) gave local magistrates the powers, within the disturbed counties, to search any private property for weapons and seize them and arrest the owners.
*The &quot;Misdemeanours Act&quot; (60 Geo. 3 &amp; 1 Geo. 4. c. 4) attempted to increase the speed of the administration of justice by reducing the opportunities for bail and allowing for speedier court processing.
*The &quot;Seditious Meetings Act&quot; (60 Geo. 3 &amp; 1 Geo. 4. c. 6) required the permission of a sheriff or magistrate in order to convene any public meeting of more than 50 people if the subject of that meeting was concerned with &quot;church or state&quot; matters. Additional people could not attend such meetings unless they were inhabitants of the parish.
*The &quot;Blasphemous and Seditious Libels Act&quot; (or &quot;Criminal Libel Act&quot;) (60 Geo. 3 &amp; 1 Geo. 4. c. 8), toughened the existing laws to provide for more punitive sentences for the authors of such writings. The maximum sentence was increased to fourteen years&#x27; transportation.
*The &quot;Newspaper and Stamp Duties Act&quot; (60 Geo. 3 &amp; 1 Geo. 4. c. 9) extended and increased taxes to cover those publications which had escaped duty by publishing opinion and not news. Publishers were also required to post a bond for their behaviour.

==Repeal of the acts, and their influence==
Different time-scales applied to the different acts.

*The prohibition of drilling was maintained into the twentieth century, and only repealed in 2008. 
*By contrast, the seizure of arms was set up to elapse after 27 months; while the Seditious Meetings Prevention Act had a five-year time limit built in, and was repealed in 1824. 
*G. M. Trevelyan considered that &quot;The most lasting injury to the community was done by the Act imposing a four-penny stamp on all periodical publications&quot;—a charge reduced (to a penny) in 1836, before such taxes on knowledge finally vanished mid-century.

The Six Acts went down in folk history, alongside Peterloo, as symbols of the repressive nature of the Pittite regime.

<text>The Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF, often stylized as tiff) is one of the most prestigious and largest publicly attended film festivals in the world. Founded in 1976, the festival takes place every year in early September. The organization behind the film festival is also a permanent destination for film culture operating out of the TIFF Lightbox cultural centre, located in downtown Toronto.

The TIFF People&#x27;s Choice Award – which is based on audience balloting – has emerged as an indicator of success during awards season, especially at the Academy Awards. Past recipients of this award include Oscar-winning films, such as &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; (1981), &quot;Life Is Beautiful&quot; (1998), &quot;American Beauty&quot; (1999), &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; (2000), &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot; (2008), &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot; (2010), &quot;Silver Linings Playbook&quot; (2012), &quot;12 Years a Slave&quot; (2013), &quot;The Imitation Game&quot; (2014), &quot;La La Land&quot; (2016), &quot;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri&quot; (2017), &quot;Green Book&quot; (2018), &quot;Jojo Rabbit&quot; (2019), &quot;Nomadland&quot; (2020), &quot;Belfast&quot; (2021) and &quot;American Fiction&quot; (2023).

TIFF starts the Thursday night after Labour Day (the first Monday in September in Canada) and lasts for eleven days. The 2024 Toronto International Film Festival took place from September 5 through 15, 2024. 

, the festival&#x27;s CEO is Cameron Bailey.

==Background==
The Toronto International Film Festival was first launched as the Toronto Festival of Festivals, collecting the best films from other film festivals around the world and showing them to eager audiences in Toronto. Founded by Bill Marshall, Dusty Cohl, and Henk Van der Kolk, the inaugural event took place from October 18 through 24, 1976. That first year, 35,000 filmgoers watched 127 films from 30 countries presented in ten programmes. Piers Handling had been the festival&#x27;s director and CEO since 1994, while Noah Cowan became co-director of TIFF in 2004. In late 2007, Cowan became the artistic director of TIFF Lightbox, while longtime programmer Cameron Bailey succeeded as co-director. As of 2013, Bailey is now the artistic director of the Toronto International Film Festival, as well as TIFF Lightbox&#x27;s year round programming.TIFF was once centred on the Yorkville neighbourhood, but the Toronto Entertainment District later gained a greater level of prominence. TIFF is known for the celebrity buzz it brings to the area with international media setting up near its restaurants and stores for photos and interviews with the stars. In 2010, TIFF opened its permanent headquarters, TIFF Lightbox, a year-round home for the appreciation of film in the heart of downtown Toronto, although TIFF films are still screened at a wider variety of venues, including the Scotiabank Theatre Toronto, rather than exclusively at the Lightbox.

TIFF has grown, steadily adding initiatives throughout the years. TIFF Cinematheque (formerly Cinematheque Ontario) and the Film Reference Library (FRL) opened in 1990. The TIFF Kids International Film Festival (formerly Sprockets) launched in 1998. Film Circuit began exhibiting independent and Canadian films in under-serviced cities across Canada in 1994.

The festival also organizes the TIFF Film Circuit, a program which partners with local organizations in other Canadian towns and cities to present screenings of films that have previously been shown at TIFF.

In May 2024, TIFF announced that it will launch a full film market in 2026.

==History==
The festival was founded in 1976 at the Windsor Arms Hotel by Bill Marshall, Henk Van der Kolk and Dusty Cohl. Beginning as a collection of the best-regarded films from film festivals around the world, it had an inaugural attendance of 35,000. Ironically, however, Hollywood studios withdrew their submissions from TIFF due to concerns that Toronto audiences would be too parochial for their feature releases.

In 1978, the festival first began billing itself as &quot;the Toronto International Film Festival&quot; as a supplementary name, although it retained Festival of Festivals as its primary branding. At the same time it moved from the Harbour Castle Hotel to the Plaza II, and Wayne Clarkson replaced Marshall as the festival director. The number of galas increased from one to two per night and the Canadian Film Awards were incorporated into the festival. 

The Festival of Festivals name was dropped in 1994, with the event becoming known exclusively as the Toronto International Film Festival at that time. From 1994 to 2009, the umbrella organization running TIFF was named &quot;Toronto International Film Festival Group&quot; (TIFFG). In 2009, the umbrella organization TIFFG was renamed to TIFF.

In 2001, Perspective Canada, the programme that had focused on Canadian films since 1984, was replaced by two programmes:
* Canada First!, a forum for Canadian filmmakers presenting their first feature-length work, featuring eight to 15 films, and
* Short Cuts Canada, which includes 30-40 Canadian short films.
As of 2015, Canadian films are now simply included alongside international films in the other film programs rather than being grouped as a dedicated Canadian film stream.In 2004, TIFF was featured as the site of murder mystery in the film &quot;Jiminy Glick in Lalawood&quot;, a comedy film starring Martin Short.

In 2007, it was announced that the organization generates an estimated annual impact of $67 million CAD. By 2011, that benefit had grown to $170 million CAD.

In 2008, Rose McGowan caused controversy at a TIFF press conference for her film &quot;Fifty Dead Men Walking&quot;, when she noted that &quot;I imagine, had I grown up in Belfast, I would 100% have been in the IRA&quot;.

In 2009, TIFF&#x27;s decision to spotlight films from Tel Aviv created a controversy with protesters, saying it was part of an attempt to re-brand Israel in a positive light after the January 2009 Gaza War.

In 2016, 397 films from 83 countries were screened at 28 screens in downtown Toronto venues, welcoming an estimated 480,000 attendees, over 5,000 of whom were industry professionals.

In 2017, TIFF reduced the number of films screened compared to the 2016 festival with 255 feature-length films in 2017, and also eliminated two venues that had been used in prior years.

In 2019, it was reported that due to a request from its owner, Cineplex Entertainment, no TIFF films distributed by subscription video-on-demand services (specifically Amazon Video and Netflix) are being screened at Scotiabank Theatre—which has been considered the &quot;primary&quot; venue of the festival.

The 2020 edition was both in-person and virtual due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the virtual platform provided by Shift72. The film screenings were initially declared as &quot;masks optional&quot;, a decision that drew criticism for creating a potential superspreader event as the social nature of the festival could increase the risk for COVID-19 transmission. The festival reversed the decision within 24 hours citing a surge of new cases in Ontario, causing them to go fully virtual instead.

The 2020 festival also saw the introduction of Industry Selects, an &quot;ad hoc&quot; film market for films seeking commercial distribution. Due to the pandemic, which prevented members of the North American film industry from travelling to international film festivals where many of the Industry Selects films were screened, they were available on the festival&#x27;s industry platform, but not on the commercial platform for the general public. Introduced at the time as a temporary measure due to the pandemic, it was converted into a permanent part of the TIFF program in 2022, and became the nucleus of the festival&#x27;s plans to launch a full film market in 2026.

===Notable film premieres===
Films such as &quot;American Beauty&quot;, &quot;Ray&quot;, &quot;Mr. Nobody&quot;, &quot;127 Hours&quot;, &quot;Black Swan&quot;, &quot;Disobedience&quot;, &quot;The Five Obstructions&quot;, &quot;Singapore Sling&quot;, &quot;I Am Love&quot; and &quot;The Fabelmans&quot; have premiered at TIFF. Jamie Foxx&#x27;s portrayal of Ray Charles ultimately won him the Academy Award for Best Actor while &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot; went on to win eight Oscars at the 2009 Academy Awards. &quot;Precious&quot;, which won the 2009 TIFF People&#x27;s Choice Award, went on to win two Oscars at the 82nd Academy Awards. &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot;, the winner of the 2010 TIFF People&#x27;s Choice Award, won four Oscars at the 83rd Academy Awards, while &quot;Silver Linings Playbook&quot;, the winner of the 2012 TIFF People&#x27;s Choice Award, went on to win the Academy Award for Best Actress for Jennifer Lawrence. In 2019, the festival opened with &quot;Once Were Brothers: Robbie Robertson and The Band&quot;, the first time the festival ever opened with a Canadian documentary film.

Many Hollywood studios premiere their films in Toronto due to TIFF&#x27;s easy-going non-competitive nature, relatively inexpensive costs (when compared to European festivals), eager film-fluent audiences and convenient timing.

===TIFF Lightbox===

In 2007, the Festival Group began construction on TIFF Lightbox, a new facility at the corner of King and John Streets in downtown Toronto, on land donated by Ivan Reitman and family. The $181 million facility was sponsored by Bell Canada, with additional support from the Government of Ontario and Government of Canada.

In 2010, the organization opened its new headquarters at TIFF Lightbox. The facility, designed by local firm KPMB Architects, provides extensive year-round galleries, cinemas, archives and activities for cinephiles. The five-storey facility contains five cinemas, two gallery spaces, film archives and an extensive reference library, study spaces, film lab facility, and a research centre. There is also a gift shop, two restaurants, a lounge, a cafe, and a three-storey atrium. Cooperatively with Daniels Corporation, there is a 46-storey condominium atop, called the Festival Tower.

The first film screening was Bruce McDonald&#x27;s &quot;Trigger&quot;. The first exhibition was a retrospective on Tim Burton, organized by the Museum of Modern Art (New York City). Subsequent exhibitions include Fellini: Spectacular Obsessions, Grace Kelly: From Movie Star to Princess, Designing 007: 50 Years of Bond Style, and Stanley Kubrick: The Exhibition, all of which were organized by TIFF, as well as one called &quot;Essential Cinema&quot;, featuring posters, images and props from TIFF&#x27;s &quot;The Essential 100&quot; list of films.

The Film Reference Library (FRL) is a large Canadian film research collection. The library is a free resource for film lovers, filmmakers, students, scholars, and journalists, and is located on the fourth floor of the TIFF Lightbox. An affiliate member of the International Federation of Film Archives (FIAF), the FRL promotes Canadian and global film scholarship by collecting, preserving, and providing access to a comprehensive collection of film prints, and film-related reference resources (including books, periodicals, scripts, research files, movies, press kits, and about 80 special collections.

In 2016, the festival received a donation of 1,400 film prints, and launched a campaign to raise money for the preservation and storage of the films.

===Canada&#x27;s Top Ten===
Annually, TIFF releases a Canada&#x27;s Top Ten list of the films selected by a poll of festival programmers across Canada as the ten best Canadian feature and short films of the year, regardless of whether or not they were screened at TIFF. The films selected are announced in December each year.

Previously, the winning films were screened at a smaller follow-up &quot;Canada&#x27;s Top Ten&quot; festival at the Lightbox the following January, with a People&#x27;s Choice Award then presented for that minifestival. In 2018, TIFF announced a change, under which instead of a dedicated festival, each Top Ten film will receive its own standalone theatrical run at the Lightbox throughout the year.

Since 1984, every decade TIFF has also produced a Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time list. This list is produced from a wider poll of film industry professionals and academics throughout Canada, separately from the annual top-ten list.

==Awards==
The festival&#x27;s major prize, the TIFF People&#x27;s Choice Award, is given to a feature-length film. It is not a juried prize, but is given to the film with the highest ratings as voted by the TIFF-going populace. It is presently referred to as the &quot;Grolsch People&#x27;s Choice Award&quot;; past sponsors of the award have included Cadillac. The winners of this award have often later earned Academy Award nominations. People&#x27;s Choice Awards are also presented for Documentary and Midnight Madness films. Each of the People&#x27;s Choice Awards names first and second runners-up in addition to the winners.

However, TIFF does present juried awards in some other categories. The festival presents three major awards for Canadian films: Best Canadian Film, Best Canadian First Feature Film, and Best Canadian Short Film, as well as awards for Best International Short Film, two FIPRESCI-sponsored International Critics&#x27; Prizes for the Special Presentation and Discovery programs, and a NETPAC Prize for the best film from Asia having its world premiere at the festival.

In 2015, the festival introduced Platform, a juried programme that champions director&#x27;s cinema from around the world; one film from the stream is selected as the winner of the Platform Prize.

For all of the juried awards, honorable mentions may also be given, although the juries are expected to select one overall winner.

In 2019, the festival introduced the TIFF Tribute Awards, a gala ceremony at which distinguished actors and filmmakers are honoured for their lifetime career achievements; unlike most award categories, the Tribute Award honorees are named in advance of the festival.

==Sections==
The hundreds of films screened at the annual festival are divided into sections (referred to by TIFF as &quot;Programmes&quot;) based on genre (e.g. documentary, children&#x27;s films), format (e.g. short films, television episodes), the status of filmmaker (e.g. &quot;masters&quot;, first-time directors), and so forth. Up until the early 2010s there were sections reserved for Canadian films, but beginning in 2015 all Canadian films are integrated in sections with films from outside Canada.

Currently the festival&#x27;s 14 sections are as follows:
* Centrepiece (formerly Contemporary World Cinema): narrative feature films by established directors
* Discovery: films that are typically the director&#x27;s first or second feature film
* Gala Presentations: high-profile feature films, often featuring international movie stars, presented with a red carpet
* In Conversation With...: interviews of a director or other figure from the film industry, generally accompanied by brief excerpts from films (up until the 2014 festival, this section was called &quot;Mavericks&quot;)
* Masters: feature films by &quot;the world&#x27;s most influential art-house filmmakers&quot;
* Midnight Madness: genre films (traditionally at TIFF each film in this section has one screening scheduled for 11:59pm and another the following afternoon); the section was launched at TIFF in 1988 and was programmed by Colin Geddes from 1998 to 2016, now programmed by Peter Kuplowsky
* Platform: a competitive section launched in 2015, named for Jia Zhangke&#x27;s film &quot;Platform&quot;, of films from around the world that do not have distribution in North America. Every year the Platform section has a high-profile international jury which confers the C$25,000 Platform Prize; both documentaries and narrative films are eligible for inclusion in the section.
* Primetime: television episodes making either their world premiere or North American premiere projected cinematically; this section was launched in 2015
* Short Cuts: a section of short films (usually six to ten short films included at each screening) both Canadian and international; up until the 2013 festival only Canadian short films were screened and the section was called Short Cuts Canada, in 2014 a new section called Short Cuts International was added, and then in 2015 they were merged into a section called Short Cuts
* Special Presentations: high-profile feature films, usually Canadian premieres if not world premieres
* TIFF Cinematheque: unlike the other sections which present new films, the TIFF Cinematheque section has films from all eras of cinema, often classic films that have been newly restored
* TIFF Docs (formerly called Reel to Reel): documentary films
* TIFF Kids and TIFF Next Wave (formerly called Sprockets): films for children and teenagers; however, these are not dedicated programs in their own right, but designations added to films of youth interest that are already in one of the other programs. TIFF also organizes smaller separate TIFF Kids and TIFF Next Wave festivals in the spring of the year.
* Wavelengths: experimental films and art films, both feature-length and shorts (this section was named for Michael Snow&#x27;s film &quot;Wavelength&quot;)

In previous years, sections at TIFF have included Perspectives Canada, Canada First!, City to City (2009 to 2016), Future Projections, Vanguard (up to 2016), and Visions (up to 2011).

==Recognition and media coverage==
According to the BBC, TIFF is one of the largest and most prestigious events of its kind in the world. In 1998, &quot;Variety&quot; acknowledged that TIFF &quot;is second only to Cannes in terms of high-profile pics, stars, and market activity&quot;. In 2007, &quot;Time&quot; noted that TIFF had &quot;grown from its place as the most influential fall film festival to the most influential film festival, period&quot;.

In 2016, TIFF hosted 1,800 members of the press and print media outlets such as the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Times of India&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, &quot;Miami Herald&quot;, and the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; have published a significant amount of festival coverage. Also, the major industry trade magazines &quot;Variety&quot;, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; and &quot;Screen International&quot; all produce daily editions during TIFF. TIFF reports also appear in weekly news magazines; American, Canadian and international entertainment shows; news services; and a wide range of film and celebrity blogs.

<text>Land reform (also known as [[agrarian reform]]) involves the changing of laws, regulations, or customs regarding land ownership, land use, and land transfers. The reforms may be initiated by governments, by interested groups, or by revolution.

Land reform is often considered a contentious process, as land is a key driver of a wide range of social, political and economic outcomes. The structure and distribution of land rights has been linked to state formation, economic growth, inequality, political violence, and identity politics, making land reform highly consequential for the long-term structures of society.

== Overview ==
Land reform may consist of a government-initiated or government-backed property redistribution, generally of agricultural land. Land reform can, therefore, refer to transfer of ownership from the more powerful to the less powerful, such as from a relatively small number of wealthy or noble owners with extensive land holdings (e.g., plantations, large ranches, or agribusiness plots) to individual ownership by those who work the land. Such transfers of ownership may be with or without compensation; compensation may vary from token amounts to the full value of the land.

Land reform may also entail the transfer of land from individual ownership—even peasant ownership in smallholdings—to government-owned collective farms; it has also, in other times and places, referred to the exact opposite: division of government-owned collective farms into smallholdings. The common characteristic of all land reforms is modification or replacement of existing institutional arrangements governing possession and use of land. Thus, while land reform may be radical in nature, such as through large-scale transfers of land from one group to another, it can also be less dramatic, such as regulatory reforms aimed at improving land administration.
== Land usage and tenure ==
Land ownership and tenure can be perceived as controversial in part because ideas defining what it means to access or control land, such as through &quot;land ownership&quot; or &quot;land tenure&quot;, can vary considerably across regions and even within countries. Land reforms, which change what it means to control land, therefore create tensions and conflicts between those who lose and those who gain from these redefinitions (see next section).

Western conceptions of land have evolved over the past several centuries to place greater emphasis on individual land ownership, formalized through documents such as land titles. Control over land may also be perceived less in terms of individual ownership and more in terms of land use, or through what is known as land tenure. Historically, in many parts of Africa for example, land was not owned by an individual, but rather used by an extended family or a village community. Different people in a family or community had different rights to access this land for different purposes and at different times. Such rights were often conveyed through oral history and not formally documented.

These different ideas of land ownership and tenure are sometimes referred to using different terminology. For example, &quot;formal&quot; or &quot;statutory&quot; land systems refer to ideas of land control more closely affiliated with individual land ownership. &quot;Informal&quot; or &quot;customary&quot; land systems refer to ideas of land control more closely affiliated with land tenure.

Terms dictating control over and use of land can therefore take many forms. Some specific examples of present-day or historic forms of formal and informal land ownership include:
* Traditional land tenure, as practiced by the indigenous tribes of Pre-Columbian North America.
* Feudal land ownership, through fiefdoms
* Life estate, interest in real property that ends at death.
* Fee tail, hereditary, non-transferable ownership of real property.
* Fee simple. Under common law, this is the most complete ownership interest one can have in real property.
* Leasehold or rental
* Rights to use a common
* Sharecropping
*Run rig and rundale
*Well-Field System
* Easements
*Kibbutz and moshav
*Satoyama
* Agricultural labor – under which someone works the land in exchange for money, payment in kind, or some combination of the two
* Collective ownership
* Access to land through a membership in a cooperative, or shares in a corporation, which owns the land (typically by fee simple or its equivalent, but possibly under other arrangements).
* Government collectives, such as those that might be found in communist states, whereby government ownership of most agricultural land is combined in various ways with tenure for farming collectives.

==Motivation==

Land reform is a deeply political process and therefore many arguments for and against it have emerged. These arguments vary tremendously over time and place. In the twentieth century, many land reforms emerged from a particular political ideology, such as communism or socialism. In the 19th century in colonized states, a colonial government may have changed the laws dictating land ownership to better consolidate political power or to support its colonial economy. In more recent times, electoral mobilization and the use of land as a patronage resource have been proposed as possible motivations for land reform efforts, such as the extensive redistributive land reforms of Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe.

===Arguments for===
Arguments in support of land reform focus on its potential social and economic benefits, particularly in developing countries, that may emerge from reforms focused on greater land formalization. Such benefits may include eradicating food insecurity and alleviating rural poverty.

Arguments in support of such reforms gained particular momentum after the publication of &quot;The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else&quot; by Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto in 2000. The poor, he argues, are often unable to secure formal property rights, such as land titles, to the land on which they live or farm because of poor governance, corruption and/or overly complex bureaucracies. Without land titles or other formal documentation of their land assets, they are less able to access formal credit. Political and legal reforms within countries, according to de Soto, will help to include the poor in formal legal and economic systems, increase the poor&#x27;s ability to access credit and contribute to economic growth and poverty reduction.

Many international development organizations and bilateral and multilateral donors, such as the World Bank, have embraced de Soto&#x27;s ideas, or similar ideas, about the benefits of greater formalized land rights. This has translated into a number of development programs that work with governments and civil society organizations to initiate and implement land reforms. Evidence to support the economic and pro-poor benefits of increased formalized land rights are still inconclusive according to some critics (see &quot;Arguments against land reform&quot; below).

Other arguments in support of land reform point to the need to alleviate conflicting land laws, particularly in former colonies, where formal and informal land systems may exist in tension with each other. Such conflicts can make marginalized groups vulnerable to further exploitation. For example, in many countries in Africa with conflicting land laws, AIDS stigmatization has led to an increasing number of AIDS widows being kicked off marital land by in-laws. While the woman may have both customary and statutory rights to the land, confusion over which set of laws has primacy, or even a lack of knowledge of relevant laws, leave many AIDS widows at a significant disadvantage. Also, conflicting formal and informal land laws can also clog a country&#x27;s legal system, making it prone to corruption.

Additional arguments for land reform focus on the potential environmental benefits of reform. For example, if reform leads to greater security of land ownership, through either formal or informal means, then those that use the land will be better stewards of it.

Land reforms carried out in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea are credited with contributing to the industrial development. The equitable distribution of land led to increasing agricultural outputs, high rural purchasing power and social mobility.

===Arguments against===
Many of the arguments in support of land reform speak to its potentially positive social and economic outcomes. Yet, as mentioned previously, land reform is an intensely political process. Thus, many of those opposed to land reform are nervous as to the underlying motivations of those initiating the reform. For example, some may fear that they will be disadvantaged or victimized as a result of the reforms. Others may fear that they will lose out in the economic and political power struggles (especially in under developed countries) that underlie many land reforms.

Other groups and individuals express concerns about land reforms focused on formalization of property rights. While the economic and social benefits of formalized land rights are often touted, some research suggests that such reforms are either ineffective or may cause further hardship or conflict.

Additional arguments against land reform focus on concerns over equity issues and potential elite capture of land, particularly in regards to reforms focused on greater land formalization. If improperly or inadequately implemented, critics worry that such reforms may further disadvantage marginalized groups such as indigenous communities or women. These concerns also lead to questions about the institutional capacity of governments to implement land reforms as they are designed. Even if a country does have this capacity, critics worry that corruption and patrimonialism will lead to further elite capture.

In looking at more radical reforms, such as large-scale land redistribution, arguments against reform include concerns that redistributed land will not be used productively and that owners of expropriated land will not be compensated adequately or compensated at all. Zimbabwe, again, is a commonly cited example of the perils of such large-scale reforms, whereby land redistribution contributed to economic decline and increased food insecurity in the country. In cases where land reform has been enacted as part of socialist collectivization, many of the arguments against collectivization more generally apply.

==National efforts==

An early example of land reform was the Irish Land Acts of 1870–1909. Most all newly independent countries of Eastern and Central Europe implemented land reforms in the aftermath of World War I. In most countries, the land in excess of certain limits (, depending on the region and type of land) was expropriated; in Finland, it was redeemed and placed into a special fund.
