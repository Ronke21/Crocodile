<text>Pennsylvania Dutch (, or ) or Pennsylvania German is a variety of Palatine German spoken by the Pennsylvania Dutch, including the Amish, Mennonites, Fancy Dutch, and other related groups in the United States and Canada. There are approximately 300,000 native speakers of Pennsylvania Dutch in the United States and Canada.

The language traditionally has been spoken by the Pennsylvania Dutch, who are descendants of late 17th- and early to late 18th-century immigrants to Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, and North Carolina, who arrived primarily from Southern Germany and, to a lesser degree, the regions of Alsace and Lorraine in eastern France, and parts of Switzerland. 

Differing explanations exist on why the Pennsylvania Dutch are referred to as &quot;Dutch&quot;, which typically refers to the inhabitants of the Netherlands or the Dutch language, only distantly related to Pennsylvania German.

Speakers of the dialect today are primarily found in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and other Midwestern states, as well as parts of the Southern states such as in Kentucky and Tennessee, in the United States, and in Ontario in Canada. The dialect historically was also spoken in other regions where its use has largely or entirely faded. The practice of Pennsylvania Dutch as a street language in urban areas of Pennsylvania, including Allentown, Reading, Lancaster, and York, was declining by the beginning of the 20th century. But in more rural Pennsylvania areas, it continued in widespread use until World War II. Since that time, its use in Pennsylvania rural areas has greatly declined. It is best preserved in the Old Order Amish and Old Order Mennonite communities, and presently the members of both groups make up the majority of Pennsylvania Dutch speakers.

== European origins ==

The ancestors of Pennsylvania Dutch speakers came from various parts of the southwestern regions of German-speaking Europe, including Palatinate, Electoral Palatinate (), the Duchy of Baden, Hesse, Saxony, Swabia, Württemberg, Alsace, German Lorraine, and Switzerland. Most of the people in these areas spoke Rhine Franconian, especially Palatine German and, to a lesser degree, Alemannic dialects; it is believed that in the first generations after the settlers arrived, the dialects merged, as there were few new German immigrants for a period of ~60 years. (ca. 1760 to ca. 1820). The result of that dialect levelling was a dialect very close to the eastern dialects of Palatine German, especially the rural dialects around Mannheim/Ludwigshafen.

Pennsylvania Dutch is mainly derived from Palatine German, spoken by 2,400,000 Germans in the Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region, a region almost identical to the historical Palatinate. There are similarities between the German dialect that is still spoken in this small part of southwestern Germany and Pennsylvania Dutch. When individuals from the Palatinate &quot;(Pfalz)&quot; region of Germany today encounter Pennsylvania Dutch speakers, conversation is often possible to a limited degree.

== Comparison with Standard German ==
Pennsylvania Dutch for the most part does not reflect the diverse origins of the early speakers from regions along the upper Rhine River (Rhineland, Württemberg, Baden, Saarland, Switzerland and Alsace) but almost exclusively the strong immigrant group from the Palatine.

Pennsylvania Dutch is not a corrupted form of Standard German, since Standard German originally developed as a written standard based on the various spoken German dialects in a very long process that started in the time of classical Middle High German (1170–1250). Pennsylvania Dutch instead reflects the independent development of Palatine German, especially from the region that is called in German.

Since Pennsylvania Dutch is largely derived from Palatine German, which did not fully undergo the High German consonant shift, several vowels and consonants in Pennsylvania Dutch differ when compared with Standard German or Upper German dialects such as Alemannic and Bavarian. 

The American English influence is most significant on vocabulary and to a much lesser degree on pronunciation; the English influence on grammar is relatively small. The question of whether the large loss of the dative case—the most significant difference compared with Palatine German—is due to English influence or reflects an inner development is disputed.

=== Grammar ===
As in Standard German, Pennsylvania Dutch uses three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter).
Pennsylvania Dutch has three cases for personal pronouns: the accusative, nominative, and dative, and two cases for nouns: the common case, with both accusative and nominative functions, and the dative case.
There is no genitive case in Pennsylvania Dutch. The historical genitive case has been replaced by the dative, and possession is indicated with a special construction using the dative and the possessive pronoun: &#x27;the man&#x27;s dog&#x27; becomes (literally: &#x27;to the man his dog&#x27;). Studies have shown variability in the use of the dative case in both sectarian and non-sectarian communities. The trend is towards use of the common case for nouns and the accusative case for pronouns, instead of the dative. Thus, , for example, has frequently become .

The dative case in Pennsylvania German is used to express possession, to mark objects of prepositions, to mark indirect objects, and to indicate the direct objects of certain verbs. It is expressed, as in Standard German, through the use of dative forms of personal pronouns and through certain inflections of articles and adjectives modifying nouns. In non-sectarian speech in central Pennsylvania, the dative is widely used among the older generations who are fluent in Pennsylvania German, whereas younger semi-speakers tend not to use the dative as much. Many semi-speakers used the English possessive &quot;-&#x27;s&quot;.

In contrast, Anabaptists in central Pennsylvania had almost completely replaced the dative with the accusative case. Meanwhile, members of the entirely Pennsylvania Dutch-speaking community in Kalona, all of whom were Amish or Mennonite, showed strong age-related variation. Speakers under the age of 40 never used the dative, while older speakers showed strongly variable behavior. There was little difference between members of the different religious denominations in the Kalona.

Many verbs of English origin are used in Pennsylvania Dutch. Most English-origin verbs are treated as German weak verbs, receiving a past participle with a prefix and a suffix, thus for example the past participle of &#x27;change&#x27; is usually . Verbs with unstressed first syllables generally do not take the prefix, so the past participle of &#x27;adopt&#x27; is &quot;adopted&quot;, as in English. This follows the pattern of words with inseparable prefixes in German. However, English-origin verbs which are stressed on the first syllable may also appear without the prefix. Thus, &#x27;realize&#x27; is conjugated simply as &quot;realized&quot;, and &#x27;farm&#x27; may be conjugated as &quot;farmed&quot; or . Some German-origin verbs may also appear without the prefix. &#x27;talk, speak&#x27;, may be conjugated as or simply as . Both English influence and overall simplification may be at work in the dropping of the prefix.

Pennsylvania Dutch, like Standard German, has many separable verbs composed of a root verb and a prefix. Some of these in Standard German are completely semantically transparent, such as &#x27;to go with&#x27;, from &#x27;with&#x27; and &#x27;go&#x27;. Others, like which means &#x27;to inform&#x27; and not the sharing of concrete entities, are not semantically transparent. That is, their meaning is not the sum of their parts. Separable verbs are used widely in Pennsylvania Dutch, and separable verbs can even be formed with English roots and prefixes. Virtually all separable verbs in Pennsylvania Dutch are semantically transparent. Many semantically opaque separable verbs such as , meaning, &#x27;to move house&#x27;, has been replaced by the English word &quot;move&quot;.

Adjectival endings exist but appear simplified compared to Standard German. As in all other South German dialects, the past tense is generally expressed using the perfect: (&#x27;I have run into the field&#x27;) and not the simple past ( [&#x27;I ran into the field&#x27;]), which is retained only in the verb &quot;to be&quot;, as or , corresponding to English &quot;was&quot; and &quot;were&quot;. The subjunctive mood is extant only as ( is totally lost) in a limited number of verbs. In all other verbs it is expressed through the form of of the verbs &#x27;to do&#x27; () and &#x27;to have&#x27; (&quot;/&quot;) combined with the infinitive or the past participle, e.g., (&#x27;I would eat&#x27;), (&#x27;I would have eaten&#x27;).

Several Pennsylvania Dutch grammars have been published over the years. Two examples are &quot;A Simple Grammar of Pennsylvania Dutch&quot; by J. William Frey and &quot;A Pennsylvania German Reader and Grammar&quot; by Earl C. Haag.

===Pronunciation===
The tables below use IPA symbols to compare sounds used in Standard German (to the left) with sounds that correspond to them in their Pennsylvania Dutch cognates, reflecting their respective evolutions since they diverged from a common origin.

====Vowels====
====Consonants====
In Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, there have been numerous other shifts that can make their Pennsylvania Dutch particularly difficult for modern High German speakers to understand. A word beginning in generally becomes , which is more easily pronounced, and so German &gt; &gt; and German &gt; &gt; . Likewise, German &gt; &gt; . German &gt; &gt; . The shift is rather common with German children learning to speak.

The softened after guttural consonants has mixed with the guttural of earlier generations and also turned into an American and so German &gt; &gt; and German &gt; &gt; . The changes in pronunciation, combined with the general disappearance of declensions as described above, result in a form of the dialect that has evolved somewhat from its early Pennsylvania origins nearly 300 years ago and is still rather easy to understand by German dialect speakers of the Rhineland-Palatinate area.

==Interaction with English==
The people from southern Germany, eastern France and Switzerland, where the Pennsylvania Dutch culture and dialect sprung, started to arrive in North America in the late 17th and the early 18th centuries, before the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. To a more limited extent, that is also true of a second wave of immigration in the mid-19th century, which came from the same regions, but settled more frequently in Ohio, Indiana, and other parts of the Midwest. Thus, an entire industrial vocabulary relating to electricity, machinery and modern farming implements has naturally been borrowed from the English. For Pennsylvania Dutch speakers who work in a modern trade or in an industrial environment, this could potentially increase the challenge of maintaining their mother tongue.

Numerous English words have been borrowed and adapted for use in Pennsylvania Dutch since the first generations of Pennsylvania German habitation of southeastern Pennsylvania. Examples of English loan words that are relatively common are ( &#x27;I bet you can speak Pennsylvania Dutch&#x27;), ( &#x27;it depends somewhat on who you are&#x27;); for &#x27;chap&#x27; or &#x27;guy&#x27;; and for &#x27;to jump&#x27;. Today, many speakers will use Pennsylvania Dutch words for the smaller numerals and English for larger and more complicated numbers, like $27,599.

Conversely, although many among the earlier generations of Pennsylvania Dutch could speak English, they were known for speaking it with a strong and distinctive accent. Such Pennsylvania Dutch English can still sometimes be heard. Although the more-recently coined term is being used in the context of this and related articles to describe this Pennsylvania Dutch-influenced English, it has traditionally been referred to as &quot;Dutchy&quot; or &quot;Dutchified&quot; English.

== Written language ==
Pennsylvania Dutch has primarily been a spoken dialect throughout its history, with very few of its speakers making much of an attempt to read or write it. Writing in Pennsylvania Dutch can be a difficult task, and there is no spelling standard for the dialect. There are currently two primary competing models upon which numerous orthographic (i.e., spelling) systems have been based by individuals who attempt to write in the Pennsylvania Dutch dialect. One &#x27;school&#x27; tends to follow the rules of American English orthography, the other the rules of Standard German orthography (developed by Preston Barba and Albert F. Buffington). The choice of writing system is not meant to imply any difference in pronunciation. For comparison, a translation into Pennsylvania Dutch, using two spelling systems, of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, as found in the common traditional language English translation, is presented below. The text in the second column illustrates a system based on American English orthography. The text in the third column uses, on the other hand, a system based on Standard German. The English original is found in the first column, and a Standard German version appears in the fifth column. (Note: The German version(s) of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer most likely to have been used by Pennsylvania Germans would have been derived in most cases from Martin Luther&#x27;s translation of the New Testament.)
=== Pennsylvania High German ===

Pennsylvania High German is a literary form of Palatine written in Pennsylvania, the Palatinate, and other Palatine states (e.g. the Hessian Palatinate), used between the 1700s and early 1900s. In Pennsylvania, this literary form helped maintain German education and instruction, and was spoken in schools and churches. It is often seen in Fraktur art and script.

Immediately after the American Civil War, the federal government replaced Pennsylvania German schools with English-only schools. Literary German disappeared from Pennsylvania Dutch life little by little, starting with schools, and then to churches and newspapers. With the decline of German instruction, Pennsylvania High German became a dead language.

=== Publications ===
Since 1997, the Pennsylvania Dutch newspaper &quot;Hiwwe wie Driwwe&quot; allows dialect authors (of whom there are still about 100) to publish Pennsylvania Dutch poetry and prose. &quot;Hiwwe wie Driwwe&quot; was founded by Michael Werner. It is published twice a year (2,400 copies per issue)—since 2013 in cooperation with the Pennsylvania German Cultural Heritage Center at Kutztown University. Since 2002, the newspaper is published both online and in print.

In 2006, the German publishing house Edition Tintenfaß started to print books in Pennsylvania Dutch.

Wycliffe Bible Translators, Inc., using American English orthography (see Written language), has translated the Bible into Pennsylvania Dutch. The New Testament with Psalms and Proverbs was published in 2002 by the Bible League. The entire Bible, &quot;Di Heilich Shrift&quot;, was completed and published in 2013 by TGS International. Deitsh Books has published a dictionary (2013) and a grammar book (2014) by D Miller using the same American English orthography.

In 2014, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses began to publish literature in Pennsylvania Dutch.

== Survival ==

Pennsylvania Dutch, which is now in its fourth century on North American soil, had more than 250,000 speakers in 2012. It has shifted its center to the West with approximately 160,000 speakers in Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, Iowa and other Midwest states. There is even a small but growing number of Pennsylvania Dutch speakers in Upper Barton Creek and Springfield in Belize among Old Order Mennonites of the Noah Hoover group. The dialect is used vigorously by the horse and buggy Old Order Mennonites in the northern part of the Regional Municipality of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada.

Speakers without an Anabaptist background in general do not pass the dialect to their children today, but the Old Order Amish and horse-and-buggy Old Order Mennonites do so in the current generation, and there are no signs that the practice will end in the future. There are only two car driving Anabaptist groups who have preserved the dialect: The Old Beachy Amish and the Kauffman Amish Mennonites, also called Sleeping Preacher Churches. Even though Amish and Old Order Mennonites were originally a minority group within the Pennsylvania Dutch-speaking population, today they form the vast majority. According to sociologist John A. Hostetler, less than 10 percent of the original Pennsylvania Dutch population was Amish or Mennonite.

As of 1989, non-sectarian, or non-Amish and non-Mennonite, native Pennsylvania-Dutch speaking parents have generally spoken to their children exclusively in English. The reasons they cited were preventing their children from developing a &quot;Dutch&quot; accent and preparing them for school. Older speakers generally did not see a reason for young people to speak it. Many of their children learned the language from hearing their parents using it and from interactions with the generation older than their parents. Among the first natively English speaking generation, oldest siblings typically speak Pennsylvania Dutch better than younger ones.

There have been efforts to advance the use of the dialect. Kutztown University offers a complete minor program in Pennsylvania German Studies. The program includes two full semesters of the Pennsylvania Dutch dialect. In the 2007–2008 school year, the classes were being taught by Professor Edward Quinter. In 2008–2009, Professor Robert Lusch served as the instructor.

According to one scholar, &quot;today, almost all Amish are functionally bilingual in Pennsylvania Dutch and English; however, domains of usage are sharply separated. Pennsylvania Dutch dominates in most in-group settings, such as the dinner table and preaching in church services. In contrast, English is used for most reading and writing. English is also the medium of instruction in schools and is used in business transactions and often, out of politeness, in situations involving interactions with non-Amish. Finally, the Amish read prayers and sing in Standard, or High, German () at church services. The distinctive use of three different languages serves as a powerful conveyor of Amish identity.&quot; Although &quot;the English language is being used in more and more situations,&quot; nonetheless Pennsylvania Dutch is &quot;one of a handful of minority languages in the United States that is neither endangered nor supported by continual arrivals of immigrants.&quot;

Because it is an isolated dialect and almost all native speakers are bilingual in English, the biggest threat to the dialect is gradual decay of the traditional vocabulary, which is then replaced by English loan words or words corrupted from English.

== Speaker population ==
In the United States, most Old Order Amish and all &quot;horse and buggy&quot; Old Order Mennonite groups speak Pennsylvania Dutch, except the Old Order Mennonites of Virginia, where German was already mostly replaced at the end of the 19th century. There are several Old Order Amish communities (especially in Indiana) where Bernese German, a form of Swiss German and Low Alemannic Alsatian, not Pennsylvania Dutch, are spoken. Additionally, English has mostly replaced Pennsylvania Dutch among the car driving Old Order Horning and the Wisler Mennonites.

Other religious groups among whose members the Pennsylvania Dutch dialect would have once been predominant, include: Lutheran and German Reformed congregations of Pennsylvania Dutch background, Schwenkfelders, and Schwarzenau (German Baptist) Brethren. Until fairly recent times, the speaking of Pennsylvania Dutch had absolutely no religious connotations.

In Ontario, Canada, the Old Order Amish, the members of the Ontario Old Order Mennonite Conference, the David Martin Old Order Mennonites, the Orthodox Mennonites and smaller pockets of others (regardless of religious affiliation) speak Pennsylvania Dutch. The members of the car driving Old Order Markham-Waterloo Mennonite Conference have mostly switched to English. In 2017, there were about 10,000 speakers of Pennsylvania Dutch in Canada, far fewer than in the United States.

There are also attempts being made in a few communities to teach the dialect in a classroom setting; however, as every year passes by, fewer and fewer in those particular communities speak the dialect. There is still a weekly radio program in the dialect whose audience is made up mostly of the diverse groups, and many Lutheran and Reformed congregations in Pennsylvania that formerly used German have a yearly service in Pennsylvania Dutch. Other non-native speakers of the dialect include those persons that regularly do business with native speakers.

Among them, the Old Order Amish population was probably around 227,000 in 2008. Additionally, the Old Order Mennonite population, a sizable percentage of which is Pennsylvania Dutch-speaking, numbers several tens of thousands. There are also thousands of other Mennonites who speak the dialect, as well as thousands more older Pennsylvania Dutch speakers of non-Amish and non-Mennonite background. The Grundsau Lodge, which is an organization in southeastern Pennsylvania of Pennsylvania Dutch speakers, is said to have 6,000 members. Therefore, a fair estimate of the speaker population in 2008 might be close to 300,000, although many, including some academic publications, may report much lower numbers, uninformed of those diverse speaker groups.

There are no formal statistics on the size of the Amish population, and most who speak Pennsylvania Dutch on the Canadian and U.S. censuses would report that they speak German, since it is the closest option available. Pennsylvania Dutch was reported under ethnicity in the 2000 census.

There are also some Pennsylvania Dutch speakers who belong to traditional Anabaptist groups in Latin America. Even though most Mennonite communities in Belize speak Plautdietsch, some few hundreds who came to Belize mostly around 1970 and who belong to the Noah Hoover Mennonites speak Pennsylvania Dutch. There are also some recent New Order Amish immigrants in Bolivia, Argentina, and Belize who speak Pennsylvania Dutch while the great majority of conservative Mennionites in those countries speak Plautdietsch.

== Examples ==

* In Mario Pei&#x27;s book &quot;Language&quot;, a popular poem in the dialect (with significant English influence in the form of loanwords) is printed; the free-translation is, in the main, by J. Cooper.

* This link contains an example of spoken Pennsylvania Dutch: (&#x27;Are you born as a Christian?&#x27;).
* More example of spoken Pennsylvania Dutch can be found at the page &quot;American Languages – our nation&#x27;s many languages online&quot; of the University of Wisconsin.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;Orange is the New Black&quot; character Leanne Taylor and family are featured speaking Pennsylvania Dutch in flashbacks showing her Amish background before ending up in prison.

Science-fiction writer Michael Flynn wrote the novella &quot;The Forest of Time&quot;, depicting an alternate history in which the United States was never established, but each of the Thirteen Colonies went its own way as an independent nation. In that history, Pennsylvania adopted the Pennsylvania Dutch language as its national language and developed into a German-speaking nation, with its own specific culture, very distinct from both its English-speaking neighbors and European Germany.

<text>In organizational behavior and industrial and organizational psychology, organizational commitment is an individual&#x27;s psychological attachment to the organization. Organizational scientists have also developed many nuanced definitions of organizational commitment, and numerous scales to measure them. Exemplary of this work is Meyer and Allen&#x27;s model of commitment, which was developed to integrate numerous definitions of commitment that had been proliferated in the literature. Meyer and Allen&#x27;s model has also been critiqued because the model is not consistent with empirical findings. It may also not be fully applicable in domains such as customer behavior. There has also been debate surrounding what Meyers and Allen&#x27;s model was trying to achieve.

The basis behind many of these studies was to find ways to improve how workers feel about their jobs so that these workers would become more committed to their organizations. 

Organizational commitment predicts work variables such as turnover, organizational citizenship behavior, and job performance. Some of the factors such as role stress, empowerment, job insecurity and employability, and distribution of leadership have been shown to be connected to a worker&#x27;s sense of organizational commitment.

== Model of commitment ==
Meyer and Allen&#x27;s (1991) three-component model of commitment was created to argue that commitment has three different components that correspond with different psychological states. Meyer and Allen created this model for two reasons: first &quot;aid in the interpretation of existing research&quot; and second &quot;to serve as a framework for future research&quot;. Their study was based mainly around previous studies of organizational commitment. 

Meyer and Allen&#x27;s research indicated that there are three &quot;mind sets&quot; which can characterize an employee&#x27;s commitment to the organization. Mercurio (2015) extended this model by reviewing the empirical and theoretical studies on organizational commitment. Mercurio posits that emotional, or affective commitment is the core essence of organizational commitment.

=== Affective commitment ===
Affective Commitment is defined as the employee&#x27;s positive emotional attachment to the organization. Meyer and Allen pegged AC as the &quot;desire&quot; component of organizational commitment. An employee who is affectively committed strongly identifies with the goals of the organization and desires to remain a part of the organization. This employee commits to the organization because they &quot;want to&quot;. 

This commitment can be influenced by many different demographic characteristics: age, tenure, sex, and education but these influences are neither strong nor consistent. The problem with these characteristics is that while they can be seen, they cannot be clearly defined. Meyer and Allen gave this example that &quot;positive relationships between tenure and commitment maybe due to tenure-related differences in job status and quality&quot; In developing this concept, Meyer and Allen drew largely on Mowday, Porter, and Steers&#x27;s (2006) concept of commitment, which in turn drew on earlier work by Kanter (1968). Mercurio (2015) stated that...&quot;affective commitment was found to be an enduring, demonstrably indispensable, and central characteristic of organizational commitment&quot;.

=== Continuance commitment ===
Continuance commitment is the &quot;need&quot; component or the gains versus losses of working in an organization. 

&quot;Side bets&quot;, or investments, are the gains and losses that may occur should an individual stay or leave an organization. An individual may commit to the organization because he/she perceives a high cost of losing organizational membership (cf. Becker&#x27;s 1960 &quot;side bet theory&quot;). 

Things like economic costs (such as pension accruals) and social costs (friendship ties with co-workers) would be costs of losing organizational membership. But an individual doesn&#x27;t see the positive costs as enough to stay with an organization they must also take into account the availability of alternatives (such as another organization), disrupt personal relationships, and other &quot;side bets&quot; that would be incurred from leaving their organization. The problem with this is that these &quot;side bets&quot; don&#x27;t occur at once but that they &quot;accumulate with age and tenure&quot;.

=== Normative commitment ===
The individual commits to and remains with an organization because of feelings of obligation, the last component of organizational commitment. These feelings may derive from a strain on an individual before and after joining an organization. For example, the organization may have invested resources in training an employee who then feels a &#x27;moral&#x27; obligation to put forth effort on the job and stay with the organization to &#x27;repay the debt.&#x27; It may also reflect an internalized norm, developed before the person joins the organization through family or other socialization processes, that one should be loyal to one&#x27;s organization. The employee stays with the organization because he/she &quot;ought to&quot;. But generally if an individual invest a great deal they will receive &quot;advanced rewards&quot;. 

Normative commitment is higher in organizations that value loyalty and systematically communicate the fact to employees with rewards, incentives and other strategies. Normative commitment in employees is also high where employees regularly see visible examples of the employer being committed to employee well-being. An employee with greater organizational commitment has a greater chance of contributing to organizational success and will also experience higher levels of job satisfaction. High levels of job satisfaction, in turn, reduces employee turnover and increases the organization&#x27;s ability to recruit and retain talent. Meyer and Allen based their research in this area more on theoretical evidence rather than empirical, which may explain the lack of depth in this section of their study compared to the others. They drew off Wiener&#x27;s (2005) research for this commitment component.

=== Critique to the three-component model ===
Since the model was made, there has been conceptual critique to what the model is trying to achieve. Specifically from three psychologists, Omar Solinger, Woody Olffen, and Robert Roe. To date, the three-component conceptual model has been regarded as the leading model for organizational commitment because it ties together three aspects of earlier commitment research (Becker, 2005; Buchanan, 2005; Kanter, 1968; Mathieu &amp; Zajac, 1990; Mowday, Porter, &amp; Steers, 1982; Salancik, 2004; Weiner, 2004; Weiner &amp; Vardi, 2005). However, a collection of studies have shown that the model is not consistent with empirical findings. Solinger, Olffen, and Roe use a later model by Alice Eagly and Shelly Chaiken, Attitude-behavior Model (2004), to present that TCM combines different attitude phenomena. They have come to the conclusion that TCM is a model for predicting turnover. In a sense the model describes why people should stay with the organization whether it is because they want to, need to, or ought to. The model appears to mix together an attitude toward a target, that being the organization, with an attitude toward a behavior, which is leaving or staying. They believe the studies should return to the original understanding of organizational commitment as an attitude toward the organization and measure it accordingly. Although the TCM is a good way to predict turnover, these psychologists do not believe it should be the general model. Because Eagly and Chaiken&#x27;s model is so general, it seems that the TCM can be described as a specific subdivision of their model when looking at a general sense of organizational commitment. It becomes clear that affective commitment equals an attitude toward a target, while continuance and normative commitment are representing different concepts referring to anticipated behavioral outcomes, specifically staying or leaving. This observation backs up their conclusion that organizational commitment is perceived by TCM as combining different target attitudes and behavioral attitudes, which they believe to be both confusing and logically incorrect. The attitude-behavioral model can demonstrate explanations for something that would seem contradictory in the TCM. That is that affective commitment has stronger associations with relevant behavior and a wider range of behaviors, compared to normative and continuance commitment. Attitude toward a target (the organization) is obviously applicable to a wider range of behaviors than an attitude toward a specific behavior (staying). After their research, Sollinger, Olffen, and Roe believe Eagly and Chaiken&#x27;s attitude-behavior model from 1993 would be a good alternative model to look at as a general organizational commitment predictor because of its approach at organizational commitment as a singular construct, which in turn would help predicting various behaviors beyond turnover.

=== A five component commitment model ===
More recently, scholars have proposed a five component model of commitment, though it has been developed in the context of product and service consumption. This model proposes habitual and forced commitment as two additional dimensions which are very germane in consumption settings. It seems, however, that habitual commitment or inertial may also become relevant in many job settings. People get habituated to a job—the routine, the processes, the cognitive schemas associated with a job can make people develop a latent commitment to the job—just as it may occur in a consumption setting. The paper—by Keiningham and colleagues also compared applications of the TCM in job settings and in consumption settings to develop additional insights.

== Job satisfaction ==

Job satisfaction is commonly defined as the extent to which employees like their work. Researchers have examined Job satisfaction for the past several decades. Studies have been devoted to figuring out the dimensions of job satisfaction, antecedents of job satisfaction, and the relationship between satisfaction and commitment. Satisfaction has also been examined under various demographics of gender, age, race, education, and work experience. Most research on job satisfaction has been aimed towards the person-environment fit paradigm. Job satisfaction has been found to be an important area of research because one of the top reasons individuals give for leaving a job is dissatisfaction.

Much of the literature on the relationship between commitment and satisfaction with one&#x27;s job indicates that if employees are satisfied they develop stronger commitment to their work. Kalleberg (1990) studied work attitudes of workers in the US and Japan and found a correlation of 0.73 between job satisfaction and organizational commitment of workers in Japan and a higher significant correlation of 0.81 among Americans. A study conducted by Dirani and Kuchinke produced results indicating a strong correlation between job commitment and job satisfaction and that satisfaction was a reliable predictor of commitment. Job satisfaction among employees—at least in retail settings—can also strengthen the association between customer satisfaction and customer loyalty.

;Perceiving a &quot;Calling&quot;: A study at the University of Florida found a positive correlation between the individual&#x27;s perception of their career being a &quot;calling&quot; and the level of commitment to the job. This study looked at the relation between work commitment and participant&#x27;s perception of meaning in their job. Participants were tested in the areas of; perceiving a calling, job satisfaction, and job commitment. Results showed a moderate correlation between participants perceiving a calling and job commitment and a weak correlation between perceiving a calling and job satisfaction.

=== Role Stress ===
:Dysfunctions in role performance have been associated with a large number of consequences, almost always negative, which affect the well being of workers and functioning of organizations. An individual&#x27;s experience of receiving incompatible or conflicting requests (role conflict) and/or the lack of enough information to carry out his/her job (role ambiguity) are causes of role stress. Role ambiguity and conflict decrease worker&#x27;s performance and are positively related to the probability of the workers leaving the organization. Role conflict and ambiguity have been proposed as determining factors of workers&#x27; job satisfaction and organizational commitment.

=== Empowerment ===
:Empowerment in the workplace has had several different definitions over the years. It has been considered &#x27;energizing followers through leadership, enhancing self efficacy by reducing powerlessness and increasing intrinsic task motivation.&#x27; A psychological view of empowerment describes it as &#x27;a process of intrinsic motivation, perceived control, competence, and energizing towards achieving goals.&#x27; There are two prominent concepts of empowerment. The first is Structural Empowerment which comes from the Organizational/Management Theory and is described as the ability to get things done and to mobilize resources. The second is Psychological Empowerment which comes from Social Psychological models and is described as psychological perceptions/attitudes of employees about their work and their organizational roles. A study done by Ahmad et al. found support for the relationship between empowerment and job satisfaction and job commitment. The study looked at nurses working in England and nurses working in Malaysia. Taking cultural context into consideration, the study still showed a positive correlation between empowerment and job satisfaction/commitment.

=== Job Insecurity and Employability ===
:In a study conducted by De Cuyper research found that workers who were on fixed-term contracts or considered &quot;temporary workers&quot; reported higher levels of job insecurity than permanent workers. Job insecurity was found to negatively correlate with job satisfaction and affective organizational commitment in permanent workers. The study also found that job satisfaction and organizational commitment were highly correlated with being a permanent worker.

=== Distribution of Leadership ===
A study conducted by Hulpia et al. focused on the impact of the distribution of leadership and leadership support among teachers and how that affected job satisfaction and commitment. The study found that there was a strong relationship between organizational commitment and the cohesion of the leadership team and the amount of leadership support. Previously held beliefs about job satisfaction and commitment among teachers was that they were negatively correlated with absenteeism and turnover and positively correlated with job effort and job performance. This study examined how one leader (usually a principal) effected the job satisfaction and commitment of teachers. The study found that when leadership was distributed by the &#x27;leader&#x27; out to the teachers as well workers reported higher job satisfaction and organizational commitment than when most of the leadership fell to one person. Even when it was only the perception of distributed leadership roles workers still reported high levels of job satisfaction/commitment.

== Shift to organizational &quot;change&quot; commitment ==
By the end of the 1990s, leaders did not find the value in understanding whether or not their people were more or less committed to the organization. It was particularly frustrating that leaders could see that people committed to the organization were not as committed to strategic change initiatives, the majority of which failed to live up to expectations. John Meyer responded to this gap by proposing a model of organizational change commitment. 

The new model includes the same 3-components, but also includes a &quot;behavioral commitment&quot; scale: &quot;resistance&quot;, &quot;passive resistance&quot;, &quot;compliance&quot;, &quot;cooperation&quot;, and &quot;championing&quot;. Though Meyer does not cite him, a peer reviewed source for behavioral commitment comes from Leon Coetsee in South Africa. Coetsee brought the resistance-to-commitment model of &quot;Harvard&quot; consultant Arnold Judson to academic research and has continued developing the model as late as 2011.

== Guidelines to enhance ==
Five rules help to enhance organizational commitment:
;Commit to people-first values: Put it in writing, hire the right-kind managers, and walk the talk.
;Clarify and communicate your mission: Clarify the mission and ideology; make it charismatic; use value-based hiring practices; stress values-based orientation and training; build tradition.
;Guarantee organizational justice: Have a comprehensive grievance procedure; provide for extensive two-way communications.
;Community of practice: Build value-based homogeneity; share and share alike; emphasize barnraising, cross-utilization, and teamwork; getting people to work together.
;Support employee development: Commit to actualizing; provide first-year job challenge; enrich and empower; promote from within; provide developmental activities; provide employee security without guarantees.

<text>Lorne Hyman Greene (born Lyon Himan Green; 12 February 1915 – 11 September 1987) was a Canadian actor, musician, singer and radio personality. His notable television roles include Ben Cartwright on the Western &quot;Bonanza&quot; and Commander Adama in the original science-fiction television series &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; and &quot;Galactica 1980&quot;. He also worked on the Canadian television nature documentary series &quot;Lorne Greene&#x27;s New Wilderness&quot; and in television commercials.

==Early life and career in Canada==
Greene was born Lyon Himan Green in Ottawa, Ontario, to Jewish immigrants from the Russian Empire, Dora (née Grinovsky) and Daniel Green, a shoemaker. He was called &quot;Chaim&quot; by his mother, and his name is shown as &quot;Hyman&quot; on his school report cards. In a biography of him, written by his daughter, she wrote that it was unknown when he began using the name Lorne, nor when he added an &quot;e&quot; to Green. 

Greene was the drama instructor at Camp Arowhon, a summer camp in Algonquin Park, Ontario, Canada, where he developed his talents.

Greene began acting while attending Queen&#x27;s University in Kingston, where he acquired a knack for broadcasting with the Radio Workshop of the university&#x27;s Drama Guild on the campus radio station CFRC. 

He gave up on a career in chemical engineering, and upon graduation, found a job as a radio broadcaster for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). 

During World War II, Greene served as a Flying officer in the Royal Canadian Air Force. 

Afterward, he was assigned as the principal newsreader on the CBC National News, with CBC gave him the nickname &quot;The Voice of Canada&quot;. However, following Canada&#x27;s entry into World War II in 1939, his role in delivering distressing war news in sonorous tones with his deep, resonant voice caused many listeners to call him &quot;The Voice of Doom&quot;, especially as he was delegated the dreaded list of soldiers killed in the war. 

During his radio days, Greene invented a stopwatch which ran backwards (i.e. it would start from a given number and count down to zero); this helped radio announcers gauge how much time was left while speaking.

During his CBC radio career, Greene also narrated documentary films, such as the National Film Board of Canada&#x27;s &quot;Fighting Norway&quot; (1943).

Greene left the CBC and became a freelancer after the war when the network ordered staff announcers to turn over a large percentage of any income they earned from film narration. Greene continued to appear on CBC on a freelance basis while becoming the newsreader for private radio station CKEY in Toronto, while also returning to acting work both on stage and in radio plays.

After closing his Academy of Radio Arts in 1952, Greene relocated to the United States. Katharine Cornell cast him twice in her Broadway productions. In 1953, he was cast in &quot;The Prescott Proposals.&quot; In that same year, she cast him in a verse drama by Christopher Fry, &quot;The Dark is Light Enough.&quot; Greene likewise began appearing in isolated episodes on live television in the 1950s. In 1953, he was seen in the title role of a one-hour adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello.&quot; In 1954, he made his Hollywood debut as Saint Peter in &quot;The Silver Chalice&quot; and made several more films and appearances on American television. In 1955, he starred in the British Canadian TV series &quot;Sailor of Fortune&quot;. In 1955, he was Ludwig van Beethoven in an episode of the TV version of &quot;You Are There&quot;, and also appeared as Marcus Brutus in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; at the Stratford Festival. In 1957, Greene played the prosecutor in &quot;Peyton Place.&quot;

==American television==

The first of his continuing TV roles was as the patriarch Ben &quot;Pa&quot; Cartwright in &quot;Bonanza&quot;, the first one-hour Western series filmed in colour (1959–1973), making Greene a household name. He garnered the role after his performance as O&#x27;Brien in the CBS production of &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;.

In the 1960s, Greene capitalized on his image as Ben Cartwright by recording several albums of country-western/folk songs, which Greene performed in a mixture of spoken word and singing. In 1964, Greene had a number-one single on the music charts with his spoken-word ballad, &quot;Ringo&quot; (which referred to the real-life Old West outlaw Johnny Ringo), and got play time from &quot;Saga of the Ponderosa&quot;, which detailed the Cartwright founding of the famous ranch.

In 1973, after the cancellation of &quot;Bonanza&quot; following a 14-year run, Greene joined Ben Murphy in the ABC crime drama, &quot;Griff&quot;, about a Los Angeles, California, police officer, Wade &quot;Griff&quot; Griffin, who retires to become a private detective. When it failed to gain sufficient ratings and was cancelled after 13 episodes, Greene thereafter hosted the syndicated nature documentary series &quot;Last of the Wild&quot; from 1974 to 1975.

In the 1977 miniseries &quot;Roots&quot;, he played the first master of Kunta Kinte, John Reynolds. Through the 1970s, Greene was the spokesman for Alpo Beef Chunks dog food commercials, one of the possible origins of the phrase &quot;Eating your own dog food&quot;. 

In 2007, &quot;TV Guide&quot; listed Ben Cartwright as the nation&#x27;s second-most popular TV father (behind Cliff Huxtable). Greene was also known for his role as Commander Adama, another patriarchal figure, in the science-fiction television series &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; (1978–1979) and &quot;Galactica 1980&quot; (1980). Greene&#x27;s typecasting as a wise father character continued with the 1981 series &quot;Code Red&quot; as a fire-department chief, whose command includes his children as subordinates. Greene appeared with his former &quot;Bonanza&quot; co-star Michael Landon on an episode of &quot;Highway to Heaven&quot;. Greene also appeared with his former &quot;Bonanza&quot; co-star Pernell Roberts on a two-part episode of &quot;Vega$&quot;.

He appeared in the 1986 HBO mockumentary &quot;The Canadian Conspiracy&quot;, about the supposed subversion of the United States by Canadian-born media personalities. For nearly a decade, Greene co-hosted the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade on NBC with Betty White.

==Back on Canadian television==

In the 1980s, Greene devoted his energies to wildlife and environmental issues, including hosting and narrating the CTV&#x27;s nature series &quot;Lorne Greene&#x27;s New Wilderness&quot;, a show which promoted environmental awareness.

==Personal life==
Greene was married twice, first to Rita Hands of Toronto (19381960, divorced). They had two children, twins born in 1944. His second wife was Nancy Deale (19611987, Greene&#x27;s death), with whom he had one child.

The Ponderosa II House was built by Greene in 1960 in Mesa, Arizona. It is located at 602 S. Edgewater Drive. It is a replica of the Bonanza set house from the former Ponderosa Ranch in Incline Village, Nevada. It is listed in the Mesa Historic Property Register.

==Death==
Greene died on 11 September 1987, aged 72, from complications from pneumonia, following ulcer surgery, at Saint Johns&#x27; Hospital in Santa Monica, California. He was interred at Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City.

==Honours and awards==
Greene was made an Officer of the Order of Canada on 28 October 1969, &quot;for services to the Performing Arts and to the community.&quot;

Greene was awarded an honorary doctor of laws degree by his alma mater, Queen&#x27;s University, in 1971. He was the 1987 recipient of the Earle Grey Award for Lifetime Achievement at the Canadian Gemini Awards. He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1559 N. Vine Street.

In 1974, Greene received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

In February 1985, Greene was the Krewe of Bacchus King of Mardi Gras.

In May 2006, Greene became one of the first of four entertainers to ever be honoured by Canada Post by being featured on a 51-cent postage stamp.

Greene was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame, found on King Street and Simcoe Street in Toronto, in 2015.

==Lorne Greene Academy of Radio Arts==
Greene founded the Lorne Greene Academy of Radio Arts in Toronto in 1945 and was its dean. The school trained a number of future broadcasters and actors including Leslie Nielsen, James Doohan, Les Rubie, Gordie Tapp, Fred Davis, Billie Mae Richards, William Davidson, Alfie Scopp, Murray Chercover, Jonathan Frid, Cec Linder, Les Lye, Bill Luxton, and Roy Currie. The school was located on Jarvis Street across from what was then the CBC Radio building. Its faculty included many CBC staff such as Mavor Moore, Fletcher Markle, Lister Sinclair, Andrew Allan, and Esse Ljungh, and graduated a total of 381 students in seven years, 90% of whom found work in the industry. Though successful academically, the school continually lost money, resulting in Greene closing the school in 1952, allowing him to sell the building to recoup his losses.

<doc id="181249" wikidata="Q2942" url="?curid=181249" title="Solingen">
<text>Solingen (; ) is a city in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, 25 km east of Düsseldorf along the northern edge of the Bergisches Land, south of the Ruhr. After Wuppertal, it is the second-largest city in the Bergisches Land, and a member of the regional authority of the Rhineland.

Solingen is called the &quot;City of Blades&quot;, and has long been renowned for the manufacturing of fine swords, knives, scissors and razors made by firms such as WKC, DOVO, Wüsthof, Zwilling J. A. Henckels, Böker, Güde, Hubertus, Diefenthal, Puma, Clauberg/Klauberg, Eickhorn, Linder, Carl Schmidt Sohn, Dreiturm, Herder, Martor Safety Knives, Wolfertz, Ralf Aust and numerous other manufacturers.

The medieval swordsmiths of Solingen designed the town&#x27;s coat of arms. In the late 17th century, a group of swordsmiths from Solingen broke their guild oaths by taking their sword-making secrets with them to Shotley Bridge, County Durham, in England.

==Geography==

Solingen lies southwest of Wuppertal in the Bergisches Land. The city has an area of , of which roughly 50% is used for agriculture, horticulture, or forestry. The city&#x27;s border is long, and the city&#x27;s dimensions are east to west and north to south. The Wupper river, a right tributary of the Rhine, flows through the city for . The city&#x27;s highest point at 276 metres (906 ft) is in the northern borough of Gräfrath at the Light Tower, previously the water tower, and the lowest point at 53 metres (174 ft) is in the southwest.

===Neighbouring cities and communities===
The following cities and communities share a border with Solingen, starting in the northeast and going clockwise around the city:
* Wuppertal (unitary urban district)
* Remscheid (unitary urban district)
* Wermelskirchen (within the Rheinisch-Bergischer district)
* Leichlingen (Rheinisch-Bergischer district)
* Langenfeld (within the district of Mettmann)
* Hilden (Mettmann)

===City administration===
Solingen currently consists of five Stadtbezirke, or boroughs. Each borough has a municipal council of either 13 or 15 representatives (&quot;Bezirksvertreter&quot;) elected every five years by the borough&#x27;s population. The municipal councils are responsible for many of the boroughs&#x27; important administrative affairs.

The five city boroughs:
* Gräfrath
* Wald (Solingen)
* (Solingen-)Mitte
* Ohligs/Aufderhöhe/Merscheid
* Höhscheid/Burg

Ohligs/Aufderhöhe/Merscheid and Höhscheid/Burg are divided into sections (&quot;Stadtteile&quot;) that were once separate towns and are still statistical and planning units but are no longer self-governing.

==History==
===Middle Ages===

Solingen was first mentioned in 1067 by a chronicler who called the area &quot;Solonchon&quot;. Early variations of the name included &quot;Solengen&quot;, &quot;Solungen&quot;, and &quot;Soleggen&quot;, although the modern name seems to have been in use since the late 14th and early 15th centuries.

Blacksmiths&#x27; smelters, dating back over 2000 years, have been found around the town, adding to Solingen&#x27;s fame as a Northern Europe blacksmith centre. Swords from Solingen have turned up in places such as the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in the British Isles. Northern Europe prized the quality of Solingen&#x27;s manufactured weaponry, and they were traded across the European continent. Solingen today remains the knife-centre of Germany.

It was a tiny village for centuries, but became a fortified town in the 15th century.

===Thirty Years&#x27; War===
After being ravaged by the plague with about 1,800 deaths in 1614–1619, Solingen was heavily fought over during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, repeatedly attacked and plundered, and the Burg Castle was destroyed.

===Modern Age===
Early in the 20th century, Ohligs&#x27;s chief manufactures were cutlery and hardware, and there were iron-foundries and flour mills. Other industries were brewing, dyeing, weaving and brick-making.
In 1929, Ohligs located in the Prussian Rhine Province, by rail north of Cologne became part of Solingen.

In World War II, the Old Town was completely destroyed by a bombing raid by the RAF in 1944; 1,800 people died and over 1,500 people were injured. As such, there are few pre-war sites in the centre.

From 1945 to 1949 Solingen was part of the British occupation zone. Reconstruction of the old town began in 1949. The newly built Protestant church in Fronhof was consecrated in 1954, and the destroyed towers of the Catholic church of St. Clemens were rebuilt in a different style. By the end of the 1970s, the city&#x27;s population had increased due to numerous new housing developments in all parts of the city. The city&#x27;s infrastructure continued to grow, with the opening of the theatre and concert hall in 1963 and the construction of the Viehbachtalstraße motorway through the city in the late 1970s. In 1975, the city grew again with the incorporation of the previously independent town of Burg an der Wupper. In 1993, Solingen made international headlines for a right-wing extremist arson attack in which five Turkish girls and women were killed. The attack was followed by demonstrations and riots in the city.

Since the beginning of the new millennium, the &quot;Klingenstadt&quot; has undergone a massive transformation as a result of urban development projects such as Regionale 2006 and City 2013. For example, the new Korkenzieherstrasse cycle path was created and the demolition of the Turmhotel and the former Karstadt Passage made it possible to build a new shopping centre on Neumarkt in Solingen-Mitte. After the closure of the old central station in Solingen-Mitte, Ohligs station was officially named the new Solingen central station by Deutsche Bahn AG on 10 December 2006.

On 23 August 2024, a mass stabbing by islamic terrorist occurred in which three German citizens were killed during a festival for the city&#x27;s 650th founding anniversary.

==Population==
Solingen&#x27;s population doubled between the years 1880 and 1890 due to the incorporation of the town of Dorp into Solingen in 1889, at which time the population reached 36,000. The population again received a large boost on 1 August 1929 through the incorporation of Ohligs, Wald, Höhscheid, and Gräfrath into the city limits. This brought the population above the 100,000 mark, which gave Solingen the distinction of being a &quot;large city&quot; (&quot;Großstadt&quot;). The number of inhabitants peaked in 1971 with 177,899 residents, and the 2006 population figure was 163,263.

The following chart shows the population figures within Solingen&#x27;s city limits at the respective points in time. The figures are derived from census estimates or numbers provided by statistical offices or city agencies, with the exception of figures preceding 1843, which were gathered using inconsistent recording techniques.


30.9% of the population of Solingen has foreign roots (statistics 2012).

==Politics==
===Mayor===
The people of Solingen have been able to elect a council and a mayor since 1374, the year the town was granted its charter. The mayor changed annually on 24 June. Solingen has had a mayor since 1896. During the Nazi era (1933–1945), the mayor was appointed by the NSDAP and not democratically elected by the people of Solingen.

After the Second World War, the military government of the British occupation zone appointed a Lord Mayor. From 1946, the Solingen City Council elected an honorary Lord Mayor and a full-time Lord Mayor from among its members. Until 1997, the honorary lord mayors had mainly representative functions, while the full-time lord mayors were the chief administrative officers of the city of Solingen. In 1997, the dual leadership of the city administration was abolished. Since then there has been only one full-time Lord Mayor. He is the chairman of the council, the head of the city administration and the first representative of the city. Since 1999, the Lord Mayor has been directly elected by the electorate in a secret ballot.

The current mayor of Solingen is Tim Kurzbach of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), elected in 2015 and re-elected in 2020. The most recent mayoral election was held on 13 September 2020, and the results were as follows:

==Religion==
===Christianity===
Solingen has belonged from its beginnings to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cologne (&quot;Erzbistum Köln&quot;), and more specifically to the Archdeaconry of the Probst (&quot;provost&quot;) of St. Kunibert, the deanery of Deutz. For reasons that are unclear, the city has long been associated with St. Clement, the third Pope, symbols of whose martyrdom appear on the city’s shield.
Although the Protestant Reformation gradually made gains in the city, which was under the control of the Counts of Berg, the population by and large remained Roman Catholic for a while. The Catholic community was newly endowed by the local lord in 1658 and in 1701 received a new church building. In 1827 Solingen became the seat of its own deanery within the newly defined Archdiocese of Cologne, to which the city&#x27;s current parishes still belong.

As mentioned, the Reformation only gradually gained a foothold in Solingen. A reformed church affiliated with the Bergisch synod was established in 1590, and the city&#x27;s parish church became reformed in 1649. Lutherans had been present in Solingen since the beginning of the 17th century, and a Lutheran congregation was founded in 1635. In 1672 a formalized religious agreement was reached between the city&#x27;s religious groups. The Reformation was also introduced in Gräfrath in 1590, where a church council was apparently established in 1629. The Reformed and Lutheran churches were formed into a united church community in 1838 following the general merger of Reformed and Lutheran churches in Prussia in 1817.

The Protestant parishes originally belonged to the district synod of Lennep, today part of the city Remscheid. A new synod was established in Solingen in 1843, and the city acquired its own superintendent, a form of church administrator. This formed the basis for the present-day Church District of Solingen, a member of the Evangelical Church in the Rhineland. With the exception of the free churches, most Protestant churches belong to the Church District of Solingen.

Today approximately 34% of Solingen&#x27;s population belongs to Protestant churches, and roughly 26% belong to Catholic churches. Other church communities in Solingen include Greek Orthodox, Evangelical Free (including Baptist and Brethren), Methodist, Seventh-day Adventist, Pentecostal, Salvation Army, and free churches. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and the New Apostolic Church also have communities in Solingen.

<text>Molde Airport (; ) is an international airport serving the town of Molde, Norway. It is on the shore of the Moldefjord at Årø, east of town center. The airport&#x27;s catchment area covers the district of Romsdal.

The airport features a runway measuring , aligned 07/25. Owned and operated by the state-owned Avinor, the airport served 481,406 passengers in 2014. Scheduled services are provided domestically to Oslo by Scandinavian Airlines and Norwegian Air Shuttle, and to Bergen, Stord and Trondheim by Widerøe.

Proposals for an airport serving Molde were discussed from 1940, but the neighboring towns of Ålesund and Kristiansund were ultimately prioritized. Construction commenced in 1969 and the airport opened on 5 April 1972. Scheduled services were granted to Braathens SAFE, who variously operated Fokker F-27s and Fokker F-28s, later also with larger Boeing 737s. The government took over operation from 1978. New or expansions of the terminals have taken place four times, in 1982, 1993, 2008 and 2012. Inclusive tour (IT) charters have been offered since 2004.

==History==
===Planning===
Proposals for an airport serving Molde were first put forward in 1940. Following the German occupation of Norway, Luftwaffe was interested in building an airfield to cover the county of Møre og Romsdal. They considered two sites—Årø and the island of Gossen in Aukra. The latter was selected, resulting in the construction of Aukra Airport, Gossen with its wooden runway. Following the end of the war, a civilian commission looked into building a civilian, central airport for the county. It concluded that Gossen was a suitable site as it was flat and situated between the major towns of Ålesund and Molde. Significant investments had been made and the cost of converting the facility to a civilian airport would be low. However, there was some opposition to the plans. There were complaints that the airport was located too far from Kristiansund and Ålesund and that the county would be best served with multiple airports. Parliament approved the airport at Gossen in 1952.

West Norway Airlines established a seaplane route from Bergen via Ålesund, Molde and Kristiansund to Trondheim in 1950. In Molde it operated out of a water airport situated at the port in the town center. The airline proposed in 1954 that four short take-off and landing airports be built along the coast, including one in Molde. They hoped to serve these using Scottish Aviation Twin Pioneers. Årø was the preferred site, although Langmyren was also considered. However, the aircraft were not approved by the authorities, mostly because of an insufficient de-icing system. This resulted in that the plans for Ålesund Airport, Vigra to be prioritized, and soon the site was upgraded to primary airport, allowing it to open on 7 June 1958. West Norway Airlines closed shut down its flights from Molde after the 1956 season.

As a response, Molde Municipality established an airport committee in September 1958 and bought land at Årø, which at the time was located in the municipality of Bolsøy. Led by merchant Petter Pettersson, it proposed the construction of a runway, allowing it to handle Braathens SAFE&#x27;s Fokker F-27 Friendships. At this time Molde Municipality was free to build a municipal airport, granted it followed safety regulations. This required trial landings, but due to limited capacity these were not conducted by the Civil Aviation Administration until October 1961. By then the rules had changed and airports needed a state concession to operate. A government airport commission was approved in 1962, placing all local airport plans on hold. The commission recommended that new safety margins be introduced, forcing a larger plot of land to be acquired. The effected land owners were not interested in selling, forcing the municipality to expropriate the land. The issue was not finalized until the Supreme Court came with a final ruling in favor of the municipality.

The state commission considered several locations which could serve Molde and Kristiansund, either jointly or by building two airports. Discarded sites included Gossen, Ytre Fræna, Henda in Averøy, Osmarka and Tingvoll. Only Årø and Kvernberget in Kristiansund were found suitable, with pivoting emphasis laid on their vicinity to their respective town centers. The commission concluded in 1964 that Kristiansund would receive the highest priority, along with Harstad/Narvik Airport, Evenes. Molde was ranked third.

Molde Municipality accepted the priority, but determined in June 1965 that they were free to finance an airport themselves. The municipal administration started working on plans and on 26 April 1966 Braathens SAFE confirmed that the airline was willing to connect Molde to Oslo, Trondheim and Bergen. Årø was aided in 1968 when the Civil Aviation Administration altered the priority of the airports, placing Molde at the top. It cited lower investments, stipulated at 13.2 million Norwegian krone rather than 22.4 million for Kvernberget. The municipality contacted contractor Olav T. Meisingset, who came with a bid for the leveling of the site. The municipality secured a loan from Kommunal Landspensjonskasse and applied the Ministry of Transport and Communications in 1969 for permission to start construction. They stated they were neutral, while the Ministry of Local Government was positive. By then construction of Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget was already under way, with the airport opening on 30 June 1970. There was a certain amount of controversy regarding the construction of Molde Airport. This would leave a smaller catchment area for the two airports, which could jeopardize good services from the region as a whole.

===Construction===
Ground work was contracted to Olav T. Meisingset &amp; Co., with work commencing in early 1969. They used 110,000 man-hours to move of earthwork. This involved filling in part of Moldefjorden, although the moraine ground eased the work. At the most thirty people were working on the project. When the groundwork was completed, there was interest from private aircraft to land. They were only held off by placing construction equipment strategically along the runway. After the asphalt was laid in 1970, the first such aircraft landed. They continued to use the aerodrome during the winter, without any official permission, yet without the airport authority taking any action to hinder the use. The first official landing was a test flight flown by the CAA on 17 March 1971. Next work commenced on the terminal, operations building and control tower. The main contractor was Arne Moen.

Airport employees started their new jobs on 1 March 1972. The same day Braathens SAFE opened a ticket office at Godtfred Lies plass in downtown Molde. The office also handled local sale of tickets for Widerøe. The official opening of the airport took place on 5 April and was attended by between seven and eight thousand people. The airport initially had fourteen employees. At the time of opening the instrument landing system was not yet installed. A non-directional beacon was installed on Tautra and a visual approach slope indicator at the runway. Later in 1972 two localizers were installed. The airport received a café.

===Early operational history===

The airport was dimensioned to handle one Fokker F-27 Friendship at a time. These aircraft were used by Braathens SAFE on both the coastal routes and the services to the capital. The 1972 summer routes involved three daily services to Oslo Airport, Fornebu, including one with a stop-over in Ålesund. Some of the larger routes instead were flown using the Fokker F-28 Fellowship. There were also three daily services on the coastal route. In cases when Ålesund Airport, Vigra was closed, Braathens would land their larger 124-seat Boeing 737-200s at Årø, making the terminal feel cramped.

Braathens SAFE were awarded the routes to the three primary airports in Møre og Romsdal as part of an arrangement where they split the primary market between themselves and Scandinavian Airlines System. Ålesund had by far the most traffic, about three times that of Molde and Kristiansund. Because they had to operate to three airports in close vicinity, they were unable to operate profitably from any of them. The services were cross-subsidized by the airline being granted monopolies on other routes with higher ridership and profitable operations.

Molde Aero Klubb was established on 6 October 1972. It initially had limited activity and did not have its own aircraft until November 1984. However, many of its members owned their own aircraft. Møre Flyklubb based its Piper Cherokees at Årø. In the first full year of operation—1973—the airport handled 70,227 passengers. Construction of oil platforms was carried out in Åndalsnes during the 1970s, leadingto frequent use of the airport by business jets. To bypass two ferry rides, a seaplane base was built at Årø to allow for connecting flights to the yard.

Increased ridership caused Braathens SAFE to replace all its F-27 turboprops with larger F-28 turbojets out of Molde from 1 June 1976. F-28s had until then only been used on Oslo-bound flights via Ålesund to Oslo, as well as on some coastal services. Travel time on direct Oslo flights was cut by 25 minutes. During the late 1970s Braathens SAFE introduced the Boeing 737 on the Oslo flights. Meanwhile, a court case was raised by thirty-four neighbors who demanded compensation due to noise pollution. Nineteen of these were awarded compensation by the court in 1998.

Ownership and operation of the airport passed from the municipality to the state, through the Civil Aviation Administration, in 1978. This led to more manning of the facility. The airport increased from three to four shifts—increasing its opening hours—and also increased the number of people per shift from three to four. New ground vehicles were also bought. Ridership fell the first years after the opening, and not until 90,063 passengers passed through the airport in 1978 did patronage exceed the 1973 figures. The first major project initiated by the CAA was the construction of a maintenance building. The municipality had let snowplows and other equipment stay parked outdoors, causing them to dilapidate into a state of disrepair. The structure opened in 1980. The apron for general aviation was expanded simultaneously.

The CAA&#x27;s next investment was a new passenger terminal. It included amenities such as a baggage carousel—allowing passengers for the first time to pick up their baggage indoors. With 106,823 passengers in 1982, the airport exceeded the six-digit mark for the first time. A parachute club, Molde Fallskjermklubb, was founded in 1985.

Busy Bee started flights to Molde on 3 March 1980, using a F-27 to fly post to Oslo. Passengers were introduced on these flights from 1985. Braathens SAFE sold their F-28s in 1986. The West Coast route saw only an average 32 passengers to and from Bergen and Stavanger, and 23 to Kristiansund per day. Too small for Boeings, Braathens subcontracted the operations to is regional affiliate, Busy Bee, from March 1986. Patronage to Oslo increased sufficiently that Braathens the same year eliminated all stop-overs in Ålesund. The first proposals for charter flights were launched by Gullivers Reisebyrå in January 1986. They intended to fly a connecting flight to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen and from there onwards to the Mediterranean. Although a contract was signed with Busy Bee, noting came of the plans due to limited interest. Widerøe withdrew from services at Molde in 1987.

An airport coach service was introduced on 4 January 1988. The same year the CAA announced plans to build a new terminal and operations building. Traffic grew rapidly during the 1980s and hit 173,530 passengers that year. Meanwhile, there was a discussion if there was need for both Årø and Kvernberget, and both airports were proposed closed. However, the move was never official from either the CAA nor any political agencies and was confined to speculations in the press. The background for was the 1991 opening of the Kristiansand Fixed Link, which removed the ferry between the two towns.

The airport was partially flooded on 19 January 1989 when Årlelva breached its banks. The riverbed was subsequently moved and areas was freed up to allow for more parking, both on the air and land side. The airport partook in a major military exercise in 1991. The discussion regarding the airport&#x27;s future was sealed on 6 April 1992 when the CAA announced the construction of a new terminal. Work commenced later that year and Braathens SAFE followed up with the construction of a freight terminal. The CAA invested NOK 54 million, of which 30 million was for the terminal. The airport was closed for a week in September 1993 to re-asphalt the runway and move systems to the new terminal, which opened on 13 September. It was designed to handle 300,000 passengers per year and had three gates. In addition to larger arrival and departure halls, offices were provided for car rental companies. After the official opening took place on 14 October, the old terminal building was demolished to make way for more parking.

===Deregulation===

Traffic hit 201,864 passengers in 1993. That year Busy Bee folded and their regional routes were taken over by Norwegian Air Shuttle, using the Fokker 50. The airline market was deregulated on 1 April 1994; thereafter any airline was free to fly any route in Norway. SAS chose initially to not take up the competition with Braathens out of Molde, and the only immediate effect was a slight hike in ticket prices. Later that year Braathens increased from three to four daily services to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. An air show was held at the airport on 30 June 1996, but it proved a failure due to overcast weather. The control tower was upgraded in 1997. As an interim solution a temporary tower was erected to serve in its place.

From 1 September 1997 security controls were introduced on a limited number of domestic passengers and all international passengers. This led to the physical separation of the check-in and departure halls. For passengers this had a dramatic effect on travel times. Passengers without check-in baggage had previously been able to meet at the airport five to ten minutes before boarding time and reach their aircraft. Security controls became a bottle-neck, with peaks just before departures and otherwise minimal traffic. Long queues were commonplace.

Molde FK had a good spell in European football before and after the turn of the millennium. Chartered aircraft with players and supporters attending games at Molde stadion normally constituted the bulk of international passengers at the airport in these years. The Danish carriers Muk Air and Scan Con Airways flew charter services from Molde to Aalborg Airport and Thisted Airport, respectively during the summer of 2000. Muk operated a Shorts 360 while Scan Con operated an Embraer 110 Bandeirante. The airport served 311,988 passengers that year, but fell the following years as part of the general slump in the aviation market.

Braathens was bought by SAS and became part of the SAS Group on 1 September 2002. That day SAS Ground Services took over ground handling at the airport. SAS Commuter look over Norwegian Air Shuttle&#x27;s regional routes on 31 March 2003. Norwegian instead relaunched itself as a low-cost carrier. It opened a route from Molde to Oslo using a Boeing 737-300 from 19 June. It flew once a day during the afternoon. Although featuring low prices, its inconvenient time slot left it with few passengers, especially business travelers. Norwegian pulled out of the route in January 2004. The first inclusive tour (IT) charter was started by Apollo on 14 June to Crete. It was flown weekly by a Boeing 737-700 operated by Braathens. Combined the football and IT charters drew 3,037 international passengers to the airport in 2003.

Molde&#x27;s first airline was Classic Norway Air, established with a Jetstream 31 in 2004. Its business idea was to fly tourists staying at their resorts in Romsdal. Braathens merged with Scandinavian Airlines in Norway to create SAS Braathens that year. They introduced Molde&#x27;s first international route, to Barcelona, six Sundays starting 20 June. Work on the gas terminal at Nyhamna in Gossen started in May 2004. With many construction workers from other parts of the country and abroad, it brought an increase to traffic at the airport. Most of this flying was subcontracted to Atlantic Airways. They flew up to two daily charter flights to Gdańsk as well as weekly services to Inverness, Newcastle, Billund, Bergen, Stord and Stavanger.

IT charter services to Las Palmas commenced on 28 October 2005. Work on a new operations building started in December, costing 60 million kroner. Coast Air introduced services from Molde to Haugesund, Bergen and Trondheim in 2006 and West Air Sweden won the contract to fly the post. SAS Braathens had by then increased to five daily flights to Oslo and reached a load factor of ninety percent.

Work on the extension of the runway started on 31 January 2007, involving the moving of of earthwork. The runway was extended westwards, causing a new ILS system to be installed in that direction. Costing 57 million kroner, the work saw the strip extended by to . The extension opened on 1 July 2008. Although this allowed for longer take-off runs, the landing distances were unaffected. This allows the airport to serve as large aircraft as the Boeing 757-200 on a trans-Atlantic route.

Vildanden introduced a daily service to Skien Airport, Geiteryggen on 26 February 2007. They never reached their target ridership and terminated the route in November. With the completion of Nyhamna in the summer, ridership at the airport began to fall, dropping by 110,000 in 2008. Ving and Star Tour introduced winter IT charters to Las Palmas from October. This spurred the need for a larger terminal, with construction starting in March 2008. When completed, it could handle a full 180-seat Boeing 737-800 at both the domestic and international sections simultaneously. It also featured a duty-free shop.

Centralwings started a scheduled service to Gdańsk Lech Wałęsa Airport and Warsaw Airport on 18 February 2009. Unstable use caused it to be terminated in April. Norwegian resumed flights from Oslo to Molde on 20 August, this time using their 737-800s twice daily. SAS responded by reducing their services from five to three daily flights. Norwegian thereafter, from 1 September, introduced a third daily service. Between them ridership increased by twenty percent. Røros Flyservice was established at the airport to provide ground handling for Norwegian.

SAS terminated its Trondheim service from 1 February 2010. Within days Krohn Air was established to operate the route, using a wet leased 32-passenger Dornier 328. SAS Commuter terminated its West Coast operations in June 2010 and transferred these to Widerøe, who introduced 50- and 74-seat Bombardier Dash 8-300s and -400, respectively. Korhn Air introduced flights to Bergen from 31 August. It followed up in September with flights to Stavanger Airport, Sola. Both the Stavanger and Bergen flights were unprofitable and terminated on 19 November 2010.

A further terminal extension was completed in 2012, consisting of , mostly as a new second story. Of this, features a duty-free store. Krohn Air ceased all operations on 4 February 2014, and filed for bankruptcy the following day. Widerøe commenced flights on the Molde–Trondheim route from 1 September 2014. Wizz Air introduced two weekly flights from Gdańsk Airport to Molde starting 30 March 2015.

<doc id="181251" wikidata="Q1108653" url="?curid=181251" title="Lunar day">
<text>A lunar day is the time it takes for Earth&#x27;s Moon to complete on its axis one synodic rotation, meaning with respect to the Sun. Informally, a lunar day and a lunar night is each approx. 14 Earth days. The formal lunar day is therefore the time of a full lunar day-night cycle. Due to tidal locking, this equals the time that the Moon takes to complete one synodic orbit around Earth, a synodic lunar month, returning to the same lunar phase. The synodic period is about Earth days, which is about 2.2 days longer than its sidereal period.

==Main definition==
Relative to the fixed stars on the celestial sphere, the Moon takes 27 Earth days, 7 hours, 43 minutes, 12 seconds to complete one orbit; however, since the Earth–Moon system advances around the Sun at the same time, the Moon must travel farther to return to the same phase. On average, this synodic period lasts 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes, 3 seconds, the length of a lunar month on Earth. The exact length varies over time because the speed of the Earth–Moon system around the Sun varies slightly during a year due to the eccentricity of its elliptical orbit, variances in orbital velocity, and a number of other periodic and evolving variations about its observed, relative, mean values, which are influenced by the gravitational perturbations of the Sun and other bodies in the Solar System.

As a result, daylight at a given point on the Moon lasts approximately two weeks from beginning to end, followed by approximately two weeks of lunar night.

== Alternate usage ==

* The term &quot;lunar day&quot; may also refer to the period between moonrises or high moon in a particular location on Earth. This period is typically about 50 minutes longer than a 24-hour Earth day, as the Moon orbits the Earth in the same direction as the Earth&#x27;s axial rotation.
* The term &quot;lunar day&quot; is also used in the context of night and day, i.e., opposite to the lunar night. This is common in discussions of the huge difference in temperatures, such as discussion about lunar rovers. For example, &quot;the Soviet Union&#x27;s Luna missions [...] were designed to survive one lunar day (two Earth weeks)&quot;, while China&#x27;s Yutu-2 rover, which landed in January 2019, was designed to survive lunar nights by shutting down.

=== Lunar calendars ===

In some lunar calendars, such as the Vikram Samvat, a lunar day, or &quot;tithi&quot;, is defined as 1/30 of a lunar month, or the time it takes for the longitudinal angle between the Moon and the Sun to increase by 12 degrees. By this definition, lunar days generally vary in duration.

<doc id="181254" wikidata="Q233913" url="?curid=181254" title="Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood">
<text>Mary, Princess Royal (Victoria Alexandra Alice Mary; 25 April 1897 – 28 March 1965) was a member of the British royal family. She was the only daughter of King George V and Queen Mary, the sister of kings Edward VIII and George VI, and aunt of Elizabeth II. In the First World War, she performed charity work in support of servicemen and their families. She married Henry Lascelles, Viscount Lascelles (later the 6th Earl of Harewood), in 1922. Mary was given the title of Princess Royal in 1932. During the Second World War, she was Controller Commandant of the Auxiliary Territorial Service. The Princess Royal and the Earl of Harewood had two sons, George Lascelles, 7th Earl of Harewood, and Gerald David Lascelles.

==Early life and education==


Princess Mary was born on 25 April 1897 at York Cottage on the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, during the reign of her great-grandmother Queen Victoria. She was the third child and only daughter of the Duke and Duchess of York. Her father was the only surviving son of the Prince and Princess of Wales, while her mother was the eldest child and only daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Teck. She was named Victoria Alexandra Alice Mary, after her paternal great-grandmother Queen Victoria; her paternal grandmother, Alexandra, Princess of Wales; her maternal grandmother, Mary Adelaide, Duchess of Teck; and her great-aunt, Alice, Grand Duchess of Hesse and by Rhine, with whom she shared a birthday. She was known by the last of her Christian names, Mary. She was fifth in the line of succession at the time of her birth, preceded by her grandfather, father, and elder brothers Edward and Albert, though would later move down the line after the births of her younger brothers Henry, George, and John.

She was baptised at St Mary Magdalene&#x27;s Church near Sandringham on 7 June 1897 by William Dalrymple Maclagan, Archbishop of York. Her godparents were: the Queen (her great-grandmother); the King of the Hellenes (her paternal great-uncle); the Dowager Empress of Russia (her paternal great-aunt); the Prince and Princess of Wales (her paternal grandparents); the Duchess of Teck (her maternal grandmother); Princess Victoria of Wales (her paternal aunt); and Prince Francis of Teck (her maternal uncle). Her grandfather ascended the throne in 1901 when Mary was three years old.

Princess Mary was educated by governesses, but shared some lessons with her brothers, Edward, Albert, and Henry. She became fluent in German and French, and developed a lifelong interest in horses and horse racing. Her first state appearance was at the coronation of her parents, King George V and Queen Mary at Westminster Abbey on 22 June 1911.

==Charity work==

During World War I, Princess Mary visited hospitals and welfare organisations with her mother; assisting with projects to give comfort to British servicemen and assistance to their families. One of these projects was Princess Mary&#x27;s Christmas Gift Fund, through which a total of £100,000 worth of gifts was sent to serving British soldiers and sailors for Christmas, 1914, (the equivalent of £ in when adjusted for inflation).
She took an active role in promoting the Girl Guide movement, the VADs, and the Land Girls. In June 1918, following an announcement in &quot;The Gentlewoman&quot;, she began a nursing course at Great Ormond Street Hospital, working two days a week in the Alexandra Ward.

On 20 November 1918, Princess Mary became the first member of the royal family to visit France following the Armistice. She visited centres associated with Queen Alexandra&#x27;s Imperial Military Nursing Service or Voluntary Aid Detachment Units, and hospitals with wounded soldiers.

Princess Mary&#x27;s public duties reflected her concerns with nursing, the Girl Guide movement, and the Women&#x27;s Services.
In the period leading up to her marriage, girls and women in the British Empire named Mary or its variants (including Marie, May and Miriam) banded together to form &quot;The Marys of the Empire,&quot; and donated money toward a wedding present. She presented this fund to the Girl Guides Association for the purchase of the estate of Foxlease, and following the exhibition of her wedding presents, she also contributed half the proceeds to the same cause, for upkeep, a total of £10,000, which enabled the project to go ahead.

She became honorary president of the British Girl Guide Association in 1920, a position she held until her death. She received the Silver Fish Award, Girl Guiding&#x27;s highest adult honour, in recognition of her contribution to the movement. It was reported in July 2013 that British Pathé had discovered newsreel film from 1927 in which the ancestors of Catherine Middleton are, as Lord Mayors of Leeds, playing host to Princess Mary at the Young Women&#x27;s Christian Association in Hunslet, Leeds; both Sir Charles Lupton and his brother Hugh Lupton, were the uncles of Olive Middleton, the Princess of Wales&#x27;s great-grandmother. In 1921, the Princess became the first patron of the Not Forgotten Association, a position she held until her death in 1965. The charity&#x27;s first Christmas Tea Party was organised by Mary and held at St James&#x27;s Palace in 1921 when she invited 600 wounded servicemen for afternoon tea and the event has been held annually ever since. In 1926, Princess Mary became the commandant-in-chief of the British Red Cross Detachments.

In the 1920s, she was a patron of the Leeds Triennial Musical Festival. By the 1940s, Princess Mary was attending the opening nights and many of the festival&#x27;s performances, as was her son, George, and his wife, the Countess of Harewood, née Marion Stein, a former concert pianist. George was a noted music critic whose career included the role of artistic director of the Leeds Triennial Musical Festival.

In 1931, she was appointed patron of the Yorkshire Ladies Council of Education. She was also patron of the Girls&#x27; Patriotic Union of Day Schools.

It was reported in July 1927 that at a garden party at the Headingley Cricket Ground, the Princess was served tea alongside dignitaries who included members of the Middleton family; Olive Middleton, great-grandmother of Catherine, Princess of Wales, was one of them. The Princess and her son, George Lascelles, 7th Earl of Harewood, were patrons of the Yorkshire Symphony Orchestra which had played at soirées at their home, Harewood House. Attending these concerts was the orchestra&#x27;s co-founder, Richard Noël Middleton, who was on friendly terms with the Princess. Middleton&#x27;s wife, Olive, was a member of the Princess&#x27;s fundraising committee for the Leeds General Infirmary. Olive&#x27;s first cousin was fellow committee member Elinor G. Lupton who reportedly launched the fund-raising appeal in 1933. The committee&#x27;s vice-presidents included the Princess&#x27;s sister-in-law, the Hon. Mrs Edward Lascelles, who served alongside Olive Middleton and her relative, Jessie Beatrice Kitson. Princess Mary became patron of the Leeds Infirmary in 1936.

==Marriage and family==
On 28 February 1922, Princess Mary married Viscount Lascelles, the elder son of the 5th Earl of Harewood and his wife, Lady Florence Bridgeman, daughter of the 3rd Earl of Bradford of Weston Park. The bride was 24 years old, while the groom was 39.

Their wedding was held at Westminster Abbey, and attracted large crowds along the route to Buckingham Palace. The ceremony was the first royal wedding to be covered in fashion magazines, including &quot;Vogue&quot;. The bride&#x27;s gown was designed by Messrs Raville and featured emblems of Britain and India. It was the first royal occasion in which Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, a friend of Princess Mary, participated, as one of the bridesmaids. She later married Mary&#x27;s brother, Prince Albert, and became queen consort of the United Kingdom upon his accession in 1936.

Princess Mary and Lord Lascelles had two sons:
* George Lascelles, 7th Earl of Harewood (7 February 1923 – 11 July 2011); married, 1949, Marion Stein; had issue; divorced 1967; married, 1967, Patricia Elizabeth Tuckwell; had issue.
* The Honourable Gerald Lascelles (21 August 1924 – 27 February 1998); married, 1952, Angela Dowding; had issue; divorced 1978; married Elizabeth Collingwood; had issue.

===Family homes and interests===
The Princess and her husband had homes in London (Chesterfield House, Westminster) and in Yorkshire (first Goldsborough Hall, and later Harewood House). While at Goldsborough Hall, Princess Mary had internal alterations made by the architect Sydney Kitson, to suit the upbringing of her two children and instigated the development of formal planting of beech-hedge-lined long borders from the south terrace looking for a quarter of a mile down an avenue of lime trees. The limes were planted by her relatives as they visited the Hall throughout the 1920s, including her father, King George, and mother, Queen Mary.

After becoming the Countess of Harewood upon the death of her father-in-law, Princess Mary moved to Harewood House, and took a keen interest in the interior decoration and renovation of the Lascelles family seat. In farming pursuits, Princess Mary also became an expert in cattle breeding and was on the board of trustees of the Royal Agricultural Society of England of which her husband had been president. In December 2012, some of the Princess&#x27;s belongings were sold in &quot;Harewood: Collecting in the Royal Tradition&quot;, an auction organised by Christie&#x27;s. 

In the first half of the 20th century, she occasionally rode with the Bramham Moor Hunt – Lord Harewood was Master of the Hunt – and entertained many horse-racing enthusiasts at Harewood house parties for the race events at Wetherby and York.

==Princess Royal==
On 6 October 1929, Lord Lascelles, who had been created a Knight of the Garter upon his marriage, succeeded his father as 6th Earl of Harewood, Viscount Lascelles, and Baron Harewood. On 1 January 1932, George V declared that his only daughter should bear the title Princess Royal, succeeding her aunt Princess Louise, Duchess of Fife, who had died a year earlier.

The Princess Royal was particularly close to her eldest brother, the Prince of Wales, known as David to his close family, who subsequently became Edward VIII upon the death of their father in 1936. After the abdication crisis, she and her husband went to stay with the former Edward VIII, by then created Duke of Windsor, at Enzesfeld Castle near Vienna. Later, in November 1947, she allegedly declined to attend the wedding of her niece, Princess Elizabeth, to Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten as the Duke of Windsor had not been invited. She gave ill health as the official reason for her non-attendance. In March 1953, she cut short her tour of the West Indies and before returning to London, made a surprise diversion to New York, where she met with the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. She posed for photographs with them before she and the duke boarded the ship they travelled on to visit their ailing mother, Queen Mary.

At the outbreak of World War II, the Princess Royal became chief controller and later controller commandant of the Auxiliary Territorial Service, renamed the Women&#x27;s Royal Army Corps in 1949. In that capacity, she travelled across the country, visiting its units, as well as wartime canteens and other welfare organisations. After the death in 1942 of her younger brother, the Duke of Kent, she became the president of Papworth Hospital. The Princess Royal became air chief commandant of Princess Mary&#x27;s Royal Air Force Nursing Service in 1950, and received the honorary rank of general in the British Army in 1956. Also, in 1949, the 10th Gurkha Rifles were renamed the 10th Princess Mary&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles in her honour.

After her husband&#x27;s death in 1947, the Princess Royal lived at Harewood House with her elder son and his family. She became the chancellor of the University of Leeds in 1951, and continued to carry out official duties at home and abroad. She attended the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in June 1953, and later represented the Queen at the independence celebrations of Trinidad and Tobago in 1962, and Zambia in 1964. One of her last official engagements was to represent the Queen at the funeral of Queen Louise of Sweden in early March 1965. The Princess Royal visited her brother, the Duke of Windsor, at the London Clinic in March 1965, while he recovered from recent eye surgery. The Princess also met his wife, the Duchess of Windsor, one of the Duchess&#x27;s few meetings with her husband&#x27;s immediate family to take place.

==Death and legacy==
On 28 March 1965, the Princess Royal had a fatal heart attack during a walk with her elder son, Lord Harewood, and his children in the grounds of the Harewood House estate. Mary was 67 years old. She was buried next to her husband in the Lascelles family vault at All Saints&#x27; Church, Harewood, after a private family funeral at York Minster. A memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey, London. Her will was sealed in London after her death with her estate valued at £347,626 (or, £ in when adjusted for inflation).

Six British monarchs reigned during Princess Mary&#x27;s lifetime: Victoria (her great-grandmother), Edward VII (her grandfather), George V (her father), Edward VIII and George VI (her brothers), and Elizabeth II (her niece). She is typically remembered as an uncontroversial figure of the royal family. The Princess was portrayed by Kate Phillips in &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; (2019).

During the British Mandate of Palestine, a major street in Jerusalem next to the Old City was called Princess Mary Street. After the creation of Israel, the street name was changed to Queen Shlomzion Street, to commemorate the Jewish queen.

==Titles, styles, honours and arms==
===Titles and styles===
Mary was known as &quot;Princess Mary of York&quot; at birth. Mary was not styled &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot; from birth, only gaining that style in 1898 by letters patent granted by her great-grandmother, Queen Victoria. After Victoria&#x27;s death in January 1901, Mary was known as Princess Mary of Cornwall and York, until her father&#x27;s creation as Prince of Wales in November of that year, when she assumed the title &quot;Princess Mary of Wales&quot;.

Upon her father&#x27;s accession as George V in 1910, Mary assumed the style of &quot;Her Royal Highness The Princess Mary&quot;. In 1922, Mary married Viscount Lascelles and began using the title &quot;Her Royal Highness The Princess Mary, Viscountess Lascelles&quot;. When her husband succeeded as Earl of Harewood in 1929, Mary became known as &quot;Her Royal Highness The Princess Mary, Countess of Harewood&quot;. In 1932, her father gave her the title Princess Royal, which had previously belonged to her aunt Louise until her death the year prior. For the rest of her life, Mary was known as &quot;Her Royal Highness The Princess Royal&quot;.

<doc id="181258" wikidata="Q691928" url="?curid=181258" title="Chakri dynasty">
<text>The Chakri dynasty is the current reigning dynasty of the Kingdom of Thailand. The head of the house is the king, who is head of state. The family has ruled Thailand since the founding of the Rattanakosin era and the city of Bangkok in 1782; following the end of Taksin&#x27;s reign, when the capital of Siam shifted to Bangkok. The royal house was founded by Rama I, an Ayutthaya military leader of Sino-Mon descent.

Prior to his accession to the throne, Rama I held for years the title [[Chakri (noble title)|Chakri]], the civil chancellor. In founding the dynasty, the king himself chose &quot;Chakri&quot; as the name for it. The emblem of the house is composed of the discus (Chakra) and the trident (Trishula), the celestial weapons of the gods Vishnu and Shiva, of whom the Thai sovereign is seen as an incarnation.

The current head of the house is Vajiralongkorn who was proclaimed king on 1 December 2016, but has reigned with retroactive effect since 13 October 2016 after the death of his father Bhumibol Adulyadej. The house&#x27;s current seat is the Grand Palace. On Saturday, 4 May 2019, the coronation of Vajiralongkorn, with the traditional ceremony, occurred in Bangkok.

== Royal family ==
The present royal family of Thailand belongs to the House of Mahidol (; ), a cadet branch of the Chakri dynasty. The House was founded by Prince Mahidol Adulyadej (1891–1929) and Princess Srinagarindra (1900–1995). The Prince was a son of King Chulalongkorn and his wife Queen Savang Vadhana. The Prince was also the half-brother of both King Vajiravudh and King Prajadhipok. After the death of King Ananda Mahidol (Prince Mahidol&#x27;s elder son), King Bhumibol Adulyadej (the Prince&#x27;s younger son) ascended the throne in 1946. In 1949 the King married his first cousin once removed, Mom Rajawongse Sirikit Kitiyakara (a daughter of Mom Chao Nakkhatra Mangala Kitiyakara, a grandson of King Chulalongkorn). Bhumibol was succeeded by his son Vajiralongkorn officially on 13 October 2016, but was proclaimed King on 1 December 2016.

==History==

===Monarchs===
====Timeline====


===Front Palaces===

The Maha Uparat (มหาอุปราช) or the Krom Phrarajawang Boworn Sathan Mongkol (Vice or Second King of Siam/Viceroy of Siam) (กรมพระราชวังบวรสถานมงคล) was an office that was bestowed on the highest ranking prince, frequently the monarch&#x27;s younger brother or son. Until 1885 every Chakri monarch had appointed a prince to this office. The &quot;Uprarat&quot; and his miniature court would reside at the Front Palace (วังหน้า) (a palace complex to the north of the Grand Palace, now the site of the Bangkok National Museum). By tradition the Uparat was designated the heir to the throne, however only Prince Itsarasunthon was able to ascend the throne as King Phutthaloetla Naphalai. The office was extremely prestigious and carried with it almost equal status to the king, this can be seen in Prince Chutamani (younger brother of King Mongkut), who was elevated to Vice King Pinklao in 1851 (he carried with him the styles and titles of a King). The office was abolished by King Chulalongkorn when his Uparat and cousin Prince Wichaichan died. He then declared his oldest son the crown prince of Siam, but not Uparat.

===Rear Palace===
Krom Phrarajawang Boworn Sathan Phimuk (กรมพระราชวังบวรสถานพิมุข), or the Rear Palace, was another office inherited from the Kingdom of Ayutthaya. However, since the founding of the dynasty there has only been one rear palace. Prince Anurak Devesh was the nephew of King Phutthayotfa Chualok (his mother Princess Thepsuthavadi was the king&#x27;s elder sister) and was appointed to the office in 1785.

===Crown Princes===

The Crown Prince of Thailand or Sayam Makutrajakuman (สยามมกุฎราชกุมาร) is the designated and heir apparent to the throne and headship of the dynasty. The title was created in 1886 when King Chulalongkorn appointed his eldest son by Princess Consort Savang Vadhana, Prince Vajirunhis as Sayam Makutrajakuman. The title was copied directly from the Western tradition. Since then, there have only been three crown princes. The most recent crown prince, Maha Vajiralongkorn, was invested with the title in 1972 and became King in 2016. The succession is governed by the 1924 Palace Law of Succession passed by King Vajiravudh.

<text>Apollo/Domain is a series of workstations that were developed and produced by Apollo Computer from to 1989. The machines were built around the Motorola 68k series of processors, except for the DN10000, which has from one to four of Apollo&#x27;s RISC processors, named PRISM.

==Operating system==
The original operating system is Apollo&#x27;s own product called Aegis, which was later renamed to Domain/OS. The Aegis and Domain/OS system offers advanced features for the time, for example an object oriented filesystem, network transparency, diskless booting, a graphical user interface, and, in Domain/OS, interoperability with BSD, System V, and POSIX.

==Hardware==
An Apollo workstation resembles a modern PC, with a base unit, keyboard, mouse, and screen. Early models are housed in short (about 2 ft high) 19&quot; rack cabinets to be set beside a desk or under a table. The DN300 and later DN330 were designed as integrated units with the system and monitor in one unit. These models fit easily on a desk.

Every Apollo system (even standalone) includes at least one network interface. The only original option is the 12 Mbit/s Apollo Token Ring (ATR), and then 10 Mbit/s Ethernet was added as an option. It has been stated that the IBM Token Ring was an option but this was never available. The ATR is generally the best choice, because it is extremely scalable; the Ethernet of the time has serious performance loss as extra machines are added to the network, but this is not true of ATR, which can easily have over 100 machines on one network. One drawback is that, unlike Ethernet, one machine failure (which could easily happen with a single faulty connector) stops the entire network. For this reason, Apollo provided an optional, but strongly recommended, network cabling system of bypass switches and quick connect boxes which allow machines to be disconnected and moved without problems. Apollo Token Ring networks use 75 ohm RG-6U coaxial cabling.

==Networking==
The network orientation of the systems, together with the ATR functionality, enables easy and practicable booting to diskless machines using another machine&#x27;s OS. In principle, as many machines can be booted from one host as it can cope with; in practice, four diskless machines from one host is about the limit. Provided the correct machine-specific software is installed on the host (again, very easy), any type of machine could be booted from any other. One complication is that a DN10000 can only be booted from another DN10000 or a 68K-based system which has &quot;cmpexe&quot; compound executables installed.

Some systems can have the graphics card removed for use as servers and the keyboard and mouse are automatically ignored, and the system is accessed either across the network, or via a dumb terminal plugged into the machine&#x27;s serial port. Such a system is designated &quot;DSP&quot; instead of &quot;DN&quot;.

==Models==
The model naming convention is DN (for Domain Node) with a model number. If the system has no display, it is a DSP (for Domain Service Processor).

The first model is the DN416 workstation, later referred to as the DN100 after the green screen was substituted with a black and white screen. This system uses two 68000 processors and implements virtual memory (which the 68000 is not theoretically capable of) by stopping one processor when there is a page fault and having the other processor handle the fault, then release the primary processor when the page fault was handled.

Later models have 68010, 68020, 68030, and 68040 processors which have native support for virtual memory. Some workstations have bit-slice CPU implementations that are instruction set compatible with the 68000.

The DSP90 is a fileserver built using a standard Multibus backplane and I/O controllers. The disk controller supports up to four 500MB hard drives. A 9-track tape controller was released.

Early performance models are the DN560 and DN660 which are housed in desk-side cabinets. These can have color graphics cards with graphics accelerators.
The DN300 and later DN330 are integrated desktop systems not much bigger than the included monitor.

In the late 1980s, Apollo introduced a new pair of machines, the DN3000 and DN4000 with 68020 processors, but are housed in IBM PC style cases of the time with IBM-AT compatible ISA expansion slots and PC-compatible disk drives. These became the mainstay of the Apollo range in the mid to late 1980s. In principle, a user or third party can install a standard AT expansion card, but since this requires writing a special device driver, in practice this is very rare. However, the size and design of the boxes make installing or replacing components very easy. A typical system can have between 2 MiB and 32 MiB of memory, a 76 MB, 150 MB or 330 MB (very occasionally 660 MB) hard disk, and 32-bit 68020 or 68030 processor running at 12 MHz to 33 MHz, depending on model. A half-height expansion bay could take either a 5¼-inch floppy disk drive or a QIC-type cartridge tape drive, capacity 30 MB, 45 MB, or 60 MB depending on cartridge. For printer access, the system came with a serial port as standard; a serial/parallel expansion card can provide a parallel printer port.

The DN3000 and DN4000 were later upgraded to DN3500 and DN4500 with a faster 68030 CPU. The DN3500 is approximately as powerful as the DN4000. A DN5500 with a 68040 was also produced in limited quantities.

The DN10000 series used Apollo PRISM processors.

Soon after HP acquired Apollo, the base DN2500 workstation was released at , advertised as &quot;4 Mips, 4 MB of memory, for under $4,000&quot;. It features a single integrated motherboard using PC standard DRAM single in-line memory modules, as a significant departure from previous models from the competition still using custom memory modules. The motherboard incorporates a SCSI disk controller for an optional hard disk drive and a single AT expansion slot dedicated for the use of a network card to allow the system to attach to any of the three supported networks: Apollo Token Ring, IBM Token Ring, or Ethernet. Monochrome displays of up to are supported, and the base configuration has a display. Based on the 68030 with 68882 floating-point unit running at 20 MHz, with 4 to 16 MB of RAM, the machine&#x27;s list price of just under reportedly represented &quot;a major change in the price/performance ratio&quot; for workstations. Educational institutions could purchase the base configuration starting at .

A merged line of workstations that runs either Domain/OS or HP-UX, was produced with the name HP/Apollo 425t and HP/Apollo 433s. The 425t is a &quot;pizza box&quot; design with a single network expansion slot. The 433s is a desk-side server systems with multiple expansion slots.

==Compatibility==
PC compatibility is possible either through software emulation, using the optional product DPCE, or through a plug-in card carrying an Intel 80286 processor. A third-party plug-in card with a 386 was produced.

An Apollo Token Ring network card can be placed in a standard PC and network drivers connect it to a PC SMB (Server Message Block) file server.

==Usage==
Apollo systems are easy to use and administer, but they became less cost-effective because the proprietary operating system made software more expensive than Unix software. The 68K processors are slower than the new RISC chips from Sun and Hewlett-Packard. Apollo addressed both problems by introducing the RISC-based DN10000 and Unix-friendly Domain/OS operating system. However, the DN10000, though fast, was extremely expensive, and a reliable version of Domain/OS came too late to make a difference. The increased speed and falling price of PCs ensured the obsolescence of high end systems such as Apollo workstations.

===ARM CPU design===
When Acorn Computers began designing the ARM 1 CPU in 1984, it used a single Apollo DN 600 workstation to do VLSI design with engineers taking shifts to use the machine. Later in the project they acquired additional workstations.

==Acquisition==
In 1989, Hewlett-Packard acquired Apollo. They later released the DN2500 series workstation, a cheap alternative to the DN3x00/4x00 series, and then the HP 9000 Series 400 line, which can run either HP&#x27;s own version of Unix, HP-UX, or Domain/OS. In this case, the choice had to be made at time of purchase, partly because HP-UX and Domain/OS functionality required different keyboards and mice. The Domain/OS variants also include a Token Ring card not provided for the HP-UX variants.

<doc id="181262" wikidata="Q7605948" url="?curid=181262" title="Steer roping">
<text>Steer roping, also known as steer tripping or steer jerking, is a rodeo event that features a steer and one mounted cowboy.

==Technique==
The steer roper starts behind a &quot;barrier&quot; - a taut rope fastened with an easily broken string which is fastened lightly to the steer. When the roper calls for the steer, the chute man trips a lever, opening the doors. The steer breaks out running. When the steer reaches the end of the tether, the string breaks, releasing the barrier for the horse and roper. Should the roper break the barrier, a 10-second penalty is added to his time. The roper must throw his rope in a loop around the steer&#x27;s horns.

Once the rope is around the steer&#x27;s horns, a right-handed roper throws the slack of the rope over the steer&#x27;s right hip and then turns his horse to the left; when the rope comes tight, it pulls on the steer&#x27;s hip up and turns the steer&#x27;s head around, tripping or unbalancing the steer so that it falls. The roper dismounts while his horse continues to gallop, pulling the steer along the ground, which prevents the animal from getting back to its feet. The horse is trained to slow once the rider is completely off the horse and has reached the steer, but to keep the rope taunt while the contestant ties three of the steer&#x27;s legs together with a &quot;piggin string&quot; using a half hitch knot colloquially called a &quot;hooey&quot;.

The roper returns to his horse, mounts, and moves the horse forward, releasing the tension on the rope. An official will then time six seconds. If the steer is still tied at the end of the six seconds, an official time for the event is awarded.

Team roping is an unrelated event using two riders to rope a steer, one which ropes the head, the other the heels, immobilizing the animal between them. Calf roping or tie-down roping is an event, using a weanling calf that the roper manually throws to the ground after roping and then ties. A related event using calves is breakaway roping, where the calf is roped but not tied.

==Professional steer roping==
Professional steer roping occurs at the highest level in the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA). At the end of each season, there is a finals event called the National Finals Steer Roping (NFSR) which takes place in early November at the Kansas Star Arena in Mulvane, Kansas. Other PRCA events take place in early December at the National Finals Rodeo (NFR) at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nevada.

==Animal welfare==
Steer roping is considered controversial due to concerns about animal welfare. Within the United States it has been illegal in Rhode Island since 2001.

Steer roping is recognized by the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA), but downplayed, mentioned only in passing at the official PRCA website. It is only held at some rodeos, currently about 60 per year, the annual championship competition is held separately from other championship events, and steer roping is not included as part of the widely televised National Finals Rodeo.

<doc id="181264" wikidata="Q880945" url="?curid=181264" title="Blackthorne">
<text>Blackthorne (released as Blackhawk in some European countries) is a cinematic platform game developed by Blizzard Entertainment. It was released for the Super NES and MS-DOS in 1994. The cover art for the SNES version was drawn by Jim Lee. The following year, &quot;Blackthorne&quot; was released for the Sega 32X with additional content. In 2013, Blizzard released the game for free on their Battle.net PC client. In celebration of the company&#x27;s 30th anniversary, &quot;Blackthorne&quot; was re-released for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows and Xbox One as part of the &quot;Blizzard Arcade Collection&quot; in February 2021.

==Plot==
&quot;Blackthorne&quot; is set on the planet Tuul, which has existed for centuries without human knowledge. All of this time, Tuul&#x27;s people have been ruled over by a single shaman who &quot;was blessed with all knowledge&quot;. Years before the game begins, Thoros, the latest ruler, finds it near impossible to choose between his two sons as the next ruler. Believing it will solve the dilemma, he leads them to the deserts and kills himself. His body becomes two stones, light and dark, and he gives one to each boy to rule their own kingdoms respectively. The people of the lightstone form the kingdom of Androth, and the people of the darkstone form Ka&#x27;dra&#x27;suul. But while Androth respects their stone, Ka&#x27;dra&#x27;suul reject theirs, and are eventually transformed into monsters by it. In this time, a ka&#x27;dra named Sarlac seizes power. He forms an army and leads them against Androth. Knowing of his people&#x27;s doom, the ruler of Androth, King Vlaros, with the aid of the Androthi magician Galadril, sends his son Kyle to Earth to save his life. Vlaros also gives Kyle the lightstone for safe keeping.

Twenty years later, Kyle has become a renowned military captain and mercenary. After breaking out of prison facing court martial, Kyle begins having strange dreams, and is eventually confronted by Galadril. He is told that it is time to return to Tuul and save his people. The game begins here with Kyle setting out to kill Sarlac and reclaim his throne.

Kyle ventures through the land fighting his way to Sarlac&#x27;s castle. He confronts Sarlac and threatens to keep his skull as a mounted trophy on his wall. The two battle and Kyle is the victor. He avenges his father, King Vlaros. Kyle then becomes king of Androth, where it is stated that he ruled justly, fairly and with honor for many years. The final shot of the game shows him sitting on the throne with a woman sitting next to him. Sarlac&#x27;s skull is seen mounted on the wall as a trophy, just as Kyle had promised.

==Gameplay==
The game focuses around protagonist Kyle &quot;Blackthorne&quot; Vlaros, out for revenge on Sarlac and his minions. The gameplay involves large platforming sequences, in which Kyle can run and climb around the environment, find keys and items and progress to the end of each maze-like level. Combat in &quot;Blackthorne&quot; takes the form of gunfights. Both Blackthorne and his enemies can press against walls to avoid incoming bullets. Blackthorne can also fire blindly behind himself. During the game, Kyle uses a pump-action shotgun as his primary weapon. As the game progresses, Androthi allies will help him upgrade the weapon, increasing its speed and power.

The game has seventeen levels within four areas—the mines of Androth, the Karrellian forests/swamps, the Wasteland desert and Shadow keep. The Sega 32X version includes a fifth area, the snowy mountains, which is not found in the other versions of the game. As the game progresses through these areas, Kyle becomes stronger and better armed, but so do the enemies.

==Development==
The inspiration for &quot;Blackthorne&quot; came from &quot;Another World&quot; and &quot;Flashback.&quot; For the first versions, the sprites for game characters were done using rotoscoping techniques just like &quot;Prince of Persia&quot;, using over 1000 frames to get smooth, lifelike animation. The Macintosh version improved the quality by using prerendered, motion-captured sprites. Interplay had intended to port the game to Sega Genesis but instead did so for the Sega 32X. There were also plans to port the game to PlayStation and Sega Saturn, but those plans were cancelled. A 3DO version was showcased by Interplay at E3 1995, but the port was never released for unknown reasons.

The protagonist&#x27;s name Kyle was inspired by Kyle Reese from the 1984 film &quot;The Terminator.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; gave the SNES version their &quot;Game of the Month&quot; award, praising its dark tone, amazingly smooth animation, complex and intelligent gameplay, and the ability to kill prisoners after getting information from them. &quot;GamePro&quot; gave the SNES version a positive review, calling it &quot;&quot;Flashback&quot; with an attitude&quot;. They particularly praised its detailed graphics and stronger emphasis on action over puzzle-solving as compared to similar games. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; praised the game as &quot;Total fun!&quot; noting its animation and sound quality and stated that it had better play control than games like &quot;Out of This World&quot;, &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; and &quot;Flashback&quot; but was &quot;still a bit slow&quot;.

They gave the 32X version a positive review as well, remarking that &quot;with a solid graphical overhaul, &quot;Blackthorne&quot; delivers where many of the 16-bit conversions flounder in the 32X library&quot;.

A reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot; called &quot;Blackthorne&quot; &quot;one of the best arcade-style games the [PC] has ever seen&quot;, citing the accessible and intelligent gameplay, smooth animation, and the &quot;dark feel of the game&quot;. While noting that the game was over two years old by the time it was released for Macintosh, &quot;Next Generation&quot; gave this version a positive review as well, concluding that &quot;at the very least, &quot;Blackthorne&quot; is one of the best—and only—action games to come out for the Macintosh in the last year&quot;.

&quot;IGN&quot; rated the game 90th on their &quot;Top 100 SNES Games of All Time&quot;. In 2018, &quot;Complex&quot; placed &quot;Blackthorne&quot; at 96th in their &quot;The Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time&quot;. In 1995, &quot;Total!&quot; ranked the game 49 on its Top 100 SNES Games, writing: &quot;It&#x27;s a bit like &quot;Flashback&quot;, only it&#x27;s more action based. This lack of puzzling elements makes it slightly less intriguing, but it delivers a whole heap of atmosphere.&quot;

<text>Steinfurt () is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the northern part of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Neighboring districts are Bentheim, Emsland, district-free Osnabrück and the Osnabrück district, Warendorf, district-free Münster, Coesfeld, Borken.

==Geography==
The district is situated at the Lower Saxon border, north of Münster. The Ems river runs through the district from south to north. The highest point in the region is the Westerbecker Berg at 234 metres above sea level; the lowest point is Bentlage Castle at 32 metres.

==History==
In the middle ages and early modern period, Steinfurt was an independent county of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1806, it became part of the Grand Duchy of Berg and in 1815 it became part of the Kingdom of Prussia.

In 1975, the old district Steinfurt was merged with the district Tecklenburg, and together with Greven and Saerbeck from the former district Münster the current district was formed.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms combines elements from the coats of arms of the former districts of Steinfurt, Tecklenburg and Münster. The swan in the middle comes from the countship of Steinfurt, the centre of the district. The red bar around the swan symbolizes the clerical state of Münster, which lay around the dukedom of Steinfurt. The red water lily leaves were symbols of the dukes of Tecklenburg.

==Towns and municipalities==


==Town Twinning==
Steinfurt is twinned with:

<doc id="181270" wikidata="Q3028602" url="?curid=181270" title="Diocese of Møre">
<text>The Diocese of Møre () is a diocese in the Church of Norway which geographically consists of Møre og Romsdal county, Norway. Its bishop is seated at the Molde Cathedral which is located in the county administrative center of Molde. , the Bishop of Møre is Ingeborg Midttømme.

The diocese was established on 18 September 1983, when the district of Sunnmøre was removed from the Diocese of Bjørgvin to the south, and the Romsdal and Nordmøre districts were removed from the Diocese of Nidaros to the north. The three districts (which correspond to Møre og Romsdal county) were used to form the new diocese.

==Structure==
The Diocese of Møre is divided into six deaneries (). Each one corresponds to several municipalities in the diocese. Each municipality is further divided into one or more parishes which each contain one or more congregations. See each municipality below for lists of churches and parishes within them.

==Bishops==
The following people have led the diocese as bishop since the founding of the diocese:
* Since 2008: Ingeborg Midttømme
* 1991–2008: Odd Bondevik
* 1983–1991: Ole Nordhaug

==Name==
The name of the diocese (&quot;Møre&quot;) is the result of a compromise between county&#x27;s three districts. Sunnmøre, with almost half of the population, would accept that the bishop be located in the geographical center of the diocese—Molde in Romsdal—if that region&#x27;s name (Romsdal) be excluded from the name of the diocese.

The name of the corresponding county was &quot;Møre fylke&quot; during the period from 1919–1935, and &quot;Romsdal amt&quot; from 1660–1919. However, the name is old (Old Norse: &quot;Mœrr&quot;), and it is probably derived from the word &quot;marr&quot; which means &quot;ocean&quot; or &quot;sea&quot;. The meaning is then &quot;coastal district&quot;. (A coastal district in Sweden has the same name: Möre.)

The ambiguous designation &quot;møring&quot;—&quot;person from Møre&quot;—is used strictly about people from Nordmøre (and less frequently for people from Sunnmøre), excluding the people from Romsdal (while, consequently, &quot;romsdaling&quot;—&quot;person from Romsdal&quot;— is used about the latter).

<doc id="181274" wikidata="Q49022" url="?curid=181274" title="The Young Ones (TV series)">
<text>The Young Ones is a British sitcom written by Rik Mayall, Ben Elton, and Lise Mayer, starring Adrian Edmondson, Mayall, Nigel Planer, Christopher Ryan, and Alexei Sayle, and broadcast on BBC2 for two series, first shown in 1982 and 1984. The show focused on the lives of four dissimilar students and their landlord&#x27;s family on different plots that often included anarchic, offbeat, surreal humour. The show often included slapstick gags, visual humour and surreal jokes sometimes acted out by puppets, with each episode also featuring a notable selection of guest stars and musical numbers from various performers.

&quot;The Young Ones&quot; helped bring alternative comedy to British television in the 1980s and made household names of its writers and performers. The show became a notable icon of 1980s British popular culture, and it received its own game and a home-media release while becoming the first non-music-related programme to appear on MTV in the United States in 1985. The show was voted number 31 in the BBC&#x27;s Best Sitcom poll in 2004.

==History==

In the early 1980s, much of the programme&#x27;s cast performed on London&#x27;s comedy club circuit, gaining significant popularity at The Comedy Store—Alexei Sayle was the prominent act, drawing attention as the manic, aggressive compere; Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall worked together in the troupe 20th Century Coyote and later became the double act The Dangerous Brothers; and Nigel Planer worked in the double act &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; alongside Peter Richardson. All principal members later opted to make their own club as The Comedy Store became popular, and they formed The Comic Strip in the Raymond Revuebar club in Soho with French and Saunders and Arnold Brown. The new club proved immensely popular amongst London&#x27;s comedy venues and brought the group to the attention of Jeremy Isaacs, head of the new Channel 4.

Richardson opted to bring the group to television in a project entitled &quot;The Comic Strip Presents...&quot; and began negotiations with the new channel to secure a deal for a series of six self-contained half-hour films, in which the group would perform as comedy actors rather than stand-up performers. Channel 4 agreed to the deal and aired the programme on the channel&#x27;s opening night on 2 November 1982. In response to this, the BBC opted to recruit the group for their own comedy projects, and they began negotiations with Edmondson, Mayall, Richardson, Planer and Sayle to star in a sitcom that would operate on a similar broadcast arrangement, under the title of &quot;The Young Ones&quot;, which alludes to and subverts the song of the same name, written by Sid Tepper and Roy C. Bennett and performed by Cliff Richard and The Shadows, which had become a No. 1 UK hit single in 1962. The group agreed to join the project and work proceeded on the sitcom, with Mayall co-writing the scripts with his then girlfriend Lise Mayer, and Ben Elton (who had attended the University of Manchester with Mayall and Edmondson). Paul Jackson was installed as a producer, but his presence led to him clashing with Richardson, forcing the latter to abandon the project. As a result, his replacement was Christopher Ryan, the only member of the group who was not a stand-up comedian. According to Jackson, the finished project was met with complete disbelief by the BBC, but the recent arrival of Channel 4 led the broadcaster to air what had been created a week after its opening night, on 9 November.

To help make it stand out, the group opted to combine traditional sitcom style with violent slapstick, non-sequitur plot turns, and surrealism. These older styles were mixed with the working and lower-middle class attitudes of the growing 1980s alternative comedy boom, in which all the principal performers except Ryan had been involved. In addition, it was also decided that every episode, with the exception of one, would feature a live performance by a band, including Madness, Motörhead, and The Damned. This was a device used to qualify the series for a larger budget, as variety shows attracted higher fees than comedy at the time. Episodes were generally produced to be over 35 minutes long, though were edited to half-hour when later repeated on the BBC or satellite channels.

==Premise==
The programme focuses on the lives of four undergraduate students who share a house in squalid condition (with the fictitious address of 15 Credibility Street), while attending their studies at the fictional Scumbag College, London.

The content of the episodes could be classified as a comedy of manners, because of its take on British culture, political climate and social backgrounds during the 1980s. A particular example of this is the second series&#x27; use of &quot;flash frames&quot;, in each episode, to mock the public&#x27;s fear of subliminal messages in television and music. &quot;The Young Ones&quot; was more notable for its use of violent slapstick, which Edmondson and Mayall had been using in their double-act routines, the use of surreal elements such as puppets playing the role of talking animals or objects (in a similar manner to &quot;The Goodies&quot;), use of lengthy cutaways with no relation to the episode&#x27;s plot, and frequent breaches of the fourth wall for comedic efforts, either to break a punchline to a joke or make a plot point obvious; in several occasions, Sayle used this element to break from his character and address the audience in his real-life Liverpudlian accent.

Rik Mayall once jokingly said that the household was effectively a nuclear family, with Mike as the father, Neil as the mother, Vyvyan as the rebellious son, and Rick (with a pig-tail) as the daughter.

===Cast===

&quot;The Young Ones&quot; had a regular cast of five:
* Adrian Edmondson as Vyvyan &quot;Vyv&quot; Basterd, a heavy metal fan and medical student; psychopathic, sociopathic, sadistic, and misanthropic. Vyv was mostly violent and unruly, respecting Mike and tending to pick on his fellow students Rick and Neil, primarily focusing on antagonising the former to the point that they are virtually inseparable. Vyvyan owned both a talking Glaswegian hamster named Special Patrol Group (&quot;SPG&quot; for short), who is subjected to Vyvyan&#x27;s extreme violence, and a yellow Ford Anglia with red flames painted along the sides and &quot;Vyv&quot; written across the back window.
* Rik Mayall as Rick, studying sociology and/or domestic sciences (depending on the episode); hypocritical, radical, attention-seeking, and a self-proclaimed anarchist. Rick is mostly critical towards the others, often insulting Neil but also occasionally Vyvyan (despite Vyvyan&#x27;s violent retaliation to criticism). He proclaimed himself as a vegetarian and an avid fan of Cliff Richard, while constantly adapting himself to different political beliefs, depending on how they will benefit him in a particular situation, despite displaying little understanding of them. According to Ben Elton, Mayall&#x27;s character was influenced by the &quot;try-hard wanna-be Leftie&quot; typically found on university campuses.
* Nigel Planer as Neil Pye, a peace studies student; a morose, pessimistic hippie with pacifist leanings. Neil often wound up having to do all the chores around the house, while the other three students barely acknowledged his presence unless they could blame him for something going wrong.
* Christopher Ryan as Mike the Cool Person, an unscrupulous student; cool, well-dressed, and generally respected. Mike was the straight man and nominal leader of the group. He often conducted profitable business to benefit himself to the detriment of others, but also to keep the others calm during unforeseen issues or situations. It was implied that he held on to his student status through blackmailing the university&#x27;s senior staff.
* Alexei Sayle as various eccentric supporting characters, mostly the students&#x27; landlord Jerzei (Jeremy) Balowski and his family. Jerzei himself was a faux-Russian in that he mainly used a Russian accent to sound &quot;more sophisticated&quot;.

Alongside the main cast, the programme also featured a variety of guest appearances, including comedians, actors, and singers, who each took on the role of a supporting character in an episode&#x27;s plot or cutaway elements. Notable guests on the programme included Ben Elton, Dawn French, Jennifer Saunders, Hale and Pace, Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie, Mark Arden, Stephen Frost, Jools Holland, Mel Smith, Griff Rhys Jones, Anthony Sharp, Terry Jones, Chris Barrie, Helen Lederer, Keith Allen, Paul Merton, Paul Bradley, Pauline Melville, Tamsin Heatley, Ronnie Golden, Roger Sloman, Lee Cornes, Helen Atkinson Wood, Norman Lovett, Lenny Henry, David Rappaport, Robbie Coltrane, Tony Robinson, Andy De La Tour and Emma Thompson.

==International broadcast==

In the United States, &quot;The Young Ones&quot; started airing on MTV (edited for content) on 5 June 1985. The show also ran on PBS, USA Network&#x27;s Night Flight, Comedy Central in 1994, and BBC America in the early 2000s.

In New Zealand, the show premiered late at night on 23 August 1985, after TVNZ purchased the broadcast rights.

In the Netherlands, the show was aired in 1985 by public broadcaster VPRO.

In the Basque Country, public broadcaster ETB1 began airing the show in 1985 in Basque language with the name &quot;Gazteak&quot; (&quot;The Young Ones&quot;) with great success among Basque younger audiences.

In Catalonia, public broadcaster TV3 began airing the show in February 1986 on a Sunday evening slot. The show became very popular and got several re-runs in successive years. In 2016, Nigel Planer appeared in a show involving foreign travellers visiting Catalonia. One of the characteristics of the Catalan dubbing is that Vyvyan speaks with a thick Catalan rural accent, totally opposed to his urban environment in the series.

In Galicia it was shown on regional channel TVG with great success among younger audiences.

In Sweden it was called Hemma värst and was first broadcast in October 1985 by the public broadcaster Sveriges Television.

==Music==
The series&#x27; opening theme song featured the cast singing Cliff Richard and The Shadows&#x27;s UK No. 1 song &quot;The Young Ones&quot; (1961), the title song from the film of the same name. Throughout the series there are many references to Richard, as Mayall&#x27;s character is a devout fan.

The theme over the end credits was written by Peter Brewis, who also created the incidental music on many episodes.

In 1984, after the second series, Planer (in character as Neil) reached No. 2 in the UK charts with a version of Traffic&#x27;s &quot;Hole in My Shoe&quot;. The accompanying &quot;Neil&#x27;s Heavy Concept Album&quot;, a loose collection of songs and spoken comedy, included appearances by &quot;The Young Ones&quot; alumni Dawn French and Stephen Fry.

In 1986 the cast sang &quot;Living Doll&quot; with Cliff Richard and Hank Marvin for Comic Relief. The song, a reworking of his 1959 hit, reached the top of the UK, Australian, and New Zealand Charts.

Eleven of the twelve episodes had a musical guest performing in the house or street. By including the groups, the show qualified as variety rather than light entertainment by the BBC and was allocated a bigger budget than a sitcom. Groups that appeared included Amazulu, Ronnie Golden, Dexys Midnight Runners, Motörhead, The Damned, Nine Below Zero, Rip Rig + Panic, Ken Bishops Nice Twelve, Radical Posture, John Otway and Madness, who appeared in two episodes. The one episode that featured no musical act still fulfilled the variety criteria by including a lion tamer whose presence also directly contributed to the plot.

Some of these performances were omitted from DVD release for copyright reasons. Some musical acts were also edited out for similar reasons on some satellite reruns. On the 2007 DVD release, all the music acts are restored uncut.

==The fifth housemate==
In the first six episodes of the series, a person whose face is covered by hair appears in the background of some scenes, such as to the left when Neil gets hit by Vyvyan with a kettle in &quot;Bomb&quot;. In the episode Demolition, the person appears slumped against the back wall when Rick is watching TV. These rumours of a mysterious fifth housemate have been the subject of fan speculation on the internet. In 2016 journalist Peter Farquhar sent members of the cast and crew email enquiries about this unnamed character. Writer Ben Elton replied, saying &quot;I have no idea what you are talking about I&#x27;m afraid...&quot; By contrast, one of the directors of the series, Geoff Posner, said that he and Paul Jackson &quot;thought it would be fun to have some ghostly figure in the background of some scenes that was never explained or talked about...&quot;

During an event at the Bristol Slapstick Festival 2018, Adrian Edmondson was asked about the fifth housemate during an audience question session, and named the person playing the &#x27;fifth housemate&#x27; as his university friend Mark Dewison. Mark also played a speaking role as Neil&#x27;s friend (also called &#x27;Neil&#x27;) during series one episode &quot;Interesting&quot;. He emerges from Vyvyan&#x27;s full vacuum cleaner bag and ends up being shoved into the fridge by Rick. However, Dewison and the fifth housemate appear together in the same shot towards the end of the episode. In a documentary, &quot;How the Young Ones Changed Comedy&quot;, that aired in 2018 on Gold, series co-writer Lise Mayer said she believed the housemate had arrived to a party at the student house at some point in the past, and had never left.

==Filming locations==
Although the series was set in north London, many external scenes were filmed in Bristol, namely the suburb of Bishopston, where the student house is situated at the top of Codrington Road. Other locations include the Fascist Pig Bank, the Launderette and the Army Careers Office, all around the corner on Gloucester Road. The pub in which Vyvyan&#x27;s mum works, the Kebab and Calculator in the series, was the Cock of the North (since renamed the Westbury Park Tavern) in Northumbria Drive, Bristol. A brief scene in a pharmacy was filmed outside GK Chemists, later taken over by Lloyds Pharmacy, in St Johns Lane, Bedminster. The shop was renamed &quot;OK Chemists&quot; for the scene, in which Mike goes to buy cough medicine, but orders £180 worth of Durex condoms instead—&quot;Force of habit&quot;.

==Reception==
As of 2024, Rotten Tomatoes reports five positive reviews. The series was also praised by Ian Hislop.

==Legacy==
The end of the series was not the last appearance of &quot;The Young Ones&quot;. For the British charity television appeal Comic Relief, the four recorded a song and video for Cliff Richard&#x27;s &quot;Living Doll&quot;, accompanied by Richard and Shadows guitarist Hank B. Marvin. Alexei Sayle was not involved, as he felt collaborating with Richard was against the alternative ethos of the show, but had already achieved chart success in 1984 with &quot;&#x27;Ullo John! Gotta New Motor?&quot;.

In 1984, Planer released an album of music and skits in character as Neil, entitled &quot;Neil&#x27;s Heavy Concept Album&quot;. Musical direction was by Canterbury scene keyboardist Dave Stewart. It featured Stewart&#x27;s alums Barbara Gaskin, Jakko Jakszyk, Pip Pyle, Gavin Harrison, Jimmy Hastings and Rick Biddulph. &quot;Hole in My Shoe&quot;, a single taken from the LP, reached number 2. Soulwax used &quot;Hello Vegetables&quot; to kick off their Radio Soulwax mix &quot;Introversy.&quot;

The program became a cult hit in the United States after MTV began broadcasting edited versions of the episodes during the summer of 1985. Conan O&#x27;Brien cited the show as one of his influences during a Q&amp;A at the Oxford Union.

At the 1986 Comic Relief stage shows, The Young Ones performed &quot;Living Doll&quot; live (following a short skit which involved Rick doing a comic song about showing his underwear and bodily parts, before being ejected from the group by Mike, and Vyvyan supposedly having backstage sex with Kate Bush with Neil as his contraceptive). The skit climaxed with Neil claiming Cliff Richard could not perform with them as he was &quot;doing time&quot; (the musical Time was premiering the following week) and John Craven had been booked as a replacement, only for Cliff to then appear. However he was only available to appear on the second night of the run, with Bob Geldof replacing him on the other two nights.

On one occasion, Edmondson, Mayall and Planer as their &quot;Young Ones&quot; characters did a parody of the song &quot;My Generation&quot; by The Who.

Mayall, Planer, and Edmondson reunited in 1986 for the Elton-written &quot;Filthy Rich &amp; Catflap&quot;. The series had many of the same characteristics as &quot;The Young Ones&quot; as did Mayall and Edmondson&#x27;s next sitcom &quot;Bottom&quot;. Ryan, for his part, was regularly recruited to play roles on associated series (such as &quot;Happy Families&quot;, &quot;Bottom&quot; and &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;). Mayall, Edmondson and Planer have also appeared in episodes of &quot;Blackadder&quot;.

Both series were repeated consecutively over twelve weeks in early 1985, but went unrepeated for four years, when the second series was shown on BBC2. In the mid-1990s all twelve episodes of &quot;The Young Ones&quot; were shown on BBC2 in a 30-minute revised format, missing scenes and dialogue. The series was also shown on digital channel UK Gold throughout the 1990s. A mix of both the edited and unedited versions was shown in the 2000s (decade) on UKTV G2 and Paramount Comedy 1.

DVD releases were initially very basic: Only the US &quot;Every Stoopid Episode&quot; edition featured excerpts from existing documentaries, and no extra footage was included. Musical references proved difficult to clear so &quot;The Sounds of Silence&quot; (one line) and &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot; were excised from the US editions. A new DVD release of all episodes (&quot;Extra Stoopid Edition&quot;) was launched in November 2007, containing new documentaries and two commentary tracks. This edition restores the line from &quot;The Sounds of Silence&quot; and &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot;. The music video &quot;Living Doll&quot; featuring Cliff Richard has not been included on any edition, and neither is the live performance done for comic relief in 1986.

==American pilot episode==
A pilot episode was filmed of an American version of &quot;The Young Ones&quot;, titled &quot;Oh, No! Not THEM!&quot;. It featured Planer as Neil and Jackie Earle Haley, and had a claymation opening credit sequence. The Fox network did not pick up the series. It was produced by David Mirkin.

Robert Llewellyn wrote in his book &quot;The Man in the Rubber Mask&quot; (1994):

In the episode &quot;Bambi&quot;, the housemates appeared on &quot;University Challenge&quot;, where they played against Footlights College, Oxbridge, a reference to the Footlights drama club at Cambridge University. The Footlights College team was played by show writer Ben Elton and three actors who were once members of the real Cambridge Footlights: Emma Thompson, Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry, the last of whom had actually appeared on the quiz show while at Cambridge. The episode title is a reference to the show&#x27;s presenter, Bamber Gascoigne, impersonated by Griff Rhys Jones.

In the episode &quot;Sick&quot;, the quartet enter a scenario parodying &quot;The Good Life&quot;, after Neil&#x27;s mother says the sitcom should be more like &quot;The Good Life&quot; and Vyvyan has an outburst against it, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s so bloody nice! Felicity &#x27;Treacle&#x27; Kendal and Richard &#x27;Sugar-Flavoured Snot&#x27; Briers! What do they do now?! Chocolate-bloody-button ads, that&#x27;s what! They&#x27;re nothing but a couple of reactionary stereotypes, confirming the myth that everyone in Britain is a lovable middle-class eccentric. And I! Hate! Them!&quot;

Mayall and Edmondson elaborated on some of the series&#x27; concepts later in their sitcoms &quot;Filthy Rich &amp; Catflap&quot; (written by Elton, with additional material by Mayall) and &quot;Bottom&quot; (written by Mayall and Edmondson. Christopher Ryan also appeared as Dave Hedgehog).

Most of the regular cast (and several of the guests) also appeared in Channel 4 and BBC2&#x27;s &quot;The Comic Strip Presents&quot; comedy shows. All four main actors went on to gain reputations as both dramatic and comic actors.

In 1988, while playing main character Alan B&#x27;Stard during a brief skit of his political sitcom &quot;The New Statesman&quot; on the BBC&#x27;s Comic Relief telethon, Mayall switched characters to become Rick again and deliver a brief lustful turn to camera on the subject of &quot;Cecil Parkinson and a whip&quot;. In the same year, Planer and Edmondson revived the characters of Neil and Vyvyan, albeit grown up and wearing standard clothes, in an advert for Friends Provident.

Planer played an older Neil on an in-house BBC promotion for the international channel BBC Knowledge (&quot;I haven&#x27;t got a TV, I used it for firewood&quot;) in 1999 and a commercial for Castrol a year later.

In 1990, ITV puppet series &quot;Spitting Image&quot; made reference to &quot;The Young Ones&quot; when four members of the Margaret Thatcher cabinet reminisced about their younger days, with all four playing one &quot;Young Ones&quot; character each: Cecil Parkinson as Mike, Douglas Hurd as Vyvyan, Michael Heseltine as Rick and Geoffrey Howe as Neil.

The 2006 &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; episode &quot;Chimps Ahoy&quot; featured Mayall, Ryan and Planer as guest stars, playing a trio of chimpanzees who come to inspect the progress Sandy Cheeks has made with her inventions.

==Episodes==
When originally broadcast, episodes were shown on BBC2 Tuesdays at 9 pm.

===Series 1 (1982)===
===Series 2 (1984)===
==Repeats==
The series achieved a larger audience through 1980s repeat screenings than it did on first run. Repeats of the programme in the 1990s, when the series was considerably older and less topical, fared less well. As Bambi was also screened during a BBC1 Comic Relief evening (not included below), it was the most-repeated episode, with six repeat screenings from 1985 to 1999. The repeat details of the series up to 2000 were as follows:

==Home media==
Both series of &quot;The Young Ones&quot; have both been released on DVD individually and in a special edition boxset in both regions 2 and 4. Region 1 has two boxsets, one with certain sequences removed due to licensing issues, the other uncut. The entire series is also available for download on iTunes. The series was released on Blu-ray on 28 November 2022 in region B.

The original VHS releases were in a set of 4, each tape containing 3 episodes. The Series 1 and 2 DVDs are rated 15 and three of the VHS releases were rated PG. There were also complete series 1 and complete series 2 VHS releases.
In March 2022 the series was added to BBC iPlayer. The episodes are the 30-minute &#x27;90s edits.
==Video game==

&quot;The Young Ones&quot; is a 1986 video game based on the British comedy television series of the same name.

The game takes place in the students&#x27; home. The player can choose to play as either Mike, Neil, Vyvyan or Rick to explore the house and enter different rooms. The other characters become computer-controlled players. All characters can move around the house, pick up and drop objects, as well as break and fix things. The characters often talk, giving the player clues as to what the character is intended to do.
The aim of the game is to try and move out of the house with all the character&#x27;s belongings in the shortest time possible. This is not so easy, because these possessions are typically not in their preferred condition, or are hidden around the house, and players need various tools to get to them. The other characters will move around the house, behaving in-character, occasionally moving around or further damaging the possessions—making the task harder.

The game was published by Orpheus Software, based in Hatley St George in Bedfordshire. The Young Ones characters were licensed from the owners of the BBC TV series, Rik Mayall, Ben Elton and Lise Mayer.

Due to difficulty in licensing the original series music from the BBC, an alternative music sound track was commissioned to sound similar to the original theme. Over 10,000 copies of the game were sold, mainly through Boots stores, Woolworths, and independent computer stores. Due to obscure bugs in the software, it was impossible to solve the game, although few users realised this at the time. Orpheus ceased trading before the problems could be remedied.

<text>Curry College is a private college in Milton, Massachusetts, United States. It was founded as the School of Elocution and Expression by Anna Baright in 1879. In 1885, it was taken over and renamed by Samuel Silas Curry.

==History==
Curry College was founded in 1879 on Boston&#x27;s Beacon Street near the State House by Anna Baright as the School of Elocution and Expression. Baright graduated from the Boston University School of Oratory in 1877 and was described by one of her professors as &quot;the greatest woman reader in the country.&quot; This was a significant compliment in an era of oratory when speakers like Charles Dickens and Mark Twain were paid thousands to read lengthy pieces of their work. In 1882, Baright married Boston minister and fellow Boston University alumnus and professor Samuel Silas Curry.

The School of Elocution and Expression had many prominent Bostonians on its Board including Alexander Graham Bell, Alexander Melville Bell, the father of Alexander Graham Bell, legendary Harvard President Charles W. Eliot and author William Dean Howells, who wrote &quot;The Rise of Silas Lapham&quot; and was nominated for the Nobel Prize for Literature. Among the students in attendance were Smiley Blanton and Sara Stinchfield Hawk, who became pioneers in the field of speech language pathology.

In 1885, the school became the School of Expression and, in 1888, the school was chartered by the state. Silas Curry became the head of the school, and Anna Baright Curry became a professor. Former Boston University School of Oratory professor and telephone inventor Alexander Graham Bell became the school&#x27;s first chancellor from 1907 to 1922 when Mr. Bell died. Bell, as a professor at Boston University, taught Samuel Silas Curry and, according to the recollections of Curry&#x27;s daughter, Silas Curry was present when Bell made the first telephone call in 1876. After Mr. Bell&#x27;s death, Samuel Silas Curry and Anna Baright ran the school until their respective deaths in 1921 and Avenue. In 1932, Curry College relocated to the Bigelow Mansion at 251 Commonwealth Avenue in the Back Bay. In 1932, Curry began a radio broadcasting major, still considered the oldest of its kind in the country. In 1938, the Massachusetts Legislature gave the institution the power to confer the degrees of Bachelor of Science of Oratory and Master of Science of Oratory. In 1943, the School of Expression became Curry College to reflect its founders.

Curry College moved from Commonwealth Avenue in Boston to its current suburban location in Milton, Massachusetts in 1952. Curry continued to place strong emphasis on communication and self-development but it now became more diversified in its curriculum. In 1953, the college was authorized by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to confer the Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science Degrees. The first of these degrees was awarded in 1955.

Despite the dramatic change in the school&#x27;s mission after the 1952 move to Milton, Massachusetts, Curry College maintained its debt to its founders and their scholarship focus that centered on the delivery of words. Curry College sponsors an award-winning, non-commercial radio station WMLN-FM 91.5 operated by Curry students.

During the 1960s, the growth of Curry was led by President John Hafer, a former Academic Dean at Coe College in Cedar Rapids, Iowa and Dean of Admissions at Syracuse University. 

==Academics==
Curry College offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees in 25 majors and master&#x27;s degree in four majors. One certificate program is administered through the Continuing Education office. Army and Air Force Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) programs are offered through a cross-enrolled program with Boston University.

Curry College is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.

==Campus==
Curry&#x27;s main campus in Milton is near the Blue Hills Reservation. The campus is from downtown Boston. Curry maintains a satellite campus in Plymouth offering eight bachelor&#x27;s degree programs, two master&#x27;s degree programs, and one certificate program, through the Office of Continuing Education and Graduate Studies.

The Milton campus is separated into north and south campuses with the Student Center located in the center of campus. The campus has 19 residence halls with a mix of traditional dormitories, suites and houses. Plans are underway to build a dome-style sports complex and a food court.

===Student Center===
The Student Center opened its doors in September, 2009. It replaced the Drapkin Student Center. The building houses a fitness center, a gymnasium, a dining marketplace, a game room, the James P. O&#x27;Toole Chapel and multiple meeting rooms and lounges. The mail room, campus bookstore, Disability Services, Conference and Event Services, Residence Life office, and Student Activities office are also located within the Student Center. The Hallways of Champions, located outside of the doors of the gymnasium, showcases trophies and awards of teams and individual athletes throughout Curry&#x27;s history.

The Curry College Student Center, with its central campus location and wide array of activities, services and spiritual activities including The Newman Club for Catholic students, Hillel for Jewish students and JAM (Jesus and ME) for non-denominational Christians
has been the hub of the Curry campus since its opening in 2009.

==Student life==
Curry has an enrollment of approximately 4,250 students. 2,100 are traditional students from over 31 states and 13 countries. Approximately 1,500 of these students reside in the nineteen residence halls on campus. 1,650 Curry students study in continuing education courses and about 500 Curry students are in graduate school pursuing master&#x27;s degrees and certificates. Continuing education and graduate students study at either the main Milton campus or the Plymouth satellite campus.

===Extra curriculars===
Curry students made over 36 clubs and organizations. Students are offered the opportunity to create new clubs which takes about three years as through the Student Activities Office. Students can also take part in TMZ Boston, which houses an office on campus.

===Athletics===

Curry College&#x27;s athletic teams are nicknamed the Colonels. Curry is a member of the NCAA Division III and participates in the Conference of New England.

Curry offers baseball, basketball, football, ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer and tennis for men and basketball, cross country, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis and volleyball for women. All sports are played on campus except for hockey which plays at the Canton Ice House in Canton, Massachusetts.

Curry also has numerous intramural and club sports. The men&#x27;s rugby club competes throughout New England with other colleges. The Curry College Bowling team and Billiards Club compete with surrounding colleges. The team members receive individual and group lessons on and off campus. Additional clubs exist on campus that do not compete against other colleges&#x27; clubs.

The Boston Patriots, now the New England Patriots, used the Curry College football field for its in-season practice facility in 1967 while playing its home games in Fenway Park. During its year at Curry the Patriots were led by American Football League MVP Jim Nance, Hall of Fame member Nick Buoniconti and kicker and longtime Patriot announcer, Gino Cappelletti. Heisman Trophy winner Joe Bellino from Winchester and The Naval Academy was also a member of the Boston team as was Everett High School and Harvard University great, Bobby Leo.

Starting in 2020, Curry announced that they would no longer be using the colonel mascot on uniforms or merchandise . A decision on whether to change the team name is pending

The treaty was to resolve disputes arising from the execution of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814. For the Dutch, it was signed by Hendrik Fagel and Anton Reinhard Falck, and for the British, George Canning and Charles Williams-Wynn.

==History==
The Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824, designed to solve issues arising from British occupation of Dutch colonial possessions during the Napoleonic Wars, as well as trading rights existing for hundreds of years in the Spice Islands between the two nations, addressed a wide array of issues but did not clearly describe limitations of expansion by either side in maritime Southeast Asia.
The British establishment of Singapore on the Malay Peninsula in 1819 by Sir Stamford Raffles exacerbated tensions between the two nations, especially as the Dutch claimed that the treaty signed between Raffles and the Sultan of Johor was invalid and that the Sultanate of Johor was under the Dutch sphere of influence. Dutch trading rights in British India and former Dutch possessions in the area were also points of contention. In 1820, under pressure from British merchants with interests in the Far East, negotiations to clarify the situation in Southeast Asia started.

Negotiations between Castlereagh, Canning&#x27;s predecessor, and Fagel started on 20 July 1820. The Dutch were adamant that the British should abandon Singapore, but Castlereagh was unsure exactly how Singapore had even been acquired. At first, only noncontroversial issues such as free navigation rights and the elimination of piracy were agreed upon. Discussions on the subject were suspended on 5 August 1820, and did not resume until 1823, when the commercial value of Singapore was understood by the British.

Negotiations resumed in December 1823, centred around establishment of clear spheres of influence in the region. The Dutch, realising that the growth of Singapore could not be curbed, pressed for an exchange in which they would abandon their claims north of the Strait of Malacca and their Indian colonies in exchange for confirmation of their claims south of the strait, including the British colony of Bencoolen. The final treaty was signed on 17 March 1824 by Fagel and Canning.

The treaty was ratified by the UK on 30 April 1824 and by the Netherlands on 2 June 1824. The ratifications were exchanged at London on 8 June 1824.

==Terms==
* Subjects of the two nations were permitted to trade in territories of British India, British Ceylon and modern-day Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia on the basis of &quot;most favoured nation&quot; but had to obey local regulations.
* Fees charged on the subjects and ships of the other nation were limited.
* No further treaties with Eastern states that excluded trade with the other nation were to be made.
* Civil and military forces were not to be used to hinder trade.
* Piracy was to be opposed, no hiding places or protection to pirates were to be provided and the sale of pirated goods was not to be allowed.
* Officials were not allowed to open new offices on East Indies islands without permission from their government in Europe.
* British subjects to be given trade access with the Maluku Islands, in particular with Ambon, Banda and Ternate.
* The Netherlands ceded all establishments on the Indian Subcontinent (Dutch India from 1609) and any rights associated with them.
* The UK ceded its factory of Fort Marlborough in Bencoolen (Bengkulu) and all the British possessions on the island of Sumatra to the Netherlands and would not establish another office on the island or make any treaty with its rulers.
* The Netherlands ceded the city and fort of Malacca and agreed not to open any office on the Malay Peninsula or to make any treaty with its rulers.
* The British withdrew its opposition to the occupation of the island of Billiton by the Netherlands.
* The Netherlands withdrew its opposition to the occupation of the island of Singapore by the British.
* The British agreed not to establish any office on the Carimon Islands or on the islands of Batam, Bintan, Lingin, or any of the other islands south of the strait of Singapore, or to make any treaties with the rulers of these places.
* All transfers of property and establishments were to take place on 1 March 1825, with the return of Java to the Netherlands, as according to a Convention on Java of 24 June 1817, was settled, apart from a sum of 100,000 pounds sterling, which was to be paid by the Netherlands in London before the end of 1825.

==Implications==
The Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 officially demarcated two territories: Malaya, which was ruled by the United Kingdom; and the Dutch East Indies, which was ruled by the Netherlands. The successor states of Malaya are Malaysia and Singapore, and the successor state of the Dutch East Indies is mostly Indonesia. The line that separated the spheres of influence between the British and the Dutch ultimately became the border between Indonesia and Malaysia (with a small segment becoming the border between Indonesia and Singapore). The subsequent colonial influence also affected the Malay language that was commonly spoken as a regional language between these islands, diverging into Malaysian and Indonesian variants.

<text>Abhay Vasant Ashtekar (born 5 July 1949) is an Indian theoretical physicist who created Ashtekar variables and is one of the founders of loop quantum gravity and its subfield loop quantum cosmology. Ashtekar has also written a number of descriptions of loop quantum gravity that are accessible to non-physicists. He is an Evan Pugh Professor Emeritus of Physics and former Director of the Institute for Gravitational Physics and Geometry (now Institute for Gravitation and the Cosmos) and Center for Fundamental Theory at Pennsylvania State University.

In 1999, Ashtekar and his colleagues were able to calculate the entropy for a black hole, matching a 1974 prediction by Stephen Hawking. Oxford mathematical physicist Roger Penrose has described Ashtekar&#x27;s approach to quantum gravity as &quot;The most important of all the attempts at &#x27;quantizing&#x27; general relativity.&quot; Ashtekar was elected member of the National Academy of Sciences in May 2016.

==Biography==
Abhay Ashtekar grew up in several cities, including Mumbai, in the state of Maharashtra, India. After completing his undergraduate education in India, Ashtekar enrolled in the graduate program for gravitation at the University of Texas at Austin. He went on to complete his PhD at the University of Chicago under the supervision of Robert Geroch in 1978 and held several appointments at Oxford, Paris, Syracuse before settling at Pennsylvania State University.

He married Christine Clarke in 1986 and the two have a son, Neil Ashtekar.

==Religious views==
Abhay Ashtekar is an atheist, though he enjoys reading on Indian and other eastern philosophy, namely the Tao and the Zen traditions. Furthermore, he believes to be inspired from the Bhagavad Gita as regards his attitude towards work.

<text>Staurakios or Stauracius (; early 790s – 11 January 812) was the shortest-reigning Byzantine emperor, ruling for 68 days between 26 July and 2 October 811.

He was born in the early 790s, probably between 791 and 793, to Nikephoros I and an unknown woman. Nikephoros seized the throne of the Byzantine Empire from Empress Irene in 802, and elevated Staurakios to co-emperor on 25 December 803. On 20 December 807, a bride show was held by Nikephoros to select a wife for Staurakios, which resulted in his marriage to Theophano of Athens, a kinswoman of Irene. Little else is known of him until he came to take the throne upon the death of Nikephoros.

Staurakios took part in an invasion of the Bulgarian Khanate in 811, alongside his father and brother-in-law. Although initially successful, with the Byzantines laying siege to the Bulgarian capital of Pliska and defeating a relief force, they were soon ambushed by Khan Krum, and trapped in a small valley. The Bulgarians then attacked, starting the Battle of Pliska on 26 July 811, wherein much of the Byzantine army was destroyed, and Nikephoros was slain. Carried back to Constantinople by litter, Staurakios was declared emperor despite his severe injuries from the battle, which included the severing of his spine. While this was done to maintain legitimacy in the succession, the question of his successor was hotly debated. His reign was short due to the political uncertainties surrounding his wounds; he was usurped by his brother-in-law, who acceded to the imperial throne as Michael I Rhangabe, on 2 October 811. After being removed from power, he was sent to live in a monastery, where he stayed until he died, either of gangrene or poisoned by his sister, Prokopia, on 11 January 812.

==Biography==
===Early life and background===
Staurakios was born in the early 790s, probably between 791 and 793, to Nikephoros I and an unknown woman. The historian J. B. Bury stated that he was likely younger than his sister Prokopia. Staurakios was named after his paternal grandfather. His father was likely the same Nikephoros as the one who had been of the Armeniac Theme before being deposed for supporting Empress Irene (). He was also possibly (finance minister) at the time of Staurakios″ birth, as he achieved this rank by 797. Nikephoros revolted against Irene on 31 October 802 AD, and seized the throne for himself, exiling Irene to a convent on the island of Principo. Treadgold comments that this was &quot;a bloodless and relatively harmonious transfer of power&quot;, and that while Nikephoros seized the throne from Irene, he did not displace her regime, but rather usurped it for himself. Staurakios was around 10–12 years old at the time Nikephoros became emperor. At the beginning of his rule, Nikephoros had strong support from the bureaucracy, and superficially positive relations with the army and clergy.

Treadgold suggests that Nikephoros had witnessed &quot;a good deal of financial mismanagement&quot; before he seized power, but was unable to prevent it at that time. Indeed, one of his first acts as emperor was to seize control of a secret treasury reserve from Irene. Soon after, he took measures to increase the treasury, such as canceling tribute payments to the Abbasid Caliphate, an &quot;exorbitant and humiliating payment&quot;, accepting the risk of war. Later, he ended the suspension of urban tariffs and estate taxes that Irene had implemented. Treadgold comments that the suspension of Irene&#x27;s popular fiscal policies was bold, and risked reducing his own popularity, but that Nikephoros must have considered them too expensive to continue, and was aware that the capital was relatively undertaxed compared to the rest of the empire. He took similar efforts to tackle the issue of corruption, founding a new court where he heard complaints levied by the poor against the elites. While his supporters praised him for championing the poor, opponents declaimed him for his measures against the wealthy. Some of these opponents also alleged greed, but Treadgold comments that this likely referred to the effort Nikephoros put into collecting revenues, as the man himself was famously austere.

===Reign as co-emperor===
Staurakios was not given an official government position upon his father&#x27;s accession to the throne, but, in the summer of 803, a general named Bardanes Tourkos revolted against Nikephoros, prompting a change of course. Originally of the Thracesian Theme, Nikephoros had consolidated the five major themes of Asia Minor—Anatolic, Armeniac, Bucellarian, Opsikion, and Thracesian—under Bardanes″ control as of the combined area. When the Abbasid Caliphate began preparations for an attack that summer, Nikephoros was unable to take command due to an injury sustained in May, the role fell to Bardanes, who advanced his troops and began preparations. There, his troops grumbled over Nikephoros″ financial policies, which included the reinstatement of the estate tax on soldiers; by comparison, Bardanes was considered to be very charitable in dividing war spoils, and thus they declared him emperor on July 19. Treadgold comments that although the rebellion theoretically commanded nearly half of the army, Bardanes seemed to lack the commitment to become emperor, and soon discussed terms with Nikephoros, who swore not to harm Bardanes or his soldiers if Bardanes would surrender and enter the monastery, which Bardanes did in early September. Although Nikephoros abided by his pledge not to harm the surrendered men, he did seize a significant amount of money and property from the leaders of the rebellion, fined four of the themes a year&#x27;s worth of salary, and exiled some bishops to the remote island of Pantelleria, near Sicily. Nikephoros soon negotiated a moderate deal with the Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid, including a small tribute payment. 

Although his revolt was put down by early September, it convinced Nikephoros to consolidate his hold on the throne and secure the succession, by declaring Staurakios co-emperor and heir, which he did on Christmas Day of 803. Staurakios was crowned by the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople Tarasios in the Hagia Sophia. By making Staurakios emperor, Nikephoros removed any question of the imperial succession and increased his own legitimacy—although Staurakios, now somewhere between the ages of 11 and 13, was not yet old enough to actually exercise power. The contemporary chronicler Theophanes the Confessor stated that Staurakios was &quot;completely unfit in appearance, strength, and judgment for such an honor&quot;, but this is likely a reflection of Theophanes&#x27; own animosity toward Nikephoros and Staurakios. While opponents of Nikephoros decried Staurakios as sickly, Treadgold comments that any health issues he may have had did not prevent later participation in military campaigns; opponents also presented his obedience to his father as a failing.

When Tarasios died in 806, Nikephoros selected a man named Nikephoros, who was residing in a monastery, to succeed him. For the installation ceremony of Nikephoros as patriarch, where the new patriarch was tonsured, Staurakios was sent to represent his father. That same year, the Byzantine Empire faced a massive invasion from the Abbasid Caliphate, which forced Nikephoros to accept humiliating peace terms, paying an annual tribute of 30,000 and six great gold medals, three for Nikephoros and three for Staurakios.

Except for the installation ceremony of Patriarch Nikephoros, Staurakios is not mentioned in the sources until 807, when his father arranged Staurakios&#x27; marriage, holding an imperial bride-show to select a wife on 20 December 807. This was the second recorded Byzantine bride-show, after the one held by Constantine VI () by his mother, Empress Irene. During the bride show, Theophano of Athens was selected, likely due to the fact that she was a kinswoman of Irene, and therefore would help add legitimacy to both Nikephoros″ and Staurakios″ rule. According to Theophanes, she was chosen despite the fact that she was already engaged to a man, whom she had slept with premaritally, and was not the most beautiful of the women presented at the bride show. Staurakios and Theophano married that same month.

After his marriage, Staurakios is not mentioned again until 811, when Nikephoros prepared his invasion of the Bulgarian Khanate in May of that year. The Bulgarians had been a serious threat to the empire since the reign of Constantine IV (), who launched a calamitous attack against them. Tensions rose between 808 and 811, resulting in outright warfare. Nikephoros led the campaign over the Balkan Mountains and into the Bulgarian Khanate alongside Staurakios, who by now was in his late teens, and many senior imperial officials. The campaign saw great success at first, with the Byzantine forces attacking the Bulgarian capital of Pliska, defeating first the 12,000-strong garrison of the city, and then a relief force of 15,000 sent by Khan Krum (). In correspondence sent to Constantinople, Nikephoros credited his success to the strategic advice of Staurakios. The victorious Byzantine forces began to march back to the Byzantine Empire, but a desperate Krum managed to trap the Byzantine army in a small valley with palisades, before launching a massive assault two days later, on 26 July 811. The Battle of Pliska resulted in a Bulgarian massacre of the Byzantine forces. Much of the Byzantine army was destroyed, and Nikephoros himself was slain.

===Rule as sole emperor===

The remaining Byzantine forces, including a severely wounded Staurakios, retreated to Adrianople over three days. Staurakios&#x27; spine had been severed during the battle, which along with his demonstrated lack of ability, led three influential figures in the Empire, who travelled with Nikephoros and Staurakios but were uninjured, to consider the issue of Nikephoros&#x27; successor. These were the ( Master of Offices, by this time honorific) Theoktistos, the Domestic of the Schools, Stephanos, and Nikephoros&#x27; son-in-law, the (high-ranking court official) Michael Rhangabe. The severity of Staurakios″ wounds led to speculation as to whether he would live, although eventually those assembled judged he would make the best candidate, as the legitimate successor, and declared him emperor. The historian George Ostrogorsky comments that this was done &quot;in strict conformity with the principle of legitimacy&quot;, and that the final settlement of the succession was to take place in Constantinople, where Staurakios would crown his successor. This was the first time a Byzantine emperor was installed outside of Constantinople, due to the urgency of the situation.

Staurakios gave a speech to the surviving troops, where he insulted Nikephoros″ military judgment, before being acclaimed by the army. The historian Christian Laes comments that it is difficult to assess the condition that Staurakios was in, and how he was able to deliver his virulent speech.

Almost immediately after Staurakios acceded to the throne, Michael was pressured to usurp it, due to the legitimacy granted to him by his marriage to Staurakios&#x27; sister Prokopia and his military abilities. Theoktistos and others attempted to convince Michael to take the throne, although he repeatedly refused at this time, citing an oath of loyalty he had made to both Nikephoros and Staurakios, as well as his family ties to Staurakios via his marriage to Prokopia. The historians Edward Foord and George Finlay comment that the army seemed willing to stand by Staurakios, but for his mortal wounds posing a threat to the succession of the empire, and the enemies that had been made by the severe fiscal policies of Nikephoros. As Finlay argues, a change in administration implied a change of emperor, causing many who would profit from a change of ruler to support Michael.

Staurakios was brought by litter to Constantinople. By this time, it had been discovered that he had blood in his urine, and was paralyzed from the waist down. In spite of his ill health, Staurakios endeavored to assert his authority, including rebuffing the attempts of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, Nikephoros I, to have funds that Nikephoros had collected returned to the church. Laes comments that &quot;Possibly, a link between Staurakios’ bad condition and his father&#x27;s sins was thus established&quot; by Patriarch Nikephoros&#x27; insistence that Staurakios placate God and compensate those who his father had harmed. 

The severity of his injury, and the lack of any children to nominate as heirs led to a debate about who would succeed him, as his impending death was considered a certainty. Ostrogorsky comments that an interregnum was seen as particularly undesirable due to the imminent danger from the Abbasid Caliphate and the Bulgarian Khanate, and that a return to normality was therefore essential. The delay of Staurakios in selecting a successor caused passionate dispute within the capital. Staurakios″ sister Prokopia backed her husband Michael, while Empress Theophano was put forth as a candidate for the succession; she may have hoped to take the throne the same way her kinswoman Irene had. The only proof of such intrigues given by contemporary historians comes from records that Staurakios became hostile to Theoktistos and Michael, which would suggest he was aware of their plottings, and that he suspected Prokopia of conspiring to kill him. Staurakios reportedly wavered between two possible options for his succession. The first, to make Theophano empress-regnant, and the second, attested in a ninth-century chronicle, to institute a form of imperial democracy. Bury dismisses the second option as the machinations of Staurakios&#x27; addled brain, and furthermore questions the authenticity of the report. The historian Aikaterina Christophilopoulou argued that Bury&#x27;s narrative of an imperial democracy stems from a misunderstanding of a passage from Theophanes. Instead, the proper reading seems to be that Staurakios feared that crowning his wife might lead to a civil war, or the empowering of the chariot factions. After hearing of the options Staurakios was considering, Patriarch Nikephoros began to align himself with Stephanos, Theoktistos, and Michael. Afraid of the possibility of a public uprising due to the lack of an heir, Staurakios declared Theophano his successor. This decision united the chief leaders and officials of the Byzantine Empire behind Michael, as they did not desire to return to the uncertainty which had pervaded Irene&#x27;s rule, due to her ruling despite being a woman.

On 1 October 811, Staurakios summoned Stephanos, whom he trusted likely because Stephanos was the first to proclaim Staurakios emperor. He proposed blinding Michael, unaware that Stephanos supported him. Stephanos assured Staurakios of the strength of his position, and dissuaded him from having Michael blinded, claiming he was too well-protected for an attempted blinding to succeed. Stephanos, after swearing he would not reveal the discussion to anyone else, organized a coup to bring Michael to power. Stephanos gathered the remaining tagmatic forces and senate at the Great Palace of Constantinople, and declared Michael emperor. Michael first proposed that the &quot;stratēgos&quot; Leo, future emperor (), take the throne, but agreed to accept the crown himself when Leo promised to support him. Michael gained the full support of Patriarch Nikephoros by forging an agreement wherein he promised to uphold Orthodoxy, to not persecute Christians, or use violence against clergy or monks. At dawn on the morning of 2 October, Michael was publicly proclaimed emperor in the Hippodrome of Constantinople, and crowned a few hours later by Patriarch Nikephoros, at the pulpit of the Hagia Sophia. Upon hearing of this, Staurakios hastened to abdicate, fearing his execution otherwise; his reign was one of the shortest in Byzantine history. Staurakios summoned his relative, the monk Simeon, and was tonsured and dressed in monastic garb. Staurakios also sent a letter of protest to Patriarch Nikephoros for his role in the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;; Nikephoros answered in person, writing alongside Michael and Prokopia, and assured Staurakios that he had not betrayed him, but rather protected him. Staurakios was unimpressed and informed the Patriarch that &quot;you will not find him [Michael] a better friend&quot;, meaning that Michael would not be more useful to Nikephoros than Staurakios himself had been.

Staurakios lived another three months before dying of gangrene on 11 January 812. He was buried in the Monastery of Braka, which was given to Theophano by Prokopia. There were allegations that he was poisoned by his sister Prokopia, rather than dying of gangrene, reported by the Syriac sources—the &quot;Chronicle of 813&quot; and Michael the Syrian—and the chronicle of the Petros of Alexandria. Theophanes considered these rumors possible and mentions that Theophano herself considered these rumors to be true. According to the , a 10th-century book describing Byzantine courtly protocol and history written by Constantine VII, Staurakios was buried in a white marble sarcophagus that would later be shared with Theophano.

==Historiography==
Because of the brevity of Staurakios″ reign, and the shortcomings and bias of the sources, much of his life is unknown. The main source for the reigns of both Nikephoros I and Staurakios is Theophanes″ &quot;Chronographia&quot;, which was tainted by Theophanes″ dislike of the former, although it does hint that Staurakios possessed a talent for military strategy. Although many historians believe that both Nikephoros and Staurakios have been falsely portrayed as malevolent, few other sources exist for their reign. Most other sources take the form of short references, which provide little insight, and include many errors, especially the Syriac &quot;Chronicle of 813&quot;. While Michael the Syrian, Bar Hebraeus, Michael Psellos, and the &quot;Chronicle of 813&quot; all record the events immediately before the death of Staurakios, the death itself, and ascribe a cause, they are generally inaccurate. Indeed, the &quot;Chronicle of 813&quot; even mistakes the time of death of Staurakios, giving it as two months into his reign, rather than nearly six months after the battle. Petros of Alexandria, in his &quot;Brief Survey of Years&quot;, which in most areas merely gives the length of reigns for the Byzantine emperors, mentions the alleged poisoning of Staurakios by Prokopia.

==Numismatics==
The coins of the joint reign of Nikephoros and Staurakios are similar to those of the Isaurian dynasty, in that they show the junior emperor (Staurakios) on the reverse, and senior emperor (Nikephoros) on the obverse. On them, Staurakios is given the title of &quot;despotēs&quot;, and Nikephoros labeled as &quot;basileus&quot;. Both wear a chlamys and carry an akakia, however, Nikephoros holds in his right hand the cross potent, whereas Staurakios holds a globus cruciger. There are, oddly, no silver coins minted for the joint reign of the two. The numismatist Philip Grierson comments that one would expect to be struck for the coronation of Staurakios, but speculates that &quot;the explanation is to be found in Nikephoros&#x27; habits&quot;. No known coins were minted for the sole reign of Staurakios, perhaps because it was not considered worthwhile to make new coin dies for the mortally wounded emperor. Grierson makes the comment that the discovery of for Empresses Zoë Porphyrogenita (1042) and Theodora Porphyrogenita (1042) reveals that a reign of roughly two months might justify a mint in creating coins for the ruler, and therefore coins of Staurakios might exist, yet undiscovered; however, Grierson considers it equally likely that the dying emperor simply continued to mint the old coins, under his father&#x27;s name. The numismatist Maria Vrij comments that &quot;producing new coins in the emperor&#x27;s name can hardly have been a pressing concern, since his very survival was not certain&quot;. She also stated the possibility that the absence of coins for the sole reign of Staurakios might be a result of a &quot;dearth of archaeological material&quot;, but stated that as time passes without the discovery of such coins, the possibility becomes more remote, but is &quot;technically possible and therefore worth acknowledging.&quot;

==Legacy==
Staurakios largely existed in the shadow of Nikephoros; little is known about him. Staurakios only reigned for just over two months, and was therefore unable to leave a mark on the empire as his father had done. Hints from the &quot;Chronographia&quot; suggest that Staurakios wielded strategic understanding, and perhaps that Staurakios was as strong-willed as his father, but his character is otherwise unknown. For these reasons, historian Matthew Marsh comments that &quot;he remains a brief and shadowy figure in the history of the Empire&quot;. Both Nikephoros and Staurakios were generally successful in maintaining the borders of the Byzantine Empire, although they did not achieve much military success, occasionally being forced to make humiliating concessions to powerful enemies, such as the Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid.

<doc id="181286" wikidata="Q2169569" url="?curid=181286" title="Men Behaving Badly">
<text>Men Behaving Badly is a British sitcom that was created and written by Simon Nye. It follows the lives of Gary Strang (Martin Clunes) and his flatmates Dermot Povey (Harry Enfield; series 1 only) and Tony Smart (Neil Morrissey; series 2 onwards). It was first broadcast on ITV in 1992. A total of six series were made, along with a Christmas special and a trilogy of episodes that make up the feature-length &quot;last orders&quot;.

The series was filmed in and around Ealing in West London. The setting, however, is implied to be South London, and many references are made to Surrey. It was produced by Hartswood Films in association with Thames for the first two series on ITV. They also assisted with production of the third series onwards that aired on the BBC, after Thames had lost their regional ITV franchise for London at the end of 1992 to Carlton Television.

&quot;Men Behaving Badly&quot; became highly successful after being moved to a post-watershed slot on BBC1. It won the Comedy Awards&#x27; best ITV comedy and the first National Television Award for Situation Comedy.

==Plot summary==
Gary and Dermot are two London-based, beer-guzzling flatmates who typically spend most of their time in front of the television or in pursuit of women. When Deborah, an attractive single woman, moves into the flat above, both men become obsessed with her, despite Gary already having a steady girlfriend, Dorothy.

When series two begins, it is revealed Dermot has left to travel the world, leading Gary to look for a new flatmate. Record stall owner Tony Smart then moves in and, although Gary is unsure of him at first, the two soon become good friends, revelling in a second childhood, hours of TV and mindless talks about women. Tony quickly becomes obsessed with Deborah and, unlike with Dermot, she initially shows an interest in return. However, Tony&#x27;s immaturity quickly drives her to distraction, and his pursuit of Deborah becomes increasingly one-sided.

Gary manages an office selling security equipment for a dead-end company. His staff of ageing employees are the meek George and lifelong spinster Anthea, who regularly drive him to frustration with their old-fashioned views. Tony stumbles through a range of jobs including as a model, barman, mime artist and postman, after his record stall (literally) collapses.

Dorothy is an intelligent and mature nurse, and it is stated one of the main reasons she went out with Gary was because he annoyed her parents. She and Gary frequently split up and are occasionally unfaithful, including one night when Dorothy sleeps with Tony, but they always end up back together. Tony has many girlfriends but his true feelings are for Deborah, whom he initially just wants to have sex with, but quickly falls in love with, in spite of her generally poor treatment of him. Deborah is often disappointed by Tony&#x27;s juvenile behaviour, but can also see his good side. The two finally end up in a relationship in series six.

Although Dorothy initially dislikes Deborah (disparagingly referring to her as &quot;Miss Wet Dream&quot; in series two), the two bond over their shared frustration at the two men and develop a strong friendship, eventually becoming flatmates themselves.

==Cast==
*Martin Clunes plays Gary Strang, manager of a security sales office with two old-fashioned, middle-aged subordinates. He owns the flat that he shares with Dermot, and later Tony. He is in a long-term, albeit off-and-on, relationship with Dorothy. Gary is arrogant and immature for his age, which frequently annoys Dorothy.
*Harry Enfield plays Dermot Povey, Gary&#x27;s original flatmate, in series one. Dermot is forever failing to pay his rent and is desperately in love with Deborah. He leaves for a round-the-world motorbike tour. Unlike Tony, Dermot seems to come from a similar background to Gary.
*Neil Morrissey plays Tony Smart from series two onwards. Tony is Gary&#x27;s womanising flatmate, who is infatuated with Deborah. He is well meaning but has a habit of annoying those around him with his thoughtless comments and off-the-wall behaviour. He also has musical ambitions which are not matched by his abilities.
*Leslie Ash plays Deborah Burton, an attractive blonde woman who lives in the flat above Gary and Tony. Deborah works in a restaurant, and although attracted to Tony, his immaturity, devil-may-care attitude and other aspects of his character push her away.
*Caroline Quentin plays Dorothy Martin/Bishop, Gary&#x27;s outspoken girlfriend. She is a nurse who initially lives with her parents, before moving in with Gary and Tony in series five. She later makes friends with Deborah, eventually becoming her flatmate.
*Ian Lindsay plays George, an employee with old fashioned views at Gary&#x27;s security firm. George is married to the unseen Marjorie, with whom he has a son.
*Valerie Minifie plays Anthea, an employee at Gary&#x27;s security firm with views similar to George. Anthea is a lifelong spinster.
* Dave Atkins plays Les, the landlord of The Crown, Gary and Tony&#x27;s local pub, who is briefly Tony&#x27;s boss. His appalling hygiene standards are matched by the run down and unkempt nature of the pub.
* John Thomson plays Ken, Les&#x27; successor as landlord of The Crown, from series five onwards. He knows nothing about the pub trade, admitting he got the job because his brother-in-law was sleeping with the personnel officer at the brewery, and his attempts to modernise the pub are undermined by his lack of experience in the role. He is also briefly Tony&#x27;s boss.

==Episodes==

The show aired for six series and 42 episodes, including a Christmas special titled &quot;Jingle Balls&quot;, which was broadcast at Christmas 1997. A final short run of three 45-minute episodes was made in 1998 to conclude the series.

Series one was the only series to feature Dermot (played by Harry Enfield) before Neil Morrissey joined the cast as Tony. The first two series&#x27; episodes run for about 24 minutes due to airing on ITV with time needed for advertisements. After moving to the BBC, episodes run about four minutes longer.

==Production==
&quot;Men Behaving Badly&quot; is based on Simon Nye&#x27;s 1989 book of the same title. Producer Beryl Vertue first considered it for a film before deciding it was suited for television adaptation. Harry Enfield, already a well-known comedian, was cast first. He had seen Martin Clunes perform in a play and recommended him for the other lead.

Enfield felt out of place in the sitcom and announced he was leaving after the first series. When Thames Television found out, their immediate reaction was to end the series, and they had to be persuaded to put on a second series, with Neil Morrissey replacing Enfield. After Thames lost their television franchise, ITV decided that a peak viewing figure of seven million was insufficient and withdrew support. Incensed, Vertue approached the BBC who agreed to broadcast the show.

In 1994, the BBC aired the first of a further four series. The shift to a new station and a later time slot meant, as the BBC claimed, the show could indulge in &quot;more colourful language and behaviour&quot;. The show became highly successful on BBC1, drawing a cult following.

In 2002 it was revealed that Simon Nye and the cast had agreed to revive the series for three further specials the following year, in which Vertue wanted the show to focus on how Gary and Dorothy were coping with parenthood. The idea was shelved the following year after Caroline Quentin became pregnant. In October 2014, Clunes and Morrissey returned to the characters of Gary and Tony for the first time since 1998 in a sketch for Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The Feeling Nuts Comedy Night&quot; and &quot;Stand Up to Cancer&quot; telethon.

The first series (featuring Enfield) never repeated on the BBC; the second ITV series (featuring Morrissey) has been repeated.

In October 2024, the BBC announced that Neil Morrissey and Martin Clunes are set to reunite for a new travel series titled &quot;Neil &amp; Martin’s Bon Voyage&quot;, which will feature their road trip across France, exploring local culture and cuisine while reminiscing about their 30-year friendship.

==Reception==
A BBC article suggests that Gary and Tony were &quot;a reaction against the onset of the caring, sharing &#x27;new man&#x27;. It appeared to revel in a politically incorrect world of booze, burps and boobs&quot;. Critics Jon Lewis and Penny Stempel have stated that the show &quot;allowed male viewers to indulge in vicarious laddism, whilst allowing female viewers to ridicule the bad but lovable Tony and Gary&quot;. They further commented that &quot;it was also a genuine sitcom in that the humour came from the characters and their context&quot;. Simon Nye remarked: &quot;I don&#x27;t do mad, plot-driven farragoes. You have to allow your characters time to talk.&quot;

&quot;Men Behaving Badly&quot; boosted the acting careers of all four of the main cast. The final episode in 1998 drew 13.9 million viewers. The show was criticised by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents for its portrayal of a &quot;lad&#x27;s culture of boozing and irresponsibility&quot;.

==Book and audio releases==
A companion guide to the show, &quot;The A–Z of Behaving Badly&quot; was released on 1 November 1995. It features many handy tips from Gary and Tony and was written by Simon Nye. On 27 July 2000, two audio compilations were released featuring eight shows from series three and four.

A script book entitled &quot;The Best of Men Behaving Badly&quot; was released on 5 October 2000. It contains 25 of the 42 scripts, along with some new material, black and white pictures, and introductions by Simon Nye.

==Home media==
All six series are available on region 2 DVD separately, and a complete collection featuring all six series is also available. The 1997 Christmas special and final trilogy &#x27;Last Orders!&#x27; are also available on DVD.

While the rest of the series was shot in 4:3, the 3 episodes making up &#x27;Last Orders!&#x27; are the only ones filmed in widescreen. However, the episodes are cropped for the DVD release. Owing to licensing difficulties, the music at the beginning of episode one &#x27;Hair&#x27; and the rave in episode five &#x27;Cardigan&#x27; had to be changed for the Series 5 DVD.

The entire series is also currently available on Netflix UK, featuring the original broadcast episodes now licensed by BBC Studios. The episode &quot;Jingle Balls!/The Big Christmas Box&quot; is listed as the 7th episode of Series 6 under the title &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;. &quot;Last Orders!&quot; is available to view in widescreen for the first time since broadcast.

==U.S. version==

The series was remade for American television, broadcast on NBC 1996–1997, and starred Rob Schneider, Ken Marino, Ron Eldard and Justine Bateman. The humour was not appreciated by US audiences and the remake was cancelled after two seasons. The original series was eventually screened in the US on BBC America as &quot;British Men Behaving Badly&quot;. In Australia, where the British version was screened under its original title on the ABC, the US series was broadcast as &quot;It&#x27;s a Man&#x27;s World&quot; on the Seven Network.

<doc id="181287" wikidata="Q462364" url="?curid=181287" title="Gustave Kahn">
<text>Gustave Kahn (21 December 1859, in Metz – 5 September 1936, in Paris) was a French Symbolist poet and art critic. He was also active, via publishing and essay-writing, in defining Symbolism and distinguishing it from the Decadent Movement.

==Personal life==

Kahn was a Jew from Lorraine. He chose sides with Émile Zola in the Dreyfus affair. His wife Elizabeth converted to Judaism as a protest against antisemitism, changing her name to Rachel.

==Poetry==
Kahn claimed to have invented the term vers libre, or free verse. He was in any case one of the form&#x27;s first European exponents. His principal publications include &quot;Les Palais nomades&quot; (1887), &quot;Domaine de fée&quot; (1895), and &quot;Le Livre d&#x27;images&quot; (1897). He also made a valuable contribution to the movement&#x27;s history with his book &quot;Symbolistes et décadents&quot; (1902).

==Other work==
In addition to his poems, Kahn was a public intellectual who wrote novels, plays, and literary criticism. He was also extremely influential as a publisher of symbolist writing. Together with Félix Fénéon and Leo d&#x27;Orfer, both critics, Kahn founded and then directed &quot;La Vogue&quot; in 1886. Through that magazine, Kahn and his partners were able to influence the careers of developing decadent writers such as Jules Laforgue, as well as to inject new life into the careers of established figures such as Arthur Rimbaud, whose &quot;Les Illuminations&quot; manuscript was published in its pages. Together with Jean Moréas, he also founded and directed &quot;Le Symboliste&quot;, a short-lived journal intended as a counter-point to Anatole Bajule&#x27;s &quot;Le Décadent&quot;, which they viewed as a false and exploitative publication that represented a vain, shallow mockery of symbolist thought. He played a key role in a number of other periodicals, including &quot;La Revue Indépendante&quot;, &quot;La Revue Blanche&quot; and &quot;Le Mercure de France&quot;.

He was also an art critic and collector who stayed current with developments in painting and sculpture until his death. He wrote a widely-read obituary for neo-impressionist painter Georges Seurat, in which he suggested a symbolist approach to interpreting the artist&#x27;s work.

He also played a role in a number of debates on public issues, including anarchism, feminism, socialism, and Zionism.
In the 1920s he was (head)editor of &quot; Menorah&quot;, a Jewish bimonthly magazine which folded in 1933.

In 1903, American composer Charles Loeffler set four of Kahn&#x27;s poems to music for piano and voice. The poems were from &quot;Les Palais Nomades&quot;: Timbres Oublies, Adieu Pour Jamais, Les Soirs d&#x27;Automne, and Les Paons.

After his death, his manuscripts were placed in the collection of the library of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

== Quotation ==
:::Les Paons

:Se penchant vers les dahlias,
:Des paons cabraient des rosaces lunaires,
:L&#x27;assouplissement des branches vénère
:Son pâle visage aux mourants dahlias.

: Elle écoute au loin les brèves musiques
: Nuit claire aux ramures d&#x27;accords,
: Et la lassitude a bercé son corps
: Au rythme odorant des pures musiques.

: Les paons ont dressé la rampe ocellée
: Pour la descente de ses yeux vers le tapis
: De choses et de sens
: Qui va vers l&#x27;horizon, parure vermiculée
: De son corps alangui.
: En l&#x27;âme se tapit
: le flou désir molli de récits et d&#x27;encens.

<doc id="181288" wikidata="Q3080926" url="?curid=181288" title="Karl Menninger">
<text>Karl Augustus Menninger (July 22, 1893 – July 18, 1990) was an American psychiatrist, author, and activist.

He was a member of the Menninger family of psychiatrists who founded the Menninger Foundation and the Menninger Clinic in Topeka, Kansas.

He wrote many books including &quot;The Human Mind&quot; (1930), &quot;Man Against Himself&quot; (1938), &quot;Love Against Hate&quot; (1942), &quot;The Vital Balance&quot; (1963) and &quot;The Crime of Punishment&quot; (1968).

During his life he advocated for a number of causes including children suffering from abuse or neglect, Native Americans, women&#x27;s rights, prisoners, the elderly, the environment, wildlife, and against nuclear weapons.

Despite being one of the most famous psychiatrists during his time, he was an outsider to mainstream psychiatry, calling the DSM-II a modern “Witches Hammer Manual”

==Early Life==
Menninger was born on July 22, 1893, in Topeka, Kansas, the son of Florence Vesta (Kinsley) and Charles Frederick Menninger. In addition to studying at Washburn University, Indiana University and the University of Wisconsin–Madison, he also studied medicine at Harvard Medical School. He graduated from the school &quot;cum laude&quot; in 1917. While at Washburn, he was a member of the Alpha Delta Fraternity, a local group. In 1960 he was inducted into the school&#x27;s Sagamore Honor Society.

==Work==
After his internship and his service as part of the Naval Reserve during World War I, Menninger worked at the Boston Psychopathic Hospital under Elmer Ernest Southard while also teaching neuropathology at Harvard Medical School. With the death of Southard in 1919, he returned to Topeka where, together with his father, he founded the Menninger Clinic. By 1925, they had attracted enough investors, including brother William C. Menninger, to build the Menninger Sanitarium. 

The Menninger Foundation was established in 1941. After World War II, Karl Menninger was instrumental in founding the Winter Veterans Administration Hospital, in Topeka. It became the largest psychiatric training center in the world. He was among the first members of the Society for General Systems Research.

In 1946 he founded the Menninger School of Psychiatry. He would serve as the dean until 1970. It was renamed in his honor in 1985 as the Karl Menninger School of Psychiatry and Mental Health Science. In 1952, Karl Targownik, who would become one of his closest friends, joined the Clinic.

From 1946 to 1962 he was a professor of psychiatry at University of Kansas City Medical School

==Views on Psychiatry and Psychology==
In 1930, he wrote his first book &quot;The Human Mind&quot;, where he argued that psychiatry was a science and that the mentally ill were only slightly different from healthy individuals.

In his 1963 book, The Vital Balance, he and his co-authors disagreed with diagnoses as they existed in psychiatry. While not going as far as saying mental illness is a myth, the book talked about mental disorganization as more generalized and more recoverable than was seen in mainstream psychiatry.

He was considered an outsider to mainstream psychiatry, for example calling the the 1968 DSM-II a modern “Witches Hammer Manual”.

=== Letter to Szasz ===
On October 6, 1988, less than two years before his death, Karl Menninger wrote a letter to Thomas Szasz, author of &quot;The Myth of Mental Illness&quot;. In the letter, Menninger said that he has just read Szasz&#x27;s book &quot;Insanity: The Idea and Its Consequences&quot;. Menninger wrote that neither of them liked the situation in which insanity separates men from men and free will is forgotten. After recounting the lack of scientific method in psychology over the years, Menninger expressed his regret that he did not come over to a dialogue with Szasz.

==Prison Reform==
Karl Menninger together with his brother Will had been activists for prison reform already for a while before publishing &quot;The Crime of Punishment&quot;. In the book and elsewhere Menninger argued that current prison system was based on vindictiveness and that correctional facilities did little &quot;correcting&quot; of behavior. He argued that crime was preventable and real rehabilitation possible through educational programs. He argues that crime was not a disease but an illness and that treatment should be pychiatric in nature. It&#x27;s important to remember that he was an outsider both to law and to psychology to understand the book&#x27;s reception.

==Activism for children==
In 1964 Topeka, Kansas, Karl Menninger founded The Villages, group homes for youth. Later in life he would spend a third of the year doing preventative psychiatry for the foster children.

==Criticisms==
While parts of his correspondence seem to describe him as sympathetic to Jewish refugees and Blacks, other facts add nuance. He favored a quota on Jewish refugees, and did nothing to alter segregation in the Menninger Foundation. 

He also called homosexuality an evil and a sin in a 1963 introduction to the american edition of the Wolfenden Report 

==Personal life==

Menninger married Grace Gaines in 1916, with whom he had three children: Martha, Julia and Robert. The couple divorced in February 1941. Menninger remarried on September 9, 1941, taking Jeanette Lyle as his wife. Together they adopted a daughter named Rosemary in 1948. 

He was a practicing Presbyterian as well as a Freemason

==Death==
He died of abdominal cancer July 18, 1990, four days before his 97th birthday. 

==Honors==
* Beginning in 1962, the American Psychiatric Association gave Menninger the Isaac Ray Award, then The First Distinguished Serive Award in 1965, and the First Founders Award in 1977. 
* In 1978 The American Medical Association gave Menninger the Sheen Award.
*In 1981, Menninger was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Jimmy Carter.
*In 1985, the Menninger School of Psychiatry was named for him.

<doc id="181289" wikidata="Q1812172" url="?curid=181289" title="Empty product">
<text>In mathematics, an empty product, or nullary product or vacuous product, is the result of multiplying no factors. It is by convention equal to the multiplicative identity (assuming there is an identity for the multiplication operation in question), just as the empty sum—the result of adding no numbers—is by convention zero, or the additive identity. When numbers are implied, the empty product becomes one.

The term &quot;empty product&quot; is most often used in the above sense when discussing arithmetic operations. However, the term is sometimes employed when discussing set-theoretic intersections, categorical products, and products in computer programming.

== Nullary arithmetic product ==
===Definition===

Let &quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2, &quot;a&quot;3, ... be a sequence of numbers, and let

:formula_1

be the product of the first &quot;m&quot; elements of the sequence. Then

:formula_2

for all &quot;m&quot; = 1, 2, ... provided that we use the convention formula_3. In other words, a &quot;product&quot; with no factors at all evaluates to 1.
Allowing a &quot;product&quot; with zero factors reduces the number of cases to be considered in many mathematical formulas. Such a &quot;product&quot; is a natural starting point in induction proofs, as well as in algorithms. For these reasons, the &quot;empty product is one&quot; convention is common practice in mathematics and computer programming.

=== Relevance of defining empty products ===
The notion of an empty product is useful for the same reason that the number zero and the empty set are useful: while they seem to represent quite uninteresting notions, their existence allows for a much shorter mathematical presentation of many subjects.

For example, the empty products 0! = 1 (the factorial of zero) and &quot;x&quot;0 = 1 shorten Taylor series notation (see zero to the power of zero for a discussion of when &quot;x&quot; = 0). Likewise, if &quot;M&quot; is an &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrix, then &quot;M&quot;0 is the &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; identity matrix, reflecting the fact that applying a linear map zero times has the same effect as applying the identity map.

As another example, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic says that every positive integer greater than 1 can be written uniquely as a product of primes. However, if we do not allow products with only 0 or 1 factors, then the theorem (and its proof) become longer.

More examples of the use of the empty product in mathematics may be found in the binomial theorem (which assumes and implies that &quot;x&quot;0 = 1 for all &quot;x&quot;), Stirling number, König&#x27;s theorem, binomial type, binomial series, difference operator and Pochhammer symbol.

===Logarithms and exponentials===

Since logarithms map products to sums:

: formula_4

they map an empty product to an empty sum.

Conversely, the exponential function maps sums into products:

: formula_5

and maps an empty sum to an empty product.

== Nullary Cartesian product ==
Consider the general definition of the Cartesian product:

:formula_6

If &quot;I&quot; is empty, the only such &quot;g&quot; is the empty function formula_7, which is the unique subset of formula_8 that is a function formula_9, namely the empty subset formula_10 (the only subset that formula_11 has):

:formula_12

Thus, the cardinality of the Cartesian product of no sets is 1.

Under the perhaps more familiar &quot;n&quot;-tuple interpretation,

:formula_13

that is, the singleton set containing the empty tuple. Note that in both representations the empty product has cardinality 1 – the number of all ways to produce 0 outputs from 0 inputs is 1.

== Nullary categorical product ==
In any category, the product of an empty family is a terminal object of that category. This can be demonstrated by using the limit definition of the product. An &quot;n&quot;-fold categorical product can be defined as the limit with respect to a diagram given by the discrete category with &quot;n&quot; objects. An empty product is then given by the limit with respect to the empty category, which is the terminal object of the category if it exists. This definition specializes to give results as above. For example, in the category of sets the categorical product is the usual Cartesian product, and the terminal object is a singleton set. In the category of groups the categorical product is the Cartesian product of groups, and the terminal object is a trivial group with one element. To obtain the usual arithmetic definition of the empty product we must take the decategorification of the empty product in the category of finite sets.

Dually, the coproduct of an empty family is an initial object.
Nullary categorical products or coproducts may not exist in a given category; e.g. in the category of fields, neither exists.

== In logic ==
Classical logic defines the operation of conjunction, which is generalized to universal quantification in predicate calculus, and is widely known as logical multiplication because we intuitively identify true with 1 and false with 0 and our conjunction behaves as ordinary multiplier. Multipliers can have arbitrary number of inputs. In case of 0 inputs, we have empty conjunction, which is identically equal to true.

This is related to another concept in logic, vacuous truth, which tells us that empty set of objects can have any property. It can be explained the way that the conjunction (as part of logic in general) deals with values less or equal 1. This means that the longer the conjunction, the higher the probability of ending up with 0. Conjunction merely checks the propositions and returns 0 (or false) as soon as one of propositions evaluates to false. Reducing the number of conjoined propositions increases the chance to pass the check and stay with 1. Particularly, if there are 0 tests or members to check, none can fail, so by default we must always succeed regardless of which propositions or member properties were to be tested.

== In computer programming ==
Many programming languages, such as Python, allow the direct expression of lists of numbers, and even functions that allow an arbitrary number of parameters. If such a language has a function that returns the product of all the numbers in a list, it usually works like this:

»&gt; math.prod([2, 3, 5])
30
»&gt; math.prod([2, 3])
6
»&gt; math.prod([2])
2
»&gt; math.prod([])
1

(Please note: codice_1 is not available in the codice_2 module prior to version 3.8.)

This convention helps avoid having to code special cases like &quot;if length of list is 1&quot; or &quot;if length of list is zero.&quot;

Multiplication is an infix operator and therefore a binary operator, complicating the notation of an empty product. Some programming languages handle this by implementing variadic functions. For example, the fully parenthesized prefix notation of Lisp languages gives rise to a natural notation for nullary functions:

 (* 2 2 2) ; evaluates to 8
 (* 2 2) ; evaluates to 4
 (* 2) ; evaluates to 2
 (*) ; evaluates to 1

<doc id="181293" wikidata="Q8137" url="?curid=181293" title="Capital (economics)">
<text>In economics, capital goods or capital are &quot;those durable produced goods that are in turn used as productive inputs for further production&quot; of goods and services. A typical example is the machinery used in a factory. At the macroeconomic level, &quot;the nation&#x27;s capital stock includes buildings, equipment, software, and inventories during a given year.&quot;

The means of production is as a &quot;...series of heterogeneous commodities, each having specific technical characteristics ...&quot; in the form of a durable good that is used in the production of goods or services. Capital goods are a particular form of economic good and are tangible property. Capital goods are one of the three types of intermediate goods used in the production process, the other two being land and labour. The three are also known collectively as &quot;primary factors of production&quot;. This classification originated during the classical economics period and has remained the dominant method for classification.

Capital can be increased by the use of the a production process (see production function and factors of production). Outputs of the production process are normally classified as capital goods, durable goods, and consumer goods. Durable goods are differentiated from capital goods by virtue of the fact that they are long lived personal property not used in the production of marketable goods, e.g personal homes and personal automobiles are not used in the production of marketable goods and services.

In Marxian critique of political economy, capital is viewed as a social relation. Critical analysis of the economists portrayal of the capitalist mode of production as a transhistorical state of affairs distinguishes different forms of capital:
* constant capital, which refers to capital goods
* variable capital, which refers to labor-inputs, where the cost is &quot;variable&quot; based on the amount of wages and salaries paid during an employee&#x27;s contract/employment,
* fictitious capital, which refers to intangible representations or abstractions of physical capital, such as stocks, bonds and securities (or &quot;tradable paper claims to wealth&quot;)

Adam Smith defined capital as &quot;that part of man&#x27;s stock which he expects to afford him revenue&quot;. In economic models, capital is an input in the production function. The total physical capital at any given moment in time is referred to as the capital stock (not to be confused with the capital stock of a business entity). Capital goods, real capital, or capital assets are already-produced, durable goods or any non-financial asset that is used in production of goods or services.

==In narrow and broad uses==
Classical and neoclassical economics describe capital as one of the factors of production (alongside the other factors: land and labour). All other inputs to production are called intangibles in classical economics. This includes organization, entrepreneurship, knowledge, goodwill, or management (which some characterize as talent, social capital or instructional capital).

Many definitions and descriptions of capital goods production have been proposed in the literature. Capital goods are generally considered one-of-a-kind, capital intensive products that consist of many components. They are often used as manufacturing systems or services themselves. Examples include hand tools, machine tools, data centers, oil rigs, semiconductor fabrication plants, and wind turbines. Their production is often organized in projects, with several parties cooperating in networks.

This is what makes it a factor of production:
* The good is not used up immediately in the process of production unlike raw materials or intermediate goods. (The significant exception to this is depreciation allowance, which like intermediate goods, is treated as a business expense.)
* The good can be produced or increased (in contrast to land and non-renewable resources).

These distinctions of convenience have carried over to contemporary economic theory. Adam Smith provided the further clarification that capital is a stock. As such, its value can be estimated at a point in time. By contrast, investment, as production to be added to the capital stock, is described as taking place over time (&quot;per year&quot;), thus a flow.

Earlier illustrations often described capital as physical items, such as tools, buildings, and vehicles that are used in the production process. Since at least the 1960s economists have increasingly focused on broader forms of capital. For example, investment in skills and education can be viewed as building up human capital or knowledge capital, and investments in intellectual property can be viewed as building up intellectual capital. Natural capital is the world&#x27;s stock of natural resources, which includes geology, soils, air, water and all living organisms. These terms lead to certain questions and controversies discussed in those articles.

A capital good lifecycle typically consists of tendering, engineering and procurement, manufacturing, commissioning, maintenance, and (sometimes) decommissioning.

Capital goods are a major factor in the process of technical innovation: 
Capital goods are a constituent element of the stock of capital assets, or fixed capital and play a key role in the economic analysis of &quot;... growth and production, as well as the distribution of income...&quot;

=== Immaterial capital goods ===

Capital goods can also be immaterial, when they take the form of intellectual property. Many production processes require the intellectual property to (legally) produce their products. Just like material capital goods, they can require substantial investment, and can also be subject to amortization, depreciation, and divestment.

=== Differences from consumer goods ===
People buy capital goods to use as static resources to make other goods, whereas consumer goods are purchased to be consumed.

For example, an automobile is a consumer good when purchased as a private car.

Dump trucks used in manufacturing or construction are capital goods because companies use them to build things like roads, dams, buildings, and bridges.

In the same way, a chocolate bar is a consumer good, but the machines that produce the candy are capital goods.

Some capital goods can be used in both production of consumer goods or production goods, such as machinery for the production of dump trucks.

Consumption is the logical result of all economic activity, but the level of future consumption depends on the future capital stock, and this in turn depends on the current level of production in the capital-goods sector. Hence if there is a desire to increase consumption, the output of the capital goods should be maximized.

=== Importance ===
Capital goods, often called complex products and systems (CoPS), play an important role in today&#x27;s economy. Aside from allowing a business to create goods or provide services for consumers, capital goods are important in other ways. In an industry where production equipment and materials are quite expensive, they can be a high barrier to entry for new companies. If a new business cannot afford to purchase the machines it needs to create a product, for example, it may not be able to compete as effectively in the market. Such a company might turn to another business to supply its products, but this can be expensive as well. This means that, in industries where the means of production represent a large amount of a business&#x27;s start-up costs, the number of companies competing in the market is often relatively small.

=== Investment required ===
The acquisition of machinery and other expensive equipment often represents a significant investment for a company. When a business is struggling, it often puts off such purchases as long as possible, since it does not make sense to spend money on equipment if the company is not around to use it. Capital spending can be a sign that a manufacturer expects growth or at least a steady demand for its products, a potentially positive economic sign. 
In most cases, capital goods require a substantial investment on behalf of the producer, and their purchase is usually referred to as a capital expense. These goods are important to businesses because they use these items to make functional goods for customers or to provide consumers with valuable services. As a result, they are sometimes referred to as producers&#x27; goods, production goods, or means of production.

=== In international trade ===
In the theory of international trade, the causes and nature of the trade of capital goods receive little attention. Trade-in capital goods is a crucial part of the dynamic relationship between international trade and development. The production and trade of capital goods, as well as consumer goods, must be introduced to trade models, and the entire analysis integrated with domestic capital accumulation theory.

== Modern types of capital ==

Detailed classifications of capital that have been used in various theoretical or applied uses generally respect the following division:
* Financial capital, which represents obligations, and is liquidated as money for trade, and owned by legal entities. It is in the form of capital assets, traded in financial markets. Its market value is not based on the historical accumulation of money invested but on the perception by the market of its expected revenues and of the risk entailed.
* Social capital, which in private enterprise is partly captured as goodwill or brand value, but is a more general concept of inter-relationships between human beings having money-like value that motivates actions in a similar fashion to paid compensation.
* Instructional capital, defined originally in academia as that aspect of teaching and knowledge transfer that is not inherent in individuals or social relationships but transferable. Various theories use names like knowledge or intellectual capital to describe similar concepts but these are not strictly defined as in the academic definition and have no widely agreed accounting treatment.
* Human capital, a broad term that generally includes social, instructional and individual human talent in combination. It is used in technical economics to define &quot;balanced growth&quot;, which is the goal of improving human capital as much as economic capital.
* Public capital is a blanket term that attempts to characterize physical capital that is considered infrastructure and which supports production in unclear or poorly accounted ways. This encompasses the aggregate body of all government-owned assets that are used to promote private industry productivity, including highways, railways, airports, water treatment facilities, telecommunications, electric grids, energy utilities, municipal buildings, public hospitals and schools, police, fire protection, courts and still others. However, it is a problematic term insofar as many of these assets can be either publicly or privately owned.
* Natural or ecological capital is the world&#x27;s stock of natural resources, which includes geology, soils, air, water and all living organisms. Some natural capital assets provide people with free goods and services, often called ecosystem services. Two of these (clean water and fertile soil) underpin our economy and society and make human life possible.

Separate literatures have developed to describe both natural capital and social capital. Such terms reflect a wide consensus that nature and society both function in such a similar manner as traditional industrial infrastructural capital, that it is entirely appropriate to refer to them as different types of capital in themselves. In particular, they can be used in the production of other goods, are not used up immediately in the process of production, and can be enhanced (if not created) by human effort.

There is also a literature of intellectual capital and intellectual property law. However, this increasingly distinguishes means of capital investment, and collection of potential rewards for patent, copyright (creative or individual capital), and trademark (social trust or social capital) instruments.

Building on Marx, and on the theories of the sociologist and philosopher Pierre Bourdieu, scholars have recently argued for the significance of &quot;culinary capital&quot; in the arena of food. The idea is that the production, consumption, and distribution of knowledge about food can confer power and status.

==Interpretations==

Within classical economics, Adam Smith (&quot;Wealth of Nations&quot;, Book II, Chapter 1) distinguished fixed capital from circulating capital. The former designated physical assets not consumed in the production of a product (e.g., machines and storage facilities), while the latter referred to physical assets consumed in the process of production (e.g., raw materials and intermediate products). For an enterprise, both were types of capital.

Economist Henry George argued that financial instruments like stocks, bonds, mortgages, promissory notes, or other certificates for transferring wealth is not really capital, because &quot;Their economic value merely represents the power of one class to appropriate the earnings of another&quot; and &quot;their increase or decrease does not affect the sum of wealth in the community&quot;.

Some thinkers, such as Werner Sombart and Max Weber, locate the concept of capital as originating in double-entry bookkeeping, which is thus a foundational innovation in capitalism, Sombart writing in &quot;Medieval and Modern Commercial Enterprise&quot; that:
:The very concept of capital is derived from this way of looking at things; one can say that capital, as a category, did not exist before double-entry bookkeeping. Capital can be defined as that amount of wealth which is used in making profits and which enters into the accounts.

Karl Marx adds a distinction that is often confused with David Ricardo&#x27;s. In Marxian theory, variable capital refers to a capitalist&#x27;s investment in labor-power, seen as the only source of surplus-value. It is called &quot;variable&quot; since the amount of value it can produce varies from the amount it consumes, &quot;i.e.&quot;, it creates new value. On the other hand, constant capital refers to investment in non-human factors of production, such as plant and machinery, which Marx takes to contribute only its own replacement value to the commodities it is used to produce.

Investment or capital accumulation, in classical economic theory, is the production of increased capital. Investment requires that some goods be produced that are not immediately consumed, but instead used to produce other goods as capital goods. Investment is closely related to saving, though it is not the same. As Keynes pointed out, saving involves not spending all of one&#x27;s income on current goods or services, while investment refers to spending on a specific type of goods, &quot;i.e.&quot;, capital goods.

Austrian School economist Eugen Boehm von Bawerk maintained that capital intensity was measured by the roundaboutness of production processes. Since capital is defined by him as being goods of higher-order, or goods used to produce consumer goods, and derived their value from them, being future goods.

Human development theory describes human capital as being composed of distinct social, imitative and creative elements:
* Social capital is the value of network trusting relationships between individuals in an economy.
* Individual capital, which is inherent in persons, protected by societies, and trades labour for trust or money. Close parallel concepts are &quot;talent&quot;, &quot;ingenuity&quot;, &quot;leadership&quot;, &quot;trained bodies&quot;, or &quot;innate skills&quot; that cannot reliably be reproduced by using any combination of any of the others above. In traditional economic analysis individual capital is more usually called &quot;labour&quot;.
* Instructional capital in the academic sense is clearly separate from either individual persons or social bonds between them.
This theory is the basis of triple bottom line accounting and is further developed in ecological economics, welfare economics and the various theories of green economics. All of which use a particularly abstract notion of capital in which the requirement of capital being produced like durable goods is effectively removed.

The Cambridge capital controversy was a dispute between economists at Cambridge, Massachusetts based MIT and University of Cambridge in the UK about the measurement of capital. The Cambridge, UK economists, including Joan Robinson and Piero Sraffa claimed that there is no basis for aggregating the heterogeneous objects that constitute &#x27;capital goods.&#x27;

Political economists Jonathan Nitzan and Shimshon Bichler have suggested that capital is not a productive entity, but solely financial and that capital values measure the relative power of owners over the broad social processes that bear on profits.

<doc id="181296" wikidata="Q875556" url="?curid=181296" title="Israelis">
<text>Israelis (; ) are the citizens and nationals of the State of Israel. The country&#x27;s populace is composed primarily of Jews and Arabs, who respectively account for 75 percent and 20 percent of the national figure, followed by other ethnic and religious minorities, who account for 5 percent.

Early Israeli culture was largely defined by communities of the Jewish diaspora who had made &quot;aliyah&quot; to British Palestine from Europe, Western Asia, and North Africa in the late-19th and early-20th centuries. Later Jewish immigration from Ethiopia, the post-Soviet states, and the Americas introduced new cultural elements to Israeli society and have had a profound impact on modern Israeli culture.

Since Israel&#x27;s independence in 1948, Israelis and people of Israeli descent have had a considerable diaspora, which largely overlaps with the Jewish diaspora but also with that of other ethnic and religious groups; it is estimated that almost 10 percent of the general Israeli population lives abroad, particularly in Russia (with Moscow housing the single largest Israeli community outside of Israel), India, Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, and throughout Europe.

==Population==

As of 2013, Israel&#x27;s population is 8 million, of which the Israeli civil government records 75.3% as Jews, 20.7% as non-Jewish Arabs, and 4.0% other. Israel&#x27;s official census includes Israeli settlers in the occupied territories (referred to as &quot;disputed&quot; by Israel). 280,000 Israeli settlers live in settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, 190,000 in East Jerusalem, and 20,000 in the Golan Heights.

Among Jews, 70.3% were born in Israel (&quot;sabras&quot;), mostly from the second or third generation of their family in the country, and the rest are Jewish immigrants. Of the Jewish immigrants, 20.5% were from Europe and the Americas, and 9.2% were from Asia, Africa, and Middle Eastern countries. Nearly half of all Israeli Jews are descended from immigrants from the European Jewish diaspora. Approximately the same number are descended from immigrants from Arab countries, Iran, Turkey and Central Asia. Over 200,000 are of Ethiopian and Indian-Jewish descent.

The official Israel Central Bureau of Statistics estimate of the Israeli Jewish population does not include those Israeli citizens, mostly descended from immigrants from the Soviet Union, who are registered as &quot;others&quot;, or their immediate family members. Defined as non-Jews and non-Arabs, they make up about 3.5% of Israelis (350,000), and were eligible for Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return.

Israel&#x27;s official language is Hebrew, which serves as the language of government and is spoken by the majority of the population. Arabic is spoken by the Arab minority and by some members of the Mizrahi Jewish community. English is studied in school and is spoken by the majority of the population as a second language. Other languages spoken in Israel include Russian, Yiddish, Spanish, Ladino, Amharic, Armenian, Romanian, and French.

In recent decades, between 650,000 and 1,300,000 Israelis have emigrated, a phenomenon known in Hebrew as &quot;yerida&quot; (&quot;descent&quot;, in contrast to &quot;aliyah&quot;, which means &quot;ascent&quot;). Emigrants have various reasons for leaving, but there is generally a combination of economic and political concerns.

==Ethnic and religious groups==

The main Israeli ethnic and religious groups are as follows:

===Jews===


Among the Israeli-born Jewish population, most are descended from Ashkenazi Jews, Mizrahi Jews, Sephardic Jews, Ethiopian Jews, and other Jewish ethnic divisions. Due to the historically large Mizrahi population and decades of ethnic intermixing, over 50% of Israel&#x27;s current Jewish population is of at least partial Mizrahi descent.

The CBS traces the paternal country of origin of Israeli Jews as of 2010 is as follows.

===Arabic-speaking minorities===
====Arab Palestinians====
A large part of Mandate-period Arab Palestinians remained within Israel&#x27;s borders following the 1948 exodus and are the largest group of Arabic-speaking and culturally Arab citizens of Israel. The vast majority of the Arab citizens of Israel are Sunni Muslim, while 9% of them are Christian, and 7.1% of them are Druze.

As of 2013, the Arab population of Israel amounts to 1,658,000, about 20.7% of the population. This figure include 209,000 Arabs (14% of the Israeli Arab population) in East Jerusalem, also counted in the Palestinian statistics, although 98 percent of East Jerusalem Palestinians have either Israeli residency or Israeli citizenship.

According to the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics census in 2010, the Arab population in Israel lives in 134 Arabic towns and villages; around 44% of them live in towns, while 48% of them in villages with the status of Local council, and around 4% live in small villages that are part of Regional council. The Arab population in Israel is located in five main areas: Galilee (54.6% of total Israeli Arabs), Triangle (23.5% of total Israeli Arabs), Golan Heights, East Jerusalem, and Northern Negev (13.5% of total Israeli Arabs). Around 8.4% of Israeli Arabs live in officially mixed Jewish-Arab cities (excluding Arab residents in East Jerusalem), in Haifa, Lod, Ramle, Jaffa-Tel Aviv, Acre, Nof HaGalil, and Ma&#x27;alot Tarshiha.

====Negev Bedouin====
The Arab citizens of Israel also include the Bedouin. Israeli Bedouin include those who live in the north of the country, for the most part in villages and towns, and the Bedouin in the Negev, who are semi-nomadic or live in towns or unrecognized Bedouin villages. In 1999, 110,000 Bedouin lived in the Negev, 50,000 in the Galilee and 10,000 in the central region of Israel. As of 2013, the Negev Bedouin number 200,000–210,000.

====Druze====

There is also a significant population of Israeli Druze, estimated at 117,500 at the end of 2006. All Druze in British Mandate Palestine became Israeli citizens upon the foundation of the State of Israel.

====Maronites====

There are about 7,000 Maronite Christian Israelis, living mostly in the Galilee but also in Haifa, Nazareth, and Jerusalem. They are mostly pro-Israeli Lebanese former militia members and their families who fled Lebanon after the 2000 withdrawal of IDF from South Lebanon. Some, however, are from local Galilean communities such as Jish.

====Copts====
There are about 1,000 Coptic Israeli citizens.

====Arameans====

In September 2014, Israel recognized the &quot;Aramean&quot; ethnic identity of hundreds of the Christian citizens of Israel. This recognition comes after about seven years of activity by the Aramean Christian Foundation in Israel – Aram, led by IDF Major Shadi Khalloul Risho and the Israeli Christian Recruitment Forum, headed by Father Gabriel Naddaf of the Greek-Orthodox Church and Major Ihab Shlayan. The Aramean ethnic identity encompasses all the Christian Eastern Syriac churches in Israel, including the Maronite Church, Greek Orthodox Church, Greek Catholic Church, Syriac Catholic Church and Syriac Orthodox Church. Many Israelis who advocated for and identify as Aramean today are Maronites, with Assyrians identifying as well.

====Assyrians====

There are around 1,000 Assyrians living in Israel, mostly in Jerusalem and Nazareth. Assyrians are an Aramaic-speaking, Eastern Rite Christian minority who are descended from the ancient Mesopotamians. The old Syriac Orthodox monastery of Saint Mark lies in Jerusalem. Other than followers of the Syriac Orthodox Church, there are also followers of the Assyrian Church of the East and the Chaldean Catholic Church living in Israel.

===Other citizens===

====African Hebrew Israelites====

The African Hebrew Israelite Nation of Jerusalem is a small religious community whose members believe they are descended from the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel. Most of the over 5,000 members live in Dimona, Israel although there are additional, smaller, groups in Arad, Mitzpe Ramon, and the Tiberias area. At least some of them consider themselves to be Jewish, but Israeli authorities do not accept them as such, nor are their religious practices consistent with &quot;mainstream Jewish tradition.&quot; The group, which consists of African Americans and their descendants, originated in Chicago in the early 1960s, moved to Liberia for a few years, and then immigrated to Israel.

====Armenians====

There are about 4,000–10,000 Armenian citizens of Israel (not including Armenian Jews). They live mostly in Jerusalem, including the Armenian Quarter, but also in Tel Aviv, Haifa and Jaffa. Their religious activities center around the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem as well as churches in Jerusalem, Haifa and Jaffa. Although Armenians of Old Jerusalem have Israeli identity cards, they are officially holders of Jordanian passports.

====Caucasians====
A number of immigrants also belong to various non-Slavic ethnic groups from the Former Soviet Union such as Tatars, Armenians, and Georgians.

====Circassians====

In Israel, there are also a few thousand Circassians, living mostly in Kfar Kama (2,000) and Reyhaniye (1,000). These two villages were a part of a greater group of Circassian villages around the Golan Heights. The Circassians in Israel enjoy, like Druzes, a &quot;status aparte&quot;. Male Circassians (at their leader&#x27;s request) are mandated for military service, while females are not.

====East Europeans====
Non-Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union most of whom are Zera Yisrael (descendants of Jews) who are Russians, Ukrainians, Moldovans and Belarusians, who were eligible to immigrate due to having, or being married to somebody who has, at least one Jewish grandparent. In addition, a certain number of former Soviet citizens, primarily women of Russian and Ukrainian ethnicity, immigrated to Israel after marrying Arab citizens of Israel who went to study in the former Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. The total number of those primarily of Slavic ancestry among Israeli citizens is around 300,000.

====Finns====
Although most Finns in Israel are either Finnish Jews or their descendants, a small number of Finnish Christians moved to Israel in the 1940s before the independence of the state and have since gained citizenship. For the most part the original Finnish settlers intermarried with other Israeli communities, and therefore remain very small in number. A &quot;moshav&quot; near Jerusalem named &quot;Yad HaShmona&quot;, meaning the Memorial for the eight, was established in 1971 by a group of Finnish Christian Israelis, though today most members are Israeli, and predominantly Hebrew-speaking.

====Samaritans====

The Samaritans are an ethnoreligious group of the Levant. Ancestrally, they are descended from a group of Israelite inhabitants who have connections to ancient Samaria from the beginning of the Babylonian captivity up to the beginning of the Common Era. Population estimates made in 2007 show that of the 712 Samaritans, half live in Holon in Israel and half at Mount Gerizim in the West Bank. The Holon community holds Israeli citizenship, while the Gerizim community resides at an Israeli-controlled enclave (Kiryat Luza), holding dual Israeli-Palestinian citizenship.

====Vietnamese====

The number of Vietnamese people in Israel is estimated at 200–400. Most of them came to Israel between 1976 and 1979, after the Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin granted them political asylum. The Vietnamese people living in Israel are Israeli citizens who also serve in the Israel Defense Forces. Today, the majority of the community lives in the Gush Dan area in the center of Israel but also a few dozen Vietnamese-Israelis or Israelis of Vietnamese origin live in Haifa, Jerusalem and Ofakim.

===Non-citizens===

====African refugees====
 
The number and status of African refugees in Israel is disputed and controversial, but it is estimated that at least 16,000 refugees, mainly from Eritrea, Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia and the Ivory Coast, reside and work in Israel. A check in late 2011, published in Ynet reported that the number just in Tel Aviv is 40,000, which represents 10 percent of the city&#x27;s population. The vast majority lives in the southern parts of the city. There is also a significant African population in the southern Israeli cities of Eilat, Arad and Beer Sheva.

====Other refugees====
Approximately 100–200 refugees from Bosnia, Kosovo, and North Korea live in Israel as refugees, most of them with Israeli resident status.

===Israeli diaspora===

Through the years, the majority of Israelis who emigrated from Israel went to the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.

It is currently estimated that there are 330,000 native-born Israelis, including 230,000 Jews, living abroad, or even more. The number of immigrants to Israel who later returned to their home countries or moved elsewhere is more difficult to calculate.

For many years definitive data on Israeli emigration was unavailable. In &quot;The Israeli Diaspora&quot; sociologist Stephen J. Gold maintains that calculation of Jewish emigration has been a contentious issue, explaining, &quot;Since Zionism, the philosophy that underlies the existence of the Jewish state, calls for return home of the world&#x27;s Jews, the opposite movement – Israelis leaving the Jewish state to reside elsewhere – clearly presents an ideological and demographic problem.&quot;

Among the most common reasons for emigration of Israelis from Israel are most often due to Israel&#x27;s ongoing security issues, economic constraints, economic characteristics, disappointment in the Israeli government, as well as the excessive role of religion in the lives of Israelis.

====United States====

Many Israelis immigrated to the United States throughout the period of the declaration of the state of Israel and until today. Today, the descendants of these people are known as Israeli-Americans. According to the 2000 United States Census, 106,839 Americans also hold Israeli citizenship, but the number of Americans of Israeli descent is around half a million.

==== Russia ====
Moscow has the largest single Israeli expatriate community in the world, with 80,000 Israeli citizens living in the city as of 2014, almost all of them native Russian-speakers. Many Israeli cultural events are hosted for the community, and many live part of the year in Israel. (To cater to the Israeli community, Israeli cultural centres are located in Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk and Yekaterinburg.)

====Canada====

Many Israelis immigrated to Canada throughout the period of the declaration of the state of Israel and until today. Today, the descendants of these people are known as Israeli-Canadians. According to the Canada 2006 Census as many as 21,320 Israelis lived in Canada in 2006.

====United Kingdom====

Many Israelis immigrated to the United Kingdom throughout and since the period of the declaration of the state of Israel. Today, the descendants of these people are known as Israeli-British. According to the United Kingdom 2001 Census, as many as 11,892 Israelis lived in the United Kingdom in 2001. The majority live in London.

===2013 Supreme Court ruling on nationality===
In 2013 a three-judge panel of the Supreme Court of Israel&#x27;s headed by Court President Asher Grunis rejected an appeal requesting that state-issued identification cards state the nationality of citizens as &quot;Israeli&quot; rather than their religion of origin. In his opinion, Grunis stated that it was not within the court&#x27;s purview to determine new categories of ethnicity or nationhood. The court&#x27;s decision responded to a petition by Uzzi Ornan, who refused to be identified as Jewish in 1948 at the foundation of the state of Israel, claiming instead that he was &quot;Hebrew.&quot; This was permitted by Israeli authorities at the time. However, by 2000, Ornan wanted to register his nationality as &quot;Israeli&quot;. The Interior Ministry refused to allow this, prompting Ornan to file a suit. In 2007, Ornan&#x27;s suit was joined by former minister Shulamit Aloni and other activists. In the ruling, Justice Hanan Melcer noted Israel currently considers &quot;citizenship and nationality [to be] separate.&quot;

==History==

The term &quot;Israelite&quot; refers to members of the Jewish tribes and polities of the Iron Age known from the Hebrew Bible and extra-biblical historical and archaeological sources. The term &quot;Israeli&quot;, by contrast, refers to the citizens of the modern State of Israel, regardless of them being Jewish, Arabs, or of any other ethnicity.

The modern State of Israel revived an old name known from the Hebrew Bible and from historical sources, that of the Iron Age Kingdom of Israel. The Bible differentiates between a period of tribal rule among the &quot;children of Israel&quot;; a Kingdom of Israel uniting all twelve biblical Israelite tribes, with the common capital known as the City of David (Jerusalem); and a period in which the northern tribes split away to form an independent Kingdom of Israel, while the southern tribes became part of the Kingdom of Judah. Archaeological research only partially agrees with the biblical narrative.

According to the biblical account, the United Monarchy was formed when there was a large popular expression in favour of introducing a monarchy to rule over the previously decentralised Israelite tribal confederacy. Increasing pressure from the Philistines and other neighboring tribes is said by the Bible to have forced the Israelites to unite as a more singular state.

The northern Kingdom of Israel was destroyed in by the Neo-Assyrian Empire and its population was forcibly restructured through imperial policy. The southern Kingdom of Judah was conquered by the Neo-Babylonian Empire (586 BCE), inherited by the Achaemenid Empire, conquered by Alexander the Great (332 BCE), ruled by the resulting Hellenistic empires, from which it regained authonomy and eventually independence under the Hasmoneans, conquered by the Roman Republic in 63 BCE, ruled by the client kings of the Herodian dynasty, and finally transformed into a Roman province during the first century CE. Two Jewish revolts, the second one ending in 135 CE, led to the large-scale decimation of the Jewish population in Judea and the end of any type of Jewish territorial self-rule in the southern Levant for many centuries to come.

Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire from 1516 until it was taken by British forces in 1918. The British establishment of colonial political boundaries allowed the Jews to develop autonomous institutions such as the Histadrut and the Knesset. The resulting influx of Jewish immigrants, as well as the creation of many new settlements, was crucial for the functioning of these new institutions in what would, on 14 May 1948, become the State of Israel. By 1960, 25% of Israelis were Holocaust survivors.

==Culture==
The largest cities in the country Haifa, Tel Aviv, and Jerusalem are also the major cultural centers, known for art museums, and many towns and kibbutzim have smaller high-quality museums. Israeli music is very versatile and combines elements of both western and eastern, religious and secular music. It tends to be very eclectic and contains a wide variety of influences from the Diaspora and more modern cultural importation: Hassidic songs, Asian and Arab pop, especially by Yemenite singers, and Israeli hip hop or heavy metal. Folk dancing, which draws upon the cultural heritage of many immigrant groups, is popular. There is also flourishing modern dance.

===Religion===

According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, at the end of 2014, 75% of Israelis were Jewish by religion (adherents of Judaism), 17.5% were Muslims, 2% Christian, 1.6% Druze and the remaining 3.9% (including immigrants) were not classified by religion.

Roughly 12% of Israeli Jews defined as &quot;haredim&quot; (ultra-orthodox religious); an additional 9% are &quot;religious&quot;; 35% consider themselves &quot;traditionalists&quot; (not strictly adhering to Jewish religious law); and 43% are &quot;secular&quot; (termed &quot;hiloni&quot;). Among the seculars, 53% believe in God. However, 78% of all Israelis (and virtually all Israeli Jews) participate in a Passover seder.

Unlike North American Jews, Israelis tend not to align themselves with a movement of Judaism (such as Reform Judaism or Conservative Judaism) but instead tend to define their religious affiliation by degree of their religious practice. Israeli religious life, unlike much of North American Jewish life, does not solely revolve around synagogues or religious community centers.

Among Arab Israelis, 82.6% were Muslim (including Ahmadis), 8.8% were Christian and 8.4% were Druze.

The Baháʼí World Centre, which includes the Universal House of Justice, in Haifa attracts Baháʼí pilgrims from all over the world.

==Languages==
Due to its immigrant nature, Israel is one of the most multicultural and multilingual societies in the world. Hebrew and Arabic are the official languages in the country, while English and Russian are the two most widely spoken non-official languages. Yiddish (2%) and French (2%) are also spoken. A certain degree of English is spoken widely, and is the language of choice for many Israeli businesses. Courses of Hebrew and English are mandatory in the Israeli matriculation exams (&quot;bagrut&quot;), and most schools also offer one or more out of Arabic, Spanish, German or French. The Israeli government also offers free intensive Hebrew-language courses, known as &quot;ulpanim&quot; (singular &quot;ulpan&quot;), for new Jewish immigrants, to try to help them integrate into Israeli society.

<doc id="181304" wikidata="Q1232635" url="?curid=181304" title="Edward III (play)">
<text>The Raigne of King Edward the Third, often shortened to Edward III, is an Elizabethan play printed anonymously in 1596, and at least partly written by William Shakespeare. It began to be included in publications of the complete works of Shakespeare only in the late 1990s. Scholars who have supported this attribution include Jonathan Bate, Edward Capell, Eliot Slater, Eric Sams, Giorgio Melchiori and Brian Vickers. The play&#x27;s co-author remains the subject of debate: suggestions have included Thomas Kyd, Christopher Marlowe, Michael Drayton, Thomas Nashe and George Peele.

The play contains several gibes at Scotland and the Scottish people, which has led some critics to suggest that it incited George Nicholson, Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s agent in Edinburgh, to protest against the portrayal of Scots on the London stage in a 1598 letter to William Cecil, Lord Burghley. This could explain why the play was not included in the First Folio of Shakespeare&#x27;s works, which was published after the Scottish King James had succeeded to the English throne in 1603.

The play also contains an explicit reference to its having been produced not only for the stage, but also for the page. In the final sequence, the Black Prince states: &quot;So that hereafter ages, &quot;when they read&quot; / The painful traffic of my tender youth, / Might thereby be inflamed” (scene 18).

==Synopsis==
King Edward III is informed by the Count of Artois that he, Edward, was the true heir to the previous king of France. A French ambassador arrives to insist that Edward do homage to the new French king for his lands in Guyenne. Edward defies him, insisting he will invade to enforce his rights. A messenger arrives to say that the Scots are besieging a castle in the north of England. Edward decides to deal with this problem first. The castle is being held by the beautiful Countess of Salisbury, the wife of the Earl of Salisbury. As Edward&#x27;s army arrives, the rampaging Scots flee. Edward immediately falls for the Countess, and proceeds to woo her for himself. She rebuffs him, but he persists. In an attempted bluff, the Countess vows to take the life of her husband if Edward will take the life of his wife. However, when she sees that Edward finds the plan morally acceptable, she ultimately threatens to take her own life if he does not stop his pursuit. Finally, Edward expresses great shame, admits his fault and acquiesces. He dedicates himself to use his energies to pursue his rights and duties as king.

In the second part of the play, Edward joins his army in France, fighting a war to claim the French throne. He and the French king exchange arguments for their claims before the Battle of Crécy. King Edward&#x27;s son, Edward, the Black Prince, is knighted and sent into battle. The king refuses to send help to his son when it appears that the young man&#x27;s life is in danger. Prince Edward proves himself in battle after defeating the king of Bohemia. The English win the battle and the French flee to Poitiers. Edward sends the prince to pursue them, while he besieges Calais.

In Poitiers the prince finds himself outnumbered and apparently surrounded. The play switches between the French and English camps, where the apparent hopelessness of the English campaign is contrasted with the arrogance of the French. Prince Edward broods on the morality of war before achieving victory in the Battle of Poitiers against seemingly insurmountable odds. He captures the French king.

In Calais the citizens realise they will have to surrender to King Edward. Edward demands that six of the leading citizens be sent out to face punishment. Edward&#x27;s wife, Queen Philippa, arrives and persuades him to pardon them. Sir John Copland brings Edward the king of the Scots, captured in battle, and a messenger informs Edward that the English have secured Brittany. However, the successes are undercut when news arrives that Prince Edward was facing certain defeat at Poitiers. King Edward declares he will take revenge. Prince Edward arrives with news of his victory, bringing with him the captured French king. The English enter Calais in triumph.

==Sources==
Like most of Shakespeare&#x27;s history plays, the source is Raphael Holinshed&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles&quot;, while Jean Froissart&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles&quot; is also a major source for this play. Roger Prior has argued that the playwright had access to Lord Hunsdon&#x27;s personal copy of Froissart and quoted some of Hunsdon&#x27;s annotations. A significant portion of the part usually attributed to Shakespeare, the wooing of the Countess of Salisbury, is based on the tale &quot;The Countesse of Salesberrie&quot; (no. 46) in the story-collection &quot;Palace of Pleasure&quot; by William Painter. Painter&#x27;s version of the story, derived from Froissart, portrays Edward as a bachelor and the Countess as a widow, and concludes with the couple marrying. Painter&#x27;s preface indicates that he knew that this was &quot;altogether untrue&quot;, since Edward had only one wife, &quot;the sayde vertuous Queene Philip&quot;, but reproduces Froissart&#x27;s version with all its &quot;defaults&quot;. The author of the play is aware that both were married at the time. Melchiori (p. 104) points out the similarity of the playwright&#x27;s language to that of Painter in spite of the plotting differences.

The play radically compresses the action and historical events, placing the Battle of Poitiers (1356) immediately after the Battle of Crecy (1346), and before the capture of Calais. In fact, Poitiers took place ten years after the earlier victory and capture of Calais. The compression necessitates that characters are merged. Thus the French king throughout the play is John II of France. In fact, Crecy had been fought against his predecessor, Philip VI of France. Many other characters are freely depicted at events when they could not have been present. William Montague, 1st Earl of Salisbury and John de Montfort were both dead even before Crecy. While Sir John Copland did capture the Scottish King David and bring him to Calais in 1346, shortly after Crecy, complete Anglo-Montfort victory in Brittany, alluded in the same scene, was not achieved until the Battle of Auray in 1364.

The author or authors of &quot;The Reign of King Edward III&quot; also used John Eliot’s 1591 translation of Bertrand de Loque’s &quot;Discourses of Warre and single Combat&quot; for inspiration and guidance.

==Authorship==

&quot;Edward III&quot; has only been accepted into the canon of plays written by Shakespeare since the 1990s. In 1596, it was published anonymously, which was common practice in the 1590s (the first Quarto editions of &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; and &quot;Richard III&quot; also appeared anonymously). Additionally, Elizabethan theatre often paid professional writers of the time to perform minor additions and emendations to problematic or overly brief scripts (the additions to the popular but brief &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; and Shakespeare&#x27;s own additions on the unperformed &quot;Sir Thomas More&quot; being some of the best known). No holographic manuscript of &quot;Edward III&quot; is extant.

The principal arguments against Shakespeare&#x27;s authorship are its non-inclusion in the &quot;First Folio&quot; of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays in 1623 and being unmentioned in Francis Meres&#x27;s &quot;Palladis Tamia&quot; (1598), a work that lists many (but not all) of Shakespeare&#x27;s early plays. Some critics view the play as not up to the quality of Shakespeare&#x27;s ability, and they attribute passages resembling his style to imitation or plagiarism. Despite this, many critics have seen some passages as having an authentic Shakespearean ring. In 1760, noted Shakespearean editor Edward Capell included the play in his &quot;Prolusions; or, Select Pieces of Ancient Poetry, Compil&#x27;d with great Care from their several Originals, and Offer&#x27;d to the Publicke as Specimens of the Integrity that should be Found in the Editions of worthy Authors&quot;, and concluded that it had been written by Shakespeare. However, Capell&#x27;s conclusion was, at the time, only supported by mostly German scholars.

In recent years, professional Shakespeare scholars have increasingly reviewed the work with a new eye, and have concluded that some passages are as sophisticated as any of Shakespeare&#x27;s early histories, especially &quot;King John&quot; and the &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays. In addition, passages in the play are direct quotes from Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets, most notably the line &quot;lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds&quot; (sonnet 94) and the phrase &quot;scarlet ornaments&quot;, used in sonnet 142.

Stylistic analysis has also produced evidence that at least some scenes were written by Shakespeare. In the &quot;Textual Companion&quot; to the &quot;Oxford Complete Works of Shakespeare&quot;, Gary Taylor states that &quot;of all the non-canonical plays, &quot;Edward III&quot; has the strongest claim to inclusion in the &quot;Complete Works&quot;&quot; (the play was subsequently edited by William Montgomery and included in the second edition of the &quot;Oxford Complete Works&quot;, 2005). The first major publishing house to produce an edition of the play was Yale University Press, in 1996; Cambridge University Press published an edition two years later as part of its New Cambridge Shakespeare series. Since then, an edition of the Riverside Shakespeare has included the play, as has the Arden Shakespeare in its Third Series (2017). The Oxford Shakespeare series has published an edition.

Giorgio Melchiori, editor of the New Cambridge edition, asserts that the play&#x27;s disappearance from the canon is probably due to a 1598 protest at the play&#x27;s portrayal of the Scottish. According to Melchiori, scholars have often assumed that this play, the title of which was not stated in the letter of 15 April 1598 from George Nicolson (Elizabeth I&#x27;s Edinburgh agent) to Lord Burghley noting the public unrest, was a comedy (one that does not survive), but the play&#x27;s portrayal of Scots is so virulent that it is likely that the play was banned—officially or unofficially—and left forgotten by Heminges and Condell.

The events and monarchs in the play would, along with the two history tetralogies and &quot;Henry VIII&quot;, extend Shakespeare&#x27;s chronicle to include all the monarchs from Edward III to Shakespeare&#x27;s near-contemporary Henry VIII. Some scholars, notably Eric Sams, have argued that the play is &quot;entirely&quot; by Shakespeare, but today, scholarly opinion is divided, with many researchers asserting that the play is an early collaborative work, of which Shakespeare wrote only a few scenes.

In 2009, Brian Vickers published the results of a computer analysis using a program designed to detect plagiarism, which suggests that 40% of the play was written by Shakespeare with the other scenes written by Thomas Kyd (1558–1594). John Jowett and Richard Proudfoot and Nicola Bennett, while not rejecting the possibility of Kyd&#x27;s authorship, find that the evidence is insufficient. Citing Jowett&#x27;s &quot;Shakespeare and the Text&quot;, Proudfoot and Bennett identify multiple assumptions made in the attribution, crediting the first three to Jowett: that Kyd&#x27;s known oeuvre (consisting of only &quot;The Spanish Tragedy&quot;, &quot;Soliman and Perseda&quot;, and an English translation of French playwright Robert Garnier&#x27;s &quot;Cornélie&quot;) is a sufficient body of evidence for comparison, that &quot;rarity&quot; of n-gram patterns is definable and doubtlessly characteristic, and that scenes within collaborative plays are always by one author acting alone. Proudfoot and Bennett add to these that selection bias prejudges outcome, making the methodology only somewhat more sophisticated than &quot;parallel passage&quot; strategies of old despite the inclusion of more text in the analysis. They cite in-progress work by Martin Mueller to digitally analyse 548 plays published between 1562 and 1662 for n-grams, but also note that some playwrights and plays of the era are known only by their names, that anonymous plays could be written by authors whose work is unknown to scholars of drama of the period, and that there was a dramatic increase in the publication of plays starting in 1593, when the practice became normalised for successful plays. Based on Mueller&#x27;s work, the top ten plays with n-gram links to &quot;Edward III&quot; range from 6% to 4%:

# &quot;Henry VI, Part 3&quot; (Shakespeare)
# &quot;Edward II&quot; (Marlowe)
# &quot;Henry VI, Part 1&quot; (Shakespeare, possibly with Thomas Nashe, Kyd, and/or Marlowe)
# &quot;Alphonsus, King of Aragon&quot; (Robert Greene)
# &quot;Richard III&quot; (Shakespeare)
# &quot;Tamburlaine, Part 1&quot; (Marlowe)
# &quot;King John&quot; (Shakespeare)
# &quot;A Knack to Know a Knave&quot; (anonymous)
# &quot;Tamburlaine, Part 2&quot; (Marlowe)
# &quot;The Massacre at Paris&quot; (Marlowe)

This suggests to them that genre is more significant than author. They also note that Kyd&#x27;s plays do not score that high on Mueller&#x27;s scale, &quot;The Spanish Tragedy&quot; at 24th, &quot;Soliman and Perseda&quot; at 33rd, and &quot;Cornelia&quot; at 121st. They also note that Vickers was working on a wider project to expand the canon of Kyd to include &quot;Edward III&quot;, &quot;Arden of Faversham&quot;, &quot;Fair Em&quot;, &quot;King Leir&quot;, and parts of &quot;Henry VI, Part 1&quot;. Marcus Dahl did n-gram research on Nashe&#x27;s works and found seven links in &quot;Summer&#x27;s Last Will and Testament&quot;, 24 links in &quot;Christ&#x27;s Tears Over Jerusalem&quot;, thirteen links in &quot;The Unfortunate Traveller&quot;, and four links in &quot;The Terrors of the Night&quot;. Proudfoot and Bennett argue that Nashe&#x27;s access to the library of Sir Robert Cotton, 1st Baronet, of Connington, would have given Nashe access to Froissart and other sources of the play. They note that the only reference to Froissart in all of Shakespeare&#x27;s canonical work is in the first act of &quot;Henry VI, Part 1&quot;, which many scholars now attribute to Nashe. Nashe was known primarily as a playwright, but &quot;Summer&#x27;s Last Will and Testament&quot; is his only theatrical work of undisputed authorship still extant. Proudfoot and Bennett also suggest that Nashe&#x27;s possible co-authorship need not have been dialogue writing, but structuring the plot. &quot;It will be apparent&quot;, they write, however, that the attempt to identify Nashe as a putative partner in writing &quot;Edward III&quot; is wholly conjectural, anchored to the few known facts of his familiarity with Froissart and perhaps by phrasal links with the verbal text of &quot;Edward III&quot;. If this hypothesis has any interest, then it may be in confronting the question of how the selection of material from Froissart for &quot;Edward III&quot; came to be as it is and not otherwise. The fact that it is purely speculative may serve to illustrate the tantalising gap that remains between the playtext that has survived and the attempt to locate it among what little is known of the writers and players who brought it into being.

Charles R. Forker&#x27;s analysis of &quot;The Troublesome Reign of John, King of England&quot; (2011) assesses that anonymous play as being by George Peele, and &quot;Edward III&quot; as stylistically different from that of Peele. Nevertheless, Tucker Brooke identified Peele as the author of &quot;Edward III&quot; in 1908, and Lois Potter did so in 2012. &quot;Any case for Peele&quot;, write Proudfoot and Bennett, &quot;would take as its point of departure the fact that his known plays share several concerns with &quot;Edward III&quot;: &quot;David and Bethsabe&quot; revolves around adulterous love and its consequences; the action of &quot;Edward I&quot; dramatises the creation of the title of Prince of Wales (of which the Black Prince was only the third holder); while &quot;The Battle of Alcazar&quot; dramatises sixteenth-century warfare—the anachronistic model for the battle narratives in &quot;Edward III&quot;, with their pikes and naval gunnery.&quot;

Proudfoot and Bennett&#x27;s arguments, particularly those pertaining to statistical analysis of n-grams, are countered by Darren Freebury-Jones, who provides a sustained analysis of the evidence in favour of Shakespeare and Thomas Kyd as direct collaborators.

Harold Bloom rejected the theory that Shakespeare wrote &quot;Edward III&quot;, on the grounds that he found &quot;nothing in the play is representative of the dramatist who had written &quot;Richard III&quot;.

==Performance history==
The first modern performance of the play was on 6 March 1911, when the Elizabethan Stage Society performed Act 2 at the Little Theatre in London. Following this, the BBC broadcast an abridged version of the play in 1963, with complete performances taking place in Los Angeles in 1986 (as part of a season of Shakespeare Apocrypha) and Mold in 1987.

In 1977, the play was incorporated into the marathon BBC Radio dramatic series &quot;Vivat Rex&quot; as Episodes Three: &quot;Obsession&quot; and Four: &quot;The Black Prince&quot; with Keith Michell as &quot;Edward III&quot;, Christopher Neame as &quot;Edward the Black Prince&quot; and Richard Burton as &quot;The Narrator&quot;.

In 1998, Cambridge University Press became the first major publisher to produce an edition of the play under Shakespeare&#x27;s name, and shortly afterward the Royal Shakespeare Company performed the play (to mixed reviews).

The American premiere of &quot;Edward III&quot; was staged by Pacific Repertory Theatre as part of the company&#x27;s Carmel Shakespeare Festival in 2001.

In 2002, the Royal Shakespeare Company&#x27;s production was performed as part of a season of little done plays by Shakespeare&#x27;s contemporaries along with such titles as &quot;The Roman Actor&quot; by Philip Massinger and &quot;Eastward Ho&quot; by Ben Jonson. The production was directed by Anthony Clarke and starred David Rintoul as King Edward and Caroline Faber as the Countess. It was performed at the Swan Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon, a venue known for tackling more non-mainstream titles. The production mixed costuming and set elements that included medieval armor and weaponry with 19th century style military uniforms.

In 2009, director Donna Northcott of St. Louis Shakespeare produced a traditionally set production on a multi-tiered set at the Orthwein Theater.
In 2011, the Atlanta Shakespeare Company presented a production in repertory with &quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen&quot; at their Shakespeare Tavern Theater. In his director&#x27;s note, Director Troy Willis stressed the various elements of honor and chivalry found in the play were often taught to the nobility by characters who were lower in social station than themselves. This is notable in the Countess instructing King Edward and Audley instructing the young prince.

In 2014, the Hawai&#x27;i Shakespeare Festival (HSF) presented an anime/video game style production that was notable for using dancers as stand ins for King Edward and King John as they controlled the dancers from the sides of the stage.

In 2016, the Hudson Shakespeare Company presented a production as part of their Shakespeare in the Park series and their history cycle treatment of Shakespeare&#x27;s second or major cycle producing it along with &quot;Richard II&quot; and &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; and &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot;. As &quot;Edward III&quot; takes place two generations before &quot;Richard II&quot;, which was done in a late medieval style, &quot;Edward III&quot; was placed in an early medieval/Viking setting to depict an earlier time. Other notable features included by Artistic Director Jon Ciccarelli were a Viking party scene that bridged the Edward-Countess meeting scene with the Lodowick monologue and included an historical dramatization of Edward&#x27;s founding of the &quot;Order of the Garter&quot; stressing the mutual attraction between Edward (Ben Forer) and the Countess (Rachel Matusewicz).

In 2016, The Flock Theater in New London, Connecticut, featured a decidedly older King Edward and much younger Countess.

In 2016, the Chicago Shakespeare Theater presented &quot;Edward III&quot; as part of a 3-play history cycle that included &quot;Henry V&quot; and &quot;Henry VI, Part 1&quot;. The cycle was called &quot;Tug of War: Foreign Fire&quot; and concluded in a follow-up cycle called &quot;Tug of War: Civil Strife&quot; which included &quot;Henry VI, Part 2&quot;, &quot;Henry VI, Part 3&quot; and &quot;Richard III&quot;.

<text>A prince consort is the husband of a monarch who is not a monarch in his own right. In recognition of his status, a prince consort may be given a formal title, such as &quot;prince&quot;. Most monarchies do not allow the husband of a queen regnant to be titled as a king because it is perceived as a higher title than queen, however, some monarchies use the title of king consort for the role.

== Usage in Europe ==

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, the title &quot;Prince Consort&quot; is unique to Prince Albert, although the term applies as a description to other British princes consort. The title was awarded to him in 1857 by his wife, Queen Victoria. Before Prince Albert, there had only been five English, Scottish or British male consorts, being the husbands of Mary I of England, Queen Anne, and Mary, Queen of Scots, the last of whom was married three times during her long reign. The remaining queens regnant before Victoria sidestepped the question of the proper title for a male consort, Elizabeth I having never married, and Mary II&#x27;s husband William III having been explicitly made king in his own right. 
The titles of the five pre-Victorian male consorts varied widely. Philip of Spain, the husband of Mary I of England, was declared king &quot;jure uxoris&quot; and given powers equal to his wife while she reigned, but Queen Anne&#x27;s husband Prince George of Denmark received no British titles other than the Dukedom of Cumberland (his princely title being Danish). Meanwhile, the titles of the three husbands of Mary, Queen of Scots, was never fully resolved. At least one (Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley), was declared king consort, and both he and his predecessor Francis II of France sought recognition as king &quot;jure uxoris&quot; (under a proffered theory of the &quot;Crown Matrimonial of Scotland&quot;), but the title and powers of the consort were a constant issue during Mary&#x27;s reign and remained unresolved when Mary was captured and executed.

The only male consort since Prince Albert&#x27;s death, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, the consort of Elizabeth II, was made a peer of the United Kingdom in advance of his marriage to then-Princess Elizabeth in 1947. After Elizabeth&#x27;s accession in 1952, there was debate in royal circles and among senior politicians (both in Britain and in other Commonwealth Realms, particularly Canada) about her husband&#x27;s proper title. Some leaders, including the prime minister of the day, Winston Churchill, suggested reviving Prince Albert&#x27;s title of &quot;Prince Consort&quot;. Others put forward other styles, including &quot;Prince of the Realm&quot; and &quot;Prince of the Commonwealth&quot; (the latter of which was suggested by John Diefenbaker, at the time a member of the Canadian Opposition front bench). In 1957, Elizabeth created Philip a prince of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the same title borne by sons of the sovereign.

The distinction between the positions of prince consort and king is important in the British patriarchal hierarchical system. Within this hierarchy, the king holds a higher position in the British social hierarchy than any other, and so more power is attributed to him. When the monarch is female, such as Queen Victoria, who ascended to the throne in 1837, power is attributed to the queen, for she holds the highest position in the absence of a king. Unlike a queen consort, a prince consort is not crowned and anointed alongside his wife at her coronation.

=== Other countries ===
Jacques I became the prince consort of Monaco in 1731 after his wife, Louise Hippolyte, became the sovereign princess.

In 2005, Prince Henrik, the husband of Margrethe II of Denmark, was awarded the title. He had requested the title of &quot;king consort&quot; and style of &quot;His Majesty&quot; but was denied. In 2016, he announced that upon his retirement, he would revert to the title of prince that he had received upon their marriage in 1967.

==King consort==
A king consort or emperor consort is a rarely used title to describe the husband of a queen regnant. Examples include:
*Mary, Queen of Scots (reigned 1542–1567) was first married to Francis, Dauphin of France (later Francis II of France), who became king consort of Scotland upon their marriage. She then married Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, the eldest son of the Earl and Countess of Lennox in July 1565. Darnley was a great-grandson of Henry VII of England and Mary&#x27;s first cousin, and he was considered to have a strong claim to the Scottish throne. On the evening before their marriage, Mary proclaimed Darnley &quot;King of Scots&quot;, a title that she could not legally grant him without the consent of Parliament, but which was never formally challenged. However, this title did not grant him any automatic right of rule or of succession to the throne should Mary die. For that to happen, it was necessary that Mary grant him the Crown Matrimonial of Scotland, which never happened.
*Mary I of England (reigned 1553–1558) married Prince Philip (later Philip II of Spain) in 1554. Under the terms of Queen Mary&#x27;s Marriage Act, Philip was to be styled &quot;King of England&quot;, all official documents (including Acts of Parliament) were to be dated with both their names, and Parliament was to be called under the joint authority of the couple, for the duration of the marriage only. This created a coregency by &quot;jure uxoris&quot;.
*When the reigning Isabella II (reigned 1833–1868) married Francis, Duke of Cádiz, he became king consort of Spain. Like his wife, he retained the style and title of king even after her abdication in favour of their son, Alfonso XII.
*Queen Victoria (reigned 1837–1901) wanted to make her husband Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha &quot;king consort&quot; but the British government refused to introduce a bill allowing it, as Albert was a foreigner. She instead gave him the title of &quot;prince consort&quot; in 1857.

<text>Joseph Duffy (born 3 February 1934) was the Roman Catholic Bishop of Clogher in Ireland, a position he held from 1979 until his retirement on 6 May 2010. He resides in Monaghan Town, County Monaghan, Ireland.

==Early life and priestly ministry==
Duffy was the eldest of three boys and one girl born to Edward Duffy and Brigid MacEntee of Annagose, Newbliss, County Monaghan. Born in Dublin, he was educated at St. Louis&#x27; Infant School, Clones, County Monaghan, and at St Macartan&#x27;s College on the outskirts of Monaghan Town, where he was a boarder for five years.

He studied for the priesthood at St Patrick&#x27;s College, Maynooth, and was ordained priest for the Diocese of Clogher on 22 June 1958. After his ordination he continued his studies in Irish and completed a thesis on the dialect of south County Tipperary for a master&#x27;s degree in the National University of Ireland (the NUI) in 1960.

He returned to St. Macartan&#x27;s College, where he taught Irish and French for twelve years. During these years he spent several sessions in French universities pursuing summer courses in French.

From 1972 to 1979 he was a curate in the parish of Enniskillen, County Fermanagh. This was a team ministry with three other curates and the parish priest, and included a chaplaincy to St. Fanchea&#x27;s College for Girls, and a part-time chaplaincy at the Erne Hospital. During these years he was involved in PACE (Protestant and Catholic Encounter) and served on the committee of the Ulster Architectural Heritage Society (the UAHS.)

==Bishop of Clogher==

On 7 July 1979, Duffy was named Bishop-elect of Clogher, the first Irish bishop to be appointed by Pope John Paul II. He was ordained a bishop in St. Macartan&#x27;s Cathedral, Monaghan Town, on 2 September of the same year. The Principal Consecrator was Tomás Cardinal Ó Fiaich, Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland. Gaetano Alibrandi, Titular Archbishop of Binda, the Apostolic Nuncio to Ireland, and Patrick Mulligan, the Bishop Emeritus of Clogher, acted as the Principal Co–Consecrators.
For some years during the 1990s he served as media spokesman for the Irish Bishops Conference. He was also Chairman of the Commission for Communications of the Irish Bishops&#x27; Conference and the representative of the Irish Bishops on the Commission of the Bishops&#x27; Conferences of the European Union ([COMECE]).

His Church of Ireland counterpart during the latter years of his episcopal term was Bishop Michael Jackson. Each Christmas from 2002 on Duffy and Jackson delivered a joint Christmas message . Both bishops were also present at a service in honour of Saint Macartan, Patron Saint of Clogher at St. Macartan&#x27;s College, the Catholic Diocesan Seminary in Monaghan. It marked the celebration of fifteen hundred years of Christian witness in Clogher Diocese.

On 28 January 2008 Duffy became the longest-serving ordinary in Ireland, having once been the youngest Irish bishop at the time of his episcopal ordination. In accordance with Canon Law he offered his resignation to the Holy See on his seventy-fifth birthday, on 3 February 2009.

His resignation was accepted by Pope Benedict XVI on 6 May 2010, when it was announced that Liam MacDaid would be his successor. MacDaid received episcopal ordination from Dr. Duffy in late July 2010.

== Failure to prevent clerical sexual abuse ==
Duffy received criticism for failing to report clerical sexual abuse in his diocese. In 2010, Duffy admitted that he was made aware in October 1989 of allegations of sexual abuse by Father John McCabe a priest and teacher at St Michael&#x27;s College, Enniskillen (where Duffy was also chairman of the board of governors), when the parents of his victim reported to Duffy that the priest had been abusing their son from the ages of 9 to 15, Duffy failed to report the allegations to the police, the social services in Northern Ireland or the school that McCabe was then teaching at. McCabe eventually pleaded guilty in December 1995 to indecently assaulting the boy on 13 separate occasions. Duffy also admitted that he was previously party to least one civil settlement between the Diocese of Clogher and claimants of clerical sexual abuse, where the alleged victims were forced to sign a non-disclosure agreement as part of the resolution. In the same year, Duffy was summoned to the Vatican for a meeting with Benedict XVI to discuss what prior knowledge he had about allegations of sexual abuse of children against clergy members within Clogher diocese.

In 2013, a report by the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church was highly critical of Duffy&#x27;s 31 year tenure as Bishop of Clogher, stating that he consistently failed to take steps to prevent members of the Roman Catholic clergy under his charge from sexually abusing children within the diocese. The report highlighted cases such as a priest facing multiple allegations of sexual abuse who was moved to a new parish in Ireland then sent overseas instead of being expelled from his ministry, and another priest who was accused of abuse to continue in his role instead of being removed from ministerial duties. Between 1975 and 2012, a total of 23 allegations of sexual abuse against Clogher diocese clergy members were reported to Gardai and 22 allegations were reported to the HSE, according to the report.

It was also revealed in 2013 that Duffy&#x27;s deceased uncle, Canon Peter Duffy, had been investigated by the authorities in Northern Ireland for the sexual abuse of 3 children while he was parish priest of Donagh during the 1970s and 1980s, and that the Diocese of Clogher had since made civil settlements with the claimants. One of the alleged victims, Michael Connolly, stated that in 2009 he had provided graphic details of his allegations to Bishop Duffy during a private meeting, and although Duffy was sympathetic he did not appear to take any steps to determine if there were any other victims in the Donagh area.

<text>Jean Arthur (born Gladys Georgianna Greene; October 17, 1900 – June 19, 1991) was an American film and theater actress whose career began in silent films in the early 1920s and lasted until the early 1950s.

Arthur had feature roles in three Frank Capra films: &quot;Mr. Deeds Goes to Town&quot; (1936) with Gary Cooper, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It with You&quot; (1938) co-starring James Stewart, and &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot; (1939), also starring Stewart. These three films all championed the &quot;everyday heroine&quot;, personified by Arthur. She also co-starred with Cary Grant in the adventure-drama &quot;Only Angels Have Wings&quot; (1939) and in the comedy-drama &quot;The Talk of the Town&quot; (1942). She starred as the lead in the acclaimed and highly successful comedy films &quot;The Devil and Miss Jones&quot; (1941) and &quot;A Foreign Affair&quot; (1948), the latter of which she starred alongside Marlene Dietrich. Arthur was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress in 1944 for her performance in &quot;The More the Merrier&quot; (1943), a comedy which also starred Joel McCrea.

James Harvey wrote in his history of the romantic comedy: &quot;No one was more closely identified with the screwball comedy than Jean Arthur. So much was she part of it, so much was her star personality defined by it, that the screwball style itself seems almost unimaginable without her.&quot; She has been called &quot;the quintessential comedic leading lady&quot;. Her last film performance was non-comedic, playing the homesteader&#x27;s wife in George Stevens&#x27;s &quot;Shane&quot; in 1953.

Like Greta Garbo, Arthur was well known in Hollywood for her aversion to publicity; she was very guarded about her privacy and rarely signed autographs or granted interviews. &quot;Life&quot; observed in a 1940 article: &quot;Next to Garbo, Jean Arthur is Hollywood&#x27;s reigning mystery woman.&quot; As well as recoiling from interviews, after a certain age, she avoided photographers and refused to become a part of any kind of publicity.

==Early life==

Arthur was born Gladys Georgianna Greene in Plattsburgh, New York, to Protestant parents Johanna Augusta Nelson and Hubert Sidney Greene. Gladys&#x27; Lutheran maternal grandparents immigrated from Norway to the American West after the Civil War. Her Congregationalist paternal ancestors immigrated from England to Rhode Island in the second half of the 1600s. During the 1790s, Nathaniel Greene helped found the town of St. Albans, Vermont, where his great-grandson, Hubert Greene, was born.

Arthur had three older brothers.

The product of a nomadic childhood, Arthur lived at times in Saranac Lake, New York; Jacksonville, Florida, and Schenectady, New York. The family lived on and off in Westbrook, Maine, from 1908 to 1915, while Arthur&#x27;s father worked at Lamson Studios in Portland. Relocating in 1915 to New York City, the family settled in the Washington Heights neighborhood of upper Manhattan.

Arthur dropped out of high school in her junior year due to a &quot;change in family circumstances&quot;.

==Career==
===Silent film===
Discovered by Fox Film Studios while she was doing commercial modeling in New York City in the early 1920s, the newly named Jean Arthur landed a one-year contract and debuted in the silent film &quot;Cameo Kirby&quot; (1923), directed by John Ford. She reputedly took her stage name from two of her greatest heroes, Joan of Arc (Jeanne d&#x27;Arc) and King Arthur. The studio was at the time looking for new American sweethearts with sufficient sex appeal to interest the Jazz Age audiences. Arthur was remodeled as such a personality, a flapper.

Following the small role in &quot;Cameo Kirby&quot;, she received her first female lead role in &quot;The Temple of Venus&quot; (1923), a plotless tale about a group of dancing nymphs. Dissatisfied with her lack of acting talent, the film&#x27;s director, Henry Otto, replaced Arthur with actress Mary Philbin during the third day of shooting. Arthur agreed with the director: &quot;There wasn&#x27;t a spark from within. I was acting like a mechanical doll personality. I thought I was disgraced for life.&quot;

Arthur was planning on leaving the California film industry for good, but reluctantly stayed due to her contract, and appeared in comedy shorts, instead. Despite lacking the required talent, Arthur liked acting, which she perceived as an &quot;outlet&quot;. To acquire some fame, she registered herself in the Los Angeles city directory as a photo player operator, as well as appearing in a promotional film for a new Encino nightclub, but to no avail.

Change came when one day she showed up at the lot of Action Pictures, which produced B Westerns, and impressed its owner, Lester F. Scott, Jr., with her presence. He decided to take a chance on a complete unknown, and she was cast in over 20 Westerns in a two-year period. Only receiving $25 a picture, Arthur suffered from difficult working conditions: &quot;The films were generally shot on location, often in the desert near Los Angeles, under a scorching sun that caused throats to parch and make-up to run. Running water was nowhere to be found, and even outhouses were a luxury not always present. The extras on these films were often real cowboys, tough men who were used to roughing it and who had little use for those who were not.&quot; The films were moderately successful in second-rate Midwestern theaters, though Arthur received no official attention. Aside from appearing in films for Action Pictures between 1924 and 1926, she worked in some independent Westerns, including &quot;The Drug Store Cowboy&quot; (1925), and Westerns for Poverty Row, as well as having an uncredited bit part in Buster Keaton&#x27;s &quot;Seven Chances&quot; (1925) as the receptionist.

In 1927, Arthur attracted more attention when she appeared opposite Mae Busch and Charles Delaney as a gold-digging chorus girl in &quot;Husband Hunters&quot;. Subsequently, she was romanced by actor Monty Banks in &quot;Horse Shoes&quot; (1927), both a commercial and critical success. She was cast on Banks&#x27;s insistence, and received a salary of $700. Next, director Richard Wallace ignored Fox&#x27;s wishes to cast a more experienced actress by assigning Arthur to the female lead in &quot;The Poor Nut&quot; (1927), a college comedy, which gave her wide exposure to audiences. A reviewer for &quot;Variety&quot; did not spare the actress in his review:

With everyone in Hollywood bragging about the tremendous overflow of charming young women all battering upon the directorial doors leading to an appearance in pictures, it seems strange that from all these should have been selected two flat specimens such as Jean Arthur and Jane Winton. Neither of the girls has screen presence. Even under the kindliest treatment from the camera, they are far from attractive and in one or two side shots almost impossible.


Fed up with the direction that her career was taking, Arthur expressed her desire for a big break in an interview at the time. She was skeptical when signed to a small role in &quot;Warming Up&quot; (1928), a film produced for a big studio, Famous Players–Lasky, and featuring major star Richard Dix. Promoted as the studio&#x27;s first sound film, it received wide media attention, and Arthur earned praise for her portrayal of a baseball club owner&#x27;s daughter. &quot;Variety&quot; opined, &quot;Dix and Arthur are splendid in spite of the wretched material&quot;, while &quot;Screenland&quot; wrote that Arthur &quot;is one of the most charming young kissees who ever officiated in a Dix film. Jean is winsome; she neither looks nor acts like the regular movie heroine. She&#x27;s a nice girl – but she has her moments.&quot; The success of &quot;Warming Up&quot; resulted in Arthur being signed to a three-year contract with the studio, soon to be known as Paramount Pictures, at $150 a week.

===Transition to sound film===
With the rise of the talkies in the late 1920s, Arthur was among the many silent-screen actors of Paramount Pictures initially unwilling to adapt to sound films. Upon realizing that the craze for sound films was not a phase, she met with sound coach Roy Pomeroy. Her distinctive, throaty voice – in addition to some stage training on Broadway in the early 1930s – eventually helped make her a star in the talkies, but it initially prevented directors from casting her in films. In her early talkies, this &quot;throaty&quot; voice is still missing, and whether it had not yet emerged or whether she hid it remains unclear. Her all-talking film debut was &quot;The Canary Murder Case&quot; (1929), in which she co-starred opposite William Powell and Louise Brooks. Arthur impressed only a few with the film, and later claimed that at the time she was a &quot;very poor actress ... awfully anxious to improve, but ... inexperienced so far as genuine training was concerned.&quot;

In the early years of talking pictures, Paramount was known for contracting Broadway actors with experienced vocals and impressive background references. Arthur was not among these actors, and she struggled for recognition in the film industry. Her personal involvement with rising Paramount executive David O. Selznick – despite his relationship with Irene Mayer Selznick – proved substantial; she was put on the map and became selected as one of the WAMPAS Baby Stars in 1929. Following a silent B Western called &quot;Stairs of Sand&quot; (1929), she received some positive notices when she played the female lead in the lavish production of &quot;The Mysterious Dr. Fu Manchu&quot; (1929). Arthur was given more publicity assignments, which she carried out, though she immensely disliked posing for photographers and giving interviews.

Through Selznick, Arthur received her &quot;best role to date&quot; opposite famous sex symbol Clara Bow in the early sound film &quot;The Saturday Night Kid&quot; (1929). Of the two female leads, Arthur was thought to have &quot;the better part&quot;, and director Edward Sutherland claimed, &quot;Arthur was so good that we had to cut and cut to keep her from stealing the picture&quot; from Bow. While some argued that Bow resented Arthur for having the &quot;better part,&quot; Bow encouraged Arthur to make the most of the production. Arthur later praised her working experience with Bow: &quot;[Bow] was so generous, no snootiness or anything. She was wonderful to me.&quot; The film was a moderate success, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film would have been &quot;merely commonplace, were it not for Jean Arthur, who plays the catty sister with a great deal of skill.&quot;

Following a role in &quot;Half way to Heaven&quot; (1929) opposite popular actor Charles &quot;Buddy&quot; Rogers (of which &quot;Variety&quot; opined that her career could be heading somewhere if she acquired more sex appeal), Selznick assigned her to play William Powell&#x27;s wife in &quot;Street of Chance&quot; (1930). She did not impress the film&#x27;s director, John Cromwell, who advised the actress to move back to New York because she would not make it in Hollywood. By 1930, her relationship with Selznick had ended, causing her career at Paramount to slip. Following a string of &quot;lifeless ingenue roles&quot; in mediocre films, she debuted on stage in December 1930 with a supporting role in Pasadena Playhouse&#x27;s 10-day production run of &quot;Spring Song&quot;. Back in Hollywood, Arthur saw her career deteriorating, and she dyed her hair blonde in an attempt to boost her image and avoid comparison with more successful actress Mary Brian. Her effort did not pay off; when her three-year contract at Paramount expired in mid-1931, she was given her release with an announcement from Paramount that the decision was due to financial setbacks caused by the Great Depression.

===Broadway===

In late 1931, Arthur returned to New York City, where a Broadway agent cast Arthur in an adaptation of &quot;Lysistrata&quot;, which opened at the Riviera Theater on January 24, 1932. A few months later, she made her Broadway debut in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; opposite Dorothy Gish and Osgood Perkins. Though the play did not fare well and closed after 23 performances, critics were impressed by her work on stage. She next won the female lead in &quot;The Man Who Reclaimed His Head&quot;, which opened on September 8, 1932, at the Broadhurst Theatre to mostly mixed notices for Arthur; negative reviews for the play caused the production to be halted quickly. Arthur returned to California for the holidays, and appeared in the RKO film &quot;The Past of Mary Holmes&quot; (1933), her first film in two years.

Back on Broadway, Arthur continued to appear in small plays that received little attention. Critics, however, continued to praise her in their reviews. In this period, Arthur arguably developed confidence in her acting craft for the first time. On the contrast between films in Hollywood and plays in New York, Arthur commented:

I don&#x27;t think Hollywood is the place to be yourself. The individual ought to find herself before coming to Hollywood. On the stage I found myself to be in a different world. The individual counted. The director encouraged me and I learned how to be myself... I learned to face audiences and to forget them. To see the footlights and not to see them; to gauge the reactions of hundreds of people, and yet to throw myself so completely into a role that I was oblivious to their reaction.

&quot;The Curtain Rises&quot;, which ran from October to December 1933, was Arthur&#x27;s first Broadway play in which she was the center of attention. With an improved résumé, she returned to Hollywood in late 1933, and turned down several contract offers until she was asked to meet with an executive from Columbia Pictures. Columbia hired her.

===Columbia Pictures===
During production of her first Columbia feature, she was offered a long-term contract that promised financial stability for herself and both of her parents. Though hesitant to give up her stage career, Arthur signed the five-year contract on February 14, 1934.

Jean Arthur&#x27;s first two features for Columbia starred the studio&#x27;s number-one boxoffice draw, the action star Jack Holt. Holt had a loyal following among fans and exhibitors, and Columbia&#x27;s president Harry Cohn knew that Arthur would benefit from the exposure, and from working with screen veteran Holt. &quot;Whirlpool&quot; cast tough-guy Holt as a once-convicted gambler reunited with the daughter he has never seen. Arthur played the daughter with sincerity and sympathy, while Holt displayed a tenderness and compassion never before seen in his two-fisted melodramas. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; observed, &quot;Particularly touching and well done are [Holt&#x27;s] scenes with his daughter. He is given splendid assistance by Jean Arthur, and by the director, Roy William Neill. Without overplaying or mawkish sentimentality, these scenes have a natural, human quality that counts.&quot;

Holt and Arthur were teamed a few months later for a follow-up, &quot;The Defense Rests&quot; (1934); Arthur, fresh out of law school, wants to work for celebrated criminal lawyer Holt, and soon learns the inside story of Holt&#x27;s success.

Arthur&#x27;s success in the Holt pictures had a salutary effect on the actress&#x27;s outlook, according to &quot;Picture Play&quot;: 
&quot;Her entire personality has changed, and from a somewhat immature actress of nice but no startling ability she has blossomed into a distinctive artist, and only the future can tell how high she will soar... [She] now receives, from &quot;Whirlpool&quot; alone, approval that any far more experienced actress might spend years in building up.&quot;

In 1935, at age 34, Arthur starred opposite Edward G. Robinson in the gangster farce &quot;The Whole Town&#x27;s Talking&quot;, also directed by Ford, and her popularity began to rise. It was the first time Arthur portrayed a hard-boiled working girl with a heart of gold, the type of role with which she would be associated for the rest of her career. She enjoyed the acting experience and working opposite Robinson, who remarked in his biography that it was a &quot;delight to work with and know&quot; Arthur. By the time of the film&#x27;s release, her hair, naturally brunette throughout the silent-film portion of her career, was bleached blonde and mostly stayed that way. She was known for maneuvering to be photographed and filmed almost exclusively from the left; Arthur felt that her left was her better side, and worked hard to keep it in the fore. Director Frank Capra recalled producer Harry Cohn&#x27;s description of Jean Arthur&#x27;s imbalanced profile: &quot;half of it&#x27;s angel, and the other half horse.&quot;

Her next few films, &quot;Party Wire&quot; (1935), &quot;Public Hero No. 1&quot; (1935), and &quot;If You Could Only Cook&quot; (1935), did not match the success of &quot;The Whole Town&#x27;s Talking&quot;, but they all brought the actress positive reviews. In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Andre Sennwald praised Arthur&#x27;s performance in &quot;Public Hero No. 1&quot;, writing that she &quot;is as refreshing a change from the routine it-girl as Joseph Calleia is in his own department.&quot; Another critic wrote of her performance in &quot;If You Could Only Cook&quot; that &quot;[she is] outstanding as she effortlessly slips from charming comedienne to beautiful romantic.&quot; With her now apparent rise to fame, Arthur was able to extract several contractual concessions from Harry Cohn, such as script and director approval and the right to make films for other studios.

The turning point in Arthur&#x27;s career came when she was chosen by Frank Capra to star in &quot;Mr. Deeds Goes to Town&quot; (1936). Capra had spotted her in a daily rush from the film &quot;Whirlpool&quot; in 1934 and convinced Cohn to have Columbia Studios sign her for his next film, as a tough newspaperwoman who falls in love with a country bumpkin millionaire. Though several colleagues later recalled that Arthur was troubled by extreme stage fright during production, &quot;Mr. Deeds&quot; was critically acclaimed and propelled her to international stardom. In 1936 alone, she earned $119,000, more than the President of the United States and baseball star Lou Gehrig &quot;combined&quot;.

With fame also came media attention, something Arthur greatly disliked. She did not attend any social gatherings, such as formal parties in Hollywood, and acted difficult when having to work with an interviewer. She was named the American Greta Garbo – who was also known for her reclusive life – and magazine &quot;Movie Classic&quot; wrote of her in 1937: &quot;With Garbo talking right out loud in interviews, receiving the press and even welcoming an occasional chance to say her say in the public prints, the palm for elusiveness among screen stars now goes to Jean Arthur.&quot;


Arthur&#x27;s next film was &quot;The Ex-Mrs. Bradford&quot; (1936), on loan to RKO Pictures, in which she starred opposite William Powell on his insistence, and hoped to take a long vacation afterwards. Cohn, however, rushed her into two more productions, &quot;Adventure in Manhattan&quot; (1936) and &quot;More Than a Secretary&quot; (1936). Neither film attracted much attention.

Next, again without pause, she was reteamed with Cooper, playing Calamity Jane in Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s &quot;The Plainsman&quot; (1936) on another loan, this time for Paramount Pictures. Arthur, who was De Mille&#x27;s second choice after Mae West, described Calamity Jane as her favorite role thus far.

In 1937, she appeared as a working girl, her typical role, in Mitchell Leisen&#x27;s screwball comedy, &quot;Easy Living&quot; (1937), with Ray Milland. She followed this with another screwball comedy, Capra&#x27;s &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It with You&quot; (1938), which teamed her with James Stewart. The film won an Academy Award for Best Picture, with Arthur getting top billing.

So strong was her box-office appeal by now that she was one of four finalists for the role of Scarlett O&#x27;Hara in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939). The film&#x27;s producer, David O. Selznick, had briefly romanced Arthur in the late 1920s when they both were with Paramount. Arthur reunited with director Frank Capra and Stewart for &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot; (1939), with Arthur cast once again as a working woman, this time one who teaches the naïve Mr. Smith the ways of Washington, DC. Arthur was offered a third reunion with Capra and Stewart in &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; (1946), playing the role of Stewart&#x27;s wife Mary (which eventually went to Donna Reed), but she refused to attend Stephens College.

Arthur continued to star in films such as Howard Hawks&#x27; &quot;Only Angels Have Wings&quot; (also 1939), with Cary Grant, &quot;The Talk of the Town&quot; (1942), directed by George Stevens (with Cary Grant and Ronald Colman, working together for the only time, as Arthur&#x27;s two leading men), and again for Stevens as a government clerk in &quot;The More the Merrier&quot; (1943), for which Arthur was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress (losing to Jennifer Jones for &quot;The Song of Bernadette&quot;). As a result of being in dispute with studio boss Harry Cohn, her fee for &quot;The Talk of the Town&quot; (1942) was only $50,000, while her male co-stars Grant and Colman received upwards of $100,000 each.

Arthur remained Columbia&#x27;s top star until the mid-1940s, when she left the studio; Rita Hayworth took over as the studio&#x27;s biggest name. Stevens famously called her &quot;one of the greatest comediennes the screen has ever seen,&quot; while Capra credited her as &quot;my favorite actress.&quot;

==Later career and retirements==

Arthur announced her retirement when her contract with Columbia Pictures expired in 1944. She reportedly ran through the studio&#x27;s streets, shouting &quot;I&#x27;m free, I&#x27;m free!&quot; For the next several years, she turned down virtually all film offers, the two exceptions being Billy Wilder&#x27;s &quot;A Foreign Affair&quot; (1948), in which she played a congresswoman and rival of Marlene Dietrich&#x27;s, and as a homesteader&#x27;s wife in the classic Western &quot;Shane&quot; (1953), which turned out to be the biggest box-office hit of her career. The latter was her final film, and the only color film in which she appeared.

Arthur&#x27;s postretirement work in theater was intermittent, somewhat curtailed by her unease and discomfort about working in public. Capra claimed she vomited in her dressing room between scenes, yet emerged each time to perform a flawless take. According to John Oller&#x27;s biography, &quot;Jean Arthur: The Actress Nobody Knew&quot; (1997), Arthur developed a kind of stage fright punctuated with bouts of psychosomatic illnesses. A prime example was in 1945, when she was cast in the lead of the Garson Kanin play &quot;Born Yesterday&quot;. Her nerves and insecurity got the better of her and she left the production before it reached Broadway, opening the door for a then-unknown Judy Holliday to take the part.

After &quot;Shane&quot; and &quot;Saint Joan&quot;, Arthur went into retirement for 11 years.

In 1965, the reclusive Arthur returned to show business to star in an episode of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, as Julie Blane in season 10, episode 24’s &quot;Thursday’s Child&quot;. In 1966, she took on the role of Patricia Marshall, an attorney, on her own television sitcom, &quot;The Jean Arthur Show&quot;, which was cancelled midseason by CBS after only 12 episodes.

In 1967, Arthur was coaxed back to Broadway to appear as a Midwestern &quot;spinster&quot; who falls in with a group of hippies in the play &quot;The Freaking Out of Stephanie Blake&quot;. In his book &quot;The Season, &quot;William Goldman reconstructed the disastrous production, which eventually closed during previews when Arthur refused to go on.

Arthur next decided to teach drama, first at Vassar College and then the North Carolina School of the Arts.

While living in North Carolina, in 1973, Arthur made front-page news by being arrested and jailed for trespassing on a neighbor&#x27;s property to console a dog she felt was being mistreated. An animal lover her entire life, Arthur said she trusted them more than people. She was convicted, fined $75, and given three years&#x27; probation.

After 11 performances of &quot;First Monday in October&quot; in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1975, Arthur then retired for good, retreating to Driftwood Cottage, her oceanside home on Carmel Point at the southern city limits of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, steadfastly refusing interviews until her resistance was broken down by the author of a book about Capra. Arthur once famously said that she would rather have her throat slit than give an interview.

Arthur was a Democrat and supported the campaigns of Adlai Stevenson during the 1952 presidential election and John F. Kennedy in 1960.

==Personal life==

Arthur&#x27;s first marriage, to photographer Julian Anker in 1928, was annulled after one day. She married producer Frank Ross, Jr. in 1932. They divorced in 1949.

In 1979, Patsy Kelly told Boze Hadleigh that Arthur was a lesbian.

Arthur lived in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, for 30 years,&lt;ref name=&quot;courant/la-et-mn-feud&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and died from heart failure on June 19, 1991, at the age of 90. No funeral service was held. She was cremated, and her remains were scattered off the coast of Point Lobos, California.

===Driftwood Cottage===
Driftwood Cottage, in Carmel, California, was once the home of Arthur and her mother Johanna Greene. Arthur remodeled the house and created a large outdoor garden, with landscape artist George Hoy, in a Japanese architecture style, including a Japanese bronze dragon gate latch.

==Legacy==

Upon her death, film reviewer Charles Champlin wrote the following in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;:
For her contribution to the motion-picture industry, Arthur has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6333 Hollywood Blvd.

In 2014, Arthur was inducted into the Hall of Great Western Performers at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City.

<text>Daniel Drew (July 29, 1797 – September 18, 1879) was an American businessman, steamship and railroad developer, and financier. Summarizing his life, Henry Clews wrote: &quot;Of all the great operators of Wall Street ... Daniel Drew furnishes the most remarkable instance of immense and long-continued success, followed by utter failure and hopeless bankruptcy&quot;.

==Biography==
Drew was born in Carmel, New York, to Gilbert Drew and Catherine Muckleworth. He was poorly educated and saw hardship after his father, who owned a small cattle farm, died when Daniel was 15 years old. Drew enlisted in the U.S. Army during the War of 1812 but he did not see combat. After the war, he spent some time with a traveling zoo and then built a successful cattle-droving business.

In 1820, he moved to New York City, where he ran the Bull&#x27;s Head Tavern in the Bowery section of New York City, a location frequented by drovers and butchers doing business in the city. While running the tavern, he formed a partnership with two other drovers, buying cattle from neighboring counties and bringing them to New York for sale. In 1823, he married Roxanna Mead.

In 1834, he entered the steamboat business, purchasing a share of a boat operating on the Hudson River. Competing with Cornelius Vanderbilt against the Hudson River Steamboat Association, he ran numerous profitable lines outside of New York City.

Around this time, Drew began to speculate in stocks. He founded the brokerage firm of Drew, Robinson &amp; Company in 1844, which dissolved a decade later with the death of his partner. Following this, operated as an independent trader. In 1857, Drew became a member of the board of directors of the Erie Railroad and used his position to manipulate the railroad stock price. He joined forces with Vanderbilt to rescue the Erie from bankruptcy, and also became a director of the New York and Harlem Railroad, where he collaborated again with Vanderbilt to prop up that company&#x27;s finances.

In 1864, Drew once again struggled with Vanderbilt, speculating on the stock of the New York and Harlem. Drew was selling the stock short, but Vanderbilt and his associates bought every share he sold, ultimately causing the stock price to rise from 90 to 285 in five months. Drew lost $500,000.

In 1866 to 1868, Drew engaged in the Erie War, in which Drew conspired along with fellow directors James Fisk and Jay Gould to issue stock to keep Vanderbilt from gaining control of the Erie Railroad. Vanderbilt, unaware of the increase in outstanding shares, kept buying Erie stock and sustained heavy losses, eventually conceding control of the railroad to the trio.

In 1870, Fisk and Gould betrayed Drew, manipulating the stock price of the Erie Railroad and causing him to lose $1.5 million Fisk was killed in January 1872 by a jealous rival over a mistress; Gould was later swindled out of $1,000,000 worth of Erie railroad stock and never controlled the Erie Railroad. The Panic of 1873 cost Drew still more, and by 1876, he filed for bankruptcy, with debts exceeding a million dollars and no viable assets. He died in 1879, dependent on his son, William for support.

==Legacy==
Drew left behind a controversial legacy, but few written records. Many details about his life come from Bouck White&#x27;s 1910 &quot;Book of Daniel Drew&quot;. White, a socialist activist, claimed to have &quot;found&quot; Drew&#x27;s journal, publishing it as an autobiography. Drew biographer Clifford Browder has called the book &quot;an enduring fake.&quot; Daniel Drew&#x27;s son also contested the authenticity of the work when it was published. 

In the introduction to White&#x27;s 1915 &quot;Letters from Prison: Socialism a Spiritual Sunrise&quot;, the editor similarly notes that &quot;The book of Daniel Drew&quot; was &quot;a work from his [White&#x27;s] pen&quot; and &quot;a freely rendered biography of Daniel Drew&quot;. Despite having been established as a forgery, many details and inaccurate quotes from &quot;The Book of Daniel Drew&quot; are still mistakenly regarded as factual. The longevity of the work&#x27;s influence is also in part due to fabulations in the 1937 film adaptation of the book. The film &quot;The Toast of New York&quot; starred Edward Arnold, Cary Grant, Frances Farmer, and Jack Oakie.

Details of Drew&#x27;s life may be gleaned from other sources. At the zenith of his career as a financier, his personal fortune was estimated at $13 million and he was respectfully called &quot;Uncle Daniel&quot; on Wall Street. Drew&#x27;s business tactics caused him to often be vilified, however, with White claiming that newspapers depicted Drew as &quot;one of the curses of the market for years past. If he has now received such a blow as will result in his being driven from the Street altogether, no one will be sorry for him&quot;, and &quot;he holds the honest people of the world to be a pack of fools&quot;.

A devout Methodist, Drew built churches in Port Jervis, New York, Carmel, and Brewster, New York. He also contributed to the founding of Drew Theological Seminary in Madison, New Jersey, which is now part of Drew University, and Drew Seminary for Young Ladies in his home town of Carmel (which burnt down and closed in 1904).

Drew Street, in eastern Baltimore, is reportedly named after him due to Drew&#x27;s involvement as an investor in the Baltimore Canton Company, which owned and developed much of the area through the early 1900s.

Drew is popularly credited with introducing what would be called &quot;watered stock&quot; to the Wall Street, to describe company shares that were issued by false means including counterfeit stock certificates and unauthorized stock release, resulting in a dilution of ownership. The term came from his time in the livestock business, when he would have his cattle lick salt and drink water before selling them, to increase their weight. The watered stock tactic was used in the Erie War of the 1860s, when Drew along with James Fisk and Jay Gould blocked arch rival Cornelius Vanderbilt from getting ownership of the Erie Railroad. Drew biographer Clifford Browder warns that &quot;not all the Uncle Daniel stories should be believed,&quot; and many stories about his business tactics—especially those recounted by White—should be read with skepticism. 

==Quotations==
Drew is famously credited with an expression that describes the nature of short selling: &quot;He who sells what isn&#x27;t his&#x27;n, must buy it back or go to pris&#x27;n.&quot;

<text>Lope de Aguirre (; 8 November 1510 – 27 October 1561) was a Basque Spanish conquistador who was active in South America. Nicknamed &quot;El Loco&quot; (&quot;the Madman&quot;), he styled himself &quot;Wrath of God.&quot; Aguirre is best known for his final expedition down the Amazon River in search of the mythical golden Kingdom El Dorado and Omagua.

In 1561, Aguirre led a mutiny against the expedition&#x27;s commander, Pedro de Orsúa, and declared his intent to return to Peru and overthrow Spain&#x27;s colonial government. He drafted a letter that defied the Spanish monarch Philip II by renouncing his Spanish vassalage and declared war upon the Habsburg monarch. Aguirre&#x27;s expedition ended with his death by his own men upon confronting Royalist forces in present-day Venezuela. In the years since then he has been treated by historians as a symbol of cruelty and treachery in the early history of colonial Spanish America, and has become an antihero in literature, cinema and other arts. During the Spanish Civil War, he became a revolutionary caudillo figure in the Basque region.

==In Spain==
Aguirre was born around 1510 in the Araotz Valley, a valley and hamlet belonging to Oñati, close to Arantzazu in the province of Gipuzkoa or in Aramaio, in the Basque Country of northern Spain. He was the son of a nobleman, possibly from a family of court clerks. Aguirre was in his twenties and living in Seville when Hernando Pizarro returned from Peru and brought back the treasures of the Incas, inspiring Aguirre to follow in his footsteps. In the early 1530s, Aguirre traveled to the Americas under the sponsorship of Viceroy Antonio de Mendoza, arriving in Cartagena.

==In the New World==
Aguirre probably enlisted in an expedition of 250 men chosen to serve under the command of Rodrigo Duran. He arrived in Peru in 1536 or 1537. Aguirre got work &quot;breaking&quot; stallions in Cuzco, the capital of Nuevo Toledo, and was appointed &quot;regidor&quot; (alderman) of the city. As a conquistador, he soon became infamous for his violence, cruelty, and sedition against the Crown.

In 1544, Aguirre was at the side of Peru&#x27;s first viceroy, Blasco Núñez Vela, who had arrived from Spain with orders to implement the New Laws, suppress the Encomiendas, and liberate the natives from slavery. Many of the conquistadors refused to implement these laws, which prohibited them from exploiting the Indians. Aguirre took part in the plot with Melchor Verdugo to free the viceroy, who had been imprisoned on the island of San Lorenzo, and turned against Gonzalo Pizarro, the leader of the anti-viceroy/New Laws faction.

After the failed attempt, they escaped from Lima to Cajamarca, and started to gather men to help the viceroy. In the meantime, thanks to the &quot;oidor&quot; Alvarez, the viceroy had escaped to Tumbes and gathered a small military force in the belief that all the country would rise up to defend the Crown under the royal flag. The viceroy&#x27;s resistance to Pizarro and his deputy Francisco de Carvajal, the infamous &quot;el demonio de los Andes&quot; (&quot;demon of the Andes&quot;) lasted for two years until he was defeated in Añaquito on 18 January 1546.

Aguirre and Melchor Verdugo had gone to Nicaragua, sailing to Trujillo with 33 men. Verdugo conferred captain&#x27;s rank on Rodrigo de Esquivel and Nuño de Guzmán, sergeant major rank on Aguirre and &quot;contador&quot; status on the cleric Alonso de Henao, who later participated in the expedition of Pedro de Ursúa to Omagua and El Dorado. In 1551, Aguirre returned to Potosí, then still part of Peru and now part of Bolivia.

The judge, Francisco de Esquivel, arrested him and charged him with infraction of the laws protecting the Indians. The judge discounted Aguirre&#x27;s justifications and his claims of belonging to the Spanish gentry and sentenced him to a public flogging. His pride wounded, Aguirre waited for the end of the judge&#x27;s mandate to avenge his honor. Fearing Aguirre&#x27;s vengeance, the judge fled, changing his residence constantly.

Aguirre pursued Esquivel to Lima, Quito and then to Cuzco, missing him at all three places. For three years he trailed Esquivel on foot and without shoes, his soldiers following this obstinate pursuit with interest. Aguirre found him in Cuzco, taking a nap in the library of his house, and wearing a coat of chain mail he always wore for fear of Aguirre. Aguirre crept up to the sleeping Esquivel and stabbed him twice with a dagger. When the mail stopped his blows to the former magistrate&#x27;s body, he stabbed him in the right temple and killed him. Protected by friends who had hidden him, Aguirre fled from Cuzco and took refuge with a relative in Huamanga.

In 1554, needing to put down the rebellion of Hernández Girón, Alonso de Alvarado secured a pardon for everyone who had been affiliated with Aguirre and enlisted in his army. Aguirre fought and was wounded by two musket shots at the Battle of Chuquingua against Girón, resulting in an incurable limp that caused his peers to ostracise him.

===Search for El Dorado===
Together with his daughter Elvira, Aguirre joined the 1560 expedition of Pedro de Ursúa down the Marañón and Amazon Rivers with 300 Spaniards and hundreds of natives. The actual goal of Ursúa was to send idle veterans from the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire away, to keep them from trouble-making. A year later, Aguirre participated in the overthrow and killing of Ursúa and his successor, Fernando de Guzmán, whom he ultimately succeeded. He and his men reached the Atlantic, probably by the Orinoco River. On 23 March 1561, Aguirre urged 186 officers and soldiers to sign a statement acknowledging him as &quot;Prince of Peru, Tierra Firme and Chile&quot;.

In 1561, he seized Isla Margarita and suppressed any opposition to his reign, killing the governor. When he crossed to the mainland in an attempt to take Panama, his open rebellion against the Spanish crown came to an end. He was surrounded at Barquisimeto, Venezuela, where he killed his daughter, Elvira, &quot;because someone that I loved so much should not come to be bedded by uncouth people&quot;. He was eventually captured by royalist forces and shot to death by his own soldier, Custodio Hernandez.

His body was beheaded and cut into quarters, with pieces being sent to nearby towns as a warning. According to the account of Fray Pedro Simón, the skull of Aguirre remained in the town square of Valencia at least forty years after his demise. In a &quot;post-mortem&quot; trial of residence held in El Tocuyo, Aguirre was found guilty of the crime of &quot;Lèse-majesté&quot;. In Mérida and El Tocuyo several of his soldiers were brought to trial, found guilty of the crimes committed and sentenced to death by dismemberment.

==Popular culture==
Aguirre has been portrayed in film three times: by Klaus Kinski in the allegorical film &quot;Aguirre, the Wrath of God&quot; (1972), by Omero Antonutti in &quot;El Dorado&quot; (1988), and by Édgar Ramírez in &quot;Jungle Cruise&quot; (2021).

Aguirre&#x27;s ill-fated voyage is the topic of Robert Southey&#x27;s book &quot;The Expedition of Orsua; and the Crimes of Aguirre&quot; (1821), of Ramón J. Sender&#x27;s 1968 Spanish-language novel &quot;La aventura equinoccial de Lope de Aguirre&quot; () and of Stephen Minta&#x27;s 1995 book &quot;Aguirre: The Re-Creation of a Sixteenth-Century Journey Across South America&quot; (), in which Minta retraces the expedition.

<text>A culture war is a form of cultural conflict (metaphorical &quot;war&quot;) between different social groups who struggle to politically impose their own ideology (moral beliefs, humane virtues, and religious practices) upon mainstream society, or upon the other. In political usage, &quot;culture war&quot; is a metaphor for &quot;hot-button&quot; politics about values and ideologies, realized with intentionally adversarial social narratives meant to provoke political polarization among the mainstream of society over economic matters, such as those of public policy, as well as of consumption. As practical politics, a culture war is about social policy wedge issues that are based on abstract arguments about values, morality, and lifestyle meant to provoke political cleavage in a multicultural society. 

==Etymology==
=== Kulturkampf ===
In the English language, the term &quot;culture war&quot; is a calque of the German word &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; (culture struggle), which refers to an historical event in Germany. The term appears as the title of an 1875 British book review of a German pamphlet.

==Research==

===Criticism and evaluation===

Since the time that James Davison Hunter first applied the concept of culture wars to American life, the idea has been subject to questions about whether &quot;culture wars&quot; names a real phenomenon, and if so, whether the phenomenon it describes is a cause of, or merely a result of, membership in groups like political parties and religions. Culture wars have also been subject to the criticism of being artificial, imposed, or asymmetric conflicts, rather than a result of authentic differences between cultures. Researchers have differed about the scientific validity of the notion of culture war. Some claim it does not describe real behavior, or that it describes only the behavior of a small political elite. Others claim culture war is real and widespread, and even that it is fundamental to explaining Americans&#x27; political behavior and beliefs. A 2023 study on the circulation of conspiracy theories on social media noted that disinformation actors insert polarizing claims in culture wars by taking one side or the other, thus making the adherents circulate and parrot disinformation as a rhetorical ammunition against their perceived opponents.

Political scientist Alan Wolfe participated in a series of scholarly debates in the 1990s and 2000s against Hunter, claiming that Hunter&#x27;s concept of culture wars did not accurately describe the opinions or behavior of Americans, which Wolfe claimed were more united than polarized. A meta-analysis of opinion data from 1992 to 2012 published in the &quot;American Political Science Review&quot; concluded that, in contrast to a common belief that political party and religious membership shape opinion on culture war topics, instead opinions on culture war topics lead people to revise their political party and religious orientations. The researchers view culture war attitudes as &quot;foundational elements in the political and religious belief systems of ordinary citizens.&quot;

====Artificiality or asymmetry====

Some writers and scholars have said that culture wars are created or perpetuated by political special interest groups, by reactionary social movements, by party dynamics, or by electoral politics as a whole. These authors view culture war not as an unavoidable result of widespread cultural differences, but as a technique used to create in-groups and out-groups for a political purpose. Political commentator E. J. Dionne has written that culture war is an electoral technique to exploit differences and grievances, remarking that the real cultural division is &quot;between those who want to have a culture war and those who don&#x27;t.&quot;

Sociologist Scott Melzer says that culture wars are created by conservative, reactive organizations and movements. Members of these movements possess a &quot;sense of victimization at the hands of a liberal culture run amok. In their eyes, immigrants, gays, women, the poor, and other groups are (undeservedly) granted special rights and privileges.&quot; Melzer writes about the example of the National Rifle Association of America, which he says intentionally created a culture war in order to unite conservative groups, particularly groups of white men, against a common perceived threat. Similarly, religion scholar Susan B. Ridgely has written that culture wars were made possible by Focus on the Family. This organization produced conservative Christian &quot;alternative news&quot; that began to bifurcate American media consumption, promoting a particular &quot;traditional family&quot; archetype to one part of the population, particularly conservative religious women. Ridgely says that this tradition was depicted as under liberal attack, seeming to necessitate a culture war to defend the tradition.

Political scientists Matt Grossmann and David A. Hopkins have written about an asymmetry between the US&#x27;s two major political parties, saying the Republican party should be understood as an ideological movement built to wage political conflict, and the Democratic party as a coalition of social groups with less ability to impose ideological discipline on members. This encourages Republicans to perpetuate and to draw new issues into culture wars, because Republicans are well equipped to fight such wars. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;many on the left have argued that such [culture war] battles [a]re &#x27;distractions&#x27; from the real fight over class and economic issues.&quot;

==Culture wars by country==
===United States===
====1920s–1991: Origins====

In American usage, &quot;culture war&quot; may imply a conflict between those values considered traditionalist or conservative and those considered progressive or liberal. This usage originated in the 1920s when urban and rural American values came into closer conflict. This followed several decades of immigration to the States by people who earlier European immigrants considered &#x27;alien&#x27;. It was also a result of the cultural shifts and modernizing trends of the Roaring Twenties, culminating in the presidential campaign of Al Smith in 1928. In subsequent decades during the 20th century, the term was published occasionally in American newspapers. Historian Matthew Dallek argues the John Birch Society (JBS) was an early promoter of culture war ideas. Scholar Celestini Carmen traces the JBS&#x27;s apocalyptic culture war rhetoric through the connections of Christian right leaders such as Tim LaHaye and Phyllis Schlafly to the JBS and their founding of the Moral Majority.

====1991–2001: Rise in prominence====
James Davison Hunter, a sociologist at the University of Virginia, introduced the expression again in his 1991 publication, &quot;Culture Wars: The Struggle to Define America&quot;. Hunter described what he saw as a dramatic realignment and polarization that had transformed American politics and culture. He argued that on an increasing number of &quot;hot-button&quot; defining issues—abortion, gun politics, separation of church and state, privacy, recreational drug use, homosexuality, censorship—there existed two definable polarities. Furthermore, not only were there a number of divisive issues, but society had divided along essentially the same lines on these issues, so as to constitute two warring groups, defined primarily not by nominal religion, ethnicity, social class, or even political affiliation, but rather by ideological world-views. Hunter characterized this polarity as stemming from opposite impulses, toward what he referred to as &quot;Progressivism&quot; and as &quot;Orthodoxy&quot;. Others have adopted the dichotomy with varying labels. For example, Bill O&#x27;Reilly, a conservative political commentator and former host of the Fox News Channel talk show &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;, emphasizes differences between &quot;Secular-Progressives&quot; and &quot;Traditionalists&quot; in his 2006 book &quot;Culture Warrior&quot;.

Historian Kristin Kobes Du Mez attributes the 1990s emergence of culture wars to the end of the Cold War in 1991. She writes that Evangelical Christians viewed a particular Christian masculine gender role as the only defense of America against the threat of communism. When this threat ended upon the close of the Cold War, Evangelical leaders transferred the perceived source of threat from foreign communism to domestic changes in gender roles and sexuality.
During the 1992 presidential election, commentator Pat Buchanan mounted a campaign for the Republican nomination for president against incumbent George H. W. Bush. In a prime-time slot at the 1992 Republican National Convention, Buchanan gave his speech on the culture war. He argued: &quot;There is a religious war going on in our country for the soul of America. It is a cultural war, as critical to the kind of nation we will one day be as was the Cold War itself.&quot; In addition to criticizing environmentalists and feminism, he portrayed public morality as a defining issue:

The agenda [Bill] Clinton and [Hillary] Clinton would impose on America—abortion on demand, a litmus test for the Supreme Court, homosexual rights, discrimination against religious schools, women in combat units—that&#x27;s change, all right. But it is not the kind of change America wants. It is not the kind of change America needs. And it is not the kind of change we can abide in a nation that we still call God&#x27;s country.
A month later, Buchanan characterized the conflict as about power over society&#x27;s definition of right and wrong. He named abortion, sexual orientation and popular culture as major fronts—and mentioned other controversies, including clashes over the Confederate flag, Christmas, and taxpayer-funded art. He also said that the negative attention his &quot;culture war&quot; speech received was itself evidence of America&#x27;s polarization.

The culture war had significant impact on national politics in the 1990s. The rhetoric of the Christian Coalition of America may have weakened president George H. W. Bush&#x27;s chances for re-election in 1992 and helped his successor, Bill Clinton, win reelection in 1996. On the other hand, the rhetoric of conservative cultural warriors helped Republicans gain control of Congress in 1994. The culture wars influenced the debate over state-school history curricula in the United States in the 1990s. In particular, debates over the development of national educational standards in 1994 revolved around whether the study of American history should be a &quot;celebratory&quot; or &quot;critical&quot; undertaking and involved such prominent public figures as Lynne Cheney, Rush Limbaugh, and historian Gary Nash.

====2001–2012: Post-9/11 era====

A political view called neoconservatism shifted the terms of the debate in the early 2000s. Neoconservatives differed from their opponents in that they interpreted problems facing the nation as moral issues rather than economic or political ones. For example, neoconservatives saw the decline of the traditional family structure as well as the decline of religion in American society as spiritual crises that required a spiritual response. Critics accused neoconservatives of confusing cause and effect.

During the 2000s, voting for Republicans began to correlate heavily with traditionalist or orthodox religious belief across diverse religious sects. Voting for Democrats became more correlated with liberal or modernist religious belief, and with being nonreligious. Belief in scientific conclusions, such as climate change, also became tightly coupled with political party affiliation in this era, causing climate scholar Andrew Hoffman to observe that climate change had &quot;become enmeshed in the so-called culture wars.&quot;
Topics traditionally associated with culture war were not prominent in media coverage of the 2008 election season, with the exception of coverage of vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, who drew attention to her conservative religion and created a performative climate change denialism brand for herself. Palin&#x27;s defeat in the election and subsequent resignation as governor of Alaska caused the Center for American Progress to predict &quot;the coming end of the culture wars,&quot; which they attributed to demographic change, particularly high rates of acceptance of same-sex marriage among millennials.

====2012–present: Broadening of the culture war====
In the early 2010s, the American Left pushed further against established social norms. While the American right took issue with the perceived worldwide dominance of leftism in international politics and corporate activity, anti-nationalism, and secular human rights policies and activism not based on Abrahamic religious worldviews. 

While traditional culture war issues, like abortion, continue to be a focal point, the issues identified with the culture war broadened and intensified in the mid-late 2010s. Jonathan Haidt, author of &quot;The Coddling of the American Mind&quot;, identified a rise in cancel culture via social media among young progressives since 2012, which he believes had &quot;transformative effects on university life and later on politics and culture throughout the English-speaking world,&quot; in what Haidt and other commentators have called the &quot;Great Awokening&quot;. Journalist Michael Grunwald says that &quot;President Donald Trump has pioneered a new politics of perpetual culture war&quot; and lists Black Lives Matter, U.S. national anthem protests, climate change, education policy, healthcare policy including Obamacare, and infrastructure policy as culture war issues in 2018. The rights of transgender people and the role of religion in lawmaking were identified as &quot;new fronts in the culture war&quot; by political scientist Jeremiah Castle, as the polarization of public opinion on these two topics resembles that of previous culture war issues. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, North Dakota governor Doug Burgum described opposition to wearing face masks as a &quot;senseless&quot; culture war issue that jeopardizes human safety.

This broader understanding of culture war issues in the mid-late 2010s and 2020s is associated with a political strategy called &quot;owning the libs.&quot; Conservative media figures employing this strategy emphasize and expand upon culture war issues with the goal of upsetting liberals. According to Nicole Hemmer of Columbia University, this strategy is a substitute for the cohesive conservative ideology that existed during the Cold War. It holds a conservative voting bloc together in the absence of shared policy preferences among the bloc&#x27;s members.

A number of conflicts about diversity in popular culture occurring in the 2010s, such as the Gamergate controversy, Comicsgate and the Sad Puppies science fiction voting campaign, were identified in the media as being examples of the culture war. Journalist Caitlin Dewey described Gamergate as a &quot;proxy war&quot; for a larger culture war between those who want greater inclusion of women and minorities in cultural institutions versus anti-feminists and traditionalists who do not. The perception that culture war conflict had been demoted from electoral politics to popular culture led writer Jack Meserve to call popular movies, games, and writing the &quot;last front in the culture war&quot; in 2015.

These conflicts about representation in popular culture re-emerged into electoral politics via the alt-right and alt-lite movements. According to media scholar Whitney Phillips, Gamergate &quot;prototyped&quot; strategies of harassment and controversy-stoking that proved useful in political strategy. For example, Republican political strategist Steve Bannon publicized pop-culture conflicts during the 2016 presidential campaign of Donald Trump, encouraging a young audience to &quot;come in through Gamergate or whatever and then get turned onto politics and Trump.&quot;

===Canada===

Some observers in Canada have used the term &quot;culture war&quot; to refer to differing values between Western versus Eastern Canada, urban versus rural Canada, as well as conservatism versus liberalism and progressivism. The phrase has also been used to describe the Harper government&#x27;s attitude towards the arts community. Andrew Coyne termed this negative policy towards the arts community as &quot;class warfare.&quot;

===Australia===

During the tenure of the Liberal–National Coalition government of 1996 to 2007, interpretations of Aboriginal history became a part of a wider political debate regarding Australian national pride and symbolism occasionally called the &quot;culture wars&quot;, more often the &quot;history wars&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manne11/08&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This debate extended into a controversy over the presentation of history in the National Museum of Australia and in high-school history curricula. It also migrated into the general Australian media, with major broadsheets such as &quot;The Australian&quot;, &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; and &quot;The Age&quot; regularly publishing opinion pieces on the topic. Marcia Langton has referred to much of this wider debate as &quot;war porn&quot; and as an &quot;intellectual dead end&quot;.

Two Australian Prime Ministers, Paul Keating (in office 1991–1996) and John Howard (in office 1996–2007), became major participants in the &quot;wars&quot;. According to Mark McKenna&#x27;s analysis for the Australian Parliamentary Library, John Howard believed that Paul Keating portrayed Australia pre-Whitlam (Prime Minister from 1972 to 1975) in an unduly negative light; while Keating sought to distance the modern Labor movement from its historical support for the monarchy and for the White Australia policy by arguing that it was the conservative Australian parties which had been barriers to national progress. He accused Britain of having abandoned Australia during the Second World War. Keating staunchly supported a symbolic apology to Australian Aboriginals for their mistreatment at the hands of previous administrations, and outlined his view of the origins and potential solutions to contemporary Aboriginal disadvantage in his Redfern Park Speech of 10 December 1992 (drafted with the assistance of historian Don Watson). In 1999, following the release of the 1998 &quot;Bringing Them Home&quot; Report, Howard passed a Parliamentary Motion of Reconciliation describing treatment of Aborigines as the &quot;most blemished chapter&quot; in Australian history, but he refused to issue an official apology. Howard saw an apology as inappropriate as it would imply &quot;intergeneration guilt&quot;; he said that &quot;practical&quot; measures were a better response to contemporary Aboriginal disadvantage. Keating has argued for the eradication of remaining symbols linked to colonial origins: including deference for ANZAC Day, for the Australian flag and for the monarchy in Australia, while Howard supported these institutions. Unlike fellow Labor leaders and contemporaries, Bob Hawke (Prime Minister 1983–1991) and Kim Beazley (Labor Party leader 2005–2006), Keating never traveled to Gallipoli for ANZAC Day ceremonies. In 2008 he described those who gathered there as &quot;misguided&quot;.

In 2006 John Howard said in a speech to mark the 50th anniversary of &quot;Quadrant&quot; that &quot;Political Correctness&quot; was dead in Australia but: &quot;we should not underestimate the degree to which the soft-left still holds sway, even dominance, especially in Australia&#x27;s universities&quot;. Also in 2006, &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; political editor Peter Hartcher reported that Opposition foreign-affairs spokesman Kevin Rudd was entering the philosophical debate by arguing in response that &quot;John Howard, is guilty of perpetrating &#x27;a fraud&#x27; in his so-called culture wars ... designed not to make real change but to mask the damage inflicted by the Government&#x27;s economic policies&quot;.

The defeat of the Howard government in the Australian Federal election of 2007 and its replacement by the Rudd Labor government altered the dynamic of the debate. Rudd made an official apology to the Aboriginal &quot;Stolen Generation&quot; with bi-partisan support. Like Keating, Rudd supported an Australian republic, but in contrast to Keating, Rudd declared support for the Australian flag and supported the commemoration of ANZAC Day; he also expressed admiration for Liberal Party founder Robert Menzies. Subsequent to the 2007 change of government, and prior to the passage, with support from all parties, of the Parliamentary apology to indigenous Australians, Professor of Australian Studies Richard Nile argued: &quot;the culture and history wars are over and with them should also go the adversarial nature of intellectual debate&quot;, a view contested by others, including conservative commentator Janet Albrechtsen. Climate change in Australia is also considered a highly divisive or politically controversial topic, to the point it is sometimes called a &quot;culture war&quot;. 
Since the defeat of the 2023 Australian Indigenous Voice referendum, there has been a significant calls reignited from Conservative Politicians and Commentators to oppose or scale down Indigenous Reconciliation, viewing policies like Welcome to Country ceremonies and placing the Aboriginal and Torres Strait flags alongside the National Flag as &#x27;divisive&#x27;. 

===African continent===

According to political scientist Constance G. Anthony, American culture war perspectives on human sexuality were exported to Africa as a form of neocolonialism. In his view, this began during the AIDS epidemic in Africa, with the United States government first tying HIV/AIDS assistance money to evangelical leadership and the Christian right during the Bush administration, then to LGBTQ tolerance during the administration of Barack Obama. This stoked a culture war that resulted in (among others) the &quot;Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Act&quot; of 2014.

Zambian scholar Kapya Kaoma notes that because &quot;the demographic center of Christianity is shifting from the global North to the global South&quot; Africa&#x27;s influence on Christianity worldwide is increasing. American conservatives export their culture wars to Africa, Kaoma says, particularly when they realize they may be losing the battle back home. US Christians have framed their anti-LGBT initiatives in Africa as standing in opposition to a &quot;Western gay agenda&quot;, a framing which Kaoma finds ironic.

North American and European conspiracy theories have become widespread in West Africa via social media, according to 2021 survey by &quot;First Draft News&quot;. COVID-19 misinformation, New World Order conspiracy thinking, QAnon and other conspiracy theories associated with culture war topics are spread by American, Pro-Russian, French-language, and local disinformation websites and social media accounts, including prominent politicians in Nigeria. This has contributed to vaccine hesitancy in West Africa, with 60 percent of survey respondents saying they were unlikely to try to get vaccinated, and an erosion of trust in institutions in the region.

===United Kingdom===
A 2021 report from King&#x27;s College London argued that many people&#x27;s views on cultural issues in Britain had become tied up with the side of the Brexit debate with which they identify, while the public party-political identities, although not as strong, show similar alignments and that around half the country held relatively strong views on &quot;culture war&quot; issues such as debates on Britain&#x27;s colonial history or Black Lives Matter; however, the report concluded Britain&#x27;s cultural and political divide was not as stark as the Republican–Democratic divide in the US and that a sizeable section of the public can be categorised as having either moderate views or as being disengaged from social debates. It also found that &quot;The Guardian&quot;, as opposed to the centre-right newspapers, was more likely to talk about the culture wars.

The Conservative Party have been described as attempting to ignite culture wars in regard to &quot;conservative values&quot; under the tenure of Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Others argue that it is the left who are engaging in &quot;culture wars&quot;, particularly against liberal values, accepted words, and British institutions. Observers such as Johns Hopkins University professor Yascha Mounk and journalist and author Louise Perry have argued that the collapse in support for the Labour Party during the 2019 United Kingdom general election came as a result of both a media-induced public perception and a deliberate strategy of Labour of pursuing messages and policy ideas based on cultural issues that resonated with more university educated grassroots activists on the left of the party but alienated Labour&#x27;s traditional working class voters.

An April 2022 survey found evidence that Britons are less divided on &quot;culture war&quot; issues than has often been portrayed in the media. The greatest predictor of opinion was how people voted in the UK&#x27;s referendum on membership of the European Union, Brexit, yet even among those who voted Leave, 75% agreed &quot;it is important to be attentive to issues of race and social justice&quot;. Similarly, even among Remainers and those who last voted for the Labour Party, there was moderately strong support for several socially conservative positions.

===Turkey===

===Europe===

Several politicians, such as Poland&#x27;s Law and Justice party, Hungary&#x27;s Viktor Orbán, Serbia&#x27;s Aleksandar Vučić, and Slovenia&#x27;s Janez Janša, have been accused of fomenting culture wars in their respective countries by encouraging dissent, resistance to LGBT rights, and restrictions on abortion. One facet of the controversy in Poland is the removal of Soviet War Memorials, which is divisive because some Poles viewed the memorials positively as commemorations of their ancestors who died during World War II, while others felt negatively due to the oppression that some Poles experienced under the Soviet-backed Polish People&#x27;s Republic. Culture war in Hungary is alleged by Kim Scheppele to be a disguise for democratic backsliding by Orbán. Ukraine also experienced a decades-long culture war pitting the eastern, predominately Russian-speaking, regions against the western Ukrainian-speaking areas of the country. LGBT rights are controversial in Poland, as exemplified by President Andrzej Duda&#x27;s vow in 2020 to oppose both same-sex marriage and LGBT adoption.

Different interpretations of bitter events during World War II have become especially contentious in Poland since 2015, shortly after the start of the Russo-Ukrainian War. One disputed issue is whether Poland bears any responsibility for the Holocaust, or whether Poland was entirely a victim of Nazi Germany. This dispute is embodied by the &quot;Polish death camp&quot; controversy (involving concentration camps that had been built by Nazi Germany during World War II on German-occupied Polish soil) and an attempt to address that controversy with a now partly repealed law. A second issue, also addressed by the partly repealed law, revolves around Poland–Ukraine relations. In the region, in passing a law to criminalize negative interpretations of the country&#x27;s collaborationist nationalist movements during World War II, Poland is not alone, and Poland–Ukraine relations have suffered as a result of a similar law in Ukraine that was criticized in Poland for deflecting blame away from the Ukrainian Insurgent Army and their massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia.

<text>The Beeching cuts, also colloquially referred to as the Beeching Axe, were a major series of route closures and service changes made as part of the restructuring of the nationalised railway system in Great Britain in the 1960s. They are named for Dr. Richard Beeching, then-chair of the British Railways Board and the author of two reportsThe Reshaping of British Railways (1963) and The Development of the Major Railway Trunk Routes (1965)that outlined the necessity of improving the efficiency of the railways and the plan for achieving this through restructuring.

The first report identified 2,363 stations and of railway line for closure, amounting to 55% of stations, 30% of route miles, and the loss of 67,700 British Rail jobs, with an objective of stemming the large losses being incurred during a period of increasing competition from road transport and reducing the rail subsidies necessary to keep the network running. The second report identified a small number of major routes for significant investment. Such was the scale of these cuts that the programme came to be colloquially referred to as the Beeching Axe, though the 1963 report also recommended some less well-publicised changes; including a switch to the now-standard practice of containerisation for rail freight, and the replacement of some services with integrated bus services linked to the remaining railheads.

Protests resulted in the saving of some stations and lines, but the majority were closed as planned. Beeching&#x27;s name remains associated with the mass closure of railways and the loss of many local services in the period that followed. A few of these routes have since reopened. Some short sections have been preserved as heritage railways, while others have been incorporated into the National Cycle Network or used for road schemes. Others have since been built over, have reverted to farmland, or remain derelict with no plans for any reuse or redevelopment. Some, such as the bulk of the Midland Metro network around Birmingham and Wolverhampton, have since been incorporated into light rail lines.

==Background==

After growing rapidly in the 19th century during the Railway Mania, the British railway system reached its height in the years immediately before the First World War, with a network of . The network had opened up major travel opportunities for the entire country that had never been available before. However, lines were sometimes uneconomic, and several Members of Parliament had direct involvement with railways, creating a conflict of interest. In 1909, Winston Churchill, then President of the Board of Trade, argued that the country&#x27;s railways did not have a future without rationalisation and amalgamation. By 1914, the railways had some significant problems, such as a lack of standard rolling stock and too many duplicated routes.

After the war, the railways faced increasing competition from a growing road transport network, which had increased to 8 million tons of freight annually by 1921. Around of passenger railways closed between 1923 and 1939. These closures included the Charnwood Forest Railway, closed to passengers in 1931, and the Harborne Line in Birmingham, closed to passengers in 1934. Some lines had never been profitable and were not subject to loss of traffic in that period. The railways were busy during the Second World War, but at the end of the war they were in a poor state of repair and in 1948 nationalised as British Railways.

The Branch Lines Committee of the British Transport Commission (BTC) was formed in 1949 with a brief to close the least-used branch lines. This resulted in the loss (or conversion to freight-only operation) of some of railway between 1948 and 1962. The most significant closure was that of the former Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway in 1959. In opposition to these cuts, the period also witnessed the beginning of a protest movement led by the Railway Development Association, whose most famous member was the poet John Betjeman. They went on to be a significant force resisting the Beeching proposals.

Economic recovery and the end of petrol rationing led to rapid growth in car ownership and use. Vehicle mileage grew at a sustained annual rate of 10% between 1948 and 1964. In contrast, railway traffic remained steady during the 1950s but the economic situation steadily deteriorated, with labour costs rising faster than income and fares and freight charges repeatedly frozen by the government to try to control inflation. By 1955, the railways&#x27; share of the transport market had dropped from 16% to 5%.

The 1955 Modernisation Plan promised expenditure of over £1,240 million; steam locomotives would be replaced with diesel and electric locomotives, traffic levels would increase, and the system was predicted to be back in profit by 1962. Instead losses mounted, from £68 million in 1960 to £87 million in 1961, and £104 million in 1962 (£ billion in terms). The BTC could no longer pay the interest on its loans.

By 1961, losses were running at £300,000 a day, despite the fact that since nationalisation in 1948, of line had been closed, railway staff numbers had fallen 26% from 648,000 to 474,000, and the number of railway wagons had fallen 29% from 1,200,000 to 848,000.

==The Beeching reports==

=== &quot;The Reshaping of British Railways&quot; (Beeching I) ===

The first Beeching report, titled &quot;The Reshaping of British Railways&quot;, was published on 27 March 1963.

The report starts by quoting the brief provided by the Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan, from 1960: &quot;First, the industry must be of a size and pattern suited to modern conditions and prospects. In particular, the railway system must be modelled to meet current needs, and the modernisation plan must be adapted to this new shape&quot; and with the premise that the railways should be run as a profitable business.

Beeching first studied traffic flows on all lines to identify &quot;the good, the bad, and the indifferent&quot;. His analysis showed that the least-used 1,762 stations had annual passenger receipts of less than £2,500 each (£ as of ), that over half of the 4,300 stations open to passengers in 1960 had receipts of less than £10,000, that the least-used 50% of stations contributed only 2% of passenger revenue, and that one third of route miles carried just 1% of passengers.

By way of example, he noted that the line from Thetford to Swaffham carried five trains each weekday in each direction, carrying an average of nine passengers with only 10% of the costs of operating the line covered by fares; another example was the Gleneagles-Crieff-Comrie line which had ten trains a day and five passengers on average, earning only 25% of costs. Finally there was the service from Hull to York via Beverley (using part of the Yorkshire Coast Line, which was not closed, and the York to Beverley Line, which was). The line covered 80% of its operating costs, but he calculated that it could be closed because there was an alternative, albeit less direct, route.

Out of of railway, Beeching recommended that —mostly rural and industrial lines—should be closed entirely, and that some of the remaining lines should be kept open only for freight. A total of 2,363 stations were to close, including 435 already under threat, both on lines that were to close and on lines that were to remain open.

He recommended that freight services should mainly be for bulk commodities such as minerals and coal, and that the freight system make use of new containerised handling systems rather than less efficient and slower wagon-load traffic. The latter recommendation would prove prescient with the rise of intermodal freight transport in the following decades.

===&quot;The Development of the Major Railway Trunk Routes&quot; (Beeching II)===
On 16 February 1965, Beeching introduced the second stage of his reorganisation of the railways. In his report, &quot;The Development of the Major Railway Trunk Routes&quot;, he set out his conclusion that of the of trunk railway only &quot;should be selected for future development&quot; and invested in.

This policy would result in long-distance traffic being routed along nine lines. Traffic to Coventry, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and Scotland would be routed through the West Coast Main Line to Carlisle and Glasgow; traffic to the north-east of England would be concentrated through the East Coast Main Line as far as Newcastle; and traffic to Wales and the West Country would go on the Great Western Main Line to Swansea and Plymouth.

Underpinning Beeching&#x27;s proposals was his belief that there was too much duplication in the railway network: &quot;The real choice is between an excessive and increasingly un-economic system, with a corresponding tendency for the railways as a whole to fall into disrepute and decay, or the selective development and intensive utilisation of a more limited trunk route system&quot;. Of the of trunk route, involves a choice between two routes, a choice of three, and over a further a choice of four. In Scotland, only the Central Belt routes and the lines via Fife and Perth to Aberdeen were selected for development, and none were selected in Wales, apart from the Great Western Main Line as far as Swansea.

Beeching&#x27;s secondment from ICI ended early in June 1965 after Harold Wilson&#x27;s attempt to get him to produce a transport plan failed. It is a matter of debate whether Beeching left by mutual arrangement with the government or if he was sacked. Frank Cousins, the Labour Minister of Technology, told the House of Commons in November 1965 that Beeching had been dismissed by Tom Fraser, then Minister of Transport. Beeching denied this, pointing out that he had returned early to ICI as he would not have had enough time to undertake an in-depth transport study before the formal end of his secondment.

==The closures==
The first report was accepted by the Conservative government of the day, which argued that many services could be provided more effectively by buses. Most recommendations were subsequently taken forward by the Labour government elected in 1964, but many of the proposed closures sparked protests from communities that would lose their trains, a number of which (especially rural communities) had no other public transport.

Line closures had been running at about 150–300 miles per year between 1950 and 1961. They peaked at in 1964 and came to a virtual halt by the early 1970s. One of the last major closures was the 98-mile (158 km) Waverley Route between Carlisle, Hawick and Edinburgh in 1969; the reopening of a 35-mile section of this line was approved in 2006 and passenger services resumed in September 2015.

Holiday and coastal resorts were severely affected by the closures. The report recommended closing almost all services along the coasts of north Devon, Cornwall and East Anglia aside from Norwich to Great Yarmouth. All services on the Isle of Wight were recommended for closure, as were all branch lines in the Lake District. One of the most significant closures was the Great Central Main Line from London Marylebone to Leicester and Sheffield.

Not all the recommended closures were implemented. Reprieved lines include:
* Lines through the Scottish Highlands, such as the Far North Line, were kept open, in part because of pressure from the powerful Highland lobby.
* The Central Wales Line was said to have been kept open because it passed through so many marginal constituencies that no-one dared to close it.
* The Tamar Valley Line, between Gunnislake and Plymouth, was kept open because the local road network was poor, with no direct route from the towns served to Plymouth.
* The Marshlink line between Ashford and Hastings remained open because of problems running a replacement bus service with the existing network.
* Other routes (or parts of routes) planned for closure that survived include the Settle-Carlisle line, Ipswich–Lowestoft, the Hope Valley line, the Buxton line, the Avocet line, Ayr–Stranraer, Glasgow–Kilmarnock, Glasgow–Edinburgh via Shotts, Barrow–Whitehaven, Middlesbrough–Whitby, York–Harrogate, Leeds/Bradford–Ilkley, Nottingham–Lincoln, Boston–Skegness, Birkenhead–Wrexham, Liverpool–Southport (and other Merseyside commuter routes), Bury-Manchester, Leicester–Peterborough, St Erth–St Ives, and Ryde–Shanklin.

The Beeching Report was intended to be the first stage in the rail network&#x27;s contraction. As a result, some lines it had not recommended for closure were subsequently shut down, such as the Woodhead line between Manchester and Sheffield in 1981, after the decline of the freight traffic (mostly coal) on which it had relied. Many surviving lines were rationalised, including reduction to single track and consolidation of signals. Most of the Oxford–Cambridge Varsity Line closed despite its strategic location serving Milton Keynes, Britain&#x27;s largest &quot;new town&quot;. Kinross-shire, and Fife especially, suffered closures not included in the Report, including the main line from Edinburgh to Perth. King&#x27;s Lynn was to have remained at the centre of routes towards Norwich, Hunstanton and Wisbech, all of which closed.

With a few exceptions, after the early 1970s proposals to close other lines were met with vociferous public opposition and were shelved.

==Critical analysis==

=== Disposals of land and structures ===


Beeching&#x27;s reports made no recommendations about the handling of land after closures. British Rail operated a policy of disposing of land that was surplus to requirements. Many bridges, cuttings and embankments have been removed and the land sold for development. Closed station buildings on remaining lines have often been demolished or sold for housing or other purposes. Increasing pressure on land use meant that protection of closed trackbeds, as in other countries, such as the US Rail Bank scheme, which holds former railway land for possible future use, was not seen to be practical.

Many redundant structures from closed lines remain, such as bridges over other lines and drainage culverts. They often require maintenance as part of the rail infrastructure while providing no benefit. Critics of Beeching argue that the lack of recommendations on the handling of closed railway property demonstrates that the report was short-sighted. On the other hand, retaining a railway on these routes, which would obviously have increased maintenance costs, might not have earned enough to justify that greater cost. As demand for rail has grown since the 1990s, the failure to preserve the routes of closed lines, such as the one between Bedford and Cambridge, which was closed despite Beeching recommending its retention, has been criticised.

===Acceptance of rail subsidies===
By 1968, the railways had not been restored to profitability and Beeching&#x27;s approach appeared to many to have failed. It has been suggested that by closing almost a third of the network Beeching achieved a saving of just £30 million, whilst overall losses were running in excess of £100 million per year. However, the precise savings from closures are impossible to calculate. The Ministry of Transport subsequently estimated that rail operating costs had been cut by over £100 million in the wake of the Beeching Report but that much of this had been swallowed up by increased wages. Some of the branches closed acted as feeders to the main lines, and that feeder traffic was lost when the branches closed; the financial significance of this is debatable, for over 90% of the railways&#x27; 1960 traffic was carried on lines which remained open ten years later.

Whatever the figures, towards the end of the 1960s it became increasingly clear that rail closures were not bringing the rail system out of deficit and were unlikely ever to do so. Transport minister Barbara Castle decided that some rail services, which could not pay their way but had a valuable social role, should be subsidised. Legislation allowing this was introduced in the Transport Act 1968. Section 39 made provision for a subsidy to be paid by the Treasury for a three-year period. This was later repealed in the Railways Act 1974. Whether these subsidies affected the size of the network is questionable: the criteria for reprieving loss-making lines had not altered, merely the way their costs appeared in the railways accounts—previously their contribution to the railways&#x27; overall loss was hidden in the total deficit.

===Replacement buses and proposed alternatives===
The &quot;bustitution&quot; policy that replaced rail services with buses also failed. In many cases the replacement bus services were slower and less convenient than the trains they were meant to replace, and so were unpopular. Replacement bus services were often run between the (now disused) station sites (some of which were some distance from the population centres they served), thus losing any potential advantage over the closed rail service. Most replacement bus services lasted less than two years before they were removed due to a lack of patronage, leaving large parts of the country with no public transport.

The assumption at the time was that car owners would drive to the nearest railhead (which was usually the junction where the closed branch line would otherwise have taken them) and continue their journey onwards by train. In practice, having left home in their cars, people used them for the whole journey. Similarly for freight: without branch lines, the railways&#x27; ability to transport goods &quot;door to door&quot; was dramatically reduced. As in the passenger model, it was assumed that lorries would pick up goods and transport them to the nearest railhead, where they would be taken across the country by train, unloaded onto another lorry and taken to their destination. The development of the motorway network, the advent of containerisation, improvements in lorries and the economic costs of having two break-bulk points combined to make long-distance road transport a more viable alternative.

Many of the closed lines had run at only a small deficit. Some lines such as the Sunderland-to-West Hartlepool line cost only £291 per mile to operate. Closures of such small-scale loss-making lines made little difference to the overall deficit.

Possible changes to light railway-type operations were attacked by Beeching, who rejected all proposals for cost savings that would not make a route profitable: &quot;Similarly, consideration of the cost figures will show that thinning out the trains, or thinning out the stations, would not make a service self-supporting even if it had no adverse effect on revenue&quot;. There is little in the Beeching report recommending general economies (in administration costs, working practices and so on). For example, a number of the stations that were closed were fully staffed 18 hours a day, on lines controlled by multiple Victorian era signalboxes (again fully staffed, often throughout the day). Operating costs could have been reduced by reducing staff and removing redundant services on these lines while keeping the stations open. This has since been successfully achieved by British Rail and its successors on lesser-used lines that survived the cuts, such as the East Suffolk Line from Ipswich to Lowestoft, which survives as a &quot;basic railway&quot;.

The Marshlink line between and , threatened with closure in the Beeching Report, is now seen as important due to the opening of the Channel Tunnel and High Speed 1. Traffic on the single-track Golden Valley Line between Kemble and Swindon and the Cotswold Line between Oxford and Worcester has increased significantly, and double track has now been reinstated on the Golden Valley Line, partly to facilitate a diversionary route during electrification and other works on the Severn tunnel line.

===The people and the politics===
The Conservatives increased their Commons majority in the general election of 8 October 1959, their first with Harold Macmillan as Prime Minister. Ernest Marples, previously Postmaster General, was made Transport Minister two weeks later in a cabinet reshuffle; Macmillan noted that the Northern working-class boy who had won a scholarship to a grammar school was one of only two &quot;self-made men&quot; in his cabinet.

Marples had a background with a successful road construction company. When opening the M1 motorway, he said: &quot;This motorway starts a new era in road travel. It is in keeping with the bold scientific age in which we live. It is a powerful weapon to add to our transport system.&quot; His association with the high-profile construction company Marples Ridgway became a matter of concern to both the public and politicians. As is customary, he resigned as a director of the company in 1951 on becoming a junior minister, but he only disposed of his shares in the company in 1960 after the company won a contract to build the Hammersmith Flyover, when questions were asked both in the media and also in the Commons on 28 January 1960; he made a statement to the House later that day confirming that the sale of shares was in hand and would be completed &quot;very soon&quot;, noting that as part of the agreement he could be required to buy the shares from the purchaser at the original price after he ceased to hold office, if so desired by the purchaser. While it was reported that he sold the shares to his wife, she denied in a newspaper interview, that any transaction had taken place. It was reported that he had transferred his shares into an Overseas Trust. In July 1964, Marples Ridgway and Partners Limited were awarded a £4.1 million contract for the &quot;Hendon Urban Motorway&quot; extension of the M1, in the same year that the company was taken over by the Bath and Portland Group. There was no evidence of any wrongdoing on anyone&#x27;s part in this or any of the other contracts awarded to the company during his term of office, but it did lead to a sense of unease, not least within the railway sector.

In April 1960, Sir Ivan Stedeford established an advisory group known as the Stedeford Committee at the request of Harold Macmillan to report on the state of the British Transport Commission and to make recommendations. Sir Ewart Smith, a retired former Chief Engineer at Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), was asked by Ernest Marples to become a member of an advisory group; Smith declined but recommended Richard Beeching in his place, a suggestion that Marples accepted. Beeching, who held a PhD in physics, had been appointed to the main board of ICI at the age of 43. The board consisted of senior figures in British businesses, and none of the board had previous knowledge or experience of the railway industry. Stedeford and Beeching clashed on a number of issues, but the future size of the railway system was not one of them. For all the suspicion it aroused, the committee had little to say on this and the government was already convinced of the need to reduce the size of the rail network. In spite of questions being asked in Parliament, Sir Ivan&#x27;s report was not published at the time. In December 1960 questions were asked in the Lords about this &quot;secret&quot; and &quot;under-the-counter&quot; study group, criticising the continued withholding of the report and its recommendations. It was later suggested that Stedeford had recommended that the government should set up another body &quot;to consider the size and pattern of the railway system required to meet current and foreseeable needs, in the light of developments and trends in other forms of transport ... and other relevant considerations&quot;.

Marples then appointed Beeching as Chairman of the British Transport Commission in March 1961. He would receive the same yearly salary that he was earning at ICI, the controversial sum of £24,000 (£,000 in terms), £10,000 more than Sir Brian Robertson, the previous chairman of the BTC, £14,000 more than Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, and two-and-a-half times higher than the salary of any head of a nationalised industry at the time. At that time the government was seeking outside talent to sort out the huge problems of the railway network, and he was confident that he could make the railways pay for themselves, but his salary, at 35 times that of many railway workers, has been described as a &quot;political disaster&quot;.

The Transport Act 1962 dissolved the British Transport Commission (BTC), which had overseen the railways, canals and road freight transport and established the British Railways Board, which took over on 1 January 1963, with Dr Beeching as its first chairman. The Act put in place measures that simplified the process of closing railways by removing the need for the pros and cons of each case to be heard in detail. It was described as the &quot;most momentous piece of legislation in the field of railway law to have been enacted since the Railway and Canal Traffic Act 1854&quot;.

The general election in October 1964 returned a Labour government under Prime Minister Harold Wilson after 13 years of Conservative government. During the election campaign Labour had promised to halt rail closures if elected, but it quickly backtracked, and later oversaw some of the most controversial closures. Tom Fraser was appointed Minister of Transport, but was replaced by Barbara Castle in December 1965. Castle published a map in 1967, &quot;Network for Development&quot;, showing the railway system &quot;stabilised&quot; at around 11,000 route miles (17,700 km).

Section 39 of the Transport Act 1968 made provision for grants to be paid in relation to loss-making lines and services, but many of the services and railway lines that would have qualified had already been closed. A number of branch lines and local services were saved by this legislation.

After 1970, when the Conservatives were returned to power, serious thought was given to a further programme of closures, but this proved politically impossible. In 1982, under the government of Margaret Thatcher, Sir David Serpell, a civil servant who had worked with Beeching, compiled the Serpell Report which said that a profitable railway could be achieved only by closing much of what remained. The report&#x27;s infamous &quot;Option A&quot; proposed greatly increasing fares and reducing the rail network to a mere , leaving only of railway in Wales (a section of the South Wales Main Line from the Severn Tunnel to ) and none in Somerset, Devon or Cornwall. The Midland Main Line was planned to close, leaving Leicester and Derby without a rail link, while the East Coast Main Line, part of the key London/Edinburgh link, was intended to be cut north of Newcastle. The report was published on 20 January 1983 and received an immediate backlash from the media. It was quietly shelved in the run up to the 1983 election.

Ian Hislop comments that history has been somewhat unkind to &quot;Britain&#x27;s most hated civil servant&quot;, by forgetting that Beeching proposed a much better bus service that ministers never delivered, and that in some ways he was used to do their &quot;dirty work for them&quot;. Hislop describes him as &quot;a technocrat [who] wasn&#x27;t open to argument to romantic notions of rural England or the warp and weft of the train in our national identity. He didn&#x27;t buy any of that. He went for a straightforward profit and loss approach and some claim we are still reeling from that today&quot;. Beeching was unrepentant about his role in the closures: &quot;I suppose I&#x27;ll always be looked upon as the axe man, but it was surgery, not mad chopping&quot;.

On 7 June 2019, former Minister for Transport Andrew Adonis delivered a speech on &quot;Reversing Beeching&quot;.

== Reopenings ==


Since the Beeching cuts, road traffic levels have grown significantly. As well, since privatisation in the mid-1990s, there have been record levels of passengers on the railways owing to a preference to living in smaller towns and rural areas, and in turn commuting longer distances (although the cause of this is disputed). A few of the railway closures have been reversed. However, despite the considerable increase in railway journeys since the mid-1990s, rail transport&#x27;s share of the total passenger transport market remains below that of the early 1960s, with road overwhelmingly the dominant mode: rail&#x27;s market share was 13% in 1961, 6% in 1991 and 2001, and 10% in 2014.

Some closed stations have reopened, and passenger services have been restored on a few lines where they had been removed.

===Heritage railways===

Some lines closed under the Beeching cuts have reopened as private heritage railways. Some examples are East Lancs Railway, Great Central Railway (heritage railway), Mid Hants Railway, North Yorkshire Moors Railway, North Norfolk Railway and West Somerset Railway.

==In popular culture==
Flanders and Swann, writers and performers of satirical songs, wrote a lament for lines closed by the Beeching cuts entitled &quot;Slow Train&quot; (1963). Michael Williams&#x27; book &quot;On the slow train&quot; takes its name from the Flanders and Swann song. It celebrates 12 of the most beautiful and historic journeys in Britain, some of which were saved from the Beeching cuts. It perpetuated the myth that the Beeching cuts were concerned solely with sleepy rural branch lines, but they actually also concerned well-used &quot;industrial&quot; and commuter lines.

The BBC TV comedy series &quot;Oh, Doctor Beeching!&quot;, broadcast from 1995 to 1997, was set at a small fictional branch-line railway station threatened with closure under the Beeching cuts.

In the satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot;, the &quot;Signal Failures&quot; column on railway issues is written under the pseudonym &quot;Dr. B. Ching&quot;.

The lyrics of the I Like Trains song &quot;The Beeching Report&quot; are a criticism of Dr Beeching and the Beeching cuts.

==Closures by year==

The list below shows over of closures:

After this period, &quot;residual&quot; Beeching closures took place: Bridport to Maiden Newton in 1975, Alston to Haltwhistle in 1976, and Woodside to Selsdon in 1983.

<doc id="181324" wikidata="Q2656026" url="?curid=181324" title="Heidelberg Appeal">
<text>The Heidelberg Appeal, authored by , was an appeal directed against the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The Heidelberg Appeal&#x27;s goal was similar to the later published Leipzig Declaration. Before the publication, Fred Singer, who has initiated several petitions like the Heidelberg Appeal, and Michel Salomon, had organized a conference in Heidelberg, which led to that document. It was published on the last day of the 1992 Rio Summit, and warned against basing environmental policies on what the authors described as &quot;pseudoscientific arguments or false and nonrelevant data.&quot; It was initiated by the tobacco and asbestos industries, to support the climate-denying Global Climate Coalition. According to SourceWatch the appeal was &quot;a scam perpetrated by the asbestos and tobacco industries in support of the Global Climate Coalition&quot;. Both industries had no direct reason to deny global warming, but rather wanted to promote their &quot;sound science&quot; agenda, which basically states that industry-funded science is good science and science contradicting those science (such as environmental science) is bad science or &quot;junk science&quot;.

== Originator ==

Michel Salomon was the editor of the Paris-based &quot;Projections&quot; magazine. They had already been successful with:
* TASSC (The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition) in the US under Steven Milloy,
* SEPP (Science &amp; Environmental Policy Project), run by Fred Singer and semi-attached to TASSC.
* ESEF (European Science and Environment Forum) run by Roger Bate on secondment from the Institute of Economic Affairs in London.

Following the Heidelberg Appeal, Salomon established for them the ICSE (aka &quot;CIES&quot;) which is variously quoted in the tobacco archive documents as the International Center for a Scientific Ecology or, in French, the &quot;&quot;.

==Creation==

The technique used by Salomon&#x27;s group to enlist members of the scientific establishment to lend their names to climate denial by signing the Appeal document, was quite unique. At this time, some sections of the environmental movement were anti-science, and anti-technology. They blamed the scientists as much as the industrialists for damaging the ecology of the planet.

The document most of the signatories thought they were signing was an appeal for the society to pay more attention to scientists than to the many irrational health and environmental activists. They were objecting to the way in which they were losing their privileged position as the &#x27;go-to authorities&#x27; on all such health and environmental matters. They didn&#x27;t see this as a climate-denial statement.

One of the signatories, Philip Anderson, physicist at Princeton University, cited the continued dispersal of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as a prime example of an environmentally hazardous situation identified by scientists. He complained that despite science&#x27;s disapproval, CFC&#x27;s persists to be released as a result of industrial interests and denial of potential harm. He asserted that:
&quot;It&#x27;s a sneaky thing to keep the CFC plants going. [... However ... ] industrialists, not scientists are to blame for much of the planet&#x27;s ecological degradation.&quot;
He agreed with Salomon in attacking the animal-rights people as &quot;&quot;clearly irrational?&quot; [... ] &quot;This is obvious when they resort to illegality and violence to propagate their ends.&quot; [such] forces &quot;make the public afraid of science.&quot;&quot; 
No draft of the original signed document exists, but participants have since claimed that the document they signed was a general &#x27;motherhood&#x27; statement about the need for better science in dealing with hazardous and health-related products. However, when release and publicised by Fred Singer&#x27;s Science &amp; Environmental Policy Project operation specific mention of climate change was added in the introductory passages and press release. It was carefully released to coincide with the opening of the Rio Earth Summit.

==Usage==

The &quot;Heidelberg Appeal&quot; has been enthusiastically embraced by large corporations and individual critics of the environmental movement. Conservative think tanks frequently cite the Heidelberg Appeal as proof that scientists reject the theory of global warming as well as a host of other environmental health risks associated with modern science and industry. Its name has subsequently been adopted by the Heidelberg Appeal Nederland Foundation, which was founded in 1993 and disputes health risks related to nitrates in foods and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The Heidelberg Appeal was promoted in 1993 by the International Center for a Scientific Ecology, a group set up by Michael Salomon &quot;that was considered important in Philip Morris&#x27; plans to create a group in Europe similar to The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition (TASSC)&quot;.
==ICSE==

The Board of the Center:
The UK tobacco industry&#x27;s on-going contact to the ICSE (which involved the ability to check and launder their public statements) was conducted through one of the tobacco industry&#x27;s long-term statistical consultants, Peter N Lee.

<text>Laura Blundy (2000) is a historical novel by English author Julie Myerson set in Victorian London. It is the story of a woman whose life takes a turn for the worse.

==Plot summary==

After her mother has died in childbirth, Laura Blundy is brought up by her loving and caring father, a merchant and shopowner who also pays for her schooling. One day, on her way to her ailing aunt, she is given a lift by a young man in a carriage who rapes her and then throws her out of the carriage again. She becomes pregnant, and when both her father and her aunt die she is left penniless.

Unable to care for her baby son, she manages to have him raised in an institution. She occasionally goes there to inquire after him, but one day she is told that he has died and that he has been buried in an unmarked grave. The feeling of loss she experiences never leaves her again.

Laura Blundy spends the following 18 years of her life in the streets of London. When another woman&#x27;s baby dies in her care she is charged with murder and has to go to prison. Years later she is set free again but almost immediately after her release she is run over by a carriage (whose driver does not stop). She is brought to hospital, where her leg is amputated. However, she falls in love with her surgeon. They get married, but Laura is attracted more by his cleanliness and moderate wealth than by his character or potency.

When, in mid-winter, Laura decides to commit suicide by drowning in the river Thames, she is rescued by Billy, a young worker employed in the building of the Victoria Embankment and London&#x27;s sewage system. At one point in the novel, Billy comes into direct contact with Joseph Bazalgette, the chief engineer on this project. Although Billy has a wife and children, they start a love affair.

Some time later Laura beats her husband to death in his own home, making Billy an accomplice after the fact. Laura cuts up her husband&#x27;s body, and then she and Billy carry the body in several bags to the river. As the surgeon&#x27;s head keeps bobbing up and being washed ashore they eventually have to burn it.

At this point in her life Laura, already in her late thirties, may be pregnant once again. The lovers have plans of escaping to France.

<doc id="181326" wikidata="Q7727424" url="?curid=181326" title="The Constant Nymph (novel)">
<text>The Constant Nymph is a 1924 novel by Margaret Kennedy. It tells how a teenage girl, Tessa Sanger, falls in love with a family friend, who eventually marries her cousin. It explores the protagonists&#x27; complex family histories, focusing on class, education and creativity.

==Reception and influence==
The novel sold well from its first appearance, becoming the first novel of a genre sometimes called &quot;Bohemian&quot;. Much of its success was due to its then-shocking sexual content, describing scenes of adolescent sexuality and of noble savagery in the Austrian Tyrol.

There is a complimentary allusion to the novel in the 1934 detective story &quot;The Nine Tailors&quot; by Dorothy L. Sayers. Fifteen-year-old Hilary tells her father she aspires to write novels: &quot;Best sellers. The sort that everybody goes potty over. Not just bosh ones, but like &quot;The Constant Nymph&quot;.&quot; Sayers includes a positive mention by two characters in her 1930 epistolary novel, &quot;The Documents in the Case&quot;.

The character and appearance of the composer Lewis Dodd was based on the artist Henry Lamb, who was a gifted pianist. Kennedy&#x27;s cousin George was one of Lamb&#x27;s oldest friends. Attributes of Albert Sanger were taken from Augustus John, particular the artists&#x27; colony he set up in 1911 at Alderney Manor. Kennedy may have been trying to protect herself against accusations of using her friends as models by transferring to both of them the talents of musicians rather than painters.

==Adaptations==

Margaret Kennedy and Basil Dean adapted &quot;The Constant Nymph&quot; for a three-act play that was published by Doubleday, Page and Company (Garden City, N.Y.) in 1926.

<text>A Danish pastry ( ) (sometimes shortened to danish, especially in American English) is a multilayered, laminated sweet pastry in the &quot;viennoiserie&quot; tradition. It is thought that some bakery techniques were brought to Denmark by Austrian bakers, and originated the name of this pastry. The Danish recipe is however different from the Viennese one and has since developed into a Danish specialty. 

However, the origin of the pastry is not clear as it is called Kopenhagener in Austria and Wienerbrød in Denmark.

Like other viennoiserie pastries, such as croissants, it is a variant of puff pastry made of laminated yeast-leavened dough that creates a layered texture.

Danish pastries were brought with immigrants to the United States, where they are often topped with a fruit or cream cheese filling, and are now popular around the world.

==Composition==
Danish pastry is made of yeast-leavened dough of wheat flour, milk, eggs, sugar, and large amounts of butter or margarine.

A yeast dough is rolled out thinly, covered with thin slices of butter between the layers of dough, and then the dough is folded and rolled several times, creating 27 layers. If necessary, the dough is chilled between foldings to ease handling. The process of rolling, buttering, folding, and chilling is repeated multiple times to create a multilayered dough that becomes airy and crispy on the outside, but also rich and buttery.

Butter is the traditional fat used in Danish pastry, but in industrial production, less expensive fats are often used, such as hydrogenated sunflower oil.

==Terminology==

In Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish, the term for Danish pastry is (or ), meaning &quot;Viennese bread&quot;. The same etymology is also the origin of the Icelandic , Finnish and Estonian (&quot;Viennese pastry&quot;).
In Vienna, the Danish pastry is called , referring to Copenhagen, or .

==History==
The origin of the Danish pastry is often ascribed to a strike amongst bakery workers in Denmark in 1850. The strike caused bakery owners to hire workers from abroad, among them several Austrian bakers, who brought along new baking traditions and pastry recipes. The Austrian pastry of &quot;Plundergebäck&quot; soon became popular in Denmark and after the labour disputes ended, Danish bakers adopted the Austrian recipes, adjusting them to their own liking and traditions by increasing the amount of egg and fat for example. This development resulted in what is now known as the Danish pastry.

One of the baking techniques and traditions that the Austrian bakers brought with them was the Viennese lamination technique. Due to such novelties the Danes called the pastry &quot;wienerbrød&quot; (Vienna bread) and that name is still in use in Northern Europe today. At that time, almost all baked goods in Denmark were given exotic names.

===Denmark===

Danish pastries as consumed in Denmark have different shapes and names. Some are topped with chocolate, pearl sugar, glacé icing, and/or slivered nuts and they may be stuffed with a variety of ingredients such as jam or preserves (usually apple or prune), remonce, marzipan, and/or custard. Shapes are numerous, including circles with filling in the middle (known in Denmark as &quot;Spandauers&quot;), figure-eights, spirals (known as snails), and the pretzel-like kringles. There&#x27;s also the frøsnapper, which is a twisted pastry sprinkled with sesame and poppy seeds. The pastry is often filled with marzipan or custard. Interestingly, the term frøsnapper has no unique meaning and is only used to refer to the dish itself.

Danish pastries of all variations have come to symbolize hygge, a significant concept within Danish culture that embodies a sense of coziness and comfort.

==Varieties==
In Sweden, Danish pastry is typically made in the &quot;Spandauer&quot;-style, often with vanilla custard.

In the UK, various ingredients such as jam, custard, apricots, cherries, raisins, flaked almonds, pecans, or caramelized toffee are placed on or within sections of divided dough, which is then baked. Cardamom is often added to increase the aromatic sense of sweetness.

In the US, Danishes are typically given a topping of fruit or sweetened cream cheese prior to baking. Danishes with nuts on them are also popular there and in Sweden, where often icing, and, sometimes, powdered sugar and chocolate spritzing are also added.

In Argentina, they are usually filled with dulce de leche or dulce de membrillo.

===United States===

Danish pastry was brought to the United States by Danish immigrants. Lauritz C. Klitteng of Læsø popularized &quot;Danish pastry&quot; in the US around 1915–1920. According to Klitteng, he made Danish pastry for the wedding of President Woodrow Wilson in December 1915. Klitteng toured the world to promote his product and was featured in such 1920s periodicals as the &quot;National Baker&quot;, the &quot;Bakers&#x27; Helper&quot;, and the &quot;Bakers&#x27; Weekly&quot;. Klitteng briefly had his own Danish Culinary Studio at 146 Fifth Avenue in New York City.

Herman Gertner owned a chain of New York City restaurants and had brought Klitteng to New York to sell Danish pastry. Gertner&#x27;s obituary appeared in the January 23, 1962 &quot;The New York Times&quot;:
&quot;At one point during his career Mr. Gertner befriended a Danish baker who convinced him that Danish pastry might be well received in New York. Mr. Gertner began serving the pastry in his restaurant and it immediately was a success.&quot;

<doc id="181329" wikidata="Q1169497" url="?curid=181329" title="Mr. Skeffington">
<text>Mr. Skeffington is a 1944 American drama film directed by Vincent Sherman, based on the 1940 novel of the same name by Elizabeth von Arnim.

The film stars Bette Davis as a beautiful but self-centered woman who has many suitors but marries Job Skeffington, played by Claude Rains, solely to save her brother from going to prison. It also makes a point about Skeffington&#x27;s status as a Jew in 1914 high society and later in relation to Nazi Germany. Supporting actors include Walter Abel, George Coulouris and Richard Waring.

==Plot==
In 1914, spoiled Fanny Trellis is a renowned beauty with many suitors. She loves her brother Trippy and would do anything to help him. Fanny learns that Trippy has embezzled money from his employer Job Skeffington. To save her brother from prosecution, Fanny pursues and marries the lovestruck Skeffington. Disgusted by the arrangement, in part because of his prejudice against Skeffington being Jewish, Trippy leaves home to fight in the Lafayette Escadrille in World War I.

Job loves Fanny, but she is merely fond of him and largely ignores him. She becomes pregnant with his child, but when Trippy dies in France, she states she is &quot;stuck&quot; with Job, and the marriage then becomes wholly loveless, continuing only for the child&#x27;s sake. Job and George Trellis, Fanny&#x27;s cousin, also enlist but are stationed near home.

Fanny enjoys playing the wealthy socialite, stringing along a persistent quartet of suitors who are unfazed by her marriage, as well as much younger lovers. Lonely, Job finds solace with his secretaries. When Fanny finds out, she divorces him, conveniently ignoring her own behavior.

Fanny neglects her young daughter (also named Fanny), who understandably prefers her loving father and begs him to take her with him to Europe. Although Job fears for his child and tries unsuccessfully to explain to her the nature of prejudice she will encounter as a Jew abroad, he finally, tearfully and joyfully, says yes. Fanny is relieved to be free of the encumbrance of a child. Fanny has a series of affairs, living well on the extremely generous settlement Job has left her – half his fortune – and hardly giving a thought to her daughter, whom she does not see for many years.

She retains her beauty as she grows older (much to the envy of her women acquaintances), but when she catches diphtheria, it ravages her appearance. In denial, she invites her old lovers (and their wives) to a party. The men are shocked (and the women relieved) by how much Fanny has changed, leaving her distraught. Her latest young suitor, Johnny Mitchell, falls in love with her daughter, who has returned from Europe because of the rise of the Nazis. They marry after only a few months and leave for Seattle. Fanny&#x27;s daughter explains that, while she wishes her mother well, she feels no real love for her, and pities her for discarding the one man who truly loves her. Shortly before her daughter&#x27;s departure, Fanny suffers the ultimate humiliation when one of her old beaux makes what she at first believes to be a sincere marriage proposal, only to withdraw it when he begins to suspect, incorrectly, that she is no longer wealthy. Fanny is left alone with her maid, Manby.

Fanny&#x27;s cousin George brings Job back to Fanny&#x27;s home unannounced. The Nazis have left Job penniless and worse, George tells Fanny, and he asks her to be generous. Fanny&#x27;s vanity nearly prevents her from venturing down her home&#x27;s grand staircase to see Job.

When she does finally enter the parlor, Job moves to her, stumbles and falls: He is blind (due to torture in a Nazi concentration camp). Fanny rushes to cradle him in her arms. As she takes his arm and guides him up the staircase, she tells the maid that &quot;Mr. Skeffington has come home.&quot; Job had once, long ago, told Fanny that, &quot;A woman is beautiful only when she is loved.&quot; George tells Fanny that, at that moment, she has &quot;never been more beautiful.&quot; At long last, she realizes the truth of it.

==Production==
Julius Epstein said &quot;They had four or five scripts that had never been made, including one by Edmund Goulding and one by John Huston. We took a look at &quot;Mr. Skeffington&quot; and said, ‘First of all, it shouldn’t be English; it should be made with an American family. Secondly, the trick of the book was that its title was Mr. Skeffington, and he never appeared in the book. He should be a character in the movie.’ And it was made.&quot;

Paul Henreid says he was offered the male lead but turned it down as he felt he would not be convincing as a man who looked on passively while his wife had affairs.

According to the 1989 book &quot;Bette &amp; Joan: The Divine Feud&quot; by Shaun Considine, Davis was going through intense personal torments at this time, which was reflected in her treatment of co-stars on this film, and several others at the time, culminating in a vicious personal attack. Apparently, while Davis was away from her dressing room, the eyewash she always used after filming the day&#x27;s scenes had been poisoned, causing Davis to scream out in pain. Director Vincent Sherman, with whom Davis had once been romantically involved, admitted to the detectives investigating the incident, &quot;If you asked everyone on the set who would have committed such a thing, everyone would raise their hand!&quot; Even Bette Davis is quoted as saying &quot;Only a mother could have loved me at this point in my life.&quot;

==Box office==
According to the Warner Bros. records, the film earned $2,456,000 in the U.S. and $1,365,000 in other markets.

== Reception ==
Film critic and author &quot;James Agee&quot; reviewed it in 1944: &quot;...essentially &quot;Mr. Skeffington&quot; is just a super soap opera, or an endless woman&#x27;s-page meditation on What to Do When Beauty Fades. &quot; &quot;Leslie Halliwell&quot; gave it three of four stars: &quot;Long, patchily made, but thoroughly enjoyable star melodrama.&quot; On Rotten Tomatoes, 57% of seven critics&#x27; reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.9/10.

==Awards==
Bette Davis was nominated for the Oscar for Best Actress, and Claude Rains was nominated for Best Supporting Actor.

<text>Mrs. Parkington is a 1944 drama film. It tells the story of a woman&#x27;s life, told via flashbacks, from boarding house maid to society matron. The movie was adapted by Polly James and Robert Thoeren from the novel by Louis Bromfield. It was directed by Tay Garnett and starred Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon appearing together as husband and wife for the fourth time.

==Plot==
At Christmastime in 1938, Susie Parkington, an elderly society matron and widow of the wealthy businessman and financier Major Augustus Parkington, is visited by her many relatives, with the exception of her beloved great-granddaughter Jane. Except for Jane, Susie&#x27;s heirs are boorish, dissolute, and unhappy despite their wealth. When Jane does appear, she informs her great-grandmother that she plans to secretly elope with Ned Talbot, her father&#x27;s employee, who wishes to take her away from her family and their way of life.

Susie has a flashback to her own life. As a teenager, Susie helps her mother run a boarding house for silver miners in Leaping Rock, Nevada. She meets Major Augustus Parkington, the owner of the mine, when he stays at the boardinghouse on a visit; the miners complain to him about dangerous working conditions, but he refuses to fix them as it would slow down the yield of the mine, instead paying the miners higher salaries to take the risk and telling them to quit if they are so afraid.

Shortly afterwards, a serious mine accident occurs which kills Susie&#x27;s mother along with a number of miners. Rather than leave Susie to an uncertain fate, Augustus marries her and takes her away to New York City. Susie is introduced to Baroness Aspasia Conti, a French aristocrat and close friend and former mistress of Augustus, who helps Susie pick out clothes and learn the social graces needed for a woman of her station.

Back in the present, Susie arranges a meeting with Ned, where he reveals that Jane&#x27;s father Amory (Susie&#x27;s grandson-in-law) is being investigated for fraud, and Ned planned to take Jane away in order to avoid telling her or having to testify against Amory. Susie disapproves of Ned&#x27;s handling of the situation, prompting Jane to send Ned away. Amory confesses to Susie and Jane that he did commit fraud, and begs Susie for a loan of $31 million to cover his actions in hopes of avoiding prison. Susie is inclined to give him the loan, but says he must ask the rest of the family, as Amory would be spending their inheritance.

Susie once again reminisces about her past. She remembers how, on their third anniversary, Augustus presented her with a grand house, furnished with Aspasia&#x27;s help. Susie announces that she is pregnant, and an elated Augustus holds a ball to celebrate, inviting the wealthiest and most socially prominent citizens of New York, but his happiness turns to fury when most of them refuse to attend due to his blunt, outspoken behavior. His rage upsets Susie, and when she runs away from the dinner party, she runs upstairs, faints, falls down the stairs, and has a miscarriage.

Augustus angrily vows revenge against the non-attendees, and unbeknownst to Susie, manages to force many of them out of business over the next few years. Susie only finds out after Mrs. Livingstone, whose husband is about to be put out of business by Augustus, pleads with Susie for help and informs her that another man committed suicide after Augustus ruined him. Susie has words with Augustus, who remains unrepentant, so she separates from him and takes up new quarters on Long Island, with frequent visits from Aspasia. Several weeks pass before Augustus begs his wife to return home, revealing that he has been unsuccessful in his mission to put the Livingstones out of business. Susie then informs him that she has been secretly financially supporting the Livingstone business and that his vendetta must stop. Augustus agrees and the couple reunite.

Back in the present, as Susie expected, her heirs refuse to lend Amory the money. Amory, overcoming his fear of going to prison, resolves to make a full confession to the authorities; Susie approves, saying that is what the Major would have done.

Once again, Susie has a flashback, this time to when her son Herbert (father of greedy granddaughters Madeleine and Helen) was killed in an accident while playing polo. Susie becomes a recluse for a year and Augustus moves to England, renting a lavish country home and carrying on an affair with Lady Norah Ebbsworth. Aspasia convinces Susie to fight for her marriage, so Susie follows Augustus to England and, with the assistance of the Prince of Wales, convinces him to end his affair.

Following this, Aspasia reveals that she will be moving back to Paris. She also admits to Susie that she has always been in love with Augustus. Susie reveals that she has always known, and after she herself was sure of Augustus&#x27; love for her, she loved Aspasia too. Augustus and Susie have a heart-to-heart in which he hopes that if their grandchildren develop the weaknesses he associates with money that is inherited rather than earned, he or Susie will be alive to set them straight.

Once more in the present, Susie realizes she made a mistake in having Jane send Ned away, and tells Jane to follow her heart and go after Ned, which Jane gladly does. Finally, Susie makes the decision to bail out Amory anyway, as many &quot;little people&quot; would otherwise lose their money through his fraud. Her daughter, granddaughters, and great grandson leave in disgust after learning they will be cut off by Susie. Once they leave, Susie calls upstairs for her lady&#x27;s maid to make ready for the day. She also shouts to her that after the finances are distributed, they&#x27;ll be returning to Leaping Rock, Nevada.

<doc id="181334" wikidata="Q864003" url="?curid=181334" title="Discrete logarithm">
<text>In mathematics, for given real numbers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, the logarithm log&quot;b&quot; &quot;a&quot; is a number &quot;x&quot; such that . Analogously, in any group &quot;G&quot;, powers &quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot; can be defined for all integers &quot;k&quot;, and the discrete logarithm log&quot;b&quot; &quot;a&quot; is an integer &quot;k&quot; such that . In arithmetic modulo an integer &quot;m&quot;, the more commonly used term is index: One can write &quot;k&quot; = ind&quot;b&quot; &quot;a&quot; (mod &quot;m&quot;) (read &quot;the index of &quot;a&quot; to the base &quot;b&quot; modulo &quot;m&quot;&quot;) for &quot;b&quot; &quot;k&quot; ≡ &quot;a&quot; (mod &quot;m&quot;) if &quot;b&quot; is a primitive root of &quot;m&quot; and gcd(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;m&quot;) = 1.

Discrete logarithms are quickly computable in a few special cases. However, no efficient method is known for computing them in general. In cryptography, the computational complexity of the discrete logarithm problem, along with its application, was first proposed in the Diffie–Hellman problem. Several important algorithms in public-key cryptography, such as ElGamal, base their security on the hardness assumption that the discrete logarithm problem (DLP) over carefully chosen groups has no efficient solution.

== Definition ==
Let &quot;G&quot; be any group. Denote its group operation by multiplication and its identity element by 1. Let &quot;b&quot; be any element of &quot;G&quot;. For any positive integer &quot;k&quot;, the expression &quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot; denotes the product of &quot;b&quot; with itself &quot;k&quot; times:
:formula_1
Similarly, let &quot;b&quot;−&quot;k&quot; denote the product of &quot;b&quot;−1 with itself &quot;k&quot; times. For &quot;k&quot; = 0, the &quot;k&quot;th power is the identity: .

Let &quot;a&quot; also be an element of &quot;G&quot;. An integer &quot;k&quot; that solves the equation is termed a discrete logarithm (or simply logarithm, in this context) of &quot;a&quot; to the base &quot;b&quot;. One writes &quot;k&quot; = log&quot;b&quot; &quot;a&quot;.

==Examples==
=== Powers of 10 ===
The powers of 10 are
:formula_2
For any number &quot;a&quot; in this list, one can compute log10 &quot;a&quot;. For example, log10 10000 = 4, and log10 0.001 = −3. These are instances of the discrete logarithm problem.

Other base-10 logarithms in the real numbers are not instances of the discrete logarithm problem, because they involve non-integer exponents. For example, the equation log10 53 = 1.724276… means that 101.724276… = 53. While integer exponents can be defined in any group using products and inverses, arbitrary real exponents, such as this 1.724276…, require other concepts such as the exponential function.

In group-theoretic terms, the powers of 10 form a cyclic group &quot;G&quot; under multiplication, and 10 is a generator for this group. The discrete logarithm log10 &quot;a&quot; is defined for any &quot;a&quot; in &quot;G&quot;.

=== Powers of a fixed real number ===
A similar example holds for any non-zero real number &quot;b&quot;. The powers form a multiplicative subgroup &quot;G&quot; = {…, &quot;b&quot;−3, &quot;b&quot;−2, &quot;b&quot;−1, 1, &quot;b&quot;1, &quot;b&quot;2, &quot;b&quot;3, …} of the non-zero real numbers. For any element &quot;a&quot; of &quot;G&quot;, one can compute log&quot;b&quot; &quot;a&quot;.

=== Modular arithmetic ===
One of the simplest settings for discrete logarithms is the group Z&quot;p&quot;×. This is the group of multiplication modulo the prime &quot;p&quot;. Its elements are non-zero congruence classes modulo &quot;p&quot;, and the group product of two elements may be obtained by ordinary integer multiplication of the elements followed by reduction modulo &quot;p&quot;.

The &quot;k&quot;th power of one of the numbers in this group may be computed by finding its &quot;k&quot;th power as an integer and then finding the remainder after division by &quot;p&quot;. When the numbers involved are large, it is more efficient to reduce modulo &quot;p&quot; multiple times during the computation. Regardless of the specific algorithm used, this operation is called modular exponentiation. For example, consider Z17×. To compute 34 in this group, compute 34 = 81, and then divide 81 by 17, obtaining a remainder of 13. Thus 34 = 13 in the group Z17×.

The discrete logarithm is just the inverse operation. For example, consider the equation 3&quot;k&quot; ≡ 13 (mod 17). From the example above, one solution is &quot;k&quot; = 4, but it is not the only solution. Since 316 ≡ 1 (mod 17)—as follows from Fermat&#x27;s little theorem—it also follows that if &quot;n&quot; is an integer then 34+16&quot;n&quot; ≡ 34 × (316)&quot;n&quot; ≡ 13 × 1&quot;n&quot; ≡ 13 (mod 17). Hence the equation has infinitely many solutions of the form 4 + 16&quot;n&quot;. Moreover, because 16 is the smallest positive integer &quot;m&quot; satisfying 3&quot;m&quot; ≡ 1 (mod 17), these are the only solutions. Equivalently, the set of all possible solutions can be expressed by the constraint that &quot;k&quot; ≡ 4 (mod 16).

=== Powers of the identity ===
In the special case where &quot;b&quot; is the identity element 1 of the group &quot;G&quot;, the discrete logarithm log&quot;b&quot; &quot;a&quot; is undefined for &quot;a&quot; other than 1, and every integer &quot;k&quot; is a discrete logarithm for &quot;a&quot; = 1.

== Properties ==
Powers obey the usual algebraic identity &quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot; + &quot;l&quot; = &quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot; &quot;b&quot;&amp;hairsp;&quot;l&quot;. In other words, the function
:formula_3
defined by &quot;f&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) = &quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot; is a group homomorphism from the integers Z under addition onto the subgroup &quot;H&quot; of &quot;G&quot; generated by &quot;b&quot;. For all &quot;a&quot; in &quot;H&quot;, log&quot;b&quot; &quot;a&quot; exists. Conversely, log&quot;b&quot; &quot;a&quot; does not exist for &quot;a&quot; that are not in &quot;H&quot;.

If &quot;H&quot; is infinite, then log&quot;b&quot; &quot;a&quot; is also unique, and the discrete logarithm amounts to a group isomorphism

:formula_4

On the other hand, if &quot;H&quot; is finite of order &quot;n&quot;, then log&quot;b&quot; &quot;a&quot; is unique only up to congruence modulo &quot;n&quot;, and the discrete logarithm amounts to a group isomorphism
:formula_5
where Z&quot;n&quot; denotes the additive group of integers modulo &quot;n&quot;.

The familiar base change formula for ordinary logarithms remains valid: If &quot;c&quot; is another generator of &quot;H&quot;, then

:formula_6

== Algorithms ==
The discrete logarithm problem is considered to be computationally intractable. That is, no efficient classical algorithm is known for computing discrete logarithms in general.

A general algorithm for computing log&quot;b&quot; &quot;a&quot; in finite groups &quot;G&quot; is to raise &quot;b&quot; to larger and larger powers &quot;k&quot; until the desired &quot;a&quot; is found. This algorithm is sometimes called &quot;trial multiplication&quot;. It requires running time linear in the size of the group &quot;G&quot; and thus exponential in the number of digits in the size of the group. Therefore, it is an exponential-time algorithm, practical only for small groups &quot;G&quot;.

More sophisticated algorithms exist, usually inspired by similar algorithms for integer factorization. These algorithms run faster than the naïve algorithm, some of them proportional to the square root of the size of the group, and thus exponential in half the number of digits in the size of the group. However, none of them runs in polynomial time (in the number of digits in the size of the group).

* Baby-step giant-step
* Function field sieve
* Index calculus algorithm
* Number field sieve
* Pohlig–Hellman algorithm
* Pollard&#x27;s rho algorithm for logarithms
* Pollard&#x27;s kangaroo algorithm (aka Pollard&#x27;s lambda algorithm)

There is an efficient quantum algorithm due to Peter Shor.

Efficient classical algorithms also exist in certain special cases. For example, in the group of the integers modulo &quot;p&quot; under addition, the power &quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot; becomes a product &quot;bk&quot;, and equality means congruence modulo &quot;p&quot; in the integers. The extended Euclidean algorithm finds &quot;k&quot; quickly.

With Diffie–Hellman, a cyclic group modulo a prime &quot;p&quot; is used, allowing an efficient computation of the discrete logarithm with Pohlig–Hellman if the order of the group (being &quot;p&quot;−1) is sufficiently smooth, i.e. has no large prime factors.

== Comparison with integer factorization ==
While computing discrete logarithms and integer factorization are distinct problems, they share some properties:
* both are special cases of the hidden subgroup problem for finite abelian groups,
* both problems seem to be difficult (no efficient algorithms are known for non-quantum computers),
* for both problems efficient algorithms on quantum computers are known,
* algorithms from one problem are often adapted to the other, and
* the difficulty of both problems has been used to construct various cryptographic systems.

== Cryptography ==
There exist groups for which computing discrete logarithms is apparently difficult. In some cases (e.g. large prime order subgroups of groups Z&quot;p&quot;×) there is not only no efficient algorithm known for the worst case, but the average-case complexity can be shown to be about as hard as the worst case using random self-reducibility.

At the same time, the inverse problem of discrete exponentiation is not difficult (it can be computed efficiently using exponentiation by squaring, for example). This asymmetry is analogous to the one between integer factorization and integer multiplication. Both asymmetries (and other possibly one-way functions) have been exploited in the construction of cryptographic systems.

Popular choices for the group &quot;G&quot; in discrete logarithm cryptography (DLC) are the cyclic groups Z&quot;p&quot;× (e.g. ElGamal encryption, Diffie–Hellman key exchange, and the Digital Signature Algorithm) and cyclic subgroups of elliptic curves over finite fields (&quot;see&quot; Elliptic curve cryptography).

While there is no publicly known algorithm for solving the discrete logarithm problem in general, the first three steps of the number field sieve algorithm only depend on the group &quot;G&quot;, not on the specific elements of &quot;G&quot; whose finite log is desired. By precomputing these three steps for a specific group, one need only carry out the last step, which is much less computationally expensive than the first three, to obtain a specific logarithm in that group.

It turns out that much internet traffic uses one of a handful of groups that are of order 1024 bits or less, e.g. cyclic groups with order of the Oakley primes specified in RFC 2409. The Logjam attack used this vulnerability to compromise a variety of internet services that allowed the use of groups whose order was a 512-bit prime number, so called export grade.

The authors of the Logjam attack estimate that the much more difficult precomputation needed to solve the discrete log problem for a 1024-bit prime would be within the budget of a large national intelligence agency such as the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). The Logjam authors speculate that precomputation against widely reused 1024 DH primes is behind claims in leaked NSA documents that NSA is able to break much of current cryptography.

<doc id="181337" wikidata="Q5119" url="?curid=181337" title="Capital city">
<text>A capital city, or just capital, is the municipality holding primary status in a country, state, province, department, or other subnational division, usually as its seat of the government. A capital is typically a city that physically encompasses the government&#x27;s offices and meeting places; the status as capital is often designated by its law or constitution. In some jurisdictions, including several countries, different branches of government are in different settlements, sometimes meaning multiple official capitals. In some cases, a distinction is made between the official (constitutional) capital and the seat of government, which is in another place. 

English-language news media often use the name of the capital city as an alternative name for the government of the country of which it is the capital, as a form of metonymy. For example, the &quot;relations between London and Washington&quot; refers to the &quot;relations between the United Kingdom and the United States&quot;.

== Terminology and etymology ==
The word &quot;capital&quot; derives from the Latin word (genitive ), meaning &#x27;head&#x27;, later borrowed from Medieval Latin &quot;&quot; (&#x27;of the head&#x27;). The Latin phrase meaning &#x27;Rome capital of the world&#x27; () was already used by the poet Ovid in 1st century BC. It originates out of a classical European understanding of the known world: Europe, North Africa, and Southwest Asia. The phrase is related to the enduring power of the city first as the capital of the Republic and the Empire, and later as the centre of the Catholic Church.

In several English-speaking states, the terms county town and county seat are also used in lower administrative divisions. In some unitary states, subnational capitals may be known as &#x27;administrative centres&#x27;. The capital is often the largest city of its constituent, though not always.

== Origins ==

Historically, the major economic centre of a state or region has often become the focal point of political power, and became a capital through conquest or federation. Historical examples are ancient Babylon, ancient Athens, ancient Rome, Abbasid Baghdad, Constantinople, Chang&#x27;an, and ancient Cusco. The modern capital city has not always existed: in medieval Western Europe, an itinerant (wandering) government was common. 

The capital city attracts politically motivated people and those whose skills are needed for efficient administration of national or imperial governments, such as lawyers, political scientists, bankers, journalists, and public policy makers. Some of these cities are or were also religious centres, e.g. Constantinople (more than one religion), Rome/Vatican City (the Roman Catholic Church), Jerusalem (more than one religion), Babylon, Moscow (the Russian Orthodox Church), Belgrade (the Serbian Orthodox Church), Paris, and Beijing. In some countries, the capital has been changed for geopolitical reasons; Finland&#x27;s first city, Turku, which had served as the country&#x27;s capital since the Middle Ages under the Swedish rule, lost its position during the Grand Duchy of Finland in 1812, when Helsinki was made the current capital of Finland by the Russian Empire.

The convergence of political and economic or cultural power is by no means universal. Traditional capitals may be economically eclipsed by provincial rivals as is the case with Nanjing by Shanghai, Quebec City by Montreal, and several US state capitals. The decline of a dynasty or culture could also mean the extinction of its capital city, as occurred at Babylon and Cahokia. &quot;Political nomadism&quot; was practiced in ancient Near East to increase ties between the ruler and the subjects.

Although many capitals are defined by constitution or legislation, many long-time capitals have no such legal designation, including Bern, Edinburgh, Lisbon, London, Paris, and Wellington. They are recognized as capitals as a matter of convention, and because all or almost all the country&#x27;s central political institutions, such as government departments, supreme court, legislature, embassies, etc., are located in or near them.

== Modern capitals ==


Many modern capital cities are located near the centre of the country, so that they are more accessible to its population and have better protection from possible invasions. The location may also be based on a compromise between two or more cities or other political divisions, historical reasons, or enough land was needed to deliberately build a new planned city for the capital. The majority of national capitals are also the largest city in their respective countries. Modern examples are Berlin, Cairo, London, Madrid, Mexico City, Moscow, Paris, Rome, Jakarta, Metro Manila, Seoul, and Tokyo.

Counties in the United Kingdom have historic county towns, which are often not the largest settlement within the county and often are no longer administrative centres, as many historical counties are now only ceremonial, and administrative boundaries are different. The number of new capitals in the world increased substantially since the Renaissance period, especially with the founding of independent nation-states since the eighteenth century.

In Canada, there is a federal capital, while the ten provinces and three territories each have capital cities. The states of such countries as Mexico, Brazil (including the famous cities of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, capitals of their respective states), and Australia also each have capital cities. For example, the six state capitals of Australia are Adelaide, Brisbane, Hobart, Melbourne, Perth, and Sydney. In Australia, the term &quot;capital cities&quot; is regularly used to refer to those six state capitals plus the federal capital Canberra, and Darwin, the capital of the Northern Territory. Abu Dhabi is the capital city of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and also of the United Arab Emirates overall.

In unitary states which consist of multiple constituent nations, such as the United Kingdom and the Kingdom of Denmark, each will usually have its own capital city. Unlike in federations, there is usually not a separate national capital, but rather the capital city of one constituent nation will also be the capital of the state overall, such as London, which is the capital of England and of the United Kingdom. Similarly, each of the autonomous communities of Spain and regions of Italy has a capital city, such as Seville and Naples, while Madrid is the capital of the Community of Madrid and of the Kingdom of Spain as a whole and Rome is the capital of Italy and of the region of Lazio.

In the Federal Republic of Germany, each of its constituent states (or &quot;Länder&quot;, plural of &quot;Land&quot;) has its own capital city, such as Dresden, Wiesbaden, Mainz, Düsseldorf, Stuttgart, and Munich, as do all of the republics of the Russian Federation. The national capitals of Germany and Russia (the Stadtstaat of Berlin and the federal city of Moscow) are also constituent states of both countries in their own right. Each of the states of Austria and cantons of Switzerland also have their own capital cities. Vienna, the national capital of Austria, is also one of the states, while Bern is the (&quot;de facto&quot;) capital of both Switzerland and of the Canton of Bern.

== Planned capitals ==
Governing entities sometimes plan, design and build new capital cities to house the seat of government of a polity or of a subdivision. Deliberately planned and designed capitals include:
These cities satisfy one or both of the following criteria:

# A deliberately planned city that was built expressly to house the seat of government, superseding a capital city that was in an established population center. There have been various reasons for this, including overcrowding in that major metropolitan area, and the desire to place the capital city in a location with a better climate (usually a less tropical one).
# A town that was chosen as a compromise among two or more cities (or other political divisions), none of which was willing to concede to the the privilege of being the capital city. Usually, the new capital is geographically located roughly equidistant between the competing population centres.

===Compromise locations===

Some examples of the second situation (compromise locations) are:
* Canberra, Australia, chosen as a compromise location between Melbourne and Sydney.
* Washington, D.C., United States, founded as a compromise between more urbanized Northern states and agrarian Southernslave states to share national power. The Compromise of 1790, resulted in the passage of the Residence Act, which approved the creation of a national capital on the Potomac River on land ceded from Maryland and Virginia.
* Frankfort, Kentucky, midway between Louisville and Lexington.
* Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, along the boundary between the two former colonies that formed the core of pre-Confederation Canada—primarily English-speaking Upper Canada and primarily French-speaking Lower Canada. Today, this border separates the two most populous of Canada&#x27;s ten modern provinces, Ontario and Quebec.
* Tallahassee, Florida, chosen as the midpoint between Pensacola and St. Augustine, Florida – then the two largest cities in Florida.
* Wellington became the capital city of New Zealand in 1865. It lies at the southern tip of the North Island of New Zealand, the smaller of New Zealand&#x27;s two main islands (which subsequently became the more populous island) immediately across Cook Strait from the South Island. The previous capital, Auckland, lies much further north in the North Island; the move followed a long argument for a more central location for parliament.
* Managua, Nicaragua, chosen to appease rivals in León and Granada, which also were associated with the liberal and conservative political factions respectively
* Jefferson City, Missouri was selected as the state capital in 1821, the year after Missouri was admitted to the Union, due to its central location within the state. It is almost halfway between Missouri&#x27;s two largest cities, Kansas City in the west and St. Louis in the east, although Kansas City was not incorporated until 1850.

Changes in a nation&#x27;s political regime sometimes result in the designation of a new capital. Akmola (renamed Astana in 1998) became the capital of Kazakhstan in 1997, following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Naypyidaw was founded in Burma&#x27;s interior as the former capital, Rangoon, was claimed to be overcrowded.

== Unusual capital city arrangements ==

A few nation-states have multiple capitals, and there are also several states that have no capital. Some have a city as the capital but with most government agencies elsewhere.

There is also a ghost town which is currently the &quot;de jure&quot; capital of a territory: Plymouth in Montserrat.

* Belize: Belmopan was designated the national capital of the then British Honduras in 1971, but most government offices and embassies are still located in Belize City.
* Canary Islands (Spain): Until 1927, the capital of the Province of Canarias was Santa Cruz de Tenerife. When the Canary Islands became an autonomous community in 1982, Santa Cruz de Tenerife and Las Palmas de Gran Canaria were both given capital status. There is currently a balance of institutions between the two capitals; the Canary Islands is the only autonomous community in Spain which has two capitals.
* Chile: Santiago is the capital even though the National Congress of Chile meets in Valparaíso.
* Czech Republic: Prague is the capital city, however the Constitutional Court, Supreme Court and Supreme Administrative Court are all located in Brno.
* Estonia: the Supreme Court and the Ministry of Education and Research are located in Tartu.
* France: The French constitution does not recognize any capital city in France. By law Paris is the seat of both houses of Parliament (the National Assembly and the Senate), but their joint congresses are held at the Palace of Versailles. In case of emergency, the seat of the constitutional powers can be transferred to another town, in order for the Houses of Parliament to sit in the same location as the President and Cabinet.
* Germany: The official capital Berlin is home to the parliament and the highest bodies of the executive branch (consisting of the ceremonial presidency and effective chancellery). Various ministries are located in the former West German capital of Bonn, which now has the title &quot;Federal City&quot;. The Federal Constitutional Court has its seat in Karlsruhe which, as a consequence, is sometimes called Germany&#x27;s &quot;judicial capital&quot;; none of Germany&#x27;s highest judicial organs are located in Berlin. Various German government agencies are located in other parts of Germany.
* India:
** Andhra Pradesh: Hyderabad is the &quot;de jure&quot; capital of the state until 2024, while Amaravati is the &quot;de facto&quot; seat of government since 2014. The Governor of Andhra Pradesh has his official residence in Vijayawada
** Chhattisgarh: Raipur is the administrative and legislative capital, while the high court (judiciary capital) is located in Bilaspur. The proposed future capital is Nava Raipur.
** Jammu and Kashmir: Srinagar serves as the summer capital of the state while Jammu is the winter capital. Every six months, the entire state machinery shifts from one city to another.
** Kerala: Thiruvananthapuram is the administrative and legislative capital of the state, while the high court is located in Ernakulam.
** Himachal Pradesh: Shimla is the primary capital city. Dharamshala, which is also the headquarters of the Central Tibetan Administration, is the second winter capital of the state.
** Madhya Pradesh: Bhopal is the administrative and legislative capital of the state, while the high court is located in Jabalpur.
** Punjab and Haryana: Both states share Chandigarh as their capital city. The city itself is administered as a Union territory.
** Odisha: Bhubaneswar is the administrative and legislative capital of the state, while the high court is located in Cuttack.
** Rajasthan: Jaipur is the administrative and legislative capital of the state, while the high court is located in Jodhpur.
** Uttarakhand: Dehradun is the administrative and legislative capital, while the high court is located in Nainital. The proposed future capital is Gairsain.
** Ladakh: Leh and Kargil serve as joint capitals of the Union Territory.
* South Korea: Seoul remains as the capital and seat of the government&#x27;s branches, but many government agencies have moved to Sejong City.
* Malaysia: Kuala Lumpur is the constitutional capital, home of the King, and seat of Parliament, but the federal administrative centre and judiciary have been moved south to Putrajaya.
* Monaco, Singapore, and the Vatican City are city-states, and thus do not contain any distinct capital city as a whole. However, in Singapore&#x27;s case, the main judiciary and legislative offices are located in the Downtown Core. Similarly, while Victoria was the capital of colonial Hong Kong, the heart of old Victoria, now known as Central, serves as the seat of government offices today. Vatican City, however, is the religious centre of the Roman Catholic Church and houses the offices and departments of Holy See which serves as the government of both the city-state and worldwide Catholic Church.
* Montenegro: The official capital Podgorica is home to the parliament and the executive, but the seat of the presidency is in the former royal capital of Cetinje.
* Myanmar (Burma): Naypyidaw was designated the national capital in 2005, the same year it was founded, but most government offices and embassies are still located in Yangon (Rangoon).
* Nauru: Nauru, a microstate of only , has no distinct capital city, but has a capital district instead.
*Philippines:
** National capital: Presidential Decree No. 940, issued on 24 June 1976, designates the whole of National Capital Region (NCR) or Metro Manila as the seat of government, with the City of Manila as the country&#x27;s capital. Some national government institutions and agencies are located within the Manila capital city, while others are scattered on other parts of the metropolitan area. The presidential palace (Malacañang Palace, serving as the seat of the President of the Philippines) and the Supreme Court are located within the capital city while the two houses of Congress are located outside the capital Manila but within the metropolis of the same name.
** Cavite: Imus is designated as the provincial capital, while government offices are in Trece Martires.
* Portugal:
** National capital: the Portuguese constitution has no reference to a capital. Although Lisbon is home to the Parliament, the President&#x27;s and the Prime Minister&#x27;s official residences, all the Government&#x27;s departments, all the embassies and the highest courts, no Portuguese official document states that Lisbon is the national capital.
** Azores: since the establishment of local autonomy in 1976, the Azores has three designated regional capital cities: Ponta Delgada at São Miguel Island (seat of the Autonomous Government); Horta at Faial Island (seat of the Legislative Assembly); and Angra do Heroísmo at Terceira Island (seat of the judiciary and the historical capital of the Azores, in addition to being the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Angra).
* Sri Lanka: Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte is designated the administrative capital and the location of the parliament, while the former capital, Colombo, is now designated as the &quot;commercial capital&quot;. However, many government offices are still located in Colombo. Both cities are in the Colombo District.
* South Africa: The administrative capital is Pretoria, the legislative capital is Cape Town, and the judicial capital is Bloemfontein. This is the outcome of the compromise that created the Union of South Africa in 1910. Despite Bloemfontein&#x27;s status as the judicial capital, the country&#x27;s highest court, the Constitutional Court of South Africa, sits in its largest city, Johannesburg.
* Switzerland: Bern is the &quot;Federal City&quot; of Switzerland and functions as &quot;de facto&quot; capital. However, the Swiss Supreme Court is located in Lausanne which is also the Olympic Capital.
** Canton of Zürich: Zürich is the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of the canton, but the cantonal constitution makes no mention of a capital city.
* Tanzania: Dodoma was designated the national capital in 1996, but some of the government offices and almost all embassies are still located in Dar es Salaam.
* United States:
** California: The state executive and legislative branches and most government agencies are based in Sacramento but the California Supreme Court is headquartered in San Francisco with secondary meeting places in Sacramento and Los Angeles.
** Illinois: Springfield has the seats of the branches of state government and serves as the official state capital. However various Illinois government officials primarily reside in or are primarily active in Chicago. (see: for a further explanation)
** Louisiana: The state executive and legislative branches and most government agencies are based in Baton Rouge, but the Louisiana Supreme Court is located in New Orleans.
** New York: The state capital and government are headquartered in Albany, but many officials are mostly active in or live in New York City.
** Pennsylvania: The state capital is Harrisburg but each one of the state Supreme Court and its two appellate courts holds hearings in the three cities of Harrisburg, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh. Also, most statewide elected officials and officers who are based in Southeast Pennsylvania (City of Philadelphia, Bucks County, Montgomery County, Delaware County, and Chester County) prefer working mostly in Philadelphia.

=== Capitals that are not the seat of government ===
There are several countries where, for various reasons, the official capital and seat of government are separated:
* Benin: Porto-Novo is the official capital, but Cotonou is the seat of government.
* Bolivia: Sucre is the constitutional capital, and the supreme tribunal of justice is located in Sucre, making it the judicial capital. The , the national congress and national electoral court are located in La Paz, making it the seat of government.
* Ivory Coast: Yamoussoukro was designated the national capital in 1983, but most government offices and embassies are still located in Abidjan.
* Netherlands: Amsterdam is the constitutional national capital even though the Dutch government, the parliament, the supreme court, the Council of State, and the work palace of the King are all located in The Hague, as are all the embassies. (&quot;For more details see: Capital of the Netherlands&quot;.)

Some historical examples of similar arrangements, where the recognized capital was not the official seat of government:
* Kingdom of England: The traditional capital was the City of London, while Westminster, outside of the boundaries of the City of London, was the seat of government. They are both today part of the urban core of Greater London.
* Kingdom of France: The traditional capital was Paris, though from 1682 to 1789 the seat of government was at the Palace of Versailles, located in a rural area southwest of Paris.

=== Disputed capitals ===
* Cyprus and Northern Cyprus: Nicosia, &quot;the last divided capital&quot;, is divided in two by the United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus (Green Line). Both the Republic of Cyprus, which has &quot;de facto&quot; control of the south, and the largely unrecognized Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which has &quot;de facto&quot; control of North Nicosia, claim the entire city as their capital.
* Israel and Palestine: Both the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority claim Jerusalem as their capital. Jerusalem serves as Israel&#x27;s capital, with the presidential residence, government offices, supreme court and parliament (Knesset) located there, while the Palestinian Authority has no &quot;de facto&quot; or &quot;de jure&quot; control over any of Jerusalem. Many countries, with the notable exception of the United States, which recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, take the position that the final status of Jerusalem is unsettled pending future negotiations. Most countries maintain their diplomatic missions to Israel in Tel Aviv, while diplomatic missions to Palestine are in various places such as Ramallah, Gaza City, Cairo and Damascus.

== Capital as symbol ==
With the rise of the modern nation-state, the capital city has become a symbol for the state and its government, and imbued with political meaning. Unlike medieval capitals, which were declared wherever a monarch held his or her court, the selection, relocation, founding, or capture of a modern capital city is a highly symbolic event. For example:

* The ruined and almost uninhabited Athens was made capital of newly independent Greece in 1834, four years after the country gained its independence, with the romantic notion of reviving the glory of Ancient Greece. Similarly, following the Cold War and German reunification, Berlin once again became the capital of Germany. Other restored capital cities include Moscow after the October Revolution.
* A symbolic relocation of a capital city to a geographically or demographically peripheral location may be for either economic or strategic reasons (sometimes known as a forward capital or spearhead capital). Peter the Great moved his government from Moscow to Saint Petersburg to give the Russian Empire a European orientation. The economically significant city of Nafplion became the first capital of Greece, when Athens was an unimportant village. The Ming emperors moved their capital to Beijing from the more central Nanjing to help supervise the border with the Mongols. During the 1857 rebellion, Indian rebels considered Delhi their capital, and Bahadur Shah Zafar was proclaimed emperor, but the ruling British had their capital in Calcutta. In 1877, the British formally held a &#x27;Durbar&#x27; in Delhi, proclaiming Queen Victoria as &#x27;Empress of India&#x27;. Delhi finally became the colonial capital after the Coronation Durbar of King-Emperor George V in 1911, continuing as independent India&#x27;s capital from 1947. Other examples include Abuja, Astana, Brasília, Helsinki, Islamabad, Naypyidaw, and Yamoussoukro.
* The selection or founding of a &quot;neutral&quot; capital city, one unencumbered by regional or political identities, was meant to represent the unity of a new state when Ankara, Bern, Brasília, Canberra, Madrid, Ottawa and Washington became capital cities. Sometimes, the location of a new capital city was chosen to terminate actual or potential squabbling between various entities, such as in the cases of Brasília, Canberra, Ottawa, Washington, Wellington and Managua.
* The British-built town of New Delhi represented a simultaneous break and continuity with the past, the location of Delhi being where many imperial capitals were built (Indraprastha, Dhillika, and Shahjahanabad) but the actual capital being the new British-built town designed by Edwin Lutyens. Wellington, on the southwestern tip of the North Island of New Zealand, replaced the much more northerly city of Auckland to place the national capital close to the South Island and hence to placate its residents, many of whom had sympathies with separatism.
* During the American Civil War, tremendous resources were expended to defend Washington, D.C., which bordered on the Confederate States of America (with the Commonwealth of Virginia), from Confederate attack even though the relatively small federal government could easily have been moved elsewhere. Likewise, great resources were expended by the Confederacy in defending the Confederate capital from attack by the Union, in its exposed location of Richmond, Virginia, barely south of Washington, D.C.
* Two national capitals refer to another sovereign state. The name of Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, is thought to be derived from &quot;Taani linn&quot;, originally meaning &quot;Danish Castle&quot; and now &quot;Danish Town&quot; in Estonian, named after the Toompea Castle, which Denmark controlled in 1219–1227, 1238–1332 and in 1340–1346. Port of Spain, the capital of Trinidad and Tobago, was named so in Spanish by the first settlers from Spain in the 16th century. See List of national capital city name etymologies for more.

== Capitals in military strategy ==

The capital city is usually but not always a primary target in a war, as capturing it usually guarantees capture of much of the enemy government, victory for the attacking forces, or at the very least demoralization for the defeated forces.

In ancient China, where governments were massive centralized bureaucracies with little flexibility on the provincial level, a dynasty could easily be toppled with the fall of its capital. In the Three Kingdoms period, both Shu and Wu fell when their respective capitals of Chengdu and Jianye fell. The Ming dynasty relocated its capital from Nanjing to Beijing, where they could more effectively control the generals and troops guarding the borders from Mongols and Manchus. The Ming was destroyed when Li Zicheng took their seat of power, and this pattern repeats itself in Chinese history, until the fall of the traditional Confucian monarchy in the 20th century. After the Qing dynasty&#x27;s collapse, decentralization of authority and improved transportation and communication technologies allowed both the Chinese Nationalists and Chinese Communists to rapidly relocate capitals and keep their leadership structures intact during the great crisis of Japanese invasion.

National capitals were arguably less important as military objectives in other parts of the world, including the West, because of socioeconomic trends toward localized authority, a strategic modus operandi especially popular after the development of feudalism and reaffirmed by the development of democratic and capitalistic philosophies. In 1204, after the Latin Crusaders captured the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, Byzantine forces were able to regroup in several provinces; provincial noblemen managed to reconquer the capital after 60 years and preserve the empire for another 200 years after that. The British forces sacked various American capitals repeatedly during the Revolutionary War and War of 1812, but American forces could still carry on fighting from the countryside, where they enjoyed support from local governments and the traditionally independent civilian frontiersmen. Exceptions to these generalizations include highly centralized states such as France, whose centralized bureaucracies could effectively coordinate far-flung resources, giving the state a powerful advantage over less coherent rivals, but risking utter ruin if the capital were taken.

<text>The Valley of Decision is a 1945 American drama film directed by Tay Garnett, adapted by Sonya Levien and John Meehan from Marcia Davenport&#x27;s 1942 novel of the same name. Set in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in the 1870s, it stars Greer Garson and Gregory Peck. The film was nominated for two Academy Awards for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Greer Garson) and Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture. This was Garson&#x27;s sixth nomination and her fifth consecutive, a record for most consecutive Best Actress nominations that still stands (tied with Bette Davis).

A young Irish house maid, Mary Rafferty, falls in love with Paul Scott, the son of her employer, a Pittsburgh steel mill owner. Their romance is endangered when Mary&#x27;s family and friends, all steel mill workers, go on strike against Paul&#x27;s father as the local steel industry is bought out by bigger concerns. When the Scott family refuses to sell their mill, Paul, the only son who cares about the mill and the workers, tries to intervene amid rumors the union is calling for violence under threat of strikebreakers. The Scott family, Mary and her father, and the union leader try to reach an agreement despite opposition from Paul’s brother.

==Casting==
Actor John Hodiak, who was born in Pittsburgh, was cast in the lead role during pre-production in 1943. However, Gregory Peck replaced him before shooting began. Additionally, actor Marshall Thompson replaced Hume Cronyn as Peck&#x27;s onscreen brother due to the height disparity between Peck and Cronyn. Actor Dean Stockwell, who was eight years old during filming, made his cinema debut in &quot;The Valley of Decision&quot;.

==Production==
The film was shot at Culver City with a large steel mill set designed by Cedric Gibbons and Paul Groesse. The Lot Three sets used for Pittsburgh street scenes had been originally built for &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot;. Production was briefly interrupted in July 1944 when Peck&#x27;s first son Jonathan was born. Principal filming wrapped in December 1944 with some reshoots in February 1945.

==Reception==
Bosley Crowther wrote, &quot;the early phases of the picture are rather studiously on the &#x27;cute&#x27; side&quot; and &quot;the middle phases are also somewhat artificially contrived...but the final phase...does have authority and depth;&quot;

&quot;TV Guide&quot; said it is &quot;huge (and) sprawling... the realism of the sets is a tribute to the art directors and set decorators...three out of five stars.&quot; The film was a massive hit, earning $4,566,000 in the U.S. and Canada and $3,530,000 elsewhere resulting in a profit of $3,480,000.

==Awards and honors==
*Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role - Greer Garson, Nominated
*Academy Award for Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture, Nominated
*&quot;Photoplay&quot; Gold Medal for film of the year, Won

<text>Love Letters is a 1945 American romantic film noir directed by William Dieterle from a screenplay by Ayn Rand, based on the novel &quot;Pity My Simplicity&quot; by Christopher Massie. It stars Jennifer Jones, Joseph Cotten, Ann Richards, Cecil Kellaway, Gladys Cooper and Anita Louise. The plot tells the story of a man falling in love with an amnesiac woman with two personalities, who is believed to have killed his soldier friend.

The film was nominated for four Academy Awards, including a Best Actress in a Leading Role nomination for Jones.

==Plot==
Alan Quinton, an American soldier in Italy during World War II, has been writing letters for his friend, Roger Morland, a man who admits he &quot;never had any standards, manners or taste.&quot; Alan has never met Victoria Remington, but regards her as a &quot;pin-up girl of the spirit,&quot; to whom he can express feelings he has never expressed in person. He realizes that Victoria has fallen in love with the letters and is concerned that she will be disappointed by the real Roger, who abruptly leaves for paratrooper training in England (and to see Victoria when on leave) after Alan tells him this.

Alan is subsequently injured on the Italian front and finds out that Roger is dead. He is having trouble readjusting to civilian life and spending time with his fiancée, Helen Wentworth. He decides to live at his aunt&#x27;s farm in Essex. In London, his brother takes him to a party at which he meets Dilly Carson and a woman who introduces herself as Singleton. He drunkenly tells them the story of the letters and falling in love with a woman he&#x27;s never met, and Dilly realizes he is referring to Victoria. She tells Alan that a murder was committed and the letters were somehow involved.

Alan and his fiancée realize they aren&#x27;t in love and part amicably before he moves to the farm. While in Essex, Alan sees a sign for Longreach — the address of the farm where he sent all the letters — and visits the house, where he is told that Victoria died over a year ago. He also learns that Roger was murdered by his wife, and Alan feels guilty for ever writing the letters. Back in London, Dilly informs him that Singleton is suffering from amnesia and is actually Victoria. She begs him not to tell Singleton that he wrote the letters because Victoria fell in love with Roger through the letters and married him based on them.

Dilly recounts that one day, she found Roger stabbed to death in the country house on Longreach, but Victoria was completely unable to remember what happened, even though she was holding the murder weapon right beside him. After a trial during which she cannot remember anything, she is sent to a prison psychiatric hospital for a year and then released into the care of Dilly. Victoria never regained her memory, and continues to now live as Singleton, her original name as a foundling. Singleton believes that Alan is in love with Victoria, but does not realize Victoria is actually herself. Nevertheless, Alan and Singleton marry after he gets permission from her adoptive mother, Beatrice Remington. Their marriage is troubled, however, by Alan&#x27;s love of who Singleton believes is another woman.

Beatrice returns to the farm and Singleton is drawn by her suppressed memories during a drive in the country to visit Longreach and the farm. Conversing with Beatrice, Singleton begins to remember the events of that fateful night: Victoria and an inebriated Roger argue as Victoria rereads the letters to remind herself of the man she loves and not the bitter man with her now. Roger reveals that he is not the one who wrote the letters, and he becomes abusive, striking her. Beatrice takes a knife and stabs him to death as Victoria tries to save the letters he had thrown into the fireplace.

As Alan arrives at the house, Victoria recalls her true identity and realizes that Alan was the one who wrote the letters. Then they passionately kiss.

==Adaptation and production==
The movie was one of the first produced by Hal Wallis, who had recently left his position as head of production at Warner to become a producer with Paramount.

Rand&#x27;s screenplay adaptation of Massie&#x27;s book was also influenced by Edmond Rostand&#x27;s famous play &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;. Rand had admired the work since reading it in the original French in her youth. As in Rostand&#x27;s play, the heroine falls in love with a soldier believing him to be the author of certain love letters that had been written for him by another soldier, including a moving note sent from the front. In Rand&#x27;s version, a dimension of psychological mystery is added, and the heroine discovers the identity of the true author in time for the protagonists to experience a &quot;happy ending.&quot;

&quot;Love Letters&quot; is the second of four films that featured both Jones and Cotten in leading roles. The others are &quot;Since You Went Away&quot; (1944), &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot; (1946), and &quot;Portrait of Jennie&quot; (1948).

Hal Wallis had to borrow the services of Jones and Cotten from David O. Selznick who had both actors under personal contract (along with director William Dieterle). Cotten was Wallis&#x27; second choice, after his first choice, Gregory Peck, turned down the film for being too close to &quot;Spellbound&quot;. Wallis said Selznick was difficult to deal with and tried to exert control over the film.

Ann Richards had recently been put under contract to Wallis. She and Barry Sullivan tested for the leads and for a moment it looked like they might play them but Wallis decided to cast more established stars. Richards was cast in the second female lead role.

Filming started October 1944 and ended by 1 January.

==Music==
The musical score by Victor Young was nominated for an Oscar, and featured the melody of the hit song &quot;Love Letters&quot;. The first notable release of the song, with lyrics by Edward Heyman, was by vocalist Dick Haymes whose recording peaked in popularity in September 1945. The song has been recorded by numerous artists since 1945, including Ketty Lester, Alison Moyet, Rosemary Clooney, Nat King Cole, Elvis Presley, Jack Jones, Elton John, Del Shannon, and Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, among others. The melody or song has been used in other films, including the David Lynch film &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; (1986), which features the Ketty Lester version.

==Reception==
Although critical reviews were mostly negative, &quot;Love Letters&quot; succeeded at the box office. &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer Bosley Crowther berated it as &quot;sentimental twaddle&quot;, calling Jones&#x27; performance &quot;fatuous&quot;, Rand&#x27;s writing &quot;a mucky muddle&quot;, and Dieterle&#x27;s direction &quot;mushy and pretentious&quot;.

The Chicago Tribune was indifferent: “This is one of those ‘depends’ pictures — meaning that liking it is a matter of personal taste. Incurable romantics will probably eat it up; others may have a very different reaction. ... Miss Jones does some fine acting in the last half of the film, but seems just plain silly, with affectation extending even to the way she walked, in the beginning. Mr. Cotten, as always, gives a solid and talented performance, but even he almost sinks into the morass of melodramatic verbiage and situations. No one in the film talks like a human being — every one philosophizes all over the place, even the old handyman, coyly known as ‘the gargoyle.’ Maybe I just ain’t erudite, and don’t appreciate that life isn’t a burden, etc., but except for rare moments, I found ‘Love Letters’ a distinct bore.

==Accolades==

The film was nominated in several categories at the 18th Academy Awards:
* Best Actress: Jennifer Jones
* Best Art Direction (Black-and-White): &quot;Art Direction:&quot; Hans Dreier, Roland Anderson; &quot;Interior Decoration:&quot; Sam Comer, Ray Moyer
* Music (Score of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture): Victor Young
* Academy Award for Best Original Song: &quot;Love Letters,&quot; Music by Victor Young; Lyrics by Eddie Heyman
