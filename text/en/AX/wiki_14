<text>Viktor Emil Frankl (26 March 1905 – 2 September 1997)
was an Austrian neurologist, psychologist, philosopher, and Holocaust survivor, who founded logotherapy, a school of psychotherapy that describes a search for a life&#x27;s meaning as the central human motivational force. Logotherapy is part of existential and humanistic psychology theories.

Logotherapy was promoted as the third school of Viennese Psychotherapy, after those established by Sigmund Freud and Alfred Adler.

Frankl published 39 books. The autobiographical &quot;Man&#x27;s Search for Meaning&quot;, a best-selling book, is based on his experiences in various Nazi concentration camps.

==Early life==
Frankl was born the middle of three children to Gabriel Frankl, a civil servant in the Ministry of Social Service, and Elsa (née Lion), a Jewish family, in Vienna, in what was then the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His interest in psychology and the role of meaning developed when he began taking night classes on applied psychology while in junior high school. As a teenager, he began a correspondence with Sigmund Freud when Freud asked for permission to publish one of his papers. After graduation from high school in 1923, he studied medicine at the University of Vienna.

In 1924, Frankl&#x27;s first scientific paper was published in the &quot;Internationale Zeitschrift für Psychoanalyse.&quot; In the same year, he was president of the , the Social Democratic Party of Austria&#x27;s youth movement for high school students. Frankl&#x27;s father was a socialist who named him after Viktor Adler, the founder of the party. During this time, Frankl began questioning the Freudian approach to psychoanalysis. He joined Alfred Adler&#x27;s circle of students and published his second academic paper, &quot;Psychotherapy and Worldview&quot; (), in Adler&#x27;s &quot;International Journal of Individual Psychology&quot; in 1925. Frankl was expelled from Adler&#x27;s circle when he insisted that meaning was the central motivational force in human beings. From 1926, he began refining his theory, which he termed logotherapy.

==Career==

===Psychiatry===
Between 1928 and 1930, while still a medical student, he organized youth counselling centers to address the high number of teen suicides occurring around the time of end-of-the-year report cards. The program was sponsored by the city of Vienna and free of charge to the students. Frankl recruited other psychologists for the center, including Charlotte Bühler, Erwin Wexberg, and Rudolf Dreikurs. In 1931, not a single Viennese student died by suicide.

After earning his M.D. in 1930, Frankl gained extensive experience at Steinhof Psychiatric Hospital, where he was responsible for the treatment of suicidal women. In 1937, he began a private practice, but the Nazi annexation of Austria in 1938 limited his opportunity to treat patients. In 1940, he joined Rothschild Hospital, the only hospital in Vienna still admitting Jews, as head of the neurology department. Prior to his deportation to the concentration camps, he helped numerous patients avoid the Nazi euthanasia program that targeted the mentally disabled.

In 1942, just nine months after his marriage, Frankl and his family were sent to the Theresienstadt concentration camp. His father died there of starvation and pneumonia. In 1944, Frankl and his surviving relatives were transported to Auschwitz, where his mother and brother were murdered in the gas chambers. His wife Tilly died later of typhus in Bergen-Belsen. Frankl spent three years in four concentration camps.

Following the war, he became head of the neurology department of the General Polyclinic Vienna hospital, and established a private practice in his home. He worked with patients until his retirement in 1970.

In 1948, Frankl earned a PhD in philosophy from the University of Vienna. His dissertation, &quot;The Unconscious God&quot;, examines the relationship between psychology and religion, and advocates for the use of the Socratic dialogue (self-discovery discourse) for clients to get in touch with their spiritual unconscious.
In 1955, Frankl was awarded a professorship of neurology and psychiatry at the University of Vienna, and, as visiting professor, lectured at Harvard University (1961), Southern Methodist University, Dallas (1966), and Duquesne University, Pittsburgh (1972).

Throughout his career, Frankl argued that the reductionist tendencies of early psychotherapeutic approaches dehumanised the patient, and advocated for a rehumanisation of psychotherapy.

The American Psychiatric Association awarded Frankl the 1985 Oskar Pfister Award for his contributions to religion and psychiatry.

===&quot;Man&#x27;s Search for Meaning&quot;===
While head of the Neurological Department at the general Polyclinic Hospital, Frankl wrote &quot;Man&#x27;s Search for Meaning&quot; over a nine-day period. The book, originally titled &quot;A Psychologist Experiences the Concentration Camp&quot;, was released in German in 1946. The English translation of &quot;Man&#x27;s Search for Meaning&quot; was published in 1959, and became an international bestseller. Frankl saw this success as a symptom of the &quot;mass neurosis of modern times,&quot; since the title promised to deal with the question of life&#x27;s meaningfulness. Millions of copies were sold in dozens of languages. In a 1991 survey conducted for the Library of Congress and the Book of the Month Club, &quot;Man&#x27;s Search for Meaning&quot; was named one of the ten most influential books in the US.

===Logotherapy and existential analysis===
Frankl developed logotherapy and existential analysis, which are based on philosophical and psychological concepts, particularly the desire to find a meaning in life and free will. Frankl identified three main ways of realizing meaning in life: by making a difference in the world, by having particular experiences, or by adopting particular attitudes.

The primary techniques offered by logotherapy and existential analysis are:
* Paradoxical intention: clients learn to overcome obsessions or anxieties by self-distancing and humorous exaggeration.
* Dereflection: drawing the client&#x27;s attention away from their symptoms, as hyper-reflection can lead to inaction.
* Socratic dialogue and attitude modification: asking questions designed to help a client find and pursue self-defined meaning in life.

His acknowledgement of meaning as a central motivational force and factor in mental health is his lasting contribution to the field of psychology. It provided the foundational principles for the emerging field of positive psychology. Frankl&#x27;s work has also been endorsed in the Chabad philosophy of Hasidic Judaism.

=== Statue of Responsibility ===
In &quot;Man&#x27;s Search for Meaning&quot;, Frankl states&quot;:&quot;&quot;Freedom, however, is not the last word. Freedom is only part of the story and half of the truth. Freedom is but the negative aspect of the whole phenomenon whose positive aspect is responsibleness. In fact, freedom is in danger of degenerating into mere arbitrariness unless it is lived in terms of responsibleness. That is why I recommend that the Statue of Liberty on the East Coast be supplemented by a Statue of Responsibility on the West Coast&quot;.Frankl&#x27;s concept for the statue grew in popularity, and drew the affection of Stephen Covey, author of &quot;The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.&quot; Covey teamed up with Kevin Hall to push the idea of the statue forward in the 1990s, and eventually commissioned the sculptor Gary Lee Price who came up with the concept of two hands clasped together. The design was approved by Frankl&#x27;s widow, and they began looking for a location to construct it. Their first choice was California, to have it in a Pacific Ocean harbour to complement the Statue of Liberty&#x27;s position in the Atlantic harbour of New York. However, the state regulations proved difficult to navigate, and the governor of Utah, Spencer Cox, suggested a location in his state for the project, which was approved in 2023. Construction has not yet started.

== Controversy ==

=== &quot;Auschwitz survivor&quot; testimony ===
In &quot;The Missing Pieces of the Puzzle: A Reflection on the Odd Career of Viktor Frankl&quot;, Professor of history Timothy Pytell of California State University, San Bernardino, surveys the numerous discrepancies and omissions in Frankl&#x27;s &quot;Auschwitz survivor&quot; account and later autobiography, which many of his contemporaries, such as Thomas Szasz, similarly have raised. In Frankl&#x27;s &quot;Man&#x27;s Search for Meaning&quot;, the book devotes approximately half of its contents to describing Auschwitz and the psychology of its prisoners, suggesting a long stay at the death camp. However his wording is contradictory and, according to Pytell, &quot;profoundly deceptive&quot;, as contrary to the impression Frankl gives of staying at Auschwitz for months, he was held close to the train, in the &quot;depot prisoner&quot; area of Auschwitz, and for no more than a few days. Frankl was neither registered at Auschwitz nor assigned a number there before being sent on to a subsidiary work camp of Dachau, known as Kaufering III, that (together with Terezín) is the true setting of much of what is described in his book.

=== Origins and implications of logotherapy ===
Frankl&#x27;s doctrine was that one must instill meaning in the events in one&#x27;s life, and that work and suffering can lead to finding meaning, with this ultimately what would lead to fulfillment and happiness. In 1982 the scholar and Holocaust analyst Lawrence L. Langer, critical of what he called Frankl&#x27;s distortions of the true experience of those at Auschwitz, and of Frankl&#x27;s amoral focus on &quot;meaning&quot;, that in Langer&#x27;s assessment could just as equally be applied to Nazis &quot;finding meaning in making the world free from Jews&quot;, went on to write that &quot;if this [logotherapy] doctrine had been more succinctly worded, the Nazis might have substituted it for the cruel mockery of Arbeit Macht Frei&quot; [&quot;work sets free&quot;, read by those entering Auschwitz]. In Pytell&#x27;s view, Langer also penetrated through Frankl&#x27;s disturbing subtext that Holocaust &quot;survival [was] a matter of mental health.&quot; Langer criticized Frankl&#x27;s tone as self-congratulatory and promotional throughout, so that &quot;it comes as no surprise to the reader, as he closes the volume, that the real hero of &quot;Man&#x27;s Search for Meaning&quot; is not man, but Viktor Frankl&quot; by the continuation of the same fantasy of world-view meaning-making, which is precisely what had perturbed civilization into the holocaust-genocide of this era and others.

Pytell later would remark on the particularly sharp insight of Langer&#x27;s reading of Frankl&#x27;s Holocaust testimony, stating that with Langer&#x27;s criticism published in 1982 before Pytell&#x27;s biography, the former had thus drawn the controversial parallels, or accommodations in ideology without the knowledge that Victor Frankl was an advocate/&quot;embraced&quot; the key ideas of the Nazi psychotherapy movement (&quot;will and responsibility&quot;) as a form of therapy in the late 1930s. When at that time Frankl would submit a paper and contributed to the Göring institute in Vienna 1937 and again in early 1938 connecting the logotherapy focus on &quot;world-view&quot; to the &quot;work of some of the leading Nazi psychotherapists&quot;, both at a time before Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938. Frankl&#x27;s founding logotherapy paper, was submitted to and published in the the journal of the Goering Institute, a psychotherapy movement, with the &quot;proclaimed agenda of building psychotherapy that affirmed a Nazi-oriented worldview&quot;.

The origins of logotherapy, as described by Frankl, were therefore a major issue of continuity that Pytell argues were potentially problematic for Frankl because he had laid out the main elements of logotherapy while working for/contributing to the Nazi-affiliated Göring Institute. Principally Frankl&#x27;s 1937 paper, that was published by the institute. This association, as a source of controversy, that logotherapy was palatable to Nazism is the reason Pytell suggests, Frankl took two different stances on how the concentration-camp experience affected the course of his psychotherapy theory. Namely, that within the original English edition of Frankl&#x27;s most well known book, &quot;Man&#x27;s Search for Meaning&quot;, the suggestion is made and still largely held that logotherapy was itself derived from his camp experience, with the claim as it appears in the original edition, that this form of psychotherapy was &quot;not concocted in the philosopher&#x27;s armchair nor at the analyst&#x27;s couch; it took shape in the hard school of air-raid shelters and bomb craters; in concentration camps and prisoner of war camps.&quot; Frankl&#x27;s statements however to this effect would be deleted from later editions, though in the 1963 edition, a similar statement again appeared on the back of the book jacket of &quot;Man&#x27;s Search for Meaning&quot;.

Frankl over the years would with these widely read statements and others, switch between the idea that logotherapy took shape in the camps to the claim that the camps merely were a testing ground of his already preconceived theories. An uncovering of the matter would occur in 1977 with Frankl revealing on this controversy, though compounding another, stating &quot;People think I came out of Auschwitz with a brand-new psychotherapy. This is not the case.&quot;

=== Jewish relations and experiments on the resistance ===
In the post war years, Frankl&#x27;s attitude towards not pursuing justice nor assigning collective guilt to the Austrian people for collaborating with or acquiescing in the face of Nazism, led to &quot;frayed&quot; relationships between Frankl, many Viennese and the larger American Jewish community, such that in 1978 when attempting to give a lecture at the institute of Adult Jewish Studies in New York, Frankl was confronted with an outburst of boos from the audience and was called a &quot;nazi pig&quot;. Frankl supported forgiveness and held that many in Germany and Austria were powerless to do anything about the atrocities which occurred and could not be collectively blamed.

In 1988 Frankl would further &quot;stir up sentiment against him&quot; by being photographed next to and in accepting the Great Silver Medal with Star for Services to the Republic of Austria as a Holocaust survivor, from President Waldheim, a controversial president of Austria who concurrent with the medal ceremony, was gripped by revelations that he had lied about his WWII military record and was under investigation for complicity in Nazi War crimes. It was later concluded that he was not involved in war crimes but had knowledge of them. Frankl&#x27;s acceptance of the medal was viewed by many in the international Jewish community as a betrayal. 

In his &quot;Gutachten&quot; Gestapo profile, Frankl is described as &quot;politically perfect&quot; by the Nazi secret police, with Frankl&#x27;s membership in the Austro-fascist &quot;Fatherland Front&quot; in 1934, similarly stated in isolation. It has been suggested that as a state employee in a hospital he was likely automatically signed up to the party regardless of whether he wanted to or not. Frankl was interviewed twice by the secret police during the war, yet nothing of the expected contents, the subject of discussion or any further information on these interviews, is contained in Frankl&#x27;s file, suggesting to biographers that Frankl&#x27;s file was &quot;cleansed&quot; sometime after the war.

None of Frankl&#x27;s obituaries mention the unqualified and unskilled brain lobotomy and trepanation medical experiments approved by the Nazis that Frankl performed on Jews who had committed suicide with an overdose of sedatives, in resistance to their impending arrest, imprisonment and enforced labour in the concentration camp system. The goal of these experiments were to try and revive those who had killed themselves, Frankl justified this by saying that he was trying to find ways to save the lives of Jews. Operating without any training as a surgeon, Frankl would voluntarily request of the Nazis to perform the experiments on those who had killed themselves, and once approved – published some of the details on his experiments, the methods of insertion of his chosen amphetamine drugs into the brains of these individuals, resulting in, at times, an alleged partial resuscitation, mainly in 1942 (prior to his own internment at Theresienstadt ghetto in September, later in that year). Historian Günter Bischof of Harvard University, suggests Frankl&#x27;s approaching and requesting to perform lobotomy experiments could be seen as a way to &quot;ingratiate&quot; himself amongst the Nazis, as the latter were not, at that time, appreciative of the international scrutiny that these suicides were beginning to create, nor &quot;suicide&quot; being listed on arrest records.

===Response to Timothy Pytell===
Timothy Pytell&#x27;s critique towards Viktor Frankl was used by Holocaust denier Theodore O&#x27;Keefe, according to Alexander Batthyány. Batthyány was a researcher and member of staff of the Viktor Frankl Archive in Vienna. Throughout the first chapter of his book &quot;Viktor Frankl and the Shoah&quot;, he reflects on Pytell&#x27;s work about Frankl, and the flaws in it. Batthyány points out that Pytell never visited the archive to consult primary sources from the person about whom he was writing. Batthyány also critiques Pytell for not interviewing Viktor Frankl while Frankl was still alive. Pytell wrote in his book on Frankl that he had the opportunity to meet him – as a friend offered it – yet he decided that he could not meet Frankl.

==Personal life==
In 1941, Frankl married Tilly Grosser, who was a station nurse at Rothschild Hospital. Soon after they were married she became pregnant, but they were forced to abort the child. Tilly died in the Bergen Belsen concentration camp.

Frankl&#x27;s father, Gabriel, originally from Pohořelice, Moravia, died in the Theresienstadt Ghetto concentration camp on 13 February 1943, aged 81, from starvation and pneumonia. His mother and brother, Walter, were both killed in Auschwitz. His sister, Stella, escaped to Australia.

In 1947, Frankl married Eleonore &quot;Elly&quot; Katharina Schwindt. She was a practicing Catholic. The couple respected each other&#x27;s religious backgrounds, both attending church and synagogue, and celebrating Christmas and Hanukkah. Although it was not known for 50 years, his wife and son-in-law reported after his death that he prayed every day and had memorized the words of daily Jewish prayers and psalms.

Viktor and Elly Frankl had one daughter, Gabriele, who went on to become a child psychologist. Frankl&#x27;s grandson, Alexander Vesely, is a licensed psychotherapist, producer and documentary film director, who co-founded the Viktor Frankl Institute of America. Alexander Vesely produced, filmed, and edited the documentary &quot;Viktor &amp; I&quot;.

Frankl died of heart failure in Vienna on 2 September 1997. He is buried in the Jewish section of the Vienna Central Cemetery.

<text>Meja Anna Pernilla Kullersten (formerly Beckman; born Anna Pernilla Torndahl, 12 February 1969) is a Swedish composer, artist and singer. Among her best known songs are &quot;Happy&quot; (with Legacy of Sound), &quot;Private Emotion&quot;, a duet with Ricky Martin from his multi-Platinum album &quot;Ricky Martin&quot; (1999), and &quot;All &#x27;Bout the Money&quot;, which was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1998.

==Biography==

Meja was born Anna Pernilla Torndahl in Nynäshamn, Stockholm County. She had her stage debut at &quot;Ystads City theatre&quot; at the age of 7. She was brought up in a musical family, her grandfather, Per Lundkvist, was a composer of both classical and contemporary music and her mother, a recording artist as a child before choosing a path as a painter.

In 1986, at the age of 16, she moved to Mallorca, Spain, to study. She was introduced to American jazz trumpet player/singer Stephen Frankevich and started to take vocal lessons with singer Deborah Carter.

Meja went to Stockholm in 1990. She sang in different bands there before getting out on tour as a backup singer for the Swedish group Rob n Raz DLC in 1991. In 1992 Meja moved to Los Angeles to continue her studies at the Musicians Institute in Hollywood. She graduated from the vocal program in late 1992 then returned to Sweden.

===Legacy of Sound (1993–1995)===
In 1993, Meja worked with the dance project Legacy of Sound. She co-wrote with Anders Bagge the first single, &quot;Happy&quot;, from the album &quot;Holy Groove&quot;. The song reached the Top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart, and it peaked at number 68 on the Top 100 during a 12-week stay on the chart. &quot;Happy&quot; was released in over 20 countries. Meja recorded one more album with Legacy of Sound in 1994, &quot;Tour de Force&quot;.

===Solo artist ===
Meja teamed in 1995 with Swedish manager Lasse Karlsson, manager of Ace of Base, and writer/producer Douglas Carr to provide the vocals for the demo The Juvenile titled The Goldeneye.

The first solo album &quot;Meja&quot;, was released in 1996, with songs co-written by Billy Steinberg. In 1997 Meja had her first concert tour in Japan: The Flower Girl Jam Tour.

Meja released the album &quot;Seven Sisters&quot; in 1998. Later that year Columbia (Sony) launched the album in the U.S with the single &quot;How Crazy Are You?&quot; That song would later be notable for its use as the theme song for &quot;Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball&quot;.

===&quot;Realitales&quot; (2000)===
Meja went to Miami in 1999 to record &quot;Private Emotion&quot;, a duet with Ricky Martin for his debut album &quot;Ricky Martin&quot;. After shooting a video for the song, Meja stayed in Los Angeles to work on her next album &quot;Realitales&quot; (2000) with Steinberg. She also co-wrote two tracks for the album in London with Stephen Lipson. The artwork for this album was shot by Swedish director Jonas Åkerlund.

===&quot;Mellow&quot; (2004)===
In 2003 Meja started to work with her former Sony Music boss, Richard Ogden. The album &quot;Mellow&quot; was released in 2004, with songs in Portuguese (&quot;Água de Beber&quot;, &quot;Dindi&quot;) and Spanish. She covered a Caetano Veloso song &quot;O&#x27;Leaonzinho&quot; that she named &quot;Little Lion.&quot; The album was produced by Hamish Stuart. One song, &quot;Simple Days-Walking the Distance&quot;, was used in the Japanese film &quot;Lakeside Murder Case&quot;.

===&quot;NU Essential&quot; (2005)===
Sony Music Japan released Meja&#x27;s album &quot;NU Essential&quot; in 2005.

===&quot;Urban Gypsy&quot; (2009)===
In 2006 Meja went back to Los Angeles to collaborate again with Steinberg on a new album, also working with writers Jeff Barry, Billy Gibbons, Jed Leiber and Boz Boorer.

The first single &quot;At the Rainbow&#x27;s End&quot; was released in June 2009, the second single &quot;Regrets (I Have None)&quot; in August, and the album &quot;Urban Gypsy&quot; was released on her own label Seven Sisters Network in October on a license deal with Sony Music. A remix of Mando Diao&#x27;s &quot;Dance with Somebody&quot; was released early 2010.

===&quot;AniMeja&quot; (2010)===
As a tribute to the Japanese Studio Ghibli, Meja released an album on which she covered soundtrack songs from Japanese films.

===&quot;Stroboscope Sky&quot; (2015)===
The first release from the album &quot;Stroboscope Sky&quot; was the single &quot;Blame it on the Shadows&quot; (2013) produced by Ebbot Lundberg. Meja teamed with producer Nicolas Gunthardt and together with his sister Alessandra they wrote &quot;Yellow Ribbon&quot; which served as the theme song for the album. &quot;Yellow Ribbon&quot; was released as a single in collaboration with Amnesty International/Free the Angola 3 to help raise awareness of the case of Albert Woodfox. A remix EP was released with remixes by Deep Forest, Dj Swami, Gota Yashiki, DF Tram, NORD and more.

<doc id="177318" wikidata="Q494950" url="?curid=177318" title="List of data structures">
<text>This is a list of well-known data structures. For a wider list of terms, see list of terms relating to algorithms and data structures. For a comparison of running times for a subset of this list see comparison of data structures.
== Data types ==

=== Primitive types ===

*Boolean, true or false.
*Character
*Floating-point representation of a finite subset of the rationals.
** Including single-precision and double-precision IEEE 754 floats, among others
*Fixed-point representation of the rationals
*Integer, a direct representation of either the integers or the non-negative integers
*Reference, sometimes erroneously referred to as a pointer or handle, is a value that refers to another value, possibly including itself
*Symbol, a unique identifier
*Enumerated type, a set of symbols
*Complex, representation of complex numbers

=== Composite types or non-primitive type ===

*Array, a sequence of elements of the same type stored contiguously in memory
*Record (also called a structure or struct), a collection of fields
**Product type (also called a tuple), a record in which the fields are not named
*String, a sequence of characters representing text
*Union, a datum which may be one of a set of types
*Tagged union (also called a &quot;variant&quot;, &quot;discriminated union&quot; or &quot;sum type&quot;), a union with a tag specifying which type the data is

=== Abstract data types ===

*Container
*List
*Tuple
*Associative array, Map
*Multimap
*Set
*Multiset (bag)
*Stack
*Queue (example Priority queue)
*Double-ended queue
*Graph (example Tree, Heap)

Some properties of abstract data types:
&quot;Ordered&quot; means that the elements of the data type have some kind of explicit order to them, where an element can be considered &quot;before&quot; or &quot;after&quot; another element. This order is usually determined by the order in which the elements are added to the structure, but the elements can be rearranged in some contexts, such as sorting a list. For a structure that isn&#x27;t ordered, on the other hand, no assumptions can be made about the ordering of the elements (although a physical implementation of these data types will often apply some kind of arbitrary ordering). &quot;Uniqueness&quot; means that duplicate elements are not allowed. Depending on the implementation of the data type, attempting to add a duplicate element may either be ignored, overwrite the existing element, or raise an error. The detection for duplicates is based on some inbuilt (or alternatively, user-defined) rule for comparing elements.

<doc id="177320" wikidata="Q212111" url="?curid=177320" title="Spectral line">
<text>A spectral line is a weaker or stronger region in an otherwise uniform and continuous spectrum. It may result from emission or absorption of light in a narrow frequency range, compared with the nearby frequencies. Spectral lines are often used to identify atoms and molecules. These &quot;fingerprints&quot; can be compared to the previously collected ones of atoms and molecules, and are thus used to identify the atomic and molecular components of stars and planets, which would otherwise be impossible.

== Types of line spectra ==
Spectral lines are the result of interaction between a quantum system (usually atoms, but sometimes molecules or atomic nuclei) and a single photon. When a photon has about the right amount of energy (which is connected to its frequency) to allow a change in the energy state of the system (in the case of an atom this is usually an electron changing orbitals), the photon is absorbed. Then the energy will be spontaneously re-emitted, either as one photon at the same frequency as the original one or in a cascade, where the sum of the energies of the photons emitted will be equal to the energy of the one absorbed (assuming the system returns to its original state).

A spectral line may be observed either as an &quot;emission line&quot; or an &quot;absorption line&quot;. Which type of line is observed depends on the type of material and its temperature relative to another emission source. An absorption line is produced when photons from a hot, broad spectrum source pass through a cooler material. The intensity of light, over a narrow frequency range, is reduced due to absorption by the material and re-emission in random directions. By contrast, a bright emission line is produced when photons from a hot material are detected, perhaps in the presence of a broad spectrum from a cooler source. The intensity of light, over a narrow frequency range, is increased due to emission by the hot material.

Spectral lines are highly atom-specific, and can be used to identify the chemical composition of any medium. Several elements, including helium, thallium, and caesium, were discovered by spectroscopic means. Spectral lines also depend on the temperature and density of the material, so they are widely used to determine the physical conditions of stars and other celestial bodies that cannot be analyzed by other means.

Depending on the material and its physical conditions, the energy of the involved photons can vary widely, with the spectral lines observed across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to gamma rays.

==Nomenclature==
Strong spectral lines in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum often have a unique Fraunhofer line designation, such as K for a line at 393.366 nm emerging from singly-ionized calcium atom, Ca+, though some of the Fraunhofer &quot;lines&quot; are blends of multiple lines from several different species.

In other cases, the lines are designated according to the level of ionization by adding a Roman numeral to the designation of the chemical element. Neutral atoms are denoted with the Roman numeral I, singly ionized atoms with II, and so on, so that, for example:

Cu II copper ion with +1 charge, Cu1+

Fe III iron ion with +2 charge, Fe2+

More detailed designations usually include the line wavelength and may include a multiplet number (for atomic lines) or band designation (for molecular lines). Many spectral lines of atomic hydrogen also have designations within their respective series, such as the Lyman series or Balmer series. Originally all spectral lines were classified into series: the &quot;principal series&quot;, &quot;sharp series&quot;, and &quot;diffuse series&quot;. These series exist across atoms of all elements, and the patterns for all atoms are well-predicted by the Rydberg-Ritz formula. These series were later associated with suborbitals.

== Line broadening and shift ==
There are a number of effects which control spectral line shape. A spectral line extends over a tiny spectral band with a nonzero range of frequencies, not a single frequency (i.e., a nonzero spectral width). In addition, its center may be shifted from its nominal central wavelength. There are several reasons for this broadening and shift. These reasons may be divided into two general categories – broadening due to local conditions and broadening due to extended conditions. Broadening due to local conditions is due to effects which hold in a small region around the emitting element, usually small enough to assure local thermodynamic equilibrium. Broadening due to extended conditions may result from changes to the spectral distribution of the radiation as it traverses its path to the observer. It also may result from the combining of radiation from a number of regions which are far from each other.

=== Broadening due to local effects ===

==== Natural broadening ====
The lifetime of excited states results in natural broadening, also known as lifetime broadening. The uncertainty principle relates the lifetime of an excited state (due to spontaneous radiative decay or the Auger process) with the uncertainty of its energy. 
Some authors use the term &quot;radiative broadening&quot; to refer specifically to the part of natural broadening caused by the spontaneous radiative decay.
A short lifetime will have a large energy uncertainty and a broad emission. This broadening effect results in an unshifted Lorentzian profile. The natural broadening can be experimentally altered only to the extent that decay rates can be artificially suppressed or enhanced.

==== Thermal Doppler broadening ====

The atoms in a gas which are emitting radiation will have a distribution of velocities. Each photon emitted will be &quot;red&quot;- or &quot;blue&quot;-shifted by the Doppler effect depending on the velocity of the atom relative to the observer. The higher the temperature of the gas, the wider the distribution of velocities in the gas. Since the spectral line is a combination of all of the emitted radiation, the higher the temperature of the gas, the broader the spectral line emitted from that gas. This broadening effect is described by a Gaussian profile and there is no associated shift.

==== Pressure broadening ====
The presence of nearby particles will affect the radiation emitted by an individual particle. There are two limiting cases by which this occurs:

* &quot;Impact pressure broadening&quot; or &quot;collisional broadening&quot;: The collision of other particles with the light emitting particle interrupts the emission process, and by shortening the characteristic time for the process, increases the uncertainty in the energy emitted (as occurs in natural broadening). The duration of the collision is much shorter than the lifetime of the emission process. This effect depends on both the density and the temperature of the gas. The broadening effect is described by a Lorentzian profile and there may be an associated shift.
* &quot;Quasistatic pressure broadening&quot;: The presence of other particles shifts the energy levels in the emitting particle (see spectral band), thereby altering the frequency of the emitted radiation. The duration of the influence is much longer than the lifetime of the emission process. This effect depends on the density of the gas, but is rather insensitive to temperature. The form of the line profile is determined by the functional form of the perturbing force with respect to distance from the perturbing particle. There may also be a shift in the line center. The general expression for the lineshape resulting from quasistatic pressure broadening is a 4-parameter generalization of the Gaussian distribution known as a stable distribution.

Pressure broadening may also be classified by the nature of the perturbing force as follows:

* &quot;Linear Stark broadening&quot; occurs via the linear Stark effect, which results from the interaction of an emitter with an electric field of a charged particle at a distance formula_1, causing a shift in energy that is linear in the field strength. formula_2
* &quot;Resonance broadening&quot; occurs when the perturbing particle is of the same type as the emitting particle, which introduces the possibility of an energy exchange process. formula_3
* &quot;Quadratic Stark broadening&quot; occurs via the quadratic Stark effect, which results from the interaction of an emitter with an electric field, causing a shift in energy that is quadratic in the field strength. formula_4
* &quot;Van der Waals broadening&quot; occurs when the emitting particle is being perturbed by Van der Waals forces. For the quasistatic case, a Van der Waals profile is often useful in describing the profile. The energy shift as a function of distance between the interacting particles is given in the wings by e.g. the Lennard-Jones potential. formula_5

==== Inhomogeneous broadening ====
&quot;Inhomogeneous broadening&quot; is a general term for broadening because some emitting particles are in a different local environment from others, and therefore emit at a different frequency. This term is used especially for solids, where surfaces, grain boundaries, and stoichiometry variations can create a variety of local environments for a given atom to occupy. In liquids, the effects of inhomogeneous broadening is sometimes reduced by a process called &quot;motional narrowing&quot;.

=== Broadening due to non-local effects ===
Certain types of broadening are the result of conditions over a large region of space rather than simply upon conditions that are local to the emitting particle.

==== Opacity broadening ====
Opacity broadening is an example of a non-local broadening mechanism. Electromagnetic radiation emitted at a particular point in space can be reabsorbed as it travels through space. This absorption depends on wavelength. The line is broadened because the photons at the line center have a greater reabsorption probability than the photons at the line wings. Indeed, the reabsorption near the line center may be so great as to cause a self reversal in which the intensity at the center of the line is less than in the wings. This process is also sometimes called self-absorption.

==== Macroscopic Doppler broadening ====
Radiation emitted by a moving source is subject to Doppler shift due to a finite line-of-sight velocity projection. If different parts of the emitting body have different velocities (along the line of sight), the resulting line will be broadened, with the line width proportional to the width of the velocity distribution. For example, radiation emitted from a distant rotating body, such as a star, will be broadened due to the line-of-sight variations in velocity on opposite sides of the star (this effect usually referred to as rotational broadening). The greater the rate of rotation, the broader the line. Another example is an imploding plasma shell in a Z-pinch.

=== Combined effects ===
Each of these mechanisms can act in isolation or in combination with others. Assuming each effect is independent, the observed line profile is a convolution of the line profiles of each mechanism. For example, a combination of the thermal Doppler broadening and the impact pressure broadening yields a Voigt profile.

However, the different line broadening mechanisms are not always independent. For example, the collisional effects and the motional Doppler shifts can act in a coherent manner, resulting under some conditions even in a collisional &quot;narrowing&quot;, known as the Dicke effect.

==Spectral lines of chemical elements==

===Bands===
The phrase &quot;spectral lines&quot;, when not qualified, usually refers to lines having wavelengths in the visible band of the full electromagnetic spectrum. Many spectral lines occur at wavelengths outside this range. At shorter wavelengths, which correspond to higher energies, ultraviolet spectral lines include the Lyman series of hydrogen. At the much shorter wavelengths of X-rays, the lines are known as characteristic X-rays because they remain largely unchanged for a given chemical element, independent of their chemical environment. Longer wavelengths correspond to lower energies, where the infrared spectral lines include the Paschen series of hydrogen. At even longer wavelengths, the radio spectrum includes the 21-cm line used to detect neutral hydrogen throughout the cosmos.

<text>Tabula (Byzantine Greek: τάβλι), meaning a plank or board, was a Greco-Roman board game for two players that has given its name to the tables family of games of which backgammon is a member.

==History==

According to the &quot;Etymologiae&quot; by Isidore of Seville, tabula was first invented by a Greek soldier of the Trojan War named Alea. The earliest description of &quot;τάβλι&quot; (tavli) is in an epigram of Byzantine emperor Zeno (r. 474–475; 476–491), given by Agathias of Myrine (6th century AD), who describes a game in which Zeno goes from a strong position to a very weak one after an unfortunate dice roll. The rules of Tabula were reconstructed in the 19th century by Becq de Fouquières based upon this epigram. The game was played on a board with a similar layout to that of a modern backgammon board: there were 24 points, 12 on each side. Two players had 15 pieces each, and moved them in the same directionanticlockwisearound the board, according to the roll of three dice. A piece resting alone in a space on the board (a singleton) was vulnerable to being captured. If a piece was moved to a point occupied by an enemy singleton, the latter was sent off the board and had to be re-entered on the next turn. The known differences compared with modern backgammon were: three dice were used, all pieces started the board, both players moved in the same direction and there was no doubling die. It is not known whether players had to re-enter &#x27;hit&#x27; pieces playing those on the board, nor whether players had to gather all pieces in the fourth quadrant before bearing off. It is also not clear whether there was a &quot;bar&quot;.

In the epigram, Zeno was white (red in illustration) and had one point with seven pieces on it, three points with two pieces and two singletons (pieces that stand alone on a point and were therefore in danger of being put outside the board by an incoming opposing piece). Zeno threw the three dice with which the game was played and obtained 2, 5, and 6. Zeno could not move to a space occupied by two opposing (black) pieces. The white and black pieces were so distributed on the points that the only way to use all of the three results, as required by the game rules, was to break the three points with two pieces into singletons, thus exposing them to capture and ruining the game for Zeno.

Tabula was most likely a later refinement of &quot;ludus duodecim scriptorum&quot;, with the board&#x27;s middle row of points removed, and only the two outer rows remaining.

Today, the word Tavli (τάβλι) is still used to refer to various tables games in Greece, as well as in Syria and Turkey (as &quot;tavla&quot;), Bulgaria (as &quot;tabla&quot;) and in Romania (as &quot;table&quot;); in these countries, tables games remain popular in town squares and cafes.

<text>Mars Pathfinder was an American robotic spacecraft that landed a base station with a roving probe on Mars in 1997. It consisted of a lander, renamed the [[Carl Sagan]] Memorial Station, and a lightweight, wheeled robotic Mars rover named &quot;Sojourner&quot;, the first rover to operate outside the Earth–Moon system.

Launched on December 4, 1996, by NASA aboard a Delta II booster a month after the &quot;Mars Global Surveyor&quot;, it landed on July 4, 1997, on Mars&#x27;s Ares Vallis, in a region called Chryse Planitia in the Oxia Palus quadrangle. The lander then opened, exposing the rover which conducted many experiments on the Martian surface. The mission carried a series of scientific instruments to analyze the Martian atmosphere, climate, and geology and the composition of its rocks and soil. It was the second project from NASA&#x27;s Discovery Program, which promotes the use of low-cost spacecraft and frequent launches under the motto &quot;cheaper, faster and better&quot; promoted by then-administrator Daniel Goldin. The mission was directed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), a division of the California Institute of Technology, responsible for NASA&#x27;s Mars Exploration Program. The project manager was JPL&#x27;s Tony Spear.

This mission was the first of a series of missions to Mars that included rovers, and was the first successful lander since the two &quot;Vikings&quot; landed on Mars in 1976. Although the Soviet Union successfully sent rovers to the Moon as part of the Lunokhod program in the 1970s, its attempts to use rovers in its Mars program failed.

In addition to scientific objectives, the &quot;Mars Pathfinder&quot; mission was also a &quot;proof-of-concept&quot; for various technologies, such as airbag-mediated touchdown and automated obstacle avoidance, both later exploited by the Mars Exploration Rover mission. The &quot;Mars Pathfinder&quot; was also remarkable for its extremely low cost relative to other robotic space missions to Mars. Originally, the mission was conceived as the first of the Mars Environmental Survey (MESUR) program.

==Mission objectives==
* To prove that the development of &quot;faster, better and cheaper&quot; spacecraft was possible (with three years for development and a cost under $150 million for the lander, and $25 million for the rover).
* To show that it was possible to send a load of scientific instruments to another planet with a simple system and at one-fifteenth the cost of a Viking mission. (For comparison, the Viking missions cost $935 million in 1974 or $3.5 billion in 1997 dollars.)
* To demonstrate NASA&#x27;s commitment to low-cost planetary exploration by finishing the mission with a total expenditure of $280 million, including the launch vehicle and mission operations.

==Science experiments==

The &quot;Mars Pathfinder&quot; conducted different investigations on the Martian soil using three scientific instruments. The lander contained a stereoscopic camera with spatial filters on an expandable pole called Imager for Mars Pathfinder (IMP), and the Atmospheric Structure Instrument/Meteorology Package (ASI/MET) which acted as a Mars meteorological station, collecting data about pressure, temperature, and winds. The MET structure included three windsocks mounted at three heights on a pole, the topmost at about and generally registered winds from the West.

The &quot;Sojourner&quot; rover had an Alpha Proton X-ray Spectrometer (APXS), which was used to analyze the components of the rocks and soil. The rover also had two black-and-white cameras and a color one. These instruments could investigate the geology of the Martian surface from just a few millimeters to many hundreds of meters, the geochemistry and evolutionary history of the rocks and surface, the magnetic and mechanical properties of the land, as well as the magnetic properties of the dust, atmosphere and the rotational and orbital dynamics of the planet.

The rover was equipped with three CCD cameras, all manufactured by Eastman Kodak Company and controlled by the rover&#x27;s CPU. The two front-facing monochrome cameras served navigation purposes and were coupled with five laser stripe projectors for stereoscopic hazard detection. These front cameras had a resolution of 484 vertical by 768 horizontal pixels, and an optical resolution capable of discerning details as small as across a range of . Images from these cameras could be compressed using the block truncation coding (BTC) algorithm.

The third camera, situated at the rear near the APXS, was used for color imaging. It shared the resolution of the front cameras but was rotated 90 degrees to capture images of both the APXS target area and the rover&#x27;s tracks. This rear camera featured a 4x4 pixel block with specific color sensitivities: 12 pixels for green, two for red, and two for infrared. All cameras employed lenses made of zinc selenide, which blocks light wavelengths below 500 nm; as a result, the blue/infrared pixels effectively detected only infrared light. Each camera had auto-exposure and bad-pixel handling functions. Image parameters, such as exposure time and compression settings, were included in the transmitted image headers. If BTC compression was to be used on the rear camera, the color information would need to be discarded.

The IMP had a set of filters designed to record surface and atmospheric phenomena. There were two cameras, or eyes, allowing for stereoscopic imagery, with the set of filters being slightly different between them. 
==== Atmospheric and meteorological sensors (ASI/MET) ====

The ASI/MET recorded temperature, pressure and wind data, during entry and descent, and once on the surface. It also housed electronics for sensor operation and data recording.

==Landing site==
The landing site was an ancient flood plain in Mars&#x27;s northern hemisphere called &quot;Ares Vallis&quot; (&quot;the valley of Ares&quot;, the ancient Greek equivalent of the ancient Roman deity Mars) and is among the rockiest parts of Mars. Scientists chose it because they found it to be a relatively safe surface to land on and one that contained a wide variety of rocks deposited during a catastrophic flood. After the landing, at , succeeded, the lander received the name &quot;The Carl Sagan Memorial Station&quot; in honor of the astronomer. (See also List of extraterrestrial memorials)

==Entry, descent and landing==

&quot;Mars Pathfinder&quot; entered the Martian atmosphere and landed using an innovative system involving an entry capsule, a supersonic parachute, followed by solid rockets and large airbags to cushion the impact.

&quot;Mars Pathfinder&quot; directly entered Mars atmosphere in a retrograde direction from a hyperbolic trajectory at using an atmospheric entry aeroshell (capsule) that was derived from the original Viking Mars lander design. The aeroshell consisted of a back shell and a specially designed ablative heatshield to slow to where a supersonic disk-gap-band parachute was inflated to slow its descent through the thin Martian atmosphere to . The lander&#x27;s on-board computer used redundant on-board accelerometers to determine the timing of the parachute inflation. Twenty seconds later the heatshield was pyrotechnically released. Another twenty seconds later the lander was separated and lowered from the backshell on a bridle. When the lander reached above the surface, a radar was used by the on-board computer to determine altitude and descent velocity. This information was used by the computer to determine the precise timing of the landing events that followed.
Once the lander was above the ground, airbags were inflated in less than a second using three gas generators. The airbags were made of four inter-connected multi-layer vectran bags that surrounded the tetrahedron lander. They were designed and tested to accommodate grazing angle impacts as high as . However, as the airbags were designed for no more than about vertical impacts, three solid retrorockets were mounted above the lander in the backshell. These were fired at above the ground. The lander&#x27;s on-board computer estimated the best time to fire the rockets and cut the bridle so that the lander velocity would be reduced to about zero between above the ground. After 2.3 seconds, while the rockets were still firing, the lander cut the bridle loose about above the ground and fell to the ground. The rockets flew up and away with the backshell and parachute (they have since been sighted by orbital images). The lander impacted at and limited the impact to only 18 G of deceleration. The first bounce was high and the lander continued bouncing for at least 15 additional bounces (accelerometer data recording did not continue through all of the bounces).

The entire entry, descent and landing process was completed in four minutes.

Once the lander stopped rolling, the airbags deflated and retracted toward the lander using four winches mounted on the lander &quot;petals&quot;. Designed to right itself from any initial orientation, the lander happened to roll right side up onto its base petal. Eighty-seven minutes after landing, the petals were deployed with &quot;Sojourner&quot; rover and the solar panels attached on the inside.

The lander arrived at night at 2:56:55 Mars local solar time (16:56:55 UTC) on July 4, 1997. The lander had to wait until sunrise to send its first digital signals and images to Earth. The landing site was located at 19.30° north latitude and 33.52° west longitude in Ares Vallis, only southwest of the center of the wide landing site ellipse. During Sol 1, the first Martian solar day the lander spent on the planet, the lander took pictures and made some meteorological measurements. Once the data was received, the engineers realized that one of the airbags had not fully deflated and could be a problem for the forthcoming traverse of &quot;Sojourner&quot;″s descent ramp. To solve the problem, they sent commands to the lander to raise one of its petals and perform additional retraction to flatten the airbag. The procedure was a success and on Sol 2, &quot;Sojourner&quot; was released, stood up and backed down one of two ramps.

==Rover operations==
===&quot;Sojourner&quot; deployment===
The &quot;Sojourner&quot; rover departed from the lander on Sol 2, after its landing on July 4, 1997. As the next sols progressed it approached some rocks, which the scientists named &quot;Barnacle Bill&quot;, &quot;Yogi&quot;, and &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, after famous cartoon characters. The rover made measurements of the elements found in those rocks and in the martian soil, while the lander took pictures of the &quot;Sojourner&quot; and the surrounding terrain, in addition to making climate observations.

The &quot;Sojourner&quot; is a six-wheeled, long vehicle, wide, tall and weighing . Its maximum speed reached . &quot;Sojourner&quot; travelled approximately in total, never more than from the &quot;Pathfinder&quot; station. During its 83 sols of operation, it sent 550 photographs to Earth and analyzed the chemical properties of 16 locations near the lander. (See also Space exploration rovers)

===&quot;Sojourner&quot;″s rock analysis===

The first analysis on a rock started on Sol 3 with Barnacle Bill. The Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) was used to determine its composition, the spectrometer taking ten hours to make a full scan of the sample. It found all the elements except hydrogen, which constitutes just 0.1 percent of the rock&#x27;s or soil&#x27;s mass.

The APXS works by irradiating rocks and soil samples with alpha particles (helium nuclei, which consist of two protons and two neutrons). The results indicated that &quot;Barnacle Bill&quot; is much like Earth&#x27;s andesites, confirming past volcanic activity. The discovery of andesites shows that some Martian rocks have been remelted and reprocessed. On Earth, andesite forms when magma sits in pockets of rock while some of the iron and magnesium settle out. Consequently, the final rock contains less iron and magnesiums and more silica. Volcanic rocks are usually classified by comparing the relative amount of alkalis (Na2O and K2O) with the amount of silica (SiO2). Andesite is different from the rocks found in meteorites that have come from Mars.

Analysis of the Yogi rock again using the APXS showed that it was a basaltic rock, more primitive than Barnacle Bill. Yogi&#x27;s shape and texture show that it was probably deposited there by a flood.

Another rock, named Moe, was found to have certain marks on its surface, demonstrating erosion caused by the wind. Most rocks analyzed showed a high content of silicon. In another region known as Rock Garden, &quot;Sojourner&quot; encountered crescent moon-shaped dunes, which are similar to crescentic dunes on Earth.

By the time that final results of the mission were described in a series of articles in the journal &quot;Science&quot; (December 5, 1997), it was believed that the rock Yogi contained a coating of dust, but was similar to the rock Barnacle Bill. Calculations suggest that the two rocks contain mostly the minerals orthopyroxene (magnesium-iron silicate), feldspars (aluminum silicates of potassium, sodium, and calcium), and quartz (silicon dioxide), with smaller amounts of magnetite, ilmenite, iron sulfide, and calcium phosphate.
===On-board computer===
The embedded computer on board the &quot;Sojourner&quot; rover was based around the 2 MHz Intel 80C85 CPU with 512 KB of RAM and 176 KB of flash memory solid-state storage, running a cyclic executive.

The computer of the &quot;Pathfinder&quot; lander was a Radiation Hardened IBM Risc 6000 Single Chip (Rad6000 SC) CPU with 128 MB of RAM and 6 MB of EEPROM and its operating system was VxWorks.

The mission was jeopardised by a concurrent software bug in the lander, which had been found in preflight testing but was deemed a glitch and therefore given a low priority as it only occurred in certain unanticipated heavy-load conditions, and the focus was on verifying the entry and landing code. The problem, which was reproduced and corrected from Earth using a laboratory duplicate thanks to the logging and debugging functionality enabled in the flight software, was due to computer resets caused by priority inversion. No scientific or engineering data was lost after a computer reset, but all the following operations were interrupted until the next day. Four resets occurred (on July 5, 10, 11 and 14) during the mission, before patching the software on July 21 to enable priority inheritance.

==Results from &quot;Pathfinder&quot;==

The lander sent more than 2.3 billion bits (287.5 megabytes) of information including 16,500 pictures and made 8.5 million measurements of the atmospheric pressure, temperature and wind speed.

By taking multiple images of the sky at different distances from the Sun, scientists were able to determine that the size of the particles in the pink haze was about one micrometre in radius. The color of some soils was similar to that of an iron oxyhydroxide phase which would support the theory of a warmer and wetter climate in the past. &quot;Pathfinder&quot; carried a series of magnets to examine the magnetic component of the dust. Eventually, all but one of the magnets developed a coating of dust. Since the weakest magnet did not attract any soil, it was concluded that the airborne dust did not contain pure magnetite or just one type of maghemite. The dust probably was an aggregate possibly cemented with ferric oxide (Fe2O3). Using much more sophisticated instruments, Mars &quot;Spirit&quot; rover found that magnetite could explain the magnetic nature of the dust and soil on Mars. Magnetite was found in the soil and the most magnetic part of the soil was dark. Magnetite is very dark.

Using Doppler tracking and two-way ranging, scientists added earlier measurements from the &quot;Viking&quot; landers to determine that the non-hydrostatic component of the polar moment of inertia is due to the Tharsis bulge and that the interior is not melted. The central metallic core is between in radius.

==End of mission==

Although the mission was planned to last from a week to a month, the rover operated successfully for almost three months. Communication failed after October 7, with a final data transmission received from Pathfinder at 10:23 UTC on September 27, 1997. Mission managers tried to restore full communications during the following five months, but the mission was terminated on March 10, 1998. During the extended operation a high-resolution stereo panorama of the surrounding terrain was being made, and the Sojourner rover was to visit a distant ridge, but the panorama was only about one-third completed and the ridge visit had not begun when communication failed.

The on-board battery—designed to operate for one month—may have failed after repeated charging and discharging. The battery was used to heat the probe&#x27;s electronics to slightly above the expected nighttime temperatures on Mars. With the failure of the battery, colder-than-normal temperatures may have caused vital parts to break, leading to loss of communications. The mission had exceeded its goals in the first month.

&quot;Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter&quot; spotted the &quot;Pathfinder&quot; lander in January 2007 (see photo).

==Naming the rover==

The name &quot;Sojourner&quot; was chosen for the &quot;Mars Pathfinder&quot; rover when 12-year old Valerie Ambroise, of Bridgeport, Connecticut, won a year-long, worldwide competition in which students up to 18 years old were invited to select a heroine and submit an essay about her historical accomplishments. The students were asked to address in their essays how a planetary rover named for their heroine would translate these accomplishments to the Martian environment.

Initiated in March 1994 by The Planetary Society of Pasadena, California, in cooperation with NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the contest got under way with an announcement in the January 1995 issue of the National Science Teachers Association&#x27;s magazine &quot;Science and Children&quot;, circulated to 20,000 teachers and schools across the nation.

Ambroise&#x27;s winning essay, which suggested naming the rover for the 19th century women&#x27;s rights activist Sojourner Truth, was selected from among 3,500 essays. First runner-up was Deepti Rohatgi, 18, of Rockville, Maryland, who suggested scientist Marie Curie. Second runner-up was Adam Sheedy, 15, of Round Rock, Texas, who submitted the name of the late astronaut Judith Resnik, who perished in the 1986 Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; explosion. Other popular suggestions included explorer and guide Sacajewea and aviator Amelia Earhart.

<text>MCA Records was an American record label owned by MCA Inc. established in 1972, though MCA had released recordings under that name in the UK from the 1960s. The label achieved success in the 1970s through the 1980s, often by acquiring other record labels, from ABC to Motown to Geffen. MCA Inc. became Universal Studios, Inc., in 1996, and the MCA record label was folded into Universal Music Group&#x27;s Geffen Records in 2003, but Universal&#x27;s MCA Nashville use the moniker.

==History==
===Background===
The U.S. arm of Britain&#x27;s Decca Records was established in New York in 1934 In 1937, the owner of Decca, Edward R. Lewis, chose to split off the UK Decca company from the U.S. company (keeping his U.S. Decca holdings), fearing the financial damage that would arise for UK Companies if the emerging hostilities of Nazi Germany should lead to war – correctly foreseeing World War II. Lewis sold the remainder of his American Decca holdings when war did break out. U.S.-based Decca Records kept the rights to the Decca name in North and South America and parts of Asia including Japan. UK Decca owned the rights to the Decca name in the rest of the world. After the war, British Decca formed a new U.S. subsidiary, London Records. During this time, American Decca issued records outside North America on the Coral Records and Brunswick Records labels.

===The early years===
In 1962, MCA, a talent agency and television production company, entered the recorded music business with the acquisition of American Decca, which became a wholly-owned subsidiary. As American Decca owned Universal Pictures, MCA was forced to exit the talent agency business in order to complete the merger. MCA assumed full ownership of Universal and made it into a top film studio, producing several hits.

In 1966, MCA formed Uni Records and in 1967, purchased Kapp Records which was placed under Uni Records management.

Brunswick and Coral were replaced by the new MCA label, which was used to release U.S. Decca and Kapp label material outside North America. Initial activity as MCA Records was based in London and MCA Records UK was formally launched on February 16, 1968. Among the early artists on the MCA label, around 1971, were groups Wishbone Ash, Osibisa, Stackridge and Budgie, and solo artists Tony Christie, Mick Greenwood and Roy Young.

Early MCA UK releases were distributed by Decca, but moved to EMI in 1974. As the U.S. division of MCA Records was not established until 1972, the earliest UK MCA Records material was released in the U.S. on either Kapp or Decca. MCA UK also issued American Brunswick material on the MCA label until 1972, two years after MCA lost control of Brunswick, after which American Brunswick material was issued in the UK on the revived Brunswick label. Uni label material was issued on the Uni label worldwide.

=== MCA Records formation in Canada and the United States ===
In 1970, MCA reorganized its Canadian record company Compo Company Ltd. into MCA Records (Canada). In April 1970, former Warner Records president Mike Maitland joined MCA and initially served as Decca&#x27;s general manager. Maitland was unsuccessful in his attempt to consolidate Warner Records with co-owned Atlantic Records which led to his departure from Warner.

In April 1971, Maitland supervised the consolidation of the New York–based Decca and Kapp labels plus the California-based Uni label into MCA Records based in Universal City, California, with Maitland serving as president. The three labels maintained their identities for a short time, but were retired in favor of the MCA label in 1973. &quot;Drift Away&quot; by Dobie Gray became the final Decca pop label release in the U.S. in 1973. Beginning the same year, the catalogs of Decca, Uni and Kapp were reissued in the U.S. on the MCA label under the supervision of veteran Decca producer Milt Gabler.

=== Early success ===
The first MCA Records release in the U.S. was former Uni artist Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Crocodile Rock&quot; single in 1972, which appeared on a plain black and white label. Immediately following this, the American MCA label used a black with curved rainbow design until the late 1970s. This design was directly inspired by the U.S. Decca label of the 1960s.

In December 1972, Neil Diamond, another Uni artist, reached superstar status with his first MCA release, the live multi-platinum &quot;Hot August Night&quot;. Elton John&#x27;s double album &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot; was released in October 1973 and was number one on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart for eight straight weeks. The management of former Decca artists the Who had formed their own label Track Records in the UK, but were still under contract with MCA for American distribution. The Who&#x27;s double album &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; was released by Track/MCA also in October 1973. &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; peaked at number 2 as it was held back from the number 1 slot by &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.&quot;

Other successful artists on MCA, after the consolidation, included former Kapp artist Cher, and Uni artist Olivia Newton-John. In 1973 MCA released the highly successful soundtrack album to the film &quot;The Sting&quot;. The movie used the Ragtime music of Scott Joplin, arranged and conducted by Marvin Hamlisch. It won an Academy Award for Best Original Score (MCA issued many other soundtracks to films from Universal, along with some non-Universal films).

One of the most successful MCA artists in this era was the rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd, who would become one of the most popular in the Southern rock genre. The group was discovered by Al Kooper and initially released on his Sounds of the South label imprint of MCA. The song &quot;Free Bird&quot; became one of the most popular songs of all time on album-oriented rock radio stations. On &quot;Second Helping&quot;, the group recorded a song about their relationship with the label called, &quot;Workin&#x27; for MCA&quot;. &quot;Street Survivors&quot; was released in October 1977, just prior to a tragic plane crash in which members of the group were either killed or severely injured. The original &quot;Street Survivors&quot; cover had a picture of the band members surrounded by flames, but this was quickly substituted for a design without flames. Lynyrd Skynyrd&#x27;s streak of hits ended after the crash. Eventually, three Lynyrd Skynyrd albums reached the double platinum sales level and at least two others reached platinum or gold levels.

During the 1970s and 1980s, MCA profited from reissuing classic early rock and roll recordings made by artists who recorded for the numerous labels absorbed by MCA. One notable example was the 1954 Decca recording &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; by Bill Haley &amp; His Comets, which was featured as the lead track of MCA&#x27;s number one–charting &quot;American Graffiti&quot; soundtrack album, and as a single returned to the American top 40 that year, 20 years after it was recorded.

=== Expansion and struggles ===
In 1977, MCA president Sidney Sheinberg set up the Infinity Records division, based in New York City with Ron Alexenberg as CEO. Alexenberg had been with the Epic division of CBS Records, now Sony Music Entertainment. The intention was to give MCA a stronger presence on the East Coast. The only big hit the Infinity label had was &quot;Escape (The Piña Colada Song)&quot; by Rupert Holmes, a number one single at the end of 1979. Infinity also had some success with Hot Chocolate, Spyro Gyra, New England and TKO. But MCA pulled the plug on Infinity after it failed to sell most of the one million advance copies of an album featuring Pope John Paul II in October 1979. Infinity was fully absorbed by the parent company in 1980.

In 1979, Bob Siner replaced Maitland as MCA Records president. Shortly afterwards, MCA acquired ABC Records along with its subsidiaries Paramount, Dunhill, Impulse!, Westminster, and Dot. ABC had acquired the Paramount and Dot labels when they purchased Gulf+Western&#x27;s record labels and Famous Music Corp. Thus, MCA now controlled material once owned by Paramount Pictures, the music released by Paramount&#x27;s record labels, and the pre-1950 films by Paramount as well.

Also included in this deal were recordings controlled by ABC, including albums by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers which were originally released by Shelter Records. Petty was furious about the reassignment of his contract and refused to record for MCA. This led to a series of lawsuits, which resulted in his bankruptcy in 1980. Petty and other ABC/Shelter artists eventually had their contracts transferred to the Backstreet Records label, which was distributed by MCA. ABC Records&#x27; independent distributors sued ABC and MCA for $1.3 million in damages for being stuck with unsold ABC recordings they could not return to MCA. The better selling ABC Records catalog albums were reissued on the MCA label.

MCA distribution in Europe and Asia moved to CBS in 1979, while releases in the 1980s were self-distributed, or through WEA. Distribution moved to BMG during the 1990s.

=== The 1980s ===
The combined effects of the Infinity Records failure, the purchase of ABC, rising vinyl costs and a major slump in record sales produced tremendous losses for the company between 1979 and 1982. It was not until the mid-1980s that the record labels returned to significant profitability. In late 1980, MCA received negative publicity when it attempted to raise the list price of new releases by top selling artists from $8.98 to $9.98 ($ and $ in dollars respectively). This policy, known as &quot;superstar pricing&quot;, ultimately failed. The &quot;Xanadu&quot; soundtrack album and &quot;Gaucho&quot;, by former ABC act Steely Dan, were the first releases with the higher list price. Backstreet artist Tom Petty succeeded in his campaign to force MCA to drop prices back to $8.98 for the release of his album &quot;Hard Promises&quot;, in May 1981.

MCA had a distribution deal with the independent label Unicorn Records, which in turn signed an agreement with another rising independent label, SST Records to manufacture and distribute Black Flag&#x27;s first album &quot;Damaged&quot;. Reportedly, MCA executive Al Bergman heard an advance copy of the album and refused to let MCA Distributing Inc. handle it, stating that it was &quot;an anti-parent record&quot;. The members of Black Flag found themselves covering the MCA Distributing logo on the first 25,000 copies with a sticker reading &quot;As a parent... I found it an anti-parent record.&quot;

SST Records partner Joe Carducci later said that Bergman&#x27;s comments were actually a red herring for MCA to cut ties with Unicorn, which had not produced any successful releases; the fact that MCA would, not soon afterward, directly commission a new recording of &quot;TV Party&quot; from Black Flag and SST Records for the &quot;Repo Man&quot; soundtrack seemed to bear this out. Unicorn would later go out of business after going bankrupt, partially the result of a lawsuit between themselves and Black Flag.

=== Recovery, further expansion and MCA Music Entertainment Group ===
Irving Azoff became the head of MCA Records in 1983. Azoff is known as an experienced music industry veteran who received credit amongst MCA management and staff for saving the company from bankruptcy.

In 1983, rock musician Frank Zappa negotiated a distribution agreement for his Barking Pumpkin label with MCA. As the records were being manufactured, a woman in the quality control department objected to the lyrics of Zappa&#x27;s album &quot;Thing-Fish&quot;. After this MCA cancelled the Zappa contract. At about the same time, Zappa publicly argued with members of the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) over censorship and warning stickers for albums with potentially offensive content. The experience with MCA prompted Zappa to create a satirical &quot;WARNING/GUARANTEE&quot; sticker of his own. &quot;Thing-Fish&quot; was released with Zappa&#x27;s sticker in December 1984 under a new agreement with Capitol/EMI. Despite the conflict with Zappa, MCA later became the biggest label to oppose the PMRC and the use of warning stickers. In October 1985, Azoff said &quot;Never will you find a sticker on one of our records.&quot;

In the 1980s, MCA became commonly nicknamed &quot;Music Cemetery of America&quot; due to a huge surplus of unprofitable records sitting unsold in MCA warehouses. A number of MCA associates, including Azoff and Zappa, disparaged the company in this way.

Starting in 1984, William Knoedelseder wrote a series of articles for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; about the connections between organized crime and MCA. Knoedelseder told the story of mobster Sal Pisello and the corrupt deals he arranged with MCA for the liquidation sales of unsold cut-out recordings that had been deleted from the MCA catalog. The story was later adapted into the book &quot;Stiffed: A True Story of MCA, the Music Business, and the Mafia&quot;, which was published in 1993.

The Chess Records catalog was acquired from the remnants of Sugar Hill Records in 1985. Motown Records was bought in 1988. In the late 1980s, MCA formed Mechanic Records as a sub-label for releasing heavy metal music. Bands signed to Mechanic included Voivod, Dream Theater, Bang Tango, and Trixter.

MCA created a new holding company in 1989 called MCA Music Entertainment Group, headed by Al Teller, former President of United Artists Records, and co-chairman of Turf Classics, a concert production company, run by Producer Richard Flanzer. The same year the MCA Inc. parent company was purchased by the Matsushita group.

Azoff resigned from MCA in 1989 to form his own record label, the now-defunct Giant Records. Richard Palmese was named president of MCA Records after Azoff in 1990.

=== The 1990s ===
GRP Records and Geffen Records were acquired in 1990. Unlike most of MCA&#x27;s previous acquisitions, GRP (which began managing MCA&#x27;s jazz holdings) and Geffen (which became a second mainstream subsidiary) labels kept their identities. MCA sold Motown Records to PolyGram in 1993.

Singer and songwriter Alanis Morissette became a noteworthy MCA artist in Canada with her debut album in 1991. After her second album in 1992 she was dropped following disagreements in artistic direction. However, the company kept her on their song publishing roster, both being owned by Universal Music. Morissette&#x27;s next album, Jagged Little Pill (written and produced independently, but released through Warner Music&#x27;s Maverick Records label) eventually sold more than 30 million copies.

=== Universal Music Group ===
In 1995, drinks conglomerate Seagram Company Ltd. acquired 80% of MCA. In November of that year, Teller was fired and replaced by former Warner Music Group head Doug Morris. Palmese left MCA a week later. Afterwards, Jay Boberg was named as the new president of MCA. On December 9, 1996, the new owners dropped the MCA name; the company became Universal Studios, Inc. and its music division, MCA Music Entertainment Group, was renamed Universal Music Group (UMG), headed by Morris.

In 1997, MCA Records adopted a new logo that featured the parent company&#x27;s former full name, Music Corporation of America. That many younger people had been unaware of what MCA had stood for in the past inspired the new logo. In conjunction with the new logo, the first MCA Records website was launched. In 1998, MCA released the sophomore album Feeling Strangely Fine by Semisonic, which had the number one hit single and video, &quot;Closing Time&quot;, about the use of alcohol in local night clubs and taverns.

On May 21, 1998, Seagram acquired PolyGram (owner of British Decca) from Philips and merged it with Universal Music Group. Unlike several labels under PolyGram and UMG, who faced closure and job cuts of employees, MCA was the only label that was not affected by the merger. When Seagram&#x27;s drinks business was bought by France-based Pernod Ricard, its media holdings (including Universal) were sold to Vivendi which became Vivendi Universal which was later renamed back to Vivendi SA after selling most of the entertainment division (which included Universal Pictures) to General Electric. Morris continued to head the combined company, still called Universal Music Group.

=== MCA label phaseout ===
On January 16, 2003, Jay Boberg resigned from his position as president of MCA Records. Boberg&#x27;s resignation arrived in the wake of slumping sales at MCA, which had seen the label&#x27;s overall album market share decline to just 2.61% in 2002, down from 9% the previous year. His demise was hastened by the relative commercial failure of Shaggy&#x27;s &quot;Lucky Day&quot;, released in October 2002, which MCA hoped would sell well enough to turn around their declining fortunes. Richard Nichols, manager of The Roots, felt that MCA had been attempting to spend lots of money on different projects, and subsequently many acts on MCA were &quot;underfinanced&quot; by the label, leading to poor sales. Rob Hitt of Midtown (who was signed to MCA through Drive-Thru Records) stated that MCA had lost a substantial amount of money that year from investing in several unsuccessful bands.

Management of the label was subsequently handed over to the Interscope Geffen A&amp;M umbrella label and Jimmy Iovine, although UMG chairman Doug Morris promised that MCA would continue to operate as a &quot;full-service, free standing label&quot;. Craig Lambert, previously the vice president of the label, was named as the interim head of MCA, with a successor expected to be chosen within a few months. Following Boberg&#x27;s resignation, it was rumoured that MCA could possibly be merged into Universal Records, something which would have given the latter, New York City–based label a stronger presence in the West Coast of the United States.

On May 20, 2003, insider sources at Universal reporting to &quot;Billboard&quot; revealed that the MCA label was to be absorbed by sister UMG label Geffen Records by the end of the year. The reported reason behind the MCA brand phaseout was due to declining sales, as well as the MCA brand becoming &quot;tarnished&quot; by &quot;a history of acquisitions and mergers&quot;. On June 9, 2003, MCA laid off 75 of their staff, equivalent to a third of their personnel, although no employees from Geffen were let go. Geffen&#x27;s president, Jordan Schur, was named president of the newly merged entity, which continued under the Geffen branding. In the subsequent months, the MCA name was phased out entirely. The last album to be released under the MCA Records branding was Twisted Method&#x27;s &quot;Escape from Cape Coma&quot;, which was released on July 15, 2003.

Today Interscope Capitol Labels Group and Universal Music Enterprises manage MCA&#x27;s rock, pop, and urban back catalogues (including those from ABC Records and Famous Music Group) in conjunction with Geffen – UME and Geffen have re-released various albums from MCA in the years since, as well as several compilations. Its country music label MCA Nashville Records is still in operation, and is one of the only businesses using the MCA trademark as of 2016 along with MCA Records France (imprint of Universal Music France). MCA&#x27;s jazz catalogue is managed by Verve Records (through the Impulse! and GRP imprints, depending on whether the recording was acquired from ABC or not), while its classical music catalogue is managed by Deutsche Grammophon. MCA&#x27;s musical theatre catalogue is managed by Decca Records on its Decca Broadway imprint.

<text>Dame Cecily Isabel Fairfield (21 December 1892 – 15 March 1983), known as Rebecca West, or Dame Rebecca West, was a British author, journalist, literary critic and travel writer. An author who wrote in many genres, West reviewed books for &quot;The Times&quot;, the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; and &quot;The New Republic&quot;, and she was a correspondent for &quot;The Bookman&quot;. 

Her major works include &quot;Black Lamb and Grey Falcon&quot; (1941), on the history and culture of Yugoslavia; &quot;A Train of Powder&quot; (1955), her coverage of the Nuremberg trials, published originally in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;; &quot;The Meaning of Treason&quot; (first published as a magazine article in 1945 and then expanded to the book in 1947), later &quot;The New Meaning of Treason&quot; (1964), a study of the trial of American-born fascist William Joyce and others; &quot;The Return of the Soldier&quot; (1918), a modernist World War I novel; and the &quot;Aubrey trilogy&quot; of autobiographical novels, &quot;The Fountain Overflows&quot; (1956), &quot;This Real Night&quot; (published posthumously in 1984), and &quot;Cousin Rosamund&quot; (1985). 

&quot;Time&quot; called her &quot;indisputably the world&#x27;s number one woman writer&quot; in 1947. She was made CBE in 1949, and DBE in 1959; in each case, the citation reads: &quot;writer and literary critic&quot;. She took the pseudonym &quot;Rebecca West&quot; from the rebellious young heroine in &quot;Rosmersholm&quot; by Henrik Ibsen. She was a recipient of the Benson Medal.

==Biography==

Rebecca West was born Cecily Isabel Fairfield in 1892 in London, England, and grew up in a home full of intellectual stimulation, political debate, lively company, books and music. Her mother, Isabella, a Scotswoman, was an accomplished pianist but did not pursue a musical career after her marriage to Charles Fairfield. The Anglo-Irish Charles had been a Confederate stretcher-bearer at the siege of Richmond in the US Civil War, and had returned to the UK to become a journalist of considerable reputation but financial incompetence. He deserted his family when Cecily was eight years old. He never rejoined them, and died impoverished and alone in a boarding house in Liverpool in 1906, when Cecily was 14. The rest of the family moved to Edinburgh, Scotland, where Cecily was educated at George Watson&#x27;s Ladies College. She had to leave school in 1907 due to a bout of tuberculosis. She chose not to return after recovering from the illness, later describing her schooling at Watson&#x27;s as akin to a &quot;prison&quot;.

West had two older sisters. Letitia (&quot;Lettie&quot;), who was the best educated of the three, became one of the first fully qualified female doctors in Britain, as well as a barrister at the Inns of Court. Winifred (&quot;Winnie&quot;), the middle sister, married Norman Macleod, Principal Assistant Secretary in the Admiralty, and eventually director general of Greenwich Hospital. Winnie&#x27;s two children, Alison and Norman, became closely involved in Rebecca&#x27;s life as she got older; Alison Macleod would achieve a literary career of her own. West trained as an actress in London, taking the name &quot;Rebecca West&quot; from the rebellious young heroine in &quot;Rosmersholm&quot; by Henrik Ibsen. She and Lettie became involved in the women&#x27;s suffrage movement, participating in street protests. Meanwhile, West worked as a journalist for the feminist weekly &quot;Freewoman&quot; and the &quot;Clarion&quot;, drumming up support for the suffragette cause.

===Affairs and motherhood===
In September 1912, West accused the famously libertine writer H. G. Wells of being &quot;the Old Maid among novelists.&quot; This was part of a provocative review of his novel &quot;Marriage&quot; published in &quot;Freewoman&quot;, an obscure and short-lived feminist weekly review. The review attracted Wells&#x27;s interest and an invitation to lunch at his home. The two writers became lovers in late 1913, despite Wells being both married and twenty-six years older than West. Their 10-year relationship produced a son, Anthony West, born on 4 August 1914. Wells was behind her move to Marine Parade, Leigh-on-Sea in Essex, where she lived between 1917 and 1919. Their friendship lasted until Wells&#x27;s death in 1946.

West is also said to have had relationships with Charlie Chaplin, newspaper magnate Lord Beaverbrook, and journalist John Gunther.

===Early career and marriage===
West established her reputation as a spokeswoman for feminist and socialist causes and as a critic, turning out essays and reviews for &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, &quot;New York American&quot;, &quot;New Statesman&quot;, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, and many more newspapers and magazines. George Bernard Shaw said in 1916 that &quot;Rebecca West could handle a pen as brilliantly as ever I could and much more savagely.&quot; During the 1920s, West began a lifelong habit of visits to the United States to give lectures, meet artists, and get involved in the political scene. She was a great friend of the novelist G. B. Stern, and Stern and Clemence Dane stayed with her in America in 1924. There, she befriended CIA founder Allen Dulles, Charlie Chaplin, Harold Ross of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, and historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr., among many other significant figures of the day. Her lifelong fascination with the United States culminated in 1948 when President Truman presented her with the Women&#x27;s Press Club Award for Journalism, calling her &quot;the world&#x27;s best reporter.&quot;

In 1930, at the age of 37, she married a banker, Henry Maxwell Andrews, and they remained nominally together, despite one public affair just before his death in 1968. West&#x27;s writing brought her considerable wealth, and, by 1940, she owned a Rolls-Royce and a grand country estate, Ibstone House, in the Chiltern Hills of southern England. During World War II, West housed Yugoslav refugees in the spare rooms of her blacked-out manor, and she used the grounds as a small dairy farm and vegetable plot, agricultural pursuits that continued long after the war had ended.

===Later life===

As West grew older, she turned to broader political and social issues, including mankind&#x27;s propensity to inflict violent injustice on itself. Before and during World War II, West travelled widely, collecting material for books on travel and politics. In 1936–38, she made three trips to Yugoslavia, a country she came to love, seeing it as the nexus of European history since the late Middle Ages. Her non-fiction masterpiece, &quot;Black Lamb and Grey Falcon&quot; is an amalgamation of her impressions from these trips. &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer Katherine Woods wrote: &quot;In two almost incredibly full-packed volumes one of the most gifted and searching of modern English novelists and critics has produced not only the magnification and intensification of the travel book form, but, one may say, its apotheosis.&quot;

West was assigned by Ross&#x27; magazine to cover the Nuremberg trials for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, an experience she memorialized in the book &quot;A Train of Powder&quot;. In 1950, she was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She also went to South Africa in 1960 to report on apartheid in a series of articles for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, particularly regarding a prominent trial for a seditious uprising aiming to establish Communist rule.

She accidentally misidentified a South African judge for some questions put by another judge and was sued for libel along with the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; whose editor, Harry Hodson, failed to support West. She wrote &quot;My problem is complicated by the fact that the defence, the people who would naturally be against the Judge and for me, are mostly Communist and won&#x27;t lift a finger for me. It worries me a lot. It&#x27;s so hard to work with this hanging over me.&quot; She felt her only support was her friends, the anti-apartheid politician Bernard Friedman and his wife, with whom she stayed in Johannesburg. &quot;I will get over this case. But it isn&#x27;t easy to feel that some people are for no reason that you know of possessed by an intention to ruin you; and I also felt I was letting you down in South Africa. I have been deeply grateful for all the kindness and sympathy you have shown me and I thought of Tall Trees as a warm place in a chilly world.&quot;

She travelled extensively well into old age. In 1966 and 1969, she undertook two long journeys to Mexico, becoming fascinated by the indigenous culture of the country and its mestizo population. She stayed with actor Romney Brent in Mexico City and with Katherine (Kit) Wright, a long-time friend, in Cuernavaca.

===Old age===

Her husband became both sleepy and inattentive as he got older. The sleepiness led to a car accident where no one was hurt but Henry was charged with dangerous driving. He became obsessed with the Norwegian ballerina Gerd Larsen; he would refuse to travel with West, instead preferring to return to London to be with Larsen. West initially considered this to be purely her husband&#x27;s infatuation, but came to think that Larsen was driven by money. At her husband&#x27;s funeral West had the upsetting problem of Larsen&#x27;s request to be among the mourners, even though she had only known him for 18 months. Henry&#x27;s will left £5,000 for Larsen. After her husband&#x27;s death in 1968, West discovered that he had been unfaithful with other women.

After she was widowed, she moved to London, where she bought a spacious apartment overlooking Hyde Park. Unfortunately, it was next door to the Iranian embassy. During the May 1980 incident, West, then 87, had to be evacuated. In the last two decades of her life, West kept up a very active social life, making friends with Martha Gellhorn, Doris Lessing, Bernard Levin, comedian Frankie Howerd, and film star and director Warren Beatty, who filmed her for the production &quot;Reds&quot;, a biography of journalist John Reed and his connection with the Russian Revolution. She also spent time with scholars such as Jane Marcus and Bonnie Kime Scott, who began to chronicle her feminist career and varied work. She wrote at an unabated pace, penning masterful reviews for &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;, publishing her last novel &quot;The Birds Fall Down&quot; (1966), and overseeing the film version of the story by BBC in 1978. The last work published in her lifetime was &quot;1900&quot; (1982). &quot;1900&quot; explored the last year of Queen Victoria&#x27;s long reign, which was a watershed in many cultural and political respects.

At the same time, West worked on sequels to her autobiographically inspired novel &quot;The Fountain Overflows&quot; (1957); although she had written the equivalent of two more novels for the planned trilogy, she was never satisfied with the sequels and did not publish them. She also tinkered at great length with an autobiography, without coming to closure, and started scores of stories without finishing them. Much of her work from the late phase of her life was published posthumously, including &quot;Family Memories&quot; (1987), &quot;This Real Night&quot; (1984), &quot;Cousin Rosamund&quot; (1985), &quot;The Only Poet&quot; (1992), and &quot;Survivors in Mexico&quot; (2003). Unfinished works from her early period, notably &quot;Sunflower&quot; (1986) and &quot;The Sentinel&quot; (2001) were also published after her death, so that her &quot;oeuvre&quot; was augmented by about one third by posthumous publications.

===Relationship with her son===

West&#x27;s relationship with her son, Anthony West, was not a happy one. The rancour between them came to a head when Anthony, himself a gifted writer, his father&#x27;s biographer (&quot;H. G. Wells: Aspects of a Life&quot; [1984]), and a novelist, published &quot;Heritage&quot; (1955), a fictionalised autobiography. West never forgave her son for depicting in &quot;Heritage&quot; the relationship between an illegitimate son and his two world-famous, unmarried parents, and for portraying the mother in unflattering terms. The depiction of West&#x27;s alter ego in &quot;Heritage&quot; as a deceitful, unloving actress (West had trained as an actress in her youth) and poor caregiver so wounded West that she broke off relations with her son and threatened to sue any publisher who would bring out &quot;Heritage&quot; in England. She suppressed an English edition of the novel, which was only published there after her death, in 1984. Although there were temporary rapprochements between her and Anthony, a state of alienation persisted between them, causing West grief until her dying hour. She fretted about her son&#x27;s absence from her deathbed, but when asked whether he should be sent for, answered: &quot;perhaps not, if he hates me so much.&quot;

===Death===

West suffered from failing eyesight and high blood pressure in the late 1970s, and became increasingly frail. Her last months were mostly spent in bed, at times delirious and other times lucid; she complained that she was dying too slowly. She died on 15 March 1983, and is buried at Brookwood Cemetery, Woking.

Upon hearing of her death, William Shawn, then editor in chief of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, said:
She is honoured with a blue plaque at Hope Park Square, Edinburgh, her childhood home which also provided the setting for her novel &quot;The Judge&quot;.

==Politics==

West grew up in a home filled with discussions of world affairs. Her father was a journalist who often involved himself in controversial issues. He brought home Russian revolutionaries and other political activists, and their debates helped to form West&#x27;s sensibility, which took shape in novels such as &quot;The Birds Fall Down&quot;, set in pre-revolution Russia. But the crucial event that moulded West&#x27;s politics was the Dreyfus affair. The impressionable Rebecca learned early on just how powerful was the will to persecute minorities and to subject individuals to unreasonable suspicion based on flimsy evidence and mass frenzy. West had a keen understanding of the psychology of politics, how movements and causes could sustain themselves on the profound need to believe or disbelieve in a core of values—even in contradiction of reality.

Although she was a militant feminist and active suffragette, and published a perceptive and admiring profile of Emmeline Pankhurst, West also criticised the tactics of Pankhurst&#x27;s daughter, Christabel, and the sometimes doctrinaire aspects of the Pankhursts&#x27; Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union (WSPU).

The first major test of West&#x27;s political outlook was the Bolshevik Revolution. Many on the left saw it as the beginning of a new, better world, and the end of the crimes of capitalism. West regarded herself as a member of the left, having attended Fabian socialist summer schools as a girl. Yet to West, both the Revolution and the revolutionaries were suspect. Even before the Bolsheviks took power in October 1917, West expressed her doubts that events in Russia could serve as a model for socialists in Britain or anywhere else.

West paid a heavy price for her cool reaction to the Russian Revolution; her positions increasingly isolated her. When Emma Goldman visited Britain in 1924 after seeing Bolshevik violence firsthand, West was exasperated that British intellectuals ignored Goldman&#x27;s testimony and her warning against Bolshevik tyranny.

For all her censures of communism, however, West was hardly an uncritical supporter of Western democracies. Thus in 1919–1920, she excoriated the US government for deporting Goldman and for the infamous Palmer Raids. She was also appalled at the failure of Western democracies to come to the aid of Republican Spain, and she gave money to the Republican cause.

A staunch anti-fascist, West attacked both the Conservative governments of her own country for appeasing Adolf Hitler and her colleagues on the left for their pacifism. Neither side, in her view, understood the evil Nazism posed. Unlike many on the left, she also distrusted Joseph Stalin. To West, Stalin had a criminal mentality that communism facilitated. She was outraged when the Allies switched their loyalties as to Yugoslav resistance movements by deciding in 1943 to start backing the Communist-led Partisans led by Tito in Yugoslavia, thus abandoning their support of Draža Mihailović&#x27;s Chetniks, whom she considered the legitimate Yugoslav resistance. She expressed her feelings and opinions on the Allies&#x27; switch in Yugoslavia by writing the satirical short story titled &quot;Madame Sara&#x27;s Magic Crystal&quot;, but decided not to publish it upon discussion with Orme Sargent, Assistant Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign Office. Writing in her diary, West mentioned that Sargent had persuaded her that &quot;the recognition of Tito was made by reason of British military necessities, and for no other reason.&quot; Following Sargent&#x27;s claim, she described her decision not to publish the story as an expression of &quot;personal willingness to sacrifice myself to the needs of my country.&quot; After the war, West&#x27;s anti-Communism hardened as she saw Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and other Eastern and Central European states succumb to Soviet domination.

In 1951 she provided a critical review of Alistair Cooke&#x27;s sympathetic portrait of Alger Hiss during his postwar trials from a classical liberalism point of view. It is not surprising in this context that West reacted to US Senator Joseph McCarthy differently from her colleagues. They saw a demagogue terrorising liberals and leftists with baseless accusations of Communist conspiracy. West saw an oaf blundering into the minefield of Communist subversion. For her, McCarthy was right to pursue Communists with fervour, even if his methods were roughshod, though her mild reaction to McCarthy provoked powerful revulsion among those on the left and dismay even among anti-Communist liberals. She refused, however, to amend her views.

Although West&#x27;s anti-communism earned the high regard of conservatives, she never considered herself one of them. In postwar Britain, West voted Labour and welcomed the Labour landslide of 1945 but spoke out against domination of the Labour Party by British trade unions, and thought left-wing politicians such as Michael Foot unimpressive. She had mixed feelings about the Callaghan government. West admired Margaret Thatcher, not for Thatcher&#x27;s policies, but for Thatcher&#x27;s achievement in rising to the top of a male-dominated sphere.

In the end, West&#x27;s anti-communism remained the centrepiece of her politics because she so consistently challenged the communists as legitimate foes of the status quo in capitalist countries. In West&#x27;s view, communism, like fascism, was merely a form of authoritarianism. Communists were under party discipline, and therefore could never speak for themselves; West was a supreme example of an intellectual who spoke for herself, no matter how her comments might injure her. Indeed, few writers explicitly acknowledged how much West&#x27;s embrace of unpopular positions hurt her on the left. A whole generation of writers abandoned West and refused to read her, as Doris Lessing suggested.

==Religion==

West&#x27;s parents had her baptised into the Church of England two months after birth and she considered herself a Christian, though an unconventional believer. At times, she found God to be wicked; at other times she considered him merely ineffectual and defeated. However, she revered Christ as the quintessentially good man, she had great respect for the literary, pictorial, and architectural manifestations of the Christian ethos, and she considered faith a valid tool to grapple with the conundrums of life and the mysteries of the cosmos. Although her writings are full of references to the Bible and ecclesiastical history, she was essentially anti-doctrinaire and occasionally blasphemous. In 1926 she expressed the unorthodox belief that &quot;Christianity must be regarded not as a final revelation but as a phase of revelation.&quot; Moreover, she rejected specific articles of belief such as the virgin birth, Original sin, the Atonement, and Providence. Her contribution to Virginia Woolf&#x27;s Hogarth Letters Series, &quot;Letter to a Grandfather&quot; (1933), is a declaration of &quot;my faith, which seems to some unfaith&quot; disguised as philosophical fiction. Written in the midst of the Great Depression, &quot;Letter to a Grandfather&quot; traces the progressive degeneration of the notion of Providence through the ages, concluding skeptically that &quot;the redemptive power of divine grace no longer seemed credible, nor very respectable in the arbitrary performance that was claimed for it.&quot; As for the Atonement, &quot;Black Lamb and Grey Falcon&quot; is in part meant as a refutation of that very doctrine, which she saw as having sparked a fatal obsession with sacrifice throughout the Christian era and, specifically, as having prompted Neville Chamberlain to formulate his policy of appeasement, which she vehemently opposed. She wrote:

World War II shocked her into a more conventional belief: &quot;I believe if people are looking for the truth, the truth of the Christian religion will come out and meet them.&quot; In the early 1950s, she thought she had a mystical revelation in France and actively tried to convert to Catholicism. There was a precedent in her family for this action, as her sister, Letitia, had earlier converted to Catholicism, thereby causing quite a stir, but West&#x27;s attempt was short-lived, and she confessed to a friend: &quot;I could not go on with being a Catholic ... I don&#x27;t want, I can&#x27;t bear to, become a Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh, and I cannot believe that I am required to pay such a price for salvation.&quot; Her writings of the 1960s and early 1970s again betray a profound mistrust towards God: &quot;The case against religion is the responsibility of God for the sufferings of mankind, which makes it impossible to believe the good things said about Him in the Bible, and consequently to believe anything it says about Him.&quot;

Alongside her fluctuating Christianity, West was fascinated with Manichaeanism. She describes the Manichean idea that the world is a mixture of two primeval kingdoms, one of light the other of darkness, as an &quot;extremely useful conception of life&quot; affirming that a &quot;fusion of light and darkness&quot; is &quot;the essential human character.&quot; On the other hand, West criticised &quot;the strictly literal mind of the founder [of Manichaeanism] and his followers&quot; and what she perceived as the meanness of Christian heretics who adopted Manichaean ideas. West states that &quot;the whole of modern history could be deduced from the popularity of this heresy in Western Europe: its inner sourness, its preference for hate over love and for war over peace, its courage about dying, its cowardice about living.&quot; Regarding the suppression of Manichaean heresies by the Christian authorities West says that whilst &quot;it is our tendency to sympathise with the hunted hare... much that we read of Western European heretics makes us suspect that here the quarry was less of a hare than a priggish skunk.&quot; Nonetheless, Manichean influence persists in an unpublished draft of West&#x27;s own memoirs where she writes: &quot;I had almost no possibility of holding faith of any religious kind except a belief in a wholly and finally defeated God, a hypothesis which I now accept but tried for a long time to reject, I could not face it.&quot;

West&#x27;s interest in Manichaeanism reflects her lifelong struggle with the question of how to deal with dualisms. At times she appears to favour the merging of opposites, for which Byzantium served as a model: &quot;church and state, love and violence, life and death, were to be fused again as in Byzantium.&quot; More dominant, however, was her tendency to view the tensions generated in the space between dualistic terms as life-sustaining and creative; hence, her aversion to homosexuality and her warning not to confuse the drive for feminist emancipation with the woman&#x27;s desire to become like a man. Her insistence on the fundamental difference between men and women reveals her essentialism, but it also bespeaks her innate Manichaean sensibility. She wanted respect and equal rights for women, but at the same time she required that women retain their specifically feminine qualities, notably an affinity with life: &quot;Men have a disposition to violence; women have not. If one says that men are on the side of death, women on the side of life, one seems to be making an accusation against men. One is not doing that.&quot; One reason why she does not want to make an accusation against men is that they are simply playing their assigned role in a flawed universe. Only love can alleviate destructive aspects of the sex-antagonism: &quot;I loathe the way the two cancers of sadism and masochism eat into the sexual life of humanity, so that the one lifts the lash and the other offers blood to the blow, and both are drunken with the beastly pleasure of misery and do not proceed with love&#x27;s business of building a shelter from the cruelty of the universe.&quot; In addition to the operations of love, female emancipation is crucial to removing the moral, professional, and social stigma associated with the notion of the &quot;weaker sex,&quot; without trying to do away altogether with the temperamental and metaphysical aspects of the gender dualism itself. Thus, the &quot;sex war&quot; described in West&#x27;s early short story &quot;Indissoluble Matrimony&quot; (1914) elevates the female character, Evadne, in the end because she accepts the terms of the contest without superficially trying to &quot;win&quot; that war.

The task of reconciling dualisms can also be seen in West&#x27;s political propensities. As Bernard Schweizer has argued: &quot;St. Augustine and Schopenhauer emphasized the fallenness of human life, implying a quietistic stance that could be confused with conservatism, while the Reclus brothers [famous French anarchists] urged her to revolt against such pessimistic determinism. West&#x27;s characteristically heroic personal and historic vision is a result of these two contending forces.&quot; West&#x27;s conviction that humanity will only fulfill its highest potentials if it adheres to the principle of process reflects the same preoccupation: &quot;Process is her most encompassing doctrine,&quot; states Peter Wolfe. &quot;Reconciling her dualism, it captures the best aspects of the male and female principles.&quot;

==Cultural references==

Long time book reviewer and senior editor at &quot;Time&quot;, Whittaker Chambers, considered West &quot;a novelist of note ... a distinguished literary critic ... above all ... one of the greatest of living journalists.&quot;

Virginia Woolf questioned Rebecca West being labelled as an &quot;arrant feminist&quot; because she offended men by saying they are snobs in chapter two of &quot;A Room of One&#x27;s Own&quot;: was Miss West an arrant feminist for making a possibly true if uncomplimentary statement about the other sex?&quot;

Bill Moyers&#x27;s interview &quot;A Visit With Dame Rebecca West,&quot; recorded in her London home when she was 89, was aired by PBS in July 1981. In a review of the interview, John O&#x27;Connor wrote that &quot;Dame Rebecca emerges as a formidable presence. When she finds something or somebody the adjective suddenly becomes withering.&quot;

West&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Return of the Soldier&quot;, was turned into a major motion picture in 1982, directed by Alan Bridges, starring Alan Bates, Glenda Jackson, and Julie Christie. More recently, an adaptation of &quot;The Return of the Soldier&quot; for the stage by Kelly Younger titled &quot;Once a Marine&quot; took West&#x27;s theme of shell-shock-induced amnesia and applied it to a soldier returning from the war in Iraq with PTSD.

There have been two plays about Rebecca West produced since 2004. &quot;That Woman: Rebecca West Remembers&quot;, by Carl Rollyson, Helen Macleod, and Anne Bobby, is a one-woman monologue in which an actress playing Rebecca West recounts her life through some of her most famous articles, letters, and books. &quot;Tosca&#x27;s Kiss&quot;, a 2006 play by Kenneth Jupp, retells West&#x27;s experience covering the Nuremberg trials for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

Robert D. Kaplan&#x27;s influential book &quot;Balkan Ghosts&quot; (1994) is an homage to West&#x27;s &quot;Black Lamb and Grey Falcon&quot; (1941), which he calls &quot;this century&#x27;s greatest travel book.&quot;

In February 2006, BBC broadcast a radio version of West&#x27;s novel &quot;The Fountain Overflows&quot;, dramatized by Robin Brook, in six 55-minute installments.

An additional story from the collection, &quot;There is No Conversation&quot;, is the tale of a romance as told in hindsight by both parties, one a caddish Frenchman and the other a coarse American woman. This story was adapted for an hour-long radio drama in 1950 on &quot;NBC University Theatre&quot; and featured a commentary on West&#x27;s story and writing skills by Katherine Anne Porter.
* 1936 – &quot;The Thinking Reed&quot;, a novel about the corrupting influence of wealth even on originally decent people. Perhaps a disguised self-critique of her own elegant lifestyle.
* 1956 – &quot;The Fountain Overflows&quot;, a semi-autobiographical novel weaving a cultural, historical, and psychological tapestry of the first decade of the 20th century, reflected through the prism of the gifted, eccentric Aubrey family.
* 1966 – &quot;The Birds Fall Down&quot;, spy thriller based on the deeds of the historical double agent Yevno Azef.
* 1984 – &quot;This Real Night&quot;, sequel to &quot;The Fountain Overflows&quot; published posthumously
* 1985 – &quot;Cousin Rosamund&quot;, final, unfinished installment of the &quot;Aubrey Trilogy&quot; published posthumously
* 1986 – &quot;Sunflower&quot;, published posthumously, about a tense love-relationship between an actress and a politician, reminiscent of West&#x27;s relationship with H. G. Wells.
* 2002 – &quot;The Sentinel&quot;, edited by Kathryn Laing and published posthumously, West&#x27;s very first extended piece of fiction, an unfinished novel about the suffragist struggle in Britain, including grim scenes of female incarceration and force-feeding.

<text>Andrew Michael Sullivan (born 10 August 1963) is a British-American political commentator. Sullivan is a former editor of &quot;The New Republic&quot;, and the author or editor of six books. He started a political blog, &quot;The Daily Dish&quot;, in 2000, and eventually moved his blog to platforms, including &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;, and finally an independent subscription-based format. He retired from blogging in 2015. From 2016 to 2020, Sullivan was a writer-at-large at &quot;New York&quot;. He launched his newsletter &quot;The Weekly Dish&quot; in July 2020.

Sullivan has said that his conservatism is rooted in his Catholic background and in the ideas of the British political philosopher Michael Oakeshott. In 2003, he wrote that he could no longer support the American conservative movement, as he was disaffected with the Republican Party&#x27;s continued rightward shift toward social conservatism during the George W. Bush era.

Born and raised in Britain, Sullivan has lived in the U.S. since 1984. He is openly gay and a practicing Catholic.

==Early life and education==
Sullivan was born in South Godstone, Surrey, England, into a Catholic family of Irish descent, and was brought up in the nearby town of East Grinstead, West Sussex. He was educated at a Catholic primary school and at Reigate Grammar School, where his classmates included Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Keir Starmer and Conservative member of the House of Lords Andrew Cooper. He won a scholarship in 1981 to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he was awarded a first-class Bachelor of Arts in modern history and modern languages. He founded the Pooh Stick Society at Oxford and in his second year was elected president of the Oxford Union for Trinity term 1983.

After writing briefly for a newspaper, Sullivan won a scholarship in 1984 to Harvard University, where he earned a Master in Public Administration in 1986 from the John F. Kennedy School of Government and a Ph.D. in government in 1990. His dissertation was titled &quot;Intimations Pursued: The Voice of Practice in the Conversation of Michael Oakeshott&quot;.

==Career==
Sullivan first wrote for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; on American politics. In 1986, he went to work for &quot;The New Republic&quot; magazine initially on a summer internship; among the most significant articles he wrote were &quot;Gay Life Gay Death&quot;, an essay on the AIDS crisis, and &quot;Sleeping with the Enemy&quot;, in which he attacked the practice of &quot;outing&quot;, both of which earned him recognition in the gay community. He was appointed the editor of &quot;The New Republic&quot; in October 1991, a position he held until 1996. In that position, he expanded the magazine from its traditional roots in political coverage to cultural issues and the politics surrounding them. During this time, the magazine generated several high-profile controversies.

While completing graduate work at Harvard in 1988, Sullivan published an attack in &quot;Spy&quot; magazine on Rhodes Scholars, &quot;All Rhodes Lead Nowhere in Particular&quot;, which dismissed them as &quot;hustling apple-polisher[s]&quot;; &quot;high-profile losers&quot;; &quot;the very best of the second-rate&quot;; and &quot;misfits by the very virtue of their bland, eugenic perfection.&quot; &quot;[T]he sad truth is that as a rule,&quot; Sullivan wrote, &quot;Rhodies possess none of the charms of the aristocracy and all of the debilities: fecklessness, excessive concern that peasants be aware of their achievement, and a certain hemophilia of character.&quot; Author Thomas Schaeper notes that &quot;[i]ronically, Sullivan had first gone to the United States on a Harkness Fellowship, one of many scholarships spawned in emulation of the Rhodes program.&quot;

In 1994, Sullivan published excerpts on race and intelligence from Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray&#x27;s controversial &quot;The Bell Curve&quot;, which argued that some of the measured difference in IQ scores among racially defined groups was a result of genetic inheritance. Almost the entire editorial staff of the magazine threatened to resign if material that they considered racist was published. To appease them, Sullivan included lengthy rebuttals from 19 writers and contributors. He has continued to speak approvingly of the research and arguments presented in &quot;The Bell Curve&quot;, writing, &quot;The book ... still holds up as one of the most insightful and careful of the last decade. The fact of human inequality and the subtle and complex differences between various manifestations of being human—gay, straight, male, female, black, Asian—is a subject worth exploring, period.&quot; According to Sullivan, this incident was a turning point in his relationship with the magazine&#x27;s staff and management, which he conceded was already bad because he &quot;was a lousy manager of people.&quot; He left the magazine in 1996.

Sullivan began writing for &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; in 1998, but editor Adam Moss fired him in 2002. Jack Shafer wrote in &quot;Slate&quot; magazine that he had asked Moss in an email to explain this decision, but that his emails went unanswered, adding that Sullivan was not fully forthcoming on the subject. Sullivan wrote on his blog that the decision had been made by &quot;Times&quot; executive editor Howell Raines, who found Sullivan&#x27;s presence &quot;uncomfortable&quot;, but defended Raines&#x27;s right to fire him. Sullivan suggested that Raines did so in response to Sullivan&#x27;s criticism of the &quot;Times&quot; on his blog, and said he had expected that his criticisms would anger Raines.

Sullivan has also worked as a columnist for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; of London.

Ross Douthat and Tyler Cowen have suggested that Sullivan is the most influential political writer of his generation, particularly because of his very early and strident support for same-sex marriage, his early political blog, his support of the Iraq War, and his support of Barack Obama&#x27;s presidential candidacy.

After the cessation of his long-running blog, &quot;The Dish&quot;, in 2015, Sullivan wrote regularly for &quot;New York&quot; during the 2016 presidential election, and in 2017 began writing a weekly column, &quot;Interesting Times&quot;, for the magazine. 

On July 19, 2020, after the unexplained absence of his column for June 5, Sullivan announced that he would no longer write for &quot;New York&quot; and would be reviving &quot;The Dish&quot; as a newsletter, &quot;The Weekly Dish&quot;, hosted by Substack.

==Politics==
Sullivan describes himself as a conservative and is the author of &quot;The Conservative Soul&quot;. He has supported a number of traditional libertarian positions, favouring limited government and opposing social interventionist measures such as affirmative action. But on many controversial public issues, including same-sex marriage, social security, progressive taxation, anti-discrimination laws, the Affordable Care Act, the U.S. government&#x27;s use of torture, and capital punishment, he has taken positions not typically shared by conservatives in the United States. In 2012, Sullivan said, &quot;the catastrophe of the Bush–Cheney years ... all but exploded the logic of neoconservatism and its domestic partner-in-crime, supply-side economics.&quot;

One of the most important intellectual and political influences on Sullivan is Michael Oakeshott. Sullivan describes Oakeshott&#x27;s thought as &quot;an anti-ideology, a nonprogramme, a way of looking at the world whose most perfect expression might be called inactivism.&quot; He argues &quot;that Oakeshott requires us to systematically discard programmes and ideologies and view each new situation &quot;sui generis&quot;. Change should only ever be incremental and evolutionary. Oakeshott viewed society as resembling language: it is learned gradually and without us really realising it, and it evolves unconsciously, and for ever.&quot; In 1984, he wrote that Oakeshott offered &quot;a conservatism which ends by affirming a radical liberalism.&quot; This &quot;anti-ideology&quot; is perhaps the source of accusations that Sullivan &quot;flip-flops&quot; or changes his opinions to suit the whims of the moment. He has written, &quot;A true conservative—who is, above all, an anti-ideologue—will often be attacked for alleged inconsistency, for changing positions, for promising change but not a radical break with the past, for pursuing two objectives—like liberty and authority, or change and continuity—that seem to all ideologues as completely contradictory.&quot;

As a youth, Sullivan was a fervent supporter of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. He says of that time, &quot;What really made me a right-winger was seeing the left use the state to impose egalitarianism—on my school&quot;, after the Labour government in Britain tried to merge his admissions-selective school with the local comprehensive school. At Oxford, he became friends with prominent conservatives William Hague and Niall Ferguson and became involved with Conservative Party politics.

From 1980 through 2000, Sullivan supported Republican presidential candidates in the U.S., with the exception of the 1992 election, when he supported Bill Clinton. In 2004, he was angered by George W. Bush&#x27;s support of the Federal Marriage Amendment designed to enshrine in the Constitution marriage as a union between a man and a woman, as well as what he saw as the Bush administration&#x27;s incompetent management of the Iraq War, and supported Democratic nominee John Kerry.

Sullivan endorsed Senator Barack Obama for the Democratic nomination in the 2008 United States presidential election, and Representative Ron Paul for the Republican nomination. After John McCain clinched the Republican primary and named Sarah Palin as his running mate, Sullivan began to espouse a birther-like conspiracy theory involving Palin and her young son Trig. Sullivan devoted a significant amount of space in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; to questioning whether Palin is Trig&#x27;s biological mother. He and others who held this belief, dubbed &quot;Trig Truthers&quot;, demanded Palin produce a birth certificate or other piece of medical evidence to prove Trig is indeed Palin&#x27;s biological son.

Sullivan eventually endorsed Obama for president, largely because he believed Obama would restore &quot;the rule of law and Constitutional balance&quot;; he also argued that Obama represented a more realistic prospect for &quot;bringing America back to fiscal reason&quot; and expressed hope that Obama could &quot;get us past the culture war.&quot; Sullivan continued to maintain that Obama was the best choice for president from a conservative point of view. During the 2012 election campaign, he wrote, &quot;Against a radical right, reckless, populist insurgency, Obama is the conservative option, dealing with emergent problems with pragmatic calm and modest innovation. He seeks as a good Oakeshottian would to reform the country&#x27;s policies in order to regain the country&#x27;s past virtues. What could possibly be more conservative than that?&quot;
Sullivan has declared support for Arnold Schwarzenegger and other like-minded Republicans. He argues that the Republican Party, and much of the conservative movement in the U.S., has largely abandoned its earlier scepticism and moderation in favour of a more fundamentalist certainty, both in religious and political terms. He has said this is the primary source of his alienation from the modern Republican Party.

In 2009, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked Sullivan 19th on a list of &quot;The 25 Most Influential Liberals in the U.S. Media&quot;. Sullivan rejected the &quot;liberal&quot; label and set out his grounds in a published article in response.

In 2018, after Sarah Jeong, an editorial board member of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, received widespread criticism for her old anti-white tweets, Sullivan accused her of being racist and calling white people &quot;subhuman&quot;. He also accused Jeong of spreading eliminationism, the belief that political opponents are a societal cancer who should be separated, censored, or exterminated.

===LGBT issues===

==== HIV ====
In 1996, discussing HIV, he argued in the &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot; that &quot;this plague is over&quot; insofar as &quot;it no longer signifies death. It merely signifies illness.&quot; This led to &quot;a trend of white male journalists proclaiming that AIDS is over&quot;, according to Sarah Schulman.

==== Gay issues ====
Sullivan, like Marshall Kirk, Hunter Madsen, and Bruce Bawer, has been described by Urvashi Vaid as a proponent of &quot;legitimation&quot;, seeing the objective of the gay rights movement as &quot;mainstreaming gay and lesbian people&quot; rather than &quot;radical social change&quot;. Sullivan wrote the first major article in the U.S. advocating for gay people to be given the right to marry, published in &quot;The New Republic&quot; in 1989. According to one columnist for &quot;Intelligent Life,&quot; many on &quot;the gay left,&quot; aiming to alter social codes of sexuality for everyone, were chagrined at Sullivan&#x27;s endorsement of the &quot;assimilation&quot; of gay people into &quot;straight culture.&quot; In the wake of the United States Supreme Court rulings on same-sex marriage in 2013 (&quot;Hollingsworth v. Perry&quot; and &quot;United States v. Windsor&quot;), &quot;The New York Times&quot; op-ed columnist Ross Douthat suggested that Sullivan might be the most influential political writer of his generation, writing: &quot;No intellectual that I can think of, writing on a fraught and controversial topic, has seen their once-crankish, outlandish-seeming idea become the conventional wisdom so quickly, and be instantiated so rapidly in law and custom.&quot;

As of 2007, Sullivan opposed hate crime laws, arguing that they undermine freedom of speech and equal protection.

In 2014, Sullivan opposed calls to remove Brendan Eich as CEO of Mozilla for donating to the campaign for Proposition 8, which made same-sex marriage illegal in California. In 2015, he claimed that &quot;gay equality&quot; had been achieved in the U.S. by the persuasive arguments of &quot;old-fashioned liberalism&quot; rather than the activism of &quot;identity politics leftism.&quot;

==== Transgender issues ====
In 2007, Sullivan said he was &quot;no big supporter&quot; of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, arguing that it would &quot;not make much of a difference.&quot; He said the &quot;gay rights establishment&quot; was making a tactical error by insisting on protections for gender identity, as he believed it would be easier to pass the bill without transgender people.

In a September 2019 &quot;Intelligencer&quot; column, Sullivan expressed concern that gender-nonconforming children (especially those who are likely one day to come out as gay) might be encouraged to believe that they are transgender when they are not. In November 2019, Sullivan wrote another &quot;Intelligencer&quot; column on young women who, in their teens, had begun to transition to live as men but later detransitioned. In that article, he discussed the controversy over a 2018 journal article by Lisa Littman that proposed a socially mediated subtype of gender dysphoria that Littman had termed &quot;rapid onset gender dysphoria&quot;. In April 2021, he said it should be illegal for doctors to initiate cross-sex hormones for children under 16 or sex reassignment surgery for children under 18.

==== Recognitions ====
In 1996, Sullivan&#x27;s book &quot;Virtually Normal: An Argument about Homosexuality&quot; won the Mencken Award for Best Book, presented by the Free Press Association. In 2006, Sullivan was named an LGBT History Month icon.

===Foreign policy ===
====Iraq war, war on terror====
Sullivan supported the United States&#x27; 2003 invasion of Iraq and was initially hawkish in the war on terror, arguing that weakness would embolden terrorists. He was &quot;one of the most militant&quot; supporters of the Bush administration&#x27;s counter-terrorism strategy immediately following the September 11 attacks in 2001; in an essay for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, he wrote, &quot;The middle part of the country—the great red zone that voted for Bush—is clearly ready for war. The decadent Left in its enclaves on the coasts is not dead—and may well mount what amounts to a fifth column.&quot; Eric Alterman wrote in 2002 that Sullivan had &quot;set himself up as a one-man House Un-American Activities Committee&quot; running an &quot;inquisition&quot; to unmask &quot;anti-war Democrats&quot;, &quot;basing his argument less on the words these politicians speak than on the thoughts he knows them to be holding in secret&quot;.

Later, Sullivan criticised the Bush administration for its prosecution of the war, especially regarding the numbers of troops, protection of munitions, and treatment of prisoners, including the use of torture against detainees in U.S. custody. He argued that enemy combatants in the war on terror should not have been given status as prisoners of war because &quot;terrorists are not soldiers&quot;, but he believed that the U.S. government was required to abide by the rules of war—in particular, Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions—when dealing with such detainees. In retrospect, Sullivan said that the torture and abuse of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq had jolted him back to &quot;sanity&quot;. Of his early support for the invasion of Iraq, he said, &quot;I was terribly wrong. In the shock and trauma of 9/11, I forgot the principles of scepticism and doubt towards utopian schemes that I had learned.&quot;

On the 27 October 2006 episode of &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot;, Sullivan described conservatives and Republicans who refused to admit they had been wrong to support the Iraq War as &quot;cowards&quot;. On 26 February 2008, he wrote on his blog: &quot;After 9/11, I was clearly blinded by fear of al Qaeda and deluded by the overwhelming military superiority of the US and the ease of democratic transitions in Eastern Europe into thinking we could simply fight our way to victory against Islamist terror. I wasn&#x27;t alone. But I was surely wrong.&quot; His reversal on Iraq and increasing attacks on the Bush administration caused a severe backlash from many hawkish conservatives, who accused him of not being a &quot;real&quot; conservative.

Sullivan authored an opinion piece, &quot;Dear President Bush,&quot; that was featured as the cover article of the October 2009 edition of &quot;The Atlantic&quot;. In it, he called on Bush to take personal responsibility for the incidents and practices of torture that occurred during his administration as part of the war on terror.

====Israel====
Sullivan has said that he has &quot;always been a Zionist&quot;, but his views of Israel have become more critical over time. In February 2009, he wrote that he could no longer take the neoconservative position on Israel seriously.

In January 2010, Sullivan blogged that he was &quot;moving toward&quot; the idea of &quot;a direct American military imposition&quot; of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with NATO troops enforcing &quot;the borders of the new states of Palestine and Israel&quot;. He wrote, &quot;I too am sick of the Israelis. [...] I&#x27;m sick of having a great power like the US being dictated to.&quot; His post was criticised by Noah Pollak of &quot;Commentary&quot;, who called it &quot;crazy&quot;, &quot;heady stuff&quot; based on &quot;hubris&quot;.

In February 2010, Leon Wieseltier suggested in &quot;The New Republic&quot; that Sullivan, a former friend and colleague, had a &quot;venomous hostility toward Israel and Jews&quot; and was &quot;either a bigot, or just moronically insensitive&quot; toward the Jewish people. Sullivan rejected the accusation and was defended by some writers, while others at least partly supported Wieseltier.

In March 2019, Sullivan wrote in &quot;New York&quot; magazine that while he strongly supported the right of a Jewish state to exist, he felt that U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar&#x27;s comments about the influence of the pro-Israel lobby were largely correct. He said, &quot;it is simply a fact that the Israel lobby uses money, passion, and persuasion to warp this country&#x27;s foreign policy in favor of another country—out of all proportion to what Israel can do for the US.&quot;

====Iran====
Sullivan devoted a significant amount of blog space to the allegations of fraud and related protests after the 2009 Iranian presidential election. Francis Wilkinson of &quot;The Week&quot; said that Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;coverage—and that journalism term takes on new meaning here—of the uprising in Iran was nothing short of extraordinary. &#x27;Revolutionary&#x27; might be a better word.&quot;

Sullivan was inspired by the Iranian people&#x27;s reactions to the election results and used his blog as a hub of information. Because of the media blackout in Iran, Iranian Twitter accounts were a major source of information. Sullivan frequently quoted and linked to Nico Pitney of &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;.

=== Immigration ===
Writing for &quot;New York&quot; magazine, Sullivan expressed concern that high levels of immigration to the U.S. could drive &quot;white anxiety&quot; by making white Americans &quot;increasingly troubled by the pace of change&quot; since they were never asked whether they wanted such a demographic shift. Sullivan has advocated for tighter immigration controls on asylum and overall lower levels of immigration. He has criticized Democrats for what he perceived as their unwillingness to implement such controls.

=== Race ===
As editor at &quot;The New Republic&quot;, Sullivan published excerpts from the 1994 book &quot;The Bell Curve&quot;, by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray. The book, which contains a chapter about IQ in society and public policy, argues that there are innate differences in intelligence among racial groups. This view of an innate connection between race and intelligence is rejected by the majority of scientists.

In a 2015 article in &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;The New Republic&#x27;s Legacy on Race&quot;, Jeet Heer called Sullivan&#x27;s decision an example of the magazine&#x27;s &quot;myopia on racial issues&quot;. The importance of Sullivan to the popularization of &quot;The Bell Curve&quot; and race science was noted by Matthew Yglesias, who called Sullivan &quot;the punditocracy&#x27;s original champion of Murray&#x27;s thinking on genetics&quot;. Similarly, Gavin Evans wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that Sullivan &quot;was one of the loudest cheerleaders for &quot;The Bell Curve&quot; in 1994&quot; and that he &quot;returned to the fray in 2011, using his popular blog, The Dish, to promote the view that population groups had different innate potentials when it came to intelligence.&quot;

==Blogging==
In late 2000, Sullivan began his blog, &quot;The Daily Dish&quot;. The core principle of the blog has been the style of conservatism he views as traditional. This includes fiscal conservatism, limited government, and classic libertarianism on social issues. Sullivan opposes government involvement with respect to sexual and consensual matters between adults, such as the use of marijuana and prostitution. He believes recognition of same-sex marriage is a civil-rights issue but expressed willingness to promote it on a state-by-state legislative federalism basis, rather than trying to judicially impose the change. Most of Sullivan&#x27;s disputes with other conservatives have been over social issues and the handling of postwar Iraq.

Sullivan gave out yearly &quot;awards&quot; for various public statements, parodying those of the people the awards were named after. Throughout the year, nominees were mentioned in various blog posts. The readers of his blog chose winners at the end of each year.
* The Hugh Hewitt Award, introduced in June 2008 and named after a man Sullivan described as an &quot;absurd partisan fanatic&quot;, was for the most egregious attempts to label Barack Obama as un-American, alien, treasonous, and far out of the mainstream of American life and politics.
* The John Derbyshire Award was for egregious and outlandish comments on gays, women, and minorities.
* The Paul Begala Award was for extreme liberal hyperbole.
* The Michelle Malkin Award was for shrill, hyperbolic, divisive, and intemperate right-wing rhetoric. (Ann Coulter was ineligible for this award so that, in Sullivan&#x27;s words, &quot;other people will have a chance.&quot;)
* The Michael Moore Award was for divisive, bitter, and intemperate left-wing rhetoric.
* The Matthew Yglesias Award was for writers, politicians, columnists, or pundits who criticised their own side of the political spectrum, made enemies among political allies, and generally risked something for the sake of saying what they believed.
* The &quot;Poseur Alert&quot; was awarded for passages of prose that stood out for pretension, vanity, and bad writing designed to look profound.
* The Dick Morris Award (formerly the Von Hoffman Award) was for stunningly wrong cultural, political, and social predictions. Sullivan renamed this award in September 2012, saying that Von Hoffman was &quot;someone who in many ways got the future right—at least righter than I did.&quot;

In February 2007, Sullivan moved his blog from &quot;Time&quot; to &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, where he had accepted an editorial post. His presence was estimated to have contributed as much as 30% of the subsequent traffic increase for &quot;The Atlantic&quot; website.

In 2009, &quot;The Daily Dish&quot; won the 2008 Weblog Award for Best Blog.

Sullivan left &quot;The Atlantic&quot; to begin blogging at &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; in April 2011. In 2013, he announced that he was leaving &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; to launch &quot;The Dish&quot; as a stand-alone website, charging subscribers $20 a year.

In a note posted on &quot;The Dish&quot; on 28 January 2015, Sullivan announced his decision to retire from blogging. He posted his final blog entry on 6 February 2015. On 26 June 2015, he posted an additional piece in reaction to &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;, which legalized same-sex marriage in the United States.

In July 2020, Sullivan announced that The Dish would be revived as a weekly feature, including a column and podcast; he published there and elsewhere a notable obituary of Queen Elizabeth II.

==Personal life==
In 2001, it came to light that Sullivan had posted anonymous online advertisements for unprotected anal sex, preferably with &quot;other HIV-positive men&quot;. He was widely criticised in the media for this, with some critics noting that he had condemned Bill Clinton&#x27;s &quot;incautious behavior&quot;, though others wrote in his defence.

In 2003, Sullivan wrote a &quot;Salon&quot; article identifying himself as a member of the gay &quot;bear community&quot;. On 27 August 2007, he married Aaron Tone in Provincetown, Massachusetts. On May 26, 2023, Sullivan announced on his blog that he and Tone had divorced the previous week.

Sullivan was barred for many years from applying for U.S. citizenship because of his HIV-positive status. Following the statutory and administrative repeals of the HIV immigration ban in 2008 and 2009, respectively, he announced his intention to begin the process of becoming a permanent resident and citizen. On &quot;The Chris Matthews Show&quot; on 16 April 2011, Sullivan confirmed that he had become a permanent resident, showing his green card. On 1 December 2016, Sullivan became a naturalised US citizen.

He has been a daily user of cannabis since 2001.

=== Religion ===
Sullivan identifies himself as a faithful Catholic while disagreeing with some aspects of the Catholic Church&#x27;s doctrine.

He expressed concern about the election of Pope Benedict XVI in a &quot;Time&quot; magazine article on 24 April 2005, titled &quot;The Vicar of Orthodoxy&quot;. He wrote that Benedict was opposed to the modern world and women&#x27;s rights, and considered gays and lesbians innately disposed to evil. Sullivan has, however, agreed with Benedict&#x27;s assertion that reason is an integral element of faith.

Sullivan takes a moderate approach to religion, rejecting fundamentalism and describing himself as a &quot;dogged defender of pluralism and secularism.&quot; 
Sullivan was a friend of late journalist and atheist writer Christopher Hitchens,and often debated religion with him. Sullivan also defended religious moderates in a series of exchanges with atheist author Sam Harris.

<text>The SS &quot;Ourang Medan&quot; was a reported ghost ship and proposed urban legend of the 1940s. The vessel was supposedly discovered adrift after briefly broadcasting an SOS. The ships that responded to the SOS were reported to have discovered all the crew dead with their eyes open and their faces frozen in shock, as if they were witnessing a horrific scene. As they subsequently prepared to tow the &quot;Ourang Medan&quot; to port, a fire reportedly broke out in the hold resulting in its eventual sinking, hiding it and its mysteries forever.

The most prominent version of the story places the vessel in the Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia) in the Straits of Malacca waters, while other versions of the tale place the vessel around the Marshall Islands or Solomon Islands. The story was initially reported in Italy in 1940 and the UK in 1940, before similar stories were repeated in 1948 and later again in 1952. The inability of researchers to identify the vessel in any official records, along with the inconsistent reporting of the location, and other details that change from version to version, has led to speculative coverage in mystery publications such as the &quot;Fortean Times&quot;.

==The SS &quot;Ourang Medan&quot;==
The word &quot;Ourang&quot; (also written &quot;Orang&quot;) is Malay or Indonesian for &quot;man&quot; or &quot;person&quot;, whereas Medan is the largest city on the Indonesian island of Sumatra, giving an approximate translation of &quot;Man of Medan&quot;. Accounts of the ship&#x27;s accident have appeared in various books and magazines, mainly on Forteana. Their factual accuracy and even the ship&#x27;s existence, however, are unconfirmed, and details of the vessel&#x27;s construction and history remain unknown. Searches for any official registration or accident investigation recorded have proven unsuccessful.

==The story==
The 1940 version of the story told of a distress signal being sent out in an area south of the Solomon Islands. The first received stated “SOS from the steamship Ourang Medan. Beg ships with shortwave wireless get touch doctor. Urgent.” This was followed by “Probable second officer dead. Other members crew also killed. Disregard medical consultation. SOS urgent assistance warship.” After giving her position, the final message received was an incomplete phrase “crew has…”. Vessels responding to the Ourang Medan received no reply. The 1940 version of the story describes rescue vessels approaching the ship listing in the water, and upon boarding locating multiple crew dead at their posts. As they investigated further into the ship explosions were reportedly heard and so the rescuers abandoned the ship, and watched it subsequently go ablaze and sink into the Pacific.

By 1948, the story was embellished with further details. According to one version of the story, at some point of time in or around June 1947, two American vessels navigating the Straits of Malacca, the &quot;City of Baltimore&quot; and the &quot;Silver Star&quot;, among others passing by, picked up several distress messages from the nearby Dutch merchant ship &quot;Ourang Medan&quot;. (Vincent Gaddis and other sources list the approximate date as early February 1948).

A radio operator aboard the troubled vessel is reported to have sent the following message in Morse code: &quot;S.O.S. from &quot;Ourang Medan&quot; * * * We float. All officers including the captain, dead in chartroom and on the bridge. Probably whole of crew dead * * *.&quot; After a few more incoherent dots and dashes, the words &quot;I die.&quot; were received. No further communications were received. When the &quot;Silver Star&quot; crew eventually located and boarded the apparently undamaged &quot;Ourang Medan&quot; in an attempt at a rescue, the ship was found littered with corpses (including the carcass of a dog) everywhere, with the dead bodies found sprawled on their backs, the frozen (and allegedly badly-frightened) faces of the deceased upturned to the sun above with mouths gaping open and eyes staring straight ahead, with the corpses resembling horrible caricatures. No survivors were located and no visible signs of injuries on the dead bodies were observed. Just as the ship was to be prepared for a tow by the &quot;Silver Star&quot; to a nearby port, a fire then suddenly broke out in the ship&#x27;s No. 4 cargo-hold, forcing the boarding party to hastily evacuate the doomed Dutch freighter, thus preventing any further investigations to be carried out. Soon after, the &quot;Ourang Medan&quot; was witnessed exploding before finally sinking.

Some versions of the story attribute further details to the sole survivor, an unnamed German, of the &quot;Ourang Medan&quot; crew, who swam to safety, and was subsequently found by an Italian missionary and natives on Taongi Atoll in the Marshall Islands. The man, before perishing, tells the missionary that the ship was carrying a badly stowed cargo of oil of vitriol, and that most of the crew perished because of the poisonous fumes escaping from broken containers. According to the story, the &quot;Ourang Medan&quot; was sailing from an unnamed small Chinese port to Costa Rica, and deliberately avoided the authorities.

==Hypotheses==
===Unsecured hazardous materials cargo===
Bainton and others hypothesize that &quot;Ourang Medan&quot; might have been involved in smuggling operations of chemical substances such as a combination of potassium cyanide and nitroglycerin or even wartime stocks of nerve agents. According to these theories, sea water would have entered the ship&#x27;s hold, reacting with the cargo to release toxic gases, which then caused the crew to succumb to asphyxia and/or poisoning. Later, the sea water would have reacted with the nitroglycerin, causing the reported fire and explosion.

Another theory is that the ship was transporting nerve gas which the Japanese military had been storing in China during the war, and which was handed over to the U.S. military at the end of the war. No U.S. ship could transport it as it would leave a paper trail. It was therefore loaded onto a non-registered ship for transport to the U.S. or an island in the Pacific.

===Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning===
Gaddis puts forward the theory that an undetected smouldering fire or malfunction in the ship&#x27;s boiler system might have been responsible for the shipwreck. Escaping carbon monoxide would have caused the deaths of all aboard, with the fire slowly spreading out of control, leading to the vessel&#x27;s ultimate destruction.

==Contemporaneous coverage==
One of the earliest incarnations of the story is first recounted in &quot;Il Piccolo&quot;, the local paper of Trieste, in a series of “I drammi del mare” (Dramas of the Sea) authored by Silvio Scherli from 1940.

Reporting by The Skittish Library shows that in 1940 there were contemporaneous newspaper reports of the incident taken from the Associated Press in British newspapers the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; and the &quot;Yorkshire Evening Post&quot;. These initial reports placed the ship in proximity of the Solomon Islands, omit the rescue vessels names, and the SOS messages are different from later reports. The origin of the story is described as the Associated Press, and reported from Trieste in Italy but attributed to a Merchant Marine Officer.

In 1948, a series of three articles in the Dutch-Indonesian newspaper &quot;De locomotief: Samarangsch handels- en advertentie-blad&quot; (February 3, 1948, with two photographs duplicated from the Il Piccolo article, February 28, 1948, and March 13, 1948). The source for these stories are given as Silvio Scherli of Trieste and introduce new details about the incident not previously included in 1940s reporting including the significantly altered SOS and the addition of the surviving sailor who (on his deathbed) tells a missionary about the events, who subsequently recounted them to Scherli. The Dutch newspaper concludes with a disclaimer: &quot;This is the last part of our story about the mystery of the &quot;Ourang Medan&quot;. We must repeat that we don&#x27;t have any other data on this &#x27;mystery of the sea&#x27;. Nor can we answer the many unanswered questions in the story. It may seem obvious that the entire story is a fantasy, a thrilling romance of the sea. On the other hand, the author, Silvio Scherli, assures us of the authenticity of the story.&quot; 

In October 10, 1948, the story was published in &quot;The Albany Times&quot; of Albany, New York and references its original source as the Dutch newspaper &quot;Elsevier&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. The story was repeated in the May 1952 issue of the &quot;Proceedings of the Merchant Marine Council&quot;, published by the United States Coast Guard. 

Silvio Scherli is said to have produced a report on Trieste &quot;Export Trade&quot; on September 28, 1959.

==Skepticism==
Several authors note their inability to find any mention of the case in Lloyd&#x27;s Shipping Register. Furthermore, no registration records for a ship by the name of &quot;Ourang Medan&quot; could be located in various countries, including the Netherlands. While author Roy Bainton states that the identity of the &quot;Silver Star&quot;, reported to have been involved in the failed rescue attempt, has been established with a high probability, the complete lack of information on the sunken ship itself has given rise to suspicion about the origins and credibility of the account. Ships logs for the &quot;Silver Star&quot; did not show a record of any such rescue attempt. Bainton and others have put forward the possibility that accounts of, among others, the date, location, names of the ships involved, and circumstances of the accident might have been inaccurate or exaggerated, or that the story might be completely fictitious.

<text>Packard (formerly the Packard Motor Car Company) was an American luxury automobile company located in Detroit, Michigan. The first Packard automobiles were produced in 1899, and the last Packards were built in South Bend, Indiana, in 1958.

One of the &quot;Three Ps&quot; – alongside Peerless Motor Company and Pierce-Arrow – the company was known for building high-quality luxury automobiles before World War II. Owning a Packard was considered prestigious, and surviving examples are often found in museums and automobile collections.

Packard vehicles featured innovations, including the modern steering wheel, air-conditioning in a passenger car, and one of the first production 12-cylinder engines, adapted from developing the Liberty L-12 engine used during World War I to power warplanes.

During World War II, Packard produced 55,523 units of the two-stage/two-speed supercharger equipped Merlin V-12s engines under contract with Rolls-Royce. Packard also made the versions of the Liberty L-12 V-12 engine. This updated engine powered United States Navy PT boats.

After the Second World War, Packard struggled to survive as an independent automaker against the domestic Big Three (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler). Packard merged with Studebaker in 1953 and formed the Studebaker-Packard Corporation. This merger was intended to be temporary while an eventual consolidation with American Motors Company (AMC) was planned. Disagreements among the firms&#x27; executives thwarted these plans, so Studebaker-Packard remained a separate company. The Packard brand was phased out in 1959 after two years of declining sales of the Studebaker-built 1957 and 1958 model year Packards.

==History==

===1899–1905===
Packard was founded by James Ward Packard, his brother William, and their partner, George Lewis Weiss, in Warren, Ohio, where 400 Packard automobiles were built at their factory on 408 Dana Street Northeast, from 1899 until 1903. A mechanical engineer, James Packard believed they could build a better horseless carriage than the Winton cars owned by Weiss, an important Winton stockholder, after Packard complained to Alexander Winton and offered suggestions for improvement, which were ignored. Winton replied to the suggestions by essentially telling Packard to &quot;go build your own car&quot;. Packard&#x27;s first car was built in Warren, Ohio, on November 6, 1899.

Henry Bourne Joy, a member of one of Detroit&#x27;s oldest and wealthiest families, bought a Packard. Impressed by its reliability, he visited the Packards and soon enlisted a group of investors, including Truman Handy Newberry and Russell A. Alger Jr. On October 2, 1902, this group refinanced and renamed the New York and Ohio Automobile Company as the Packard Motor Car Company, with James Packard as president. Alger later served as vice president. Packard moved operations to Detroit soon after, and Joy became general manager (later chairman of the board). An original Packard, reputedly the first manufactured, was donated by a grateful James Packard to his &quot;alma mater&quot;, Lehigh University, and is preserved there in the Packard Laboratory. Another is on display at the Packard Museum in Warren, Ohio.

While the Black Motor Company&#x27;s Black went as low as $375, Western Tool Works&#x27; Gale Model A roadster was $500, the high-volume Oldsmobile Runabout went for $650, and the Cole 30 and Cole Runabout were $1,500, Packard concentrated on cars with prices starting at $2,600. The marque developed a following among wealthy purchasers in the United States and abroad, competing with European marques like Rolls-Royce, Renault, Isotta Fraschini, and Mercedes-Benz.

The Packard plant on East Grand Boulevard in Detroit was located on over of land. Designed by Albert Kahn Associates, it included an early use of reinforced concrete for an automotive factory when building #10 opened in 1906. Its craftsmen practised over 80 trades. The dilapidated plant stood until demolition commenced in September 2022, despite repeated fires. The factory is in close proximity to the current General Motors Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly, which was the former site of the Dodge Vehicle factory from 1910 until 1980. Architect Kahn also designed the Packard Proving Grounds in Shelby Township, Michigan.

===1906–1930===


From this beginning, through and beyond the 1930s, Packard-built vehicles were perceived as highly competitive among high-priced luxury American automobiles. The company was commonly referred to as being one of the &quot;Three Ps&quot; of American motordom royalty, along with Pierce-Arrow of Buffalo, New York, and Peerless of Cleveland, Ohio. For most of its history, Packard was guided by its president and General Manager James Alvan Macauley, who served as President of the National Automobile Manufacturers Association. Inducted into the Automobile Hall of Fame, Macauley made Packard the number one designer and producer of luxury automobiles in the United States. The marque was also competitive abroad, with markets in 61 countries. Gross income for the company was $21,889,000 in 1928 (equivalent to $ million in ). Macauley was also responsible for the iconic Packard slogan, &quot;Ask the Man Who Owns One&quot;.

The Packard Six was initially introduced as a senior-level luxury platform for three years starting in 1913, then upgraded to the Packard Twin Six starting in 1916. The first appearance of the Packard &quot;Goddess of Speed&quot; hood ornament was in 1925 on the Packard Eight and soon adorned all models, while the Cormorant or Swan appeared in the 1930s. The Adonis hood ornament was briefly used in the late 1920s.

In the 1920s, Packard exported more cars than any other in its price class, and in 1930, sold almost twice as many abroad as any other marque priced over . In 1931, 10 Packards were owned by the Imperial House of Japan. Between 1924 and 1930, Packard was also the top-selling luxury brand.

In addition to luxury cars, Packard built trucks. A Packard truck carrying a three-ton load drove from New York City to San Francisco between July 8 and August 24, 1912. In the same year, Packard had service depots in 104 cities.

The Packard Motor Corporation Building at Philadelphia, also designed by Albert Kahn, was built in 1910–1911. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

By 1931, Packards were also being produced in Canada.

===1931–1936===
Entering the 1930s, Packard attempted to beat the stock market crash and subsequent Great Depression by manufacturing ever more opulent and expensive cars than it had prior to October 1929, and began offering different platforms that focused on different price points allowing the company to offer more products and remain competitive. While the Eight five-seater sedan had been the company&#x27;s top-seller for years, the Twin Six, designed by Chief engineer Jesse G. Vincent, was introduced for 1932, with prices starting at ; in 1933, it would be renamed the Packard Twelve, a name it retained for the remainder of its run (through 1939). Also in 1931, Packard pioneered a system it called Ride Control, which made the hydraulic shock absorbers adjustable from within the car. For one year only, 1932, Packard fielded an upper-medium-priced car, the Light Eight, at a base price of $1,750 (), or $735 () less than the Standard Eight.

Packard rivals Cadillac and Lincoln benefited from the huge support structure of GM and Ford. Packard could not match the two new automotive giants for resources. The 1920s had proven extremely profitable for the company and it had assets of approximately $20 million in 1932 ($ million in dollars) while many luxury car manufacturers were almost broke. Peerless ceased production in 1932, converting the Cleveland manufacturing plant automobile production to brewing for Carling Black Label Beer. By 1938, Franklin, Marmon, Ruxton, Stearns-Knight, Stutz, Duesenberg, and Pierce-Arrow had all closed.

Packard had one advantage that some other luxury automakers did not: a single production line. By maintaining a single line and interchangeability between models, Packard was able to maintain low costs. Packard did not change models as often as other manufacturers. Rather than introducing new models annually, Packard began using its own &quot;Series&quot; formula for differentiating its model changeovers in 1923 borrowing a strategy from GM called planned obsolescence. The new model series did not debut on a strictly annual basis, with some series lasting nearly two years, and others lasting as brief as seven months. In the long run, Packard averaged approximately one new series per year. By 1930, Packard automobiles were considered part of its Seventh Series. By 1942, Packard was in its Twentieth Series. The &quot;Thirteenth Series&quot; was omitted due to the western superstition about the number 13.

To meet the challenge of the Depression, Packard started producing more affordable cars in the medium price range. This was a necessary step as the demand for hand-built luxury cars had diminished sharply and people who could afford such vehicles were reluctant to be seen in them when unemployment was over 20%. In 1935, the company introduced the 120, its first car under $1000 (). Sales more than tripled that year and doubled again in 1936. To produce the 120, Packard built a separate factory. By 1936, Packard&#x27;s labor force was divided nearly evenly between the high-priced &quot;Senior&quot; lines (Twelve, Super Eight, and Eight) and the medium-priced &quot;Junior&quot; models, although more than 10 times more Juniors were produced than Seniors. This was because the 120 models were built using thoroughly modern mass production techniques, while the senior Packards used a great deal more hand labor and traditional craftsmanship. Although Packard almost certainly could not have survived the Depression without the highly successful Junior models, they did have the effect of diminishing the Senior models&#x27; exclusive image among those few who could still afford a luxury car. The 120 models were more modern in basic design than the Senior models. For example, the 1935 Packard 120 featured independent front suspension and hydraulic brakes, features that did not appear on the Senior Packards until 1937.

During this time, Packards were built in Windsor, Ontario by the Packard Motor Company of Canada to benefit from Imperial Preference as well as to build right-hand-drive cars for export. Production started in 1931, with the best year being 1937, with just over 2,500 cars built. Parts manufactured in Canada included tires, upholstery, radiator cores, headlamps, springs, and wheels, while the engines were locally assembled. Production ended in 1939, although the company maintained an office in Windsor for many years.

===1937–1941===
Packard was still the premier luxury automobile, even though the majority of cars being built were the Packard One-Twenty and Super Eight model ranges. Hoping to catch still more of the market, Packard issued the Packard 115C in 1937, powered by a Packard six-cylinder engine. The decision to introduce the &quot;Packard Six&quot;, priced at around $1200 (), was in time for the 1938 recession. This model also tagged Packards as something less exclusive than they had been in the public&#x27;s mind and in the long run hurt Packard&#x27;s reputation of building some of America&#x27;s finest luxury cars. The Six, redesignated 110 in 1940–41, continued for three years after the war.

In 1939, Packard introduced Econo-Drive, a kind of overdrive, claimed able to reduce engine speed 27.8%; it could be engaged at any speed over . The same year, the company introduced a fifth, transverse shock absorber and made column shift (known as Handishift) available on the 120 and Six.


A new body shape was introduced for the 1941 model year, the Packard Clipper. It was available only as a four-door model on the wheelbase of the 160, but powered by version of straight-8 engine used the 120.

===1942–1945===
In 1942, the Packard Motor Car Company converted to 100% war production. During World War II, Packard again built airplane engines, licensing the Merlin engine from Rolls-Royce as the V-1650, which powered the P-51 Mustang fighter, ironically known as the &quot;Cadillac of the Skies&quot; by GIs in WWII. Packard also built 1350-, 1400-, and 1500-hp V-12 marine engines for American PT boats (each boat used three) and some of Britain&#x27;s patrol boats. Packard ranked 18th among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts.

By the end of the war in Europe, Packard Motor Car Company had produced over 55,000 combat engines. Sales in 1944 were $455,118,600. By May 6, 1945, Packard had a backlog on war orders of $568 million.

===1946–1956===
By the end of World War II, Packard was in excellent financial condition with assets of around $33 million, but several management mistakes became more apparent with time. Like other US automobile companies, Packard resumed civilian car production in late 1945, labeling them as 1946 models by modestly updating their 1942 models. As only tooling for the Clipper was at hand, the Senior-series cars were not rescheduled. One version of the story is that the Senior dies were left outdoors to rust and were not usable. Another tale is that Roosevelt gave Stalin the dies for the Senior series, but the ZiS-110 state limousines were a separate design.


The Clipper became outdated as the new envelope bodies started appearing, led by Studebaker and Kaiser-Frazer. Although Packard was in good financial condition as the war ended, they had not sold enough cars to pay the cost of tooling for the 1941 design. While most automakers were able to introduce new vehicles for 1948 and 1949, Packard could not until 1951. The company updated cars by adding new sheet metal to the existing body (which added of curb weight). Six-cylinder cars were discontinued for the U.S. market, and a convertible was added. These new designs hid their relationship with the Clipper. Even that name was dropped for a while.

The design chosen was a &quot;bathtub&quot; type, commonly called ponton. While this was considered futuristic during the war and the concept was taken further with the 1949 Nash, and survived for decades in the Saab 92–96 in Europe, the 1948–1950 Packard styling was polarizing. To some, it was sleek and blended classic with modern. Others nicknamed it the &quot;pregnant elephant&quot;. Test driver for &quot;Modern Mechanix&quot;, Tom McCahill, referred to the newly designed Packard as &quot;a goat&quot; and &quot;a dowager in a Queen Mary hat&quot; in the January 1948 issue. Packard sold 2,000 vehicles in 1948 and a total of 116,000 of the 1949 models. In the early post-WWII years, the demand for new cars was extremely high, and nearly any vehicle would sell. Attempting to maintain strong sales beyond this point would prove more problematic.

Cadillac&#x27;s new 1948 cars had sleek, aircraft-inspired styling that immediately made Packard&#x27;s &quot;bathtub&quot; styling seem old-fashioned. Cadillac also debuted a brand-new OHV V8 engine in 1949 whereas Packard&#x27;s lack of a modern engine became an increasing liability.

Packard outsold Cadillac until circa 1950; most sales were the midrange volume models. During this time, Cadillac was among the earliest US makers to offer an automatic transmission (the Hydramatic in 1941). Packard caught up with the Ultramatic, offered on top models in 1949 and all models from 1950 onward, but its perceived market reputation now had it as a competitor to Buick.

Designed and built by Packard, the Ultramatic featured a lockup torque converter with two speeds. Early Ultramatics normally operated only in &quot;high&quot;, with &quot;low&quot; having to be selected manually. Beginning in late 1954, it could be set to operate only in &quot;high&quot; or to start in &quot;low&quot; and automatically shift into &quot;high&quot;. &quot;High&quot; was intended for normal driving and &quot;Low&quot; was mainly for navigating hills.

The Ultramatic made Packard the only American automotive manufacturer other than GM to develop an automatic transmission completely in-house. Ford had chosen to outsource their design to Borg-Warner (Ford had attempted to purchase Ultramatics from Packard to install in Lincolns, but bought Hydramatics until Lincoln developed its own automatic transmission a few years later). Ultramatic did not compare to GM&#x27;s Hydramatic for smoothness of shifting, acceleration, or reliability. The resources spent on Ultramatic deprived Packard of the opportunity to develop a modern V8 engine. Also, when a new body style was added in addition to standard sedans, coupes, and convertibles, Packard introduced a station wagon instead of a two-door hardtop in response to Cadillac&#x27;s Coupe DeVille. The Station Sedan, a wagon-like body that was mostly steel, with a good deal of decorative wood in the back. A total of 3,864 were sold over its three years of production. The Packards of the late 1940s and early 1950s were built with traditional craftsmanship and the best materials, but the combination of the lower-priced Packards leading sales and impacting the prestige of their higher-end models and some questionable marketing decisions, Packard&#x27;s crown as &quot;king&quot; of the luxury car market was at risk. In 1950, sales dropped to 42,000 cars for the model year. When Packard&#x27;s president George T. Christopher set the course for an evolutionary styling approach with a facelift for 1951, others wanted a radical new design. Christopher resigned and Packard treasurer Hugh Ferry became president and demanded a new direction. Ferry, who had spent his career at Packard in the accounting department, did not want the job and quickly made it clear that he was serving on a temporary basis until a permanent company president could be found.

The 1951 Packards were redesigned. Designer John Reinhart introduced a high-waisted, more squared-off profile fitting the contemporary styling trends — very different from the traditional flowing design of the postwar era. New styling features included a one-piece windshield, a wrap-around rear window, small tailfins on the long-wheelbase models, a full-width grille (replacing the traditional Packard upright design), and blunt &quot;guideline fenders&quot; with the hood and front fenders at the same height. The wheelbase was used on the 200-series standard and Deluxe two- and four-doors, 250-series Mayfair two-door hardtops (Packard&#x27;s first), and convertibles. The higher-end 300 and Patrician 400 models were built on a wheelbase. The 200-series models were low-end models and now included a business coupe. The new appearance had similarities to Oldsmobiles, which were more moderately priced and sold in greater numbers.

The 250, 300, and 400/Patricians were Packard&#x27;s flagship models and comprised the majority of the production for that year. The Patrician was now the premium Packard, replacing the Custom Eight line. Original plans were to equip it with a engine, but the company decided that sales would not be sufficient to justify producing the larger, more expensive engine, and so the de-bored (previously the middle engine) was used. While the smaller engine offered nearly equal performance in the new Packards to that of the 356, the move was seen by some as further denigrating Packard&#x27;s image as a luxury car.

Since 1951 offered little new from other manufacturers, Packard&#x27;s redesigned lineup sold nearly 101,000 cars. The 1951 Packards were a mixture of the modern (automatic transmissions) and old (using flathead inline eights when OHV V8 engines were becoming the norm). No domestic car lines had OHV V8s in 1948, but by 1955, every car line offered a version. The Packard inline eight, despite being an older design that lacked the power of Cadillac&#x27;s engines, produced no vibration. When combined with an Ultramatic transmission, the drivetrain made for a quiet and smooth experience on the road. Packard could not keep up with the horsepower race, which was increasingly moving to high compression, short-stroke engines capable of sustained driving at speeds above .

Packard&#x27;s image was increasingly seen as dowdy and old-fashioned, unappealing to younger customers. Surveys found that nearly 75% of Packard customers had owned previous Packards and few new buyers were attracted to the make. Compounding this problem was the company&#x27;s geriatric leadership. The Packard board of directors by the early 1950s had an average age of 67. In 1948, Alvin Macauley, born during the Grant Administration, had stepped down as chairman. Hugh Ferry decided to hire an outsider as president. He recruited James Nance from appliance manufacturer Hotpoint. At 52, Nance was more than a decade younger than the youngest Packard executive.

One reason for the aged leadership of Packard was the company&#x27;s lack of a pension plan for executives (rank-and-file workers had a pension plan per their United Auto Workers contract). As a result, Packard executives were reluctant to retire with no source of income other than a Social Security payment, thus blocking younger men from coming to power in the company. One of James Nance&#x27;s first actions as president was creating a pension plan to induce Packard executives to retire. Nance worked to snag Korean War military contracts and turn around Packard&#x27;s badly diluted image. He declared that Packard would cease producing mid-priced cars and build only luxury models to compete with Cadillac. As part of this strategy, Nance unveiled a low-production (only 750 made) model for 1953, the Caribbean convertible. Competing directly with the other specialty convertibles marketed that year, (Buick Skylark, Oldsmobile 98 Fiesta, Cadillac Eldorado, and Chrysler New Yorker Deluxe), it was equally well-received and outsold its competition. Nevertheless, overall sales declined in 1953. While the limited edition luxury models such as the Caribbean convertible and the Patrician 400 Sedan, and the Derham custom formal sedan brought back some prestige from past Packards, the &quot;high pocket&quot; styling introduced two model years prior was no longer drawing buyers for Packer&#x27;s volume models. Furthermore, Packard&#x27;s build quality also began slipping during this period as employee morale decreased.

While American independent manufacturers like Packard did well during the early postwar period, supply had caught up with demand and by the early 1950s they were increasingly challenged as the domestic &quot;Big Three&quot;—General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler—battled intensely for sales in the economy, medium-priced, and luxury markets. Those independents that remained in business in the early 1950s, merged. In 1953, Kaiser merged with Willys to become Kaiser-Willys. Nash and Hudson became American Motors Corporation (AMC). The strategy for these mergers included cutting costs and strengthening their sales organizations to meet the intense competition from the Big Three.

In 1953–54, Ford and GM waged a brutal sales war, cutting prices and forcing cars on dealers. While this had little effect on either company, it damaged independent automakers. Nash&#x27;s president George W. Mason thus proposed that the four major independents (Nash, Hudson, Packard, and Studebaker) merge into one firm American Motors Corporation (AMC). Mason held informal discussions with Nance to outline his strategic vision, and an agreement was reached for AMC to buy Packard&#x27;s Ultramatic transmissions and V8 engines. They were used in 1955 Hudsons and Nashes.

It did not help that Chrysler and Ford waged a campaign of &quot;stealing&quot; Packard dealerships during the early 1950s. Consequently, Packard&#x27;s dealer network became smaller and more scattered which made it even more difficult to sell Packard vehicles.

Although Korean War defense contracts brought in badly-needed revenue, the war ended in 1953 and the new Secretary of Defense Charles E. Wilson began cutting defense contracts from all automotive manufacturers other than GM, where he had been president.

Packard&#x27;s last major development was the Torsion-Level suspension by Bill Allison, dubbed &quot;Torsion Level Ride&quot;. The front and rear suspensions on each side of the car side are interconnected by a long torsion bar. This design reduced pitching while allowing for low spring rates, which imbued Packards with a ride that was soft yet controlled. Additionally, this suspension featured an electro-mechanical compensator or &quot;levilizer&quot; that kept the car level regardless of passenger or trunk loading.

==Studebaker-Packard Corporation==

As of October 1, 1954, Packard Motor Car Company bought the failing Studebaker Corporation to form America&#x27;s fourth-largest automobile company, but without full knowledge of their circumstances or consideration of the financial implications. Studebaker-Packard&#x27;s Nance refused to consider merging with AMC unless he could take the top command position (Mason and Nance were former competitors as heads of the Kelvinator and Hotpoint appliance companies, respectively), but Mason&#x27;s grand vision of a Big Four American auto industry ended on October 8, 1954, with his sudden death from acute pancreatitis and pneumonia.

A week after the death of Mason, the new president of AMC, George W. Romney, announced &quot;there are no mergers under way either directly or indirectly&quot;. Romney continued with Mason&#x27;s commitment to buy components from SPC. Although Mason and Nance had previously agreed that SPC would purchase parts from AMC, it did not do so. Packard&#x27;s engines and transmissions were comparatively expensive, so AMC began development of its own V8 engine, and replaced the outsourced unit by mid-1956. Although Nash and Hudson merged, the four-way merger Mason had hoped for, which would have joined Nash, Hudson, Studebaker, and Packard, did not materialize. The S-P marriage (really a Packard buyout) proved to be a crippling mistake. Although Packard was in fair financial condition, Studebaker was not, struggling with high overhead and production costs and needing the impossible figure of 250,000 cars annually to break even. Due diligence was placed behind &quot;merger fever&quot;, and the deal was rushed. It became clear after the merger that Studebaker&#x27;s deteriorating financial situation put Packard&#x27;s survival at risk.

Nance had hoped for a total redesign in 1954, but the necessary time and money were lacking. Packard that year (total production 89,796) comprised the bread-and-butter Clipper line (the 250 series was dropped), Mayfair hardtop coupes and convertibles, and a new entry-level long-wheelbase sedan named Cavalier. Among the Clippers was a novelty pillared coupe, the Sportster, styled to resemble a hardtop.

With time and money lacking, 1954 styling was unchanged except for modified headlights and taillights, essentially trim items. A new hardtop named Pacific was added to the flagship Patrician series and all higher-end Packards featured a bored-out engine. Air conditioning became available for the first time since 1942 although Packard introduced air conditioning in the 1930s. Clippers (which comprised over 80% of production) became available in a hardtop model, Super Panama, but sales fell to 31,000 cars.

The new model Nance hoped for was delayed until 1955, partially because of Packard&#x27;s merger with Studebaker. Packard stylist Dick Teague was called upon by Nance to design the 1955 line, and to Teague&#x27;s credit, the 1955 Packard was well received. Not only was the body completely updated and modernized, but the suspension was new, with torsion bars front and rear, along with an electric control that kept the car level regardless of load or road conditions. Along with the new design was Packard&#x27;s new overhead-valve V8, displacing , replacing the straight-eight that had been used for decades. Packard offered a variety of power, comfort, and convenience features, such as power steering and brakes as well as electric window lifts. Air conditioning was available on all car makes by the mid-1950s, but it was installed on only a handful of cars in 1955 and 1956 despite Packard&#x27;s status as a luxury car. Model year sales only climbed back to 55,000 units in 1955, including Clipper, in what was a strong year across the industry.

As the 1955 models went into production, an old problem flared up. Back in 1941, Packard had outsourced its bodies to Briggs Manufacturing Company. Briggs founder Walter Briggs had died in early 1952 and his family decided to sell the company to pay estate taxes. Chrysler promptly purchased Briggs and notified Packard that they would cease supplying bodies after Packard&#x27;s contract with Briggs expired at the end of 1953. Packard was forced to move body production to an undersized plant on Connor Avenue in Detroit. The facility proved too small and caused endless tie-ups and quality problems. Bad quality control hurt the company&#x27;s image and caused sales to plummet for 1956, though the problems had largely been resolved by that point. Additionally, a &quot;brain drain&quot; of talent away from Packard was underway, including John Z. DeLorean.

For 1956, the Clipper became a separate make, with Clipper Custom and Deluxe models available. Now the Packard-Clipper business model was a mirror to Lincoln-Mercury. &quot;Senior&quot; Packards were built in four body styles, each with a unique model name. Patrician was used for the four-door top-of-the-line sedans, Four Hundred for the hardtop coupes, and the Caribbean for the convertible and vinyl-roof two-door hardtop. In the spring of 1956, the Executive was introduced. In a four-door sedan and a two-door hardtop, the Executive was aimed at the buyer who wanted a luxury car but could not justify Packard&#x27;s pricing. It was an intermediate model using the Packard name and the Senior models&#x27; front end, but using the Clipper platform and rear fenders. This was to some confusion and went against what James Nance had been attempting for several years to accomplish, the separation of the Clipper line from Packard. As late as the cars&#x27; introduction to the market was, there was reasoning for in 1957 this car was to be continued. It then became a baseline Packard on the all-new 1957 Senior shell. Clippers would share bodies with Studebaker from 1957.

The new 1955 Packard design did not affect Cadillac&#x27;s continuing to lead the luxury market segment, followed by Lincoln, Packard, and Imperial. Reliability problems with the automatic transmission and all electrical accessories further eroded the public&#x27;s opinion of Packard. Sales were good for 1955 compared to the previous year as this was a record year for the automobile industry. Packard&#x27;s sales fell for 1956 due to the fit and finish of the 1955 models as well as mechanical issues relating to the new engineering features. These defects cost Packard millions in recalls and tarnished its image.

For 1956, Teague kept the basic 1955 design and added more styling touches to the body such as then−fashionable three-toning. Headlamps hooded in a more radical style in the front fenders and a slight shuffling of chrome distinguished the 1956 models. &quot;Electronic Push-button Ultramatic&quot;, which located transmission push buttons on a stalk on the steering column, proved troublesome, adding to the car&#x27;s negative reputation, possibly soon to become an orphan. Model series remained the same, but the V8 was now enlarged to for the Senior series, the largest in the industry. In the top-of-the-line Caribbean, that engine produced . Clippers continued to use the 352 engine. There were plans for an all−new 1957 line of Senior Packards based on the show car Predictor. Clippers and Studebakers would also share many inner and outer body panels. (A private presentation of this 1957 new-car program was made to Wall Street&#x27;s investment bankers at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York in January 1956.) These models were in many ways far advanced from what would be produced by any other automaker at the time, save Chrysler, which soon felt public wrath for its poor quality issues after rushing its all−new 1957 lines into production. Nance was dismissed and moved to Ford as the head of the new Mercury-Edsel-Lincoln division. Although Nance tried everything, the company failed to secure funding for retooling, forcing Packard to share Studebaker platforms and body designs. With no funding to retool for the advanced new models envisioned, Studebaker-Packard&#x27;s fate was sealed. The large Packard was effectively dead in an executive decision to kill &quot;the car we could not afford to lose&quot;. The last fully Packard-designed vehicle, a Patrician four-door sedan, rolled off the Conner Avenue assembly line on June 25, 1956.

===1957–1958===
In 1957, no more Packards were built in Detroit and the Clipper disappeared as a separate brand name. Instead, a Studebaker President–based car bearing the Packard Clipper nameplate appeared on the market, but sales were slow. Available in just two body styles, Town Sedan (four-door sedan) and Country Sedan (four-door station wagon), they were powered by Studebaker&#x27;s V8 with a McCulloch supercharger, delivering the same as the 1956 Clipper Custom, although at higher revolutions. Borrowing design cues from the 1956 Clipper (visual in the grille and dash), with wheel covers, tail lamps, and dials from 1956 along with the Packard cormorant hood mascot and trunk chrome trim from 1955 senior Packards, front bumpers, and Dagmars from the 1956 model, the 1957 Packard Clipper was much more than a badge-engineered Studebaker—but also far from a Patrician. Had the company been able to invest more money to finish the transformation and position the car under a senior line of &quot;true Packards&quot;, it might have been a successful Clipper. Standing alone the cars sold in limited numbers; a number of Packard dealers dropped their franchises while customers stayed away, despite huge price discounts, fearful of buying a car that could soon be an orphan. Additionally, there was internal competition from Studebaker-Packard dealers that also carried the Mercedes-Benz brand, to which SP had the USA rights, with the market flooded by inexpensive cars, minor automakers struggled to sell vehicles at loss leader prices to keep up with Ford and GM. There was a general decline in demand for large cars heralded an industry switch to compact cars such as the Studebaker Lark.

The marque suffered further loss of exclusivity and consumers perceived a reduction in quality. Competitors and media critics described the new models as &quot;Packardbakers&quot;. The 1958 models were launched with no series name, simply as &quot;Packard&quot;. New body styles were introduced, and a two-door hardtop joined the four-door sedan. A new premier model appeared with a sporting profile: the Packard Hawk was based on the Studebaker Golden Hawk and featured a new nose and a fake spare wheel molded in the trunk lid reminiscent of the concurrent Imperial. The 1958 Packards were among the first in the industry to be &quot;facelifted&quot; with plastic parts. The housing for the new dual headlights and the complete fins were fiberglass parts grafted on Studebaker bodies. Very little chrome was on the lower front clip. Designer Duncan McRae managed to include the 1956 Clipper tail lights for one last time which also included the &quot;Packard Cusps&quot; in the front hood. Added to the front of all but the Hawk were jet nacelles for quad headlights, in a desperate attempt to keep up with late-1950s styling cues. All Packards were equipped with road wheels to lower the profile. The public reaction was predictable and sales were 2,622 vehicles for the 1958 model year, even being outsold by Checker Motors Corp. The Studebaker factory was older than Packard&#x27;s Detroit plant, with higher production requirements, which added to dipping sales. A new compact car on which the company staked its survival, the Lark, was a year away, and it also failed to sell in sufficient numbers to keep the marque afloat. Several makes were discontinued around this time: Packard, Edsel, Hudson, Nash, DeSoto, and Kaiser. Not since the 1930s had so many makes disappeared, and it would not be until the automotive industry crisis of 2008–10 that so many makes would be dropped at the same time again. The last Packard by Studebaker Packard Corporation rolled off the assembly line on July 16, 1958.

===Concept Packards===
During the 1950s, a number of &quot;dream cars&quot; were built by Packard in an attempt to keep the marque alive in the imaginations of the American car-buying public. Included in this category are the 1952 Pan American that led to the production Caribbean and the Panther (also known as Daytona), based on a 1954 platform. Shortly after the introduction of the Caribbean, Packard showed a prototype hardtop called the Balboa. It featured a reverse-slanted rear window that could be lowered for ventilation, a feature introduced in a production car by Mercury in 1957 and still in production in 1966.

The Request was based on the 1955 Four Hundred hardtop, but featured a classic upright Packard fluted grille reminiscent of the prewar models. In addition, the 1957 engineering mule &quot;Black Bess&quot; was built to test new features for a future car. This car had a resemblance to the 1958 Edsel. It featured Packard&#x27;s return to a vertical grill. This grill was very narrow with the familiar ox-yoke shape that was characteristic for Packard, and with front fenders with dual headlights resembling Chrysler products from that era. The engineering mule Black Bess was destroyed by the company shortly after the Packard plant was shuttered. Of the 10 Requests built, only four were sold off the showroom floor.

Dick Teague also designed the last Packard show car, the Predictor. This hardtop coupe&#x27;s design followed the lines of the planned 1957 cars. It had many unusual features, among them a roof section that opened either by opening a door or activating a switch, well ahead of later T-tops. The car had seats that rotated out, allowing the passenger easy access, a feature later used on some Chrysler and GM products. The Predictor also had the opera windows, or portholes, found on concurrent Thunderbirds. Other novel ideas were overhead switches—these were in the production Avanti—and a dash design that followed the hood profile, centering dials in the center console area. This feature has only recently been used on production cars. The Predictor survives and is on display at the Studebaker National Museum section of the Center for History in South Bend, Indiana.

====Astral====
One unusual prototype, the Studebaker-Packard Astral, was made in 1957 and first unveiled at the South Bend Art Centre on January 12, 1958, and then at the March 1958 Geneva Motor Show. It had a single gyroscopic balanced wheel and the publicity data suggested it could be nuclear powered or have what the designers described as an ionic engine. No working prototype was ever made, nor was it likely that one was ever intended.

The Astral was designed by Edward E. Herrmann, Studebaker-Packard&#x27;s director of interior design, as a project to give his team experience in working with glass-reinforced plastic. It was shown at Studebaker dealerships before being put into storage. Rediscovered 30 years later, the car was restored and put on display by the Studebaker museum.

===The end===
Studebaker-Packard retired the Packard marque in 1959. In 1962, &quot;Packard&quot; was dropped off the corporation&#x27;s name at a time when it was introducing the all-new Avanti. The Packard name had been considered for the Avanti, but a less anachronistic image was being sought for the new model. Thus the Packard name ceased to exist in the American auto industry.

In the late 1950s, Studebaker-Packard was approached by enthusiasts to rebadge the French car maker Facel Vega&#x27;s Excellence four-door hardtop as a Packard for sale in North America, using stock Packard V8s and identifying trim including red hexagonal wheel covers, cormorant hood ornament, and classic vertical ox-yoke grille. The proposition was rejected when Daimler-Benz threatened to pull out of its 1957 marketing and distribution agreement, which would have cost Studebaker-Packard more in revenue than they could have made from the badge-engineered Packard. Daimler-Benz had little of its own dealer network at the time and used this agreement to enter and become more established in the American market through SPC&#x27;s dealer network, and felt this car was a threat to their models.

===Aborted revival===
In the late 1990s, Roy Gullickson revived the Packard nameplate by buying the naming rights and logo and developing a Packard Twelve for the 1999 model year. His goal was an annual production of 2,000 cars, but a lack of investment funds stalled that plan indefinitely. The only prototype Twelve made was sold at an auto auction in Plymouth, MI, in July 2014 for $143,000.

==Packard engines==

===Automobile===
Packard&#x27;s engineering staff designed and built excellent, reliable engines. Packard offered a 12-cylinder engine—the &quot;Twin Six&quot;—as well as a low-compression straight-eight, but never a 16-cylinder engine. After WWII, Packard continued with their successful straight-eight-cylinder flathead engines. While as fast as the new GM and Chrysler OHV V8s, they were perceived as obsolete by buyers. By waiting until 1955, Packard was almost the last U.S. automaker to introduce a high-compression V8 engine. The design was physically large and entirely conventional, copying many of the first-generation Cadillac, Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Studebaker Kettering features. It was produced in and displacements. The Caribbean version had two four-barrel carburetors and produced . For 1956, a version was used in the Senior cars and the Caribbean two four-barrels produced .

===Other Packard engines===

Packard also made large aeronautical and marine engines. Chief engineer Jesse G. Vincent developed a V12 airplane engine called the &quot;Liberty engine&quot; that was used widely in Entente air corps during World War I. After the war the Liberty was adapted for marine use, becoming a multiple world record setter under inventor and boating pioneer Gar Wood from the late 1910s through the 1930s.

In the interbellum, Packard built one of the world&#x27;s first diesel aviation engines, the 225-hp DR-980 radial. It powered the Stinson SM-8D, among others. It also powered a Bellanca CH-300 on a record endurance flight of over 84 hours, a mark that stood for more than 50 years. Other Packard-powered airplanes set several records during the 1920s.

During WWII, Packard license-built Rolls-Royce Merlin engines under the Packard V-1650 designation, used with great success in the famed P-51 Mustang fighter. A marine version of the successor to the V12 Liberty was adapted in three versions – M3-2500, M4-2500, and M5-2500 – to power the war&#x27;s iconic PT boats.

After WWII, Packard produced a new line of flathead design six (model 1M-245) and eight (model 1M-356) cylinder marine engines based on the automobile versions and the experience gained from the war production. Of the 1M-245 type engines, only 1,865 were produced between Spring 1947 and January 1951, with only a handful of survivors. Of the 1M-356 type engines, approximately 1,525 were produced between 1947 and 1950. Even more rare is the experimental &quot;R&quot; type racing versions (1M-245 &quot;R&quot;), of which only 10 were produced with currently only one known survivor, a 1M-245 R six-cylinder engine powering today a 1936 Gar Wood Speedster.

Packard also developed two turbine aircraft engines for the US Air Force, the XJ41 and XJ49. This was one reason for the Curtiss-Wright take-over in 1956, Packard wanted to sell their own jet.

==Advertisements==
The Packard advertising song on television had the words:
&lt;poem&gt;Ride ride ride ride ride along
in your Packard, in your Packard.
In a Packard you&#x27;ve got the world on a string.
In a Packard car you feel like a king.
Ride ride ride ride ride along
in your Packard, what fun!
And ask the man, just ask the man
the lucky man who owns one!&lt;/poem&gt;

==Legacy==
The electrical connectors developed by Packard were used extensively by General Motors in its automobiles. The first series of connectors was the Packard 56, followed by the Weather Pack, and finally, the Metri Pack, which are still in use. The former Packard Electric division of GM was later spun off as the Delphi Corporation, later renamed to Aptiv.

The National Packard Museum located in Warren, Ohio is the official museum of both the original Packard Motor Car Company and The Packard Electric Company. Its purpose is to preserve the Packard legacy and recognize Packard&#x27;s influence in transportation and industrial history through interaction with the community and outreach programs.

America&#x27;s Packard Museum holds a collection of Packard cars on display.

Packard Proving Grounds located in Shelby Township, MI are the remnants of the former proving Grounds owned by The Packard Motor Car Foundation. The mission of the Packard Proving Grounds Historic Site is to preserve the legacy of the Packard Motor Car Company through the restoration and preservation of the Packard Proving Grounds.

The Fort Lauderdale Antique Car Museum was closed after the COVID-19 pandemic and its entire collection of Packard cars and memorabilia was purchased by a local businessman. The collection was auctioned off in 2021.

Crushing around 50 vintage Packards occurred in 1977 in southern California and was dubbed by the Special-Interest auto magazine as &quot;Crushathon&quot;. The cars were the property of a Packard collector and auctioned after his death. Due to different disagreements in the terms of the auction between SoCal Packard fan clubs, roughly half of the cars auctioned off did not meet the listed price leading to the cars being ultimately destroyed, despite their purportedly good mechanical and rust-free condition.

<doc id="177359" wikidata="Q381007" url="?curid=177359" title="René Lévesque">
<text>René Lévesque ( ; August 24, 1922 – November 1, 1987) was a Canadian politician and journalist who served as the 23rd premier of Quebec from 1976 to 1985. He was the first Québécois political leader since Confederation to seek, through a referendum, a mandate to negotiate the political independence of Quebec. Starting his career as a reporter, and radio and television host, he later became known for his eminent role in Quebec&#x27;s nationalization of hydro-electric companies and as an ardent defender of Quebec sovereignty. He was the founder of the Parti Québécois, and before that, a Liberal minister in the Lesage government from 1960 to 1966.

==Early life==
Lévesque was born in the Hôtel Dieu Hospital in Campbellton, New Brunswick, on August 24, 1922. He was raised in New Carlisle, Quebec, on the Gaspé Peninsula, by his parents, Diane (née Dionne) and Dominic Lévesque, a lawyer. He had three siblings, André, Fernand and Alice. His father died when Lévesque was 14 years old.

==Journalist==

Lévesque attended the Séminaire de Gaspé and the Saint-Charles-Garnier College in Quebec City, both of which were run by the Jesuits. He studied for a law degree at Université Laval in Quebec City, but left the university in 1943 without having completed the degree. One of his classmates at Laval later recounted that Lévesque had been smoking in class, and refused to apologize to the professor, Louis-Philippe Pigeon, who refused to allow him back to class. Lévesque left, saying he really only wanted to write, not practise law. He worked as an announcer and news writer at the radio station CHNC in New Carlisle, as a substitute announcer for CHRC during 1941 and 1942, and then at CBV in Quebec City.

During 1944–1945, he served as a liaison officer and war correspondent for the U.S. Army in Europe. He reported from London while it was under regular bombardment by the Luftwaffe, and advanced with the Allied troops as they pushed back the German army through France and Germany. Throughout the war, he made regular journalistic reports on the airwaves and in print. He was with the first unit of Americans to reach Dachau concentration camp.

In 1947, he married Louise L&#x27;Heureux, with whom he had two sons and a daughter. Lévesque worked as a reporter for the CBC&#x27;s French language section in the international service. He again served as a war correspondent for the CBC in the Korean War in 1952. After that, he was offered a career in journalism in the United States, but decided to stay in Canada.
From 1956 to 1959, Lévesque became famous in Quebec for hosting a weekly television news program on Radio-Canada called &quot;Point de Mire&quot;.

Lévesque covered international events and major labour struggles between workers and corporations that dogged the Union Nationale government of Premier Maurice Duplessis culminating with a great strike in 1957 at the Gaspé Copper Mine in Murdochville. The Murdochville strike was a milestone for organized labour in Quebec as it resulted in changes to the province&#x27;s labour laws.

While working for the public television network, he became personally involved in the broadcasters&#x27; strike that lasted 68 tumultuous days beginning in late 1958. Lévesque was arrested during a demonstration in 1959, along with union leader Jean Marchand and 24 other demonstrators.

==Early political career==
===Libéral cabinet minister ===

In 1960, Lévesque entered politics as a star candidate and was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Quebec in the 1960 election as a Liberal Party member in the riding of Montréal-Laurier. In the government of Jean Lesage, he served as minister of hydroelectric resources and public works from 1960 to 1961, and minister of natural resources from 1961 to 1965. While in office, he played a pivotal role in the nationalization of hydroelectric companies, greatly expanding Hydro-Québec, one of the reforms that was part of the Quiet Revolution.

From 1965 to 1966, he served as minister of family and welfare. Lévesque, with his friend Eric Kierans, the Quebec minister of health, was heavily involved in negotiations with the Government of Canada to fund both Quebec and federal mandates for social programs.

In a surprise, the Liberals lost the 1966 election to the Union Nationale but Lévesque retained his own seat of Laurier. Believing that the Canadian federation was doomed to fail, Lévesque began to openly champion separation from Canada as part of the Liberal platform at the upcoming party conference. Kierans, who had been elected party president, led the movement against the motion, with future premier Robert Bourassa attempting to mediate the dispute before siding with Kierans. The resolution was handily defeated, and Lévesque walked out with his followers.

===Founding of the Parti Québécois===
After leaving the Liberal Party, he founded the Mouvement Souveraineté-Association (MSA). In contrast to more militant nationalist movements, such as Pierre Bourgault&#x27;s Rassemblement pour l&#x27;Indépendance Nationale (RIN), the party eschewed direct action and protest and attempted instead to appeal to the broader electorate, whom Lévesque called &quot;normal people&quot;. The main contention in the first party conference was the proposed policy toward Quebec&#x27;s Anglophone minority; Lévesque faced down heavy opposition to his insistence that English schools and language rights be protected.

The election of hardline federalist Pierre Elliott Trudeau as Prime Minister, and the politically damaging riot instigated by the RIN when he appeared at the St. Jean Baptiste Day parade of 1968, led to the sovereignty movement coming together. The MSA merged with another party in the Quebec sovereignty movement, the Ralliement National of Gilles Grégoire, to create the Parti Québécois (PQ) in 1968. At Lévesque&#x27;s insistence, RIN members were permitted to join but not accepted as a group.

The Parti Québécois gained 25 per cent of the vote in the 1970 election, running on a platform of declaring independence if government was formed. The PQ only won six seats, and Lévesque continued to run the party from Montreal by communicating with the caucus in Quebec City.

The 1973 election saw a large Liberal victory, and created major tensions within the party, especially after Lévesque was unable to gain a seat. A quarrel with House Leader Robert Burns almost ended Lévesque&#x27;s leadership shortly thereafter.

==Premier of Quebec (1976–1985)==
Lévesque and his party won a landslide victory at the 1976 election, with Lévesque finally re-entering the Assembly as the member for Taillon in downtown Longueuil. His party assumed power with 41.1 per cent of the popular vote and 71 seats out of 110, and even managed to unseat Bourassa in his own riding. Lévesque became premier of Quebec ten days later. The night of Lévesque&#x27;s acceptance speech included one of his most famous quotations: &quot;I never thought that I could be so proud to be Québécois.&quot;

===French language===

His government&#x27;s signature achievement was the Quebec &quot;Charter of the French Language&quot; (introduced in the legislature and still colloquially known as Bill 101), whose stated goal was to make French &quot;the normal and everyday language of work, instruction, communication, commerce and business&quot;. In its first enactment, it reserved access to English-language public schools to children whose parents had attended English school in Quebec. All other children were required to attend French schools in order to encourage immigrants to integrate themselves into the majority francophone culture (Lévesque was more moderate on language than some of the PQ, including the language minister, Camille Laurin. He would have resigned as leader rather than eliminate English-language public schools, as some party members proposed). Bill 101 also made it illegal for businesses to put up exterior commercial signs in a language other than French at a time when English dominated as a commercial and business language in Quebec.

===Quebec nationalism===

Lévesque was disappointed with the cold response by the American economic elite to his first speech in New York City as Premier of Quebec, in which he compared Quebec&#x27;s march towards sovereignty to the American Revolution. His first speech in France was, however, more successful, leading him to a better appreciation of the French intelligentsia and of French culture.

On May 20, 1980, the PQ held, as promised before the elections, the 1980 Quebec referendum on its sovereignty-association plan. The result of the vote was 40 per cent in favour and 60 per cent opposed (with 86 per cent turnout). Lévesque conceded defeat in the referendum by announcing that, as he had understood the verdict, he had been told &quot;until next time&quot;.

Lévesque led the PQ to victory in the 1981 election, increasing the party&#x27;s majority in the National Assembly and increasing its share of the popular vote from 41 to 49 per cent.

A major focus of his second mandate was the patriation of the Canadian constitution. Lévesque was criticized by some in Quebec who said he had been tricked by Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and the English-Canadian provincial premiers. To this day, no Quebec premier of any political side has endorsed the 1982 constitutional amendment.

===Other policies and events===

On February 6, 1977, Lévesque accidentally killed Edgar Trottier, a homeless man who had been lying on the road, while driving his car. Trottier had in the past repeatedly used the maneuver to secure a hospital bed for the night. Police officers at the scene did not administer the breathalyzer test to Lévesque, because they did not suspect that he was impaired. Lévesque was later fined $25 for failing to wear his glasses while driving a car on the night in question. The incident gained further notoriety when it was revealed that the female companion in the vehicle was not his wife, but his longtime secretary, Corinne Côté. Lévesque&#x27;s marriage ended in divorce soon thereafter (the couple had already been estranged for some time), and in April 1979, he married Côté.

Lévesque&#x27;s government completed the nationalization of hydroelectricity through Hydro-Québec. He also created the Quebec &quot;Charter of the French Language&quot;, the political party financing law, and the Parti Québécois itself. His government was the first in Canada to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in the province&#x27;s &quot;Charte des droits de la personne&quot; in 1977. He also continued the work of the Lesage government in improving social services, in which social needs were taken care of by the state, instead of the Catholic Church (as in the Duplessis era) or the individual. Lévesque is still regarded by many as a symbol of democracy and tolerance.

The PQ government&#x27;s response to the recession of the early 1980s by cutting the provincial budget to reduce growing deficits that resulted from the recession angered labour union members, a core part of the constituency of the PQ and the sovereignty movement.

Lévesque&#x27;s &quot;Act to govern the financing of political parties&quot; banned corporate donations and limited individual contributions to political parties to $3,000. This key legislation was meant to prevent wealthy citizens and organizations from having a disproportionate influence on the electoral process. A &quot;Referendum Act&quot; was passed to allow for a province-wide vote on issues presented in a referendum, giving a &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; side equal funding and legal footing.

===Resignation===

Lévesque had argued that the party should not make sovereignty the object of the 1985 election and instead opt for the &quot;Beau risque&quot; strategy of seeking an understanding with the federal government of Brian Mulroney, which angered the strongest supporters of sovereignty within the party. He said the issue in the upcoming election would not be sovereignty. Instead, he expressed hope, &quot;that we can finally find government leaders in Ottawa who will discuss Québec&#x27;s demands seriously and work with us for the greater good of Québecers&quot;. His new stance weakened his position within the party. Some senior members resigned; there were by-election defeats. Lévesque resigned as leader of the Parti Québécois on June 20, 1985, and as premier of Québec on October 3, 1985.

==Retirement and death==

Lévesque, a constant smoker, was hosting a dinner party in his Nuns&#x27; Island (Montreal) apartment on the evening of November 1, 1987, when he experienced chest pains; he died of a heart attack that night at Montreal General Hospital. A brief resurgence of separatist sentiment followed. Over 100,000 viewed his body lying in state in Montreal and Quebec City, over 10,000 went to his funeral in the latter city, and hundreds wept daily at his grave for months.

Lévesque was made a grand officer of the French Legion of Honour. He was posthumously made a grand officer of the National Order of Quebec in 2008.

==Legacy==
His state funeral and funeral procession were reportedly attended by 100,000 Québécois. During the carrying out of his coffin from the church, the crowd spontaneously began to applaud and sing Quebec&#x27;s unofficial national anthem &quot;Gens du pays&quot;, replacing the first verse with &quot;Mon cher René&quot; (&quot;My dear René&quot;), as is the custom when this song is adapted to celebrate someone&#x27;s birthday. Two major boulevards now bear his name, one in Montreal and one in Quebec City. In Montreal, the Édifice Hydro-Québec and the Maison Radio-Canada are both located on René Lévesque Boulevard, fittingly as Lévesque once worked for Hydro-Québec and the CBC, respectively. On June 22, 2010, Hydro-Québec and the government of Quebec commemorated Lévesque&#x27;s role in Quebec&#x27;s Quiet Revolution and his tenure as premier by renaming the 1244-megawatt Manic-3 generating station in his honour.

On June 3, 1999, a monument in his honour was unveiled on boulevard René-Lévesque outside the Parliament Building in Quebec City. The statue is popular with tourists, who snuggle up to it, to have their pictures taken &quot;avec René&quot; (with René), despite repeated attempts by officials to keep people from touching the monument or getting too close to it. The statue had been the source of an improvised, comical and affectionately touching tribute to Lévesque. The fingers of his extended right hand are slightly parted, just enough so that tourists and the faithful could insert a cigarette, giving the statue an unusually realistic appearance.

This practice is less often seen now, however, as the statue was moved to New Carlisle and replaced by a similar, but bigger one. This change resulted from considerable controversy. Some believed that the life-sized statue was not appropriate for conveying his importance in the history of Quebec. Others noted that a trademark of Lévesque was his relatively small stature.

Lévesque today remains an important figure of the Quebec nationalist movement, and is considered sovereigntism&#x27;s spiritual father. After his death, even people in disagreement with some of those convictions now generally recognize his importance to the history of Quebec. Many in Quebec regard him as the father of the modern Quebec nation. According to a study made in 2006 by &quot;Le Journal de Montréal&quot; and Léger Marketing, Lévesque was considered by far, according to Québécois, the best premier to run the province over the last 50 years.

Lévesque was notably portrayed in 1994 in the television series &quot;René Lévesque&quot;. In 2006, an additional television miniseries, &quot;René Lévesque&quot;, was aired on the CBC. He was also portrayed in an episode of &quot;Kevin Spencer&quot;, a Canadian cartoon show. In it, his ghost attempted a camaraderie with Kevin because of their similarities in political beliefs, as well as the fact that the title character, like René&#x27;s ghost, claims to smoke &quot;five packs a day&quot;.

A song by Les Cowboys Fringants named &quot;Lettre à Lévesque&quot; on the album &quot;La Grand-Messe&quot; was dedicated to him. They also mention the street bearing his name in the song &quot;La Manifestation&quot;.

He was the co-subject, along with Pierre Trudeau, of the Donald Brittain-directed documentary miniseries &quot;The Champions&quot;.

==Personality==
Lévesque was a man capable of great tact and charm, but who could also be abrupt and choleric when defending beliefs, ideals, or morals essential to him, or when lack of respect was perceived, for example, when he was famously snubbed by François Mitterrand at their first meeting. He was also a proud &quot;Gaspésien&quot; (hailing from the Gaspé Peninsula), and had hints of the local accent.

Considered a major defender of the Québécois, Lévesque was, before the 1960s, more interested in international affairs than Quebec matters. The popular image of Lévesque was his ever-present cigarette and his small physical stature, as well as his comb over that earned him the nickname of Ti-Poil, literally, &quot;Lil&#x27; Hair&quot;, but more accurately translated as &quot;Baldy&quot;. Lévesque was a passionate and emotional public speaker. Those close to Lévesque have described him as having difficulty expressing his emotions in private, saying that he was more comfortable in front of a crowd of thousands than with one person.

While many Quebec intellectuals are inspired by French philosophy and high culture, Lévesque favoured the United States. Speaking fluent English, he was a faithful reader of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and took his vacations in New England every year. He also stated that, if there had to be one role model for him, it would be US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. While in London during the Second World War, his admiration for Britons grew when he witnessed their courage in the face of the German bombardments.

<text>Elizabeth Bishop (February 8, 1911 – October 6, 1979) was an American poet and short-story writer. She was Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress from 1949 to 1950, the Pulitzer Prize winner for Poetry in 1956, the National Book Award winner in 1970, and the recipient of the Neustadt International Prize for Literature in 1976. Dwight Garner argued in 2018 that she was perhaps &quot;the most purely gifted poet of the 20th century&quot;. She was also a painter, and her poetry is noted for its careful attention to detail; Ernest Hilbert wrote “Bishop’s poetics is one distinguished by tranquil observation, craft-like accuracy, care for the small things of the world, a miniaturist’s discretion and attention.&quot;

==Early life==
Bishop, an only child, was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, to William Thomas and Gertrude May (Bulmer) Bishop. After her father, a successful builder, died when she was eight months old, Bishop&#x27;s mother became mentally ill and was institutionalized in 1916. (Bishop would later write about the time of her mother&#x27;s struggles in her short story &quot;In the Village&quot;.) Effectively orphaned during early childhood, she lived with her maternal grandparents on a farm in Great Village, Nova Scotia, a period she referred to in her writing. Bishop&#x27;s mother remained in an asylum until her death in 1934, and the two were never reunited.

Later in childhood, Bishop&#x27;s paternal family gained custody. She was removed from the care of her grandparents and moved in with her father&#x27;s wealthier family in Worcester, Massachusetts. However, Bishop was unhappy there, and her separation from her maternal grandparents made her lonely. 

While she was living in Worcester, she developed chronic asthma, from which she suffered for the rest of her life. Her time in Worcester is briefly chronicled in her poem &quot;In the Waiting Room&quot;. In 1918, her grandparents, realizing that Bishop was unhappy living with them, sent her to live with her mother&#x27;s eldest sister, Maude Bulmer Shepherdson, and her husband George. 

The Bishops paid Maude to house and educate their granddaughter. The Shepherdsons lived in a tenement in an impoverished Revere, Massachusetts, neighborhood populated mostly by Irish and Italian immigrants. The family later moved to better circumstances in Cliftondale, Massachusetts. It was Bishop&#x27;s aunt who introduced her to the works of Victorian writers, including Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Thomas Carlyle, Robert Browning, and Elizabeth Barrett Browning.

Bishop was very ill as a child and, as a result, received very little formal schooling until she attended Saugus High School for her freshman year. She was accepted to the Walnut Hill School in Natick, Massachusetts, for her sophomore year but was behind on her vaccinations and not allowed to attend. Instead she spent the year at the Shore Country Day School in Beverly, Massachusetts. Bishop then boarded at the Walnut Hill School, where she studied music. At Shore Country Day, her first poems were published in a student magazine by her friend Frani Blough. 

Bishop entered Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York, in the autumn of 1929, planning to study music in order to become a composer. She gave up music because of her terror of performing, and switched her major to English, taking courses in 16th- and 17th-century literature. Bishop published her work in her senior year in &quot;The Magazine&quot;, a California publication. 

In 1933, she co-founded &quot;Con Spirito&quot;, a rebel literary magazine at Vassar, with writer Mary McCarthy, Margaret Miller, and the sisters Eunice and Eleanor Clark. Bishop graduated from Vassar with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1934.

==Influences==

Bishop was greatly influenced by the poet Marianne Moore, to whom she was introduced by a librarian at Vassar in 1934. Moore took a keen interest in Bishop&#x27;s work and, at one point, Moore dissuaded Bishop from attending Cornell Medical School, where Bishop had briefly enrolled after moving to New York City following her Vassar graduation. Regarding Moore&#x27;s influence on Bishop&#x27;s writing, Bishop&#x27;s friend and Vassar peer, the writer Mary McCarthy stated, &quot;Certainly between Bishop and Marianne Moore there are resemblances: the sort of close microscopic inspection of certain parts of experience. [However,] I think there is something a bit too demure about Marianne Moore, and there&#x27;s nothing demure about Elizabeth Bishop.&quot; Moore helped Bishop first publish some of her poems in an anthology called &quot;Trial Balances&quot; in which established poets introduced the work of unknown, younger poets.

It was four years before Bishop addressed &quot;Dear Miss Moore&quot; as &quot;Dear Marianne&quot; and only then at the elder poet&#x27;s invitation. The friendship between the two women, memorialized by an extensive correspondence, endured until Moore&#x27;s death in 1972. Bishop&#x27;s &quot;At the Fishhouses&quot; (1955) contains allusions on several levels to Moore&#x27;s 1924 poem &quot;A Grave&quot;.

She was introduced to Robert Lowell by Randall Jarrell in 1947, and they became great friends, mostly through their written correspondence, until Lowell&#x27;s death in 1977. After his death, she wrote, &quot;our friendship, [which was] often kept alive through years of separation only by letters, remained constant and affectionate, and I shall always be deeply grateful for it.&quot; They also influenced each other&#x27;s poetry. Lowell cited Bishop&#x27;s influence on his poem &quot;Skunk Hour&quot; which he said, &quot;[was] modeled on Miss Bishop&#x27;s &#x27;The Armadillo&#x27;.&quot; Also, his poem &quot;The Scream&quot; is &quot;derived from ... Bishop&#x27;s story &#x27;In the Village&#x27;.&quot; &quot;North Haven&quot;, one of the last of her poems published during her lifetime, was written in memory of Lowell in 1978.

==Travels==
Bishop had an independent income from early adulthood, as a result of an inheritance from her deceased father, that did not run out until near the end of her life. This income allowed her to travel widely, though cheaply, without worrying about employment, and to live in many cities and countries, which are described in her poems. She wrote frequently about her love of travel in poems like &quot;Questions of Travel&quot; and &quot;Over 2000 Illustrations and a Complete Concordance&quot;. She lived in France for several years in the mid-1930s with a friend from Vassar, Louise Crane, who was a paper-manufacturing heiress.
In 1938, the two of them purchased a house at 624 White Street in Key West, Florida. While living there Bishop made the acquaintance of Pauline Pfeiffer Hemingway, who had divorced Ernest Hemingway in 1940.

She later lived in an apartment at 611 Frances Street.
From 1949 to 1950, she was the Consultant in Poetry for the Library of Congress, and lived at Bertha Looker&#x27;s Boardinghouse, 1312 30th Street Northwest, Washington, D.C., in Georgetown.

Upon receiving a substantial ($2,500) traveling fellowship from Bryn Mawr College in 1951, Bishop set off to circumnavigate South America. Arriving in Santos, Brazil, in November of that year, Bishop expected to stay two weeks but stayed 15 years. She lived in Petrópolis with architect Lota (Maria Carlota) de Macedo Soares, who was descended from a prominent and notable political family. Although Bishop was not forthcoming about details of her romance with Soares, much of their relationship was documented in Bishop&#x27;s extensive correspondence with Samuel Ashley Brown. In its later years the relationship deteriorated, becoming volatile and tempestuous, marked by bouts of depression, tantrums and alcoholism. The relationship is depicted in the 2013 film &quot;Reaching for the Moon&quot;.
During her time in Brazil, Bishop became increasingly interested in the literature of the country. She was influenced by Brazilian poets, including João Cabral de Melo Neto and Carlos Drummond de Andrade, and translated their work into English. Regarding Andrade, she said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t know him at all. He&#x27;s supposed to be very shy. I&#x27;m supposed to be very shy. We&#x27;ve met once—on the sidewalk at night. We had just come out of the same restaurant, and he kissed my hand politely when we were introduced.&quot; After Soares took her own life in 1967, Bishop spent more time in the United States.

==Publication history and awards==

For a major American poet, Bishop published very sparingly. Her first book, &quot;North &amp; South&quot;, was first published in 1946 and won the Houghton Mifflin Prize for poetry. This book included important poems like &quot;The Man-Moth&quot; (which describes a dark and lonely fictional creature inspired by what Bishop noted was &quot;[a] newspaper misprint for &#x27;mammoth&#x27;&quot;) and &quot;The Fish&quot; (in which Bishop describes a caught fish in exacting detail). But she did not publish a follow-up until nine years later. That volume, titled &quot;&quot;, first published in 1955, included her first book, plus the 18 new poems that constituted the new &quot;Cold Spring&quot; section. Bishop won the Pulitzer Prize for this book in 1956.

Then there was another long wait before her next volume, &quot;Questions of Travel&quot;, in 1965. This book showed the influence that living in Brazil had had on Bishop&#x27;s writing. It included poems in the book&#x27;s first section that were explicitly about life in Brazil including &quot;Arrival at Santos&quot;, &quot;Manuelzinho&quot;, and &quot;The Riverman&quot;. But in the second section of the volume Bishop also included pieces set in other locations like &quot;In the Village&quot; and &quot;First Death in Nova Scotia&quot;, which take place in her native country. &quot;Questions of Travel&quot; was her first book to include one of her short stories (the aforementioned &quot;In the Village&quot;).

Bishop&#x27;s next major publication was &quot;The Complete Poems&quot; (1969), which included eight new poems and won a National Book Award. The last new book of poems to appear in her lifetime, &quot;Geography III&quot; (1977) included frequently anthologized poems like &quot;In the Waiting Room&quot; and &quot;One Art&quot;. This book led to Bishop&#x27;s being the first American and the first woman to be awarded the Neustadt International Prize for Literature.

Bishop&#x27;s &quot;The Complete Poems, 1927–1979&quot; was published posthumously in 1983. Other posthumous publications included &quot;The Collected Prose&quot; (1984; a compilation of her essays and short stories) and &quot;Edgar Allan Poe &amp; the Juke-box: Uncollected Poems, Drafts, and Fragments&quot; (2006), whose publication aroused some controversy. Meghan O&#x27;Rourke notes in an article from &quot;Slate&quot; magazine, It&#x27;s no wonder ... that the recent publication of Bishop&#x27;s hitherto uncollected poems, drafts, and fragments ... encountered fierce resistance, and some debate about the value of making this work available to the public. In an outraged piece for &quot;The New Republic&quot;, Helen Vendler labeled the drafts &quot;maimed and stunted&quot; and rebuked Farrar, Straus and Giroux for choosing to publish the volume.

==Literary style and identity==
Where some of her notable contemporaries like Robert Lowell and John Berryman made the intimate details of their personal lives an important part of their poetry, Bishop avoided this practice altogether. In contrast to this confessional style involving large amounts of self-exposure, Bishop&#x27;s style of writing, though it did include a small amount of material from her personal life, was known for its highly detailed, objective, and distant point of view, and for its reticence on the kinds of personal subject matter that the work of her contemporaries involved. She used discretion when writing about details and people from her life. &quot;In the Village&quot;, a piece about her childhood and her mentally unstable mother, is written as a third-person narrative; the reader would only know of the story&#x27;s autobiographical origins by knowing about Bishop&#x27;s childhood.

Bishop did not see herself as a &quot;lesbian poet&quot; or as a &quot;female poet&quot;. Because she refused to have her work published in all-female poetry anthologies, other female poets involved with the women&#x27;s movement thought she was hostile towards the movement. For instance, a student at Harvard who was close to Bishop in the 60s, Kathleen Spivack, wrote in her memoir, I think Bishop internalized the misogyny of the time. How could she not? ... Bishop had a very ambivalent relation to being a woman plus poet—plus lesbian—in the Boston/Cambridge/Harvard nexus ... Extremely vulnerable, sensitive, she hid much of her private life. She wanted nothing to do with anything that seemed to involve the women&#x27;s movement. She internalized many of the male attitudes of the day toward women, who were supposed to be attractive, appealing to men, and not ask for equal pay or a job with benefits. However, this was not necessarily how Bishop viewed herself. In an interview with &quot;The Paris Review&quot; from 1978, she said that, despite her insistence on being excluded from female poetry anthologies, she still considered herself to be &quot;a strong feminist&quot; but that she only wanted to be judged based on the quality of her writing and not on her gender or sexual orientation.

Although generally supportive of the &quot;confessional&quot; style of her friend, Robert Lowell, she drew the line at his highly controversial book &quot;The Dolphin&quot; (1973), in which he used and altered private letters from his ex-wife, Elizabeth Hardwick (whom he divorced after 23 years of marriage), as material for his poems. In a letter to Lowell, dated March 21, 1972, Bishop strongly urged him against publishing the book: &quot;One can use one&#x27;s life as material [for poems]—one does anyway—but these letters—aren&#x27;t you violating a trust? IF you were given permission—IF you hadn&#x27;t changed them... etc. But &quot;art just isn&#x27;t worth that much&quot;.&quot;

===&quot;In the Waiting Room&quot;===
Bishop&#x27;s &quot;In the Waiting Room&quot;, written in 1976, addressed the chase for identity and individuality within a diverse society as a seven-year-old girl living in Worcester, Massachusetts, during World War I.

===&quot;First Death in Nova Scotia&quot;===

Bishop&#x27;s poem &quot;First Death in Nova Scotia&quot;, first published in 1965, describes her first encounter with death when her cousin Arthur died. In this poem, her experience of that event is through a child&#x27;s point of view. The poem highlights that although young and naive the child has some instinctive awareness of the severe impact of death. She combines reality and imagination, a technique also used in her poem &quot;Sestina&quot;.

=== &quot;Sestina&quot; ===
Bishop&#x27;s poem &quot;Sestina&quot;, published in 1956 in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, depicts a real-life experience. After her father&#x27;s death when she was a baby and following her mother&#x27;s nervous breakdown when she was five, Bishop&#x27;s poem notes her experience after she has gone to live with relatives. The poem is about her living with the knowledge that she would not see her mother again. Bishop writes, &quot;Time to plant tears, says the almanac. / The grandmother sings to the marvelous stove / and the child draws another inscrutable house.&quot; The style of her poem, the sestina, is a poetry style created by Arnaut Daniel in the 12th century, focused on the emphases of ending words in each line, giving the poem a sense of form and pattern. Bishop is widely known for her skill in the sestina format.

==Later life==
Bishop lectured in higher education for a number of years starting in the 1970s when her inheritance began to run out. For a short time she taught at the University of Washington, before teaching at Harvard University for seven years. She spent several summers near the end of her life on the island of North Haven, Maine. She taught at New York University, before finishing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She commented, &quot;I don&#x27;t think I believe in writing courses at all, it&#x27;s true, children sometimes write wonderful things, paint wonderful pictures, but I think they should be discouraged.&quot;
In 1971 Bishop began a relationship with Alice Methfessel, who became her literary executor. Never a prolific writer, Bishop noted that she would begin many projects and leave them unfinished. Two years after publishing her last book, &quot;Geography III&quot; (1977), she died of a cerebral aneurysm in her apartment at Lewis Wharf, Boston, and is buried in Hope Cemetery (Worcester, Massachusetts). Her requested epitaph, the last two lines from her poem &quot;The Bight&quot; — &quot;All the untidy activity continues, / awful but cheerful&quot; — was added, along with her inscription, to the family monument in 1997, on the occasion of the Elizabeth Bishop Conference and Poetry Festival in Worcester.

After her death, the Elizabeth Bishop House, an artists&#x27; retreat in Great Village, Nova Scotia, was dedicated to her memory. Vassar College Library acquired her literary and personal papers in 1981. Her personal correspondence and manuscripts appear in numerous other literary collections in American research libraries.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Reaching for the Moon&quot; (2013) is a Brazilian movie about Bishop&#x27;s life when she was living in Brazil with Lota de Macedo Soares. The Portuguese title of the film is &quot;Flores Raras&quot;.

Author Michael Sledge published the novel &quot;The More I Owe You&quot;, about Bishop and Soares, in 2010.

Bishop&#x27;s friendship with Robert Lowell was the subject of the play &quot;Dear Elizabeth&quot;, by Sarah Ruhl, which was first performed at the Yale Repertory Theater in 2012. The play was adapted from the two poets&#x27; letters which were collected in the book &quot;Words in Air: The Complete Correspondence Between Elizabeth Bishop and Robert Lowell&quot;.

In the television show &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;, episode 2.13, &quot;ABQ&quot;, Jane&#x27;s father enters her bedroom where there is a photograph of Elizabeth Bishop on the wall. Earlier, the father had told the police that Jane&#x27;s mother&#x27;s maiden name was Bishop.

<text>James Arlington Wright (December 13, 1927 – March 25, 1980) was an American poet.

==Life==
James Wright was born and spent his childhood in Martins Ferry, Ohio. His father worked in a glass factory, and his mother in a laundry. Neither parent had received more than an eighth grade education. Wright suffered a nervous breakdown in 1943, and he graduated a year late from high school, in 1946.

After graduating from high school, Wright enlisted in the U.S. Army and participated in the occupation of Japan. Following his discharge, he attended Kenyon College on the GI Bill, studied with John Crowe Ransom, and published poems in the Kenyon Review. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1952. That year, Wright married Liberty Kardules, another Martins Ferry native. Wright subsequently spent a year in Vienna on a Fulbright Fellowship, returning to the U.S. where he obtained a master&#x27;s and a Ph.D. at the University of Washington, studying with Theodore Roethke and Stanley Kunitz.
Wright first emerged on the literary scene in 1956 with &quot;The Green Wall&quot;, a collection of formalist verse that was awarded the prestigious Yale Younger Poets Prize. By the early 1960s, increasingly influenced by the Spanish language surrealists, Wright had dropped fixed meters. His transformation achieved its maximum expression with the publication of the seminal &quot;The Branch Will Not Break&quot; (1963), which positioned Wright as curious counterpoint to the Beats and New York School and aligned him more with emergent Midwestern neo-surrealist and deep image poetics.

This transformation had not come by accident, as Wright had been working for years with his friend Robert Bly, collaborating on the translation of world poets in the influential magazine &quot;The Fifties&quot; (later &quot;The Sixties&quot;). Such influences fertilized Wright&#x27;s unique perspective and helped put the Midwest back on the poetic map.

Wright had discovered a terse, imagistic, free verse of clarity, and power. During the next ten years Wright would go on to pen some of the most beloved and frequently anthologized masterpieces of the century, such as &quot;A Blessing,&quot; &quot;Autumn Begins in Martins Ferry, Ohio,&quot; and &quot;I Am a Sioux Indian Brave, He Said to Me in Minneapolis.&quot;

Wright&#x27;s son Franz Wright was also a poet; Franz won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 2004. Together, James and Franz are the only parent/child pair to have won a Pulitzer Prize in the same category.

Wright was a lifelong smoker, and was diagnosed in late 1979 with cancer of the tongue. He died a few months later in Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. His last book of new poems, &quot;This Journey&quot;, was published posthumously by Random House.

==Poetry==
Wright&#x27;s early poetry is relatively conventional in form and meter, especially compared with his later, looser poetry. Although most of his fame comes from his original poetry, Wright made a contribution to another area of literary modernism: the translation.

His work with translations of German and South American poets, as well as the poetry and aesthetic position of Robert Bly, had considerable influence on his own poems; this is most evident in &quot;The Branch Will Not Break&quot;, which departs radically from the formal style of Wright&#x27;s previous book, &quot;Saint Judas.&quot; In addition to his own poetry, he also published loose translations of René Char&#x27;s hermetic poems.

His poetry often deals with the disenfranchised, or the American outsider. Wright suffered from depression and bipolar mood disorders and also battled alcoholism his entire life. He experienced several nervous breakdowns, was hospitalized, and was subjected to electroshock therapy.

His dark moods and focus on emotional suffering were part of his life and often the focus of his poetry, although given the emotional turmoil he experienced personally, his poems can be optimistic in expressing a faith in life and human transcendence. In &quot;The Branch Will Not Break&quot;, the enduring human spirit becomes thematic. Nevertheless, the last line of his poem &quot;Lying in a Hammock at William Duffy&#x27;s Farm in Pine Island, Minnesota&quot; famously reads, &quot;I have wasted my life.&quot;

Technically, Wright was an innovator, especially in the use of his titles, first lines, and last lines, which he used to great dramatic effect in defense of the lives of the disenfranchised. He is equally well known for his tender depictions of the bleak landscapes of the post-industrial American Midwest.

==Influence and awards==
His 1972 &quot;Collected Poems&quot; won the Pulitzer Prize. In addition to his other awards, Wright received a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation. He corresponded with another Rockefeller grantee, Catholic nun, literary critic and poet M. Bernetta Quinn.

Since his death, Wright has developed a cult following, transforming him into a seminal writer of significant influence. Fellow Pulitzer prize for poetry winner Mary Oliver wrote &quot;Three Poems for James Wright&quot; upon his death, and hundreds of writers gathered annually for decades to pay tribute at the James Wright Poetry Festival held from 1981 through 2007 in Martins Ferry.

<doc id="177372" wikidata="Q2096452" url="?curid=177372" title="Piper PA-32 Cherokee Six">
<text>The Piper PA-32 Cherokee Six is a series of single-engine, fixed landing gear, light aircraft manufactured in the United States by Piper Aircraft between 1965 and 2007.

The PA-32 is used around the world for private transportation, air taxi services, bush support, and medevac flights.

==Development==
The PA-32 series was developed to meet a requirement for a larger aircraft than the four-seat Piper PA-28 Cherokee. The first prototype PA-32 made its initial flight on December 6, 1963, with the type being publicly announced in October 1964, with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) aircraft type certification following on March 4, 1965. The first production aircraft was the PA32-260 Cherokee Six, a significantly modified six-seat (or seven-seat) development of the PA-28 Cherokee.

The Cherokee Six and its successors feature a baggage compartment in the nose between the cockpit and the engine compartment and a large double door in the back for easy loading of passengers and cargo.

===PA-32-300===
On 27 May 1966, Piper obtained FAA type certification for a version, designated as the PA-32-300. It was offered by the company as a 1967 model.

===PA-32R===

The 1975 addition of retractable landing gear resulted in the first of the PA-32R series, the Piper Lance. This was the earliest aircraft in the Piper Saratoga family, Piper&#x27;s luxury, high-performance single line.

Piper&#x27;s transition to tapered wings for the Cherokee series resulted in a new wing for the PA-32 series, as well. The tapered-wing version of the Cherokee Six was named the Saratoga and debuted in 1980.

===Piper 6X===
After the &quot;General Aviation Revitalization Act&quot; of 1994, production of the retractable-gear Saratoga resumed in 1995. A fixed-gear PA-32 was reintroduced in 2003 as the Piper 6X and the turbocharged 6XT. Sales of the 6X and 6XT models did not meet expectations and production ceased in late 2007.

===PA-34 prototype===

Piper built a prototype PA-32-260 with IO-360 engines mounted on the wings. The trimotor aircraft was the proof-of-concept aircraft for the twin-engined, retractable-gear version of the Cherokee Six, the PA-34 Seneca.

<text>A Warhol worm is a computer worm that spreads as fast as physically possible, infecting all vulnerable machines on the entire Internet in 15 minutes or less. The term is based on the claim that &quot;in the future, everyone will have 15 minutes of fame&quot;, which has been misattributed to Andy Warhol. A 2002 paper presented at the 11th USENIX Security Symposium proposed designs for better worms, such as a &quot;flash worm&quot; that identifies a hit-list of vulnerable targets before attacking.

In 2003, SQL Slammer became the first observed example of a Warhol worm. The mechanism of SQL Slammer&#x27;s spread used a pseudo-random number generator seeded from a system variable to determine which IP addresses to attack next for a rapid, unpredictable spread.

According to an analysis of the SQL Slammer outbreak by the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA), its growth followed an exponential curve with a doubling time of 8.5 seconds in the early phases of the attack, which was only slowed by the collapse of many networks because of the denial of service attack caused by SQL Slammer&#x27;s traffic. 90% of all vulnerable machines were infected within 10 minutes, showing that the original estimate for infection speed was roughly correct.

<doc id="177375" wikidata="Q2531250" url="?curid=177375" title="The Man Who Fell to Earth (novel)">
<text>The Man Who Fell to Earth is a 1963 science fiction novel by American author Walter Tevis, about an extraterrestrial who lands on Earth seeking a way to ferry his people to Earth from his home planet, which is suffering from a severe drought. The novel served as the basis for the 1976 film by Nicolas Roeg as well as a 1987 television adaptation and a 2022 television series.

== Plot summary ==
Thomas Jerome Newton is a humanoid alien who comes to Earth seeking to construct a spaceship to ferry others from his home planet, Anthea, to Earth. Anthea is experiencing a terrible drought after many nuclear wars, and the population has dwindled to fewer than 300. Their own starships are unusable for lack of fuel and 500 years of neglect. The Antheans have no water, a supply of food that is slowly dwindling, and feeble solar power. Like all Antheans, Newton is super-intelligent, but he has been selected for this mission because he has the physical strength necessary to function in Earth&#x27;s hotter climate and higher gravity.

Arriving at Earth in a lifeboat, Newton first lands in the state of Kentucky. He quickly becomes familiar with the environment and forms a plan. Using advanced technology from his home planet, Newton patents many inventions, and amasses incredible wealth as the head of a technology-based conglomerate. He plans to use this wealth to construct space vehicles for the rest of the Anthean population.

Along the way he meets Betty Jo, who falls in love with him. He does not return these feelings, but takes her and his curious fuel-technician Nathan Bryce as his friends, while he runs his company in the shadows. Betty Jo introduces Newton to many Earth customs, such as church, fashion, and alcohol. However, his appetite for alcohol soon leads to problems, as he begins to experience intense emotions unfamiliar to Antheans.

Eventually, Newton&#x27;s alien nature is discovered by Nathan Bryce, and it comes as a relief to Newton to be able to reveal his secret to someone. He expresses the hope that the Antheans he will ferry to Earth will flourish and use their superior intelligence to help Earth achieve peace, prosperity, and safety.

However, the CIA arrests Newton, having followed him since his appearance on Earth and having recorded this private conversation with Bryce. They submit him to rigorous tests and analysis, resulting in conclusive evidence of his alien identity, but decide not to release the results for fear they would simply not be believed, and possibly even embarrass the government. Newton is released, but is immediately arrested by the FBI, which begins its own examinations. Their final examination is an X-ray of Newton&#x27;s skull, through his eyes. Newton, whose eyes are sensitive to X-rays, is unable to stop them and is blinded. The story of Newton&#x27;s blinding becomes a public scandal, but he does not pursue retaliation against the government and is left alone in turn and relies on alcohol to cope with depression.

Newton, speaking to Bryce for the last time, explains bitterly that he is unable to continue his spaceship project because of his blindness and because of planetary alignments which have changed during his captivity. He records a message which he hopes to broadcast via radio to his home planet. Bryce leaves Newton to drink alone.

== Critical reception ==
James Sallis declared that &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot; was &quot;among the finest science fiction novels,&quot; saying &quot;Just beneath the surface it might be read as a parable of the Fifties and of the Cold War. Beneath that as an evocation of existential loneliness, a Christian fable, a parable of the artist. Above all, perhaps, as the wisest, truest representation of alcoholism ever written.&quot;

== Adaptations ==
=== 1976 feature film ===

=== 1987 television film ===
A made-for-television film of &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot; was first broadcast in the United States by ABC on August 23, 1987. Directed by Bobby Roth, the film was produced by MGM and was the pilot for an uncommissioned TV series. In this version, the alien (played by Lewis Smith) is renamed &quot;John Dory&quot; and forms a relationship with a woman, Eva Miller (Beverly D&#x27;Angelo), and her son, Billy (Wil Wheaton), a relationship similar to that of Klaatu, Helen Benson and her son Bobby in the 1951 film &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;. Other cast members include James Laurenson as businessman Felix Hawthorne, and Robert Picardo as government agent Richard Morse.

=== Television series ===

On August 1, 2019, it was announced that CBS All Access (later Paramount+) had given a series order to a television series adaptation of the novel. Developed by Alex Kurtzman, the series was to be a reimagining of Tevis&#x27; novel, following an alien who arrives on Earth at a turning point of human evolution. He confronts his past as he introduces new technology to evolve mankind while dealing with its consequences. On March 17, 2021, the series was moved from Paramount+ to Showtime. The series, which stars Chiwetel Ejiofor and Naomie Harris, premiered on April 24, 2022.

<text>Anne Sexton (born Anne Gray Harvey; November 9, 1928 – October 4, 1974) was an American poet known for her highly personal, confessional verse. She won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1967 for her book &quot;Live or Die&quot;. Her poetry details her long battle with bipolar disorder, suicidal tendencies, and intimate details from her private life, including relationships with her husband and children, whom she physically and sexually assaulted.

==Early life and family==
Anne Sexton was born Anne Gray Harvey in Newton, Massachusetts to Mary Gray (Staples) Harvey (1901–1959) and Ralph Churchill Harvey (1900–1959). She had two older sisters, Jane Elizabeth (Harvey) Jealous (1923–1983) and Blanche Dingley (Harvey) Taylor (1925–2011). She spent most of her childhood in Boston. In 1945 she enrolled at Rogers Hall boarding school in Lowell, Massachusetts, later spending a year at Garland School. For a time she modeled for Boston&#x27;s Hart Agency. On August 16, 1948, she married Alfred Muller Sexton II and they remained together until 1973. Sexton had her first child, Linda Gray Sexton, in 1953. Her second child, Joyce Ladd Sexton, was born two years later.

==Poetry==
Sexton suffered from severe bipolar disorder for much of her life, her first manic episode taking place in 1954. After a second episode in 1955 she met Dr. Martin Orne, who became her long-term therapist at the Glenside Hospital. It was Orne who encouraged her to write poetry.

The first poetry workshop she attended was led by John Holmes. Sexton felt great trepidation about registering for the class, asking a friend to make the phone call and accompany her to the first session. She found early acclaim with her poems; a number were accepted by &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and the &quot;Saturday Review&quot;. Sexton later studied with Robert Lowell at Boston University alongside poets Sylvia Plath and George Starbuck. 

Sexton later paid homage to her friendship with Plath in the 1963 poem &quot;Sylvia&#x27;s Death&quot;. Her first volume of poetry, &quot;To Bedlam and Part Way Back&quot;, was published in 1960, and included the poem &quot;Her Kind&quot;, which uses the persecution of witches as an analogy for the oppression of women in a patriarchal society.

Sexton&#x27;s poetic career was encouraged by her mentor W. D. Snodgrass, whom she met at the Antioch Writer&#x27;s Conference in 1957. His poem &quot;Heart&#x27;s Needle&quot; proved inspirational for her in its theme of separation from his three-year-old daughter. Sexton first read the poem at a time when her own young daughter was living with her mother-in-law. She, in turn, wrote &quot;The Double Image&quot;, a poem which explores the multi-generational relationship between mother and daughter. Sexton began writing letters to Snodgrass and they became friends.

While working with John Holmes, Sexton encountered Maxine Kumin. They became good friends and remained so for the rest of Sexton&#x27;s life. Kumin and Sexton rigorously critiqued each other&#x27;s work and wrote four children&#x27;s books together. In the late 1960s, the manic elements of Sexton&#x27;s illness began to affect her career, though she still wrote and published work and gave readings of her poetry. She collaborated with musicians, forming a jazz-rock group called Her Kind that added music to her poetry. Her play &quot;Mercy Street&quot;, starring Marian Seldes, was produced in 1969 after several years of revisions. Sexton also collaborated with the artist Barbara Swan, who illustrated several of her books.

Within 12 years of writing her first sonnet, she was among the most honored poets in the U.S.: a Pulitzer Prize winner, a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and the first female member of the Harvard chapter of Phi Beta Kappa.

==Death==

On October 4, 1974, Sexton had lunch with Kumin to revise galleys for Sexton&#x27;s manuscript of &quot;The Awful Rowing Toward God&quot;, scheduled for publication in March 1975 (Middlebrook 396). Later that day she died by suicide at the age of 45. 

In an interview over a year before her death, she explained she had written the first drafts of &quot;The Awful Rowing Toward God&quot; in 20 days with &quot;two days out for despair and three days out in a mental hospital.&quot; She went on to say that she would not allow the poems to be published before her death. 

Her funeral was at St. Paul&#x27;s Church in Dedham, Massachusetts. She is buried at Forest Hills Cemetery &amp; Crematory in Jamaica Plain, Boston, Massachusetts.

==Content and themes of work==

Sexton is seen as the modern model of the confessional poet due to the intimate and emotional content of her poetry. Sexton often wrote and disclosed her struggles with mental illness through her work. Sexton included numerous topics which were then regarded as obscene and repulsive, especially for women to talk about publicly at the time. Maxine Kumin described Sexton&#x27;s work: &quot;She wrote openly about menstruation, abortion, masturbation, incest, adultery, and drug addiction at a time when the proprieties embraced none of these as proper topics for poetry.&quot; 
Sexton&#x27;s work towards the end of the 1960s has been criticized as &quot;preening, lazy and flip&quot; by otherwise respectful critics. Some critics regard her alcoholism as compromising her last work. However, other critics see Sexton as a poet whose writing matured over time. &quot;Starting as a relatively conventional writer, she learned to roughen up her line ... to use as an instrument against the &#x27;politesse&#x27; of language, politics, religion [and] sex.&quot; 

Her eighth collection of poetry is entitled &quot;The Awful Rowing Toward God&quot;. The title came from her meeting with a Roman Catholic priest who, unwilling to administer last rites, told her &quot;God is in your typewriter.&quot; This gave the poet the desire and willpower to continue living and writing. &quot;The Awful Rowing Toward God&quot; and &quot;The Death Notebooks&quot; are among her final works, and both center on the theme of dying.

Her work started out as being about herself, however as her career progressed she made periodic attempts to reach outside the realm of her own life for poetic themes. &quot;Transformations&quot; (1971), which is a re-visionary re-telling of &quot;Grimm&#x27;s Fairy Tales&quot;, is one such book.

(&quot;Transformations&quot; was used as the libretto for the 1973 opera of the same name by American composer Conrad Susa.) Later she used Christopher Smart&#x27;s &quot;Jubilate Agno&quot; and the Bible as the basis for some of her work.

Much has been made of the tangled threads of her writing, her life, and her depression, much in the same way as with Sylvia Plath&#x27;s suicide in 1963. Robert Lowell, Adrienne Rich, and Denise Levertov commented in separate obituaries on the role of creativity in Sexton&#x27;s death. Levertov says, &quot;We who are alive must make clear, as she could not, the distinction between creativity and self-destruction.&quot;

==Subsequent controversy==
Following one of many suicide attempts and manic or depressive episodes, Sexton worked with therapist Martin Orne. He diagnosed her with what is now described as bipolar disorder, but his competence to do so is called into question by his early use of allegedly unsound psychotherapeutic techniques. During sessions with Sexton, he used hypnosis and sodium pentothal to recover supposedly repressed memories. During this process, he allegedly used suggestion to uncover memories of having been abused by her father. This abuse was disputed in interviews with her mother and other relatives. 

Orne wrote that hypnosis in an adult frequently does not present accurate memories of childhood; instead, &quot;adults under hypnosis are not literally reliving their early childhoods but presenting them through the prisms of adulthood.&quot; According to Orne, Sexton was extremely suggestible and would mimic the symptoms of the patients around her in the mental hospitals to which she was committed. Diane Middlebrook&#x27;s biography states that a separate personality named Elizabeth emerged in Sexton while under hypnosis. Orne did not encourage this development and subsequently this &quot;alternate personality&quot; disappeared. Orne eventually concluded that Anne Sexton was suffering from hysteria. 

During the writing of the Middlebrook biography, her daughter, Linda Gray Sexton, stated that she had been sexually assaulted by her mother. In 1994, she published her autobiography &quot;Searching for Mercy Street: My Journey Back to My Mother, Anne Sexton&quot;, which includes her own accounts of the abuse.

Middlebrook published her controversial biography of Anne Sexton with the approval of daughter Linda, Anne&#x27;s literary executor. For use in the biography, Orne had given Diane Middlebrook most of the tapes recording the therapy sessions between Orne and Anne Sexton. The use of these tapes was met with, as &quot;The New York Times&quot; put it, &quot;thunderous condemnation&quot;. Middlebrook received the tapes after she had written a substantial amount of the first draft of Sexton&#x27;s biography, and decided to start over. Although Linda Gray Sexton collaborated with the Middlebrook biography, other members of the Sexton family were divided over the book, publishing several editorials and op-ed pieces in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;.

Controversy continued with the posthumous public release of the tapes (which had been subject to doctor-patient confidentiality). They are said to reveal Sexton&#x27;s molestation of her daughter Linda, her physically violent behavior toward both her daughters, and her physical altercations with her husband.

Further controversy surrounds allegations that she had an &quot;affair with&quot; the therapist who replaced Orne in the 1960s. 

No action was taken to censure or discipline the second therapist. Orne considered the &quot;affair&quot; with the second therapist (given the pseudonym &quot;Ollie Zweizung&quot; by Middlebrook and Linda Sexton) to be the catalyst that eventually resulted in her suicide.

==Legacy==
Peter Gabriel dedicated his song &quot;Mercy Street&quot; (named for her play &quot;Mercy Street&quot; and inspired by his reading of her poem &quot;45 Mercy Street&quot;) from his 1986 album &quot;So&quot; to Sexton. She has been described as a &quot;personal touchstone&quot; for Morrissey, former lead singer and lyricist of The Smiths. She is commemorated on the Boston Women&#x27;s Heritage Trail.

<text>Kurmangazy Sagyrbayuly (, &quot;Qūrmanğazy Sağyrbaiūly&quot;; 1823–1896) was a Kazakh composer, instrumentalist (kobyz, dombra), and folk artist. He influenced Kazakh musical culture. He was born in 1823 in the Bukey Horde (now Zhanakala District, West Kazakhstan Region). He is buried in the Astrakhan region of Lower Volga in today&#x27;s Russian Federation.

== Biography ==
Kurmangazy was born and raised in the Bukey Horde, in what is now Zhanakala District, West Kazakhstan Region, in a place called Zhideli. His final resting place is in Astrakhan Oblast, at a site formerly known as &quot;Shaitani Bataga&quot;, which is now called &quot;Kurmangazy Hill&quot; in his honor. 

Kurmangazy Sagyrbaiuly&#x27;s origins trace back to the &quot;Kishi Zhuz&quot; (Junior Horde) of the Kazakh people, specifically to the &quot;Sultansiyk&quot; branch of the &quot;Baibakty&quot; clan within the &quot;Baiuly&quot; tribe. His maternal lineage comes from the &quot;Berish&quot; clan, known for its legendary warriors and influential figures. Kurmangazy&#x27;s seventh-generation ancestor, &quot;Ershi,&quot; was renowned for his sharp wit and eloquence. A famous saying about him still exists: &quot;Before debating Ershi&#x27;s men, try arguing with his women first.&quot; His fifth-generation ancestor, &quot;Baltabai,&quot; and his family were known for their mastery of the &quot;dombyra&quot; passing down a deep musical tradition. His father, &quot;Sagyrbai&quot; (reportedly also known as &quot;Duysenbai&quot;), was a simple laborer with no inclination toward the arts. However, his mother, &quot;Alka,&quot; was a free-spirited and bold woman from the &quot;Berish&quot; clan, embodying the warrior-like traditions of her people. She was known for her lively presence at celebrations and gatherings. Later, when Kurmangazy married &quot;Aues,&quot; the daughter of &quot;Igilik,&quot; the &quot;Berish&quot; clan also became his in-laws, further intertwining his life with this historically significant lineage.

Since childhood, Kurmangazy&#x27;s most expressive and sensitive language was the language of music that came from the strings of the dombra. That is why, when he first saw and listened to Sokyr Eszhan, the renowned kuishi of the steppe, he immediately understood the language and essence of his dombra, listening in deep admiration. Likewise, he passionately played the pieces of his contemporaries, such as Sherkesh, Baizhuma, and Balamaisan, grasping the most truthful essence of time through their music. However, Kurmangazy&#x27;s true mentor was Uzakh.

In 1830, Kurmangazy was present during the peasants&#x27; uprising against Zhangir Khan, led by Isatai Taimanuly from the Berish tribe and his close friend, the fervent poet and masterful composer Makhambet Otemisuly. During those years, he composed the piece &quot;Kishkentai&quot; (Little One).

In 1857, Kurmangazy was imprisoned. He managed to escape just before being exiled to Siberia. Later, he was arrested again and sent to Orenburg prison, but was freed with the support of Governor-General Perovsky. Inspired by his prison experiences, he composed several pieces, including &quot;&quot;Kairan Shekem&quot; (My Dear Mother), &quot;Erten Ketem&quot; (I Leave Tomorrow), &quot;Kisen Ashkan&quot; (Breaking the Shackles), &quot;Turmeden Kashkan&quot; (Escaped from Prison), &quot;Arba Sokkan&quot; (The Wagon’s Rattle), &quot;Perovsky Marshy&quot; (Perovsky’s March), &quot;Ne Krichi, Ne Shumi&quot; (Don’t Shout, Don’t Make Noise),&quot; and &quot;&quot;Mashina&quot; (The Machine).&quot;

In 1880, he moved to the Sakmar settlement near Astrakhan. Highly respected within the community, Kurmangazy gathered his disciples, including Dina Kenjeqyzy Nurpeisova, Yergali Yeszhanov, and Mendigali Suleimenov. During that era, renowned dombra masters such as Kokbala, Menetai, Menqara, Sugirali, Torghaibai, and Shora also regarded Kurmangazy as their mentor.

Kurmangazy was a great and renowned kyuyshi (composer and dombra player) of the steppe. He learned from the esteemed master Soqyr Yeszhan, exchanged musical insights with the distinguished kyuyshi Dauletkerey, and was influenced by the artistry of Sherkesh, Baizhuma, and Balamaisan.

==Legacy==

In 1993, Sagyrbaev&#x27;s image has been used on the 5 Kazakhstani tenge banknote, and on a Khazakh stamp in 1998.

The Kazakh National Conservatory is officially named after Kurmangazy.

== Works ==
The time when Kurmangazy lived, especially the period when he became aware of his surroundings and actively engaged in life, was highly complex. This was the era when the colonial policies of Tsarist Russia were at their peak—greedy, oppressive, and increasingly ruthless. In times of hardship, the burden of calamity always falls first on the shoulders of the most resilient individuals. The turmoil of the era also left its mark on Kurmangazy, testing him with fire and trials. His compositions such as &quot;&quot;Tүрмеден қашқан&quot; (Escaped from Prison), &quot;Кісен ашқан&quot; (Breaking the Shackles), &quot;Ертең кетем&quot; (Leaving Tomorrow), &quot;Бозқаңғыр&quot; (Bozqangyr), &quot;Пәбескі&quot; (Carriage), &quot;Терезеден-есіктен&quot; (Through the Window and Door), &quot;Бозшолақ&quot; (Bozsholak), &quot;Бұқтым-бұқтым&quot; (Buktym-Buktym), &quot;Ne krichи, ne shumi&quot; (Do Not Shout, Do Not Make Noise), &quot;Арба соққан&quot; (Wagon Maker), &quot;Аман бол, шешем, аман бол!&quot; (Farewell, Mother, Stay Safe!), &quot;Қайран шешем&quot; (My Dear Mother)&quot;—serve as milestones of the hardships imposed by the times. He responded to every challenge of his harsh fate through his art, leaving his mark with his music.

Kurmangazy was a composer deeply in love with life. He could rejoice like a child at the bright moments of existence and immerse himself in pure emotions. His compositions such as &quot;&quot;Қызыл қайың&quot; (Red Birch), &quot;Ақжелең&quot; (Akzhelen), &quot;Адай&quot; (Adai), &quot;Сарыарқа&quot; (Saryarka), &quot;Балбырауын&quot; (Balbyrauyn), &quot;Серпер&quot; (Serper), &quot;Назым&quot; (Nazym), &quot;Балқаймақ&quot; (Balkaymak), &quot;Бұлбұлдың құрғыры&quot; (Cursed Nightingale), &quot;Ақсақ киік&quot; (Lame Antelope), &quot;Төремұрат&quot; (Toremurat), &quot;Қуаныш&quot; (Joy)&quot; reflect the heartbeat of a soul deeply passionate about life.

What sets Kurmangazy apart as a unique artist is his conceptual approach to composition. He was not just reflecting on the fate of one or two generations but delved deeply into historical phenomena that shaped multiple generations. This ability to contemplate and interpret significant societal changes was an essential part of his spiritual identity. His compositions such as &quot;&quot;Жігер&quot; (Ziger), &quot;Көбік шашқан&quot; (Foaming Waves), &quot;Кішкентай&quot; (Kishkentai), &quot;Ақбай&quot; (Akbai)&quot; serve as the reflections of a philosophical composer, offering his assessment of the historical and social realities of his time.

Similarly, his compositions such as &quot;&quot;Айжан-ай&quot; (Aizhan-ai), &quot;Айда бұлбұл&quot; (Sing, Nightingale), &quot;Алатау&quot; (Alatau), &quot;Амандасар&quot; (Greeting), &quot;Бас Ақжелең&quot; (Main Akzhelen), &quot;Демалыс&quot; (Rest), &quot;Лаушкен&quot; (Laushken), &quot;Ойбай, балам&quot; (Oh My Child), &quot;Саранжап&quot; (Saranjap), &quot;Теріс қақпай&quot; (Reverse Kakpay), &quot;Ұзақ Ақжелең&quot; (Long Akzhelen)&quot; are widely known.

Kurmangazy’s soaring spirit cannot be confined to the realm of music alone. A talent of such immense power serves as a testament to the spiritual identity of an entire nation. The great historical transformations in a nation’s destiny are always intertwined with the fates of its extraordinary sons and daughters. In this sense, Kurmangazy was not only an unparalleled artist but also a living embodiment of his people&#x27;s essence, reflecting the turbulent and chaotic era he lived in. With his powerful compositions, he carried the weight of his time without breaking, just as Makhambet did in poetry, Shoqan in science, and Kenesary on the battlefield—remaining steadfast in his indomitable spirit.

== The History of Kurmangazy’s Kuys ==
One of Kurmangazy’s earliest compositions is &quot;Kishkentai&quot;, dedicated to the leader of the uprising, Isatai. His kuys &quot;Aqbay&quot;, &quot;Aqsak Kiik&quot;, &quot;Kobik Shashkan&quot;, &quot;Turmeden Kashkan&quot;, and &quot;Aday&quot; vividly depict a hopeful future, the people&#x27;s aspirations, and resentment toward the ruling class. Through his kuy &quot;Saryarka&quot;, Kurmangazy paints a musical image of his homeland and its vast steppe. His kuys captivate listeners with their rich melodies, graceful nuances, and powerful energy, creating a whirlwind of emotions with their dynamic tempo. Most of his compositions have well-defined themes and structured forms, making them grand musical pieces. Kurmangazy skillfully explored the full potential of the dombra, utilizing its sound range and technical capabilities to the fullest. A distinctive feature of his kuys is the well-developed progression of the melody, where the &quot;small saga&quot; and &quot;great saga&quot; sections unfold, allowing the dombra’s full range to be mastered. The unique rhythm and structure of each composition remain consistent throughout the piece. Some of his famous kuys include &quot;Balbyrauyn&quot;, &quot;Erten Zhetem&quot;, &quot;Buktym-Buktym&quot;, &quot;Balkaimak&quot;, &quot;Boz Kangyr&quot;, &quot;Ne Krichi Ne Shumi&quot;, &quot;Aizhan-Ai&quot;, and &quot;Laushken&quot;. Detailed descriptions of these and many others are provided below.

* &quot;Qairan Shechem&quot; (Oh, My Dear Mother)
When Aqkai’s messengers were about to tie Kurmangazy to a cart for exile, he saw his mother, Akbala. Overcome with emotion, he regretted that he had not done anything meaningful for the mother who had raised him with such care. Now, once again, he was being taken away. Tears welled up in his eyes as he approached her. Seeing this, his mother rebuked him: &quot;“I thought I had given birth to a brave son, but I see now that I have raised a weak and cowardly one. How dare you shed tears in front of others?”&quot; Then, she slapped him across the face. This moment made Kurmangazy realize his mistake. While imprisoned in Orenburg, he reflected on this painful encounter and composed the kuy &quot;Qairan Shechem&quot; in honor of his mother. The kuy begins with a slow, sorrowful melody, as if expressing his despair in captivity. Gradually, it builds in intensity, reflecting his emotions pouring out in a passionate musical expression.

* &quot;Qapy&quot; (Regret)
A long-standing enemy of Kurmangazy, a local judge (bi), relentlessly pursued him. During a gathering, while playing the dombra and reciting the verses of Isatai and Makhambet, Kurmangazy was accused of praising the rebellious leaders. Using this as an excuse, the judge had him arrested. Filled with frustration and regret over this betrayal, Kurmangazy composed the kuy &quot;Qapy&quot; (Regret). This piece conveys a deep sense of sorrow and disappointment, reflecting his emotions through its melancholic yet powerful melody.

* &quot;Qosh Aman Bol&quot; (Farewell)
As Kurmangazy was unexpectedly captured and about to be sent to Orda prison, he bid farewell to his people, saying, &quot;“Until we meet again, farewell, my people.”&quot; At that moment, he played the kuy &quot;Qosh Aman Bol&quot;. This kuy embodies a heartfelt goodbye, filled with longing and sorrow. The melody begins with a somber tone, reflecting his sadness at parting, but as the piece progresses, it gains strength, symbolizing his resilience and hope for freedom.

* Qyz Danai’s Massacre
In 1850, Kurmangazy traveled with his uncles Töremurat, Öten, and Narymbai to rescue a young woman named Qyz Danai from an arranged marriage. As they were bringing her back, a group of pursuers attempted to reclaim her, but Kurmangazy bravely fought them off, ensuring her safe passage. Impressed by his courage, his uncles honored him with great respect and gifts. Inspired by this event, Kurmangazy composed &quot;Qyz Danai’s Massacre&quot;. The kuy vividly captures the thunderous gallop of horses and the intensity of battle, while also weaving in the beauty of Danai through soft, melodic passages that evoke her graceful laughter. To celebrate this heroic feat, Töremurat organized a grand feast, inviting the entire community.

* &quot;Qyzyl Qaiyng&quot; (The Red Birch)
According to legend, while fleeing from pursuers, Kurmangazy found shelter beneath the branches of a lone red birch tree standing in the vast steppe. The tree’s foliage concealed him, allowing him to evade capture. Grateful for this unexpected protection, he later said, &quot;“My people, my land, and even a single tree have been my refuge. That red birch shielded me like a mother, covering me with its leaves.”.&quot; In honor of this moment, he composed the kuy &quot;Qyzyl Qaiyng&quot;. The melody reflects both the tension of the chase and the deep gratitude he felt toward the land that had always sheltered him.

* &quot;Kóbik Shashkan&quot; (Foaming Waves)
At certain periods in history, the Caspian Sea’s water level would rise dramatically, overflowing its shores and causing destruction. Scientists say this is a natural cycle that occurs over long intervals. One such event took place in the second half of the 19th century, witnessed by the great composer Kurmangazy and the improvisational poet Qashagan. During one of Kurmangazy’s visits, he encountered Qashagan, and together they walked along the stormy shore, observing the raging sea. There is even a painting depicting this moment. Deeply affected by the devastation the flood brought upon the people, Qashagan composed the epic poem &quot;Topan&quot;, where he interprets the catastrophe as a consequence of humanity’s moral decline and indulgence in sin. Kurmangazy, too, was moved by the sight of the sea’s wild, foaming waves and the suffering they caused. Inspired by both the stormy waters and Qashagan’s poetic vision, he composed the kuy &quot;Kóbik Shashkan&quot;. The piece reflects the turbulent power of the sea, its relentless surges, and the sorrow it inflicted upon the people, blending sorrowful undertones with a dramatic, surging melody.

* &quot;Túrmeden Qashqan&quot; (Escape from Prison)
According to historical accounts, Kurmangazy composed this kuy while resting after a daring prison escape. From a young age, he fought for his people’s freedom, which led to multiple imprisonments. During one of these times, his prison companion, Lavochkin, received a hidden steel saw from his mother, concealed within food. With the help of sympathetic prison guards, Kurmangazy managed to escape. Exhausted but filled with relief and inspiration, he sat down to rest and composed &quot;Túrmeden Qashqan&quot;. The kuy captures the tension and urgency of his escape, the thrill of freedom, and the deep breath of relief after breaking free. The melody builds with intensity, reflecting the pulse-pounding moments of his flight, then transitions into a more triumphant and liberated tone.

One of five children, Powers was born in Evanston, Illinois, the son of Richard Franklin Powers and his wife Donna Powers (née Belik). His family later moved a few miles west to Lincolnwood, where his father was a local school principal. When Powers was 11, they moved to Bangkok, Thailand, where his father had accepted a position at International School Bangkok, which Powers attended through his freshman year, ending in 1972. During that time outside the U.S., he developed skills in vocal music and proficiency in cello, guitar, saxophone, and clarinet. He also became an avid reader, enjoying nonfiction primarily and classics such as the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;.

The family returned to the U.S. when Powers was 16. Following graduation in 1975 from DeKalb High School in DeKalb, Illinois, he enrolled at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign (UIUC) with a major in physics, which he switched to English literature during his first semester. He earned a BA in 1978 and an MA in Literature in 1980. He decided not to pursue a PhD partly because of his aversion to strict specialization, which had been one reason for his early transfer from physics to English, and partly because he had observed in graduate students and their professors a lack of pleasure in reading and writing (as portrayed in &quot;Galatea 2.2&quot;).

===Professorships and awards===
In 2010 and 2013, Powers was a Stein Visiting Writer at Stanford University, during which time he partly assisted in the lab of biochemist Aaron Straight.

Powers was named a MacArthur Fellow in 1989. He received a Lannan Literary Award in 1999.

Powers was appointed the Swanlund Professor of English at UIUC in 1996, where he is currently an emeritus professor.

On August 22, 2013, Stanford University announced that Powers had been named the Phil and Penny Knight Professor of Creative Writing in the Department of English.

===Novels===
Powers learned computer programming at Illinois as a user of PLATO and moved to Boston to work as a programmer. One Saturday in 1980, Powers saw the 1914 photograph &quot;Young Farmers&quot; by August Sander at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and was so inspired that he quit his job two days later to write a novel about the people in the photograph. Powers spent the next two years writing the book, &quot;Three Farmers on Their Way to a Dance&quot;, which was published by William Morrow in 1985. It comprises three alternating threads: a novella featuring the three young men in the photo during World War I, a technology magazine editor who is obsessed with the photo, and the author&#x27;s critical and historical musings about the mechanics of photography and the life of Henry Ford. It was a National Book Critics Circle Award finalist, and received the Rosenthal Award from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. It also received a Special Citation from the PEN/Hemingway Awards.

Powers moved to the Netherlands, where he wrote &quot;Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma&quot; about The Walt Disney Company and nuclear warfare.

He followed with &quot;The Gold Bug Variations&quot; about genetics, music, and computer science. It was a National Book Critics Circle Award finalist.

In 1993, Powers wrote &quot;Operation Wandering Soul&quot; about an agonized young pediatrician. It was a finalist for the National Book Award.

In 1995, Powers published the Pygmalion story &quot;Galatea 2.2&quot; about an artificial intelligence experiment gone awry. It was a National Book Critics Circle Award finalist.

In 1998, Powers wrote &quot;Gain&quot; about a 150-year-old chemical company and a woman who lives near one of its plants and succumbs to ovarian cancer. It won the James Fenimore Cooper Prize for Best Historical Fiction in 1999.

2000&#x27;s &quot;Plowing the Dark&quot; tells of a Seattle research team building a groundbreaking virtual reality while an American teacher is held hostage in Beirut. It received Harold D. Vursell Memorial Award from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.

Powers wrote &quot;The Time of Our Singing&quot; in 2003. It is about the musician children of an interracial couple who met at Marian Anderson&#x27;s famed 1939 concert on the Lincoln Memorial steps.

Powers&#x27;s ninth novel, 2006&#x27;s &quot;The Echo Maker&quot;, is about a Nebraska man who suffers head trauma in a truck accident and believes his caregiver sister is an imposter. It won a National Book Award and was a Pulitzer Prize for Fiction finalist.

Powers&#x27;s tenth novel, 2009&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, has writing professor Russell Stone encountering his former student, Thassa, an Algerian woman whose constant happiness is exploited by journalists and scientists.

In 2014, Powers wrote &quot;Orfeo&quot; about Peter Els, a retired music composition instructor and avant-garde composer who is mistaken for a bio-terrorist after being discovered with a makeshift genetics lab in his house.

&quot;The Overstory&quot;, published in April 2018, is about nine Americans whose unique life experiences with trees bring them together to address the destruction of forests. It won the 2019 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, was shortlisted for the Booker Prize and the $75,000 2019 PEN/Jean Stein Book Award, and was runner-up for the Dayton Literary Peace Prize.

&quot;Bewilderment&quot;, published in September 2021, was shortlisted for the 2021 Booker Prize and longlisted for the National Book Award and Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Fiction. It is described as &quot;an astrobiologist thinks of a creative way to help his rare and troubled son in Richard Powers’ deeply moving and brilliantly original novel.&quot;

Playground (2024), the 14th novel by Powers, was longlisted for the 2024 Booker Prize.

<doc id="177383" wikidata="Q131366" url="?curid=177383" title="Disturbed (band)">
<text>Disturbed is an American heavy metal band from Chicago, formed in 1994. The band includes guitarist Dan Donegan, drummer Mike Wengren, lead vocalist David Draiman and bassist John Moyer. Donegan and Wengren have been involved in the band since its inception, with Draiman replacing original lead vocalist Erich Awalt in 1996 and Moyer replacing original bassist Steve &quot;Fuzz&quot; Kmak in 2004.

Disturbed&#x27;s debut album, &quot;The Sickness&quot;, was released in 2000 as a commercial success, mainly due to the singles &quot;Down With the Sickness&quot; and &quot;Stupify&quot;. The band then released the albums &quot;Believe&quot; (2002), &quot;Ten Thousand Fists&quot; (2005), &quot;Indestructible&quot; (2008), and &quot;Asylum&quot; (2010), all of which debuted at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. Disturbed went into hiatus in October 2011, during which the band&#x27;s members focused on various side projects, and released &quot;The Lost Children&quot;, a compilation album containing previously unreleased songs. They returned in June 2015 and released their sixth album &quot;Immortalized&quot; that same year. They followed it up with the albums &quot;Evolution&quot; (2018) and &quot;Divisive&quot; (2022).

With over 17 million records sold worldwide, six RIAA certifications for their albums (including 5× platinum for &quot;The Sickness&quot;), singles from all eight albums reaching the top ten of the Mainstream Rock chart, and two Grammy Award nominations, Disturbed ranks alongside Slipknot and Godsmack as one of the most successful rock bands of the 21st century.

==History==

===Early years (1994–1996)===
Before David Draiman joined Disturbed, guitarist Dan Donegan, drummer Mike Wengren and bassist Steve &quot;Fuzz&quot; Kmak were in a band called Brawl with vocalist Erich Awalt. Before changing their name to &quot;Brawl&quot;, however, Donegan mentioned in the band&#x27;s DVD, &quot;Decade of Disturbed&quot;, that the name was originally going to be &quot;Crawl&quot;; they switched it to &quot;Brawl&quot;, because the name was already being used by another band. Awalt left the band shortly after the recording of a demo tape; the other three members advertised for a singer. They posted an advertisement in the local music publication in Chicago, Illinois, called the &quot;Illinois Entertainer&quot;. Draiman answered the advertisement after going to twenty other auditions that month. Guitarist Dan Donegan commented on Draiman: &quot;You know, out of all the singers that we had talked to or auditioned, he [Draiman] was the only singer who was ready to go with originals. And that impressed me, just to attempt that&quot;.

With regard to Draiman being the singer for the band, Donegan said, &quot;After a minute or two, he just starts banging out these melodies that were huge...I&#x27;m playing my guitar and I&#x27;m grinning from ear to ear, trying not to give it away that I like this guy, you know, because I don&#x27;t want to, you know...[say] &#x27;Yeah, we&#x27;ll give you a call back. We&#x27;ll, you know, discuss it.&#x27; But I was so psyched. Chill up my spine. I&#x27;m like, &#x27;There is something here.&#x27;&quot; As drummer Mike Wengren commented, &quot;We clicked right off the bat.&quot; Draiman then joined the band in 1996, and the band was renamed Disturbed. When asked in an interview why he suggested to name the band &quot;Disturbed&quot;, Draiman said, &quot;It had been a name I have been contemplating for a band for years. It just seems to symbolize everything we were feeling at the time. The level of conformity that people are forced into was disturbing to us and we were just trying to push the envelope and the name just sorta made sense.&quot;

===&quot;The Sickness&quot; (1997–2000)===
After renaming the band, Disturbed went on to record two three-track demo tapes, the first containing demos for &quot;The Game&quot;, &quot;Down with the Sickness&quot;, and &quot;Meaning of Life&quot;, while the second had demos for &quot;Want&quot;, &quot;Stupify&quot;, and &quot;Droppin&#x27; Plates&quot;. The artwork was composed of the band&#x27;s newly created mascot, The Guy. The band eventually signed with Giant Records in August 1999 and opened for Ministry at Chicago&#x27;s Riviera Theatre around the same time. In 2000, the band released its debut album, titled &quot;The Sickness&quot;, which launched the band into stardom. The album peaked at number 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and it has sold over four million copies in the United States since its release. Before joining Marilyn Manson&#x27;s 2001 European tour, bassist Steve Kmak was unable to play with the band due to a shattered ankle, caused by falling out of a fire escape outside Disturbed&#x27;s rehearsal hall in Chicago. He took the fire escape to exit the building while the elevator was being used to move their equipment downstairs. Kmak skipped the European trek of the tour, but he did perform with the band on January 11 and 12, 2001 at Disturbed&#x27;s show in Chicago. During the European tour, Marty O&#x27;Brien replaced Kmak until he was able to tour again.

===&quot;Believe&quot; (2001–2003)===

In 2001, Disturbed covered the song &quot;Midlife Crisis&quot; for a Faith No More tribute album that was eventually abandoned. The cover was later rerecorded and released on the compilation album &quot;The Lost Children&quot; in 2011. In September 2001, production of their second studio album began. On June 4, 2002, Disturbed released a documentary DVD about the band, titled &quot;M.O.L.&quot;, which showed some of the band&#x27;s more personal moments in the studio and during tours, as well as featuring several music videos and live performances. On September 17, 2002, Disturbed released their second studio album, titled &quot;Believe&quot;, which debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The music video for the first single from the album, titled &quot;Prayer&quot;, was pulled from most television stations, due to perceived similarities with the September 11, 2001 attacks. David Draiman recorded vocals for a song titled &quot;Forsaken&quot;, a song written and produced by Jonathan Davis of the band Korn, released on &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot;.

In 2003, the band once again participated in the Ozzfest tour and started another one of their own tours, titled &quot;Music as a Weapon II&quot;. The bands Chevelle, Taproot, and Ünloco toured with them. During the tour, Disturbed debuted an unreleased song, titled &quot;Dehumanized&quot;. After Disturbed finished the Music as a Weapon II tour, Steve Kmak was fired by the band because of &quot;personality differences&quot;. He was replaced by John Moyer; Moyer&#x27;s last band, the Union Underground, had recently become inactive. On the night Moyer became the band&#x27;s new bass player, Disturbed played live at the House of Blues and performed two new songs, &quot;Hell&quot; and &quot;Monster&quot;, both of which are B-side tracks on the band&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Ten Thousand Fists&quot;.

===&quot;Ten Thousand Fists&quot; (2004–2006)===
Disturbed&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Ten Thousand Fists&quot;, was released on September 20, 2005. The album debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, while also selling around 238,000 copies in the week following its release. The album was certified platinum, shipping 1,000,000 units, in the United States on January 5, 2006. The band toured with 10 Years and Ill Niño in support of the album. Disturbed headlined Ozzfest 2006 along with System of a Down, Lacuna Coil, DragonForce, Avenged Sevenfold, and Hatebreed.

In an interview with Launch Radio Networks, Disturbed vocalist David Draiman stated that twenty songs were recorded for the album, but only fourteen made it to the final track listing. The remaining songs included &quot;Hell&quot;, which was included in one of the two &quot;Stricken&quot; singles; &quot;Monster&quot;, which was included as an iTunes pre-order bonus for &quot;Ten Thousand Fists&quot;, then later included on the &quot;Ten Thousand Fists&quot; Tour Edition; &quot;Two Worlds&quot;, which was also included on the Tour Edition of &quot;Ten Thousand Fists&quot;; and &quot;Sickened&quot;, which was included in the &quot;Land of Confusion&quot; single. &quot;Ten Thousand Fists&quot; is the first album released by Disturbed to feature guitar solos. The band stated that they felt that guitar solos are a part of music that is absent in a lot of modern music, and they wanted to bring some of that back. Songs like &quot;Stricken&quot;, &quot;Overburdened&quot;, and &quot;Land of Confusion&quot; all feature guitar solos, as well as many others.

In 2006, a European tour was scheduled but was rescheduled twice due to Draiman having troubles with severe acid reflux, which affected his voice, as related by Draiman himself. Later that year, Draiman underwent surgery for a deviated septum which affected his voice. It was successful, and ever since then, Draiman has limited his drinking on the road. In late 2006, Disturbed headlined another one of their own tours named Music as a Weapon III; the bands Flyleaf, Stone Sour, and Nonpoint toured with them. Disturbed completed the first leg of their Music as a Weapon III tour in late 2006. Soon after, Draiman stated that there was not going to be a second leg to the tour and that instead the band was going off the road to start working on their fourth studio album.

===&quot;Indestructible&quot; (2007–2009)===

In July 2007, a new track titled &quot;This Moment&quot; was released on the to the film &quot;Transformers&quot;. Disturbed mixed their fourth studio album, titled &quot;Indestructible&quot;, in Los Angeles in late 2007. In an earlier interview, David Draiman said that they were going to record fifteen songs, but only twelve would be on the album.

&quot;Indestructible&quot;&#x27;s first single, &quot;Inside the Fire&quot; was made available on digital distribution services for purchase on March 25, 2008. The band also toured in the United States in April and May 2008 with the bands Five Finger Death Punch and Art of Dying. The music video for &quot;Inside the Fire&quot; was released on May 2, 2008 on the band&#x27;s official website. Disturbed released their previously free song &quot;Perfect Insanity&quot; on iTunes Store as a second single on May 6, 2008, and the album &quot;Indestructible&quot; become available for pre-order for the release date on June 3, 2008. &quot;Indestructible&quot; was released in the United States on June 3, 2008 and in Australia on June 7, 2008 and became the band&#x27;s third consecutive number one debut on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. A special &quot;Internet Only&quot; limited edition of the album that includes the B-side track &quot;Run&quot;, a making-of DVD with instructional videos, wrap-around poster, VIP laminate, access to special Disturbed events, and a special website with an exclusive video, rare audio and more was also released. Disturbed played their first live online concert on May 29, 2008. The concert was sponsored by Pepsi and Deep Rock Drive. They performed in Las Vegas. The band toured in support of the &quot;Mayhem Festival&quot; alongside Slipknot, DragonForce and Mastodon during summer of 2008. Disturbed also completed a tour of Australia and New Zealand through August and September 2008.

In May 2008, Harmonix, the developers of the video game &quot;Rock Band&quot; announced they had reached a deal with Disturbed and Best Buy to offer two tracks from &quot;Indestructible&quot; for play in &quot;Rock Band&quot; to those who pre-ordered the album from Best Buy&#x27;s website. On June 3, 2008, Harmonix released three tracks from &quot;Indestructible&quot;; &quot;Indestructible&quot;, &quot;Inside the Fire&quot;, and &quot;Perfect Insanity&quot;. On May 12, 2009, Harmonix released Stricken and Stupify to the Rock Band music store.
On September 30, 2008, the band released an iTunes-exclusive live album entitled &quot;Live &amp; Indestructible&quot;, made up of songs from Deep Rock Drive, as well as the music video for &quot;Indestructible&quot;. The band started a tour of Europe, starting in London during October 2008 and finishing during November 2008 in Helsinki. In November and December 2008, Disturbed toured in the United States. The song &quot;Inside the Fire&quot; was nominated for a 2009 Grammy Award in the &quot;Best Hard Rock Performance&quot; category. In March 2009, Disturbed released a music video for the single &quot;The Night&quot;. The band began their Music as a Weapon IV tour in March 2009 and it ended in late May. The tour, also dubbed a &quot;festival&quot;, featured the bands Killswitch Engage, Lacuna Coil, and Chimaira on the main stage. The band released a second cover version of Faith No More&#x27;s song &quot;Midlife Crisis&quot; on the album &quot;Covered, A Revolution in Sound&quot;, which also included bands such as Mastodon, The Used, and Avenged Sevenfold. This cover of &quot;Midlife Crisis&quot; was originally recorded for &quot;Indestructible&quot;, but the band decided not to include it on the album.

===&quot;Asylum,&quot; &quot;The Lost Children&quot; and hiatus (2010–2011)===
In an interview in July 2009, with FaceCulture, Draiman stated that the DVD would be &quot;chronicling the past decade of Disturbed&#x27;s existence. It&#x27;s meant to show our growth over the course of the decade.&quot; He also talked more about the fifth album: &quot;A couple of [song riffs] that Danny has come up with are really amazing. But they&#x27;re just little pieces...it&#x27;s not even in two-three part progression [yet].&quot; A few months later on March 23, 2010, the band released a reissue of their debut album, &quot;The Sickness&quot;, with the B-side tracks &quot;God of the Mind&quot; and &quot;A Welcome Burden&quot;, updated artwork, as well as remastering and remixing the track list. It was also available for the first time in vinyl format. On February 26, 2010, Harmonix announced a second Disturbed pack for download on the Rock Band music store, containing the 2010 remastered versions of &quot;Voices&quot;, &quot;The Game&quot;, and &quot;Meaning of Life&quot;.

The band entered the studio in Chicago in early 2010 to begin recording their fifth album, planning on a release that summer. Guitarist Dan Donegan stated that the band had written around 15–18 songs. It was later confirmed that the title of the album would be &quot;Asylum&quot;. The band released a cover of heavy metal band Judas Priest&#x27;s song &quot;Living After Midnight&quot; for the &quot;Metal Hammer Presents... Tribute to British Steel&quot; album. On April 20, 2010, roughly two months after they entered the studio, Disturbed announced that they had finished recording the album, and were ready to begin mixing it in Los Angeles, California. As they did with their last album &quot;Indestructible&quot;, Disturbed stated that they self-produced &quot;Asylum&quot;. The band announced that &quot;Asylum&quot; would be released on August 31, 2010. On July 9, 2010, the track listing was revealed on the band&#x27;s official website. &quot;Asylum&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Asylum&quot; was Disturbed&#x27;s fourth consecutive studio album to debut on top of the charts, an achievement only earned by two other bands: Metallica and Dave Matthews Band.

Disturbed headlined the first annual &quot;Rockstar Energy Drink Uproar&quot; tour with Avenged Sevenfold, as well as Stone Sour, Hellyeah and Halestorm, among others in late summer 2010. Then, in October 2010, it was reported that David Draiman was diagnosed with a &quot;serious throat condition&quot;, and the band&#x27;s U.S. tour had been canceled, as Draiman&#x27;s healing process could have taken up to four weeks. Around the end of that year, Disturbed announced that they would be commencing the Music as a Weapon V tour in 2011, co-headlining with Korn and guests Sevendust, In This Moment and Stillwell. In January 2011, the Mayhem Festival announced that Disturbed would be headlining the festival along with Godsmack and Megadeth that summer. In February 2011, Disturbed was added to that summer&#x27;s Download Festival. Disturbed announced that in May 2011, they would be co-headlining the Rock on the Range Festival in Columbus, Ohio.

On Thursday, April 28, Disturbed announced that their previously unreleased bonus track from &quot;Asylum&quot;, titled &quot;3&quot;, would be available for download on their website. They said that all proceeds made from the download of the song would go towards the Damien Echols Defense Fund, a benefit foundation supporting the release of the West Memphis Three.

In July 2011, the band confirmed it would go on hiatus after finishing their US tour that year, and in an interview that same month, Draiman dismissed concerns that the hiatus was a result of conflict between the band members. Disturbed went into hiatus in October 2011. Disturbed released a b-side compilation album, titled &quot;The Lost Children&quot;, on November 8, 2011. The song &quot;Hell&quot; was made available for digital download on October 11, 2011, but Draiman stated on his Twitter page that there would not be a music video for it. A previously unreleased track, titled &quot;Mine&quot;, also appears on the album. The track listing and release date were revealed on Draiman&#x27;s Twitter page on September 20. On April 21, 2012, to commemorate Record Store Day, Disturbed released &quot;The Collection&quot;. It is a box set featuring the band&#x27;s five full-length studio albums in 140 gram vinyl LPs.

===End of hiatus and &quot;Immortalized&quot; (2015–2017)===

On June 20, 2015, on Disturbed&#x27;s Facebook page and website, there was material posted hinting at a possible return of the band. The website shows a new Disturbed logo, plus a video of the band&#x27;s mascot &quot;The Guy&quot; appearing to be on life support, still breathing. The new Disturbed logo was also posted to their official Facebook page, along with the video of their mascot, and their profile picture changed to solid black, indicating new activity within the band. On June 22, 2015, Disturbed posted another video on Facebook, this time showing The Guy awakening from life support, as well as an 18-hour countdown on their official website, giving speculation to a definite reunion.

On June 23, 2015, Disturbed officially announced the end of their hiatus and the coming of their new album entitled &quot;Immortalized&quot;. On the same day, the official music video for the new single &quot;The Vengeful One&quot; was released on their YouTube channel. &quot;Immortalized&quot; was released on August 21, 2015. John Moyer did not perform on the album due to working on other projects, with all bass tracks being performed by Dan Donegan. Moyer is not in the band&#x27;s video for &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; released in December 2015. Moyer remains a band member, however, having appeared in promotional photography for the album as well as continuing to perform live with the band.

On the album&#x27;s release day, the band played their first show in four years at the House of Blues in Chicago. The show featured the live debuts of four new songs (&quot;The Vengeful One&quot;, &quot;What Are You Waiting For&quot;, &quot;The Light&quot; and the title track) and the song &quot;Hell&quot;, a B-side from &quot;Ten Thousand Fists&quot;, in its entirety for the first time.
Disturbed released a virtual reality experience for the band&#x27;s cover of &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; via Littlstar. The band released a live album titled &quot;Live at Red Rocks&quot; on November 18, 2016. The band performed &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; live on an episode of Australia&#x27;s &quot;The X Factor&quot;. The band also performed &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; live on an episode of &quot;Conan&quot;. Disturbed was announced as a direct support to Avenged Sevenfold on their UK &amp; European tour throughout January and March 2017, alongside In Flames and Chevelle.

===&quot;Evolution&quot; (2018–2020)===
Disturbed headlined the 2018 Rock Fest, along with Godsmack and Incubus. The band announced via social media in early January 2018 that they had entered the studio to begin recording their next studio album. In June 2018, lead guitarist Dan Donegan and bassist John Moyer confirmed with sources that the new album had been completed, with 100% of the songs finished, leaving only mixing and mastering to be done. Band members also posted a picture via Instagram together at a dinner party in celebration of completion of the recording process, the band&#x27;s first album in over 3 years and the band&#x27;s first album in over 8 years to have bassist John Moyer being involved in.

The album, &quot;Evolution&quot; was released on October 19, 2018. On August 16, 2018, the lead single, titled &quot;Are You Ready&quot; was released. On September 21, 2018, the album&#x27;s second single, titled &quot;A Reason to Fight&quot; was released. In support of the album, the band announced the &#x27;Evolution World Tour&#x27;, which took place in early 2019. The initial dates announced included shows across North America with select Canadian dates, as well as a European leg of the tour. On March 25, 2019, Disturbed announced a massive summer tour with Pop Evil and In This Moment. Pop Evil opened the first half of dates and In This Moment opened the second.

On January 27, 2020, the band announced a 31-date tour with Staind and Bad Wolves celebrating the 20th anniversary of &quot;The Sickness&quot;. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the band had postponed the tour to 2021. On September 11, 2020, Disturbed released a cover of the song &quot;If I Ever Lose My Faith in You&quot; by Sting. On March 12, 2021, it was announced that the 20th anniversary tour was officially canceled.

===&quot;Divisive&quot; (2021–2024)===
Following a break, the band played its first pandemic-era live shows. The first one was the first time in nearly two years on September 25, 2021, as one of the headliners of the Louder Than Life festival in Louisville, Kentucky. The band also played later in November at the Welcome to Rockville festival at the Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida.

Draiman talked about the progress of the songwriting sessions for the band&#x27;s follow-up to 2018&#x27;s &quot;Evolution&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s on in a big, big, big fucking way. It really, really is. I mean, we are so genuinely excited.&quot; He also said that the new material is going back to their &quot;meat and potatoes&quot;, and that it is close to the vibe of &quot;The Sickness&quot; and &quot;Ten Thousand Fists&quot; albums. Draiman said that the band wants to begin recording after the New Year of 2022, but they have yet to announce a producer. The new songs will also be released on two separate mediums, as opposed to Disturbed&#x27;s usual album releases.

On July 14, 2022, Disturbed released a new single called &quot;Hey You&quot; from their upcoming album.

On September 23, 2022, the band announced their eighth album, entitled &quot;Divisive&quot;, with a promotional single &quot;Unstoppable&quot; being released. The album was released on November 18, 2022. The album is a concerted effort to move back toward the heavier sound of their early albums after experimenting on the prior album. The new album also became the first to include a guest vocalist, with Ann Wilson of hard rock band Heart lending vocals to the dark, heavy ballad &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot;.

On December 3, 2022, &quot;Divisive&quot; debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts at no. 3 on the Album Sales Chart, no. 3 on the Rock Album Chart, no. 1 on the Alternative Albums Chart, and no. 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 after spending a week at no. 1 on the Apple All-format Album Chart. Singles &quot;Bad Man&quot;, &quot;Unstoppable&quot;, and &quot;Hey You&quot; all appeared on the Mainstream Airplay Chart and album cuts &quot;Hey You&quot; (no. 2), &quot;Unstoppable&quot; (no. 1), &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; (no. 2), and &quot;Bad Man&quot; (no. 10) all appeared in the Top 10 of the Hard Rock Songs Digital Sales Chart. In 2024, &quot;Bad Man&quot; was nominated for the Best Metal Performance Grammy.
The band embarked on a tour in 2024 entitled the &quot;Take Back your Life&quot; tour. 

===&quot;The Sickness&quot; 25th Anniversary tour, and upcoming new album (2025-present)===
In October of 2024, Disturbed announced an upcoming 2025 American tour celebrating the 25th anniversary of &quot;The Sickness.&quot; The 34 date tour will run throughout the winter and spring of 2025 and feature support from Three Days Grace and Sevendust on the first leg and Daughtry and Nothing More on the second leg.

Disturbed released a new single, &quot;I Will Not Break&quot;, in February 2025. Draiman also stated that there is plenty of new music on the way from the band, leading up to the release of a new record.

==Other projects==
On February 8, 2012, it was announced that John Moyer was supergroup Adrenaline Mob&#x27;s new bass player. John made his onstage debut with the group on March 12, at New York City&#x27;s Hiro Ballroom, a day before the release of the band&#x27;s debut full-length album, &quot;Omertá&quot;. On February 14, 2012, on his Twitter account David Draiman confirmed that he would make an appearance on VH1&#x27;s &quot;That Metal Show&quot; 10th Season airing sometime that year. That episode was later moved to the 11th season and premiered on August 11, 2012.

In May 2012, Draiman announced his new project, an industrial metal band called Device. Draiman later released information regarding the future of Disturbed and his new project Device, stating that Device would release their self-titled debut album on April 9, 2013. The album features several guest musicians from various metal bands. On April 25, 2013, it was announced that guitarist Dan Donegan and drummer Mike Wengren had begun a new project with Evans Blue singer Dan Chandler, Fight or Flight. Their debut album, &quot;Life by Design?&quot; was released on July 23, 2013.

In December 2014, Moyer formed a new band with Scott Weiland, Ron &quot;Bumblefoot&quot; Thal, twins Jon and Vince Votta called Art of Anarchy, with a self-titled album released in June 2015. After the death of Weiland, the band recruited retired Creed singer Scott Stapp and recorded their second album &quot;The Madness&quot;, released in March 2017. In February 2018, Art of Anarchy members filed a lawsuit to the New York Supreme Court against Stapp for alleged failure to promote &quot;The Madness&quot;.

==Artistry==
===Musical style===
Disturbed is mostly classified as heavy metal, hard rock and alternative metal, while their early sound has been described as nu metal. In 2006, when asked about die-hard heavy metal fans not finding Disturbed heavy enough, Draiman stated:

Allmusic reviewer Bradley Torreano described the album &quot;Believe&quot; as &quot;taking the sort of jump that their heroes in Soundgarden and Pantera made after their respective breakthrough records&quot;. He also described the title track as moving &quot;from a brutal chug to a sweeping chorus that suddenly stops in its tracks and turns into a winding riff that recalls the work of vintage James Hetfield&quot;.
&quot;Believe&quot; is also considered by several critics to be a step away from the nu metal sound featured on &quot;The Sickness&quot;, moving towards a more hard rock and heavy metal sound that was continued in their following albums.

Guitarist Dan Donegan uses guitar tunings drop C, drop C#, and drop B (also occasionally E♭ standard), which are lower tunings than regular E standard. These lower tunings allow for a heavier sound and quicker chord changes in Donegan&#x27;s riffs. Donegan also uses subtle electronic effects, which the rest of the band refers to as &quot;The Danny Donegan Orchestra&quot;.
=== Lyrics ===
According to frontman David Draiman on the band home documentary &quot;M.O.L.&quot;, the lyrics that he writes are inspired by actual experiences of his own, and he stated that he likes to present his ideas with cryptic lyrics.
These lyrical themes range from the Judeo-Christian concept of Heaven and Hell, domestic abuse, suicide, insanity, relationships, war, to more fantastical themes, such as vampirism, werewolves and demons. Many of the band&#x27;s post-hiatus releases have featured political lyrics.

=== Influences ===
They have often cited their influences as Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Metallica, Pantera, Iron Maiden, Queensrÿche, and Soundgarden. Draiman&#x27;s main influences came from funk-infused bands such as Faith No More, and he expresses much admiration for Faith No More singer Mike Patton.

=== Mascot ===
Disturbed&#x27;s mascot, named &quot;The Guy&quot;, was originally a drawing of a face with a large grin, as seen on the back of the album &quot;The Sickness&quot;. The original drawing of The Guy was then edited using a digital distorting program. After the original image had been distorted three times, The Guy became the band&#x27;s official mascot. Later, he would be drawn as a full figure by artist David Finch.

<text>The Sickness is the debut studio album by American heavy metal band Disturbed. It was released on March 7, 2000, by Giant and Reprise Records. The album peaked at number 29 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and spent a total of 106 weeks on the chart. It was Disturbed&#x27;s only album to not hit number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 until their seventh album &quot;Evolution&quot; debuted at number 4 in 2018. In 2018, &quot;The Sickness&quot; was certified five times platinum by the RIAA for shipments of over five million copies in the US, making it the band&#x27;s most successful album.

== Background and recording ==
&quot;The Sickness&quot; was Disturbed&#x27;s first studio release since the band&#x27;s formation in 1994. Reflecting on the band&#x27;s early days, lead vocalist David Draiman said in a 2015 interview, &quot;People think it was like this meteoric rise. It really wasn&#x27;t. We beat the hell out of ourselves for two or three years as a local band, our own self-promotional mega-machine, every band member in a different venue of the city every time a rock show would come through town, passing out our promotional material — cassettes, stickers, t-shirts, whatever we could. [This was] in addition to playing strategically where we thought it made sense and in addition to building our following on the south side of Chicago. So there was a long period of time before that and a lot of struggle in a city that wasn&#x27;t conducive to hard rock and heavy metal. Chicago was an alternative town. It was Smashing Pumpkins, Local H. It was not metal. So we were blacklisted. We couldn&#x27;t even play inner-city clubs. We weren&#x27;t cool enough. We were too metal. That was something that wasn&#x27;t considered cool enough. We had to force our way in.&quot;

However, as the late 1990s brought a shift in focus in the rock industry toward a heavier sound, the band secured a record deal with Giant Records and Disturbed got their big break. Prior to the album&#x27;s recording, the band sought to refine its sound. Lead guitarist Dan Donegan took a different approach than usual and adopted a style that did not incorporate guitar solos: &quot;In the beginning, before we were even signed, I&#x27;d solo all over the place and it didn&#x27;t really work, so I pretty much cut out the solos altogether until the last album or two. That&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s worked with us. Over time we&#x27;ve pushed each other to become better musicians,&quot; Donegan said in a 2011 interview with &quot;Guitar World&quot;.

According to Draiman, it was challenging for him to become comfortable with writing about the personal themes contained throughout the album&#x27;s lyrics, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s very frightening. Because here you go, you&#x27;ve decided to be open and bare a part of your soul to these people, and lay it out on a platter for them to observe. So until you know that the listeners are getting any part of what you&#x27;re saying, it&#x27;s incredibly frightening.&quot;

With Draiman on vocals and Donegan on guitar, the two were joined by Mike Wengren on drums and Steve &quot;Fuzz&quot; Kmak on bass. Seeking help with the album&#x27;s production process, the band turned to producer Johnny K, who had gone to high school with Donegan&#x27;s brother. By the time work on the album had started, a bond had already formed and Johnny K had begun working with the band as the producer for their album. In an interview with &quot;Guitar Edge&quot;, Johnny K spoke about the process, saying, &quot;They fought hard to get me to do their record. They didn&#x27;t want to go to L.A. and make a record that wouldn&#x27;t be any better than their demos. I felt that with a budget and time, I could make a record everyone would really like [...] I pushed them as hard as I could, and we felt successful before it sold one copy. All of that hard work, and the fact that they are such a good band, made it easy for me to get other jobs. People liked it and would say, &#x27;Who did the Disturbed album? Let&#x27;s get him.&#x27;&quot;

Recording sessions took place in late 1999, and on March 7, 2000, &quot;The Sickness&quot; was released; however, the album was not an instant success. The lead single from the album, &quot;Stupify&quot;, was released in April 2000. &quot;[It] was actually a hard sell at radio,&quot; Draiman said. &quot;It&#x27;s not like it shot up. They worked it. Giant Records at the time, they worked it. They pushed it to where it got enough awareness that it did start to chart decently.&quot; The track addressed themes of racism and discrimination, loosely based on one of Draiman&#x27;s own experiences. It would go on to reach No. 12 on the Mainstream Rock chart and No. 10 on Modern Rock and remains one of their most popular songs. It was followed by the singles &quot;Down with the Sickness&quot; in October of the same year, &quot;Voices&quot; the following November, and &quot;The Game&quot; in February 2001.

== Reissues ==
=== 10th anniversary ===
On March 23, 2010, a reissue of the album was released that was remastered, slightly remixed and includes B-sides, new artwork, and exclusive online content. This reissue celebrates the tenth anniversary of the release of the album and is available for the first time in Standard Black vinyl format.

Disturbed&#x27;s guitarist, Dan Donegan, commented on the reissue: &quot;[...] it&#x27;s the album that put us on the map and launched our career. So we went back into the studio and we remixed it, we&#x27;re having it remastered, we&#x27;re gonna put a couple of bonus tracks on there and touch up some of the packaging and the artwork. Just a little collector&#x27;s item, a little tribute to that album for the fans&quot;.

The two songs included in the reissue, &quot;God of the Mind&quot; and &quot;A Welcome Burden&quot;, are also included in a B-side compilation called &quot;The Lost Children&quot;.

=== 20th anniversary ===
In January 2020, Disturbed announced that they were going on tour for &quot;The Sickness 20th Anniversary Tour&quot; with Staind and Bad Wolves. The tour was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. &quot;The Sickness&quot; was re-released to mark the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary. It includes all of the original songs remastered and live versions of the songs. &quot;The Sickness 20th Anniversary Tour&quot; was rescheduled for July and September 2021 but was once again canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions.

== Critical reception ==

The album received positive reviews upon release. Steve Huey from AllMusic commented &quot;But even if it has a few less-than-compelling moments, &quot;The Sickness&quot; overall comes off as the work of a band who really doesn&#x27;t have far to go to achieve total control of its sound and compositional skills, and that makes it a terrific debut album.&quot;

In 2013, &quot;Loudwire&quot; featured &quot;The Sickness&quot; in their &quot;Top 25 Debut Hard Rock Albums&quot; list, placing the album at number 24. In 2020, it was named one of the 20 best metal albums of 2000 by &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; magazine. In 2021, the album was put on the list of the Revolver magazine &quot;20 Essential Nu-Metal Albums&quot;.

== Soundtrack appearances ==

* &quot;The Game&quot; appeared in the English adaptation of &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Cooler&#x27;s Revenge&quot;.

The &quot;Guitar Hero 5&quot;, &quot;Rock Band 2&quot;, and &quot;Fortnite Festival&quot; versions have the &quot;abuse&quot; segment intact, however, all profane language was removed. &quot;Guitar Hero Live&quot; also features this song in the GH On Demand feature of the game, however as the music video version of the song is the version that is used, the &quot;abuse&quot; segment is not featured. Professional wrestler Christopher Chri$ Ca$h Bauman also used &quot;Down with the Sickness&quot; as his theme song from 2001–2005 in CZW until his death in an automobile accident on August 18, 2005. As of 2005, Combat Zone Wrestling annually run a memorial tribute event for Bauman titled &quot;Down with the Sickness&quot; after his theme song. The show originally started as a double header afternoon show, with another CZW event taking place later in the evening.

<doc id="177387" wikidata="Q188108" url="?curid=177387" title="Believe (Disturbed album)">
<text>Believe is the second studio album by American heavy metal band Disturbed, released on September 17, 2002 via Reprise Records. Produced by the band and Johnny K, it focuses heavily on religious and spiritual themes inspired by recent tragedies. With greater emphases on melodic dynamics, it also demonstrates a broadening in the band&#x27;s musical range compared to their 2000 debut &quot;The Sickness&quot;. &quot;Believe&quot; was the last studio album to feature original bassist Steve &quot;Fuzz&quot; Kmak before he was fired from the band in 2003.

&quot;Believe&quot; debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making it Disturbed&#x27;s first number one debut, selling over 284,000 copies in its first week of sales. It was certified double platinum by the RIAA in the United States on September 23, 2008. Three singles were released from the album: &quot;Prayer&quot;, &quot;Remember&quot;, and &quot;Liberate&quot;.

==Background and recording==
With Black Sabbath&#x27;s August 2001 tour canceled, and Disturbed&#x27;s opening slot with it, the Chicago quartet planned to use the month following Ozzfest to begin pre-production of their next album while preparing for their own headlining tour.

That summer, vocalist David Draiman&#x27;s grandfather, an Orthodox Jew, died in Israel. At a young age, Draiman was beloved by his grandfather; however, when Draiman became a heavy metal musician, his elder cut off their communication. It was not until the grandfather fell ill that he wished to see his grandson. But by the time word got to Draiman, who was on Ozzfest, his grandfather had mere hours to live. Regarding his grandfather&#x27;s death, he noted, &quot;No one could look at the aura I projected over the course of that next week and not feel my pain and those feelings very definitely will present themselves on the record.&quot;

That same month, Draiman had undergone surgery to remove a damaged valve that was causing acid to spill on his vocal cords. The successful surgery not only repaired Draiman&#x27;s voice but also allegedly broadened his vocal range.

The band entered K&#x27;s Groovemaster Studios in mid March 2002 to begin recording with producer Johnny K, the man behind their debut album. The majority of songs, which reportedly included about 10 at the time, had been written since November the previous year, including &quot;Prayer&quot; which debuted during Ozzfest.

By mid-April, Disturbed had completed 12 songs for &quot;Believe&quot;. In an interview with MTV, Draiman elaborated how the reevaluating of his own Jewish heritage and compromises of life as a musician affected his writing. He noted the album as being &quot;the greatest work we have ever done in our lives&quot; but also expressed concern over how fans would react to the vulnerability and vast expression of emotions showcased on the album.

==Music and lyrics==
As &quot;The Sickness&quot;, &quot;Believe&quot; has been described as nu metal, but stylistically it witnessed the band place more emphases on lead guitar and melodic complexity. This musical progression would follow through on future Disturbed albums where guitar solos would become commonplace. While &quot;The Sickness&quot; focused on heavy compositions, Disturbed&#x27;s sophomore effort varies more greatly in its range of heaviness and melody, closing with a somber, acoustic ballad entitled &quot;Darkness.&quot; Singer David Draiman also wished to demonstrate a greater vocal dimension than the intense style he was previously associated with. Nevertheless, he described the content of the album as &quot;pure and unadulterated in every sense of the word &#x27;metal&#x27;.&quot;

As noted by Draiman, &quot;Believe&quot; contains overt religious and spiritual themes. These were inspired by various experiences such as the September 11 attacks and the recent death of Draiman&#x27;s Orthodox Jewish grandfather: 
:&quot;All the songs on the record revolve around the theme of belief in oneself and in humanity&#x27;s potential. . . And the right-wing reactions of religious leaders of the world to the events of 9/11 had a lot to do with the original impetus of where this record came from. It angered me beyond any way I could possibly explain. The whole album&#x27;s about questioning your beliefs to determine what you really can believe in.&quot;

Lyrically, the album deals with various other topics as well. &quot;Remember&quot; delves into the cutthroat nature of the music industry as well as Draiman&#x27;s resistance to indulgent partying; &quot;Awaken&quot; deals with America&#x27;s never-ending obsession with vacuous &quot;wallpaper music&quot;; the tracks &quot;Bound&quot; and &quot;Intoxication&quot; focus on Draiman&#x27;s inability to have a meaningful romantic relationship. In an interview, he noted, &quot;I&#x27;ve had various experiences with women over the past two-and-a-half years that have made me have several chips on my shoulder - not in an angry way necessarily, but almost in a pleading way. I&#x27;m at a point in my life where I&#x27;ve had my heart torn apart so many times that there&#x27;s just not much left to it.&quot;

In keeping with the lyrical themes, the album cover features symbols of major religions, including the Jewish Star of David, the Islamic crescent, the Wiccan pentacle, and the Christian cross. 
Draiman explained the meaning of the symbol on stage during the Music as a Weapon II Tour:
: &quot;The symbol that you see elevated above the set behind me is a symbol of universal belief.&quot;

==Touring and promotion==
&quot;Believe&quot; boasted three singles which gained substantial radio and video airplay. The lead single, &quot;Prayer&quot;, featured a video with apocalyptic imagery of a city being destroyed. This led some outlets to refuse to play the video on the grounds that it conjures similarities to the September 11 attacks. After initially considering to edit the video, Disturbed ultimately chose not to. Follow up singles &quot;Remember&quot; and &quot;Liberate&quot; also charted well and gained significant rotation on radio and television. The title track &quot;Believe,&quot; although not a single, would also find its way to radio airwaves.

In 2003, Disturbed headlined &quot;Music as a Weapon II&quot; with Chevelle, Taproot, and Ünloco. A live album, featuring Disturbed&#x27;s cover of &quot;Fade to Black&quot;, would result in 2004. Upon finishing the tour, Steve Kmak was fired by the band because of &quot;personality differences&quot;. He was soon replaced by John Moyer, and the group joined the Main Stage of Ozzfest 2003.

&quot;Liberate&quot; appeared on the soundtrack for the video game &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground 2&quot;. &quot;Intoxication&quot; appeared on the soundtrack for &quot;NFL GameDay 2004&quot;.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Believe&quot; currently holds a score of 62 out of 100 on review-aggregating website Metacritic, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;, based on nine reviews. AllMusic&#x27;s Bradley Torreano praised the album, declaring that on &quot;Believe&quot;, Disturbed takes the kind of leap that their heroes in Soundgarden and Pantera had after their respective albums of progress. He also states that &quot;it is not a function of the agitation of the tempo and percussion-based riffing of the past; guitarist Dan Donegan has made great strides in expanding its sound to include more varied guitar work all around.&quot; Greg Cot from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the record &quot;a skillful, if calculated, variation on the melodrama-meets-mayhem formula that has been driving the most commercially successful new metal in recent years,&quot; praising Andy Wallace&#x27;s mixing of Wengren&#x27;s drumming for having &quot;a John Bonham-like prominence&quot; and Donegan&#x27;s guitar work for having the feel of &quot;a percussive hammer.&quot; Ben Mitchell of &quot;Blender&quot; gave credit to the band for doing away any idiosyncratic vocal work and rap metal flourishes from their debut effort for more political topics and highlighted both Donegan&#x27;s guitar line as well as Draiman&#x27;s melodic delivery, saying that &quot;Musically, &quot;Believe&quot; is as solid as this kind of generic support-slot-on-Ozzfest stuff gets and — thank Christ — at least there’s no DJ.&quot; He concluded that &quot;Overwhelmingly, though, Disturbed have yet to come to terms with just how average they really are — seldom unlistenable, never inspirational, but consistently merely OK.&quot; Culturedose.net cited &quot;Believe&quot; as &quot;one of the best rock albums of 2002&quot;. In 2005, &quot;Believe&quot; was ranked number 429 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Believe&quot; debuted at number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, making it Disturbed&#x27;s first number 1 debut, and shipped over 284,000 copies in its first week. The album also debuted at number 2 on the Canadian Albums Chart, selling 13,400 copies in the country in its first week.

By January 2003, SoundScan had recorded over 1 million album sales. The record was certified double platinum by the RIAA in the United States on September 23, 2008.

<text>Princess Beatrice, Mrs Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (Beatrice Elizabeth Mary; born 8 August 1988) is a member of the British royal family. She is the elder daughter of Prince Andrew, Duke of York, and Sarah, Duchess of York. She is a niece of King Charles III. Born fifth in line of succession to the British throne, she is now ninth.

Beatrice attended St George&#x27;s School, Ascot, before studying at Goldsmiths College, graduating with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history. She was briefly employed at the Foreign Office and Sony Pictures before joining software company Afiniti as Vice President of Strategic Partnerships. Beatrice also works privately with a number of charitable organisations, including the Teenage Cancer Trust and Outward Bound. She married Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, a property developer and English-born Italian noble, in 2020. The couple have two daughters, Sienna and Athena.

== Early life and education==

Princess Beatrice was born at 8:18 pm on 8 August 1988 at the Portland Hospital in London, the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York, and fifth grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. She was baptised in the Chapel Royal at St James&#x27;s Palace on 20 December 1988, her godparents being Viscount Linley (her father&#x27;s cousin, now the 2nd Earl of Snowdon); the Duchess of Roxburghe (now Lady Jane Dawnay); Peter Palumbo; Gabrielle Greenall; and Carolyn Cotterell. Her name, an unexpected choice, was not announced until almost two weeks after her birth. Her younger sister, Princess Eugenie, was born in 1990.

Beatrice&#x27;s parents divorced amicably when she was seven years old and agreed to joint custody of their two children. After the divorce, the Queen provided her parents with £1.4 million to set up a trust fund for her and Eugenie. Beatrice and her sister frequently travelled abroad always with one or both of their parents.

Beatrice began her early education at the independent Upton House School in Windsor, in 1991. She and her sister then attended the independent Coworth Park School (now Coworth Flexlands School). Beatrice continued her education at the independent St George&#x27;s School in Ascot, where she was a pupil from 2000 to 2007. She was diagnosed with dyslexia at the age of seven and went public with the diagnosis in 2005. She delayed sitting her GCSE exams for one year. She remained at St George&#x27;s to take her A-Levels, earning an &#x27;A&#x27; in drama, a &#x27;B&#x27; in history, and a &#x27;B&#x27; in film studies. She was elected Head Girl in her final year, and was a member of the school choir. Beatrice celebrated her 18th birthday with a masked ball at Windsor Castle in July 2006. Nikolai von Bismarck took her official birthday portrait.

In September 2008, Beatrice started a three-year course studying for a BA in history and history of ideas at Goldsmiths, University of London. She graduated in 2011 with a 2:1 degree.

== Career ==
During the summer of 2008, Beatrice obtained work experience as a sales assistant at Selfridges. She also worked at the Foreign Office&#x27;s press office for a period of time without receiving a salary. It was also reported in 2008 that Beatrice was interested in pursuing a career at the &quot;Financial Times&quot; website. Beatrice was the first member of the family to appear in a non-documentary film when she had a small, non-speaking role as an extra in &quot;The Young Victoria&quot; (2009), based on the accession and early reign of her ancestor Queen Victoria. For a while, she was a paid intern at Sony Pictures, but she resigned after the hacking incident that affected the company in late 2014.

In April 2015, it was reported that Beatrice had decided to move to New York City. , Beatrice had a full-time job and split her time between London and New York City. She is known as Beatrice York in her professional life and is Vice President of Partnerships and Strategy at Afiniti. She is also in charge of an Afiniti programme to engage senior business chiefs around the world to support women in leadership. She works with the programme through charity endeavours and speaking engagements.

In January 2022, it was reported that Beatrice had lost her taxpayer-funded police security in 2011, supposedly after her uncle Charles III (then Prince of Wales) intervened.

== Duties and appointments ==
Beatrice and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh accompanied Queen Elizabeth II to the traditional Royal Maundy services on 5 April 2012 in York. There, Beatrice interacted with parishioners, received flowers from the public, and assisted the Queen as she passed out the Maundy money to the pensioners. In the lead up to the 2012 Summer Olympics, Beatrice welcomed the Olympic flame on the steps of Harewood House near Leeds. In 2013, Beatrice and her sister promoted Britain overseas in Germany. She visited the Isle of Wight in 2014, whose governor had been Beatrice&#x27;s namesake Princess Beatrice, daughter of Queen Victoria. She accompanied her father during an official engagement in the United Arab Emirates on 24 November 2014.

On 17 September 2022, during the period of official mourning for Queen Elizabeth II, Beatrice joined her sister and six cousins to mount a 15-minute vigil around the coffin of the late Queen, as it lay in state at Westminster Hall. On 19 September, she joined other family members at the state funeral.

Upon the accession of Charles III, her position in the line of succession made Beatrice eligible to be appointed a Counsellor of State. In this role she can potentially carry out official duties while the monarch is abroad or unwell.

== Personal life ==

===Early relationships===
In 2006, Beatrice was briefly in a relationship with Paolo Liuzzo, an American whose previous charge for assault and battery caused controversy at the time. For ten years, until July 2016, she was in a relationship with Virgin Galactic businessman Dave Clark.

===Marriage and family===
In March 2019, Beatrice attended a fundraising event at the National Portrait Gallery, London, accompanied by property developer Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, the son of Alex Mapelli-Mozzi, a British-Italian Olympic alpine skier. The title of Count was awarded to all legitimate male-line descendants of the Mapelli Mozzi family in 1913 by King Victor Emmanuel III of the Kingdom of Italy; however, the title is not officially recognised in the Republic of Italy or the UK.
The couple are believed to have begun dating in September 2018. Together, they attended the May 2019 wedding of Lady Gabriella Windsor, Beatrice&#x27;s second cousin once removed.

Princess Beatrice and Mozzi became engaged in Italy in September 2019, with their engagement formally announced by the Duke of York&#x27;s Office on 26 September.

The wedding was scheduled to take place on 29 May 2020 at the Chapel Royal at St James&#x27;s Palace, followed by a private reception in the gardens of Buckingham Palace, but first the reception and then the wedding itself were postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The wedding was eventually held in private on 17 July 2020, at the Royal Chapel of All Saints, Royal Lodge, Windsor, and was not publicly announced in advance. Her father&#x27;s friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, an American financier and convicted sex offender who was charged with sex trafficking of minors who died in prison, greatly impacted her wedding plans. After Prince Andrew&#x27;s subsequent BBC interview, he was retired from royal duties and her wedding arrangements were scaled down; he walked her down the aisle, but he did not appear in the official wedding portraits released by Buckingham Palace. Her wedding dress was a remodelled Norman Hartnell dress that was lent by the Queen, and she wore the Queen Mary Fringe Tiara that was also worn by the Queen at her own wedding.

Princess Beatrice has a stepson, Christopher Woolf (&quot;Wolfie&quot;), her husband&#x27;s child from a relationship with architect Dara Huang. She gave birth to a daughter, Sienna Elizabeth Mapelli Mozzi, on 18 September 2021 at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in Chelsea, London. At birth, Sienna was eleventh in line to the throne, and following the death of Queen Elizabeth II on 8 September 2022, she became tenth in line.

Sienna was christened at the Chapel Royal at St James&#x27;s Palace, on 29 April 2022. Beatrice and her husband lived at first in a four-bedroom apartment at St James&#x27;s Palace, but reportedly moved to a manor house in the Cotswolds in late 2022.

Beatrice gave birth to a second daughter, Athena Elizabeth Rose Mapelli Mozzi, on 22 January 2025 at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London, several weeks prematurely. Athena is eleventh in line to the throne.

== Charity work ==
In 2002, Beatrice visited children living with HIV in Russia. In Britain, she supported Springboard for Children (a literacy project for primary-school children with learning difficulties) and the Teenage Cancer Trust. In an interview to mark her 18th birthday, Beatrice said she wanted to use her position to assist others through charity work; she had already undertaken charitable duties alongside her mother through the various organisations the Duchess supported.
In April 2010, running to raise money for Children in Crisis, she became the first member of the royal family to complete the London Marathon. Beatrice is the patron of Forget Me Not Children&#x27;s Hospice, which supports children with life-shortening conditions in West Yorkshire and North Manchester. At the April 2011 wedding of her cousin Prince William, Beatrice&#x27;s unusual fascinator, designed by Philip Treacy, received much attention and derision from the public and the media. The following month, the headpiece was auctioned for £81,000 on eBay, with the proceeds going to two charities: UNICEF and Children in Crisis.
In November 2012, Beatrice became a patron of the York Musical Society. In April 2013, she became royal patron of the Helen Arkell Dyslexia Centre, a charity that she credits with helping her overcome her own academic challenges resulting from dyslexia.

In 2016, Beatrice, her mother, and her sister Eugenie collaborated with British contemporary artist Teddy McDonald to create the first royal contemporary art painting. Titled &quot;Royal Love&quot;, it was painted at Royal Lodge and exhibited at Masterpiece London before being sold with all proceeds from the sale donated by McDonald to Children in Crisis. In 2018, Children in Crisis merged with Street Child, a children&#x27;s charity active in multiple countries, with Beatrice serving as its ambassador. She is also a supporter of the Pitch@Palace initiative, a charity her father founded to amplify and accelerate entrepreneurs&#x27; business ideas.

Beatrice took part in a South Asia Tour 2016 that lasted nine days. She visited Nepal, India, and Bhutan on behalf of the Franks Family Foundation (FFF), and Jamgon Kongtrul Eyes Centres, a free micro-surgical cataract programme in technical collaboration with Nepal&#x27;s Tilganga Eye Centre under Nepali eye surgeon Sanduk Ruit&#x27;s direction. A few weeks later, she attended the 2016 Asia Game Changer Awards Dinner at the United Nations in New York City, which honoured Ruit and others. Beatrice and Charles Rockefeller presented Ruit with his Asia Society Asia Game Changer award.
Beatrice is the founder of Big Change, a charity she established with six of her friends to encourage young people to develop skills &quot;outside a traditional academic curriculum&quot;. In 2012, she climbed Mont Blanc in aid of the charity. In 2016, with Richard Branson and his children, she participated in the fundraising challenge Virgin Strive Challenge, which involved climbing Mount Etna.

In 2017, Beatrice helped promote the anti-bullying book &quot;Be Cool Be Nice&quot; and gave an interview to &quot;Vogue&quot; at a House of Lords event, speaking about her own experiences with being bullied for her fashion choices in her early adulthood. &quot;Hello!&quot; magazine later named her one of the best-dressed royals. In May 2018, she attended the Met Gala in New York City. In October 2018, she undertook an extended tour of Laos to &quot;raise the profile of the UK&quot; there, and also participated in the Luang Prabang Half Marathon for Children.

In March 2019, Beatrice was elected to the board of the UK charity the Outward Bound Trust as a trustee, after her father took over the patronage from his father, the Duke of Edinburgh. In May 2019, she was honoured at a gala in New York City for her work with Friends Without a Border. She has supported the Kairos HQ, a non-profit organisation of entrepreneurs at universities in China, Europe, India and the US.

In April 2022 and in her capacity as an ambassador for the charity Made By Dyslexia, Beatrice and her husband took part in the first World Dyslexia Assembly, which was hosted by Prince Carl Philip in Sweden.

In February 2023, Beatrice was named patron of the British Skin Foundation.

<text>AM General is an American heavy vehicle and contract automotive manufacturer based in South Bend, Indiana. It is best known for the civilian Hummer and the military Humvee that are assembled in Mishawaka, Indiana. From 1974–1979 the company also manufactured transit buses, making more than 5,400 of them.

AM General has also been a provider of vehicles for the CUCV program carried out by the United States Armed Forces.

== History ==
=== Beginning ===
AM General traces its roots to the Standard Wheel Company of Terre Haute, Indiana, which expanded in 1903 to include the Overland Automotive Division. In 1908, John North Willys purchased the Overland company, then based in Indianapolis, Indiana, and renamed it Willys-Overland Motors. In 1941, the U.S. Army awarded a contract to Willys-Overland Motor Company to produce the Willys MB, also known as the Jeep, for the US Infantry. It then mass-produced that vehicle as &quot;America&#x27;s first four-wheel-drive, one-fourth-ton, tactical utility truck&quot;—the Jeep of World War II fame. 

In 1953, Kaiser Motors purchased Willys-Overland, changing its name first to Kaiser-Willys Motor Company, and in 1963, to Kaiser-Jeep Corporation. In 1970, it was purchased by American Motors Corporation (AMC). In July 2020, KPS Capital Partners acquired the company.

=== Defense and Government Products Division ===
In 1964, Kaiser-Jeep purchased the Studebaker facilities on Chippewa Avenue in South Bend, Indiana, which included Studebaker&#x27;s &quot;General Products Division&quot;, along with its substantial defense contracts.

At the time, Kaiser had been awarded a US$87 million Army truck contract, and under government pressure, agreed to perform the work at the South Bend plant it had recently acquired from Studebaker.

=== American Motors ===
In 1970, American Motors Corporation (AMC) purchased the Jeep Corporation from Kaiser, when Kaiser decided to leave the auto business.

In 1971, AMC made the General Products Division of Jeep (producing military trucks as well as contract and non-commercial vehicles) a wholly owned subsidiary and renamed it &quot;AM General Corporation&quot;.

In 1982, American Motors ceased to function as an independent automaker, when Renault purchased a controlling interest.

US government regulations at that time forbade ownership of defense contractors by foreign governments—and Renault was partially owned by the French government.

=== LTV Corporation ===
In 1983, LTV Corporation bought AM General and established it as a wholly owned subsidiary. In 1984, its headquarters moved from the American Motors AMTEK Building in Detroit, Michigan, to Livonia, Michigan, and two years later to South Bend, Indiana, where primary manufacturing operations were located.

=== Renco Group ===
In 1992, AM General was sold to Renco Group, which in 2002 converted it to a limited liability company.

=== Hummer brand ===
In 1984, AM General built a factory at 13200 McKinley Hwy in Mishawaka, for HMMWV production.

In 1992, AM General began marketing the HMMWV to the civilian market under the Hummer brand. In 1999, GM acquired the rights to the brand and continued production of the original civilian Hummer as the H1 until June 2006.

In 2002, the Hummer H2 went on the market, and was produced until January 2009. It was designed and marketed by GM, and manufactured by AM General at the Mishawaka plant. AM General did not build the H3 model.

GM was sued early in 2003 by DaimlerChrysler, owners of the Jeep brand, for the resemblance of the Hummer&#x27;s seven-slot grille to Jeep&#x27;s. The lawsuit was dismissed after acknowledgment of the shared corporate history of AMC and Jeep. GM in turn sued boutique automaker Avanti Motor Corporation of Cancun, Mexico after it introduced the Studebaker XUV at the Chicago Auto show in 2002. GM said Avanti infringed on the Hummer looks by planning a vehicle that closely resembled the Hummer. It seemed the AM General Hummer line had gone full circle back to the original Studebaker General Products Division which was responsible for all military contracts.

=== 2004–present ===
In August 2004, it was announced that Ronald Perelman&#x27;s MacAndrews &amp; Forbes company would form a joint venture with AM General&#x27;s then-owner, Renco Group, to give Perelman 70% ownership. The deal reportedly cost close to US$1 billion.

In 2008, AM General and the Vehicle Production Group (VPG), of Troy, Michigan, announced that contracts had been signed for AM General to begin producing purpose-built taxi-cabs in 2009. Production began in October 2011. The first vehicle off the line was presented to Marc Buoniconti, a former linebacker for The Citadel who was partially paralyzed in 1985.

In May 2010, Azure Dynamics announced it had chosen AM General to assemble its electric drivetrain for Ford Transit Connect vehicles for the North American market at its Livonia, Michigan, factory.

In September 2013, AM General reached an agreement to purchase the United States Department of Energy&#x27;s secured loan to the Vehicle Production Group (VPG). Prior to this, AM General acted as the sole vehicle assembler for VPG. As a result of this transaction, AM General created a wholly owned company, Mobility Ventures LLC, to operate the Mobility Vehicle-1 (MV-1) business and receive all VPG assets.

In 2015, production of the Mercedes-Benz R-Class began at the Mishawaka assembly plant. Without this deal, &quot;the German automaker would likely have had to shut down production of the vehicle, currently only sold in China.&quot; Production ended in October 2017.

In July 2020, investment company KPS Capital Partners acquired AM General from its previous owner, MacAndrews &amp; Forbes.

AM General submitted a prototype to become the United States Postal Service&#x27;s Next Generation Delivery Vehicle, but their entry was not chosen.

== Products ==
=== Jeep Dispatcher 100 ===

Another familiar product from the AM General line was the Jeep DJ-5 series—a purpose-built &quot;Dispatch Jeep&quot; 2-wheel drive (RWD) version of the Jeep CJ-5—used in huge numbers as a right-hand drive mail delivery vehicle by the United States Postal Service.

=== Buses ===
The AM General Metropolitan buses were manufactured for city transit use from 1974 until 1979, producing a total of 5,431 buses, including 219 electric trolley buses. The Metropolitan was built under a 1971 agreement with Flyer Industries of Winnipeg, Manitoba. AM General licensed the rights to build and market the Western Flyer D700 for the US market. The D700 itself was similar in design to the contemporaneous GM New Look buses. 

The front end of the D700 was restyled, and thus the resulting Metropolitan was not simply a Flyer design built under license but rather a jointly designed vehicle. Flyer later adopted the design changes for its own line as the models D800 and E800. Buses were built in lengths of either or , and widths of or . 

The model numbers reflected the chosen dimensions. For example, model &quot;10240&quot; indicated a 102-inch wide, 40-foot long bus. Suffixes &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot; were used for later models to indicate certain options. In total, 3,571 40-foot diesel buses and 1,641 35-foot diesel buses were produced.

=== Articulated buses ===
In 1977–1979, AM General worked under a partnership with MAN of Germany to build SG 220 articulated buses for US transit systems. MAN fabricated the bodyshells in Germany and shipped them to the US for AM General for final assembly. Two different lengths were offered, and . 93 buses were built to the shorter length and the rest were 60 feet long. In October 1978, the company discontinued bus production, with the last unit completed in March 1979. The total number built was just under 400 (392 or 399), the largest group being 150 for Seattle&#x27;s Metro Transit. MAN subsequently set up its own factory for US production in Cleveland, North Carolina.

=== Trolleybuses ===
Production of complete motor buses (and of any two-axle motor buses) ended in 1978. Aside from the fitting-out of the last articulated MAN shells, the only production in 1979 was two batches of trolleybuses, the only such vehicles ever built by the company. These were all vehicles, model 10240T: 110 trackless trolleys for the Philadelphia trolleybus system, operated by SEPTA, and 109 for the Seattle trolleybus system, operated by Metro Transit, now King County Metro. One of the latter has been preserved since its retirement in 2003 by King County Metro (see King County Metro fleet).

== Development and production of the HMMWV ==
In 1979, AM General began preliminary design work on the M998 Series High Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle HMMWV, pronounced Humvee, a 1.25-ton truck intended to replace the M151 and other Light Utility Vehicles. In 1981, the US Army awarded AM General a prototype contract. In 1982, development and operational testing was conducted over a five-month period. In March 1983, AM General won an initial $1.2 billion contract to produce 55,000 Humvees, to be delivered in five basic models and 15 different configurations over a five-year period.

In the fall of 1984, production began at the Mishawaka, Indiana, assembly plant. In early 1985, the first deliveries were made. The total international production by mid-1991 was more than 72,000. After 1991, an additional 20,000 HMMWVs ordered brought total international production to 100,000 in March 1995.

Late in 2000, AM General was awarded another contract for 2,962 M998A2 series trucks. The contract contained six single-year options running to the fiscal year 2007 and continues to be renewed. Nearly 250,000 units have been produced.

Humvees feature full-time four-wheel drive, an independent suspension, steep approach and departure angles, 60-percent grade ability and of ground clearance. More recent production models include the M1151, M1152, M1165, and M1167. As of 2015, Humvees are in use by the US Army, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Navy. The combined fleet numbers 140,000. More than 50 nations have bought these vehicles.

=== Replacement ===
The Humvee&#x27;s replacement, a completely new Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) design, has been in production by Oshkosh Corporation since 2016. AM General was unsuccessful in its bid for this $30-billion 25-year contract, and it is now focused on military Humvee support (they still outnumber JLTVs by three to one) and development of a new ambulance model.

In February 2023, the US Army granted AM General a production contract worth more than $8.66bn to deliver next-generation JLTV A2 vehicles, under the US Army and the US Marine Corps’ Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) programme.

Under the contract, AM General will produce approximately 20,682 JLTV vehicles and 9,883 trailers. The contract includes the integration of technological enhancements for delivery to the US Armed Forces.

Oshkosh Defense won the initial contract to supply its JLTV vehicles for the program.

== Other military vehicles ==
AM General also acquired Department of Defense contracts for medium and heavy trucks, including the M151 series, 2 1/2 ton M35 series, and 5 ton M809 series in the 1970s, then the M939 series in the 1980s.

In 2005, AM General was contracted to take over militarization, sales, and marketing of LSSV vehicles.

<text>Bull riding is a rodeo sport that involves a rider getting on a bucking bull and attempting to stay mounted while the animal tries to buck off the rider.

American bull riding has been called &quot;the most dangerous eight seconds in sports.&quot; To receive a score, the rider must stay on top of the bull for eight seconds with the use of one hand gripped on a bull rope tied behind the bull&#x27;s forelegs. Touching the bull or themselves with the free hand, or failing to reach the eight-second mark, results in a no-score ride. Depending on the bull riding organization and the contest, up to four judges might judge the rider and four judge the bull on their performance. For most organizations, a perfect score is 100 points. In general, most professional riders score in the neighborhood of the mid-70s to the high 80s.

Outside of the United States, bull riding traditions with varying rules and histories also exist in Canada, Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Puerto Rico, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, South Africa, the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand with the majority of them following similar rules, especially with the Professional Bull Riders (PBR) organization.

==History==
The taming of bulls has ancient roots in contests dating as far back as Minoan culture. Bull riding itself has its direct roots in Mexican contests of equestrian, ranching and bullfighting skills now collectively known as charreada. During the 18th century, and probably before, Mexican bullfights consisted of traditional native games and exercises, different from those in Spain, which included roping, saddling and riding a bull like a horse, until it stopped bucking. In —&quot;Rusticatio Mexicana&quot; (1782)— Jesuit priest, Rafael Landivar, vividly described in epic verse, the riding of the bull during a traditional bullfight, including how another bull is let loose to confront the bull being ridden: Sometimes a bull of great corpulence, remarkable in its strength, and a fury that threatens death, these people take out of the herd in order to saddle and ride it. A young man cinches his harness on his bristly back just like a horse, and surrounds his neck with a round rope, like neat reins with which he then, armed with just a rigid spur and his strength, impassively rides on the grim back of the reluctant bull. The bull, bellowing with rage, reacts to all sides, and tries madly to throw the rider off his back; he then attacks the auras from above with its curved horns, standing, upright, tall; or furious, kicking the air, he launches himself in a race, yearning towards the one who torments him; and while he tries to jump over the barrier of the concave Circus, he disturbs the whole stage, making the mob tremble. Like the Lion of Libya, badly wounded by a rigid blow, roaring, threatens ferociously with a look and bloody jaw, and showing his claws, attacks the cunning enemy, either by launching himself in a rapacious leap through the air, or by chasing the mob with a swift chase; not dissimilar, indignant, for such a strange load on his back, the bull rouses the whole arena, attacking some and others. But the young man, affirming his body, constantly dominates the bullish back, spurring endlessly his flanks.

The young man with his effective right hand, mounted on the bull, rinskingly wielding a blunt spear, also orders, from the depths of the palisade fences, another bull to come out, which he joyfully torments with pricks throughout the rodeo. Suddenly, this bull is stunned before this strange figure, and dodges, in a winged run, his saddled partner. But at the moment, his flanks being pierced by a cruel spear, he flares up with rage and gores his opponent head-on, exchanging injuries between the two in fierce combat. On his part, the robust rider settles the fight with the spear, and continues energetically throughout the rodeo taunting the bulls, until they, sweating exhaustedly, let go of their anger and calm down.
Scottish noblewoman Frances Erskine Inglis, 1st Marquise of Calderón de la Barca witnessed Bull Riding while living in Mexico in 1839, and wrote about it in her book &quot;Life in Mexico&quot; (1843):

The skill of the men is surprising; but the most curious part of the exhibition was when a coachman, a strong, handsome Mexican, mounted on the back of a fierce bull, which plunged and flung himself about as if possessed by a legion of demons, and forced the animal to gallop round and round the arena. The bull is first caught by the lasso, and thrown on his side, struggling furiously. The man mounts while he is still on the ground. At the same moment the lasso is withdrawn, and the bull starts up, maddened by feeling the weight of his unusual burden. The rider must dismount in the same way, the bull being first thrown down, otherwise he would be gored in a moment. It is terribly dangerous, for if the man were to lose his seat, his death is nearly certain; but these Mexicans are superb riders. A monk, who is attached to the establishment, seems an ardent admirer of these sports, and his presence is useful, in case of a dangerous accident occurring, which is not infrequent.

By the mid-19th century, charreada competition was popular on Texas and California cattle ranches where Anglo and Hispanic ranch hands often worked together.

Many early Texas rangers, who had to be expert horse riders and later went on to become ranchers, learned and adapted Hispanic techniques and traditions to ranches in the United States. Many also enjoyed traditional Mexican celebrations, and H. L. Kinney, a rancher, promoter and former Texas Ranger staged what is thought to be the first Anglo-American organized bullfight in the southwest in 1852. This event also included a jaripeo competition and was the subject of newspaper reports from as far away as the New Orleans Daily Delta. However, popular sentiment shifted away from various blood sports and both bullfighting and prize fighting were banned by the Texas legislature in 1891. In the same time period, however, Wild West Shows began to add steer riding to their exhibitions, choosing to use castrated animals because steers were easier to handle and transport than bulls. Additionally, informal rodeos began as competitions between neighboring ranches in the American Old West. The location of the first formal rodeo is debated. Deer Trail, Colorado claims the first rodeo was in 1869, but so does Cheyenne, Wyoming in 1872.

Although steer riding contests existed into the 1920s, the sport did not gain popularity until bulls were returned to the arena and replaced steers as the mount of choice. The first-known rodeo to use brahma bulls was in Columbia, Mississippi, produced in 1935 by Canadian brothers Earl and Weldon Bascom with Jake Lybbert and Waldo Ross. This rodeo was the first to feature a bull riding event at a night rodeo held outdoors under electric lights. From these roots, bull riding as a competitive sport has spread to a number of other nations worldwide. 

A pivotal moment for modern bull riding, and rodeo in general, came with the founding of the Cowboys&#x27; Turtle Association (CTA) in 1936, which later became the Rodeo Cowboys Association (RCA) in 1945, and eventually the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) in 1975. Through this organization, many hundreds of rodeos are held each year. Since that time, the popularity of all aspects of the rodeo has risen. In addition to the PRCA, which has PRCA ProRodeo with bull riding and the Xtreme Bulls events for bull riding only, there is the Professional Bull Riders (PBR), which has staged events since 1993. The organization&#x27;s championship event, the PBR World Finals, took place in Las Vegas, Nevada, for nearly 30 years. Since 2022, it has taken place in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. The PBR&#x27;s major league tour, titled the Unleash the Beast Series since 2018, was previously known as the Bud Light Cup Series from 1994 through 2002, then the Built Ford Tough Series from 2003 through 2017.

==Rules and regulations==
Each bull has a unique name and number called a brand used to help identify it. A sufficient number of bulls, each judged to be of good strength, health, agility, and age, are selected to perform. The rider and bull are matched randomly before the competition, although starting in 2008, some ranked riders are allowed to choose their own bulls from a bull draft for selected rounds in PBR events. In more recent times, bulls must have the tips of their horns shaved off and filed down so they are not sharp.

A rider mounts a bull and grips a flat braided rope. After they secure a good grip on the rope, the rider nods to signal they are ready. The bucking chute (a small enclosure which opens from the side) is opened and the bull storms out into the arena. The rider must attempt to stay on the bull for at least eight seconds, while only touching the bull with their riding hand. The other hand must remain free for the duration of the ride. Originally, the rules required a 10-second ride, but that was changed to the current eight seconds.

The bull bucks, rears, kicks, spins, and twists in an effort to throw the rider off. This continues for a number of seconds until the rider is bucked off the bull or dismounts after completing the ride. A loud buzzer or whistle announces the completion of an eight-second ride.

Throughout the ride, bullfighters, previously known as rodeo clowns, stay near the bull to aid the rider if necessary. When the ride ends, either intentionally or not, the bullfighters distract the bull to protect the rider from harm. The bull then exits the arena via the exit chute. If he refuses to leave, then the wrangler on horseback ropes the bull and takes him into the exit chute so the next rider can go. Some bulls, however, have a tendency to walk or run around the arena in a circle after bucking off their riders as a form of &quot;victory lap&quot; before exiting the arena. 

Many competitions have a format that involves multiple rounds, sometimes called &quot;go-rounds&quot;. Generally, events span two to three nights. The rider is given a chance to ride one bull per night. The total points scored by the end of the event are recorded, and after the first or first two go-rounds, the top 20 riders are given a chance to ride one more bull. This final round is called the &quot;short go&quot; or sometimes it is called the championship round. After the end of the short go, the rider with the most total points wins the event. A rider who had a disturbance during his or her ride can go to the judges himself and ask for a reride. The bull can fall, another bull gets out, someone interfered, or the bull did not buck are all reasons why a rider can be given a reride. With rerides they all run different. The rider may get the same bull or another one will be drawn at random.

===Points and scoring===
Scoring is done consistently within a rodeo organization. The two largest sanctioning bodies are the PRCA and PBR. They vary slightly in how they score bull rides. There are many other organizations, and each has its own particular rules on how they score, but most follow rules similar to the PRCA. The rider only scores points if he successfully rides the bull for eight seconds. The bull is always given a score. In the PRCA, a ride is scored from 0–100 points. Both the rider and the bull are awarded points. In the regular season, there are four judges, two judges scoring the bull&#x27;s effort from 0–25 points, and two judges scoring the rider&#x27;s performance from 0-25 points. There is the potential for the rider and the bull to earn up to 50 points each. The two scores are added together for a total ride score of up to 100 points. This system was spearheaded by former PRCA president Dale Smith. Scores of zero are quite common, as many riders lose control of the animal almost immediately after the bull leaves the bucking chute. Many experienced professionals are able to earn scores of 75 or more. Scores above 80 are considered excellent, and a score in the 90s exceptional.

In the PBR, a ride is scored from 0-100 points in total. Up to 50 points is scored for the rider and 50 points for the bull. The rider only scores points if he successfully rides the bull for eight seconds. The bull is always given a score. Four judges award a score of up to 25 points each for the rider&#x27;s performance, and four judges award up to 25 points each for the bull&#x27;s effort. Then all the scores are combined and then the total is divided in half for the official score.

Judges award points based on several key aspects of the ride. Bull riding rules require for judges to be former bull riders themselves. They look for constant control and rhythm in the rider in matching their movements with the bull. Points are usually deducted if a rider is constantly off balance. For points actually to be awarded, the rider must stay mounted for a minimum of eight seconds, and they are scored only for actions during those eight seconds. The ability to control the bull well allows riders to gain extra &quot;style&quot; points. These are often gained by spurring the animal. A rider is disqualified for touching the bull, the riding equipment, themself, or the ground with their free arm during the ride.

Bucking bulls have more raw power and a different style of movement than bucking horses. One move particular to bulls is a belly roll (&quot;sunfishing&quot;), in which the bull is completely off the ground and kicks either his hind feet or all four feet to the side in a twisting, rolling motion. Bulls also are more likely than horses to spin in tight, quick circles, and are less likely to run or to jump extremely high (&quot;break in two&quot;). 

For the bull, judges look at the animal&#x27;s overall agility, power and speed; his back legs kick, and his front end drops. In general, if a bull gives a rider a very hard time, more points will be awarded. If a rider fails to stay mounted for at least eight seconds, the bull is still awarded a score. The PBR and PRCA record bulls&#x27; past scores so that the best bulls can be brought to the finals, ensuring that riders will be given a chance to score highly. Both organizations award one bull an award for the best bull of the year, decided by bull scores in both buckoffs and successful qualified rides. The award brings prestige to the ranch at which the bull was raised.

If a rider scores sufficiently low due to poor bull performance, the judges may offer the rider the option of a re-ride. By taking the option, the rider gives up the score received, waits until all other riders have ridden, and rides again. This can be risky because the rider loses their score and risks being bucked off and receiving no score. A re-ride may also be given if a bull stumbles or runs into the fence or gate.

In some PBR events that use an elimination style bracket, if both riders in a bracket fail to reach eight seconds, the rider who lasts longer advances to the next round. Otherwise, the rider with a higher score advances.

==Equipment==
Bull riders use many pieces of equipment both functionally and to ensure maximum safety, both to themselves and to the animals 
involved. 

===Bull rope===
The primary piece of equipment used is the &quot;bull rope&quot;. It is a braided rope made of polypropylene, grass, or some combination. A handle is braided into the center of the rope and is usually stiffened with leather. One side of the rope is tied in an adjustable knot that can be changed for the size of bull. The other side of the rope (the tail) is a flat braid and is usually coated with rosin to keep it from sliding through the rider&#x27;s hand. A metallic bell is strapped to the knot and hangs directly under the bull throughout the ride. In addition to the sound the bell produces, it also gives the rope some weight, allowing it to fall off the bull once a rider has dismounted.

===Chaps===
Chaps are probably the most noticeable piece of bull rider clothing, as their distinctive coloring and patterns add flair to the sport. Usually made of leather, chaps also provide protection for the rider&#x27;s legs and thighs.

===Vest===
Bull riders wear a protective vest which is made of high density foam that allows the shock to disperse over a wide area, thereby reducing pain and injury. The vest&#x27;s foam is covered with a ballistic material called Spectra, similar to Kevlar. It is then covered up with leather, giving it a western look. 

Bull rider Cody Lambert was inspired to create a protective vest for fellow riders after witnessing the fatal injury of his friend and 1987 PRCA world champion bull rider, Lane Frost who died at the 1989 Cheyenne Frontier Days rodeo. After successfully riding his bull during the championship round, Frost dismounted and landed in the muddy arena floor. The bull then turned and pressed a horn against Frost&#x27;s back and pushed him against the mud. Frost got up and took a few steps towards the bucking chutes and signaled for help. He then collapsed. He died on the arena floor before he could be transported to the hospital. No autopsy was performed, and it was assumed that when the bull pushed Frost against the ground, its entire body weight was on the end of its horn, breaking some of Frost&#x27;s ribs and severing a main artery. 

Lambert based the bull riding protective vest on the one worn by his brother who was a horse jockey. He debuted the vest at the California Rodeo Salinas in the summer of 1993, and for several months, he was the only bull rider using one. It was not until the spring of 1994 when other contestants began riding with vests. The number of bull riders with vests grew over the months, and by the autumn of that year, the vast majority of riders were using them. They were officially made mandatory for all contestants by 1996. Some bull riding vests also include a neck roll for protection to the neck, although very few riders use a vest with this modification.

===Glove===
To prevent a rope burn, riders must wear a protective glove, usually made of leather. It must be fastened to the rider&#x27;s hand since the force the animal is able to exert could easily tear it away. The rider often applies rosin to the glove, which allows for additional grip.

===Boots===
Cowboy boots are worn with blunted and loosely locked spurs help keep the rider balanced and is crucial piece of equipment to the sport as a whole. The bulls are unharmed by the rowels, as their hide is roughly seven times thicker than a human being&#x27;s skin. Truly skilled riders will often &quot;spur&quot; the bull in the hope of achieving extra style points from the judges. 

===Mouthguard===
Many riders wear mouthguards, which are optional at the professional level.

===Headgear===
For most of bull riding&#x27;s history, the primary headgear worn by contestants was cowboy hats. However, things started to slowly change during the latter years of the 20th century. Among the earliest bull riders to use protective headgear was 1982 PRCA world champion, Charlie Sampson. At an exhibition rodeo in Landover, Maryland, during the latter part of the 1983 PRCA regular season, Sampson suffered some major injuries after he was jerked down and his face collided with the bull&#x27;s head during the ride, knocking him unconscious. The wreck cracked his skull and fractured nearly every bone in his face. As a result, he had reconstructive surgery. When the regular season ended, he had won enough money to qualify for the National Finals Rodeo in Oklahoma City in December. Against doctors&#x27; recommendations, he decided to compete at the event. However, his face was still recovering, so he rode at the event with a lacrosse helmet and a neck roll. When his face was healed up, Sampson went back to riding in a cowboy hat. However, he would suffer additional facial injuries throughout the rest of his career and rode with a helmet if his injuries were severe enough to warrant it. He would always go back to riding in a hat when healed up and never made a helmet a permanent part of his gear. 

Into the 1990s, a small number of other professional bull riders began using protective headgear such as leather face masks with metal bars that they wore under their hats while riding or modified ice hockey helmets. Like Charlie Sampson, most of these riders only wore headgear while recovering from serious facial or head injuries, only to ditch it when healed up. Very few bull riders made protective headwear a permanent part of their gear. However, by 2003, though still a minority, helmeted bull riders were more common than ever. Many were now riders that did not necessarily suffer serious injuries, but who grew up riding with them for the sake of extra safety. The number of contestants who rode with helmets grew throughout the rest of the 2000s, especially during the latter years of the decade. 

By the early 2010s, manufacturers were building helmets made specifically for bull riding. During the same time period, most up-and-comers were already riding with helmets. In 2013, the PBR made it mandatory that all contestants at their events who were born on or after October 15, 1994 ride with a full bull riding helmet. Those born before that date were grandfathered in and permitted to ride with a protective face mask underneath their hat or simply with their hat if so desired.

Public health researchers found evidence suggesting that bull riding helmets are protective, when riders wearing one particular type of helmet suffered approximately 50% fewer head and facial injuries.

In 2004, at the 1st International Rodeo Research and Clinical Care Conference in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, the licensed rodeo and bull riding medical personnel and clinicians recommended to the rodeo and bull riding associations mentioned in the agreement the mandatory use of helmets to all youth bull riders and the recommendation of helmets to all adult bull riders.

For competitors under the age of 18, mandatory protective headgear incorporating an ice hockey-style helmet is worn. Riders who use helmets as youths tend to continue wearing them as they reach adulthood and turn professional.

===Bull equipment===

====Flank strap====
The &quot;flank strap&quot; is a soft cotton rope at least 5/8&quot; in diameter and is used without extra padding like sheepskin or neoprene. It is tied around the bull&#x27;s flank. Contrary to popular belief, the flank strap is not tied around the bull&#x27;s testicles. This rope is to encourage the bull to use his hind legs more in a bucking motion, as this is a true test of a rider&#x27;s skill in maintaining the ride. The flank strap causes the bull to buck in motions such as bucking side to side, jumping up and down, or kicking its legs in the air in a circular motion. If it is applied improperly a rider may request to ride again, as the bull will not buck well if the flank strap is too tight. The flank strap is applied by the stock contractor or his designate.

==The arena==
The &quot;arenas&quot; used in professional bull riding vary. Some are rodeo arenas that are used only for bull riding and other rodeo events. Others are event centers that play host to many different sports. Common to all arenas is a large, open area that gives the bulls, bull riders, and bull fighters plenty of room to maneuver. The area is fenced, six to seven feet high or more, to protect the audience from escaped bulls. The fencing of the arena is metal fencing that has metal rods across it so that when the bulls buck and kick the fence they do not break the fence and end up in the crowd. There are generally exits on each corner of the arena for riders to get out of the way quickly. Riders can also hop onto the fence to avoid danger. One end of the arena contains the bucking chutes from which the bulls are released. An arena usually contains two to six bucking chutes. Especially for big events to keep it flowing the nights of the events. They load the bulls into all two to six chutes, releasing one at a time. There is also an exit chute where the bulls can exit the arena. Also in the arena, there will be two to four guys mounted on horses with ropes, and chaps on to rope the bulls and take them into the exit chute to help keep all people in the arena safe and keep the show moving. These men or women will lasso the bull around the head and neck and pull them into the exit chute where one of the workers will open the exit chute and put the bull back.

==North America==
In the United States and Canada, most professional bull riders start out riding in high school rodeo or other junior associations. From there, riders may go on the college rodeo circuit or to one of several national or regional semi-professional associations including the Southern Extreme Bull Riding Association (SEBRA), the National Federation of Professional Bull Riders (NFPB), the Professional Championship Bull Riders Tour (PCB), the American Bull Riders Tour (ABT), Bull Riders Canada (BRC), the International Professional Rodeo Association (IPRA), the United Professional Rodeo Association (UPRA), the American Professional Rodeo Association (APRA), the Southern Rodeo Association (SRA), the Canadian Cowboys Association (CCA), among others. Bull riders compete in these organizations as they are climbing the ladder to the professional ranks and to supplement their income.

La Federación Mexicana de Rodeo (The Mexican Rodeo Federation) is Mexico&#x27;s sanctioning body that includes all of professional American rodeo&#x27;s standard events, including bull riding. Cuernos Chuecos (Crooked Horns) is Mexico&#x27;s most prestigious stand-alone bull riding organization.

Professional bull riders can win in excess of $100,000 a year while competing in either the PBR or PRCA circuits.

==Australia and New Zealand==
There are approximately 200 rodeos and bushmen&#x27;s carnivals held annually across Australia. At most of these events bull riding is one of the featured competitions.

Initially bullocks and steers were used for roughriding events and these were owned by local graziers that lent them for these events. Nowadays bulls are used for the open events and stock contractors supply the various roughriding associations. Contract stock has produced a more uniform range of bucking stock which is also quieter to handle. The competitions are run and scored in a similar style to that used in the United States.

In May 1992, the National Rodeo Council of Australia (NRCA) was formed to promote and further the sport of rodeo and has represented the following associations, which also control bull riding:
*Australian Bushmen&#x27;s Campdraft &amp; Rodeo Association (ABCRA)
*Australian Professional Bull Riders Association (APBA)
*Central Rodeo Cowboys Association (CRCA)
*Indigenous Rodeo Riders Australia (IRRA)
*National Student Rodeo Association (NSRA)
*National Rodeo Association (NRA)
*Northern Cowboys Association (NCA)
*Queensland Rodeo Association (QRA)
*Rodeo Services Association (RSA)
*West Coast Rodeo Circuit (WCRC)

There are strict standards for the selection, care and treatment of rodeo livestock, arenas, plus equipment requirements and specifications.

Chainsaw was one of Australia&#x27;s most famous bucking bulls. Only nine contestants scored on him and he won the Australian national title of Bull of the Year a world record eight times during 1987 to 1994.

Some of Australia&#x27;s best bull riders travel and compete internationally in Canada, New Zealand and the United States. Some of Australia&#x27;s leading bull riders conduct bull riding clinics to assist learners and novice riders.

A World Challenge of Professional Bull Riders (PBR) was held on 29 May 2010 at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre (BEC). The 2010 PBR Finals were held over two nights at the Australian Equine and Livestock Events Centre (AELEC), with five top-ranked professional bull riders from the United States and 25 of Australia&#x27;s best bull riders contesting the event.

Rodeo is also popular in country regions of New Zealand where approximately 30 rodeos, which include bull riding contests, are held each summer.

==Animal welfare==

There is debate between animal rights/welfare organizations and bull riding enthusiasts over many aspects of the sport. One source of controversy is the flank strap. The flank strap is placed around a bull&#x27;s flank, just in front of the hind legs, to encourage bucking. Critics say that the flank strap encircles or otherwise binds the genitals of the bull. However, the flank strap is anatomically impossible to place over the testicles. Many point out that the bull&#x27;s genes are valuable and that there is a strong economic incentive to keep the animal in good reproductive health. Further, particularly in the case of bulls, an animal that is sick and in pain usually will not want to move at all, will not buck as well, and may even lie down in the chute or ring rather than buck.

Critics also claim that electric cattle prods (&quot;hot shots&quot;) are used to injure and torture bulls, while supporters of bull riding claim that the cattle prod simply gets the bull out of the chute quickly and is only a moderate irritation due to the thickness of the animal&#x27;s hide. Cattle prods have not been used in the Professional Bull Riders (PBR) tour for several years. However, in smaller associations, a cattle prod is still sometimes used to ensure that the animal leaves the chute as soon as the rider nods their head. Cattle prods are not allowed by any major association.

Spurs are also a source of controversy, though modern rodeo rules place strict regulations on the type and use of spurs and participants point out that they are a tool commonly used in other non-rodeo equestrian disciplines. Spurs used in bull riding do not have a fixed rowel, nor can they be sharpened. The PBR currently allows only two types of rowels to ensure the safety of the animals.

<text>Bronc riding, either bareback bronc or saddle bronc competition, is a rodeo event that involves a rodeo participant riding a bucking horse (sometimes called a &quot;bronc&quot; or &quot;bronco&quot;) that attempts to throw or buck off the rider. Originally based on the necessary buck breaking skills of a working cowboy, the event is now a highly stylized competition that utilizes horses that often are specially bred for strength, agility, and bucking ability. It is recognized by most rodeo organizations such as the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) and the International Professional Rodeo Association (IPRA).

==Description==
Each competitor climbs onto a horse, which is held in a small pipe or wooden enclosure called a bucking chute. When the rider is ready, the gate of the bucking chute is opened and the horse bursts out and begins to buck. The rider attempts to stay on the horse for eight seconds without touching the horse with their free hand. On the first jump out of the chute, the rider must &quot;mark the horse out&quot;. This means they must have the heels of their boots in contact with the horse above the point of the shoulders before the horse&#x27;s front legs hit the ground. A rider that manages to complete a ride is scored on a scale of 0–50 and the horse is also scored on a scale of 0–50. The ride as a whole is rated as the sum of these individual scores: scores in the 80s are considered very good, and in the 90s are considered exceptional. A horse who bucks in a spectacular and effective manner will score more points than a horse who bucks in a straight line with no significant changes of direction.

==History==
The earliest examples of American bronc riding were believed to have been born out of breaking horses for the United States Army, most notably in Wyoming and Colorado. The first three sanctioned bronc riding championship events were held in 1901 at the Colorado Cattle and Horse Grower&#x27;s Association, Denver Horse Show Association, and the Northwestern Colorado competition. The following year competitions were held on September 2, 1902, at Cheyenne, Wyoming&#x27;s Cheyenne Frontier Days, and in Denver, Colorado, at The Denver Horse Show Association annual event. Both of these were won by Harry Henry Brennan, known today as the &quot;father of modern bronc riding.&quot;

==Bareback bronc vs. saddle bronc riding==
Bareback bronc and saddle bronc styles are very different. In saddle bronc, the rider uses a specialized saddle with free-swinging stirrups and no horn. The saddle bronc rider grips a simple rein braided from cotton or polyester and attached to a leather halter worn by the horse. The rider lifts on the rein and attempts to find a rhythm with the animal by spurring forwards and backwards with their feet in a sweeping motion from shoulder to flank.

The bareback rider does not use a saddle or rein, but uses a rigging that consists of a leather and rawhide composite piece often compared to a suitcase handle attached to a surcingle and placed just behind the horse&#x27;s withers. The rider leans back and spurs with an up and down motion from the horse&#x27;s point of shoulder toward the rigging handle, spurring at each jump in rhythm with the motion of the horse.

In both events, after the completion of successful rides, two pickup riders in the arena attempt to help the contestants safely dismount the still-moving horses.

Bareback bronc riding began to develop as a professional rodeo sporting event around 1900. The riding equipment used during that era varied. In some cases, the rider simply held onto the horse&#x27;s mane, called a mane-hold. Others held a loose or twisted rope tied around the horse&#x27;s girth, and other methods involved using multiple handhold leather riggings based on a surcingle. In the early 1920s, when the old rodeo rules allowing two handed riding were being phased out and replaced with the newer rule of riding with one hand in the rigging and one hand in the air, Earl Bascom invented, designed and made rodeo&#x27;s first one-hand bareback rigging. The original one-handed rigging was made by Bascom from a section of rubber belting discarded from a threshing machine, with the entire rigging—the handhold and the body—all made as one piece. The handhold was folded back and riveted to the main body of the rigging, with a &#x27;D&#x27; ring riveted on each side for tying the latigos. This rigging was first used at the Raymond Stampede in Alberta, Canada in July 1924. Bascom then refined the design, making his second one-handhold rigging out of leather and rawhide. Sole leather was used for the rigging body. Strips of leather, with rawhide sewed between, were used for the handhold with sheepskin glued under the handholds to protect the knuckles; this arrangement became known as &quot;Bascom&#x27;s Rigging&quot;. Honored in several Halls of Fame, Bascom is now known as the &quot;Father of the Modern-day Bareback Rigging&quot;. Variations of Bascom&#x27;s rigging are still used in rodeos today.

==The horse==

The bucking horse is usually a mare, but occasionally, a gelding (a castrated male horse) is used. Bucking horses usually travel in close quarters and are housed in a herd setting, geldings are generally less disruptive and more prone to get along with one another. Mares are also used, and while a mixed herd of mares and geldings is a bit more prone to disruptions, they can be kept together without great difficulties. Stallions are less common, because they can be disruptive in a herd and may fight if there are mares present.

The modern bronc is not a truly feral horse. Most bucking stock are specifically bred for use in rodeos, with horses having exceptional bucking ability being purchased by stock contractors and fetching a high price. Most are allowed to grow up in a natural, semi-wild condition on the open range, but also have to be gentled and tamed in order to be managed from the ground, safely loaded into trailers, vaccinated and wormed, and to load in and out of bucking chutes. They also are initially introduced to bucking work with cloth dummies attached to the saddle. Due to the rigors of travel and the short bursts of high intensity work required, most horses in a bucking string are at least 6 or 7 years old.

==Animal welfare issues==
The event has provoked concerns among some animal welfare advocates that practices used in the event may constitute animal cruelty.

Modern rodeos in the United States are closely regulated and have responded to accusations of animal cruelty by instituting a number of rules to guide how rodeo livestock are to be managed. The PRCA has rules that specifically regulate the proper care and treatment of rodeo animals; these guidelines must be followed by all rodeo participants in sanctioned rodeos. In 1994, a survey of 28 sanctioned rodeos was conducted by on-site independent veterinarians. Reviewing 33,991 animal runs, the injury rate was documented at 16 animals or 0.047 percent, less than five hundredths of one percent or one in 2000 animals. A study of rodeo animals in Australia found a similar injury rate. Basic injuries occurred at a rate of 0.072 percent, or one in 1,405, with injuries requiring veterinary attention at 0.036 percent, or one injury in every 2810 times the animal was used, and transport, yarding and competition were all included in the study. A later PRCA survey of 60,971 animal performances at 198 rodeo performances and 73 sections of &quot;slack&quot; indicated 27 animals were injured, again approximately five-hundredths of 1 percent – 0.0004.
However, accusations of cruelty in the USA persist. The PRCA acknowledges that they only sanction about 30 percent of all rodeos, while another 50 percent are sanctioned by other organizations and 20 percent are completely unsanctioned. Several animal rights organizations keep records of accidents and incidents of possible animal abuse. They cite various specific incidents of injury to support their statements, and also point to examples of long-term breakdown, as well as reporting on injuries and deaths suffered by animals in non-rodeo events staged on the periphery of professional rodeo such as chuckwagon races and &quot;suicide runs&quot;. While in terms of actual statistics on animal injury rate, there appear to be no more recent independent studies on animal injury in rodeo than the 1994 study, groups such as PETA gather anecdotal reports such as one from a 2010 rodeo in Colorado alleging eleven animal injuries, of which two were fatal.

There are economic incentives to keep animals healthy enough for continuing rodeo participation. Bucking horses and bulls are costly to replace: a proven bucking horse can be sold for $8000 to $10,000, making &quot;rough stock&quot; an investment worth caring for and keeping in good health for many years. Health regulations also mandate vaccinations and blood testing of horses crossing state lines. An injured animal will not buck well and hence a cowboy cannot obtain a high score for his ride, so sick or injured animals are not run through the chutes, but instead are given appropriate veterinary care so they can be returned to their usual level of strength and power. PRCA regulations require veterinarians to be available at all rodeos to treat both bucking stock and other animals as needed. The PRCA requires a veterinarian be at all sanctioned rodeos.

Activists also express concern that many rodeo horses end their lives as horsemeat. While it is accurate that some rough stock animals are slaughtered for horsemeat at the end of their useful careers, other bucking horses are retired at the end of their rodeo usefulness and allowed to live into old age. The issue of horse slaughter crosses all equestrian disciplines and is not confined solely to the rodeo industry. Any unwanted horse can meet this fate, including race horses, show horses, or even backyard pasture pets.

Over the years, some states imposed regulation upon certain techniques and tools used in rodeos. In 2000, California became the first state to prohibit the use of cattle prods on animals in the chute. The city of Pittsburgh prohibited the use of flank straps as well as prods or shocking devices, wire tie-downs, and sharpened or fixed spurs or rowels at rodeos or rodeo-related events. Some other cities and states have passed similar prohibitions. Under PRCA guidelines, electric prods may not deliver a shock stronger than can be produced from two D batteries. Prods are allowed as long as the situation requires them to protect the people or the animals.

===Flank strap controversy===
A &quot;flank strap&quot; (or, &quot;bucking strap&quot;) is used to encourage the horse to kick out straighter and higher when it bucks. The flank strap is about 4 inches wide, covered in sheepskin or neoprene and fastens behind the widest part of the abdomen. Flank straps that hurt the horse are not allowed by rodeo rules in the United States.

A horse in pain will become sullen and not buck very well, and harm to the genitalia is anatomically impossible because the stifle joint of the hind leg limits how far back a flank strap can be attached.

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has stated that burrs and other irritants are at times placed under the flank strap and that improperly used flank straps can cause open wounds and burns if the hair is rubbed off and the skin is chafed raw. However, while the implied argument behind this claim is that pain is what makes the horse buck, in actual practice, irritants or pain generally interfere with a horse&#x27;s ability to buck in an energetic and athletic fashion.

<text>Jakob Ammann (also Jacob Amman, Amann; 12 February 1644 – between 1712 and 1730) was a Swiss Anabaptist leader and the namesake of the Amish religious movement.

== Personal life ==

The full facts about the personal life of Jacob Ammann are incomplete and have been mostly speculative until recent decades. Since the late 1990s, more research has filled in some of the gaps and a basic outline of his life is now conceivable.
=== Early life and family ===
Jakob Ammann was born on 12 February 1644 in Erlenbach im Simmental, Canton of Bern, Switzerland to Michael and Anna (née Rupp) Ammann. Erlenbach church records note the baptism of a Jakob Ammann on 12 February 1644, who was probably Ammann. His grandfather has been identified as Ulrich Ammann. All three Ammanns were tailors. Jakob was third in a family of six children. He probably received limited formal education. On 37 official documents signed by him, only his initials appear, with most of them having a nearby note that Ammann was not able to write so he only &quot;made his mark&quot;. However, on three documents, his signed name does appear, although twice it was probably written for him by someone else; once, with the same style of writing as his initials, appear the poorly formed letters &quot;J. AMME&quot;, which is assumed to be his own writing. Because he asked for letters to be read in one meeting, it is assumed he was not able to read or could do so only poorly. He did better financially than the average person of his time.

Jakob was married to Verena Stüdler, but very little is known of her beyond her name. They had at least one daughter and one son, Baltz.

Jakob’s father and one of his sisters also joined the Anabaptist movement. His brother Ulli, 18 years his junior, was also an Anabaptist and is known for his moderating tone in the attempts at reconciliation between the Amish and Reist sides.

=== Conversion to Anabaptism ===
On 12 March 1671, he is noted as the sponsor for a baptism in the state church. In June 1680, government correspondence from Oberhofen asked for counsel from authorities in Bern on how to deal with a Jakob Ammann who had &quot;become infected with the Anabaptist sect&quot;. This is the first known reference to Ammann as an Anabaptist. This indicates a conversion to Anabaptism sometime between 1671 and 1680. Sometime between his conversion and 1693, he was ordained to the ministry, possibly by Hans Reist who would later become one of his greatest opponents.

By 1693, Ammann had moved from Switzerland to Heidolsheim, Alsace where his father died and was buried in the neighboring village of Baldenheim. Apparently shortly after the death of his father, he moved to the head of the valley at La Petite Lièpvre (Klein Leberau), near Markirch (today Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines), Alsace, remaining there until October 1712 when all the Anabaptists in the area were expelled by an edict of Louis XIV. After this date, no more records concerning Jakob Ammann have been found. He probably went to live with friends or relatives somewhere in Lower Alsace.

=== Death ===
The date and place of Ammann&#x27;s death are unknown, but in 1730 his daughter requested baptism in the Reformed Church in Erlenbach and stated that her father had died. It is not recorded when or where the death had occurred. Ammann&#x27;s involvement in church matters had dropped off considerably before his disappearance from the records in 1712, possibly from old age since he would have been approaching 70 years of age when he moved away from the Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines area.

== Theology and practice ==
Because of scarcity of materials, very little is known of Jakob Ammann’s teaching and day-to-day life. Three letters comprise the whole of his first-hand accounts of his thoughts. Other letters accuse Jakob of teaching or holding various viewpoints, but since many of these letters were written by his opponents it is not clear how much bias the accusations contain.

From Jakob’s letters, it can be learned that he was a firm disciplinarian, uncompromising in what he believed, and expected others to &quot;conform to the teachings of Christ and His apostles&quot;. His rejection of the &quot;good-hearted&quot; stemmed from his belief that whoever accepted the &quot;true saving faith&quot; would be baptized upon that faith, cost what it may. They would &quot;forsake the world&quot; and practise a very practical separation in their everyday life. Jakob was willing to disregard longstanding customs and practices if they were not founded on God’s Word. He denied that he was trying to start a &quot;new faith&quot;. He believed in a new birth experience that would radically change a person. He wrote:
In practical matters, he stood opposed to long hair on men, shaved beards, and clothing that manifested pride. Liars were to be excommunicated. Ammann, unlike most Amish married men of today, however, had a mustache, which is largely forbidden today in the faith.

== Schism ==
Jakob Ammann is known because of his prominent involvement in a schism among the Swiss Brethren that began in 1693. Until recent decades, he was often heavily blamed for the division, being portrayed as an angry, harsh, and demanding leader who imposed his views on others. With the publication of some of the correspondence from the period (beginning in 1950, with Mast’s &quot;Amish Letters&quot;) and the uncovering of new evidence, Ammann’s reputation has received a more positive appraisal among some researchers. Because of their prominent roles, Jakob Ammann and Hans Reist have been used to characterize the two sides of the schism, but the issues were broader than the two most prominent men involved.

== Background ==
In the mid-1600s, a fresh influx of converts came into Swiss Anabaptism. The Reformed pastor at Burgdorf even complained that half of the people in the villages in his area were either Anabaptist or deeply sympathetic to their cause. These fresh converts—zealous for their new faith—were in fact a sort of new movement within Swiss Anabaptism. Of the nearly 200 surnames among the Amish in the 1690s, only a very few were found in the Reist side, indicating that the two sides formed mostly around two groups of people with different origins. Because of persecution, many Swiss Brethren families had emigrated or been evicted from Swiss territory into the Alsace and Palatinate before the division. The civil authorities tended to be more lenient in the new locations, and in some cases welcomed the newcomers as they were looking for people to develop their lands. This emigration tended to create a different environment than the Swiss who had not emigrated were experiencing, making some of the issues come to the fore.

Another important aspect in the schism was a conference held at Ohnenheim, Alsace, by several Swiss Brethren ministers and elders in 1660, in which they formally adopted the Dordrecht Confession of Faith that had been drawn up by Dutch Mennonites. Until this time, the Swiss Brethren (who did not use the name &quot;Mennonite&quot; for themselves) had no official confession of faith beyond the Schleitheim Confession. The Dordrecht Confession contained two points that the Swiss Brethren had not historically practised: foot washing (Article XI) and social avoidance (including not eating meals with those who had been shunned, Article XVII). Swiss Brethren had practised excommunication and a refusal to &quot;eat&quot; the [Lord&#x27;s Supper] with those banned, but their avoidance did not include refraining from eating regular meals with those in the &quot;bann&quot;. These two matters, foot washing and not eating &quot;physical&quot; meals with the excommunicated, would be at the core of the schism.

== Beginning ==
In 1693, Jakob Ammann, &quot;together with the ministers and elders,&quot; sent a general letter to people within the Swiss Brethren congregations, asking for a meeting in which he wanted clarification about where they stood on three questions: 1) Shunning those who had been banned, 2) whether liars should be excommunicated, and 3) if people could be saved who did not follow God’s word. This last issue was referring to the &quot;good-hearted&quot;, meaning those who sympathized with the Anabaptists and even helped them materially in times of persecution, but who would not take the step of rebaptism. Those siding with Ammann felt that these &quot;good-hearted&quot; people should not be looked upon and consoled as &quot;saved&quot; unless they took up the cross and followed Christ in rebaptism and obedience to his teachings.

Along with feetwashing, these three points were at the core of the division. However, other disputations surfaced during the discussions in the following years, including frequency of communion and how church discipline should be conducted. Another matter mentioned during the time of the schism was the establishment of stricter regulations concerning dress and beard styles. However, social avoidance of banned individuals was the most controversial of all the differences between them, and thus it has sometimes been erroneously considered as the only cause of the schism.

== Excommunications ==
Jakob Ammann and Nicolas Augsburger were chosen by a ministerial committee to travel to Switzerland for a meeting with church leaders to find out where the Swiss congregations stood on the disputed points.. At first, a few of the Swiss ministers agreed with Ammann’s view, but in a later meeting Hans Reist would not agree with social avoidance, using Matthew 15:17 as a basis for &quot;what enters the mouth is no sin.&quot; Another meeting was called, in which Hans Reist did not show up, saying he was busy. At this point, Jakob Ammann became irritated (&quot;verdreiszlich&quot;) and then proceeded to announce that Hans Reist was excommunicated on six points. When Ammann questioned some of the other Swiss ministers at the meeting where they stood on the issues, they pleaded for time to consult with their congregations. Ammann saw this as a turning back, since some of them had previously expressed agreement with his side. He then proceeded to announce the excommunication of six of the present ministers. Amman and the four men with him then left &quot;without shaking hands with anyone.&quot; These excommunications created a definite breach within the Swiss Brethren movement. The Reist side eventually excommunicated the Ammann side as well.

== Attempts at reconciliation ==
Within a few years, several attempts were made at reconciliation. In February 1700, Jakob Ammann and several of his co-ministers removed the ban from the Swiss ministers and excommunicated themselves in recognition that they had acted too rashly and had &quot;grievously erred.&quot; They did not feel that they were in error, but rather that they had not given sufficient time for the Reist side to consider the 
matter before excommunicating them. Also, they felt that they should not have excommunicated the Swiss ministers on the spot, but should have consulted with the whole congregation before proceeding. However, while Hans Reist and some of the Swiss ministers appear to have accepted the repentance of Ammann and his co-workers, they held firm to their position of not accepting social shunning. Some of the other issues had been accepted by the Swiss ministers, but the main body of Amish and the Reist side were never able to reach agreement about social shunning. 

Today in North America, the Amish and Mennonites work side-by-side on business and charitable aid projects. However, official sharing of ministry and communion is rare among the most conservative groups of Old Order Amish and Mennonites. In more moderate groups, there remains little to no effect from the schism, with the exception of names of churches.The Reist side became known as Mennonites after the schism.

But in a paradox, it was the Amish side that was pushing for the introduction of Dutch Mennonite ideas, and those opposing the ideas eventually became known as Mennonites.

Both live side by side in many communities today, and work together peacefully in publishing,

<text>The Schleitheim Confession was the most representative statement of Anabaptist principles, by a group of Swiss Anabaptists in 1527 in Schleitheim, Switzerland. The real title is &quot;Brüderliche vereynigung etzlicher Kinder Gottes siben Artickel betreffend ...&quot; (&quot;Brotherly Union of a Number of Children of God Concerning Seven Articles&quot;).
== Origin ==
The Confession is believed to have been written by Michael Sattler. The South German Ordnung of approximately the same date is similar to that of the Schleitheim Confession but contains many more Biblical references supporting the confession. The Schleitheim confession continues to be a guide for churches such as many Schwarzenau Brethren, the Bruderhof and the Hutterites, who trace their spiritual heritage back to the Radical Reformation and the Anabaptists.

== Doctrine ==
The Confession consisted of seven articles, written during a time of severe persecution:

;Baptism: Baptism is administered only to those who have consciously repented, turned away from sin, amended their lives and believe that Christ has died for their sins and who request it for themselves (believer&#x27;s baptism). Infant baptism is specifically denounced.

;The Ban (Excommunication): A Christian should live with discipline and walk in the way of righteousness, following after Jesus every day. Those members of the Body who slip and fall into sin should be admonished twice in private, but the third offense should be openly disciplined and banned as a final recourse. This should always occur prior to the breaking of the bread, to preserve the unity and purity of the Body of Christ.

;Breaking of Bread (Communion): Only those who have been baptized into the Body of Christ are members of the Body, thus only they can take part in the communion of the Body of Christ. Participation in Communion is an observance and remembrance of Christ&#x27;s body and blood; the physical body and blood of Christ is not believed to be received in the sacrament.

;Separation from Evil: The community of Christians shall have no association with those who remain in disobedience and a spirit of rebellion against God. There can be no fellowship with the wickedness of this earthly world; therefore there can be no participation in the organizations, works, church services, meetings or civil affairs of those who live in contradiction to the commands of God (this may include Catholics and Protestants as well as other religions and pagans). All evil must be put away, including using weapons of force such as the sword and armor.

;Pastors in the Church: All elders and leaders in the church must be men of good repute, as described in Scripture. Some of the responsibilities they must faithfully carry out are teaching, public reading of Scripture, disciplining, applying the ban, leading in prayer, and the sacraments. They are to be supported by the church, but must also be disciplined if they sin.

;The Sword (Christian pacifism) – nonresistance: Violence must not be used in any circumstance. The way of nonviolence is patterned after the example of Christ who never exhibited violence in the face of persecution or as a punishment for sin. A Christian must love their enemies and pray for those who persecute them, as Jesus did. A Christian should not pass judgment in worldly disputes. It is not appropriate for a Christian to serve as a magistrate; a magistrate acts according to the rules of the world and uses force or orders force to be used, not acting according to the rules of heaven; their weapons are worldly, but the weapons of a Christian are spiritual.

; The Oath: No oaths should be taken because Jesus prohibited the taking of oaths and swearing, teaching rather complete honesty. Testifying or affirming is not the same thing as swearing. When a person bears testimony, they are testifying about the truth and the present, whether it be good or evil.

<text>A rodeo clown, bullfighter or rodeo protection athlete, is a rodeo performer who works in bull riding competitions. Originally, the rodeo clown was a single job combining &quot;bullfighting&quot; — the protection of riders thrust from the bull, as well as being an individual who provided comic relief. Today, the job is split into two separate ones: bullfighters who protect the riders from the bull, and entertainers (barrelmen) who provide comic humor. However, in some parts of the world and at some small rodeos, the jobs of bull rider protection and comic remain combined.

==Tasks and skills==
The primary job of the rodeo bullfighter is to protect a fallen rider from the bull by distracting it and providing an alternative target for the bull to attack, whether the rider has been bucked off or has jumped off the animal. These individuals expose themselves to great danger in order to protect the riders. To this end, they wear bright, loose-fitting clothes that are designed to tear away, with protective gear fitted underneath. Rodeo clowns require speed, agility, and the ability to anticipate a bull&#x27;s next move. Working closely with very large, very powerful animals, rodeo clowns are often injured seriously, and, sometimes, fatally. Most rodeos feature a clown, and clowns have become crowd favorites.

In some venues, rodeo bullfighters still wear clown make-up and some may also provide traditional clowning entertainment for the crowd between rodeo events, often parodying aspects of cowboy culture. But most modern bullfighters no longer dress as clowns, though they still wear bright, loose-fitting clothing. At larger events in the United States, the job is split, a bullfighter (sometimes two or more) protects the riders from the bull, and a barrelman (sometimes one person, sometimes two) provide comic humor. Some barrelmen provide both comedy and support to bullfighters, but the job of a bullfighter is generally distinct from that of the comic.

==History==
Rodeo clowns date to the beginnings of competitive rodeo in the early 1900s, when promoters hired cowboys to entertain the crowd between events or if the competition was delayed. These individuals began wearing oversized, baggy clothing and eventually developed more outlandish gear. When bull riding competition began to use ill-tempered Brahma bulls in the 1920s, the need for a person to distract the bull from fallen riders fell to the rodeo clown. The comedy aspect of clown work, as opposed to protection of rodeo athletes, began to disappear in some parts of the USA by the late 1970s.

The use of a barrel for protection began during the 1930s when a rodeo clown named Jasbo Fulkerson began to use a wooden barrel with a solid bottom. In 1995, Earl W. Bascom was honored at age 89 as the oldest living rodeo clown in the world. Bullfighting was reported as Wick Peth&#x27;s profession in 1967, and Jimmy Anderson was reported to have begun his career in 1975.

In Australia, rodeo clowns were a part of rodeos and agricultural shows for many years. They were hired to entertain the spectators between events and to help manage the bullocks, steers or bulls in the arena. In the 1930s, with the introduction of aggressive Brahman bulls and Brahman crossbreds, the job became much more serious. In the late 20th century, acknowledging the great danger faced by the profession, the term &quot;bullfighter&quot; began to replace the name &quot;rodeo clown&quot; in formal use.

At the 2001 Professional Bull Riders (PBR) World Finals, bullfighter Rob Smets no longer wore his traditional, baggy clown outfit and began wearing a sport jersey and shorts that featured his sponsors&#x27; logos. This was the blueprint for future PBR bullfighter outfits as in 2003, all bullfighters in the organization stopped wearing traditional clown make-up and outfits, and traded them for sport jerseys and shorts with corporate sponsor logos. This was also the case for barrelmen in the PBR, but they retained their make-up. In subsequent years, many bullfighters in other organizations would also adopt sport jerseys and shorts, but many also kept wearing clown make-up. Some even combine make-up and baggies with jerseys. Frank Newsom, who had fought bulls in the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) and Professional Bull Riders (PBR), including at each organization&#x27;s respective world championship event (the National Finals Rodeo and PBR World Finals) was the last bullfighter to wear a baggy outfit and make-up at a televised PBR event, which was the 2004 Built Ford Tough Series (BFTS) event in Guthrie, Oklahoma. He was an alternate bullfighter at said event. Beginning the next year, he would don a sport jersey and shorts as an official member of the PBR elite series&#x27; bullfighting team, of which he was a member for several years until retiring at the conclusion of the 2022 PBR World Finals.

For several years, barrelmen at PBR events have no longer gone inside the barrel in the arena. As a result, they are now referred to as &quot;arena entertainers&quot; or simply &quot;entertainers&quot;.

==Technique==
The bullfighters enter the rodeo arena on foot, before the bull is released from the bucking chute. They stand on either side of the chute as the bull is released and work as a team to distract the bull and thus protect the rider and each other. Their role is particularly important when a rider has been injured, in which case the bullfighter interposes himself between the bull and the rider, or uses techniques such as running off at an angle, throwing a hat, or shouting, so that the injured rider can exit the ring.

Typically, at larger rodeos, bullfighters work in groups of as little as two, and as many as four. The barrelman uses a large, well-padded steel barrel that he can jump in and out of easily, and the barrel helps to protect him from the bull. In Australia, barrelmen generally do not use barrels.
All members of the protection team wear loose, baggy clothing. The comic may wear the most outlandish clothing in bright colors, which may include things like wearing an inflatable female costume, and uses noisy colorful props such as rubber chickens and exploding garbage cans.

Typically, the barrelman carries a microphone and heckles the rodeo announcer, the crowd and anyone else he recognizes. During the bull riding event, the barrelman supports the bullfighters, including taunting the bulls by calling them names and waving props at them, usually from within the safety of the barrel. Barrelmen may also tell jokes and use topical humor.

==Freestyle bullfighting==
Bullfighting has grown in popularity, so that in addition to being a job in its own right, it is a competitive event at rodeos around the United States. When not working to protect bull riders, many rodeo bullfighters also have their own performances known as American freestyle bullfighting, or simply Freestyle bullfighting or American bullfighting. Instead of bucking bulls, fighting bulls are used in these events. They are turned into the arena and the bullfighter works with the animal, evaluated based upon the aptitude he displays in controlling and maneuvering the bull, precision in jumping the bull, contact with the bull, and handling of the barrel. Similar skills are sometimes displayed at traditional rodeos in intermission acts. A typical format is a 60- or 70-second encounter between bull and bullfighter, in which the bullfighter scores points for various maneuvers. In contrast to the older sport of Spanish bullfighting, no harm is done to the bull in rodeo bullfighting. In some occasions, a bullfighter will draw the same bull numerous times during a season, which can help with score.

==Recognition==
From 1981 through 2000, the Wrangler Bullfighting Tour held a series of several events at PRCA rodeos and at the end of the regular season, the top six contestants competed at the National Finals Rodeo (NFR) to determine the world champion bullfighter. Since 2004, the PRCA has designated the Bullfighter of the Year award to its best bull rider protection athlete by a way of votes within the organization. As of the 2020s, there are two organizations in the United States that specialize in freestyle bullfighting: Bullfighters Only (BFO) and Ultimate Bullfighters (UBF). There is also Bulls, Bands &amp; Barrels (BBB), which features freestyle bullfighting as an event. Schools exist to provide training for potential rodeo bullfighters.

<text>S4C (, &quot;Sianel Pedwar Cymru&quot;, meaning &quot;Channel Four Wales&quot;) is a Welsh language free-to-air public broadcast television channel. Launched on 1 November 1982, it was the first television channel to be aimed specifically at a Welsh-speaking audience. S4C&#x27;s headquarters are based in Carmarthen, at the University of Wales Trinity Saint David&#x27;s creative and digital centre, Yr Egin. It also has regional offices in Caernarfon and Cardiff. As of 2024, S4C had an average of 118 employees. S4C is the fourth-oldest terrestrial television channel in Wales after BBC One, ITV and BBC Two.

As with Channel 4 (which launched the next day in the rest of the UK), S4C commissions all of its programmes from independent producers. BBC Cymru Wales produces programmes for S4C as part of its public service remit, including the news service &quot;Newyddion&quot;. From its launch until 2010, S4C also carried English-language programming acquired from Channel 4, which could not be received over-the-air in most of Wales; these programmes aired in non-peak hours and did not always air in pattern with Channel 4&#x27;s scheduling.

S4C has been described by as a &quot;trailblazer&quot; in European broadcasting for minority languages, going on air less than two months before Euskal Telebista (31 December 1982), TV3 Catalonia (test/trial broadcast on 11 September 1983, regular programming began in 1984) and Televisión de Galicia (24 June 1985), the first Spanish regional television stations to go on air, symbolically, in non-Castillan Spanish areas, and far ahead of other Celtic-language services, Ireland&#x27;s TG4 (formerly TnaG) (31 October 1996), the ill-fated Scottish Gaelic TeleG (1999–2011) and BBC Alba (19 September 2008). Unlike similar broadcasters in Spain who have multichannel offers impulsed mostly by digital terrestrial television, S4C still broadcasts on a single channel after the shutdown of S4C2.

On digital terrestrial television, S4C has broadcast exclusively in Welsh since the platform&#x27;s launch in 1998, with the existing bilingual schedule continuing on analogue television. After the completion of the digital switchover in Wales on 31 March 2010, Channel 4 became available on Freeview, and S4C ceased its carriage of English-language programmes. S4C offers translated, English-language subtitles for its Welsh programming. To this day, S4C remains the only Welsh-language television broadcaster in the country.

==History==
===Pre-launch===
Before the launch of S4C on Monday 1 November 1982, Welsh speakers had been served by occasional programmes in Welsh, broadcast as regional opt-outs on BBC Cymru Wales (on both of its channels) and HTV Cymru Wales (the Channel 3 franchise in Wales), as well as its predecessors usually at off-peak or inconvenient times. This was unsatisfactory for Welsh speakers, who saw the arrangement as a sop, and at the same time an annoyance for non-Welsh speakers, who found the English-language programmes seen in the rest of the UK often rescheduled or not transmitted at all.

On 14 September 1962, the ITV network created a licence area for North and West Wales, which was awarded to &quot;Wales (West and North) Limited&quot;. This traded as Teledu Cymru and provided significant levels of Welsh-language programming. However, problems with transmission infrastructure and poor market research led to financial difficulties within two years, and after going bankrupt, the station was taken over by its neighbour Television Wales and the West.

During the 1970s, coinciding with the push for a fourth national television channel in the UK, Welsh-language activists had campaigned for a television service in the language, which already had its own radio station, BBC Radio Cymru. Both the Conservative and Labour parties promised a Welsh-language fourth channel, if elected to government in the 1979 general election. Shortly after the Conservatives won a majority in the election, the new Home Secretary, William Whitelaw, decided against a Welsh fourth channel, and suggested that, except for an occasional opt-out, the service should be the same as that offered in the rest of the UK. This led to acts of civil disobedience, including refusals to pay the television licence fee, thereby running the risk of prosecution or even a prison sentence, and sit-ins in BBC and HTV studios. Some took more extreme measures, including attacking television transmitters in Welsh-speaking areas. 

By the time of the Annan report (Noel Annan, provost of University College London from 1966 to 1978), it was suggested that the fourth channel should be given to the Open Broadcasting Authority (OBA), which wouldn&#x27;t start operating until the early 1980s, with Siberry suggesting the channel to be a BBC-HTV joint venture before being handed over to the OBA. Siberry on the other hand recommended a service broadcasting content in Welsh for 25 hours a week, double the planned hours another group had suggested. The transfer of the channel to the OBA when it was operational was deemed &quot;problematic&quot;, moving away from the concept of the creation of a Welsh-language channel and a separate Welsh Broadcasting Authority. The Welsh Language Society (Cymdeithas ir Iaith) considered that &quot;the aim of the Report seemed to be find a way of keeping Welsh language broadcasting within the grasp of British infrastructure&quot;.

The government set up a Welsh Language Television Council, with members from the BBC, the IBA, ITV (limited to HTV Wales) and the OBA, with an OBA member acting as a chairman. This was proven to be a significant step for the campaign, creating an organisation overseeing broadcasting in Wales. By 1980, when the initial plans fell, there were plans to move Welsh-language programming to BBC2 Cymru Wales. The BBC thought the idea was unviable, as its schedule was not designed to receive a consistent series of opt-out slots for regions and nations, and the only programme with a fixed starting slot started at 9pm. This meant that there was no set time to leave the opt-out programming and easily rejoin the BBC2 network. This would also lead to the loss of certain programmes, including sporting events, and a dedicated teatime children&#x27;s slot would disrupt the sport output the channel had at the time, if available in the timeslot.

On 17 September 1980, the former president of Plaid Cymru, Gwynfor Evans, threatened to go on hunger strike if the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher did not honour its commitment to provide a Welsh-language television service.

===Early years===
The name S4C was the first thing to be decided at a meeting held in Gregynog on 31 January and 1 February 1981. No other names were considered for the new service. By year&#x27;s end, when the IBA was adapting transmitters to enable the carriage of Channel 4 and S4C, no transmitters in northern Wales were converted, meaning that the population in an area with a significantly large Welsh-speaking population was to be deprived of the new service. Some transmitters were not scheduled to be adapted until 1985 at latest.

S4C started broadcasting on 1 November 1982, broadcasting around 22 hours a week of programmes, mostly during prime time (7 to 9:30pm) with a teatime slot for children; with English language programmes from Channel 4, rescheduled to fit around the Welsh programmes. The first night of the channel started at 6pm with a pre-recorded bilingual preview programme fronted by Owen Edwards, which also featured the first episode of &quot;SuperTed&quot; and excerpts of Channel 4&#x27;s launch programme &quot;Preview&quot;, in anticipation for the latter&#x27;s launch the following day. The launch programme was accompanied by Robin Jones, Siân Thomas and Rowena Jones-Thomas. &quot;SuperTed&quot; opened the floodgates for the development of animation in Wales, with or without S4C&#x27;s support.

S4C&#x27;s bilingual nature rejected that the Welsh language had to be directly translated to English, as the English and Welsh viewing demographics differed heavily. Over time, the price per hour of the independent producers increased.

Owen Edwards retired from his post at S4C in 1989, having just been diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

===Later history===
S4C faced an &quot;annus horribilis&quot; in 2010. Future prospects for the channel were seen with little optimism, owing to the change in the DCMS funding method, with S4C receiving £100 million, attached to the Retail Price Index. In 2013, it was announced that the DCMS would cut S4C&#x27;s funding by around 93%. The funding hasn&#x27;t exceeded the £100 million benchmark since then, with S4C reporting £74.5 million from the license fee in the 2020–21 fiscal year, and £6.851 from the DCMS. In 2022, the DCMS stopped funding S4C, freezing license fee contributions until 2024. This was considered to be an &quot;existential threat&quot; to the Welsh language from Professor Richard Wyn Jones.

As with other public broadcasters, S4C is facing the challenge of adapting to an increasingly mobile generation of viewers, coupled with competition from streaming services.

===Relocation===
In September 2013, S4C began a study into the possible relocation of its headquarters. S4C&#x27;s former headquarters, which opened in 1991, were located at Parc Ty Glas Industrial Estate, Llanishen, following a move from Cathedral Road and Sophia Close in Pontcanna, Cardiff. In January 2013, a new multi-use media centre was opened on its Llanishen site. In March 2014, it was announced that Carmarthen was the winner with a bid led by the University of Wales Trinity Saint David (UWTSD). The university owns the land where the Canolfan S4C Yr Egin (S4C Yr Egin Centre) would be built. The building would also be home to other companies in the creative industries. There was a strong bid for relocation to Caernarfon, where the channel had a pre-existing office, but there was disappointment when that the bid was unsuccessful. In 2016, it was revealed that S4C was paying £3 million upfront rent to UWTSD, and that it would pay rent over the next 20 years. Concern was expressed about the arrangement and the lack of transparency around commercial payments between two publicly funded bodies. UWTSD applied for funding for the building work and received £3m from the Welsh Government and a further £3m from the Swansea Bay city deal.

In June 2018, it was revealed that more staff would be leaving the channel than moving to work in Carmarthen. S4C started relocating to the new building from September 2018, and 54 jobs moved to the new HQ. An office in Cardiff was retained for technical purposes until full changeover to the new BBC Wales Headquarters, with 70 staff there. A significant percentage of the technical posts were to transfer to the BBC. In September 2018, S4C committed to ten years of lease on its Caernarfon office at Doc Fictoria (Victoria Dock), which has 12 full-time staff, and was opened in 2008. In January 2021 S4C&#x27;s Presentation, Library, Promotion and Commercial departments moved to BBC Wales headquarters in Central Square, Cardiff. The first programmes were broadcast from there on 27 January 2021, beginning with the channel&#x27;s children&#x27;s service, Cyw, at 6:00 a.m. Liz Scourfield&#x27;s first live presentation aired later that morning, before the news bulletin at 12:00.

==Programming==
S4C&#x27;s remit is to provide a service which features a wide range of programmes in the Welsh language. Like Channel 4, S4C does not produce programmes of its own; instead, it commissions programmes from BBC Cymru Wales and independent producers (although the quantity purchased from ITV Cymru Wales has greatly reduced since the early years of S4C), and much like Channel 4 during its heyday, it has developed a reputation for commissioning animation, such as &quot;SuperTed&quot;, &quot;Wil Cwac Cwac&quot; (shown on ITV), &quot;Fireman Sam&quot; (also broadcast by the BBC), &quot;Rocky Hollow&quot;, &quot;The Blobs&quot; (also broadcast by Scottish Television), &quot;Gogs&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Animated Tales of the World&quot; and the 1992–1996 French co-production &quot;Natalie&quot;.

BBC Cymru Wales fulfils its public service requirement by producing programmes in Welsh, including &quot;Newyddion&quot;, S4C&#x27;s news bulletin, and a soap opera, &quot;Pobol y Cwm&quot;, and providing them to S4C free of charge. It has also provided (or licensed) Welsh-language versions of English-language programmes, such as the original &quot;Teletubbies&quot;. On the analogue service, S4C showed programmes produced for Channel 4 in the rest of the United Kingdom – either simultaneously or time-shifted – outside of peak hours. These programmes were provided to S4C by Channel 4, free of charge.

To make content more accessible to English speakers, all Welsh-language programming carries English subtitles. Originally these were on Sbectel teletext page 888, with Welsh subtitles on page 889, with both subtitle languages now also available on digital television platforms. For speakers of English who are learning Welsh, certain programmes, particularly children&#x27;s programmes &quot;Planed Plant Bach&quot; (now Cyw) and &quot;Planed Plant&quot; (now Stwnsh), carry subtitles featuring Welsh subtitles with additional English translations in brackets next to more difficult Welsh-language words. TV films produced for S4C have received some good foreign reviews; &quot;Hedd Wyn&quot; was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Oscar in 1994 and &quot;Solomon &amp; Gaenor&quot; was nominated in 2000.

The S4C analogue signal also spilled over on to the east coast of Ireland. In the past it was rebroadcast in a number of areas there on UHF terrestrial signals by so-called &#x27;deflectors&#x27;. Up until the 1990s, S4C was also carried by some Irish cable and MMDS providers before being replaced by Channel 4. The S4C channels continue to be available in the Republic of Ireland via the Freesat satellite service.

Up until 2009, S4C ran its own teletext service, Sbectel (&quot;Sbec&quot;, Welsh for &quot;a peek&quot; or &quot;a glimpse&quot;, and a reference to an S4C schedule insert formerly included in the &quot;TVTimes&quot; issues for the HTV Wales region).
In 2010 when the analogue signal for S4C was switched off all Channel 4 progammes stopped broadcasting on the channel and were replaced by its own programmes and some from the BBC Cymru Wales catalogue.

===Distribution===
S4C&#x27;s self-owned programmes are distributed internationally through S4C International (&quot;S4C Rhyngwladol CYF&quot;).

S4C formerly owned a selection of animated programmes, but on 2 October 2017, Hoho Entertainment acquired the broadcaster&#x27;s animation back catalogue.

==Viewing figures==
6.3 million people throughout the UK watched S4C on television at some time during 2022–2023. The number of people who watched S4C on TV every week throughout the UK decreased from 602,000 in 2021–2022 to 509,000 in 2022–2023. On an average week in 2022–2023, approximately 324,000 people in Wales watched S4C on TV – 8% higher than in 2021–2022 and the highest for five years. 150,000 Welsh speakers in Wales watched S4C on television each week during this period, which was 14% higher than in 2021–2022 and also the highest for five years. 20,600 was the average TV audience in the peak hours during 2022–2023.

The BARB rolling four-week viewing figures for January 2022 were 0.05% across the UK. If scaled up for Wales alone, this would be just a 1.0% audience share.

Viewing sessions of S4C content on S4C Clic and BBC iPlayer increased from 11.0 million in 2020–2021 to 11.3 million in 2021–2022. There were also 209 million impressions of S4C content on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram within that period.

The programme that enjoyed the channel&#x27;s highest viewing figures in 2022-2023 was &quot;Sgorio″s&quot; coverage of Wales&#x27; UEFA Nations League match against Belgium in September 2022, which drew 456,000 viewers.

==Digital channels==
When digital terrestrial television launched in 1998, S4C added a second, full-time Welsh-language channel called S4C Digidol (&#x27;digital&#x27;) on 1 November 1998. Following the switch-off of analogue terrestrial signals on 31 March 2010, Wales became the first fully digital region in the UK, with both S4C and Channel 4 becoming available to all homes. As a result, S4C now broadcasts solely in the Welsh language and, as well as on Freeview in Wales, is available throughout Britain, Ireland and the rest of western Europe on Freesat and Sky. A review commissioned by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport in 2004 suggested that &quot;S4C should operate a single core service after digital switchover&quot;.
In addition, S4C also operated a sister channel, S4C2 (S4C Dau) until 2010. It formerly broadcast coverage of the National Assembly for Wales when in session. The programme content was provided by the BBC who, from January 2010, now make it available online and via BBC Parliament. Like the main channel, S4C2 was available within Wales on Freeview and throughout the UK and Ireland on Freesat and Sky. S4C2 had two audio feeds, allowing viewers to select between an untranslated version and an English-only version where all Welsh spoken is translated into English. Delayed coverage of Assembly proceedings is now broadcast overnight on S4C&#x27;s main channel on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. In addition to the analogue TV signal transmitted throughout Wales, S4C, along with United News &amp; Media, owned the company S4C Digital Networks (SDN). SDN was awarded the UK-wide contract to provide half a digital multiplex worth of programming. The other half continues to belong to the broadcaster Channel 5.

On 27 April 2005, S4C sold its share of SDN to ITV plc for approximately £34 million, though it still has the half-multiplex as of right in Wales. ITV already owned some of SDN due to the consolidation of the ITV industry: Granada bought UNM&#x27;s stake in SDN, and this was then incorporated into the united ITV plc. In January 2007, S4C announced plans to launch a Welsh-language children&#x27;s service. The new service, in the form of a programming block, launched on 23 June 2008. Under the name Cyw (chick), it brings together a wide range of programmes for nursery-age children, and S4C plans eventually to extend the service to include the Stwnsh strand for older children and a third service for teenagers and young people. The service currently airs on weekdays from 7 am to 1.30 pm on S4C.

S4C launched a high-definition simulcast of S4C called &#x27;Clirlun&#x27; on 19 July 2010 to coincide with terrestrial digital switchover in Wales. Clirlun was broadcast on Freeview channel 53 only, and not via other platforms. However, following funding cuts and a review of core services it was announced on 11 July 2012 that Clirlun would close before the end of the year. Clirlun closed at midnight on the evening of 1 December 2012, with Channel 4 HD taking over its transmission capacity with effect from the next day, 2 December 2012.

It was announced on 20 May 2016 that S4C would relaunch a high definition service S4C HD on Freesat and Sky in Wales and across the UK from 7 June onwards. Following the 2016 relaunch of S4C HD, the channel returned to Freeview in HD from 7pm on Wednesday 19 January 2022. It will broadcast for peak viewing hours only, from 7pm on weekday evenings and from 2pm on weekends, sharing capacity with the HD version of the BBC&#x27;s children&#x27;s service CBBC.

In December 2014, S4C became available on the BBC iPlayer website, both live and on demand, initially as part of an 18-month trial.

==Presentation==
===1982–1987===

S4C launched on 1 November 1982 (the day before Channel 4 started in England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland), its on-air appearance has always been a representation of Welsh society and people, but this representation has changed several times. Initial idents featured clips from the natural landscapes of Wales with a basic logo animation and a synthesizer fanfare, with the logo forming as &quot;WALES4CYMRU&quot;. The logo was designed by Martin Lambie-Nairn, who also designed Channel 4&#x27;s logo.

===1987–1993===

On 25 May 1987, the ident changed to a computer-generated ident featuring an animation of the streamlined S4C logo and the colours of the logo was blue, green, and red. The font used for this logo was a modified Bodoni MT. The new identity improved the channel&#x27;s corporate image, removing the complex WALES4CYMRU branding. On 7 September 1990, the new ident was introduced, depicting a piece of Welsh slate with colours blue, green, and red washing over the letters S4C until 31 May 1993.

===1993–2007===

On 1 June 1993, S4C introduced a new series of idents, which depicted inanimate objects as having characteristics of dragons (such as flight or breathing fire), as a reference to the red dragon on the flag of Wales. In June 1995, the channel introduced a new logo (in the Futura typeface) replaces the original serif logo, featuring a tilde representing a dragon with a flame next to the &quot;C&quot; as if were breathing fire. The addition of such a symbol would reflect &quot;Welsh heritage and culture&quot; and that the flame was &quot;cheap to reproduce&quot;. The symbol worked both in red and black and white settings, something the previous logo didn&#x27;t. The idents were designed, created, and directed by Charlotte Castle, Brian Eley, and Martin Lambie-Nairn.

===2007–2014===

On 18 January 2007, S4C announced that their digital channels would be refreshed with a new corporate logo and brand. The new branding was implemented online on 17 January, with S4C&#x27;s television channels adopting it the next day. The new branding, developed by the London-based firm Proud Creative, was intended to portray S4C as a more &quot;contemporary&quot; multi-platform broadcaster, and downplayed &quot;traditional&quot; Welsh imagery such as dragons. Its idents were filmed around various parts of the country, and themed around magnetism—representing the &quot;uncontrollable attraction&quot; of Welsh people and their &quot;emotional affinity to the homeland, whether near or far&quot;. The magnetism-themed idents were later accompanied by a new set developed in collaboration with the agency Minivegas, consisting of live-action scenes with dynamic, animated elements that can react to the voice of the continuity announcer.

===2014–present===
A new S4C logo and brand developed by Sugar Creative was introduced on 10 April 2014; the new design was developed around the concept of providing &quot;context&quot; to S4C&#x27;s target audience and programming. The design revolves heavily around a trapezium shape used within the channel&#x27;s new logo, which is prominently used within aspects of the channel&#x27;s overall marketing and branding.

==Criticisms==
S4C has faced criticism for poor viewing figures since its launch. Leaked internal reports in March 2010 showed that &#x27;over the 20-day period from 15 February to last Saturday, 6 March, as many as 196 of the 890 programmes put out by S4C were rated as having zero viewers&#x27;. The story was widely reported across the UK and was referenced in Parliament by the then Culture Secretary, Jeremy Hunt. In response, an S4C spokesperson stated that 90% of those programmes were aimed at pre-school children, and that BARB (the organisation that compiles television ratings in the UK) only takes into account viewers aged four years and over. The remaining 10% consisted of repeats and daytime news bulletins which did not attract the minimum 1,000 viewers necessary to register on a UK-wide analysis.

On 28 July 2010, S4C&#x27;s chief executive, Iona Jones, left her post without explanation. Assembly members and Members of Parliament requested an independent investigation into the circumstances leading up to her departure. The S4C Authority refused to comment further and commissioned a review into how the broadcaster was governed in August 2010. On 3 February 2011, it was announced that issues between Iona Jones and S4C had been settled. Eight days later, the Shortridge Report on corporate governance was made public.

==Funding and regulation==
From its inception, S4C was in part publicly financed: funding came both from its advertising revenue and a fixed annual grant from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), receiving £102m in 2010 and then £90m in 2011 after the Conservative Party won the general elections in 2010 which consequently made considerable cuts to its funding. Additionally, some Welsh-language programming (including &quot;Newyddion&quot; and &quot;Pobol y Cwm&quot;) was produced by BBC Wales as part of the BBC&#x27;s public service remit, and provided to S4C free of charge. There is an agreement in place until 2022 for 10 hours a week of programming to be provided to S4C, which is valued at £19.4m annually.

From 2013, responsibility for funding S4C began to transfer to the BBC, with the DCMS reducing its funding by 94% by 2015. The BBC was to provide around £76m of funding to S4C by this date, resulting in a cut of around 25% to S4C&#x27;s annual budget. In 2016, it was agreed that the BBC would provide £74.5m a year funding to S4C from the licence fee until 2022. The UK government announced in 2018 that it would continue providing £6.72m until 2020, with the aim of S4C being funded wholly from the licence fee from 2022. This would see S4C&#x27;s funding being decided as part of the licence fee settlement, for 10-year periods.

Prior to 2011, S4C received ~£102m (which would be an estimate of ~£122.8m in January 2022 after inflation), with the new allocated funds of 2022 (which is £82m), the loss in 2022 alone compared with 2010 is estimated to be ~£40.8m and an overall loss of ~£450m between 2011 and 2022.

In addition to public funding, S4C generates around 2% of its income through commercial sources, such as advertising.

S4C is controlled by the S4C Authority (&quot;Awdurdod S4C&quot;), an independent body unconnected to Ofcom. Ofcom are the regulator for S4C&#x27;s content, as they are with other UK television channels such as ITV and Channel 4.

, the Media and Journalism Research Center evaluated S4C to be &quot;Independent State Managed/Owned Media&quot; under its State Media Matrix.

==Catch-up service==

S4C maintains its own catch-up service called Clic. Clic is a free online video on demand service which offers live-streaming, signed programming, a 35-day catch-up service, and archive programming. Clic is available across the UK but also contains a limited selection of worldwide programming. Clic&#x27;s catch-up service is split into seven categories: Drama, Entertainment, Factual and Arts, Music, Sport, and two Children&#x27;s categories, Cyw (ages 3–6) and Stwnsh (ages 7–13). A Clic app was released for Apple&#x27;s iOS devices on 18 August 2011.

In late 2014, S4C&#x27;s programmes and live-streaming also became available to view on the BBC&#x27;s catch-up service, BBC iPlayer. It contains no ads, ads are replaced by a static screen saying &#x27;progammes will countine after the break&#x27;. Both services offer English and Welsh subtitles to some shows.

There were 8.2 million viewing sessions to S4C content on Clic and BBC iPlayer in 2017–2018. This was an increase of 600,000 from the 7.6 million viewing sessions on those platforms in 2016–2017. In the 2020–2021 period, the viewing session number increased to 11 million. Viewing figures on Clic and iPlayer was at an all-time high in 2022–23. 596,000 hours of S4C content was viewed on Clic during that year. A further 2,680,000 hours of content was viewed on the iPlayer.

<text>Fernão Pires de Andrade (also spelled as Fernão Peres de Andrade; in contemporary sources, Fernam (Fernã) Perez Dandrade) (d. 1552) was a Portuguese merchant, pharmacist, and diplomat who worked under the explorer and colonial administrator Afonso de Albuquerque. His encounter with Ming China in 1517—after initial contacts by Jorge Álvares and Rafael Perestrello in 1513 and 1516, respectively—marked the resumption of direct European commercial and diplomatic contact with China. (Even though there were Europeans in Medieval China, notably Marco Polo, that period of contact had been interrupted by the fall of the Yuan dynasty.)

Although de Andrade&#x27;s mission was initially a success that allowed a Portuguese embassy to proceed all the way to Beijing, relations were soon spoiled by culminating events that led to an extremely negative impression of the Portuguese in China. This included acts of his brother Simão that enraged the Chinese, false reports of the Portuguese being cannibals of kidnapped Chinese children and true reports of their conquest of Malacca, a loyal Ming tributary state. Normalized trade and relations between Portugal and the Ming dynasty would not resume until the late 1540s and the 1557 establishment of Portuguese rule over Macau.

Andrade was referred to as a &quot;Folangji&quot; () in Ming dynastic archives. &quot;Folangji&quot; comes from &quot;Franques&quot; or Franks, which was a generic name the Muslims called Europeans since the Crusades, and which spawned the Indian-Southeast Asian term &quot;ferengi&quot;. The Chinese adopted the convention when they first thought the Portuguese were related to those Muslim guides and interpreters during Fernão&#x27;s first encounter and before Europeans directly convened with Chinese.

==Voyages abroad==

===India, Sumatra, and Malacca===
Fernão Pires de Andrade commanded a vessel in the naval venture of the Portuguese explorer and conqueror Afonso de Albuquerque from Cochin in India to conquer the Malacca Sultanate in 1511. The Portuguese historian João de Barros (1496–1570) wrote that when a violent storm arose as Albuquerque&#x27;s fleet entered the vast waters between Sri Lanka and Aceh, a ship commanded by Simão Martinho was sunk, but his entire crew was rescued by Fernão and taken aboard his ship. To make up for this loss, the Portuguese captured and commandeered five ships from Gujarat that were sailing between Malacca and Sumatra. The small fleet of Albuquerque engaged an enemy &quot;junk&quot; ship of the Javanese &quot;Moors&quot; near &quot;Polvoreira&quot; (likely &quot;Pulau Berhala&quot;, 160 miles from Malacca, between Belawan, Medan and Lumut, Perak). According to Barros, they fought against this ship for two days. The enemy crew employed tactics of lighting fire to its own ship as a means to burn Albuquerque&#x27;s ships as they employed ramming techniques and close-range volleys of artillery. Although the ship surrendered; the Portuguese gained such an admiration for the junk and its crew that they nicknamed it &quot;O Bravo&quot; (The Brave Junk). The Portuguese crew pleaded with Fernão Pires to convince Albuquerque that the crew should be spared and viewed vassals of Portugal who were simply unaware of who they were actually fighting. Albuquerque eventually agreed to this.

While writing of Afonso de Albuquerque&#x27;s ventures in Sumatra, João de Barros noted that the Chinese were the first to control trade between Sumatra and India, and noted the presence of Chinese people living in Sumatra. Barros also noted that while Fernão Pires was loading Southeast Asian spices onto his ship in Pacem (a kingdom in Sumatra) in order to sell or present them as gifts in China, two different kings were killed and their position usurped. Apparently the usurpation of kings caused little tumult or crisis in this state, as Barros noted any leader there was believed by the locals not to have divine right to rule if he was able to be killed by a royal kinsman. Historian Mark Dion notes that Fernão related the same story in his writing, only adding that a Muslim in their society was the only acceptable replacement as ruler.

===Initial contact with China===

After the conquest of Malacca in 1511, not only did the Portuguese monopolize the European spice trade, but they also met and traded avidly with Chinese merchants. When Portuguese under Diogo Lopes de Sequeira had earlier arrived in Malacca in 1509 to open trade relations, he was supported by the local Chinese merchants there (along with Javanese and Tamil merchants). D&#x27;Albuquerque sent Jorge Álvares to explore northward; his expedition sailed along the coast of Guangdong in 1513 and hoisted a flag on &quot;Tuen Mun island&quot;. This mission was followed up later that year by Rafael Perestrello, who later traded with Chinese merchants of Canton in 1516. He provided an enticing report to other Portuguese on the lucrative trade in China. This prompted Andrade to speed up the course of his mission while stalled in Malacca and debate with his crew on whether to go to China or Bengal.

===Mission of Manuel I to China===

====Choosing the ambassadors====
King Manuel I authorized a trade mission in 1517 when Andrade set sail with seven cannon-armed merchant vessels with a Muslim interpreter on June 17, 1517. Andrade had been chosen for this mission in Lisbon back in 1515, so that—as a pharmacist—he could investigate the types of pharmaceutical drugs used in East Asia for the benefit of the Portuguese and Europe. Florentine merchant Giovanni da Empoli, who had written a report about trade with China while stationed in India, was also chosen for the mission as the chief commercial agent between the Portuguese and Chinese. However, Giovanni would die in China during the early mission on October 15, 1517, when the ship he was on accidentally caught on fire. Tomé Pires, a royal apothecary who had also traveled to India and written a landmark work in 1515 on Asian trade, was chosen as the chief ambassador for the mission.

====First contact====
Although the mission was stalled once they lost a ship in the Strait of Malacca, they nonetheless landed at the Pearl River estuary on August 15 with eight ships and negotiated with Chinese officials for possible silk and porcelain trade at Canton. The Chinese naval commander of Nantou (under the jurisdiction of Zhongshan, located at the mouth of the Pearl River) stalled Andrade&#x27;s small fleet of ships for an entire month while Andrade waited for permission to sail upriver to Canton. After Andrade threatened to sail upriver without permission, the naval commander finally decided to let him pass, granting him pilots to assist his travel.

Once the ships sailed into port at Canton, they alarmed the Chinese residents and officials there by discharging cannon fire, what they believed was a friendly salute since the Chinese merchants had done so when the Portuguese earlier arrived in Malacca. Chinese officials became even more cautious in dealing with the Portuguese, since the deposed King of Malacca had been a loyal tributary to the imperial Ming court. The Portuguese explained that in deposing the Malaccan king, they were helping the Chinese merchants there who were being oppressed under his rule. In the eyes of the Canton officials, this added further negative speculations about the Portuguese visitors, because private Chinese overseas trade was banned under the current hai jin laws that stated only the Chinese government could conduct foreign trade.
Although the local Canton officials watched the Portuguese and their ships closely, once the provincial authorities arrived at Canton they greeted the Portuguese with a warm reception, providing them comfortable lodgings and had their trade goods brought ashore. The Chinese became suspicious once again of Andrade, this time for being a spy, when he sent a ship along the Fujian coast to look for further trade prospects, but he left a good impression when he gave the order that any locals who might be harmed by a Portuguese should seek him for redress. Besides exploring Fujian, Andrade sent one of his captains named Jorge de Mascarenhas to explore the Ryukyu Islands after he heard of their beauty while stationed in Malacca.

====Andrade&#x27;s brother and spoiled relations====

Simão de Andrade, brother to Fernão Pires, sailed from Malacca to China with a small crew on three junks in August 1519. Simão immediately made a bad impression upon the Chinese when he built a fort at the center of Tuen Mun, an island designated for all foreigners to trade. Soon after, Simão ceremoniously executed a Portuguese and barred other foreigners (mostly Siamese and other South East Asians) from trading on the island, which drew even more attention to him. When a Chinese official visited the island and began reasserting Ming authority over it, Simão became aggressive and hit him, knocking the official&#x27;s hat off.

The greatest offense to the Chinese was the supposed kidnapping of children by the Portuguese so they could eat them. In reality, Simão had earned the Portuguese a bad reputation for buying young Chinese slaves, presumably some of whom were kidnapped after Simão offered local Chinese huge sums of money for child slaves. In fact, some boys and girls from wealthy Chinese families were later found by Portuguese authorities at Diu in western India. However, there were no official reports of Simão&#x27;s abuses, even though he stayed until September 1520; yet rumors of his behavior (which became associated with all Portuguese) no doubt reached as far as the court of Beijing, which would soon condemn the Portuguese for this and other reasons.

Although he had left Canton, Simão de Andrade landed at Xiamen and Ningbo, establishing settlements there. Simão continued to defy local Chinese laws at Ningbo, and when his men were cheated on a trade deal with a Chinese man in 1545, Simão sent a band of armed men into the town, pillaged it, and took local women and young girls as their captives. The outraged locals banded together and slaughtered the Portuguese under Simão. A similar episode occurred later when Coelho de Sousa seized the house of a wealthy foreign resident in Jinzhou of Fujian, which led authorities to cut off supplies to the Portuguese; the Portuguese then attacked and ransacked a nearby village for supplies, which prompted Chinese authorities to destroy thirteen of their ships while thirty Portuguese survivors of this settlement fled to the Portuguese settlement at Macau in 1549.

====End of the mission====

The embassy party left behind in Canton in 1518 proceeded north in January 1520 with the rest of the Portuguese under Tomé Pires and Fernão Pires de Andrade. The embassy reached Nanjing, where the Zhengde Emperor was touring in May 1520, granting the Portuguese embassy a quick audience. However, further diplomatic negotiations were to be resumed once the emperor returned to Beijing; hence, the Portuguese embassy was sent there to wait for the emperor&#x27;s return.

Although no Chinese sources detail the event, Portuguese sources tell of how the Portuguese were summoned on the first and fifteenth days of each lunar month to ceremoniously prostrate themselves before a wall of the Forbidden City to seek another audience with the emperor. From Beijing, the Portuguese embassy heard reports that the emperor reached Tongzhou in January 1521 and had the rebel Prince of Ning executed there. The Portuguese embassy had also become aware that ambassadors from the exiled King of Malacca were sent to Beijing seeking assistance from the Chinese emperor in expelling the conquering Portuguese so that their king could be reinstalled there. The Portuguese also knew of two officials in the Censorate—Qiu Daolong and He Ao— who sent memorials to the throne that condemned the Portuguese conquest of Malacca and that their embassy should be rejected. There were also reports sent to Beijing by Canton officials stating that the Portuguese were bothersome foreigners who sought to build their own trading post.

With the death of the Zhengde Emperor on April 19, 1521, mourning ceremonies were initiated that cancelled all other ceremonies, including the reception of foreign embassies. The newly appointed Grand Secretary, Yang Tinghe, soon turned against the powerful eunuch influence at court, which had grown even more powerful under the Zhengde Emperor. Although Ming officials were of the opinion that only foreign tributary states listed during the beginning of the dynasty should be accepted at court, it was the eunuchs who wanted to expand commercial ties with new foreign countries. These desires were given free rein under the Zhengde Emperor, who was intrigued with and desired to learn about foreign and exotic peoples. However, with his death, eunuch influence at court was challenged by Yang Tinghe, who announced the rejection of the Portuguese embassy under Pires and Andrade the day after the emperor&#x27;s death; the embassy was forced to leave and arrived back in Canton in September.

===Open hostility to reopening of relations===
Earlier, in April and May 1521, five Portuguese ships docked at Tuen Mun to begin trading, but were ordered to leave once officials came to the region to announce the emperor&#x27;s death. The Portuguese refused this demand, so the Chinese sent a naval squadron to drive them out, sinking one ship, killing many, and taking the rest as prisoners (First Battle of Tamao). Two more Portuguese vessels arrived in June, were attacked by Chinese ships, but were able to fend off the Chinese attack. Three more Portuguese ships barely fended off another attack in September, the same month that Fernão Pires de Andrade and Tomé Pires arrived back at Canton. Ming authorities would not permit Fernão and Pires to see the prisoners captured in the sea battles and made inventories of their goods and the goods captured from the Portuguese ships.

In August 1522, Martim Afonso de Melo Coutinho arrived at Tuen Mun with three ships, unaware of the conflict and expecting to meet with Chinese officials on establishing consent for a Portuguese trade base in China. Two of his ships were captured in a surprise Chinese attack, while the survivors escaped back to Portugal on the third ship (see Second Battle of Tamao). These encounters and others with the Portuguese brought the first breech-loading culverins into China, mentioned even by the philosopher and scholar-official Wang Yangming in 1519 when he suppressed Zhu Chenhao&#x27;s rebellion in Jiangxi.

The prisoners of these sea battles were eventually executed in 1523 for crimes of &quot;robbery in the high seas&quot; and cannibalism, while Tomé Pires was kept prisoner so that he could write letters to the King of Portugal, the Viceroy of Portuguese India, and the Governor of Malacca conveying the new Ming emperor&#x27;s message that the Portuguese should leave Malacca and restore it to the rightful rule of its deposed king. By some accounts, Fernão Pires de Andrade simply died while imprisoned; others say Andrade was one of those beheaded when a crime of false credentials was placed upon him after a court examined if his embassy was legitimate or spurious due to negative accounts of the Portuguese (i.e. acts committed by those such as Fernão Pires&#x27; brother Simào). Tomé Pires died while living as a prisoner in China; there is speculation on whether Tomé Pires died in 1524 or 1540. Two survivors of this embassy were still alive around 1536, when they sent letters to Malacca and Goa detailing plans for how the Portuguese could capture Canton by force. Other survivors of these missions retired to nearby Lampaco (Lampa) in Guangdong, where a trade post would exist for several decades; in 1537, there were written records of the Portuguese having three warehouses at Lampa, Shangchuan Island, and Macau, and were initially allowed there with the excuse of drying their goods in a storm.

Despite initial hostilities, good relations between the Portuguese and Chinese would resume in 1549 with annual Portuguese trade missions to Shangchuan Island, following an event where the Portuguese helped Ming authorities eliminate coastal pirates. In 1554, Leonel de Sousa—a later Governor of Macau— established positive relations through an agreement with Cantonese authorities and in 1557 the Ming court finally gave consent for a permanent and official Portuguese trade base at Macau. Although Fernão Pires de Andrade and his Portuguese comrades were the first to open up China to the West, another significant diplomatic mission reaching all the way to Beijing would not be carried out until an Italian, the Jesuit Matteo Ricci (1552–1610) ventured there in 1598.

<text>ATI Technologies Inc. was a Canadian semiconductor technology corporation based in Markham, Ontario, that specialized in the development of graphics processing units and chipsets. Founded in 1985, the company listed publicly in 1993 and was acquired by AMD in 2006. As a major fabless semiconductor company, ATI conducted research and development in-house and outsourced the manufacturing and assembly of its products. With the decline and eventual bankruptcy of 3dfx in 2000, ATI and its chief rival Nvidia emerged as the two dominant players in the graphics processors industry, eventually forcing other manufacturers into niche roles.

The acquisition of ATI in 2006 was important to AMD&#x27;s strategic development of its Fusion series of computer processors, which integrated general processing abilities with graphics processing functions within a single chip, which would become a popular option on computers in the following years, especially lower cost models.

In 2010, AMD ceased using the ATI brand name, renaming its flagship Radeon graphics processor products with its branding instead.

==History==
Lee Ka Lau, Francis Lau, Benny Lau, and Kwok Yuen Ho founded ATI in 1985 as Array Technology Inc.
Working primarily in the OEM field, ATI produced integrated graphics cards for PC manufacturers such as IBM and Commodore. By 1987, ATI had grown into an independent graphics-card retailer, introducing EGA Wonder and VGA Wonder card product lines that year. In the early nineties, they released products able to process graphics without the CPU: in May 1991, the Mach8, in 1992 the Mach32, which offered improved memory bandwidth and GUI acceleration. ATI Technologies Inc. went public in 1993, with shares listed on NASDAQ and on the Toronto Stock Exchange.


In 1994, the Mach64 accelerator debuted, powering the Graphics Xpression and Graphics Pro Turbo, offering hardware support for YUV-to-RGB colour space conversion in addition to hardware zoom; early techniques of hardware-based video acceleration.

ATI introduced its first combination of 2D and 3D accelerator under the name 3D Rage. This chip was based on the Mach 64, but it featured elemental 3D acceleration. The ATI Rage line powered almost the entire range of ATI graphics products. In particular, the Rage Pro was one of the first viable 2D-plus-3D alternatives to 3dfx&#x27;s 3D-only Voodoo chipset. 3D acceleration in the Rage line advanced from the basic functionality within the initial 3D Rage to a more advanced DirectX 6.0 accelerator in 1999 Rage 128.

The All-in-Wonder product line, introduced in 1996, was the first combination of integrated graphics chip with TV tuner card and the first chip that enabled display of computer graphics on a TV set. The cards featured 3D acceleration powered by ATI&#x27;s 3D Rage II, 64-bit 2D performance, TV-quality video acceleration, analogue video capture, TV tuner functionality, flicker-free TV-out and stereo TV audio reception.

ATI entered the mobile computing sector by introducing 3D-graphics acceleration to laptops in 1996. The Mobility product line had to meet requirements different from those of desktop PCs, such as minimized power usage, reduced heat output, TMDS output capabilities for laptop screens, and maximized integration. In 1997, ATI acquired Tseng Labs&#x27;s graphics assets, which included 40 engineers.

The Radeon line of graphics products was unveiled in 2000. The initial Radeon graphics processing unit offered an all-new design with DirectX 7.0 3D acceleration, video acceleration, and 2D acceleration. Technology developed for a specific Radeon generation could be built in varying levels of features and performance in order to provide products suited for the entire market range, from high-end to budget to mobile versions.

In 2000, ATI acquired ArtX, which engineered the Flipper graphics chip used in the GameCube video game console. They also created a modified version of the chip (codenamed Hollywood) for the successor of the GameCube, the Wii. Microsoft contracted ATI to design the graphics core (codenamed Xenos) for the Xbox 360. Later in 2005, ATI acquired Terayon&#x27;s cable modem silicon intellectual property, strengthening their lead in the consumer digital television market. K. Y. Ho remained as Chairman of the Board until he retired in November 2005. Dave Orton replaced him as the President and CEO of the organization.

On July 24, 2006, a joint announcement revealed that AMD would acquire ATI in a deal valued at $5.6 billion. The acquisition consideration closed on October 25, 2006, and included over $2 billion financed from a loan and 56 million shares of AMD stock. ATI&#x27;s operations became part of the AMD Graphics Product Group (GPG), and ATI&#x27;s CEO Dave Orton became the Executive Vice President of Visual and Media Businesses at AMD until his resignation in 2007. The top-level management was reorganized with the Senior Vice President and General Manager, and the Senior Vice President and General Manager of Consumer Electronics Group, both of whom would report to the CEO of AMD. On 30 August 2010, John Trikola announced that AMD would retire the ATI brand for its graphics chipsets in favour of the AMD name.

==Products==
In addition to developing high-end GPUs (originally called a VPU, visual processing unit, by ATI) for PCs and Apple Macs, ATI also designed embedded versions for laptops (Mobility Radeon), PDAs and mobile phones (Imageon), integrated motherboards (Radeon IGP), and others.

&quot;Ruby&quot;, a fictional female character described as a &quot;mercenary for hire&quot;, was created by ATI to promote some of its products. Computer-animated videos produced by RhinoFX about Ruby on a mission (being a sniper, saboteur, hacker and so on) appeared at large technology shows such as &quot;CeBIT&quot; and &quot;CES&quot;.

===Computer graphics chipsets===
* Graphics Solution / &quot;Small Wonder&quot; – Series of 8-bit ISA cards with MDA, Hercules, CGA and Plantronics Color+ compatibility using the United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) UM6845E CRT controller. Later versions added EGA support.
* EGA / VGA Wonder – IBM &quot;EGA/VGA-compatible&quot; display adapters (1987)
* Mach Series – Introduced ATI&#x27;s first 2D GUI &quot;Windows Accelerator&quot;. As the series evolved, GUI acceleration improved dramatically and early video acceleration appeared.
* Rage Series – ATI&#x27;s first 2D and 3D accelerator chips. The series evolved from rudimentary 3D with 2D GUI acceleration and MPEG-1 capability, to a highly competitive Direct3D 6 accelerator with then &quot;best-in-class&quot; DVD (MPEG2) acceleration. The various chips were very popular with OEMs of the time. The Rage II was used in the first ATI All-In-Wonder multi-function video card, and more advanced All-In-Wonders based on Rage series GPUs followed. (1995–2004)
** Rage Mobility – Designed for use in low-power environments, such as notebooks. These chips were functionally similar to their desktop counterparts but had additions such as advanced power management, LCD interfaces, and dual monitor functionality.
* Radeon Series – ATI launched the Radeon line in 2000, as their consumer 3D accelerator add-in cards, its flagship product line and the direct competitor to Nvidia&#x27;s GeForce. The original &quot;Radeon DDR&quot; was ATI&#x27;s first DirectX 7 3D accelerator, introducing their first hardware T&amp;L engine. ATI often produced &#x27;Pro&#x27; versions with higher clock speeds, and sometimes an extreme &#x27;XT&#x27; version, and even more recently &#x27;XT Platinum Edition (PE)&#x27; and &#x27;XTX&#x27; versions. The Radeon series was the basis for many ATI All-In-Wonder boards.
** Mobility Radeon – A series of power-optimized versions of Radeon graphics chips for use in laptops. They introduced innovations such as modularized RAM chips, DVD (MPEG2) acceleration, notebook GPU card sockets, and &quot;PowerPlay&quot; power management technology. AMD recently announced DirectX 11-compatible versions of its mobile processors.
** ATI CrossFire – This technology was ATI&#x27;s response to NVIDIA&#x27;s SLI platform. It allowed, by using a secondary video card and a dual PCI-E motherboard based on an ATI Crossfire compatible chipset, the ability to combine the power of the two, three or four video cards to increase performance through a variety of different rendering options. There is an option for additional PCI-E video card plugging into the third PCI-E slot for gaming physics, or another option to do physics on the second video card.
* FireGL/FirePro – Launched in 2001, following ATI&#x27;s acquisition of FireGL Graphics from Diamond Multimedia. Workstation CAD/CAM video card, based on the Radeon series.
* FireMV – For workstations, featuring &quot;multi-view&quot;, for multiple displays with 2D acceleration only, usually based on low-end products of the Radeon series (now integrated into FirePro series).

Although AMD strongly considered making the functional part of the ATI drivers &quot;open source&quot;, before the merger with AMD, ATI had no plans to release their graphics drivers as free software:
===Personal computer platforms and chipsets===
* IGP 3x0, Mobility Radeon 7000 IGP – ATI&#x27;s first chipsets. Included a DirectX 7-level 3D graphics processor.
* 9100 IGP – 2nd generation system chipset. IXP250 southbridge. It was notable for being ATI&#x27;s first complete motherboard chipset, including an ATI-built southbridge. It included an updated DirectX 8.1 class graphics processor
* Xpress 200/200P – PCI Express-based Athlon 64 and Pentium 4 chipset. Supports SATA as well as integrated graphics with DirectX 9.0 support, the first integrated graphics chipset to do so
* Xpress 3200 – similar to &quot;Xpress 200&quot;, but designed for optimal CrossFire performance.

In addition to the above chipset, ATI struck a deal in 2005, with CPU and motherboard manufacturers, particularly Asus and Intel, to create onboard 3D Graphics solutions for Intel&#x27;s range of motherboards released with their range of Intel Pentium M-based desktop processors, the Intel Core and Intel Core 2 processors, the D101GGC and D101GGC2 chipset (codenamed &quot;&quot;Grand County&quot;) based on the Radeon Xpress 200 chipset. However, high-end boards with integrated graphics processor (IGP) still used Intel GMA integrated graphics processors. The deal with Intel ended with the purchase of ATI by AMD in 2006, with Intel announcing SiS IGP chipset (D201GLY chipset, codenamed &quot;Little Valley&quot;) for entry-level desktop platform, replacing the &quot;Grand County&quot;&quot; series chipsets.

===Multimedia and digital TV products===
* All-in-Wonder series – A series of multimedia graphics cards which incorporating TV tuner and Radeon family graphics cards onto one add-in card, which, after being seemingly discontinued was relaunched as All-in-Wonder HD on June 26, 2008.
* TV tuners
** TV Wonder and HDTV Wonder – a chipset family providing TV reception of various analogue TV and digital TV signals (PAL, NTSC, ATSC, DVB-T and so on) with first generation AVIVO technology, also supporting CableCARD, and Clear QAM technologies.
** Theater – a family of QAM and VSB demodulators for the Digital Cable ready and ATSC environments.
* Remote Wonder, wireless remote control series for ATI multimedia products. Operates using radio frequency, away from mainstream implementations using infrared.

===Console graphics products===
* Flipper – The GameCube (codenamed &quot;dolphin&quot; during production) contains a 3D accelerator developed by &quot;ArtX, Inc&quot;, a company acquired by ATI during the development of the GPU. Flipper was similar in capability to a Direct3D 7 accelerator chip. It consisted of four rendering pipelines, with hardware T&amp;L, and some limited pixel shader support. Innovatively the chip has 3 MB of embedded 1T-SRAM for use as ultra-fast low-latency (6.2 ns) texture and framebuffer/Z-buffer storage allowing 10.4 GB/second bandwidth (extremely fast for the time). Flipper was designed by members of the Nintendo 64 Reality Coprocessor team who moved from SGI. The Flipper team went on to have a major hand in the development of the Radeon 9700.
* Xenos – Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox 360 video game console contains a custom graphics chip produced by ATI, known as &quot;R400&quot;, &quot;C1&quot;, internally as &quot;Crayola&quot;, or more often as &quot;Xenos&quot;. Some of these features include the embedded DRAM (eDRAM). The Xenos also features the “True Unified Shader Architecture” which dynamically loads and balances pixel and vertex processing amongst a bank of identically capable processing units. This differs greatly from PC graphics chips of previous generations that have separate banks of processors designed for their individual task (vertex/fragment). Another feature presented in Xenos is the hardware surface tessellation to divide a surface into smaller triangles, similar to TruForm in terms of functionality, which is an advanced feature as it is not presented even in the DirectX 10 specification. The recent generation Radeon R600 GPU core inherited most of the features presented in Xenos, except eDRAM.
* Hollywood – Successor to Flipper. Part of Nintendo&#x27;s gaming console, Wii.

===Handheld chipsets===
* Imageon – System-on-a-chip (SoC) design introduced in 2002, to bring integrated 2D and 3D graphics to handhelds devices, mobile phones and Tablet PCs. The Imageon 2298 included DVD quality recording and playback, TV output, and supported up to a 12-megapixel camera, with another line of Imageon products, the 2300 series supporting OpenGL ES 1.1+ extensions. The Imageon line was rebranded under AMD as Adreno, and sold to Qualcomm in 2009.
* Imageon TV – Announced in February 2006, allowing handhelds devices to receive digital broadcast TV (DVB-H) signals and enables watching TV programs on these devices, the chipset includes tuner, demodulator, decoder, and a full software stack, operates alongside the Imageon chip.

Besides full products, ATI also supplied 3D and 2D graphics components to other vendors, specifically the Qualcomm MSM7000 series SoC chips of handheld and upcoming Freescale i. MX processors ATI claimed in May 2006, that it had sold over 100 million &#x27;cell phone media co-processors&#x27;, significantly more than ATI&#x27;s rival NVIDIA, and announced in February 2007, that the firm had shipped a total of 200 million of Imageon products since 2003.

After the AMD acquisition, the Imageon and Xilleon were sold off to Qualcomm and Broadcom, respectively.

===High-performance computing===
* ATI Firestream, using the stream processing concept, together with Close to Metal (CTM) hardware interface. After the AMD acquisition, it was succeeded by AMD FireStream in 2006, rebranded as AMD Stream Processor until 2012.

<doc id="177423" wikidata="Q7696993" url="?curid=177423" title="Television broadcasting in Australia">
<text>Television broadcasting in Australia began officially on 16 September 1956, with the opening of TCN-9, quickly followed by national and commercial stations in Sydney and Melbourne, all these being in 625-line black and white. The commencement date was designed so as to provide coverage of the Olympic Games in Melbourne. It has now grown to be a nationwide system that includes a broad range of public, commercial, community, subscription, narrowcast, and amateur stations.

Colour television in the PAL 625-line format was introduced in 1967 and went to a full-time basis on 1 March 1975 while subscription television, on the Galaxy platform, began in January 1995. Digital terrestrial television was introduced on 1 January 2001 in Australia&#x27;s five largest capital cities.

As early as 1929, two Melbourne commercial radio stations, 3UZ and 3DB were conducting experimental mechanical television broadcasts these were conducted in the early hours of the morning, after the stations had officially closed down. In 1934, Dr Val McDowall at amateur station 4CM Brisbane conducted experiments in electronic television.

==Public television==
Australia has three national public broadcasters, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the Special Broadcasting Service, and, as more recently, National Indigenous Television.

===Australian Broadcasting Corporation===
ABC Television is a division of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, established in 1956. ABC TV, ABC Family, ABC Entertains and ABC News are available nationally, in to ABC Australia (Southeast Asian TV channel), focused at the Asia Pacific region.

ABC TV carries a variety of local and national news, current affairs, and sports coverage, as well as Australian arts and comedy programming. It is well known for broadcasting British programming, primarily from the BBC, ITV, and Channel 4.

ABC Family, established as a second digital-only channel called ABC2 on 7 March 2005. Originally aimed at providing &#x27;more choice, more often&#x27;, the channel mainly provided repeats of popular ABC productions, such as &quot;Australian Story&quot; and &quot;Stateline&quot;, and was prohibited by law from carrying programmes from a number of genres; however, after the removal of these restrictions the channel&#x27;s content was broadened considerably. It was announced by the ABC that, from 4 December 2017, ABC2 was to be replaced by ABC Comedy, ending the channel&#x27;s 12-year run.

ABC Entertains, a third digital-only kids channel began on 4 December 2009.

ABC News, a digital news channel began on 22 July 2010.

ABC Kids, a digital shared channel began on 2 May 2011.

===Special Broadcasting Service===

SBS Television is a division of the Special Broadcasting Service, founded to provide for the estimated 20% of Australians that speak a language other than English in the home, aiming to complement the ABC.

In recent years SBS TV has begun to target a broader cross-section of the Australian community, in part because of the emergence of specialty subscription television channels aimed at such minorities. In addition to its free-to-air channels, SBS also has an interest in the World Movies Channel which has since been revived on free-to-air TV as SBS World Movies and it relaunched on the 1st of July 2019.

SBS shows many non-English language films with English subtitles, and each morning shows news bulletins in foreign languages from around the world in its &quot;WorldWatch&quot; timeslot. In addition to this, a great deal of programming from the PBS, Arte, BBC and CBC, and even Comedy Central are shown.

Acquired entertainment programs include the US animated series &quot;South Park&quot;, &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; and &quot;Inspector Rex&quot;. In addition to news and current affairs programming such as SBS World News and &quot;Dateline&quot;, the network also commissions locally produced documentaries, movies and comedy programs. Less-popular mainstream sports such as soccer, cycling and athletics are also shown.

SBS currently broadcasts six channels: SBS, known as &#x27;SBS One&#x27; between 2009 and 2015, SBS Viceland, known as SBS Two between 2009 and 2016, SBS World Movies, SBS Food, known as Food Network Australia between 2015 and 2018, NITV, also known as National indigenous Television (see #National Indigenous Television and more info about this channel in that section), and SBS WorldWatch launched on the 23rd of May of 2022.

===National Indigenous Television===
National Indigenous Television, funded by the Commonwealth of Australia, is produced in Sydney and broadcast via Imparja Television&#x27;s existing satellite capacity.

The idea for a national, indigenous television service was initially conceived by the National Indigenous Radio Service (the peak Indigenous radio group), which initially lobbied the government to start a new, nationwide indigenous television network. Although no major political party championed this cause, commercial broadcaster Imparja Television stated in 2004 that it would run such a network, at least within its own licence area. In 2005 the federal Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts considered funding such a station, and conducted a review process.

On 13 July 2007 NITV launched, replacing Indigenous Community Television on the Optus Aurora remote satellite service.

On 12 December 2012 NITV was launched on free to air on which was the 4th digital channel of SBS, making this channel available to all Australians wherever SBS digital television is broadcast.

==Commercial television==
In order to allow for commercial licensing, the country was divided into a number of licence areas. When these were drawn up in the 1950s, each major city or regional area – about 50 in all – was considered its own market region. In each of the five major capitals, three commercial licences were granted (the exception being Perth which did not receive its third commercial station until 1988), while smaller cities or regions were granted a single licence.

The process of &quot;aggregation&quot; began in 1989. Regional markets were merged and (usually) three licences were granted in the new, aggregated, area, with the exception of Tasmania and Remote &amp; Central Australia, which got two licences. As some markets were formed by the merger of up to six different individual markets, this meant that some stations had to merge or form partnerships in order to remain competitive. Around the same time, many remote market regions were replaced with two satellite market regions – one for regional Western Australia, and one for remote central and eastern Australia – although each of these regions was only granted two licences.

Some remained un-aggregated, and are today known as diary markets. These were granted a second licence, sometimes to the same company that owned the existing licence. Two-broadcaster areas were later granted a third licence, to a joint venture company formed as a partnership of the two existing broadcasters. Examples of these include Tasmanian Digital Television, Mildura Digital Television, Darwin Digital Television and West Digital Television service.
Areas with one broadcaster were also granted a third licence to the same company that owned the other two licences.

===Metropolitan===
There are three main metropolitan networks, the Seven Network, Nine Network and Network 10. Although primarily targeted at metropolitan areas, these names are also used in some regional areas (others choose to run the same programming as these stations, but use independent names).

Seven Network
* Headquarters: Eveleigh, Sydney
*National play-out centre: Frenchs Forest, Sydney
* Main Studio
** Breakfast/Morning Show/News (National Bulletins): Eveleigh, Sydney

Nine Network
* Headquarters: North Sydney
*National play-out centre: Frenchs Forest, Sydney
* Main Studio
** Breakfast/Morning Show/News (National Bulletins): North Sydney

Network 10
* Headquarters &amp; National play-out centre: Pyrmont, Sydney
* Main Studio
** Morning Show/News (National Bulletins): Pyrmont, Sydney

Although the names of the metropolitan stations remain the same across cities, their ownership varies (see below).

===Regional and remote===
The population of Australians living outside of metropolitan areas are served by a number of regional television networks that are affiliated with a metropolitan counterpart. Before the 1980s, regional stations were mostly independent with some forming loose partnerships and others merging into local networks. However, the Hawke Labor government introduced a system known as aggregation – regional television equalisation – which would provide viewers with the same viewing choices as those in the metropolitan cities. Consequently, the regional stations and networks continued to merge and expand, and became affiliated with one of the three metropolitan networks. Further equalisation later occurred in the 2000s – with the advent of digital television – to areas that escaped initial aggregation.

Today, WIN Television, Imparja Television and Southern Cross Austereo notably remain independent, whereas broadcasters like Prime Television, the Golden West Network, Sunshine Television and NBN Television have been absorbed by the metropolitan networks over the years.

As with some of the metropolitan stations, local content is present only in the form of local news bulletin or local advertising. The amount of local news provided varies from two-minute updates to full-hour, seven nights a week news bulletins.

===Current ownership===
Commercial stations in metropolitan markets (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth), in addition to some regional markets, are owned and operated by their respective network. In other regional and remote areas, the stations are owned by an affiliate broadcaster.

Some regional markets have one operator holding a monopoly over all three networks, with one &quot;digital only&quot; supplementary station of the three operating under a supplementary licence.

Other regional markets have only two operators, each affiliated with their own networks. Consequently, these two operators have formed a supplementary &quot;digital only&quot; joint venture to broadcast the remaining third network.

====Notes====
==Community broadcasting==
In 1993 the Australian Broadcasting Authority allocated licences for a sixth television channel for non-profit community and educational use on a trial basis. The groundwork for community television was laid in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, which defined a new service category, community television, for the first time.

Prospective community television providers were invited to apply for transmitter licences, which were
granted to groups in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Lismore. In February, 1995, the West Australian Community Broadcasting Association was appointed to manage access to the sixth channel in Perth and Mandurah on behalf of groups based in the two cities.

Licences were also granted in 1996 to Hobart Access Community Television Inc in Hobart and Bendigo Community Television Inc in Bendigo however these were not renewed. Similarly, a licence for BushVision in Mount Gambier was granted in 2005, but it later lapsed. Permanent licences for Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth were allocated in 2004, while trial licences remain in effect in Adelaide and Lismore.

The Australian Community Television Alliance, established in March 2008 is the national representative organisation for community television. The CEO of TVS Sydney, Laurie Patton, is the Secretary and represents ACTA on the Federal Government&#x27;s Digital Switchover Taskforce Industry Advisory Group. In addition to these, a number of community groups produce programming in regional areas, including Queanbeyan Canberra Television (QCTV) in Canberra, Hunter Community Television in Newcastle, Illawarra Community Television (ICTV) in Wollongong and WARP Television in Bathurst.

Groups in a number of areas including Ballarat and Victor Harbor have unsuccessfully applied for licences. Aurora Community Television, Australian Multicultural Television, Ballarat Community Cable Television, Channel Vision (Canberra) and Satellite Community TV, although not licensed as community stations, provide similar services.

Community Television stations went digital in 2010. However, in September 2014 Australian federal communications minister Malcolm Turnbull announced that licensing for community television stations would end in December 2015. In September 2015, Turnbull, now Prime Minister, announced an extension of the deadline to 31 December 2016. The deadline was further extended incrementally by communications minister Mitch Fifield until June 2021, however by 2015 Sydney&#x27;s Television Sydney had ceased broadcasting, as had Brisbane&#x27;s 31 Digital, switching to a short-live online streaming service. As of January 2021, the only remaining community television stations in Australia still broadcasting are Melbourne&#x27;s C31 and Adelaide&#x27;s Channel 44.

==Subscription television==

Two of the three major providers of subscription television in Australia carry a common service; however they have a number of differences. Foxtel currently &#x27;controls&#x27; the common service that Optus resell. This service is known as the Foxtel Platform.

Austar broadcast into all of regional Australia (except Western Australia), Tasmania and Darwin while Foxtel broadcast in all capital cities, the Gold Coast, the Central Coast and all of Western Australia until mid-2012 when Foxtel/Austar merged hence Foxtel gaining the Austar coverage areas. Optus Television operates only in the small parts of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide where it has laid cable.

SelecTV was the fourth provider of subscription television controlled by WIN Corporation. SelecTV was available throughout Australia via satellite and focused on providing content in comparatively low priced packages to a number of specialised market segments; including Spanish, Greek, and Italian. As of January 2011, the service is no longer available.

There are two small region-based subscription television providers; TransTV Digital which is available in Canberra; and Neighbourhood Cable based in Ballarat, and also available in Geelong &amp; Mildura.

There are also a number of satellite services that target specific language speaking groups, the largest being UBI World TV, a non-English language service. Globecast TV and Pan Global TV are non-English language, Christian and sport channel platforms that are controlled by Globecast. Various operators run their own subscription services on these platforms. In addition, there are other satellite subscription services available through other providers.

National IPTV operators include TPG IPTV.
==Datacasting==
Datacasting in Australia began as a test transmission in Sydney using one of the reserved digital spectrum positions. Australian broadcast infrastructure company Broadcast Australia undertook the three-year trial using the DVB-T system. The trial consisted of a number of services on one standard 7 MHz multiplex, collectively known as &quot;Digital Forty Four&quot;. The service was extended past the three-year period, but ended in March 2010

The services included; a combined program guide for the free-to-air broadcasters, named Channel 4; a news, sport, and weather datacast channel provided by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation; a government and public information channel, known as Channel NSW, which included real time traffic information and surf webcams; the Australian Christian Channel; the Expo Channel; and various federal parliamentary audio broadcasts.

Today, datacasting consists of information based channels that are broadcast as subchannels of the existing commercial broadcasters. As of mid 2013, these broadcast mainly infomercials. Examples include TVSN and 4ME.

==Narrowcasting==
There are currently five open-narrowcast services in Australia:

* Aboriginal TV &amp; TVNT – Darwin – link
* Goolarri Television (GTV) – Broome – link
* Indigenous Community Television (ICTV) – Alice Springs
* Ngarda Community Television and Radio – Roebourne, Western Australia
* Snowy Mountains Television (SMTV) – Jindabyne, New South Wales

One of the narrowcast services, Indigenous Community Television (ICTV), is available to satellite users across Australia via the VAST service. 

Aboriginal Television, GTV and Ngarda TV are local Indigenous-owned services that broadcast only to their home market. SMTV is also restricted to its home market of Jindabyne.

==Amateur broadcasting==
The Australian amateur radio bands include frequencies standard televisions can receive, which have led to amateur radio operators making use of this by broadcasting video.

The frequency overlap occurs roughly where television channel 16 lies. Typically, channel 16 is used for amateur television transmissions; however, other frequencies are sometimes utilized, especially those used by satellite television services. Most transmissions can be viewed and heard on an analogue television, but some transmissions require additional or other equipment.

===New South Wales===
Television Gladesville (VK2TVG) in Sydney conducts three test transmissions per week on Channel 16, including a three-hour live to air program on Wednesday nights.

The Central Coast Amateur Radio Club also has an amateur television repeater (VK2RTG) on Channel 16.

VK2RTS broadcasts from Lawson near Katoomba on Channel 16. Club activity is on Mondays between 8 and 10p.m.
A Voice liaison and control frequency of 147.325 MHz (+600 kHz duplex) is used.

VK2RFM broadcasts from Oakdale near Camden on 1250 MHz FM which can be viewed with an analog satellite receiver.
Club activity is Tuesdays between 8 and 10p.m. The liaison and control frequency is 147.400 MHz simplex.

Both repeaters cover the entire Sydney basin. They are operated by the Sydney Amateur Television Group and may be activated and used at any time from the control channels.
UHF TV Channel 35 was used until July 2001 when the Australian Communications and Media Authority reassigned the channel for digital television.

===Victoria (2 Digital ATV Channels) ===
VK3RTV is Melbourne&#x27;s main amateur television station, and is available via Channel 16 at the lower end of the UHF TV Band (below channel 28). The amateur television repeater is located on Mount Dandenong.

There are a small number of amateur television enthusiasts (amateur radio operators with Television transmitting equipment) who transmit to Melbourne and surrounds via VK3RTV.

These include VK3AAZ, VK3AOB, VK3AGJ, VK3BFG, VK3BCU, VK3CH, VK3CRG, VK3FMD, VK3GMZ, VK3IV, VK3JDA, VK3JDG, VK3KBL, VK3KHB, VK3KOS, VK3LA, VK3MN, VK3PB, VK3TMS, VK3TVZ, VK3XOK, VK3XKD and VK3XZA.

VK3RTV is now a 2-channel digital television facility on 446 MHz. The new system features two standard definition digital channels.

Bendigo in Central Victoria also has an Amateur Television Transmitter (VK3RBO) on the 13 cm band. This can be received using surplus microwave dishes and downconverters. The station is known to show episodes of the Amateur Television Program &#x27;Amateurlogic&#x27;.

===Queensland===

Amateur television in Queensland had its beginnings in the late 1970s, after a group of local Ham radio enthusiasts showed interests in setting up their own television repeater, although this would not occur until the 1980s. For several years, broadcasters had to rely on a low-powered repeater located in Brisbane&#x27;s northern suburbs, but eventually permissions were granted to have a more advanced and more central repeater constructed within the inner-city suburb of Spring Hill.

In 1990, Brisbane&#x27;s Amateur Television club provided a two-way television system for Lamington National Park during the park&#x27;s 75th anniversary celebrations. In October that year, amateur television history was made when broadcasters VK4BOB and VK4XRL transmitted video to Sydney&#x27;s ATV clubs which was relayed by the AUSSAT satellite.

Various transmitters continue to broadcast to this day. Some Queensland ATV transmitters are located in the outer-Brisbane suburbs of Ocean View and Wamuran. In November 2012, the Ocean View site will begin its first digital transmission test.

In 2014, the Spring Hill repeater was demolished.

<doc id="177425" wikidata="Q3565810" url="?curid=177425" title="Walter Lantz Productions">
<text>Walter Lantz Productions was an American animation studio. It was in operation from 1928 to 1949 and then from 1950 to 1972, and was the principal supplier of animation for Universal Pictures.

The studio was originally formed as Universal Cartoon Studios on the initiative of Universal movie mogul Carl Laemmle, who was tired of the continuous company politics he was dealing with concerning contracting cartoons outside animation studios. Walter Lantz, who was Laemmle&#x27;s part-time chauffeur and a veteran of the John R. Bray Studios with considerable experience in all elements of animation production, was selected to run the department.

In 1935, the studio was severed from Universal and became Walter Lantz Studio under Lantz&#x27;s direct control, and, in 1939, renamed to Walter Lantz Productions. Lantz managed to gain the copyright for his characters. The cartoons continued to be distributed by Universal through 1947, changing to United Artists distribution from 1947 until its first closure in 1949, and by Universal again from 1950 until its second and official closure in 1972.

The most prominent characters for the studio were Woody Woodpecker, Andy Panda, Chilly Willy, and Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. Additionally, the music-oriented &quot;Swing Symphony&quot; cartoons were another successful staple, but ended after swing music&#x27;s popularity faded after the end of World War II.

== History ==
=== 1928–1935: Early years as Universal Cartoon Studios ===
Lantz began his career at the art department of William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s &quot;New York American&quot; during the 1910s, having his start in the cartoon industry at Hearst&#x27;s International Film Service, which in 1918 transferred its entire staff to Bray Productions. By the mid-1920s, Lantz was directing (and acting in) the studio&#x27;s top cartoon, &quot;Dinky Doodle&quot;, also becoming a producer as Bray attempted to compete with Hal Roach and Mack Sennett by making live-action comedies. Bray Productions closed shop in 1928, and Lantz moved to Hollywood, trying to start a studio while trying to make a living in a succession of odd jobs, including driving Universal owner Carl Laemmle&#x27;s limousine. The chauffeur job also landed Lantz at the Winkler Studio, which produced cartoons for Universal.

In early 1929, Universal was distributing the &quot;Oswald the Lucky Rabbit&quot; cartoons by Charles Mintz and George Winkler (but created by Walt Disney). However, the popularity of the series was beginning to decline because of the lower quality of the output. Laemmle then fired Mintz and Winkler and was now looking for someone to head an in-house animation studio. Lantz won the studio in a poker bet with Laemmle. The first Lantz-produced &quot;Oswald&quot; cartoon was &quot;Race Riot&quot;, released on September 2, 1929. The first animators for the studio included Winkler veterans Rollin Hamilton, Tom Palmer and &quot;rubber-hose&quot; pioneer Bill Nolan. Bert Fiske scored the first cartoons, having done this for the few Winkler sound &quot;Oswalds&quot;. Additions to the staff included Pinto Colvig and Tex Avery.

The earliest Lantz cartoons from 1928 were built around set plots and stories, in the tradition of the earlier Disney and Winkler Productions shorts. The conversion of &quot;Oswald&quot; cartoons into musicals was a different matter, but by mid-1930, Lantz and his staff achieved this goal. In the process however, Oswald&#x27;s personality became less consistent. It could and did change drastically to fit a particular gag. Lantz&#x27;s musical directors changed as well. To replace David Broekman, Lantz brought in James Dietrich, a member of the Paul Whiteman Orchestra, making the jazz-era sound of the 1920s a quintessential element in the early Lantz cartoons. He remained as the permanent studio musical director until 1937. Lantz and Nolan worked in a character called &quot;Fanny the Mule&quot; for a 13-cartoon series announced by Laemmle in early 1930; these cartoons were never produced.

In 1931, Lantz faced economic difficulties and was forced to make cutbacks, shortening the lengths of his films and post-synchronizing a handful of the early Disney Oswald&#x27;s cartoons. Another way out of the hole was to gain attention by creating a secondary series of shorts featuring a new star, Pooch the Pup. Lantz and Nolan divided the studio into two separate units. Lantz directed the Pooch cartoons, while Nolan worked on the Oswalds, with both series referencing the dire straits of the Depression. Pooch never became very popular and the series was dropped in 1933. The following year, Nolan left the studio, and the &quot;Cartune Classics&quot; series of Technicolor shorts began, lasting for a year.

=== 1935–1940: The decline of Oswald and new stars ===
Control of Universal by founder Carl Laemmle and his family was slipping away because of financial difficulties and came to an end in 1936. John Cheever Cowdin became Universal&#x27;s new president. With the change in management, Lantz seized the opportunity to ask Universal for permission to make his studio independent. Universal agreed, and on November 16, 1935, Lantz broke off and claimed the studio for his own, even though it remained on the Universal lot.

During the mid-to-late 1930s, Oswald&#x27;s popularity declined, and Lantz experimented with other characters to replace him. After a succession of failed attempts, the 1939 cartoon &quot;Life Begins for Andy Panda&quot; became an instant hit, and Andy Panda became a successful substitute for Oswald, who was retired in 1938. Lantz also switched to all-color production in 1939, shortly before Andy&#x27;s debut.

In 1940, the Walter Lantz studio was in trouble. Universal once again was facing severe financial difficulties and possible bankruptcy and decided to cut their weekly advance to the now-independent Lantz studio. This left Lantz scrambling for alternative sources for funds, forcing him to shut down the studio for a while. Lantz was able to gain the rights to the characters of his films (including Oswald the Lucky Rabbit) and an Andy Panda cartoon, &quot;Crazy House&quot;, was developed into Lantz&#x27;s first independently financed film. Lantz used the film as a final appeal to the heads of Universal and, in the end, was able to reach a satisfactory settlement with them. By autumn 1940, Lantz&#x27;s studio was back in business again. The year also marked the debut of Lantz&#x27;s biggest star: Woody Woodpecker, who debuted in the Andy Panda cartoon &quot;Knock Knock&quot;.

=== 1940–1947: Continued success ===
Woody quickly became extremely popular, being given his own series in early 1941, and became one of the most famous examples of the &quot;brash bird&quot; cartoon characters of the late 1930s/early 1940s such as Donald Duck (also created by Disney). The success of &quot;Scrub Me Mama With A Boogie Beat&quot; and &quot;Boogie-Woogie Bugle Boy&quot; (the former becoming subject to controversy and even protest soon after its release over racial stereotypes and the latter earning an Academy Award) also led to the introduction of the &quot;Swing Symphony&quot; series that fall, often featuring popular musicians of the time. The series ended in 1945 at the twilight of the big band era. 

After the studio&#x27;s 1930s cartoons were scored by a succession of composers, including James Dietrich, Victor Records producer Nat Shilkret and Harman-Ising veterans Frank Marsales and Darrell Calker took over in late 1940. Calker&#x27;s arrangements became noted for their distinctive swing flavor.

After Disney&#x27;s success with &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937), the Lantz studio planned to make a feature, &quot;Aladdin and His Lamp&quot;, featuring the ascendant comedy duo of Abbott and Costello, but after &quot;Mr. Bug Goes to Town&quot; (1941) failed at the box-office, &quot;Aladdin&quot; never made it to actual production. Late in the decade, Lantz attempted to do a feature-length cartoon again, but it never came to fruition.

The Lantz unit was perhaps considered the smallest major animation studio at that time, as Lantz and animator Alex Lovy produced cartoons with a single unit. In 1943, Lovy was drafted into the Navy and was replaced by James &quot;Shamus&quot; Culhane. Culhane quickly developed a distinct direction and art style characterized for its use of Russian avant-garde influences, minimalistic backgrounds and fast cutting. Culhane eventually left Lantz in late-1945 over pay disputes.

=== 1947–1949: United Artists and first closure ===
In 1947, Lantz renegotiated his seven-year Universal contract with Matty Fox, the new vice-president of Universal. The deal was interrupted when new ownership transformed the company into Universal-International and did away with most of Universal&#x27;s company policies. The new management insisted on getting licensing and merchandising rights to Lantz&#x27;s characters. Lantz refused and withdrew from the parent company in 1947, vacated Universal City, moving into the former Screen Gems cartoon studio at 861 Seward Street in Hollywood and releasing 12 cartoons independently through United Artists during 1947 and early 1949.

The cartoons from this period stand out for their slicker animation compared to the previous Universal releases, mostly because of the influence of the studio&#x27;s latest director, Ex-Disney animator Dick Lundy, as well as the addition of Disney veterans, such as Ed Love and Fred Moore. This era also marked the end of the Andy Panda cartoons, whose popularity was waning.

Under the deal with United Artists, Lantz was supposed to receive percentages of box-office receipts to pay for the production costs of his cartoons. UA however attributed a tiny portion of the dollar amounts to Lantz&#x27;s shorts from the features. This was because UA was, at the time, a struggling studio attempting to re-establish the position in the industry it had in the 1920s. The result was that Lantz exceeded his standing loan of $250,000 from Bank of America (he had left Irving Trust in 1942). At the recommendation of BAC president Joe Rosenberg, Lantz decided to shut down his studio temporarily at the end of 1949 until the loan was reduced. He asked Universal to reissue his older films during the hiatus, a request accepted by Universal president Nate Blumberg.

In the interim, Lantz made a series of film ads for Coca-Cola and introduced &quot;The Woody Woodpecker Song&quot; as the theme song for the character. He also went to Europe to look for studios that could animate his films there, approaching government incentives not found stateside, and lower labor costs. However, the postwar economic situation of these countries as well as the presence of stronger unions than in Hollywood led him to back out and keep making films in America.

=== 1950–1967: Reopening and venture to television ===
In 1950, the Walter Lantz studio opened its doors once again. The first effort the studio produced was a brief sequence featuring Woody Woodpecker for the George Pal feature &quot;Destination Moon&quot;, released on June 27 the same year. Lantz then renegotiated with Universal-International for seven cartoons to be released the following year, provided that they all feature Woody Woodpecker. Lantz and his crew immediately set to work on the new batch of shorts. Two of these new films — &quot;Puny Express&quot; and &quot;Sleep Happy&quot; — were previously storyboarded by Ben Hardaway and Heck Allen during the United Artists period. In 1951, the new cartoons were finally released and became instant hits with audiences. They were so successful that U-I commissioned six more shorts for the following year. Overall, 1951 marked the beginning of a new era for the Walter Lantz studio. Lantz served as the director, writer and producer for these new shorts until the roles were given to animator Don Patterson, and writer Homer Brightman. Patterson&#x27;s shorts were often praised for showing a level of ambition despite the meager budgets.

The 50s brought changes to other studios that helped benefit Lantz&#x27; own output. In 1953, MGM closed Tex Avery&#x27;s unit while Warner Bros. briefly closed there entire animation facility over the immense popularity of 3-D films. Lantz was able to hire some of the displaced staff to the point he was able to open a second unit, with animator Paul J. Smith placed as director. Some of the men he was able to hire include writer Michael Maltese, animators Herman Cohen, Gil Turner and Robert Bentley, and Avery himself, who replaced Patterson from his role of director. Smith created the studio&#x27;s second most popular star, Chilly Willy, in 1953, and the character was refined by Avery the following year. Former MGM animators Ray Patterson and Grant Simmons also directed two shorts before they left to form Grantray-Lawrence Animation in 1954.

During the mid-50s, the film industry was suffering and losing money, meaning lower budgets for cartoons. Avery left Lantz in 1955 over pay disputes, and was succeeded by a returning Alex Lovy. By 1956, there were only seven animation producers in the short-subjects business, and by the end of the decade that number dwindled to three. Walter Lantz and his distributor, Universal-International Pictures, knew that the only way to subsidize the rising costs of new shorts was to release their product to television. Norman Gluck, from U-I&#x27;s short-subjects department, made a deal with the Leo Burnett Agency to release some older Lantz product on television. Burnett handled the Kellogg&#x27;s cereal account and Lantz soon met with the Kellogg&#x27;s people to sign the contract. At first, Lantz was not very eager and admitted that he was only working in the medium because he was &quot;forced into TV&quot; and &quot;cartoons for theaters would soon be extinct&quot;.

&quot;The Woody Woodpecker Show&quot; debuted on ABC on the afternoon of October 3, 1957, and lasted until September 1958. The series was seen once a week, on Thursday afternoons, replacing the first half hour of the shortened &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot;. Lantz integrated his existing cartoons with new live-action footage, giving the show an updated look that satisfied both viewers and Lantz himself. The live-action and animation segments created for the show, called &#x27;A Moment with Walter Lantz&#x27;, featured an informative look at how the animation process for his &quot;cartunes&quot; worked and how the writers came up with stories and characters. The live-action segments were directed by Jack Hannah, who was fresh from the Disney Studio, where he had done similar live-action/animation sequences for the Disney show. 

Hannah eventually directed theatrical shorts in 1960 after Lovy left for Hanna-Barbera. His shorts were regarded for having a level of sophistication comparable to Dick Lundy, and created characters such as &quot;Fatso the Bear&quot; and &quot;The Beary Family&quot; before he left too in 1962. His role was assumed by writer Sid Marcus. In 1964, with new Universal owner MCA Inc. dropping the International name, the cartoons were introduced with the new Universal presents open. Lantz eventually reduced the number of units back to one, leaving Smith as the sole director of all theatrical shorts by 1966.

=== 1967–1972: Official final years ===
By 1969, other film studios had discontinued their animation departments, leaving Walter Lantz as one of the only two producers still making cartoons for theaters. The other one was the start-up DePatie–Freleng Enterprises, working for Lantz&#x27; former contractor, United Artists. 

From 1967 until the studio&#x27;s second and official closure in 1972, Universal distributed the Lantz cartoons as packages, and theaters would play them in no particular order. Lantz finally closed up the studio in 1972; he later explained that by then, it was economically impossible to continue producing them and stay in business, as rising inflation had strained his profits, and Universal serviced the remaining demand with reissues of his older cartoons. &quot;Bye Bye Blackboard&quot;, a Woody Woodpecker cartoon, was part of the final slate of cartoons made at the Walter Lantz studio. Thirteen were completed for the 1972 season: one with Chilly Willy, four starring the Beary Family, and the rest with Lantz&#x27; star character, Woody Woodpecker. Upon discovering that it would take a decade for his shorts to show a profit, Lantz himself decided to shut down company operations, and threw a farewell luncheon with his staff at the announcement on March 10 the same year, with him handing Woody watches to them.

=== 1972–1985: Aftermath ===
In 1985, Lantz sold everything outright to MCA Inc. He painted landscapes in retirement and still lifes of his cartoon characters. Since then, Universal has continued to used Woody and also used Woody in the Theme Parks or merchandising. Universal has since produced new projects, including television series and movies.

== Legacy ==
Unlike other American major animation studios, the Lantz studio never continued full-time during the classic period of American animation, closing down in 1949 and reopening its doors the following year. It was finally shut down permanently in 1972, after the end of the Golden Age of American animation. Since then, the studio&#x27;s characters have continued to be used in syndicated television series, and in licensed merchandise. Lantz re-issued six of the 1931–32 Disney &quot;Oswald&quot; cartoons, including &quot;Trolley Troubles&quot;, &quot;Great Guns!&quot; and &quot;The Ocean Hop&quot;.

Throughout the studio&#x27;s history, it maintained a reputation as an animation house of medium quality. Lantz&#x27;s animated shorts (dubbed &quot;Cartunes&quot;) were considered superior to Terrytoons, Screen Gems and Famous Studios, but they never gained the artistic acclaim of Walt Disney Productions, Warner Bros. Cartoons, MGM Cartoons, Fleischer Studios or UPA. However, the studio benefited from gaining talent from the other studios who were tired of the management there and usually found the Lantz studio a more enjoyable working environment. Tex Avery was just one of the many talents Walter Lantz Productions benefited from on the rebound.

In February 2006, NBCUniversal (who still owns the Lantz library) sold the trademark rights to Oswald the Lucky Rabbit along with the copyright to the original 26 cartoons produced by Walt Disney to The Walt Disney Company. The sale was part of a deal that centered around both the rights to Oswald and NBC&#x27;s acquisition of the rights to the NFL&#x27;s weekly Sunday night game; in exchange for NBCUniversal selling the rights to Oswald to Disney, Al Michaels was freed from his contractual obligations with ESPN and ABC so he could join NBC and become the &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; play-by-play man.

In July 2007, Universal Pictures released &quot;The Woody Woodpecker and Friends Classic Cartoon Collection&quot;, a three-disc DVD box-set compilation of Lantz Cartunes. A second volume was released in April 2008, followed by a vanilla release in 2009, &quot;Woody Woodpecker Favorites&quot;, which contained no new-to-DVD material. Animation historian Jerry Beck, partly involved in the production of the DVD releases, has stated that plans for further volumes are currently on hold.

In 2008, Illumination, an animation production company founded by Chris Meledandri, made a deal with Universal Pictures which positioned Illumination as NBCUniversal&#x27;s family entertainment arm that would produce one to two films per year starting in 2010. Like Walter Lantz Productions, Illumination retains creative control, and Universal exclusively distributes the films.

Free-to-air linear channel MeTV officially brought back the Walter Lantz cartoons output on American television starting from 2 September 2023, airing every Saturday as part of the &quot;Saturday Morning Cartoons&quot; 3-hour block (one hour of which, dedicated to Lantz, being &quot;The Woody Woodpecker Show&quot;) plus on weekdays as part of &quot;Toon In with Me&quot;. The Lantz cartoons are also shown daily on the MeTV Toons channel.

<text>A wife (: wives) is a woman in a marital relationship. A woman who has separated from her partner continues to be a wife until their marriage is legally dissolved with a divorce judgment; or until death, depending on the kind of marriage. On the death of her partner, a wife is referred to as a widow. The rights and obligations of a wife to her partner and her status in the community and law vary between cultures and have varied over time.

==Etymology==

The word is of Germanic origin from the Proto-Germanic word &quot;wībam&quot;, which translates into &quot;woman&quot;. In Middle English, it had the form &quot;wif&quot;, and in Old English &quot;wīf&quot;, &quot;woman or wife&quot;. It is related to Modern German &quot;Weib&quot; (woman, female), Danish &quot;viv&quot; (wife, usually poetic), and Dutch &quot;wijf&quot; (woman, generally pejorative, cf. &quot;bitch&quot;). The original meaning of the phrase &quot;wife&quot; as simply &quot;woman&quot;, unconnected with marriage or a husband/wife, is preserved in words such as &quot;midwife&quot;, &quot;goodwife&quot;, &quot;fishwife&quot; and &quot;spaewife&quot;.

==Changes after marriages==
After marriage, it is generally expected in many cultures that a woman will take her husband&#x27;s surname, though this is not universal. A married woman may indicate her marital status in a number of ways: in Western culture, a married woman would commonly wear a wedding ring, but in other cultures, other markers of marital status may be used. A married woman is commonly given the title &quot;Mrs&quot;, but some married women prefer to be referred to as &quot;Ms&quot;, a title which is also used by preference or when the marital status of a woman is unknown.

==Related terminology==

A woman on her wedding day is usually described as a bride&quot;.&quot; Occasionally, this naming is considered appropriate after the wedding ceremony or the honeymoon, though she is typically called a wife within the marriage. If she is marrying a man, her partner is known as the bridegroom during the wedding and within the marriage is called her &quot;husband&quot;. If she is marrying a woman, each partner is referred to as a wife.

In the older customs, which are still followed by the Roman Catholic ritual, the word &quot;bride&quot; actually means fiancée, and applies up to the exchange of matrimonial consent (the actual marriage act). From that point, even while the rest of the very ceremony is ongoing, the woman is a wife and no longer considered as a bride. Hence, the bridal couple is no longer referred to as such, but instead as the newlywed couple or &quot;newlyweds&quot;.

Unlike mother, a term that puts a woman into the context of her children, &quot;Wife&quot; refers to the institutionalized relation to the other spouse. In some societies, especially historically, a &quot;concubine&quot; was a woman who was in an ongoing, usually matrimonially oriented relationship with a man who could not be married to her, often due to a difference in social status.

The term &quot;wife&quot; is most commonly applied to a woman in a union sanctioned by law (including religious law), but not to a woman in an informal cohabitation relationship, which may be known as a girlfriend, partner, cohabitant, significant other, concubine, mistress, etc. However, a woman in a so-called common law marriage may describe herself as a common law wife, de facto wife, or simply a wife. Those seeking to advance gender neutrality may refer to both marriage partners as &quot;spouses&quot;. In response to this naming change, many countries and societies are rewording their statute law by replacing &quot;wife&quot; and &quot;husband&quot; with &quot;spouse&quot;. A former wife whose spouse is deceased is a widow&quot;.&quot;

==Termination of the status of a wife==
The status of a wife may be terminated by divorce, annulment, or the death of a spouse. In the case of divorce, terminology such as a former wife, &quot;former-wife&quot; or &quot;ex-wife&quot; is often used. In regard to annulment, such terms are not strictly accurate. This is because annulment, unlike divorce, is usually retroactive, meaning that an annulled marriage is considered to be invalid from the beginning as though it had never taken place. In the case of the death of the other spouse, the term used is widow. The social status of such women varies by culture. In some places, they may be subject to potentially harmful practices, such as widow inheritance or levirate marriage, or social stigmatization. In some cultures, the termination of the status of wife makes life itself meaningless. In the case of those cultures that practice sati, a funeral ritual within some Asian communities, a recently widowed woman intentionally commits suicide by fire, typically upon the husband&#x27;s funeral pyre.

==Legal rights of the wife==

The legal rights of a wife have been subject to debate since the 19th century in many jurisdictions. The subject was in particular addressed by John Stuart Mill in &quot;The Subjection of Women&quot; (1869). Historically, many societies have given sets of rights and obligations to husbands that differ vastly from the sets of rights and obligations given to wives. In particular, the control of marital property, inheritance rights, and the right to dictate the activities of children of the marriage, have typically been given to male marital partners. However, this practice was curtailed to a great deal in many countries in the twentieth century, and more modern statutes tend to define the rights and duties of a spouse without reference to gender. Among the last European countries to establish full gender equality in marriage were Switzerland, Greece, Spain, and France in the 1980s. In various marriage laws around the world, however, the husband continues to have authority. For instance, the Civil Code of Iran states in Article 1105: &quot;In relations between husband and wife; the position of the head of the family is the exclusive right of the husband&quot;.

==Exchanges of goods or money==
In some parts of the world, traditional payments or exchanges are typically made, including:

* the bride or her family bring her husband a &quot;dowry&quot;, 
* the husband or his family pay a &quot;bride price&quot; to the bride&#x27;s family, 
* both payments are exchanged between the families,
* or the husband pays the wife a &quot;dower&quot;.

The purpose of the dowry varies by culture and has varied historically. In some cultures, it was paid not only to support the establishment of a new family, but also served as a condition that if the husband committed grave offenses upon his wife, the dowry had to be returned to the wife or her family. Due to this condition, the dowry was often made inalienable by the husband during the marriage. Today, dowries continue to be expected in parts of South Asia such as India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, and conflicts related to their payment sometimes result in violence, such as dowry deaths and bride burning.

==Changing of name upon marriage==

In some cultures, particularly in the Anglophone West, wives often change their surnames to that of the husband upon getting married. For some, this is a controversial practice, due to its tie to the historical doctrine of coverture and to the historically subordinated roles of wives. Others argue that today this is merely a harmless tradition that should be accepted as a free choice. Some jurisdictions consider this practice as discriminatory and contrary to women&#x27;s rights, and have restricted or banned it; for example, since 1983, when Greece adopted a new marriage law which guaranteed gender equality between the spouses, women in Greece are required to &quot;keep&quot; their birth names for their whole life.

==Childbearing==

Traditionally, and still in many cultures, the role of a wife was closely tied to that of a mother, by a strong expectation that a wife ought to bear children, while conversely, an unmarried woman should not have a child out of wedlock. These views have changed in many parts of the world. Children born outside marriage have become more common in many countries.

Although some wives in particular in Western countries choose not to have children, such a choice is not accepted in some parts of the world. In northern Ghana, for example, the payment of bride price signifies a woman&#x27;s requirement to bear children, and women using birth control are at risk of threats and coercion. In addition, some religions are interpreted as requiring children in marriage; for instance, Pope Francis said in 2015 that choosing not to have children was selfish.

==Differences in cultures==
===Antiquity===

Many traditions like a dower, dowry and bride price have long traditions in antiquity. The exchange of any item or value goes back to the oldest sources, and the wedding ring likewise was always used as a symbol for keeping faith to a person.

===Western cultures===

====Historical status====

In ancient Rome, The Emperor Augustus introduced marriage legislation, the Lex Papia Poppaea, which rewarded marriage and childbearing. The legislation also imposed penalties on young persons who failed to marry and on those who committed adultery. Therefore, marriage and childbearing was made law between the ages of twenty-five and sixty for men, and twenty and fifty for women. Women who were Vestal Virgins, were selected between the ages of 6 and 10 to serve as priestesses in the temple of goddess Vesta in the Roman Forum for 30 years after which time they could marry. Noble women were known to marry as young as 12 years of age, whereas women in the lower classes were more likely to marry slightly further into their teenage years. Ancient Roman law required brides to be at least 12 years old, a standard adopted by Roman Catholic canon law. In ancient Roman law, first marriages to brides aged 12–25 required the consent of the bride and her father, but by the late antique period Roman law permitted women over 25 to marry without parental consent. The father had the right and duty to seek a good and useful match for his children, and might arrange a child&#x27;s betrothal long before he or she came of age. To further the interests of their birth families, daughters of the elite would marry into respectable families. If a daughter could prove the proposed husband to be of bad character, she could legitimately refuse the match. The age of lawful consent to a marriage was 12 for maidens and 14 for youths. In late antiquity, Most Roman women seem to have married in their late teens to early twenties, but noble women married younger than those of the lower classes, and an aristocratic maiden was expected to be virgin until her first marriage. In late antiquity, under Roman law, daughters inherited equally from their parents if no will was produced. In addition, Roman law recognized wives&#x27; property as legally separate from husbands&#x27;s property, as did some legal systems in parts of Europe and colonial Latin America.

Christian cultures claim to be guided by the New Testament in regard to their view on the position of a wife in society as well as her marriage. The New Testament condemns divorce for both men and women (1 Cor 7:10–11) and assumes monogamy on the part of the husband: the wife is to have her &quot;own&quot; husband, and the husband is to have his &quot;own&quot; wife (1 Cor 7:2). In the medieval period, this was understood to mean that a wife should not share a husband with other wives. As a result, divorce was relatively uncommon in the pre-modern West, particularly in the medieval and early modern period, and husbands in the Roman, later medieval and early modern period did not publicly take more than one wife.

In pre-modern times, it was unusual to marry for love alone, although it became an ideal in literature by the early modern period. In the 12th century, the Roman Catholic Church drastically changed legal standards for marital consent by allowing daughters over 12 and sons over 14 to marry without their parents&#x27; approval, even if their marriage was made clandestinely. Parish studies have confirmed that late medieval women did sometimes marry against their parents&#x27; approval. The Roman Catholic Church&#x27;s policy of considering clandestine marriages and marriages made without parental consent to be valid was controversial, and in the 16th century both the French monarchy and the Lutheran church sought to end these practices, with limited success.

The New Testament made no pronouncements about wives&#x27; property rights, which in practice were influenced more by secular laws than religion. Most influential in the pre-modern West was the civil law, except in English-speaking countries where English common law emerged in the High Middle Ages. In addition, local customary law influenced wives&#x27; property rights; as a result, wives&#x27; property rights in the pre-modern West varied widely from region to region. Because wives&#x27; property rights and daughters&#x27; inheritance rights varied widely from region to region due to differing legal systems, the amount of property a wife might own varied greatly. Under the English common law system, which dates to the later medieval period, daughters and younger sons were usually excluded from landed property if no will was produced. Under English common law, there was a system where a wife with a living husband (&quot;feme couvert&quot;) could own little property in her own name. Unable to easily support herself, marriage was very important to most women&#x27;s economic status. This problem has been dealt with extensively in literature, where the most important reason for women&#x27;s limited power was the denial of equal education and equal property rights for females. The situation was assessed by the English conservative moralist Sir William Blackstone: &quot;The husband and wife are one, and the husband is the one.&quot; Married women&#x27;s property rights in the English-speaking world improved with the Married Women&#x27;s Property Act 1882 and similar legal changes, which allowed wives with living husbands to own property in their own names. Until late in the 20th century, women could in some regions or times sue a man for wreath money when he took her virginity without taking her as his wife.

If a woman did not want to marry, another option was entering a convent as a nun. to become a &quot;bride of Christ&quot;, a state in which her chastity and economic survival would be protected. Both a wife and a nun wore Christian headcovering, which proclaimed their state of protection by the rights of marriage. Much more significant than the option of becoming a nun, was the option of non-religious spinsterhood in the West. An unmarried woman, a feme sole, had the right to own property and make contracts in her own name. As first demonstrated quantitatively by John Hajnal, in the 19th and early 20th centuries the percentage of non-clerical Western women who never married was typically as high as 10–15%, a prevalence of female celibacy never yet documented for any other major traditional civilization. In addition, early modern Western women married at quite high ages (typically mid to late 20s) relative to other major traditional cultures. The high age at first marriage for Western women has been shown by many parish reconstruction studies to be a traditional Western marriage pattern that dates back at least as early as the mid-16th century.

====Contemporary status====
In the 20th century, the role of the wife in Western marriage changed in two major ways; the first was the breakthrough from an &quot;institution to companionate marriage&quot;; for the first time since the Middle Ages, wives became distinct legal entities, and were allowed their own property and allowed to sue. Until then, partners were a single legal entity, but only a husband was allowed to exercise this right, called coverture. The second change was the drastic alteration of middle and upper-class family life, when in the 1960s these wives began to work outside their home, and with the social acceptance of divorces the single-parent family, and stepfamily or &quot;blended family&quot; as a more &quot;individualized marriage&quot;.

Today, some women may wear a wedding ring in order to show her status as a wife.

In Western countries today, married women usually have an education, a profession and they (or their husbands) can take time off from their work in a legally procured system of ante-natal care, statutory maternity leave, and they may get maternity pay or a maternity allowance. The status of marriage, as opposed to unmarried pregnant women, allows the spouse to be responsible for the child, and to speak on behalf of their wife; a partner is also responsible for the wife&#x27;s child in states where they are automatically assumed to be the biological legal parent. Vice versa, a wife has more legal authority in some cases when she speaks on behalf of a spouse than she would have if they were not married, e.g. when her spouse is in a coma after an accident, a wife may have the right of advocacy. If they divorce, she also might receive—or pay—alimony (see Law and divorce around the world).

==== Women&#x27;s income affects the dynamics of heterosexual love relationships ====

The effect of women&#x27;s income on heterosexual relationships’ dynamics depends on several factors. If the couple has strong traditional values, the income of women will affect men&#x27;s gender identity and affect their well-being. If they have strong liberal values, the income of a woman will make the woman the provider of the house and put the man in a more domestic role. However, in most cases a couple will develop a mutually dependent relationship where the woman&#x27;s income is needed, but at the same time the woman will do the majority of the housework.

At the beginning of the 1970s the traditional dynamic was that women performed domestic labor and that men worked for income due to the economic pressures in place. Eventually, second wave feminism challenged this dynamic. Starting in the 1980s, correlations between higher income of women and higher rates of divorce began decreasing. 

The economic independence theory establishes that if one side of the couple provides more than 60% of the total income of the couple, there is a dependence effect. Therefore, in recent decades women have had a major increase in their economic independence. At the same time, women have had to wrestle with other economic decisions, such as the postponement of motherhood.

===Asia cultures===

====Hinduism====

In Indo-Aryan languages, a wife is known as &quot;Patni&quot;, which means a woman who shares everything in this world with her husband and he does the same, including their identity. Decisions are ideally made in mutual consent. A wife usually takes care of anything inside her household, including the family&#x27;s health, the children&#x27;s education, a parent&#x27;s needs.

The majority of Hindu marriages in rural and traditional India are arranged marriages. Once they find a suitable family (family of same caste, culture and financial status), the boy and the girl see and talk to each other to decide the outcome. In recent times however the western culture has had significant influence and the new generations are more open to the idea of marrying for love.

Indian law has recognized rape, sexual, emotional or verbal abuse of a woman by her husband as crimes. 
In Hinduism, a wife is known as a &quot;Patni&quot; or &quot;Ardhangini&quot; (similar to &quot;the better half&quot;) meaning a part of the husband or his family. In Hinduism, a woman or man can get married, but only have one husband or wife respectively.

In India, women may wear vermilion powder on their foreheads, an ornament called Mangalsutra () which is a form of necklace, or rings on their toes (which are not worn by single women) to show their status as married women.

====Buddhism and Chinese folk religions====
China&#x27;s family laws were changed by the Communist revolution; and in 1950, the People&#x27;s Republic of China enacted a comprehensive marriage law including provisions giving the spouses equal rights with regard to ownership and management of marital property.

====Japan====
In Japan, before enactment of the Meiji Civil Code of 1898, all of the woman&#x27;s property such as land or money passed to her husband except for personal clothing and a mirror stand. See Women in Japan, Law of Japan

==Wife in Abrahamic religions==

===Wife in Christianity===
Christian marriage as based on biblical teachings and conditions, is to be between one woman and one man, that God Himself joined them and that no human is to separate them, according to Christ&#x27;s words (Matthew 19:4-6). The New Testament states that an unmarried Christian woman is to be celibate or is to become the Christian wife of one husband to avoid sexual immorality and for his sexual passion (1 Cor 7:1-2 &amp; 8–9). The New Testament permits divorce of a Christian wife by a Christian husband only if she has committed adultery (Matthew 5:32). The New Testament allows a Christian widow to (re)marry a man she chooses (1 Cor 7:39) but forbids a divorced Christian woman to remarry because she would be committing adultery if she did (Matthew 5:32). As such she is to remain unmarried and celibate or be reconciled with her husband (1 Cor 7:1-2 &amp; 8-9 and 1 Cor 7:10-11). A Christian wife can divorce a non-Christian husband if he wants a divorce (1 Cor 7:12-16). Christian husbands are to love their Christian wives as Christ loved the Church (Ephesians 5:25) and as he loves himself (Ephesians 5:33). The Christian wife is to respect her husband (Ephesians 5:33). Christian husbands are to not be harsh with their Christian wives (Colossians 3:19) and to treat them as a delicate vessel and with honor (1 Peter 3:7).

===Wife in Islam===
Women in Islam have a range of rights and obligations (see main article Rights and obligations of spouses in Islam). Marriage takes place on the basis of a marriage contract. The arranged marriage is relatively common in traditionalist families, whether in Muslim countries or as first or second-generation immigrants elsewhere.

Women in general are supposed to wear specific clothes, as stated by the hadith, like the hijab, which may take different styles depending on the culture of the country, where traditions may seep in. The husband must pay a &quot;mahr&quot; to the bride.

Traditionally, the wife in Islam is seen as a protected, chaste person that manages the household and the family. She has the ever-important role of raising the children and bringing up the next generation of Muslims. In Islam, it is highly recommended that the wife remains at home although they are fully able to own property or work. The husband is obligated to spend on the wife for all of her needs while she is not obligated to spend even if she is wealthy. Muhammad is said to have commanded all Muslim men to treat their wives well. There is a hadith by Al-Tirmidhi, in which Muhammad is said to have stated &quot;The believers who show the most perfect faith are those who have the best character and the best of you are those who are best to their wives.&quot;

Traditionally, Muslim married women are not distinguished from unmarried women by an outward symbol (such as a wedding ring). However, women&#x27;s wedding rings have recently been adopted in the past thirty years from Western culture.

===Wife in Judaism===

==== Rabbinic Judaism ====

Women in Judaism have a range of rights and obligations ( see main article Jewish views on marriage). Marriage takes place on the basis of a Jewish marriage contract, called a Ketubah. There is a blur of arranged marriages and love marriages in traditional families.

Married women, in traditional families, wear specific clothes, like the tichel.

==== Hebrew Bible ====

Once, a man called Shechem, a Hivite, offered a dowry to get an Israelite wife, but was rejected, since he was not an Israelite himself. Genesis 34

In ancient times there were Israelite women who were Judge, Queen regnant, Queen regent, Queen mother, Queen consort, and Prophetess: 
Deborah was the wife of an Israelite man whose name was Lapidoth, which means &quot;torches.&quot; Deborah was a Judge and a Prophetess. 
Esther was the Jewish wife of a Persian King named Ahasuerus. Esther was Queen consort to the King of Persia and at the same time she was Queen regnant of the Jewish people in Persia and their Prophetess.
Bathsheba was the Queen consort of King-Prophet David and then the Queen mother of King-Prophet Solomon. He rose from his throne when she entered and bowed to her and ordered that a throne be brought and he had her sit at his right hand, which is in stark contrast to when she was Queen consort and bowed to King-Prophet David when she entered. Prophet Jeremiah portrays a Queen mother as sharing in her son&#x27;s rule over the kingdom in Jeremiah 13:18-20. 
The wife of Prophet Isaiah was a Prophetess. Isaiah 8:3

==Expectation of fidelity and violence related to adultery==

There is a widely held expectation, which has existed for most of recorded history and in most cultures, that a wife is not to have sexual relations with anyone other than her legal husband. A breach of this expectation of fidelity is commonly referred to as adultery or extramarital sex. Historically, adultery has been considered to be a serious offense, sometimes a crime, and a sin. Even if that is not so, it may still have legal consequences, particularly as a ground for a divorce. Adultery may be a factor to consider in a property settlement, it may affect the status of children, the custody of children; moreover, adultery can result in social ostracism in some parts of the world. In addition, affinity rules of Catholicism, of Judaism and of Islam prohibit an ex-wife or widow from engaging in sexual relations with and from marrying a number of relatives of the former husband.

In parts of the world, adultery may result in violent acts, such as honor killings or stoning. Some jurisdictions, especially those that apply Sharia law, allow for such acts to take place legally.

As of September 2010, stoning is a legal punishment in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Iran, Yemen, the United Arab Emirates, and some states in Nigeria as punishment for zina al-mohsena (&quot;adultery of married persons&quot;).

<doc id="177434" wikidata="Q175760" url="?curid=177434" title="Virgo Supercluster">
<text>The Local Supercluster (LSC or LS), or Virgo Supercluster is a formerly defined supercluster containing the Virgo Cluster and Local Group, which itself contains the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies, as well as others. At least 100 galaxy groups and clusters are located within its diameter of 33 megaparsecs (110 million light-years). The Virgo Supercluster is one of about 10 million superclusters in the observable universe and is in the Pisces–Cetus Supercluster Complex, a galaxy filament.

A 2014 study indicates that the Local Supercluster is only a part of an even greater supercluster, Laniakea, a larger group centered on the Great Attractor, thus subsuming the former Virgo Supercluster under Laniakea.

==Background==
Beginning with the first large sample of nebulae published by William and John Herschel in 1863, it was known that there is a marked excess of nebular fields in the constellation Virgo, near the north galactic pole. In the 1950s, French–American astronomer Gérard de Vaucouleurs was the first to argue that this excess represented a large-scale galaxy-like structure, coining the term &quot;Local Supergalaxy&quot; in 1953, which he changed to &quot;Local Supercluster&quot; (LSC) in 1958. Harlow Shapley, in his 1959 book &quot;Of Stars and Men&quot;, suggested the term &quot;Metagalaxy&quot;. 

Debate went on during the 1960s and 1970s as to whether the Local Supercluster (LS) was actually a structure or a chance alignment of galaxies.
The issue was resolved with the large redshift surveys of the late 1970s and early 1980s, which convincingly showed the flattened concentration of galaxies along the supergalactic plane.

==Structure==
In 1982, R. Brent Tully presented the conclusions of his research concerning the basic structure of the LS. It consists of two components: an appreciably flattened disk containing two thirds of the supercluster&#x27;s luminous galaxies, and a roughly spherical halo containing the remaining third.
The disk itself is a thin (~1 Mpc) ellipsoid with a long axis / short axis ratio of at least 6 to 1, and possibly as high as 9 to 1.
Data released in June 2003 from the 5-year Two-degree-Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dF) has allowed astronomers to compare the LS to other superclusters. The LS represents a typical poor (that is, lacking a high density core) supercluster of rather small size. It has one rich galaxy cluster in the center, surrounded by filaments of galaxies and poor groups. 

The Local Group is located on the outskirts of the LS in a small filament extending from the Fornax Cluster to the Virgo Cluster. The Virgo Supercluster&#x27;s volume is roughly 7,000 times that of the Local Group, or 100 billion times that of the Milky Way.

==Galaxy distribution==
The number density of galaxies in the LS falls off with the square of the distance from its center near the Virgo Cluster, suggesting that this cluster is not randomly located. Overall, the vast majority of the luminous galaxies (less than absolute magnitude −13) are concentrated in a small number of clouds (groups of galaxy clusters). Ninety-eight percent can be found in the following 11 clouds, given in decreasing order of number of luminous galaxies: Canes Venatici, Virgo Cluster, Virgo II (southern extension), Leo II, Virgo III, Crater (NGC 3672), Leo I, Leo Minor (NGC 2841), Draco (NGC 5907), Antlia (NGC 2997), and NGC 5643. 

Of the luminous galaxies located in the disk, one third are in the Virgo Cluster. The remainder are found in the Canes Venatici Cloud and Virgo II Cloud, plus the somewhat insignificant NGC 5643 Group. 

The luminous galaxies in the halo are concentrated in a small number of clouds (94% in 7 clouds). This distribution indicates that &quot;most of the volume of the supergalactic plane is a great void.&quot; A helpful analogy that matches the observed distribution is that of soap bubbles. Flattish clusters and superclusters are found at the intersection of bubbles, which are large, roughly spherical (on the order of 20–60 Mpc in diameter) voids in space.
Long filamentary structures seem to predominate. An example of this is the Hydra–Centaurus Supercluster, the nearest supercluster to the Virgo Supercluster, which starts at a distance of roughly 30 Mpc and extends to 60 Mpc.

==Cosmology==

===Large-scale dynamics===
Since the late 1980s it has been apparent that not only the Local Group, but all matter out to a distance of at least 50 Mpc is experiencing a bulk flow on the order of 600 km/s in the direction of the Norma Cluster (Abell 3627).
Lynden-Bell et al. (1988) dubbed the cause of this the &quot;Great Attractor&quot;. The Great Attractor is now understood to be the center of mass of an even larger structure of galaxy clusters, dubbed &quot;Laniakea&quot;, which includes the Virgo Supercluster (including the Local Group) as well as the Hydra-Centaurus Supercluster, the Pavo-Indus Supercluster, and the Fornax Group.

The Great Attractor, together with the entire supercluster, is found to be moving toward Shapley Supercluster, with center of Shapley Attractor.

===Dark matter===
The LS has a total mass &quot;M&quot; ≈ 1015 and a total optical luminosity &quot;L&quot; ≈ 3 . This yields a mass-to-light ratio of about 300 times that of the solar ratio (/ = 1), a figure that is consistent with results obtained for other superclusters.
By comparison, the mass-to-light ratio for the Milky Way is 63.8 assuming a solar absolute magnitude of 4.83, a Milky Way absolute magnitude of −20.9,
and a Milky Way mass of . These ratios are one of the main arguments in favor of the presence of large amounts of dark matter in the universe; if dark matter did not exist, much smaller mass-to-light ratios would be expected.

<doc id="177436" wikidata="Q656857" url="?curid=177436" title="Great Attractor">
<text>The Great Attractor is a region of gravitational attraction in intergalactic space and the apparent central gravitational point of the Laniakea Supercluster of galaxies that includes the Milky Way galaxy, as well as about 100,000 other galaxies. 

The observed attraction suggests a localized concentration of mass having the order of 1016 solar masses. However, it is obscured by the Milky Way&#x27;s galactic plane, lying behind the Zone of Avoidance (ZOA), so that in visible light wavelengths, the Great Attractor is difficult to observe directly. 

The attraction is observable by its effect on the motion of galaxies and their associated clusters over a region of hundreds of millions of light-years across the universe. These galaxies are observable above and below the Zone of Avoidance; all are redshifted in accordance with the Hubble flow, indicating that they are receding relative to the Milky Way and to each other, but the variations in their redshifts are large enough and regular enough to reveal that they are slightly drawn towards the attraction. The variations in their redshifts are known as &quot;peculiar velocities&quot;, and cover a range from about +700 km/s to −700 km/s, depending on the angular deviation from the direction to the Great Attractor.
The Great Attractor itself is moving towards the Shapley Supercluster.

== History ==
The Great Attractor was named by Alan Dressler in 1987, following decades of redshift surveys that built up a large dataset of redshift values. The redshift values and distance measurements independent of redshift measurements were then combined to create maps of peculiar velocity.

Through a series of peculiar velocity tests, astrophysicists found that the Milky Way was moving in the direction of the constellation of Centaurus at about 600km/s. Then, the discovery of cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipoles was used to reflect the motion of the Local Group of galaxies towards the Great Attractor. The 1980s brought many discoveries about the Great Attractor, such as the fact that the Milky Way is not the only galaxy impacted. Approximately 400 elliptical galaxies are moving toward the Great Attractor beyond the Zone of Avoidance caused by the Milky Way galaxy light.

Intense efforts during the late 1990s, to work through the difficulties caused by the occlusion by the Milky Way, identified the Norma Cluster at the center of the Great Attractor region.

==Location==
The first indications of a deviation from uniform expansion of the universe were reported in 1973 and again in 1978. The location of the Great Attractor was finally determined in 1986: It is situated at a distance of somewhere between 150 and 250 Mly (million light-years) (47–79 Mpc), the larger being the most recent estimate, away from the Milky Way, in the direction of the constellations Triangulum Australe (The Southern Triangle) and Norma (The Carpenter&#x27;s Square). While objects in that direction lie in the Zone of Avoidance (the part of the night sky obscured by the Milky Way galaxy) and are thus difficult to study with visible wavelengths, X-ray observations have revealed that region of space to be dominated by the Norma Cluster (ACO 3627), a massive cluster of galaxies containing a preponderance of large, old galaxies, many of which are colliding with their neighbours and radiating large amounts of radio waves.

==Debate over apparent mass==
In 1992, much of the apparent signal of the Great Attractor was attributed to a statistical effect called &quot;Malmquist bias&quot;. In 2005, astronomers conducting an X-ray survey of part of the sky known as the &quot;Clusters in the Zone of Avoidance&quot; (CIZA) project reported that the Great Attractor was actually only one tenth the mass that scientists had originally estimated. The survey also confirmed earlier theories that the Milky Way galaxy is in fact being pulled toward a much more massive cluster of galaxies near the Shapley Supercluster, which lies beyond the Great Attractor, and which is called the Shapley Attractor.

== Norma Wall ==

A massive galaxy filament, called the Norma Wall (also called Great Attractor Wall) is located at the center of the supposed position of the Great Attractor. The Norma Wall contains the clusters Pavo II, Norma, Centaurus-Crux and CIZA J1324.7−5736. The most massive cluster in this region is the Norma supercluster. Later studies found that the wall continues over to the constellations of Centaurus and Vela.

==Laniakea Supercluster==

The proposed Laniakea Supercluster is defined as the Great Attractor&#x27;s basin. It covers approximately four main galaxy superclusters, including superclusters of Virgo and Hydra–Centaurus, and spans across 500 million light years. Because it is not dense enough to be gravitationally bound, it should be dispersing as the universe expands, but it is instead anchored by a gravitational focal point. Thus the Great Attractor would be the core of the new supercluster. The local flows of the Laniakea supercluster converge in the region of the Norma and Centaurus Clusters, approximately at the position of the Great Attractor.
